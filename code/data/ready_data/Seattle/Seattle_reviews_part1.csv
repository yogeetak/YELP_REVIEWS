On my way back out to boring suburbs for the Night, I stopped here for some wonton soup plus extra vegetables to go and was more than satisfied. The flavor of both the broth and wontons was intense and fresh. The vegetable was some type of fresh greens and was perfectly prepared. They packed the wontons/ veggies and
Broth separately so that it would t get soggy on the way home. Wontons have visible whole shrimp as well as meat in them and very delicate wrap. 
First time I&#39;d been here and I&#39;d definitely come again. There are enough other items worth trying as well. It was also easy enough to park in a little lot next to it too. Tough to find in that neighborhood. Decor inside is very basic but I&#39;d feel comfortable eating in too. The person who took my order was able to kindly answer my questions in English and the order came very fast yet was plenty hot. Only reason I didn&#39;t put five star was maybe because it&#39;s so &#39;basic&#39; in decor and parking lot
Being dark and narrow and I&#39;m not sure how to rate that in a low cost downtown restaurant since ANY parking is a miracle at such a value.  
I hope this place doesn&#39;t get gentrified out of existence anytime soon."

Will that day is today. If you want a bowl of wonton soup with me, it&#39;s going to cost you close to 10 bucks. That&#39;s unheard of. This place is pretty close to Hong Kong style, but I don&#39;t know if it would be worth the $10.  Usually, when you go to eat noodle soup you want to be able to get out totally stuffed for under ten bucks after tax and tip.
 
 Broth is meat base and you can taste the dried shrimp which is nice. The serving sizes are not huge, but pretty standard size. All their won ton &amp; sui gow are handmade in house. I always see them making it, or at least I see the tray of half won ton , sitting out on the table, for the entire time we were there, circled with flies.  It&#39;s ok, pretty standard in Chinese restaurants.

You wouldn&#39;t think it, but there seemed kidney served with a side of spicy soy sauce is actually one of my favorites! This is the first place I&#39;ve tried it and it is pretty delicious, nice and crunchy texture and not yucky!"

I know the location can be intimidating for those not familiar with the International District but trust me, it&#39;s what comes in the bowl is what matters. I always get the wonton noodle soup. I never add anything to it like pepper or chili paste because I don&#39;t like to mask the flavor of the wontons. They are handmade every day! Not sure if the noodles are also hand made, I would assume they may as well be. 

This particular check-in I got the wonton noodle soup with a side of veggies. The veggies just makes the soup  more well rounded. The nice thing about the veggies is that they are just lightly steamed so you still get some crunch. I think it&#39;s Chinese broccoli. It&#39;s so good though with the soup! 

What is also great is the price, everything is very reasonable. I&#39;ve always taken mine to go, the soup is super hot when they give it to you so that by the time you get home (I live in Puyallup, mom lives in Kent) it&#39;s still pretty warm. We like to heat the broth up in a saucepan before eating so the noodles can flow freely in our bowls. 

I&#39;ve been to the Canton Wonton House, which is on Weller. That one is good too, but this one is much better so don&#39;t get them mixed up be cause their names are pretty similar. The family is super nice! The mom was making wontons while the young gentleman (son maybe?) was ringing people up and taking care of the customers dining in. So friendly and their service is fast! Don&#39;t have to wait too long for your soup. 

I wouldn&#39;t come here for ambiance or for a romantic date. This is a legit noodle house, you come here hungry and cold, you leave full to the brim and warm. I love this place and can&#39;t wait to come back. My mom is pretty good when it comes to food, so if she loves it, you should love it too! :)"

The restaurant itself it just a whole in the wall and not very big in size. It just didn&#39;t have that clean feeling which makes me cringe sometimes when I walk into a restaurant.

 My gf and I both ordered the Century old eggs and diced pork congee. It was came in a nice big bowl and it was filing with lots of ingredients inside. It was not watery like most places and had a good overall flavor to the whole meal. One of the best congee I have had at a restaurant in awhile. The menu isn&#39;t very extensive as they stick to mostly to wonton noodle soups and congee as the main selling points.

The Chinese doughnut wasn&#39;t very good as it was not warm and I could tell it was probably left over from the previous day. It was kind of hard and didn&#39;t have that soft texture of a doughnut if made on the same day. Since we were there pretty early when they first open I could see that we could&#39;ve gotten some day old stuff.

One good thing is that they also have a small parking lot just to the right of the restaurant, but filled with big potholes. Good for not having to look for parking if going to Chinatown which is terrible sometimes.

Price point wasn&#39;t bad and we were able to get our food with not much of a wait. I am undecided if I would return since there are other congee places in Chinatown I haven&#39;t tried plus they need a remodel."

I remember eating here as a child with my mother. I was feeling nostalgic today and wanted to revisit my childhood.

The broth lacked flavor. Noodles were too chewy, the mini wontons had a nice flavor but is incomparable to Mikes Noodle House. Not to mention, as I was paying the lady making the wonton dumplings handled my money without washing her hands. I hope she doesn&#39;t cross contaminate. Yuck.

The only upside is service was quick and the soup came out pipping hot. Unfortunately, I will not be returning."

They handmade their wontons everyday so it is fresh to eat for the customers and they even have frozen wontons to go if you want to make some at home.

Sigh... Can&#39;t there be a place in Seattle with the excellent wonton, egg noodle, and broth simultaneously? Life is so hard. It&#39;s like these businesses are colluding to create an oligopoly, which would make so much more money if they decided to make a monopoly on that  wonton egg noodle game in Seattle.

It&#39;s like those various schools of martial arts in those kung fu movies, snake style vs praying mantis style. The wonton egg noodle soup at these different places have their pros and their cons. We need a single noodle house in Seattle that is like an MMA fighter and can make decent wonton, broth, and noodles... at the same time.

I ordered the combo won ton and Sui Kau noodle soup.  Noodles were chewy and the won tons were tasty.  I found the Sui Kau extremely salty for some reason.  It had ground porks and wood ear mushrooms, but for some reason they over seasoned it.

The menu states the broth is made with chicken and pork bones and dried fish and dried shrimp.  I thought it was an odd combination but decide most broths must be made this way and I just didn&#39;t realize it, oh how wrong I was.  

I decided on the wonton noodle soup, it arrives and smells funny to me, a little fishy I think.  I tasted it, a little too fishy tasting for my taste buds.  I add some of the oil with chili flakes in it, thankfully that helps to flatten the fishy taste for me but I&#39;m still not that impressed.

I guess I&#39;m used to seeing won tons being made table-side (because honestly, its like that with most of these noodle houses in Chinatown: a la Szechuan Noodle Bowl) 

Definitely gung ho for the sui kau with wide rice noodles and an order of Chinese donuts on the side- its my order time and again, I never get disappointed. The service, although a little lackluster (but I don&#39;t expect much from a place that has iron bars over its window) isn&#39;t new to me. This is cheap eats at its finest, and its downright fine to me."

When we come, the owner always comes and seats us to our table with a nice welcoming smile. My mom and I always know what to order. Our usuals include the Sui Kao noodle soup, plain noodle soup with veggies, or the original wonton noodle soup. We then always order a side of Chinese donuts (a crusty bread to add to your soup) or a side of veggies with oyster sauce!

The old friend is &#34;Canton Noodle House&#34; They have parking and good wonton.  So what it&#39;s not a fanciful place? I like the people, their wonton, soup and noodles.  Didi ordered chuk (porridge) Their chuk has improved.  Extra points for that.

Canton Noodle is a clean, quiet place off the main drag of the ID.  From the outside it looks quite plain, but on the inside it&#39;s warm and friendly.

Both times I&#39;ve had the Sui Kau soup (my favorite), with pork and shrimp dumplings.  The broth tastes clean and flavorful, not funky like some places.  Dumplings are some of the best I&#39;ve had in this area - you can tell they&#39;re using quality ingredients and putting care into each dumpling they make.  

Everything is made fresh daily, and you can even buy frozen wonton and sui kau dumplings to take home.  The staff are very friendly and helpful and they care about what they&#39;re doing.  Definitely going on the &#34;regular&#34; list!"

When we make it at home, it&#39;s just adequate. When I go out and eat it, it&#39;s never really that yummy. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve always gone out for Pho, Red Robin and any place BUT wonton noodle houses.

I just went back today, and let me tell you: Since the last time I went here with my mother--it hasn&#39;t deteriorated in taste whatsoever. A lot of places I&#39;ve gone to end up being amazing the first few times, and then a year or two later when I go back it&#39;s just not as good. But this place has kept up the pace, and their noodles are just delicious. I&#39;m not a very big fan of drinking the soup after I eat everything in it, but the flavoring is just so delicious.

And their congee? Let me tell you right now, straight up: I hate congee with a passion. I mean, I HATE it. It&#39;s disgusting. I never saw the appeal. But my mum&#39;s friends with the owner of this place (so, I&#39;m pretty biased towards the service, which is why I won&#39;t comment on that other than, what do you really expect from a small place?), and she treated us to a bowl since my grandparents were with us, and let me tell you (with utter disbelief):

I am in love with their congee. It&#39;s that good.

The same goes for their sui-kou. I hated that stuff too before I came here. xD And usually, I have to add a lot of flavoring on my own, which adds up to calories and it really bothers me. But whenever I eat here? I don&#39;t need to add anything. It&#39;s yummy just the way it is, and my tummy definitely approves."

1) the noodle soup is good, i usually don&#39;t drink broths when it comes to restaurant broths (it&#39;s weird, don&#39;t ask) I think the flavor of the brisket is pretty good, i enjoy the dumplings more though.  it&#39;s not bad.

2) pork liver and kidney congee, i really do like &#34;those&#34; kind of stuff but the wrong doing of this dish is that usually it&#39;s too watery.  I like my congee a LITTLE watery, not the way they have it.  I mean who wouldn&#39;t want to feel like they are getting their moneys worth?  and not just &#34;drinking watered down congee. 

service wise, the wife/co-owner usually serves while the children are at school.  her and the hubby is very friendly, my family and i go there enough that they recognize us individually (you know how sometimes you go places with your parents and they only recognize you only IF you&#39;re with your parents?) they always greet me with &#34;hi lang nuy&#34; just means hi pretty girl. It&#39;s easy to carry a conversation with them especially when business is slow and i&#39;m waiting on my food.

I was still hungry and drove by this place on my way home.  After hearing Michael and Mitzie&#39;s horror stories, I had to try it out for myself.  

As soon as I walked in, I was hit with an unpleasant fishy smell.  But I dealt with it and moved on.  There were only Asian people inside, which usually means I&#39;ll like the food.  I ordered the Noodle Soup with Wontons and Fish Balls (bet you didn&#39;t know fish had balls, did ya?).  It was good, but not quite as good as Canton Wonton House (no affiliation).  I found the broth to be adequately seasoned and rich.  The wontons were a little on the small side, but delicious.

Finally went there when our regular awesome noodle place Canton WONTON House (across from Uwajimaya) was closed again for 4 weeks and were really craving for noodles. 
Ordered the soup on the side wonton noodles, the noodles are not &#34;spongy&#34;(Q), it tasted powdery and the soup is tasteless yet way too peppery. Tried dumping chilli oil and soy sauce over it but really didn&#39;t help much.
Prices are steep as compared to the Canton WONTON house. Not accepting credit cards is another down side for this place. The waitress (owner?) was really nice and friendly though, her son even went around handling out lollipop for the kids.
The waitress was handling money and wrapping wontons in between - didn&#39;t see her wash hands nor wear gloves (ewww!), she was distracted by the TV and the plate of wonton fillings and wrappers were sitting uncovered while she waits on tables and watches Chinese soap opera - hmm are those the same wontons I just ate? 
I guess I&#39;m so used to watching the chef cook my noodles at the Canton WONTON House that I was expecting the same at this place, so when she took my order and disappeared into the back room, a strange &#34;if-fyness&#34; just aroused!

I must admit that while I was not expecting a large restaurant style place I was disappointed with the setup.  It is a little rundown, sparse and it was empty.  Service by the one waitress was fine but the food fell shorter than the place.  I know that it looks and sounds like the hole-in-wall that most like to discover.  But let us face it, in Seattle in the 2000s even the hole-in-the-wall needs to be more upgraded than this.  And the food was bland, wonton poorly wrapped in thick skin, soup thin without the usual seafood flavor, and lacking in the aroma I expect from my wonton soup.  Disappointing.  Fortunately I found another."

The food okay. I felt the tuna tartare was a little over powered by the habanero sesame oil. We had beignets, risotto, etc. all good.

It took about 10-15 minutes after our order before the bread came out. It was fairly delicious and ravaged through it all pretty quickly. After about another 15 minutes our salad came out. That was probably the best tasting dish of the night.

Perhaps steak and burgers is not what you get at a French restaurant, but we really did not know what to eat. The waitress recommended the strip but it was fairly dry and so was the burger. The foie gras looked like it was cooked well, but was refrigerator cold on the inside.

All-in-all I was about 130 dollars in and it took about 2.5 to 3 hours of our time (which if you have been to France is typical)."

First off, let&#39;s talk about their duck fat fries. UHHHMAZING. They also have SUCH a great selection of wine (I mean, duh, that&#39;s a lot of what they focus on here but still I was blown away). 

The service here is also amazing. From the person that greets you at coat check to the servers working the bar, it was all very personable and fun.

I love the way this place is decorated, too! Love all the old fashioned train station signs with the wine listings and LOVE all the old lights they have hanging.

I ordered the beef tartare, the steak with duck fat fries, and an apple tart for dessert. My friend ordered the lamb shank, lettuce salad, and the Beignets.  We even got a side of mac and cheese, just because we wanted to try it.

Service is very friendly and relatively fast seeing as the place was packed and had a waiting list and overall, I thought everything was very good. The meat was seasoned well,  succulent and tender.  Lamb shank looked dry but it was actually fall off the bone tender... So good.   The tartare and salad were fine and good though did not really stand out.  Would skip on the salad next time, though with the heavier dishes something light in contrast is nice.  Mac and cheese was on the heavier side, but good comfort food.   Beignets were a little heavy and had seasalt with it,  but it was still quite yummy and the apple tart was a great compliment to my meal.  A slightly larger scoop of ice cream would have made it better tho haha.   

Normally an entree is around 30-40, so a 3 course meal for 30-50 (depending on your entree /side) is a great deal!   Happy I finally was able to try here after all these years and anticipate I will definitely try to come back here again!"

It was a very cool looking restaurant with a great warm ambiance to it with the dim lighting. He made reservations, so we got seated immediately to a comfortable booth. I&#39;ve always liked sitting in booths rather than seats for some weird reason. Our waiter was very attentive and knew the menu inside out. There&#39;s nothing better than great service and someone who knew how to lead us to the right direction when it came to ordering. After several minutes trying to decide, our waiter recommended us to do a tasting. I&#39;ve never had one, so we decided to do that for the evening. 

The tasting was 5 courses with a dessert at the end, and boy was I seriously full by the fourth dish! The first dish that came out was a chilled tomato sorbet with amuse, ikura, and tomato seeds. It was so refreshing and I just wanted more of the interesting concoction. The second tasting was a seared foie gras with scallions, cauliflower, and apple. The scallion was seared perfectly and was very tender. The next tasting was an interesting broth that the waiter poured in front of our eyes. There were local foraged wild mushrooms with marinated egg yolk, scallions, and dashi. I was definitely a little afraid to try eating a raw egg, but I really liked it! And the broth was so flavorful. The fouth tasting was roasted sable fish and my stomach was starting to get full by this point. The skin was crispy and the fish was cooked amazingly. Just when I thought the tastings were over, the last dish came out and it was glazed short ribs. I took a bite and it was so delicious! The vegetables were very complimentary of the ribs, but too bad my stomach was beyond capacity.

After each tastings, the waiter cleared and cleaned off our table. He also nicely replaced our utensils with clean ones each time, which was impressive. Dessert came out, but this time, it was a special request my boyfriend asked for, it was beignet with bourbon sauce spelling out &#34;Happy Quarter Century Ada!&#34; with a lit candle and it was the cutest thing ever! For me, there&#39;s always a second stomach for dessert, so I finished a beignet and dipped it in the sauce. Personally, I don&#39;t like alcohol too much so I didn&#39;t dip it the second time. The beignet was yummy though! Then came the last tasting, which was a blueberry microcake which was plated so delicately and beautifully! I definitely nibbled on everything, but couldn&#39;t finish it. The ice cream was great with the chia seeds and sauce on the plate. 

Overall, I really enjoyed eating at this restaurant. The service was lovely and the food was amazing. They even packed a couple madeline cookies for us to go as part of the tasting menu, so that made for a great tea duo the next morning. Definitely will try to come back next time when I&#39;m visiting Seattle!"

My biggest gripe about this place is the service. SERVICE IS SO SLOW. like painstakingly slow. We ordered our three courses but in between each course there was at least a 10 minute wait with dessert having a 35 minute what. what are they doing out back? milking the cow and grounding the flour? who knows. Thank goodness we weren&#39;t on a time constraint (that they did ask, we should of said yes for more prompt service but I fear it still wouldn&#39;t help).

Food. I&#39;ve came to realize that RN74 likes their food really salty. like REALLY SALTY. the veloute was good but again, just really salty. I got the fish and chips and while the fish batter wasn&#39;t as crispy as I was hoping, the fries were very good. Dessert I got the beignets as did most of the table and that was what was holding up the kitchen, dessert shouldn&#39;t take that long, I could understand maybe the main entrée but not dessert.

The first was this spring for lite bites and this one was for lunch during restaurant week. Now, the reason we chose this spot to visit during restaurant week was to get a better sense of their style and execution - we had heard good things. We purposely waited until about 1:40 for lunch to ensure the major rush was over. Unfortunately we left a bit disappointed. 

Food 3.5/5: Our appetizers (parsnip &amp; apple veloute and country pate) were well executed, both were well balanced, tasty, and presented well. 
The mains (fish &amp; chips and steak frites) were both pretty generic - nothing about them was original, surprising, or in any way showcasing greatness. The fries on both plates were past their prime.
Deserts were really nothing special either. We tried the profiteroles with salted caramel ice cream, which again were pretty generic tasting, but looked pretty. The beignets with pot du creme were ok, but they were heavy and there was too much syrup on the top of the pot du creme overwhelming the other flavors. 
Overall it was just OK.

Atmosphere: 5/5: Really great space and decor - upscale cozy without being at all pertentious. 

Service 3.5/5: We elected to sit at the bar as we enjoy socializing with the bartender and other diners when possible. Something must have gone awry before we came in as there was only one other couple seated at the bar and the bartender was visibly and verbally getting overwhelmed as a few more people came in.

Overall just didn&#39;t meet expectations based on reputation."

Most recently, I came here with hubby on a Tuesday evening for Seattle Restaurant Week. We made a reservation for 6pm and was seated right away.

Atmosphere: Well decorated with dim lighting. The round booth seats are a nice touch. We were sat on the bar-high round tables of to the right, across from the bar. The bar was busy and so was the entire place. The tables in the back looked pretty crowded. The music was on the louder side; I had a tough time trying to carry out a conversation. That&#39;s a little disappointing for a dinner location.

Food: The food is good but I guess we had higher expectations given the reviews. For appetizers we had the Beef Tartare and the Roasted Parsnip &amp; Apple Veloute. These were quite enjoyable. The Veloute had a nice aroma and was a creamy soup. The beef tartare was tasty with accents of capers and spices. 
For entree we had the Parisian Gnocchi and the Steak Frites au Poivre. First, the portioning was much smaller than I had hoped, and in comparison to other Restaurant Week locations. I have to say that the fries were very well cooked and was the best part. The gnocchi was only a few bites, but rich in flavor. The steak came out on the much rarer side of medium rare and was chewy. The steak wasn&#39;t seasoned very much and had a heavy basil taste.
For dessert, we had the Apple Tart Tatin and the Profiteroles. Apple tart: you can&#39;t go wrong with sugar and apple, but it was lacking in depth of flavor. The profiteroles had a good balance of salt and caramel. 

Service: Really quick. Everyone was pleasant.

Not bad, just not worth the hype."

It&#39;s a little on the spendy end but the food is delicious and the menu boasts an extensive wine list. The inside is lit with quirky light bulbs and the decorations hint at a train station style, especially with a changing reader board listing bottles of wine that are almost sold out and therefore at a slightly lower price for guests to try before they are gone. Someplace to go for a nice celebration with friends or special occasion."

Every experience that I have had here was ehhh, Thought I would give it another chance since I haven&#39;t been here for lunch and saw that it was an option during restaurant week. 

Joined RN74 for lunch with my coworkers during restaurant week. Even though it was restaurant week, I expect that service and food taste/quality to be the same (maybe just a little bit smaller portions). 

Let&#39;s go in order of how our lunch experience went:
Got seated directly behind the bar, approximately 10-15 mins passed with no acknowledgement from any staff member, no menu, and no water. 
Our server finally arrived, took our order (very rudely, may I add), then did not see him again until the end of our last course when we asked for our check (an hour or more later). 
One person ordered a glass of wine, never received it. 
Course one, arrived 30 mins later. 
Course two, arrived 20-30 mins later.
One person ordered dessert, never received it. 
Total time spent at the restaurant for the two courses was approximately 2 hours. We spent more time waiting for our server to come and give us our check (and waiting for our courses), than anything.

It&#39;s unfortunate that I have to give this place a &#39;two star&#39; but the total dining experience was lack thereof anything enjoyable/memorable. (They have nice light fixtures though.)"

It was blustery and cold, too much to walk all the way to Belltown. So glad that happened: the food and wine here are exactly as good as the décor and price points would suggest. I  asked the bartender to recommend me a glass to go with my choice of steak, and he immediately knew what to offer me. When I went for my usual &#34;medium well&#34;, he gently encouraged me to go for a different option on that particular steak. He regaled me with the history of the restaurant, explained the choice of decor, and tried to make a connection. It payed off: I will definitely be back here soon."

Food: They only served the Restaurant Week menu at lunch.  My friend and I both ordered the steak and duck fat fries.  There was a $10 up charge but worth it.  We got a nicely portioned steak and the fries were the perfect texture.  The beignets and that caramel sauce ended the meal on a sweet note.  

Service:  Attentive and well paced.  We didn&#39;t feel rushed but they were there when we needed something.  Brought out a candle with our desserts since I mentioned we&#39;re doing a birthday lunch.  It was nice to see the servers work as a team and help create an enjoyable experience.

I came across RN74 and took a look at the menu. I&#39;ve been wanting to try lobster pot pie for some time now so I was pretty excited when I made a reservation. Upon arrival the restaurant was dimly lit as expected. We arrived about 15 minutes early but decided to check in at that time. The hostess seated us about 15 minutes later in the bar area. 

// SERVICE //
The service here in my opinion lacked. I expected a little more from the service. I feel like the reason that part of our service was lacking was because the table next to us somehow knew the chef. The chef came out to greet them and told them not to worry about anything since he&#39;ll create items for them that aren&#39;t on the menu. At this point I was curious to know the relationship between them and the chef, but I soon forgot as our service started to lack. All of the staff in the restaurant pretty much made a stop at the table next to us, but overlooked us many times. 

// FOOD //
Alaskan king crab pot pie: Puff pastry with pieces of king crab in an old-bay crab cream sauce. I was unimpressed by this dish. I feel like this is one of the signature dishes at Michael Mina&#39;s restaurants and this was so disappointing. The puff pastry was chewy and not flaky at all. The King crab portion was fair, but it did absolutely nothing for the dish. I would have enjoyed the lobster pot pie more. I don&#39;t mind spending money on good food, but this was a waste of money. Not worth it at all. 1/5

Pleasant view farm duck tasting: Consisted of the duck breast, gizzard and heart with a side of classic cassoulet. The best thing on the dish was the duck heart. Amazing texture and flavor! The breast and gizzard were just okay. The cassoulet was so dry and flavorless. It would have been better if they didn&#39;t include it on the dish. Overall, 2/5, but the heart was a 4/5. 

Crispy Brussels sprouts: Sweet and sour apple cider glaze: These Brussels sprouts were pretty good. I wasn&#39;t sure about the glaze, but it turned out excellent. I would recommend getting this as a side. 3.5/5

Overall, I was sorely disappointed with both the food and service at RN74. Maybe I had my expectations set too high, but I was expecting a lot more from RN74. I don&#39;t think I would ever come back to this restaurant and I would suggest going elsewhere for a meal."

Considering I ate out for every single meal, this is quite the honor. The name is a bit hard to remember and most places that have a hybrid of random letters and numbers tend to be, but it gives clue that the establishment is more bistro-esque and New American than the average restaurant. 
Upon walking in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess, which I appreciated, and I thought the place was well decorated! I loved the lighting and the back wall, as well as the moving wine menu along the right side of the wall. (They have this at the Starbucks Roastery on Pine Street, btw) 

Everything we had was fantastic. The duck fat fries were generous in portion size, and I ordered the Alaskan Crab Salad as an entree. For $24 you&#39;d think it would be a little bigger, but I was already so stuffed with the complimentary roll and fries that I was relieved that I didn&#39;t have a mountain load of rabbit food to chew through. But the salad was delicious, needless to say! 

My friends ordered the mussels and the meatballs, and the burger. Apparently the burger was nothing to write home about but the meatball appetizer was great. The mussels looked small from across the table but my friend didn&#39;t seem to complain about the amount or size, so we&#39;re good on that. 

For dessert, the tiramisu arrived in a non-standard form. The chef had split off into lady fingers and all of the components of a tiramisu were there, just not in tact as one would imagine. I loved it though! Our server was really great through the whole evening and I know that I certainly carried away with a few requests and questions. He answered and addressed everything with a smile, and that is one reason I will recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Seattle!"

We ordered:

- duck fat fries $7 (these were delicious and a good portion!)
- fried oyster lettuce cup $8 (these were good too, oysters were big and juicy)

Overall, it was a good experience here. Probably more fun if it was with a group of coworkers or friends. Loved the atmosphere here, their alcohol selection is good here too."

Last night we ordered:

A selection of Taylor Shellfish Oysters. Very sweet and fresh, with just a hint of brine.

Michael Mina&#39;s Classic Ahi Tuna Tartare. Well seasoned yet light. Very fresh - not a hint of fishiness. The pine nuts added a pop of texture and flavor. They served it with some white toast which was kind of weirdly bland and boring. The portion size was quite small for the price. Still, this was one of my favorites of the night. Simple concept, excellent execution.

Roasted La Belle Foie Gras Doughnut. I was expecting great things of this dish! Sadly I think the sauce (berries and honey?) was too sweet and strong, overpowering the foie gras. In the end it mostly tasted just like a normal doughnut and not as spectacular as I was hoping.

Alaskan King Crab Pot Pie. I was also expecting great things of this dish, and it delivered! The presentation was a bit of a show: the server brought a plate with braised carrots and other vegetables (all cooked to perfection), on which he placed a round of puff pastry (flaky and buttery), on which he spooned huge chunks of king crab (oh, the crab, it was sweet and succulent and firm without being chewy in the least...everything you want crab to be...my mouth is watering just thinking about it now), on which he poured a cream sauce (rich and flavorful and tying everything together). Everything on the plate came together really well, all the different textures and flavors complemented each other. I highly recommend this dish. (FYI this dish is listed at MP, which was $68 for us last night - YMMV.)

RR Ranch Beef Short Rib Bourguignon. The beef was very tender and flavorful, but nothing about this dish really stood out to me. A tad over salted.

Duck Fat Fries. AMAZING. Bursting with flavor and just the perfect crispiness. A satisfying crunch with every bite. Logically I know they must be really fattening but they didn&#39;t taste greasy at all! Actually I think these might be among the best fries I have ever tasted. Warning: an addiction may form if you order these fries...they probably sprinkle them with crack or something because I couldn&#39;t get enough of them.

Crispy Brussels Sprouts and Roasted &#34;Paris&#34; Mushrooms. Lumping these two together because I felt the same about them: tasty, and good side dishes to round out the meal, but nothing really special about them.

Overall: the dishes varied in quality, but the better ones were REALLY good and even the not-as-good ones were still solid. The atmosphere was classy yet relaxed. Our server was friendly, helpful, and attentive. We had lots of questions with the menu and he offered great suggestions. Only downside is the dishes arrived very slowly (dinner took quite a bit longer than average - so don&#39;t try to schedule anything right after dinner!)."

It especially has a great vibe during the lunch hour, and plates are reasonably priced. Portions are generous, ingredients incredibly fresh, and the service is superb. A great joint to check out during a Restaurant Week since you can sample some of his most popular items at a reasonable price. 

I admit I would come here every day just for his hand-cut and served warm beignets, or maybe just simply eat the dipping sauce (MacCallan 12 scotch-based salted caramel/butterscotch sauce layered over sweet cream). It can&#39;t get any more decadent, and you can really taste the bite of the scotch. Definitely a creative pairing, and great for scotch fans, or anyone with a sweet tooth."

I often feel let-down by many of these hyped-up trendy restaurants in Seattle these days, but I like this one a lot. I&#39;ve been here for both HH and dinner, and I&#39;ve never been not impressed.

To be honest, I&#39;ve never had any of their entreés because I&#39;ve happened to be on the not-so-hungry side each time I&#39;ve gone, but their appetizers and smaller dishes are delectable.

I mean HOLY DUCK FAT FRIES. 

I&#39;m not even kidding -- these are quite possibly the best fries you will ever have in your entire life.  Crisp to perfection and oozing with umami. I have no qualms at all about paying $9 for fries this good. (And during happy hour, they are $7!) If you have to limit yourself to one and only one item at this restaurant, get these fries! They will change your life!

Crispy Brussels sprouts are another favorite. Glazed with sweet and sour apple cider, tasty, and difficult to stop eating! You hear about those veggie dishes that convert vegetable haters into herbivores for a night? These guys are totally that!

I&#39;m also a big fan of the sliders on the HH menu. Delicious and presented so cutely!

Oh, and their extensive wine selection? Win.

Service is always amazingly professional. I&#39;ve never had mediocre service here ever.

I was off today so we decided to go for lunch.  One great thing about their lunch menu is that every item looks delicious.

We both started with the butternut squash.  It is extraordinary, creamy and seasoned just right.  For the main course, I got the steak tri-tips with fries while my wife got then with salad.  The steak was outstanding, great meat cooked perfectly.  Then the fries might be the best in seattle.

It is a bargain if you can eat there for lunch, but the dinners are terrific  also."

The menu has changed and so has the atmosphere. The lights seemed brighter and the music loud. I was so taken back by the new menu I thought I&#39;d order small plates to try things out. The Bacon deviled eggs were very small and tasted like something from a potluck-not bad but for $9 and two eggs, I expected much more. The foie gras was another story. This dish made no sense at all. It was layered on top of a soggy phyllo, crepe wedge of some kind. The foie itself was stone cold slimy. I&#39;ve had foie gras many times and understand how it&#39;s to be cooked but this was not ideal. The only saving grace from this dining experience was the service. Our waiter was wonderful, warm and accommodating.

I have dined at RN74 several times in the past. I recall it being unapologetically expensive but with a promise of unapologetically amazing food which made the price and wait worthwhile. I feel it is now just expensive with an unimaginative menu to appeal to the masses and an atmosphere that takes away from what this place once was."

Despite having reservations, we waited 30 min for our table. Once seated, it was another 20 min before we had any service. We brought our own wine-corkage fee is $20. Our own wine was the best part of the meal. We both went with marinated bistro steak -frites with bernaise and dungeness for $55 each. I requested medim rare and my friend requested medium-both steaks were medium rare and neither was particularly tender. The bernaise was lackluster and the dungeness portion was approx one tablespoon. The fries were uninspired. The quality of the meal could have been replicated at any large chain for less than half the price. We tried the beignet which was overfried but the best item we ordered. With the numerous quality restaurants downtown, this one is totally missable."

Obviously you should be able to tell that it&#39;s not a cheap place. But they used to have a happy hour that was a steal. For $6 you could get some really good food, and a beer for the same price.

First issue is their beer selection. It&#39;s generally pretty bad, at least that&#39;s my view. I&#39;ve never loved any beer I&#39;ve had there. Though I&#39;ve also never hated it.

I was thrown off by the happy hour menu change (update your website?), So I decided to order the burger, which actually tasted great. The issue is it didn&#39;t taste good enough to be a $24 burger. The fries on the side were pretty small, and there was no delicious aioli sauce like there used to be. I&#39;d still recommend it though if you don&#39;t care about the price.

I saw someone who ordered just the fries, and it was clearly not the same size it used to be. Still, they&#39;re good, so if you&#39;re fine not getting a great deal anymore, still keep coming.

In the end that&#39;s the conclusion. Everything still tastes good. It&#39;s just no longer a great deal. And that&#39;s fine.

I&#39;m also a little annoyed that the bartender handed me my bill without me asking. I&#39;d spent over $40 in 30 minutes, which I think is enough to not be rushed out of the bar. I had planned on spending the night there drinking bit by bit until I had to leave for my flight, but didn&#39;t feel inclined after getting handed my bill.

Probably won&#39;t be coming back. Time to find a new bar for my next Seattle visit."

We did the degustation menu. Divine. Truly. I have e allergies to shellfish and no problem, at all, they just made up two courses on the fly. Delicious. 

The staff, one word, genuine. Service was superb. Warm, friendly, genuine. Chef came out multiple times to check and genuinely wanted to know how the food was. The waitress genuinely wanted the experience to be great and gave us little tips about wines and places in the area to go, shared personal stories.

The decor of the restaurant is very classy yet casual, with small tables, booths, and a couch area where people waited and drank around a coffee table. The place was moderately loud. There were definitely some loud chatters around, but hey, I cannot complain coming with 12 other people who were also busy chattering away :P. 

Off of the restaurant menu, I ordered the Farro Salad, Steak and Frites, and the Hazelnut ice cream puff dessert! The Farro Salad was phenomenal. It was super delicious. The farro was subtly coated with a creamy dressing, plumb, perfect level of chewiness, and deep rich grain flavors. Topped with Arugula and a gentle touch of vinaigrette. I thoroughly enjoyed this appetizer. The Steak and Frites was very good as well. The steak was a little chewy but the flavors were all there! It was cooked well to my desired medium. The duck fat fries were yummy, however, they were just fries to me. Oh My God, the dessert, I cannot remember the exact name of it, and can&#39;t seem to find it on their online menu, but it was chocolate something, and it had hazelnut ice cream inside two pieces of pastry coated with oreo cookies and powdered sugar! OHHH it was delicious! Highly recommend.

The atmosphere RN74 has is totally different from what I&#39;m used to. The restaurant is filled with all kinds of antique looking decoration and the lighting is low but very warm. It gives a cozy feel to the place. The waiting area/lounge is spacious, we came for lunch so I can only image how long wait times for dinner must be so it&#39;s a good thing it&#39;s super comfy. RN74 would be a good place to meet with a friend and catch up over a light lunch.

The meal I ordered was the steak salad. Boy, that thing was delicious. The presentation was &#39;meh&#39;, the chefs were probably rushing to get all the orders finished and out on time (party of 8), so I understand. The steak I ordered was medium rare, each bite was so flavorful including the greens. The dish was perfectly seasoned. I was able to leave the restaurant not feeling super full and uncomfortable.

Staff was friendly but when they weren&#39;t able to match dishes to the right people they blamed us lol? If I had the chance I&#39;d come back again. But next time maybe for dinner? :-)"

I first visited this concept in San Francisco a few years ago and fell in love with the simplicity of the food and wine list. This location delivers the same transparent excellence in both quality of ingredients and presentation. It&#39;s fun to see and taste pretty food!   

I enjoyed the signature Ahi tuna tartare, cauliflower soup, fish sandwich with duck fat fries and beignets with butterscotch sauce.
The tartare was superb, soup full of body and silky yumminess, the fish was fine though it would be helpful to offer a little more information on presentation and the fries had ketchup on them already?, the beignets were great but again maybe explain the there is actual scotch in the butter scotch sauce. 

The lunch program offers a prefix for $22. Pretty cool but be very carful how you substitute items. It was my fault and I was not paying close enough attention to the server when she explained it to me. So my prefix ended up costing $38. Not a big deal but I wasn&#39;t expecting it.

I will be back like I have for many years. I love a good meal no matter how much it costs!"

The food:

Mussels: Super large, delicious and meaty.  Yum.
Hamachi Crudo: A little much on the plate, but the hamachi was delicious
Foie Gras Donut: I mean, it&#39;s Foie Gras.  And a donut.  Really delicious, honestly, though the donut was a bit stiff and truly unnecessary.
Pork meatballs: Tender and cheesy.
Mac &amp; Cheese: With Beecher&#39;s Cheddar.  Lucious and delicious.  Kids really enjoyed this one.
Entre special (Halibut):  Wrapped in beet leaves, tender and delicious...  a bit under seasoned.

Definitely would go back, but have to say that dishes weren&#39;t the most &#34;memorable&#34;.  Really credible, delicious and served with grace, but had to consult the menu to write this review - other restaurants we went to this week won&#39;t require that..."

Black Truffle Popcorn, $7 (prob not worth the price, but it was a decent size bowl)

Heritage Bacon Deviled Eggs, $6 (large and runny, but your typical deviled egg)
Mac &amp; Cheese, $7 (a must have! Creamy shell macaroni made with Beechers cheese)
Juicy mini Burgundy sliders which made me long for a bigger version! (you couldn&#39;t taste the cherry, but the bacon marmalade and the brie made this burger perfect for a decedent snack)

For instance, the cheeseburger is on the happy hour menu and it&#39;s the same price as on their full price dinner menu. 

Drinks were fine, the Chicken/Gnocci dish was way over salted.  The French onion soup was solid and the steaks the rest of my party had were solid.  Ended up with the Seattle Fire Department entering with masks on to check out the kitchen.   Honestly, I&#39;d give them maybe 1 more star if they just fix their online menu.

I&#39;m hesitant in writing this review, because there wasn&#39;t really anything blatantly wrong with the service or food that I can point to that I specifically disliked. However, there wasn&#39;t anything unique or particularly innovative about this restaurant either. 

The best way I can begin to describe it is that it feels almost &#34;corporate&#34;? As if a marketing team sat down and posited, &#34;What does the American public like to see in trendy restaurants?&#34; Maybe I&#39;m biased with the location - downtown Seattle in the shopping district hardly inspires a lot of heart or truly local, non-chain/corporate dining options. Or maybe it&#39;s the lack of cohesiveness of the menu...I couldn&#39;t quite figure out if this restaurant is trying to focus on seafood, or pasta, or any particular focus other than &#34;trendy, modern American&#34;.

For appetizers, we tried the black truffle popcorn and Taylor Shellfish oysters. Both were excellent. I had the celery root entree (not currently on the menu; I believe we visited in October 2015). The food was certainly tasty, but not exemplary or surprising. The restaurant itself was nicely decorated with warm lighting and large, comfortable leather booths. Almost recalls a speakeasy feel. It was pretty loud when we were there, so probably not ideal for an intimate dinner. 

Overall, I would try RN74 if you are already in the area (shopping or working in the heart of downtown Seattle), but I wouldn&#39;t venture very far to try this place. The food and service here are solid, but you can certainly find better options in a city that loves good food as much as Seattle does."

Walked into the establishment around 10. Ordered the liver parfait, mushroom risotto and a nice bottle of burgundy. Long story short the liver was served with moldy challah bread.  The server apologized profusely and replaced it about 5 mins later with fresh bread. Said it was new sous chef that wasn&#39;t up to snuff. Anyway, what really bothers me is that they didn&#39;t comp the dish, charged me full price for less than full price experience. Smaller establishments have done greater things when customer experience is compromised and RN74 didn&#39;t think it necessary. If they couldn&#39;t get toasted bread right I&#39;m wondering about the quality of other ingredients. Needless to say, this place has fallen off my list."

Food came out fairly quick and it was a little early for a Friday HH. Bartender wasn&#39;t the friendliest guy, but he was helpful.

I liked the selection of wine, my choice complemented the steak very well. And the beignets were served with a creamy sauce-so warm and soft. Delicious! The only thing I was not fond of was the cappuccino...it didn&#39;t seem creamy enough and too foamy. However, service was good! Staff were attentive and friendly.

This is an incredibly upscale restaurant that delivers excellent customer service and exquisite dining experience. Worth the price. The ambiance is absolutely beautiful--it has darker lighting that creates a romantic atmosphere so it is great for a first date. It is dubbed a french restaurant, however they serve German dishes such as wiener schniztel, and American food such as Steak &amp; Frites. Seattle needs more Michael Mina restaurants if his others are anything similar to RN74. 

What we ordered:
Appetizers:
- Heritage Pork Meatballs
- Mac &#39;n Cheese

Main Course:
- Tails &amp; Trotters Pork Schnitzel, Grilled Wenatchee Plums, Frisee, Mustard
- RN74 Steak Frites

Dessert
- Hand Cut Beignets

Everything above was absolutely delicious. I had never paired plums with Pork Schnitzel before, but it was a delicious combination of sweetness with some salty meat. Very tasteful. The pork schnitzel was cook to perfection and was very hydrated and fresh with a crispy breaded outter layer. The mac &#39;n cheese was also very good, even though it was considered an &#34;accompaniment&#34; rather than an actual appetizer. It was large enough to be shared as an appetizer with the 4 of us who shared dinner together. 

The waiter was very helpful in selecting a beverage to accompany our meal. However, he was a bit slow in refilling our drink beverages. I asked for a second chardonnay and he never gave it to me. I cancelled the second beverage order and he apologized. He had exceptional service otherwise. It was a Friday night and he must have been busy.

The only other gripe I would have about this restaurant is the price. it is VERY expensive 4 of us split the bill and it was still close to $100 a person. While this is a great place, it is not budget friendly. Splurge and enjoy!"

I spent a total of $198 for 3 appetizers (Tuna Tartare, 2 Clam Chowder Soups), 1 entree (King Crab Pot Pie), 2 Additions (Duck Fat Fries and Beecher&#39;s Mac&amp;Cheese), 2 pomogranite lemonades, 1 diet coke, and the Tiramisu dessert.  (we don&#39;t drink, so no review on the cocktails).

Food Taste (in order of delivery):

1.  Bread Service - We got 2 black truffle bread rolls with a ricotta and honey side (instead of butter).  By far the best rolls I&#39;ve ever eaten in my life.  These are included with dinner, so be sure to enjoy them.

2.  The Tuna Tartare - Excellent dish with really fresh tuna.  The chef did a great job of making sure it wasn&#39;t too fish-y and the pine nut additions were very welcome.  This dish was served with a side of finely cut italian bread toast.  Worth $23?  Probably not, as the portion was small, but delicious nonetheless. 

3&amp;4.  The 2 Clam Chowder Soups - These were prepared with fresh clams and clam frittes.  The soup (liquid) part of the soup was poured at the table over the fresh clams and clam frittes.  Very nice presentation, and a very tasty soup to say the least.

5. The King Crab Pot Pie - Extremely flavorful butter/cream sauce with grilled onions and vegetables as a side.  It is served with a wonderfully puffy/flaky pot pie top, and layered with fresh crab legs.  The crab legs themselves were wonderfully cooked to perfection without a hint of chewyness.

6. The Duck Fat Fries - Amazing amazing amazing.  Come day or night, definitely order these.  The flavor in these fries are by far the best I have come across.

7.  The Beecher&#39;s Mac&amp;Cheese - Average.  Nothing special here, especially if you&#39;ve eaten at Beecher&#39;s before.  The only difference is that Beecher&#39;s uses Penne, and RN74 uses Shells for pasta.

8.  The Tiramisu - Caution:  This is a deconstructed Tiramisu, with all of the components served on a plate with a hint of ice cream.  Very delicious, but certainly not classic tiramisu.  Try it, you won&#39;t be disappointed (unless of course you&#39;re expecting spongy finger cake and icing...because that&#39;s not what you&#39;ll get).

Try the pomogranite lemonade - not very sweet, and just the right amount of bitterness.

The Service:

SUPER SLOW.  2.5 hours for dinner is somewhat ridiculous, (arrived at 830, left at 1050).  It took a good 15min between courses, and even slower to get the waiter&#39;s attention.  Definitely didn&#39;t feel like $200 service, although the valet parking was a nice touch.

The waiter himself was very polite and courteous, but I think he was being over-worked as it took forever to get anything (10min for a diet coke??  Come on guys...)

Conclusion:

Great food by taste, but the service was seriously lacking.  Everyone was polite, but it definitely wasn&#39;t something I was impressed with.  I think if this restaurant is on your bucket list, attend a nice dinner here by all means, but otherwise, there are better &#34;high-end&#34; restaurants in both taste and service."

We started off with a foamy concoction that I would&#39;ve never guessed to be potato soup underneath.  It was literally bubble puffs on top of the soup with red chilli pepper sprinkled across the centre.  Tbh, it didn&#39;t look or taste very appetizing upon my first mouthful of foam.. but following that, the potato broth underneath was delicious.

Then we moved onto ahi tuna tartare with crispy white bread on the side.  There was corn and some kind of herb mixed with it, it tasted... fresh.  Nothing special, but I guess that&#39;s good enough for me when it comes to tartare.

THEN THE BREAD CAME.  With truffle oil, this soft, slightly crispy coated bread as a side made me die and go to carb heaven.  I probably could&#39;ve finished 3 more baskets of those; it could be the truffle oil, but the bread itself was just magical.

We then got the tolenas farm quail; it was served with tokyo turnip, king trumpet mushroom, and it was stuffed with minced pork if I remember correctly.  The tokyo turnip.. I was not a fan because I found it a tad too bitter.  The stuffed quail, however, was absolutely delicious with whatever sauce they served it with.  So tender and exploding with flavour, mhmmmmmm.   

After the tuna, hand cut fettuccine was served with parmesan cheese and bits of some kind of protein.. cannot quite remember which, but I LOVED it.  It was served in a small portion as expected for a tasting menu item, but nonetheless it was one of the smoothest, lightest, and most flavour-infused fettuccine I&#39;ve had.  11/10.

We wrapped up our dinner with the beignets, served with scotch syrup.  These French fritters coated with a pretty layer of sugar made me believe in desserts again.  It was my first time having this type of fritter - which is not too doughy and soft just the right amount.  I had this with a scotch lover, and these beignets stole the heart of even someone without a sweet tooth.  Thaaaaat&#39;s how good they were.  

The ambiance is great for a fancier dinner out, either with your friends or other half.  The service was outstanding; our waitress was attentive and different servers explained all the dishes that we had as part of the tasting menu.  Loved this restaurant :)"

The bar is central to the restaurant and it&#39;s u-shaped around the bartender. The bartender was so busy, I felt bad for her, but it was prime lunch rush and she couldn&#39;t get to me for a while.
I had the bacon deviled eggs and the tri-tip tacos. It wasn&#39;t a ton of food, but it was obviously well done and I really enjoyed it. The fact that it was not filling, I actually expected. I went for the experience, not to get massive portions!
The deviled eggs were particularly good. They were creative with the crisped and pickled shallots, and made them a memorable dish. However, the tri tip tacos, were nothing special compared to most Mexican fare I&#39;ve had. But to be fair, it was delicious, each ingredient was thoughtful and well done, but it didn&#39;t strike me as creative. 
I will definitely be back for an intimate dinner or date night. The low lighting and cushioned booths would make for a nice evening."

A group of us decided to try and get a reservation on the last day of restaurant week. We got a late reservation and made plans to come. 

Pros:
They have valet right out front. 
Great atmosphere and vibe to the place.
The food was good.  Everyone loved the duck fat fries, a must order, so is the ahi tuna appetizer. Personally I thought my halibut was on the salty side, but I was the only one at the table with that opinion. 

Cons:
Our waitress was the opposite of friendly, even rude at times. I did not see her smile once, unless she was talking to other wait staff. 
We ordered a bottle of wine, when it came out to try nobody at the table liked it. We were told we could get another bottle because they sell this one by the glass as well and they will use it. We asked for a recommendation and he brought out a very nice bottle. Problem with the situation is that not once did he mention the price, and the price was more than double what our original bottle was. Normally when picking recommendations for the table they should stay in the same price range, or at the very least mention the price change. We enjoyed the bottle so we did not bring it up, we only noticed when we got the bill."

Our wine took more than 30 minutes to come out on non-busy night. We saw the glasses sit at the bar, yet our server kept ignoring them. Finally a different server saw us looking and brought them over.

The server was extremely pushy about ordering certain food. We told her we don&#39;t want clam chowder, yet she insisted and brought it (yes, it was on the bill). 

The entrees we ordered were good, but nothing special. I got the crab and my husband got a fish dish.

The server insisted we get desert even though we were full. She claimed the ice cream was amazing. We were unable to finish it - it tasted like bad, stale grocery store ice cream. She did not bother to ask why we barely touched it. 

Overall, not a great experience. There are much better places, with better food and better customer service in Seattle area for same price."

Food, wine selection, service (Matthew), was all...outstanding. Given that this was Restaurant Week in Seattle, maybe they do things differently? But I am not complaining. The wine selection is a great mix of local and imported wines and the resident sommelier has done a phenomenal job of selecting and pairing wines with the meal. I know tastes between wine and food can be highly individualistic, but this was one of the best pairings to MY palate that I&#39;ve ever experienced. For food, everything we tried was outstanding: butter lettuce salad, steak tartare, coq au vin, steak frites (with duck-fat frites), and their respective wine choices. Smaller portions, so if you&#39;re looking for abundance, this is not your place. If you like being comfortably satisfied and not over stuffed, then RN 74 is perfect.

Food:
Mediocre, at best.  The sliders were these tiny little things with just bread, bbq sauce, and patty.  I mean, even McDonald&#39;s offers more flavorful sauces and accompaniments than that.  

Mac n cheese tasted like Kraft&#39;s Mac n cheese that came out of a box.

Ahi tuna poppers were ok.

Duck fat fries were dry and slightly burnt or the oil was really old.

The fried oyster lettuce cups were actually decent, with a hint of yuzu in the dressing, which counterbalanced the heaviness of the fried oysters. 

Service:
The hostess was friendly.  However, one of the bartenders was inattentive and too bad for us that we sat at the bar.

I think I&#39;ll stick to Michael&#39;s San Francisco restaurants, seems like he&#39;s not really quality controlling this location....."

We could&#39;ve gotten in at 7 or 8 when we stopped by but we were offered the communal table. My fellow girlie gorilla and I weren&#39;t prettified and dressed to impress our men so we declined. 

Our hostess was very professional but warm. Coat checked. The walk to our table was for me very revealing of the service and level of food served here. I&#39;ll explain below. 

The main dining room in the back seemed to be the most coveted spot. It was arranged with tables for couples side by side and surrounded by four tops. Intimate. Cozy feeling but by no means crowded. We sat in the four top with our friends. Very good choice of table. Again I credit our concierge.

The Valentines dinner Pre fixe menu was amazing. The five course meal with two dessert was to me perfect. Well thought and absolutely delicious and plated very well. 

I absolutely love the Chateubriand For Two and Lobster Pot Pie ( Red kuri and spaghetti squash. Brandied lobster cream). Although everything was mouth watering. 

The lovely written card from the staff was very thoughtful. The service was excellent. Although a little problem or big it depends on how anal you are with your wine.  Explain to me Mr. Sommelier. A bottle of red wine of our choosing instead of their pairing wasn&#39;t decanted. At $95/bottle it would probably have tasted way better if so. Or maybe an aerator? We saw a table with a decanter. So what&#39;s the deal? I feel like it&#39;s not a big problem but it needs to be addressed I think.

Why didn&#39;t we say something? I&#39;m an observer of people&#39;s actions and most of the time I do exactly that and seldom return any food or make comments on food unless it&#39;s horribly wrong. So there.

It was overall a lovely night. Great company and it&#39;s a few blocks walk to our hotel.

There are tables in front. The communal table was empty when we walked in and on the way out there was only a couple. So that might be a last minute choice if you&#39;re pressed for time and really need to impress your favorite person."

We had the tasting menu hoping to taste the best they had to offer. If this was the best, I will not be returning. The food was disgusting, oily, and horribly plated. 

But the service was what got to me. Rude and slow service is an understatement. I don&#39;t usually write reviews, but no one should be swindled like we did, especially at this price point. 

Avoid at all costs."

I loved how when I got a flight of riesling&#39;s I got a full story of where each wine came from, as well as what flavors to expect. The food was also great! We got two small plates per person, and that was just enough for us! The only downside (and it could be because we went late on a weeknight) was that it was a little slow on service, but overall, I was a big fan, and would totally come back!"

I hadn&#39;t been in a rush to try this Michael Mina spot because as a native San Franciscan, I was familiar with various MM restaurants back home. But what a shame it took so long because this was a lovely experience!

Crowded even at 5:30, my friend and I got a seat at a table without a reservation. Already off to a good start!

The space itself is romantic and cozy and upscale without being stuffy. It&#39;s a great atmosphere whether you are dressed up or wearing your typical Seattle hoodie and jeans. 

Tableside service was phenomenal as well.  We happened to mention we were seeing a show at the Paramount theater and they made sure to help us keep time and bring us the bill as soon as we finished. Very thoughtful! 

We shared a crispy fish entree and a venison entree, both were stellar. Portions were not comparable to say, The Outback, but for the price, I&#39;m actually paying for not just better quality, but a reasonable serving amount. Split between the two of us we shared an appetizer (the deviled eggs are a must!) and two entrees, plus two cocktails. My bill after tip? Exactly $70! Brilliant. Better yet, we were stuffed!

So are will you need a doggy bag or to go container? Likely not. But the beauty there is that you don&#39;t disappoint yourself by either forgetting it on the table (I always do that!) or taking it home to eat it the next day only to realize you&#39;re not a chef or an expert and the food was good in the restaurant served fresh. So sure, portions are &#34;small&#34; but they&#39;re actually not. They&#39;re appropriate and they delicious and they&#39;re plenty. Trust me! Any more food and you&#39;d have to eat out less frequently not because of the money but because of your waistline. 

The only part that wasn&#39;t great was trying to decide what to eat. All appetizers and entrees looked drool worthy. The menu was well rounded with great veggie options, red meat, game meat, fish, and pasta. Maine Lobster mac n cheese? Yeah, I&#39;ll be ordering that next time!

The small serving of black truffle buttered rolls was great too. 

Preferring to use the facilities here than risk going at the Paramount, I was so glad to see hooks on the wall for my jacket and purse. Nothing worse tha having to put your things on the floor. 

Michael Mina has thought of everything and here&#39;s it&#39;s executed flawlessly. I&#39;ll be back soon for that mac n cheese."

We got a couple of drinks, which were well-made. Nothing crazy here. I had a Tanqueray and tonic and my wife had some red wine. Both tasted good. Bartender seemed a little overwhelmed when the place was half full, so I was happy I was there when it wasn&#39;t any more crowded.

The food was a standout here. The ahi tuna tartar was amazing. My wife raved about it the entire trip. We split the cheeseburger, which was incredible. I&#39;m usually a fan of the &#34;smashed&#34; double-patty cheeseburger but this was plump, juicy and delicious.

Overall, I think this place would be five stars but the staff seemed flustered. They seemed to be stressed out and taking their stress out on each other a bit. Not a big deal though. Overall I think this is a great place for a quick lunch. Great atmosphere, good food. Not sure I&#39;d come back for dinner, though, given so many other options in the area."

Although, I saw the happy hour menu, and the one in the restaurant is more expensive than the one posted online. An annoying bait and switch, even if it is only a few dollars.

The 2 drinks we got were ok, but they sounded more interesting than they actually tasted. I wished we had just walked a little farther to zig zag, or another place. The full priced cocktails weren&#39;t worth it in my opinion -- a $12 (plus tip and tax) drink better rock my world.

Rn74 is a must do.  We will definitely return.

Date night on a Saturday night.  We ordered the menu degustation.  A five course tasting menu.  We Chose the grand pairing; obscure and rare wines, including a fantastic white burgundy, that was well worth the extra $20 per person.

Each course was exquisite in presentation and execution.  The first course of scallop and fois gras is a keeper.  I Normally don&#39;t like fois gras due to a liver aversion but this dish was so perfectly paired all flavors melded together.

The only complaint was that the first course was delivered before the wine pairing.  A profuse apology was offered.

The evening was topped by an extra course of oven fresh,steaming hot madelines accompanied by a passion fruit cream.  I would return just to have this dish as a stand alone.  We lived in France for 3 years and these were by far the best madelines we had e er eaten."

First off, this place is freakin cute! I absolutely love the vibe of this place, especially the part that resembles an old airport board. You know, the kind where all the letters change? We came in for lunch and were seated in a corner booth that was absolutely perfect for two friends to catch up over lunch. Another thing I loved was that they offer a prix fixe menu which allows you to sample a multitude of items. They also offer all of the items a la carte and have a small appetizer menu that you can sub in as your first course for a small up charge. The food we ordered was A-MAZING! I started with a butternut squash soup with cinnamony croutons and I basically licked the bowl. If our waiter hadn&#39;t come and swapped it out for the cheeseburger at exactly the right moment, I might have actually licked it. Thinking back, I wish I had. It was damn good! The burger was one of the best I&#39;ve had in Seattle, maybe the best. You can add bacon or a fried egg or seared foie gras for an up charge, which gives you some options. That came with duck fat fries, which were yummy, but they&#39;re served already dipped it ketchup, which is weird. I&#39;d ask for them on the side in the future. Though, the ketchup is really delightful! It has pickle juice which gives it the extra pizzazz to make it completely delicious. There was also a side salad, which was mostly just a way to distract you from the fact that you&#39;re eating duck fat fries and a cheeseburger...with bacon. The friend subbed in the tartare as her first course and I&#39;m so glad she did! I got to try a bite and I&#39;d definitely eat it any time, any place. So good! She had the fish and chips, which she said was good, but wasn&#39;t super crispy. She was ok with that though, because it was scrumptious! We ordered the beignets and the cream puff and both were amazing, but the cream puff was better. Thinking about all of the deliciousness while I type is making my mouth water!

We also had booze and the drinks were well made. I had something with gin and sparkling wine that was a nice accompaniment with the heavy (but awesome) meal and she had a cucumbery moscow mule that was refreshing - I admit I was a little jealous of her pick even though mine was good.

The service is on point, the food is perfection, the price is worth it. Bottom line, I work across the street. If it takes me more than a few weeks to come back, something is terribly, terribly wrong."

Its not a super fancy restaurant, but its also not super casual! Ive always driven or walked past this restaurant, never even thought about trying this place out, until one day, a friend mentioned it. 

We had a taylor shellfish geoduck as appetizer. That definitely did not disappoint, and matter of fact, turned out amazingly delicious! We also had the duck fat fries. It had the taste to it, but I could just skip it and be just fine.

As a main entree, we had the halibut. We were just going to split it, but amazingly enough, they brought out two plates, already split for us! What Great service! The halibut, was by far, one of the best ones I have tasted anywhere. It was made perfectly! Every bite of it was good! I was really impressed!

Pricing wise, its more on the upscale of things, but the food was good, so it definitely was worth the price. I would come again, and try other things on the menu!

The service is always very good but I think that the wine list is generally overpriced and also without offering enough moderately priced options.

I had the escargot (nothing particularly exciting about it) and the steak. My potatoes were very bland. I think our bill (with wine) was close to $200 and I wished we had gone to El Gaucho (comparable price but better steak and wine selection) or Le Pichet (best French food in town) instead."

I went here on a Thursday for Happy Hour around 4:30 pm. 

The bar was packed but there was a ton of empty seats in the sitting area, however all of them were reserved. My friend and I walked around and around the restaurant twice before anyone greeted us. We asked for any possible seats since there was a ton of empty tables but were rejected. Luckily 2 seats at the bar finally opened up. 

*Drinks: Vodka-Ginger-Ale: awesome 

The bartenders were nice and not overly chatty. 

*Food: 

**Duck Fat Fries: crispy, nicely salted and served with 3 sauces which paired well with the flavor of the fries. 

**Oysters on the shell: ordered the half dozen. They were cleaned well and tasted fresh. 

**Steak skewers: The skewers are garnished with a bitter cilantro. Overall, overdone, chewy and needed flavor.  

**Smoked salmon deviled eggs: were very tasty. I liked the yolk to white ratio but I am partial to yolk, the more the better and they did that well. 

But of these, I recommend the fries. I don&#39;t know where you can find fries like this any where else in Seattle. The other foods, I think can be experienced elsewhere and you won&#39;t miss out. 


I will be going back to RN74 to try the rest of the HH items and for their main menu items.

They seemed to melt into the woodwork as soon as a course was delivered. No single wait person was capable of carrying more than a single dish at a time. This was especially painful as we watched the service at the table for 8 guests, next to us. When we complained, they tried to offer us more food and butter us up with a dessert. All we wanted to do was leave, and we requested our check. Like I said, the food was OKAY, but that was canceled out by the service.

The interior of the restaurant certainly corroborates that theory. It&#39;s stylish, yet rustic, upscale yet approachable and identifiable. The word that comes to mind is &#34;warm.&#34; I feel very warm here. 

Now, on to the food! We ordered oysters as an appetizer. Delicious. My entree was a pork chop with polenta on the side. The portion size was extraordinarily generous as the dish came with a little side car of the extra polenta that did not fit into the beautiful plating. I was floored by how nicely the pork was cooked and the creaminess and decadence of the polenta! My conception of polenta dates back to when I was a child and my mom purchased those sausage like packages of polenta that she would pan-fry. This polenta was not that. This was heavenly spiced, rich, and oh so satisfying! Since my visit to RN74, I have tried to recreate that dish, and have new found appreciation for how difficult it is to make polenta so appetizing. My local grocer sure has made a pretty penny off my frequent polenta purchases due to numerous botched attempts!

My boyfriend ordered the scallops, which he truly enjoyed. However, the portion size was laughable compared to my generous pork chop (this is often a concern when ordering scallops in many restaurants). So he inevitably ate half my food. 

For dessert, we shared a creme brulee which was fantastic. Can&#39;t go wrong there. 

Despite the slightly disappointing scallop portion size and the overall expense of the night, we had a great time at RN74. The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the food and drinks and the ambiance was fantastic. I will definitely return next time I&#39;m in town."

The chicken fried steak I had here was a delight - it&#39;s probably the best I&#39;ve had in years. Perfect amount of seasoning, ratio of breading to meat, not overcooked so the steak is still juicy, not greasy, and with a homemade country gravy just the right consistency to not be gloopy but not make things soggy so you still get that satisfying crunch with each bite. I don&#39;t really know how this could be done better.

On top of that, I asked for poached eggs and they came out perfect, with a solid whites and a runny center. The hashbrowns were that delightful mix of crispy browned bits on top of softer smooth potato. The coffee was good enough that I drank it black. The only improvement I could make would be a better assortment of jams for the toast, but that&#39;s a pretty minor issue (they just had smuckers plastic packs of orange, strawberry, and grape - perfectly serviceable if pretty plain).

Overall, would eat here again anytime I was in the area."

Honestly, I haven&#39;t been to the Shanty since I worked next door in the early 2000&#39;s, but it&#39;s a place that&#39;s close to my heart.  As a kid, my Dad used to take us on weekends to visit with longtime owner Jackie Philbrick.  This is where I learned to love corned beef hash, chicken fried steak and patty melts.  A place where every customer was treated like a dear friend.  Very saddened to hear it will be a Mexican chain restaurant.

It is a tiny place with a few tables inside, and a small open patio along Elliott Ave.

The decor here is pretty old and dated, with things falling apart. The booth I sat at was rickety, and the seat kept rocking back and forth. It is a pretty cramped joint, with little space between tables.

The service is very friendly. It seems to be family-owned, and the service is very homely. The servers check on your often, and food comes out quick.

The food is decent, nothing to rave about, but not bad either. I got a burger and my friend got a fried chicken and gravy entree. My burger was alright, but had tons of veggies that I enjoyed. My friend said his chicken and gravy was pretty good, but the hash browns were burnt. The prices are good for the neighborhood, around $9-12 for the entrees.

Overall, it is an okay place. I wouldn&#39;t recommend making a trip to go here, but if you happen to be here, give it a try, and don&#39;t keep many expectations."

Hollandaise on eggs Benedict Florentine was flavorless, lacking any hint of lemon. English muffin was not toasted and so tasted mealy.  Tomato was chopped, rather than sliced, which means that any off piece pollutes the entire dish (which it did). Hash browns were also mealy, lacking any crispness.

I couldn&#39;t be happier we did! Somehow I&#39;d NEVER noticed this place, but The Shanty Cafe is really the perfect name; it&#39;s definitely a shanty. It&#39;s a super dive-y place, very unpretentious and not fancy.  But if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for, this is your place.

I decided to try the Mexicali frittata. I never order frittatas, but this one was delicious. Eggs, cheese, tomato, olives, with salsa &amp; sour cream on the the side. Normally, there is beef as well, but I asked to avoid that part. It came with hash browns &amp; toast (I had the English muffin) and everything was great. The hash browns weren&#39;t too soft or too crispy, but just right - and the ketchup dispenser actually dispensed the ketchup easily! 

My coffee was good &amp; kept refilled as needed. One of our friends ordered a mimosa which was fairly big and came with blueberries &amp; grapefruit. I didn&#39;t have any but she and her husband seemed to like it. 

All of us were really happy with our food; the only (minor) issue is that we had a baby with us and because of how small the place is, we couldn&#39;t use a high chair &amp;  had to leave the (folded up) stroller outside to save space. They did give us a booster seat for her, which worked just fine, but it was rather cramped overall which could get annoying with a big party."

The same goes for their Eggs Benedict - the hollandaise even tastes homemade! I&#39;ve never left here feeling gross and greasy - just full of delicious (and yes, fatty) foods.

The Shanty Cafe is a little local divey-diner. I ordered a simple breakfast of eggs, hash browns, and toast. It wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t anything to note either. You really can&#39;t mess that up. My husband ordered the Monday special: Smoked sausage and eggs. He thought the sausage was essentially just a hot dog fried in a pan, which is what it looked like, but I could taste the subtle polish-like flavor. 

We both also ordered a hot chocolate based on other Yelper photos, and were disappointed when they came out. They had a little whipped cream, and a few mini marshmallows. They did NOT come out piled high with marshmallows and whipped cream, drizzled in chocolate sauce. Not that we needed it, but those pictures made them look pretty tasty. Did we order the wrong ones?

Omelettes, eggs Benedict, eggs every other way, bacon, toast, hash browns(shredded), waffles, pancakes, french toast, grits etc..  Y&#39;know breakfast.
Hot sauce is Cholula or Tapatio
Jam is Smucker&#39;s strawberry, grape, raspberry.
Coffee is good
If you want vegan buckwheat, quinoa  tofu pancakes then look elsewhere.  If you want blueberries in your pancakes then you might be in luck.

It gets five stars for being exactly what it&#39;s supposed to be.  You can eat for less than a ten or  eat blueberry pancakes, eggs, bacon coffee and spend $15

We have a great menu, and innovative weekend specials!&#34; A diner in every sense of the word, the Shanty offers American style breakfasts, sandwiches, burgers and salads sure to provide a days worth of calories and more - in just one meal.

Ambiance: A little shack of an establishment on the outside, the wood paneled interior walls say it all! Dingy, drab, mismatched, yet full of simple diner pleasures from the 1950s make the Shanty a place to which locals return, a place where everybody really does know your name. 

What I ordered: For me, the Supreme Hash Browns ($10.25) with bacon, cheese, onions &amp; peppers served with toast (English muffins) and eggs, two over-medium. For my husband the Chicken Fried Steak ($10.25) served with eggs, country gravy, hash browns and toast (rye), as well as a side of two slices of French Toast ($4.25 per slice). My two cousins each enjoyed an Old Fashioned Hamburger with cheese ($7.75 each) made with mayo, lettuce, tomato, relish &amp; onion and served with fries. The last two in our party, selected the Grilled Ham &amp; Cheese ($7.50) with potato salad, and the Popeye Fritata ($9.75) with bacon, fresh spinach, eggs &amp; swiss with hash browns and toast (English muffin).

What I loved: Fries. French Toast. Buttered, toasty English muffins.

Why I loved it: Diner food. Salt, grease, carb load to last the rest of the day.

Cost: Low to average ($7.25 - $11.25 per breakfast/lunch entree)"

We stopped by on a Friday morning, hoping to soak up some sun outside in their patio area. They don&#39;t open the patio on Friday&#39;s though, just weekends! Only thing that sucked. 

Once inside, the place is tiny! But it&#39;s cute and homey. The service is nice and the food is delicious. I had the Hot Mess or something like that, it was basically a hash brown platter mixed with like sausage, egg and other breakfast things. It was really good. My cousin had their chicken and waffles which were heavenly. Their coffee is also some of the best coffee I  have had, I must have had like 6 cups in my sitting.

I would definitely recommend Shanty Cafe, and hope to come back when I visit Seattle again."

I came here expecting this to be the best breakfast in the NW, at least from what I was reading on the reviews,  but I feel like we all need to expand our breakfast horizons just a little further because this was NOT okay. 

I had French Toast Combo and it just looked like soggy bread. My hubby had the blueberry (extra $2) (one) waffle combo and the blueberries looked like they came straight from the can and the waffle was so soggy. On top of that,  he took one bite and couldn&#39;t eat anymore because he said it was so bland and just straight watery.

The waitress was really nice though so that was a positive aspect."

I read on the menu that The Shanty opened in 1914.  Wow!  Even more impressive in a city whose foodscape nearly blurs with the number of restaurants that don&#39;t stand the test of time.  I love how it stands on its own in a little triangle off of Elliott.  

Cool ambiance and very casual.  Nothing pretentious, just a counter with barstools in the center of a room full of maybe a dozen tables or more.  The notable star here is the waitress.  Unfortunately I didn&#39;t catch her name but you can see her in days gone by in photos on the wall.  She&#39;s awesome.  Really friendly and genuine.  They seated us right away on a Sunday at 11 AM even though it was far from empty.  

Partner ordered the clam strips and fries, while I indulged in a burger with fries.  They don&#39;t ask you how you like your burger here so you may have to ask if you want it other than well done, which is what I should have done.  The fries are very greasy and we only at a few of them because we were hungry.  The burger was good but nothing to make it stand out like Jak&#39;s or Circa.  The clam strips were great!  I think I robbed him of half his clams but I &#34;rewarded&#34; him with a quarter of my burger.  Because the overall mood and hospitality of this place left us happy after we walked out the door, I like to think we&#39;ll be back to try some breakfast items.  Prices are on point.  This is more of a 3.5 star review which I took down from 4 because of the fries and the uninspired sandwich."

We were starting to get hangry and I knew that if we didn&#39;t make a pit stop somewhere, anywhere, to put something in our growling stomachs our drive home would not end pretty. Did a quick Yelp search, saw the Shanty was nearly across the street from where we were, saw the high reviews and thought, BINGO. 

Service was very friendly. Hubby had the chicken fried steak (OMG the white gravy. I could have had a bowl of that alone). I had the french toast--I originally wanted pancakes but they stop serving them at 11 am (boo!). But that&#39;s ok. It hit the spot and was exactly what I wanted (it came with bacon and two eggs). 

We each ordered coffee, and the server was on point with the constant refills; however I do remember looking at our bill and thinking &#39;wow, that&#39;s pricey for drip coffee...&#34; I can&#39;t remember exactly, but it seemed like the coffee alone for the both of us increased our bill by about $4-$5. If this matters, or if you&#39;re on a shoestring (student) budget, make sure you carefully check the prices for coffee on the menu. But that&#39;s kind of to be expected. When the regular food items are inexpensive then usually that means the beverage prices are jacked higher. 

The interior is cozy and very casual, and it&#39;s street parking. This is working class blue collar grubs and it&#39;s pretty awesome. Will eventually make our way back if or when we&#39;re in the area again!"

Typical diner setting: booths and counter seating. I sat down, ordered a Garden Omelette with ham, and picked up my book. My plate arrived within five minutes! Hot sauce was already at hand, so my omelette was all set. Would recommend if you&#39;re looking for a diner experience in Queen Anne."

And the name always catches my eye as I drive by this place on my way to work. About time to try it out, it seemed. Well, it&#39;s not too impressive. They certainly were right about the shanty part. But it does have a modest appearance. It&#39;s located on a street that gets a ton of traffic, but they don&#39;t seem to do much to make themselves stand out. But that&#39;s okay. Inside, there were a bunch of posters in French; I&#39;m not sure what kind of theme they&#39;re going for here.

Anyway, I ordered a honey-braised fried chicken. It was pretty good, although I was disappointed with how it only came with three pieces of fried chicken: breast, thigh, and wing. The skin tasted like it was fried in honey, but the rest of the meat was just normal delicious fried chicken like the kind you get at fast food restaurants or the deli section of a supermarket. I also enjoyed the hash browns that came with it, but they&#39;re nothing without ketchup!

The bill for this came to $11.28 before tip. That&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s a bit of a letdown considering how much more chicken comes in a bucket for the same price at a fast food restaurant. I guess I just would have liked some more. Also, the waitress, while helpful, seemed less than thrilled about doing her job. I can&#39;t blame her, but I&#39;m used to the servers at restaurants being in a more uplifting mood. Not a bad place by any means, but it could do better."

Parking in front of the restaurant is dangerous due to the speeding traffic and busy street that is Elliott Ave.  I would recommend parking on 3rd or Washington.

The food was ok, but not on par with the price point in my opinion.  

I got the sausage omelet with toast and hashbrowns.  There wasn&#39;t more than sausage and cheese in the omelet but the eggs were buttery which I liked.  $8.75+tax and tip...I  could&#39;ve found something better for that price.

I had the biscuits and gravy and my boyfriend had pancakes. The food tasted pretty low quality and left us both feeling the bad kind of food coma the rest of the day. The coffee was cheap and watery. 

The service was fast, albeit too fast, no frills no chit chat - git &#39;er done and out as quick as possible. I think we stayed approximately 20 minutes start to finish. I think this speaks for itself. It&#39;s charming in maybe a rememberance of diners past way I suppose."

I enjoyed the eggs Benedict the sauce is what I&#39;m usually picky about, but they nailed it.

Now let me preface my review by sharing a confession.  My friend and I are Texans so we are a little discriminating when it comes to proper chicken-fried steak.

Parking was simple enough though I can imagine when it&#39;s busier, it&#39;d be difficult.  We were lucky to find a spot behind the café and walked around.  The aroma of diner food permeated everything in an inviting way and we smiled.  We grabbed a small table right by the door and the waitress came immediately over with menus.  After glancing at the menu, Both of us decided to try out the CFS because it sounded good.  

It emerged from the kitchen fairly quickly.  The steak came with mashed potatoes and green peas.  The steak was well cooked but thicker than I was accustomed.  Gravy was good but I don&#39;t know why they used a different gravy for the potatoes.  They used a brown gravy that tasted like a bland version you&#39;d have at Thanksgiving.  Peas were perfect, not over cooked or salted.  In fact, I actually used a little salt on the meal, something that I NEVER do.

After our health food, both of us wanted something sweet.  To our dismay, there was no pie or cake.  Ack!  We didn&#39;t really need the calories but the flavour craving was there.  Overall, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go back.  My curiosity has been sated and while the CFS was competent enough, it wouldn&#39;t be the driving factor for my return.  I read they do breakfast all day so maybe I&#39;d go back to see if they could earn another star..."

This place has taken a turn for the worse and it makes me so sad! I was excited to have breakfast in the old hood but wound up leaving hungry and frustrated.

I ordered the &#34;sin&#34; special of cinnamon roll french toast and subbed the veggie patty they use on the vegetarian Benedict for the bacon that came with the special (at an upcharge). 

The food arrived incredibly quickly. The first thing I noticed was that the veggie patty was like a garden burger rather than the sausage style veggie patty I expected from the breakfast menu. I guess I should have asked but I also think it was the server/owner&#39;s place to make sure I knew what I was ordering. Oh well though. I could make it work. Or so I thought. It turned out to be full of uncooked rice. Hard, inedible uncooked rice. Weird! I was going to just let it go but then I tried the French toast. It was cold! Ok, there were some warm spots but most of it was cold to the touch as if it had just come out of the refrigerator...because I guess it had. I sent the French toast back (still not mentioning the veggie patty because I felt I held some responsibility for not verifying what I was ordering). When the French Toast came back, it was the same plate that just been put in the microwave and then had some more powdered sugar sprinkled on it. It was warmer but was also now tough and dry. I was done. I sent it all back, including the veggie patty with the uncooked rice.

We asked for our check and gave the hostess our Amex card which SHE THEN RETURNED TO A DIFFERENT TABLE! Thanks for adding insult to injury by putting our financial security at risk.

That was definitely our last visit. Sad times. Sad, sad times."

The Shanty Cafe is a great way to do this. 

The Shanty is just that, it&#39;s been there for years and like a fine wine it gets better with age. Simple decor inside, friendly staff and great food. Not much more to say.

I ordered the corned beef and hash and it did not disappoint. The house made corned beef was piled high on my plate, add two eggs and toast and I was full for most of the day. Add a cup of joe and is was off into the rest of the day. Great price, great people and a great place!"

With that said, this place is no-muss no-fuss food without the pretentious decor. You want good diner/greasy spoon food? Then this is the place for you. 

My favorite thing to get from here is the taco scramble with a side of sour cream (doesn&#39;t come with it, ask for it), this comes with hash browns and choice of toast. I substitute cottage cheese for the hash browns (for which they don&#39;t charge or charge a minimal amount). The scramble is filled with tasty morsels of tomatoes, olives, onions, cheese and seasoned taco meat. Combined with sour cream, I find this to be a perfect combo. 

The prices are very reasonable especially for the portions. The service can be slow, but in my opinion, I&#39;d rather go to a place with slow service and good food, then the other way around. Parking can be a bit of a pickle, don&#39;t expect to find a spot out front, but there is plenty of street parking up the hill behind the place."

I ordered a simple breakfast, got the hash brown, 2 eggs, bacon and some bread. My boyfriend ordered the meat omelet, with potatoes and bread. Serving size was decent, and super good! Such a cute place to have breakfast at and service was also very good, to me. She checked on us from time to time and when we needed her for anything, she&#39;d come.

My go to in the morning is the Number 8. I switch between pancakes and French toast. It comes with eggs and your choice of ham or sausage you can choose either links or patty or bacon.

The friendly service still recommends this place, despite the overpriced and underwhelming food. Cleanliness, the third thing to always expect of a good diner, has slipped a notch, with food and debris on the counters, tables and floors and smears and splatters left unaddressed here and there. Don&#39;t get me wrong- the place is still decent. Just needs a detailed eye and a side work schedule looking after things. And I can&#39;t think of any restaurant in Georgetown that isn&#39;t a bit grungy, after all.

You can&#39;t compensate for lack of business by upping your prices. Get butts in the door by offering, advertising and delivering attractive specials, and make your money in low-margin, high-volume business. That&#39;s how a diner is run, and it&#39;s different from a specialty brewpub in product and routine.

Be careful- you may not be able to rely on being the only breakfast game on the Airport Strip forever. If Smarty Pants offers its excellent brunch on weekdays too, or that fellow with the music club around the corner realizes he can do a lot more with that huge space of his than stage noise and offer mysterious Cajun food randomly, you might get a run for your money.

Even your excellent waitress won&#39;t be able to fix that kind of problem. I recommend raising the bar in the kitchen and costing your menu appropriately. And for cripes sake, offer fresh biscuits! Five ingredients, handled correctly, and 25 minutes or so at 375 degrees. Not rocket science, people. Stale leftover biscuits on a $10 plate of undercooked hash browns, broken eggs over easy, and gravy is EXTRA?! For shame. There wasn&#39;t a dollar of value on that plate. The menu needs a rethink.

Again, you have that fantastic waitress, calling people &#34;Hun&#34; and keeping coffee cups perpetually full in classic diner style, to thank for three stars instead of two. Don&#39;t waste solid floor talent by offering marginal food and cleanliness along side her."

The diner had about 6 other people in the place at the time Monday, ~6:30pm. Long story short, our server (Veronica) was probably having a bad night. When she brought our food over she reached over and spilled our friends drink onto her phone (on table) and lap, our server didn&#39;t offer to clean up the spill nor gave us a rag to clean up the mess. Later we had to tell her she had billed us for food we never received. In addition to the food bill she forgot our dessert order as well which we later went else where to make up for it. Anyhow don&#39;t get me wrong the food was not bad, the diner is a bit run down (not the cleanest place), but service definitely needs improvement."

Got the half order, and did not like the gravy. Not like any other gravy I&#39;ve had on that sort of thing, and so salty it seemed like someone spilled salt in it. Also, literally barely 2 bites of turkey. I think the turkey was already in the gravy vs placing actual turkey on and topping with gravy. so I&#39;d steer clear of that. I&#39;d go back for breakfast which is all day, or something like a grilled cheese sandwich. Cute place and they were friendly. Not trying to be hipsters or anything like that.

I attempted to do a late brunch with a couple friends, and I knew that we would have a hard time finding a place that served breakfasty foods at 3 pm, but nevertheless, I was determined. I stumbled upon Square Knot on Yelp, and the reviews weren&#39;t horrible, so I sent them the address, and we agreed to meet. 

For starters, this place is pretty small. It&#39;s old, dingy, and has a very sad diner feeling instead of charming. There is quite a bit of counter seating, but maybe 5 booths total? In any case, it&#39;s small enough to warrant a complaint about how slow the service is. It took forever to get someone to take our drink orders, let alone set the table, and it was even longer to get someone to take our order. Having said that, once we did order, the food came out rather quickly. 

But, the food has much to be desired. It&#39;s crappy diner food, as long as you&#39;re okay with that. I would say it&#39;s a step down from Denny&#39;s, and that&#39;s being generous. The only somewhat appetizing menu items are the desserts. The cinnamon roll and the berry cobbler didn&#39;t look too horrifying.

There are better places in the area to brunch, obviously. And I&#39;ll go to those next time."

Charming little diner in a neighborhood experiencing a resurgence. 
Room for ~33 between the 5 booths and classic, fixed stool bar. 

Breakfast staples you would expect with the addition of some specialty Egg Benes including a nice Florentine with spinach. The special was a Chili Cheese Omelet with their &#34;famous&#34; 9lb chili. Looked really good but too much food for me this AM. I went with the combo of 2 eggs, hash browns and toast for $8.99. It was another $3.49 to add 2 sausages or 3 strips of bacon. That seems high to me. Must be special meat. I passed as I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s a value. 

The diner was serviced by one, very polite and sweet woman. Not full at this hour, the service moved along as expected and always with a smile from Christy. Kept wanting to hear the use of &#34;darl&#39;n&#34; but no luck. 

So the food. Meh. My first cup of coffee was cold, the toast was burnt and the hash browns under cooked. The eggs were fine and all made a little better the myriad of hot sauces offered. I added a little sweet and spicy with Tiger Sauce.

With three beers on tap from Georgetown Brew Co. (as expected in this hood) and a handful in the can (actual cans and not slag for the toilet), lunch may be better with a buzz on. Breakfast would have been. 

Overall, it&#39;s just fine. Nothing special other than its local and not a national chain. That makes me feel better about where my money goes. If the location is convenient then swing in but I would not make a special trip for this place. The best part was trying a new hot sauce. And for that, I thank you."

My last experience at the Square Knot included: Very, very rude and ungrateful staff, food orders delivered wrong, lack of any management or customer retention.  Seem like they let their staff run amuck and insult customers when they legitimately complain about poor service or orders that are wrong.  Then proceed to slam coffee refills on out table spilling it everywhere and walking away out of anger and spite.  Real mature staff!!!  One of the gals blamed her attitude on her pregnancy and said she was too emotional to deal with complaints.  She then turned to her table of friends hanging out two booths down and told them all about our legitimate grievances about our poor service and orders delivered wrong.  Her friends that were not employees then proceeded to make vulgar comments to us in retaliation of what the waitress told them.  It was absolutely crazy!   

It&#39;s too bad the owner doesn&#39;t get a handle on their staff.  Your limiting your success by poor employees and their behavior.

When we reached the destination, we learned that the restaurant was closed. Out came the iPhone and the decision landed on this place.

It&#39;s a straight up greasy spoon that slings comfort food, nothing fancy. The seats are comfortable with booths against the wall. There are also counter seats with ample leg room plus side-to-side space. You won&#39;t feel like you are all up on someone else if you select one of these padded swivel seats.

Our server was wonderfully patient and accommodating. He let us order off menu so we started our health food sojourn with chili cheese fries. I didn&#39;t indulge because of my dairy allergy but man, they looked amazing. We ordered one delightfully greasy patty melt on proper rye bread. The pair of grilled cheese sandwiches actually had pools of cheese on the plate after their bisection! 

Next time I go, I want to try the homemade biscuits with veggie sausage. I make the same thing at home so I&#39;d really like to know how theirs stacks up against mine. Everything that we ordered was done well and exactly as specified. If you have a sweet tooth, you should leave room for desserts. They do old school shakes, malts, sundaes, and an assortment of pie and cake. My companions ordered a pair of the vanilla shakes and they were both pleased. There&#39;s glass bottled sodas too in addition to the regular soda fountain offerings. I gotta love a place that sells Bubble-Up!

Street parking might get dicey. We were there during the week so we didn&#39;t wait long for a table or struggled to find a space around the block. Honestly the short stroll back after that meal felt nice. They are also open 24/7 if you&#39;re craving a hot turkey sandwich at 3:00!"

It&#39;s a cute retro 50s diner inside, and from the expectation of the looks, we got what we hoped for. Simple, unpretentious Americana. Also, yay for breakfast served at night.

My friend had an omelette made with cream cheese (and I forget what else in it, something like a Denver) with hash browns. Generous serving, I mean the plate was beyond full. He said the eggs were just right, and I know the browns were, because I tried some.

I had a good old standby-- basket of fries with a chocolate shake to dip them in. And it&#39;s the kind of shake where you get the extra in the metal mix glass. Also, the very sweet waitress ( who was working alone, and while not a busy night in the cafe, she was running things next door to the 9 lB Hammer which is connected through the back...and it got busy as we were finishing) asked if I wanted my shake thick or thin. Then decided on her own it was too thin still when bringing it, and when I said it was no big, she insisted and remixed it.

That&#39;s good stuff."

I went in the other night really close to closing time - sorry but I was starving after working all night. The place was actually pretty packed. My server was amazing and did everything she could to make sure my dad and I were taken care of - regretting not catching her name! 

I got a grilled cheese and a cup of chili. 
The cheese that was in the grilled cheese was very weird it was almost like spray cheese... Yea I know right! I couldn&#39;t even finish the whole thing bit oh well I know I won&#39;t be ordering that anymore! The chili was great as always but it wasn&#39;t very hot (assuming because it was the end of the night) 

My dad&#39;s biscuits were hard as a brick and almost inedible, actually he didn&#39;t eat them. 

I&#39;m not sure what is happening back in the kitchen but I&#39;ve noticed the chef that I used to be familiar with was not there on this night so maybe that&#39;s where the inconsistency is coming from - whoever he is bring him back!

Their hashbrowns are really good, the eggs have been cooked perfectly. A friend tried the French toast and thought it was a little sweet, but since I&#39;m all about savory food for breakfast (anytime!), I won&#39;t be able to comment first-hand. The veggie biscuits and gravy were really good! Something I would make at home, but wouldn&#39;t have the energy to make. At another table, I watched a guy eat something 4-inches high covered in brown gravy. I don&#39;t know what it was, but I&#39;ll admit I had plate envy. It probably had red meat in it, which I don&#39;t eat, but that didn&#39;t take away from its delicious-looking diner quality aesthetic. 

This is good, solid diner food. They aren&#39;t trying to recreate the wheel here. I would like to see a change regarding the biscuits. Since they turn out a lot of them, I&#39;m surprised that they aren&#39;t super-high quality. They&#39;re a little flat and dense, but hold sauces okay. They are also served cool to room temp. If they tweak the recipe-to make their biscuits the flagship, I think they&#39;d be on to something. Taller, fluffier and flakier, gently warmed...that would be the bomb. 

Also, I wish the food overall was always heated to the right temp. 

Good service and a fun diner atmosphere!"

We were in Georgetown and needed some dinner so we headed over to the Square Knot based on all the lovely recommendations from friends here on Yelp.

Looking at the menu in relation to family dinner- I was a little nonplussed to be honest, a burger was $10, and the only lower priced item available for my kiddo was a $5.95 hot dog wrapped in curly fries and fried. I ended up splitting the burger with the girl and was pleased to find it does indeed come with fries (although it doesn&#39;t note that)  The burger was a hand formed patty, served on a decent sesame bun with pretty delicious fries- good enough certainly.  

The service was okay, I liked her, she was nice, but it was a bit distracted for me, it seemed to take a while to get her to come back to our table for different things and I didn&#39;t feel overly needy so I guess that&#39;d be four stars for me. 

I think the magic here is about the access- and since they just turned from 24 hours to open 6-11- and not the food or service to be frank. I think those are both perfectly fine but definitely not 5 stars for me."

I don&#39;t like bad-talking businesses... as a business owner myself, I would appreciate people coming to me if there was ever a problem vs. blasting passive aggressively on the internet and potentially hurting the business... however, they didn&#39;t seem to care that there was a problem, so here i am, posting about the horrible experience.

got breakfast, the steak. I almost always get steak and eggs for breakfast when we go out, which is often, and i have never had it not come with anything, but sure enough, what you get when you order the steak here is just that, a side plate with a steak on it (no seasoning either). I asked for it with eggs, and the waitress asked if i wanted to get the combo with eggs, hashbrowns, and toast, okay sure, sounds good. well, I didn&#39;t get toast, which is fine, i don&#39;t need the carbs.. but when i get the bill i see that that &#34;combo&#34; is a whole extra meal she rang me up for, so i got charged for two separate meals, this &#34;combo&#34; (which on the menu includes toast and meat) AND my steak... so $18 for my &#34;meal&#34;. When I go to fancy restaurants my meal isn&#39;t even that much!!  I just assumed this was a mistake and asked her about it, and she just said &#34;I don&#39;t make the prices&#34;.... in more shock then anything, I asked again, &#34;so $18 for my meal really?&#34; and she again said she didn&#39;t make the prices, rolled her eyes, and walked away. I was in shock, paid with no tip (which i have never done in my entire life!) and left. I wish I had been more calm and collected to think to grab a menu and point out side dish prices (IE side of eggs and side of hashbrowns).... It was just absolutely ridiculous.  Not to mention that my husbands corned beef hash was literally hashbrowns, pieces of corned beef, and RAW red onions mixed together. 

as a diner, i wasn&#39;t expected a 5 star dining experience, but wow, this really couldn&#39;t have been worse... and overpaying and rude service to top it off. 


what a shame, it&#39;s a cute little place..... I&#39;m still just in shock of how bad the experience was."

At first the food was amazing! It was a great self-indulgence, delicious diner food, good service, and an adjacent bar to boot. Since then, through the changes to hours, the insistence upon people leaving within a 1/2 hour of eating despite how generally not full the place is, I&#39;ve kept going. However I&#39;m fairly certain I just left there for the last time. 

The food has gotten to an all time low, not to mention the service. Went in there for a late breakfast (having worked in service for the last five years my late breakfast is about 3/3:30 in the afternoon for those keeping track) with the lady friend. There were, perhaps, 8 other people there, and a couple of kids. Ostensibly about half of the adults worked there, all of which is to say that it was not busy. 

The waitress was not friendly, but neither was she mean or rude. That said she was either new to the industry or just very bad. After she initially took our order (the breakfast combo with a biscuit, eggs over medium, and the thanksgiving sandwich with a cup of chili on the side) we were left on our own for a bit. She took a couple orders from the two guys sitting separately to our left and right, and proceeded to hop out for a smoke. Afterwards she came back to confirm not only the two fellows&#39; orders, but our own, just to be sure. Some time later she brought our food out. As you might imagine, it was pretty much all wrong.

Instead of the thanksgiving sandwich and chili, my ladyfriend received the open faced turkey sandwich, without a side. Though technically the components of my order were all there, the eggs were fully hard, the hashbrowns were wafer thin and incredibly dry and brittle. The biscuit was also dry, brittle, and it seems they&#39;ve downgraded to the mini biscuit rather than a full size. Unfortunately we noticed the sandwich first, and the eggs some time later when we received the chili (intended originally as an accoutrement for the breakfast combo) at which point it seemed like a lost cause to ask for anything to be recooked, as we&#39;d already been sitting around for half an hour not eating. 

Fun fact on service, when the sandwich mistake was brought up the server returned about two minutes later to ask what bread and what cheese should go with the sandwich. At this the ladyfriend responded sourdough, and tried to confirm that in fact the thanksgiving sandwich already comes with cream cheese, doesn&#39;t it? The waitress confessed she didn&#39;t know, she never eats it. Considering that every restaurant either of us had ever worked at we&#39;ve been expected to know the little things like, you know, what food we&#39;re selling, this seemed strange. Maybe it was her first day? In the restaurant industry? 

Ultimately we stacked our garbage with my meal sans two bites (one for each, just to verify how bad it was), asked for a box when the sandwich came out, paid, and went to Maruta for some cheap (but at least edible) sushi. In defense of the waitress, she did give us $2 off our tab for the food we didn&#39;t eat, so that was swell.

Tl:dr? The best thing about the square knot is that there are other places nearby that serve food. If you&#39;re really hard up for late night diner food in the south end, go to Randy&#39;s, where at least it&#39;s cheap with good service, and the food is passable."

The last time I attempted to eat there the waitress did not write down our breakfast order.  As expected when our orders arrived our omelettes did not have the cheese we both ordered and our side of bacon was never delivered.

When we told the waitress (or what their idea of a waitress is) our plates were taken away and instead of making the omelettes we ordered some cheese had been slipped into one of the corners on each.  It was laughable.  Then when we complained to the waitress and showed her how lame the fix was she told us that &#34;I (she) couldn&#39;t handle us anymore because she was pregnant&#34;.  

We then spoke to the cook (because there was no manager present) he agreed to remake our orders as we had asked for in the first place.  He was pretty cool about it but obviously we weren&#39;t dressed &#34;hipster&#34; enough for the cool Georgetown crowd that works there because there was really no sense of pride in how badly our order had been screwed up.

While waiting for our new plates to arrive our so called waitress slid by our table and dropped off two cups of coffee.  Now I was drinking coffee and only needed a refill and NOT two new cups.  My dining partner was having beer so now I had three coffee cups.  That was done out of spite because we complained about our meal not being close to what we ordered and then a half-assed attempt to fix it was called out.  And when I say &#34;slid by&#34; I mean she walked by, dropped the coffee cups down with a thud and kept going without saying a thing.  Most waitresses would simply have offered a refill on my coffee while I had to wait.

At that point we felt so unwelcome we left and found another place to eat.  A better place as well.

Then in for at least two weeks I tried to make contact with this establishment&#39;s management to explain our experience and  in at least 30 attempts to phone it kept going to a voicemail box that had not been set up and could not take messages.  They also had no website where I could email someone about our experience.

Bottom line this is a hipster dive where unless you&#39;re sporting lots of piercings, tattoos and dirty old clothing you&#39;ll be treated like a bother, made to feel unwelcome and likely experience the same poor service and treatment we did.

Avoid this place, there are many better options where people care how hard we work for the money to spend in their establishment.  If this place last another six months I will be surprised."

This is classic diner preparation, not that &#34;elevated&#34; business that is so buzz word these days.  SOS is a solid SOS.  The prices for breakfast and lunch are excellent - a party of 2 can walk out for just over $20, with the tip!  However, that wouldn&#39;t include dessert - which you just might want - since they feature some great, old school sundaes!"

My husband I had just finished watching a movie at home and he turns to me and asked if I was hungry. I looked at the clock and it was almost 10pm already.. I was getting hungry and he then said let&#39;s go to Square Knot! Say what? So we went and I ordered their eggs benedict because I have to and he got a bowl of chili. The eggs benedict wasn&#39;t anything special, it was decent but not as good as other places like Lola&#39;s (still my fav!). And my husband said his chili was good but nothing that hits it outta the water. It&#39;s just your typical diner dive bar. 

We did come back again for their prime rib dinner (on Fri &amp; Sat) with some friends and all the guys ordered it while us girls got something else. The prime rib portions were huge! I was able to share it with the husband and both of us were stuffed!"

The rich brown wood wainscotting next to the 50&#39;s white hexagonal tile is like a step back in time.  The only way you&#39;d know you&#39;re in the 2000&#39;s is the fact that the servers are positively even more tatooed than your average G&#39;town restaurant waitresses. 

I had the thanksgiving sandwich with side salad.  I judge restaurants based on the quality of croutons, and these were fresh &amp; chewy, with sprinkled herbs.  For under $9, the sandwich was stuffed with turkey and the cranberries added the right amount of sweetness.

Service was quality, the prices are extremely fair, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back."

Perfect spot to stop in around 1am and grab a bite on your way back from a Burningman party in fishnets and a sailor outfit, no?
Yes.   Yes it is.

We got the open face turkey sandwich - which looked AND TASTED like Thanksgiving dinner on a plate.  Wowie.  So good.  The mashed potatoes were exactly what I wanted/needed that late - and it totally hit the spot.

Service?  Superb. 

Space?  Super cute diner awesomeness.

It&#39;s a real diner. They really take care of you. I wish I could bring a blanket with me and immediately fall asleep in one of their booths. When I&#39;ve had too much to drink, I&#39;m super hungry and just want someone to hold me, I head to Square Knot and get some french toast and eggs over easy.

No one ever does Hollandaise sauce properly, I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a James Beard award winning restaurant or chef, it is probably one of the hardest culinary feats to master. It seems like it should be easy to make which is why so many get it wrong through lack of attention to detail and technique, it requires precision, timing and attention.  The Hollandaise sauce this morning was perfection.  The consistency was rich and smooth, not curdled at all.  It had just the right lemony tang and and buttery richness.  They had $3 Bloody Marys this morning as well which was also delicious, spicy, tangy, and came topped with a serving of veggies. :-p"

The service is super friendly, I love sitting at the counter and chatting up the wait staff.  We also took home a cinnamon roll which was FANTASTIC.
The chili seems to be very popular with the regulars, I have seen several construction-type fellows standing at the register waiting for their to-go chili orders each time I&#39;ve come by.

Really fast service, nice waitress, free Andes mints with the check (wee!).  I had a milkshake that came with whipped cream, cherry, and a cup for the &#34;scraps&#34; (read: 1.5 milkshakes in total), and the grilled vegetable salad which was this awesome mix of hot veggies piled on mixed greens with tofu and yummy dressing.  I added some hot sauce (waitress suggestion - awesome!) and pepper and it was great.  I was impressed that a diner (I&#39;ve been to a few others - the Hurricane, the 5 Point, Mecca Cafe) actually had legit veggie options.  Not vegetables, but vegetables that are creatively cooked and taste awesome but you still don&#39;t feel bad for finishing the whole plate.  De-lish."

Our server Pam immediately was short with us in the beginning. We continually had to ask her for refills on coffee and water, which she forgot all three times. Finally I got up and asked her and all of a sudden she acted really busy. We had seen her on her phone behind the counter, so we knew she couldn&#39;t have been that busy. She put in the wrong order in our food, set it down and didn&#39;t return for 10 minutes and couldn&#39;t get her to come back to tell her. Her excuse was that it was the &#34;cooks&#34; fault. It took another 20 minutes to get our actual order. Her laziness, lack of service, and poor attitude really turned us off to this place. The whole experience was not pleasant, as we&#39;ve frequented here before and have had a similar experience with her as well. Not too sure how she still has a job there, truly the worst service I&#39;ve ever had. On top of that the food was just ok.... Not worth putting up with service like that.

I&#39;ve been here a bunch... like how many times have I wet myself laughing... a bunch. That&#39;s a lot... or a bunch. I&#39;ve had bacon, French toast, scrambles, milkshakes, omelets, sandwiches, French fries... the list goes on and on just like my use of ellipses...
The servers here rock. I&#39;ve had quite a few serve my cohorts and I and they are more than happy to chat, joke and otherwise pass the time. On one occasion the gal was so sincerely sweet and helpful it literally blew my mind. It was gone for weeks. 
I don&#39;t recall ever not enjoying something I&#39;ve ordered from here and I&#39;m pretty sure if I did they would fix it. 
Due to their open till wheneverthehellwewanttobe stance and their delicious diner delicacies they can be quite busy. I&#39;ve had a few adventures wandering around the streets in the area to kill time as I wait for a table. I do love an adventure. 
Prices are cheap. Cheap, I say! You get a lot of food in your mouth for not a lot of scratch. And they keep the joint clean. After late night soccer games in West Seattle this is often our only choice for grub and as far as only choices go... it&#39;s pretty awesome.

I was heading home late Sunday night and pulled in here. Rather busy it was so the staff was a bit slow. Kristin was nice, as the rest of the ladies were. My single Knot burger (+ swiss &amp; grilled onions) was good (not wet &#39;n sloppy) and a smidge-too-salty fries were nice. The onions probably forgot to get grilled (raw &amp; crunchy). Other traditionals and traditionals with small twists sounded good.

There small ergonomic issues for me: the bar seat height (or counter, whichever) is too tall for me; it&#39;s a bit comfortable hunching way down. And the small steel brim along the counter hurts your elbow when resting on it.

I passed by this little gem one night because it was SO busy.  Yikes!  I really hate waiting.  But then one glorious afternoon on a weekday my man and I stopped in for some chow and I&#39;m so glad we did!

He had the hot open faced turkey sandwich and I had the tuna melt.  The tuna melt was tasty.  Nothing over the top, but tasty.  However, his turkey was REAL, moist and served with some kick a** mashed potatoes.  The au gratin spuds that accompanied my sandwich were also delicious - and a nice option.

And hello! It&#39;s almost worth 5 stars for being 24/7...something we are SORELY lacking here in Seattle.

I&#39;ve been back 3 times in the last two weeks having the veggie scramble, a ham and cheese scramble and the biscuits and gravy.  All were solid, yummy food.  And each time the service was terrific.  Prompt and friendly.  My coffee was always full.

They&#39;ve got a variety of egg dishes that can be made into your choice of a scramble or omelet. Not a big fan of meat? They have veggie sausage! When it comes to ordering toast, english muffin, or a biscuit...you HAVE to get the biscuit. It is definitely worth it. Then you get house-made jelly it&#39;s way too good to pass up! You won&#39;t regret it. 

Another reason I love this place is because they serve their mimosas in a pint glass. It makes all the difference I am also a big bloodymary fan and they make a good one! 

When I come to Square Knot morning or night I always order a scramble...my only complaint about this place is their consistency. Most times I&#39;ll get my food and it will be hot and made perfectly but other times I will get my eggs and my whole plate will be freezing cold with stale tasting fries It might be the transition from morning kitchen crew to dinner? At that point I just order another mimosa and call it good

One thing that will always keep my mom and myself coming back is one of the waitresses Elinor. She is one of the sweetest ladies and works SO hard. She&#39;s my fav! She gets 5 stars for sure!

Tonight I had the worst excuse for eggs Benedict that I&#39;ve ever had the misfortune to eat. Furthermore, the biscuits are clearly straight out of a tube. The sausage and gravy resembles cat puke and everything else is forgettable. In my opinion you are better off at Denny&#39;s."

Hits: Club sandwich, au gratin spuds, the tuna melt and the reuben sandwich.  The fries are frozen but they were crisp.  Initial service was prompt at lunch but slower at dinner.  Clean, hip and quaint.

Misses: Patti melt burger was dry and over cooked.  For a Seattle diner, you&#39;d expect some nice Stumptown roast -- the coffee is nasty.  The price is little too steep for diner fare.  Service was sloooooow.  And it&#39;s small, like 5 booths that seat 4, if full there&#39;s the counter.

I really wished for more but like I said, it&#39;s hit and miss.  Smarty Pants is still a better place for lunch but the 24/7 Square Knot might have a chance if they could get a better cook in the evenings."

It&#39;s &#39;classic&#39; diner food, although they do have a few unexpected vegetarian / vegan items on the menu. Unfortunately, I was really not feelin&#39; the veggie gravy. It wasn&#39;t mushroom gravy... it was a mixture of carrots and vegetables... more like a sauce made of vegetables. I&#39;m sure it was healthy, but it wasn&#39;t spicy or delicious. I only managed a few bites.

My hashbrowns, egg, and pancake were perfectly good though. No liquor but they do have beer and wine.

This is definitely an Asian-inspired restaurant. Lots of sushi-ish and other dishes - but also a few things that add variety like roasted chicken. 

What I did think was interesting was the varying service on each of those nights.  The first night (Monday) - the service wasn&#39;t necessarily bad - but it was a bit short/abrasive. The 2nd night I felt like they learned there was a food critic there because EVERYONE was treating me like I was a movie star. 

All in all though - every dish I ordered was well done and most of the service staff was very well trained. 

A nice touch was that they served prosecco to those who had to wait for a table.

The service here is pretty good though it feels a bit unpersonal, which is okay because I&#39;m just there for the food, but could&#39;ve been more friendly. 
The food itself was fairly good but not my favorite. The way they do Asian fusion is inauthentic and to be honest just a little bit weird. It seems they don&#39;t understand much about Asian food and even though it&#39;s fusion, the parts just don&#39;t all work together. 
It was nothing bad overall but for the price tag, I will probably go somewhere else."

Okay food served by hot 20-something waitresses in tight shirts... I think I get their business model and hiring philosophy. Hip atmosphere and friendly service, so not all smoke and mirrors.

Slightly upscale bar food aside, their Asian-inspired fusion plates feel like they were planned by people who don&#39;t fully understand Asian food. Eg. miso ramen had decent broth, but the spaghetti-like noodles, pea shoots (?), and herby braised chicken breast just felt out of place.

Was blown away by the gorgeous presentation... on their website, at least. None of my actual food looked so meticulously arranged."

One thing that I found amusing was that our server gave us chopsticks for our meal.

Everyone else at our table got huge servings of delicious looking food! We get.... An insanely, almost comically small plate of three tacos that can be finished in two bites each, and a medium sized dish of pretty-good-but-not-great pasta. Considering that we are still very hungry after finishing our plates, we order the rainbow roll. Still hungry! So we order dessert.

However the miso ramen was so-so, the charcoaled chicken tastes great but flavor combo is a bit off.

The vibe is so hip it hurts. But even as one who eschews that type of vibe...and even if it&#39;s a bit loud in here...I must give Joey Kitchen kudos for excellent food and fantastic service.

This is a laid back atmosphere...like an upscale sports bar. The crowd, while primarily young, is impressively diverse. One drawback would be the noise level - there&#39;s no escaping the din. But I will brave the noise for the menu!

I call this menu &#34;International Soul Food&#34;. The selections are there to comfort you.  They have a variety of Asian dishes: Sushi, Butter Chicken, Curry and Stir Fries. They also have things like Paella, Braised Short Ribs on Mashed Potatoes, Fish Tacos, lots of Steaks, Ravioli and other pastas.

My last time out I tried the Miso Ramen. I&#39;m pretty fussy about ramen; my favourite chain being Santouka from Japan. While Joey Kitchens&#39; version isn&#39;t strictly traditional - particularly with the use of grilled chicken instead of roast pork as a garnish - it is very delicious and satisfying. The miso broth is very good.

Prices are mostly reasonable but occasionally on the high side at Joey -for example, the Miso Ramen is 16- (high by any North American standard) but worth it.

Desserts won&#39;t let you down - so don&#39;t skip them if you have a sweet tooth. The Apple Pie (8.5) in particular is fantastic.

Service is excellent - the managers are constantly circulating and making sure of quality. Even a slight confusion over a drink brought someone to our table immediately to correct the error. And even though it&#39;s busy &amp; hip in here, the servers are attentive &amp; friendly.

Not really a place for a romantic meal - but great for a small gathering or going out with another couple."

Plenty of seating in and outside. Heating and a rolling roof make the patio versatile. Staff is super friendly and always happy to accommodate. Drinks are great across the board with enough variety to satisfy everyone. I love that they have Mac &amp; Jack&#39;s but that&#39;s because it&#39;s my favorite local draft. I wish their food options were more organic/free range/sustainable than they appear to be yet the flavors make me push that wish a bit further down the list. Everything I&#39;ve had has been delicious, from the chicken sandwich to the curry shrimp and the rotisserie chicken. No steak for me yet because none of the options seem to be from grassfed beef.

Portion sizes are very adequate. Minor squabble, the chicken can be hard to find in a multi-ingredient dish like the butter chicken or sandwich. Dessert options are very focused, making their homemade icecream a big star. Apple pie is outstanding. My wife likes the maple ice cream the best. The souffle appears to be more like a molten lava cake but I&#39;m not complaining. Overall clean, modern, welcoming. I couldn&#39;t recommend JOEY kitchen more highly.

However, I am fairly disappointed in the service and food from here. It may look very presentable and good but the pasta I ordered, lobster ravioli was disappointing because it was very salty and just too thick and creamy for me. I am a big lobster fan so this didn&#39;t meet my expectations. Also, my sisters steak that she ordered wasn&#39;t warm, it was cold. 

The service was very confusing as well. We started off with one lady who seated us and we told her we were in a hurry and she gave us water and everything. However a few minutes later a different lady showed up and I&#39;m unsure if she was new or not but she had horrible memory and would forget to bring us our food, the menu, and the check. She took an extra 20 minutes to do something we told her to do. We asked her for a menu to look at the desserts and she spent 5 minutes describing them and told her we wanted a menu so she said she&#39;d bring us one but came back 15 min later and asked if we got the menu yet. Who else is supposed to bring us a menu??? 

My sister was very unhappy so she asked to 
speak to the manager and he apologized and was unaware of what the servers actions. He took my sisters dinner off the check since she told him it was a grad dinner. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come back here again."

We came in on a Thursday afternoon before we caught our plane back the LA. There was barely anyone inside the restaurant at all. We were all seated and served our waters in a nice timely manner. I wasn&#39;t too hungry and was recovering from a flu, so I ordered their bowl of chicken soup for $7.  I was considering their lettuce wraps for $11.75 but couldn&#39;t pass up soup. Everything else was around ~$15 range. 

I can see why my soup was listed in a starters side of the menu. It was tiny. Well not crazy tiny but this is definitely not what you would want to order if you&#39;re hungry. Luckily for me, it did the job with my pre conditions. 

The best part of this place is strangely their restroom. The way the faucets are setup have you reaching like you&#39;re steering a spaceship or something similar. I wanted to keep going. But I had to leave otherwise people would think something is wrong. 

If you&#39;re expecting $40 or so for two ppl for lunch this is a nice place. Go to the restroom! :)"

The food fell slightly short in comparison to the decor. 
They serve all kinds of food, from wings to flatbread and sushi, that is probably the main drawback, why offer everything and only be mediocre at it while you can be the master at just one. 
We ordered some wings, flatbread and some tortilla, food was good, but way too spicy; I felt like the only flavor added to every bite was pepper instead of proper seasoning. 
The service was really good. As for the price point, I did not pick up the tab, so am not quite sure how much it was, but by looking at the menu, it was more  on the expensive side.

This was the first time I&#39;ve ever sat at a bar and not felt awkward. The bar has a comfortable executive feel, and while sports are still on the many streamlined flatscreens hanging above it, it felt more like a sexy lounge than a pickup bar. The overall feel is classy and expensive, and the service lives up to that feel.

Our bar tender, Cinzia, added to the white collar feel of the experience with a seamless flow from conversation and drinks into dinner. Her comfort in this setting was contagious; while bars are not my go-to, she had perfect timing and kept the conversation flowing naturally with us and all of the other bar guests in a way that felt entirely natural. She genuinely took the experience from 4 to 5 stars. She was also excellently knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.

Aside from the service, the drinks are the best thing about Joey Kitchen. I had their summer sangria but also had the pleasure of trying my friend&#39;s cherry vodka and lime slush concoction and both were stunning. Their price point is similar to other Seattle establishments, especially in this neighborhood, but the drinks are legitimately the best. They are fantastic. The bar has two different flavors of slush available, an alcoholic peach bellini and a virgin lime, but you&#39;ll find them mixed into several other drinks in a way that is both unique and delicious. Cinzia was kind enough to let us try both on their own (the lime slush made up the top of his drink and the peach bellini made the bottom of mine) and they&#39;re fantastic standing alone but I could write a sonnet about the way that salty, sour lime danced with the sweet cocacola and cherry vodka.

Pro Tip: Don&#39;t neglect the menu drink specials. Friday&#39;s Super Stoked Vodka and Saturday&#39;s Summer Sangria are a fantastic deal for the taste and level of service they come with.

Foodwise, I tried the infamous nachos, and they did not disappoint. It&#39;s pretty easy to get a solid plate of nachos at a bar in Seattle, but what it&#39;s not easy to find is a plate of nachos that actually feels like someone put thought into it. It&#39;s easy to drown chips in cheese and meat and call it a night, but these nachos actually had a range of flavor that didn&#39;t just come from throwing on the basic ingredients. They felt fresh and lively and summery, which was a welcome reprieve from the heaviness of similar plates I&#39;ve had recently. They also come covered in an actual sauce which gave them a different feel and flavor from what I&#39;ve generally had and gave the whole mountain of food depth to match it&#39;s prowess in size.

Overall, Joey Kitchen was surprisingly cool. It&#39;s pricey, but the service made it feel like a personalized experience with a bar tender acting as my own concierge in the first class seat of a flight to somewhere sexy. Would recommend."

I like coming here with my roommates to grab some dinner and drinks. The decor is modern and contemporary giving it a very trendy feel. There&#39;s a lot of windows and a patio area with a movable ceiling that they open during good weather. The ambiance can vary depending on if you&#39;re going during the day or night, because of all the natural light. I&#39;ve been here a handful of times and prefer going during the night. 

The food is pretty good and most of the menu is Asian-fusion. They also have a lot of classic bar food, but with a few twists making it seem more gourmet. I&#39;ve primarily ordered burgers, which have always been pretty good. The cool part about their menu is this location offers trial items that aren&#39;t offered at other Joey locations. These items tend to be a little more exciting and sometimes samples are given. 

The drink menu is the best part of this place, they have a drink specials every day of the week with a beer option and a cocktail option. I prefer cocktails and the daily specials are always well-priced compared to other options in the area and have a good amount of alcohol. Like their food, they add a twist to classic drinks usually taking the form of limoncello slush added as garnish.

The service has always been hit or miss the times I&#39;ve went. With the location being so close to UW they tend to think younger people are students. Most of my friends who go with me are recent grads so we look young and it&#39;s understandable to mistake us for students. The issue is that we get treated with this stigma by both the hostesses and waiting staff. If the staff were a little bit friendlier it would go a long way."

I was served a raw chicken sandwich here while 6 months pregnant.  See attached photo.

Service was painfully slow.   We had to ask for our Diet Cokes three times before we got them, and then we waited a very long time for our food.  They had a lot of people on staff there, but very few were actually working.   Our female server initially only made eye contact with my husband which I thought was odd, but then I watched as she took our order, then bussed some tables, then took another table&#39;s order, before finally going to the computer to put our order in.   As soon as I saw that, I figured we&#39;d be there a long while.

Regardless, once our food arrived, my husband&#39;s BBQ chicken sandwich was luke warm at best, and halfway into eating my California Chicken Sandwich, not only did I notice an overwhelming taste of fake smoke flavoring, I also noticed that the chicken breast was not only pink - but raw.   Immediately nauseated, I pushed my plate aside while I tried to wave over our server.  I was nice about it, but asked to have it removed from our bill, which it was.

The manager on duty came to speak to us on her own accord, and was very sympathetic to the situation and did her share to make things as good as they could get at that point.   I appreciated that.   However, as I sit here now at home, sick to my stomach, I can&#39;t help but wonder if it&#39;s the raw chicken I ate or if it&#39;s all in my head from just the thought.  *She shudders*... 

In fairness, I was offered a gift card to use should we decide to return some day, and while I can&#39;t honestly say I have any desire to go back, should I do so, I will most certainly update this review."

I had such a pleasant experience, I took my husband here on Sunday!  My friend and I didn&#39;t have a reservation Friday, but the hostess was extremely friendly and would personally walk up to us to give us updates on our table.  We waited less than 10 mins and we were seated in a cozy booth by the window.  I ordered a Bellini- I was surprised to see it in slushy form but it was still delicious.   For my meal I ordered the paella and it was soooooooo good! It was full of shrimp, sausage and lobster.  My favorite thing about it was that it came in a personal paella pan so you still got the crispy rice on the bottom.   So good!

That Sunday my husband and I showed up in the middle of the NFL games.   We were seated right away at a table near the bar. We started with the Goyza which were not fried and they had a nice kick from the spicy mustard.  We also had the lettuce wraps- which had a ton of fresh ingredients and crispy noodles.  Both were very good.  For our meal, my husband got the hamburger- which u assume was good because I didn&#39;t even get a bite to try it!   I went with the Salmon rice bowl.  It had a ton of fresh vegetables which added a nice crispy texture to the rice and salmon.  

Overall the food was amazing.  I loved everything I ordered.   My husband even made a comment that he enjoyed watching football in the bar atmosphere without having to eat the typical fried bar food.    

The service was fast and friendly.  The hostess had great recommendations and our server was equally as attentive."
joey-kitchen-at-university-village-seattle,Jens J.,mBruzuCXfVQ3gug8H7EgdA,"Seattle, WA",1,1,0,714,148,zcYtfFpdw-UIYGAjFrBAFg,4.0,2015-07-24,"I wouldn&#39;t be truthful if I didn&#39;t first off tell you that Joey&#39;s was the backup plan just in case the wait to get into Din Tai Fung upstairs was too insane.   Well, the wait was insane, so we came to Joey.   Joey has a modern, sumptuous interior that&#39;s easy on the eyes.  JP tells me that there&#39;s a Joey at Southcenter too.

All the tables in Joey were taken, but our wait for a table at 6:00pm on a Thursday evening was no more than 10 minutes.  We were seated on the patio with the retractable window panels in the ceiling.  The panels were open, which was perfect for a rare cool evening during a relentlessly hot summer.

But what was less than perfect were the chairs&#39; interaction with the rough cinderblock floor.  The legs on the wooden chairs don&#39;t slide across the cinderblocks, they instead sort of jerk and grind, maybe with a big enough jerk to plow right over your foot.  Watch out!

Much better was the food.  Four stars plus really.  We loved the fried cauliflower cubes, which came coated with a sweet and sour chili miso sauce and then sprinkled with sesame and poppy seeds.  Also, they gave us a little cup into which we squeezed a lime&#39;s juices.  Then we dipped the cauliflower pieces into the lime juice.  The juice paired very nicely with the cauliflower&#39;s chili miso coating.

For my entrée, I ordered the short ribs.   The short ribs reminded me of Sunday roast beef growing up.  Joey&#39;s beef was tender and delicious.  The mashed potatoes and asparagus that came with the beef were excellent.  But most outstanding was the gravy.  This is one of the most delicious gravies I&#39;ve ever sipped.

JP ordered the Cab Burger.  Reminding me a bit of chicken lettuce wraps at P.F. Changs, the Cab Burger is a quarter pound beef patty enclosed in a &#34;bun&#34; of lettuce.  Inside the lettuce bun, in addition to the beef, were pickles and 1000 Island dressing.  A lettuce burger is a novel concept, but not terribly practical.  While the beef was tasty and top quality, the lettuce burger quickly fell apart, becoming an eat-with-a-knife- and-fork burger.   JP embellished his burger with Siracha.  The pomme frites (French fries) that came with JP&#39;s burger were excellent.

Unfortunately, the service setup is rather poor.  You have six or seven or eight different people serving your table.  You never really have a server, per se.  And what happened with us is that we asked two or three of the different people if we could get water and ice tea refills.  All of them said, yes, of course.  But none of these people ever brought us refills!  But finally, the fourth person we asked for refills from did bring us refills.

But in the grand scheme of things, I&#39;m not sure how important is the service setup.  The ambience is pleasant and the food delicious, so I&#39;m going to round 3.5 stars up to 4."

The theme is steakhouse and rotisserie meets sushi bar, a twist on the classic surf-and-turf model. 

Execution is very good. Service is warm, friendly, unobtrusive and relaxed. The food arives well-plated and perfectly cooked, sushi carefully executed and fresh. 

The store is dark, modern, heavy-feeling and intimate. The bar keeps almost everything below countertop, making for a clean look. The televisions are an annoying distraction in an otherwise warm and stylish adult environment. 

The prices are highish, especially if you drink alcohol, but there&#39;s value on the plate; the food is delicious and interesting to eat, and although the cocktail list leans towards the foo-foo (sweet stuff. This IS the U-district...), the beer selection is more than adequate to pair with anything on the menu and the wine list is decent.

Recommended."

I had high hopes for their tuna sashimi salad given all the reviews.  I asked for the dressing on the side.  Lovely presentation.  Sashimi was fresh and the flavor was good. Avocado nice and ripe. The greens were fresh but I was a little put off by the bitterness of the greens.  The dressing was delicious although it didn&#39;t disguise the bitterness.

For my drink, ordered Acqua Panna grapefruit elderflower.  It was refreshing although it wasn&#39;t as fruity as I&#39;d hoped.

All in all, fresh food but perhaps I should have ordered something else."

Strange to order ramen at Joey, but it really is amazing. Maybe not ultra traditional ramen, but that doesn&#39;t matter to me. We&#39;ve ordered a lot of other things and the food is definitely solid. Generally liked the servers we&#39;ve had. We don&#39;t usually eat at huge, corporate feeling restaurants like this, but they make it work somehow - lots of greenery. Very comfortable semi-outdoor area. Nice drinks.

Walked in yesterday and they greeted us with a glass of champagne. The meal was excellent - I had the steak and sushi, he had the ahi tuna club. Really like this place a lot."
joey-kitchen-at-university-village-seattle,Liz C.,jTLcYO0sWQergwONKPcNNQ,"Santa Clara, CA",1,1,1,320,28,ue8ksxrZXjIA4-1M5QhUdQ,4.0,2015-07-01,"Originally the plan was to go to Din Tai Fung, but after finding out about the current wait time, we decided to go down a floor and give Joey&#39;s a shot. It was the best decision to do so that night.

It&#39;s hard to miss Joey&#39;s because of the outdoor seating and modern look. It usually buzzing with people but we were able to get seated soon after we had entered. Better yet, we were given outdoor heating on such a sunny evening.

Joey&#39;s offers a wide selection of foods. You can find your classic American dishes like sandwiches, burgers and steaks, as well as Asian dishes like sushi rolls and sashimi. They also offer other ethnic dishes. We were pleased with the selection and couldn&#39;t figure out what to order! We ordered quite a bit to try it all.

Nachos Grande - We started with this as an appetizer. This platter is huge and is meant for sharing! I adore that they make their own chips! You can see that it&#39;s homemade and the puffiness of each of the chips. The crunch is so satisfying. It comes with an amazing salsa. I can&#39;t tell you what is in it but it is just such a well fit salsa for the nachos. We opted out of the olives and sour cream, but it does come with those normally. The guacamole was refreshing and I loved how each piece of chicken was so tender and well seasoned. I would say that our dinner at Joey&#39;s started with a great crunch!

Rainbow Roll - I typically don&#39;t get sushi unless it&#39;s from a place that specializes in sushi, but I did want to give it a shot. I was pleased with the rainbow roll here. I would say it&#39;s the best rainbow roll I have had yet. The pieces of tuna and salmon were fatty and so smooth. It was very easy get down. The rolls just tasted so light and fresh. The sriracha aioli was easily a good partner for this roll.

Steak and Prawns - If you ask for medium, they will make sure they deliver medium. I like that about Joey&#39;s. The steak is 5 oz but it is a very thick piece. The prawns are skewered and perfectly grilled. You know because you can taste the grill itself on these prawns. It came with seasonal veggies (at the time it was zucchini and peppers). I was very confused when I saw egg roll like items on the plate because it was supposed to come with mashed potatoes. We were taken aback when we opened up one of the egg rolls to find it filled with soft, creamy mashed potatoes! These mashed potatoes were to die for. I wish they would make these as an appetizer because they were just that good! The crispy exterior gives a great textural crunch and the inside is just so light and creamy. Best thing ever!

Spanish Paella - It comes in a cast iron and that means that the bottom of the rice is going to get nice and crispy! If you want to prefer it from being too burnt, make sure to mix the paella right after it arrives. The rice is simmered in a lobster broth which is present, but not overpowering. They don&#39;t skimp out on the shrimp here. There are juicy, plump big shrimp on top, and little shrimp all throughout the rice. The chorizo pieces add a perfect spice and saltiness to the dish. Overall, it&#39;s such a comforting dish.

Service was good to a point. Our waitress was very talkative and super nice. She always had a smile on her face and made sure everything was tasting good. She gave great recommendations as well. The only downside was that we were sitting waiting for her to come back to get our bill for quite a long time. It seemed like no one noticed that we were just sitting there with our food no longer being touched. Other than that, service was perfect.

Price wise, Joey&#39;s is on the more expensive end. Appetizers are going to be around $15 while main entrees will be around $20-35, depending on what you get. However, for the quality of the food and the experience, I think it was well worth coming here. I can see myself coming back here for a special occasion. At the end of the night, we paid close to $100 for our meal. Most of the dishes here are shareable, so it might be cheaper to order and share everything with your guests.

Glad I came here and had a good experience - please make the mashed potatoes into an appetizer! I would buy so many!"

Staff were always friendly and approachable, and the food is not typical at all. Entrees are about $15-$25 which is pretty standard for a place like this. However, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m paying that much just for the ambience at all. The food is really good! 

I would recommend starting with the &#34;Hibachi Wings&#34;, and if you like salad, go for their &#34;Tuna Sashimi&#34; salad. It is a balance dish. It&#39;s fresh, but still fills you up.

For drinks, they have different deals each day and the Supersonic Gin &amp; Tonic used to be my favorite, but I&#39;ve now switched to the Passionfruit Margarita. It&#39;s just delicious!"

Our party of two walked in late Saturday night after a UW basketball game and were told the wait would be over an hour but could grab seats at the bar. We were very successful at this very quickly. The bar tenders were friendly and attentive but not too attentive and the food very fresh and tasteful. We shared the pile of nachos and had a few glasses of the house white and red wines. 

We were approached by two different groups of guys with compliments and drink offers but not in a creepy way, just a friendly and neighborly way. 

PROS: fun feel; not to crowded; wide range of seating options; great affordable drinks;
CONS: lil loud; watch out for creepers"

The pros about Joey&#39;s Kitchen include being able to run into a warm cozy space as a party of 6 going as a walk-in. They have a gluten-free menu but it&#39;s essentially just excluding extra ingredients on the regular menu. Tips: Instead of just removing ingredients, can you add other ingredients such as tofu in lieu of just eliminating the wonton skins? I ordered the ahi tuna salad and the best part was the salad dressing. They managed to perfectly drench (w no soggy lettuce) every bit of lettuce with the dressing. The only thing which could have used work is the presentation. The beauty of the presentation of the chicken salad was lovely! They should have added some of the color of the veggies to the ahi salad.

The service here was lovely with our waitress who always had a smile on her face; however, the kitchen seemed too busy with orders since they made our nachos incorrectly."

Sevinch recommended we try the berry buck and it was very flavorful as well. Our real server just wrote things down and left.

Even though it was the middle of the week, the bar area/music seemed loud and young-ish, but our table was set far enough away that we figured it would be fine. It was a bit loud for a conversation, but not impossible. We were happy with the 20 minute wait for a table (which was more like only 15). So far, so good. 

The service seemed a bit confusing to us. One person took our drink order, another brought water, another (I think) brought drinks and another took our food order. Second round of drinks brought by another(?) Between each of these visits, we had a good 15 to 20 minute lag time, so nearly 45-50 minutes after being seated before we even started on food. When it finally did come, the nachos we ordered with no chicken (I don&#39;t eat meat, husband does) was, sadly, piled with chicken. Easy mistake, of course. Once we were able to send that back (waitress was MIA again), we contented ourselves with the cauliflower (which was amazingly good) until I noticed a shrimp mistakenly breaded and fried and hidden among the cauli. So... veggie dish #2 with meat hiding in it. Our chicken-less nachos finally arrived and they were very good, piled high and beautifully plated. About halfway through, our waitress brought us plates and utensils :/  Anyway, no mention of the long wait or mistaken food (a comped drink or dessert would have been awesome but a &#34;sorry about that&#34; would have been equally appreciated). With the number of options in UVillage in particular and Seattle in general, there are certainly better places to spend our money. We definitely won&#39;t be back."

This place is pretty versatile; anything from casual drinks to special events can be accommodated. 

Their steaks and sushi roll is actually very good, as are their burgers and appetizers. For lunch their soups and salads go well with a great selection at the bar. They tend to have a few special craft beers or ciders available. 

The atmosphere is casual although very cool and hip with dimly lit booths and beautiful people who work there. Never a bad choice unless things are excessively busy, then service tends to take a nosedive."

We arrived around 6:30pm on a Monday evening and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  Luckily there were only 2 of us so the wait, I&#39;m sure, could have been worse.  But even so, the restaurant had many people in it especially for a week night!

I wasn&#39;t sure what to get, especially because their drinks and food menus both had SO many choices!  Since it was a Monday, I looked at their specialty cocktails for Monday - Real Peach Bellini.  It sounded delicious!  But as soon as I told the waitress, she said they recently stopped making that drink because of the season.  :( I was pretty disappointed, but there were still many other cocktails on the menu, so I opted for the Elderflower Collins - delicious and fruity!  I love fruity drinks and would definitely order this again the next time I come here.  In terms of food, my friend raved about the Hibachi Chicken Wings so we ordered that.  Yummy, indeed!  It comes with 10-12 wings.  I was expecting the wings to have more spice to it but when there is spicy food I am pretty critical about the lack of hotness.  :)  Between the 2 of us, we didn&#39;t finish it (I think we only ate half?) so we had to take it home.  For entrees, it took me awhile to choose, but I finally decided to order the BBQ Salmon Rice Bowl.  Let me just say, it was DE-LI-CIOUS!  The portion size was very generous (I had to box half of it) AND it was tasty!  Seafood is my favorite protein and the salmon was grilled and marinated to perfection.  The dish also came with plenty of vegetables (which I also love) so I was definitely happy about that.

Overall I would encourage everyone to come to this restaurant.  Because this restaurant is very popular, it gets pretty loud in the restaurant.  Sometimes my friend and I would have some slight difficulty hearing each other while we were talking so we had to sit a little closer to each other so we wouldn&#39;t have to yell at each other.  :)  While the prices are a little more than your average night out for dinner, you definitely get your money&#39;s worth from the very diverse menu and quality of food."

You can get a little bit of both, and really have the best of both worlds. Everything is well presented on the plate, tastes perfect, and leaves you wanting more. The service is very hands on and everyone who works there seems to be someone you would want to actually hang out with or could have a cool conversation with. It seems they put a lot of time into making this place the perfect atmosphere and it shows. I can go casually with a girlfriend to eat or dress up for a date with my boyfriend. It&#39;s a super foodie place willing to try new, fun recipes that you didn&#39;t even know you wanted. 

Oh, and if you like to drink at all--be a little wild and try some of their original signature drinks. (First off the drink names are catchy, so whoever names them deserves a drink! Pun intended of course) also if you ask the server to try something new and you absolutely hate it they are willing to replace it right away. But believe me you won&#39;t want to ask to replace the drink unless it&#39;s because your drink is now empty.

The only downside: it can be pretty pricy. My eyes kind of get big here, but the portions are not huge, so sometimes I end up spending a pretty penny. On a student budget, it&#39;s definitely worth saving up for, but not something I could do on a regular basis. :)"

Review: 6.5/10 
Price:US$24-25 + tips 
Although it says American restaurant, I think it is fusion restaurant. The fries are thin and crispy. I recommended to try them because I finished all. I ordered steak fries with medium rare. The source is so so. The service is nice since the waitress told me to aware of drinking hot water  it is a good place to talk with your close friends. 
as people finished, can go to restroom. There is surprise!

Came here with fiance on a Friday evening. I ordered the prime rib with balsamic reduction and he ordered the half rotisserie chicken on frites.

Was immediately creeped out by the fact that maybe only 2 (the bartender and one busboy, from what I could see) of the front of house staff here were not beautiful, college-aged, thin young women with long hair and tight, monochrome clothing. And they have a huge staff. Obvious hiring practices, anyone? Maybe I&#39;ll have to go on another night.

Free prosecco while you wait for a table, nice touch. Very loud and crowded, but our server was as attentive as she possibly could be on a busy night. 

Kitchen sent out our appetizer and main courses at the same time, so I didn&#39;t really have time to enjoy both, but that said the portion sizes were unexpectedly good and the food was really nice. I rarely order prime rib at a restaurant, but I have to say this may have been one of my favourite orders. I appreciated the generous helping of vegetables that came with the mashed potatoes and meat.

Overall a good experience, may come back again."

Since I came in solo, I figured sitting at the bar was the best bet.  The bartender, Paige, was super welcoming and eager to offer suggestions for food.  I settled on the hibachi wings (amazing) and the lobster &amp; prawn ravioli (also solid, but the wings were the shining star).  The manager, Tiffany, came by to check on everything and made sure my experience was up to expectations...it was and more!

Because this place is fairly new to the University District, University Village is filled with a number of people everyday so wanting to eat here gets difficult sometimes. I recommend ordering the Steak and Sushi. The steak is very soft and tasty and the amount given is a perfect balance for you to leave full since it does come with sushi.

Though the service is what i come to expect when coming to this brand restaurant, usually top notch.  But the food is seriously lacking here on two occasions on the same month.

Lunch the other week.  It was a sad sad lunch.  One I was alone at the bar.  But more so, the balsamic braised beef ribs?  Cold.  I get it, it&#39;s lunch, you made the dish earlier, perhaps the day before.  You had one thing to do, re-heat it properly.  Nope.  Not only was that cold, but the mash was cold, and asparagus room temp.  Nothing even what I could consider warm.  I ate it begrudgingly.  It was offered to comp it, but I instead paid for it since I did eat it all, but got free coffee out of the ordeal.

Last night, the Panang prawn curry?  Holy moly, the basics of making a curry...  Cook the shrimp through.  It was still translucent.  Better would have been to flash sear the thing and dump it in towards the end.  The onions could have used the same treatment too.  

But one thing about Joey&#39;s I&#39;ve always loved, the service.  Both nights the staff were superb."

The peach bellini is pretty good as well since they have their own little slushie machine.

I can&#39;t say the same for their food though. I think that it&#39;s overpriced and mediocre. But there are a couple of items I do really enjoy. Their hibachi chicken wings are tasty. They are puny wings, but plentiful. I also like the pesto shrimp flatbread, with chipotle aioli drizzled on top. The baked-to-order apple pie is to die for. That probably deserves 4 stars by itself."

All the waitresses look nearly the same - it&#39;s clear that the manager hires a &#34;type&#34;, and it has all the atmosphere of a big corporate chain.

The food was pretty awful - edible, but with the focus on sweet sauces, lots of salt and average ingredients.

We tried the salmon bowl (overly teriyaki-fied farm raised salmon I would guess), and the veggies and fish were slathered in sweet salty soy, sticking to everything, totally dominating the flavor.

The Baja fish tacos were bland, with the breading on the fried fish chunks overwhelming any fish flavor.

Now having that much floor staff you&#39;d think you&#39;d get more than enough service....however even since removing their high heeled clad girl only floor staff it&#39;s still slow to get even a coke when you&#39;re not sitting at the bar! I swear it&#39;s the only place that&#39;s quicker to get service by two servers only sitting at the bar. Luckily the server tonight was and is beyond so sweet. I was a server for many years so I know how hard it is. Could improve on the timing and not such an emphasis on servers doing their side work.

In all honesty we had come from a concert in the downtown university district and were quite inebriated and needed some food. I&#39;m afraid we were more fit to a Denny&#39;s than this swanky upscale eatery. It has a very upscale feel to it with low lights, huge floor-to-ceiling windows open to the air outside, gorgeous waitresses and bar tenders all in black skirts and heels, and a very center stage type seating arrangement. The prices also match the upscale feel and are up there with appetizers that can run you into double digits. As such, we did not give the menu a fair chance and ordered from the appetizers list. Should we ever return to this place (sober) I&#39;d like to give it a fair chance. I&#39;ll just be sure to line my pocketbook with some cash!

Visited the first time with a small group of friends.  Sat near-ish the bar.  Ordered a few glasses of wine and a few snacks.  Service was unfriendly but competent.  Food was tasty enough but nothing groundbreaking (save, perhaps, for the awesome potato-eggroll).  Wine selection by the glass is a bit brief.  

Returned with a slightly larger party to get seated at a table.  The wait between when we checked in and when we were seated was pretty long and the staff were clearly confused.  Did a full dinner and some wine.  Service was friendly and attentive but extremely ineffective.  Long waits to place orders, missing utensils, empty water glasses, cold food, plates given to the wrong people.  Salmon and rice bowl was so over-seasoned it was on the borderline of edible.  Did end up complaining to the manager, who was very friendly an apologetic, but did not really go out of the way to fix things.

The vibe of the place is a bit confusing.  The food seems to be going for something upscale, but it is a noisy atmosphere with TVs on the walls.  Wait staff seem to be generally eager but poorly coordinate or trained.

Bathrooms were filthy and get negative marks for not being gender-neutral.

The kicker is the price.  For as expensive as it is, I expect either exceptional service, great atmosphere, or surprisingly good food; none have ever been the case."

Having arrived before my friend did, I asked for a table for two but I felt like they didn&#39;t want to seat me at a table, instead pressing me to take a place at the bar.  I felt like I had to insist on a table in order to get one (they seemed a bit busy, but not packed).

Once seated, I noticed the warmth of the air on an otherwise cold day.  The overhead heaters I thought were a nice touch, though perhaps a couple degrees too warm.

I also appreciated that the servers/waitresses/hostesses actually wore makeup (a rarity in Seattle) and had a consistent dress code.  The lipstick on my water glass, however, was not so appreciated.  A little more attention to detail would be nice, if not a more powerful detergent.

They appeared to have an open WiFi network, but it had zero bars of connectivity and was thus unusable.

My burger was a bit undercooked for my tastes, so be sure to specify how done you prefer yours to be.  Also, I requested both a side caesar salad and fries, but only received the fries... until I left, at which point they gave me a salad in a box.

The tables were nice and sturdy, and I felt were spaced apart just enough that I didn&#39;t feel crowded.  It was quite noisy however.  I felt like I had to speak up in order to talk to my friend who was sitting beside me, and strained to hear him.

Overall, I would say an average experience.  Nothing that would make me avoid returning, but nothing that makes me really want to go back."

I wish there were more tuna but the salad was tasty on its own. My boyfriend ordered fish taco. At first we didn&#39;t see any fish but only saw shrimp. The shrimp was juicy and tender. We found small pieces of fish later on but if you are expecting all fish, this isn&#39;t it. I didn&#39;t try any of the steaks here and some of the other reviews said the steaks were not that good or at least not worth the price. I think this place is probably good for the snacks and the fresh light entrees more than the steaks. It is a little bit on the pricier side but I think it&#39;s worth it. 

Dessert: We ordered Lava molten chocolate souffle for dessert. It&#39;s not exactly a souffle with he risen height but it was definitely molten! The chocolate oozed out right when we cut it open. It was so delicious we finished it in a matter of seconds. 

Service: we had a very very nice server. She was fast on bringing out the drink and food and her service was a really nice bonus to our experience at the restaurant. 

Environment: The restaurant has a very nice and chic decor. I would come here to celebrate special occasions or have work lunch. It&#39;s not too casual nor too high end. 

We really enjoyed our night here and I recommend it to anyone who&#39;s is looking for something fresh and a welcoming environment!"

I absolutely loved it! The ambiance was perfect, they had opened the roof because it was such a nice night out and the menu had so many delicious options. I started with a drink, called the Bramble and it was excellent. For dinner I had the gyoza and the ramen bowl and my friend had the sushi cone and the lobster prawn ravioli. Both were super delicious. Service was great, our waitress (Gergana) was very attentive and sweet and the manager (Isabelle) was also awesome, she stopped by a few times to make sure everything was good and we were enjoying our meal!!

The bartender Cinzia was very personable and recommended me the Super stoked vodka and coke. I&#39;m not a big drinker but gave it a try. Sour lime slush, with cherry vodka, balanced with the sweetness of coke. And you know what, it was excellent. Despite being a double, I could barely taste the alcohol thanks to the flavor. It was so good, I would have ordered a second... but it was clearly a double so one was my limit. I just wanted a small bite to go with the drink so I ordered an appetizer. This particular location has a duck confit poutine. As a Canadian, I couldn&#39;t pass that up. Yummy curds with nice thick gravy. The duck was soft and yummy and made the appetizer quite filling.

Our bar tender informed us that the Super stoked was a happy hour deal on Fridays. I will be back for more poutine for sure."

We were a party of four and the waiter (who turned out to be a trainee) just brought food for one person. After a while she talked to the manager and told us that the manager will talk to us. The manager casually put the rest of the food (much later) and she didn&#39;t acknowledge the issue till I talked to her. The manager said she will take care of our appetizers and then only took care of just one. Giving 2 stars instead of 1 for food quality. Horrible service and bad handling from the management side.

A son as we were seated we were immediately greeted with a smile, water and menus. We had multiple servers/bartenders check in on us to get us another cocktail or clear away our food. Wonderful service!!

FISH TACOS
Comes with soft tacos filled with deep fried fish chunks and fresh veggies. Yum!

CHEESEBURGER
They cook it medium to medium well, so if you like it differently make sure you let them. Comes with a side of their addicting shoestring fries!"

This is a divey type hole in the wall right across the street from my job. You can smell the food from a block away and that is not a bad thing!
When you walk in, you are welcomed by smiling faces at the counter . The owner had our food neatly packed into a bag so that it was easy for us to transport across the street. She laughed with us and was extremely friendly.

They have a menu with a wide variety of different sandwiches hot and cold. They offer breakfast burritos,  bagels, soups, etc. These are not just little sandwiches, these are Big sandwiches that are full of meat and very very filling. Today I had the honey mustard chicken and bacon on a hoagie. It was amazing! If I wasn&#39;t so hungry I probably could have shared it with another person. They were reasonably priced especially for the amount of food that each person got. Just by looking at the menu I could not decide what I wanted because everything sounded so good. I typically like to visit a place a couple of times before I give five stars, but this place definitely earned it. They have great food and great customer service."

The reuben is medium-sized, which I found refreshing since a lot of reubens in this city are freaking huge. The horseradish was very strong, the corned beef was only moderately salty (which I preferred), and the rye held together despite the general wetness of the sandwich. Enjoyable."

I was super hungry and fresh out the pot shop next door when I smelled bacon and followed the scent into this deli. The first thing I thought was that it had to be a front of some sort so I walked back out and looked it up on yelp. I was blown away and decided to go back in.

Well I went with what I like to gauge a deli like this one on (I&#39;m not going to divulge all of my secrets), and happily paid $10+ and left.

Absolutely nothing special here. The portions where equally as small as the taste of the sandwich. I will give it another if I happen by at some point down the line in life, but as for now, my dog is fed and I&#39;m on the way to peseo&#39;s new spot just down the road."

Why is this important? Because I was also sure I wouldn&#39;t want to use the bathroom during the Blind Guardian concert at Studio Seven, and I wouldn&#39;t want to pay $$ for 1 beer or snack.

I stepped in timidly glanced looked at the menu. My boyfriend and I were in the process of whispering &#34;are you sure you want this?&#34; when the cashier urged me to take some more steps in with her award-winning smile. When I told her it will take an incredibly long time, she grinned and acknowledged that sometimes, we all have really important first-world decisions to make. 

You&#39;ll be happy to know that mine was a turkey sandwich that included bacon, and was delicious.

Oh, did I mention they have an awning  ? If you time it juuust right, you&#39;ll be standing in a line for a rock show in the middle of November when it&#39;s 40 degrees out and raining, but you&#39;ll have the protection of the Sodo Deli awning, and the warmth from the door being propped open."

In any case, I actually wrote on my last order &#34;please remember to grill&#34; and they still didn&#39;t do it. On top of that I waited a half hour for it and no one acknowledged me.

Let me address those.  First of all, this place is located next to a bunch of pot shops and warehouses right off the 1st Street off-ramp from the West Seattle bridge.  It&#39;s a part of town most people just drive over or around.  Not worth going out of your way.

Second, the place looks like my grandma&#39;s garage.  It is *filthy*.  There are boxes everywhere, gross looking sticky stuff all over the place.  It is tiny, with limited seating.  You just know that if the place looks this bad out in front, it is worse in the back.

The food barely merits mentioning.  I had the Italian meat trio.  It seriously looks like their supplier is Safeway.  Hormel pepperoni, cheap deli meats, and bread with a 35-year shelf life.  My mom could make a better sandwich than this and she was not the best in the kitchen.  In fact it tastes exactly like what she might have packed me for lunch in 4th grade.  There is just nothing exciting about these sandwiches.

At $13.10 for the sandwich and a bag of chips, you can save 50% by heading north a mile to Jimmy John&#39;s.  They are nothing to rave about either, but it beats this hole.  Better yet, see if there are any food trucks in front of Starbucks Corporate.  That&#39;s where you find the best SoDo food."

We arrived before a 9 hour event in Seattle and had just 45 minutes to find something to eat in the area.  We found this place quickly and parked in the loading zone right in front.  We were able to keep an eye on the car while we enjoyed 2 awesome sandwiches and some mac and cheese.

I got the Honey Mustard Chicken bacon sandwich.  I was actually staring at all the options on the menu when our order taker just suggested it to me.  This would not have been my normal order, but I was convinced by her suggestion.  The honey mustard sauce was quite appropriate and balanced with the chicken and bacon and bread.  The bacon was incorporated into the sandwich, which is what I prefer.  I didn&#39;t have to deal with 6 inch pieces of pork coming out the sides.

Spouse got the meatloaf, but big mistake, she did it her way, instead of Tim&#39;s way.  If you are getting the meatloaf, even though I have never tried Tim&#39;s way, it must be better.  Trust the experts you know.

The mac and cheese was fine as a side, but not really in the same ballpark as the sammies.  I would totally eat here again.  It was fun to find this place."

I had the turkey bacon ranch on gluten free bread, and not only does it taste heavenly, but it&#39;s huge. I can&#39;t actually eat the whole thing in one sitting. I can&#39;t wait to try the other sandwiches, too. 

The good is so yummy and so affordable, sure, but the icing on the cake was how kind they were to myself and my toddler daughter. They were so friendly and understanding, it made my day.

I ordered a breakfast burrito which was pretty much the equivalent of eating a pile of slop wrapped up in a tortilla. It was wet and rather odd tasting. In their defense, one could say it was asinine to go to a deli and order a breakfast burrito, but I couldn&#39;t help my cravings. 

While the $9.00 breakfast burrito was pretty much shit, I won&#39;t write this place off just yet. I&#39;m willing to give it one more shot at some point in the future to try one of their deli sandwiches. Never again on the wet breakfast menu though.

Often times the specials are spectacular. Like the Yankee pot roast which gives me a total Ratatouille experience but across the board everything is solid. Solid but not fancy. It&#39;s like going to someone&#39;s house... Who lives in Georgetown...and is super cool.

I&#39;ve driven by the SODO Deli for years.  They&#39;re located on 1st Ave South in an unassuming building - and to be honest I never ever considered them as a food destination.  But after reading their glowing yelp reviews I decided to give them a shot.

What they lack for in decor - they make up with in their delicious food and warm and friendly customer service.  The menu is standard deli food, plus a daily non menu special... which on my visit happened to be elk stew.  I did not try it, but thought it was an interesting and unusual option.

I was with my partner so we decided to split a meatloaf sandwich done &#39;Tim&#39;s Way&#39;... which is a half pound slice served hot with bacon, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pepperoncini, olives, mayo, mustard, ketchup, pepper jack cheese, on a toasted pub roll and a side of Au Jus.  This sandwich is HUGE and I cannot imagine trying to tackle a whole one on my own.  So delicious! 

We also got a side order of their beer baked mac &amp; cheese... it was unlike any mac &amp; cheese that I&#39;ve had in the past.  It was savory and very, very tasty.

All in all a wonderful and filling experience on a gray and rainy Seattle afternoon.  I&#39;m already narrowing down what I&#39;ll order next time I visit the SODO Deli."

I picked up a hot pastrami today. Wow. The bread was perfect and chewy. Mustard was zingy. Pastrami was salty in the best way with melty cheese... The only thing I could say is maybe lay off of the coleslaw a tad. There is a lot on this sandwich. I mean, they give you a fork with your sandwich.

From the looks of it, it looks kind of run down and dingy.  There is even an old SNES system out on one of the tables.  This is not someplace to take your girlfriend out on a nice date obviously, BUT it does make for a good lunch spot.

Soda is only $0.90 a can!  This is unreal.  And there&#39;s a variety of it too, like Mountain Dew, Coke, Sprite, Crush, Squirt, etc.

The menu is standard deli fare but from the two items I&#39;ve tried, the menu is pretty good.  There are soups, sandwiches, and breakfast items.  

The roast beef sandwich au jus is delicious. The sauce is really good and the bread they use for the sandwich really soaks in the sauce.

I&#39;ve tried the chicken and dumpling soup.  It was okay, full of veggies and some dumplings.  I wouldn&#39;t mind trying their other soups though.

I tried a turkey sandwich here on sourdough bread.  Their bread was ridiculously good and soft.  I was very impressed.

Their breakfast bagel with ham and cream cheese was pretty decent too.  The bagel was actually not a piece of toast (cough rest of Seattle cough) and for $5, it was a teensy bit pricey but still good!

I will definitely be back for some more food."

Buddy had the turkey bacon ranch sandwich for 9 and that looked really good.

Another buddy had the French dip which looked alright, a little skimpy.

You get the sandwich and that is it, so to me it is a bit expensive.

Both memorable items a tasty, however the horseradish spread on sandwich was a bit much on flavour for me - would probably nix it next time - it was okay for the first half but got a little much on second half

You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing! They make it with Manny&#39;s and it&#39;s just sooo good.  Seriously, if Seattle had a Mac and Cheese Off, this place would win.  (And, on a side note, Seattle, we should have a Mac and Cheese Off! Why don&#39;t we? If I build it, will you come?) 

Their sandwiches are great, big enough to save half for later (especially if you&#39;re having it with a cup of the Beer Baked Mac &amp; Cheese, which I already told you that you must!) I special ordered a turkey reuben, because that&#39;s my favorite sandwich, and they made it perfectly, even though it&#39;s not on the menu. Thank you!  

Did you know you can call ahead and pick your order up and bring it into the game? That&#39;s right, why are you paying stadium prices for a hot dog when you can have a SODO Deli Chili Dog - they use their own special chili, none of that stuff from a can. How serious am I about SODO Deli? I keep a copy of their menu in my car so I can call in my order anytime and pick it up about 15 minutes later. 

Or you can eat in, watch some TV, have a Manny&#39;s on tap, if the Mariners are playing they&#39;re showing it, and chat with the incredibly friendly staff, I love that they&#39;ll call you by name once they meet you. 

As a few people have mentioned, it&#39;s a little bit of a &#34;hole in the wall&#34; kind of place. Maybe it&#39;s not a date spot, or maybe you need to find a more laid-back date. It is definitely more of a &#34;down home&#34; kind of place than you usually find in a city. I remember when the small town I came from had places like this, all with the same names as the last names of the kids I went to school with. Now they&#39;re all replaced with Au Bon Pains, Starbucks, and Paneras. Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that, I&#39;m just saying I didn&#39;t go to school with the Starbucks kids or the Panera family. Here at SODO Deli, you feel like you might actually know the staff and their families (at least you see pictures of them hanging up.) 

That&#39;s my kind of place.  Thanks Jan &amp; Tim for keeping it real!"

They are big enough that you won&#39;t be hungry after eating one (if you&#39;re able to finish it), but not so big that you&#39;ll want to share it.

The menu offers a large selection and there are 3 huge refrigerated cases filled with beverage options at low prices for a restaurant (i.e.- cans of soda for 90-cents).  There are also tons of chips to chose from on the rack... far more than I&#39;d expect to see in a chain-store deli.

I ordered a turkey sandwich with an unusual cranberry/cream cheese spread.  Not only did it deliver on flavor, but the sandwich was larger than I expected and the bread was definitely good quality.  Next time, I think I&#39;ll try one of their breakfast burritos, served all day."

This place is a joint, not some overly designed and overly processed spot.  And the owners are top drawer!  They almost always give us complimentary samples of their specials.  And the last time I was in, I waited for my order at my car because it was hot and I didn&#39;t want to leave my dog out there.

They have a chalkboard menu that was utterly confusing to read and figure out, but I was handed a menu to sit down with and decide what I want.  With so many good choices, I asked the lady at the counter what their &#34;signature&#34; sandwich is.  She suggested the Triple Decker or the Meatloaf Sandwich &#34;Tim&#39;s Way&#34;.  I opted for the meatloaf &#34;tims way&#34;. 

A little on the spendy side at $10.50 just for the sandwich.  It is a large and filling sandwich, though.  Want chips?   That&#39;s extra.  Soda?  Extra.  For 10.50 it should, at least, come with a small bag of chips.  The sandwich was good, but I would definitely leave off the the banana peppers next time. They really overwhelm the other flavors of the sandwich that I could hardly taste the 
meatloaf....couldn&#39;t even tell you if it was good meatloaf.

   -- How about a meatloaf sandwich with au jus?  

YES, that&#39;s right ladies and gents; SODO Deli has a French Dip Meatloaf Sandwich with bacon.  I&#39;m warning you ahead of time that it&#39;s a humongous sandwich!  I was full after eating half the sandwich, but it was so good... that I just had to cram the rest of the sandwich down my throat.

I had the pastrami sandwich, which was excellent. My friends had the 3 meat and a breakfast sandwich. Both were big hits, tasty and filling.

Craving a good sandwich yesterday, we returned. I had to try the Meatloaf Tim&#39;s Way - which is definitely an experience. Delicious, but next time I may try the meatloaf sandwich scaled back a bit. The bacon and au jus are on point however. My wife had the honey mustard chicken. This will be our next picnic lunch!  It was so delicious and...nostalgic? It tasted just as I remember a good chicken sandwich should taste. The bread on both sandwiches was fresh and tasty. 

Tim made our sandwiches, and seemed to genuinely care how much we enjoyed them. The lady who worked the counter was also very nice, and had no problems changing up the onions for my wife&#39;s order, explaining &#34;you&#39;ve got to have it exactly like you want it.&#34; Very refreshing attitude, and very kind.

Great deli with all of the snacks and drinks anyone would need during a hard day of work, but what this place is all about is the sandwiches. My coworker and I were about to go to our local sub shop when I decided to jump on yelp and see what else was good around our area. Jumped in the car and was at Sodo Deli in about 5 minutes (even with that horrible Spokane Street craft project going on). Nice deli with newspapers spread out on the tables and South Park playing on the TV (win #1). 

The two guys behind the counter were chill, not snobs nor trying to be super hip. Both of which are an unfortunate trend around these parts. Coworker went for the chicken salad on a croissant, and I went for the meatloaf Tim&#39;s way. Five minutes later we were on our way. 

My coworker was quite pleased with her chicken salad and mentioned that it had walnuts and possibly a bit of nutmeg in it. The meatloaf - Tim&#39;s way was phenomenal.It&#39;s massive, had tons of flavor and even comes with au jus, that had awesome flavor. I only got through half of it but that half alone was a 5 napkin affair.

The sandwiches are massive and messy - just the way I like &#39;em.  I had the Meatloaf - Tim&#39;s way and it was awesome.  It even came with a bowl of &#39;au jus&#39; like a French Dip that I couldn&#39;t really figure out how to take advantage of.  Even without au jus, it was a 3+ napkin affair by the time I was done.

My coworker tried the special - a Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  He loved it, saying it was lightly spicy with a good blue cheese flavor.

Prices are a bit high for lunch, but completely reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food.

Bonus points for:
- a sandwich so good I don&#39;t know if I need to try anything else on the menu
- a menu of stuff that looks good enough I don&#39;t know if I can stick with my current favorite
- Mexican Coke!"

I&#39;ve been here many times since originally reviewing it, and each time has been a 5 star experience, all the way. This place is a classic example of something you might drive by and not think much of at first glance, but what&#39;s inside is pure gold.

Stupidly big, amazingly tasty sandwiches, made with fresh, quality ingredients. Some seriously good chili/soups (Something I often skip when eating out, but not here!). Manny&#39;s on tap (A deli with draft beer? ultimate win). Owned by some of the friendliest folks you&#39;ll come across (Once they know you, they&#39;ll even refer to you by name). On top of that, if dining in, this place feels more like visiting a friend&#39;s house than going out to eat (There&#39;s even a table w/board games and an old Super NES on it - And that goes to show the good taste of the people who run this joint!)

I opted for the sandwich served hot, and while it ended up being warm, that wasn&#39;t a big deal really. The meatloaf had a really nice balance of spice and beef taste and certainly was well done - not burnt nor dry. Moist, juicy, super good.

Just as I was nearing the end of my sandwich, we were brought... cups of chili to try!! It makes me wish I hadn&#39;t been after something light for dinner, because this was some *really* good chili. Chock full of beans, and a nice burn to go with it.

Within a minute my sandwich appeared and I grabbed the bag and ran.
The bread was not marble rye but French or white, which would have been fine except the bread was totally stale, dry, and it ruined the sandwich. The turkey was plentiful and good, but the cranberry cream cheese was way too sweet and lacking in cranberries. 
I have to vent here because one of my biggest pet peeves about so many local sandwich places is the lack of bread quality. I&#39;m convinced they all just grab a few loaves at Costco and think they can pass them off on a $9 sandwich. Seriously..........?

The pork was so flavorful and well cooked, and whether this was on purpose or not, I loved that every bite of the burrito had something different because of the way that it was rolled. It wasn&#39;t the prettiest, picture-perfect burrito that you can see at Chipotle, but my god it is way cheaper and way more delicious. The mole chicken Quesadilla was an 11 on the 1-10 flavor scale. I could literally smell the cocoa that was used to make the mole bombarding my nose when I sat down the eat, it was that fragrant.

If you only have $10 to spend on dinner and you really want a burrito, do not eat here. I virtually never write negative reviews so please take my advice seriously, especially if you are from California and eat at taquerias a lot, such as myself. 

My burrito was so below average, every bite was so boring, that I could not even finish it.  

The salsas were prepackaged in tiny plastic containers. One salsa tasted like baby food, but the baby food salsa actually tasted better than a different salsa option. No free chips.

I felt so very sad that I spent my dinner budget on this burrito. Sad and mad. Although I wasn&#39;t hungry afterward, I felt that my dinner cravings were not properly satiated so I drove around looking for pizza slices.

The atmosphere is no-nonsense and clean, but a bit worn down - it&#39;s clearly never been remodeled since a former life as a fast food chain restaurant. It&#39;s one of the only places on the hill that has parking, too, so that&#39;s nice if you have a car."

We initially thought it was some sort of a national/regional fast food joint. To our surprise, we found that it was actually a tacos place but never really had the time to eat here (well, there are just so many places in Capitol Hill to check out!).

One day, I decided I wanted something  light and thought of stopping by Rancho Bravo Tacos for a quick dinner. I&#39;m glad I did stop by here. This place looks original, more homey/local than, very casual and just offers a good price range for Capitol Hill community. I like that there are just so many different types of people who eat here and it sort of reflects the Capitol Hill community when I first moved here before the recent industry boom that is slowly pricing out some original community who used to live in this neighborhood.

I had their mole chicken and spicy pork tacos. I would say, for less than $3 a taco, this is a pretty awesome deal! The meal was filling and sufficient! I like that it&#39;s super casual...whether you want to eat for lunch, dinner or late night meal after all those partying..this place will satisfy your budget and craving!

P.S. it&#39;s sort of a like a fastfood/hole in a wall, super casual type of place...so if you are looking for fine dining..this isn&#39;t the place!"

Food: 3 stars

Tacos- Good but not great street tacos. We had the steak, chorizo, and carnitas. The carnitas had the most flavor and my personal favorite. The salsa and hot sauce options were delicious and accompanied the tacos well. 3.5 stars 

Pork Tamales- Dry and lacked flavor. 1 star

Bravo burrito- Ordered wet with cheese and was huge! Definitely worth the money. We ordered carnitas and it was cheesy and filled with goodness. 4 stars

Horchata- Too good. If you&#39;ve never tried it you need to. It reminds me of the milk left in the bowl after eating cinnamon toast crunch. 4 stars

Service: 4 stars

It&#39;s been 15 minutes or so of waiting, 4-5 people who ordered after me already got their food, and my friends were already half done with their dinners.

I get a slopped together crispy taco trio that ended up being beef soggy soup because they were so rushed in making up my lost order they didn&#39;t drain the meat and I ended up with 1/2 cup of juices on the bottom of my plate.  

All the shells were soggy, and I looked at my friends soft tacos platter and he had no issues with juice and moisture.

The food was decent but the service was terrible.  No offer to fix anything , just slop toss and hope for the best.

I guess at 2.65 a taco you can&#39;t expect much from the poor white kid in the kitchen obviously in foreign territory.

If you&#39;re drunk, poor, or are just goddamn patient as hell for &#34;fast food&#34; then you come here.

We arrived at around lunch time, I was dropped off a block away to grab ice cream while my husband went to Rancho&#39;s to park and wait for me.  When I arrived I went to the parking lot I noticed that my husband and a couple of his friends still sitting in the parking lot.  One of the employees had come outside and was writing down our plates and complaining out loud about something I could not hear.  At this point my husband tells me he was waiting for my help to unload our kids and the guy came out to yell at him and the other car we were with.  

We repeatedly said we are going to go in and eat, we are just going to unload the kids first,  The guy just yells and points to my ice cream and says you can&#39;t park here if you dont eat here.  Again we state that WE ARE UNLOADING and we will be eating there.  This guys keeps complaining and yelling to the point where my husband just gets everyone in the car and both cars leave.  
As we are leaving the employee just stands there and points at us and mouths bad words at us.  If it wasn&#39;t for my kids in the car I would&#39;ve flip the bird at this rude employee."

It is home to post-bar drunkies and lunch-time college students alike. They recently updated their signage, which means newcomers will actually know how to find it. And dare I say, it looks good! The interior has the same worn, hole-in-the-wall feel. The staff is friendly enough, though like most high traffic places you&#39;ll be expected to know what you want before stepping in line. As for the food, it has all the makings of a great street-style Mexican restaurant. It&#39;s quick, it&#39;s tasty, it skips all the pretense and it gets right down to business. 

So why not five stars? In a word, consistency. Some of their dishes feel more thought out than others. But mostly, it has to do with the large chunks of nondescript fatty-tendon meat that accompanies my order every few times I go there. Sometimes the meat is flavorful and well-trimmed. Other times it feels like you got the scraps every other restaurant would throw out. It&#39;s not a fun surprise when biting into a burrito or taking a bite of pasole and getting a huge chunk of fat, or worse something unchewable. My latest order had to be thrown out altogether.

The quality of meat likely contributes to their low prices, but to me it&#39;s starting to become a risk I&#39;d rather not take. I&#39;d be happy to go on the regular if they can get this under control."

You&#39;re probably the most authentic Mexican food Seattle&#39;s got to offer. Your tacos are larger and pricier than traditional street style, so I will make sure to only order 2 next time so to not spend $14 on TACOS (!). Your horchata is not too sweet, not too grainy and you have all of the salsas - including avocado salsa. Thank you, thank you.

I&#39;m wondering if this is just a Seattle thing that puts the standard of Mexican food really low.  Having lived in Chicago, there are so many Mexican places that deliver phenomenal food for extremely cheap.  

Of several highly rated Mexican joints in Seattleland, I have always been very underwhelmed.  This place is no exception.  It just seemed bland and plain.  The cheap price makes it nice for a quick snack I suppose.. I only sampled some of the tacos as a way to gauge the rest of the items.  The green sauce is nice.

So I&#39;ve heard good reviews from friends and recommendations from coworkers. I finally found it! I got the Torta (sandwich) with carne asada, lettuce, tomato, mayo, jalapeño slices, with a side of hot sauce and a little sour cream. 
The bread: toasted, soft, easy bite, doesn&#39;t make the sandwich fall apart. Delicious by itself. 
The carne asada: seasoned really well, I ate some that fell onto my plate and by itself, really yummy, and not over cooked! 
The size of the sandwich is a good portion, I just ate half heh, and I&#39;m ready for the second half! I love spicy food so I&#39;d get some hot and medium sauce before I take it to go! 
And it&#39;s not too heavy on the mayo either, which is great because it feels a lil healthy and a lil splurge lunch. Definitely going to come back on my breaks at work! 
I think the service and hospitality can use some work, but I understand lunch hour is a tough time!"

Why? Because there are no signs outside, no theme, and I never seemed to see people in it.

But this one particular night over the weekend when I needed food STAT, I passed a stranger walking by and asked what recommendations he had... he said Rancho Bravo. So naturally, I listened to this stranger and hoped for the best!

I walked in, asked for the two most popular items on the menu, and was given a burrito and three tacos (Creative, I know). That was that.  

These things were deeeelicioso! Very flavorful, and the sauces/salsas they have ready to go are special stuff. 

Good fix to cure my hangriness. You know what that means!!"

Tacos are on point. Super interesting crowd inside: rich, poor, homeless, canine, blue collar, release worker, baby; doesn&#39;t matter who you are, everyone loves Rancho.

I walked into a fast food looking eatery because I saw tons of people in line for their food at around 6 pm on a Saturday night (there&#39;s no sign outside or anything to indicate that this is a taco place). I was absolutely ecstatic to find out that this is a a brick and mortar taco joint for a taco truck. 

I&#39;m bummed that I didn&#39;t get to try the horchata which people rave about here on Yelp. Their overall menu is quite large for a &#34;taco truck&#34; and I wish I had more time to look through the menu. Although the line was long, it moved fairly quickly and the cashier was not very patient or helpful. They give you a number and will call it out just like a Taco Bell or McDonalds.  

I ended up ordering a chicken, steak, and spicy pork taco and the bill came out to be $7.75. The food came out so quickly and I loved that they had all the salsas (NOTE: green is hot, red is mild), napkins, and eating utensils out on the counter. I loved both the chicken and the spicy pork tacos but the steak taco was literally dripping with grease. I didn&#39;t get a lot of greens on any of my tacos so it felt like all I was eating was meat in tortillas. They were very generous with the lime though; a lime slice per taco. The three tacos were great for a light dinner but the next time I go, I&#39;ll be ordering more and asking for lots of veggies.  

I will most likely be back because there is a super authentic taste to the food and I NEED to try their horchata. But with Taco Chuki&#39;s so close, where the tacos are slightly cheaper and come with pineapple and guac (3 beautiful tacos and a Mexican Coke for a total of $8), I&#39;ll probably want to make the trek over there."

Even on busy nights there is available seating because service is so quick and people rotate in and out of here regularly. They have an outdoor patio for warmer months, too.

Yes, the seating area is grimy.  Yes, there are probably things that have happened in the kitchen that I don&#39;t want to know about.

Not that it makes it better to be anything short of immaculate when handling consumables, but I&#39;m a fan of the open kitchen setup since it&#39;s clearly not as grimy where food prep is happening.

This place is CRAZY at night! The line is long, but it moves fairly quickly. But it&#39;s jam packed. Everyone craves tacos at 2 am in the morning apparently. I got three tacos and a large horchata and my friends ordered burritos. Unfortunately, the tacos got soggy on the way home, so they weren&#39;t as tasty as I had hoped, but the horchata was tasty! I was craving it for awhile, so I&#39;m glad that satisfied my craving. Prices are affordable, like it was $1.50 for a taco or something cheap, and burritos were $6?

It&#39;s somewhat of a gut bomb but in terms of flavor their burritos are some of the cities best.  

I order the mole chicken burrito which isn&#39;t on the menu but I like the combination of the mole chicken added in with the beans and rice.

It was my first time in Seattle and I had a great night of exploring the town and getting thoroughly sloshed at all the great bars. Like any other morning i rolled out of bed around 11 swearing that I would never drink again. After getting several recommendations I went to Rancho Bravo. 

I can without a doubt say this is the worst burrito I&#39;ve had in years. First off, the size. A burrito should be large enough to fill you entirely and make you feel disgusted in yourself. I can not say that this burrito did either. It was like that old Woody Allen quote, &#34;Boy, the food at this place is really terrible.&#34; The other one says, &#34;Yeah, I know; and such small portions.&#34; 

They used black beans instead of refried beans and it was cold!  The shredded &#34;cheese&#34; wasn&#39;t even melted. The soggy carnitas were localized entirely one part of the burrito. 

Really just awful"

wonderful staff:
r e m e m b e r   t o   t i p   t h e m ! !

moving from Texas i didn&#39;t think i would find any mexican food in seattle that rose to the occasion, but rancho bravo does just that.

the burritos are huge and filling, the tacos are fresh (topped with your choice of meat, raw onion, cilantro, and radish with a side of lime) and refreshing, the tamales are always moist and dense, a simple flavour but very satisfying - try the cheese, and the nachos are always crispy and fully topped. they also have an array of fantastic home made salsas (1 mild, 1 medium, 2 spicy)!

you seriously can&#39;t find this kind of food for this price very often.

best meat &amp; bean combo you can have on all of their dishes is mole chicken and black beans. try the bravo burrito (better innards than the rancho burrito imho) with mole and black beans. the mole sauce on the chicken wets the rice just enough to make for the perfect greasy burrito. grab a bunch of napkins and wet naps, and remember to bus your table!

sometimes the crowd here is obnoxious af, the usual Basic pike/pine crowd. when you go just remember to be extra kind to the staff, the people they have to deal with can be rude and holier than thou if the cashier doesn&#39;t speak completely fluent english, so try and balance that out by being decent.

the one (thumbs down emoji) of the rancho perfection is the occasional downside of their extreme quick speeds. they very occasionally give you the wrong meat. if you come back within the week (like if you&#39;re taking to-go) and tell the manager / whomever, they will credit you back $$ and you&#39;ll get that burrito money back $$"

Quickest and cheapest late night eats on the hill besides Dicks AND they have a liquor license to serve beer and wine. I eat here roughly 5 times a month and never regret it: before class, after work, dinner, quick bite, or drunk munchies, it provides for all occasions.

Tacos are classic: double corn tortilla, meat, onion, cilantro, and radish. Burritos are a good value, but I am not a fan of the jack cheese on the inside.....salsas are flavorful (four or five  choices), but may I recommend the Taquitos? Skip the mole, most everything else is great. 

It&#39;s usually a packed house on Friday/Saturday nights with sloppy drunk folk, all way overdressed to be in this old burger king, but even then the service is still quick. As others have written, not a place to go out of your way to visit in this city&#39;s abundance of choices, but odds are it will find you before long."

the sandwiches are all priced the same at almost $8 and fries were almost $2. fries come with pesto sprinkled on top and a creamy pesto aioli dip, delicious but a bit too rich for me. 

the sandwich alone was more than filling, kinda got food coma after.

i had the ground beef byrek another time and it was alright, came with yogurt to dip. i think it would&#39;ve been really good had it been freshly made and not just reheated.

i&#39;ll stick with the sandwiches!

i will definitely be back here more than a few times as it is fairly priced and tastes amazing. i want to try out all the sandwiches though i kinda want to stick with the pork one. 

sandwiches are made fresh so expect a little wait. the cashier/servers are friendly and will always bring out your order to you.

it was filled with a good amount of diners when i got here during lunchtime and then there started to be a line so come right when you can at lunch!

When I first heard that this newly opened cafe offered Mediterranan food, my initial thought was gyros and hummus. But I was wrong - and I&#39;m sure glad I was!

I was intrigued by everything on the menu, so I went big and ordered the chicken &amp; pesto baguette sandwich, a potato byrek and two of their jam filled cookies. While I was waiting, the (incredibly cute) owner explained to me that she prepares all of the byreks at home then brings them into the cafe to be baked on a daily basis. She also mentioned that everything (besides the baguettes) is homemade, including the french fries and specialty sauces that are served inside the sandwiches. She even gave me an extra cookie to try while I waited for my food! 

Although the chicken &amp; pesto baguette was simple, it was incredibly delicious. Inside was moist chicken breast, homemade pesto/garlic aioli, fresh red peppers and arugula. The baguette was fresh, lightly toasted and the perfect piece to complete the sandwich. As for the byrek, no words can describe how delightful this pastry was! It&#39;s usually made with flour and phyllo dough, giving it a thin, flakey exterior and a soft, chewy interior. I wasn&#39;t entirely impressed with the cookies, but was more than appreciative for the opportunity to try them! They dough was quite dry and I would have preferred more jam filling.

As a newcomer to Mediterranean food, I had a lot to learn. I can&#39;t wait to make another visit to try the other byreks &amp; baguettes!"

I happened onto it while walking around the Seattle University in search of somewhere to grab dinner outside of my hotel. I got the beef byrek and the leek one. OMG, are they ever delicious! The pastry is tender and flakey and the fillings are beautifully seasoned and savory. I&#39;m thinking of taking a dozen back to the Bay Area with me.

The service was incredibly friendly as well, though they did seem to struggle with the idea that I wanted a to-go order, but it mostly worked out. I was disappointed that the baguette I ordered for breakfast tomorrow came sliced, toasted, and already smeared with butter and jam. I hadn&#39;t thought to ask for it on the side. But I expect 30 seconds in the microwave will make it all okay. I&#39;ll know better next time. And there will definitely be a next time."

Let me start off with the cons. Personally, their byrek menu is really lacking to me because I&#39;m not a fan of a lot of their ingredients that they use in their byreks. I tried the beef, tomatoes, and onion byrek once, and I wasn&#39;t too impressed, so I&#39;ve stayed away from their byreks.

I also am not a huge fan of cold sandwiches, which is what they&#39;ve always had before. I tried the chicken pesto one time, and the sauce was too overpowering to me, and I wasn&#39;t impressed as well.

Finally, I don&#39;t think their breakfast sandwiches are worth the $7+. The bread is simply sliced white bread. I had the bacon breakfast sandwich, and the inclusion of tomatoes was really weird and didn&#39;t work well. I didn&#39;t find the goat cheese to be that palatable. I did appreciate a fried egg versus scrambled. I think they should probably stick to lunch.

HOWEVER, despite all of that, what has kept me coming back and deserves the four stars all on its own are their AMAZING garlic fries. I don&#39;t know what they do to those fries (probably add crack in them), but they are so addictive. They&#39;re crispy, flavorful, and the garlic drizzle (or whatever it is) is just to die for.

Also, recently, they added a new roasted pork sandwich that is hot. It was amazing as well, and I&#39;m so happy they have a hot sandwich now. The roasted pork sandwich paired with garlic fries is seriously one of the best meals you can get near Seattle U."

Let me start by saying I&#39;ve been there twice (today and last week) and the food is excellent. My first time going, I chatted it up with the owner and told her I never had a byrek before and wasn&#39;t sure what it was. She had some that just came out of the oven and offered me one to taste. It was delicious! I wound up ordering a chicken, apple and walnut salad, which was good as well. Also, the owner, Natalia (I think), was SO NICE. We had a nice little conversation while I was waiting for my salad, and today she recognized me and came to say hello and ask how my day was. Which is why it pains me to have to give a low review. If it wasn&#39;t for today&#39;s incident, I would be giving this at least 4 stars. 

The other day a classmate came in with a veggie sandwich that looked amazing, so I stopped in today to get one before class. On the menu, it listed one of the ingredients an olive and feta mix or spread. So I asked the girl at the counter (who wasn&#39;t the owner) if the feta was pasteurized or unpasteurized. She turned around and asked the cook, who I could both see and hear from where I was at the counter. I heard him tell her &#34;just tell her it&#39;s pasteurized.&#34; I asked her to please ask him if he was sure about that and that the reason I was asking is because I&#39;m pregnant and can&#39;t have unpasteurized cheese. She again turned around and asked him if he was sure because I can&#39;t have unpasteurized cheese. Since I knew he could hear me from where I was standing, I yelled out &#34;yeah I can&#39;t have it because I&#39;m pregnant and you wouldn&#39;t want to be responsible for killing my child.&#34; Dramatic, yes, but I don&#39;t care. This is my first child and I want to be very careful about what I&#39;m putting into my body. Even if I WASN&#39;T pregnant, I&#39;m the customer and if I ask a simple question, and I&#39;m paying you money, I&#39;d really like an answer. If he had said &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;, it would&#39;ve been fine, but don&#39;t tell me something just to make me go away. The girl at the counter asked the cook if she should just go back and check and the cook kind of just gave her a look. She was at least kind enough to check for me. However, even after the mystery had been solved, I could see and hear the cook turn to the owner and mention the pasteurized v. unpasteurized question to the owner. Look, if you&#39;re not willing to provide good customer service, perhaps don&#39;t work in service industry.

As I said before, it&#39;s unfortunate that I have to rate it at one star based on the assholiness of the cook, especially since the food was delicious and the owner is amazing. 

Natalia, if you&#39;re reading this, I&#39;m sorry! I think you&#39;re lovely and your food is amazing. I will probably still eat here but at the Bellevue location."

My husband has countless times tried to replicate his mother&#39;s and grandmother&#39;s homemade yogurt at our apartment using Tupperware and a fleece blanket (just go with it) and countless times it has come up lacking... Byrek &amp; Baguette makes a silky hybrid of sweet cream butter and what we &#39;Mericans know to be &#34;yogurt&#34;; with perfect elasticity and oh-so-subtle tartness it is divinely transported on a raft of byrek, from ramekin to mouth.

I&#39;m not Albanian, and I truly did not understand the hype coming from my husband and mutual Albanian friends about byrek. It is a labor of love. It is slow food. It is SOUL food.

I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s impossible not to feel immediately like you haven&#39;t eaten proper food in years. And unlike a lot of places, the delicious aroma isn&#39;t just a front: I&#39;ve now tried two types of byrek (leek and beef) and the flavor does absolute justice to the smell. Though I&#39;m generally not a huge pastry dough fan, the byrek were light enough and crisp enough to win me over. The woman in the front who rang me up (and was making the next batch of byrek, apparently) even convinced me to try one of their sweet cookie things. Not sure what they&#39;re called, but they remind me of a lot of German and Dutch desserts. Also really good.

The sandwiches are good but nothing special. Like homemade. However, if you live or work in the area, this place is extremely convenient. Grab a 1/2 sandwich ($3.99) and that thing you forgot to pick up at the store all at one place. 

Every time I walked by and looked through the windows I assumed it was just a convenience store. They have all the usual things a gas station convenience store might have. To my surprise, they also have a fully stocked deli and ample seating. The seating is the type I like - a few tables out in the open, but also barstool seating in singles and pairs along the windows so you can find a nook to hide in. It was not too busy when I went (around 11), but the man working there said it gets busy at lunch and told me I could call in my order for pickup in the future. Good to know. Even though it was not busy, the process of ordering and waiting for my sandwiches was a bit long. I could see this becoming an issue during busy lunch hours. 

Though a bit slow, the service overall is great. This place is owned by a super kind family. You can tell they really value their customers and work hard at their business. They offer free WiFi and even have loyalty/stamp cards (buy 10 sandwiches, get one free!). 

The sandwiches:

They offer 1/2 ($3.99) and full ($6.99) sandwiches. The 1/2 sandwich is plenty for one, but I wanted to get 2 halves just to try a variety. Being a pretty standard deli, there is really nothing &#34;special&#34; here. That also means no special vegetarian options. They have a &#34;veggie lovers&#34; option with &#34;mustard, tomato, lettuce, onion, green peppers, and pickles&#34; and you could also build your own with whatever cheese/veggies. It is a bit disappointing that the veggie option is the same price as the other sandwiches, considering it must be much cheaper for them to make (virtually the same as other meat sandwiches but without the meat). To be fair, how much cheaper can you expect when the 1/2 is already only $3.99. 

I ordered the jerk turkey club on rye and the &#34;Sounder&#34; on sourdough. Both were good. Not amazing. Nothing worth travelling out of the way for, but better than Subway. The &#34;Sounder&#34; was considerably larger than the jerk turkey club. I would opt to build my own in the future, as they were both missing something. Needed something spicy or tangy... they were a bit bland. 

Overall, I&#39;m a fan. Kind service, inexpensive sandwiches, and access to convenience store items all wrapped up in one place. Since I live so close, I know I will be back."

These guys are knocking it out of the park with sandwiches.  I was in here the other day and had an Italiano and was blown away and this morning had a breakfast sandwich with cage free eggs cracked right in front of me. Guess you can&#39;t go wrong when all you are serving is Boars Head.

First off, it&#39;s a nice and clean establishment. Very pleasant to the eyes. Secondly, fantastic and friendly service. The man that checked me out was very sweet, asked my name, if I was from the area, and if I had been in before. He introduced himself, gave me a stamp card, and a menu to take back to my office. 
I love that it really is a market, everything from soda to wine, chips to Tylenol, headphones to hardboiled eggs - anything you could need. 
I ordered the Stella 1 Combo and it was delicious. All of the ingredients seemed very fresh and they made the sandwich right in front of me. It is within walking distance of my office so I will definitely be back for lunch and likely some midday snack visits. It&#39;s a fantastic little place that I will recommend to any coworkers looking for somewhere new to eat."

This is a wonderful gem hidden away in Lower Queen Anne, and with comparable sandwiches nearby selling for $11+, it is a godsend. I walked passed this place so many times and never went in, but the day I did...  I&#39;m there every week.

Pro tips:  get a frequent buyer card, and have them put your breakfast sandwich in a croissant for ultimate delicious unhealthy points.

For that review complaining about the accents--you&#39;re a joke.  &#34;They don&#39;t talk American enough, I don&#39;t understand them, therefore I don&#39;t like them.&#34;  There are so many things wrong with that type of sentiment it boggles the mind.  This is a great place run by nice people with a pride in what they do.  That in and of itself is worth checking out."

They were both in the deli area, and while I waited for at least 5 minutes by the cashier to purchase my one item (it would&#39;ve taken 30 seconds for them to do so), they did not acknowledge me. I probably could&#39;ve taken the item without paying and they would&#39;ve never noticed. I eventually gave up and left, and will go back to Safeway since they actually help their customers. I understand that they had someone waiting for a sandwich, but you also have customers not wanting the deli and they shouldn&#39;t be treated differently."

A win for us was that it was one of the cafes open before 9am so we were able to snag breakfast and start our day early.

The menu has a lot of good options for vegetarians, but unfortunately like most other cafes, didn&#39;t have much for folks with gluten or dairy sensitivities. Was hoping they would have fruit (bananas or apples) or a fruit cup on the menu, but didnt see these available.  I&#39;m thinking the Nonni almond biscotti in the front display is wheat free, so this may be the way to go if you&#39;re in this category.

Ended up ordering the Brussel sprout quiche (has cheese and crust) which was delicious and would recommend it, as well as an almond milk latte.

The coffee itself was tasty, and perfectly adequate without knocking me off my feet - not too burnt, not too light-bodied, and well-balanced.

The gal working that afternoon was very pleasant and laid-back. I got myself a nice vanilla latte and the banana bread with chocolate chips (and walnut?). Great stuff! I had the BB on a plate with fork. It&#39;s a bit clunky/messy to eat but no big. The place has a nice feel and air; perhaps the cracked open sliding window helped that out, too.

A small thing I didn&#39;t like was the bright afternoon sun shining inside; even more-so when you&#39;re next/over to the metal steel-top table. Perhaps she/we just forgot to ask to roll down the blinds...

The handwritten cups are very well done, too - icing on the cake! I never judge a place by these extra touches but the rare times they are done, it&#39;s really awesome.

Situated at the top of a block-long cluster of small businesses (including TWO Pilates studios), Katy&#39;s is an intimate and warm refuge.

It&#39;s definitely not big, but it feels very homey and at ease. You&#39;ve got the choice of sitting on stools at a counter by the windows, or on some comfy, well-used (but clean!) couches. If the weather&#39;s nice there&#39;s outdoor seating as well! Pets are welcome-- there&#39;s even a huge jar of treats-- and it&#39;s easy to strike up conversations with fellow coffee-sippers and dog lovers there. The baristas make the drinks in a quick and friendly fashion. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that their reasonably-priced pastries aren&#39;t too sweet, but still very satisfying when accompanied by a steaming latte. Overhead music is limited to a nice background volume.

I am knocking one star off for no gluten free food options and another for the powdered chai mix that is weak flavored and the top two ingredients are sugar and milk. I forgot to check if the cocoa in my kids&#39; drink had milk or not. As a dairy-free and gluten free family we are always challenged by our needs. Our sweet barista didn&#39;t know that the chai had dairy until I asked and she read the label. (I could taste it.)

When I walked in, there were a few people sitting, doing work, or talking over their beverages and pastries. The girl behind the counter was busy scraping a slice of their quiche from a pan. She proceeded to put it on a dirty plate and then into a microwave....still not acknowledging my  presence. After the quiche was cooked and then delivered she then greeted me and asked for my order. I ordered a 16oz  triple americano. It took a while to get for whatever reason and then it was watered down....even after adding the extra shot.

The only reason I did include this, is that the whole vibe the guy gave us was they clearly did not care that you existed it was actually an annoyance that you were in his shop.

And when I walked in there was about 7 spots taken, the only two left were right up against the espresso machine and I had this bad feeling that the place was kind of pretentious.  There was also a young child scurrying around.  But my first impressions were a bit premature.  My spot cozied up against the espresso machine was not bad at all, I was not forced to awkwardly catch glances with the barista as I expected.  And the young child was nowhere near as wild and rambunctious as I expected him to be.  He was quite precious, kept to himself, and had an infectious personality.  I didn&#39;t feel like I couldn&#39;t do my work because he was there.  And the boy&#39;s relationship with his barista mother (I think?) was really sweet to catch glimpses of.  So all in all, a productive environment for me to work in even though I imagine there will be times that I walk in and there&#39;s no room for me.  But I noticed that in the two hours I was there the place filled and emptied multiple times.  I remained the only constant (apart from the barista) for a solid 2 hours.  

I had a breakfast bagel and it was pretty good.  And a lemon cookie for dessert which was even better.  In fact, I would say maybe the worst part about this place is that they MAKE FRESH COOKIES RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!!!! and seriously how does someone say no to fresh baked cookies? yeah, it&#39;s impossible. I tried.  I had a vanilla latte as well (half-sweet) and it was just to my liking.  I will absolutely come back to this place in the future and kind of like that it seems to be hidden."

I&#39;m mad at myself for not being better about visiting her more often! After Starbucks chose to close their location inside the Madison and 22nd Ave. Safeway, I began making more of an effort to go to Katy&#39;s when I need an afternoon pick up.

I have to agree with some of the other Yelp reviews that say the coffee beverages can sometimes be inconsistent, but I would also say that you are more than welcome to ask a barista about remaking it. I&#39;ve ordered a Chai in the past and when one of the employees wasn&#39;t sure it was &#34;up to standard&#34; offered to re-make the drink for me, just like Starbucks corporate policy.

Anyway, I like Katy&#39;s because it helps me feel connected to my community. If I come in on a Saturday or a Sunday morning, the crowd is eclectic and you&#39;ll see a dog or two along with young parents and children, a few neighborhood old timers and also Katy herself works the morning shift behind the counter. She remembers my name, even when I haven&#39;t been in for a few weeks. It&#39;s really nice that she knows her customers so well.

I haven&#39;t tried the white coffee, but it sure seems popular. My favorite drink is the caramel latte, which can be made with the indulgent caramel sauce instead of your standard flavoring syrup. I also like the quiche, savory muffins and sweet coconut cookies and coffeecake that are all baked right in the shop.

In the past I&#39;ve tried the brunch and the breakfast sandwich, which I really like. It&#39;s a good value at $4.25.

If you are using a credit/debit card, be warned there is a $5 minimum or a small charge. Most people do not seem to mind.

Katy&#39;s also includes tax in all her prices, which I like so much as they are nice rounded numbers and make figuring out your total,etc. easy. No penny hunting!"

The owner&#39;s child was running around jumping up on high chairs which made me a little nervous.

Literally, every single time I walk in, the barista&#39;s friends are crowded on the opposite side of the friend yelling to them, and I have to sidestep around their conversation to get a word in edgewise. Really, at different times of the day, different days of the week.
Every single time, the barista was caught up in their own very important LOUD conversation.
 
I know it&#39;s a small place, but I expect baristas at the very least to be at least a little bit friendly, and not act so annoyed that I&#39;m interrupting their conversation. If I wanted to be ignored by teenagers I would go to the food court at the mall.

1. White coffee takes some getting used to. Actually, I am enjoying one right now. . .kinda. Its got an earthy, almost tea-like flavor. 

2. Katy&#39;s is small. There is a loveseat and a couple of tables for wi-fi. That being said, if you are there by your lonesome - great place to work and study with welcoming baristas.

3. Katy just had a baby! Congrats!

4. There is a brunch deal on Sundays from 10:30-12:30, where Katy (yes, the real Katy) offers homemade pastries, eggs, coffee, etc. All you can eat for $12/$14 (the price difference is based on whether you have drip or espresso). I will be back for this once Katy is back from maternity!"

Their brunch on Sundays smells fantastic, though I&#39;ve not indulged yet.

The coffee is good.  I always get an iced vanilla latte, which I&#39;ve been pleased with every visit.  It is reasonably priced, as well.  At Tougo, which is just a block up, you&#39;ll pay a dollar more for the equivalent size.

I haven&#39;t tried any of the food, though I intend to one day.  The last time I was in, they were baking some blueberry walnut wonderful sugary thing that smelled up the whole place and filled my mouth with saliva.

It&#39;s a comfortable place to sit and relax, enjoy your coffee, flip through a book, a Stranger, or Seattle Weekly (the latter two publications can be found right outside the cafe).  During the hot spell the other week, they had the large windows pulled open, the ceiling fan on, and a very nice breeze circulated through the building, making it--when one considers the coffee, as well--a perfect pit stop on a scorching day.

One of the biggest draws is the friendly staff.  I&#39;ve had several different people serve me coffee, and all of them have been friendly.  Beyond friendly, actually.  If you believe that you&#39;ve been treated rudely, it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re a bastard.  I&#39;m that sure of it.

Stop by for a coffee.  Maybe I&#39;ll see ya there.

Edited to add:  I have managed to grab a bite at Katy&#39;s once or twice since writing this review.  I&#39;ve had the tuna sandwich and the turkey club, both of which were good and very fresh.  My companions seemed to agree.  And I&#39;m still coming back nearly every day for the coffee, so they must be doing something right."

They also have fresh, homemade baked goods, sweet and savory, every day.

Other than Sureshot in the University district, this is the only place I know of in Seattle that offers it. It&#39;s beans that aren&#39;t as fully roasted, so they have significantly more caffeine.

The flavor is much more mild, though, so if you order it make sure you get it with flavored syrup or it&#39;ll be really bland. I remember Sureshot having mentioned that but they only offer it in conjunction with syrup and I forgot, so I ordered one without syrup and it was like drinking heavily caffeinated soymilk."

As with most other restaurants, they&#39;re not super busy for the first few hours of the day so if, like us, you&#39;ve got kids that are up at 6 am no matter the day of the week, this is a wonderful early-ish morning spot for some great weekend breakfast!

We came over at around 8:45 and found plenty of seating for us and some friends. The seating options include a couple large tables, tons of 2-4 person spots and lots of room for your four legged friends if you so desire.

The crumpets and crumpwiches (You guessed it, a crumpet sandwich!) are the focal point of the menu and they were delicious! I don&#39;t believe we&#39;d actually had crumpets before this visit, but we will search them out now. It was like a griddle cake and an english muffin had a magical baby that now graces your plate. The options for crumpet toppings run the gamut from sweet to savory - between 8 of us, including 4 kids, we sampled 7 or 8 different types. Standouts were the Beecher and Berry, the PB and Banana and the Duck Confit with Shallots. The lemon and coconut, as well as the pumpkin pie were good not great, but certainly worth trying. The duck confit crumpet was marvelous - delicious meat placed gracefully atop said crumpet, just begging to be enjoyed - and it was!

The ham, egg and cheese crumpwich as well as the BLT were both divine. The dijonnaise sauce on both was hollandaise-esk and really elevated both sandwiches. We found they could be cut nicely into about 6 pieces, giving everyone a chance to experience the mouth party that was thrown after biting into these crumptastic treats!

The coffee offerings were equally great. I had a honey latte (Boss), a friend had a Cafe Miel (Latte w/ honey and Cinnamon) and my best half had a the Royal Hot Chocolate (Chocolate, Vanilla and Honey). The RHC may have been the best thing I&#39;ve ever had to drink. The flavors were unreal and even sipping on it a few hours later (post Science Center), it was still amazing. It&#39;s the sort of thing we&#39;re going to try to replicate, but likely will just be driven back for more of the original!

If we lived closer, this would be a once per week spot. if you&#39;re around, you need to check it out. Your taste buds will thank you!"

Right away, the cafe was cozy and inviting because of the nice interior and color palette. The location was also good with plenty of street parking. 

I ordered the ham and cheese crumpwich (crumpet sandwich). I liked it, but didn&#39;t absolutely love it. Everything was good but the crumpet buns could have been a little less greasy. But still delicious! My friend ordered the avocado caprese crumpet (I think) and said she liked it. 

I ordered some hot green tea which was lovely and the cup and saucer were soooo darling! Like I was in a cute tea shop. 

The service was also great and food came out quickly.

The place is a coffee shop so seating is first come first serve. If you don&#39;t mind sharing a table, you can always sit down in one of those big ones.

Now on to the star which is the crumpets. A crumpet as explained to us was a cross between a biscuit and pancake. I find the texture more like a really thick pancake. I didn&#39;t like my jerk chicken crumpwich as it was not spicy but rather sweet. Unless you like to eat sweet jerk chicken, I would recommend you NOT order that.  My boyfriend ordered the BLT which looked really good. I also tried their Caramel Chocolate S&#39;more crumpets which was really sweet. It would go well with the coffee.

I would definitely come back again and try some of their other crumpets and crumpwiches or just hang out and chill."

Perfect for an afternoon meetup or even a great spot for getting your work done with their free wifi and beautiful cafe space (outdoor seating as well as tons of tables inside). There is also a restroom for your convenience. My friend and I came here for breakfast, which basically turned out to be a light brekkie snack before our real lunch. I&#39;d say this place makes most sense as a &#34;midday snack&#34; or &#34;I need to eat something light because I partied too hard last night and I just want something small.&#34; 

I had the salmon crumpet (savory) and a berries and cream crumpet (sweet), since I wanted two opposite flavor profiles. I liked the berry one better because the flavoring was all there AND they don&#39;t use nuts (allergy yelpers, unite!) in their oats/granola. The salmon was yummy, but there was too much cream cheese spread on the bread base, however they were both delicious.

The vibes are very clean and filled with natural light/or clouds, and every staff member was so sweet and polite! It&#39;s a bus-yourself kind of place that plays GREAT cafe music from Leon Bridges to Gallant. A+ on music choices. We also noticed that some customers biked here, which makes for a check yes on bike racks as well.

I think Queen Bee has a lot going for it, but I&#39;d love it if the crumpets were also included with optional +$1 or +$2 add ons like the crumpwiches were. Chips or a salad...or a biscuit. Just an idea, but I really enjoyed our morning stop by this cute place."

After getting in town was craving something healthyish aka I just wanted a salad to refuel my soul. Decided to walk here from my friends house and did not regret it one bit! I got the Smoked Salmon Caesar salad.  The salmon was so good, and simply.  Now the best part of the salad, I know kind of odd, were the croutons.  They have to be made in house, they were seasoned to perfection and softly crunchy. 

Next up was a peanut butter &amp; banana crumpet, by the way they are baked fresh daily. Not sure what the true definition of this crumpet that they speak of, I would define it as heaven served to you on a plate!  It so fluffy and the honey that is glazed of top please tell me it&#39;s local because I have to buy some!  It was so naturally sweet, not processed tasting at all.  

Would highly recommend this place. Chill vibe, great service and amazing food"

I really don&#39;t know the difference, but whatever magical crumpet spell Queen Bee has put in those amazing little breakfast treats, I&#39;m hooked! Not only are they so many crumpet flavors, but its super inexpensive ($5 for a savory crumpet and around $4 for sweet) and surprisingly filling. They also donate 100% of its profits which is just mind-boggling.

Turkey Pot Pie Crumpet (mushrooms, carrot and celery in a creamy garlic and thyme sauce)- If you are looking for a savory crumpet this is the way to go! Amazing if the most juicy and tender turkey pot pie exploded and all its ooey gooey goodness came tumbling out for your pleasure. Well basically that&#39;s this dish, but so much more because of the delicate and tasty crumpet lurking under all this goodness. It&#39;s lit. 

Smoked Salmon (pesto cream cheese, capers, arugula and lemon)-  Now if you are a fan of a lox bagel then you will certainly enjoy this crumpet. You really get to taste the crumpet texture better with this dish but its still packed with a bunch of tasty flavors. You have the creamy but nutty pesto cream cheese, the salty capers and the spicy arugula and paired with the zesty lemon....OMG. It&#39;s so delicate but will slap your taste buds into submission. 

NOW let me take a deep breath before I explain this next one...*clinches lips*

You must get the Blackberry Crumble sweet crumpet. Not to share, it deserves your full attention and consideration. Savor the cinnamon-vanilla glaze. Be gentle with the warm and tasty maple crumble. But respect the hand whipped cream that at first you may just want to spread it all over your face, but hold out and enjoy it with each bite. It&#39;s sickening actually how damn good this crumpet is. 

Besides its amazing food, this place has great customer service, Wi-Fi and an ample amount of outlets to charge your phone. You can come to have some coffee and a crumpet while you study or just come in stuff your face and fall asleep like I unashamedly did."

Their café is inviting and spacious, with a couple of larger tables that can definitely be communal. It also seems like a popular spot to get some work done as there were several customers working on their laptop. Would&#39;ve been a great place to study if I was still in school!

My friend and I each decided on two crumpets, one sweet and one savory. I ordered the Blackberry Crumble and Smoked Salmon crumpet. My friend was dying to try the Duck Confit, but unfortunately it wasn&#39;t going to be ready until later on in the day. (We arrived around 11 a.m. and this place has been opened since 7.) So she also went with the Smoked Salmon but picked the Banana Cream Pie for her sweet crumpet. 

The Smoked Salmon crumpet was topped with a savory pesto cream cheese, arugula, capers, and (of course) a nice slice of smoked salmon. Definitely recommend if you like those &#34;lox&#34; dishes. As for the Blackberry Crumble, it was topped with a maple crumble and cold whipped cream...kind of an amazing texture altogether to have the warm and cold and soft and somewhat crunchy in one bite. The Banana Cream Pie Crumpet, it was a simple combination of custard, bananas, and whipped cream. 

Nice place to enjoy a cup of joe. Our choice of beverage that day was their Spanish Honey Coffee, with a layer of honey at the bottom of the mug, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and steamed milk to top it all off."

Not only do they have a great selection of drinks, but their food choices - crumpets and crumpwiches - are fantastic. 

I decided to get two savory crumpets - Smoked Salmon Pesto and Duck Confit and Shallot - as well as one semi-sweet crumpet - Beechers and Berries, along with a honey latte.

All three crumpets are SO so so good. The smoked salmon pesto crumpet was super fresh and tasty. The crunchy shallots with the savory duck confit was a winning combination. And the Beechers and Berries sounds pretty weird at first - but it works for sure.

The service here is really great. The people who work here are attentive and super nice. Wifi is very fast and even on a Saturday afternoon, there&#39;s plenty of seating.

I absolutely love the BLT &amp; Egg crumpwich. The basil aioli is crack! The flavor balance is so amazing, I&#39;m always left wishing for more!

One superb detail is that crumpwiches come with your choice of salad, sweet potato chips or cup of fruits! I always go for the fruits, because it makes me feel like I&#39;m also being healthy (hahaha!).

If I had one request to make this place perfect would be that they offer diet sodas."

This place isn&#39;t too far to walk to from my place, it&#39;s clean and offers high quality food (bakery, salad, crumpets! and coffee). Plus, the crumpets aren&#39;t too common to find in Seattle (I only know of a few places that make them fresh). And.. the final thing that won me over: 100% of Queen Bee Cafe&#39;s profit goes to select charity. This quarter, for example, their profit goes to Arboretum Foundation. You&#39;d think this place must look somewhat like a hippie&#39;s hang out, but really not so at all.  It&#39;s a nice, modern cafe..and not too crowded at all.

I had their BLT + Egg Crumpwich (crumpet sandwich) and though it didn&#39;t look huge...it was actually a decent size. After finishing my crumpwich...I was so satisfied and tempted to crawl back in my bed :P...it was that filling. It comes with your choice of side salad, sweet potato chips or fresh cup of fruits (mix of grapes, strawberries, and berries). They have different options, both sweet and savory crumpets and I can&#39;t wait to try more of their other savory crumpets. In my next visit, I probably will either try their duck confit or beecher&#39;s cheese and berries crumpets.

Most people who come here grab some sort of crumpets and coffee. However, they also have bakeries/pastries from local neighborhood as well as some soup, if you want to eat other things other than crumpets, too."

Queen Bee&#39;s coffee, crumpets and ambiance make it one of the best cafes in the area. Offering crumpets is both unique and much needed variance from standard cafe offerings. The crumpet menu is fairly extensive with something for everyone, and the Happy Hour crumpets are simple, delicious, and a bargain.

The coffee is top notch, with a multitude of dairy alternatives. I first tried hemp milk in my latte here, and it was one of the best lattes I&#39;ve had to this day. The baristas are extremely friendly and very enthusiastic about their craft. 

The ambiance is relaxed, laid back and comfortable. This is place you can hunker down for a few hours to be productive or unproductive. Either way, you&#39;re be glad you came to Queen Bee."

The photos looked delightful, crumpets and berries, choices of sweet and savory; I knew I had to try this.
The interior looks warm and inviting. A few were working on their laptops while having coffee and a few were waiting for their breakfast.
Ordered at the counter and sat enthusiastically for my crumpets. I ordered the beecher&#39;s and berries and my hubby ordered a honey baked ham. 
My tea was served in a cute little pot. The cup, pot and the saucer were in assorted colors which was kinda cute. The tea itself though was not my favorite. Too much bitterness and too little taste.
The crumpets were ready in less than 10 minutes. The berries crumpets were definitely bland. The garnish was nothing like the photos, lacked the blueberries and herbs on top and tasted even more bland.
The honey baked ham was better, but too greasy for my liking. 
Could have been an off day for the café or just a day where they did not have all the ingredients they needed. But a less than ideal experience for me. Also, It was definitely on the pricy end for what they were offering.  Hèlas....."

Crumpets. Yep, crumpets. As in &#34;tea and...&#34; As in the Queen of England, sticking my pinky out when I drink my tea -- only these crumpets are accessible to all us commoners. And they&#39;re freakin&#39; out of this world delicious!

I had had them with butter before -- and their butter shouldn&#39;t even be called butter, because it&#39;s so much better than even the best gourmet butters we have on the east coast. But most recently, I had crumpets with peanut butter and banana. And they threw some honey in there just for kicks and giggles. Sheer breakfast perfection.

Loved their coffee as well and the kicked back, easy atmosphere (but then again, #Seattle) -- and the person who was working the counter was super nice. Great way to start my day!"

I made the mistake of coming here for lunch, thus the 3-star rating. I think this place would be a lot more charming for an afternoon coffee and snack. The food portions are pretty small and the crumpet sandwiches are kind of expensive, so I didn&#39;t feel like it was a very satisfying lunch. I had the caramel chocolate smores crumpets, which was really good but a bit overwhelmingly sweet. I couldn&#39;t really taste the caramel and I think it would&#39;ve been good to have some strawberries or some other fruit to break up the sweetness. The crumpets are thinner and less dense than the crumpets from the Crumpet Shop down in Pike Place Market. 

I was really impressed that 100% of Queen Bee Cafe&#39;s profit goes to charity and I was also really impressed by the thoughtful design that goes into every single detail of this place. Everything within the decor seems to fit into the bee theme (hive patterns on the upholstery and door). The staff were friendly and courteous, and they were very apologetic that my crumpets took so long to make because they had to run next door for the marshmallows. It looks like it would be a great place to chill and study/do some work, meet up with friends for an afternoon snack, or just hide out by yourself and devour a decadent 1,000-calorie caramel chocolate smore treat."

Queen Bee is connected to Aegis (assisted living for seniors) and is owned by the same owner. I have a special place in my heart for our elders and when I heard that he had opened Queen Bee in memory of his own mother who ailed from Alzheimers AND donates all the profits to a new charity each quarter, I knew I had to stop in.

Small and quaint, with nice natural lighting, it&#39;s the perfect cafe set-up. There&#39;s a lot of small tables so walking around can be a little tight if it&#39;s busy.

I was helped at the counter by a great guy; so personable. They have alternate milks like almond, and are serving up a tasty latte with them.

QB specializes in crumpets, and they&#39;re pretty good! Smaller and yellow in color versus what I&#39;m used to, they were rich (and buttery!) I topped mine with duck confit &amp; fried shallots and had their corn soup. The duck was a little over-seasoned, and the corn soup was a little underseasoned--what&#39;s a girl to do? You guessed it, I started throwing the duck into the soup haha and it was perfect.

If it was closer to me, I would definitely pop in regularly. I&#39;m happy to support businesses with great missions like theirs."

We mostly see people on their laptops studying for finals, meetings, and some lounging around reading the daily paper. We never had a crumpet before and I&#39;ve always wanted to go for some time, but school got in the way. Now that I&#39;m currently on break, it was finally my chance to try it out before I leave for the holidays. :)

Usually when we try something new, we usually get something sweet (like chocolate related because I always have a sweet tooth), but before our visit, we constantly check on Yelp and Instagram to see what&#39;s good and we always see that the Beecher&#39;s &amp; Berries crumpets were quite popular, so we decided to try that along with the Royal Hot Chocolate. 

The crumpets were really delicious. I love that they included cheese under the berries to make it that unique flavor. Since my boyfriend and I already had lunch before we came here, it was perfect that it wasn&#39;t that big and we each ate one and shared the hot chocolate and it definitely filled us up. The price for the two were reasonable. Especially the Beecher&#39;s &amp; Berries because it has mixed berries such as strawberries, blueberries, and I think blackberry jam if I&#39;m not mistaken. The presentation was really nice, I love their black rectangle plate because I&#39;m so used to seeing a bunch of white plates everywhere. The black plates makes the cafe even more unique.

The two servers that were helping us were really friendly and very welcoming! The vibe was great and their interior is amazing too.

They sell primarily espresso beverages + crumpets. Not too many other spots around here does that. It&#39;s like super fancy crumpets! They have a list of savory, sweet, and crumpet sandwiches. Each order of the first two comes w/ two crumpets. I got the mix n match to try two different ones for $7.25. The smoked salmon pesto was good! Beechers and Berries not bad either. They&#39;re not very big though. My boyfriend got the Cuban crumpet sandwich and a side of chowder. $10.45. Chowder was heavy per it usually is. The sandwich was not bad, but very greasey. I think I prefer the crumpets w/ toppings instead. 

Good spot. Would return!"

Super happy with this find!  For some reason I had always thought of crumpets of being more like a biscuit, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked these.  Its more like a small pancake, but not as sweet...  My friend had the pork cubano and I had the blt with fried egg crumpwich... Both were amazing and came with a choice of sides, and nothing was left by the time we were through.  Yum.  The blackberry cobbler crumpet will be my next to try... But oh, the doughnuts here are hugomongous and made fresh next door...I haven&#39;t tried those yet, but I hear they are worth the calories.  Can&#39;t wait to try more. :)"

I was a little disappointed that it wasn&#39;t as good as everybody else reviewed it to be. To be fair, I really liked the decor and it seemed like a great place to study! I only came here to get food and didn&#39;t get their coffee. Everybody raved about their crumpets, so I was looking forward to it! Personally, I thought that it was a little expensive for what you got (quantity and quality). The crumpet sandwich was quite small, but it definitely wasn&#39;t as soft and flavorful as the crumpets I&#39;ve had before. 

Again, I will say that the place is super bright and would be a great place to study and catch up with a friend. Plus the staff was friendly! I&#39;ll have to come back again and try their coffee...or maybe another crumpet sandwich to make another review."

Sorry, but you build your business on one food item and it&#39;s not even accurate.  It&#39;s like calling butter chicken mole chicken.  They don&#39;t get enough air into the crumpets in their receipe thus there&#39;s few holes in it and thus none of the spreads get down into the thing.

To boot, the crumpets are tiny. It&#39;s sad when a business that does mostly one thing can&#39;t do it well. The only reason why they get any positive reviews are because people in Seattle are mostly clueless as to what a crumpet is.

Store bought crumpets are much, much better than this."

How could you not support this place? It&#39;s nestled in central district. I&#39;ve never had a crumpet before which is why this place kind of intrigued me. 

I got a small mocha and the Beechers and berries crumpets. My bf got the avocado turkey crumpwich and the mushroom cream soup (which came with a choice of toasted crumpet or crackers). I was pleasantly surprised at how the cheese and berries went together! Great combo of savory and sweet. Ps they also use local jam on it. The crumpwich was also pretty filling and the avocado really made the sandwich. The mushroom soup had finely chopped mushrooms (I was hoping for chunks) but it was 12oz for a small. Quite a serving! I think crackers would have been a better choice than a toasted crumpet for the soup.

Great space with a few tables and cute honeycomb decor. Baristas were nice and served us our food when it was ready. Next on the list is definitely the blackberry crumpet!"

I visited last weekend and ordered the salmon pesto and pumpkin pie crumpets, which I&#39;ve had before and loved, and my boyfriend ordered the peanut butter and banana. I noticed that the crumpets seemed quite a bit smaller and not as fluffy. A permanent change or a fluke? The ingredients were otherwise the same and tasty as ever. I ordered a chai latte for the first time, and OH MY GOD it is the main reason that my review stays at five stars. It&#39;s the chai I&#39;ve been waiting for - spicy and sweet and addictive as hell.

The royal hot chocolate is SUPER SWEET. I&#39;d only recommend it if you have a insatiable sweet tooth.

The crumpwich was pretty good - I really enjoyed the dijonnaise spread, and the actual crumpet portion was soft, yet slightly chewy, the way I imagine a crumpet should be (I don&#39;t eat crumpets often, so I mostly have to imagine how I think they should taste - nevertheless, I liked it!).  The coffee was solid, too.

The inside is decorated very nicely, and it&#39;s a small, but well-utilized space.  As I was finishing my brunch, the place seemed to have filled up quickly and the outside seating was being utilized as well.  So I can see it running into the problem of crowdedness on a busy day, but it wasn&#39;t too bad when I went.  The staff was friendly and helpful in explaining my options for a meal, and helped me decide on the ham, egg, and cheese (which was a good choice).

A small issue I had was with the amount of food I got - I was hoping to get fuller on an $8 crumpwich, but I still had room for food after I finished eating.  No biggie, since I understand their profits go to charities, but just a heads up - if you&#39;re hungry, plan on getting more than a crumpwich."

I live right nearby and I was really excited when it appeared. The coffee I&#39;ve had has always been delicious, although I&#39;ve stuck to pretty standard drinks. They don&#39;t have sugar-free syrups but their vanilla syrup is made with honey (I think) so it&#39;s sweet but not as unhealthy as full-on sugar. They also have a lot of snacks (I&#39;ve mostly just had the donuts, which are delicious). I need to try the crumpet sandwiches next time.

It&#39;s also just super cute; they have little tiny tables for kids and some games and things like that. They also sell alcoholic beverages, lemonades, etc. in addition to coffee and tea. 

AND they&#39;re entirely not-for-profit so everything is donated to charity. They pick a different one each quarter, I believe, and I think that&#39;s really awesome. Sometimes they&#39;re a little slower than, say, Starbucks or one of the busier coffee shops, but that&#39;s because there&#39;s usually just one person working, so you can&#39;t fault them too much.

The food is incredible. All about the crumpet, with everything from simple to super fancy crumpets, crumpet sandwiches, and all the fixings. I had the Beecher&#39;s and Berries crumpets, served on a black slate tray. These crumpets were soft and just the right amount of crisp, topped with melted Beecher&#39;s white cheddar, jam and honey, and a scoop of berries. A little watercress to top it off. Delicious! 

And of course, coffee--Stumptown coffee fresh brewed and delicious. Excellent barista, super delectable lattes and americanos, so good I had to go back for more! 

The staff is so kind and accommodating, the seating areas are spacious and a good variety of tables, chairs, side tables, and places to fit various party sizes.

Their staff is extremely friendly and the atmosphere is charming and cozy.  I found their espresso drinks to be a little pricy.  The crumpets are DELICIOUS (we had a blueberry one that tasted like pie, the Beecher&#39;s and berries was perfectly balanced) but not a lot of food for the money.

The only hitch on Queen Bee is that parking&#39;s tough, so when I heard they were available through FlyBuy, where you can order online and then they just bring it out to your car as you pull up (they use GPS on your smartphone to see you coming) - I knew that would make it perfect.

So that&#39;s what we did - we ordered through FlyBuy, the service and timing were perfect, and we drove down to Madison Park while our youngest son played and had our food.

Saw their was a champagne special but we weren&#39;t allowed to order it because we were in a private room but we were ordering the 2 entree minimum. I thought that was unfair that because of how large our party was we had to have the room upstairs and could not partake in the special. I mean we are spending at least $$$ why couldn&#39;t we partake in the anniversary s

The lobster bisque came out cold has to ask them to reheat it.
The Delmonico was just okay and it was overly salted.

What was the kicker is that we knew there was an auto 20% service charge for every person not because of the size of the party just for ordering anything on the menu but on top of that they charge you tax on your service charge! I think that is horrible because you don&#39;t charge for labor just the goods.

Two of our steaks came out rare when we asked for medium. We couldn&#39;t even chew them. For a steakhouse and $85 steaks, you&#39;d think they would know how to cook a simple ribeye.

The little birthday cake was dry and tasted like cardboard. We didn&#39;t even bother with it after attempting to get the rock hard chocolate to break apart. Should have brought our own delicious cake from Whole Foods or something similar.

Oh, and we couldn&#39;t pop our own bottle of Clicquot that we ordered as if we are children. Please. For this kind of money, at least make your guests feel at home.

Spoke to manager and they just comped my mother&#39;s dinner. Fine, but cheapened the experience beyond a tolerable level. 

Not sure if it&#39;s the 20% included gratuity (lazy wage) or management doesn&#39;t care, but this place has gone downhill. Used to be a place I would take everyone to for an amazing dinner, but now it&#39;s just another steak place. In fact, I make a better ribeye; come over to my place with a nice scotch!

Service: Super! We always had a full-glass of iced-water, and the waitress made sure we were okay the entire night. They gave us room to relax and dine too.

Food: AMAZING. I fell in love with their calamari (it wasn&#39;t hard but cooked to the right temperature and the sauce complimented the calamari), and my pan roasted garlic chicken tasted flavorful. The mash potatoes and chicken were juicy and not dry and hard. Lastly, the portion was good! It filled you enough but not to the point where you can&#39;t finish and need it to-go.

View: You see Mt. Rainier and Bellevue. And the water and boats. It is a different view and beautiful! The atmosphere is calm, relaxing and romantic/intimate.

I get some charring occurs when cooking meat on high temp, but this steak had a crusty layer of char and the taste of it overpowered the flavor of the meat (instead of complementing it). I pointed it out to our server, who was very professional about it and had it replaced. The quality of the meat was mediocre in comparison to other steak houses in Seattle and Bellevue. The garlic mash potatoes were creamy and flavorful, but the other side (asparagus with hollandaise sauce) was meh. Girlfriend got the pork chop which we both agreed was well prepared. Overall, didn&#39;t meet my expectations. Highlight was probably the service."

I will say my crab salad entree had more cabbage that anything this time, and left me wanting more.

However, the cookie in an iron skillet, and coconut ice cream desert made up for the lacking crab salad entree. The coconut ice cream dessert doesn&#39;t sound like much, but it&#39;s my favorite dessert I&#39;ve ever had at DB.

Also, the popcorn shrimp is a must get every time. They also started including the tip on the bill now, which I think is appropriate, but some of you cheapos may want to know in advance."

We went today for brunch at noon and had a half round both facing the water.  Service was fairly prompt and helpful. 

Cons: I ordered the fillet Oscar Benedict and my husband had the Steak hash. For being almost $25 a plate, I was unimpressed. The Steak was way undercooked on one of my Benedict halves ...I was getting full so I didn&#39;t end up needing to eat it but still.  The plate must&#39;ve sat under a heat lamp for a bit because it came out luke warm. The hash was pretty bland.  

Pros: great atmosphere, the coffee service comes with half and half and fresh whipped cream MMMM.  The meal includes these tiny muffin scone pastries with cream cheese... Also yum!  Plenty of parking and they take reservations. 

Thankfully we had a coupon for buy one entree get one free otherwise this would be a 2 star review on the food for the price.  We will likely go back with our other brunch coupon but will order things you can f depend on like the candied bacon pancakes (or was it waffles?)."

Had a very disappointing experience at Daniel&#39;s. The truth is I care MOST about how my food tastes and if that doesn&#39;t cut it I don&#39;t care how nice your view + service is. It&#39;s like rubbing salt on a wound when a place has unpleasant food paired with a high price tag. Our host took one look at us - a young Asian couple - and deliberated on seating us at a waterfront table. She told us that she had to go look around to see if there was room. Another host came up to us while this person was &#34;looking&#34; for seating and informed us that there was definitely room. That&#39;s when we should&#39;ve turned around and walked out... The restaurant was nearly empty with 80% of the patio seated because it was such a gorgeous day out.

House Salad ($10): The mixed greens had the &#34;I&#39;ve been in the fridge too long&#34; look with frayed and brown corners. There was nothing memorable about it. If I had tossed some old salad greens at home with some generic dressing and left it in he fridge for a little while, I would get the same result.

Salmon (Special) $48: This was the worst salmon I&#39;d ever had. Hands down. Eating this meal was like getting slapped in the face by a king salmon. The description read: &#34;Grilled, heirloom tomato gazpacho, orzo pasta, grilled fennel, kohlrabi, fried zucchini blossom&#34;. Let me describe what actually came out... The salmon on top was a good cut and well grilled but somehow it look mangled - like it stuck to the grill and they had to pry it off mangled. It was piping hot but sitting in a pool of cool V8 juice with chunks of orzo and cubed veggies. There were at least 3 distinct temperatures going on with the dish--just like when you reheat your food in a bad microwave. I understand that gazpacho is usually cold but I thought it sounded bold enough of a dish that I&#39;d give it a try... The best thing about the dish was the single zucchini blossom on top because it was deep friend and didn&#39;t touch the tomato-y pool of death.

For the price of our meal, we could&#39;ve just rented a boat on the water... because that was by far the best part, the view!"

Probably at least half of the menu price pays for the rent--right on the water at the marina. It felt very luxurious to come in from the cold at 4 pm dusk to a view of the floating lights from yachts and Bellevue mansions across the lake. 

The decor is super upscale. Chandeliers, dim lighting (one family had to use their iPhone flashlights to read the menu), glassy baby candles, waiters in suits, etc.

We came at 4:30 for the happy hour menu and got the (3) bacon wrapped scallops, (2 small) Australian lamb chops, and bread pudding with espresso for dessert. Came out to about $50. 

The scallops were superb; bread pudding was massive, bigger than either of the real food dishes, was more than enough for two people, and had excellent chunks of unsweetened dark chocolate and a house made very dark thick caramel sauce. I&#39;m not normally a dessert person but this was reallllly good. The espresso was extremely bitter, more than most espresso I think, but it came with two sugar cubes. 

The lamb chops were very very tasty but VERY rare--like bloody. As in bright red, vermillion, liquid blood from a living animal. I was almost concerned they would make me sick. But they didn&#39;t! The fennel on the side was a nice touch and I appreciated that it wasn&#39;t too sweet."

But you pay a pretty penny for that view. We were pleasantly surprised that even on a Friday evening at 7:00pm, we were able to get immediately seated without a reservation.  There were several old-money types, but most of the patrons were casually attired.  Unfortunately, service and food were mostly mediocre.

JP started with a goat cheese, beet and pickled onion salad, which was quite good.  I ordered the basic garden salad.  Its ingredients were very fresh and I liked that they pre-tossed my salad.  While the garlic dressing was very good, there was too much dressing and the salad was drenched.

For dinner, JP ordered the 20 oz. Delmonico (a bone-in New York cut).  I ordered the 24 oz. Porterhouse.  I guess I couldn&#39;t resist ordering this steak, considering the steak&#39;s description on the menu:  a bone-in cut from the short loin with the tenderness of the Filet Mignon and the marbling and flavor of the New York.  Both steaks went for $66/each, far more than we have ever paid for a steak.   

We did like how an older gentleman in a jacket came around with a penlight and asked us to slice into our steak so he could inspect the meat and see that it was cooked to the right doneness.  While the garlic sauce drizzled over the steak was good, I found my Porterhouse rather on the tough and dry side (not what I expected for $66).

We also ordered some mushrooms as a side dish.  The mushrooms were dreadful.  Beside being undercooked, they tasted exactly, and I mean exactly, like the odor of a chlorinated indoor pool.

After we had finished our salads and were waiting for our entreés, we were grazing on the so-so complimentary bread.  But suddenly, one of the servers grabbed the bread basket, and, took the butter knife out of my hand.  I asked him what he was doing.  He said he was taking the bread and he was just trying to be funny.  Funny might not be the word I would use.

And at the end of the meal, we placed our credit card in the &#34;check presenter&#34; with check.  Our initial server came over and made a couple cooing sounds when she saw the card, but walked off without taking the card.  We waited and waited to see if the lady was going to come back.  She didn&#39;t.  So we asked one of the other servers if he could take our card.  He finally did, but not before whining that he couldn&#39;t take our check and wanted us to wait for the other server to come back.   I&#39;m giving this Daniel&#39;s Broiler 3 stars, but could justify going with 2 stars."

It has a great view of Lake Washington and you can see across the water to downtown Bellevue-it&#39;s a nice sight to see at night.  I was debating between the filet mignon and ribeye, and ended up going with Daniel&#39;s 12 oz Cut Filet Mignon.  I always get my steak medium rare.  It came out just perfect!!  It was perfectly seasoned and was so tender.  It melted in my mouth like butter.  We also ordered the bacon wrapped scallops as an appetizer to share-that was a pretty good start to our evening, the scallops tasted great but the bacon could have been a bit crispier.  They also give you a bread basket with salted butter.  Our server was nice and helpful in explaining the menu since it was my first time visiting a Daniel&#39;s broiler, but not for my friends.  They use only the finest cuts of USDA beef.  The steaks come with your choice of garlic mashed potatoes or a loaded baked potato or veggies.  

When the waiter brought over our steaks, he asked that we cut into them to make sure they were cooked perfectly to our liking and had a little flashlight to shine onto to steaks so that we could see better since the dining room was a bit dark.  As we were finishing up our steaks, we all decided to get dessert.  I got the Valrhona chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was a really good finish to the meal with fresh fruits.  The ice cream could have been more cold-it was already melted and I had to eat the ice cream first before it turned into a puddle.  Overall, it was a good first experience visiting a Daniel&#39;s Broiler and you can bet that I will be back for more steak!"
daniels-broiler-seattle-8,Anna M.,mtbyFA8bGnPaEdT6d_T89g,"Kirkland, WA",1,1,0,11,100,nPr8RSYwemVnFAkT69BX8w,1.0,2015-08-31,"I&#39;ve heard nothing but great things about Daniel&#39;s.  Everyone told me to go to the Bellevue location.  I wish I would have listened.  I sought after a water view, so we headed to this location for my s/o&#39;s birthday. 

We arrived on Saturday evening, and sat in the lounge, facing the water.  We were promptly greeted by a smiling server, very professionally.  Unfortunately, the professionalism stopped there.  Apparently our appearance gave him the impression that it was appropriate to drop words like &#34;dawg&#34; and &#34;legit&#34; and YES, even the F bomb at one point, throughout our experience.  

1. I do not want anyone at my table to be called &#34;dawg.&#34;  
2. I don&#39;t want to be asked &#34;what&#39;s crackin&#39;&#34;.  
3. I would like an actual description of the food, not that it&#39;s &#34;legit.&#34;  What does that even mean?  How about a flavor profile?  
4.  If you say &#34;F&#34; anything during my experience, I feel like I shouldn&#39;t be spending anything when I walk out of that restaurant.  Absolutely unacceptable.  

Due to the number of issues, I decided to make sure and have the time to detail out our experience instead of asking to speak with a manager.

We are both seasoned in fine dining, and neither of us expected or appreciated the casual attitude from our server.  As expensive as this restaurant is, I expected to walk into a dining experience with a professional, seasoned server.  Think: crumbing tables, wine chilled at the appropriate temperature, etc.

Our server checked on/interrupted us about four times while we were trying to enjoy our first cocktail, while we perused and discussed the menu.  Apparently that meant that he&#39;d go, and rarely visit again.

We did finally order.  The crab for an appetizer, with the Dijon mustard sauce.  The crab comes dipped in the sauce, and it completely overpowers and smothers the crab.  Our dirty appetizer plates were pushed to the side and left there for about most of the meal as nobody grabbed them.

The French Onion soup came out, which we requested two spoons, and came out with one.  Our server blamed it on someone else.  I noticed every other table received a bread basket.  We did not.

We split the small 14 oz Ribeye, and requested a green vegetable substitution instead of potatoes, so we could also order the lobster potatoes.  I am unsure if they rarely get asked this question, but it seemed like an ordeal to just get something green.  He was able to make that happen, so that was nice.  It didn&#39;t seem like a very unreasonable request, but nonetheless, we did get our vegetables.

I ordered a glass of the Syrah (from the bar), and it was extremely warm.  I know Reds are supposed to be served slightly chilled, and that is my preference as well, so I went back up to the bar to request ice cubes to chill it.  Tacky, I know.  

At one point, our server asked my s/o if he&#39;d like another cocktail (the glass was empty).  He did not want another cocktail and our server departed, without grabbing the glass, that my s/o just moved in front so he could grab.  I ended up putting on a ledge, and a manager walked by to grab it.  

The Ribeye was delivered (professionally) and we checked the temperature (medium rare).  I lost my patience at this point.  The Ribeye was so salty, I had to drown it with potatoes to eat it.  I didn&#39;t end up eating my half because I could not tolerate how salty it was.  I&#39;ve had steaks with an herbed butter, but this wasn&#39;t the butter.  I could not eat the steak alone, nor could I even get to taste the steak.  I was extremely disappointed.

I walked to the bathroom, and my s/o was asked by the server &#34;Am I doing ok?&#34;  As in, &#34;How is my performance as your server?&#34;  I don&#39;t even understand why you would ask your table this question.  How awkward for any table to have to answer the question.

There were two bartenders that evening that were professional and helped take care of us when our server was absent.  So, I&#39;m not sure if this is a server issue, or a restaurant issue.

If people are paying $55+ for a steak in your restaurant, then there needs to be a lot more attention to detail and professionalism than there was in our experience.  Maybe it&#39;s because I come from the Midwest, but when you go to a nice restaurant, your expectations are typically met with even higher standards from the wait staff themselves.  We&#39;ve both worked in fine dining, and we both know what it&#39;s like to care about the little things, the details, and to care about the experience you&#39;re providing to someone.  Not only does someone spend their time to make money to pay for the meal at your restaurant, then they come and actually entrust their experience and time with you...and often for a special occasion.  When the restaurant and their staff can&#39;t get it together, that is a big deal.

Wish I would have gone somewhere else, and next time we will."

My rating is based on the bar menu.  In my opinion, 3 stars is just fine and means I may go back again.  My wife got the fish and chips which she said she enjoyed and it seemed to come with a healthy portion.  I got the prime filet mignon steak sandwich.  This is typically the type of sandwich I get when it&#39;s my first time at a restaurant.  Especially one known for it&#39;s steaks.  The sandwich was underwhelming for $22 and simply tasted like your standard French dip. The actual dip was unique but not for me as it kind of tasted like minestrone soup as opposed to a traditional au jus.   I didn&#39;t hate it, but all I could think about was the NY Steak Sandwich at Jak&#39;s that costs $17 and is the best steak sandwich in the city.  By taste and price comparison the value was not there.  There was a limited number of tap beers and I got the Bellevue Ale.  Problem was the glass was small and I got the idea they were serving 10 oz beers.  I could be wrong about that but it was my perception and the beer was gone real fast.  Didn&#39;t think I was that thirsty.  Place has a great view by the water and like I said above, I may go back."

We have tried Daniels twice and both times the food and service was average while the bill was high.  If you want fine dining I would much rather go to Canlis.  The value is just not there at Daniels - noisy, uppity staff, average food."

At some point we were wondering if our waitress had left for the day it had been so long since we had seen her.  25 minutes to bring coffee which was filled the brim, spilling over the top.  Just completely lazy and lacking in any appearance of effort.  $450 for 5.  Complete waste of money and time to feel neglected at best."

We shared two items of the bar menu (classic steakhouse burger and steak sliders), my boyfriend ordered a local IPA and I had two glasses of wine from Hedges Family Estate (amazing). We couldn&#39;t resist getting the deep dish chocolate chip cookie. Baked in an iron skillet, topped with vanilla ice cream. Served with a shot of ice cold milk.

The price was exorbitant. I could not imagine ever buying an entree there, especially not $100 steak! When we were ready for our check we were informed there was a 20% surcharge. We didn&#39;t say anything nor did we look surprised, but she immediately launched into saying we could talk to the manager if we had questions about that. They must get some pushback on that. I&#39;ve never had that when there are only 2 people, not sure if that&#39;s a forced tip or not... either way it seemed odd."

This was our second time visiting, I had just been at the Bellevue location on Thursday and it was excellent as always. The energy was low though tables full, we got a great window seat. Our waiter immediately displayed a rude and uninterested tone when initially greeting us. Didn&#39;t offer us to order drinks or ask any questions, after 7-10 minutes w were able to ask for a drink, 10 min later half of them arrived at our table.  This guy was extremely absent from our table and after being seated for 20 min we finally received bread and got an opportunity to order appetizers.

We all ordered the French Onion Soup, two came COMPLETELY charred black and uneatable, both sent back. No apologies made for either, entrees were finally ordered.  The entire time our waiter displayed no personality and seemed annoyed he was even alive.  One in our party ordered the Swordfish and it appeared to have been last in the ocean weeks ago, again, sent back. This waiter was clearly doing cardio from our table at this point. 

Dessert was a true disaster, the cheesecake had the consistency of string cheese and was lukewarm. The ice cream on two orders had a protective layer of dried ice and the coconut was stale....again more cardio for our soulless waiter. The cappuccinos and lattes arrived in childlike tea settings for a doll and very, very plain.  The biggest shock out of all this is this would never happen in Bellevue but for whatever reason it happened here. Two times, two poor experiences....lesson learned by all, stay in Bellevue with Daniels Broiler.

I&#39;ve been informed during this review that both friends that ate this dreadful meal have been getting acquainted with their commodes in various ways.  Again, Fail."

French onion soup- pass :/ the &#34;soup&#34; was really thick and tasted more like onion paste. I enjoy the pieces of bread that normally come in classic french onion soup and this one barely had any. Flavor was there for me albeit a little on the salty side. 
Oysters- yummy, fresh, and thoroughly cleaned!
Seared Halibut- bland, slightly overcooked, bland. Served with lime rice, pineapple relish, and a chile beurre blanc. There was nearly no flavor in the sauce and no seasoning on the halibut. Whole family backed me up on this, even my little brother who doesn&#39;t have much fine dining experience. 
Truffle fingerling potatoes- okay. Thought it needed more of the truffle cheese but this could be bias because I&#39;m a cheese fiend. 
Porterhouse steak- saved the best for last! This was delicious! Well, when they first brought it to our table they have you cut into the middle of the steak and they flash a light into it for you to see if it&#39;s cooked to your liking...it wasn&#39;t. It was waaaay too red!! We had them take it back and when it returned, i peeked into the same cut I made and it looked a lot better. However, it was a little well done on the edges. Thought it was still well cooked throughout, tender, and nearly melted in my mouth! I hardly had to use my steak knife, it was so easy to cut through the meat. Served with garlic mash- which I loved.
Paired it with a glass of cab and it made my dining experience much better!
Finally, ended the night with free chocolate molten cake served with vanilla ice cream and fruit. Yummy/ no complaints here!

Our server seemed more attentive to the party next to us..the customer was making a scene about the cook of his steak.. Our server was also extremely slow when it came to bussing our dishes and picking up the check/getting boxes. SO SLOW!"

Brought a friend in for brunch and ordered french press in which we had to beg for them to bring us creamer in which they chose to not give us the full tray that includes almond creme and sugar with the coffee.. 20 mins later after asking again we get HALF of the creamer tray. They also did not bring the pastries or anything that was supposed to accompany the brunch order. Ordered food and that took literally 1 hour to come out!? On top of that they changed policy to a mandatory 20% tip fee on your bill so needless to say seems the servers could care less about how happy you are at the end of your meal.

The staff knew it was a special occasion since we had a special flower arrangement delivered for the table.  Despite making reservations 1 month prior we still had to wait 15 minutes.

I attended a catered event at the Bellevue Square location, and it was pretty good, so I was interested to try them out for dinner.  I called and made a reservation, since I live over an hour away.  The lady on the phone asked if there was a special occasion, and I informed her that it was my gf&#39;s birthday.

After hitting awful traffic on the way out, I called and informed them that I would be running late.  The lady on the phone said it wouldn&#39;t be a problem, and they could bump our reservation back a half hour.  When we arrived, we were promptly greeted by a valet, and he directed us to the restaurant entrance before pulling a Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off with my car.  Just kidding.  He parked it neatly with the other cars.

We walked in and were greeted by a hostess, who confirmed our reservation and seated us at a romantic table, next to the window, overlooking Lake Washington and Bellevue.  Looking around the restaurant, we observed it was completely trimmed out in beautiful copper. The seating area was two-tiered with an upstairs hall for private dining events.

Immediately following being seated, our server, Min (I think?), came and introduced himself.  He asked if we had dined at Daniel&#39;s before, and I said we had not.  He proceeded to give us a little background on the restaurant before taking our beverage order.  I ordered a bottle of Veuve Cliquot Champagne.  Call me cheap, but I couldn&#39;t pass up $35 for a bottle of good Champagne (they were doing a deal all year for their 35th anniversary) that normally goes for $100 on their wine list.  Another server was quickly back with the bottle and an ice bucket.  Our server was back moments later to serve the Champagne.  He poured a small amount in my glass to sample, and it was everything I expected.  After giving my approval, he then filled my gf&#39;s glass followed by mine.  Having previously worked in the wine industry, I am privy to restaurant wine serving etiquette, and our server nailed it.

For appetizers we ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops and clam chowder. Cliche?  Maybe.  But, I wanted some seafood, since I was planning on a steak for the main course.  Our server mentioned the appetizers came with three scallops and offered to add an extra.  We gladly accepted.  He even split our bowl of chowder into two cups to make it easier to share. Prior to ordering the steaks, our server gave us a background on what to expect from the broiler, since it was our first time.  I was between the standard ribeye and their special 30oz cut.  Our server insisted the 30oz was the way to go (can you really blame him?), so I went with that and the mashed potatoes.

The. Scallops. Were. MASSIVE. We honestly would have been fine with one each, but I wasn&#39;t about to complain. Great presentation. Greater flavor. Would definitely get them again. The chowder was delicious and I&#39;m glad my gf talked me into it.

Our steaks arrived a short while later. Mine was beautifully French-cut, aka, &#34;The Meat Tomahawk.&#34;  Our server invited us to cut into the center of our steaks, at which point he shined a flashlight on it and asked if it had been cooked to our satisfaction.  I had ordered mine medium rare - our server suggested that, versus rare, due to the broiling process.  The center was red and warm, just as I expected.  The meat was absolutely tender with a nice char on the outside.  It looked like there was a pool of herb butter on it. Whatever they did, it was amazing.  The potatoes were good, too. Flavor was spot-on. I prefer a creamier consistency, but these were probably a lot healthier!

I made it about 2/3 through the massive steak before I was full.  It killed me to have to ask for a to-go box, but there was no way I was finishing that after two giant scallops and a cup of chowder.  That&#39;s when our server hit me with the bad news:  We were getting a complimentary brownie and ice cream.  I say bad news because I was already very full, and I wasn&#39;t about to waste a perfectly good brownie à la mode!

By the time we finished, our leftovers had been neatly boxed and bagged (he even offered to wrap the bones for a dog, if we had one).  Now, uncomfortably full, we paid and headed for the car.  When we walked outside, the car was just being pulled up for us.  The valet complimented me on my car, stating he was also a car enthusiast.  For most people, that&#39;s no big deal, but for me, knowing that the person watching my car is as passionate about cars as I am gives me an added layer of comfort when leaving them with my car.

Daniel&#39;s made this a memorable night.  Impressive to the point my gf was later upset I didn&#39;t propose!  Well done, Daniel&#39;s (no pun intended)!  How am I going to top this?"

Came here on a whim because of the location and a sudden change of plans and boy did our dinner turn out well. While we skipped what they&#39;re most known for (steak, because our waiter couldn&#39;t say for sure if it was all grass fed, just that it came from Colorado and Nebraska), the Australian lamb chops and the Halibut special with quinoa were out of this world. Serving fish this good is worth a mention. 

As an appetizer I had a delicious, full flavored lobster bisque. For dessert we had their cheese cake which tasted better  than described: phenomenal.

Cons: it was a bit chilly in the dining room possibly because they had the A/C on and it being about 50 degrees outside. Still, while I live closer to the Lake Union location, this Daniel&#39;s has won my heart. Great views, impeccable service and wonderful ambiance.

This place really should not serve brunch considering that they have NO CLUE on how to do it. We came here with a gift card before we went out on lake Washington for the day.  First impressions were that the view was lovely and so was the inside of the restaurant. Ellen, our server was great. That&#39;s all that I can say that went well... 
I ordered a $5 cappuccino. It maybe was 5 ounces and the bottom had a significant amount of coffee grounds. 
The cooks obviously messed up our food the first time or so considering all of the other tables getting served before us. 

Now for the food. I ordered a bananas foster waffle and my husband ordered a bacon waffle. My EIGHTEEN dollar waffle didn&#39;t come with any sides, there were MAYBE 3 slices of bananas and the &#34;sauce&#34; was literally a hard toffee that filled up 10-15 dips of the waffle. I couldn&#39;t eat it. I sent it back but we didn&#39;t have all morning to hope that they could correct the issue so I left hungry.... Total disappointment even with a gift card. 

They just don&#39;t know what they are doing. If you&#39;re gonna charge $18 for a waffle, it better have at least a whole banana and the sauce should not be burnt toffee. Bleck."

View is beautiful! 

Service was good. Our server was attentive, though he had some orders mixed up, he was very kind and connected with our table. 

Parking was hard, but maybe because it was a weekend AND bc of the show that day? 

Food was so-so. Nothing too spectacular or unique to mention.

Only if food was better...sorry my 3 stars stays firm

They so split checks! Yay"

Went for Father&#39;s Day. Group of 5, bill before tip $450. 
View was okay. Staff was okay. Food was okay too. But, it was JUST OKAY. Nothing special at all. 
I had the filet mignon ($55). Not to toot my own horn, but I make a better steak at home. Not melt in your mouth and flavor was lackluster. 
The sides (which you have to order separate) were just okay. But once again, none of us were wowed. It was all very basic. Dessert was probably the best part of the meal. 
The long and short of it is, you could go to one of many other places along the water (It is Seattle after all.) and spend half as much and be equally if not more impressed."

Until.....an older gentleman walked up to our table and started telling one our party members how disrespectful it was for him to be wearing his hat at the table. We were all completely shocked, and very upset as he walked away. Unfortunately, he was standing in the lobby when we were leaving, and a nasty exchange followed. My friends wife told him he was rude and a jerk, and he followed up by calling her a jerk, and of course, it got worse from there. His family was appalled by his behavior, and kept apologizing on his behalf. He said he even went up to another table of 4 gentlemen, and 1 lady, and started in on them about their hats as well. He acted like he owned the place, so I&#39;m guessing he is a regular customer there, and Daniel&#39;s probably know who he is!

My issue with Daniel&#39;s is not one person from their staff stepped in to diffuse the situation, and just let this guy run around yelling at people about their attire. I don&#39;t know their exact dress code policy, but I&#39;m assuming that hats are allowed, since not one person from Daniel&#39;s asked my friend, or anybody else, to remove their hats. 
What should&#39;ve been a nice evening, turned into a complete disaster, and Daniel&#39;s Broiler did nothing to intervene and stop this guy from harassing fellow customers!

The other issues we encountered, were a 10 minute wait after we were sat at our table before anyone showed up to take our order. 
The order errors, were the wrong drinks, and a side salad that was not ordered.
The restaurant was also on the chilly side, and my girlfriend had to wear her jacket the whole time, as did I.

Overall, the four of us in our party were pretty disappointed with the whole experience, and don&#39;t see a return visit in our future. There are plenty of nice restaurants around to get an amazing steak at, and Daniel&#39;s is not one of them!"

We arrived a little early for our reservation but were seated promptly at a two-top table.  I was a bit disappointed not to have a window table since there were empty ones.  The banquette tables are pretty close to one another.  Close enough that you are privy to the next tables conversations in detail.  I was sitting facing the windows and was enjoying the view when I began to notice how close those tables were to one another also.  So close that if you were seated next to the window and anyone was at the table behind you, you would have difficultly getting out of your seat without disturbing them or your table mates.  

We ordered ice tea and our server asked if we would like bread, which we did.  The bread was a very good sourdough served with butter sprinkled with sea salt.

At that point the server for the table next to us came over to take their orders.  She squeezed into the small space between our table and the next table.  This left me with her backside only inches from my face.  There is NO room for a server between the tables. When space is that tight, I would suggest not attempting to squeeze between the tables and instead take two people&#39;s order from slightly behind the outside person and then go to the other side of the table and take the other couple&#39;s order (which she did when she took their drink orders).

For a starter I chose the Caesar salad, my husband the chowder.  I found the salad to be pretty much a salad.  Romaine, a couple of croutons.  It was ok.  My husband stated the chowder was very good.  He enjoyed it quite a lot.

For our entrees we both chose the flat steak stuffed with gorgonzola and onions accompanied with garlic mashed potatoes.  Although the stuffing was good, the steak was overcooked and dry.  It might have been better to have put more of the sauce over the steak to combat it&#39;s dryness.  The potatoes were good but we both laughed because of the portion size differences.  The potatoes were at least twice as large as the steak.

Dessert for me was the molten chocolate cake and for him the fruit cobbler.  The cobbler came out in a cast iron skillet with ice cream.  The cake also was served with ice cream.  Both desserts were wonderful.  I think this was the best ice cream I have ever had.  Also to note, we both order coffee.  It was very good also.

Our server was good.  He was present but not present at the same time which is good in this level of restaurant.  The rest of the staff were okay but not fabulous. Beside the server who put her butt in my face, our table was at the entrance to the restaurant and backed onto the bar.  The bar server was talking to his table behind us and it was pretty loud and invasive.

Would we go back?  Probably not to this location.  This restaurant is small and cramped.  We were way too close to our neighbors and the bar.  Definitely not the intimate atmosphere we had been desiring.  The food was okay not excellent.  However, this was the Restaurant Week menu so we would need to go back and try the regular menu."

The food was average, nothing to write home about.. They charged my card with someone else&#39;s bill. Then charged my bill. They said they corrected the problem.  Latter in the week, I noticed the other person&#39;s charge was still pending in my account. So they tied my money up for 8 days. This is my second visit to this location for a special occasion.

I had been to the Daniel&#39;s in Bellevue and it was excellent-the Leschi one-not so much.  I had the hot appetizer plate and blue cheese wedge salad and they were just okay-not what I expected from an expensive steak house.  On the appetizer plate the steak was too salty and the artichokes and shrimp were tasteless and bland.  My husband had the 30 ounce rib eye on the specials menu.  It was overcooked and he said it had no flavor.  For dessert I ordered the coconut hot fudge sundae and it wasn&#39;t as good as I had remembered.  The hot fudge did not taste the same as the one I had at the Bellevue location.  All in all a bummer of an anniversary dinner-I told my husband I want a do over.

There are many Seattle foodie spots that lack consistency: this is not one of them. My favorites on the menu include: Spicy barbecued prawns,  Filet mignon steak strips, and the Popcorn shrimp, which all range under $15 a piece. The best part is the steak strips are very similar to those serves at John Howie Steakhouse, however,  muchhhhh cheaper. Lol Oh yeah and I&#39;ve had many of their main dishes and they were good, not legendary, but good so overall it&#39;s a win.:&#34;) You really have to support their consistency tho: because what difference does it make if a restaurant is good like 25% of the time."

I&#39;d recommend the popcorn shrimp and the garlic chicken.  Service (on New Years Eve) was good and bad.  I am sure the servers were absolutely overwhelmed and so there were some dead spots in the service but at other times they were perfectly attentive.  

For New Year&#39;s Eve they gave us party hats, noise blowers, and free champagne.  On the bar side, there&#39;s a distant view of the fireworks at the space needle.  

This isn&#39;t a bad place if your parents want to take you out to dinner but the price to taste ratio is too high for me to want to go back.  It&#39;s kind of an upscale Marie Calendars."

Maybe we caught them on an off day because the table behind us had a lot to complain about also. The service was slow. Everything but the steak was just okay. We got several dishes and dined family style. We split oysters on the half shell, French onion soup, truffle fingerling potatoes, halibut, and the porterhouse. The oysters were great! Very fresh, full- bodied with a little bit of sweetness to them! The French onion soup was extremely salty, and ended up being more paste-like than soupy. The potatoes are great when they&#39;re hot but I feel like there was more truffle cheese on the dish than on the actual potatoes. The biggest disappointment was actually the halibut. Bland and dry :( the steak on the other hand! Was delicious! We asked for medium, it came out rare, sent it back and it came back medium for the most part. Melts in your mouth and excellent! 3 stars overall."

I told my stepdad I wanted to go there for my birthday but he cringed and suggested Daniel&#39;s instead. I thought, why not try something new! We made a reservation for 7pm. When we arrived, we were promptly greeted by the valet before heading in to the restaurant. My family and I were sat right away at a booth overlooking the marina. I&#39;m sure the view is amazing at sunset and was beautiful all lit up on a dark night as well. Our server was very warm, welcoming and knowledgable about the menu. I ordered the chicken with mashed potatoes with an extra side of lobster mashed potatoes. (It was my birthday, might as well go all out!) The food took a while to arrive, I would say 30-40 minutes. It was a Saturday night however, so I&#39;m sure this is typical. When the food finally arrived it was definitely worth the wait! The mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy and the chicken was cooked perfectly. If it&#39;s one thing I hate it&#39;s dry chicken, and this one was certainly not. The server then offered us a dessert on the house for my birthday. I like how they allow you to choose anything on the menu because everyone has different tastes when it comes to desserts. I decided on the skillet chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on the top. It was a gooey, chocolatey, delicious mess. Overall, I had a really great birthday dinner! All the food was cooked and seasoned well and our server was very accommodating. I just wish Daniel&#39;s stood out a little more! I don&#39;t think they offer anything different -- food or experience wise -- than other nice restaurants in Seattle."

Saturday night Daniel&#39;s again was excellent.   It was Saturday night so one normally expects the service, etc. to be most stressed and perhaps not as attentive as a less-busy evening.  Since we didn&#39;t get a window table, we opted for outside (hard to believe the weather ... dining outside at 7 p.m. in June ....).

Our server (Carmen) was just perfect .... attentive but not obsequious.  The food was outstanding ... just as we expected.  

While some restaurants rush you on a Saturday night to turn the table and serve more customers, our experience Saturday night was just the opposite.  The service timing was perfect.  We sat outside with drinks, dinner and dessert for a 2-hour experience (7 p.m. to 9 p.m.).   In june ... did I say how amazing that is????

I recommend this Daniel&#39;s ... especially compared with the S Lake Union Daniel&#39;s where the parking is crap and navigating through S Lake Union is not worth any destination.

We got a great table with a water and Mt. Rainier view.

Our steaks came out cooked perfectly and the broccoli side was good.

I love that the baked potato comes with the entrée, and you can load it with as much butter, soup cream, chives, and bacon you want!

The disappointment was dessert the cheesecake tasted floury like there was too much added or it wasn&#39;t mixed in well. My Irish coffee was supposed to have whipped cream on the top but it didn&#39;t. The nice part was we got a free dessert of their molten lava cake, if we had known beforehand we would not have ordered the cheesecake!"

From the start - the experience was SO strange. My arms were filled with gifts and two hosts at the from desk just looked at me...and kind of blinked. I would think someone would try to help. They never came around the desk. 
They then looked me up and down (dressed casually after a work day in Seattle office but in nice  dark jeans, booties and a designer silk scarf)?and decided and didn&#39;t help me carry any of the packages to our table. 
It took over 30 minutes to get a drink, 45 minute to order an appetizer, and 1 hour to order entrees. 
Flat water was never brought to our table, our sparkling water glasses went empty and our champagne and wine bottles also sat empty. 
More importantly our server seemed annoyed! My family is lively but polite. And we were quite excited to be catching up and chatting- which did distract from the incredibly long amount of time it took to receive our entrees. 
I understand that you may have been understaffed that evening- but having been in this position myself as a head of the house restaurant manager and now, working in a customer service role where demand is growing and I sometimes staff incorrectly or am surprised by volume of customers-  I understand  there is NO way to really fix this... You have to get creative! 
I was surprised that no one from your front desk was helping to serve and the waiter was not apologetic. A meal should not take 3 hours unless you want it to... And we didn&#39;t. We had to ask- can we place an order for apps , can we get more wine, can we order entrees. 
I would imagine you&#39;d send a complimentary entree or bottle of wine- something to offset the experience which is not up to par with dining at Daniels (this is what I used to do when I managed the front of the house in a previous career) or at the very least have the managed come and say hi, how are you. Thanks for your patience. 

No desert was brought for my mothers birthday- a candle in &#34;anything&#34; would have been nice. 
The valet was very polite and our waiter was not rude but he was not particularly friendly or apologetic either. 
I called that night after leaving our flowers behind- and the manager actually told me that she had given them to my brother- this was very helpful and nice of her. I tried to explain our sub par experience... But wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;m too sensitive to this due to my line of work, or if I was just tired so I stopped and just thanked her and said &#34;it happens&#34;. 

After speaking to my direct family today- this gets worse. We each, independently got ILL from our meals.  Very ill the next day. Not to mention they were cold, and my mothers and my steaks were SO salty we woke up grasping for water. This makes EVERYthing else a huge problem to me. 

This just stinks. I come to Daniels all the time with my boyfriend and mother for appetizers and wine in the bar in both Seattle and Bellevue- and while I will say the bar staff in Bellevue is less than inviting- both locations are a league above the leschi experience. I know this is a family owned business that takes great pride is customer service so, what&#39;s going on? 

It felt like we were imposing to be in your establishment. More than 2/3 of our party of adults got SICK from your food. I also felt that my initial concerns/ call that night were dismissed- because I didn&#39;t know where flowers were? Well, I&#39;m 100% certain of the other issues at hand. I had 1/2 a glass of champagne with our  meal which cost over 1k. 
I wasn&#39;t inebriated nor do I have unrealistic expectations... I&#39;ve been to this location and the others many times. 
Knowing that everyone else got sick too was the final straw. My mother was unable to attend her birthday celebrations the next day due to the food at your establishment- and I struggled though my work day (12/13) with nausea which could only have come from that meal. I will NOT be back here again for many reasons. I don&#39;t want to be judged by your hostesses and front of house staff, dismissed by a waiter, or worried about my physical well being. I would rafher get a dicks cheeseburger. That&#39;s sad to me, as Daniels is a sentimental place to me - especially the south lake Union location. But it&#39;s just too hard to enjoy a high end meal when the service or atmosphere feels low-end. 

The service and experience I recently had your establishment is easily trumped by a recent meal I had at the  Cheesecake Factory while traveling. That&#39;s kind of scary- and Not what I&#39;m used to at Daniel&#39;s . We won&#39;t be back , as this isn&#39;t a some one-offs  and goes far beyond a staffing issue (#of staff ) . It&#39;s about handling this after this meal had began to go awry and about your leadership setting standards for guest service. I thought to myself - I&#39;m at Daniels and I&#39;m praying someone brings me a glass of water... ?!?! 
I hope you resolve these serious issues and we can return to the &#34;old Daniels&#34; some day."

My first visit was for dinner, but we ended up deciding to get a couple of drinks and try a few appetizers instead. We enjoyed the ahi tuna, crispy artichoke hearts, and the mini dessert sampler... but the Dungeness Crab Legs were what really won us (or just me?) over. Why? They just serve the meat, so it&#39;s super easy to enjoy the crab without having to work to get to it! The portion looks small at first because it doesn&#39;t have the rest of the crab leg, but... the hard crab legs aren&#39;t what you eat anyway, so it&#39;s probably about the same amount of crab meat.

My second visit was for happy hour, so I enjoyed a glass of red wine and the bacon-wrapped scallops. The scallops were huge and very enjoyable, but I look forward to trying something else next time.

Service? Service has been fantastic each time. I&#39;ve definitely been impressed!

Do I plan to become a regular? No way. Am I likely to visit a Daniel&#39;s Broiler location again? Yes."

Truth is, if you&#39;re a half decent cook, it&#39;s hard to screw up a USDA prime steak.  So their steak is great, but USDA prime is naturally great.  They also have Alberta steak here sometimes if you come during the right times.  

Their appies and drinks are top notch.  I&#39;d come here for that, and cook USDA prime on my own grill and it&#39;ll taste even better.  Great Thursday or chill Friday happy hour place."

She said she&#39;d never had a steak at a restaurant before (kids these days), so I suggested we try Daniel&#39;s. I&#39;ve been to all the other big stake houses in town (Ruth&#39;s, The Met, etc.), and had been meaning to try this place for a while, so off we went. Since she&#39;d had no experience with steak, I wanted her to try a couple different kinds. So we ordered a Filet, and a New York, both medium. When they brought the steaks out, we excitedly cut into them. The Filet was cooked perfectly, but the New York was somewhere between rare and medium-rare. So our waitress offered to take it back and throw it back on the grill. Normally, I would ask them to make me a new one, because once you&#39;ve cut into a steak, it loses all it&#39;s juice, and you usually end up with a dry lump if you cook it more. But I was hungry, and I didn&#39;t want my girlfriend to dine alone, so I agreed. I also ordered a drink to pacify the time while i was was waiting. To their credit, the manager came over, offered his apologies, and gave us some sorbet. A few minutes later, the waitress came back with my steak (now perfectly cooked). But 15 minutes later, I still hadn&#39;t gotten my drink. So after multiple attempts to flag her down, I finally got her attention, and asked where my drink was. &#34;Oops, forgot about that&#34;, she said. Sigh. The steaks were both very good, and we got a couple of deserts to go (a Key Lime and a Coconut), which were also very good. But when I&#39;m paying $60 for a steak, I expect them to cook it right the first time. And when they don&#39;t, I at least expect them to up their service game to make up for it. Neither was the case here. The food was 3.5 stars. But sadly, the service just doesn&#39;t match the price tag."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the steaks are great, just very pricy but that&#39;s expected here.

Most recently my family and I came here to celebrate my parent&#39;s anniversary, we were running late and they were more than accommodating with the timeline. We did find it odd that the table was not ready by the time we arrived and when we sat down, nobody came by to ask us for drinks or fill our wart glasses for a solid five minutes. I found this odd with the quality and service that you are paying for.

Overall I have a nostalgia of special occasions at Daniel&#39;s but after my last experience here I think I&#39;ll be looking to celebrate special occasions somewhere else."

Such snarky, passive-aggressive behavior is unforgivable when dealing with the public. We had a large party and spent a considerable amount of money but her attitude was appalling.  Even when I complained, she never apologized. 

Daniel&#39;s had better watch out. If Bluwater gets their act together, people will leave in droves. 

I doubt that anyone in our party will ever return.

That being said, overall the food is good, although my friend sent back an over cooked lamb chop and then got a nearly raw one in return - dropped off with attitude by Victoria.  

But the bartenders do a nice job."

I am a big fan of Daniels, but the reason for only 3 stars was the poor timing of the meal. 

The highlights were the bookends -- appetizer &amp; dessert. The bacon wrapped scallops were incredible (although I was a little put off when the waitress said &#34;it comes with 3 - should I just include another one for you?&#34; Of course, says I, which she apparently added $6.00 to the bill).  On the back end, the coconut sundae was melt-in-your-mouth divine.

The not-so-good:  we waited 30 minutes for our appetizer... And then they brought out the bread minutes after the appetizer!  Strange, and we were starving... then at the end of the meal, we were half way through our dessert when the waitress brought our complimentary anniversary soufflé.  We couldn&#39;t even finish our dessert - and then a soufflé half way through?  Again, strange.  

We had a wonderful evening, but for $200+ I want the service to be spot on"

We have been faithfully coming to this Daniel&#39;s location for literally years.  We live in Bellevue and come across the bridge to Leschi because we usually love it; tonight all that changed.  Normally, great food, great service, great ambiance.  Tonight.... yikes.  I made a reservation 2 months ago, knowing that it being Valentine&#39;s Weekend (although not actual Valentine&#39;s Day) it might be a bit busier.  Well.... that thinking was correct, we arrived for our early-ish  5:15 reservation and the place was packed.  I should digress for a moment and say that my husband and I are very kind, not pushy people, who don&#39;t have an attitude.... but we will politely speak up and ask for what we need or kindly make a request (if at all possible to have that request accommodated) if we are going to drop $200 on dinner.  Anyway, I am 8 months pregnant and fairly uncomfortable.  We were seated at a table for two which was literally wedged in between 4 other 2 toppers.  It was so awkward, so uncomfortable, just downright ridiculous.  The lady next to me kept dropping utensils on the floor because there was so little room on the table top.  She couldn&#39;t even retrieve the items she dropped because she literally could not bend over to pick them up, due to the tables being situated so tightly.  We were basically competing with the adjacent tables trying to physically hear our dinner companions.....all the while looking around and seeing plenty of other tables of 2 people in large booths (at least a 4 top).  This was annoying for sure, but we somewhat understood.... since it&#39;s a busy weekend of course they are going to try to cram tables together and make the most $ possible.... even at the expense of their guests&#39; experience.  Alright, well, whatever.  After a few more moments of my trying to lean over my huge pregnant belly in effort to hear what my husband was trying to say to me across the table, we saw a table of 2 people in a more comfortable and spacious booth preparing to leave.  Quickly, my husband went up to the host stand and kindly requested that we be moved to their table once they departed, particularly due to my condition.  My husband was told that unfortunately, no, we could not be moved as that table was reserved for 4 people.  Alrighty then.... again, we understood... they would certainly prefer to seat 4 people there.  What was really unfortunate was what we saw about 10 minutes after the couple departed from the table we requested to be moved to: another couple was seated there... yes, just 2 people had that big old booth, no one joined them.  So we paid and left without eating dessert.  Then we drove back across the bridge and had dessert at John Howie Steak instead, which is always a consistently fabulous experience.  Same with El Gaucho.  We won&#39;t be back to Daniel&#39;s, even the Bellevue location....and we will certainly pass the word to avoid them on to friends and colleagues.  Disappointing!"

Everyone was so friendly, from the hostess when we arrived to the chef when we departed. Our server, Daniel (a little ironic), was very engaging, informative, and genuine. He made this trip a special one. We never felt rushed, he took his time with us. 

Then the food came out, Holy Cow!! We started with French Onion soup, yum. Then our entrees, best steaks we had ever eaten by quite a bit. Even dessert was a cut above. 

I would highly recommend Daniel&#39;s for any occasion. Definitely worth the drive. We&#39;ve found our new favorite restaurant. Thank you Daniel&#39;s and your staff. We will be back."

When John Schwartz was alive and ran these, they were always predictably first class.  Since John passed away, they have gone down hill - especially Leschi.

The last several times we have dined at Leschi and Lake Union, I have walked away feeling like I just got fleeced - that they have tried to separate me from the maximum amount of my money possible.  Yes, they have an upscale atmosphere, and the food is good most of the time, but they try to get the most money out of you possible and hope you won&#39;t notice.

This last experience confirmed that we will now look for other options when dining out.  We had been given a gift certificate, but forgot it at home.  We explained it to them, thinking that there are a number of ways they and we could work this out.  However, they let us know that they were not willing to work with us and that we would have to come back again in order to use it.  This included two people at the restaurant and two people at corporate.  They were not mean about it, but it was clear that they did not want to work with us and that they wanted to squeeze a second set of dinners out of us.  Can&#39;t prove that was their intention - but it is how it felt.

There are many top dining experiences in Seattle - every one of them better than Daniel&#39;s.  They have lost us for good.  Not worth the high prices."

FOOD: A really, really good steak! Not great, however. The outside was a little too seasoned for my liking, I like a simple steak, to which I dress that up Oscar style. The baked potato is noms, they bring you all sorts of sides to dress it up, which is a nice addition. 

SERVICE: The server comes around and shines a light on your steak to make sure your steak is cooked just the way you wanted it; that&#39;s a nice touch. 

AMBIANCE: Love the giant chandelier in this location; love the location on the water. Great view of downtown Bellevue! However, the restrooms are way out of date, and it&#39;s a bit disturbing when they don&#39;t update their restrooms. The prices they charge, they can definitely afford to update their space a bit. 

OVERALL: Really good steak, but I find that the Metropolitan Grill is the best steak in town. It&#39;s a great little date place, but for an amazing steak, go to Met Grill."

Unfortunately, my aunt-in-law made reservations at the Leschi location for my grandmother-in-law&#39;s 96th birthday.

The decor at Leschi hasn&#39;t changed in as long as I&#39;ve been going.  To compensate for a clearly outdated and worn down interior they keep the lights very low.  The service was good.  Jackee was attentive and friendly and got everything right.  I ordered a drink (blood and sand) that I didn&#39;t realize was obscure enough for the bartender not to know.  Instead of trying to describe how to make it, I opted for a signature cocktail, which was totally unremarkable. The wine by the glass was acceptable but expensive, like everything at Daniel&#39;s.  

The fried artichokes are good but they&#39;re just fried food.  Far better value when discounted at happy hour, which I heard they no longer offer.  I got the ribeye cooked medium rare.  It was cooked correctly but the composition was not as consistent as I&#39;d expect.  It was also incredibly salty.  Overly salty.  It came with mashed potatoes that were acceptable but boring.  We also got the creamed spinach, which was considerably less salty than the last time we went but unfortunately lacked much flavor.  It may be a traditional dish that has to be salty to be flavorful.  The lobster mashed potatoes are not much better than the regular ones but cost more.  My spinach pecan salad was okay except for being overdressed.  The wedge salad was good, according to my wife. The side of steamed broccoli was okay but overcooked and slightly mushy.  Two people got the key lime pie and were disappointed - apparently not much lime flavor.  I got the small coconut fudge sundae and it was plenty big and pretty tasty.  The volcano chocolate cake was by far the best.

In summary, Daniel&#39;s has essentially jumped the shark.  It&#39;s not great food unless you&#39;re a big salty steak fan.  It&#39;s a pretty terrible value when you consider the prices.  I would not have gone had it not been booked for me and I won&#39;t be returning.  There are simply far too many better options in greater Seattle."

We had high expectations, but was disappointed.  The most annoying part of dinner was how long everything took.  We arrived on time for our 7pm reservations and didn&#39;t step out of the restaurant until 9:45pm.  I should&#39;ve known it was going to be a long dinner.  Server didn&#39;t show up until 10 minutes after sitting down, saying how their computer was broken but just brought up.  He was good and prompt, took our orders right away.  We order appetizers as well as the 3-course dinner.  Appetizers and first courses came.  After we were done with those, they cleared out our plates, and we set with an empty table for probably a good 30 minutes.  Midway, our server did show up to inform us that they &#34;literally had 8 millions tickets that came in all at once&#34; so it will take another 9 to 15 minutes for our entrees to show up.  Asked us if we were doing okay?  Of course we said we were okay, what were we going to do, leave?  The server joked that we should be doing fine because we had a lot of appetizers so we shouldn&#39;t be hungry.  He was right, by the time the entree showed up, we had no appetite, especially when the food was mediocre.  Everything took forever to come.  The only time I have had that long of a meal was at Bouchon by Napa Valley, but that&#39;s because everything was so enjoyable and wonderful.  This was A LOT of waiting around.

The food was alright with nothing mind-blowing (good portion size though):  

Teriyaki filet migon.  The meat itself was delicious, but it was drenched in sauce.  
Crab and artichoke dip.  Real crab meat in the dip, but felt like something was missing. (we like Anthony&#39;s better).  
Fried calamari.  Probably the best thing out of dinner.
Clam chowder.  Good.
Pork Chop.  Super dry and overcooked.  My friend couldn&#39;t even finish it.
Short Ribs.  Not bad, but the sauce was oily.
Molten cake.  Fine, but not awesome.

To be fair, we didn&#39;t have any real steak from the restaurant.  We plan to go back to another location that&#39;s closer to us, and give it another try."

2 orders or filet mignon- both were over cooked, sent one back and thankfully it turn out better, garlic mashed was somewhat runny....

3 orders of halibut- all were dry, jasmine rice accompanied were almost like porridge...maybe they need a rice cooker??

The piano is a highlight for the bar, so much interaction with other guests and service staff and really made our anniversary memorable. 

The only downfall of Daniel&#39;s is the wine pricing.  I am in the industry and while a 300% mark up is standard Daniel&#39;s way more then that.  $55 for a $10 bottle of prosecco?  I nearly cancelled our reservation because of the wine pricing alone.. but I chose instead to go to a nearby bar and get our first rounds of drinks at a far more reasonable price before dining here.

There were other couples who were already dining at the window overlooking the marina, but for us, arriving for a 6:45pm reservation, despite having booked well in advance, there seemed to be only one table in the back, squeezed in between a window overlooking the street, an emergency exit which appeared to double as a storage area for chairs, and a large group, while waiters almost constantly squeezed in behind me to serve that table.

Our meal didn&#39;t get off to a good start because they don&#39;t have the wine that sister property Chandler&#39;s Crabhouse serves, a sweet red bubbly Italian.  Seemingly because we didn&#39;t opt for a bottle of something else, our waiter was visibly displeased and seemed to lose interest in serving us. The by-the-glass Riesling we went with instead was subpar, lacking real character despite it hardly being the least expensive option.

The filet mignon was excellent, not outstanding. The turkey dinner was squeezed onto an oval steak plate. One star out of 5 for presentation. The white meat lacked character and seemed to come from one of those precooked birds you can buy at your local supermarket; the dark meat on the other hand was excellent. Dessert was unimpressive overall. The group next to us got ice cream with their pumpkin pie. Our waiter didn&#39;t bother to suggest that option, nor did he suggest coffee or tea service. 

When we asked for refills of the wine and later a bottle of sparkling water, it seemed to take forever. The waiter&#39;s excuse was that the bar tender kept stepping away, whereas we could see the waiter wasting time chatting up the tall, blond bus girls.

There is no line on the receipt to add an additional tip so you might want to bring cash if you pay with plastic and intend to tip extra on top of the standard 20% service charge. I would have been more than happy to, given the occasion, (a) splurge on drinks and (b) tip extra but the lousy table set up and the lackluster table service clearly seemed to prevent me from being able to do so. The Valet service on the other hand was clearly deserving of a good tip as they were working without umbrellas in the pouring rain and did an excellent job.

For the happening atmosphere, the location and the prestige, if not for the effort of all the staff this Thanksgiving, I would gladly go back to Daniel&#39;s Broiler. Considering I&#39;ve gotten a much better table without a reservation before, I&#39;m just not sure if I&#39;ll make it a planned visit next time. Dress is casual. Valet, lot and off-street parking."

The cheapest steak was $57. To rich for my blood. So we had the cheapest meal we could. Scallops and the other meal was pawns. They were booth very good but certainly in my mind over priced at $38.  

The place was nice, the service was good, but quite spendy. Parking starts at $6 and goes up from there."

The food was good as expected. The service not so much. If your going to force me to pay a 20% tip for service of 7 people, i expect great service. Otherwise, i can go to the Met or El Gaucho oe elsewhere for steak just as great and get great service.

We had an 8:30 reservation. When we arrived we were told our table wasn&#39;t ready. We were offered to wait on the deck. There was seating on the deck, no wait, so we informed the server we are happy to sit out there if it would remain open. It was, sonwe thought we were set. I went the ladies room expecting to come back to our set table. I met my party on the deck to find them still waiting for someone to put a table together. Mind you there were 3 hostesses up front. We had to ask if we could put OUR OWN table together outside since no one that worked there was going to do it. (paying 20% tip here...) 

Next some woman came by to ask if we were there for appetizers. (I was confused what this womans role was and had to ask if she was our server..)  We informed her we were interested in steaks. When we got the menus, she proceeded to talk about apps instead of steaks. We got the sense she didn&#39;t want to be there nor did she want us there and she was trying to rush us out. This treatment continued through the meal. Even after we ordered a bottle of wine and 5 steaks. One would think they should be trying to get us to stay and rack up our bill to increase their tip. 

The Somm was amazing and that is where the delight ended. 

When food.is conparable place to place your competative advantage isnyour people and service. When service suffers, ill go elsehwre. We had much better service at Serious Pie earlier that day and that server got a much smaller tip. It&#39;s unfortunate that places force a 20% tip so the server doesn&#39;t have to earn it. I was a disappointed in Daniel&#39;s. I doubt I&#39;ll be back."

I&#39;ve been to get one in Bellevue and this place is much better in term of service. The staff was very friendly and nice even though I customized my dishes a little. The food was also of Hugh quality. The Caesar salad was norma, Nothing special. The salmon was pretty good though, not dry, and it has a nice balance with the lemon. The dessert was superb. The creme brulé was spot on with nice crispy sugar top and soft and decadent inside. The cake was also rich and moist, everything went well and it was a balanced meal"

It was super busy and we weren&#39;t able to sit until about a half hour after our reservation. The white meat turkey was dry, the dark meat was good; the gravy and stuffing were salty; the complimentary bread came with salt-sprinkled butter. The cranberry sauce came in a tiny cup next to plain old mashed potatoes. They had run out of prime rib (which was one of the Thanksgiving meals offered)  so they gave us steak instead. The appetizers and desserts were passable. The waiter was nice enough but seemed rush and didn&#39;t offer coffee with dessert. Since the 20% gratuity was included,  there may have not been incentive to give great service. We really enjoyed the views of the city since we got to sit by the window. Overall though, I&#39;d say I&#39;m not coming back because it seemed like I could have made better food at home."

The first visit I was part of the party and I didn&#39;t have the tab, gave cash to a pal... so I did not see the bill. 
Trip #2 I did have the bill and HELLO &#34;20% Service Charge.&#34;
I hate this. 
Yes, I do understand your fair city passed an oppressive wage ordnance that is strangling small businesses ... but then, after chatting with the manager that the 20% charge won&#39;t go directly to servers? WHAT?!
I don&#39;t have any more Seattle trips planned until 2017 but I just may take my serious eating outside the city limits or only eat @ restaurants that don&#39;t play games like this. 
I DO WANT to tip my server. This is #Mericuh, we do that here. 
In both cases my service was EXCELLENT. We had, honestly, very good service but this 20% fee, and the management&#39;s attitude with regards to explaining it to us made my FACE EXPLODE. It&#39;s rare that I lose my composure or wit and can&#39;t think of something witty to say in retort... 
Grrrrrrrrrrr. Ungood Daniel&#39;s! Ungood I say!!
So, the food? I dunno, dude ... I ate and drank everything. It was pretty respectable quality, about what I&#39;d expect for the price anyway. 
I am not a big wine drinker but my dining companions, one of whom works in the hospitality industry, snickered at how $pendy the wine was. For a beer kinda&#39; city the beer selection was just meh. 
Steak was OK, about what I expect for the price (at the $$$$ pricepoint, I demand steak be perfect - it was). On trip #2 I had a burger it was a solid 4 stars ... 
I am not a seafood bubba so I cannot speak to that aspect of the restaurant. 
So yeah ... food is on-par with other $$$$ restaurants. We had great service, exactly what I expect at a $$$$ restaurant. Atmosphere is pretty cool with great views of Lake Union. 
If you don&#39;t mind the 20% fee, you&#39;ll enjoy it!
Cheers."

We made reservations and were seated promptly. The waiter was polite and knowledgeable.   I got the prime rib and my husband got the bone in ribeye. We got asparagus as our side and I&#39;m wishing we took the waitress recommendation with the spinach, it was so so. Oysters were fresh and atmosphere was great. I would definitely go there again."

A friend took me here for my craving of their bacon wrapped scallops! Usually comes as a trio but for a few more bucks the server suggested we add an extra so both of us would have two (great idea)! For dinner my friend had the lobster bisque and the other favorite, steak bites. My dinner was certainly delicious knowing you can never go wrong with a nice 8oz filet mignon medium rare win a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes. I&#39;m already drooling again... 

I appreciate our server for being very well mannered and attentive throughout our dinner. Definitely can&#39;t wait to go back for happy hour!"

President Obama was in town and the freeways were shutdown while he was in transit which caused us to be late for our reservation. I called in let the host know we would not be arriving on time.

We arrived about 45 minutes later. Luckily it was too busy that evening and we were quickly seated in area we could view the marina. It was a very romantic environment and our server was extremely friendly by providing us with info on the nearest sights.  She presented the wine list and continued to check on us. My girlfriend wished to order the prime rib which is one of their most popular entrees. Unfortunately, the prime rib was sold out, however, the server said when making a reservation you can request prime rib and they will reserve one for you which is pretty cool.

My girlfriend had the bone-in NY strip and I had the 30 oz. bone-in Rib Eye. Our server asked us to cut into the center of our steaks to ensure proper temperature and both were perfect. I orders the Lobster mashed potatoes and while very tasty, the cream and bacon overpowered the taste of the Lobster. Other than that, the food was wonderful. 

Overall, you get what you pay for and we were VERY satisfied. The ambiance, the food and the service were all top notch and I would not hesitate to return!"

Great Ales on Tap selection, very friendly service.  Very good quality food.  I rarely give a negative review, but I had a real problem with a policy I experienced when presented with my bill.  They tacked on a &#34;20% Service Charge&#34; automatically without any notice or warning.  I was just one solo guy having dinner at the barony a large group or anything.  I find this practice distasteful and offensive.  Now, keep in mind that I was going to PROBABLY tip 20% anyway for the great service.  However, I find this practice very offensive and distasteful when they do it automatically, taking my choice away.   Based on the foregoing, I would not return to this establishment, nor would I recommend it to a friend or colleague."

The French onion soup is fantastic, I highly recommend (only complaint is the crouton on top of soup with cheese was burnt, I am surprised it was sent out of the kitchen that way). The salads were great! The appetizers were fabulous. The main entrees were good. I did not enjoy the cream of spinach. The horseradish sauce with my prime-rib
had an off taste to me, so I requested fresh instead. The waiter was very nice, but my mother &amp; sister have an allergy to gluten, we continued to ask about dishes if they had gluten or not &amp; they had to keep checking or said &#34;yes I think so&#34; or &#34;no I don&#39;t think so&#34;, it was a bit frustrating, I think that Daniel&#39;s should have a gluten free menu or better educate the staff.

Seated right away, our waiter was so nice and helpful and professional. 

We ordered Caesar salad and lobster bisque to start. Food came quickly and was very delicious and fresh.  We ordered filet mignon as our main course. It came with mashed potatoes and vegetables and was DELICIOUS!!! I&#39;m not much of a steak person but this was just too good! 

Our waiter helped make our experience the best it could possible be, he was so attentive and helpful and offered us lots of suggestions. 

When we ordered dessert- chocolate covered strawberries, he came back and apologized profusely that the dessert wasn&#39;t available anymore and we ended up getting a different dessert on the house. 

We had a great experience and will be back soon!"

Normally, I order the prime rib with no extras. I have had the salads and appetizers which lead me to the conclusion they are not above standard for a steakhouse. As for the prime rib, they serve a good product but not worthy of the premium price. You can find equal quality for less.

While I feel they sever a good product and provide good service I can&#39;t say I am going to return anytime soon, if at all. If I do, I&#39;ll return for another cut of steak."

HH items we ordered: 
-Steak sliders with fries: two tiny sliders with the thinner kind of fries. Steak was decent but the slider only had some cooked onions on them aside from the bread. Very forgettable, you can probably skip this one. 
-Burger: very flavorful, loved the crispy bacon. This came with thicker steak fries which were good. You can ask for them to cut this for you - great for sharing actually. 
-Calamari: I thought this was quite good, the pieces aren&#39;t heavily breaded so you actually taste the squid. 
-Popcorn shrimp: not the crunchy kind of texture you&#39;d expect, but also pretty good. Between the calamari and popcorn shrimp, I&#39;d get calamari if you want some finger food. (Or be polite and use a fork, whatever.) 
-Lobster mac and cheese: so savory and the best thing we tried! The lobster tail was really good, lots of meat, and the cheese is very rich. If you&#39;re not into stinkier cheeses, maybe not for you. I loved that it was penne, so it kind of carries more cheese in each bite! 

The service was pretty iffy and our waitress was uncomfortably awkward, but we got our food and they made sure we were satisfied. So overall, nothing over the top to rave about in terms of service but it wasn&#39;t terrible. What do you expect from a crowded bar at HH?

The service and staff were great, we both ordered two bone in ribeye steaks with lobster mac n cheese. We got our food and after trying really hard to like my steak I sent it back because it was so charred on the outside that it felt like I was biting straight into coal. I ordered my steak medium rare by the way. The manager came and defended the steak by saying they are finished to have bit of char like flavor. I thanked him for remaking my steak. By the time my new steak came out, my partner was done with his meal and my steak was much better this time around. 

I gave my partner a taste and he said if he knew he would&#39;ve sent his back too because he thought that overwhelming char taste was normal (he didn&#39;t know better)

We paid for our tab and went home....

Later that night, my partner woke up sick as a dog. Vomiting, and with bad stomach pain and a headache. He called into his command (he&#39;s military) and spent the day trying to recover at home. We knew it was the dinner because we had a very light breakfast and skipped lunch to have that big awesome meal we were planning to have. 

I called management that same morning and let them know, they offered apologies and asked for my phone number and address. He asked if we would like someone to follow up with us, and I paused. I didn&#39;t think it would be necessary. He then said, he recommended for someone from the restaurant&#39;s staff to follow up. I agreed. 

To this day, I never received a call, a letter, carrier pigeon or smoke signal to check on my ill husband. 

My partner spent two and a half days recovering, over $200 and a ruined anniversary dinner."

Our steaks were perfect and the creme brûlée dessert tasted like heaven! 

It&#39;s the service that was lacking. After our food was delivered our waitress didn&#39;t check on us once. My water glass sat empty for almost our entire meal which, to me, is a litmus test of the level of service we are receiving. We sat waiting for her to notice that we had finished eating so she could offer to box up our food....that never happened. Instead a manager stopped by and asked how everything was so I told him--he took our food back immediately  and packaged it up. 

Finally, when our check came we noticed an almost $10 up charge on my fiancé&#39;s steak. 
She had offered him an option of having his steak encrusted with peppercorns which he said yes to. What she failed to mention was that there was an additional cost associated with that &amp; was that ok with us. 

Good customer service includes keeping the person you are serving informed and letting them make choices based on the information you supply them with.

So I&#39;m left feeling disappointed with my Daniel&#39;s experience; I expected a higher level of service from such a well known &amp; high end restaurant."

This place has changed since last time we were here and I believe it has to do with the mandatory 20% tipping. The atmosphere was nice (9), the employees (4) there was nobody smiling and our waitress definately didn&#39; t go out of her way to earn 20%, food (7) steak strip small portion but very good - crab &amp; artichoke dip was a 6, and the drinks (8). Overall it wasn&#39;t the fun atmosphere it use to be. The only thing that I could think of is that nobody had to earn their tip because it is now included on your bill.

My glass was never empty, and I always recieved the exact drink which I had originally ordered.

I have seen restaurants add 20% gratuities when there are parties of 6 or more, but I was only here with one other person (we were sitting in the bar - maybe it is limited to that area?).  I might not have even cared that much if the service warranted a 20% tip on our expensive wine, but the service was just average.  She only came by 3 times - to give us our food/clear the table and to give us our expensive wine.  And there was barely anyone in the bar (which I found odd, given that when I&#39;ve visited in the past, it&#39;s usually quite crowded - maybe people are protesting the 20% gratuity).

The food is great usually, don&#39;t get me wrong but the server sucked and today the food was just so-so. First of all the server messed up my dads order he ordered bake potato they gave him mashed(no biggie my dad said it was ok). Second of all my moms salmon was raw in the middle she only ate the outer cooked part. For me personally I don&#39;t mind a little rareness in my salmon but she didn&#39;t like it at all. It was super rare. They asked everyone with steaks to check the doneness of the steak but didn&#39;t ask my mom to check her salmon. Third of all my wife&#39;s filet was too rare also. She asked medium but got med-rare. She didn&#39;t wanna send it back because it took forever for the food to come out and we didn&#39;t have much time to wait for them to redo it. So that part is not really their fault, she ate it anyways. Fourth of all we ordered a pasta alfredo for my 4 year old daughter which is a small portion no less but that came out 5-10 minutes later then the steaks and salmon did. And when it came out the garlic bread they served with it was burnt. Oh and I also forgot the clam chowder was very salty today. My dad loves salty food but for him to say something is salty must mean they prolly dropped the whole container of salt in it or something. My dad adds salt or soy sauce to everything so if he says it&#39;s salty then it must be bad. So that was for the food... now about our server. My wife asked for fries with her filet and the server asked her if she wanted ketchup and my wife said yes. She never got it. We would have checked with our server but she NEVER came back to check on us. The table behind us got ok service because I think she came back with a dessert menu for them. And that was basically the only time I think she was in the area. I went to smoke and go wash my hands and when I looked around. It wasn&#39;t that busy. Parking lot had like 4-6 cars in it. Valet prolly had a few as well. Over all. Not that busy. Bar area was empty so I don&#39;t understand why our server would not check back at least 1 time to see how things are going. After this I am never coming back here again. We could have saved ourselves 400$ and went to some other place. I would have taken them to el gaucho or aqua or Anthony&#39;s if I&#39;d known it was going to suck like this. My wife and I tried to take my parents out for a change to some place nice and it ended up being horrible. I feel bad their first experience was so bad. Usually this place is good but I guess we won&#39;t ever know if they got better or not. I&#39;d rather take them to the metropolitan, el gauchos or John howie when we wanna take them to a nice place."

We have come here on other occasions as well and the food has always been spectacular, as it should be for the price tag you are paying. I have enjoyed their steaks on multiple visits but I also love their Dungeness Crab Stuffed Prawns, lobster mashed potatoes, and grilled mushrooms. I appreciate the special touches that they go out of their way to give when they know you are celebrating something special. And...the view of Lake Union. If you reserve a table overlooking the water, they will note it and try their best to accommodate. I think the only downside is their parking lot.

Gorgeous view or the lake and a beautiful sunset sky. Parking was awesome cuz someone handed us their parking sticker good till the next morning. 

For food - the bread they give you is deliciously soft and decadent. The appetizer wr got was the tuna tartar ehich was yummy, though maybe a tad heavy on thr vinegar. I like it that way though...  The boyfriend and I both got steaks since we were at a steakhouse...both our steaks were cooked to temperature but not well trimmed. Cutting into my steak to make sure it was cooked correctly was almost a chore as my knife just wouldn&#39;t cut through a tendon (which should just melt away) and the waiter waits to see that you steak is cooked ok. My dessert was the creme brule which was cooked to perfection. The custard was amazing and that&#39;s always the hard part to get right. The sugar top emitted a very satisfying crunch as I burrowed through it, too.

All in all, an OK meal but I felt the steaks we could&#39;ve cooked all home, which is a shame. For the $250 bill I expected a better main dish. Amazing appetizer and dessert can only make up so much."

We finally got our Seattle birthday extravaganza planned out, including a dinner at Daniel&#39;s Broiler.  I made reservations a few days before through OpenTable and mentioned it being a late birthday celebration. 

We arrived at Daniel&#39;s to find a gorgeous restaurant and bar.  We were then seated and honestly, I think we were given the best seats in the house.  We were in a quiet area right in front of the window overlooking the marina and beautiful Lake Union.  Our hostess was sweet and our server, Alex, was awesome.  Alex read us like a book and came to check up on us only when appropriate.  I really dislike when servers aren&#39;t intuitive about the timing of their interactions with their guests, but Alex&#39;s timing was spot on.  Every interaction we had with the Daniel&#39;s Broiler staff was superb.

We started off with a couple drinks, a Sea of Cortez and a Puebla Margarita.  Both were delicious, I would highly recommend either of them if you&#39;re open to tequila drinks.  For an appetizer we split the dungeness crab and artichoke dip.  There are quite a few variations of crab and artichoke dips, but Daniel&#39;s does this dip the best.  I have a ridiculously sensitive mouth when it comes to toasted bread, but the accompanying crostinis were toasted to perfection.  Next we got an heirloom caprese salad which contained THE most delicious tomatoes I&#39;ve ever eaten.  There were two varieties of tomatoes in the salad, one being red and one yellow.  The tomato slices were cut thick, my ideal thickness in fact.  I told my sister that I felt like I was eating the color yellow when I consumed the yellow tomato.  It was so bright tasting and scrumptious!  We also shared the Daniel&#39;s blue cheese shrimp salad which was very tasty.  I rarely trust a restaurant to dress my salad for me but Daniel&#39;s dressed this salad excellently, not too heavy or too light.  The Rogue Creamery blue cheese had just the right amount of bite and creaminess.  

We didn&#39;t get any of the traditional entrees as we had eaten a late lunch and weren&#39;t super hungry.  We did, however, get the lobster bisque and the french onion soup.  The lobster bisque was the consistency of a quintessential bisque and the flavor was SO rich!  My mouth felt like it was filled with a soupy bit of lobster heaven.  The french onion soup was also a great consistency, and enjoyably herbaceous.  The little bread slices were a good thickness and the cheese on top was perfectly melted.  

Like everyone else, I was a little put off by the 20% added on to the bill.  It is the restaurant owner&#39;s job to pay their employees, and they should have been paying their employees a livable wage before they were required to by law.  No one should have to rely on tips to live.  Not to mention, I&#39;m sure their servers receive less money in tips now that Daniel&#39;s has this extra 20% charge.  The fact that Daniel&#39;s is putting their responsibility of paying their employees on the customer is pretty... disappointing.  Shame on you for that, Daniel.    

Overall Daniel&#39;s Broiler is fantastic.  The staff is well trained, and meets my expectations when it comes to service at a fine dining restaurant.  I really appreciate their consideration of my reservation request and them honoring the complimentary birthday dessert (which was delicious) despite it being a belated celebration.  The food and drinks at Daniel&#39;s Broiler are excellent, the view is gorgeous and the service is exquisite."

The restaurant is clean and the staff were very friendly. Our server was great as well. Why such a low rating? Well for this holiday brunch Daniels Broiler had a fixed menu.. Everyone in our group had either eggs Benedict or a crab omelette. Both of the orders of eggs Benedict came out with incredibly over cooked eggs. Absolutely solid yokes! The omelettes where very simple and ingredients very inconsistent between our three orders. At $50/person (without drinks) for a basic, below average quality breakfast I think Daniels Broiler lost a chance at our business in the future."

I sat at the bar to eat ordering the artichoke hearts and steak sliders.  The artichokes were rather ordinary overall.  The sauce for them was lacking flavor.  

My sliders were requested without onions, came with.  An annoyance but could be picked off.  The buns were burnt not just browned or grilled.  The sandwiches overall were lacking flavor.

I would attempt to return another time and try sitting in the restaurant to see if there would be any improvement."

Given all that one pays, one expects a certain standard.  It was hit and miss at Daniel&#39;s.

I got the delmonico. It came with probably .10 inch of butter/sauce slathered over the entire steak.  Not sure how one can taste a good cut of steak when it&#39;s swimming in butter.

On my Wells Fargo VISA gift-card, he told me the confusion stemmed from a 20% reduction of value of the card itself, by VISA, if it is used for a restaurant visit. I&#39;ve yet to confirm this with Wells Fargo VISA, but I can accept that. What I can&#39;t accept is the fact the restaurant still refused the reduced value of the card. It&#39;s still worth money. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s use is restricted to only certain retailers. Huh.

Regarding my wife&#39;s drink order, the GM said my wife spoke with a very thick-accent. Yes, she is an immigrant, and a naturalized US citizen but, she has resided in the US the past 30 years, a graduate of advanced education, and her English is excellent. 

Excellent to the point where she works for a local defense-contractor building high-resolution displays for military aircraft. She engages in design application meetings with engineers based in St Louis, LA, and Huntsville. In order for her to function in that environment, she needs to have excellent English-speaking skills. So, strike against the server. That was a poor excuse for that situation. The server said she didn&#39;t understand the issue with the lack of prime-rib, and said I was mistaken regarding the couple that was seated after us. She said, they were seated well before us. Funny that table was cleared, reset, and the couple came in remarking the weather as they removed their coats. Strike two. The server also said she announced to us the prime-rib had run-out prior to taking our order. Uh, strike three.

The GM concluded it was a combination of misunderstandings, and hoped we wouldn&#39;t hold the experience against them. He wished we would return to have a nice meal in the future, and said he was send a complimentary Daniels gift card for that event. I thought that was nice and thanked him for his consideration.

I received a Daniels gift card in the amount of $50, the same amount as the tip I left, even though we were chased-down for it.

I guess I&#39;ll have a nice meal consisting of a few appetizers, and maybe one drink.

By myself. 

Because that&#39;s all that gift card will cover, less tip, of course. I guess beggars can&#39;t be choosy. Sheesh."

We decided to keep the lobster tail because we were really hungry, that way we had something to eat while we sent back the salmon. 

The salmon came back pink, like I can smell sulfur in the air as soon as I cut through it, kind of pink. 

The 3 appetizers we got were good, but you really can&#39;t run a restaurant on good appetizers, and over done entrees.

I realize they specialize in steak, but if you&#39;re going to have fish on the menu and charge a premium for it, you should know how to prepare it."

The front of the house and wait staff was superior. Although the food was awesome it was over priced. The main reason for the low review was the simple fact that a 20% service fee was automatically added to my bill for a party of three. Upon talking to the staff I was told that because of the increase of the minimum wage to $15 per hour in 2017 the management decided to build the increase of labor costs into the 20% fee. I understand the need to increase pricing in order to increase wages but the wage increase won&#39;t go into effect for another eight months. When I&#39;m paying more than $70 for one steak I would assume they are making enough profit to pay a decent wage to their employees. I can honestly say I will not be returning to Seattle for a weekend trip or vacation anytime soon. There are too many other cities out there who want my tourist dollars without an additional 20% requirement. *Don&#39;t tell me what to tip*

Just be aware - as a customer you won&#39;t be informed of the additional 20% fee until you have finished your dinner. You won&#39;t be told of the fee when you arrive."

My friends and I came to Daniel&#39;s Broiler this past weekend for happy hour.  We had never been for HH before and took the opportunity to go since we were in the neighborhood.  

The bar menu looked promising and our food delivered.  The  teriyaki steak bites (filet mignon steak strips) were tender and flavorful and our fried artichoke was crispy and just delicious with the aioli.  We also ordered a few drinks, and though I can&#39;t remember the names of them, they were all tasty and refreshing.   Oh, and the crème brûlée at the end of the night completely satisfied the sweet tooth. 

The bar had the Mariner&#39;s game playing on the TV screen and throughout the night, had an awesome, engaging pianist playing music, singing, and taking requests.  

As always, our service was impeccable and my friends and I had a great time."

- Daniel&#39;s Cut Filet Mignon 12 oz
- New York 12 oz
- dungeness crab-stuffed prawns (with crispy polenta cake, asparagus, creole barbecue sauce)
- Seared ahi tuna for an appetizer
- Oysters on the Half Shell
- Lobster Club salad
- Vegetarian menu salad

The Daniel&#39;s Cut Filet Mignon was very well done even though we asked for it medium well but the seasoning and cut was very good, making it incredibly delicious despite being well done. The only side it came with was potatoes which is perfect considering the large portion sizes. Any additional vegetables had to be ordered separately (I.e broccoli, etc.).

The mussels were really really good. I highly recommend this appetizer. The mussels and steak were my two favorite dishes of all the ones I ordered. 

The wait staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable of everything on the menu. He loved to joke around with our table which made the experience more fun.

The obvious and only downside to Daniels broiler is the price. It can be a bit steep if you&#39;re on a budget, but the location and views of the waterfront offer a fine dining experience that is worth the splurge at least one time. The other downside is the fact that most vegetable sides (except potatoes for steaks) must be ordered separately in addition to the meal for sometimes an extra. $10-$12 which is even more expensive. 

Another kinda big downside is there is no free parking. The valet is $6 and the parking lot requires a fee as well. 

All in all I would say Daniels broiler is a great dining experience with excellent steaks and seafood. A definite must try at least once for those looking for a waterfront steakhouse experience Seattle&#39;s South Lake Union neighborhood :)"

Food:

We shared the fried calamari (average), the 30 oz porterhouse (to die for), lobster mashed potatoes (even better than it sounds), and sautéed kale (good but a little too creamy and rich than what I needed given all the other items we ordered). 

Service:

Really good service. Our water glasses were always full, timing of food delivery and checkins was good and all of our questions about the menu were answered thoroughly. We also got a really lovely table overlooking the harbor / docked boats. 

Overall:

We will be coming back the next time we are in Seattle. This place is definitely a treat for a special occasion."

Needless to say Daniel&#39;s has been a tradition in my boyfriends family for Birthday&#39;s, Anniversaries and Christmas Eve&#39;s. So I have gone for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday every year, his mother&#39;s, every single Christmas eve, my own birthday&#39;s and 1 anniversary .... you could say that I am a bit spoiled, but the truth is, there is a reason why Daniel&#39;s is &#34;our place&#34; and its because of the food, the impeccable service, the wonderful atmosphere and the gorgeous view! You can&#39;t beat this place! Our favorite server is Eric because his is an absolute joy to engage with and he &#34;knows&#34; when we are there and exactly why!

Daniel&#39;s Broiler definitely has the makings of an upscale steak restaurant, especially with $6 valet (which I find out at the end of the meal can be validated, phew) and $40+ prices. Be prepared to spend at least $50 a person with alcohol, taxes, and tip.

The beautiful views of the lakefront will distract you from the prices, hopefully. But the steaks are legit. Healthy portions and cooked to the proper temperature. You get your choice of mashed potatoes, baked potato (which was very good), broccolini or sliced tomatoes. And if you split your entree, you both get sides and your steaks will be brought out cut in half.

Unless you can eat a lot of meat in one sitting, myself not included, some of the bigger cuts like boneless ribeye is perfectly enough for two people. You can get an appetizer or salad, which will be a nice complement to the meal.

Wines were hit or miss. I&#39;m not familiar with Washington wines but the ones by glass had the same hit/miss rate as California wines in Bay Area restaurants. Sommelier was kind of a douchebag so I would stay away from his recommendations.

All in all, a solid meal if you like meat or seafood. Great place for a special occasion (make sure you ask for a window seat)."

The NY I had on my most recent visit did not have the marbling and flavor I would expect from a prime NY and it was actually kind of tough.  My wife felt similarly about her filet.

The food was excellent and the view is beautiful overlooking SLU. 

It is expensive (count on $50+ for steaks and $35+ for seafood entrees) but the quality and presentation is excellent. Steaks come with your choice of potato or garlic mashed potatoes which is nice. Some of the other steakhouses around town charge for potatoes as a side so I appreciate that the steak comes with a starch.

I had the 12 oz. filet mignon ($62) and it was excellent.

We had the spinach as a side as well as the spicy shrimp and both were delicious.

For a steakhouse (comparing to Metropolitan Grill and El Gaucho) the service is very good but not the &#34;meet your every need before you even know it&#39;s a need&#34; level. Still very good though.

One thing I noticed is they were eager to take our plates. I don&#39;t like when servers are asking to take away your plate when you are still eating. It makes you feel rushed and not relaxed. When spending $200+ on dinner you want to feel relaxed.

They were great at refilling our Arnold Palmers! 

All in all I wouldn&#39;t hesitate at all to go back for any occasion. I would like to try their bar menu which seems more approachable than their dinner menu.

It is still my favorite over all the other chain steak houses that are just not that good (ruth steak, Mortons and McCormicks).  Those chains are horrible.

Checking my 80+ reviews I rarely complain about cost but in the case of Daniels I have to make an exception because of the disconnect between dollars for value. No real difference between Daniels and every upscale steakhouse I&#39;ve ever dined at, save the 10-15% higher prices. One example: $63 for a basic filet mignon + $5 more for a dab of bernaise---c&#39;mon Daniels, REALLY---$63 wasn&#39;t stiff enough---you needed to jack me for that extra $5?!?!

Good news is that my minor nitpick won&#39;t make a bit of difference because Daniels was packed, probably always is---but as a dedicated Yelper I need to warn my fellow Yelpers that they&#39;re gonna get a little soaked, that&#39;s all!!"

With huge windows wrapping around the perimeter, this is a phenomenal place to enjoy Seattle while cozily ensconced in warmth.  The chic atmosphere and upscale lounge, complete with a stone fire pit, is nothing short of resplendent. 

The menu is your standard steakhouse fare, you can choose you cut, sauce, and additional add ons. They&#39;ve also got salads and seafood, plus several rotating specials.  

Started with the Bacon Wrapped Alaskan Weatherane Scallops, something that is always a winning combination. The scallops themselves were perfectly cooked, but it was a bit disappointing that only 3 came to the order, and I&#39;m not quite sure why they were served atop toast.  Proportionally, you aren&#39;t going to get a scallop with each bite of bread, and I feel like it was an unnecessary addition. 

Ordered the swordfish with sweet potato and fried polenta hash.  It was perfectly competent although perhaps a touch too salty, and the swordfish was quite dry (although that could just be the nature of the fish).  Also tried some of the filet mignon and Delmonico steaks (served with served with a choice of Daniel&#39;s garlic mashed potatoes or jumbo baked potato).  The meats were very tender, although nothing particularly out of the ordinary.  The potatoes were adequate too.

I wouldn&#39;t say the meal was unforgettable or something worth going out of the way for, but if you&#39;re looking for a well-cooked steak, they can definitely deliver.  The stunning views are clearly the restaurant&#39;s selling points though."

We decided to give it another try last night and it was very disappointing.  Bar service was horrible.  My wife finished her drink and watched an empty glass for 10 minutes while the bartenders checked their phone and flirted with the cocktail servers.  We had the ribeye steak which wasn&#39;t bad.  After dinner I asked for a dessert and two bailey&#39;s and coffee.  It didn&#39;t take long to realize the bartender had forgotten.  When I asked about it he pretended like he didn&#39;t forget so I just cancelled and asked for the check. Then they couldn&#39;t get my Schwartz Brothers reward card to swipe and instead of getting it fixed they gave me a manual slip to call a number or something to get credit.  I said it was OK I wouldn&#39;t be coming back and he didn&#39;t seem to care.  It pained me to sign the $134 Bill that included 20% for the worst service ever.  Sad to see a great restaurant with awesome views and good people deteriorate so quickly. Never going back.

Furthermore, the meal itself was interrupted minimum 25 times by over-attentive waiters who kept interrupting conversation to ask to refill the drinks or how we were doing, and were convinced that a mojito was a blended ice drink with bananas. 

I won&#39;t be going back and I suggest others avoid the rib eye minimum at this place, unless they are dead set on overpaying for a steak that has been ruined by over seasoning. 

The only positive was the oysters on the half shell were fresh."

We had the shrimp pancake appetizer, Taiwan sausage plate, beef noodle soup (very tender beef, mild but tasty spice), Mala Tang ( a delish tofu, red bean cake, seafood and beef pieces, swimming in a way too hot to eat chili oil soup, so I just fished out the tasty morsels, it was so hot I wondered if the soup is just for soaking, lol?) 
For teas we had: Red Date Logan Hot tea with our meal and a mango milk tea with baba for my dessert. 
We def will be back as we will need to try the honey toast that is famous at the Hard Wok. Only funny thing was each staff asked  us if we needed forks, multiple times.

For those not in the know, honey toast is a small loaf of bread that has been hollowed out and stuffed with cubed bread that has a light crust of caramelized sugar. You can top your honey toast with all sorts of sweet goodies like ice cream and cookie crumbles. Honey toast is super popular in Japan, but you can find this awesome dessert all over East Asia.

I got the caramel ice cream honey toast ($13.95) and it was amazing! It came with vanilla bean ice cream, caramel drizzle, fresh blueberries/strawberries, and frosting. The toast is huge and is definitely enough to feed two people. Totally the definition of diabetes, but worth it! Order this god of a toast at the beginning of the meal, as it takes 30 minutes to make.

Happy eating!"

We ordered:

Transparent Flour Dumpling with Pork Filling. Soooo good! There are so many different textures and flavors here: the gluttonous, chewy dumpling; the savory, tender pork; the crisp, refreshing bamboo shoots...everything came together for a scrumptious experience.

Pork Sausage wrapped in Sticky Rice Sausage. The sausage was really tasty, but a bit simple and one-dimensional. I enjoyed it as a shared side dish but would probably get bored with it if I had the whole thing to myself. 

Beef Noodle Soup. The broth was a little too heavily spiced for me. The beef was tender and delicious!

Spiced Meat Sauce over Rice. This was my favorite! The pork is so fatty and tender and flavorful, and the juices make the rice taste amazing too. The pickled radish added a perfect pop of sweet tartness to the dish. Just wonderful.

We only sampled a tiny fraction of their large and varied menu. I&#39;m looking forward to coming back and trying a bunch of other dishes!"

I always come here weekend afternoons and no matter when I come, it is always so packed. It is a cafe so there is limited seating. Larger parties usually have to wait for a while before they are seated. 

I&#39;ve ordered the popcorn chicken, the oyster pancake, the sticky rice, the cold noodles, and the Tainan noodles, zhajiang noodles, the sticky rice sausage, the fried pork chop, basically almost everything on the menu. Really love everything except the cold noodles. The sauce wasn&#39;t what I expected and a little too sweet. There was also very little veggies that came with it so I had a lot of noodles leftover. Everything else was very authentic. The oyster pancake was one of the best we&#39;ve had in Seattle so far. 

Also the brick toast is as delicious as it looks. I come here too often.

The wait was pretty lengthy- around 30 minutes, but it&#39;s totally worth it. They make everything fresh and everything tastes so good. Huge portions and perfect proportions of ice cream/toppings/toast. The ice cream is thick and creamy, which contrasts well with the sugared and crunchy toast.

Gotta rep my homeland and who doesn&#39;t love Taiwanese food? It definitely is hard to find some decent Taiwanese eateries in Seattle. 

We got the honeydew slush and a papaya slush. The honeydew was not bad, it had a strong honeydew flavor but didn&#39;t taste like one of those honeydew melon pops. More like a honeydew candy. It&#39;s hard to explain. 3/5
The Papaya slush was creamy and had a nice papaya flavor. 4/5 however, both were more on the sweet side so next time I&#39;ll ask if they can do 75 level sweetness.

The oyster pancake was not very good. It looked really dried and very fried around the corners. Oyster pancake is supposed to be kinda slimy and sticky but also nicely fried where it isn&#39;t all dried up. They put crown daisy leaves instead of little Napa and their oysters weren&#39;t fresh. Super fishy! :/ and the worst part was their sauce. It was excessively salty and a bit spicy. Never had a sauce salty, it&#39;s usually a little sweet and can be spicy. This was definitely disappointing. 

This place was alright, I&#39;ll probably be back to try their popcorn chicken and brick toast. They have some other authentic Taiwanese dishes like ba-wan and the little upside down glutinous rice dish that I would like to try but after that oyster pancake...hmm I&#39;m not sure."

Saw the island of Taiwan and BAM, in we go!

The menu is extensive - I wish we had more than 30 minutes so that we could really order things from every category and try it all out. This place reminds me of the cute little Taiwanese eateries in SoCal, some even in Taiwan. It&#39;s a small space but there was never anyone waiting, they make good use of the space and the staff members are all very friendly.

With our limited time, we only ordered two noodle dishes:

- Tainan Specialty Noodle Soup: The noodles are the type of noodle you can buy dry @ the store and that my dad used to use when making us our usual Saturday noodle soup lunch with everything in the fridge at home. The broth was clear and mild, I wouldn&#39;t say this was especially tasty but my friend really liked it!

- Pork and Fish Paste Noodle Soup: I don&#39;t think this is what it&#39;s called but I can&#39;t find the menu online. In Chinese it&#39;s called ro gen dong fen (the last two being the type of clear noodle). This was good - it was in a thick, savory broth with a dash of vinegar. The noodles were very soft, so much so that when you picked it up it would fall apart but it did a great job absorbing the soup. The pork wrapped in fish paste was a little less great, there was too much fish paste and too little pork, and it could&#39;ve used with more flavor - white pepper or something. Other than that, it hit the spot, kept me warm, but didn&#39;t feel completely authentic other than offering that noodle dish which isn&#39;t a usual on most Taiwanese menus.

I guess this place is known for their desserts and boba though, so don&#39;t miss out on that!"

Food does not seem to be typical Chinese food so if you want a different spin on Asian food this is a good place to try. Tons of great beverages as well! Their servers are also nice and sweet. Wish the place is a bit bigger though.

The menu is vast and full of interesting items for those who aren&#39;t accustomed to authentic Taiwanese cuisine, so take the time to read through it all if you want to try something different. They have plenty of traditional Szechuan dishes for those who like their food with a spicy kick. For those who are slightly less adventurous the menu has plenty of more familiar options to choose from as well, so there should be something to suit all tastes.

Ordered the ba-wan (translucent dumpling filled with peppery pork, bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, and covered with a slightly sweet and savory sauce), sticky rice/sausage, gua-bao (pork belly bun), and chilled duck feet.

The ba-wan was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Dumpling was cooked to perfection.  The filling had a lot of flavors going on, which made it unique to other ba-wans I&#39;ve had in the past.  The sauce was fairly light, making a great contrast to the flavor-packed filling.  Sticky rice/sausage was decent.  The sticky rice was cooked well, however, the sausage was a bit salty for my liking.  Gua-bao was alright.  There was too much fatty meat for my liking, but the flavor was solid.  Also, I think they added a lot of peanut powder, making it on the sweeter side.  I highly recommend the duck feet; it had great spice was very refreshing."

The tables are really close to each other, and the ambiance is very loud with competing voices. The honey toast is extremely popular, but it takes a while to make and it sells out really quickly because they order their toast from elsewhere and only prepare with an X amount every day.

After walking in, my friend and I just stood there for a bit. No one greeted us or told us where to sit. Finally my friend said, &#34;Excuse me, can we have a seat for 2?&#34; and we were shown where to sit. After sitting and given menus, we weren&#39;t checked on again until we waved someone over our way. So as you can guess by now, the service here seems to be non-existent for the most part.

We ordered popcorn chicken, two drinks, and the strawberry toast cake. They let us know that the cake would probably take 20-30 minutes, which I knew beforehand just from the Yelp reviews. After we got the popcorn chicken, she quickly walked away. We had to wave down another girl who gave us the &#34;one moment&#34; finger, but never came over in one moment. Then my friend had to go to the front counter and ask for a sauce for the popcorn chicken. We asked for ranch, which they didn&#39;t have, but told us there was a sweet and sour sauce and then ketchup, so we said we&#39;d take ketchup. Again, ANOTHER longgggg wait and still no one came with our ketchup like they said. Eventually a new lady came to our table to drop off the cake and we then asked, &#34;Excuse me, can we get some ketchup&#34; to which she replied, &#34;Sorry, but we don&#39;t have any ketchup here.&#34; .............WTF?

The cake was decent, but nothing I would go back for. A lot of the toast pieces were so hard that I wasn&#39;t able to eat them. The popcorn chicken wasn&#39;t good at all, which is why we needed some sort of sauce to mask the real taste.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve made it clear that I have no interest coming back here. It just wasn&#39;t any good and the service absolutely sucks."

I came here finally and got to try their honey toast. The most popular choice is a strawberry custard honey toast. It takes about 30 minutes to prepare but I was completely fine with that since I was with a group. We ordered three types of shaved ice. It was more like the snow cone shaved ice which made me feel kind of sad but the toppings were good. We got taro balls, boba, black grass jelly and it came with a light syrup. 

When my honey toast came out, it was beautiful! I was squealing with joy. So the box is made out of Taiwanese toast which is a bit softer and lighter than the typical American white bread. The inside of the box had crustless Taiwanese toast pieces that were crunchy and we&#39;re covered in butter and sugar. It was topped with a scoop of strawberry ice cream, a flat circle of chocolate and two strawberry Pocky sticks. So much goodness! And yes I had to eat it with my group who demolished about 75% of it and I was in a group of four. It is definitely a dessert you need to share!

They give away stamp cards for bubble tea. It says after purchasing 8 cups of bubble tea you get one cup original bubble milk tea for free.
Tonight, after eating my dinner here, I decided to redeem my free bubble tea. I told the waitress, and the waitress agreed to make it free for me. However, when I got the check, they charged me for the tea, so I reminded the waitress again. She said she forgot so she asked me to use next time. So I said, &#34;Fine, how about I order one more original bubble milk tea for free?&#34; She said, &#34;No, you will have to pay for tapioca.&#34; I then pointed at the stamp card and said to her, &#34;it did clearly say that one bubble (means with tapioca) for free.&#34; She said she had to ask her boss. Then she came back and told me that it&#39;s free but I would have to pay for its tax. What?! I don&#39;t mind paying tax, but if you give away something for free but want to charge for tax, shouldn&#39;t you clarify in writing on the stamp cards? How much tax could it cost for a cup of bubble tea?I tried to talk to the girl who did the check, and she just talked to me impatiently, &#34;You can talk to the owner. I have no control over it.&#34;

We must&#39;ve beaten the crowd because we were immediately greeted by friendly faces and seated without a wait (had we arrived 20min later, we would&#39;ve been in the line that formed outside). Service was prompt and we were offered water while we decide what we wanted to try.

I ordered their Beef Noodle Soup which I really enjoyed. The beef itself is really tender and flavorful and the soup is mildly spicy and a little fatty. The noodles tasted fresh and did not clump together and the portion of the dish was enough to be shared between 2-3 people. I would definitely order this again - I just wish they have a smaller one.

Our table also ordered their Popcorn Chicken which I think is pretty good and better than a lot of &#34;popcorn chicken&#34; that I&#39;ve had in Seattle. It had the right amount of seasoning and the rice bowl that came with it was also appetizing with its own pork topping.

The Braised Pork Knuckle was good but that&#39;s just it. Not much meat, mainly skin and fat. My friend didn&#39;t finish it.

And the moment of truth, the dessert.

We opted for their Chocolate Sensation Honey  [brick] Toast. I may be biased because I really like chocolate, but I found it to be really good and I am salivating thinking of it. I would recommend sharing it between 3-4 people because of the size and amount of sugar.

Overall, I am giving it a 5-star for the friendly and prompt service, good portion sizes, tasteful dishes, and the masterpiece of a dessert."

The Strawberry Honey Custard Toast is just insanity on a plate...there is no describing it...just look at the picture and you&#39;ll know what I mean."

I was excited to try some authentic dishes, and she was knowledgeable enough to order just the right items. It is a fast pace cafe style dining, but it&#39;s clean and pleasant. 
The red plum juice was sweet and salty, a very fun combination. I loved the spicy duck feet, which come de-boned, so it&#39;s easy to eat it. Very crunchy! 
The pork &#34;burger&#34; was very flavorful, but I couldn&#39;t handle all the pork fat part. The popular ouster pancake is only for oyster lovers! Very oyster-y, I must say, but I love it! 
Definitely give this place a try if you&#39;re into authentic dishes and love trying unique foods. You&#39;ll find a great selection to choose from to excite your taste buds!"

The prices are a bit on the high end though, but eh, if I only go every once in awhile, I can afford it (;

As for the service, it was decent. The cafe seemed pretty clean as far as I can tell too. But yeah, parking&#39;s a huge hassle so I def recommend parking on the street along the free 2-hr parking spots and then walk over."

Ordered a variety of entrees and wasn&#39;t impressed with any. They were all ok and was good I guess but nothing I would return for. The zha jian noodles were nothing like zha jian (jajangmyeon) I&#39;ve ever seen. Thick rice noodles with a brown meat and tofu sauce with some sort of bean; it was ok not what I was expecting. BUT their xiao long bao soup dumplings were amazing, way better than din tai fung. They took a while to come out so they gave them to us on the house which was very nice and a plus for me! I didn&#39;t mind them coming out a little late but it showed that they cared which I liked. 

We also got the strawberry custard honey toast which was delicious! Thick bread drenched in sugar and custard with strawberry ice cream and fruit. Amazing, but you need quite a few people to finish it! 

Overall I would say come for the dessert and dumplings but the noodle entrees can be skipped. Will return for xiao long bao and more honey toast!"

The parking garage is free although semi eerie.... the wait time was non-existent ( Sunday night, party of 2). Nice ambiance not divey or overly stuck up. Just comfortable &amp; fast, friendly service. Now the food...in order of yumminess: oyster pancakes ( first time having it so now I have to hunt for more elsewhere to compare, seemed light on oyster though), won-ton noodle soup was good (none will ever compare to sea garden&#39;s though, according to my mom) and the passion fruit green tea was just as good as Gossips. All of that for 20 bucks, not bad!!
 Only real downside is our server didn&#39;t tell us that they stop making the custard toast dessert after 9! Which was kind of the point of us going!! So now I have to go again very soon..."

Brick toast is similar to the honey toast, but smaller in portion btw.

Sadly, HardWok severely disappointed. We tried the vanilla hazelnut brick toast with vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was delicious...the brick toast was bland, not crispy on the outside, and just tasted like a lighter pound cake. 

Since we were also really hungry, we decided to order some food as well. We ordered the sticky rice with pork, popcorn chicken, spiced pork bowl, and a noodle dish with broth on the side. Overall, I was not impressed with any of the dishes. They are just....OK. Also the portions were SMALL relative to the prices. I was still a little hungry by the end.

I&#39;m definitely not coming back here to eat any of their food, maybe I&#39;ll try their other desserts next time."

We got the braised beef noodle, xiao long bao(steamed soup bum), and pork burger. Everything is decent. The xiao long bao and pork burger (pork bum) are actually better than a lot of places in this country including seattle which claim to specialize in these items (like pings dumplings). I would say they are at the average level of street food you can get in mainland China. 

Excellent service too. It is run by a bunch of kids, who may or may not appear to be professional. But don&#39;t get fooled by that. They sat us promptly, took the order in time, informed us any item that needs extended time to prepare, filled the water and took the empty plate without you waving them down (which can be typical in ethnic places). The nicest thing was this one girl who offered us to go cup and ice when we grabbed a soda drink on the way out. 

We definitely come back to try out their toast!"

Hot honey toast with cold ice cream and fruit toppings.    Pretty simple.  But it&#39;s interestingly different that&#39;s what made it so cool.   I enjoyed it and would come again.    You do have to be super patient though.   It takes about 20 to 30 minutes for them to make the honey toast dish.   They do large variety of teas and drinks.    I got the special fruit hot tea and the iced green tea lychee with bobba and jelly.   They do use fresh fruits.   Full of natural sweet flavor.   I loved it. They also serve food there as well.  I didn&#39;t try any because my mind was on desserts.  But i don&#39;t feel that the food would have been good.   The menu was not get impressive in that category.   I feel that is more of a dessert place.    Oh!  I forgot to mention they also serve shaved ice which looks really interesting too.   If i have the opportunity to go back i will try that.     Service was ok.   I think it&#39;s may because they&#39;re so busy.    There&#39;s a sign in sheet at the counter that you&#39;d have to sign to wait for a table.

I think their desserts are much better than their savory options.  I have tried their sticky rice, garlic pork, spicy mala tang, pork cutlet, braised pork knuckle, cold appetizer plate, and popcorn chicken.  I like the sticky rice, mala tang, and garlic pork.  The popcorn chicken is perfectly cooked and not dry like popcorn chicken usually is.  The pork knuckle is good but too difficult to eat.  The pork cutlet needs seasoning.

For dessert, I&#39;ve had honey toast, thick toast, grass jelly, and green tea jello.  I am OBSESSED with their grass jelly dessert!  It is a big bowl of grass jelly with syrup and your choice of three toppings.  I like taro, red bean, lotus bean, green bean, and yam.  Their honey toast is delicious -- topped with lots of ice cream and the toast is so perfectly sweet and crunchy.  It does take 30 minutes for it to come out.  If you think the thick toast is just a smaller version, you&#39;re wrong. :( 

The only downside of this place is that it closes way too early!"

The shaved ice was alright, definitely not the best I&#39;ve had, but for Seattle it&#39;s pretty rare to find shaved ice. Food was good, service was great. Good selection and the prices aren&#39;t too expensive either. 

I guess, Taiwanese food is not really my favourite food in the world, but HardWok still managed to please.

We came a bit before the normal dinner time, but as we left there were people outside waiting, but I can definitely see why it has such a huge following!"

I haven&#39;t had any of their other foods there but I have had their dessert.  The shaved ice isn&#39;t really anything to rave about but the fruit toppings on there are on point.  fresh cut strawberries and mangoes drizzled with honey and condensed milk is a diabetics nightmare but i sweet tooth&#39;s dream.  The shaved ice itself is pretty standard but I prefer the ice chips that almost taste like fresh winter snow.

the other dessert (i can&#39;t recall the name) is the little honey baked bread box with ice cream and fruit topping.  It&#39;s legit.  The bread box is like eating pieces of perfect creme burlee french toast.  Just the right amount of sweetness and just the right amount of crunch to get you to savor every bite.  

The biggest down side is the parking and the size of this place.  It&#39;s tiny.  The top floor of parking can maybe accommodate 12 cars - combined that with Asian&#39;s parking and you can fit 9 without dinging your doors and scraping your bumpers.  The downstairs garage is always packed as it shares it with employees, neighboring restaurants, and grocery stores.  But if you can luck out and get good parking, you&#39;ll most likely be forced to wait an hour to get a seat inside HardWok as their max capacity can&#39;t be more than 30 people.  Considering it takes 20 minutes to make the dessert (made to order) be prepared to wait.  But if you have a sweet tooth like me... it&#39;s worth it :)"

They have great food here! Their soups have deep flavor and the noodles are fair consistency. One thing I noticed was that I easily get tired of their noodley/meaty dishes. It&#39;s just very rich, and it&#39;s rich throughout the meal. Think of getting a light side dish to go with if it you&#39;re getting something meat/sauce/soup heavy. 

Their shrimp pancake is incredibly good. One of my favorite dishes there! Sounds and looks weird, but try it out!

I&#39;ve also had a sweet bun with condensed milk.. Not the biggest fan of that one. It was bland and almost dry to eat. The condensed milk saved it by a hair. Will never get again.

Their pork belly sandwich (is that what it&#39;s called? Don&#39;t remember) is very good but it&#39;s very small! I LOVE pork belly, and they used it well in a nice steam bun, some peanuts for some nutty deep good flavor, and bright greens to cut the saltiness. 

Their mini steam buns are so good! Very juicy, great chew and texture. The vinegar they give you pairs incredibly well with the meat inside.. Use it! One of my favorites here.

I have to say the desserts here are probably my favorite parts of eating here... Honey toast is always a fun treat to have (I love the hot/cold), and their shaved ice is very good, too. Fresh strawberries and mangoes covering shaved ice. The bottom of the ice had tapioca syrup and the top of the fruit was covered with condensed milk. :) 

Also note, honey toast take a while to make so order it right away! I&#39;ve heard they sometimes run out of the toast.. So try to come in early or call to ask if they have it beforehand. Be prepared to wait 30+ minutes for it! In the meantime, try a couple of their dishes!"

As for the milk tea, I was disappointed after getting it a couple more times. It seemed inconsistent. The boba today was tasteless and not chewy at all. I guess it&#39;s a hit or miss at this place.

Just FYI: this place is CLOSED on MONDAYs.  I wanted to come here once on a Monday with a friend after we had gotten pho next door---we were extremely disappointed to say the least.

They have a VERY LARGE bubble tea menu here, and the quality of the drinks is probably better than most places in the ID/Chinatown area.  My favorites are the QQ boba, honeydew green milk tea, and the typical taro milk tea.  

If you want dessert, the honey toasts are awesome!  Get the strawberry honey toast if you have a friend that wants to share it and make sure both of you are hungry.  Last time I got it and shared it with a friend (added an extra scoop of matcha ice cream), I think my fat kid status just went up a few notches.  Oops.  The strawberry honey toast is twice as large as the other ones, so if you are not too hungry, try the banana nut one or the one with chocolate.  For the toasts, the restaurant uses the thick ass toast that is common in Asia so it&#39;s very filling.

The other foods here are pretty good.  My favorites are the Taiwanese pork burger, ba wan, oyster omelette, and ma la tang.  There are other Taiwanese places in Washington that have better quality food, but if you want a place that has all of that and a huge boba and dessert menu, then this is the place!

HardWok Cafe is located in the Little Saigon area of the ID (I call it the one Taiwanese place amongst all the Vietnamese ones lol), and there is free parking in the lower floor of the plaza.  Free and available parking in the Seattle area = always a plus.

Staff here are young and the waitresses are cute.  I guess being cute is a prerequisite to working here haha :)"

They have 2 menus- 1 for cold desserts, and 1 for hot foods/desserts.

We got shaved ice with split mango and strawberry. 
I really wish the ice was shaven MUCH finer so that it&#39;d melt in my mouth instead of me having to crunch the chunky ice. That kind of ruined it for me. The fruit was ripe and sweet though."

Go to orders are the gua bao, beef noodle soup, xiao long bao and pork chop with rice. The gua bao is soft with the slight sweet peanut and sour pickled veg. Beef noodle soup is very slightly spicy. Pork chop is juicy and crispy. Xiao long bao are really good, but the skins are broken sometimes, or break when you pick them up. Boo. 

Honey toast is huge! After a full meal it&#39;s hard to share between 2 people. You can also opt for a brick toast!

Service is fast. Groups are a little hard to bring. It&#39;s a smaller space and if you need to pay separately, they only allow up to 2 cards per check."

HardWok is a great place to get those classic dishes you order at some hole-in-the-wall in the alley or at the night market in Taiwan. Love basically all the menu items--my personal favorite being the popcorn chicken (lots of basil and seasoned correctly) and pork belly with garlic and chili sauce. Also, the honey toast is crazy!!! As for drinks, beside the classic black milk tea with tapioca, my second favorite drink is chocolate milk tea with egg pudding. The extensive bubble tea menu really allows you to get whatever your heart desires.

This place is incredibly popular and busy, and also small, so plan accordingly and don&#39;t count on it being a quick meal. Other than that, love love love the authentic food and bubble tea!!!"

Once you figure out how to get into the parking garage below the Ding How complex, you&#39;re pretty much set. And once below, getting out of the garage can be an interesting situation (once, 2 other cars and I got trapped because the exit door was locked/closed so we had to make our way up the entrance to get out.)

HardWok is always full of fresh-faced folks, which contributes to its hip vibe. If you can get a booth to sit in, get one. 

We started off with my old favorite, tofu with thousand year old eggs. The tofu is firmer here (I prefer Facing East&#39;s version) and overall, it didn&#39;t disappoint with its gelatinous egg, creamy tofu texture, salty sauce, green onions and bonito flakes. 

Next came the popcorn chicken with basil (the basil wasn&#39;t deep-fried to crispness which I prefer, but the chicken was still fantastic.) The serving was perfect.

My friend had the fried pork chop and he was surprised by how large the serving was. Served with a braised egg and some pickled veg, he didn&#39;t finish it. Though I didn&#39;t have the ground pork with rice, he happily cleaned up his little bowl.

I was stoked when my friend didn&#39;t like the shrimp pancake. More for ME! Like a flat, gelatinous, chewy crepe, it had an egg cooked in its center. The sweet sauce, though peculiar in color, was a good complement. 

Because of the lack of vegetables on the menu, I asked if they would make me a side of vegetables and they offered steamed bok choy to us. THANKS! It was needed after all the fried and the carbs.

And Lactaid be damned, I ordered the Strawberry Custard Honey Toast. Served with an enormous amount of strawberry ice cream that melted into the little toast squares inside it&#39;s toasty treasure box, it was everything I hoped it would be. They were generous with the strawberries (although we wished that they de-stemmed most of the strawberries, and left only a couple stems for color). I wanted to mash the strawberries into the toast depths, but they required a little trimming first.) 

They have interesting drinks in the cold case (Peach vinegar, anyone?) and have other sweet desserts like chiffon cake, but really, why would you have chiffon cake if you can have one of the honey toasts?"

food: strawberry honey toast. it looks amazing, but lacking. if you have never tried it before, it&#39;s definitely worth it. it&#39;s instagram worthy. nuff said. however, i probably wouldnt order another one in the near future for the sake of eating. im sure the people i drag there next time will want to order one. they have many other taiwanese style foods that look amazing. definitely want to go back to try everything else besides the obvious. ***3/5

The popcorn chicken is really good! 

The bubble tea is ok. I find it a little expensive, especially compared to my favorite place, Ambrosia, which is a good $1.50 less for the same size bubble tea. I had the Lavender milk tea here and thought it wasn&#39;t that great.

They charge a fee for using a credit card on less than a $5 purchase. That always leaves kind of a sour taste in my mouth, especially at a cafe where most purchases are probably going to be under or around $5. 

I stop in every now and then but even though I&#39;m right around the corner it&#39;s not really in my rotation."

The toast was great with a mix of condensed milk and various toppings you&#39;d like to add on. It was light and fluffy.

However, don&#39;t waste money on their sesame milk tea. If it&#39;s not your forte to make such a drink, take it off the menu. It was essentially watered down sweet milk and green tea with instant sesame packaged additives. I&#39;d like to try other flavors but not for $4."

Besides having to wait a bit (which wasn&#39;t too bad since we were still waiting for someone to join us) everything else was really good. The servers were really nice and got our orders promptly. Of course we had to order bubble tea and my honey green milk tea with pudding was amazing. 

The food came out quickly and of course we over ordered, but left overs are always nice to bring home. I&#39;d have to say I really loved the pork knuckle/hog dish with noodles in soup. The texture of the pork knuckles were just right, not too soft, but not too chewy. Pretty everything we ordered was really good, except the xiaolongbao (those dumplings with soup inside) wasn&#39;t as good as I hoped it would be.

Of course, we couldn&#39;t come here without having to try the every so popular honey toast! Since it takes 30 minutes or so to prepare, we ordered it ahead of time when we ordered the rest of our food. We had the strawberry custard one (more like strawberry ice cream) and it was so drool-worthy.

This place is good for getting drinks to-go, especially if you don&#39;t&#39; have time to wait and sit to eat since the place is a little bit small. Overall, I highly recommend it and will definitely be going back!

I understand that it is a small restaurant, and the food is delicious, which leads to a LOT of people going there, is a great thing. But isn&#39;t that a hint to EXPAND??? Make the restaurant bigger and able to accommodate more people? 

I am in love with their spiced meat bowls. It is perfect in every way. And I love when there is a perfect amount of meat with every spoon of rice. Is the perfect harmony. When you are done with the bowl, you will not have too much rice left over or too much meat left over. The balance is perfect.

But that wait though.... I have to bring that issue back because of a recent visit. I called ahead of time and was told that their &#34;last call&#34; time was 8:45, while they are schedule to close at 9:00pm. I completely understand that. My party got there at 8:00 pm and there were 2 other groups of people waiting. Because is hard for them to accomodate more than 2 people, they turned us away after I mentioned that I had 5 adults and 2 babies. They said the wait will exceed the 8:45 mark and therefore is better to just not wait. It was extremely disappointing because my friends were all looking forward to this and &#34;thought&#34; we had got there at a good time, but guess not. 

Another problem that caused delays is the time of making the honey toast. Honey toast is one of the most popular thing to order here. If you search hashtag hardwokcafe, you will get mostly pictures of honey toast. It takes them on average 20+ minutes to make. So each party of people will sit in their tables for a long time. That will lead to other people waiting longer. The owner really need to figure out another way so that they are not losing that much business everyday by not being able to accomodate."

Food: I&#39;ve only eaten here once and that&#39;s because food wise it&#39;s only a 3 star. Beef noodle soup, taiwanese pork burgers, etc. They were all just ok. I wouldn&#39;t come here just for food, but if you&#39;re here and hungy, it&#39;s not bad. There&#39;s a lot of items on the menu, so maybe there&#39;s just something good I haven&#39;t tried. I don&#39;t really want to pay more  visits to find out. 

Drinks: 4-4.5 star for bbt here! I really like the Jasmine milk tea. Not really sure what wintermelon really is, but the wintermelon milk tea is good as well! Lemon black tea, not so good. Super sweet. Don&#39;t forget a punchcard, buy 8, get 1 free. 

Desserts: I wanted to try the box toast here, but they aren&#39;t opened too late and it&#39;s always so busy. When I finally got a table, they sold out at 9pm on a Saturday. Sadface. Not ever going to try again. Too much work. I&#39;ve had it one other time in SoCal and it wasn&#39;t very good (although it looked amazing) so I just thought I&#39;d see if this was any different. We did end up getting the THICK TOAST (vanilla and hazelnut) w/ a scoop of red bean ice cream instead. My friend that has had the box toast before said it&#39;s pretty much the same thing except a smaller version of the box toast and we didn&#39;t have fruits on ours. It taste alright. Imagine just a really thick piece of toast that they put in the oven, put some nutella over it, whipped cream, ice cream. Yah. 3 star.

Other: The place isn&#39;t huge and it&#39;s always so busy :/ 2 star for being annoying like that especially when they don&#39;t have anything really worth it besides bbt. Get the bbt to go if you&#39;re in the area. WAY better than Oasis (which I do not love and try to stay away from)."

I recommend figuring out what Honey Toast you want when you&#39;re first ordering because it takes about 30 minutes to make (or so I&#39;ve been told). 
HardWok Cafe is found on the corner of 12th Ave and S. Jackson St. in Ding How Center. Parking can be found at the Center with additional parking found underground (which may be a little tight) with a 2 hour time limit if I remember correctly.
The place itself is on the smaller side probably seating around 25 people and depending on when you arrive there may be a wait. 
I just have to say that this place is a little too ugh International sometimes as most of the staff and other customers seem to be F.O.B. Sometimes I just don&#39;t feel Asian enough at this place haha. But the staff is friendly and speaks English and can help you out.   
I enjoy the cylinder sticky rice, savory pork chops, or their popcorn chicken, but actually anything on their menu is a good choice. The Honey Toast is very filling and you probably need about 2+ people to tackle it, so I try to leave a lot of room for all the delicious carbs and sugars! 
There is a restroom located inside the restaurant and you simply grab the key attached to a large utensil at the register and remember to bring it back!

Portions are relatively generous and the food has good flavor and taste very simple and clean.

I got the Mild spicy beef noodle soup and I was extremely satisfied.

My girlfriend and I grabbed some breakfast here and our server was incredibly friendly, had some fun stories and really made the place feel like a small-town cafe. We told her we were on our way to adopt our first dog together and before we left, she gave us a little homemade dog treat and said &#34;now you&#39;ll HAVE to take him home!&#34;.

I had the biscuit sandwich with bacon (homemade biscuits, amazing!) and my girlfriend had the French toast. 10/10, would eat here again.

Sherman thanks you for the doggy treat!

There was a bit of a line, but we were seated with a minimal wait. Service was hit &amp; miss, but I blame that on the couple that insinuated themselves at our table, despite there being a &#34;common table&#34; that people can sit at together. Yes, we could&#39;ve/should&#39;ve given them the boot, but we were in a good mood despite their pompous behavior. 

Friend and I both had the home fries with bacon and eggs, which comes with salsa, cheese, sour cream and avocado, and split a biscuit between us. Talk about a winner;  the plate came out piping hot, with the potatoes, bacon and eggs cooked perfectly. This was a fantastic stick to your ribs brekkie. The biscuit was HUGE and fluffy, I&#39;m glad we decided to share one.

I would definitely come back, though I&#39;d probably bring more folks to avoid running into the situation we had with those pompous folks."

Try the daily special. It&#39;s always yummy!

Both Ways...

...to have your eggs?
...looking to cross the street?

I could go on but I think that this would get inappropriate pretty quick.

This has now become my &#34;date brunch&#34; with Mr. L. He tried it for the first time this week and was happy with how much flavor is crammed into their breakfast potatoes! 

The menu is small (like the restaurant) but simple. Alert: they&#39;re friendly, I repeat, friendly to substitutions. Grits are a great example (two brown sugars and one pat of BUTTAH.)

No bennies here waaaah but the salmon scramble has become my go-to.

On the last day I was in, the owner came by and gave us the name of the person that they would [soon] be singing Happy Birthday to. You can imagine his shock when we all sang in unison: &#34;...Happy Biiiirrrthdaaaay, dear MIIIIKKKEE...&#34;

Both Ways Cafe is away from the bustle of Columbia City on Rainier Ave, and it just added to the lovely lazy Sunday morning I was already having.

The food is straight-foward and delicious, and they bake their own breads and biscuits! I ordered the two egg breakfast with a homemade biscuit and crispy applewood bacon.  The food was hearty and the portion sizes were very generous.  One word: Yum! 

The waitress was also very nice and friendly (just what you want from any meal out). I&#39;ll definitely come back and try some of their other items, like a scramble or their biscuits and gravy."

The reviews and easy parking made this an easy choice. The coffee cake and coffee we&#39;re good starters.

My ham and cheese sandwich was crispy cooked and dripping with cheese so that was a plus.

Her biscuits and gravy were a bit overwhelming and needed a bit of spice or flavoring in the biscuits. The gravey tasted like normal pork gravey so it needs some fresh pizzas to set it apart.

We asked for water and the server lady brought us one more glass vs filling our glasses and then I stacked our cups in a polite attempt to ask for more.

The bill came and we paid but they could put a touch of polish and easily earn 5 stars as they are friendly and have a great feel here.

I was only going to give 3 stars but they seemed overwhelmed so I will upgrade them to 4... with a caveat."

After driving home from eastern Washington on the 4th of July, we wanted to eat brunch.  After finding our favorite spots closed for the day, we went to Both Ways Cafe.  They were very busy, but it only took us about 10 minutes to get a table.

I have driven by this cafe many times in the past.  I had assumed it was primarily a coffee and muffin place so I was pleasantly surprised to see the menu had a full line of breakfast items.  I went with the basics - two eggs over easy, sausage links, breakfast potatoes and whole wheat toast.  What could go wrong?

The food arrived after a long wait (their kitchen could not keep up with the crowd) and it looked great.  The problem was that it did not taste as good as it looked.  The eggs were a little over cooked, there were only two sausage links that really did not have much flavor, the breakfast potatoes were also lacking flavor.  The toast was something else.  One piece of bread, thick cut and toasted to the consistency of melba toast.  it tasted ok, just way too crunchy.  Not sure if it was supposed to be like this, but not the way I like my toast.

Bottem line - IWCA - it was certainly adequate."

The bread has a hint of molasses flavor, the crumb is tender and the crust slightly chewy. The tuna has just the right amount of mayo, bits of dill and other herbs, chopped red onion. Year round, Both Ways always manages to conjure up perfectly fresh, crisp green lettuce and a thick juicy slice of tomato. My favorite for breakfast and lunch. Thank you Both Ways!!"

When you think of &#34;fries&#34; you literally think fries, but they&#39;re just potaoes on the bottom of the eggs, with pico de gallo, which tasted super fresh! i really liked it, and it&#39;s really filling. I would love to come here again!

It&#39;s all prepped in-house. I&#39;ve never had bad service. Slow service, sure -- it gets crowded on weekends -- but never bad. The negative reviews might be due to the attitude of the crew -- when it gets super busy, they go the same pace as if it was slow, but they are unfailingly friendly and polite. My secret is that I go when they open. For food I&#39;d recommend anything baked. I usually get whatever the breakfast special is, with a biscuit. This place absolutely kills it on the biscuits. They&#39;re best eaten as dessert after breakfast. Mound one up with homemade berry jam, top up your cuppa joe, and enjoy, and all will be right with your world."

You can find street parking close by pretty easily.

Or you can gamble on the weather and eat at one of the several picnic tables outside which would better suit a large group.  

We ordered the daily special which was a Canadian bacon, mushroom and leek scramble and a spinach havarti scramble both with home fries and a biscuit.  The service is a little spotty.  While they seated us right away and took our order quickly considering we told them we needed more time, the first cups of coffee stayed half full or less for a while.  Then they noticed us and we couldn&#39;t keep the cup below full.  Longer wait then typical for your entree, too.  Very tasty eggs, but the home fries were just so so and the biscuit was too sweet for my taste (you&#39;ll be disappointed if you&#39;ve tasted one from Morsel in the U-District).

It&#39;s a seat yourself type of place and super laid back with limited but eclectic seating options. The servers were very attentive as I waited for my friend to arrive and didn&#39;t rush us to order. 

Our waitress was very knowledgable about the menu and was able to answer our many questions (we both have weird diet preferences) without appearing irritated. She even recommended the fresh fruit as a side instead of the bread options, and they didn&#39;t charge us extra for it. I had the Spanish tortilla omelet which doesn&#39;t actually have a tortilla, the egg is the tortilla, and has cheese, potatoes and pico on the side. Only issue was that the menu said sour cream comes with it but I didn&#39;t get it and when I asked for it they charged me $.25 but didn&#39;t tell me it was going to be extra, although it should have been included, irritating but not a big deal. The food took a long time to come out but they were busy, I was in good company and the food was worth the wait so again, wasn&#39;t a big deal. I would have given 5 stars if not for those 2 things. 

Bottom line, go here, you won&#39;t be disappointed, good food, great service, and good for infants and kids. My friend is 8 months pregnant and the waitress made a point to tell her to come in after she has the baby to just eat and hang out because they won&#39;t kick her out and they have books and games for kids."

Frittata special with bacon, potatoes and some veggies. Delectable!
Salmon scramble was really delicious as well. I couldn&#39;t decide which entree I liked better so was glad my husband and I were able to share the two. 
We chose biscuits as our side and it was the right decision. With the butter and freezer jam it was awesome. 
Potatoes came with egg dishes and those were yummy as well. 

Glad we discovered this place. Will definitely come back!"

Order that for breakfast and then come back and thank me. I&#39;ll be waiting.

Other than that, I don&#39;t have much else to say. I was completely amazed at how wonderful my breakfast was though, so I will for sure be back. They have outside seating, which was pretty nice since it was a nice sunny morning. And surprisingly, we were checked on consistently while eating outside.

Heading out to breakfast this morning to Stone House... they were closed for the day. Glad they treat their people well on Labor Day.
But where to eat. I kept driving along that road till I got to Both Ways Cafe. I&#39;ve passed this place many times but never stopped there to eat. I didn&#39;t want to drive all the way into Seattle to find a place, so I parked the car and went there. The staff was cheery and helpful but the food was not up to par. 
I ordered a spinach and feta omelette which came with potatoes, toast and a little fruit garnish. I asked for a side of bacon with some decaf coffee. All that came to $20 with tip. 
The omelette was the best part but it had very little feta and barely some spinach. I ordered some salsa because all they had for hot sauce was tabasco. Note to all restaurants: Tabasco is crap! Find some of the other great hot sauces out there! 
The potatoes were dry, dry, dry... like they had been cooked yesterday and left out till this morning and barely heated up. 
The toast faired a little better but it was still dry. The bacon I ordered as a side dish was pitiful!!! 2.5 pieces of mostly crunchy fat. Not much meat on them at all and very dry. 
The fruit garnish was days old and very small. Tiny square of watermelon, orange and green melon and the tiniest grape ever.
The place was packed and I can&#39;t see the appeal, except that all the locals must be going there because they are too lazy to go to someplace good.
Ugh! A waste of money. My poor stomach."

I had the biscuit sandwich with veggie sausage and it was quite yummy.  The biscuits were flaky and solid (as in solid good, not solid as a rock), not doughy, which is a plus in my book, the egg perfectly cooked and it was drenched in cheese, which was also a good thing.  I love veggie sausage, so no complaints here.

My dining comrade ordered the biscuits and gravy.  I stuck my fork in the gravy and found it to be way.  Too.  Sausage-y.  I don&#39;t really like normal sausage anyway, but damn, this tasted like all sausage all the time.  Needless to say, my dining partner pushed the gravy around and ate mostly the biscuit portion of the dish.

That being said, I&#39;ll definitely come back if I&#39;m in the Seward Park area, as the breakfast biscuit sandwich I had was yummy!"

I&#39;ve gotten their different scrambles, which are good, and the home fries are excellent. 

But recently I got their breakfast burrito. I really think it is the best I&#39;ve ever had. In Arizona I&#39;ve had fresh made from scratch flour tortilla&#39;s on the Navajo Rez, and this one reminded me of that. And the home fries with eggs, cheese, spinach and chicken Apple sausage were in perfect proportion. It is quite pricey especially with the chicken sausage, but it makes for a nice way to treat yourself on the occasional Sunday. 

They make pretty good coffee, and have some nice baked goodies at the counter as well."

Bizarre is a good word to describe our brunch experience at Both Ways. Let me start from the beginning.

We walked in, and despite the couple servers walking around, no one acknowledged us or directed us to a table. So we headed to a corner table that was empty of dishes, but had not been wiped down. What appeared to be a father-son duo sat on a similar table next to us. After a few minutes, a server attempted to take their order. They had not yet received menus. She went to grab menus for them. We got her attention and asked for menus as well, but she left too quickly for us to ask her to get our table cleaned. She eventually did return with menus, asked what we wanted to drink, and promised to wipe down our table.

She delivered David&#39;s coffee and wiped down the table, but again left too quickly before he could ask for some cream. Also, she handed us glasses of water. Which were room temperature. In Seattle summer, that means warm. She returned again, and we ordered, and David asked for his cream. This was delivered a bit later, and for the next HALF HOUR, different servers came and went refilling his coffee. No updates on our order, no apologies that it was taking so long. The next table had ordered after us, but received their order before we did, which at that point we had begun to expect. The basic concept of a single server controlling a particular group of tables seemed to be pretty lost on these people.

I had my wallet and card out on the table since we were planning a trip and I was paying for a hotel on my phone. An older lady who was serving as well, asked if I was ready to pay. Excuse me? She then realized we HADN&#39;T EVEN RECEIVED OUR ORDER. As she walked away, a younger guy showed up with our food and we finally ate. My Northwest scramble was pretty good, and David&#39;s biscuit breakfast sandwich looked okay as well. The biscuits were flaky and tasty and there was a yummy apricot/orangey jam. There was a lot of oil used to make the omelette and home fries, though, which made me a bit nauseous. 

We finished eating fairly quickly. During our meal, I asked our original server for some ice, and she gave me a glass-full -- if they had ice to start with, why wasn&#39;t this automatically in our water?! Anyway, the next table over had got their bill and was walking out. I asked for the bill, and it was delivered to me by yet another young woman. That&#39;s 4 different people having served us by now. I put my card on the table immediately, but of course she had walked away by then.

About five to ten minutes later, still no one had taken my card. So we decided to just get up to the register and pay. Five times someone walked by without acknowledging us, asking what we wanted, or anything. A couple people looked like they were looking for something to do, but apparently we were momentarily invisible, I dunno. Anyway, our original server finally said she would be right with us, then walked away again. After another few minutes, the older lady took my card, ran it, and we finally left.

It boggles my mind that they are still in business. The basic concepts of running a restaurant seems completely lost on them. Here&#39;s a tip: acknowledge your customers, even if it&#39;s just to say, &#34;We&#39;ll be right with you.&#34; Have some basic organization so that servers aren&#39;t doing the same thing for a table one moment, and then completely ignoring it for a long time because they assume someone else has dealt with it. Apologize to your customers if you realize they have been waiting a long time. Actually realize and notice what is going on at your tables! 

I will never return, and I hope this review either helps the business figure out how to make things work, or prevent other unsuspecting Yelpers from falling into this weird, frustrating trap."

When we finally did order it took about fifteen minutes to get two French toast plates. 

And this is where it really goes downhill. I&#39;m no chef, but typically French toast is dipped in some kind of egg. The &#39;French toast&#39; here was nothing more than a grilled piece of white bread. There may have been some butter or something on it. It was horrible. 

We are on vacation here and between the service, food, and water I wouldn&#39;t come back here nor would I recommend anyone going here. I&#39;m sure Seattle has better breakfast places."

Original Post:
This used to be one of our favorite places to eat. I&#39;m not sure what has changed in the past month or two, but our experience today was abysmal. We waited an hour and a half for our food, and still nothing. The coffee was bad, the service was even worse. No apologies for the delay or even attempts to make it right. Two different waitresses promised to check on our order, and neither one ever returned with an update. What a shame. Will not return anytime soon if ever, and will be sure to let our friends know the same."

Honestly what I suspect is that the service here is young, or at least that was my experience.  While I was seated and acknowledged when I came in (eventually but they were busy), after my order was taken my server NEVER checked on me again.  I had to flag someone down every time I wanted something... a refill on hot water, cream for my tea, you name it.  I should add that by the time I was seated the rush I came in to was largely gone... they weren&#39;t that slammed that they couldn&#39;t find time to check on me.  More importantly my table was right by the counter... they literally had to walk past me every time they did anything.

As a former server it&#39;s very rare I don&#39;t leave a tip well over 20% especially when I&#39;m dining alone.  This time I pulled out a calculator to figure an exact 15% tip.  I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve ever done that before but honestly the service just wasn&#39;t worth more than that.

As for the food, my eggs were good and everything else was fine.  Nothing to complain about but nothing to go out of your way for either.

Train your servers better Both Ways and you&#39;ll receive much better ratings."

Walked up and went inside. 3 or 4 different employees passed right by us at least a dozen times, without acknowledging us. No greeting, not even a polite smile. We asked an employee if we&#39;re supposed to seat ourselves, and he gave us a vague answer along the lines of yes, but maybe not because there are other people waiting, I&#39;ll be back. We waited for him to come back. Never did. Meanwhile, an employee pushed passed me with some chairs, without so much as an excuse me... it was more like move or get hit. 

After waiting for the employee who said he&#39;d be right back for about 5 minutes (we&#39;ve been there for about 12 minutes now), we sat ourselves at a table for 4. Again, plenty of employees squeezing by without acknowledging us. Aforementioned guy brings us silverware, leaves, wipes down our table, asks us if we want drinks, then leaves. We look at the menu for about 10 minutes (we&#39;ve already decided within 2) then he comes back to take our order. He says they&#39;ve been super busy and their kitchen was super behind and hopes it isn&#39;t still. 

We order iced tea, arnold palmer, biscuit sandwich and two eggs meal. He comes back about 7 minutes later with the drinks and says he was still brewing iced tea so it&#39;s probably weak. It is. He comes back about 20 minutes later to refill our beverages, the tea is actually properly steeped now, so he refills the iced tea, and instead of making another arnold palmer, just pours iced tea into it.

Our food comes and looks pretty good. Small, random amount of fruit on the plate with my eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes. Eggs were ordered over medium, and are very over easy which is a surefire sign a breakfast place doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. Bacon is average. Potatoes are really very roasted, they look fried, and they&#39;re below average. The toast, which is made in house says the menu, is very dry. Like cut the roof of your mouth dry. The biscuit used for the sandwich is sweet - not savory. This blew my mind... as they had savory biscuits up on the pastry case. Why would you use a sweet biscuit to sandwich eggs and sausage?! Gross.

No one brought us our check.... so my partner stood up to stand by the register, where 3 other people were standing and not being helped. At one point, some other lady asks me if we want our check, and I say, oh he&#39;s up there already. So, she brings us our check instead, but doesn&#39;t stay long enough for us to just hand her our card... our actual server returns about 5 minutes later, takes the check, and brings us our change. We run away and never, ever, ever plan on returning. What a joke. Go to Geraldine&#39;s or any other great brunch place within a mile."

I got the Northwest Scramble which was basically a Smoked Salmon and Mushroom omelet.  Normally I don&#39;t like eating eggs, but there was enough other stuff in the omelet to keep me eating until I finished the plate.  

The plate also came with some potatoes, a few pieces of fruit, and a piece of toast or a biscuit.  I tried both the toast and the butternut biscuit and both were great.  They don&#39;t skimp on the breads - both were large pieces.  

Overall, I finished my plate and I was full and satisfied.  Their portioning was great for me (normally I either have leftovers or I&#39;m uncomfortably full).  I would recommend if you&#39;re looking for a nice brunch spot.  The staff is very friendly and the food is great."

Also, the waitress was too sweet, when I wanted extra foamy cappuccino she made me an extra special mug filled with my cappuccino and it was brimming with foam.

Strawberry scone, brewed coffee, and breakfast burrito with veggie sausage were all excellent, and kept me going all day on a trip to Mount Rainier. I&#39;d definitely come back if I needed to fuel up before a road trip."

The second time I came here I ordered the same thing. But this time it wasn&#39;t as good as the first time. The biscuits were a little hard, there wasn&#39;t much sauce, and my sunny side eggs were over cooked. It was like a piece of rubber on top of my biscuit and gravy.

I personally opt for the northwest &#34;scramble&#34; (smoked salmon, chevre, spinach) with tofu (instead of egg) + coffee (albeit a mild drip) and then invest the rest of my time in convo with friends and the occasional business meeting.

Note that on a weekend, and especially on a Bike Sunday, this place is packed and there is little room to move. The sun shines directly into the front windows and it can get uncomfortably hot inside at times. So make sure you find a place to sit at one of the outdoor tables!!

Try the jam they offer on all of their tables, it&#39;s sweet and tasty without being too sugary. Their coffee drinks are really well done (not always a given at a place that offers full breakfasts) and the pastry is to die for. I love their chicken sausage and it&#39;s always a struggle for me to decide whether to have bacon or the sausage when I decide to have eggs. Really like their Juevos as well.

The coffee was good, but our cups were empty for most of the time we were there (refilled only once).

We also ordered Havarti scramble with a biscuit, and a slice of pear and pecan bread. I was hoping for early arrival of the pear and pecan bread, but no such luck. As I was ready to start eating the jam on the table, the food finally came out!!

The scramble came with some fruits and potatoes as well as the flakiest biscuit. I am a huge Havarti fan, so I really enjoyed the scrambles with lots of spinach and cheesy goodness. The potatoes were crispy and seasoned well, and the biscuit was warm, flaky, and delicious with the jam. The pear and pecan bread was moist and sweet with a nice kick from ginger.

Lunch is what you&#39;d expect from a counter that takes pride in their meals. Espresso from a real machine and not a push button makes this almost the perfect place for me. A lot of quality breakfast/lunch spots only serve drip coffee and it&#39;s nice to find a place where they pull a good shot of espresso.

For the third time I have gone for a weekend breakfast I was a little bummed to be told that they are out of biscuits. It seems to me that if you have a signature item of renown, you&#39;d make sure to make more than enough for your busiest hours/days. It&#39;s biscuits, for cryin&#39; out loud - the ingredients are common, inexpensive, keep well easily, and they can be made in advance!

To add to the disappointment: it took over an hour to get our food - just eggs and such; nothing difficult or labor intensive. Being pumped full of strong coffee on an empty stomach as you wait, without explanation, for an indefinite amount of time, is a kind of agony. At the one-hour mark, my breakfast partner got up and left to walk up the hill to the grocery store for some food while I waited for the order to get it to go - he ended up eating before me. My guess is that when they ran out of biscuits, the kitchen put our order on hold, and after we adjusted our order the server never gave the &#34;go ahead&#34; to the kitchen - as I said: this is a guess as no explanation was ever given.

Inadequate prep in the kitchen, poor server/kitchen coordination and lack of server/customer communication made for a crumby weekend breakfast. 

I regret that after today&#39;s hour-plus long wait to be served (at our table), in the future I&#39;ll need to make sure no one in my party is hungry before we go - in which case: why not just make eggs for breakfast at home?"

I really gave it a lot of tries, but now after numerous attempts I am sorry to say this is just a two star joint.  It is your average coffee shop but here are some reasons why I give it two stars:
Minor things like they say they open at 7.  What they actually mean is 7:25.  Kind of a pain if you are timing them with your morning walk.  

The coffee is decent.  The baristas/waitresses are really friendly.  However, when I experienced their sitdown breakfast with my mother, my mom had to repeatedly get up and get her own coffee because our waitress never really came by to fill up.  We were the only people in the restaurant so I thought the service could have been conducted with a bit more alacrity.

Finally, I have had two meals here.  The biscuits and gravy and the ham &amp; egg sandwich.  Both were relatively flavorless yet were quite willing to exact their revenge on me a ways down the street, making the return walk home more of a hustle.

So in short, it&#39;s okay.  I would recommend just the coffee.  The baked goods are usually dry but the baristas are really friendly."

My group of 5 petite ladies gobbled up 5 entrees and 1 side. If we can do it, you can too. Serious food comas will ensue. 

Food: 

Dutch pancakes (4/5): It&#39;s like a cheesy apple thin crust pizza. 5 stars for surprising me as I would have no idea how this would taste. 4 stars after I got used to the taste.

Bunny chow (5/5): Indian influenced dish - basically chicken curry with fluffy bread and fried egg on top. Pretty delicious. 

Cornbread (5/5): Move out the way PB&amp;J. Pineapple and coconut are the new guys in town. I don&#39;t enjoy cornbread normally but this was made really well and soft. 

War chips (3/5): Reminded me of Cajun fries with some sauces and onion on top. Was oversalted for my taste.

Filipino garlic rice/pork/fried eggs (4/5): Tastes great but this one was not as inventive as the others. The bar was set too high!

Chicken and waffles (3/5): Chicken was way too breaded for my liking. Spices and flavoring was good but just thought the breaking was overkill. Also this dish was way too hyped for me.


Service: Waited 30 minutes to get the first of our dishes after ordering, which is pretty long since we said to bring things out as they are ready.

I&#39;ll have to admit it was hard to find something unique that I haven&#39;t tried already in another country. 

Since I haven&#39;t been to Trinidad or Brazil, the goat curry and acarajé enticed me. Portions are tapas style and everything is meant for sharing. The seating style is more of a communal seating so expect to be sharing tables with fellow diners around you. 

Goat Curry - The combination of goat curry and corn bread did not work well. In fact the curry was really salty when you eat it with the corn bread. I ended up getting a side of rice to dilute the taste down. The corn bread was also really sweet from the pineapple. Not sure how they would compliment each other. I would eat the pineapple corn bread separately not together with the curry. 

Acarajé - LOTS of flavor in this dish. It comes in a set of three, it reminds me of arepas but it has a crunchier shell. 

Taipei brrrito - This was a really interesting dish. I actually went to Taiwan earlier this spring and did not see any dessert that resembled this at all?? I was also kind of annoying to eat. It&#39;s basically an ice cream burrito that&#39;s held together in a flour crepe wrapper. It&#39;s sweet and savory with peanut brittle and coriander. I think I still prefer regular ice cream over this but it was interesting to try. 

Overall, I&#39;d say 3.5 stars for the creativity and the availability of cuisines from around the world. Entree portions could be a little bit bigger."

I had the South African Bunny Chow - which is an interesting combination of protein mashed in with a thick loaf of bread... similar to a soup bowl but with curry instead. Sounds delicious but each bite was so salty it burned my mouth. I probably could have used twice more starch to dilute the taste and enjoy my meal. 

Boyfriend ordered the Trinidad Goat Curry - which comes with the infamous pineapple cornbread. He thought it was OK, but when I tried it also seemed completely overwhelming. Perhaps the kitchen double-dosed the salt in both entrees?

After a while, I started feeling cramped and unsatisfied and wanted to leave, which made the service seem slow when it might have been fine. Pricey for sure."

One of my friends loved it and recommended way more dishes than we could realistically eat, and the other didn&#39;t care for their food at all. 

First, I love that they aren&#39;t a small plates only establishment. Sure, that works well with &#34;exotic&#34; food sometimes, but it&#39;s also nice to have few entrees to choose from.

We ordered the kale salad, brussels sprouts, wings and water beetles. Yes, they have water beetles, but they aren&#39;t on the menu and they&#39;re definitely worth asking for. I think I had more fun performing a water beetle autopsy on my plate than I did eating the guts, which tasted like extremely salty bubble gum. 

We got the goat curry for our entree, which came with a slice of the coconut bread, which was amazingly moist and definitely worth getting on the side if your dish doesn&#39;t come with it.

Service was awesome and attentive, even after the restaurant got busy. We&#39;ll definitely be back to try all the other dishes that Nue has to offer."

I was skeptical when I saw the menu but holy cow was I happy after that satisfying meal. Let&#39;s cut straight to the chase and talk about what to order. My faves were the Brussels sprouts and the lamb skewers for apps. So good that we ordered two rounds! But what really rocked my world was the South African bunny chow - such a Unique dish with an incredible blend of spices that you won&#39;t find anywhere else in Seattle (actually the case with all the dishes). The best is the sauce that soaks into the soft bread, mouthwatering!

Like I said, dishes are unique so there&#39;ll always be something that people don&#39;t like. Our entire table was not a fan of the cashew curry, too much cashew action and not much else. We also didn&#39;t love the sweet tangy flavor of the kale salad, so next time we&#39;ll do without. 

Love that ambiance is causal to match the street food theme. Benches and tables, kitchen behind a counter, and that&#39;s really all you get. Menu features street food from all over the world, not sure how authentic it was, but I can say it was tasty! Can&#39;t wait to go back."

While the concept of having a menu based off of street foods found around the world is unique and intriguing, the variety is as much a perk as it is a stumbling point. It&#39;s great to be able to experiment with different flavors and cuisines, but everything I ordered felt disjointed and hodgepodge - even some of the dishes as a whole seemed to be battling with themselves over what they wanted to be.

The South African Bunny Chow is a good example of this. Essentially a mild chicken curry, it&#39;s served in a Pullman loaf bread &#34;bowl,&#34; which was really just an unsliced Pullman loaf with the top removed and the curry spooned over it. The bread didn&#39;t maintain its texture and got soggy over the course of the meal, and overall just felt like a heavy and mismatched pairing. I ordered an overpriced side of a tiny amount of rice for $2.50, and wanted (more accurately, needed) more because it went so much better with the chow, but didn&#39;t feel I should pay $5.00 for rice, anywhere. For $16.00 for the chow, I expected a better experience, and more chow than bread.

Next up was the Chinese Rou Jia Mo. Described as the world&#39;s first hamburger, it&#39;s a bun stuffed with braised pork belly and shoulder, cooked in a variety of spices and topped with coriander and jalapeño. This was better than the Bunny Chow, with meat that was flavored and cooked well, but still managed to not leave much of an impression. Good, but slightly forgettable. $12.00 wasn&#39;t an outlandish price, but I wouldn&#39;t pay any more for it (it came with a side salad, too).

The pineapple cornbread ($4.00) didn&#39;t work for me. The texture was unpleasantly crumbly and dry, despite being so saturated with butter, and the pineapple was just sitting on top with nothing to do.

Entirely communal seating, slightly overpriced small portions, flavors and concepts that just didn&#39;t really work together. Maybe I got the wrong combination of dishes, but I wouldn&#39;t be jumping to come back on a future trip to Seattle."

I like spicy and street food, but all the dishes seemed to have a strange &#34;after-smell&#34; that irked me, like one ingredient was off on an otherwise rad dish. The pineapple cornbread was great, though. 

Added to this, I found the menu a bit expensive, especially considering the small plates (though this might be the downside of all tapas-style restaurants)."

*East Indies Brussels Sprouts - crispy, garlicky noms. LOVED this and recreated it at home.
*Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Wings - Tower of crispy, flavorful wings with a serious kick of spice. (not so jumbo though)
*South African Bunny Chow - nice flavors, but wished the portion was bigger for $16. Btw, this is not a bunny dish :) It&#39;s chicken + masala + pullman bread bowl. 

It was fun trying out their twist on international street food, but portions and prices could be better. We enjoyed the flavors and ambiance and getting our check in an old book with notes from previous customers was a unique touch. One major gripe - they only have bottled beer... I was seriously craving a cold draft to go with the Chengdu wings. I settled for what they had, but you know it&#39;s not the same!"

The ambience was quirky, upbeat, and fun. At a first glance the menu looks like an eclectic mishmash of random dishes from all around the world, from China to Africa to South America. How can a single restaurant produce authentic dishes from that many different cuisines, you ask? The answer is it doesn&#39;t! Food here is not bound by the restrictions of authenticity, rather it surprises and delights with fresh and interesting combinations of ingredients and spices. It&#39;s fusion done right!

Tip: family style is highly recommended. Go with a bunch of friends and order the whole menu so you can try everything Nue has to offer!

5 of us shared 8 dishes and every single one was delicious and satisfying. The prices were very reasonable too. I think our tab came out to just over $25/person before tips, and that includes a few drinks!

We ordered:

Syrian Kale Carrot Salad. I have to admit, I am not a salad person at all. I find most salads hopelessly boring. But this one was surprisingly tasty! It was full of flavorful goodies like dates, feta, toasted almonds, and pomegranate dressing, combining for a sweet &amp; tart &amp; umami &amp; nutty dish!

East Indies Brussels Sprouts. So much umami in this one little dish! Lovely texture, crispy edges with a little caramelization magic to bring out those amazing aromas.

Taiwanese Chicken Heart Poppers. Gamey, rich flavors, springy &amp; tender &amp; crispy textures, these were delightful and so fun to pop one into your mouth!

Grilled Octopus Skewers. The octopus was soooo tender! Chunks of pineapple were a great idea to add a pop of sweetness to an otherwise smoky and savory dish.

We tried both types of chicken wings and both were unbelievably tender. We all liked the Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings better - actually, this was my favorite dish of the night! It had such complex and deep flavors. The seasoning was just perfection and so well rounded too. I definitely ate more than my share of this dish and I can&#39;t even bring myself to feel any guilt over it.

Pineapple Cornbread with shredded coconut. This dish was sweet and fragrant and buttery. It tried to put a twist on the classic recipe, but in my opinion it was the least successful innovation. Sometimes you just can&#39;t beat the tried and true!

Jamaican Jerk Chicken. Another favorite! Absolutely worth the extra wait time, and it wasn&#39;t crazy long anyway. Crispy skin, tender meat, so so so incredibly tasty. The deep, smoky flavors permeate each mouthful and linger over your taste buds and make you want more! The black bean dirty rice was amazingly flavorful too - I could have happily eaten a heaping plate of just that.

Our entire group was in love with this place. We can&#39;t wait to revisit!"

The decor is pretty awesome as it reflects a global influence and they have happy hour from 5-6pm which discounts a couple bucks off house cocktails and offers some food items as well.

We ordered two happy hour items:  pig tails and grilled octopus.  Have to admit, I had to mentally get over the concept of eating pig tails, but the servers kept saying it was so good and we needed to try it, so we did.  It was very fatty and rich, but the meat on the tails were actually pretty good.  

The grilled octopus was also tender and good, but would probably opt to order something different next time.

Entree dish wise, we had trouble deciding since so many dishes looked interesting, but we finally settled on trying the goat curry.  It was definitely savory, the pineapple coconut cornbread it came with was super good, but definitely opt to get a side of rice with it as well.  It is pretty heavy and rich, and the rice helps to cut down on it a bit.  We did not get to try it, but I am curious about the seafood laksa and the chicken wings... perhaps will try that at another time.

Cocktails and in house liquor concoctions are interesting... there&#39;s a bottle with a snake eating a scorpion, a science looking contraption where scotch, everclear, and a bunch of other herbs and liquors (it was actually pretty tasty) were mixed together, a bottle with huge beetles in them... the liquor smelled really good, but the beetles... we didn&#39;t try that one, but definitely interesting.  and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more we didn&#39;t see.  

The one thing I will say that was quite distracting was that while the servers were very friendly, they would often sit there, eaves drop on our conversations and then suddenly interject and even join in on our conversation, uninvited, which I found was very odd.  Perhaps it was because we were sitting in the bar area and the restaurant wasn&#39;t too busy yet, but still...One time I could understand, but it happened over and over again during the course of our time there, which I felt was inappropriate, awkward and eventually started to feel kind of annoying after a while."

We came here because we stayed in the Capitol Hill neighborhood during our visit so it was convenient and it had great Yelp review.

We ordered the goat curry and the chengdu wings. The duck curry with the cornbread was delicious, other then it being a tag bit salty, we still loved it. 

The chengdu wings was awesome! 6 big jumbo pieces! I love love LOVE wings and so far my favorite is still the wings from San Tung restaurant in San Francisco. Although these chengdu wings are definitely a top choice for me in my wings experience. 

Price is a bit high but given how different and unique the food is and probably harder to find elsewhere, I would recommend it if you are adventurous

Corny, yes... but as I read through the menu, each dish had a different country origin. From Syrian to South African to Hungarian to Jamaican... there are so many different options to choose from. I had the Malaysian Curry Laksa ($16) split with a friend, which ended up being the perfect portion size for two people who were kind of hungry, but not starving.

It consisted of seafood curry, egg noodle, caramelized coconut cream, prawn, fish balls, egg, sambal, red pepper, and rau ram. Oh my goodness, it was delicious. The dish was beautifully plated, delivered in a reasonable amount of time (not too fast, not too slow), and it was so tasty.

I was really excited by the super interesting menu from the website and was very much looking forward to our lunch. It was definitely not as &#34;unique&#34; or adventurous as I thought it would be but it was still a yummy meal, which is #1 for me when it comes to restaurants. It also seems like their non-brunch menu has a few more unique options, so maybe their brunch is intentionally a simpler fare. Service was very attentive and prompt, even when we were one of only two groups sitting outdoors.

I ordered the South African Sunny Bunny and my friend ordered the Israeli Shakshuka. The Sunny Bunny was a very flavorful curry and the bread bowl was unique and I felt did not get too gross and soggy from the curry. The shakshuka was great for a tomato lover but definitely was a little more bland flavor-wise - probably perfect for a Sunday morning hangover. We also ordered the side linguiça sausage, which was pretty good and nicely spiced. The portions seemed just about right - I definitely was full even without the additional side sausage.

While it was an experience I&#39;m happy to have had, I will probably not be back due to the higher prices and the fact that the menu and idea for the place stuck out way more than the meal itself. However, I would recommend it as an experience and would consider coming back as something unique to show friends from out of town - but probably for dinner."

We came when the restaurant was completely empty; us being the second party of two. Our server, Alex, sat us and gave us a menu, and that was the extent of his helpfulness. When I asked about the cornbread and the strength of the coconut flavor, he offered to have it done without the coconut on top. I clarified twice that there would not be coconut on top, and alas, he delivered it piled high with coconut. I get it, people make mistakes, no big deal, but when he saw us shoveling off the mound of coconut, an apology or simple acknowledgment would have been nice. 

Our menu next items were the Bunny Chow and the lamb skewers. We were wowed by the Bunny Chow, and highly recommend trying it. The lamb skewers were also very good. 

Overall, the food was well worth going back for. 

Now, back to the service, because it only got worse. I finally flagged our absent waiter down asking for a drink--they didn&#39;t have what I wanted, so I requested a cup of ice (the water was served lukewarm). The waiter agreed, but it never came. I had to bother another waitress with it, who brought it immediately. 

We waited and waited for a dessert menu and finally our waiter dropped off the dessert menu, ran off, and never came back. We waited for a half an hour for him to ask if we wanted dessert, offer our bill, anything. He just never came. I had to get out of my chair and go ask him for the bill. At that point, any chance of us ordering dessert was completely tossed out the window. We were certainly done waiting on this guy. We weren&#39;t even able to return the bill to our waiter because he was practicing a constant disappearing act, so we handed it to another waitress. 

This was the closest I have ever been to stiffing a waiter. It was hard to put any tip on there given the terrible service. During our meal, two parties were sat on either side of us and were lucky enough to have a great waitress. Had she been our waitress, five stars all the way."

The curry was full of flavor and that bread .. Yum! 

For an appetizer get the East Indies Brussel sprouts, why? Because you can never go wrong with brussel sprouts and theirs was so delicious, made to perfection.. I think I&#39;m gonna have to find a way to make these at home!
The corn bread was also very good. Very moist, sweet and crispy all at the same time 

The other entrees we had were both of the jumbo chicken wings : Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings and the Hungarian Paprikash wings - my favorite of the two the Chengdu! They could&#39;ve gone a little lighter on the fish sauce but regardless they were finger licking delicious! And they&#39;re not kidding when they mean jumbo. 
I also enjoyed the Hungarian wings .. Some of my friends were not quite sure what to think of all the different spices but I honestly enjoyed it, I got more of a smoky chiles flavor while one of my other friends tasted more &#34;farm&#34; as they put it so I guess for those wings proceed with caution?? 
Next we had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken .. This one didn&#39;t really wow any of us at all  I mean it wasn&#39;t bad but I personally wouldn&#39;t order it again on my next visit.

Overall i love the concept of this restaurant- why only do one cuisine when you can serve all your favorite cuisines from around the world! That&#39;s my kind of style! So I will be back here for sure to try the rest of the thing so didn&#39;t get to and I&#39;m very excited to try their brunch."

Chicken wings were winners, with a great tasting fish sauce and fresh herbs.  Never had pig tail and was a bit apprehensive, but it tastes just like BBQ ribs with jerky-like texture.

Dinner one night, brunch the next day... but the food is so varied and flavorful that you just want more! They rotate their menu every once in a while also with even more inventive food from around the world.

Family style is the best way to do it, so you can try a bit of each dish. My hands down, absolute favorite is the Trinidadian goat curry with pineapple cornbread. I will cry if they ever take this off the menu, since I get it every time! Slightly sweet, with a little bit of heat, and the delicious gameness of goat, this dish summarizes Nue for me: a place where you can get authentic, adventurous food like nowhere else.

The Persian sweet pea salad is so on point right now too -- fresh crunchy snap peas with a light, citrusy dill dressing and labneh, a Lebanese cream cheese.

The Chengdu Spicy Jumbo Chicken Wings rival the famed Pok Pok wings.

A few very solid dishes, but that don&#39;t rouse the same kind of love: Maracas Shark and Bake (kind of like a good fish taco), Brazilian Acaraje (good, but not the same level of flavor as the other dishes), and Bunny Chow (a decent curry, but I&#39;ll stick with the more exotic dishes).

Brunch is also great -- you have some of the same dishes on the menu plus eggs (Pea Salad, Bunny Chow) with new ones. We got the Pea Salad, Israeli Shakshuka (a tomato/egg dish with pita), and Dutch Pannekoeken (a very thin pancake I just rolled up and ate -- sweet and savory with the bacon, can&#39;t go wrong!). There was even Chengdu chicken and waffles! Two dishes were rice based, which I didn&#39;t want to eat for breakfast, but that&#39;s what people eat in other countries!

Everything else was okay (e.g. Bunny Chow, Cubano, skewers, etc).  However, I wasn&#39;t a big fan of two dishes: Chendu fried chicken wings and the &#34;secret&#34; menu item water beetles. The fried chicken was overwhelming with it&#39;s fish sauce taste, and the water beetles, though cool to say you&#39;ve tried, tasted like overly salty watermelon jolly ranchers.

It was one of my most memorable meals during my visit to the city.

Every dish is a fresh take on street food items inspired by various locations from around the world. If you&#39;re looking for a diverse international (and extremely yummy) menu, look no further. Each dish is refreshingly unique and bursts with new and familiar flavors that&#39;ll whet your palette for more. I dined here twice before I left Seattle because ... why not? I couldn&#39;t get enough. 

It&#39;s really hard to pick my top dishes but the BEST ones I tried had to be...

PERSIAN SWEET PEA SALAD - SO REFRESHING! There&#39;s a perfect snap to the sweet pea and outstanding melding of flavors with the sauce topped w/pistachio pieces makes my tongue, oh I mean heart, melt. Heart. Tongue. Same difference. Don&#39;t get me started on the side of dolmas that accompany this dish. Extra salivating was had.

SYRIAN KALE &amp; CARROT SALAD - sounds simple but the flavors says different. I love my vegetables and when a restaurant can turn something as boring as kale and carrot and punch it up with flavors that make my eyes feel like popping out of my sockets and say, &#34;Oh my fu*king god,&#34; it&#39;s a winner. 

CHENGDU SPICY JUMBO CHICKEN WINGS - you&#39;ve seen photos galore of this lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely dish. It is worth ordering. If you have two or more in your party, do yourself a favor and order two of these babies. You&#39;ll have to fight one another for the last wing. I promise.

BRAZILIAN ACARAJE - Gently fried fritters wrapped in delicious goodness. PLEASE ORDER AND EAT THIS! 

GRILLED BARBADIAN PIG TAILS - meaty little things that have a really nice crunch to it. Don&#39;t be scared. 

ICE CREAM - they make their ice cream using liquid nitrogen. Yes, you read that correctly. Any and all flavors are wonderful but my ultimate favorites were VIETNAMESE COFFEE and MEXICAN SWEET CORN. Packed with flavor and texture - wow! 

And guess what? These dishes are all inspired by different regions from around the world - Persia, Syria, China, Brazil and Barbados. Where else can you get something like this in Seattle? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll wait. 

If you see the owner, Chris (which you will most likely because he practically lives there), please say &#34;Hi&#34; and introduce yourself. He&#39;s the host with the most and is responsible for this lovely, lovely, lovely restaurant. He is extremely dedicated to Nue and is a true food enthusiast and always looking to improve the menu and flavors."

It wasn&#39;t crowded so we could have practically any seat we wanted. Staff were super friendly about our sitting there with just waters, while we waited for our third friend.

Each of us ordered bottomless mimosas. Out of three refills, there was only one that I thought I waited longer than ideal for. However, I felt like the ratio was perfect - the amount of alcohol in each glass was generous and I was reasonably tipsy by the end of the meal.

I ordered the Israeli Shakshuka, as per the server&#39;s recommendation and the many Yelp reviews.  At first, I was timid, dipping the flatbread into the tomato base. I didn&#39;t understand the hype - the dish seemed pretty average to me. Then, I broke an egg and mixed in the green chutney. The result was PHENOMENAL. I don&#39;t remember what the server said was in that green mixture but don&#39;t be shy like me &amp; go for it! I also ordered the pineapple-coconut cornbread, which I don&#39;t think is fair for me to review because I have a love affair with all three of those things: pineapple, coconut &amp; cornbread.

I was lucky enough to be able to taste a few bites of my friends&#39; Filipino Tosilog &amp; South African Sunny Bunny and remember enjoying both, but the Shakshuka I ordered was by far my favorite of the three."

The concept of elevated street foods/tapas makes Nue a winner :)

Trinidad Goat Curry - Slow roasted goat/Caribbean spice/ginger, + Coconut &amp; pineapple cornbread.  The cornbread is excellent.  I liked it by itself and not with the curry, the two didn&#39;t sit well together but standalone very delicious.  The curry could use less spice, because the meat itself was tasty enough

Cubano Sandwich, Crispy Plantain Chips - Demi baguette/house smoked pork shoulder/ham/ house pickle/aioli/dijon/Swiss cheese - Unfortunately, not a huge fan of the sandwich.  Combination of flavours was boring and lacked a fusion element, but those plantain chips were to die for.  Maybe I just like plantain chips, but I&#39;m convinced they make it better than my grocery store.

Maracas Shark and Bake - Pacific rock fish/green seasoning/fry bread/cabbage slaw/
tamarind &amp; habañero; served w/ coconut corn cobette.  Never had a Pacific rock fish before this but now enlisting it into my favourite seafoods.  This was all kinds of delicious.  Not entirely sure what the green seasoning was, but the tamarind &amp; habañero were the bomb.  And the fish.  And the slaw.  And the bread.  This dish has 100% turned me into a fan of Trinidadian cuisine."

My wife said that they were the best wings that she ever had (and she normally does not like to eat chicken).   

They were the perfect combination of sweet and savory with that extra kick of umami that has left me craving for more. Better than the fish sauce wings at Ba Bar and on par, if not better, than Portland&#39;s Pok Pok wings.

It was actually way much heavier than I expected. Both of the drinks we ordered had way too much alcohol in it that I couldn&#39;t finish it (and I don&#39;t really mind a strong cocktail). They served complimentary coconut dessert balls at the end, which was also pretty good.

The atmosphere is really nice and you can look at the travel books that are around. Overall, the menu is interesting and I would like to go back to try more.

The balut was served viet style complete with rau ram my favorite! Entrees we got the chicken wings and rice paper salad. Wings were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Lightly glazed with fish sauce herbs and hot sliced peppers the wings were finger licking good. The rice paper salad was a treat to find here. It&#39;s usually a dish that&#39;s served as a drinking snack.

In the backdrop of the bustling Capitol Hill gayborhood, where, frankly, the competition is something fierce, Nue would be considered a bit more tucked away along 14th Ave and between the two arterial streets Pike and Pine. (code for: yes, you can snag street parking on a Sunday afternoon). 

The menu seems to vary month to month, according to the owners, but here is my assessment of Seattle&#39;s international gastropub.

1) Israeli mich (sp?) wrap with meat, egg, something crunchy dish, so fresh with a side of kale salad, julienned carrots, and raisons - wonderful, and to invoke a bit of Neruda, so brief the encounter, so lasting are the savory memories - please bring this back on the menu!  

2) S. African bunny chow in a baked bread bowl - unexpected but delicious.  Down side: I had to share it with my toddler. 

3) Trinidad goat curry with pineapple corn bread - what a brilliant pairing; the dense and desserty corn bread was so delicious, I could have eaten it as a meal all by itself. I liked the coconut shavings garnish, too. 

4) Now wait for this ... the liquid nitrogen Mexican street corn ice cream with lime zest - out of this world!!!  Yes, I&#39;d come here just for this.  Not to mention the other ice cream flavors like Vietnamese coffee flavor and haven&#39;t yet gone there, but maple bacon?!  Yeah, they went there.

The interior is so lovingly designed by the husband and wife co-owners, who, full disclosure, I was introduced to by a fellow internationally-based friend, so I do want them to succeed and to win you over like they have me."

We ordered the following:
Golden Gai Crispy Noodles, served room temperature with just the right amount of sauce and flavor against the crisp fried egg noodles;
Vietnamese Spinach and Herb salad, a little heavy on the herbs which made the greens lean bitter;
East Indies Brussel Sprouts, grilled perfectly with just enough crisp on the edges (why did my mother steam instead of grill or roast brussel sprouts?!?!);
Cubano Sandwich with Plantain chips, the only thing that warranted a box for leftovers because it was the last dish we ordered;
Grilled Barbecue Pig Tails, served with the yummiest glaze with a little something something added by squeezing the lime all over those little tails (a tip from our server);
and a side of the Pineapple Cornbread, served with coconut flakes on top.

It was amazing. 

The plates were all beautiful to look at and even better in my mouth. The service was great, and the menu offered a unique take on small plates Asian fusion style.

I had heard a little bit about this place, but wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Upon walking in, the place seemed small, but thankfully we had made a reservation so we got seated promptly. 

To drink, I got Nue&#39;s version of a Gin &amp; Tonic, which was pretty basic to me! There drink lists could be improved. I&#39;ve recently checked out their drink menu, and it looks to me that they have been getting more adventurous with their drink offerings - which is a major plus. To eat, we got the Trinidad Goat Curry &amp; the South African Bunny Chow. I know what I was getting myself into, but I was intrigued by the thought of eating a bunny, and a South African one that that! (i&#39;m joking of course). Both dishes have a heavy Indian influence. The Trinidad Goat Curry was easily a portion split between two people, and the pineapple cornbread was the icing on the cake. The cornbread went perfect with the blend of caribbean spices! The South African Bunny Chow was basically chicken curry on top of a thick piece of bread. The flavors were robust, yet it made sense on the palate. One thing to note was the sogginess of the bread near the end of the meal. I would of liked the bread to be served separate. 

While both were very basic dishes, I appreciated the thoughtfulness that went into constructing the flavor profiles of each dish. Perfect portions and I realized I was stuffed after scarfing down both those dishes, with the help of my friend. Definitely worth a second visit!"

Just enough vodka to start the weekend mixed with salted plum (bringing me back to my childhood when my mom use to buy for me as candy), and some lemon juice.  We got a few small plates to share:

- brussel sprouts with fish sauce and peanut sauce (taste better w/ the fish sauce)
- oyster mushroom skewers (not a fan of mushrooms but I wanted to try - the mayo sauce was great! ended up dipping the brussel sprouts in this)
- Malaysian prawn saksa - the prawns were huge!! I&#39;m glad they put the chili pepper on top, making it easy to scoop out. 
- and of course, we had to try the katsu sando w/ chips! Our favorite out of all the dishes! 

The liquid nitrogen ice cream selection that we got today was mango and I think it was vanilla with bacon inside. BACON!! in ICECREAM! The bacon sounded strange and still taste strange to me - my friend enjoyed it, I stuck w/ the mango and coconut pieces and was happily satisfied.

Every single interaction I had with the staff was so genuine and kind that when I got home I remembered that experience more than the food. Which says a lot because the food is excellent.

Wanting to try Nue, a friend and I popped by early on a Friday for dinner. We scoped the menu and had a hard time choosing fewer than 6 items to share. This was great though because it was (more than) enough food for us and the plate prices ranged from $4-11. So between the two of us -and a bottle of wine- we each spent about $40 including tip. Crazy!

Our international experience included dishes with Middle Eastern flair, South African flavors, and East Asian street food. We tried balut, which I&#39;ve never seen on a menu in Seattle! We also had Bunny Chow, dolma in the form of stuffed mussels, corn bread, a paté style sausage, and more. Everything was delicious, the plates came fast, and the food was super reasonably priced.

When asking about the origins of some of the dishes our server actually spent about 5 mins going into great detail about the food and the menu. She went so far beyond simply explaining the dish that she actually taught me something and I left this dining experience a smarter person. She was so generous with her time and knowledge that it left a lasting impression and I instantly fell in love with the entire experience. In fact, she was so happy that we ordered so much and remarked that we were &#34;adventurous eaters.&#34; That felt good to hear because I will eat anything and think that it&#39;s good to try new things. But if you&#39;re not finding yourself to be adventurous this is still a great place to eat. The food isn&#39;t too adventurous - it&#39;s just new to the PNW. Nothing scary, nothing risky - just fun and different.

There&#39;s still more to try on the menu so I&#39;ll be back soon. Great for small groups, lots of communal dining, some outdoor seating, street-side views, and a cute little bar. The space is kitschy and cute and very inviting."

The restaurant filled up throughout the night though.. probably just everyone wanting to try out this somewhat new restaurant. The menu is pretty straight forward, smaller plates on top and they get &#34;bigger&#34; towards the bottom, with the increase in prices. Everything&#39;s between $4-14 though, so not bad.. though you&#39;ll need more than one dish to get full for dinner. There&#39;s some unique, adventurous stuff like balut and pig tails.. but we stuck to the stuff we thought we&#39;d enjoy more. Here&#39;s my thoughts on what we tried:
 
South African bunny chow, $13 - not bad. I&#39;ve never had anything like it before.. it&#39;s Indian masala shredded chicken breast over a normal sized slice of bread, just cut really thick like french toast. The chicken was pretty flavorful.. I guess this was worth trying, and maybe my favorite thing we tried, but I&#39;d be okay not having it again. 

Spicy Korean jumbo chicken wings, $13  - no good :/ I think there were six wings? They weren&#39;t spicy and there was too much sauce. My friends and I agreed we&#39;ve had much better wings and would not recommend getting these. 
 
Prawn Laksa, $14 - this was okay... the bowl was pretty small for the price, but at least there were three shrimp. There wasn&#39;t very many noodles though, which is weird because noodles are cheap! Also, the curry broth was pretty bland - another disappointment. 
 
Japanese Yakitori king oyster mushroom skewers, $8 - I think there were four skewers and they were pretty good, compared to the other dishes. They were light, fresh and tasty with a nice combo of flavors from the pickled ginger and Japanese mayo.  
 
Overall, Nue offers a good variety but doesn&#39;t satisfy. This place may be overhyped because of its unique concept bringing in dishes from different cultures, but we were honestly underwhelmed. Also, the restaurant gets really loud when it&#39;s busy and there&#39;s some communal tables so you may be sitting close to a stranger (nothing wrong with that, but just something to note), Anyway, I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to coming back but I definitely wouldn&#39;t suggest it."

I like the idea, but when you take dishes that would be $1 local money and make it a hip little tapas plate in a cute spot in Capitol Hill and charge 5x the price, I see a bit of a problem, in both the concept and execution.

Having lived in a country where street food is one of the nation&#39;s pride and joys, there is something about buying your dish in a paper sleeve from some janky street vendor that makes it that much more of an experience. International street food is also incredibly complex and it&#39;s hard to narrow it all down into a neat little menu as Nue has done.

My party of 3 tried the chicken hearts, ChenDu chicken wings, and I had the Bunny Chow. All in all, food was pretty good but I&#39;m not sure of the authenticity of each dish. In my opinion, Nue put a slight fusion-type angle on each dish. I, for one, am not a fan of fusion food.

I think Nue is a great local place to try to widen your palate a little without committing to a table of international food that may not be to your taste. However, I think with some more effort, one could find better spots for specific international dishes that would be more authentic and better executed."

When I read about how they found their name, I thought it was unique and catchy. It wasn&#39;t until I ate there that I could feel the different flavors swimming in my mouth. When I walked in, I was amazed to see all the artwork and decor. I felt I was at home chilling out with a book and good company. I loved the feel of the restaurant and I thank my friends for wanting to try out this place. 

What caught my attention was really the balut. I never thought I&#39;d say this because knowing what it was, I never found it worth tasting. However, being the adventurous eater that I am, I had to and didn&#39;t have to fly thousands of miles away for the real thing. Now I tried it and I&#39;m NEVER eating it again. The soup at the top and the egg yolk was flavorful, but the actual underdeveloped duck fetus and the rock hard egg white below was unpleasant. I examined it for far too long only to let it get to me before swallowing it whole. (Insert shuddering here). 



A few other signature items: 

Chengdu Chicken Wings - If there&#39;s two places where I love eating wings, it&#39;s now Nue and Pok Pok in Portland. How do people make their wings so flavorful? I know how to make chicken wings, but I wonder if they poke holes in the wings so the marinade sinks through? This wing is flavored from skin to meat to bone. The one thing that Nue and Pok Pok succeed at is making my mouth completely numb with spiciness and even then, I can STILL taste the marinade! How do they do it? 

Grilled Barbados Pig Tails - I&#39;d take another few plates of this. Crispy deliciousness that&#39;s in a pig&#39;s tail and grilled to tenderness with a sauce that enhances the taste. 

Trinidad Goat Curry - I don&#39;t like goat for it&#39;s gaminess. Having said that, this dish doesn&#39;t have that at all. Either that or I was too busy stuffing my face with the cornbread side, I forgot about the gaminess. The dish actually comes with decent chunks of goat meat, a piece of cornbread, coconut shavings, and parsley. All the food I mention here was shared among four people and winded up to be quite filling.  

I LOVE cornbread and preferably the kind without corn chunks. The pineapple coconut cornbread was fluffy and full of that pineapple corn flavor. It&#39;s been the best cornbread I&#39;ve had in Seattle. It&#39;s so good, I&#39;d be glad to just go there and have cornbread and a cocktail. Haha. 

I recently saw pictures of the water beetle they serve, but is not on the menu. It&#39;s intriguing, but I promised myself I wouldn&#39;t voluntarily eat bugs. My adventurousness stops there. To anyone who&#39;s tried it, let me know how it tasted. I will live my bug eating days vicariously through you. 

What&#39;s even more creative is their desire for customer to share ideas from your home country. You never know, but your idea could wind up on their menu one day!

Hats off to you, Nue. I await your new creations."

Apparently, the restaurant has been open for just about a year.  The welcoming and friendly proprietor Uyen and her husband have created a interesting and diverce menu inspired by their travels.

This quirky restaurant fits into the Capitol Hill scene quite nicely. They take the concept of &#34;street food&#34; on a different level with a diverse and intriguing menu. I have to admit, I&#39;ve never tried a majority of the dishes that they offer! :P

Entering the restaurant, the wall display instantly caught my eye. Just visualize large wooden planks, quirky wall murals and a mishmash of decorations - I definitely got a &#34;street style&#34; vibe. I actually like that most of the seating is communal - we had fun recommending dishes to our neighbors and vice versa. :)

My girls and I went with the:
- Tequila-infused watermelon skewers - These suckers are dangerously tasty. ;) We ended up getting a few rounds...

-Japanese Yakitori King Oyster Mushroom Skewers - Nothing too out of the ordinary, I would definitely recommend this dish if you love mushrooms! 

-Hungarian Paprikash Jumbo Fried Chicken - Didn&#39;t make too much of a splash with our group. We felt that while the paprika seasoning was tasty, there wasn&#39;t much else to it. :T

-Kerala Prawn Laksa Lamak - MMM, our favorite of the night! The curry broth is where it&#39;s at - slightly spicy and all together tasty. I would come back just for this!

-Mangosteen Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream - If you have room for dessert, definitely go for the ice cream - it was a refreshing way to end the meal!

I believe Nue also has a drink happy hour from 4-7PM, with $3 off their featured cocktails. Try the Little Diddy - the jackfruit cocktail was delish! :)"

Nue is fairly small, with communal seating, a few seats along the front window, and a small bar. It smells amazingly delicious inside and you really get to know your neighbors while dining.

The street-food themed menu is eclectic and basically the equivalent of a trip around the world.  We were lucky enough to have the owner as our server, and he did an awesome job explaining his vision for the place and the cuisine. There were two specials on the board, so we decided to go for it, even though one of them was Thai water beetles. Yes, you heard me right. Water. Beetles. 

On the menu:
The aforementioned water beetles
Sriracha cheddar corn fritters with cilantro cream
Hungarian paprikash chicken wings
Barbados pig tails
Trinidad goat curry 
Jackfruit sorbet
Vietnamese coffee ice cream

Basically, we feasted. For me, the highlight of the night was the goat curry and the water beetles. The curry was flavorful and complex, with a hunk of grilled cornbread that complimented it perfectly. While frightening at first, the water beetles were actually kinda funky and surprisingly tasty. It was basically a flavor explosion of floral, sweet, savory, and unlike anything I&#39;ve ever experienced, but in a great way. Surprise!

Dessert was the weakest link, but I&#39;m already planning my next visit(s), so I can knock off the rest of the menu items. Get here and try this place ASAP. Your taste buds will thank you."

I&#39;ve been waiting eagerly for this place to open. International street food definitely got my attention. And they totally delivered as promise.

Hungaria paparikash wings _  don&#39;t hold back the paprika for me! I love the crunchiness. It is so good.

Bunny Chow - no bunnies were harmed for this dish :) South African style chicken curry with well balanced spices. Serves in a bread bowl! 

Carribean goat curry - yummm! I love curry goat everywhere in Carribean. Usually these are serve more dryer style with rice and beans and plantains. But this one is serve in corn bread. I&#39;d love some rice though. But it is still pretty tasty.

Kerala prawn laksa - this might be my new favorite. It is nice and spice! Rice noodles are kind of chewy and kind of not. That touch of sambal! Prawns! Yummm. Too bad they don&#39;t serve this in a bigger bowl :)


I&#39;ve also tried other things like pakoras , oyster skewers and their Vietnamese salad. Have yet to try that duck egg though. It might be next on my list. Décor is super cute and casual.  It has a little bit of everything from around the world. Little souvenir type decors.The staffs quite nice. The owners are super friendly!! People doing what they are passionate about?

To our surprise, we were actually in for more! Nue prides itself in the theme of worldwide cuisine and I really enjoyed their spunky, colorful travel ambiance. The menu itself is both interesting and confusing with all the exciting names and cultural references from around the globe. We ordered the Chengdu Chicken and Waffles, Dutch Pannekoeken with apples, Israeli Shakshuka, South African Sunny Bunny, coffee, and a mimosa. The chicken and waffles was probably our best order. I may be partial to Chinese cuisine, but the sweet, spicy, sticky wings and drumsticks really hit the spot for me. Waffles are scrumptious and on the thinner, less crispier side. The shakshuka was a close second favorite, I probably would&#39;ve liked it more had it been less soupy and more textured. If you&#39;re thinking about mimosas, go big and get the bottomless because the single glass is teeny tiny! Our server was real sweet and treated us to some corn bread (topped with coconut flakes and black sesame seeds, mmm) that the kitchen accidentally made, which totally won some brownie points from me.

We&#39;ve always been properly satisfied with the food and service. Try the new dishes or their rotating liquid nitrogen desserts! The flavor profiles are often unexpected, delightful, and adventurous!

Our favorites include the cornbread, goat curry, pig tails (albeit a bit greasy, how can it not), the Chengdu wings, and the Mexican Street Corn ice cream.

Recently, we tried the Brazilian Acaraje, which was delicious and reminded me of crab cakes, but with a solid texture and pops of tangy flavor. The Chinese Rou Jia Mo was essentially a pork sandwich with a stir-fry type of flavor; although hearty, it&#39;s not as unique or layered as the other dishes. And finally, that Peach Sorbet was the best peach sorbet I&#39;ve ever had. It tasted like real peaches, not like the artificial junk you find in commercial products or the off-kilter balance of gelato and ice cream shoppes.

Cocktails are another adventure! Just eeny-meeny-miny-mo it if you&#39;ve never been here and are open. Then try the rest! Sophisticated and different.

Finally, I can&#39;t not mention the restaurant owners, who are especially nice, passionate, and hard-working! They are often seen hosting and serving along with their waitstaff.

As a tip, the space itself is fairly small, so don&#39;t expect to bring 20 coworkers in here for happy hour."

Everything was delicious, especially the jerk chicken. The chicken was tender, flavorful, and moist. So good. The pig tails were pretty tasty. A little too fatty for my taste, but I enjoyed the crispy skin on the pig tails. The bunny chow was tasty, but I didn&#39;t really like the bread bowl it was in. I could do without it.

Walked in and there is no host/hostess, its a community table sit yourself place. Went in for a late lunch so it wasnt too busy.  New place, not too big, 2 long community tables, and a small bar area in the back.  Open kitchen where they cook near the front of the restaurant when you enter. 

Menu is a International street food concept. We started out with the Ethiopian Spiced Canchita, its their homemade version of corn nuts. Fried corn, peanuts, some awesome spices, a little spicy and quite flavorful.  Good starter to nibble on before you get your mains.  

We got the South African Bunny Chow: I was hoping it would be rabbit but its chicken breast.  A chicken masala curry dish all on top of a big piece of pullman bread.  I love a good curry and this was pretty good.  Awesome when the bread soaks up the curry.  A little spicy, good curry flavor and a good portion size.  

We also got a Cubano Sandwich with plantain chips. I love me a good Cuban sandwich, so I had to try their version.  The pork was very good, pulled pork style not sliced pork, melty cheese and good bread but not very flattened out.  

Overall, we enjoyed the food very much but the service wasnt the greatest, my water glass went totally empty so we had to share our other glass. When our entrees arrived that was the last I saw of our waitress. Couldnt find our waitress to get our check, so I just went up to the bar to request it from someone else.

-trinidad goat curry: really good! The pineapple cornbread was to die for!
-the jumbo korean chicken wings: our favorite! An absolute must, and it wasn&#39;t too spicy!

We decided to skip the balut because we can get those at a Vietnamese market for about 50 cents each so 7 dollars for one is a bit pricey. Service was quick / attentive and I overall enjoyed the food; again, it wasn&#39;t out of this world but I would come back here."

Nue&#39;s menu and vision statement read like that self-absorbed friend who can&#39;t wait to tell you about how expansive their world view is after going to Southeast Asian on their trust fund. Thankfully their food is amazing and as strange as a global menu sounds outside of a food court, it really works well.

The surprise must order dish was the Barbados Pig Tails, they have such an impressive pork flavor and the sweet glaze makes it approachable to almost everyone. The Korean Fried Chicken wings were battered a little too heavily to be real KFC. But they were still fantastic, crunchy and moist on the inside. Be warned that the very spicy is extremely hot. Well off the standard Thai food star scale. The Golden Gai Crispy Noodles lacked textural variety. We did love the Goat Curry, it was simple but delicious and the cornbread was interestingly sweet.

It gets crowded quickly and we were surprised that our reservation for 2 automatically put us at the bar. So be aware if you want a table you might have to request one. Our bartender was fun and informative and we enjoyed the drinks as well. I&#39;d skip the alcohol infused &#34;shots&#34; the watermelon/tequila combo we had was seriously lacking booze.

We ordered the hungarian wings, the taiwanese chicken hearts, the east indies brussel sprouts, and the balut. There was also a cocktail menu that seemed pretty creative. The brussel sprouts were so delicious, lightly grilled to perfection. The chicken hearts were too flour-y for my tastes. The crispy covering was a bit dry to the taste. I&#39;ve had balut before so I was a bit surprised when I saw Nue&#39;s version of the balut. Instead of a semi-fermented chicken egg, they cooked it all the way through and you spice it yourself. Crack it like you would any hard boiled egg, season, and then scoop out. Try not to look at it because it&#39;s not a pretty sight. The wings were quite plenty and just as messy. They were delicious with a slightly spicy kick. We also got ordered a nitrogen dessert, sadly not an ice cream because it was something with bacon bits which I am not a big fan of in any ice cream I&#39;m going to eat.

Pretty cool concept to be able to get everything from a cuban sandwich, anticuchos, all the way to Chinese sausages.  So while the menu is eclectic I would definitely say they lean more towards the asian side of things.  The food is affordable, approachable, the dishes are well seasoned and executed across the board.  Although this is technically marked as small plates/tapas the larger dishes can stand alone as a meal in of itself.  

I was able to try the maracas shark and bake, cuban sandwich, anticuchos and the taiwanese big sausage wrap.  My favorite dish was the maracas shark and bake because all the flavors were just so perfectly combined in the sandwich and it had all the right contrasting textures as well.  The worst was the cuban sandwich, it was definitely lacking in the pickle department and the cheese could have been better.  The anticuchos could have been cooked a little better with some pieces of the heart awesomely tender while other pieces were incredibly chewy.  The taiwanese sausage visually was a pretty cool dish.  The sausages however were not homemade and looked like it was the same stuff you can find at any Chinese grocery store.  I did like the whimsy of making a bun out of sticky rice but the rice was far too dense and the sausage far too small for the amount of carbs on the plate.

All in all, I would really give this 3.5 stars, the restaurant is small, communal table seating, nicely decorated, a bit kitschy but nice cute in a thrift store kind of way.  Not a bad place to take a date for something a little more casual and the service here was good from both the waitstaff and kitchen."

We came for happy hour/dinner and ordered:

-East Indies Brussels Sprouts, Crispy Fried Brussels Sprouts, Coconut and Garlic Chutney, Peanut Satay and Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce -blackened with a peanut sauce that didn&#39;t complement the vegetable. It was the best of the three dishes we tried but that&#39;s not saying much.

-Golden Gai Crispy Noodles, Fried Egg Noodle, Crispy Anchovy, Chili, Lime Leaf, Beni Shoga- I would barely call these noodles. They were fried to a crisp; it felt like we were just eating breading and it was hard to eat and un-noodle-like. 

-Turkish Midye Dolma, Chilled Penn Cove Mussels Stuffed with Arborio Rice, Pine Nuts, Raisins, Orange Zest, and Ottoman Spice. Assorted Olives- There was way too much happening in these mussels. It completely took away from the seafood and I didn&#39;t like the Ottoman Spice at all. The flavor is completely bizarre and there was only about 8 mussels total. 

The best thing we ate here was the complementary dessert.

The bread was good by itself but it was a little strange to have the cornbread with curry. Rice as a side dish was $2.5! and the portion was tiny. Apart from that, nothing jumped out to us in term of pricing. We love the experience overall. We would love to go back there again. The place has great ambience, casual, and yummy food! 

We ordered a baked dessert which took forever. We waited 10+ minutes after the meal and decided to cancel it at the end. The staff was really sweet and understanding. it was all good!"

I love the menu: innovative but fun and unpretentious. The small plate format is always fun-sharing food is always a good time. My fiancee and I had 4 small plates and it was too much food! We should have ordered 3. The waitress let us know that the bottom portion of the menu corresponds to the bigger portions, which it easier to decide on dishes.

My favorite dish was hands down the goat curry. It was perfectly flavored and the goat meat was nice and tender. I loved the cornbread that came with it-it was a perfect accompaniment. 

Sidenote-the chicken wings are a very heavy dish. I would hate to know the calorie counts on those things. Very tasty though. Also, I never thought I would see Tostilocos on a restaurant menu. I was pretty shocked when I saw this. Very cool though. 

Also, I love the space itself. Intimate with wood everywhere (floors, tables, walls). So cozy-reminded me of some places I ate in when I was in Tokyo. We were lucky we went late on a Sunday and the place was pretty much empty. Otherwise, we probably would have had to wait.

Also, this place plays some great music. I have NEVER been to a restaurant that played Hello Seahorse, a indie Mexican band that no one ever seems to know about. Thumbs up for that!

Will definitely revisit when I am in Seattle again!"

However I wasn&#39;t really wowed by it. I ordered the Trinidad Goat Curry, Indian Sundal, and the Tostilocos. By far the curry was my favorite dish, the slightly sweet cornbread was a great compliment and helps cool your mouth down. 

The Sundal wasn&#39;t as flavorful as I expected it to be based off of the description. It just tasted like a chickpea salad dressed with lemon poppyseed dressing. The Tostilocos are basically powered flavored chips topped with pico de gallo. Pretty disappointing. All in all, while I liked the idea of having a diverse menu, not every dish is a home run.

It was a problem since I came by myself...  Next time, I&#39;m bringing a group.  And I usually question a place that tries to do too many cuisines because that&#39;s not easy to do.  But, the food absolutely reminded me of street food from around the world. 

Oh, and don&#39;t forget to order one of their pineapple cornbreads.  It&#39;s like if a Taiwanese pineapple pastry combined with a regular cornbread and had babies.  It was awesome.  Their happy hour from 5-6pm will help you save a few bucks."

I&#39;m a firm believer in sticking to your specialty but I do like the concept of &#34;international street food&#34;. Between 3 of us, we ordered pineapple corn bread, dutch pancake with bacon and apples, chengdu fried chicken &amp; waffles, and a South African snow bunny. 
The dutch pancake split the table, as it was a very interesting mix of sweet and salty. People probably either love it or hate it. The fried chicken &amp; waffles were amazing. The chicken wings were ridiculously tender, perfectly fried, hit with a little bit of spice, and topped with a drizzle of maple syrup. The waffles were fluffy and the portion was huge. The snow bunny was a curry spiced chicken stew poured over a thick cut of unsliced white bread that had been scooped to form a bowl. It was topped with a fried egg. The stew was hearty and flavorful, and the egg went well with it. Also a huge portion, I wasn&#39;t able to finish it, especially with all the bread. The cornbread was topped with toasted coconut flakes (YUM) and was a little sweet and perfectly crusted on the outside. It was served with a huge glob of butter and syrup. 
The food took a little longer than expected to come out, which was surprising since there weren&#39;t that many parties there. However, the service was great!"

Everything sounded  inventive and looked delicious. We ordered the chicken wings, Cuban sandwich , and the coconut cornbread . Everything LOOKED great but sadly flavor wise it fell short ! It didn&#39;t taste bad , i just wasn&#39;t wow&#39;d. The wings initially were good but it had sort of a bitter finish that progressively grew. Kind of like bitter melon .  I personally don&#39;t like that kind of bitterness ; it&#39;s an acquired taste . But I can see why some people would love this dish. It was Bitter, sweet, salty, sour and sweet! I&#39;m glad I tried it tho.

The Cubano was a bit heavy and the ham or pulled pork was overly smoky. First bite was good then the smokiness got sickening.  The plantain chips were on point tho.

Seattle&#39;s burrito scene is dismal but Malena&#39;s has a tasty carne asada option and delicious salsa. The quality of the food, however, is overshadowed by how poor the service is. I have been a few times and it is highly disorganized and understaffed. My most recent wait time was 40 minutes and I have vowed not to go back. You are given a number but that rarely corresponds to your order. They are very busy, making the choice to have one person attending to the counter and one cooking seem short sighted. While you wait, there is not adequate room to sit or stand which lends to you and a lot of other waiting customers shuffling around. Have I mentioned that it is very hot in there? The staff is nice but often confused about the status of your order and which order is in fact yours. 

If you have all the time in the world, snag outside seating (there are two tables and chairs), and are good with a little chaos, Malena&#39;s might be your place. For me, I&#39;m opting to go to El Camion from here on out."

This review is based on a single experience but I would certainly go back.

Food:
I had the carne asada soft taco with guacamole. The guac was delicious, and the seasoning on the meat was spot on. The aftertaste was so good I held off on eating cookies from across the street because I didn&#39;t wanted it to linger. Freshly made and cooked.

Service:
Not much for chit chat and I was the only one there. Even with my single taco order they gave me chips and salsa.

Value:
Portion size was great for the value and they didn&#39;t skimp on the meat. 

Location:
The place is quite run-down but they do have some outdoor seating which in the summer would be quite nice.

Comments:

The menu had more things to offer, and they also advertised another location they just opened at Greenlake. I&#39;d like to check that location out as they have a slightly different menu than they do at this Queen Anne location.

If it wasn&#39;t all the way in the obscure part of Queen Anne I would come back and visit. But considering the fact that i live in mexican food bus country here in Puyallup, I&#39;ll come back when I&#39;m in the area hankering for some good, inexpensive mexican food."

3 stars? Well that&#39;s all I like at Malena&#39;s. I&#39;ve tried their bean and cheese burrito. Um how do you mess that up? There was hardly any cheese but it was loaded with rice that was flavorless... 
I wouldn&#39;t eat here this place is tiny and not that nice but like I said if you want good crunchy tacos get them to go and bring cash!"

It&#39;s everything that a taco shop should be: small, slightly hole-in-the-wall-ish, cash only, and solid food.  Highlights are that it&#39;s fast (food ready in just a few minutes); it&#39;s fresh (fresh veggies on the tacos really make a difference); and it&#39;s cheap, if you skip the rice &amp; beans ($2.35/taco).

My favorites are the pork adobada burrito/taco (mouth watering shredded pork, guacamole, fresh diced cilantro, onions and tomatoes) and the fish tacos (crispy fried fish, mayo, crisp cabbage and fresh diced tomatoes).   Pic attached.

Their salsa is homemade and is probably the best salsa I&#39;ve eaten, ever.  It&#39;s not super spicy, but it&#39;s definitely fresh &amp; flavorful, and maybe a little salty (in a good way).  The guac is awesome as well.  I don&#39;t think the chips are [always] fresh, but the salsa is so addictive I don&#39;t really mind. 

I normally order to go since the seating area is small, though it&#39;s nice to eat on the sidewalk outside on a sunny day.   Overall, highly recommend."

I can only comment on the Adobada Burrito, it was the first menu item I tried and the only one thing I&#39;ve ordered ever since (I guess I&#39;m a sucker for roasted pork &amp; guacamole).  Moist &amp; flavorful, the kicker is to add their salsa/sauce with each bite.  

Staff is pleasant &amp; courteous and it has it&#39;s own &#39;hole-in-the-wall&#39; charm, but don&#39;t come here expecting a &#39;refined&#39; dining experience. (Self-serve H2O comes from a Gatorade container if that helps give you a sense of its &#39;rustic&#39; nature)  Cash only is a slight inconvenience, but not a big deal if you know this beforehand.

However, the food was passable and delivered quickly and the prices were not too much.  The last couple of times I have been there we have had bad service and also were overcharged.  The first incident we took the food home and discovered missing items.  So we called them and they got into a big argument with us that they had given us what we ordered and if we wanted the missing items they would charge us.  Eventually, they relented and gave us what we paid for...but of course we had to make a return trip.  In the second incident I ordered our food for take out while in the place.  I thought the price paid seemed high, so I added up the order and found they were overcharging us about $1.50....not too much to worry about.  Then when they gave us the food there was one item missing.  They claimed they had not charged us for it and that we need to pay - saying all this in front of the other customers.  Then I told them that what you charged us included all that and more!  Again...they relented and gave us the item.  Just bad customer service to be bad mouthing you in front of the crowd....and they were wrong to boot!"

I could end there... but I&#39;m trying to avoid one-line reviews, so I&#39;ll continue.

I joined a big group of people from my office for some lunch tacos at Malena&#39;s. The sun was shining, the day was warm, and there were quite a few of us, so we went for the outdoor seating. It was street seating and not a sweet patio with a view of a lake or mountains or something else fabulous, but it was still pretty sweet.

The boss was paying so I didn&#39;t have any interactions with the staff beyond ordering my food and saying it was on his tab, so all I really know is that they took my order and delivered some delicious tacos to my table.

I eat here mostly out of the convenience of its location, but also because while it isn&#39;t the greatest mexican food you will have in your life, it is consistent. The carne asada burrito is unlike what I&#39;m used to from San Diego, but its good for what it is (more like a fajita in burrito form). I recommend eating it with a knife and fork as it can get drippy. The adobada burrito (roasted pork + Guacamole, rice, beans) is the best thing I&#39;ve had on the menu. Prices seem high, but portions are huge. 1 burrito could feed 2 people depending on how hungry you are.

Today I had three of the worst fish tacos I have ever had. The fish was brittle and dried out but not even warm, like it had been cooked previously and thrown into my tacos after the fact. Worst of all, I paid almost nine dollars for this horrible meal. I can hardly understand how other people enjoyed this place. They must serve something good, but the fish tacos are not that thing.

For better fish tacos try Agua Verde or the El Camion taco truck in Ballard (they do theirs with fresh fish instead of fried but I think both ways can be good). Hell, I&#39;d recommend the fish tacos at Taco Del Mar over this place. In fact, TDM is head and shoulders above Malena&#39;s in price, food quality, and even warmth of food. Cold and dry fish is not my thing."

He and I were looking for cheap (like day before pay day cheap) places to eat, but we wanted to explore more delicious food in our neighborhood on Queen Anne.  
And Queen Anne isn&#39;t known for their cheap eats.

So I suggested Malena&#39;s!  Raven and I have drove by or walked by this place many times over the year we&#39;ve lived on Queen Anne.  And it has always been in the back of my head as an alternative to Taco Bell or Taco Time down at the bottom of Queen Anne Hill.

****remember that Malena&#39;s is cash only****

I would personally rate Malena&#39;s a three star.  I had a delicious chicken fajita, and it was grilled well.  I mean, I quite liked it.

But Raven had an extremely sad experience.
He ordered the veggie tacos.  And the veggie tacos only come with lettuce, tomato, and beans like any veggie taco you&#39;d order.  He presumed for the $8 or whatever he paid that he would have bell peppers and grilled onions like I had in my fajita to compliement my chicken.  
And then he complained that the nacho chips we had with our table were stale, that they &#34;tasted distinctly stale.&#34;  And the side of beans tasted like they were &#34;kind of fresh out of a can....&#34;

Oh.  And to top it off.... Raven found HAIRS in his tacos.
So back will we go?  Definitely not.

I&#39;m happy to have gone and supported the local business though. :)"

Luckily for the QA crew, Malena&#39;s was fired up and dishing out.  We trudged through the snow, up and down hills, slipping, sliding, watching cars (and a very determined moving van) *almost* bite it left and right.  

We made it to Malena&#39;s only to find that the tiny seating area was PACKED.  I was last to walk in, so I tried to close the door behind me, and couldn&#39;t really figure out how the restaurant wanted the door closed because the deadbolt was out.  (Keep in mind it was damn cold outside.)  At that point, a woman sitting near the door started telling me what to do, but was not clear...and finally, exasperated, she grabbed the doorknob from me, did exactly the opposite of what she was telling me to do, and closed the door.  

Listen lady, I realize you&#39;re sitting in the prime spot that gets cold every time some doofus walks in the door and that you&#39;ve probably tried to tell every one of them how to close it.  I further get that your holidays are stressful, the snow is making it a million times worse, the food isn&#39;t making up for all that, aieotewtiuaoegu aegaewrjiow!  HOWEVER, would it kill you to either be clear with your directions on how to close the door, or if you do choose to close it for me, could you be a little more gentle, or god forbid, give me a smile?  Good will and all that...it IS the holidays, after all.

So now that that&#39;s finally out of my system....

I got the chorizo burrito, with visions of sausage chunks dancing in my head.  And dfens and I got the rolled tacos to share later, as we had been eating TJ&#39;s taquitos since I arrived and apparently, we wanted more of the same kind of thing.  

When I received my burrito, I was disappointed to find more of a ground meat and less &#34;chunks&#34; (am I chorizo-ignorant?).  Either way, the taste wasn&#39;t really satisfying, and the burrito seemed more like a breakfast burrito than I was expecting.  And I&#39;m sad to say that I actually preferred TJ&#39;s taquitos to the rolled tacos. :-/  

Finally, we were forced to sit outside in the freezing cold on some okay-comfortable metal chairs with matching metal tables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iyBOsGLVBl-OxTXpo_x0bg?select=zfd_wDiXLGKVvcH0Mi8yUA).  (Don&#39;t let the happiness of Amelie the puppy fool you, she was shivering.)  There was absolutely no room for us in there...and definitely no room for both me and that cranky woman."

The first time I went, I got a shredded beef burrito. It wasn&#39;t necessarily my preference (just unspiced meat, peppers, and onions), but it was still good. 

I came back the other day to try again, this time for the actual tacos. I got the carne asada taco, and was absolutely enthralled. Deliciously grilled, good tortillas, pico de gallo, guacamole--and a salsa (not the same as the chip salsa) that sealed the deal. This was the best taco I&#39;ve had since I came back to the states after living in Guadalajara for half a year. I will definitely return.

Pro tip: if you don&#39;t care that much about the rice and beans on the side, just get a taco or two off of the bottom of the menu. Much cheaper."

I asked the sweet woman that helped me for her favorite dish, and ended up with fish tacos.  They. Were. DELICIOUS.  Crispy fish, delicious white sauce, and perfect toppings.  Just like home.

The food is a bit pricer than a regular taco truck (duh), but of course, the quality and variety is much greater.  I got one fish and one carne asada taco plate.  The tacos came with a side of rice and beans-- good texture and not at all mushy as I&#39;ve noticed other Mexican restaurants tend to serve.

First, we ordered to go five tacos with chips and salsa and a side of guac and the total bill was $15! Second, the tacos themselves were just delicious: well-seasoned chicken, fresh veggies, cheese, buttery hard shells... The soft shell tacos were great as well--I had the veggie--but I liked the chicken taco better, because the beans in the veggie were whole.  One thing I didn&#39;t like were the chips; they tasted like they were a basic chip you could purchase at the grocer&#39;s, and I&#39;m always impressed by homemade tortilla chips, but that&#39;s really the only downside I saw in my experience at Malena&#39;s.

It&#39;s true: The salsa is amazing--I agree with another reviewer when she said that you can practically drink the stuff! I admit, the guac IS different than most other I&#39;ve had, but I actually really liked it. It was super creamy, fresh, and not browned. My most favorite thing? NOTHING was too spicy, which is great for me, because I cannot eat spicy foods for fear of internal retaliation.

I had the Carne Asada which was I think 8 bucks and I didn&#39;t get my money&#39;s worth. There were WAYY too many vegetables and not enough meat the ratio was crazy. Plus the meat was bland! There was no sauce I had to smother that burrito in tapatio just to make it edible. The second thing I got was a fish taco..I LOVE fish tacos..and I hated this fish taco.

The Chicken tacos are where its at--freshly fried with a huge dollop of guacamole on top make these tacos melty and crispy and delicious! The Chile Relleno is not something to write home about, in fact, its something to skip. I also like the bean burrito, pretty basic but pretty good too.

The chicken soft tacos is also very good, with plenty of flavor from the marinade.  The one disappointment was the tamale, which was pretty hard and lacking in flavor.  I vaguely recall that was how it was 14 years, so seems like they have managed to keep all things consistent.  I had 2 tacos and a tamale in a single sitting and could barely walk.

Food is cheap though right?  Not really.  When you consider that a 2 oz container (think NyQuil cap/cup) of Guacamole is 1.50?!  That&#39;s barely enough to spread over one chip or the large side of beans was barely four spoonfuls.

  I&#39;m afraid Taco Bell has done a lot to dumb down our tastebuds and make us believe that Iceberg lettuce and grated cheese belongs on our tacos.

We knew we were in for a depressingly inauthentic lunch when we were served a bowl of deliciously spicy salsa next to a basket of WHAT??? TOSTITO ROUND CHIPS? Wow. I have never seen a taco shop incapable of making their own chips. Then came our overpriced, underseasoned meals: the inadequately spiced beans were from a can, the rice was reconstituted from a box, and my tamales were obviously microwaved after a short stint in the kitchen freezer.

To my surprise, the cook (owner) asked if I had been here before because he seemed to remember me. I was actually taken by surprise and answer yes. However, given that I previously had been here so often, that it was more of a pleasant surprise, rather than a creepy one, that he would remember me. What more about this place was that while waiting for my food, the owner gave me a complimentary side of rice to go for free, too :)) He was super kind and mentioned I got it because I seemed like a nice person hahaha :) I guess that&#39;s how I trick people into giving my sad look some complementary thing :)

Well, mind you, I&#39;ve only had gyro and some of their greek fries before, but had never before tried their rice...MY GOSH... THE RICE WAS EXCELLENT!! I don&#39;t know how he made it..but IT WAS SO AROMATIC AND TASTY THAT EATING RICE ALONE WOULD BE JUST AS GOOD.

My initial impression of the interior was that of being dark bordering on dingy but with a good amount of seating for the buildings size.  The staff on hand at the time was very patient, courteous and efficient/skilled behind the grill.  I ordered the lamb gyro and opted against the offered added heat; personally I&#39;m a lightweight so this turned out to be a good choice as there was a pleasant amount of kick at baseline.  Thrill seekers may choose the added bump because the tzatziki sauce will further offset the heat.  The pita bread could barely contain everything but it held together, the meat was flavorful/tender, veggies tasted fresh and along with providing a crispy textural element cut through the total richness of the sandwich nicely.  Overall Gyro Cafe was a very pleasant discovery and I was sold upon seeing the vertical rotisserie and relieved that the sandwiches were not prepared completely drowned in tzatziki sauce as most sub par gyro stands are prone to doing when trying to cover up a weak product.  I look forward to carving out more time for a return visit to try some Greek fries done right (fingers crossed) and the cook to order Chicken shawarma."

The gyro meat seemed kind of stale and not juicy and fresh like other places. Also, they don&#39;t give you very much meat and try to cover it up with extra veggies. Also, the guy seemed kind of insulted when I asked for 2 sides of chile sauce. Awkward. Finally, the tables were dirty and the floors were uncleaned. 

Finally finally, I went in here a couple days ago asking politely to use the restroom. They had 2 customers. The girl at the counter said no despite me obviously not being scruffy and despite me asking twice. Rude."

The balls are bigger and the flavor is almost a little Indian because of what looks and tastes like a turmeric addition to the spice mixture. One of my favorite things about this place is being able to substitute hummus for tzatziki. That makes the wrap completely vegan, and provides far more substance to the meal. The spicy addition is just sriracha, which is a little boring, but it works ok. The vegetables are always fresh and crisp inside the wrap. The pita holding it all together is large and fluffy. 

The price (about $8 after tax) is a little more than typical for just a falafel sandwich, but based on the flavor, freshness, and hummus, it is justified and worth it."

For walk-up counter Mediterranean cuisine in Seattle, this place has the best falafel I&#39;ve tried so far (comparing to Aladdin, Shawarma King, and Mediterranean Express-and a couple of joints in near Pioneer square that I forgot the name of).  

I&#39;ve only been there once, but the flavor profile on the falafel sandwich was excellent. 
The falafel itself was crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. It&#39;s not my ideal texture, as what I was used to before moving to Seattle was  a similar taste, but dryer batter inside. 

Also, unlike most east coast falafels, which tend to use tahini, Gyro cafe uses tadziki. It is not a bad mix--quote the contrary--a bit messy (but a good falafel always is...if you&#39;re trying to walk and feed a toddler bites at the same time). 

Either way the sandwich was very good, served on a soft warm Greek-style pita (no internal pocket like big grocery store pita bread).  

I also tried their lamb-beef plate (most similar restaurants typical call a &#34;gyro plate&#34;). The plate was good, with gyro meat being of a predictable style and consistency. Unlike most restaurants the balance of salad/humus to meat rice was a little different. Far smaller meat portion, with a very flavorful tadziki with fresh spicy garlic. The salad was delicious as well. Rice was filled with more flavor than yellow coloring (no coloring, lots of butter and garnished with parsely) - simple and flavorful.

For the cost, some people may complain about the smaller meat portion, but in terms of a healthy meal with good flavor, this place has it--I prefer quality to quantity ALWAYS. 

I was very very disappointed while waiting and looking, hungrily, at a chicken skewer someone else had ordered, lamenting that I did not purchase any tasty-looking-meat-on-a-stick, for myself.

Other notes: Toddler approved. Downside, he ate half my sandwich."

I have been invited back and want to give them another shot.  Leaving the old review up until then--

I simply can&#39;t believe the amount of excellent reviews for Gyro Cafe on Yelp.  Either I somehow showed up at the wrong time - three times - or I&#39;m missing something crucial. 

 I was SO excited to see them open up last year, I can eat endless amounts of baba ganoush and love chicken shawarma, and I live nearby so it was the answer to my prayers.  First time in just after their opening they were out of baba ganoush so I had shawarma which was ok if a little underwhelming.  

Second time in - no baba ganoush, which was all I really wanted.  I ended up getting the garlic fries, which unlike other reviewers have reported as being perfect, were soggy and pretty unappetizing.    

The third time - at their one year anniversary - I decided to give them another chance and we came in for lunch.  A laminated sign at the register told me they were already out of baba ganoush, AND chicken shawarma.  Note: if you have to make a laminated sign for repeated use saying you are out of a menu item - perhaps you should consider making more of it.  I don&#39;t see how a restaurant can be out of a gyro joint staple like this so frequently?  While they did try and sell me something else on the menu we walked out without purchasing anything.

All I wanted was some baba ganoush they managed to fail *three times in a row*.  For a restaurant this is not only an embarrassing  faux pas but a serious blunder.  So the question I have for them is this: what is going to cost you more - making larger batches or losing potential regular customers?  

As much as I hate to lose the dream of a gyro place on 15th it is clear to me that Gyro Cafe is not committed to the highest level of service - a critical failure for a restaurant that expects to stay in business.  I will not be returning."

The girl that I usually see working here is adorable, sweet and recognizes regulars.

I would have given 5 stars, except that on a few occasions I went here and they had closed early. Granted it was 20-30 minutes before close, but because the food only takes 10 minutes (tops) to prepare, I find this pretty unprofessional.

Would very much like a bit more meat and a lot less sauce.  

Falafel- I lived in the Middle East for two years.  This is unlike any falafel I ever had overseas.  It has an odd flavour that I did not care for.  It was honestly among the most unappetizing falafel I&#39;ve had in the western world.

The tzatziki and hummous are home made, yes, as is the baklava but the lamb I have always experienced is dry, and the schawarma is bland. &#34;Spicy&#34; schawarma  which is just added sriracha (who really ever heard of such a thing, schawarma is not meant to be spicy much less doused with sriracha - schawarma is about the marinated juicy meat and little else) which makes no sense in Med food, and the lamb gyro is dressed up with all sorts of random extras (olives, cucumber etc) to disguise the fact that the lamb is dry. Very off the mark. 

The chicken items are a little bit better as the chicken is made to order and isn&#39;t a spinning slab of meat being kept warm by a warm red light, so it is juicier and spiced pretty well. But still is basically chicken in a pita with yogurt sauce.

Also, the rice is just basmati rice with a little parsley in it, and is super sweet. Maybe some people will like it, but again this is just not proper med food.

If you are from the Midwest or the East Coast and are looking for the kind of Arabic/Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food that you are accustomed to, this is not the place.

The restaurant itself is a decent size and allowed me to crack open a book with my meal without a problem. The staff was nice and willing to explain some of the stuff on the menu. 

The only issue I have here is that the price is a bit more on the expensive side for what is really not a large meal. Of coarse, the trade off is that what you do get is delicious.

You will get worse service the closer to closing time it is.  It seems like the people that work here are genuinely friendly - they just want to close early and seemed a bit  frustrated when you come in within a half hour of close.

I&#39;ve eaten here a couple times, and will do so again, just don&#39;t expect a traditional gyro, do get it spicy (covered in sriracha sauce) , and do get the Greek fries, they are quite yummy.  All in all a tasty place, just not the best gyros I&#39;ve ever had."

The decor leaves a little to be desired, but the place is clean and if it keeps the delicious chicken gyros at a reasonable price, I can live with that.

You get a great deal of food for the price and it is fresh.  That is one of the biggest reasons I enjoy it so much.  The owner/chef is dedicated to making sure the ingredients are fresh and you get an excellent meal for the money you are paying.

Was it the total of eight different occasions that I saw bare hands touching ready-to-eat food, when they had just wiped a nose, counted back cash, or come from pockets? Or was it the frozen falafel that I received? Or was it the deserts that were still in the Trader Joe&#39;s packaging that they claimed to the woman in front of me to be &#34;homemade&#39;&#39;?

Let&#39;s just say hands touched lettuce should not count back change and go back to the lettuce. Ick.

And on those days when I don&#39;t have anything in my fridge or pantry, and I really don&#39;t want to deal with Safeway madness, and teriyaki sounds unappealing, Gyro Cafe comes to my rescue. Conveniently located across the street from Group Health (and probably packed to the gills at lunch time), they&#39;re serving up the goods for good prices.

I tend to go for the gyro plate instead of the regular gyro, although the regular gyro is massive and messy and everything it should be. Buuuuut I love rice, and the plate obliges, so that&#39;s just how I roll. The salad is always fresh - romaine, red cabbage, red onion, cucumber, green bell peper, tomato, kalamata olives, feta, oil &amp; vinegar - and the pita bread is always grilled to warm it up. The rice is weirdly tasty and I love mixing in the not-too-garlicky tzatziki, although I know that&#39;s not exactly traditional. The hummus is yummy but the real star is the lamb &amp; beef shawarma. It&#39;s grilled up with some caramelized onions and comes out all crispy and tender, in a plentiful heap, with the option of some Sriracha dumped on top (yes, always do that). The owner is super friendly too - when I walk by, even if I&#39;m not stopping in, he always smiles and waves at me. It does take a little while to get your food, but who cares when it&#39;s fresh and tasty? Gyro Cafe saves my lazy tummy probably once a month or so and always, always makes me happy."

The lady who works the register is incredibly nice and mostly incompetent. I repeated parts of my order multiple times only to watch her write it wrong. I corrected her, and the two things I ordered still both ended up wrong. The other lady working was just straight up rude. I ordered a chicken shwarma and she turned around saying it would take 6 minutes to cook- like it was my fault for ordering chicken and wanted me to just order falafel like she was already cooking. She also told another customer she had no idea where her order was then just went along with her business.

I went yesterday and ordered the Falafel gyro plate. As mentioned in another review, the plate comes with (meat or falafel), salad, hummus, tzatziki, rice (or fries) and pita cut into strips. Unlike the other reviewer, I definitely got an entire pita - I saw the guy cut it in front of me.

Yes, the place still has some kinks to iron out - there were 2 guys in front of me and it took quite a while to get 3 orders out. A lot of the wait seemed to involve deciding how to assemble the food in the to-go containers. They certainly seem very new still - but I&#39;m confident they&#39;ll be able to get a flow going once they&#39;ve got a few more days under their belts.

The food - the salad with apples was fantastic! Really added to the meal. I was worried about the falafel - the outside did not look like it had been in the fryer long enough - but they were plenty warm on the inside. A little dry, but very good. The tzatziki was great, and the baba ganoush (I got instead of hummus) was delicious. It was a TON of food for $7 - the rice was completely unnecessary, I&#39;d rather have added some hummus.

I&#39;m thrilled for another cheap/good food option on the Hill, will definitely be back. I hope they expand their hours, because I tried to go on Sunday and right now they&#39;re only open Mon-Fri during the day."

I&#39;ll admit there are a few kinks. Sometimes they&#39;re out of things. Sometimes there&#39;s a long line and they don&#39;t have enough people to handle the flow. But the store opened one week ago. What do you people expect?"

I don&#39;t want to rag on this place, but they really need to get their shit together.

I have never been in a restaurant where every single customer was unhappy because of the service.  When I went up to order, I asked the cashier if they were having difficulties, and she said she was going to call a team meeting later in the day to address all the issues they had.  After I ordered, I stepped back to wait for my food, and that is when I saw what she was complaining about

One guy demanded a refund because his food never came out.  The cook said he called his name and pulled the sandwich out of the garbage can to prove to the angry customer that he had made it...  The woman after that got her falafel platter and said that she had been mislead as to what came with the platter.    The guy after that had a pained look on his face when he took his food...I think he just gave up.

When I got my food and opened the container it was also not what I was expecting.  I ordered a gyro plate, which I assumed consisted of a gyro, salad, fries and hummus (like the menu says).  But what I got was meat shavings, and then pita that is cut into triangles.  I got four slices of pita, which is roughly equivalent to  1/2 of a pita.  That pissed me off because I really like pita, and now I understand why that lady was upset about her falafel platter.

With complaints aside, the food was pretty tasty.  I really enjoyed the gyro meat.  And the salad that came with the plate had apples with it, which I think is a nice touch.  The fries were meh, next time I will try the rice.

 Conclusion:  Much promise, but much to be desired.  I hope they fix the kinks because a tasty and reasonably priced gyro place on 15th would be fucking sweet."

Loud chatty atmosphere. Tiny waiting area. They don&#39;t tell you upfront but you need to write your name on a paper list on the end of the wall divider.

Complimentary miso soup and noodle salad. Miso has spinach in it instead of seaweed. 

Seaweed salad: sesame flavored with hint of sweet vinegar. Very tasty compared to other places that have that &#34;fishy&#34; taste.

Salmon Philly Maki: man do they load up on that salmon! It&#39;s super filling just by itself!

Combo B: chicken karaage was not very flavored and looked a lot different than what I am used to--it&#39;s almost white. Gyoza very moist but had good flavor. Potato croquette was very good--crunchy on outside and very soft on inside."

I have eaten sushi in many different cities including NYC (where I am from), and Hawaii (where I lived for 7 years). On top of those places, my husband has also eaten sushi in Japan. We sat at the bar and were taken care of in such an amazing manner by the sushi chef that it is probably the only sushi place my husband and I will ever eat at while in Seattle. 

On top of the sushi we ordered, the chef gave of fairly large samples of the things he was preparing for other customers. The quality of the fish was outstanding. I, personally have never eaten sushi that good. My husband said it rivaled Japan. Bravo Toyoda!"

But... 

  First the service here is terrible. I could train a preschool class to run this Resturant with more efficiently, I could then train the same group of children to prepare better sushi. 
   Look,  at one point I am sure these people cared about what they were doing. But they have no pride in what they do anymore, and I believe it takes pride to make good sushi. Everything is rushed, there is no attention to detail. They don&#39;t even try to be friendly anymore, they want you in an out as fast as possible. I have been here 4 times in the last few months and on every occasion there was a mistake made (wrong items sent, incorrect bill, no water, order never showed). This place is a fiasco and the food is not great, it&#39;s ok. What I believe happened here is there reputation exceeds there product and as there popularity increased the quality decreased and this is partially do to the location, there simply is no other sushi to be found in the lake city area. And It&#39;s a shame because eating sushi should be an experience and you expect things to be clean and orderly. 
      And this brings me to my biggest issue with Toyota Sushi it is deplorably dirty from there prep area to the bathroom to the walls and floors. Sanitation is extremely important when dealing with raw foods and there is nothing sanitary about Toyota. They store there fish uncovered in a glass cooler on the bar top, the condensation from the copper cooling coils above said fish drips down onto the raw product, this is gross and taints the flavor of the food. Again there is no pride and no honor in what they do here. People who rate this Toyota highly have never been to a good sushi Restaurant. A good test for gauging the quality of any Japanese restaurant is to order a bowl of rice and if the rice is anything but perfect the entire menu will be at the same level of disparity. The rice here suuuuuuuuucks...
       I&#39;m not a smart person as you can tell by my spelling and gramer, but if there is one thing I know it&#39;s good sushi and random animal facts. So save your money and go somewhere else."

As soon as you walk in, remember to take a whiff of the air. It smells like sushi chefs preparing rice, soup, sushi and everything wonderful. 

What appealed to me was that it was family run. Towards the end, their personal chatters started to flow. Hilarious and equally enjoyable. But do not be fooled, these folks take their business seriously.

The sushi was excellent, presentation was beautiful, service was timely and prompt, and everyone was very courteous. 

Good to know:
- they serve you miso soup and some sort of house salad when you sit down.
- they close on weekdays by 8:30 pm.
- more parking available behind the restaurant."

1)  Hygiene.  We came here on a Wednesday night, 7pm.  The place was busy but not overwhelmingly so, and the 1st thing we noticed was an abundance of flies in the main dining area.  Not just 1 or 2, but a swarm.  Gross.  Not the big horseflies, but regular sized flies as well as a few fruit flies thrown in for good measure.  On top of that, my sushi was served onto a well worn traditional wooden dish (?oak), dripping wet.  Wonder what the bacteria count on that was...

2)  Overcharged.  This has happened at least 2x I&#39;ve been there (I&#39;ve been here at least ~12x over the years).  Caught it one time; this most recent time, I didn&#39;t even bother as I was in a rush to get out of here with my crabby wife and 4 yr old.  DOUBLE check your bill.

Now, the sushi itself is fine, and the chefs are known to be generous with some cuts and freebies, but I think Toyoda&#39;s has become too busy for their own good.  My sushi this night was made fairly sloppy (don&#39;t expect a tight pack on your rolls).  The service can be hit or miss (we weren&#39;t served any tea or water until our food arrived).  And my wife&#39;s Veggie udon dish was overly sweet, with the broth resembling water-downed teriyaki...

Until Toyoda&#39;s cleans up it&#39;s act (literally), I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be paying a return visit..."

My friend&#39;s chicken katsu looked a bit dry, but the gyoza and udon were great. I&#39;ll probably get the udon and a side meat the next time I come back. 

Get the small sushi over the regular sushi, if you&#39;re torn. The difference in serving size was only a couple pieces. 

Overall, very friendly and attentive staff and we&#39;ll-prepared food. We&#39;ll definitely be back!"

I know that when I go out I&#39;m looking for the total experience, and my girlfriend raved about this place so I was excited to try it... Let me start by saying, the food is FANTASTIC... You know that feeling, when you stick a piece of sushi in your mouth and you just KNOW you&#39;re tasting quality? Well, Toyoda nails it... I had a bit of a spider roll, spicy tuna, California and the rainbow... the Rainbow roll was incredible... the edamame may have been cooked a little long, but it wasn&#39;t bad and the miso soup was great as well... 

Now I know what you&#39;re wondering... &#34;Mousa, if the sushi was great and you are raving about it why on Earth are you only giving three stars?&#34;

I&#39;m glad you asked... here&#39;s the thing... service matters too... and I understand that sh!t happens... I get that people call out and restaurants can be short handed... I served tables for four years in my life at different levels of places and I get all this... and the distinction I&#39;ll also make is that NO one at Toyoda was at any point rude or dismissive... they were just very busy and very out manned in terms of server to table ratio... the service was just slow... it was that feeling you get watching a car stuck in the mud spin wheels and get nowhere... sometimes, as a server you have to slow down, just work one thing at a time and know that in a lot of instances people will understand... 

but rushing around and slinging drinks and food, putting things down and not doing a follow up, etc is not how anyone wants to be treated... one of the gentleman behind the bar explained what the issue was and was very friendly and personable... 

at the end, when asked for a split check the waitress responded with, &#34;well you didn&#39;t tell me at the beginning&#34;... ok, granted, and we should have... but I&#39;m also aware that at a bar setting, each seat should be treated individually so that if asked, its easy to do... its the little things... I&#39;m going to try this place again, because the sushi was that good... and the ambiance, for being small and simple was REALLY cool... it says something that people are willing to wait as long as they do and did last night... 

but I really hope that a fully staffed server crew changes the way things are, because they have some work to do in the service department..."

1. We were sort of greeted at walk in, yet not told that we had to sign our name on a sheet to be added to wait list (and noticed this when we saw another regular doing so).
2. When seats finally opened for our group of 4 to sit, we sat at the bar.  It took about 12 minutes to be asked for any drinks or any starters (let&#39;s not talk about how long it came for those items to arrive)
3. The staff, while very kind, gave off an extremely chaotic vibe as they raced the floor to help the customers.  Normally, speedy service is a good thing.  This team didn&#39;t pull it off well at all and their rushed madness permeated the restaurant and seemed to have quite a few people on edge.  More importantly it impacted the quality and execution of their service...
4. After having waited an additional 10 - 15 minutes for food orders, the team came to ask what we&#39;d like and *as we were answering*, we were told to hold on while they took our menus to give to another table. Really?!
5. One person in our group ordered a sushi roll that had yet to be delivered and we asked about it as our group was finishing our meal (offering our own rolls to the friend whose roll hadn&#39;t arrived). We were told it was coming, and 10 minutes later then had to ask about it again, where it seemed someone realized it had been sitting there unaccounted for, and brought it to our table finally. So he got to eat while the rest of our group sat with full stomachs. 
6. When the hand-written bill came out, before even seeing it we asked if it could be split. We were told that we hadn&#39;t asked in the beginning, so it couldn&#39;t be. Really? We each placed our own order, we&#39;re sitting at the bar where normally people order and pay individually... surely a split-bill should be a common request?  So we take the bill, and realize it is completely illegible. Completely.  I made the decision to walk up to the woman and let her know that we had such a disappointing experience, and having to split a bill that we can&#39;t even differentiate one item from the next was the last straw.  She kindly took it and split the costs for us so we could pay.  


The whole night the team (with the exception of the chefs) operated so inefficiently you would have thought that Toyoda had just opened for their first day. I was so disappointed and regretted my decision in recommending this place to my friends."

Got here around 6:45 on a Sunday, restaurant is pretty small and there were about 3 tables open but we ended up waiting at least 5-10 min to get seated. Once seated, we asked for hot tea to drink. We were ready to order so a young busboy sent over a waitress. We ordered the calamari app, sashimi dinner, and bowl of rice to share for two people.  The bus boys were also setting tables, bringing out soup/salads and drinks.  We got complimentary miso soup. It was ok, no seaweed in it, they used some other veggie, guessing spinach.  Finish the soup and buser comes to take the bowls, says he&#39;ll bring out salad which was noodles covered in a mayo-type dressing. I had one small piece of cucumber in it so not sure how this is a salad.  This was a bit hard to eat with no drink. We&#39;re still waiting for our tea. I ask the bus boy again for tea and water.  We&#39;re probably 20 min into dining and we still haven&#39;t gotten drinks or calamari.  At this point, I&#39;m sure the boy has forgotten our drinks because he&#39;s running around doing other stuff so ask another buser for tea, he says its coming. Finally we get our drinks but still no food. Waitress brings over a couple of pieces of agedashi tofu for us to snack on as we continue to wait for our food. Tofu was crispy but wasn&#39;t hot, so again, just OK. 

Close to 40 min in, waitress brings our sashimi dinner out.  She realizes that we never got our calamari and asks if we still want it. Do we still want the jowl of rice we ordered? Nope to both, who knows when they&#39;ll come out. As for the food we got, this was supposed to be a $50 platter of fish, I was underwhelmed when I saw it. All of the fish fit on a typical dinner plate. First impression was not great.  It included: scallop, clam, shrimp, yellowtail, snapper, salmon, tuna, some white fish, mackerel.  Knife skills were just bad. The cuts were thin and uneven and the salmon looked completely butchered. We found little chunks of fish, not uniform at all. Why even put this on the plate? Throw it in the poke. It looked like it was a bunch if leftover cuts that were sliced up and put on a plate.  The white fish was too cold like they didn&#39;t thaw it completely. I had once piece of tuna that was mushy and left a slimy feel in my mouth. This was not good. The salmon probably tasted the best but the pieces were so butchered.  I&#39;m not a sushi snob but I&#39;ve seen good sashimi and this was not it.  Also, there were several slices of lemon around the mackerel and snapper. The fish tasted strongly of lemon, maybe this was to cover the fishy taste?

Waitress acknowledged the long wait for food and miss on appetizer order and offered us free ice cream for dessert. We got one order if green tea ice cream.  Flavor was good but texture was not, too many ice crystals in it.   

Overall, food wasn&#39;t very good and service was disorganized.  We won&#39;t be back."

Helen Toyoda is one of the most gracious, elegant women I&#39;ve EVER encountered. Be prepared to wait and enjoy yourself.

The portions were good, but over-priced. For example, I got nine pieces of Nigiri and 6 roll pieces for $28. 

If money isn&#39;t an issue for you, I&#39;d recommend Toyoda&#39;s for a great all-around Japanese food experience. But if you want more value out of your dollar, I definitely recommend Musashi&#39;s -- same or better quality, and more sushi for less money."

Anyway, it was a busy Sunday night.  We showed up close to 7:30 and our party was 5 deep, and we wanted to sit at the sushi bar, unfortunately it was not in our cards last night.  So about 60% of our party are regulars here, the owners knew one by name, and recognized the others.  And that&#39;s where the awesome journey begins.  We ordered a smorgasboard of goodies: agedashi tofu. gomae, gyoza, hamachi kama (both baked and fried, fried was compliments of the owners), tako salad, tons of sushi (tamago, scallop, tuna, mackarel, ikura, etc... sadly they were out of uni), AND lots of sake and beer!  We also unexpectedly received some spicy tuna, toro, mackarel, scallop, tuna sashimi!

WE WERE STUFFED!  Seriously, we should have been rolled out of that place!  AND the staff and the owners make you feel like you&#39;ve come home.  They were super personable, quite generous, and the food was DELICIOUS and fresh!

We are definitely fans of this awesome little place!

They gave everyone at the table miso soup and a creamy noodle dish flavored with onion, imitation crab, and a few other ingredients. Both were a great start to an even better meal. My husband and I shared a very generous and large sashimi dinner platter with really fresh fishes including tuna, salmon, red snapper, scallop, surf clam, octopus, shrimp, and mackerel. The surf clam and octopus were very tender and the tuna was just wonderful. My mom had the tempura and chicken teriyaki combo dinner that was equally delicious. The chicken was very flavorful without being doused in sauce and the tempura (an assortment of vegetables and shrimp) was cooked perfectly. We also had the tempura maki, california maki, and scallop maki. The tempura maki was my favorite but the california maki was a close second. The spicy scallop maki was actually too spicy and I didn&#39;t like it very much even though the scallop inside was nice and fresh. Overall, servers were very attentive and the environment felt like a local, family hangout. I would recommend it to anyone.

PROs:
1) Sushi is the bomb. Period. Always fresh, always tasty. I have never had a bad meal here ever. The only thing I had that I didn&#39;t like was Uni, but that&#39;s my own baggage (not a fan of the texture!)
2) Complimentary stuff. When the chef is in a good mood, don&#39;t be surprised if you have a hot sake or some appetizers show up at your table.
3) Atmosphere. While a bit intimate, it&#39;s got good vibes and is always fun to eat at.

CONs:
1) Sanitation. Flys. Oh man the flys. Obviously worse in the summer, this place could work on dealing with the flying buggers.
2) Temperature. The place tends to be a bit cold during the winter. If you get a chance, make sure you&#39;re next to one of the heaters.


Overall, great place to eat, just needs a few adjustments and it would be the bomb.com. :)"

Unfortunately due to the bad experience from last two visits I have to take Toyoda off my favorite sushi list for the time being. We went there last week for dinner and it was such an unpleasant experience we all ended up losing our appetites. 
1. Some of us ordered sushi, and some cooked items from the kitchen. The arrival time of these two different types of foods is hugely different. Why can&#39;t they coordinate a bit so all of the foods from the table arrive at about the same time? I am talking about 15 minutes difference here! 
2. Sanity issues, LOTS of fruit flies flying around. We changed our table once because they were just swarming around at the first table. It didn&#39;t get much better after we switched to a different table. I overheard the waitress answering to another party at a different table about why there are so many flies. She said that they serve certain kind of fish that attracts the flies. How come you don&#39;t see this problem at other sushi places? Does that mean the fly problem is even worst in the kitchen? We also found a piece of hair in the tempura which is simply disgusting.
3. Waitress didn&#39;t give honest estimate of the meal size. When my 12 years old wanted to order a large katsudon, I asked the waitress if that is too much for a 12 years old. She said it won&#39;t be but when it came it was even too much for my husband who is a big eater. 
I used to love to come to Toyoda for quality sushi and pleasant dining experience, but lately I feel they have changed the way they run the business. A lot less wait staff therefore a lot less quality services compared to the past. I truly hope they will work on improving how they run the business since their sushi is still very good quality."

This restaurant is located in Lake City downtown. I know, Lake City, right? I didn&#39;t think I would ever go there, just because of the name. But, again, the food is surprisingly good and the fish is fresh. Of course, there&#39;s parking. 

Among friends and I, we ordered some sushi and tempera. After we got seated, we were served with complimentary miso soup and noodle salad. All of us enjoyed the soup. Personally, I wasn&#39;t a fan of the noodle salad. But, it was a good starter. All the dishes had good taste and good presentation. Fish we had was very fresh. There wasn&#39;t bone in the fish like I found in the other place. This is the profession right here! 

We were there shortly after 5PM. As soon as we came, the place was filled with customers in 20 mins. The young server might not be very experienced, but with some guidance from the senior server, she was able help us. 

I will definitely come back here and sit on the sushi bar for more traditional food one of those days."

It probably has the best sushi in town, and they&#39;re able to maintain a small mom-and-pop feel. Although the menu is a bit pricey, your meal does include free soup and noodle appetizer, which could easily add five dollars to any other meal anywhere else. The staff is really friendly, and the owners are there waiting on tables just like everyone else in the restaurant. 

I recently went there for a friend&#39;s birthday, and he had spoken to   the owner on Facebook and she said &#34;we&#39;ll see you tonight.&#34; She had our table ready to go when we arrived. That&#39;s friendly service you won&#39;t get at a big corporate restaurant. If you&#39;re not friends with them on Facebook, you can just come in and put your name in on a sheet of paper. The front area is usually packed with people waiting for a table, since the restaurant seats about 50 people total. 

The thing I usually get is the Regular plate (just ask for &#34;the regular&#34;). It includes about 10 or 12 different types of nigiri and includes an order of spicy tuna roll. The quality of the fish is fantastic. It&#39;s among the best I&#39;ve had in Seattle.

He actually gave us some small samples of other rolls and sashimi without charging us. Everything was really delicious! I wanted to give them 5 stars but their waitresses were a bit too slow and forgetful. We had to wait for the appetizers more than 35 minutes when their tables were not even half filled. It is not a high end restaurant and the service is not so great. However, the owner works very hard and treats customers with great service that I still have to give them at least 4 star review.

Dislikes: huge price increase, occasionally partially frozen sushi, sloppy cuts (weird bits of cartilage, bone, skin), uncomfortable seating, heaters/air conditioners wedged between chairs like sitting in a shack, mis-orders, non-itemized billing, dated decor, pictures of friends vacations posted all over the walls, filthy bathroom, flying insects in your face, smaller portions. 

Seriously, this used to be the place to stuff yourself on cheap sushi. They are not a premier sushi restaurant in Seattle, and anybody who thinks otherwise hasn&#39;t been around. 

For the same price there are dozens of professional sushi restaurants that are clean, comfortable, insect-free, with a pleasing ambience."

I&#39;ve been meaning to check it out and I finally had a chance this week.  It can be a long wait even on a weeknight due to the popularity of this place.  I went there early-ish based on some tips in the reviews and I still had to wait at least 30 minutes for a spot to open up on the bar.  

Otherwise, I had a really nice sushi experience.  I saw that most of the people seated at the sushi bar were regulars or have been in before. Lots of nice banter between the sushi chef and the customers.  The sushi and sashimi I ordered was fresh and very good for a neighborhood type of place. It&#39;s not Nishino&#39;s or Shiro&#39;s, it&#39;s more neighborhoody and friendly like some of the sushi spots in Wallingford. I&#39;m forgetting the names, but you can put Toyoda in that category.   I would definitely go again when I&#39;m in the area and craving sushi.  As other people have mentioned, the place could use a little updating to give it some shine, but I think the regulars probably like the homey and familiar feel of this place."

This is a great place to eat by yourself or with maybe 3 friends. Not a lot of seating space, but it gives a very cozy feeling. The staff and very welcoming and will bring you many extra side dishes (especially if you&#39;re sitting at the bar). Their black cod is absolutely delicious and although everything is a bit expensive, they&#39;re definitely worth it. 
If you call them for pick up, it takes about half an hour and everything is prepared and beautiful as if they&#39;re still on the plates.
Only nitpick is that their limited seating creates a long waiting line.

sushi/sashimi- fresh. Usually, when you order a small sashimi plate, it&#39;s small. Here, i was pleasantly surprised at the quantity. You get the usual - salmon, 2different kind of tuna, scallop, octopus, yellow tail, mackerel and one more(cant remember). Def worth $30.

1) the sashimi came out half frozen - the insides were so ice cold that we had to let it sit and thaw a little. Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever been to a sushi restaurant where this has happened. 

2) The bathroom was absolutely disgusting. And for a Japanese restaurant that supposedly specializes in making sushi?Anyone should know this is beyond unacceptable.

3) TERRIBLE service. Waitresses seemed to be all over the place, didn&#39;t know which table needed what. One waitress tried to take our plate away when we still had a couple pieces of sashimi left on the plate, albeit it was sitting in a puddle of condensation after thawing.

Sure this place could pass as a cute neighborhood joint to get your less-than-mediocre sushi fix. But save your time and money and don&#39;t bother getting caught up in the online review hype. Seattle has much better places to enjoy fine, quality sushi in cleaner and appetizing environments."

I was in search for the best sushi in Seattle and I believe I have found it! I came here to check out the fish quality and sushi technique and traveling to Japan twice a year this is as authentic as you can get. Large pieces and the only way the fish could be any fresher is if it were still alive.

Dont come here if your looking for a deep fried las vegas roll or a Seattle roll. These are great college and drunken night rolls. If you have a complex palate and are looking for quality then Toyoda sushi is the place. Its one of those hole in the wall places that you would pass on by if you didnt know it was there.

The complimentary miso soup is average and the cold noodles are awful - way too much mayo. Really bad way to start out the meal and the experience at the restaurant. 

We got a bunch of sushi, which was so-so in price, compared to other similar places. One person in our party had the udon noodle soup with chicken. So the lady - the owner with the last name Toyoda (50s ish) we later find out - brings out the bowl of soup - just has noodles and broth in it, nothing else and very little flavor We think we may have ordered incorrectly so we just deal with it. Then 10 minutes later the owner brings out a plate of overcooked chicken, shredded lettuce and 2 slices of orange. We said to the waitress/owner - &#34;Does this go with the soup?&#34; She said &#34;Yes&#34; then we said &#34;but it came out about minutes later.&#34; She gave us a very sour face and walked off, like &#34;you non-educated Toyoda patrons,&#34; extremely demeaning. 

She never came back to our table again, after being so cheery before the udon noodle soup incident. She sent a young waitress to our table with the bill who spoke very little English. The owner&#39;s demeanor completely changed. And guess how much the soup was - $19.99!! We took the burned chicken home and put it on rice and it was not great so we threw it away. We basically gave them $20 for free. 

What came across was that if you ask anything, you are chastised, just like in Seinfeld on the &#34;Soup Nazi&#34; episode. So don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t complain, stay quiet and just eat and be happy you got a table. We were not happy and won&#39;t go back. I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t miss us or care about a few measly customers anyway.

And get this, the owner, who was our waitress, puts her real estate card in the bill holder, trying to get some biz.. It is taped in there. A bit odd."

We got the regular sashimi plate and veggie tempura roll and the veggie make roll.

The sashimi was very good. Probably fresher than the wallingford places. The veggie rolls were not very good. The tempura took a long time to come out which is understandable. However shima does a better veggie tempura. The plum sauce in the veggie maki roll overpowered everything else. Would recommend ! However not a place for vegetarians. Took out stars for lack of good veggie options and more pricey than shima, kisaku and musashi

I waited for the teriaki instead, saw a group of guys come in after we received our sashimi, and they began getting their food after 15 minutes, even though we were still waiting for the teriyaki.

I told her to cancel it, she offered free dessert, but i needed real food. she gave me a lil bit  of teriaki for free. Any way the bill was very high, and i was very hungry. 

The sushi seems fresh, but i am not a sushi expert...

Doubt i will be coming back, it is clear you have to be a regular to get good service... the owner seems to have fun with the regulars tho."

Food: The chef must have caught the damn tuna/salmon/eels that day and let &#39;em keep swimming until it was time to be used!  Everything was incredibly fresh!  

Service: Good even though the line was out the door with a lot of fire hazard involved.  We sat at the bar right by the door and got to watch one of the chefs AKA artists at work.  He peeled a daikon with only his hand and his knife and shredded it while taking orders over our heads, and kept our tab straight while we ordered in pieces.  To top all of that, we watched him make take away orders with such efficiency...goodness."

I was disappointed both times (went back the second time to make sure it wasn&#39;t me). There was a huge swarm of fruit flies that hovered over our dishes  and pretty much most of the restaurant and the sushi rolls showed up already falling apart. The fish really isn&#39;t that fresh and really, the restaurant can use a top to down deep scrub. I am unsure why the rating is so high. Plus, they are extremely under staffed. This place is nothing compared to Chiso, Nishino, or Shiro&#39;s, which are 4 or higher stars in my book. Did it change ownership or something? Cuz, it really does not live up to its reputation.

I will not waste money there again."

Great quality sushi. Definitely sit at the bar and watch the masters at work. The seaweed and squid salads are tasty and worth trying (i never expected to say that).

The service was slow - there was only one server and the place was slammed. So we had time to chat, but we were hungry too!

The meal starts with a complimentary bowl of udon noodles in some sort of mayonnaise sauce.  It was not anything I had tried before, but pretty good.  The sushi was just awesome.  My husband ordered a roll that came out looking great and tasting even better.  I ordered my favorite mackerel nigri and it was the best I&#39;ve ever had.

Service was decent didn&#39;t experience anything out of the ordinary. Complimentary miso and imitation crab and noodle salad swimming in a bland mayo dressing were dropped off right away. Drinks followed shortly after that. It was dinner time so it was starting to get packed right as we sat down. 

 Now down to the bizness! Ordered appetizers and sushi for the two. Had the calamari, gyoza, mushrooms in rice vinegar and soft shell crab for apps. The gyoza and soft shell crab proved to be the winners in this category but nothing super spectacular. Gyoza had the usual pork  filling and the soft shell crab had good flavor. Sadly, the other items were bland. And I love me some calamari so when the batter is bland I get sad. 

We also ordered saba, kampanchi, hamachi nigiri and the smoked salmon philly roll. I love saba and tuna. The fish was fresh but there were times I felt like the rice wasn&#39;t proportionate to the size of this fish...not sure how to describe this. And there were times where the wasabi punched me in the nose and times when I couldn&#39;t taste the wasabi at all. I don&#39;t mind a lot of wasabi on sushi but I felt that something was off.  Maybe I should have gotten the sashimi dinner that the other reviewers were raving about?  The smoke salmon cream cheese roll was tasty but kinda rich so I could only eat a few pieces. Regardless, on a scale from 1-10 (with 10 being melt in your mouth awesomeness) Toyoda&#39;s sushi was around 6.5. 

The highlight of the night was the blueberry tempura ice cream. It&#39;s pretty big for two people. It tastes like blueberry cake covered with a light tempura crust with a happy vanilla center. You could really taste the blueberries. 

Hubby was disappointed but I still want to come back and give this place another try and to get that tempura ice cream."

I heard great things about Toyoda and was told by friends that the food wouldn&#39;t be expensive. But when I flipped through the menu and saw two pieces of nigiri for $5-$10, that was not expected! Looking for a better deal, my companion and I ordered the edamame and the assorted sushi plate (eight pieces of nigiri with six rolls, chef&#39;s choice, about $30). The edamame was perfect and the sushi came out to be ten nigiri with six large rolls! Everything was delicious; we had clam, albacore, yellowtail, salmon, prawn, scallop, eel, tuna, and fatty tuna! I was shocked by the variety and quality. It was also great to see that other people&#39;s orders varied; chef&#39;s choice really meant chef&#39;s choice!

I went here knowing it was one of the only Japanese restaurants in Lake City/Shoreline area. Upon arrival half of the restaurant was full.

Unfortunately, the food and service lacked the refinement to make the price worthwhile.  There were a lot of fruit flies attacking our food. The sake list is short and servers didn&#39;t know sake.  The $20 terikayki was average.

We sat down and we were greeted quickly by most likely the owner. She was very nice and took our order without any problems. Soon after that they placed Meso soup and some sort of mayo infused salad. Even though the salad scared me I still took one bite to say I tried it..... yep! It&#39;s Mayo!  

Here&#39;s where is all went right. The sushi was brought out and I was happy with the beautiful presentation. It all looked great and both my friend and I were hungry. We ate it all but two bites.

The sushi was pretty good though I&#39;ll have to say. My roommate and I ordered a caterpillar roll which was a good size along with a salmon and tuna roll. It was quite filling but I was just so surprised at how expensive the other items were.

Everyone gets miso soup and a bowl of mayo-udon and crab meat. I really liked the crab meat but the udon was pretty odd and the soup was somewhat tasteless.

The restaurant was really busy and supposedly, is always crackin&#39; during the dinner time. But I&#39;m confused because I thought it was very mediocre, service is friendly but kind of slow. There are flies flying around which was really nasty... I probably won&#39;t be coming back."

The downside to this place is that it&#39;s very small and gets very stuffy when busy, which is almost all the time. I&#39;ve also noticed that sometimes the salmon sashimi isn&#39;t always the freshest. Service also isn&#39;t always the best.

I ordered the tempura udon and yellow tail nigiri. According to their Grubhub listing, the expected delivery time was 60-70mins...makes sense for this type of restaurant so I wasn&#39;t all that concerned. I had them delivery to me at work and since the food hadn&#39;t arrived by the time I was closing my store, I called the restaurant to ask them to have the delivery driver call me when they arrived. The person I spoke with told me that my food had been ready for about 45mins and the driver from Grubhub hadn&#39;t even arrived to pick it up. I called Grubhub who told me that the driver was running about 10mins late due to traffic and assured me my food would be there within 15min.

15min go by...then another 15min. I finally got a text message from Grubhub saying my food had finally been picked up and was on its way. Another 15mins go by....then another 15mins. Finally, 2 1/12hrs after I ordered, my food arrived. The driver didn&#39;t even give a reason why my food was so late, as this was obviously not the restaurant&#39;s fault. After all this, Grubhub had the balls to demand that tip the driver at least $2, which I strongly feel in this case he didn&#39;t deserve. 

The udon was cold and mushy after sitting in the broth for nearly 2hrs, and the tempura was cold and soggy. The nigiri was not only warm, the fish was partially cooked from being kept together with the once hot tempura udon and delivered in a heated bag. Needless to say the whole order was ruined by the time it got to me. I managed to salvage the tempura by reheating it in my oven at home, but the udon noodles where gross and the nigiri inedible due having been unrefrigerated for so long. I feel like if I had eaten at the restaurant, my meal would have been pretty decent for the price but using delivery I pretty much wasted $20.

I will definitely be giving the restaurant itself a second chance, but Grubhub has lost my business due to their gross negligence. I hope if the owners/GM of Mejari sees this, they will reconsider using Grubhub as a delivery service since they don&#39;t seem to care about ensuring the quality of the food they are delivering or representing the restaurants in a positive light to their customers."

the 2 fish sushi were fresh but the rest were tempura type, which would take a few minutes to actual deep-fry tempura roll if they have any pride in their food. Rice was gummy for the most part. Want to like this restaurant but it is hard.

We had been drinking at Octopus Bar and hadn&#39;t eaten dinner yet, a quick Yelp and this sushi spot came up plus they had a late night happy hour that starts at 10:00 pm. A quick history of the place, coming from a Wallingford native, was that it used to be a Greek place for lunch and a sushi spot for dinner. He hadn&#39;t been to the restaurant since it became all Japanese and was confused if they served Greek or not. They do not serve Greek lol. 

Great deals here, best of them is the 3 rolls for $20. We got a variety of rolls and they were decent for the price! We also ordered chicken karagee, but I have had better. HH price was $5. The others in our group had sashimi, more rolls, tempura and everyone seemed to enjoy their food as well. 

If I ever crave a ton of sushi for a cheap price, I would totally come here!"

They have their 3 rolls for $20 deal every day! Not just basic rolls but chef special rolls with generous sizes of sashimi. My inner sushi lover was freaking out. HOW MUCH BETTER CAN IT GET? I got the Yummy, Furious, and salmon King roll.

The Yummy roll was a bit too charred for my liking. The shrimp tasted a little burnt. It was good but I&#39;ll opt for another roll if I get the chance to visit again! 

Salmon King was decent with decent slices of Salmon for the price.

As for the Furious.. this roll was amazing! The habanero sauce gave such a nice kick of spice. Wasn&#39;t expecting a combo of citrus and heat. Would order again and pay full price too. 

Did I mention they give free complimentary miso soup? This place is awesome. Can&#39;t wait to go back and try their happy hour menu! 

Only thing I didn&#39;t like is their window booths were a bit uncomfortable. Table was bolted to the floor and booths were way too close to the table and they were blasting EDM. I like Bro Safari but we&#39;re at a restaurant.. Not a rave. More appropriate music next time?"

Is how I answer when anyone asks if we should go here for dinner! Unique sushi rolls and great service make this spot a must visit. At 3 rolls for $20, you can have a delicious meal here for two at $10 each! We came for Happy hour and had the brie cheese tempura -- this was incredible! I haven&#39;t ever had a fried brie and this was tops. The mix of savory and sweet, and smooth/creamy/crunchy all blended together was unique and pleasing. The raspberry dipping sauce was just the right touch to finish off this incredible appetizer. 

For sushi, we had the 12th Man (represent!), the Latin Lover (spicy! ;-), and the Tres Amigos (so good!). Unsure if this would be enough food when ordering, we quickly realized we had ordered too much when it arrived! Each roll contained about 8 pieces and tasted amazing. The quality of the fish was fresh and tender. Everything was better than we could have expected. 

Service here was also very good. Our server was super attentive and friendly. She helped us make decisions as we were looking at the menu and also let us split up our bill into happy hour and non-hh so we could still use a Groupon we had purchased. 

I am eager to come back here for brunch (so many good options!) and more dinners! There are many other items I wanted to try so I plan on coming here the next time I am craving sushi!"

We saw a Groupon for here and decided to check it out and as not the biggest sushi fans we were blown away. 
We arrived at 6:40 and happy hour is till 7, our waitress informed us the Groupon wasn&#39;t good for HH so we could do two separate checks. Both regular and HH menu was plentiful and very unique. For example, the Aztec Roll with BBQ eel, fresh snow crab, avocado, cream cheese, spicy teriyaki aioli sauce &amp; garnished with PICO DE GALLO. Everything we ordered was delicious, I would recommend the Ginger Chicken &amp; Broccoli as well and the Skinned Salmon Roll.

It describes the combination of multiple cuisines, one of which being Asian, in a way that totally works. As of late it means trendy Asian restaurants that think they can charge whatever that want. Mejari GETS asian fusion. The restaurant is run by Mexicans and they incorporate their flavor into Japanese food when they can. 

The name of this place describes it all: Me for Mexican, Ja for Japanese, and Ri for ameRIcan. They serve amazing sushi and bento boxes, and they also do sophisticated salads and appetizers. 

They gave us some amazing miso soup on the house. We were impressed with how delicious it was, so full of mushrooms too. Then before the food came out they brought us my favorite sushi free of charge: seared salmon!! The fusion in this case involved some Mexican tang. The salmon was placed on rice and then seared with the torch, then drizzled with lime and topped with pico de gallo. And it TOTALLY worked!!!!!! 

Our sushi rolls came and they were all delicious, having just enough rice to hold everything together. Most sushi places pile on the rice. We got the shrimp tempura roll, Seattle roll, and California roll. My wife hates sushi and she went crazy for them all, until she found out there was raw salmon in the Seattle roll of course. 

We loved the private parking lot behind the restaurant. That&#39;s hard to come by in Wallingford!"

Late at night, you can get three sushi rolls for $20.They brought us complimentary edamame and some cucumber rolls. The staff are super friendly and polite.
The cucumber roll was definitely not the best, but I loved the gesture. 
The sushi was nicely wrapped, but something about it tasted a little bit off to me, cannot point my finger to anything, but there was something... Maybe it was the fish, it did not taste fresh. I did not finish what I ordered, which is quite a rarity for me at a sushi joint :).

My wife and I were looking for a great sushi place in Seattle.  We&#39;ve heard a lot about some of the others like Umi Sake, Momiji, Japonessa, etc. but didn&#39;t want to spend an exorbitant amount.  After perusing Yelp, our search led us to Mejari, and boy are we glad it did.

We happened to land here during happy hour.  There&#39;s a roll menu, a normal menu, and a happy hour menu.  On the roll menu, they have a list of rolls that you can order 3 for $20.  We did that along with a few items from the HH menu.  We also received complimentary edamame.  The rolls were absolutely magnificent and a decent mix of options.  We had the Yummy, The Furious, and the Aztec.  The Yummy was so good with a charred top.  The Furious was big and full of fish reflecting a typical sushi roll.  The Aztec was fried but not overly battered and really delicious.  All of the rolls were perfectly sized as well.

Here&#39;s the kicker:  Of all those other killer sushi places in Seattle, according to the menus, the sushi chefs at Mejari started them!

The most memorable thing about this place is that it is a huuuuuuuge cavernous space. Maybe they get super duper busy on the weekends, or something, but when I was there, only one tiny corner of the place had customers. 

The food was just fine, not great, not bad, just fine. The chicken katsu was a bit on the dry and overdone side but tasted good. I suppose the &#34;fusion&#34; part of the meal was the fact that the vegetables were sautéed in butter in a way that reminded me of a midwest diner. The heavy, hearty butter did not round out the dish well, since it was accompanying fried meat and heavy, sticky rice. 

The rolls were also just fine. The veggie roll was really good, with very tasty veggies complementing one another. The california roll was less good, the usual &#34;krab&#34; seemed to be replaced by something else that did not have the protein gravitas I was excited about."

My experience otherwise was great. I went with two friends and we ordered a bunch of things and ate as family style. We shared a HH sashimi set which came with a reasonable amount, a couple different rolls, agedashi tofu, and chicken kaarage. 

The sashimi and the rolls were all good. I thought it was a fair amount for the price. I thought the agedashi tofu was great! Their chicken kaarage was something I wouldn&#39;t order again though. It wasn&#39;t that crispy and disappointing.

Having lived in San Francisco most of my life and being spoiled by the sheer amount of delicious Japanese restaurant every 2 blocks - Seattle couldn&#39;t compare. 

Seattle sushi is so expensive for what you get. I worked in a Japanese restaurant for several years, I know how much fish is - their suppliers &amp; origin - the standard profit margins - storage and make...

+ Complimentary edamame
+ Happy Hour! (My god the price here is great compare to overpriced sushi in Seattle).
+ Generous size fish &amp; cuts.
+ SHISO leaf!!! Super authentic they serve it with squid - ika. Just like in Japan. It transform the flavors of various fishes.
+ Celery is just decorative but unique and shows some serious knife skills.
+ Friendly personal-able service, lots of smiles.
+ 3 for $20 rolls! That&#39;s about $7 a roll.
+ Has Groupon (only applies to regular menu and dine-ins)
+ Lunch buffet!
+ Large booths, doesn&#39;t feel cramped.
+ Enjoy the location and lots of walkability.
+ The food comes out pretty quick.
+ Grated daiko &amp; grated ginger with the tempura. PUT IT ALL IN TO THE TEMP SAUCE, IT IS SO GOOD! :) small details like that means so much to me! Authenticity!



I haven&#39;t had any of their cooked dishes. But for a restaurant that does it all - they are more authentic than 90% of the other crappy Japanese restaurants in Seattle. Pleasantly surprised!


------
Update: went again for the dinner and ordered udon, chicken karagae, hamachi kama, pork tonkatsu... Everything except the hamachi kama was bland and tasteless. So don&#39;t get the cooked stuff. It&#39;s not good. Chicken karagae is just fried chicken fritters, unseasoned and loaded with spicy mayo. Udon was so bland. No garlic or umami flavor.

$20 for 3 rolls...idk they were off their game. The empire roll was good but it&#39;s seriously like 70% rice and 10% fish. Meh.

Service was amazing and took the Groupon no problem."

Pros: Everything is SO fresh. The staff are very friendly. Happy hour is 3-7 DAILY, and features $5 calamari $6 tempura shrimp roll and $6 salmon roll... You can&#39;t go wrong with fresh ingredients that don&#39;t break your wallet. 

The dishes are UNIQUE! Imagine a calamari salad with a tangy creamy sauce and crispy lettuce. Or garlic fries sprinkles with cilantro and minced garlic.

The interior decorating is lively and I feel energetic about being there. A little bit of orange and brown with a splash of sea green.  My boyfriend just added he believes the interior is unremarkable. We disagree.

Cons:  Small portions! My boyfriend loves ordering chicken teriyaki, and everywhere but this place gives heaps of rice. In fact, this place probably gives 1/4 cup of rice. And if it&#39;s happy hour, you just get chicken...

Greasy tempura rolls... They&#39;re delicious, but kind of leak oil, which is strange.


I decided to let you know what to expect upfront to prevent disappointment. Try this during happy hour. You&#39;ll at least try something new without having to wait until the following pay day to have a night out!"

We came in for dinner and the place was almost empty.  I thought the 3 rolls for $20 was a great deal, so we decided to order three of the most expensive rolls, of course. :)  While it was a pretty good deal at $20, I would definitely not order them at $12 each.  The fish was SO skimpy.  Maybe the purposely cheap out when people order the 3/$20 deal.  Some of it was paper thin -- that is embarrassing.  I liked that the rolls did not have a lot of rice, but the fish did not seem fresh at all and the spicy tuna mixture was oddly dark.

I also did not like the service.  There was only one server and he took a LONG time to take our order.  Also, when the appetizers from the kitchen were done (the cooks would ring a bell) he would just leave the dishes sitting there.  We ordered two appetizers from the kitchen and he left one of them sitting for over 5 minutes while he set tables and shit.  When the second dish was done, he brought both dishes over together.  Our first dish was already cold.  I&#39;m not sure if this was intentional -- this is not a fancy restaurant where all the dishes should come out together.

The one dish from the sushi bar - tuna takiros -- was not good.  The flavor of the asparagus totally overpowered everything else, even the fish.  The fish was bland, tasteless, and had the same weird dark brownish color.  The kitchen appetizers were OK, I enjoyed the calamari and the tempura brie.

I might come back to satisfy any cravings for fusion rolls, but the H-Mart in Lynnwood has a sushi stand that also does 3/$20, and they don&#39;t skimp on anything!"

I stopped in to fill some time(and my stomach) before meeting up with friends. Unfortunately, that time filling aspect was more extreme than I&#39;d hoped.

It took an hour to get a beer and appetizer, through a combination of being ignored on arrival and the dish sitting in the kitchen until the previously hot dish was literally cold.

At this point I ordered a little sashimi because god knows how long it would be until I saw the waiter again, which arrived rapid fast because the sushi cooks are great. However, that was unfortunate as I purposely ordered the appetizer hoping it would be consumed prior to the meal, like a normal human, but oh well, take it when you can get it. 

Sushi was fine, service was not.

The 3 for $20 deal isnt worth relative to their original price unless you buy the more expensive option ($10+). Otherwise you&#39;re only saving as little as 30 cents and as much as couple bucks per roll.

Now the 3 rolls for $20, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just ours, the fish isn&#39;t very fresh and not rolled very well. Very lousy and thin cuts of the fish. Those cheap bento box side rolls I have had was better than the ones here. The pictures looks too good compared to the real food served. The table is sticky. If you are just looking for whatever food when hungry and in the neighborhood, go because it&#39;s not busy."

On Sunday, January 10, a friend and I were looking forward to trying out the new sushi restaurant that opened on the ave, Sushi Town. We headed over there at 11am and were saddened that because it was still their soft opening, they weren&#39;t open for that day. We searched for other sushi joints in the area and decided to try out Mejari&#39;s. We&#39;ve had their sushi delivered before, but we haven&#39;t dined in their restaurant yet.

When we arrived at the restaurant, we noticed it was empty, which normally isn&#39;t a good sign, but at open time on a Sunday morning during a Seahawks game, I guess that&#39;s not quite abnormal. As we entered, we were greeted by the server, who made us immediately feel very welcome.

My friend and I have heard of their 3 rolls for $20 deal, so that&#39;s what we were planning on doing, until our server said the magic words: &#34;All you can eat.&#34; That was a game changer for us as we&#39;re obsessed with sushi. Our server said that with the $20 deal you only get 3 rolls, but with the all you can eat, which costs less than $20, you could have so much more! We opted for the all you can eat, of course.

He took out a small notepad and pencil and proceeded to take our order. The all you can eat menu includes great rolls and even nigiri! &#34;Order all you like!&#34; he said to us. &#34;Make him (points to sushi chef) work!&#34; As we waited for our first round of sushi, we had a craving for some miso soup. Without mentioning it to our server, he brings us two bowls of miso soup, which he tells us is on the house!

When the sushi was brought to our table, we were salivating. When I put the first piece of sushi in my mouth, it was so good, I had to close my eyes and go &#34;Mmmm.&#34; Three rounds of exceptionally delicious, fresh sushi later, and a victory for the Seahawks (Mejari&#39;s has several flat-screen TV&#39;s that showed the game) made for a perfect lunch.

Our server returned to our table and quickly whipped out his notepad and pencil, eager to take our next order. My friend and I laughed. &#34;We&#39;re done. We&#39;re so full!&#34;

After we paid our bill and before we headed out, I did something I never do. I shook our server&#39;s hand. That&#39;s how impressed I was with everything. He was extremely fun and genuinely kind. I regret that I never got this name. But on my next visit, I&#39;ll be sure to get it.

After the mediocrity that was Japonessa (beautiful sushi restaurant in downtown with just sub-par sushi), we were very delighted with Mejari&#39;s. Don&#39;t let the old interior and emptiness of the restaurant dissuade you from dining here. The sushi and service was TOP NOTCH!

It was kismet. If Sushi Town had been open that day, we probably wouldn&#39;t have discovered the greatness that is the Mejari&#39;s dine-in experience. Mejari&#39;s will definitely be a restaurant that we will gladly frequent. 

Sorry, Sushi Town."

First off, free parking in the back. The restaurant itself is very spacious but the ambience unfortunately is super dated, as it used to be a diner/cafe prior to Mejari. Complimentary edamame and friendly service. The great thing is the 3 rolls for $20 deal (with interesting varieties of rolls offered), which really satisfied the two of us. You can&#39;t find dinner at this price anywhere in town! It&#39;s not fancy but it helps when you have a sushi craving. We had the spider roll, Aztec and Furious roll and we couldn&#39;t pick which one was our favorite. When they say the roll is spicy, it&#39;s got a good kick to it. I saw $9 chirashi bowls on their happy hour menu, so I&#39;ll definitely be back to try more."

Overall the rolls were generous in size, full in flavor, fresh in quality, and cheap in price. We ordered four rolls off the Happy Hour menu which came to about $24. They also have a deal outside of Happy Hour where you can get three rolls for $20 or all-you-can-eat at the sushi bar for $19 per person. To top it off customer service was spectacular! 

This place would be a great spot for big groups as they have a large space with many tables. I&#39;ve also heard the breakfast is amazing. Hoping to try it out myself one of these days."

My first experience at Mejari Fusion confirmed my interest in returning to this awesome restaurant. Sushi can get expensive, which is why Mejari offers 3 rolls for $20, including specialty rolls! Imagine ordering three rolls that are $14 each. Get all three for $20. Great, great, deal. Mejari also offers all-you-can-eat for $18.95. Someone pinch me. 

The staff here are friendly and stop by frequently to refill beverages or assist with other guests&#39; needs. The owner (I failed to remember his name) is so lively and very entertaining! He was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu. 

Need to order to-go? You totally can! 
If you&#39;d like to drink some beer and watch the football game in an environment that is not too congested, they play the sports channel here. 
You can also walk to Hello Robin! and Dick&#39;s from here for a milkshake after your meal.

The service is almost always excellent. Sometimes the waiter/waitress is still being trained but overall, they are great.

The food is amazing!! They have a huge variety of sushi rolls. The fish is super fresh and is very generous. My boyfriend and I usually get the 3 for $20 deal. Based on our many visits:

Edamame- Complimentary every visit. Freshly cooked every time!

Miso soup- I&#39;ve never had it with mushrooms before but it adds a great flavor.

Yummy Roll- Amazing! This one is my favorite roll. We get at least one every time. The scallops are creamy, the tempura shrimp is crunchy, and the flame sear on the top gives a slight smoky flavor.

Philadelphia roll- Very traditional. It has a good balance of ingredients and doesn&#39;t skimp on the fish.

Seattle Roll- Simple but good. It feels very light.

Crunchy California- Maybe it&#39;s because it is a California roll that I&#39;m not impressed with it. It ok but not great. The crunchy part is very well done though.

Furious Roll- Slightly spicy and tangy! I get this one with the spicy sauce on the side but if you have any spice tolerance, it will be perfect. It&#39;s super refreshing.

45th St Roll- Delicious. It is one of my boyfriend&#39;s favorites. I love the balance of cream cheese  and the lightly fried outside.

Evergreen Roll- Omg good vegetarian roll! It is crunchy, soft, and very flavorful. One of my friends swears she could eat this every day. 

I&#39;ve tried a couple of their eel rolls. This is the only place I can eat eel because they make it so well.

Short ribs- Delicious! There isn&#39;t a lot of them but they are very tender.

Seared Salmon Salsa- ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!! It is on the secret menu. This is probably some of the best food I have ever eaten. 

This restaurant is definitely a place to try if you like sushi!"

You made us feel welcomed,  were thoughtful and attentive,  helping set up and accommodate our crazy table decorations- black table cloths,  All Time Low pictures, red rose petals,  snowflakes and a whole bunch of candy scattered everywhere- Busting your hump for all 20 of us with everyone&#39;s correct orders and drinks, didnt skip a beat. 

After the previous customers finished dining we had a section all to ourselves so we had some privacy and our guests felt comfortable,  relaxed, and we were all together in one area.

Just your standard Americanized sushi rolls with too many ingredients, prepared by Hispanic chefs. And... it&#39;s pretty good! I liked the &#34;Yummy roll&#34; a lot, just because I love the taste when they use the torch to sear the fish. 20 bucks for 3 rolls gives you a lot of food, compare to other places. And there are a lot of other sushi places in Wallingford (what&#39;s up with that?), so I hope this place can compete.

The restaurant space is gigantic and mostly empty. If the owners are reading this, I would suggest they open up the front of it to rent to other shops. A juice bar and a dessert / bakery would go well with the Wallingford crowd."

The interior looked really outdated, and the wait area booth seat was ripped and taped over(cheap owners). I&#39;ve heard this was an Indian restaurant and boy does it look like one! Well we ordered quite a few sushi , but took forever to come out, didn&#39;t mind because our server said their was a party of 50. Thanks for telling us, and appreciated him telling us too! Anyways the first dish came out was the teriyaki noodles. It Tasted like curry ( I HATE INDIAN FOOD)!!!! I couldn&#39;t really dig it at all, only the chicken was good. The dishes came out and they were decent except one which was fried (I forgot what it was called). That was extremely tasty!!!!!

Over all this is a decent stop and go restaurant not too expensive, and decent food. Just fix the interior please!!"

You moved into a long standing neighborhood icon building but are not acting like a good neighbor.  I was parked in the parking lot behind Murphy&#39;s in a space that was apparently yours.  However, your space was not marked as belonging only to the customers of Mejari. In fact the space was right next to the sign that says for &#34;Murphy&#39;s customer&#39;s only&#34;.  It didn&#39;t even occur to me that I was parking somewhere I wasn&#39;t supposed to be.  

After an hour in Murphy&#39;s, I was shocked to find my car gone.  I was informed by Murphy&#39;s that your two establishments are in a war over the parking lot and that you most likely had me towed.

It cost me $370 and an extra hour + of my time to get my car out of impound.  It was 11pm.  Your restaurant was dead.  The parking lot was empty except for the cars at Murphy&#39;s.  What was the point?  What did you accomplish?  You didn&#39;t earn any money from that exchange. When I told your chef about what he did, he had no empathy.  He had no apology.  He only looked at me as though I were the offending enemy.  

I am a neighbor.  I have lived here for 13 years.  I have three kids in three different schools here.  I&#39;m nice to my neighbors.  I&#39;m forgiving and welcoming.  I go out of my way to take care of my neighbors.  How long have you lived in Wallingford?  How long do you want to live in Wallingford?   You may want to start acting like a good neighbor if you are interested in staying here.  How are you going out of your way for your neighbors?  Are you creating connections? or breaking them? 

 Note:  Towing people, when there is no reason to do so, is not neighborly.  Note: Harming innocent would be customers while striking out at your neighbor businesses, is not neighborly.

There is a pretty good variety for rolls that apply to the offer and they&#39;re not just your basic California or spicy tuna -type rolls (though they are an option). Most of the sushi on the list good but I love the Yummy roll and Azteca rolls the most. Portion wise, 3 rolls can feed 2-3 people depending on how hungry you are, but most of the time we finish with 2.

I did not enjoy the food at all. Basic details of the meal, such as soy sauce, green tea, and miso soup, were of poor quality. We ordered the King Salmon roll, Spider roll, and Tuna roll. Each had problems in assembly, quality of fish, and overall experience. I&#39;d like to think that they were just having a bad day, but my experience was very poor.

I would put this place at a 3.5 stars though... It was good, but not amazing. Staff were incredibly nice the whole time my friend and I was there. They had a lot of deals (including HH) like getting three rolls for $20 and some of the rolls were already like $10 each."

We shared 6 pieces of salmon nigiri and split 2 rolls, which were fine but nothing to celebrate. 

Then when we asked for our next piece of sushi, the chef told us that because it was after 3 PM we would have to pay extra for anything more !!!  When there are 5 sushi places within two blocks, that&#39;s a great way to lose two new costumers."

The service started fine. They took our orders (2 Misos and 3 rolls for $20). We stuck with water. The meal was fine but when we finished, we sat there waiting for 20+ minutes for our server to come back so we could order dessert. I could see the other table near us looking around a lot as well because they wanted their check and we couldn&#39;t see the server. He finally came back and we both ordered tempura ice cream and when he brought them out mine was regular ice cream. I let him know and they remade it. Also at this point my water hadn&#39;t been refilled for about 30 minutes.

When we got the check we were told we couldn&#39;t use our Groupon with what we ordered. My partner is a restaurant manager that works with Groupon and we know if you don&#39;t put it in the exclusions (i.e. &#34;No happy hour, no to go&#34;) then you have to honor it. I also work in customer service and realize the best thing you can do is say &#34;sorry for the miscommunication, here is the real policy, we&#39;ll make a one time exception.&#34; It took about 15 minutes of discussion to get them to that point.

Needless to say we will not be back. It was a very frustrating experience and the fact none of the tables were getting service for over 15 minutes is a huge killer. Our server said he was a manager too."

If you&#39;re going to judge a book by its cover, keep on walking by Mejari. But if you&#39;re open to new things and all the wonderful reviews of this place, go here now! A few hours before leaving Seattle, we wanted to get one more sushi experience in since we were heading back to landlocked Denver. I read the reviews of this place and found it to be not only interesting with the fusion aspect, but also easy on the wallet which I&#39;m always a fan of. We walked in and there were two other tables sat and it has a weird vibe inside. The place is huge and it reminds me of an old thrift store/grandmothers house but without the knick knacks. My fiancé and I chose to go with the 3 rolls for $20 option (seriously, how wonderful is that??) along with tempura udon. It took a while to come out and our server apologized about that and gave us a couple cups of miso soup to hold us over. We had time to kill so it wasn&#39;t a big deal but we appreciated the attention and gesture. The sushi came out and HOT DAMN, it was not only gorgeous, but delicious. The three rolls we got were all delicious yet extremely different from the Furious roll with a citrus note to it to the Yummy roll with grilled shrimp on top to the 45th street roll, fried with cream cheese and other goodies in the middle. It was all so wonderful! Then the udon came out with a generous portion of tempura veggies and shrimp with a perfect, clean broth. I admit, I was a bit nervous coming in here since I tend not to trust restaurants that have TOO many varieties of food on their menu (example Mejari has breakfast, salads, Mexican dishes, sushi, etc). but nerves be gone after the food we have.

We decided on tempura and three sushi rolls - a Mexican fusion roll topped with pico de gallo, a spicy roll, and a sweet roll. The hostess informed us that the fish is bought fresh and never frozen and that definitely shows in the quality of the food.

I came in with the bee-friend a little over an hour before they closed. The server was really nice but that&#39;s about all the positive I can say about her....

We ordered the 3 for $20 deal and 2 beers. Well, 2/3 of our rolls were correct, the 3rd was not what I was expecting and I did not like it. Did we complain? No, mix ups happen but over time the server noticed her mix up b/c the other table complained...

In the end we ate the 3rd roll (well the Cheena man did) and when dropping the bills she says &#34;I only charged you for the 3 for $20&#34; WELLLLLL that&#39;s great b/c that&#39;s what we ordered so I&#39;m happy to hear you didn&#39;t charge me more or less b/c of your mistake and my 3rd roll being on the verge of gross.

Anywho, the 3rd roll was probably not included in the 3 for $20 and so maybe in the eyes of the restaurant we got a better deal but she really just made a re re comment that made her look more dumb.

This may come off as harsh buuuut $40 for a so so, no really a very SO SO experience, I expect more. Especially, with only 3 tables on a Thursday night. 

Overall, waitress very aloof, ambience from the Rusty Pelican days (for real!) overpriced and just chefs from other restaurants trying to run their own (which is great!) But it just ain&#39;t working.

I have now visited 5 times. It&#39;s one of the best sushi restaurants in Seattle. I feel that the rolls here,  particularly the 3 for 20 deal, are done if the best to be had. Creative, artful, and so flavorful. Normally I&#39;m a nigiri sushi type of guy, but the flavors of these guys create hard to pass by.  The Tuna Crunch, Seahawk , Salmon King, and Furious Rolls are tops! Despite the unusual decor and combination of traditional American and Mexican offerings, I would strongly recommend going for the sushi. If you love Chiso, Kisaku, Tsukushinbo, Billy Beach, Jsponessa, Toyoda, Shiro, or SKT, you will be equally pleased here!"

The appearance of the restaurant can be a little bit deceiving, because it is painted orange and doesn&#39;t have the decor of a traditional upscale sushi place. But the food is amazing, for a number of reasons. One, the overall flavor is as good or better than any sushi I&#39;ve had. Two, the price is exceptionally good. Rolls are $5-$7 during happy hour, which is every day from 3-7. This is about half of what you would typically pay elsewhere. Three, the food arrives incredibly fast. We haven&#39;t waited more than 10 minutes for our food to arrive. (For comparison, we also went to a much classier sushi place downtown, Umi Sake house, and we didn&#39;t like the food as much, paid more, and waited longer.) Overall, if you want great sushi at great prices, this is the place to go."

The waitress and staff couldn&#39;t tell me what was in their food. I have food allergies so that was a huge deal. After asking if there was egg in a dish several times, I finally just decided to order it since the chance of egg in sushi is minimal (I was mainly concerned about the sauce). 

On top of all of this, my food came out about 20 minutes before my friends. We assumed that they forgot her order. When her food got to us (chicken teriyaki) it was a handful of pieces on a piece of lettuce. We actually took it to go so we could buy some rice and veggies to go with it. 

The waitress was a little sour with us too. The only thing I asked her to do was see if there was egg in the food I ordered. She didn&#39;t seem to understand what I was asking so I had to clarify with her a couple time.

Also, what you order on the menu is not what actually shows up on the table. What I ordered was far from what I got. 

The interior of the place still looks like the Rusty Pelican, they just painted a few walls and hung up some sombreros. 

I guess this place is pretty new, so they might just not have it together yet. They could at least hire a new wait staff and be little more honest with the food. 

Please people. Just walk by this place."

The menu is better than similar sushi fusion places like Japonessa. The ceviche alone is worth coming - $9 for a mountain of octopus, huge yellowtail chunks, shrimp, avocado, and more.

The specialty rolls are unique and perfectly meld the flavors of umami fish and fusion elements like pico de gallo, for example.

The cocktail list beats out other cocktail joints in Wallingford, too. All the staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming.

The following was included on each menu item. The only thing I got to eat was Miso Soup, because both the poke tuna salad and chirashi bowl (neither of which have to include shellfish, or list shellfish in their ingredients) came with a variety of shellfish in them.

Instructions: Please no shellfish- Shrimp, Clam, Crab, Muscle, Oyster (very allergic)

Looked very fresh...  The server offered complimentary Miso Soup, brought out water and summoned the sushi chef.   We opted for the All You Can Eat LUNCH special  (11-3) priced at a decent 18.95.   Tons of rolls and nigiri to choose from...We started with Hamachi, Maguro and Seared Tuna.     OMG,  soooo good and hard to see as my eyes SLAM SHUT when my my mouth has something this delicious fed into it.  Moved on to the SEARED SALMON, Shime Saba Mackerel, and Tamago.    The seared salmon was Crazy delicious.....Sitting in front of the chef who hands you the plate seconds after flaming the fish makes all the difference....we ate many more SEARED SALMON before the meal was over.  Loved the Salmon Skin roll, Unagi roll and wanted to try many more but the Seared Salmon kept calling my name.....   The chef was not real busy with only four customers on the bar, so the service was outstanding..... good time to go after the lunch rush.

At first sight, this place seems to be a little old/rundown, but once you are warmly greeted and seated you realize that everything is clean and neat, just clearly bought from an old restaurant that went out of business. Whatever money they saved from the decorations clearly went into offering great prices on the sushi. The space is enormous and the owner clearly predicts that the buzz about this place will grow, and bought a space large enough for the immensely popular sushi place this will soon be. 

To the sushi itself: the tuna crunch roll was absolutely fantastic and the 3 rolls for $20 was a great deal on quality sushi. Every roll we had (4 total) possessed its own unique flavor profile and texture, very clearly planned and executed to perfection. 

This is simply one of the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had at some of the best prices."

It used to be a place for breakfast, then a Greek restaurant and others from what I&#39;ve heard.  The interior decor is old and worn and the room is huge.  That said, we were there for the food and it did not disappoint.  Our server was very friendly and attentive. They brought us free Edamame.  We went for the Bento Box which you choose from different Rolls, pick a Sushi and then an entrée. I had the California Roll, Unagi (eel) and Chicken Teriyaki. This Miso soup was delicious, not overly salty and contained mushrooms.  The Bento Box was delicious, simple (no rice with the chicken teriyaki for instance which I liked) and just the right amount.  Plus, it was only $13.50.

This place is fantastic! It&#39;s got a grungy feel to it, but not one that is unwelcoming. Our service was fabulous and prompt. We didn&#39;t have to wait long for anything. 

My two pals got personal pies and they looked delicious... judging from the cleaned plates and smiles, they WERE delicious. The personal pizzas are a pretty decent size and did not appear too greasy. The crust seemed average, not too thin or thick. I ordered the fish n chips and was not disappointed. Woah! The fish was cooked perfectly crispy but was also flavorful and not dry. 

While I did not drink I did notice that they have a pretty decent drink selection.

We went down to the bar on Friday night for drinks and had amazing service (I think the bartender&#39;s name was Shawn) and enjoyed ourselves. Things were very, very different tonight when we went for dinner. 

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted in a manner that made us feel as we were interrupting the employee by just showing up. He said that the dining area was full but we could sit at the bar if we wanted (the dining area was not full at all with several tables open) and we said we&#39;d wait for a table. Another waitress came over and sat us at a very long table meant for 8 people when it was only the two of us eating. We saw that right next to us was an empty booth that would be better suited for us and asked our server if we could switch there instead. He let us move but didn&#39;t take our order. Then the original employee who greeted us, Paul, said &#34;I see that you guys decided to move to my section. I&#39;ll be with you in a minute.&#34; After nearly 10 minutes, he finally came to take our order.  

During the meal, he never once came over to check on us or see if we needed refills. After we were almost done with the meal, he came to ask if I&#39;d like a refill on my beer, to which I declined. Then he said, &#34;So I guess you&#39;d like the check then huh?&#34; My wife and I were stunned and simply said yes. He proceeded to place the check on our table and said &#34;Here you go. Don&#39;t feel like you have to rush on my account. I&#39;ll be here all night.&#34; in a very condescending manner. 

I couldn&#39;t believe the audacity of Paul to be so rude and short with us. It was not overly busy and most of the tables had cleared out by the time we were done eating. We were both extremely disappointed by the experience and will not be eating there for the rest of our stay."

The Rock is a chain restaurant with locations in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. While pizza is part of the restaurant&#39;s primary offerings, it&#39;s not the reason I go there. The pizza flavors are good but the crust is typically soggy and I&#39;m not a fan of that. However, I do enjoy several of their other food offerings - like the mozzarella bread (free with Yelp check-in). They offer brown sugar mozz bread (delicious) as well as garlic mozz bread. The mozz bread baskets are huge and can be split among 3 or 4 people easily. If carb overload isn&#39;t your thing, the menu has a large variety of other options to satisfy both the carnivores and vegetarians in your group.

But if you ask me, the best reason to go to The Rock is their cocktails (best when served by awesome bartender Aaron). Not only are the bucket drinks entertaining (fruity cocktails served in kiddy plastic beach pails), they are also tasty and will get your heart racing with the Rockstar energy drink. My favorite is the skinny option that&#39;s made with the sugar free Rockstar and four flavors of vodka. Yum. I also really enjoy the lava lamp cocktails. This one is made with fruity vodka too but includes a mixed in Jell-O shot and it&#39;s served in a flashing lava lamp glass. Ha! Happy hour is from 3 to 6pm and 9pm to close Monday through Friday. It&#39;s a good deal with offerings like $7.25 bucket drinks, $5.25 other cocktails, and $4 to $6 bar bites."

We were able to get into this place via Open Table when so many other places had hour plus waits because of the game. The pros here are the wood fired pizza and the burgers. Both quite good. The cons the Nachos and a somewhat confused kitchen and server. The Nachos came out after our entrees so Our server comped them but they were not very good, way too much cumin. The youngsters liked their pizza and fried chicken strips but the happy face kid fries were not good. Mostly a good place with a few wrinkles to iron out.

Good thing I was paying attention or they would have pulled a fast one on me.  Really bad service, the only reason they get 2 stars is that the food is very good.  Get the garlic mozzarella bread...from a different Rock location."

I feel so bad for this trio of staff members. We waited 5-10 min to be seated. Ordered our drinks and got them 20min later. Our pizza arrived, but not as ordered. Several other patrons had some issues with food being late, incorrect, etc. We waited for more fries and have been sitting here for close to 45 minutes for our fries and 2nd pizza. The manager spilled a glass of ice all over another family&#39;s pizza. It was just a rough day for these folk and I am just pissed about this overall experience. They had no leadership and took no initiative. If they suck this much at service at 2:30pm on a Saturday, I&#39;d hate to see them busy. The food is good. But service is horrible."

Actually a very cool interior - kinda like a biker bar but clean and modern.

We also got some fries which were delicious and when we asked for more, it took them 45 minutes to bring them! After waiting for 25 minutes or so, we decided to forget that fries and just asked for our check, which took them another 25 minutes!

I called down for room service one night, since The Maxwell Hotel&#39;s website said they offer room service via The Rock, their in-house restaurant that they are not affiliated with. The server I spoke with on the phone stated that they did NOT offer room service (very curtly, I might add). Here&#39;s the conversation that ensued (somewhat paraphrased):

Me: Oh, well, it says online that you do!
Server: We don&#39;t.
Me: Oh, okay.
Server: You can place an order for pick-up, though.
Me: Oh, well, I&#39;m obviously staying in the hotel...so, I can just order and come downstairs and get my food?
Server: Yes.
Me: Okay, I&#39;ll call you back when my friend and I decide.

[I call back less than 10 minutes later and speak with the same server]

Me: Hi! I&#39;d like to order two steaks -
Server: We don&#39;t have steaks.
Me: Oh...well, again, your website [this time, I&#39;m actually on The Rock&#39;s website] says that you do.
Server: That website is out of date. Do you have a menu in your room?
Me: Uh, this brochure-looking thing?
Server: Does it say, &#39;The Rock&#39; on it?
Me: Yeah...so...I guess nachos and a burger and...[to friend] do you want dessert?
Server: [very frustrated] Look, I have a restaurant to run, and I can&#39;t be on the phone very long.
Me: Okay, great. I understand that. But I&#39;m a paying customer, too.
Server: I understand that you&#39;re a paying customer, but I have other tables.
Me: Okay.
Server: Do you want dessert or not? 
Me: Uh, no, not now!

I hang up, call the front desk, tell them about the negative experience I just had. They say they&#39;ll let The Rock staff know. I say no, you actually need to comp my food - this server was super rude to me FOR NO REASON. I was being perfectly polite to her the entire time she was talking to me in a clipped manner [also, as I found out later, SHE IS A SERVER NOT A MANAGER. What restaurant is she running? Cuz it ain&#39;t The Rock]. The Maxwell kid tells me he&#39;ll check with The Rock to see if they can comp my food and will call me back. The kid calls back, tells me he can&#39;t comp my food &#34;right now&#34; because they&#39;re not directly associated with The Rock (why did he need to check on that? Shouldn&#39;t that be something he knows? So many questions. So little patience). BUT I can go down there! So I do. And I ask the server, upon meeting her, why she is so angry. Like, honestly. What did I do? I get that:

1.) I sound like a drunk college girl you definitely don&#39;t want to talk to at a party when I&#39;m jet-lagged and
2.) This server probably has to deal with really crap people all the time, BUT I AM NOT ONE OF THEM UNTIL YOU TEST ME. 

She comped my drinks and apologized that I &#34;felt that way.&#34; Girl. I am not down to clown with your passive-aggressive Seattle bs. Check your attitude, bruh."

Without boring you with the lengthy details, suffice it to say he totally set me up for success and completely took care of me. His staff was ultra friendly and the food was incredible!

It&#39;s too bad I can only give 5 stars! This place deserves a solid 10!! Do yourself a favor and check it out. Incredible food, great atmosphere and staff that cares about you and your meal. Why would you not eat here??!?

Great Food, Great Drinks, Great Fun
Oh and Great Service!

If you only come here for one thing, come for a Bucket.  It&#39;s a sand bucket filled with ice and alcohol.  Three types to choose from: Rum (my fave), Long Island (yummy as well), and Margarita (It&#39;s alright).  The Rum bucket is the best!  Also comes with a shovel!!!

Come and try one.  The food is actually pretty great,  I love their white sauce pizzas, and the BBQ Chicken salad is pretty yummy too.  And the bartenders and staff are always super nice.  For my birthday, they gave me a jello shot on the house!!!  So nice!!!  Oh, and the jello shots come as a giant syringe!  Get!  Like a shot!  So fun!  I probably sound like an alcoholic, but believe me, you&#39;d be this excited too if you tried one of their buckets.  Almost forgot, you can keep the bucket as a souvenir!  Perfect to make your own at home!  Not like I&#39;ve done that, but I could."

Wow a bucket called &#34;don&#39;t fear the reaper&#34; (I didn&#39;t and ordered one). Somehow the two merchino cherries tasted fantastic before I even started drinking which is odd cuz I never enjoyed them before today. 

Checked in with yelp for a free monster order of mozza sticks served with a side of marinara sauce and a side of ranch. Heaven. 

My boyfriend ordered the regular bucket (Rum and citrus juices) and although when he tasted mine he said it tasted like candy (yum) he then stated he liked mine better than his (he choose what he did due to an aversion to vodka drinks). 

For food I chose the steak and my boyfriend chose the beef dip (called something fancy). Food was above standard and a lot of it too. 

Yay

Next drinks were the lava lamps which come in plasticized drink glass that lights up. Yes as a female I have to admit I was thrilled to pieces (truly-no sarcasm here honest) however my French (Normandy French not Quebec French) boyfriend thought it tasted very chemical (I guess that explains my enjoying it so much being a lover of candy and sugar) sigh. Fantastic.  (And not just because there&#39;s alcohol in these fine drinks.) Yummy. Let&#39;s hope I think as good as I do tomorrow the day after.  

Ryan was our waiter and he was oh so patient which was a huge cherry on top of the its-better-now end of the day to a perfect 3 day Seattle visit for this vancouverite.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone - especially if you&#39;re staying in the hotel next door since it means you can enjoy booze without driving home. :)"

I talked to the manager, I guess he was, and asked him if I could sit at a booth bcuz obviously that table didn&#39;t have a server. He said sure but very rudely, like in a do whatever you want tone. The server that was cleaning the booth looked very frustrated and as I went to let him know we were going to sit there, he cut me off and gave me a very condescending answer that ended with him calling me dear. Ummm....okay at this point I don&#39;t even want to sit there bcuz I don&#39;t want anyone spitting on my food.

Order was ready in 15 minutes just as they said. I ordered a steak salad and made some changes with the dressing and cheese. 

Why only 2 stars then, well, while the host guy was super nice (offered me water/soda to go) and order was correct, the lettuce was poorly prepped. I had a bunch of the thick part of the romaine hearts (you know that bottom part you tend to throw away) and huge other chunks that were not cut up well.

The food is average and the service too. I was not in the mood to get a pizza so I decided to eat little healthier and ordered a soup and salad combo. The soup tasted like something straight out of a can and the salad was drenched in dressing, probably so you can&#39;t see how old the lettuce was. I usually ask if they make the soup in house but I think deep inside I was afraid of the answer here, big mistake.
I tasted some of their pizza and it tasted good but not good enough that would make me come back here."

And I feel the didn&#39;t deserve this .. Aaron was amazing with a party of 16 he came to our table many times .. But when you wait for over three hours for your meal it&#39;s a mess. I think that you need to support your server. At a time where this place is slammed packed you as a manager need to come over and apologize till your blue in the face. I will say Aaron should have 10 stars and the bar manager did make it right. But it took a lot of talking to get things done .. Aaron we are sorry your team doesn&#39;t support you....

(4 stars)

We are all about HH up here in the PNW

- FOOD/DRINKS, yum
- PRICES, affordable
- AMBIANCE, typical chain restaurant/lounge
- SERVICE, good

We didn&#39;t order food since we just ate at a different restaurant. However, we came here for the HH. Great HH prices.

My girlfriends from HS and I wanted a girls night out (on a Monday night). Get drunk and go watch a funny movie and be extra annoying in the theater... BECAUSE WE CAN!!! We decided to order the drinks served in the buckets and we chugged them down as fast as we could. Buckets are from $9.99 - $12, during HH its $2 off. I forgot which ones were ordered. The first one I took to the head was The Original - its the one that tastes like spiked punch and doesn&#39;t have any energy drinks mixed in it. Good stuff.

Being drunk at the movies with your friends from HS and watching a funny movie was the best. Makes everything x10 funnier.

Will I be back? YUP!!!!"

In short: Don&#39;t wast your time, walk two blocks West and get quality woodfired pizza at The Masonry. 

In Long: 
The rock is a poorly managed establishment that exploits their employees and hopes no one notices. Unfortunately, customers do. 

Let me start by stating, this place kinda has it bad because the rushes are uncontrollable. Not only are the guest from the hotel constantly ordering to go, they also have slams that are directly correlated to the city center&#39;s events. That being known, effectively staff and prep your kitchen! 

It&#39;s disappointing to see servers having to work extra hard at communicating to customers for the back of house&#39;s lacking, then turn around and watch them get eaten alive by their cooks for asking how a table&#39;s order is building. It&#39;s bullshit and that&#39;s not how the industry works. 

I thought I&#39;d pop in because I wanted cheap drinks and maybe a salad, (Although I know the ingredients here are frozen, cheap, and lack quality). I witnessed two tables up and walk after waiting 60 minutes for soup, salad and pizza. 

Poor kitchen. The one guy working the pizza oven had, what looked like 20 orders to bang out. I can only imagine the grill station. 

Our server was caring and nice, but I thought he was going to break down after coming out from the back station for a fourth time with no food in his hands. Not to mention the endless soft drinks and ranch sides he had to refill, constantly... Next time, kid, go hide in the walk-in, soon enough you won&#39;t feel anything and your heart will be ice just like the bitches making your orders. Plus, no one can hear you cry in there. 

Not to mention, the management are obvious slaves to corporate america, and walk around like zombies as if they&#39;ve sold their souls. They couldn&#39;t give a fuck, and I don&#39;t blame them. I bet endless pizza orders and classic rock haunt them in their sleep. 

In conclusion: Support local business! Skip this place."

I had dinner and drinks before a concert event with a co-worker here and it was smooth all the way through! The bartender was extremely helpful which was surprising since we were sitting at a table and not at the bar itself. 
The food came out in a timely manner, drinks were quickly poured, and the waitress/bartender was very friendly, always smiled, informative, quick, and professional. Great service! Thanks!

The pizzas we ordered were yummy yum and paired really well with the beer selections they had. Finished off with some whiskey which were great pours. The atmosphere was very classy, clean, and intimate. It was easy to have fun in our booth without having to yell over anyone or anything.

Good food, place, great service, fun drinks at a full bar with themes...what else can I ask for? Thanks!"

Finally got a seat at the bar. Took ten minutes to get the bartender to come back. Order Moscow mules. Which were kind of watered down tasting and not in copper mugs. We decided to share a pizza (which was good). Unfortunately, it took 45 minutes to get it!! The people on both sides of us arrived well after us and both got there pizzas before us. To make it worse, when I asked the bartender about it he said &#34;ma&#39;am I can&#39;t control the kitchen&#34;. Trying not to ruin the night out with my sister-in-law, I kept my mouth shut and raised an eyebrow at him. He then said he guessed he could go look. He did return with the pizza. It was wrong, but we didn&#39;t say anything because we were running late for the Nutcracker. He gave me some lame excuse about the food runners. Still doesn&#39;t explain why only our pizza took 45 minutes. We then had to ask for silverware and the bill (We had to leave in five minutes). Since he didn&#39;t let a manager know about the long ticket time, I can only assume it was his mistake.

I have worked as a server, bartender, and manger of restaurants for 25 years and he is damn lucky I was trying to be nice in front of my sister-in-law. If a manger reads this you need to have a serious discussion with the gentleman that was working behind the bar on 12/12/15 at about 6:30. His service and attitude sucks!! We still tipped 10% only because having been a server I just couldn&#39;t stiff him."

I ordered one side house salad, one 12&#34; mushroom pizza, and one order of the Lil&#39; Rockers sun dried tomato and garlic bites. I asked them to not cut the pizza. I was told it would be about 30 minutes.

When I arrived, the food was ready, which was great. However, when the server brought the food up front, he started talking about how they normally don&#39;t serve uncooked pizzas. I stopped him and told him I asked for it to be uncut, not uncooked. He had misunderstood me so I had to wait another 12-15 minutes for my pizza to be cooked. He should have confirmed what I said over the phone but, hey, it happens.

The food:

Side garden salad: small for the price, not much cheese to speak of, nothing too exciting.

Lil&#39; Rockers sun dried tomato and garlic bites: they really are bite-sized. Fair price. The garlic is strong. Highlight of an underwhelming meal. Good but not great.

Mushroom pizza: they didn&#39;t cut it (yay!) and it was cooked (yay!). Compared to the pictures I saw on Yelp, the one topping we ordered was very sparse, unfortunately. The pizza, despite having nothing but mushrooms on it, was quite greasy. It is wood fire grilled, which is great, but my pizza was a bit overdone (I don&#39;t want to eat black crust).

My wife shared this meal with me and was as equally unimpressed.

Overall, I don&#39;t think we will be visiting this restaurant again. The food was average, at best, but for the price it wasn&#39;t worth it."

He was fast, friendly, and worked hard to get us out on time to the event we were going to. Unfortunately he had many other tables and never asked how our food was. 
My salad was the worst I have ever had. The BBQ chicken chop salad. I almost thought they had not added chicken to it. Basically a pile of iceberg lettuce, ranch, cheese, and BBQ sauce. Half a breast of chicken and no depth at all. So sad for a salad. Wouldn&#39;t recommend this place and wouldn&#39;t return."

I had an excellent stay at the Maxwell Hotel. Everything is great. While connected physically, this restaurant is not part of the hotel. They do offer a discount for hotel guests.  

We were tired one night and stayed in. I purchased a large pepperoni. It was extremely salty, oily and soggy. The oil penetrated through two paper plates and probably is what made it so soggy. There is no way you can eat it with two hands and it was so limp from being soggy that it was hard to eat with two hands.

I am not sure if this was a fluke or the norm. This is just my experience. I would not order pizza here again. Apparently, they have a good bar. Regardless, it was my least favorite meal in Seattle."

Let me start by saying we&#39;ve always had amazing service at every rock we&#39;ve ever been to, until tonight... We arrived at about 9p. When we walked in, we were told by Josh &#34;hold on just a sec&#34; ok. No problem. The whole time while we waited josh, who was suppose to be seating us was instead talking to a booth full of women. Finally we get seated. Ok. Awesome. Oh, this is where I&#39;ll add there the restaurant was EMPTY. We were literally the only table seated in the dining area aside from the booth of women josh was speaking to the whole time. 
Ok, fast forward to drink ordering. I order a Don&#39;t fear the reaper, 3 gals order buckets, and 1 water. Drink come out, and my drink isn&#39;t the right color. It&#39;s supposed to be blue. Well after 5-7 minutes, and no sign of our lovely waiter, I go to the bar and talk to the bartender. She says &#34;we are out of blue curaçao, you waiter should have told you. Do you want something different?&#34; I said &#34;nope. Not a word.&#34; To which the bartender just shrugged. In the meantime, while I was talking to the bartender, one of the gals asked if they could make a grasshopper. Josh said &#34;I&#39;ll check but I think so&#34;. 10 min later, still no word on the grasshopper. In the mean time, a sweetheart came by to check on us. His name is Matt. He was amazing. Then after not hearing the results of the grasshopper, we asked Matt to check. Which he promptly did. Matt came back and told us they didn&#39;t have the ingredients for a grasshopper. Ok, no worries, she&#39;ll take a White Russian. 3 ingredients. Should be easy. Josh brings back a watered down drink, ok. No worries again. Then Matt brings another White Russian not knowing that Josh had brought her one. He said &#34;oh well he never rang it in, so this one is on the house&#34;.  
The second White Russian was ok, until we saw that the cream/half and half, whatever they use was curdled. Literally had chunks in it. We told Matt and he was so apologetic. When we ordered our food, everything is good. We ordered 2 pizzas, a chicken platter and a soup/salad combo and some Motz bread. Well the Motz bread came out with the pizza. Then about 10 min later Josh brings by a salad. Drops it, literally drops the bowl on the table and says &#34;someone ordered a salad right?&#34; And we responded with &#34;yea, the soup/salad combo..&#34; &#34;Oh yeah. That&#39;s right&#34; was his response. He went off to get the soup which took 10 minutes.... For soup... Never mind that all of our condiments never came until we asked a chef from the kitchen, who again, was amazing and got it for us quickly. At this point Matt was a giant doll and listened to my bitching about all of this, apparently their manager had just left. (Thank you, btw). After that, and Josh never ever coming back to check on us, Matt took over our table which was a huge relief. He came by and checked on us and asked if there was anything else we needed etc, you know, like a good server does. When we finally got our Check, we made sure to tip Matt and ordered him to keep it all and NOT SHARE IT!!! I hope Matt reads this and knows how much we appreciate his efforts to make us happy. And as for Josh, maybe he was just having an off night, however his service needs some serious help if he expects to make it in the restaurant business. 
PS: when we got seated there was a dirty table. May not seem like much but as we were leaving, an hour + later, it was still not cleaned! With 2 tables in the dining room and a good number of people, it seems odd that a table would still be dirty... Especially when there are 5 people behind the restaurant on their breaks.... Shouldn&#39;t their priority be cleaning their restaurant??

Update: today (9/14/15) I called to speak with the manager on duty about our experience last night. The first time I called, she was on break. So I was asked to call back in about 10 minutes. I called back about 30 min later and was put on hold while someone went to grab her. They pop back on the phone and tell me that she has 5 tables she&#39;s dealing with and is unable to take my call. I left my number and asked for a call back. I&#39;ll keep everyone posted!!"

We got there around 8 and there was only one guy manning the whole floor. He did a more than excellent job in getting us our food, drink, check, etc.

Would recommend this place to anyone if you love pizza. Very delicious!!"

The restaurant itself is lit up with neon lights and has tons of tv and looks like a cool spot that you wouldn&#39;t expect to find attached to a hotel lobby. 

Good beer and drink specials for happy hour, but I&#39;d suggest staying away from any of the colorful neon &#34;signature&#34; cocktails. Our waitress even discouraged my wife from ordering one of them because it &#34;just tasted nasty&#34;. They have gluten free pizza crust available and several other gluten free options. The gluten free pie was average, but the crust wasn&#39;t crispy enough. We also ordered a big salad, which was a typical boring house salad that you&#39;d get from any pizza place across America. 

Worth stopping for happy hour or for a quick bite if you&#39;re in the area, but I wouldn&#39;t make this place a destination."

There was no one in here when we came in, which I found kind of odd... But I figured it meant we would get our meal pretty fast. No such luck.

They came to get our drink order probably 15 minutes after we sat down, even though they weren&#39;t busy doing anything else. And then they immediately asked if we were ready to order. We weren&#39;t, so they left again. Didn&#39;t come back for probably 10 more minutes, although we tried to flag them down. Ordered the chicken basket. The fries were decent, the house salad my dad ordered was boring but edible, but the chicken was like leather. It was super overcooked and chewy, not at all good. We got sundaes for dessert, they were okay but tiny. Guess that&#39;s what you get for $3! Took them a while to bring the check. Oh well, it was okay. 2  1/2 stars."

Was in downtown for the DOTA2 International Championships, Key Arena had stopped serving food a long time ago and our pals had run off to eat, while we finished watching fnatic vs. Virtus.Pro. We then headed over to The Rock, where our friends were.

I grew up in NJ - I have had FABULOUS pizza, the best. Coal fire, mom and pop, wood fire, I love good pizza and have eaten a LOT. It was a treat when I was a kid, because my parents were poor, but sometimes on Sundays on the way home from church we would get a sausage pie, (and that would make the packed weekend worthwhile). When I got older and could buy pizza for myself, well, I wasn&#39;t shy about it, let&#39;s say that.

The Rock feels a little edgy - the posters are rock &#39;n roll, there is a decorative brick wall that is &#39;smashed&#39;, and they played good 80&#39;s music. We were starving, granted, but even if I wasn&#39;t the pizza would have been good.

The crust was pretty thin, with the right amount of crispiness on the outside and some chew inside. The sausage was sliced, (thank GOD), and not deer-turds, as my brother used to call them. The sauce was nice, didn&#39;t taste tomato-pasty, cheese was plentiful and although the offerings were a little small for the price, it was definitely some of the best pizza I have had in a long time.

We also ordered a salad to split, also a little expensive for the price, (the chop salad), and although they were fairly generous with the adds, (cheese, chicken, etc), the ONLY thing that had dressing on it was the lettuce at the bottom, so the rest of it tasted dry and wasn&#39;t bathed in dressing goodness. You might want to ask for extra dressing on the side - I will next time.

The place was not busy, yet it took a while to get a salad and small pizza, and our friends said their larger order was also slow, even though it was Monday and pretty dead.

They are open until midnight, so I hope we make another run this week again, but next time I am in downtown, I&#39;ll head to Roy&#39;s, if I can."

My boyfriend and I usually go to the Mill Creek location (which we&#39;re fans of) but came here to meet friends. We were all less than impressed. A harried looking guy took our name in the guestbook, but after that we were summarily ignored for almost 15 minutes, which we thought odd since there was a row of empty tables. When a couple who came in after our party disappeared, we checked the guestbook to see if they might have been seated first which was when we discovered that my boyfriend had been described in the reservation book as &#34;bald guy&#34;. He&#39;s not offended, just bemused.

We were finally seated, and waited just as long for our server. I listened to a conversation between her and my friend about whether or not certain menu items were gluten-free. I have been in the food service industry a long time, so I know when a server is winging it (there is a point when you shut up and say, &#34;I&#39;ll find out for you&#34;). This server was winging it. I couldn&#39;t tell whether it was because she couldn&#39;t follow the thread of the conversation because my friend wasn&#39;t communicating clearly enough, or because she didn&#39;t understand the restrictions of a gluten free diet. 

One particular menu item my friend asked about was the chicken strips. She had been told on a different occasion that she could order them &#34;naked&#34; and that they would come without the breading. Our server assured her that this was possible, but when they came, they definitely had breading on them. The guy who brought them insisted that they didn&#39;t, but when she returned, our server acknowledged that they were breaded and that she thought my friend just meant to order the chicken strips with no sauce. Furthermore, she clarified that it was not possible to order the chicken strips to the restaurant because they came that way. 

We did end up getting a comped salad (apparently it had been left &#39;unaccounted for&#39; earlier in the night), but given the wait for a table when empty tables were present, and the mix up with gluten free menu items, we won&#39;t be coming back to this location. In general, the service was friendly, and I think (again this is based on my experience with the food service industry in general, not anything specific about tonight) that the service holdups were due to a staffing shortage. The establishment was also clean, which is always a plus. However, given Queen Anne&#39;s plethora of quality dining establishments, I doubt we&#39;ll be back to this location any time soon."

To my amazement the service was amazing and the beer was great.  So the best way to enjoy is start with the beer sampler; try them all you may be surprised, I was.  This takes care of the beer.  Next, have the ribs, not a fan of ribs have them anyway you will be after.  Once you have your ribs and have honed in on a beer...it&#39;s now time for more meat... order the bone in..enjoy!

Combining the spirit of 70s British Pop icons with the soul of Vanilla Ice, Katie will make sure you are well taken care of.  Her warm disposition, juxtaposed with her sunny smile, makes me feel that I am truly sitting on a warm beach with this bucket firmly planted between my legs. 

Typically when I sit in my wood shop, carving rocking chairs for the needy, I drink a nice glass of Lagavulin 19. If not readily available, I still drink anything that is not of a clear origin. Everybody knows that clear alcohol is for rich women on a diet.  However, the angel otherwise known  as Katie convinced me that this &#34;Don&#39;t Fear The Reaper Bucket&#34;  was a worthy contribution to my intoxication level.

stuff I had:

lamb gyro sandwich:  Not your mama&#39;s gyro!  they don&#39;t use that spinning mystery meat wonder which is staple of post alcohol binges. Nice marinated and sliced leg of lamb grilled nicely and very tasty!!  My vote for best gyro/lamb sandwich so far in Seattle!! Served with a side of deep fried kale chips which hits the spot!!

The tomato bisque (soup of the day) was a rich and vibrant heat that perked me up on this typically cool fall day. When I say vibrant, I mean stunning. The perfect hue of orange that happens when you blend dairy and tomatoes. Flavor was perfect. Not so chunky you had to chew but not without texture either. 

I was then presented with the king of all sandwiches, the turkey club. This one served warm as a grilled panini that was giving it&#39;s all to contain the delectable ingredients. They included ripe avocado, thick slices of tomato and a velvety spread of luxurious bacon jam. This jam isn&#39;t like the others that you can find at other &#34;diner&#34; spots in the 206. This was silky and very savory. 

Next to the sandwich was a piling of kale chips that I was certain would fall flat next to all the aforementioned flavor. Not the case. They were crisp and delightful. A light and airy crunch seasoned with a blend of spices. A wonderful companion to my warm fall mid-day treat. Go, and enjoy Zinnia Bistro."

There is free parking everywhere.

I had a cup of tortilla soup. Spicy, healthy and yummy.
Quinoa salad with asparagus, oranges and spinach was fantastic. I love the dressing.
Shared  the almond chicken sandwich and it was really tasty. The best thing a loved about it was  the bread was toasty, but not too hard to eat. 

Service was great fast and efficient.

THE reason I gave them 3 stars instead of 5 is because of the hair my friend found in her salad...in her last bite. Eew. The server did the right thing and removed it from her bill,  but yuck. Hair/ beard net would be a good choice. Hey, wait I thought that was required by the state??"

I&#39;ve always gone with the potato pancake / gypsy stew offered only Fri/Sat, but this weeknight visit compelled me to try something new. 

My entree, the chicken schnitzel, was even better than I remembered getting when I lived in Germany. (Yes, Sebi&#39;s bills itself a Polish place, but much of the food is German fare or could pass as the less descriptive &#34;Eastern European.&#34;) The homemade sauerkraut crushed the  canned stuff that many of Seattle&#39;s delis pass off in their Reubens. Sebi&#39;s small touch here makes a big, easily recognizable difference. I opted for the accompanying potato dumplings (think gnocchi, not stuffed tortellini), and they were very filling. I ended up taking half of the flattened chicken breast in a to-go box, though it took a lot of self-restraint not to wolf down the whole thing in one sitting. 

The surprise hit may have been the pickle soup, that night&#39;s special. Never having tried it before, it&#39;s a chicken base with an ample amount of julienne cut veggies. I wouldn&#39;t imagine the uninitiated would normally be that adventurous, but I&#39;m glad the very attentive waitstaff recommended it since it made the meal even more memorable. 

Parking: The best bet is the lot across the street that is easy to miss and probably involves making a u-turn or jumping a curb. Its free / unmetered, but a building permit / public hearing notice means that the lot may not be accessible by the time you read this review. The lot also is not somewhere you should be alone after dark, I&#39;ve been told, and the ~45 degree slant to it makes getting out a bit challenging when full. 

Highly recommend and may even be my favorite restaurant in the area."

Friday evening traffic on I-5 South was a pain, but once at the U-District/Eastlake destination, there was ample street parking in the vicinity of the restaurant.

We were greeted, seated, handed menus and water with lightning fast speed. The bar and main dining room were mostly full. Smelled great and the atmosphere definitely had a relaxed, welcoming feel. Couples, groups, families, folks of all ages - lots of animated conversation and large screen TVs. Lots to keep your attention while you&#39;re waiting for your food to arrive after orders were taken. 

Not the place though if you&#39;re ravenous, because it took awhile to get our entrees. Should have ordered an app or salad to start just to take the edge off. However, once the platters came out - goodness that&#39;s a lot of food! We had enough bits of this and that, the takeout box even fed our kiddo when we got home. Can&#39;t rush quality and clearly there was a lot of attention to detail once served.

The husband had a Polish lager, Okacim ($6), which had a malty and hoppy finish.
He also ordered a cup of the Red Borscht Soup (Barszcz, $4) which was an assertive broth with tiny mushroom-filled uzska. For the main entrée, he had the Polish Platter ($15) which included: a cabbage roll (Golabkl), two of each pierogi (cheese, meat), sauerkraut, and Polish kielbasa. This evening featured the wedding kielbasa which contained smoked pork. This was very flavorful, lean, and not greasy like the commercially made ones. The sauerkraut, made with cabbage, red onion, roasted peppers, and vinegar was a big hit. 

I had the Schnitzel Platter ($20) which had all of the items from the Polish Platter, but had an added schnitzel (breaded pork loin). I had flavor and texture issues, but that&#39;s just my subjective newbie opinion. I&#39;m not well-versed with Eastern European style cuisine, but for a first try this was quite the variety to sample. 

Perfection for me would have been just sticking with the wedding kielbasa, the mustard condiment they served, some cheese, some fruit, and good artisan chewy bread."

The sausage plate and the ice cream were the best the sausage plate included 3 types of sausages all cooked perfectly, the stew was second followed by the other two.

Four meal deal: 4 plates of pierogi &amp; 4 crepes for $28.  A great deal, since each plate of pierogi costs $12 regularly. So we invited another couple for a double date night.

Parked right across the street at the old red robin, free parking, but please be careful there was all this shattered glass (restaurant can not be responsible for stolen items). 

Walked in and was seated promptly due to our reservation. Restaurant seemed clean and very inviting. Servers were informative and clear with what the groupon meal was going to be. So you had a choice of either meat&amp; bacon or cheese&amp;potato, all four of us ordered the meat and bacon pierogis.

Plump little dumplings were delicious. Ask for hot sauce if you want some kick and spice! Dumplings had a hearty dough but generous filling of ground meat inside.
Makes me really want to come back to try the potato and cheese! And schnitzel sandwich! 

I was too full for my dessert, but had a bite of it and it was a crepe filled with cream
Cheese and chocolate with berries drizzled.  Next time, I won&#39;t order that specialty, but I was absolutely stuffed by the end.  What a nice gem."

I&#39;m also comparing this to Polish Home Association (PHA) as these are the only two times I&#39;ve had polish food. Came here with a group and we just shared everything. Good idea.

Food: The three things I really liked were 1) the Gypsy stew. Weird name. It&#39;s slow cooked beef - which I LOVE! 2) We also got the Schnitzel Platter - so the &#34;schnitzel&#34; was pretty good. It&#39;s a piece of breaded pork. 3) The Polish Sausage was also pretty good. I liked how it&#39;s grilled so the edges are crispy. It was better than the one at PHA. As for everything else, it rated 0.5 star below that of PHA. Cabbage roll wasn&#39;t very flavorful. Pierogi&#39;s were just ok. The Potato Dumpling had so much dough. Very little filling. See picture. We got crepes to because of a Groupon deal. No bueno. The filling has no taste. 

Prices: It&#39;s a tad higher than PHA. $12 plate of pierogi which is similar, but the Schnitzel Platter was $20. Which is fine. I think prices are still reasonable.

Customer Service: This was better than PHA. The wait was forever (to get our food) at PHA, see earlier review. The service here was normal and our waitress was pretty nice. I asked a few questions since no one in our party has been here before and she was pleasant/patient about it.

There is a wider selection than PHA and no long wait. For pierogies, I would go to PHA. But the things that were good at Sebi&#39;s is pretty exclusive to just this place. Overall, these two places don&#39;t vary too too much. Generous 4 star."

We had a few drinks, some of them ate, everything was fantastic. It&#39;s a completely different feeling when you walk into a restaurant to meet a bunch of people that you can tell really truly enjoy what they do. Maybe that is what sets this place apart. They have a great beer selection including Hofbrau on tap which you do not find often. I will definitely be returning to try some of their plates and more of these vodka&#39;s I have not previously heard of.

I tried the pierogies and really wish that I hadn&#39;t. They tasted as if they were made far in advance and reheated before serving. The ones I got were with meat and the meat was extremely dry and almost like baby food-like in terms of texture. In the end, I sliced open some of them open and surgically removing the filling to eat just the dumpling. I tried the borscht soup as well and it was depressing. A thin, watery-tasting base that was far removed from the cup of borscht I originally fell in love with at Ukrainian Village in Vancouver, BC. The one saving grace of the meal was the sausage (kielbasa).. juicy and delicious. The mountain of sauerkraut that it sat on, however, was basically one big pile of mush, though I can&#39;t speak to its authenticity.

All in all, the food here really tastes like they are cutting corners. I don&#39;t doubt that their heart is in the right place, but the food needs to follow. If this is Seattle&#39;s &#34;best&#34; Polish food as their website advertises, I&#39;m scared to try even the second-best."

I pass on their Bigos because mine is better but their Pierogi&#39;s especially the meat, I can&#39;t replicate, I don&#39;t even come close with how they feel like home. They are also a pain in the ass to make from scratch which you can tell Sebi&#39;s does, it&#39;s a labor of love and it shows.  

However, if you don&#39;t make your own Bigos, it is a must for any Atkins/Paleo sufferer as it is a dish essentially made of meat and complex (veggies) carbs.  

The place is the Polish hospitality you know it to be, big portions and big drink.  They tell you how much they love you through food.

He loved it!  

I haven&#39;t tried a whole lot here yet, but I can say without a doubt, the pierogies are great. My favorite! I usually get those and a tuna melt. Though they don&#39;t have the melt anymore, which makes me sad. My husband gets a little of everything to try and we like to bring friends here for a little something different.

I ended up here, because through some miracle of computer-illiteracy, I&#39;d purchased TWO Groupons for dining at Sebi&#39;s - one for my Polish friend who goes all Pirates of Penzance over perogies (this was intended), and another for myself (totally unintended).

After calling virtually everyone in my address book to accompany me on my foray into the adventurous world of Polish dining I&#39;d finally snagged an enthusiastic someone who would eat a pair of galoshes, provided they were seasoned with enough salt and pepper.  With that abysmally low bar in mind, we set out to redeem my coupon for two perogi platters and two crepe desserts.

On a weekday evening, the restaurant was quite empty, with the bar packed and only a few people dining.  Next to us was an older couple who raved about the food, having just returned from Poland.  Across the way was a lone (also older) diner, who seemed to enjoy her food.  At the bar was the younger crowd, and our server was also quite young.  This threw me for a loop, as I&#39;d expected to be waited on a more Americanized version of Lech Walesa, pushing us to place an order for Sebi&#39;s famous Kielbasa.  However, we weren&#39;t given any pressure to order more food, and our server was very hands off.

...as it turned out, ordering more food wasn&#39;t necessary as our meat-filled perogis (all 15 of them?) were so filling, we couldn&#39;t finish them.  The crepes had a cream cheese filling and jam-like sauce, which wasn&#39;t bad.  

The restaurant has an ambiance that doesn&#39;t harken to anything that might scream POLISH!!! - tables and decor tasteful and unpretentious and not in the country&#39;s flag colors (Greek restaurants, I&#39;m talking to you!), with nice pieces of art on the wall; music was curiously dance/techno.  Bar seemed to be filled with regulars.   A little schizophrenic ambiance, but probably because the restaurant was trying to cater to a wide set of clientele.  One downside - no parking lot and parking a little difficult to find.

It&#39;s hard to make Polish food seem *interesting* to most, but a different dining experience for those of the *comfort food* set, who haven&#39;t eaten for a week and are suffering from a carbohydrate deficiency.  Besides the massive perogi platter, there are also pizzas, cabbage rolls, Schnitzel platter, Kielbasa (with or without perogis) - all of the Polish favorites I didn&#39;t know existed.  After dinner I quickly spiraled into a starch coma.  Polish is perhaps not my first choice in cuisine...maybe not even second or third...but I&#39;d consider stopping by again if in the neighborhood, or with my lone Polish friend."

The place was pretty deserted when we went in, aside from some seeming regulars at the bar. Maybe we just ordered the wrong menu items, but at a Polish place, my expectation for excellent pirogi seems reasonable, and Sebi&#39;s did not live up to that expectation.

The cheese and potato pirogi was dry and boiled without any pan saute to add a crispness to the outside and brown them. How you can boil something into dryness is beyond my comprehension. That said, they were edible, at least in my opinion, and the flavor was good, but I suspect laziness in the kitchen--prepping these things days or even weeks in advance and freezing them. At a normal price of $12 per plate, I would not be amused.

The dessert was ok, as well. Nothing spectacular. We had crepes filled with some sort of sweet cheese filling with a little bit of strawberry compote on the side. Fresh strawberries would have helped a lot. The crepes were a little bit on the slimy side and could&#39;ve definitely stood for a new cooking procedure that does not involve boiling.

So all in all, Sebi&#39;s is ok. But I probably won&#39;t be back. My boyfriend couldn&#39;t even eat the pirogi because of how dry it was and, although I liked it well enough to eat it, I&#39;m not ok with spending $12 for pirogi that&#39;s taken out of a freezer and boiled with a chef too lazy to even brown the outside in butter in a frying pan."

Was greeted by a nice gentleman and was offered a tasty beer right away while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive.  

I ordered the Perogi plate which had two meat and two potato perogi, 2 cabbage rolls and a Kielbasa.  I really enjoyed the cabbage rolls and even though I am not a fan of the prepackaged grocery Kielbasa crap I did enjoy Sebi&#39;s.  The perogi&#39;s were ok,  the meat one was a little dry but perhaps its just the older stuff being used to promote 1/2 price Mondays. 

I ordered some cabbage rolls and perogi&#39;s to go so I could bring my loved one home some dinner.  They only charged me 1/2 price on the to-go perogi&#39;s which is a nice surprise even though I believe just like happy hours it should be consumed on site.  

Over all had a wonderful time with great service and delicious food.  I would highly recommend Sebi&#39;s and want to come back to try the German dishes they have."

Good polish and German restaurants are few and far between and this place nails it. The atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxed. It&#39;s a family run establishment and I&#39;m pretty sure Polish grandma is hand preparing all the food in the kitchen. The service is always great and the food is delicious. I recommend the schnitzel, pierogi, cabbage rolls and if you go on friday or sarurday the gypsy stew is a must (only served on those days). They also offer some classic American fare which is also quite tasty if you&#39;re not a fan of Eastern European cuisine. The caprese salad, sandwiches and pizzas are all great! Nice selection of beer, wine and cocktails too. A must try if you live in eastlake and also worth commuting for."

This place is adorable-- it has this really nice, homey feel.  It&#39;s right off of University Bridge. I went on a Monday night at around 5:30, and it was almost empty.  I ordered a plate of mushroom pierogi-- yum!  They were wonderfully buttery, and full of mushroomy goodness.  I was pleasantly full, and all while spending less than ten dollars. Definitely good for a college student&#39;s budget. 

The only thing not so great about this place is the location-- the noise from the bridge is quite overwhelming (but you can&#39;t hear it once you&#39;re inside).  Also, the area might not be the greatest to be in after dark.  Otherwise, Sebi&#39;s is definitely worth a visit!"

I get as much pierogi as I could possibly eat whenever I go visit family. Unfortunately there just isn&#39;t a very large Polish community in Seattle, and so far the only place I&#39;ve found that serves pierogi is the Polish Home. So, when I heard from some random drunk people at a bar about Sebi&#39;s I immediately bookmarked it on Yelp as I place I needed to try out. Today I looked up their menu online and saw that they had a special on Mondays for 50% off their pierogi. It seemed a bit like fate, seeing as how today is Monday, so I drove there to go try out their pierogi. I had planned to get some to go and just eat them at home, but unfortunately found out that the deal is only offered if you stay and eat there. Luckily the waitress was very friendly and the food came out fast. Though they didn&#39;t have the option to have fried pierogi, only boiled. Also, I asked for half potato and half meat, but ended up with only two potato. In conclusion, the pierogi were slightly better than those I&#39;ve purchased frozen at QFC, but not nearly as good as any I&#39;ve had in a restaurant. I also wish they offered more flavors and dessert pierogi. For now it seems I&#39;ll just have to go back to waiting until the next time I go to the east coast or go buy overpriced pierogi from the Polish Home to get some decent pierogi."

I like trying new food and I LOVE Eastern European food, so when I was looking for something a little hearty to combat a mild hangover, the lure of some comfort food was impossible to resist.

It was very quiet on a Friday afternoon and I was seated immediately. I chose to order the cabbage rolls (beef and rice rolled in cabbage leaves and doused in tomato sauce), which appeared at my table almost magically fast. The beef was tender and the sauce was incredible. I got three rolls and some spicy sauerkraut and ended up taking a roll home with me for dinner. I couldn&#39;t finish the whole plate!

I went in with no real expectations and I was very impressed, the whole place was clean and large, quiet, and plenty of seating for lots of people although it was pretty empty when I was there. Loved the whole experience.

I absolutely want to come back and try some of their other Polish dishes."

Tabs were split with no difficulty. The atmosphere is quirky and homey feeling. One truly feels like family here.

There is free parking across the street at the old Red Robin. The parking lot isn&#39;t large (maybe 10-15 spots total) and the whole lot is for Sebi&#39;s customers after 6:00pm.

There are 3 different Polish brews on draft. Of course we had to try them all! The Golden Pheasant for $6 a pint was my wife&#39;s favorite. I ordered a couple glasses of 14 Hands Cab for $6 each. 

For our appetizer we ordered the Caprese Salad for $5 - consisted of three large slices of tomatoes topped with a generous portion of fresh mozzarella, black olives and basil all drizzled with olive oil rather than balsamic. Very refreshing! We also ordered a cup of the &#39;Soup of the day&#39; for $4 which happened to be dill pickle soup. So glad we tried this soup. The soup was a white cream based soup loaded with potatoes and chicken. The dill flavor was not overpowering all. Delish! 

For our dinner we ordered the Schnitzel Platter for $20. The platter consists of : Schnitzel (breaded pork loin), cabbage rolls (they ran out so were unable to try), Polish kielbasa, and pierogi served with a side of veggies. Since they had run out of cabbage rolls we were given the option of additional pierogi&#39;s or kielbasa to take their place. Looking forward to going back just to try those scarce cabbage rolls!

I have to give a big shout out to Daniel. My group had Daniel running every which way. Daniel was extremely personable, honest, funny and passionate. Part of our awesome dining experience was due to Daniel. 

Thank you Sebi&#39;s for opening your doors to our rowdy group of ladies."

I highly recommend getting a take out pizza from here the next time you are hungry.  

For pierogies, this is some outstanding food. This place should be swamped every night. Right now, it&#39;s not, so it&#39;s still a hidden gem.  The service is amazing, friendly and on top of it. I sit at the bar, (yes, a full bar!) and it is fast service.  They also have happy hour specials.

This place is in the old Romio&#39;s Pizza or Martello&#39;s so it has some great atmosphere.

Daniel was super accommodating and service was wonderful.  Everyone loved their food but the part I have been dreaming of since my first trip was still the crowning glory: Pierogi. 

I ordered the Gypsy Stew with pierogi subbed for the potato pancakes.   This was comfort food bliss to the next level.  I had a bit of leftover Stew so of course I had to get two orders of pierogi to go.  Pillowy, cheesey goodness for the next few days is the best result of any dinner (aside from the company, of course.)

The zurek soup is outstanding and everything on the schnitzel platter was well prepared and quite tasty. 

Our only suggestion is that the food be served hotter. Since most of it is prepared ahead of time we recognize that there is an inherent tension between keeping things hot and over cooking but we think the kitchen should consider erring on the side of temperature."

Ive always noticed this corner, but traffic and parking can be a bit tricky to navigate if you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re headed 

(wish I had known about the parking at red robin across the street) 

Overall service was fast and polite (we came in almost at closing time). I found the space to be pleasant and homely, something I think personally I was in need of (kinda homesick sometimes). 

Offhand I was pleased to see the Szarlotka on the drink menu (its a vodka drink made with bison grass vodka - spicy/earthy and either apple cider or ginger beer) TRY it, its good :) There were also several beers on tap. The bar is plenty stocked which is great - and complimentary to the sports playing on TVs (should have watched the CUP here). 

We shared the Schnitzel platter - the schnitzel was fried clean and well and was plenty tasty - good also were the cabbage rolls (though i felt like they needed some salt) The kielbasa was okay, the pierogis were okay (i don&#39;t think they are homemade but THATwould be a treat). The rest of the menu appeals to American sensibilities with pizza and sandwiches. Which is ok. Its a generally okay food. I scarfed down my portion with a pint of Perla beer.

I&#39;d like to come back for some specialities - and would hope for more homemade items and more contemporary polish foods. 

The current polish culture has some great sandwiches (cucumber, pasztet, etc..) interesting soups, tons of different slaw salads (from root vegetables and fruits), gofry - aka waffles, so many great breads and many types of sausages (bloodsausage yum!), summer pierogis filled with plums and fruits, pastries, little deep friend crepes stuffed with mushrooms, so many mushroom dishes  and other foodstuffs that you would find in establishments called milk bars and restaurants throughout Poland.. I have yet to find places outside of Chicago or Poland that capture this smorgasboard of deliciousness.. I must admit its tough to replicate.  

It would be great though if more of this type of food was occasionally represented on the menu in addition  to the staples and I think it would be awesome to have the staples, even if occasionally..be home made. (Although pierogis are time consuming... so maybe a piergoi making event? haha ) 

The other factor we noticed are the restaurant times - it seems that when you have a menu of sandwiches and hundreds of captive university students right across the bridge (one which is my boyfriend) - you would test out to see if a day here and there was worth to be open for lunch? 

All in all Sebi&#39;s bistro satisfied the comfort food craving. Id come back to drink and to try a special maybe around some holiday times."

They also have a pretty good selection of on-tap beer and after talking with, who I assume was the owner or manager, they are going to have a good selection of fine european brews available as well.

I rated it only 4 stars because my wife and I both thought the food was great, but we&#39;ve only sampled a selection and they are not officially open yet.

Very nice waitress named Olive. Pierogis were delish and so wasn&#39;t the creeps. Nice atmosphere and a gentle giant of a barkeep. We will be back very soon! Took away one star only because we were a little overwhelmed when we first arrived as Olive gave us the run down for the groupin before we had a chance to order drinks and settle in.

The reason I can&#39;t give it a better rating was the service.  They were out of both the beer that I ordered and the wine that my date ordered.  The waiter wasn&#39;t aware of this when we ordered and only told us after we waited for a while. 

The other problem was the pretzel appetizer.  They aren&#39;t pretzel-like in any way; they seem to be jalapeño poppers with a side of mustard.  We asked a waitress if these were supposed to be pretzels and she didn&#39;t know. She referred us to our waiter who also had no clue what he had served us or why they were called pretzels."

A hidden gem that branches away from the standard &#34;Pub Food&#34; and pricing points found at most bars and restaurants in Seattle.    

Pros:

- Beyond fair pricing.  Finally a place where you can get a home made sandwich of any type for the same price as a foot-long at Subway.  $7 gets you a giant sandwich along with chips and kraut on the side.  $12... a Large Pizza.

- The staff.  Family owned and operated.  Friendly folks. How often can one go into an establishment (in Seattle) and actually speak to the Father, Mother (cook) and son (bartender), who also own the restaurant?  In Seattle?  Not often enough.

- The food.  Tried the Turkey, Bacon, Avacado Club, ($7 Full) and was beyond satisfied.  A LOT more food, along with 10x the quality of a Subway Foot long sandwich for THE EXACT SAME price.  Can&#39;t wait to try the authentic Polish food or the pizzas.

- The beer.  Full bar, with many import beers on tap.  

Cons:  

- The hours of operation.  While the menu states Sebi&#39;s Bistro&#39;s hours, this family establishment does not always adhere to them.  However, if they get the business, Sebi&#39;s will stay open later, keeping the food and drinks flowing..."

Some dishes they do very well, like the potato pancakes with meat stew sauce, pierogies are pretty good too. But the couple other things I have had there were a bit disappointing, like the schnitzel for example. Not quite up to par. The crepes that come with the sweet cheese filling tasted like they were filled with ricotta cheese, not the traditional polish farmers cheese, and that&#39;s a big deal for me. Over all, every time I go, I am not satisfied by the portion sizes, and for the price I would expect a bit more. They do have a couple of Polish and other European beers, which is cool.

The family that runs Sebi&#39;s is great; very welcoming and efficient.  This is not a fancy place and because it is not yet discovered by the hoards, it is quiet and intimate. 
 
I am planning on getting my girlfriends to meet up for Happy Hour and appetizers, The parking and a sure spot at a table is a great benefit to after work gatherings.

The cabbage rolls were nice, with a good sauce, and the kielbasa and meat pierogi were also quite tasty.  This is traditional food, done simply but done well, without a lot of extras.  

The prices are very reasonable for the portions (I would probably order the half size or split a full size entree next time. Hubby and I both took leftovers.)  I saw people at other tables with pizza and sandwiches that also smelled and looked really tasty.

We also tried the Potato and cheese perogi and it was OK. I have never had it before so I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect.

Overall food was good but the service was mediocre at best. The waitress may have just been having an off day but taking orders wasn&#39;t her best suit.

I liked that it was toasted ala panini (not greasy at all :) and that the pastrami was lean. But, there was one very thin slice of Swiss cheese and barely any sauerkraut.  Would like less bread and more s-kraut but overall tasty!  The sides were Gerken pickles and potato chips. Why not put a lovely pierogi on the plate to get folks to try something new?

My son ordered the schnitzel. Very plain -- both the meat and the potatoes - but just what he wanted and he loved it!. He gave me his sides which I enjoyed: the gerkens and pickled beets.

Though they have an intriguing assortment of (presumably) european beer, i opted for an old fave. I ordered a diet coke with whiskey back.  Got a Crown Royal. Only oddity was that the soda was served room temperature and no ice. 

They got busy with lots of customers so we waited for the tab. I was a little gruntled and the owner tried to make it right (loved that!). Took a few bucks off the tab and gave me a coupon for 15% off. We live just around the corner and can really use a good restaurant in the &#39;hood.

When I asked her, why this was not told to me for the last 30 minutes, her response was &#34;You can either wait or cancel the order&#34;. 

I understand that mistakes can happen, however, when you are at fault, you should at least respond with a basic &#34;Sorry, we messed this up&#34;. The tone of the server was as if I was at fault for the order.

It&#39;s near work so it&#39;s convenient for team lunches. Today we had a group of 7 and there was already a big crowd eating and waiting to be seated, so we wrote our name on the list. The crowd waiting inside was blocking the waitstaff and hostess&#39;s path, so our party stepped just outside the glass doors so they&#39;d have more room. We waited for 25 minutes--which was fine because we realized there was a line--and then they apparently called our name inside. Someone from another party waiting inside opened the door and asked if that was us. It was so we went in and told the hostess. She was angry that we weren&#39;t inside and crossed our name off the list and refused to seat us, even though the table was still open. We asked her reasonably several more times but she made it clear she wouldn&#39;t seat us and was very rude.

It&#39;s particularly frustrating because we had stepped outside to make it easier for them. Apparently they prefer that you stand in the middle of the aisles and block the waitresses&#39; path. Not planning to go back."

I don&#39;t like chicken.  their lunch menu offers chicken or tofu.. ($9).. if you want any other meat, u HAVE to buy the dinner menu - which is way large a portion for lunch, and it&#39;s ($16.xx).

On a prior visit they substituted beef for me, and upcharged me $1 or $2. perfectly reasonable.

Today they flat out refused.. apparently they never do this.. (well they did a few weeks back).
so it&#39;s chicken, tofu, or nearly double the cost.

Our food was good, but I was surprised it did not come with a side of rice. I also asked for mushrooms to be added to my order -- didn&#39;t realize that it cost an extra $1.50! Not worth it considering how few mushrooms were in the dish itself. The Thai iced tea was a bit on the sweet side.

Service was very quick and so polite. Every time I took a sip of my water they had my glass full again in no time. Food arrived very quickly as well. (+1 Star for the service!) The food was standard Thai food, nothing too exciting but we thought it was good (Average food = Average 3 Stars). I got the Pad See Ew and my boyfriend got the Yellow Curry, both with 3 stars spice and it was perfect for us. As with most places in this area, the menu cost was more expensive than what you&#39;d find elsewhere. 12-15 dollars per dish or around 20 for a meat entree.

On that same visit, my friend ordered tofu fried rice but got the chicken fried rice instead. Luckily, she&#39;s not a vegetarian, so to save time, she just ate the chicken version instead. The food portion was also quite small. I got Pad See Ew and the noodles were also a bit runny with too much liquid/sauce.

I also wonder how much crowd they get in the evening/weekends. I also hope this place can keep up with rent and is able stay open in the area. Their prices, while not cheap, are still affordable and reasonable for a lunch spot in SLU (1 meal + iced coffee is ~$13 excluding tips)."

We ordered Pad Prig King and Mongolian Beef with the Lime Chicken fried won tons as an appetizer. These were quite good, never had anything like it before. 

Update: ate here for lunch the next day. They have a limited lunch menu so was disappointed to not see our dishes from the prior night make the cut. It was packed at 12:30 but only had to wait about 15 mins for a table. Service was quick, spicy level needs work but I had them bring the spice tray and all was well then.

Any restaurant that restrict the number of credit cards per table will get at most neutral review. They just want to save a little bit transaction fees but caused lots of troubles for guests because then we need to keep track of the cost and find a way to pay each other.

The waitresses here was so rude and inpatient. The waitress who brought water to us simply put all cups together and we had to pass the cups to other people. Another waitress who took our order was very impatient, she moved to the next person before the current person finished ordering.

If you come here with a group you will notice that they get the food wrong about 1 out of 8 times. They seem to order everyone&#39;s food without attaching the order to a name or person. Instead they bring out the food and yell out the order hoping the right person will claim it. As there are no pictures on the menu people often don&#39;t know what they are getting and can claim the wrong dish. It is also difficult to hear in the loud atmosphere for your order, not to mention it makes it difficult to carry on a conversation while listening for your order so that they don&#39;t return it. This overall experience is particularly frustrating as groups have a mandatory 18% gratuity regardless of the food fiasco you put up with and they won&#39;t let you use more than 4 credit cards to pay it. Leaving it up to you to figure out how to split it in cash. Don&#39;t rely on them splitting it because they will divide it evenly. Which is wrong when not everyone&#39;s meal costs the same.

The first time was in the first week after they opened. The service was terrible - one of the members of my party didn&#39;t get his meal until after the rest of us had finished eating, and he wouldn&#39;t have gotten it all at if we hadn&#39;t reminded the waitress - she&#39;d *forgotten* his order. However, I was prepared to let that slide as it was a brand new restaurant. 

But the second time put me over the edge. Service was still pretty slow, but the coup de grace was a piece of PLASTIC in my food. The only thing worse than the unpleasant sensation of plastic in my mouth was their reaction. When I told the waitress, she stared at me blankly as if not sure why I was telling her this, then tentatively asked if I just wanted another dish. I said no, and eventually I got her to get the manager, who eventually gave me the meal for free. But during all of this, not a SINGLE apology. They didn&#39;t even seem to care. Completely inexcusable behavior.

I didn&#39;t even have a yelp account, I created it just so I could review this terrible restaurant."

This place has some amazing enchilada verdes!

Their enchilada verdes plate was enough to make me wanna move back to Beacon Hill again! 
My mom had 2 tacos (asada and veggie) and she had no complaints. Only compliments. 
Portions were generous that match the price.
Never before have I eaten anything other than cheese in my enchiladas...mine had chicken and man was that amazing!

I had a cold so I couldn&#39;t tell...but my mom said it has a weird smell inside...

The design inside was amazing. I love the warmth wood furniture and all give. The tables don&#39;t seem crowded like I&#39;d have to share my plate with a stranger.

I played it safe and ordered rice with beans, and fish tacos. Food came, I took a bite and went to heaven. The end.

The breading on the fish is crispy but never too much batter that it takes away from the well-cooked fish inside. The pickled apples and onions and tomatoes garnished on top were a sublime addition.

Especially for their extra large Tortas; go with the super jairo! You get a ton of food for 10$! I wanted to switch it up a little bit this time and got one of their specials, quesadilla with shrimp also 10$. To be honest, it was definitely a little basic, nothing but cheese and shrimp, served with a slice of watermelon and a small side salad. Completely forgettable, and if not for that this place would easily be a 5 star based on the torta alone.

Taste: 4/5
Like I stated previously, get the Torta, you won&#39;t be disappointed. Quesadilla was lacklaster.

Value: 4/5
Every plate is about 10$. I paid 16$ after tax and tip for the quesadilla and a HUGE horchata.

Decor:5/5

Came here for the first time and was quite impressed. Portions are generous and quality is very apparent. And with most items running $9.00 to $9.99 the price point can&#39;t be beat!

stuff tried

tacos de pescado- at a whopping $13.99, easily the most expensive thing of the night!  very nice quality fish and nice sauce. You get three with this order!

Huarches Norteno- this is topped with chorizo and nopales (cactus).  tasty!

pambazzo loco- a Hindenberg sized torta topped with some kind of red chili sauce and filled with ground meat and fixings.  Seriously, its about the size of an actual toddler. 

free tortilla chips are hot and fresh too!  

Probably the most unfortunate thing about this place is the hours.  Closing at 8pm is to me very sad and will limit my visits to this awesome place due to my more nocturnal feeding habits. More incentive to get there early!  also recommend making reservations as they can fill up quick!"

Located right off of Beacon Ave near the park, this place is pretty big with a restaurant section and a connected bar.  We were seated right away.  Service was good, though water refills had to be requested.  There was a large menu with tortas, enchiladas, tacos, quesedillas, etc.  They had several fillings, meat options and cactus.  We had the queso fundido with chorizo.  It came with four mini corn tortillas and lettuce &amp; pico de gallo.  It was pretty good, but the oil separated out really quickly and the cast iron skillet burned the bottom of the cheese so the dish ended up a grease filled frisbee before long.  I had chicken enchiladas verde and they were very good.  The verde sauce had just a little bit of kick.  The beans came in a corn tortilla bowl, nice touch.  The rice was moist and tasty.  Price wise, it&#39;s a bit on the spendier side...definitely not taco truck prices.  My lunch partner had a torta and you could choose french bread or a corn huarachas (?).  It was very large!

There is a bar to the left with some additional seating. It began to fill up as the night progressed. 
This place has a comfy feel with lit candles, dim lighting, rich dark wood and unique folk art work heavily scattered upon the walls.

The menu features Mexican favorites and Mexican breakfast served all day. We all ordered our food and the kitchen kept up in good timing fulfilling our enormous order. Everyone&#39;s food was hot and fresh upon arrival. 

The portions were decent as were the prices. No complaints there. The dishes were beautifully presented. Chips and salsa were good, too. Hot House made tortilla chips and unique smoky salsa. Not boring. 

The house margarita was okay, a bit weak. La Cachonda drink was very good! And the flan was rich, creamy, fluffy yet full and silky. I have never really liked flan, but this flan was an exception. 

Note: even though there is a full bar, I noticed that there were other groups with children 12 &amp; under. I think it&#39;s safe to deem  family friendly. At least before 9 or 10pm ;)"

I&#39;m giving them 5 stars because not only was the food great, but the service was amazing. The waiter was extremely helpful in suggesting what to get and didn&#39;t just tell us about the specials of the days, he gave his input and told us about each item and why he liked them. He had me sold as soon as he said steak nachos, so that was easy enough. My boyfriend got the Tortas, which included every meat they had plus egg. I&#39;m not sure of the name, but just ask for the one that has all the meat if you&#39;re interested.

It&#39;s very rare for my boyfriend to respond with &#34;YES&#34; when I ask if he likes what he&#39;s eating. It&#39;s always, &#34;It&#39;s cool&#34; or he shakes his head like it&#39;s alright. But trust me... For him to verbally say yes says a lot about what he&#39;s eating and he said &#34;yes&#34; when asked AND made several comments about how good my food was that he kept stealing off of my plate.

From the chips and salsa with the house Margarita to the birthday cake at the end and everything in between was very good.  I had the Chili Verde and it had huge chunks of port that were so tender that they melted in your mouth.  Verde sauce was spicy and flavorful.  

I&#39;m looking forward to going back again, for sure."

They take orders out of order, meaning someone arriving after you will be served before you. The servers will forget your order or give it to someone else. Silverware and napkins are a luxury here. Its about a ten minute wait to get utensils after getting your food. You will never get a second drink- servers forget about you. 
But man on man! Once you take a bite of the food- seriously, anything you order- you forget everything. Yes, it is that good! That&#39;s why this place gets 3 stars from me. I&#39;m assuming its really the food that keeps this place open."

It took at least 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order and the place wasn&#39;t busy at all. The food is actually pretty decent, which lead us to go back and give it another try last night. Again, the service was even worse than the time before. The server brought us our food while talking on his cell phone! The server also kept going out the back door and leaving the door open and my boyfriend had to get up and shut it each time because it was freezing outside and I kept my coat on the entire time. The server was more interested in flirting with the girls sitting at the bar. He never checked on us or asked us for a drink refill. I can&#39;t speak for the restaurant part, but we were terribly disappointed with the bar side. We will not be going back."

If I could, I would definitely put down El Quetzal as one of my &#34;accomplishments.&#34; The Tortas Gigantes sandwiches are HUGE here, so the name isn&#39;t a misnomer :)

I&#39;ve only had experience with the vegetarian Torta with mushrooms a couple times: avocado (blasted avocado in everything...) onions, tomatoes, refried beans, jalapenos--it basically looks like a 7-layer bean dip up in there--on bread the size and shape of medium round loaf of sourdough at the bakery. Mexican torta bread isn&#39;t a crazy gourmet bread; it&#39;s just a method to transport spices and filling into your mouth, so artisan bread+torta bread=unicorn. But I don&#39;t live in a fairy tale, so that&#39;s all good by me!

When sitting in, they start you off with warm, deep-golden yellow corn chips that are salted perfectly. I can&#39;t remember the brand that they use, but it&#39;s one of my favorites. The salsa is eh, but it has a little kick. 

Recently, I also ordered the chicken quesadilla, served on an PIZZA-DOUGH-sized corn tortilla; it filled up the entire oblong large dinner plate it rested on. Chicken, lettuce, tomato, cheese, folded like an omelette. It was really tasty; the corn tortilla was pliable and flavorful--if a little hard to manage eating without looking like Chris Farley. 

And.. I guess I should tell you that I ate all of the 3 things by myself in one sitting the other day. I DID bring home a little bit of the sandwich, but ate it too within the hour. Check them out! And don&#39;t feel like you have to eat it all in one sitting."

What drew me to this place were their homemade huaraches. I tried the steak skirt huarache and only regret that I didn&#39;t have room to finish it all! I also tried the carne asada and spicy pork tacos and enjoyed every bite.

Their ambiance is awesome and gives an energetic and relaxing vibe at the same time. The decorations are pretty cool too; many different kinds of Suns are all along the walls (I read somewhere in the restaurant that Quetzal is symbolized by the Sun?).

This is a restaurant and bar along Beacon Avenue--a little stretch of road undergoing a renaissance that never ceases to amaze me, and never ceases to cause me to unceasingly blather on about what a great renaissance it&#39;s undergoing. El Quetzal is definitely a big part of the mix. 

They have an appealingly dim little bar with a full coterie of cocktails and whatnot, including some draft beers with emphasis on Mexican exports. Pacifico is a solid choice, and drinking one out of that longneck bottle makes you feel like it must be summertime somewhere close by. 

The star attraction without a doubt is the food. They have a couple pages of stuff on the menu, and evidently their tortas are especially infamous. They usually have a few specials on as well. Last night I had the carne del puerco, which was amazing. Long, slow-roasted pork with really dense and still-bright seasonings and plenty of vegetables. The bones just slipped out with no trace of meat left on them. So tender and juicy. You get beans, rice, tortillas, and chips with that...just to make sure your daily starch needs are met.

The staff here is really friendly and really cool--they know the menu cold, and they clearly love the food they&#39;re serving. I&#39;ll definitely be back again and again."

I was craving Mexican food and was too lazy to drive anywhere outside my current location which was Beacon Hill so I just decided to look up restaurants in this area and thought to give it a shot since it had good reviews.

I followed the directions on my GPS and even though it&#39;s street parking, it was still super easy because if you just turn into the residential areas, there&#39;s a numerous amount of free parking also. The place itself didn&#39;t look too inviting on the outside, but I thought that it has to have good food to have good reviews so I went ahead inside to see what it&#39;s like. There&#39;s a dine-in side &amp; bar side, we sat at the bar which was kind of dark, but whatever. There was only one server for the whole bar side which was why service was kind of slow, but it was acceptable in my opinion because it was busy for one person to handle. Service was fine when we did receive attention, the girl was sweet.

We were kind of grumpy since we were hungry and it was taking a bit long, but when it came out, we were both pretty impressed! The presentation of both dishes were amazing and it tasted amazing as well. All that grumpiness just automatically went away because of the food. I had the enchiladas, it sure did fill me up &amp; there was a cute watermelon on the side of the plate. My buddy ordered something that I could not remember the name, but it was delicious as well. Both dish was so good that we had to order an additional one even though we were both pretty full. I would add this place as one of those &#34;hidden gem&#34;;sketchy on the outside, awesome discovery once you dig in!"

Overall the food was really delicious - I had the Me Vera Llorar, which I would certainly order again. 

The food really wasn&#39;t the issue, it was the service which was slow and inattentive at best. The restaurant wasn&#39;t that busy. 

We dined in the outside patio, and it seemed like our server either forgot about everyone on the the patio or maybe they didn&#39;t care. In either case, we didn&#39;t get an refills on our water, soda, or chips. Our server never returned to check on us after bringing out our food, and in the end we had to hunt him down just to pay the check.

Sandwiches are a high point, and you&#39;ll have a hard time finishing them in one sitting. And their Pollo Machin is a thing of wonder and delight. It&#39;s more like a spicy chicken omelete in a corn tortilla than it is the usual pressed flat quesadilla.

Back to the menu, it had a nice diverse selection, including breakfast options, which I don&#39;t see in most places.

Your server will typically be the owner&#39;s son, cousin or some sort of blood relative. Their fish tacos are FANTASTIC. Now don&#39;t go in there expecting some blah grilled fish taco with no flavor. Their fish tacos are fried and topped with apple slaw. I know that can sound weird but trust me on this one, you&#39;ll love it. It&#39;s gives you all the fish taco goodness with a delightful refreshing crunch.

My boyfriend&#39;s usual is the enchilada verde. He loves it so much that he doesn&#39;t even bother with anything else on the menu... except for bites of my fish taco."

Order yourself a horchata or a tamarindo juice...it&#39;s not just a small cup, you&#39;ll practically get a jug and every sip is incredible. 

I went here for lunch recently with my eating buddy and we both ordered the Tacos de Pescado (Fish Tacos) Are you kidding me!? Those were some of the best fish tacos ever. Lightly breaded fish covered in pico de gallo and slices of green apples for a crisp finish...all wrapped in a warm flour tortilla. The flavor is spectacular. 

I&#39;m looking forward to going back and trying more of their entrees. I was definitely impressed. Service is fine too."

We splurged on a mid-afternoon margarita, which was awesome - highly recommend!  Then we discovered the torta section on the menu, and wow!  Definitely one of the best tortas I&#39;ve ever had, and huuuuuuuuge.  I was sort of blown away by the bread, which was fluffy and super and fresh, but still a little crispy on the outside.  The inside was packed with avocados, onions and beans, in addition to the meat of your choice, and comes with chipotle sauce and/or jalapenos.

Chips are good, and service was awesome.  I&#39;m already thinking about my next torta."

Great chefs, fantastic fresh seafood, and stunning waterfront views to go with meals at any time of the day. All this said I think the city is severely lacking in quality and authentic Mexican food. I would easily and sooner take a flight to LA than eat at most of the Tex-Mex at best places in Seattle. It might be because of the lack of options but El Quetzal had me from the get go. Hearty portion sizes and very flavorful dishes make for a lunch or dinner that is sure to leave you satisfied and wanting to come back and explore more of the menu. I had the flank steak and cactus. Interesting dish in that I thought the cactus was so flavorful and really wasn&#39;t let be a center piece of the dish as the steak was so underwhelming and seemed to just be a filler protein. Chips and salsa are so important to a typical Mexican restaurant meal I think and their house chips and salsa was great. I would have this place in my top three to take anyone visiting from out of town who was in the mood for Mexican food or a margarita."

It was more the fact that I just couldn&#39;t quite think of how to adequately capture the unique experience I had.

Margaritas from pint glasses? Yep.

Mountainous quesadillas that I tried to eat all of? Absolutely?

A dingy bar feel, with clear indications that salsa is meant to be danced in this place? You bet.

I think what I liked about El Quetzal is that it wasn&#39;t trying to be high-end. It&#39;s like they said, let us do what we do well, and leave the rest to those fools competing in more Mexican-restaurant populated areas. Beacon Hill seems to be underserved by this kind of place, and I&#39;m glad to have wandered far enough from home for it.

I imagine they would not only have your standard tequilas, but perhaps a few house secrets they&#39;d be willing to share--either in cocktails or in brands. I can&#39;t speak for certain, but it has that kind of aura about the place. Maybe it&#39;s worth becoming regulars here..."

Thus, I ordered the Nopales Con Huevos (cactus with Eggs), with corn tortillas. 

For my first time ever eating cactus, I found that I absolutely adored the dish. The cactus was moist and tangy, it complimented the eggs well, and the tortillas were warm. So were the refried beans. It tasted like fresh ingredients were used in the dish. 

I&#39;m definitely going back, as I loved this dish (and it&#39;s preparation) so much! And the restaurant!"

But I have to say El Quetzal&#39;s smoky red salsa served with the fresh tortilla chips was delicious and actually identical to some that my mother-in-law gave to me just the other day.

Speaking of the salsas, El Quetzal served a different red salsa with my tacos and yet another kind of (green) salsa with my quesadilla.

I was surprised how busy the restaurant was last night - filled with hipsters, yuppies, young Latinos and *at least* one yeep.  The interior was very simple, with sunbursts of varying design lining one wall.  

The service I received was excellent.  Interestingly, I received and finished my dinner before people who had arrived earlier than me even began to receive their orders.  I ordered two tacos and a Quesadilla Picadilla.  I had wanted Carnita tacos, but they were out, so I settled for chorizo.  

Goodness gracious, while tasty, the chorizo was the most brilliant red I&#39;ve ever seen (aside from a certain taco cart on Stark St. in Outer Southeast Portland).  Re the quesadilla, let me just say I would have used different techniques for its preparation.  Based on the menu&#39;s description, I anticipated the filling to be something like Shepherd&#39;s Pie:  ground beef, onion, cheese and mashed potatoes.

What came to my table was a partially folded deep-fat-fried tortilla dripping in grease.   Inside the tortilla was the expected ground beef, onion and crumbled (queso fresco) cheese.  But also, there was shredded lettuce.  You can imagine what the heat of the meat and the deep-fat-fried tortilla does to the lettuce.  Warm wilted lettuce is generally not terribly appetizing.   The overwhelming grease only allowed me to take a few bites before having to declare defeat.  The beef by itself was okay, but overall the flavor of the quesadilla was umm...exotic.  Also, the mashed potatoes were missing.

Now, if you want some truly divine picadillo, simply step over to Kusina Filipina, which is a mere two doors down from El Quetzal.

Epilogue:  it is really true that some food is better the next day.  I reheated my leftover picadillo...and you know what?  It was actually really good (eaten with my mum&#39;s salsa, of course)."

My tacos arrived; fried fish topped with fresh cut apple, onion, and cilantro salad.  The visual was fantastic, and added to the fact that these tacos taste phenomenal!  I left truly satisfied and even ordered a side of chips and salsa to bring home to share.

Only misses the 5 star rating because of the techno/dance music playing in a small, quiet, authentic, neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  It didn&#39;t make sense and actually got on my nerves a little.  Change the station. :-)

Gotta try a pambazo or torta next time.

Chips/Salsa - Chips tasted store bought with way too much salt. Salsa was also very salty, and more spice than flavor.
Enchiladas - Chicken covered with verde sauce. Spicy, full of flavor. Really tasty!
Rice - mushy, filled with bits of corn and peas... very odd
Beans - almost a watered down consistency. No whole beans in there at all.

It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve come here so we were excited to go get our fresh waffles. We live a bit away so we are making a special trip to come here.  So Sunday morning we get in our car and head here.  We walk in and there is only one person there, super quiet which is fine with me.  It seems the owner is behind the counter and is having a friendly conversation with the patron.  We walk up and we know what we want.  We order four waffles and he let&#39;s us know that he just sold out and would be 13 minutes.  Again, fine by us since we&#39;ve drove for a while.  I also order a vanilla latte and my husband orders a tea.  He makes my husbands tea and haves him grab the tea for him since it&#39;s on the front of the espresso machine, NBD.  The weird thing is that he touches the tea bag with his bare hands.  I don&#39;t know why this bugged me but it did.  I guess I&#39;m used to Starbucks using tongs. When going to a small café I usually order a vanilla latte to gauge the quality of the coffee and their flavoring.  I must be a bit of a coffee snob but I guess I have high expectations with a small neighborhood coffee shop that you shouldn&#39;t use Torani or Da Vinci flavoring.  I understand you have to keep costs down but when it comes to vanilla and your chocolate (please no Hershey&#39;s), spend a touch more and it will go a long way.  My latte was ok, nothing special.  Hubby&#39;s tea was good.  So the patron leaves and the guy behind the counter does not say ONE WORD to us the whole time he is making our waffles.  It was kind of awkward.  Anyhoo, we are planning on staying and eating because we have driven all the way here until he hands us a bag with our waffles....awkward....... So we get in our car and head to the Arboretum it&#39;s only a minute away and a beautiful place.  We grab our waffles and look at them and they don&#39;t look like they used to.  We bite in to them and there is hardly and flavor and chunks of hard raw sugar in them that haven&#39;t cooked/melted to give them and hint of sweet that they used to have.

Paid over $18 for everything.

Oh well.  We tried.  Maybe it was an off day?  Probably will never be back.  I understand that there is another place down the road that has the same name and small waffles.  Which is odd.  Maybe it&#39;s the old owners?  I have no clue but we will get them a try next time we take the journey."

The staff are super friendly and when I worked in the same building a few years ago, they let us work on a tab-system where we would bring open checks for $25 or so at a time and just debit from it.  It was very convient and nice of them to offer that for us who wanted to stop in quickly on coffee breaks. 

Parking is always tight in front of the cafe, but when a spot is open, its super convenient!"

I&#39;ve had at least two waffles in each city. I know a good Belgium desert waffle when I eat one. The light fluffy Belgium waffles my mom used to make? Not Belgium waffles. The waffles Arosa makes?  Not Belgium waffles.  In fairness, they don&#39;t call them Belgium waffles, they call them &#34;Snack Waffles&#34; - but it&#39;s pretty obvious what they are going for.  What they have achieved are rather cakey waffles with a sugar/cinnamon coat. Not totally un-tasty, but not what I expected from a place who specializes in waffles.  I&#39;m pretty sure I won&#39;t be getting cravings for them. 

The coffee is ok.  I&#39;ve had it twice.  The first time I ordered a medium, and found my Americano a bit too weak (too few shots for the amount of water).  The second time, more shots, and despite cream it was a little burnt tasting and somewhat more acidic than I normally find espresso to be, but certainly not horrible - I&#39;ll probably get another cup if I&#39;m in the mood next time I&#39;m in the neighborhood.

The two times I&#39;ve been there, the service has been excellent.  Very friendly, a little chatty - nice girls (I don&#39;t know if guys work there, so if there are, I&#39;m sure they are nice as well).  The place isn&#39;t huge, but warm, enough seating for the shopping center it is in, and clean."

1)  I drink a lot of coffee from a lot of places.
2)  I drink Starbucks coffee and don&#39;t hate it.
3)  I don&#39;t typically enjoy sweet things (for example, plain croissants over chocolate)
4)  Michelle, the owner of Arosa is a wonderful family friend.  So yes, I am biased.

With all of the above said, I will still shout from the rooftops that Arosa is by far, my favorite coffee shop and think that people should listen.

I love that whenever I stop by, I see Michelle greeting other customers with the same energy and familiarity as when she sees me.  She always seems genuinely happy to see anyone who walks in the door and welcomes them with a cheery, warm smile.  I think she and her baristas are a big part of why people keep coming to Arosa. 

Besides the great coffee and treats, that is.  My coffee shop drink is an americano, which I usually top off with a little cream and a Splenda anywhere I go.  Arosa americanos don&#39;t even need the extra.  The coffee is flavorful and fresh.  Just like you&#39;d expect from a local coffee shop who takes a little care when making their espresso.

And get a waffle.  

For crying out loud, GET A WAFFLE.  Rumor has it the maple crystals they use come from Switzerland.  You can&#39;t find waffles like that anywhere and if you&#39;re lucky enough to get one hot off the griddle, enjoy it, because you&#39;ll want to come back for more. 

There&#39;s tons of parking available to stop by and the shop is right off of Madison and Lake Washington Blvd -- easy to swing by if you&#39;re near there and/or on your way to 520.  

I already admitted to my bias of why I like this place but it truly is a terrific cup of coffee and breakfast with a side of sunshine."

I could overlook high prices and even mediocre products when the service dazzles.

Fortunately,  you don&#39;t have to sacrifice a thing at Arosa Cafe in Madison Park.  The prices are average, the coffee is good, and the service is stellar.  The owner, Michelle, is the perfect local business owner, working behind the counter, greeting people by name,  and starting their orders the minute they walk in the door.  Warmly engaging each customer and thoughtfully remembering the minutiae of their lives, she gives away something you just can&#39;t buy...the DESIRE to be a regular.

It&#39;s strange.  Arosa is about a block from my house, and I never felt compelled to go until a year ago.  Seattle offers about 152 places per square mile to buy excellent coffee, so picking a favorite is a multi-faceted endeavor.  Proximity is important, quality matters, prices probably don&#39;t even show up on most addict&#39;s radar, but service reigns supreme.  Loyalty is the name of the game in this town, and people resist venturing far from their favorites.

I had my faves, but only an uptight social misfit would refuse to leave the confines of their comfort zone when someone else invites them to try someplace new. (You know who you are!)

Needless to say, I was taken by the comfortable ambiance inside Arosa, and couldn&#39;t resist the power of local neighborhood conversation, the language spoken here.  Agnes, the cheerful, engaging barista who remembered my name, my kids&#39; names and where I went on vacation, sealed my fate as an Arosa-loyalist.

And if all of the above weren&#39;t enough, (**insert Cheers lyrics) then did I mention homemade waffles??  Michelle makes the dough fresh daily, and grills them up on a waffle maker in the store.  They are the kind of treat you eat with your hands, like a doughnut...sweet, sticky, warm.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...........ain&#39;t nothin&#39; like hot coffee and a waffle.

Where everybody knows your name,
and they&#39;re always glad you came.

Food:
I ordered the Kimchi Jjigae (Kimchi Stew) and it came with my choice of 2 sides (Options being white/brown rice, miso soup, french fries, or salad) which I chose brown rice and french fries.
The kimchi stew was delicious!! well thats saying from an asian&#39;s point of view since they do you a very generous amount of kimchi so there is a very strong fermented smell and taste to it which is very true to authentic kimchi stew.  Just saying that some people might not be able to handle the pungency if they haven&#39;t had authentic asian food before.  

Just as a side note, the fries were a pleasant surprise.  They actually were quite yummy.  Cut in shoelace style and freshly fried thus were very crunchy and piping hot.

Ambience:
It is located right across from the Safeway.  It looks kinda sketchy from the outside but don&#39;t let that deter you from trying this place out.  The inside is actually quite clean and well decorated with modern art.  

Service:
I went at a very odd time of 3:30pm so there was only one person working thhe floor at the time so I can&#39;t advocate for the entire store but my specific waitress was very kind.

When I came here last time, I had some trouble parking because there is very limited street parking.  I called the restaurant to see if I could park in the Cedar&#39;s parking lot or Safeway&#39;s.  You&#39;re not allowed to so don&#39;t bother.  He said that there was street parking but was unspecific as to where so it kind of made me frustrated because I ended up driving around looking for parking.

The restaurant in itself is very clean. The service is rather efficient.  Our waiter was very prompt in taking our orders, refilling water, and giving us the check, without rushing us.  Perfect service.

The food was decent.  Their fried chicken was delicious and portions were huge.  I almost regretted not order the fried chicken.  However, what I ordered was tasty too.  I got the katsu chicken curry.  It was tasty but not as yummy as the fried chicken.  Get the chicken if you come here.  I was a little turned off that rice was considered a &#34;side&#34; dish.  If you have two &#34;sides&#34; you end up needing to order rice and something else.  They should just say rice and fried chicken and offer you one &#34;side.&#34; That way, you don&#39;t get customers&#39; expectations up that you can&#39;t order fries, salad, or soup.

The waitress really took her time coming over to take our order, bring us the food, and bring us the bill. We got the mochiko chicken and takoyaki. Mochiko chicken was just a plate of not fresh, rubbery chicken, fried and dipped in overly salty sauce. Takoyaki was five parts batter and one part octopus, and it came out after the mochiko chicken even though that was the entree and takoyaki was the appetizer.

I entered around lunch time on a Friday afternoon, and was not surprised to see very few other guests. I was even allowed to choose my seat, so I sat near the window and enjoyed the views of Safeway across the street. (It was still a beautiful day outside though, so the sun was shining nicely)
The menu was a little overwhelming at first because there were so many words and no distractions (like pictures), but a glance at the &#34;specials&#34; board helped me finalize my meal selection. I decided to go with the chicken katsu and gyoza combo that is served with 2 sides. At first I wanted a salad and miso soup, but the waiter actually suggested I get rice instead with the entree I ordered, and I appreciated his advice when I actually started eating my meal. 
The star of the show was definitely the chicken katsu. Flavorful, juicy, and not at all greasy, the chicken was just so much more than I expected. Paired with a tasty sauce, and the rice, I was so very pleased. The salad was served with a somewhat sweet dressing, and the coolness went well with my quite warm meal. 
The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because I did not care too much for the gyoza. I did not feel anything special from it, but I did appreciate the crispiness of the shell on these dumplings. Now the taste was not bad, just not outstanding either.

My go-to is the chicken katsu - and I love that I can get a combo with gyoza for just 50 cents more. The breading is perfectly crisp with nice flavor and the sauce is on point to say the least.

I&#39;ve only ever ordered to go during lunch, but would definitely dine-in if I were ever in the area crazing some yaki or katsu!"

The mochiko chicken was fried well and tasted great - with a slight sweetness. Definitely would order this next time again. In addition, we also shared the pork katsu lunch special with brown rice, gyoza and salad. The pork katsu was fried nicely as well, but the gyoza was your typical gyoza (nothing special there). We also had wished we got the yakisoba that another guy sitting next to us had ordered, since it smelled great and looked quite share-able. 

It was nice to be able to watch a football game on a big screen on the wall while we ate and the art on the walls was nice to look at.

The staff seemed super nice while we were there. A few people came in for take-out orders, which seems to be a popular choice. I am planning on doing so one of these days I&#39;m really hungry for dinner."

It was Friday night and the waitress completely forgot about our table and we were waiting for way too long to order. So, my BF decides to go up to the counter to order. The little dick working at the bar tells him to go back to his table and rolls his eyes at him when my BF turned his back. He was totally embarrassed when he realized I was watching him the whole time. What do you expect us to do when you haven&#39;t taken our order for 10 mins?"

It was really busy and only one table was opened and we were lucky to get it. Our water and menus were presented to us in less than 30 seconds and our waiter came to get our orders in about 10 minutes at most. Everything came out at a decent amount of time; our sides/apps of course came first then our entrees. We had ordered our entrees w rice and fries and one takoyaki and a side of kimchi. Sides came out, entrees came out around 10 minutes after. The portions are also really good and the price is inexpensive! The server was really attentive towards us and other tables, asking us if we were okay and kept refilling our waters which weren&#39;t even that empty, nice! The bill came out to be really not that expensive at all, which I was surprised since I had ordered a lot. 

Will recommend this place :)"

The short ribs and beef in the noodles were awesome! I&#39;m always a fan of korean bbq styled meats, and this was delicious. Would recommend the short ribs for sure. The tofu soup was alright, the flavor was very tomato-y and not what I was expecting.

I ordered the katsu curry special (which also came with a side of fries!) and he ordered the bulgogi. They were both huge! It was like a whole pan of meat for the bulgogi, and a little tub of rice. Plus there was soup. 

The katsu curry was a huge plate of rice with the biggest piece of katsu I&#39;ve ever seen. I would have liked to have more curry sauce with the meal, but it was still very tasty. The fries were super crispy and I wish it came with curry sauce to dip instead of ketchup, but anyway...!

The staff were super friendly and we were checked on regularly.

It&#39;s very affordable and for two people it was under $30 (without drinks). The portions were pretty big so it&#39;s basically getting 4 meals for two people for that price.

There was only one other person eating there when we arrived. I ordered the combo, Katsu + tempura with rice and miso soup as the sides. The miso soup came right away in a typical sized bowl and tasted delicious. It might have been more flavourful than my main dish itself. 

Our food came shortly after. I was really impressed with the portions; they don&#39;t hold back at all. For your typical eater, the portions leaned towards 2-meals worth of food. The tempura, which came with tempura sauce, consisted of one or two shrimp while the rest were vegetables. The Katsu came with sauce on the side as well. They both tasted normal and good, nothing out of the ordinary (thus my 4-star rating). Everything was served with a large scoop of rice that even I could barely finish."

The difference between chicken teriyaki was about $1.50 so I went with the larger size which came with sides. My dining partner went with the half size and we both thought that was enough food. Their musubi was good but it was just one big piece and not cut up to share. It could have easily been three or four pieces if cut properly.

If you want to be loaded up with some HUGE portions of chicken teriyaki then go with the large. I took mine to go as I couldn&#39;t even get through half of what was given to me. Snacks for later are always good.

The place is a modern experience for Korean / Japanese / (Hawaiian?)  food and the environment and service is pretty good. The portions are quite large as well, which is generally pretty favorable, especially for a university environment. For the food though, I ended up having the fried rice and while I liked it, I didn&#39;t find it to be anything very special.

We ordered the spam musubi - which had a little too much rice to meat ratio. But still delicious nonetheless - I just didn&#39;t eat all of the rice. 

My husband ordered the garlic shrimp with rice. The restaurant has large (I mean LARGE) portions. The shrimp was well cooked and sautéed with butter &amp; garlic. The butter soaked into the rice and made a delicious meal!

I ordered the mochiko chicken (seemingly their specialty). I was a bit disappointed by the chicken. Was way over battered and a bit too sweet for my taste. I can see how people like this dish because it can be addicting, but just not for me.

They have bottles of the sauce on the tables if you need more. We also had the spicy pork bulgogi and an order of the Tuna Poke (which was an appetizer but actually came out after the other dishes). The pork was tasty but not overly spicy. A little fatty but hey, it&#39;s pork. I think I liked the beef slightly better. The poke was fab - I could eat that stuff all day.

The portions were HUGE and totally worth what you pay. The salad dressing is apparently handmade by the chef, I really commend them on that. It was a sort of Japanese sesame miso dressing which tastes infinitely better than the stuff you buy at the store. Wish they had a happy hour, I bet that would definitely bring in more people. They also have a grand opening sign outside but they&#39;ve been open for awhile, with no grand opening specials.

Service: Terrific service but then again, there wasn&#39;t a single other group in the restaurant. So we basically gave them something to do!

I ended up ordering the special for the day which was chicken katsu and gyoza. I added an egg on top of my rice and subbed white rice for brown. When the food came out it looked amazing.

The perfect amount of crunch for the chicken katsu. I personally would&#39;ve liked a bit more curry over the rice, but nonetheless, this meal was very satisfying. I also got to try a bit of the Mochiko Chicken my friend ordered. Perfectly cooked chicken and not overly breaded.

I didn&#39;t know that this was a Japanese Hawaiian fusion place, so I was a bit amused when I heard that they were playing Hawaiian music in the background. But hey, it works! 

My friends and I ordered the Poke as an app, the Loco Moco, Mochiko Chicken, and Teriyaki Chicken. Each dish was under $15, but man the portions are huge! Not only are the portions big, but the food was solid too. I thought the poke was pretty good and tasted fresh, and I like the fact that they added a bunch of onions on it, because I love onions! I&#39;ve never had Mochiko chicken until I came here. Supposedly it&#39;s chicken wrapped with mochi, and just tastes a little sweet when you bite into it. I know it sounds weird, but it&#39;s not a thick layer of mochi around the chicken and it actually tastes good! The teriyaki chicken is just like any other teriyaki chicken, but it definitely wasn&#39;t dry. Again, the portion was huge considering the what you pay for it. I got the Loco Moco and it&#39;s definitely one of the better Loco Mocos I&#39;ve had. The steak was flavorful, and the gravy went well with the sunny side up egg :)

I opted for all chicken breast which was like a $1 more. My stomach needs the best, ya know? 

The salad dressing was yummy and a good appetizer before the main dish. And as I expected, the plate was huge. Definitely enough for two people or as a second meal. I had a bet with my friend to see if I can finish the whole plate but unfortunately I lost. My stomach couldn&#39;t handle it anymore haha.

The other dish we ordered was the loco moco. I&#39;ve not actually had it before but it&#39;s basically gravy on top of hamburger patties/fried eggs on top of a ton of rice. Talk about filling..... We ended up finishing this dish between the two of us, though with some regrets on my part at least... Gravy was interesting, not sure what the dish was supposed to taste like but it was good not amazing. Lastly, definitely get the SPAM MUSUBI.

My husband ordered Tempura and Katsu combo. While the meal portion was big, some details were missing. For example, there was no grated daikon (Japanese white radish) that you can put in the tempura dipping sauce.

The bar stool I was sat on was pretty unstable and wobbly and made me kept worrying that it would break and fall over. 
 
I got the &#34;beef &amp; gyoza&#34; combo ($14) and it was pretty average. The gyoza&#39;s were pretty tasty but perhaps a little over-fried. The beef was kinda tough and chewy and the marinade wasn&#39;t very memorable. The miso soup that came with the combo was decent however, but it&#39;s hard to really go wrong here. 
 
Given that there are nearby Asian restaurants that serve better tasting food for cheaper, I&#39;d recommend you go elsewhere."

PORTIONS!

My boyfriend loves their chicken breast teriyaki; he is a picky chicken eater with a monstrous appetite (honey- no offense) and their servings more than satisfy him. They used to have fried eggs as an option for a side but now, you have to pay $1.

Beef teriyaki is almost jerky-like (meh) but still a big portion. Spicy pork is yummy but expensive. The young male server with a cap is always vivacious and attentive. When you take out food, the sauces leak all over the plastic bags."

It finally paid off to be a true Yelper! I left this place with my smile going from ear to ear. 

My boyfriend and I headed up to Seattle to visit my friend who was oh so lonely! we decided to head out and grab dinner on an adventure to wherever we ended up at. 

We looked left and right but eventually landed at this place called &#39;Itadakimasu&#39; now that is a cute name for a restaurant! Having taken Japanese for 3 years and knowing what it actually means, I was super excited! When I hear the word &#39;Itadakimasu&#39; combined with great food... that brings joy to me! 

Looking at the menu, I was like hmmm the items look pretty ordinary to me. I didn&#39;t know what to go for! A guy comes to our table and introduces himself and I introduce myself as a fellow Yelper who loves good food and trying new places! I told him to be expecting a review from me in a bit after I leave haha. He confidently says he is the owner and tells me to choose any item off the Appetizer menu and says it is &#39;on the house&#39;! I was like aww, thank you so much! But that&#39;s not where it ends. After all, he is the owner right? He created the menu and food himself so I throw him a curveball and ask him to surprise us with something rather than me choosing.

He brings the Tuna Poke and I am astonished at the fact that he chose that one because I was eyeing that appetizer since I first laid my eyes on the menu. I love tuna and poke sauce. What a coincidence C:

Besides, it was the most expensive on the appetizer list so I didn&#39;t want to be so bold to ask him to get that one for us anyways. It tasted really good! I mean the tuna was PLUMP and mmm, I wanted more haha. The size were cute blocky cubes and the sauce was delicious although it was a bit salty but overall good. That&#39;s only the appetizer!

I wanted to order a cocktail and he comes around and suggests a drink that isn&#39;t on the menu but created himself and I believe it was called something a long the lines of &#34;Moscow Mule Melon Goose&#34;? Yep, he was on a roll! Did not disappoint me so far. 

I ordered the Loco Moco with a side of fries. I have heard of the Loco Moco dish plenty of times in my life but never really appealed to me. Rice, fried eggs, and hamburger patties? Uh... where am I again? I won&#39;t lie, Loco Moco itself is exactly what I expected- not up to my taste buds. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the one here was pretty good for my first try at a Loco Moco although I have none to compare it to. 

However, the Sweet and Sour (that every knows) dish that my friend ordered was definitely appealing to my tastebuds! I liked it very much. I&#39;ve worked at a Chinese restaurant before in LA and worked at a teriyaki shop so I had my fair share of Sweet and Sour dishes. It was one of the best I have tried.

Besides, Mike proudly admitted his dishes are quite delicious and better than most of the common dishes out there at other restaurants. He should be proud! I can&#39;t wait to go back and try out his other dishes!"

The servers are all personable and accommodating. The menu is simple and easy to navigate. They are very generous with the portions in every meal. I would even venture to say most of their entrees are enough to feed two people, so be careful not to over-order. Also, it&#39;s one of the few places on or near the Ave that sells curry katsu, and it is really good here.

Again, the vibe inside the restaurant is very nice, but  the interior is relatively small and it can get pretty crowded around dinner time. And like most restaurants, there is a small but noticeable trade-off between the quality of each dish and its quantity. In other words, each entree I&#39;ve tried is pretty darn good but there&#39;s nothing here to write home about, which is fine because of how much food they give you. All things considered, this is one of my favorite places to go to in the U-district. I would definitely recommend it."

I can&#39;t speak highly enough about this, because normally when you get massive portions you compromise on flavor. This is NOT the case here. Also, their salad dressing is one of the best I&#39;ve had with Teriyaki, and call me weird, but it really brings the experience together.

Food: One of the better takoyakis that I&#39;ve had. Although I wish it had more sauce. The portions are like 1.5-2x that of what I would eat. Lots of take home. Loco moco was ok, I&#39;m not usually a big fan of the dish normally but the patties are house made so that&#39;s a plus. Mochiko chicken was nicely battered. Though I wish there was a sauce to dip it with because it felt necessary. I ended up using ketchup. Everything we ordered was pretty heavy though.

Prices: pretty cheap. The entrees are roughly $8-$9 for huge portions. Total with tax was only $30.

Even a big eater can make 2 large meals out of the full portions - not only do they provide you with a pound of meat, but they also give you two very large sides.  I like the beef teriyaki, kalbi, and the loco moco.  The loco moco comes with two hamburger patties, lots of brown sauce, and two fried eggs (as well as one side).  It&#39;s tastier and better value than McDonald&#39;s.

About the food: the loco moco is bomb! Everything is made from scratch; the gravy and even the patty is handmade and perfectly seasoned -- none of that prepackaged hamburger patty crap! 

They have an awesome happy hour menu too! Definitely get the short ribs! Great quality and a great deal! I also got the gravy french fries...thought it was weird at first but the gravy is sooooo ono! 

The last time I came I got mochiko chichen. I&#39;ve definitely had better but for $4 on the hh menu, can&#39;t go wrong with that! Ordered the shochu melon ball and that was yummy (I love anything with midori or sake in in!) 

Another favorite: the katsu curry. The curry is Japanese style so it is subtly sweet, the veggies inside were tender, and the consistency wasn&#39;t too thin or thick. The katsu is delicious so combine the two and you get one amazing combo!

We called ahead to see if we could do a reservation last minute since we saw this place had really good reviews. I told my friends that if this place lives up to its reviews that I will write my review for them right away and not wait for months like I usually do.. Well I&#39;m writing a review right now so... Yes! It did live up to its 4.5 stars. 

We came in and was greeted right away by their wait staff. They were really nice, and our wait wasn&#39;t too long. We were a group of 12 so it was a good idea that we called. We were seated after two other parties left, and got our waters and drinks right away. The only wait time we had was getting our orders taken, but it&#39;s understandable since a few smaller groups came in right after us. I ordered the lychee martini which was delicious! If you likely fruity drinks this one is for you. The only thing is you can taste the alcohol more in this drink than other fruity martinis.  


Entrée:
I shared the Galbi entrée with my friend since we read that the portions were really big. We got white rice and fries with our entrée. I ordered a spam mushubi and salad on the side  because I like having veggies in my meals, and I l just likespam mushubi. My boyfriend ordered their mochiko chicken, and a few of my other f friends ordered their Katsu chicken and yakisoba. Everything was very good, and portion sizes were quite generous. I&#39;m glad I shared the galbi.  Of course hands down best dish goes to the mochiko chicken though. Katsu chicken was reallt good to. I&#39;m glad I got to eat both chicken dishes and the galbi.

Itadakimasu isn&#39;t brand new but is one of the newer restaurants near University District. If you&#39;re looking for Asian-Hawaiian fusion this is the place to go.

Itadakimasu is located closer to 50th street right across from the Safeway on Brooklyn avenue. It has an open bar with one bartender if that&#39;s your thing. There is also about 8 tables inside that can seat about 4 people per. One of the 8 tables is definitely big enough for about 8-10 people though so the restaurant can hold a relatively large party. There are about two servers roaming about taking orders and checking up on you.

We came on a weekend night around 7 pm. The place was pretty full but one table remained. We were promptly seated and then was given the menu. I love how simple and straight forward the menu. It is broken up into categories from pupas (appetizers), combo meals and signature items. The backside of the menu has all the drinks. Most of the items on the menu come with either a +1 or +2 side indication. The sides you can get are brown/white rice, miso soup, french fries or a fried egg. 

After taking some Yelp recommendations we ended up ordering some takoyaki, the katsu curry and the mochiko chicken. I got miso soup as my side and the partner got white rice and a side of fries. While waiting, we were given ice water and the server we had, who was very friendly, made sure that our water cups stayed full.

First came the miso soup. Like most miso soups, it&#39;s something that is difficult to mess up. The miso soup tasted just like miso soup should but I found it to be a bit on the saltier side than normal. However, I did like how it came in it&#39;s own cute little bowl and you got the lid with it. I was able to cover my soup to keep it warm throughout the meal.

Next came the takoyaki. You get 6 pieces and they are neatly organized with the takoyaki sauce on top (Worcestershire and mayonnaise like) along with dried bonito flakes (basically dried, smoked fish flakes). It was delicious. The outside was perfectly crisp without the interior blowing up with grease. There was enough octopus flavor on the inside (around 2 small pieces) and it was creamy and fragrant. The sauce on top was the perfect match for the takoyaki. The inside had the texture of creamy mashed potatoes and wasn&#39;t overpowering. It was simply well done.

The katsu curry and mochiko chicken came next. The first thing I thought to myself was &#34;This...is...HUGE.&#34; The portion size is ridiculous! There was a giant pool of rice and curry along with about 9 generous strips of katsu. The mochiko chicken was piled sky high and the side of rice was more than a bowl for sure. We were really excited to try these two things but the meal ended up tasting more ordinary than presented. First, the katsu curry, although raved on Yelp, was pretty generic. The curry is basically the Golden Curry box brand that you can buy at any Asian market. This is the same kind of curry that I&#39;m familiar with so I wasn&#39;t really taken aback. The katsu was very crisp on the outside and decently moist on the inside. However, the curry definitely made the pieces of katsu soggy and less enjoyable. As much as I love curry and katsu, I don&#39;t think I like them paired together. The mochiko chicken on the other hand was a complete shock. My partner and I really didn&#39;t know what to expect from this dish. The first bite was sweet. Mochiko chicken is made from a sweet batter, thus giving it a sweeter than savory taste to it. It was perfectly fried but I felt the mochiko needed some kind of sauce to go with it. 

Because we wanted a sauce to dip our mochiko chicken in we decided to get a server to assist us. However, we turned our heads to look at them and although they noticed us, they didn&#39;t come. We decided to wait longer and gave it about ten minutes of not touching our main courses. While we waited, we snacked on the fries which weren&#39;t anything too amazing but pretty standard. At this point, we had a long enough digestion period that we didn&#39;t even want a sauce for the mochiko chicken. We walked up to the register where both servers were standing and asked for two boxes. You normally get your check at your table but the lack of service had us going to the register, paying, and leaving."

I had chicken terriyaki with brown rice and salad. Yumyum, loved it. Then, i had a bite of my husband&#39;s mochiko chicken, and ended up eating half of his as well. I&#39;ve never tried this menu before, but i loved it! It was Sweet and juicy inside and Crispy outside. I really liked their food! itadakimasu is probably my favorite teriyaki place in whole seattle. 

- Super friendly !
This was huge for me! 
The guy that helped us was super friendly! We visited around 8:30 which is only 30min before closing. Maybe that&#39;s why there was only one person serving. Despite the late hour, itadakimasu was almost completely full, and i noticed that he had to run around alot. But, he still checked on us few times, worked hard, never had us wait,
AND had smile on his face all night. i was really impressed with the welcoming atmosphere he created!  Hope to visit again very soon :)"

I was in training for couple of week nearby and this place was one of the better ones around the area. Portions were huge. At first, I took Kimchi Stew. Reminder is: u have to order ur rice on side separately! Also, one surprising thing was they put smoked ham to kimchi stew. My first server was an Asian dude and had a good customer service :)  Other ladies were nice too from my 2nd and 3rd visits. If you are ordering teriyakis and if you are not a big eater make it half order! As I said their portions are huge. Lots of meat. I wish they put rice and salads automatically and there are side orders lol 
I wish I can visit there again explore more dishes they make! Overall delicious food and nice employees! ^_^"

Fast and friendly service, tasty food and big portions. The katsu was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the chicken teriyaki was well cooked with a nicely balanced teriyaki gaze. I like the option to get a fried egg with your dishes. Naturally, our positive expereince resulted  in a return visit.


The second time wasn&#39;t so great. The food (loco moco &amp; chicken/gyoza special) was still tasty and the portions were satisfying, however the service was horrible. We did come during a lunch hour and the tables all appeared to be full. However after we ordered our food, it took literally 45-minutes for our two dishes to come out. I even saw tables seated after us get their appetizers before us. Not cool. It seemed like the owner knows a lot of people as he sat at a few tables and talked with them for a while.

Bottom line: Food is  tasty food with big portions, but the service is sketchy."

The Japanese are renowned for their politeness and while our server was not Japanese, he was extremely polite and enthusiastic about serving us. This was a genuine display of etiquette, not something that felt forced.

I ordered the chicken katsu curry. Curry is one of my favorite comfort foods. The portions were surprisingly large and delicious. 

Excellent service, tasty food."

Since I have some down time and the portion is incredibly large, I&#39;m actually writing this review as I&#39;m dining. I used to order their mochiko chicken to go, which was delicious.
A friend recommended their tempura and beef combo, and although I didn&#39;t want beef, I decided to try it out anyway. Glad I did; the beef is tender, moist, flavorful, and cut perfectly! 
The prices are reasonable for the size, and the waiter/bartender seems extremely efficient and is very friendly. It&#39;s always nice to dine where the staff is attentive and keeps a clean house, not to mention the music/vibe is very relaxing with acoustic oldies. Its not often a restaurant near the ave can take away outside stimulus of grime. Will def come back with a friend next time I&#39;m in the area."

He&#39;s the smoothest hottest guy I know but oddly clueless when contacting the flyyyyy. The whole lunchtime we was concocting strategies. you know...standard launch code and shit. I ended up having to write the standard launch code on the receipt. Shit made me nervous when i noticed the woman at the cash register, who could very well possibly be fly waitress&#39;s mother...I didn&#39;t want her to think it was for her...no bad intentions and all. He ended up getting her first name, which could have been spelled li, ly, lee, leigh, leieieie. at that point, we ended up getting shots (hail yeah YAMAZAKI JAPANESE WHISKEY) to celebrate the failure that he isn&#39;t a clairvoyant oracle.

Anyway, we had a 3-hour workout before arriving here and we rang the food gong a few times before coming. The food here is teriyaki, the ambiance here....wait, is there even an ambiance here? it&#39;s muhfuxing u district, where you hope the ambiance isn&#39;t a dirty rat. the outside looks like a garage of a drug lord kingpin overlord with cocaine biceps of the powers that b. the inside is bar-chic casual-fashion sports-bar non-trashy. It ain&#39;t luxurious fur sofas but you ain&#39;t rockin second hand gear here. star wars fur you ain&#39;t rockin chewbacca.

The food is the anti-launch code. The portions are lunch-dinner combo worthy. There&#39;s a reason half orders exist at this restaurant. It helps separate the wheat from the chaff.

Everything is fantastic here, but here are some of the highlights:

MOCHIKO CHICKEN - hawaiian-style fried chicken. popcorn chicken on steroids. if yr appetite be on fleek, this dish will be the blowdryer to yr appetite, the thanksgiving to yr all-day fast. 

LOCO MOCO - two house-made hamburger patties, two eggs over easy, over rice. Those hamburger patties are crying meat sauce of joy. if you finish this in one sitting, glue will appear between yr ass and the seat. SCIENCE. Fourth law of thermodynamics, learn this shit.

CURRY - chicken katsu curry complete with curry sauce made for swimming, carrots, potatoes, and onions for all the curry finishings. 

CHICKEN TERIYAKI - just better than everything else in the vicinity. tender chicken, and DAT SAUCE.

EZ.

I do not LOVE the way that the tofu is cooked - they do a breaded and fried version, where I am more partial to the sauteed tofu without breading.  But, it isn&#39;t a deal-breaker.

Their lunch special of the day was chicken katzu with gyoza for only $10, which comes with two sides. Many of their entrees comes with one or two sides - the side options include white rice, brown rice, french fries, salad, miso soup, and fried egg. I absolutely recommend coming here for a no frills casual lunch. Just good food for cheap! This is in an area of U-District that is easy to park at (across the street from the Safeway).

I ordered the teriyaki chicken... And was shocked when served a mountain  of hearty pieces of chicken. The sauce was nice and flavorful, however the chicken was a little dry. Overall the food wasn&#39;t too memorable, save for the portion size of course. The thing that really tuned me off about the place was the waitress. Or rather, her actions.
*WARNING NEEDLESS RANT*
 My change was supposed to be $10, so I assumed she would give me a $10 bill. But instead she gave a $5 and 5 $1 bills, giving me incentive to give her a tip as I had smaller bills. SHE ASSUMED I WOULD NOT TIP HER. I already had a large amount of $1&#39;s in my wallet that I had intended to get rid of for the tip. Now that she forced onto me 5 more bills than necessary my wallet was ready to burst. Having my wallet be fuller than necessary is a huge pet peeve of mine if you hadn&#39;t guessed. I left the place with a full stomach, plenty of leftovers, and a wallet full of unnecessary bills."

I came back for the second time and I still enjoyed it very much.

The service was even better this time around. How is that even possible? Good service on the Ave? When does that ever happen?

My server was so nice and happy to serve customers. She put on genuine smile throughout the whole time. 

I see other reviews rave about spicy bulgogi  and I decided to order it this time. I was afraid it would be too spicy but it turned out to be not super spicy. I like spicy food but not super hot/spicy so it was just right for me. It may not be spicy enough or other people who want extra spicy dish though, I am afraid.

One thing I would suggest is to add a small or medium plate to each customer while serving food. I ordered the white rice but I found the bowl a little too awkward to eat it in. So maybe serve the rice in a plate rather than a bowl? I don&#39;t know. Again just a personal preference.

My only &#34;complaint&#34; is that there was way too much meat and not enough veggies other than onions. You have the option for a salad but I always choose other side dishes. I wish the dish itself could be a little more balanced but nothing really to complain here.

I will definitely return. I didn&#39;t try the waffle dessert this time because the last time I tried it, I was over stuffed. Next time!"

The portions are HUGE! We ordered one appetizer (CHICKEN MOCHIKO) and two chicken and gyoza dishes with a side of French fries for each of us and it came to total of only $29.04! We had to take several boxes to go cause we barely finished the apps itself and the chicken teriyaki was simply delicious. There was the chicken fat which I liked. Some places keep the skin and all the junk and I hate it. The teriyaki sauce compliments the chicken and it&#39;s amazing. Definitely coming back to try the chicken katsu next!

It&#39;s basically a teriyaki joint, but with a twist. It has tasty food, reasonable prices, and generous portions - what more can you ask for? A single entree can definitely be split between 2 people. As for the environment, it&#39;s much more trendier than your typical teriyaki place and even has a bar. 

I tried the mochiko chicken and beef bulgolgi with a side of fries, miso soup, and brown rice when I went here a few weeks ago. I love that many of the dishes here you get to choose two sides (which again, are very large portions). The mochiko chicken is so frickin&#39; good. Do yourself a favor and try it at least once! I couldn&#39;t stop eating it after the first bite. As for the beef bulgolgi, it was served nicely on a hot platter. It was good, but I thought it could have had a bolder flavor."

-Spicy Bulgogi Pork: Delivered to the table on a sizzling hot plate, ready to get in your belly!  Not salty, full flavored, and big portions.  On the spice front, I think they can leave the word &#34;spicy&#34; off the name because it barely had a spark to it.  At least on the table, they have chili sauce to add enough heat until you start sweating bullets :)  I would have liked the meat to be a bit more charred as it tasted a bit on the barely done side.  

-Loco Moco: HUGE!  Two patties served over a bowl of rice, topped with 2 over easy eggs and gravy all over! LOVED the flavor of the gravy! Some places just love to over salt, but not here, which is great!  The patties were also nicely seasoned and the eggs of course, perfectly cooked!  Great solid dish to have here!

-Fries and Gravy:  Skinny fries, beef flavored gravy.. nothing to rave about, but nice offering to have

I&#39;m glad I came by to check this place out! Since it is a small joint, it gets pretty crowded so don&#39;t expect to sit immediately.  $23 for all this.. and remember, HUGE portions!  For the most part, I really enjoyed this place.  However, I wish they had more Hawaiian items on here like Pork and Cabbage and Mac Salad!  Seems more Korean with a touch of Japanese/Hawaiian :)"

Also, I don&#39;t think they were expecting many people as there was only 1 waitress and the bartender for the entire place. 

We were told it was happy hour all night so we took advantage even though we just had dinner. We got a half dozen oysters for $1.50 each and 2 drinks. Unfortunately, the beer that I originally wanted was out so I had to settle with some canned beer. My GF ordered a sweet and fruity cocktail which she enjoyed. The oysters were mehhhh.

$21 Hendrix martinis. No, I&#39;m serious. Each martini cost about what a bottle of Hendrix costs. This, of course, sucks. Yes, there&#39;s always an up-charge. Yes, the product is more than just a drink. But this is DOUBLE what I&#39;ve been charged for the same beverage elsewhere. 

Whoops. My bad. Forgot I was drinking in &#34;The New Seattle&#34;. Pay to play, through the nose. 

Have fun, but only if you have lots of money. They charge $16 per shot of average (not top shelf- I shudder to think...) alcohol, plus another six per drink if you want them to put an olive or a few drops of vermouth in. 

Extremely bad value. But: a sign of the times. Not one of the privileged? Stay home and make drinks for you AND your friends for the price of a couple for yourself here. What a waste.

I customized my drink because there wasn&#39;t anything specifically I wanted to try on the menu. I told the bartender that I like something fruity and sweet. The base could be rum or vodka but not tequila. The drink came out to be okay, still on the strong and bitter side and I did not taste much fruity flavor.

The food was very tasty with the four gras mousse on toasted banquettes buttery delicious. The tavern burger with pork belly on top was SO WORTH the calories!"

I absolutely enjoyed the experience and the service was spectacular.  Our waiter was funny and very knowledgeable about each drink.  He took time to walk the 6 of us through our questions and introduce new drinks on the menu that we weren&#39;t even considering.

What I didn&#39;t enjoy was my drink, the Xocolatl.  I was expecting a sweet fruity chocolate experience for my night cap and what I got was Airborne...yup, the effervescent orange-flavored powder tablet.  In fact, my hubby&#39;s drink the Billionaire, was closer to chocolate than mine.  I felt a little mislead and wished I had ordered the Billionaire, which was delicious by the way if you love whiskey and chocolate.  Everyone else&#39;s drink was also very good, but mine was just meh.

Also great, the Pinas Envy and the drink with the cucumber...
Mezcal flight was pretty cool, but because it&#39;s a flight, know that you might not enjoy every single one of them.  They&#39;re pretty broad in the taste spectrum, but also pretty cool to try the spectrum."

We actually enjoyed the gnawing anticipation of having a custom-crafted cocktail from Needle &amp; Thread. 
In the meantime, we sat on lush barstools and were served drinks and apps by a fantastic bartender and server. I wish we had come in enough time to experience the entire menu, but the salmon crostini and brined olives were great accompaniments to the drinks. We had so much fun learning from the bartender, I don&#39;t actually remember the cocktails we ordered.

I have been here on many occasions, mostly late at night. This place fills up, so expect a wait during peak periods. It is not too large, and has about 6-8 tables and a large bar.

It is well decorated in a classic style with chandeliers and wooden furniture. It has a dim &amp; quiet ambiance with candles on the tables, and has a speakeasy-ish vibe. Definitely good for dates and small groups. Not a place to kick-off the night with a large noisy group, but more to end the night after dinner on a classy note.

It&#39;s known for its cocktail program, all of which are excellent. Their menu is segregated as per taste profiles, such as bitter, sour, sweet, etc. Not been disappointed by any of the cocktails here, but I specially like the bitter section, since I&#39;m a fan of old fashioneds. They have a good wine list, but not too many beers, so not a place for beer lovers. They have a limited food menu, but I&#39;ve never eaten there, so I can&#39;t comment.

Service has been different every time I&#39;ve been there. The servers are always friendly and courteous. However, I can&#39;t say the same about the doorman or the host, who seem very snobbish and rude for some reason. It also does take a while to get the drinks to the table, but I won&#39;t hold it against them since they have only two bartenders and almost everyone orders craft cocktails.

The prices are a little higher, somewhere from $12-16 for cocktails, but the quality justifies the price. It&#39;s just not a place to go to for a casual drink.

This is an excellent bar in terms of its drinks, but falls a tad short in service. Definitely a must go for cocktail lovers. Will be back."

It was quiet and the atmosphere was intimate.  It had a classic speakeasy feel- lots of wood, the bottles of alcohol looked like they were on book cases, everything was placed in a specific way whether it was by color or by height.  I just got a great feeling sitting there watching the bartender make the drinks.  The drink menu was extensive with many choices in different categories.  There&#39;s definitely something for everyone.  Unfortunately we didn&#39;t order food but all the food we saw looked delicious and my husband and I agreed that the next time we are in Seattle we would go back and also have dinner there."

One would think they would have been happy that we showed up on a slow Wednesday night, but they didnt appear to be happy.  We were the only ones there, save two people at the bar.  The service was really slow, inattentive and I have to say snotty.  Now, i have been at a bunch of top notch cocktail bars and speak easys that were reviewed as pretentious.  this was just snotty.  A few examples.  One of our group wanted to leave early and ask for his portion of the tab.  The waitress flat out said NO.  WTF.  In Seattle fashion, we talked behind the waitresses back.  since they were so slow, i figured she must have heard us.  Service did do a 180 turn around.  

All and all I wouldnt go back.  I would find the closest Sun Liquor, or hit a good bar in belltown.  Sorry guys.  I wanted to know  a good bar in the Capitol Hill vicinity."

There is a large half-circle booth is the back on the first floor, where my group sat. I think the seating could be better laid out though. The bar gets crowded, and the seating area to the right feels tight and awkward next to the door for the upstairs speakeasy. 

The food options are well done bar fare, but what really stands out are the interesting takes on drink beverages you may have (or have not) seen before. I love looking through the menu and seeing flips and fizzes from a long-ago era. 
They used to have a great mac n&#39; cheese, but it has since been replaced by a gnocchi dish. No hate on the gnocchi, it was good, but it is small appetizer sized, priced at full meal. My dining companion was very upset about the size of the gnocchi considering how much he paid for it. Tavern Law - please re-evaluate your pricing for that dish. 

Shoutout to the bathrooms. They play a recording in the bathroom of something cool. Also they have legit towels for your hands, and not paper towels. Classy."

The biggest was how hot the room was. People were literally dripping with sweat and some even left because of how uncomfortable the warmth was making them feel. The drinks were also strange. We understood that craft drinks were what the speakeasy was all about, but we also thought that you could order a basic drink like a glass of wine or a vodka tonic. Not the case.

Went to The Cannon and was floored when they were taking names to get INTO THE BAR....uh try NO. I wait for no bar.  We walked back down to Tavern Law.

Loved the speakeasy feel.  We found ourselves a couple of barstools over by the window and were immediately greeted by a server who took our order. The cocktails were strong.

My husband who&#39;s been there before directed my attention to the phone on the wall across from us and we watched a group of four dudes pick up the phone and in due corse walk through the door next to the phone.  Ah! the hidden speakeasy....  It was a hoot watching who got in and who didn&#39;t.  One couple tried several times and never did make it.  Couldn&#39;t figure out why.  

Eventually a group of six old dudes walked in and picked up the phone and within five minutes, a fight ensued between the downstairs bartender and a MASSIVE  guy in the group. I&#39;m assuming they were told there was no chance they were getting in and they didn&#39;t like it.  Was beginning to look like a mile of pipe up there I&#39;m sure.  What fun!!!

I had the Chatty Cathy....and damn if I didn&#39;t become quite Chatty. Can&#39;t remember what was in it, but it was strong and I don&#39;t think I could have more than one.

Yes!"

The happy hour wasn&#39;t anything notable, but my friend and I decided to check it out just based on the aforementioned whiskeys. (Anywhere with Yamazaki is intriguing to me right off the bat.)

We sat down and were thoroughly ignored for a good ten minutes before even so much as seeing a menu. It was a Monday night, and there were probably three other people in the place. When the bartender came and brought us a menu, I asked for an old fashioned with Bulleit rye. She said she didn&#39;t have Bulleit rye, which surprised me. I then asked for Templeton, which they also didn&#39;t have, but she said she&#39;d &#34;check again, just to make sure she didn&#39;t look like a jackass.&#34; No dice. I asked what rye was available at all, and she didn&#39;t seem to know what I was even asking for. I just gave up and ordered a happy hour version of the drink. No big deal. 

But then it took her an extra 10 minutes to make two of those (my friend had ordered the same thing). When we ordered one more round, it seemed to take an eternity. The drinks themselves were a little underwhelming. Imagine my surprise, then, when two drinks on happy hour had somehow cost $33. When I asked about it, the bartender said she had found a good rye to use after all, even though I&#39;d just ordered the happy hour version ($9). Thanks?...

Not a good experience overall. Liberty, Canon, and Old Sage are much better nearby places for whiskey, and also feature the additional perk of bartenders who aren&#39;t terrible at their jobs. Avoid Tavern Law."

Ordered 2 drinks, each of which had no real uniqueness or flavor, one tasted just like a Fanta Orange and the other a boring cinnamon drink that would be served at an office holiday party.  Way the menu lays out all the ingredients, you realize how pretentious it is when the drinks are so boring and at ten dollars a pop.

To top it off, bartender had massive attitude, making experience a total waste of a minimum Lyft ride.  Literally the worst place have gone to so far during our trip here in Seattle.  Mistake in not double checking on Yelp, where you see a lot of reviews noting the horrible service and crappy attitude of the staff."

Although the restaurant wasn&#39;t crowded and big table in the back was open, and there were 5 of us there with one more on the way, the waitress insisted on seating us at a small table and then moving us, drinks and all, after the final person arrived. The drinks are good, but overpriced, and mine, shaken with an egg white, wasn&#39;t close to fluffy the way a fizz should be. The waitress didn&#39;t tell us until she brought the check that she couldn&#39;t split it - and then gave us attitude while we tried to figure out how to take care of it. 

Just not a very nice experience over all, and with some many places serving cocktails on Capitol Hill, I&#39;d rather go elsewhere."

We came in with the intent of going to Needle and Thread, but because of the wait time we were expecting, we decided to go ahead and order drinks. I&#39;ve been here many times before, and have always tried to balance the good with the bad. However, the service this time left me appalled.

The server went to us and got us our water, but just threw the glasses on the table and then threw the napkins on the table as well. Being a Thursday night where you&#39;re at half capacity, you would expect a little more care. 

Although he was attentive, it felt like he was badgering us, as he kept walking to us every two minutes asking if we were ready to order yet.

When we were ready for our check, he was nowhere to be found. We waved for him a couple of times, but he simply ignored us. We ended up having to call over one of the bartenders and she ended up giving us the check instead of him.

Drinks were good, but there are plenty of good cocktails bars within a two block radius that you can go to that are comparable.

Now for the burger overall. I know that my food is too salty when I&#39;m chugging water an hour after my meal... which is exactly what I&#39;m doing right now! The burger was too salty but since the pork belly was so good, I give this place an average rating. Was $20 worth it? Absolutely not!

I can absolutely see why it enjoys the distinction of being on lists such as one of the best 25 bars in America from various sources. It&#39;s fairly spendy. But I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: you get what you pay for and it&#39;s worth every penny at Tavern Law.

It&#39;s a little atypical from other Capitol Hill restaurants/bars in that parking isn&#39;t a complete nightmare when you come here. It&#39;s closeish to the main district of Capitol Hill, but far enough away from clusters of apartments/condos that street parking is relatively easy to find. It&#39;s a refreshing change, to say the least.

I showed up at about 7:30 on a Friday night, at which time the restaurant was pretty underpopulated. Not sure why, but it made getting a table very quick and easy! I wouldn&#39;t necessarily count on this happening if you show up at dinner time on a Friday or Saturday, though. I would imagine it gets crowded early and quickly. I&#39;ll just operate under the assumption that the resident psychic at Tavern Law knew I was coming and asked that some tables be cleared to make my experience better. I&#39;m kind of a big deal. People know me (Note: I am not certain that Tavern Law has a resident psychic and it is fairly likely that my assumption is wrong and in reality I simply got lucky this time).

The drinks on the menu are really good, albeit a little pricey ($12-15 on average for most of the menu cocktails). This place is definitely geared more toward a cocktail drinker versus a beer drinker. We sampled a couple of their menu choices including the Bourbon Dialect, the Farmer&#39;s Hand, and the Fourth Regiment. My personal favorite was the Bourbon Dialect. The bartenders are skilled enough here that you can simply describe the type of flavors you like in your cocktails. Even if you aren&#39;t a huge drinker and don&#39;t have a very established taste for what you like and don&#39;t like, I am confident that they could create something for you here even if you can&#39;t provide a great deal of information.

I had the Natural Beef Burger with the pork belly (an extra $4, but you&#39;ll regret it if you don&#39;t add it on). It&#39;s in the conversation for the best burger in Seattle, especially with that pork belly (seriously, get it on your burger). It really went well with my drinks and the fries were perfectly salty. I will definitely come back to try the other menu items. They do the gastropub thing really well.

The gripes I would have are that service can be a little slow and the size of the plates can be a little small for the price. But even these minor detractors can&#39;t outweigh the deliciousness of the food and cocktails enough to merit dropping it down from 5 to 4 stars."

Rye, bourbon, scotch, whiskey, the gangs all here.  Not a pomegranate cosmopolitan to be found as far as the eye can see.  This is where to go if you&#39;re serious about your spirits and can appreciate a well made cocktail.  Notice I said cocktail, not drink.  What&#39;s the difference you might be wondering?  Drinks are what you find on the menu at the Cheesecake Factory, cocktails are what you&#39;ll expect at Tavern Law.  Drinks use inferior spirits and mixers, cocktails use scratch made ingredients.  If you usually frequent establishments that fall into the drink category, branch out and give Tavern Law a chance.  You&#39;ll never go back to vodka cranberry, I promise."

Basically, this means $7 cocktails during happy hour. And by happy hour, they really mean, ALL night.

$7 classic cocktails like a Manhattan, Vesper, Boulvardier, Ramos Gin Fizz.  OMG. Honey, we&#39;re nailing our butts to the chair and never leaving!  ;-) 

That&#39;s not all. You&#39;d think they&#39;d pour these drinks carelessly and with cheap alcohol? No siree.  Words like tinctures, small batch liquors, hand crafted cocktails are second nature to staff and owners at Tavern Law. A business practice that a cocktail fanatic like me HIGHLY appreciates.

The food is really good. The burger reminded me so much of SF&#39;s Nopa&#39;s version and we all know how highly I speak of Nopa.  The red wine braised beef cheeks were fork tender and so comforting on a cold winter&#39;s night. The mac n cheese with the duck fat crumbs were amazing, sans the sliced green apples on top. I do have to say that the Foie Gras terrine was too chilled for my liking, so that sat on the table for awhile before I finished it.

You have let me down in the worst way. We were sent here on the recommendation of a friend who we very greatly trust and I have no idea how our experience went so wrong. Our friend runs an establishment in our neighborhood that has the deepest pride in their menu and beverage offerings and creates an enjoyable and hospitable customer experience and that could not be any more opposite of Tavern Law. 

We walked into a packed room with about 4 bartenders and 4 servers, so we figured that we wouldn&#39;t have any problems with getting service. Welp, we were wrong. We had to try to get the attention of 3 people to find out where we could sit. We should have known it was going to be bad when the bartenders had full stools and they weren&#39;t even talking to the guests except for 1 or 2 who appeared to be regulars.

We waited 20+ min for each drink, they didn&#39;t describe the $15 drinks in appropriate (if any) detail leaving us with drinks that were so grossly different from how they were described on the menu that we thought we had received the wrong beverage. 

Between the first and second drinks, we called up to the speakeasy and they told us to call back at 7:45. 

We ordered food and drinks. Got the food with no explanation about the dishes even though it seems that the chef put a lot of love into the menu. Okay, so it was all way too sweet... like, everything... like they added sugar to everything, including things that shouldn&#39;t have sugar added. Not our tastes, but it must be the style of the chef. If you spend that kind of time and energy, your staff should take some pride in it, right??

Sometime between when we sat down and when our food arrived, we overheard the server telling the table next to us (clearly out for an enjoyable girls night) that they&#39;re &#34;not really a shot bar&#34; when they ordered a round. So telling them no rather than offering them an acceptable alternative was his preferred service style? K, got it.

Ate. The speakeasy has a sign on the door making it clear that you are to close your tab at TL prior to coming up. No problem. Asked for the check at 7:20 after asking 3 different servers for our check because our guy had mysteriously gone missing? 

We got the check at 7:35. I immediately put my card in the book and placed it on the table.

Our server returned to have me sign at 7:55. (Yeah.)

We immediately picked up the phone to get into the speakeasy. It was off the hook. Waited 10 min, still off hook. Told dicky bartender who pretended to not hear.

Decided to spend our money somewhere else. Walked out. Told doorman about the phone and he started making excuses about how there were only 2 servers at the speakeasy. Well, we never made it there for them to ruin our experience up there... so there you have it.

I would give them 2 stars for the cool decor and concept alone... but I just can&#39;t."

He crafted me the most amazing rye sour I&#39;ve ever had -- frothy and tart, made with an egg white and the most amazing sour mix ever (made in-house, of course). For my second cocktail, I gave the creative license to the mixologist  and he brought me what was perhaps the most delicious, smoky but smooth rye cocktail I&#39;ve ever had.

Tavern Law has been my go to bar for a few years now. It&#39;s like an oasis in the youngest neighborhood of Seattle. Really! The youngest neighborhood= Cap hill! All the college students from nearby, the hipsters, the 20 somethings and early 30 somethings can all be found here. There are plethora of hipster bars, fun bars and restaurants nearby. But this place is like an escape from them all. Oh and that Old Sage next door of course :)

Décor- perfection! It has that old classic bar feel with great wooden bar and interior. I love the candles, love the food, the music and of course, the drinks!! 

Food
Fried chicken - the best!
Foie Gras - so tasty you will order it twice!
Pork belly burger
Mac &amp; cheese
Cracklings

All so good. Most of the time their tables are jammed packed! But if and when you do get a table, try their food as well as their drinks. I&#39;ve been here a few times for their events and the most memorable one was the Great Gatsby premier party event! We ate, watched the movie and came here for after party upstairs! Now that was fun. They even had a special drink for it! It was similar to French 75 but with a twist. Again, this isn&#39;t your typical bar in Capitol hill. It is mellow, classy and was named the top best 6 bars in US! You have to come for a good, grown up fun with hand crafted cocktails. No cheap alcohol and mediocre drinks here.

One can say the drinks are a little on the pricier side but I feel they are about right. My favorite cocktails has bitters, egg whites, basil and all sorts of fun, fresh items. It is worth the price. They also play really good music! One can come here, sit at the bar, get a drink and just relax! Or if you are with a bunch of girls, take over that little area on the right! It&#39;s almost like having your own private area. Just give your bartender sometime to make you a perfect drink! I was never really big on scotch but after trying their scotch cocktails, I am sold! They are so delicious! I even love their old fashions! It has just the right amount of everything. Over all, this is one of my top five go to bars in Seattle. I love everything about this place! Minus the crowd at times because it can get really busy!!! But that&#39;s a good thing! And if and when you do manage to get upstairs, you just might never leave! :)"

I don&#39;t know any situation where someone wouldn&#39;t be able to received their receipt, unless someone is pocketing some money. but that&#39;s just speculation. The group of ladies said something about a race card? I&#39;m not sure of the whole story but at the end of the day, the staff should have kept composure and handled the situation without elevating it to the point of calling police to escort a group of 3 young ladies out of the bar. 

Some people started to clap, then the waitress told the party that was clapping to &#34;SHUT THE FUCK UP&#34; when it seemed like the group clapping was clapping in favor of the bar getting rid of the problem customers? I&#39;m not sure. We ended up leaving since this killed any ambiance the place had earned so much praise for. 

One of the bartenders said that their employees have the right to tell their customers to &#34;FUCK OFF&#34; maybe its all apart of the &#34;Tavern Law&#34; hmm...I wonder what page in the employee handbook that is on? Do they have seminars and training videos to new employees to teach their staff to swear and belittle their paying customers?

Maybe some of the big wigs will read this, maybe having some pride in your business and holding value in your customers will be of importance some day rather than winning the shouting match and putting your patrons on a public display of humility all because you feel like you can and you work there. Its a shame we don&#39;t know the young ladies name with the short blonde hair. 

TL;DR: Tavern Law gives the right for a uniformed employee to belittle and swear at their patrons. The ambiance is nice though."

This led me to experience what the Hype was all about for myself.  I am more of a Cocktail drinker than a beer drinker and the Drinks they make are Delicious.  One helpful tip is that if you tell the Bartender what you like, they can whip up an Excellent drink for you.  I tend to prefer Sweet, Fruity, Tart, Gingery, and Citrus Drinks.  Not only do they have Fantastic Cocktails but just like Quinn&#39;s, Spur, Old Sage, and The Coterie Room the Gastropub food is Unbelievable.

Spiced Fried Chicken- This is the kind of meal that can bring a Lil Sunshine to anyone&#39;s day.  The Fried Chicken has my Favorite Fried Chicken Skin Ever!  Chicken skin, if prepared right can be more delicious than Bacon.  At Tavern Law The Fried Chicken has the most Amazing Crusty Exterior with Honey Drizzle for something sweet in your life.  The Spices used in the Batter are a flavor Roller Coaster for your Taste Buds. The Chicken has been Brined for Days and Sous Vide to make it extra juicy.  One of the Best Fried Chicken Dishes I have had in My Life.

Natural Beef Burger with Pork Belly- Imagine the Quinn&#39;s Burger with a Big Phat Chunk of Pork Belly on top with Red Wine Onion Jam.  The Burger The Red Wine Onion Jam was quite a surprise.

However on my most recent trip (on a Groupon, which should have been a bad sign) it was fairly close to disastrous. 

The service that used to be beyond exceptional was terrible. In a half full restaurant we waited excruciatingly long for service and delivery of our food and drinks. Our server punched in the incorrect cocktail for my girlfriend, came out to confirm her order as my cocktail was brought out, then proceeded to serve cocktails to everyone else in the place, and only then brought out her drink. And he still charged us for the more expensive drink. 

The cocktails, while interesting and inventive just weren&#39;t very tasty. The same could be said about the food. The infamous burger with pork belly fell flat, no depth to the flavors other than differently kinds of &#34;salty&#34;. The fried chicken, which used to be crisp, and juicy, was dull and uninteresting.

Really I believe that the combination of terrible service and their inability to reach the incredible standard they created last time has ultimately sullied this place for me. I believe when it comes to a restaurant &#34;If you aren&#39;t getting better you are getting worse&#34; and I think Tavern Law quit getting better a long time ago."

I love the atmosphere here. The food and drinks can get a little pricy but they have quality. I would probably only snack and drink here as the food options are pretty limited.

For several  minutes they stood a few feet away from us arguing, dropping the f-word and causing a scene while my sister and I stared at them from the bar.  It was incredibly unprofessional and uncomfortable and I wanted to get out there of as soon as possible.  

Terrible service and bad experience.  Very disappointed."

Came here for drinks on a Sunday night after parking in the garage next door. Tried getting into Needle and Thread, but it was a 30min wait, so we opted to just grab drinks here. Huge drink selection.

1. BOURBON DIALECT $12
(Joe Denhalter) Bourbon, Salers Gentiane, Agave, Basil, Lemon, Orange Bitters
~Pretty good. Nice, citrusy, basily, smooth.

Service was quite good. Bartender came over at the right times, and he spent a minute talking through some drinks. Wasn&#39;t a fan of the third drink we got though, which was some boozy, herbal concoction."

Especially when we were 1 of 3 tables there, on a slow monday night. Bruhhh! It took them 16 minutes to come to our table. Yes 16, I timed them. Sixteen man. I could have warmed up like 5 hot pockets and ate them in that time.

Anyways, finally after waiting we get the $19 burger (including the $4 added pork belly) and $12 Mac and Cheese. At these prices you&#39;d think you&#39;d end up being somewhat satisfied right? Or nah! 

Burger - 2/5 Yo for $19 i expect to get an actual burger not a mini slider. I took 3 bites and it was gone bruh. Not gonna lie, it was very tasteful and the pork belly was delicous, but plz make this burger bigger if you&#39;re gonna charge the dubb for it.

Mac and Cheese - 1.5/5.  Mediocre. Flavorless.

Ambience - 4/5 Only thing I liked about this place was that they were playing the cuts. R Kelly - Ignition? Aw Yup.

Service - 1/5.. Okay the ending was the worst. We&#39;re now 1 of 2 tables there and the chef comes to us and asks if he can take the plates and if we need the check. We say yes obviously cant wait to leave but 10 mins later, no one shows up with the check! This was the first time ever I had to walk up the the bar myself and ask if we could pay. Had to be one of the worst services I&#39;ve ever expierenced. Im pretty sad cus I was actually excited to go here but was def underwhelmed."

The logical solution was to enjoy another well-crafted cocktail downstairs at Tavern Law. We were seated by the window, and we got the entire little section to ourselves. That was pretty nice. An attentive server came over and handed us our drink menus. He seemed a little eager--he came back in barely three minutes to ask if we&#39;d made our drink choices--but I&#39;d rather have a waiter who&#39;s more eager than not.

As for the cocktails: wow! Mine was rye-based, but it had walnut liqueur and some darker, fruity flavours that combined wonderfully with the rye to give me a sweeter drink than I&#39;m used to with whiskey bases. My boyfriend had what can only be described as the suavest, classiest pina colada-like cocktail I&#39;ve ever encountered: think pina colada flavours in a Mad Men setting rather than a college spring break trip.

Prices are kind of steep, but I would recommend coming here for at least one drink; the menu is extensive, the combinations are unusual and expertly crafted, and the cocktails are delicious."

It is always bustling with liveliness and drinkers of all sorts. The decor reminds us of an 1800&#39;s saloon with a spinning roulette and dart board, grandiose chandeliers, and ceiling high bookcase. It&#39;s pegged to have some secret door with steps leading to an abyss of happiness. 

And so it does...if you look right by the bookcase, there is a steel door that catches the eye. What it is for, I have yet to ask. I imagine it&#39;s a storage room, but the suspension of a non-generic answer tingles inside waiting till the next time I go. 

Lastly, the lounge area to the right of the bar is where I imagine the old-fashion go-go dancers and their gentlemen friends to be, laughing and drinking the night away. 

The drink menu is massive and caters to all kinds of drinkers. I appreciate when bartenders make me a light drink when asked for, but there is no such thing at Tavern Law. If you order a hard one, you will get a hard one. It is wise to call them mixologists vs bartenders because their concoctions are surprising to the eyes and tasteful to the tongue. (They even have the 7 Stars Moonshine, in case you&#39;re interested). 

I wish I could recommend a couple drinks, but I forgot to log the ones I tried. So not Yelper of me. I have yet to try the specials on the menu (ie. foie gras terrine or pork shoulder), but this is already on my list of &#34;late night drinking.&#34;"

The food, however, was overpriced and average. We had the Mac and Cheese, Spiced Fried Chicken, Smoked Fingerling Potatoes, Seared Pork Belly, and the daily dessert.

Tavern Law is NOT one of those spots. Rather, Tavern Law is the spot I like to visit every so often to relax and enjoy some well-crafted cocktails. It&#39;s a nice break from going HAM at the bars along Pike St!

Tavern Law is a small lounge with dim lighting; the size and romantic ambiance make it a great date spot! Often you&#39;ll see people enter Tavern Law to go upstairs to Needle and Thread...or attempt to go upstairs and then get turned down. I have yet to visit Needle and Thread, but I will one of these days! 

I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with any of Tavern Law&#39;s drinks. There&#39;s something for everyone, and I like how the menu gives credit to the bartenders who created the cocktails. I&#39;m a BIG fan of the Midnight in Paris, and the Lusty Lady comes in a close second. During my last visit to Tavern Law, I finally got to try the food. Specifically, I ordered the Mac and Cheese and the Fried Chicken. I was indifferent to the Mac and Cheese, but the Fried Chicken was damn good! The chicken was so juicy, and the honey was a pleasant addition to the batter. The food portions are surprisingly big, so I was super full after my meal!

Excellent cocktails and tasty food come at a price, so expect to drop at least $30 or so on food and/or a few drinks. Also, because this place is small, expect a wait to get inside on Friday and Saturday nights. If all the tables are occupied, the bouncer will let you hang around the standing area (by the bar) and order drinks until a table opens up."

I had the park side- vodka, absinthe, pear liqueur- and it was probably one of the best drinks I&#39;ve ever had!  

I&#39;ve heard this is one of the best bars in seattle, and from my experience here I can definitely see why! 

The only issue was I came on a Monday night, and it was packed- my three other friends and I had to sit at the bar, where it was awkward to have a group convo.. It is a much more intimate setting- so I recommend coming with just one or two people!

Holy $hit, Tavern Law, is 10-20 per drink not enough for you? Do you just hate DDs? WTF.

I had the Southern Belle, which was great in terms of flavor, but poor in terms of alcohol content. Maybe I&#39;m getting to be too much of a lush, since I seem to say that a lot. 

I also ended up finishing my friends&#39; drink. I&#39;ve forgotten the name, but it consisted of whiskey and a very, very strong medicinal taste from the chamomile infused alcohol. Not the best thing I&#39;ve ever tasted, but much more worth the price tag-- this one will knock you on your @$$.

We also ordered a gin based cocktail. If I had to put a name to it, I&#39;d say it was a corpse reviver, but not positive. My friend liked it very much. 

All in all, I&#39;d give TL another shot, especially after eyeing some of those small plates offered."

In a late evening during our visit to Seattle we found Villa Escondida and decided to walk in for a drink and a meal. We sat at the bar, ordered a couple of beers and tacos. The beer was cold and good, but the tacos were awesome! They were so good that we decided to come back the next morning after the young lady who was behind the bar told us that they serve a mean brunch. 

The next morning, to our surprise, we found the same young lady working the floor! She told us that the restaurant was owned and operated by the same family so all of them were putting in as many hours as was necessary to help the business succeed.

I was sad when they left the old location on Broadway but totally rejoice when I found out about this new spot! Even though it&#39;s in Belltown :) Bring me the mole!!!

This place compared to their old space is ginormous! They took over the old frontier place. The have plenty of space for dinner and huge bar area! I can see this place happening on weekends if they play some latin music! It can also seem very empty on a slow night given how big the space is. But same delicious food!

Kitchen is in the front so you can pretty much see the action from your table! And they have happy hour till 6 pm. Coming back next time for that. Menu has their popular dishes like the chicken, mole, steak, al pastor and so much more. I do like the food here a lot!

We went with really good chips &amp; salsa and few plates too share! I also got their house special margarita! 

Carne esada plate: big enough to share! I got double rice minus the beans. It was delish!! Love the meat. 

Taco Al pastor plate: came with white rice and beans. Also delicious!! 

Flan ~ soft and drenched in caramel! Sweet!

Mole is my favorite here! 

Overall it was low key mellow dining experience for a Saturday night! Super mellow. Four stars all around. Except: I wasn&#39;t informed about some side prices. Its not a big deal but it would&#39;ve been great to know. For instance: when asked what flavor is house margarita: they said strawberry or mango. But didn&#39;t say it would be an extra! As well as when asked if they have any spice: it would be charge per portion! We got two tiny cups of their homemade hot sauce. Its hot! We almost got a third too but didn&#39;t.

The mole is on point and if I could eat their chile relleno every day...I would.

Food - great authentic Mexican favors for brunch, happy hour, and dinner!!! Ask for their house spicy sauce!

The place was totally empty except us and one other table, which surprised me since many restaurants around it were packed. It was a good experience overall, but was not as great as I thought it would be, specially based off their ratings.

The restaurant is really huge, which it doesn&#39;t seem from outside. It could be turned into a great nightlife spot on weekends since it has mostly freestanding tables.It probably looked more empty because of its size.

We got the chips and guac to start off with. The chips were fresh and hot, and the guac was excellent. We also got a wet burrito, an enchilada plate, and a tostada plate. The burrito was decent, but not very flavorful, the enchiladas were sour for some reason. However, the beans and rice it was served with were spectacular. The tostadas were excellent too. I also asked for some hot habanero sauce, which turned out to be more bitter than hot.

The service was very friendly, but we were served by multiple servers, all of which kept asking us the same questions repeatedly. However, none of them were rude or obnoxious, just felt funny. They were prompt in refilling drinks and taking orders.

The food is reasonably priced, around $10-12 for entrees, and portions are good. Compared to other restaurants in belltown, this is very reasonable. 
I was underwhelmed this time, but will give it a second chance, and probably go there for happy hour as well."

My wife and I are Mexican eating fiends, living in San Diego for 17 years.  We came across this place as we were traveling with our kids and the first place we stopped at curtly told us that they only served people 21 and over. Ok...fine by us as we were not in the mood for man bun looking hipster Mexican food. We therefore walked a few more blocks and found this gem. Food was very good. I got a steak burrito and my wife got the pork taco&#39;s.  Everything was very good. We also got the quac with chips which I would not get again as it was a fairly small portion for the $.  

The waiter was great (son of the owner?).  Very attentive and was exceedingly kind to our son with special needs, joking with him about how many seconds it took to bring our drinks. Food came out quickly.  All in all, a good experience."

If it wasn&#39;t for the very nice server I would have rated this location a 2 star. I would recommend other locations other than this for breakfast with a Mexican touch.

So happy that Villa Escondida opened and I was able to find it, thanks to Yelp! The food here was amazing. My dad and I both ordered Carne Asada and he got a side of Tamales. We were both greeted and checked on multiple times by all of the workers. If I even looked their away, they were at my table to ensure everything was alright and that I had everything I needed. They were definitely on it!

I was really surprised by the prices. Even if you go across the street to get nasty ass Taco Del Mar, once you&#39;re done adding sour cream and guac, you&#39;ve got yourself a $12 burrito meal that makes you sick after eating. So to come here and see the Carne Asada was only $15 was surprising, being that it&#39;s in the heart of Belltown. Everything tasted fresh and was well made. Lots of flavor and the meat wasn&#39;t hard to chew.

I&#39;ll be back! The nachos someone else was having while I was there were looking mighty good."

I needed food, fast. My hangry level was spiking as my attempts to get brunch in Belltown were being met with waiting list after waiting list. But there was Villa Escondida. The neons signs and musica mexicana flowing into the street reminded me of the oddly authentic Mexican food I grew up loving in Virginia (of all places). 

&#34;Breakfast burrito! Breakfast burrito! Rapido! Por favor!&#34; I didn&#39;t order it quite like that, but it&#39;s what I thought and what I got. In ten minutes flat I had chorizo and huevos wrapped with love in a homemade tortilla with a little buddy of potatoes, chilies and onions and a variety of hot sauces. 

Gracias mucho bueno. Well done.

I had a girlfriend in town and wanted to take her to a Mexican restaurant so I decided to check reviews first. Wow big mistake! I took my friend here based on the high reviews and I was beyond disappointed. To be honest I am not a &#34;foodie&#34; nor have I ever claimed to be a food snob, however this place is just down right disgusting. I ordered the burrito and my friend ordered the enchiladas and we literally left hungry bc we did not eat much of our food bc we couldn&#39;t. It was that nasty!! This says a lot bc we are in graduate school and we do not have the money to waste on a non-eaten meal.

Additionally, we each ordered a margarita. I asked the waitress if they had 1800 Tequila, but the server did not even know what was. Again, I am not a tequila snob by any means. I honestly just didn&#39;t want a hang over the next day, so I wanted to make sure I had good quality tequila. However, she did not know any tequilas and simply brought me the well tequila. The server was very sweet and did the best she could, but she was simply uneducated about their liquor (not her fault!!). 

Please do yourself a favor and go to any other Mexican restaurant in Seattle or the state of Washington. I have no idea how this place even stays in business. It is crappy food and does nothing to satisfy your hunger for Mexican. You are literally better off going to Taco-bell."

Yes, authentic and legit. I&#39;ve tried both their nachos and their burrito adobada extra cebolla and couldn&#39;t be more pleased.

Not to mention the staff is incredibly friendly. A coworker placed an order over the phone from across the street and without asking, Maria hand delivered it to her!

I was in the neighborhood craving Mexican and decided to stop by Villa Escondida because of all of the great Yelp reviews. I could not have been more disappointed. I like to keep it simple when I visit a Mexican spot for the first time, so I ordered the carnitas tacos which came with a side of rice and beans. 

Let&#39;s start with the carnitas. Okay, virtually any cut of pork by default has great taste. It is hard to ruin - I mean, it&#39;s PORK and pork is delicious! Carnitas can be mind-blowingly good, even with very little seasoning to build upon the natural flavor of the meat. Somehow at Villa Escondida, the kitchen managed to transform pork into tasteless, watery, greasy mush. Maybe I came on the wrong day? Maybe the chef was hungover? I don&#39;t know, but I feel bad for the pig that died to make such lousy tacos. 

The rice and beans were equally bland and lacking any creativity, spice or flavor. Not even a little cotija sprinkled on top of the beans (I see it in some other reviewer&#39;s pics) for some contrast and cheesy love. Plain white overcooked rice and straight-up black beans that looked and tasted like they were straight out of a can.

I usually like to go back and give a place a second chance after an experience like this, especially considering all of the great reviews here. I will give an update if I can will myself to do so."

This is a no frills place.  I was not given any chips and salsa before the meal. No salsa served with your meal. I think you can get both, but I believe they are considered appetizers and/or sides that cost extra.  They do have Tapatio.  A very small amount of rice and beans (not a complaint. I was trying to not eat too bad for my cheat meal =P)   Some of their other dishes may be better. A few on the menu looked really good, but they were out of what I originally ordered.  

I&#39;d go back if someone else wanted to go, but I&#39;d probably eat somewhere else in that area given what&#39;s available nearby.

Edit - I lied. I&#39;d come back to try the breakfast burrito. The yelp picture looks delicious."

I was excited to try this new joint as it&#39;s a block from my apartment. 
I ordered a wet burrito with carne asada. It arrived to the bar top where I was sitting and looked great on the plate. 
I took 3-4 bites and finally got a piece of steak, but couldn&#39;t chew it. 
I made he decision to send my order back because the steak in my burrito was too tough. The bartender, instead of taking my plate away, asked why I was sending it back. I explained that I ate 1/4 of a burrito before I found the first peace of meat, and when I did, it was tendon. 
He asked what I would like instead. I told him, &#34;Let&#39;s try the Nachos with Carnitas&#34;. He took my plate to the kitchen, shortly thereafter, out walked the cook/manager(?). He asked me again why I sent my order back. When I explained, he told me that it&#39;s very hard to make the food by hand each night and that the meat isn&#39;t always perfect. Staring at me as if I had done something wrong. I stared back. 
[In case you have never worked in the food service industry before, let me give you a tip: don&#39;t ever come out to tell your customers an excuse for why your food is bad.]
Next, this gentleman asked me what I would like instead. I repeated, &#34;I would like to try the nachos, as I have already told the bartender.&#34;
The nachos arrived with plenty of stewed carnitas and (canned) jalapeños, cheese and pico de gallo served over about 5 soggy tortilla chips. 
I&#39;ve had better nachos at a high school basketball game. 
Didn&#39;t even finish our beers before we paid for what we did eat, and found better accommodations. 
You&#39;ve been warned!"

I had been here a few times in the past year for sports-viewing and happy hour and was always impressed by the friendly service and welcoming atmosphere.  I would not call this a top sports bar in Seattle but it is a good spot for watching local teams play if you don&#39;t want to be in a super-charged Seahawks or Sounders game day.

But on this particular visit I was in a bind as I had ridden my bike 13 miles from Bellevue only to have my phone prematurely die on me, which was jamming me up on taking pictures, mapping myself to the bus station, audio entertainment, and most of all, Yelping!  I found myself right around the corner from Shawn O&#39;Donnell&#39;s and popped in praying to find a handy phone charger.  The bartender, Alec, more than obliged my by actually bringing a phone charging station over to my seat, with connectors for all types of devices.  Incredible!  Naturally I stayed a bit to juice up the phone and took advantage of a solid happy hour deal - $4.50 glasses of cabernet!  Not too shabby.  A small house salad sated my hunger after the long ride and I managed to the nearby Pioneer Station to grab a bus and jet home before rush hour got crazy.  

I&#39;ll be back, 4.5 stars!

Nods to Alec and Stephanie, who bring awesome attitude to a sometimes thankless job.  Top notch!"

Not sure if the food here is in anyway truly authentic Irish/American fusion but hey...corned beef and cabbage? Authentic enough for my uneducated opinion.

The drunken wings were good for the first 3 before becoming sickeningly sweet. The mac and cheese was filling but not at all satisfying. I loved the mashed potato (so it&#39;s got that going for me).

Service? I never got a refill in my water or my all-you-can-eat fries. Not sure if the server was having an off day, but there were only 5 other groups. I&#39;m definitely not coming back if I&#39;m ever in Seattle again."

We were headed for a totally different place, but their amazing chalk art prompted me to stop and take a picture, and then we decided on the spot to try this place out instead. So, guys, your Dory chalk art was great marketing!! (I posted a picture, too.) 

Their happy hour is pretty fantastic. 20 oz pours of beer for only $4.50, as well as deals on cocktails and liquor. Of course, we went with the beers. I tried a kölsch by Odin and it was delightfully refreshing. I&#39;d recommend that one to beat the recent Seattle heat. (Har de har har. They call this heat. They don&#39;t know anything about heat. I crack up every time I hear someone talk about this heat as if it&#39;s a big deal. Granted, they don&#39;t have air conditioners here, but it&#39;s so breezy!)

ANYWAY, their happy hour food menu is pretty solid, too. Lots of options and almost all of them are well under $10. (If I remember correctly, they might all be under $10!) We went with the fish and chips because we wanted something to snack on and I can&#39;t resist fish and chips. The happy hour serving comes with two pieces of fish and bottomless fries. That&#39;s right - BOTTOMLESS FRIES. Amazing. 

Both the fries and the fish were pretty good. I doused my piece of fish liberally with malt vinegar and went to town. The breading they use is perfect - crunchy and not overly greasy, which is sometimes a problem at other places. No extra grease here! The fish was a little flavorless, but that&#39;s okay because malt vinegar took care of that problem in no time flat. It was still good, either way, and I&#39;d recommend this dish if you&#39;re looking for a light snack to share with someone. It was only $7 on the happy hour menu, making it a pretty great deal. (Especially with bottomless fries. You just can&#39;t beat that and their fries as tasty.) 

Our service was excellent. I can&#39;t speak highly enough about the service. Our waitress was awesome and I really wish I remembered her name. It looks like she was also a bartender as well. We didn&#39;t have any cocktails, but if their cocktails are half as good as the kickass service, then they&#39;re pretty awesome. 

For being an impromptu stop, this place worked out really well for us and I know we&#39;d stop by again if we were ever back in the area. Keep kicking ass, Shawn O&#39;Donnell&#39;s!"

Great happy hour deal on food and drinks. It&#39;s 3-7 everyday and will get you a variety of drinks for $4.50 and a bunch of food options for under $10, which is a pretty solid deal for downtown Seattle. 

The Irish nachos are a salty affair and the cheese/fixins to chip ratio was kind of weak but overall they were good. They were really big which is a plus and could easily be split between two people.

Truth be told we were heading for The Collins but they were packed so walked down to this place.    Treated by very friendly staff who rearranged the bar tables for us so we had one out of the wind from the door.     Extremely quick on the drink orders too which was great!   I ordered the Cesar salmon salad which was a huge helping but a tad fishy.   Nonetheless I ate every bite!    Hubby ordered the &#34;boxty&#34; which are interesting deep fried things with dip.

However, I will mention that the food preparation took a really long time, like 40 minutes. 

We got the Irish whiskey mac &#39;n cheese because my sister loves mac &#39;n cheese. However, she (and all of us) were extremely disappointed by it. There was pretty much no flavor in the cheese sauce or the corned beef. It was pretty much just a really bland dish of wet noodles. 

We also got the salmon of knowledge, which was pretty good! The salmon was cooked really well and flaky. It was drenched in some buttery sauce which gave it flavor, but I don&#39;t think the fish itself was seasoned particularly well. Speaking of which, there was just too much butter which got soaked up by the mashed potatoes and the fish.

Finally, the Emerald Isle Chicken Salad was probably the best. The chicken breast, walnuts, craisins, and apples all work together so well! It was extremely fresh and pretty filling too!

Overall, the food was pretty pricey, and it seems like we ordered some non-traditional Irish fare. I&#39;d imagine they do Irish food pretty well. But based on what we got, only 2/3 of the dishes were worth ordering."

We were looking for something that was walkable from the ferry and they were driving from Tacoma.  I will also say that it was a second couple date, so I think we were all looking for something &#39;safe&#39; that everyone could find something at.  And, I am reviewing the Pub based on other pubs.  

To start with the Staff was super friendly and it seemed that there was a lot of open tables, so we got to pick a warm booth and sit down and wait for our friends.  The beer came quickly.

My cutie ordered a Bacon Cheedar Burger and it was fine.  Not really the kind of burger that you write home about, but fine.  I am starting to wish that everywhere offered grass-fed beef, because then maybe the burgers wouldn&#39;t have to be so overcooked.  And, they lose a star for this because there are a lot of Pubs now that offer grass-fed beef.  The topping were good, and the fries where good, I like piping hot fries that are a little crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside, these were not those.

I ordered the Fish and Chips, mostly because I will never make this at home, so I often order it when I go out, because I love it and as I said, I will never make this at home.  The fish and chips worked for me.  It was crunchy and crispy, which is how I like my fried fish.

Someone else at the table ordered the Braised Pork Shanks and the last sound I heard coming from him was his licking the plate, so I am going with, &#34;I think he liked them.&#34;

And, then the salad... One person ordered a salad and frankly, salad rarely is the best choice at an Irish pub.  So, it is almost unfair to judge the place based on salad.  But, she wasn&#39;t impressed.  And, they do offer it on the menu, so I would hope they would offer a good salad.  I honestly didn&#39;t catch or remember why she didn&#39;t like it that much, so I will abstain from guessing.

Overall, I wish I had ordered the Corned Beef and Cabbage, Shepards Pie, or the Salmon of Knowledge, because I think that these dishes are more what this place is known for and would have provided a better chance to see them shine."

I&#39;d do it again. 

We ordered their $3 dollar house salad not expecting anything special, but WOW was it good. I needed a salad in my system to balance out the chicken wings I was about to order. 

The Drunken Wings: YUM. Sweet and a little bit of spicy. The fries that came with weren&#39;t anything special. 

My husband had the Irish nachos. It was a huge serving and he couldn&#39;t finish them all. Some of the chips were in for a tad too long and had a burnt taste. Some might like that, though. If I came back, I would know not to get the nachos because there are better options."

I rarely indulge in creamy clam chowder but for 2$ a cup I thought I&#39;d give it a whirl and I&#39;m glad I did! Lots of clams and not creamy white creamy. I was surprised at how much I liked it. Plus the real deal oyster crackers and Irish music playing I felt freaking Irish myself :) Irish &#39;merican that is.

It wasn&#39;t really busy on a monday evening, but good for us, because we got all our orders super fast! 

We had the &#34; Irish Whiskey Mac and Cheese &#34; and the &#34; Salmon of Knowledge &#34; with some side salad and a chowder. 
Beforehand we got some soda bread with (sweet!) butter, which we enjoyed as it was still hot. 
They have a huge variety of beer and whiskey, so if you are into special things, that&#39;s the place to go. 
The Mac and Cheese were really good, the Mac was on point, the cheesy whiskey sauce was great and the portion size could easily feed two people (we had to take the rest with us). 
The Salmon was cooked a bit too long for my taste, but the hazelnut sauce on top and the mashed potatoes made it a really good and interesting meal. 
The chowder was a bit spicy and there were peppers in it, what I never had before in a chowder but it was well cooked and tasted good. 

On the walls you find many many signs and posters (mostly with a beer/ guinness theme ;) ) and the atmosphere was nice. Wooden benches to sit on and irish music in the background!"

I then ordered their Corned Beef n&#39; Cabbage and their Fish n&#39; Chips. They brought out some bread as I waited for my food to come out. The guy that brought out the food clearly thought I ordered way too much food for myself, but little does he know how much food I can eat when I&#39;m &#34;rungry&#34;! My stomach usually turns into a bottomless pit after a marathon. Both of the items that I ordered tasted good and the portions were pretty generous. It&#39;s somewhat of a compliment to say that I&#39;ve had better fish and chips in Liverpool, UK. :)

The burger was still a little pink in the middle and the seasoning was just right. It wasn&#39;t too greasy and it didn&#39;t fall apart while I was trying to eat it.

Shawn O&#39;Donnell&#39;s provided an experience worth mentioning. I stumbled upon the place when searching for 3.5+ star dining options in the Seattle area near the train station. I was sold when I found a $10 for $15 deal on Yelp. 

The location is great - attached to Smith Tower. I arrived during Happy Hour. The Happy Hour menu had ample options for reasonable prices. I kicked off my afternoon with an Alaskan White served ice cold with an orange slice. I ordered the fish &amp; chips for an entrée. I was pleasantly surprised with the superb quality for pub/bar food. The fish had a delicate, well-seasoned coating, which provided a flaky interior. The tasty tartar sauce seemed homemade - creamy and flavorful packing a mild kick. The fries were equally delicious - thick and hot! Pass the malt vinegar!

More impressively, the service was hands down the best I&#39;ve had in Seattle. The waiter (also serving as a bartender and covering the entire restaurant) was beyond accommodating. I appreciated his upbeat demeanor and speedy service. Overall, I&#39;d highly recommend Shawn O&#39;Donnell&#39;s for your next happy hour. You will leave satisfied in more ways than one!"

What was I thinking? I ordered two burgers; one medium, one medium-rare, and both had not a wiff of freshness about &#39;em.  Both had obviously spent enough time under the heat lamps for the cheese adorning them to break.  I guess if you order food from Shawn O&#39;Donnell&#39;s near closing time, you had better have a few drinks in you to make you a compliant customer.

Although the food is not necessarily light on calories, it definitely hits the spot. They also have a nice beer selection! Also, the customer service is excellent. My friend and I came in for St. Patty&#39;s day and as you can imagine it was BUSY. My friend was visiting Seattle and was not familiar with the local beer, so our waiter brought her samples of beer to try. It is not uncommon for restaurants to do this, but it was nice of our waiter to offer samples given how busy the restaurant was. In all, this place is fantastic!!"

The server was very nice, very accomodating and did an all around good job, I tipped her more than standard. I went during happy hour, plenty of people but was seated promptly. Standard atmosphere, friendly, it was a nice day so that always helps in the rainy northwest. I ended up getting the corned beef with soda bread and a shepherd&#39;s pie, both from the HH menu. The prices were good for HH. It came out pretty fast, not the best food though. The corned beef was very dry, the soda bread was very dense but the flavor was fine with butter. The shepherd&#39;s pie was somewhat bland and the mashed potatoes tasted old and were not very fluffy. I guess fluffy potatoes is a preference though. Maybe I just got the wrong items from the menu but I wish I had went somewhere else to eat. But everything else made up for the lack in taste, otherwise this could have been a 2 or 1 star review."

I ordered a pint ($5.50) which I enjoyed as it was an Oktoberfest seasonal.
I also ordered their Rasher Burger - Irish Rasher (kinda like thick bacon) which came with chipotle mayo, an egg, and all the fixings. Chipotle mayo could not be tasted. Pretzel bun was too thick I could barely eat. Worst of all burger was WAY under cooked. Upon first bite everything was fine and dandy until I took another and noticed a lot of pink. I cut the burger in half and noticed it nearly looked rare. As I was in a rush I did not mention to waitress but rather just took it off the bun and picked at the rest. 
I also subbed for onion rings....which were so crunchy and seemingly over cooked my jaw literally hurt after eating :( 
Left rather saddened that the meal was super MEH. 
Should have opted for something else but after reading the reviews I was near certain it would have been a decent meal. Ugh. 
For  a meal that cost me upwards of $20 including tax...I think I ate maybe $5 worth and would not want to come back. 
Staff was prompt and friendly, full bar. Clean atmosphere and TVs. That&#39;s what the 2 stars are for."

It&#39;s very dark even at high noon on a sunny day and oblong rather than wide in there due to higher priced real estate I&#39;m sure.  It took a few minutes for someone to see us, probably because it was so dark - lol.  They sat us down in a booth with surprisingly high wooden edges that are probably useful in keeping well-oiled customers from sliding out of them, but for short people like me I sort of fell into the seat rather than sitting!  I salvaged my dignity with a pint of Guiness and splitting a fish and chips with my friend.  After listening to Irish folk songs for an hour, I started to wonder how the staff stayed sane -- and wondered briefly, if they didn&#39;t although they really are nice people.  They use an herbed breading instead of battering their chips, but both the fish and the fries are well flavored.  Three pieces were just right for the two of us, but I like that they offer the price of one more piece if you&#39;re partial to even numbers.  I&#39;d have preferred the Guinness at room temp but the buzz I got was still the same and made for an interesting walk home.  These are indeed the days, my friends.  :)"

The corned beef was as good as always and I tried the Irish Boxty Cakes for the first time. I had no idea they were so good and plan on having them my next visit. The wait staff was attentive but it took a little while to get our bill. The bill was incorrect but they corrected it quickly and we were on our way.

The reuben, which they advertise as being their best selling sandwich, was very good however nothing about it stood out from any other reuben I&#39;ve ever had. The chowder was also good, but they did not give me a spoon with my order so I had to drink it out of the cup which was unpleasant.

I came here most recently for a weekday lunch. I ordered the California burger. It was a good-sized burger, I got it with a side of fries and a side salad. The burger was pretty filling so I only ate half for lunch. The Caesar salad was a very average Caesar salad but I like my vegetables.

I also tried my friend&#39;s quesadilla, and it was pretty good. Except it had olives, and I don&#39;t really understand why anybody puts olives in a quesadilla...

Anyway, I think I&#39;d give this place a 3.5 stars, plus an extra 0.5 for personality. Service has always been consistently good."

I didn&#39;t dislike this place, but I sure didn&#39;t find it to be a 4 star location.

We came on a Sunday night after being referred to the pub on 2nd... except there were a couple, but this one was open and the first we saw, so that&#39;s where we landed.

After a look at the menu, my husband and I both ordered the fish, chips and chowder.  I will admit that he seemed to really like everything, with the exception of the chowder being lukewarm, which is a big NoNo in a restaurant.  I guess I&#39;m pickier.  The Fries were okay - nothing special, but there weren&#39;t many of them, just a small scattering.  The fish pieces were TINY.  It reminded me of getting breaded fish in a frozen Van De Kamp box.  They weren&#39;t BAD, but not what I picture when I think fish and chips in a restaurant. It came out super fast, so I figure it&#39;s just sitting back there waiting for soeone to order it.  Darn it, I should have taken a picture.  Then the chowder was lukewarm.  I wasn&#39;t a big fan of it in general, a little too chunky for my taste, but the temperature freaked me out... it&#39;s my Public Health Background, so I gave mine to my husband.  

He mentioned to the waitress that the soup was not at proper temp and she asked if he wanted her to warm it.  He said yes and we were both confused if she was going to just warm the one we had or bring another, but she did bring another and take away the chilly one.  He really enjoyed the hot cup of soup.

We both ordered Diet Cokes and had to ask for refills even though the cups were clearly empty while she was at our table.  The service was okay, but not super attentive.

Overall, everything was OK.  I wouldn&#39;t return though.  Too many other restaurants out there to go back somewhere with a less than great experience."

Our server was great and we enjoyed our food. They ran out of many menu items because of the large volumes of customers this day. I would like to go back and try more of their menu. 

I liked the soda bread with sweetened butter we got for the table although the bread was on the milder end as far as soda bread goes. Still tasty and I had two pieces.

I ordered the Shepard&#39;s pie and it was very good. The portion was generous and the dish was hot! I think there was a ton of butter in this dish.

I tasted the whiskey mac and cheese which had pieces of corned beef incorporated throughout and I enjoyed that, too. 

My Irish coffee was solid as it should be at an Irish bar. I would definitely return. We had a great experience! 

Normally I don&#39;t think reviewing a place after only one visit and on an extraordinary day is fair. If we had had a poor experience I would have given them a break and chalked it up to the huge crowds and unusual circumstances. 

In spite of the high volume and running out of menu items they still delivered tasty, hot food and friendly service so I think they deserve a good review after our one visit. I would love to go back."

From the time we walked in from the cold, we were greeted with a smile and enthusiasm by our waiter/bartender.  He even said he&#39;d been waiting for us and of course we had the prime table all to ourselves!  There were four of us with two more on the way so we settled in for some food and drinks!  

The Happy Hour menu is no less than perfection!  A huge assortment with varying prices that allow you to sample nearly everything they&#39;ve got.  And we did!!  We ordered the Soda Bread (soft and warm) with Corned Beef (melt in your mouth amazing), Irish Nachos (LARGE order of fresh crispy potato chips), Boxty Cakes (loaded perfection), Wings (oh so crispy) &amp; Fries, Chowder (a little salty) and the icing on the cake, the Dubliner Melt I ordered for myself!  If all of their sandwiches are as good as that one I&#39;ll be back every time I go to Seattle!

Wait was a little long to be seated(25min.) with no place to sit. But I guess it can be expected at an Irish Bar on such an occasion. The firemen bagpipers were there so we were able to enjoy the entertainment while we waited. We were finally seated at a table directly in front of the door so everytime someone came in or out a huge gust of cold wind was thrust in our faces. No other seating available so we just bared it.

We ordered the corned beef &amp; cabbage &amp; it was divine! The corned beef was so tender &amp; juicy it melted in your mouth. Great flavor also. Came with mashed potatoes &amp; a slab of cabbage.Cabbage was a little too well done to my liking but ok. Little horseradish for extra flavor. Combined with a beer it was a very satisfying meal. I have had the fish &amp; chips here before &amp; they are also good. Going back soon for a Reuben!"

The food always tastes fresh and is served piping hot. I&#39;ve had the shepherds pie, bacon burger, fish n&#39; chips, drunken wings, and the Sante Fe wrap - all fantastic. The corned beef and cabbage is hearty, filling, and probably my favorite item on the menu. The only food item I wasn&#39;t very impressed with was the London Broil - the vegetables were fantastic but the steak was a little tough.

The portions are generous, especially considering the price you pay. I&#39;ve never left this place without being completely full and satisfied (the fact that they offer free refills on fries may have something to do with that). The lunch specials ($8.99 on 5 of their menu items) they have are ridiculously cheap in comparison to the same food elsewhere in the area. On top of that, their happy hour specials are very reasonable.

The servers here are generally very friendly. There have been a few times where I though the service was a bit slow, but every time I&#39;ve raised a concern with one of the servers they&#39;ve been quick to act on the issue. 

Overall, it&#39;s an unpretentious pub restaurant with excellent food offerings at very reasonable prices."

I finally made it by this afternoon for a late lunch. The atmosphere and decor were way different than I had anticipated but in a good way. The decor was modern yet inviting. 

It happened to be happy hour so although we don&#39;t usually get appetizers, we figured why not! We got the GG sliders which were amazing! There were two sliders of a decent size so we each got one. The bun was reminiscent of a typical baguette and had a wonderful texture. The chicken was a pretty large portion and the pickled vegetables were crunch and delicious. Lastly, there was a wasabi aioli that made it impossible to stop eating it. 

For the main dish, my husband got the banh mi burger and I got the beef pho. The pho was just what I wanted on such a cold day. The broth was light yet extremely flavorful. The noodles were slightly thicker than what you would normally get at other pho places which was a welcomed change. The beef was nice and tender and rounded out a wonderful bowl of pho. 

In contrast to the very traditional elements of my pho, the banh mi burger was very clearly a re imagination of a standard banh mi and man on man was it good!! The meat was tender and well seasoned, the pickled vegetables were amazing, and the Sriracha aioli that they slathered on was crazy addictive.  The burger was accompanied by thick cut fries. Although I will eat any fry that is put in front of me, they are for sure not all created equal. Their fries were so good! They had a nice crunch on the out side but tender and fluffy on the inside. 

The last thing that I wanted to tip my hat to was their menu. They made an effort to point out which items on their menu had peanuts and that earns some serious points in my book. I don&#39;t see that very often, if ever, on menus and I really appreciated it. 

Thanks for an amazing meal and I hope to come back soon!!"

The first time I came here one of the first things I noticed was how unbelievably on point their music was. I don&#39;t know if they were playing from the radio or from their own playlist, but regardless I remember vividly the melodic and entrancing sounds of Odesza and Kaskade ringing through the air.

It was at that moment that I realized that I would forever pledge my pho allegiance to MeeKong, and pledge it I did.

After I tried their special Spicy Mala Pho dish, which adds a spicy Sichuan twang to traditional pho, my loyalty was only further engrained.

It doesn&#39;t stop there though... their ice cream is equally as stunning; the Pandan flavor ice cream left me speechless... holy pho-camole.

Can confirm: MeeKong bar is lit- literally one of the best pho restaurants in all of downtown Seattle. Come thru."

I didn&#39;t make reservations, so by the time we realized the wait would be 90+ minutes I turned to my trusty Yelp app to see what amazing eateries were nearby. To our luck, MeeKong was only 3 minutes away from where we were standing.

MeeKong is your true Vietnamese restaurant with the hanging bead curtains and an endearing touch of Seattle. I feel like no restaurant in town goes without exposed lightbulbs and funky bathrooms. Bathrooms--you have to check out the ones at this restaurant. The men&#39;s bathroom has Sherlock Holmes (or so my boyfriend tells me...) written from wall-to-wall in chalk, and the ladies&#39;? None other than Jane Austen&#39;s Pride &amp; Prejudice. A personal favorite of mine from high school AP Literature. :-)

We ordered the bánh mì burgers: the MeeKong burger (beef patty) and the Double G aka The Ga Ga burger (chicken). Both sandwiches came with pickled daikon &amp; carrot, tomato, lettuce, and wasabi aioli. The Double G was a messy one, but every bite was worth it. I&#39;ll be honest and say you can skip the sriracha fries for the extra $0.50. Didn&#39;t really get a kick out of the sriracha powder. The waiter got my order mixed out with my boyfriend&#39;s where he ended up with my sriracha fries...which was totally fine by me!

You can also skip the Vietnamese coffee. They didn&#39;t give enough condensed milk, which is what ca phe sua da is all about!

Loved the atmosphere and location of this restaurant. Our waiter was also very attentive and friendly. Will definitely come back for more bánh mì burgers!"

Pork baos - tender pork served with cucumbers and cilantro, could use a sauce to make it more juicy. 

Beef Sliders - again a little too dry, needs more sauce. 

Pandan ice cream - the only place in Seattle I know that serves Pandan ice cream, it&#39;s a little artificial though. 

Not the best food, I would only recommend happy hour."

We ordered the chicken wings, pork belly buns, chicken burger, a couple of buns (noodles with grilled meats and the works). The flavors were spot on and everything had a very fresh feel to it.

We still like this place, however after several weeks and attempts they are not consistent in Pho temperatures. Some weeks it&#39;s on point, and some weeks it&#39;s too cold and my meat will stay too rare.


This is really great pho. Great atmosphere too! My husband and I have eaten here 3 times in the past couple of weeks. They&#39;re accommodating to my request for added broccoli to my pho (I love veggies in my pho).
We had their sliders the other day as well which were really great too.
My only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is I wish their broth had a little more seasoning to it and it can be a little salty at times."

Turned out they have happy hour all week long, so we scored some good happy hour deals: $5 garlic chicken wings and $5 pork buns. We over-ordered, so we got to sample quite a few things. For the most part, the dishes are on the blander side. I think it&#39;s intentionally so. The garlic chicken wings were good, perfectly crispy and juicy. The braised pork slices had an awkward consistency, where it&#39;s not exactly melt-in-your-mouth tender and also not crispy or caramelized (which is the only two forms of pork belly that I know of). I like that they put fresh apple slices in the pork buns, which adds a nice crunchy texture and a bit of sweetness to break up the fatty pork. I ordered the chicken fried rice, which came with a HUGE amount of white meat chicken. It was a 50/50 composition of rice and chicken, which is a bit much. James had the grilled pork and egg roll vermicelli bowl. 

Portion was good, service was very attentive and friendly, menu has a good variety of options, and cheap drinks. I know it&#39;s a bar, but it would&#39;ve been nice if the dishes had bolder flavors. This is like the GAP of Asian food: you can find a nice selection of good, basic everyday stuff, but nothing that&#39;ll wow you."

We didn&#39;t have to wait and it wasn&#39;t so busy. There was what looked like one waiter. He handled things pretty well considering it got busier as we were there. We ordered the garlic wings and shrimp spring rolls to start. The roll on one of the shrimp rolls was extremely tough.. like they didn&#39;t soak them in water long enough before rolling. The garlic wings had a good crunch and they weren&#39;t floured which I appreciated. They weren&#39;t very garlicky though. 

For our mains, I ordered the beef pho and my friend ordered a tofu dish. The broth was pretty flavorful. Pho is one of my favorite bowls and I hate when you get a bad broth. It was a tad salty, but once I put a little Sriracha and hoisin sauce, it was better.  My friend enjoyed hers, but they forgot her egg. That was quickly fixed. 

We were there for a good hour and a half. The waiter was friendly the whole time. Overall the place was pretty solid. I liked that they had a lot of options that were clearly marked gluten free on the menu. Great if you suffer from allergies like me.

I left a $4.50 tip and days later find out that they charged me $14.50 for the tip. The total bill was $34 so my credit card company flagged it and informed me. Yay for Capital One!

I had the receipt from the restaurant so I double checked it, then proceeded to call the restaurant to complain. Here&#39;s where it gets worse. I spoke to the manager, Ellen, she was super apologetic and said that the same waiter, Alex, had also overcharged others and that he no longer worked there. So, I emailed her my receipt for proof and she informed me that she would refund the whole tip. She invited me to the grand opening and said it would be taken care of...that was 3/4/16. On 3/11/16, I emailed again because there was no refund. Ellen stated that she &#34;told the bank to do a refund on the card a while back.&#34;  She offered cash but I&#39;m not going back in.  Its now 3/22/16, plenty of time for the bank to issue the refund, so I am disputing the charge from my end to finish off this issue. Good intentions, no follow through.

Food was ok, def americanized asian kinda food...2.5 to 3 stars. I had the Pork &amp; Egg Roll Vermicelli and the best part was the fresh greens, rest of it was ok. My daughter had the shrimp &amp; green beans, shrimp was less than, we didn&#39;t eat them but green beans and sauce were decent.

They lose a star for a dishonest waiter, and another star because there was no follow through with my situation. Ellen was sweet and seemed like she was going to do the right thing, but I saw no execution...it should have been fixed within days.

I will not be back, too many other places to go in Belltown."

I was shocked by how flavorful. They have a meat burger which was perfect and vegetarian with taro that&#39;s just as good but needs something to firm up the parties more. The bread uses crispy and just right for the sandwich.

Currently doing soft opening so there is room for improvement, such as the fries. I was really worried about coming here with the description &#34;Asian fusion, burgers and pho.&#34; Asian fusion is scary enough and burgers and pho seem like a confusing mix. The menu isn&#39;t too Fusiony. The burgers are a take on a banh mi so they work. The pho and the noodle dishes look good as well. The fries aren&#39;t hot or crispy enough and the spice upgrade need more of a kick so they need to work on it.

The staff are nice and need to work out a few kinks, like Asian soup spoons with pho since western spoons can&#39;t handle it.

The decor is very similar to the restaurant that was here before. Needs a little more color I think."

walking up to the restaurant to paying our bill. I ordered the satay pho and it was rich and flavorful in all the right ways. The virgin strawberry lemonade with basil will knock your socks off."

My date and I were wandering around Belltown looking for something to eat after the Chihuly Glass Museum and decided on MeeKong because it was new and had good reviews. Right when I stepped into the place I realized I had been in that same restaurant a year ago, but it was Twisted Pasty. But Twisted Pasty is no more, now it is MeeKong Bar. 

Anyways, it was Sunday night and not busy. We were able to pick whatever table we wanted. 

We ordered:
- Pork Vermecilli
- Mango tofu salad

My salad was good, I wasn&#39;t really hungry. I tried a bite of his pork and it was tasty. This is a Viet Fusion kinda place. I will have to try their bahn mi burger next time."

As mentioned below, the service was superb. After ordering the Satay Beef Pho, our waiter suggested a special off-the-menu house pho called Malat Satay Beef Pho. If you like spicy Pho then this dish is for you! It was super flavorful and the broth was more rich than your usual Pho. It was delicious and spicy as expected. 

My date ordered the Lemongrass tofu vermicelli bowl which was awesome. Everything in it tasted great and very fresh, the tofu being some of the best I&#39;ve had. I have to mention the portions, as they were a very good size, perfect for sharing and swapping dishes! Finally, we finished with some of their house made ice cream in vietnamese flavors (Pandan $ Vietnamese Coffee) which was super tasty and different from your traditional flavors.

All in all good food, good prices, good sizes, and good service."

I highly recommend!

Delicious food, and wonderful service. We had the Garlic Chicken, Pork Belly Baos, Panko Tempura Shriimp and the ginger crème brulee, but my favorite of the evening was the  Banh Mi sliders. I expected pickled veggies on a regular burger. It was so much more.... the meat was so flavorful with a mixture of Asian seasonings, and in a house made bun!  Everything arrived the correct temperature, I&#39;m a stickler for that. Can&#39;t wait to go back and try more items.

This time I got the pork belly bao and boy, let me tell you, it was amazing. Pack with flavor, tender and just enough sauce so it wasn&#39;t overly dry. 

Service was on point again, server was attentive, refilled my water without asking and checked on us frequently. 

Got the wings as well, Asian style wings are always my favorite and these were to die for. 

Tried another ice cream flavor but I&#39;d say the pandan is still my favorite so far."

I ordered the Meekong Burger, pork bao buns, and limeade. The banh mi burger consists of what is actually in some banh mi sandwiches. A baguette bun (pretty stiff), beef patty, pickled veggies, and I think sriracha mayo(?). All burgers come with fries and you can upgrade those to sriracha seasoned! 

The customer service was very pleasant and quick.

Pork Belly Bao - amazing. It melts in your mouth

Garlic Chicken Wings - super crispy, perfect amount of seasoning outside and inside. The meat was great and not dry

Mango and Crispy Tofy salad - the  best salad I&#39;ve ever had in an Asian restaurant. Perfect combination of sweet and sour. The tofu was very crispy.

Their happy hour garlic wings and pork belly bao is the highlight of the day. Garlic wings are always coming out piping hot with a side of pickled vegetables and fried garlic pieces that i always love. The grannys pork belly bao had a nice white fluffy bread/taco like bun with a melt in your mouth piece of pork belly, a slice of apple(grannys smith, hence the name) and plum sauce.The atmosphere the very modern, the bar and drinks are fun and the staff are all beautiful!

Heaven! And a lot of food. 

They need a lunch menu - $13 for lunch is a bit much. But it&#39;s a lot of food. Maybe a lunch menu where dishes have less food but cost less?"

The pho was good with a good broth. My fiancé also liked his burger but couldn&#39;t taste the lemongrass flavor too well. 

But the service leaves something to be desired. There was only one waiter I saw who was also playing bartender so he didn&#39;t notice us for about ten mins after walking past us a few times.

I found this restaurant on Yelp and found that it was fairly new and had good reviews. It was a Tuesday afternoon around 3 PM. Restaurant has a modern decor with a bar and there&#39;s is also an area off to the left where you can probably sit bigger parties. We sat at the table in front if the fireplace which was nice since it was cold and pouring outside! The menu had a good selection of alcoholic drinks. The best part was that it was happy hour so some of the drinks and appetizers were a couple of dollars off. We ordered pork spring rolls, pork belly bao and garlic wings. I had a drink called cucumber watermelon and my niece had a lychee martini. Drinks were good and not stingy with the alcohol!  the appetizers were fabulous! The pork belly in the pork belly baos were very flavorful. Garlic wings were extra crispy. 
I had a total of 6 people in my group and so we ordered a short rib dish that came with rice, longan chicken I think was the name of the dish, chicken phad Thai, beef pho and a burger named the banh mi burger that&#39;s like a banh mi sandwich but burger style! All the food was amazingly good! And to top it off we ordered a tiramisu for my daughters birthday and even that was tasty! 
The restaurant wasn&#39;t busy so we got our food in a timely manner. We were able to chit chat with our waitress and she told us it&#39;s actually her sister that owns the restaurant and they just opened up about a month ago. She was such a sweetheart!
I would definitely be coming back to this restaurant! Too bad I live so far for it otherwise I&#39;d be there all the time! Thank you for making my daughters birthday lunch memorable!"

The decor is more modern with less tradition. There is also a bar if you are looking for a drink but we didn&#39;t go to the bar so I don&#39;t know how their drinks are. More about the food, you can get fusion food like burgers and things but they also have traditional. You can get single dishes and if you are with a group and you want to share you can get bigger plates. 

If you are looking for traditional Vietnamese food this isn&#39;t really the place to go, but it is still pretty good. But if you want fast, and good food go here. Also of you are into Pokémon Go they set down Poke Stop lures and if you show them which Pokémon you got and share them on Facebook cebook they will give you a free spring roll dish, or half off an appetizers. To sum it up... This place has good food."

For lunch, we got the Mekong burger, Thai iced teas, and tendon/meatball pho. The food was tasty and traditional enough for it to satisfy pho hankerings.  Started with delicious mini carrot/zuchinni muffins that reminded me of a less sugary version of carrot cake.  Also, reasonably priced, great service, kid friendly, and had variety.

I&#39;ll be back for EtOH drinks later."

I love going to a small local place where they put in a lot of attention to using made from scratch components. The bun was great and not from costco! The patty was a little thin, but delicious. The fries were a little soggy by the time I got back to the office but they were pretty basic. My co worker got the vermicelli bowl with spring rolls and it looked bomb and the portion was large!

The fries were well seasoned and tasted great with the beer I had. The light dusting of sriracha was a nice touch. Spring rolls were great, as was the sauce that accompanied them. There was something delightfully crunchy on the inside. The pork buns were a bit dry, since they didn&#39;t have any sauce inside. The buns themselves don&#39;t seem to have been steamed for long enough, and the pork was relatively dry (either not a fatty cut or cooked for so long that the fat cooked off)."

I ordered the chicken noodle Pho with extra veggies.   The other members of our party got the beef Pho with extra noodles.   Neither of the extras were necessary as the bowl was filled to the brim with noodles, meat and the usual sides.  We all loved the soup.

I got the chicken tenders and fries. I must say, probably the best chicken tenders I&#39;ve ever had. Whether it was the batter or how it tasted...either way I was sold and it wasn&#39;t ordinary chicken tenders and fries but it came with stick veggies and dips as well.

Sat at a table for a few minutes, another couple sat down at the table next to us 5 minutes later. The server came by - took their drink order, didn&#39;t turn to us once. The other couple received drinks, appetizer and finally (as the other table was paying their check) someone completely different came by to ask if we had our drink order taken. We placed our drink order - other couple leaves. Few minutes later someone comes by to ask if we need anything. A few minutes after someone else tells us our drinks will be right out. Again someone comes by later to ask if we need anything or want to order food.

Long story short 30 minutes for 2 drinks that were at best OK - no apology or acknowledgment for long wait.

Drinks ordered:
- Rye Buck
- Mary Tyler (missing the &#34;fried cured meat&#34; as described on menu but chili was a really good on garnish - was the only good thing about either of the drinks)

I guess what bothers me over everything and probably the only reason I&#39;m irritated enough to write a Yelp review is that based on the behavior of three different staff members it seemed clear they were very much aware service had broken down for us - but no one offered an apology or even inquired outside of frequent, uncoordinated  check backs after 20-25 minutes of not being acknowledged.

There are several tables as well as a counter on the inside portion that connects to the kitchen. Pretty small place so the servers will ask if you want to eat on the bench outside or just wait around. Waiting for a seat doesn&#39;t take too long. 

I ordered the taco platter which comes with 3 tacos of your choice, rice, and beans, as well as a side salsa. For around $10, it&#39;s filling and price is fair. The tacos were stuffed so I separated the tortilla on some of them and split the filling so it seemed like I ate 5 tacos instead of 3. The beef brisket was DELICIOUS. So flavorful and mouthwatering. The green chile chicken honestly had little to no flavor so I drenched this one in salsa and Tapatio. The carne asada was flavorful as well, but I&#39;ve never had a taco with brisket - that was truly fantastic. Beans were standard, boring pinto beans and the rice wasn&#39;t anything to write about either. If it wasn&#39;t for the delicious avocado crema salsa (mild, creamy, tastes like slight avocado and sour cream to me) then I wouldn&#39;t have enjoyed the rice and beans. 

The horchata here is good but mix it well as the bottom gets thick and stuff sinks to the bottom of the glass. If you&#39;re a churro lover, you MUST try one here. So fresh and delicious. It will be raining cinnamon and sugar as you eat it though. You have been warned."

Here&#39;s a great date night plan for you: Drinks at the Octopus bar, independent movie and popcorn at the historic Landmark theater right next door, then dinner right across the street at TNT Taqueria, capped off with a nice walk through Meridian park and a self guided tour through the awesome community garden there.

Good and affordable - but the best is that it is simple, the walk-up window and inside seating makes it a hybrid between a traditional restaurant and a food truck. It&#39;s not fast food, though, as it&#39;s great grub - and you can even see into the kitchen. Great salsas too!"

It has that street style, like somewhere you stop when you&#39;re out with friends and don&#39;t really have any purpose, but want to chill and chat, somewhere without commitment. We wanted some Mexican food and coffee tonight, and there aren&#39;t many places that blend the two so naturally, so we decided tonight was the night to check it out. 

We got a variety of things ranging from the Horchata Latte to the grapefruit soda to the Chorizo Verde Tacos. The food was good, like what you&#39;d hope for from a food truck, but without the flair. The hot drinks were great, really, and paired really well the food. The Cafe con Leche was really good and helped round out the multiple flavors of my Huevos Verde. I tried the Radish and Habenero salsa, which was super hot and hit hard, in a great, delayed way, so I had to counter it with the grapefruit soda, which, while no Ting, was very refreshing. 

The person who helped us was really great and had a bright end-of-the-day attitude. I liked sitting outside as it rained a foot away, watching people walk under the neon lights of the theatres. It made for a pretty cinematic moment. 

My only complaints are that the diced potatoes were a bit boring and chewy, like they&#39;d been hanging out in a warming pan for a while, and there could have been a few things added to pump up the freshness. Though the pico and limes were bright and crisp, I wanted something else to add some bright, fresh color and taste. I guess that&#39;s where the grapefruit soda filled in, but I&#39;m not one to usually get soda and it was a choice made after we got the food. 

Nice experience with good food for a reasonable price. Friendly service and good coffee definitely round it out."

Yeah, I know.  I&#39;ve been told countless times to kiss my futile search buh-bye.

I mean I have found ONE place that I&#39;ve been to twice in Cap Hill.  The place down the street from my house seems good, but it&#39;s really just fair.

So the five stars for this place isn&#39;t cuz it&#39;s this amazing hole-in-the-wall, C or even D grade establishment (that&#39;s the good ol&#39; rating system used in L.A. which no-so-secretly holds that the worse the letter grade, the better the Mexican food really is).

I liked this place for it&#39;s non hole-in-the-wallness.  I had the 3-taco plate with 2 carne asada tacos and one with al pastor which the cashier highly suggested.  That suggestion was perhaps the best one of my life next to &#39;let&#39;s try the Chopin for your martini&#39; at Canlis.  Roasted pork on a spit with pineapples? 

Now I can&#39;t stand Canadian style pizza.  The ham and pineapple combo was never a selling point so I was a tiny bit hesitant to try the al pastor, but it was the best taco outside of carne asada and some Korean bbq taco that I&#39;ve ever had.  Ok, let&#39;s not count fusion and say it comes in 2nd and call it a day.  The meat was so flavorful AND juicy and the pineapples didn&#39;t overly contribute on the sweetness.  It was a divine combo.

I had black beans and rice with the tacos and both were as they should be.

Now, the staff could be less Seattle standoff-ish, hence the generous mood.  Like I&#39;ve mentioned in a lot of my reviews, unless you work at Nordstrom, customer relations and rapport is not the strong suit of the Seattle food service industry I&#39;ve noticed.  I let it go this time.

You can sit indoors or out.

Another thing that&#39;s not cool is the location in terms of parking.  It&#39;s off of 45th so you have to park in the tight neighborhood streets that are totally busy.

But if you let that annoyance slide, too, the reward is worth the sacrifice."

My review may be a tad bit biased but TNT is, overall, a decent place. The pineapple pork burrito came highly recommended but I went with the chorizo quesadilla and had chips n guac to share. Flavors were all there but the entrees were a bit too greasy. We all had pretty gnarly burps for the rest of the day and one of my friends (the one who ordered the burrito) got the runs... Poor thing. As far as service, atmosphere, and location goes-- not bad. The staff is friendly, the decorations are festive, and parking is a piece of cake around Wallingford.

Some of the other reviews on here crack me up- you can really tell when the writer has no concept of the food they are eating, or the business itself. To those clowns:

1) If you like spicy food, don&#39;t order the least spicy salsa they have and then complain about the lack of spice! (Face palm) it&#39;s like you&#39;re just looking for something to complain about! The same reviewer complained that the carne asada was chewy. Hint: if cooked beef isn&#39;t chewy, then it may have already been chewed for you (yuck). What, do you want them to put it in a blender for you? Sheesh.

2) A taco platter with a beer costs less than $15 here. In Wallingford, people! Land of $8.00 micro brews and $18 bowls of ramen! Get a grip. You are paying slightly more for your damn breakfast burrito because the rent on their location is higher, and it takes more people to run it. Follow the money.

Ok, rant over. Come eat here, it&#39;s pretty good! Love to see some lingua or cabeza in the protein options! Rock on."

Obviously not super authentic mexi or even mexi-cali, but the eggs are fluffy and the tortilla is great. For some reason those two ingredients seem to be some of the harder aspects for other breakfast burritos to nail so I am super duper happy with tnt&#39;s bb.

Side note: the outside decor of this place does for your eyeballs the same thing it&#39;s breakfast burritos does to your hunger: STRONGLY SATISFIES. For such a grey city, Seattle seems to favor muted tones, and so I find these incredible bursts of color to be quite delightful and refreshing. While waiting for your breakfast burrito, I suggest you stare at the walls and allow your eyeballs to drink in all the vivid fantastic color.

Side side note: when I tip, the cashiers seem extra super grateful, which almost makes me think that they rarely receive tips. What is wrong with everyone!? Tip your service industry folks!!

The chicken tacos were great, lots of flavor. We got the three plate platter. I think it would be better to change it to four tacos. The tacos are full of chicken and fillings, it&#39;s really hard to eat. It would be nice if some of the fillings from the three could be reduced and used to make the 4th taco. The tacos came with a red salsa, which I was not a fan of. It didn&#39;t really taste like salsa. It also came with some light green creamy sauce. Thought it might be guacamole but it actually tasted like sour cream. It was really good whatever it was. 

There is street parking only and a little expensive. 3 tacos came to $9. At least they tasted really good. I also like the location. Good for people watching."

Bumping them up half a notch, for their indoor seating, their colorful facade and all the beautiful tile work, but unfortunately the food is incredibly bland here, and its Mexican, so no bueno.

I kept passing this place and wanted to see for myself, but there is an equalizing factor to Yelp, and a three star or so experience is fairly consistent with what you can expect there.  For us, we both had a salad plate, which is basically TNTs version of a combo plate.  While it looked nice when they put it down, each component was fairly disappointing.  Its missing flavor. 

We found their chips not particularly good.  The salsa was hidden behind the bar, so  you have to request it.  I was halfway through my meal before realizing salsa was missing.  I mistakenly thought the tiny amount of pico de gallo they plated was it, but it was not even slightly picante (mostly just watery tomato and mild onion.) Sigh.  The pinto beans they served with the combo plate had red pepper flakes, but somehow this attempted spice imparted no flavor.  Not spicy. They used chewy, thin meat in the carne asada, and then overcooked it. Ugh. Can&#39;t recommend it, other than to say its directly across the street from Rancho Bravo."

At least when you ask my Southern Californian boyfriend who was raised on them. But luckily we encountered TNT Taqueria which is nestled in our hood and it is pretty darn tasty.

Their breakfast burritos meet all of our breakfast burrito requirements filled with soft eggs, breakfast potatoes, monterey jack, pico de gallo and your choice of meat (we went with the scrumptious chorizo verde). Slightly on the bland side flavor wise but it still passes and is fairly satisfying. 

I also ding a few points for the price to portion ratio. Granted, you still get plenty of food but it&#39;s a much smaller portion than any burrito I&#39;ve ever ordered and it&#39;s more expensive."

TNT Taqueria has been a favorite go-to for a quick bite, especially if I can&#39;t convince myself to eat a Dick&#39;s cheeseburger.

I&#39;ve sat and ate outside watching the people and traffic go past. It was also a great place to catch up on World Cup matches and scores.  I&#39;ve sat inside in proximity of the food prep area and also the tables by the windows. Makes maximum use of the available space. 

Straightforward and fresh tasting menu, but I&#39;m a boring TNT Taqueria fan. I always order the same thing - carne asada (with monterey jack cheese) quesadillas with avocado crema and pico de gallo ($8), all washed down with an ice water or two.

I&#39;d gladly smear that avocado crema on my arm and lick it while stuck in traffic. Just kidding. Okay, maybe not since it&#39;s that good!

Once in awhile I&#39;ll also get a bag of hot churros to take home to the kiddo (half a dozen $5.50).

Anyways, I thought this place was just the little window with a few seats up front, I didnt realize they had a eating/dining area right next door you can eat in after you order from the window/counter. Small dining room with like 4-5 tables and a bar area with stools you can sit at and watch the cooks cook it up.  

I decided to get some tacos and ordered the &#34;Plate&#34;, comes with 3 tacos only.  &#34;Platter&#34; comes with the 3 tacos and arroz y frijoles (rice &amp; beans). Good options to choose from: carne asada, green chili chicken, adobado, and a few more I forgot.    3 taco plate was plenty filling for lunch and was definitely tasty, the meat was good too.  Oh you get to choose a sauce too, I got the avocado crema.  

With a drink, I think it was about $7 without tip.  Dude working there was nice and helpful and friendly to chat with.  

A good taco joint, but they have other stuff there too like burritos, quesadillas and breakfast.  TNT....what does that stand for?  Like a blast of flavor goodness in my mouth?  I wasnt blown by any means while visiting TNT.  But a solid taco joint!

I go for their carne asada burritos which are marked as $7.75 on the menu but somehow come out to $8.76. Since when is sales tax 13%? The food is enjoyable but very average at the end of the day.

I got the Green Chile Chicken Burrito which was actually very good. No, the Green Chile is not anything like what you might get back in Colorado but it still tasted quite good!
They also had some pretty interesting sauces as well! I saw that they had a Habanero Radish sauce which looked SO good but apparently that is what everyone had their eye on because they were all out of it. Instead I got a Chipolte Tomato sauce for my burrito and that was very tasty!
The set up is kind of confusing. They have an area where you go to sit down but that is not where you order. There is a walk up section to the place where you place your order regardless if you are dining in or out. After you are done eating they also wish that you put your dirty dishes in trays over by the soda machine.

They probably don&#39;t make me as happy as they make some people, but every once in a while I get hit by a craving (or inspired by a conversation). This happened a couple weeks ago, so I decided to stop by this new Wallingford spot and order some tacos to-go.

The ordering process was pretty simple, and I liked what they did with the space. It&#39;s cold outside right now so I&#39;m guessing most people use the indoor space to eat, but it&#39;ll be nice to be able to grab some tacos and walk to a near-by park when it gets warmer. I like the walk-up window because it&#39;s a little unusual to have that around here, and it means you don&#39;t have to go inside unless you actually plan to eat there (or want to go inside).

I wasn&#39;t super hungry so I didn&#39;t want one of the plates or platters, so I got the brisket tacos on their own. The tacos were good and I enjoyed the different ingredients. I don&#39;t really know what &#34;authentic&#34; tacos are like, so I can&#39;t really speak about that.

The carne asada or al pastor are my favorites for meat choices. What&#39;s also nice is their menu lists where they source their protein.  It&#39;s nice to know that their chicken is from Draper Valley farms, their beef is grass-fed cattle and so forth.  And if meat is not your thing, they have vegetarian options. If you like spicy, DEFINITELY ask for sauce.

It had the ambiance of something special on 45th St. and was hoping that the food would match, so I suggested to my better side to try it.    We ordered the Al Pastor tortas and the burrito, some chips and guacamole with a couple of beers.   The beer is cold so it was the best part of the meal.   The chips were kind a fatty with no taste and the guacamole was almost the consistency of being blended instead of made fresh using a fork.

As for the burrito it had no particular flavor and was bland and I asked for some hot sauce; but they were out so I used some of those catsup packages hot sauce to give it some flavor.  It didn&#39;t help.   The tortas looked better, but was on basically the same thing on a typical hoagie bun.

TNT is a bad execution of a Taco Truck in a store front.  There&#39;s not a good selection of home made sauces, ingredients quality can be way better and the only high point is the beer is cold; but didn&#39;t come with a lime.

Go to Miami, it&#39;s what it is. The&#39;ll just add a ton of sugar unless you tell them not to. Been there lots. Had many. Half the places call it a latte.

Then I had the nerve to ask if they had any morning pastries, since none were on display; as an answer, she shrugs.  I get her message, and then say, &#34;even a churro?&#34;  She says that they have them; again - they are not displayed. I ask (oh god, I know I&#39;m going to get creamed) &#34;how long are they?

Really, I should have walked away, but I didn&#39;t. My bad. There was no line, there was no rush. A simple question met with distain.

She was a rude as the day is long.  Must be from New York, or Palo Alto. Turns out their cafe con leche is spiced, which makes it a Mexican Coffee - and it wasn&#39;t even a good one. It was just this side of awful, so the contents ended up n the storm drain. Although, I&#39;m glad I paid for the swill coffee. Now I have the right to document what a lousy experience it was.

This is a great little find on 45th Street. I live in Wallingford and don&#39;t find many of the restaurants on 45th very worthwhile but TNT is a little gem. What I love most about their menu is VARIETY! Their food is simple and guaranteed to hit the spot. 

I am a huge fan of vegetarian options. TNT has great potato options if you want to stray away from meat. Their potatoes are flavor and delicious! You would be amazed how of a kick these potatoes have.  It is a great option for vegetarians or non-vegetarians. 

I&#39;ve had most of their tacos and they never disappoint. I would definately make a priority to order the al pastor tacos. I am a huge al pastor taco fan and have a hard time finding a good one in Seattle. This is probably my favorite one. First of all, their pork isn&#39;t all fat. Second, they cook the pork to perfection. Al pastor tacos taste best and sweetest when cooked longer. TNT does it just right! It is flavorful and delicious! 

Also, they have churros and horchatta! WINNING! How can you not love a place that has an extensive menu but still true to simple Mexican food?!"

I found it online while searching through a number of private dining facilities online in the Seattle area.

The prior communication with Jen Osborn was brilliant. She was such a help in finding a price point that worked well for us, and made it all very clear up front what the prices would be, and what was available to us etc... Jen was a star!

We hadn&#39;t gone to visit the venue before we booked in, but they let us come and take a look, and were so kind to show us around, and the venue was just as it was in the pictures, if not even better!

We turned up yesterday evening to Adam, our host and server for the night. Adam showed us all around the Cellar Room, set our music up for us, asked us how we would like the lighting, and asked what our preferences were for the food timing etc...

Throughout the whole evening Adam was an absolute star, a fine balance between letting us be ourselves, and have fun and communicating what each course was etc...

The food was brilliant - such good quality, and such a huge amount of it! We absolutely loved it and hope that we can come back again next year!

Thank you Staple and Fancy, and particularly Adam, Jen and the cooks on Sunday, Dec 4th!"

It&#39;s located off the main road and it&#39;s kind of tucked away on a small street. The ambiance of the place is really cozy and it&#39;s cool how open the floor plan of the restaurant is. With so many options on the menu, we just decided to do the tasting menu for $55 a person. It comes with 7 appetizers, 2 entrees and a dessert. It&#39;s a pretty good deal if you ask me. If there are more people in your party, they just increase the portion sizes of the dishes. The portion sizes are great to begin with; you&#39;ll definitely walk away full and satisfied.

If you go with the tasting menu, the servers don&#39;t even know exactly what you are going to get. It&#39;s entirely up to the chef so the whole surprise aspect is pretty appealing considering there are so many options to choose from. Of all of the appetizers we got, my favorites have got to be the proscuitto, beef tartare and seared tuna. The proscuitto was delicately cut and the tartare was exceptional. Both the tartare and seared tuna had a great texture and the tuna was thickly cut. What let me down was the arancini di riso and tomato soup. The arancini wasn&#39;t cheesy enough for my liking. It felt like it wasn&#39;t melted enough on the inside and the risotto was too dry. The soup was bland and didn&#39;t pack much flavor. The last 2 appetizers, the mozzarella and salad, were pretty standard in my opinion.

For the entrees, I loved the spaghetti nero with clams! The pasta was cooked perfectly - al dente. The whole dish was phenomenal! I liked how there were crumbs added on top which gave the dish a nice texture and consistency so that you&#39;re not sick of the noodles halfway through. The other entree we got was the pork chop. I&#39;m always skeptical on pork chop because it tends to be a little on the drier side of things. While the pork chop was pretty moist, I wish there was a better sauce that accompanied it. It was pretty lackluster eating the pork chop by itself with no genuine sauce to accompany it. 

The dessert was this flan with cookie crumbs. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the best flan I&#39;ve ever had but it was definitely good. To be perfectly honest, I was so full from all of the appetizers and entrees that I barely had room in my stomach for dessert.

In all, Staple &amp; Fancy is a fantastic restaurant. There are going to be some things you love and some things you dislike. That&#39;s what you get with a tasting menu and I&#39;m glad I checked this place out on my visit to Seattle!"

Appetizer #4 was Grilled Pears with homemade ricotta and balsamic, my partner described this as the &#34;best food to ever go in her mouth.&#34; For the main course we got Pork Tenderloin with figs, a homemade &#34;apple sauce&#34; and mustard seed cabbage.

We were luckily able to make a reservation for a Friday only a day or so advance, and when we arrived we were seated promptly.

The food was phenomenal. We did the chef&#39;s tasting menu for $55/person before tax and an automatic 20% service fee. Our table of four received seven appetizers, two entrees, and various desserts. The appetizers came out extremely quickly one after another, while there were longer gaps between the other courses. All plates were fresh and delicious, and by the time we were done our entire table was full.

One aspect of Staple &amp; Fancy I especially liked is that the restaurant was able to meet our dietary needs. Our table had two pescetarians and an individual who didn&#39;t like any sauces whatsoever on their food. After informing the waiter of this, the kitchen was able to alter the courses to meet the restrictions for each person. So great.

They also gave my brother a handwritten card for his birthday, which was present upon being seated at the restaurant. It was a simple gesture, but we appreciated it. Furthermore, the service was also wonderful; our water was constantly being refilled, and the table was wiped clean between courses.

I&#39;m looking at the pictures I took of the dinner right now and missing it. We will undoubtedly be returning."

Great value if you have a big appetite.  Sit back with an open mind and get ready for what felt like 20+ different dishes.  While there were some great dishes but for us it was a little too much food and just didn&#39;t feel right.  But we had similar experience at Altura.  I would recommend staple and fancy over the other.  We have tried tasting menu around the world and my favorite so far has been in Columbia, where the chef included pallet cleanser such as a frozen citrus icicle on a cinnamon stick and we believe perfectly timed pallet cleansers as such is needed."

The fish entree was much too small, imagine a piece of fish that is half the size of a deck of cards and you had to share that. 

The menu is not as creative as we would have liked because upon looking at old reviews you can see that it barely changes from month to month. The dessert was overkill. Death by chocolate. I wish we had gotten the ricotta cheesecake that another table received for the tasting. For the price it was okay, I don&#39;t think I would be back again."

I&#39;m surprised it wasn&#39;t in higher demand, as a part of the Ethan Stowell family. I stupidly didn&#39;t realize that it&#39;s next to the Walrus and the Carpenter. If I go back, I&#39;d do happy hour at W&amp;C, but not too much, to save room for the fantastic chef&#39;s tasting menu.

Go &#34;fancy&#34; for $55/person, and get a perfect amount of stunning food. I couldn&#39;t even keep track of how many rounds of appetizers we got before the proteins came out. I also only got pictures of half of the beautiful plates - but rightfully because I was enjoying them rather than staring at them.

Standouts:

Seared albacore on octopus pasta and navy beans - almost made a fish and octopus fan out of me
Pork belly - the fattest pieces I&#39;ve seen or had in my life. I actually gasped when it came out.
Some kind of pasta with guanciale - you only need to care about the guanciale swimming in cream
Ravioli - marcona almonds should go over everything, always. The perfect amount of woody.
Cod - the only fish I genuinely love, over a refreshing corn puree and seaweed strips

Sadly, I didn&#39;t enjoy the dessert because I&#39;m not a fan of chocolate, but if you are a normal person that does, the meal will be absolutely perfect.

Pacing was excellent, and ambience was nice for our double date. I only disliked having to go out the back of the restaurant and downstairs to the bathroom."

I realized this when what I wanted to eat was no longer on the menu. The drinks were strong and bold. You get what you pay for. I had the pasta with meat sauce. It was pretty darn good.

I offer Ethan Stowell my wholesome foodie gratitude for this delicious gem he opened right next to The Walrus &amp; The Carpenter.  

While they do serve single entrees, one would usually come here for their tasting menu which, if i heard the waiter right, changes every other day (or at least, quite frequently).  It&#39;s a family-style tasting menu, which means you get a larger variety of dishes if you come with a group of friends.  The pair of us decided to test the waters ourselves before gathering a larger group of friends - and wow, would we go back.

The apps were just amazing.  

Started with a plate of cured meats.. and a bit of background on how much we love Spanish cured meats: we bought a 7lb jamon serrano and ate it with breakfast bennys for several weekends straight.  S&amp;F did not disappoint.  After another cute plate of bread with mozarella &amp; apricot, we also had potato leek soup which was so deliciously creamy and served in the cutest tiny tea cups.  Their beef tartare was also void of horseradish (which I do not like in combination) and tasted great.  The tuna sashimi made me believe that the Italians definitely know their seafood and that plate of fried oysters just took it home for me.  

Surprisingly, the main courses didn&#39;t impress me as much as the apps.  I really liked the pasta (totally cannot recall the specific kind) - because it was a bit hard and chewy - not what I&#39;m used to but something I definitely enjoyed.  The sauce was a bit salty so I would&#39;ve liked that more toned down.  The pork chop - perhaps I was already full lon apps at that point but it was not as tantalizing as the apps.  Our meal ended with the most yogurt-y and satisfying serving of creme brulee i ever had - despite feeling like we were each carrying two food babies. 

Now time to find a group of 5+ friends so I can try everything on the tasting menu.  Heh heh heh."

BF and I got there about 15 min early and we were seated promptly. The server was attentive and friendly.  Atmosphere was nice, restaurant wasn&#39;t too crowded nor too big, intimate setting.

On to food.  For restaurant week, you get 5 small appetizers to share at the table.  
1. meat &amp; cheese plate- 4 slices of meat and a bit of shaved cheese. Meat was good, wish there was more cheese. 3*
2. Salad w/anchovy dressing- Couldn&#39;t taste the anchovies at all, seemed liked a regular Cesar. 3*
3. Beef tartare - 2 pieces of crostini, enough beef to smear on both. Good with toast, tender and small bits. 4*
4. Seared albacore w/fennel, lemon- 2 bite sized pieces, nice sear, didn&#39;t smell or taste of butane. 4*
5. Fried rice ball w/cheese - this was weird. Crust was thick and hard, not sure the cheese went with the rice. 2*

Entrees:
1.Coulette steak- you get two slices, seemed like less than a 4oz portion (don&#39;t go expecting a large portion). Good sear/crust on the steak, cooked medium rare. Also included a couple of fingerling potatoes and mushrooms. Good flavor on this dish. 4*
2. Rigitonni - pasta was undercooked. I made this at home last week and BF said our home cooked version was better. Note: I do not consider myself a good cook so I expect paid food to taste better than what I can make myself. 2*

Dessert:
1. Panna cotta - tasted like fall spices, custard was thick and felt heavy compared to a panna cotta at say Barking Frog. Still tasted pretty good. 4*
2. Mint brownie - not my favorite. You could smell the mint but wasn&#39;t a gooey brownie, more of the hard crusty type. 2*

Overall, with 2 orders for restaurant week ($32/person) plus one beer, it came out to close to $100. Note, Stowell restaurants automatically add a 20% service fee.  I get why restaurants are doing this but I&#39;m not a fan of adding a service charge, just build it into the price of the food and say there&#39;s no tipping. Then people know what they&#39;re paying for when evaluating restaurants.  What sucks is that you&#39;re taxed on the service fee so you end up paying slightly more than 20%.  Neither BF or I thought this meal was worth $100. The food was mostly good but pretty standard, and nothing super creative that blew our minds. We went to Barking Frog for the last restaurant week and that was great (worth the money + wine pairing).  We probably won&#39;t be returning to this restaurant since it was just OK and there are many other good restaurants to try."

I came ready to eat and ready to be impressed, so I ordered the chef&#39;s tasting with a friend. We were brought a dozen or so items - most things were pretty good, many things were disappointing. 

* Proscuitto - 3.5 stars: Standard, good. But so tiny. 
* Cauliflower soup - 3.5 stars: Standard, but good. 
* Steak tartare - 2.5 stars: Roughly cut tartare, but it was so unsettling to chew such large pieces of raw meat and I wasn&#39;t a fan of the sauce.
* Fried oysters - 2.5 stars: Again, the texture was a bit off-putting. 
* Salad - 2 stars: A few pieces of poorly dressed lettuce, how disappointing.
* Seared tuna - 3 stars: 2 tiny pieces of seared tuna.
* Pasta - 3.5 stars: pretty delicious
* Meat course - 4 stars: I loved the salt flakes on top.
* Chocolate dessert - 4 stars: For the choco-holics.

We were torn back and forth on the price fixed menu and based on the other plates we saw the sample plates looked quite incredible. We in turn decided to order our own meals and split an appetizer. We ordered the buffalo mozzarella as an app, the grilled whole branzino, the short rib, and brussel sprouts. 

Each was better then the next, the food experience was absolutely incredible. This place is a must visit if in the area and want to experience great kitchen and dining experience. I would give it 5 stars but our waiter was a bit busy, which is understandable because of how busy the restaurant was.

Their tasting menu is absolutely wonderful. It&#39;s definitely on the pricier side, but well worth it. I would recommend going with more people because you get more variety. I went with four people and got about 6 or 7 appetizers, 2 large entrees--a pasta and a meat (I think if we had one more person in our group, we would have gotten a fish dish), and basically all the desserts they have. SO worth it. The tasting menu changes a bunch--every time I&#39;ve gone they&#39;ve had different dishes for the various courses. Everything is always super fresh, super flavorful, super delicious.

I would also definitely recommend going for Seattle Restaurant Week (SRW). Is like a miniature version of the tasting menu. You get like 5 appetizers (you don&#39;t have to choose!), but only get to select one entree and one dessert per person. Not too shabby at all. While I find some other SRW restaurants not worth it, this one most definitely is.

Service is on point here.

They have a chef&#39;s tasting menu, family style. It is worth the price for this four course meal, with about 5-7 plates of small appetizers, then a pasta course, main meat course, and dessert. 

To name a few appetizers, we had speck, fried oysters, beef tartare, homemade ricotta with honey and pickled mustard seeds. These change from time to time. One of my favorites is the fried oysters, they tasted really fresh. 

The pasta course we had gnocchi with clams-- so good I wanted more. 
The meat course we had a grilled pork tenderloin, oh my it was tender, juicy and so soft. 

The dessert was a passion fruit panna cotta with candied pistachios and pineapples-- one of the best panna cottas I&#39;ve ever had paired with the candied condiments, really made this dessert shine. 

Service is excellent here, very attentive. The inside decor was very modern casual, with an open kitchen.

We noticed we were in the wrong place but decided to stay after seeing the crowd at the other place. 

The place looks very nice. We were there on a warm sunny day and the front patio doors were open. We sat outside  and had a drink, then since we didn&#39;t have a dinner reservation, we had our meal at the bar. 

We shared the smoked fish bruschetta. It was salmon that day, and a bit salty. For my main course, I had the king salmon. The sauce was good, but the fish was dry and did not have much taste. My wife had the pasta bolognes which was good, but also a bit too salty.

The staff was friendly, and I would give them another try next time we are in town."

It starts off with a flurry of different appetizers which got me excited about the evening but then decelerates towards the main course and the dessert arrived sooner than expected. Not everything was to my taste (cold split pea soup?) but I wouldn&#39;t ding the place for it because we chose the surprise option and knew what we were getting ourselves into. One of the main courses was gnocchi which was oddly presented as a pasta dish. 

[Update:] I took my entire family here a few weeks after my first visit and the tasting menu was almost identical to the first time I went - and that after the staff assured me over the phone beforehand that the menu sometimes even changes during the course of an evening. While the food was again decent and the main courses arguably a bit better than the first time around (slightly different pasta dish), I found this disappointing and deducted one more star."

I can&#39;t say enough great things about this place.

It is connected to The Walrus and the Carpenter in an a remodeled old marine supply building. We loved the interior from the wood floors to the brick walls. The lights are dimmed down and the tables either have a light bulb or candle to really set the romantic setting. It really is a fun vibe where you can appreciate great food in a unique restaurant.

This is a smaller sized restaurant that does take reservations. If you have a little time in advance, I would recommend making a reservation as people will have dinner for a couple hours. This is in the Ballard neighborhood, so there is plenty of street parking on the main road just behind the building.

The restaurant has a great wine list to choose from. Several good options for glass pours and an extensive list for bottle options. The waiter was very good at providing wine suggestions for food pairings, or in our case, made a great suggestion for a bottle that would work well with all the food. We ended up getting a bottle of a red Italian wine (2012 Nottola).

The menu is an a la carte style. They encourage you to go the &#34;fancy&#34; route, and put your dinner in the hands of the chefs. This is the route we decided to go after reading the yelp reviews, and did not disappoint. It is $55 per person and everyone at the table must participate due to it being &#34;family style&#34; and meant to share. The meal included 7 appetizers, one pasta dish, one protein dish, and one dessert dish. The waiter mentioned in the beginning that it is unlikely you will get anything that is on the regular menu. We also noticed that the tables near us had ordered the &#34;fancy&#34; as well, and were getting different dishes. A great place if you are looking for something different every time!

The service was impeccable. Our waiter was very helpful, had great recommendations, attentive, and friendly. Plates were cleared from the table just as they were finished, water was always full, and they kept our wine glasses poured. The table was cleaned in between courses quickly and efficiently.  At no point did we feel rushed and were able to thoroughly enjoy all 4 courses. 

There wasn&#39;t a single thing that was brought out that wasn&#39;t delicious. If you are like me and enjoy trying different types of foods, this is the place for you. You get a little bit of everything and the food is very unique with high quality ingredients.

Highly recommend and we will be back!"

We sat at the bar which was a great decision (for the most part). Our bartender was the man. Not only served up great cocktails and was a blast to chat it up with but he led us through the tasting menu which was very well put together. He helped us pair drinks with each course and was spot on all around.

Only 2 drawbacks and both minor, 1) bar stools are not very comfortable. 2) pork was a little overdone for my taste, but I tend to like everything on the rare side.

Will certainly be back."

The wife and I found this place on yelp - and we decided to try it out. We didn&#39;t have a reservation and the wait would be about 45 minutes for a table. We decided to sit at the bar which was full service.

When we sat the bar - we were greeted immediately by the bartender who was friendly and well versed on all the menu items and drinks. We decided to go &#34;fancy&#34; which opened up the door to the kitchen to prepare their 4 course meal of small bites and leading up their amazing pork entree. They were able to prepare my wives meal specifically for her dietary restrictions which was amazing accommodation. 

Glad we sat the bar - as it was quick service, but not rushed. The food was amazing and the service was spectacular. Definitely recommend this place for either a nice dinner date out, or even for a special occasion."

With no special request from me, with each appetizer I was unable to eat, they made and brought a special dish safe for me! I particularly loved the Arancini and my entree was divine: butternut squash and ricotta ravioli in a sage brown butter sauce. Dessert was a delicious mint brownie paired with a perfect cappuccino. I tasted the two other desserts (Panna Cotta and Grape and Rosemary sorbet), both were fantastic. Friends that went with me were raving about their Scallop entree.  and their mixed drinks. The waitress helped choose a perfect wine. Service was perfectly timed and not rushed, waitress was friendly and helpful without interfering. My new favorite restaurant!!!"

Its really not his thing, though.), on recommendation from another Yelp Elite member who said it was one of the best options for Restaurant Week. This place is POPULAR. By the time I found out it was restaurant week, the only available times were 9:30PM for reservations!

That being said, the hostess was lively and bubbly. I really wished she was our server. The servers were knowledgeable, but there was something cold about them..I&#39;m not sure if it was the awareness we would be paying under $100 due to only wanting the Restaurant Week, or what, but they were definitely strange towards us. On the bright side, I enjoyed listening to them introduce each plate with a sense of pride, and wiping our table between courses. I also liked the fact that we could have chosen to dress up or be casual. If this restaurant were in Miami, I&#39;d need to bring my stilettos and micro-dress out!

What I enjoyed most about this restaurant was that it offered 4 dishes for appetizers, which is what earned this place its 4th star. I&#39;ve never gone to a restaurant during Restaurant Week where that&#39;s been done before, and I am aware that each appetizer is actually worth $12-16 each, so I&#39;m aware I got bang for my buck!

I&#39;m just going to state right now I don&#39;t get what&#39;s with the fawning over the Proscuitto Di Parma &amp; Parmesan. Perhaps I&#39;m not refined enough, but your local deli offers equally delicious prosciutto for less... 

What we recommend from our dinner experience:

Appetizers: 
Swiss Chard Arancini House Made Mozzarella, Basil: You can&#39;t go wrong with a fried ball filled with  risotto and mozzarella, that&#39;s served on homemade marinara sauce. You just can&#39;t.
It was our favorite appetizer.

Foie Gras Mousse Crostini, Aged Balsamic: This is like bruschetta for classy people. The aged balsamic spread had a flavor was interesting, and hard to describe. It was buttery with a slight tang.

Albacore Crudo Baby Fennel, Taggiasca Olive, Orange: Seared albacore (think ahi tuna) was paired well with olives, orange pieces and fennel. However, I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to describe this as something you could only get or experience at this restaurant.

Main Course:
Grilled Salmon, Cauliflower, Caper, Lemon:
My boyfriend said &#34;It was good. I&#39;ve made better&#34; (he has)

Cullote Steak Celery Root, Maitake Mushrooms: My boyfriend and I compete for the &#34;best order&#34; as our entrees are served. Usually, he wins. Not this time! I won and this was the best dish of the night. My medium rare stake was truly something to be envied by all who witnessed it. Not only would a BBQ Master have bowed down to it&#39;s glory, but  would have also asked the chef for tips. Everything about this dish was worth 5-stars alone. The maitake mushrooms were crispy, and I could have sworn I caught a hint of sweet potato pieces. All around delicious.



Dessert: 
Dark Chocolate Molten Cake with Almond Cream: The chocolate is rich and has the texture of fudge. My boyfriend isn&#39;t into overly sweet dishes, but said that the almond and cream balanced everything very well.

Seasonal Sorbetto &amp; Shortbread - Raspberry flavored, rich and VERY creamy. One of the best sorbets I&#39;ve ever had. No exaggeration. 


Final thoughts: I can ONLY recommend this restaurant for Restaurant Week, just to try.  

I think good food is not uncommon and only featured at expensive restaurants, and that an expensive dish doesn&#39;t always mean it will be a delicious or interesting one. For a place that is so highly regarded, I would say you could do just as well as Outback Steakhouse, to be honest."
staple-and-fancy-mercantile-seattle,Brittany L.,5ePQIWiLkoZF3hG0ZFb9GA,"Seattle, WA",1,1,1,342,17,rPlVfb-islZfaOK5sJGn4Q,5.0,2015-05-02,"It&#39;s been over a week and I still cannot stop thinking about the meal I had here that I claimed to be one of the greatest meals I&#39;ve ever had. I still stand by this claim! We came for Seattle Restaurant Week because the appetizers for the table just sounded too good. We were promptly seated for our 9:30 reservation and immediately introduced to our waiter. He was cool and helpful when suggesting beers to our table full of inexperienced college students. 

We started with the proscuitto di parma which was great! I love proscuitto and I don&#39;t think anyone can go wrong there. We had a party of four people and the plate had enough proscuitto for 2-3 slices for each of us. Then came the seared albacore. It was light, summery, and flavorful! It was especially nice following the salty proscuitto. Next was the foie gras mousse. This was my favorite part of the meal, and one of the best things I&#39;ve ever tasted! I&#39;m really into pate but this was on a whole different level. It was fluffy, buttery, and just perfect! I tried to save it because I wanted to end with that bite, but couldn&#39;t resist and ended up finishing it before the end. Seriously to die for. 

Then we came to a pause in the appetizers. Here is where there&#39;s a disconnect in communication because we had different servers bringing us different appetizers, none of them really knew what we&#39;ve had and what we were still waiting on. We had to remind them that we were still missing two appetizers and then they brought them out. If we hadn&#39;t mentioned it to them I don&#39;t think they would have brought us our last two. I read in a previous review that someone tried &#34;all four appetizers&#34; but there were five! I&#39;m sorry to whomever missed out :(

So we continued with the arancini and gem lettuce. The arancini was like a fried risotto ball in tomato sauce, yummy! The gem lettuce was nice to finish off the appetizers. I liked that there was a subtle anchovy flavor in the dressing, different but delicious!

I ordered the swordfish for my entree and it was very yummy! A little bit on the salty side but the fish was cooked perfectly and I loved the assortment of vegetables under it. My friends ordered the rigatoni and the ravioli. Both of which were cooked al dente and super tasty!

For dessert I ordered the sorrel panna cotta. I loooove strawberry and rhubarb and they came together beautifully in this light, creamy dessert! My friends ordered the chocolate terrine and LOVED it. I&#39;m not a big chocolate fan but if you are, this is the dessert for you! We also had the grapefruit sorbetto which was also a nice and refreshing end to dinner. Surprisingly, we were all pleasantly full after dinner. The portion sizes are perfect! They definitely don&#39;t skimp out on food and don&#39;t load up the plate so that you hate yourself after. I actually think I love myself more now for deciding on this place. Thanks, Brittany.

After every restaurant week I think, &#34;wow, how are we going to top that?&#34; and I honestly don&#39;t know anymore. I&#39;ll probably end up coming here for every restaurant week from here on out. It was that good."

The food was diverse, flavorful, and surprising. I really do recommend going with the chef&#39;s &#34;fancy&#34; menu. It&#39;s a multi-course mix of dishes that the chef selects and delivers specifically for your table. You&#39;re able to give guidance on preference/dislikes, then sit back and enjoy. It was a lot of fun; small dishes kept arriving. 

I am giving a 4 star rating because we brought a special bottle of wine and the server, who was slightly unfriendly, took it in the back to open it. I would have preferred the table side presentation and decanting, especially considering the how reputable the wine was that we brought.

I highly recommend dinner here, or they have a great bar-top on the front patio that faces the street. It looked like a nice spot for a drink and some apps."

I&#39;ve never been huge on small plates-style dining, because a) I&#39;m bad at sharing and b) if I like something, I generally want to eat a whole freaking pound of it. Despite my hangups, the chef&#39;s menu at S&amp;F has me converted. Just when I finished a plate and started to be sad that I couldn&#39;t have more of it, they would bring another delicious thing and I would forget all my woes. They do this format of dining exactly as it should be, with plate after plate of tasty bites that work well together but are different enough that each new course is a wonderful surprise. It&#39;s an especially great meal to share with just one other person, as sharing is easier and the pacing of the meal is really conducive to conversation. We counted 7 appetizer courses, 1 pasta dish, 1 entree, and a dessert. At the end, you are pleasantly full but you don&#39;t feel like you need to be rolled back to your car. The service is excellent and they pace the timing of the dishes very well, the wine list has something for everyone, and honestly it was just the perfect meal. This is going to be my go-to special occasions spot from now on. Obviously doing the chef&#39;s menu is a pricey meal (especially if you add a glass of wine to it, as we did), so for me this is a once or twice a year kind of place. But if you have something big to celebrate, an occasion to observe, or you just want to treat yoself, I can&#39;t recommend Staple and Fancy enough.

So there&#39;s my review--if you don&#39;t want the details of what we ate then go ahead and stop reading now! But I know some of you yelpers like to eat vicariously through other people&#39;s reviews, so here we go...
-Smoked prosciutto plate: drizzled with olive oil, savory, smokey, and delicious. Great first plate.
-Crostini with ricotto cheese and greens with meyer lemon: Creamy goodness with refreshing acidity from the lemon.
-Potato and leek soup with chive oil: Creamy yet light, really nice.
-Gem lettuce salad with green goddess dressing: You will have to cut the leaves unless you want dressing all over your face, but it was nice and crisp and I was glad for the vegetables.
-Seared albacore with avocado puree: The fish itself could have been a bit more flavorful, but albacore is usually pretty mild so that is to be expected. The avocado puree was tasty and definitely necessary. 
-Steak tartare: Really freakin good. From what I&#39;ve heard this is a regular on the chef&#39;s menu, which is entirely warranted. This stuff is bomb.
-Semolina fried oysters with spicy aioli: Nicely fried and juicy on the inside. Aioli was hot but not too hot.
-Bucatini with meat sauce: Really really good. Perfectly cooked pasta, hearty sauce, yes yes yes.
-Grilled pork loin with roasted fingerling potatoes, turnips, nettle puree, and black olive oil: The meat was juicy and flavorful but honestly the real star here is the potato. Yum. 
-Ricotta cheesecake with winter fruit compote: I love me some ricotta cheesecake. Smoother and lighter than regular cheesecake, it&#39;s a nice finish to a meal that doesn&#39;t leave you feeling like you ate a brick."

In terms of the food, I would say the food was great overall. The baby beets salad was a nice and refreshing salad. Also, I would recommend the beef short rib; it was very juicy, tender, and nicely packed with flavor. The grilled fish was also nicely paired with saltiness and tanginess of the capers.

I made a reservation to celebrate my mom&#39;s birthday for 5 people. The hostess told me for 6 or more people I would have to customize our menu. I thought this was weird because it was not as though we were a large group of 10. I ended up calling to add one more person, expecting to have to customize our menu, but low and behold the hostess tells me that for 6 or more people each person HAS to order the tasting menu which is $55 per person.... She tells me that she will check with the manager to see if they can make an exception because we are not a big party. Then tells me that he said no. The fact that a restaurant expects a party of 6 people to order $55 plates is beyond ridiculous. This is a whole in the wall place, not a 5 star restaurant. I ask why this is their policy and she says because parties of 5 or more take up more than one table. I asked what the difference was with two parties of 3 people sitting right next to each other, saying I understood if our party was 10-13 people etc., but 6??? That is the average family size!!! Needless to say we cancelled and I am never going back, they lost business over something so petty. They just want to take advantage of medium parties and make them spend a lot of money. Newsflash it&#39;s a party of 6 already, the bill is going to be high.

We were greeted and seated promptly, granted that it was a 9pm reservation, but it was still quite busy and bustling with patrons and conversation. 

We were treated to a spread of five different appetizers from the menu that were shared family style, all delicious.  I think I was most intrigued by the chicken liver mousse, which I haven&#39;t had for a long time and only at a different establishment.  Their rendition was delicious, but less variety in the flavor.  The salad was a little too cheesy or creamy for my taste. 

Our entrees were the steak, scallops, and the lamb ragu.  The steak was cooked to about medium rare, maybe a bit more rare, but quite tender and juicy. The lamb ragu was was a delicious filling choice.  However, the scallops were a bit too buttery, and the sauce was on the watery side.  This unfortunately made the searing of the scallops a bit soggy, and left a lot to desire. 

We chose the seasonal sorbet, which was pink lemonade, and the amaretto cake for dessert.  The sorbet was a great palate cleanser, and I loved the tart lightness of it.  They were generous with their portions, two scoops and a shortbread cookie.  The amaretto cake, however, was a bit of a disappointment.  The marshmallow on top was toasted to the point where it wasn&#39;t soft anymore, and the cake was a bit dried out on the outside, though inside was still okay.

Our first course was sliced mozzarella  with balsamic vinaigrette, followed by some sliced prosciutto, followed by some lettuce with shaved parmesan.  Not one of these dishes is something I would ever order because each of them can be made at home with no special gusto or creativity.   And they weren&#39;t especially yummy either.  The next dish was a squid ink pasta that was very good and cooked perfectly.  But the entree, which we were told was to be pork cheeks, was instead pork loin, the least interesting cut of pork.  It was boring and insipid.  Followed by a run of the mill chocolate  ganache.  Overall, a night of bad food with good service, Nice wine, and good atmosphere.  But we won&#39;t be coming back."

Everything was quite delicious and well prepared.

I probably wouldn&#39;t order anything else. Every dish that came as part of this (as well as everything on the menu as far as I can tell) are pretty simple and something you can make at home relatively easily. What you would not do (probably) is make all of them for one meal unless you have lots of helpers.

You will probably not be wowed by any single item (I certainly was not), but the whole experience is quite worthwhile, especially at it&#39;s moderate price.

Service is very good except that they pace the tasting menu very quickly compared to other places making it easy to get full before the whole experience is over."

The portion size was perfect. I really enjoyed the parsnip soup. I could of had a whole bowl of it. The pasta was so unique and cooked to perfection. I would have never ordered that on my own and now I think I will be more adventurous given the chance. Overall, the pacing and service was great. We never felt rushed or we were being pushed out for the next table. It felt really nice and unexpected. I definitely will try to come back next time I visit Seattle."

We live nearby in Ballard and we even able to find parking when we went there on a Wed. night. I ordered a glass of champagne which was delicious and my server conveniently over-poured my glass. My husband ordered a whiskey drink which was also quite tasty. We decided to do the family style option for 55 dollars per person and so delicious! I asked for limited seafood as I am not a fan but my husband really enjoys it. First up was some prosciutto, then a squash soup, fresh mozzarella with apples and shaved celery with some delicious dressing, fried oysters with dipping sauce, butternut squash salad, bowl of olives, a slice of tuna with something fancy on it (my husband had it in his mouth before I could even get a peek), Steak tartare with nicely toasted crostini, spaghetti pasta with delicious ricotta meatballs, then came a pork roast which was just perfectly cooked, with some greens and grilled onions, and finally a ricotta cheesecake with a fig topping that just hit the spot. It was an expensive dinner but with all of those choices and tastings it was well worth it. The servers were very pleasant, i like the old hardwood floors and wide booth, romantic setting with the lighting, but also fun to see what was happening in the kitchen and at the bar. There is an automatic 20 percent gratuity added to the meal which is also taxed so that does equal a large portion of the check, a little different than most places but either way were were satisfied. Dinner took long as gave us time to chat on our date which was lovely. It was not packed either so we could hear one another speaking across the table. I highly recommend!!!! I hope to be able to go again sometime!"

Being Vegan isn&#39;t difficult, but being vegan with a carnivore partner and both of having culinary backgrounds-dining out is often disappointing. 

We have been left speechless!

The food. The service. The plating. The food. Did I mention the food? The service. The atmosphere. All just absolutely PERFECT.

My only complaint is that it is quite a task getting to the bathroom in heels-but this really is no fault of the establishment.

Their appetizers and cocktails were great and dessert. Overall I found their service so so and I ordered the ravioli with fiddleheads and it was super salty and not tasty at all.I&#39;m surprised this passed their quality bar as the entree was barely edible. Was a friends birthday so I didn&#39;t want to make a scene but I would have sent the dish back otherwise. Also it would be great to not be served dinner while we are still finishing up the appetizers. Not great sequence of timing. 

Truly bummed this was my experience since I was hoping for so much more. Not sure I&#39;ll go back. More hype than substance."

Went for our 11th wedding anniversary and was not disappointed.  Decided to go with Chef&#39;s Table.   I have a few food allergies so was a bit concerned that we would not get the best of the best, but I was entirely wrong.  We received several appetizers and sides, some that were not on the menu.  I think we got a total of eight or nine small plates to share.  We also got a very generous bowl of gnocchi with spring peas, and a lovely slice of pork tenderloin.  The meal was followed with two desserts, a lovely sorrel panna cotta and a mescolato grape and rosemary sorbet.  I started with a beer and switched to a server&#39;s choice glass of wine (which turned into two).  

Our service was perfect, not too quick, but not leaving us wondering where the staff went either.  Our main server, Phoebe was well versed in timing, presentation, and suggestion.  We applaud her.  

The dining room was full, but felt intimate.  We could have conversation without yelling and without our neighbors hearing what we were discussing.  

Pricing was reasonable for what we received, and W e hope to return in the near future."

Unfortunately this is where they lost a star for me, they had booked out the entire restaurant to reservations only. It was the start of restaurant week but I don&#39;t agree with that move, there should always be room for walk ins. With that, there are 8 countertop spaces so we had perfectly timed sliding into a spot. Good thing we were only a party of 2 or wouldn&#39;t have been able to experience the mouthwatering pasta. The bartender started is off by reviewing the normal and RW menu for us, seemed very knowledgeable and gave wonderful suggestions. 

I ordered the duck ragu. I could&#39;ve licked the bowl clean. The duck pulled apart so smoothly and melted instantaneously in my mouth. Hands down one of the best pasta dishes I&#39;ve had in a long time. Al dente noodles, perfectly sauced, and with a dash of red pepper flakes it was a comfortable pasta I want over and over. Too bad I don&#39;t live in Seattle. I&#39;m mad at myself for being too full and not finishing. Don&#39;t think it would&#39;ve flown home well the next morning. 

My friend on the other hand got the second best pasta of the night, traditional spaghetti and meatballs. Had to beg to let me experience the heartiness of the meatball and thick sauce of hers. Worth the begging ;-) 

Both dishes were well priced, about $18 each. If we hadn&#39;t had apps and drinks around the corner would have loved to order more food. I definitely recommend this restaurant. Would be happy to dine again!"

I hate to start out by saying that I particularly was not totally taken with this place.  While it is a cool place visually the service, in point our server, was not that great nor was my meal.  

The server had some kind of attitude that was not appealing at all, very cold and not friendly, In fact, my husband remembered him from the last time he was there.  Same reception or lack there of...  He took our order after delivering our drinks.  We did not order any starters as we anticipated just being able to only have enough room for our entrees. The server was taken by the fact we did not want any starters and  abruptly pointed out to us what we ordered would take up to 20 minutes or so.  We told him were fine with that...and what a  weird look he gave us...??? Some people are not big eaters like others.

Then we did get a bit hungry while waiting so I stopped another server, as our server never checked on us after giving him our order even though he pasted our table a few times without look our direction, we ordered some bread. She made it clear to us that they charged extra for that, as if we looked like homeless people off the streets, not quite.  

My husband got his pork chop entree and I the whole fish.  Very underwhelming!  The pork chop was just fine but not great and my whole fish was under seasoned and  soggy, literally. Not just moist but soggy. 

You ask why did we even go if my husbands last time there was not that good either because he wanted me to judge it for myself without his pre determined opinion.

After all of that we ate and ran.  I won&#39;t be going back but do love a few of the other places that are affiliated with Stable and Fancy/ESR like How to Cook a Wolf, Tavolata and Ballard Pizza.

This is just my opinion and experience."

It was very cool to be able to watch the kitchen staff work their magic and push out all the small and big plates. However, after a while, it got SO warm. I think next time, I might request a table by the wall or window. But the space is very cozy and intimate - great for date night or girls&#39; night.

We opted for the tasting menu, which is a phenomenal deal at $50. Having splurged on many tasting menus for various milestone celebrations in NYC and DC, I would say this meal ranked as one of our favorites in taste and definitely in value. We were served porchetta with parmesan shavings, fried oysters, beef tartare, buffalo mozzarella, parsnip soup, baby lettuce with vinaigrette, pasta with olive oil and garlic, grilled NY strip and a slice of cheesecake. See what I mean? Amazing amount of food for that price point!

The standouts were the fried oysters, beef tartare, parsnip soup and the fresh pasta. We still can&#39;t stop talking about those fried oysters - so crispy and delicious. We did enjoy all the other dishes, although the steak was a bit on the grisly side. We had trouble cutting through it to share. The cheesecake was also nothing too special, but by the end of the meal, we were way too full to care.

The service was mostly good. We were served various dishes by all different wait staff, and they were always pleasant. Our waiter was courteous but not especially warm throughout the meal as he poured our wine or asked after our meal. When we got the cheesecake, we asked the server for espresso and decaf Americano. Our waiter came by and confirmed out coffee orders, but then he proceeded to serve other tables and perhaps forgot about our coffee (I could see the service station, and he made no move to go near it). Finally, after five minutes, another server came by and asked if we were waiting for something or if we were taking a break - SHE had noticed we had made no move to taste our dessert. Then she ended up making our coffees and rushing them over to us, thanking us for our patience.

We were given homemade lasagna noodles with our check, which was a nice touch."

We then had two pasta dishes; the Ravioli and another delicious dish with bolognaise. 

I had the best pork chop of my life here. I almost didn&#39;t even try the salmon after because it was just so tasty! But I did try the salmon, and enjoyed it. Pork chop still the best. 

Dessert was also delicious and very creative. We will definitely be back!!"

This was the second restaurant I&#39;ve tried in participation of Seattle Restaurant Week and it didn&#39;t disappoint! (3 course meal for $30)

Staple &amp; Fancy doesn&#39;t seem to have accessible wifi or LTE service, which might be terrifying to all the Snapchat and Instagram food fiends out there. What kind of 4-star restaurant doesn&#39;t have free wifi? Probably ones that want to promote a chatty and intimate atmosphere. With that being said, there is a lot of music and talking, so it can get pretty loud (up to the point where you&#39;re almost yelling to be heard by the waiters). Aside from that, the atmosphere is very quaint and minimalistic. 

My group of friends and I reserved a table at 9:30pm and were promptly seated upon arrival. The waiters were all chill and handed us a menu stapled on wood plank. The best thing about getting appetizers here during restaurant week is that they make enough for the whole table! We got 5 appetizers, ordered an entree and a dessert. 

The appetizers included Prosciutto di Parma and Pecorino, Albacore Crudo, Arancini with house-made mozzarella, Anchovy Salad and Foie Gras Mousse on Crostini. All of them came out with great portions for our group of four. The best options were the Arancini and foie gras appetizers. I didn&#39;t know that risotto could be beautifully fried, but this place did it! And the foie gras mousse was so buttery and smooth. I&#39;ve had so many drooling daydreams over these appetizers.

For the entree, I opted for the rigatoni pasta with pork shoulder and maitake mushrooms. Super filling and flavorful. Sharing is caring, so I got to try the creamy ravioli with peas and mint, as well as the grilled swordfish. Very wow, much taste, I like it. 

As for dessert, I also got to try all three options. Both the grapefruit sorbet and strawberry rhubarb pan a cotta were refreshing and tart. For myself, I ordered the chocolate terrine with smoked caramel, salted caramel gelato with hazelnut notes. THIS WAS TO DIE FOR. I experienced a chocolate death and woke up in chocolate heaven with every bite. Overall it was very rich and decadent, salty and sweet, crunchy and smooth. Your tastebuds will thank you for experiencing this dessert. 

I&#39;m giving this restaurant a 4 out of 5 stars for no accessible service and horror movie bathroom route. But overall, a great experience with delicious food and personable service!"

It&#39;s not a big space by any means but the tables are spread out enough to not feel like you&#39;re on top of other tables. The light bulb candles on some tables at the bar were a neat touch.

I would definitely come back and visit again to try something new. This restaurant is a great time!

They have a regular menu that you can order off of and then also a tasting menu, like a chef&#39;s choice kinda thing for $50/person. I did the latter, so my review will be of that. It&#39;s hard too because the tasting menu changes, so I won&#39;t get into all the specifics of each item.

Appetizers: smoked cod crostini (really good), prosciutto, salad, soup, some raw fish (really good), fried oysters (5 pieces!! that&#39;s a lot for tasting). I liked that I got a little bit of everything to try. The appetizers were probably my favorite part of the meal. 

Second/Third course: Gnocchi w/ mushrooms. It was just ok, not amazing. I only ate like 4 pieces because I was kinda full slash I just don&#39;t eat a ton. We also got a salmon, which was pretty good. 

Dessert: This chocolate mousse cake w/ chocolate gelato on the side. I love chocolate! and I haven&#39;t had chocolate icecream in foreverrr. So this was yummy. 

This was my first time doing a tasting menu anywhere, its like omakase in a sushi restaurants! I wouldn&#39;t say this was crazy amazing, but it was a good experience and they had some good items. Price isn&#39;t too bad."

1. The surprise/trust the chef tasting menu was a delightful surprise.  The accommodated our allergy restrictions (shellfish) and preferences (hate mushrooms!) to pull together a fantastic meal - ranging from a series of interesting and tasty apps including steak tartare- the best I&#39;ve had, watermelon/heirloom tomato and fried basil salad, homemade mozarella and tomato.  The pork cheek tagliatelle was an off menu treat- very tender meat and fresh pasta followed by some of the best wagyu beef I&#39;ve tasted.  Finally we wrapped up with a homemade chocolate gelato and chocolate tartine- I&#39;d sum up the meal with one word- YUM!
2. The service was phenomenal- our waiter answered countless questions with ease. 

The bad/ugly:
1. Transportation/location- I&#39;d recommending driving or plan ahead for a cab.  We saw several diners waiting for 20-30 minutes to flag a cab in the relatively desolate industrial neighborhood.

The Verdict: Trust the chef and take the tasting menu plunge.  It&#39;s worth the risk for a memorable meal."

We arrived slightly after our reservations and were promptly seated. 
We did the &#34;Fancy&#34; menu and had a very small dietary restriction of no cheese. 
They accommodated accordingly. We got grated parmesan on our salad and on the side for my boyfriend for our pasta. 

We had 6-7 different little appetizers. 
Salad, seared fish, olives, fried oysters, chive soup, and more. 

Our two entrees where a meat dish and a pasts dish then we had a dessert to share. 

Each dish came out with a different server and a short synopsis of what the dish was and what was in it. 

The staff was very attentive and the open kitchen accommodating. 
 
We tipped very well because it was truly the best dining experience for the both of us.

As other&#39;s have said, definitely do the recommended tasting menu, even if you&#39;re a big eater (like we are) you still end up being very full and happy! They were also really accommodating about my dietary restrictions :) 

The steak tartare was by far my favorite dish. They also have a red wine that is only $5/glass and pretty decent :)."

I have heard good things about the tasting menu and it definitely did not disappoint! There were 7 appetizers for the first course, one pasta dish to share, one entree to share, and one dessert to share. I was expecting all tables in the restaurant to get the same dishes if  participating in the tasting menu, but it looked like the table next to us received different dishes for their tasting menu which I think is great. I don&#39;t remember what our server&#39;s name was, but he was absolutely fantastic as well. He took note of my boyfriend&#39;s birthday and gave us complimentary drinks, and on top of that he took off a beer on our check. This place is great and I would definitely come back!"

My husband and I ate here for his birthday and they didn&#39;t disappoint.  The service and the food here were great and exceeded our expectations. When we got there we ordered the tasting menu &#34;Do it Fancy&#34; as well as inquired about the Gavi de Gavi that was listed on their website but not on their wine menu. Our waiter recommended two whites that were similar and we chose a Southern Italian White which came really close- great recommendation.

Honestly, the reviewer who complained about the family style servings not being sufficient is ridiculous and has one heck of an appetite because it was more than enough food. When the pasta dish came it was a butternut squash ravioli and the waiter stopped by asking about it, I told him I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of it and he then proceeded to offer a replacement- when I told him it was ok because I was starting to get full he insisted that I reconsider (and that they would bring something else out) - I stood my ground (was getting full and wanted to save space for dessert) but this was a first and its obvious that they aim to please.

BTW the chocolate dessert is out of this word- it is chocolate upon chocolate upon chocolate with some caramel- if you are a chocolate lover then this will not disappoint!

Would come here again!"

Party of four, reservations and seated promptly.  The hostess did not have the greatest attitude but more indifferent was the outfit; leggings are not pants especially in a food environment as well as a sloppy hair job.  

Waiter greets us in common manner and offers explanation of the menu that it intended to be ordered family style; however is not the only way to dine.  

We order drinks and wine: english bulldog was solid but pulpy, the barbaresco was fantastic.  

Appetizers of buffalo mozzarella and olives: well done 5 stars.

Order four main dishes for each guest, and followed by &#34;would you like me to course these out for you?&#34;  my response &#34;no, all at once please, we are not sharing&#34;

First dish hits the table Gnocchi in a Pesto Sauce.  The gnocchi were fresh and fabulous, however they sat in about 3/4&#34; of oil with minced basil.  It looked more like a deconstructed pesto which set presentation and flavor off making the dish a 2 star. 

After 6 mins...

Second dish: Ravioli&#39;s : with peas and cheese, solid and tasty but nothing special.

Another 7 mins....

Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs:  Great presentation, fresh pasta.  However, it was spicy, really really spicy...I love spice and could eat this but my Mother cannot, and nor does the menu specify or server clarify. It was rated at a 7 out of 10 on a heat scale. It was so spicy she had to eat from others dishes.  

Another 10 mins...

Final fourth dish arrives....

Porkchop:  This was flawless. I cannot say a single negative comment about this plate.  

The server did say between dish 3 and 4...&#34;Oh, I thought you all were sharing&#34;...

Nope...you asked before ordering, and I told you.  Bummer.

Overall I did not enjoy the experience and had much higher expectations from others reviews and comments.  Time to move on to the other endless options around town."

We were with a friend of Ethan&#39;s, and we got basically a 15 course dinner. Pretty epic and very memorable. All the meat pasta seafood and veggies were great.

We wanted to try their &#34;fancy&#34; menu where the chef cooks for you and his creativity come out. A very good value at $50.00 per person.
Staple and Fancy did not disappoint as most of the dishes served were well prepared, flavorful and ample portions. The first of four courses is actually a series of small plates (I counted 8!) that are varied and a great introduction to the kitchen. I can&#39;t remember all of them but included a tasty crudo, beef tartar, fried oysters with remoulade, mozzarella with figs, porchetta with shaved parm, butter lettuce salad and a couple I can&#39;t remember. All were very good to excellent.

Course two was pasta, tagliarini bolognese, marscapone and mint. This was a very large serving, wife thought the mint was a bit strong, I thought it was perfect. A refreshing take on a classic pasta dish.
Course 3 were seared scallops with a root puree. This was our only disappointment of the evening. The scallops were good but could have used more sear and they were VERY salty.

Last course was a creamy cheesecake with blueberry puree. We are picky about cheesecake and this was a very good one and an excellent end to the evening.
Very nice wine list, we alternated white and red between courses. Service was very friendly and helpful throughout dinner. Lots of good dinner choices in Seattle, Staple and Fancy is one of them"

It was great getting to directly compare the two, and both for restaurant week. 

I really liked the way Staple &amp; Fancy let you try all the appetizers communally. They portioned things really well for our group of four. The Parsnip Soup had a nice flavor and was served just slightly bigger than amuse bouche style. The Porchetta de Testa was too fatty for my taste, but one of our group members really liked it. The Gem Lettuce (with champagne vinaigrette, citrus, and radish) was very refreshing to balance out the heaviness of the other appetizers. I liked the large portion of Beef Tartar and Fried Oysters the most, though it wasn&#39;t the best beef tartar I&#39;d ever had. The oysters were delicious!

I was not as impressed with the entrees as I was at mkt. The ravioli was fine with a nice, clean flavor, but it was nothing special. The braised rabbit rigatoni lacked flavor and I was disappointed with the small size of the rigatoni. The spanish mackerel had a wonderful crust but was fishier than I would have liked. The coulotte steak was my favorite, but nothing sing about. Entrees were served individually, but we all shared them with each other. 

Staple &amp; Fancy offered the exact same desserts that mkt. offered. This time, I tried the pear-anise sorbet first, knowing that the basil panna cotta and chocolate terrine would be too overpowering. The sorbet is not for me, but it had an interesting flavor. The basil panna cotta was certainly  interesting, but again not a dessert I would ordinarily order. The chocolate terrine was delicious. The crumbly crust went perfectly with the smooth chocolate and it was probably the highlight of the night. 

I think I would visit Staple &amp; Fancy apart from restaurant week to see what some of their regular menu offerings are. The idea of &#34;doing it fancy&#34; and letting the chef decide my dinner is also intriguing. To be continued, Staple &amp; Fancy!"

Once seated they thanked us again for our patience and even served us a complimentary dessert wine during our last course. Alas, chivalry is not dead and oh my was this place worth the wait (see pics). We did the tasting menu and our entire group of 6 loved every dish we were served. I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say there is likely not a bad thing on the menu but if you can do the tasting menu it&#39;s served family-style and made for a fun experience.

- Parpadelle - yum.. the braised pork cheek was absolutely delish. pasta cooked perfectly
- Grilled whole trout - bones taken out. stuffed with rosemary and lemon.  woa. flavorful. love it

Anyways, this was a really cute space in Ballard - far enough off the strip so parking isn&#39;t as tricky to find - and sandwiched by Walrus and Carpenter and Barnacle.  Atmosphere felt romantic, yet laid back and classy at the same time - haha, strange combo of words, I know, but that&#39;s just how it felt to me.  Service was honest, friendly and helpful, drinks were good pours,... and most of all, the food was AMAZING.  

Upon recommendation, my friend and I decided to go with the prix fixe menu and I was so glad we did.  It was crazy that it was just a &#34;4 course&#34; meal because it actually felt like 11!  The Appetizer course came with 7 good sized appetizers - split pea soup, hamachi crudo, beef tartare, cured meats, bruchetta with some of the best mozzerella I&#39;ve had, a tasty salad, and fried oysters ... each of these dishes were excellent and I could have been satisfied after this course alone.  But then came the pasta entree, a meat entree, and then it was topped off by an amazing cheesecake dessert.  Now, normally, I&#39;m not a fan of cheesecake because it tends to be so heavy, but this one was so smooth, creamy, and light with the perfect amount of sweetness...even though I was full, I nearly licked the plate clean!  Such a great meal to celebrate my birthday - I can&#39;t wait to come back and dine here again!"

Pretty much every dish was over seasoned - especially with salt. We had:
1) buffalo mozzarella: a rotten tasting mozzarella with spices that made no sense and very bitter greens. We weren&#39;t the only table who didn&#39;t finish it.
2) beet salad with avocado and anchovies: the flavor was overpowered by salty anchovies. The avocado was watery and had black spots.
3) gnocchi with dunginess crab: this was the best dish we had. The sauce was hot but not spicy, though very creamy. The dunginess crab portion was generous.
4) short rib with polenta: biggest disappointment. The meat lacked flavor and was 50% fat, and there was hardly any polenta on the plate. I make better at home.
5) scallops: one of the better entrees with a generous portion of 5 scallops and a smoky flavor. The catch was, once again, far too much salt.

We had some other issues:
1) the temperature in the restaurant was over 90 degrees. I am not exaggerating. Even stripped down to Tshirts people were sweating. They run an open flame in the kitchen with zero circulating air.
2) 30 minutes between courses. That awkward moment where you realize everyone in the restaurant is looking around impatient.

I wanted to love it. I won&#39;t be back."

The best part about their Restaurant Week menu is the shared appetizers. Rather than force you into an agonizing decision between Fried Oysters and Beef Tartare they let you have both! In fact you get a little of everything! And I was thankful for that since everything was top notch. In fact they craft one of the better Beef Tartares I&#39;ve had.  The entree and desserts were also fantastic. Perfectly al dente pasta with rabbit and a texturally interesting chocolate terrine. 

The restaurant itself is very handsome if slightly dated. I say the exposed brick and industrial look is probably on the way out, not that I have a problem with it. Staple &amp; Fancy also shares the floor with a few other notable eateries which isn&#39;t a problem unless you have to use the bathroom which is down a few hallways and stairway. But no big deal.

I&#39;m from LA and I have to say we have a lot of great restaurants  but I believe that sometimes the food in LA is overrated and too pricey for what it&#39;s worth and to over flavored. Recently my boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we tried their tasting menu. Wow!!! At first we thought that we might be hungry after our meal (because we love to eat a lot. Haha) but their fist course consisted of 7 antipasto dishes. (I&#39;m pretty sure this selection may change daily ? ) I was very pleased between the balance of the salt that they used with their foods. I&#39;ve realized that many restaurant load up on sodium (not sure if it&#39;s because they think it enhances the flavors but many times dishes are just too salty.) However. STAPLE &amp; FANCY was not anything like this. Each dish was perfectly flavored. Bringing out its flavors from the dish without over doing the sauce. 

The staff was super friendly and courteous. She new exactly when to check up on us and was super helpful. Because we were visiting and was not sure although it had nothing to do with the restaurant we asked her for hiking advice. I think her name was Kate? Sorry if I got her name incorrect. My thoughts... there needs to be way more servers like her. Because of her advice we we not only enjoyed our dining experience but ended up taking a great hike (rattlesnake ledge!!) 

Thank you so much for the staff, being friendly and welcoming. The food was excellent but your awesome staff made the food even better.!!

We couldn&#39;t get a table until 10 PM, but there was a 30 minute wait in the bar.  The bar stools got a little uncomfortable after awhile, but considering we had no reservation, slightly famished and were able to even be seated at the bar... I survived.

I turned my head to the right slightly and could see the open kitchen with the chef, sous chef and cooks working away.  A very clean and organized kitchen.  Quality ingredients can make a world of difference and it is apparent the restaurant uses just that.  The meal was executed quite well.  

I started with a glass of Blossom, which consist of vodka, st germain, lemon and prosecco.  I love all those individually so putting it all together made a perfectly balanced cocktail for my pallet.  

Once we were seated, I ordered a glass of Italian wine, which the bartender recommended.  I went with a well balanced red even though we had fish.  

Starters:  Asparagus soup came with smoked mussels, asparagus and chive cream.  Served cold.  It was refreshing.  We also had grilled sardines with lemon and aoili.  Perfect balance of salt and citrus and most definitely not fishy!

Dinner:  Potato gnocchi with braised beef shortrib, leeks, and oregano.  Such great texture &amp; flavor.  Seared polenta with fontina, and crispy guanciale.  Hmmm moist.  The guanciale was a perfect topper!  Grilled whole mediterranean fish with spelt cous cous, spring vegetables served on a wooden cutting board -- this was incredible!  The meat was tender, flakey and fresh.  Reasonably priced for less than $25 for the fish.  As a matter of fact, I could see my fish being cooked on the grill.

Really love the space as well.  It&#39;s rustic, but with a modern twist.  Definitely not a bad option when Walrus is busy and quite frankly just as good.  By the time we were done eating our meal, I finally received the phone call that our table was ready next door.  My belly was already full... umm 3 hours later... and more than happy."

Service: Super awkward. We have not been here since Ethan Stowell decided to do away with tipping and add 20% to every bill. I cooked in nice restaurants for many years, and I support this practice. But I felt like it really gave our waiter a free pass. We were four people, have eaten here before,and had our heart set on some dishes. Knew about the special family/tasting menu and were asked about it before we ordered,and declined. After we finished ordering, the waiter again recommended we order the tasting menu- thought it would be better experience. What followed was an awkward back and forth for a couple of minutes where I just had to insist that yes, I understand about the tasting menu, but we are really happy with how we ordered. But the waiter would not relent- he asked if we had any food allergies, gluten free, etc. Just kept pushing us toward the tasting menu. I finally just had to draw the line and say &#34;Please just  bring us the food we ordered&#34;. Not sure why he pushed so hard- easier for the kitchen to pull off, perhaps? At any rate, I would not have tipped 20% after that exchange- just totally tone deaf in a nice restaurant like that. But it felt like there was going to be a 20% tip coming no matter what, so the waiter could act however he wanted.

The food was really great- we ordered a variety of dishes, and everything ranged from really good to really great- great ingredients, presentation, and preparation across the board.

The waiter forgot to bring us one of our side dishes, and when we mentioned this he brought it and then comped it to us, along with comping a desert. So that&#39;s a plus, but not totally unsurprising at a nice place like this. Maybe he also felt bad for bullying us earlier in the evening.

Anyways, this place will remain very high on my list, and I will go back, but will hope not to get this waiter again."

You&#39;d think this would be layup in the lunchtime restaurant world, but I&#39;ve worked downtown for 15+ years and even a decent burger place has eluded us.  Case in point, Hollywood Burger (see my previous review), which used to grace this very food court.  Then there was Built Burger (again, see my previous review), which was good but flawed in a variety of ways.  You know it&#39;s bad when you&#39;re counting McDonald&#39;s as an option for burger places downtown, but even they pulled out of the market (they&#39;re previous 3rd ave location - approximately 3rd and Columbia - closed years ago; it was scary).  

206 is good, and they have a variety of options while not trying to be any more than a good burger place.  Nothing fancy, which is how it should be.  It&#39;s not often that I even want a burger for lunch, but on those occasions it&#39;s nice to know 206 is there.  Hopefully they&#39;ll last longer than their predecessors."

Feel like jalapeño or pineapple, maybe some Swiss or whatever, they got it, and like I said before, it&#39;s really reasonably priced. I&#39;ll be a new regular for sure.

Kind of wonder why they&#39;re only open till 5 and closed on the weekends, though. That&#39;s too bad."

Ordered:
- lunch special which consists of cheeseburger, fries, and a drink for around $9.00

Fries are crispy and delicious. Burger with everything on it, lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles was tasty as well. I like how they keep their BBQ, ranch and other sauces out for easy to grab. There&#39;s some tables in the courtyard, and they&#39;ve got some counter space to eat at. More of a take to go kinda spot though. Fast service, friendly enough customer service.

As for the taste... The peanut butter shake was delicious. They fries were good, but they didn&#39;t have ketchup there. My fries need ketchup.
The burger had REAL bacon! Yum. But I think they were trying to be like in-n-out with their house sauce. It&#39;s just flavored mayo, though."

I ordered a Marion Burger, fries and a drink. The patty was juicy and meaty, and the peppers in the Marion Burger were flavorful, but not super spicy. If crazy combos aren&#39;t your thing, they have a simple cheese burger or hamburger that you can order, but if that&#39;s too plain for you, they have tons of options for customization. The fries were great in that you got thick fries and small crispy fries as well. Really amusing to eat.

I came in perhaps 10 minutes before closing, which I, having worked in the food industry before, know can be such a jerk move. However the staff there were incredibly friendly and smile-y! They made me feel like they genuinely appreciated my business.

Inside, there was only 5 or so seats available at the diner-like bar. 206 Burger Company is located in a little strip/food court though, so there&#39;s plenty of seating outside of it.

I got a regular cheeseburger with everything and fries. The burger itself is aesthetically pleasing and tastes even better. The meat isn&#39;t cooked to well done like JJ&#39;s and there is much more flavor. I don&#39;t know what is in the house sauce but it&#39;s delicious.

It can be hard IMO to find a good place that has good hand cut fries and they hit it out of the park. Fresh to order and so was the burger.

Sunny day in Seattle and going out for lunch?  Marion Court is high on the list of places to go and soak up the rays.

I rarely get a burger for lunch - 1. Because I get them plenty other times with the kids and 2. There are so many other options downtown.  But hey, it&#39;s new and I love variety.

As I was ordering I asked if they have any Yelp checkin specials.  The cashier didn&#39;t really know what I was talking about, but did say she needed to look into it.

I began to order a bacon cheese and make it a meal when a friend pointed out he got the special.  Some quick math with the cashier confirmed getting the special and adding bacon to it would be a little cost savings.

There was one person ahead of us, so the food was ready in just a few minutes.  There were at least 8 people I ducked between when I left.

A previous reviewer said they got to choose a sauce, I saw them next to the register but thought you had to buy them.  It was not mentioned that I could grab one, but then I also wasn&#39;t given a drink cup until I asked after seeing the following customer get his.  I was too busy taking pictures of the menu and putting my change away..

I thought the burger was good.  Fresh ingredients, regular bun, juicy round patty, and a secret sauce that looked like 1000 islands -pickles +red pepper flakes.  Earlier friend reports found the burger lacking flavor, but my highly attuned tongue found it just fine.  But, if you&#39;re someone who spoons a half cup of chile garlic sauce (tuong ot toi?) into everything you eat, then you might need to grab a salt and pepper packet cuz your taste buds are fried.

The more I ate the burger the more I enjoyed.  Is it perfect?  You know, at this price point, this time of day, in this general location - it&#39;s about as close as it gets.  Oh, fries were good too, some crispy some limp, all hot and fresh with just enough salt.

There used to be another burger place in the complex - Hollywood Burgers or something.  Went there once and wasn&#39;t impressed.  This place if the continue to execute like today has a longer future.

$10.30 or so including tax.  Lunch special (cheeseburger, fries, pop $7.99) plus bacon $1.49.  The bacon was a good addition too!

They cooked all our burgers to order and labeled each burger so we knew which one was which. The burgers were a good size for the price and we all enjoyed them more than burgers that are served at Mel&#39;s which is about a block away.  You get your choice of sauce which is offered at the register for free.  Burgers were juicy and delicious and came with all the fixings.  

Owners and staff were super friendly and double checked everything to make sure the order was right.

Sanje is awesome and has one of those infectious smiles :)  Chatting with her while I waited for my cooked-to-order veggie burger and fries makes the day just a little brighter.

And the veggie burger is really good. I&#39;m a vegetarian and I&#39;ve been to other burger places where the veggie burger was more of an afterthought and not very good at all. 206 Burger&#39;s black bean veggie burger was thick and meaty with a nice crispy outside topped with generous slices of tomato, onion and pickles and a leaf of lettuce. 

The fries are awesome! Crunchy, shoestrings of salt and potato. Just yum :)

Make sure you grab a cup of your favorite sauce before you leave. My veggie burger was made even more yum with some BBQ sauce!

Or in my case, just get a bacon cheeseburger, and revel in your own juices. Great sauce, cooked to perfect, a burger in balance, and perhaps a touch of smoke to the bacon. Amazing.

Sure, it isn&#39;t the fancy, hoity-toity Boka burger or anything, it&#39;s a simple, spot on rendition of an American classic. You can&#39;t argue with that, can you?

Or, something like that. 

I actually took my lazy ass on a train, from downtown, just to eat here. If you&#39;re coming from the airport and need to feed the need, it&#39;s on the way to downtown, conveniently across the way from the train stop. I forgot the name of the stop, but that&#39;s what Google map&#39;s is for.  The two/three block radius of this area has a lot of Asian food options too (all look average to good), so you really can&#39;t loose. 

It always strikes me as odd that the price of locally caught seafood, aren&#39;t significantly cheaper when the place the creatures were harvested from is a short drive away, as opposed to a 6 hour flight away. Someone told me once it has to do with &#34;market price&#34;. Fuck, MP. I spent $600 on a flight out here and want my cheap locally harvested seafood bounty. I love the word: harvested.

As expected, the price for your bag of treats is per pound. If you know the per lbs of your seafood (like I does), it&#39;s maddening to see what they charge you at places like this, especially since this kind of cooking takes minimal skill. Yes, I can make this, when I&#39;m not feeling lazy. I compartmentalize this, so I don&#39;t leap out of my chair and start turning tabes over. Or, urinating on the cash register. Sit back, have a beer and chill your ass out, Jack. 

Here&#39;s the thing, it&#39;s hard to tell how fresh(the Dungeness crab was, for obvi reasons) your seafood is at crab boils, because they are submerged in the sludge of sauce you choose that overpowers everything. You could put a squirrel in this bag and I probably would have thought it was delicious. That said, the flavor orgasm your tongue will go through makes you wonder: &#34;how can I eat seafood any other way?&#34;. The sauce is like cocaine. 

This wouldn&#39;t be my &#34;last seafood meal in Seattle kind of place&#34;. It kind of falls somewhere in the middle. It has a unique shtick in both food and atmosphere. You don&#39;t come here for minimal seasoning of seafood. You&#39;re here to get your tongue bitched slapped and sweat like Patrick Ewing in the 4th quarter.

Truly yummy flavors. We preferred the spicey to the garlic. 

It is a bit pricey, but plentiful &amp; delicious. OH &amp; sweet potato fries!!

My only peeve is the crazy busy parking lot (it&#39;s in a little corner minimall). We chose to go earlier than usual dinner hour to get a spot."

However after coming here for the first time I can say I&#39;m not impressed and not even sure if I will come back to this place.... 

1st we stand and wait at the door for well over five minutes before anyone even acknowledged us, keep in mind this place is no bigger than a bedroom closet smh. 
Secondly we arrived here around 830ish it took them awhile to come take our order but I can say the waitress was very helpful and attentive and patient. She took our order only to return a few minutes later and tell us they were out of snow crab and that we couldn&#39;t order additional potatoes with our meal (even though they were listed as sides.) This was really disappointing given the fact that the crab and shrimp were the only things we came there for. However we waited this long, most places were closing or already closed so we decided to go with other things.
The last and final straw was when we got our food, I ordered 1lb shrimp with an added potato and a piece of corn. As she handed me my order she goes &#34;1lb shrimp with 2 pieces of corn ?&#34; I corrected her and she goes &#34;oh we are out of potatoes your waiter didn&#39;t tell you ?&#34; I let her know she never said they were out, she just mentioned we couldn&#39;t have extra&#39;s. At this point I&#39;m highly annoyed and hungry which is not a good combo. I just let it go and begin to do what I came for, which was eat !
To be fair the food was great despite the trials and tribulations it took to get it but, the biggest room is the one for improvement and their customer service should could use it."

Came today after awhile and price has gone up. We got 1lbs king crab for 30$ (which is ridiculous)and 1lb blue prawn. Both tasted like it has been frozen since forever. The meat of the blue prawn felt off when I opened it and taste nasty. They used to exchange the order or take it off your bill. But now the waitress only tell me &#34;yes it&#39;s frozen that&#39;s why&#34; and we still have to pay for it and it&#39;s not cheap.
I guess never again!"

Feels like I am back in Garden Grove hunting down food in the area that this place is in .  I finally found this place since Google was taking me to the wrong complex.  It is small and a bit hidden, but definitely worth it.  My sister and I got the bang bang sauce which is all the sauces mixed together.  We got the hot version with sea snails, dungeness crab and crawfish.  You have to ask for the bib, gloves and the crab cracking device.  

Crab and the crawfish were good, the sea snails were tiny (smaller than a dime), but worth the effort.

Food came at a decent time but quality and quantity wasn&#39;t worth the price. Calamari? Looks like boiled squid with fried bits of flour on the side. Fries was soaked and soggy with oil.  Ordered 5lbs first round with crawfish, shrimp and mussel. What i saw in the bag? Those three items and some corn and potato. We ordered another 2 lbs came and realized there was suppose to be some sausage in the mix too. Got one end piece of a sausage. 7lbs of food for 6 adults, a 7 year old, 4 year old and 1.5 year old and I was lucky enough to pick up a small end piece of sausage. Honestly I believe the sausage was horrible.  Why they only had one piece I don&#39;t know. The sauce was horrible. It broke in you&#39;re mouth into a hundred pieces. 18% gratitude for party of 6 or more?

However in our bag of crawfish we only had one tiny piece of sausage, maybe it&#39;s just one of their off days but it&#39;s no big deal. 

The gloves kind of sucked because there were holes in them, and whenever we needed something we would need to go all the way in the back where the servers were hanging out chilling. Parking was also a pain in the ass. 

I did like the fact that their crawfishes were live and not cooked frozen like at crawfish king. We also ordered the Dungeness crab, but didn&#39;t like it very much, in my opinion it wasn&#39;t worth it. They did give a generous amount of sweet potato fries which was a big plus."

I&#39;m only giving them three stars because the service was not good. They messed up our order by giving us shrimp instead of the crawfish. We told the waitress and she came back and was like well I wrote it right on the paper so do you want to order the crawfish? Very apathetic. We said no but thankfully her uncle felt bad and gave us some crawfish. (We thanked him)

Nothing wrong with that.  Just an observation.

Melted butter tasted spoiled. When I asked the server about it they said that they keep it refrigerated, but regardless it was off. 

Their bam boom sauce is great. Shrimp is tasty (although prices also seem up at $15.99 / lb of shrimp).

The good... Within the moment? How else do I quote this? 

Shrimp- large shrimp. Tasted great 
Crawfish- big and juicy with good amount of meat 
Onion rings- awesome. Served with ketchup which made me miss being in Utah where fry sauce would usually be served. 
Sweet potato fries- thin and crispy, also served with ketchup 
Raw oysters- served with the usual condiments.  No complaints.. Yet ? 

The bad:

SERVICE. Wow. It took them 15 minutes to get us water and another 15 to come back and take out order.  They never checked on us and so when we wanted to place another order, we had to constantly wave them down.  When we did get out order in, they seemed annoyed that we &#34; bothered&#34; them.  I felt a little animosity in the air.  

I threw up everything an hour later. Yes I&#39;m talking emesis on yelp but you guys should know.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t the food, maybe it was but I was feeling fine until after I ate here.  My stomach ache has now lasted 6 hours and I haven&#39;t been able to eat anything else.  I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d come back here and more so bc of the staff and not the food.  I&#39;d give the food another chance but I wouldn&#39;t order raw oysters here.  I will stick to the crawfish and shrimp and you guys should too."

Holy crap, the first thing I will say is they do not mess with the spice level. I consider myself to be able to tolerate extremely spicy food, and their &#34;lil spicy&#34; is already extremely spicy to me.

Their boom bang sauce which is a mixture of everything is probably one of the best tasting sauces that I have ever had. I&#39;m drooling just thinking about it. The seafood (usually get a combo of shrimp, crawfish, and crab) absorbs that delicious sauce. Their crawdads are HUGE! They are a little pricey, but it is seafood so it is a bit expected.

And make sure you get bread or rice to go with your seafood to soak up even more of that delicious sauce."

Cajun crawfish is a solid 4 stars!!! Food was banging! Service was quick and friendly! The only thing missing was that &#34;super wow factor&#34;.

Service: we drove from the east side, SUPER excited to try this place for the first time and we pull up around 9pm on a Monday and the open sign was turned off :( I was bummed, thinking maybe they were slow and closed shop early and was ready to drive away, then boo stops the car and looks in, then opens the door lol and there was a private party going on but they gladly welcomed us in anyway! Thank goodness! So even though they were tending to a large private party, they still made sure we understood how to order, what to order, and were super nice whenever we needed something or had questions! The private party even shared some cake with us! How sweet!

Food: if you&#39;ve ever been to boiling crab in California where the wait is literally 3 hours.. This place serves food very reminiscent to that, except, NO WAIT! Heck yeah! It works the same way where you pick your proteins/ seafood, and pick your sauce, then enjoy! We decided to go with the mix (minimum of 2lbs) which was perfect for the two of us! We choose crab (duh), shrimp, and mussels! The other options included clams and crawfish. And we chose the whole boom bang sauce which is a mixture of the three sauces offered (original Cajun, garlic butter, and lemon pepper) but what I really liked is that you can control how spicy it is! We went with 4/5 stars or hot. When we got the food, omg HEAVEN! The snow crab was so full and soft! Flavors were out of this world! My first bite I basically inhaled 9 pieces of garlic because I didn&#39;t realize it was garlic- oops! Just sooo tasty I&#39;m craving it now. My only qualm is that the Cajun boil only came with one piece of sausage, one half potato, and one piece of corn.. So we had to share those lol. But it was all delicious I can&#39;t be mad at that! We also got the Cajun fries! A bit spicier than your classic Cajun basket but I&#39;m not complaining! Just sharing :) the fries were cooked perfectlyyy and came out super hot!

This place is super clean and they have a sink outside the washroom to clean your hands in after eating (trust me you&#39;ll need to)

We ordered a mixed bag of mussels, crawfish, and crab tossed in the Boom Bang sauce. We also ordered a loaf of the French bread (banh mi French bread toasted). 

mussels were tasty, wish there were more. I loved that they were open already and covered in sauce. 

Crab was good too. Legs were pretty skinny. Wish they were bigger. 

I&#39;m not a big fan of crawfish to begin with so I regret ordering it now. The bag was 60% crawfish. These things don&#39;t have much meat to begin with but my mom commented that the crawfish were&#39;t that fresh. After she pointed it out I noticed the meat was rather mushy and didn&#39;t have the slight sweet taste they should. 

The toasted french bread was great to scoop up remaining sauce and eat with the seafood.

We were hungry and decided to try The Cajun Crawfish on Martin Luther King as we were in the area. We got there about 1:30 in the afternoon and there were just 1 table not occupied which was great because the service was pretty quick. We ordered 2 lbs seafood mix with your chosen sauce - in our case, garlic butter. Fried calamari and garlic fries. 

The food was good, however the shrimp, clams, sausage, potatoes, corn and crab are all delivered to your table in the same plastic bag so they all have the same taste from the seasoning. The seasoning is the best, although the heat creeps up on you even with the lowest spice level. 

The fries had a seasoning on them that made it too hot for me &amp; my daughters to eat, so if you don&#39;t like real spicy food please ask them to go lightly on the spice. Although it is tasty, it can get very messy. 

It&#39;s not your traditional dinner with plates and spoons, but with plastic gloves, utensils for cackling crab, lobster, king crab legs, etc, and eating right off the covered tables!! Oh don&#39;t be alarm you will be given a bib to protect your clothing! It was a totally awesome experience. I recommend it to anyone willing to try and experience a totally new &#34; out of the box&#34; way of dining!! Bon appetite!!

If you&#39;re sensitive to spice or seasoning in general then this place might not be for you.  

But I am glad there are places like these up in Washington to assuage a San Diegan&#39;s heart from the breakup with mexican food. ;)

The boom boom bang sauce is a mix of all the sauces they have... and it&#39;s a thumbs up! 

Tips? Why yes I do have some. Ask for a couple sets of gloves ahead of time, as the kind they give you tend to break while enjoying delicious seafood.  Also, I love spicy food. As in, I can hardly find spicy food that actually makes me sniffle. The &#34;hot&#34; was just enough for me."

You&#39;d think for a restaurant with the name crawfish, they&#39;d have more then enough. If you were a sit down customer you can eat the crawfish. We still ordered more than $200 worth and it was worth it. 

The seasoning was well done. I brought some to another family members house, they loved it and went back for more. 

It&#39;s a little pricey, so honestly I&#39;d go when they have crawfish available. So make time if your only way to eat crawfish is to be seated. Hopefully they don&#39;t make the mistake in the order again lol."

Crawfish is a lot of work to eat, but if you prefer something easier and meatier, order the other seafood like clams, mussels, crab, or shrimp. They have specials like king crab also for about $19.99 a pound. 

They&#39;re a little skimpy on corn and sausages if you get the minimum combo order, but you can always order extra sides. We usually order the baguette because it&#39;s fresh out the oven and tasty to soak up the sauces.

Their fried frog legs aren&#39;t that great - maybe I&#39;m just not a fan of the veiny texture, but it was also dry. Their boom bang sauce is an awesome mixture of garlic, lemon, pepper, etc. so be sure to use gloves when eating or wash your hands a million times so they don&#39;t smell afterwards.

If you have a big group, be sure to make reservations ahead of time because it can get really busy. And they only accept one check per party of 5-6 or more."

Likewise, the greatest disservice a business, and it&#39;s representatives can do to their customers is simply, not care. 

I&#39;ve been dying to find a place similar to The Boiling Crab. My friend strongly recommended The Cajun Crawfish so we all hopped in a car and headed there straight after work. 

My friend had nothing but good things to say so we were all excited. 

By the time we arrived it was 8PM. They would be closing at 9 and their kitchen is set to close 30 minutes prior to the time they close. Working in a place where we all hope to get out on time, we were already making plans to head in, make nothing more than one order and head out. 

The minute we walked in we were &#34;greeted&#34; with a &#34;Sorry, our kitchen is closed,&#34; by someone I can only assume was a waitress. 

My friend referred to the sign on the front that says &#34;kitchen will close 30 minutes before closing.&#34; The waitress responded with something along the lines of &#34;we&#39;re out of crawfish,&#34; and made a comment about that&#39;s why their sign is off. 

Ok... So, there&#39;s no shrimp? Oysters? Lobsters? 

If you&#39;re not going to honor your signage, what your website says, or your scheduled hours, what&#39;s the point? 

Don&#39;t subject people who are looking to recommend and support your business with cattiness. That&#39;s not how it should be. 

I always try to have something positive to say but this experience was by far one of the worst I&#39;ve ever had. I hope that if I were to ever return, the experience is memorable for the right reasons."

Oyster shooters are amazing! I order once almost every time I come. 

Garlic fries and Cajun fries are super yummy!

I usually get the combo of shrimp, clams and crawfish. I think it&#39;s like $12.99 per pound or $14.99 per pound. There is a minimum of 2lbs when you&#39;re ordering this combo tho. Which actually is a good amount if there&#39;s just two people eating. 

I have not gotten crab since that one time and I honestly don&#39;t plan on getting it again. I just don&#39;t wanna be disappointed if I get mushy crab again."

I hate feeding my appetite for seafood because it can get so spendy. But I guess that&#39;s just something I gotta learn to live with haha. The funny thing about this restaurant is that their crawfish is no good. It&#39;s definitely frozen and you don&#39;t need anything but a taste test to tell. But, I&#39;m definitely in love with their house sauce. Best best best combo! I&#39;d recommend doing the 3 types of seafood in a bag deal. You choose between snow crab, mussels, clams, crawfish, and shrimp. Justttt don&#39;t get crawfish haha. They also have french bread here! That, and the sweet potato fries are also worth giving a try. Don&#39;t forget about the King crab when you have a little extra in your wallet! It can get real pricey real quick, but for good seafood, you gotta pay up. I&#39;ll definitely be back.... when I&#39;m paid good that is. haha!"

The crawfish and shrimp were delicious, reasonably priced, and a ton of fun to dig into. We got one pound/person, and definitely had enough food. Make sure you get a loaf or two of the Vietnamese-style bread to mop up all the sauce.

My boyfriend and I arrived at 8pm (on a Friday, and according to their business hours and sign, they close at 10pm with the kitchen closing 30 minutes prior, 9:30pm) only to be approached by a disgruntled, angry customer asking whether we were on the waiting list because they gave him a hard time as their &#34;kitchen was closing.&#34; (Keep in mind, we came two hours before the closing time).

Confused, we went up and ask if there was a waiting list, only to be scoffed at by a waitress and told matter-of-factly that the &#34;kitchen is closing in 45 minutes&#34; (so now their kitchen closing time is 8:45pm? What?) and that they weren&#39;t taking anymore customers. 

We questioned why, and they replied, &#34;We have one group waiting for a table with four seats, and another three people waiting for another table.&#34; The restaurant had *four* tables open. They also left those remaining tables with the previous customers&#39; trash so they appeared to be more packed than they actually were.

So..... let me get this straight. You have two groups waiting. Two tables. But you have four tables available? What kind of argument is that? We even counted the available seats and table for them.

It got to the point where it was just so obvious they were antsy to leave that my boyfriend asked, &#34;so just tell us now, tell us if you guys just want to close early,&#34; to which they replied &#34;yes.&#34;

We usually enjoy this spot but if they can&#39;t take in their customers well over an hour and a half before closing and honor their store hours or signage, well then, their business isn&#39;t worth our time.

We ended up going to Crawfish King, where they were very accommodating and apologized for the two-minute wait. They even took orders 20 minutes before closing time."

Parking..not so much of a yes. I always park on the road or else I&#39;ll be walking back to a broken or ding&#39;ed up car.

The food here is yummy. I like the richness in the broth.

The prices are a bit high, but you do get what you pay for.

It&#39;s pretty messy so bring extra hand wipes or a towel.

The restaurant is fairly small so cozy up.

The food here is still good, but the service is horrible! When we got there, there were only two other occupied tables. We were told to sit at any wall table. We were dropped off menus but then after close to 10 min still no one came to take our food or drink order. By the time the girl finally came back and took our order three more tables were now occupied. Ten min later we had our sweet potato fries but no beverages! Another girl dropped off the fries and she asked if we wanted something to drink and I said yes and told her what I told the other girl when she initially took our order. She brought over the drinks in a couple minutes. When the food finally came, I ask for the tools for the crab. She only brought over one set and there was two of us. Last time I was here they only brought over one set and said the others were being washed. I asked for a second set this time as well and never got them.

No one checks up on you after you get your food. I ordered a &#39;lil spicy&#39; or lever 2 for our seafood and it tasted like a level 4. My mom had to wave someone down for water and that took a while as well. After 35-45 into our meal finally the girl who originally took our order asked if we wanted refills on our drinks. 

I don&#39;t think I want to dine in here again. Just place my order over the phone and come and pick it up. They clearly don&#39;t hire servers with experience (coming from a former server) nor do one of the girls who work there stay on top of her tables. Beverages should always be asked for and brought within minutes of a guest sitting down at the very least! The other girl with straight hair at least seemed more professional and more on top of things and always smiling."

The whole boom bang with shrimp, clams, and crawfish are always good. ask for the chilies and lime on the side to dip the shrimp in if you want an extra flavorful acidic kick to break up the heavy savory garlic sauce. I always like getting the french bread here, too! Always super hot and perfect for dipping in the garlic sauce... I mean you paid for it.. Might as well eat everything in that bag. 

I love the sauce here and if you like spicy food and garlic, this place will not disappoint. Very messy to eat, so make sure to pull up your sleeves and clean out your finger nails. They also serve gloves if you really don&#39;t want to touch your food (boo no fun). 

The first 3-4 times I came here, the crawfish were huge! But today, they were a lot smaller than usual.... Something you see at any asian buffet. Puny. I wonder why. Still very good though, and very tasty. The gulf shrimp are always huge! I love dipping these in the chili lime mixture. I wish they served more sausage and potatoes in their bag.. But since they charge by lb, I guess you would want more seafood than potatoes. 

Staff was nice! They messed up ringing up our order a couple times but their card machine is down, so it&#39;s understandable.

Pricy, and not extremely filling for what you pay for, unless you get the french bread. Plus you smell like garlic for a couple days even if you shower. Not a place to go to everyday, but always a treat when you do! One of my favorite places. I always crave it!"

We arrive at 8:07pm and on the front of the door, it says &#34;we stop serving 30min before close.&#34; Great, they close at 9:00pm, we will order quickly and eat and leave. 
Wrong. 
I opened the door and a waitress greeted me with &#34;sorry we&#39;re closed, kitchen is already closed&#34; 
... So I said &#34;your sign says you stop serving 30min before you close&#34; 
And she responded with &#34;oh, I mean we are sold out of crawfish&#34;.... 
What? Suddenly after I pointed out the sign, you&#39;re out of crawfish?

Service: Water was always filled, the girls that work there check on you frequently, very friendly and talkative. 

For two people, we ordered the 3 pounds of the seafood combo with snow crab legs, clams, and crawfish in the Boom Bang Sauce and 2 loafs of the bread.

The sauce: we choose was the Boom Bang sauce in mild. The girl said that the mild already had a decent amount of spice, so we decided to go with that. And she wasn&#39;t kidding. If you can&#39;t handle spice, go for the next level down. So much garlic deliciousness! It was so good I kept dunking my French bread in there!

The seafood: The shells on the snow crab legs weren&#39;t mushy or soft, which means that the crab legs weren&#39;t over cooked or frozen for too long. The clams were HUGE. None of the just shells bullshit. The crawfish, amazing, but a lot of work. 

The bread: Hot, buttery deliciousness. Its so good you can eat it all by itself. Even better when dipped in the Boom Bang sauce!

I will be coming back!"

Super garlicky and flavorful. Probably not the best place to take someone on a first date since it gets really messy! ;) 

I typically come here on a Tuesday. Not only is it my day off from work, but it&#39;s also &#34;spin the wheel&#34; you spend a certain amount on your food, then you get to spin the wheel for a free appetizer, 10% off your bill, and etc. (keep in mind you can also lose your turn, bummer) 

Space and seating is very limited since the restaurant is pretty small itself. Cute decorations, very clean, and there&#39;s parking out front. Restaurant is located in an Asian plaza.

I always order about 2+ pounds crawfish and I get it in the whole boom bang sauce and a little spicy. It comes with potatoes, sausages, and corn on the cob if you order more than 2 pounds. Crawfish itself is not very filling, and hard to work for such a small amount of meat. I like to order French bread to dip into the boom bang sauce, and some fries to help fill me up. I&#39;ve also had their clams, and calamari. They give you lime and seasoning salt to dip your crawfish on, but I always ask for the melted butter because I actually prefer that over the lime.

The fried mushrooms are okay, and I&#39;ve had the boom bang fried rice twice. The first time I had it, it was so good. The last time I ordered it, the rice was over cooked and the whole dish was just soggy (gross). 

Service is okay, some of the waitresses are nice but very forgetful. I&#39;ve had to ask or remind them multiple times for something which can get kind of annoying when you&#39;re trying to just eat and enjoy your meal.

Don&#39;t wear nice clothing here and ask for gloves if you don&#39;t want your hands and fingers smelling like garlic for days on end!"

Spousal unit and I wanted to get out of our usual Friday night rut, plus we didn&#39;t want to drive, so after consulting the oracle (Yelp) we decided to check out Cajun Crawfish at 7:00 on a Friday night. We are not smart. It was crazy busy - it&#39;s very small, so there was a wait. The servers were super nice, told us it would be about 20 minutes. The amazing aromas kept us captive, so we were happy to wait. While we were waiting we saw a guy stagger through the restaurant lugging a big crate marked &#34; live seafood&#34; _ promising, very promising...

We ordered a combo of crawfish, mussels and gulf shrimp in the bang boom sauce, 3 stars. Holy. Mother. Of. Pearl. It was SO good! We ordered bread to sop up the sauce,then we ordered more bread to sop up more sauce. I could eat that stuff with a spoon. The gulf shrimp were so sweet and delicious and BIG. The green- lip mussels are super good, quite different from our local mussels, bigger and plumper. The server told us &#34; the crawfish are Pacific crawfish is that OK?&#34; Helz yeah it was OK. 

You cannot be a neat freak and enjoy this food. Even with bibs, it&#39;s not a tidy situation. If you want to stay pretty, you could order one of the fried options. The catfish looked really tempting, but I was happy swimming in bang boom sauce. By the time we were done, we were covered in sauce, reeking of garlic, lips burning, with blissed out grins on our faces. We will be back."

I&#39;ve only been to one other place similar to this and I remember it being good but didn&#39;t review it right after, so there you are.

THIS PLACE is awesome. I&#39;ve come by to check out the menu before but never had a chance to eat. As is every place on MLK, it&#39;s understated and found in a nondescript shopping complex. 

We reserved a table, which is probably a good idea considering how busy it was. Once you start ordering bags of seafood mixed with corn, you realize how much more you need/want/covet. &#39;We&#39;ll take a couple of Dungeness crabs in Boom Bang sauce and garlic butter. Oh, and we&#39;ll have a couple of orders of snails. How about some rice? Corn? Blue Prawns? Clams? Fries? Frog? Okay, I think we&#39;re good now.&#39;

Wait, that Boom Bang sauce is addictive. How about some hot buttered (!) baguettes (four, please!) to sop up that garlic, butter (margarine, me thinks?) Cajun and other spices?

The steamed snails were delicious and tender. I had a couple of Pretty Woman moments where they slipped out of my hands onto the floor. The service is amazing here, but nobody caught them in their hand and said, &#34;It happens all the time.&#34;

The crab was so very good. The green mush innards are hit and miss with me. I sometimes like it smeared on bread, and some days, it&#39;s too avocado-y to me. But when you&#39;re with a food-loving Yelpers, it never goes to waste! The Blue Prawns were the least interesting to me. They were very firm and a little bland. I&#39;ll stick to the regular prawns next time. I did like the clams, although the sauce may have been been too much for their delicate flavor.

The buttered baguette was nuclear in temperature; crusty and shiny with butter on top. And the deep-fried frog was good (a little chewy, but it&#39;s easy to do when fried). We used the fries like Boom Bang brooms to sweep up the sauce into our mouths. Gawd, I love eating with my hands.

There&#39;s even a sink outside the bathroom so you can wash up and stop to take pics of the food! 

And like I mentioned, the service is amazing. The waitperson told us that due to crawfish regulations, all crawfish are not shipped live in the US any longer. Sad for us, but probably a better way to travel if you were a crawfish. 

Our combined bill was just over $30 each, and there was not a hungry tummy in the group. I&#39;ll just have to plan not being around other people for at least 24 hours."

Seafood combo with shrimp, clams and crawfish and the whole boom bam sauce (~$28) - 4/5. Overall this was definitely very tasty. The crawfish were fresh, the shrimps huge and the clams plentiful. Typically, I&#39;d only order shrimp, but I just had to get my crawfish craving.

The differences are that the sauce here is much thicker than BC, but there&#39;s also a lot less. However, they are both equally flavorful. I still prefer BC because I can take that sauce home to use as a noodle soup base."

Cajun crawfish gives you the option to pick LIVE crawfish for $14.99lb or frozen for $9.99. I opted for live crawfish and what was brought out to me was anything but that!

For those of you who don&#39;t know,  there is a HUGE DIFFERENCE in quality between live and frozen. Live crawfish when cooked is nice and plump. The shells are hard and easy to Peel, while frozen crawfish are rubbery and can also be a mushy mess...  And that is exactly what I got in my bag. Crawfish with soft shells and mushy meat. It was impossible to eat those things cause the shells just kept crumbling off in little pieces taking the meat along with it. I was so disappointed that I stopped eating and decided to take it home. In my bag full of frozen crawfish,  there were about 2 live ones that were thrown in there.  

I find it pretty sad that this restaurant thinks it&#39;s okay to lie to customers like this!  It&#39;s as if they think we cant tell the difference between the two. I definitely don&#39;t appreciate being ripped off. Beware!"

I love cajun food which is hard to find in the PNW and even most other &#34;good&#34; places around here have the micro crawfish only but these were actually good size.

I saw a couple on a date here and I chuckled because eating here is a mess (in a good way).  You get a large bag of food on a sheet of butcher paper and you go at it with your bare hands--caveman style.

My obsession with shellfish started in my mother&#39;s womb. For all I know, I came out with lobsters in my hand?? Ate prawns instead of milk? Well, it certainly feel that way. And cajun boils? Well that&#39;s just a given. Of course you&#39;ll have to love it!

Seattle lacks in cajun seafood boils places but we do have a few. This one happens to be the best one in my opinion. It&#39;s simple, fast and delicious.

Nestled deep in Rainier, it is a little far away to get to or find it for that matter. It&#39;s kind of hidden in the tiny strip mall across from a bigger strip mall. The place is always crowded. And their seafood is always fresh too!

What do you get at cajun crawfish? Crawfish of course. Well, until that state ban on fresh craw fish anyways. Now you can only get frozen craw fish in WA state. Did ya know that??? I found out a couple of months ago so now I stay away. Thank goodness they still have plenty of other fishies to eat here :)

Prawns- $13.99 a lb
Blue Prawns - $15.99 a lb
Dungeness crab- $19.99 a lb
Snow crab legs - $15.99 a lb
Sea snail - $12.99 a lb
Craw fish - $11.99 a lb.

So far I&#39;ve tried them all. Dungeness crab is the hardest to eat with all that sauce! I like my cajun hot and spicy through the roof. Imagine cracking crab with that sauce all over? It&#39;s like a sauna for your fingers (even with the gloves). 

 Prawns - they are always tasty and fresh! One pound of these guys in an extra spicy extra crazy boom bam sauce = a very happy me!
 
Blue Prawns- these are way better than my prawns!! Giant big blue prawns with giant big heads and legs. It has that lobster-y chewyness. You also get less because these are big. But they are delish!

Craw fish- a ok.
Crab legs- yummmm!
Sea snail- you can get them in sweet sauce or the spicy sauce. I love these little guys. So goooooood!

You can also try other things like fried catfish, fried oysters and cajun wings. Catfish was a ok. The wings were good. I&#39;ve also tried their boom bam fried rice on one of my visits here. Rice is always hard to eat for me with my shellfish. With my hands all invested in that bag of shellfish, I&#39;m happy if I can reach to my water.

Service- always great! Last night was packed as usual and the two girls that worked there made sure every table was served, refill and clean right on cue. Oh and if you spend $40 or more on a Tuesday, you get to spin the wheel with prizes on it! We got 10% off our bill last time. This time, we didn&#39;t get our total till much later and couldn&#39;t spin because the kitchen was closed. They told us to come back anytime and spin for 10% off bill, fried oysters, fried fish etc! Not that I need a reason to go back but guess now I&#39;m obligated to ;) #Piscivores for life!"

Never-mind, can&#39;t get this craving fulfilled anywhere else, so I&#39;ll be back.

I don&#39;t know how authentic it is to Louisiana crawfish/seafood boils but it&#39;s mouth watering, savory, and delicious every time! The restaurant is pretty small so make sure you get here before dinner time, as it tends to get really packed, and really busy. 

The service is always spot on! The girls are really attentive, and friendly. We ordered 2 pounds of crawfish, 2 pounds of gulf shrimp, and 2 pounds of mussels, corn, sausages, potatoes with the whole boom bang sauce, hot. You don&#39;t have to wait long for your food and it comes out in a boil bag. I like that they don&#39;t pour it out on your table as that tends to get messy. The whole boom bang sauce is so garlicky  delicious and the HOT is so spicy! We were sniffling because it was so spicy, but that didn&#39;t stop us from eating almost the whole bag because it was so good! 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant! They have a ton of other options if you don&#39;t feel like having the the seafood boil. I wish I lived closer so I can come here every week!"

Seattles restaurant scene is seriously lacking in quality of ethnic cuisine, and the Cajun seafood restaurant scene is no exception. When I lived in Los Angeles I used to go frequently to Boiling Crab, which has a very similar menu and concept as the Cajun Crawfish. The value of the meal you get here is comparably worse -- the prices are much higher (9.99/ lb vs 14.99/ lb) and when you order any sides like corn, rice, sausage, they&#39;re probably 1/4 of the size you would expect. 

Tip: don&#39;t get the prawns, you&#39;re paying for the weight of their giant shells.


I guess if I didn&#39;t know any better and Cajun crawfish was the only restaurant of it&#39;s kind I had tried, I would say i enjoyed my meal, but because I know of other places that offer much more value I would say this place is a rip off."

We then asked for a bigger table and the girl hesitated but decided to let us sit at the 6 people table. 

We ordered the seafood special with shrimp and crawfish and several pounds of clams and some Cajun fries. The crawfish was a little over cooked.  The fries were basically normal fries with a bit of Cajun powder sprinkled on top.  

The waitress gave us the bill while we were midway through our meal which I thought was a little strange.  And while we were still eating, the waitress asked if we were ready to pay.  Umm our hands were still covered in crawfish sauce and we weren&#39;t even done eating."

 I&#39;m not sure what was Cajun about the Cajun fries, maybe they forgot to sprinkle on the seasoning. They were just regular fries. Pretty nice though.

We usually get a combo or two with the whole boom bang sauce 3 star. 
 - The gulf shrimp was really awesome. Fresh large shrimp that soaked up the flavors from the boil. 
 - The crab had some really nice parts and a few thin near meatless legs. Would have liked to see more consistency.
- The mussels were fantastic. Large and juicy, full of flavor.
- The clams were ok. The shell was a lot heavier than the meat so that&#39;s annoying since the combo is by weight.
 - The first time we got crawfish it was a bit of a disappointment. They were not as fresh as I was hoping and some weren&#39;t cleaned well and still had some grit and sand. One of them had in fact gone bad and was completely black and acrid on the inside. Unfortunate. The second time was a little better with these.
- The snails were a major fail. They were so tiny that it was almost not worth all that effort for the minuscule amount of meat that comes out of it. I really wish they had larger snails.
 - The corn is outstanding, the potato is ok and the sausage was this small tiny disgusting piece that didn&#39;t taste of anything and which I will definitely ask them to leave out the next time around.

The sauce itself was really nice and got spicier over the course of the meal. Loved it. Do get their fresh french bread to soak up the sauce in the end. It&#39;s superb.

Overall I would say some of the food was really good. There were a few misses but that forgivable. The food is pricey but worth it. I would love to go back here again and keep repeating the pros and have a better experiences on the cons."

Prices are pretty average for seafood...I got the mixed/combo bag where you can choose three options (from snow crab, crayfish, mussels, clams and shrimp) for $13.99 per pound. The minimum order is two pounds so you&#39;re already paying almost $30 for the dish. The good news is you can share, so bring those friends!

Sauces: holy cow, the cajun sauce even though you can order it on a scale of hotness from 1-5 was very spicy! Beware, a 3= a 5...The smaller items tend to sit and marinate in the sauce at the bottom of the bag, too so they can get very spicy very fast. I&#39;ve also tried the garlic butter..considerably less of an attack on the mouth and very flavorful. This might be my favorite. However, I have yet to try the sauce where they throw all the options into one. Sounds like it could be really good or...a disaster. We&#39;ll have to see!

My friend and I were incredibly hungry when we were there (can you tell?) so we also got a dozen oysters. I was pleasantly surprised to find they were not too salty nor did they taste like the beach. What a plus!

From my previous experience with the hot new crawfish chains, such as Hot n Juicy and Boiling Crab, I couldn&#39;t help myself, but give this place in Seattle a try.  I came with a big group, but we ordered 2 lbs of seafood per person.  The general surroundings were similarly to a Thai restaurant meets Boiling Crab, and the staff here are extremely friendly (+1 star).  As for the seafood, I thought that the crawfish was bit underwhelming, since they were very soft which made it difficult to dig out the meat. The sauce was extremely spicy and I chose the second spiciest.  I don&#39;t think that I was overly sensitive to the spices because I usually eat about 6 blazing wings at BDubs/visit.  I was about to die because it felt like they popped a ghost pepper into that sauce.  [sweating at the very thought]  That being, said... we did order 2 lbs of shrimp that was in their butter sauce, which so good because its BUTTER!

I would definitely come back. The staff was very friendly and the food was reasonably priced.  My recommendation would be to order the butter and spicy sauce, then blend them together. It would definitely taste 100 times better."

A few orders were handed to the wrong people. We ordered 10 pounds of crawfish, shrimp, and clams and had to pay almost $300.

Food was good and pretty fresh. King crab legs were good, shrimp was good! We also tried their catfish. Not so good. Sorry. I found the breading off-putting. Maybe it was the oil? Maybe it needed to be changed?

Either way, despite the catfish, we would definitely go back with friends. 

Word to the wise - if you can park on the street, do it. That parking lot is cramped and crowded due to the number of shops and the lack of parking due to the number of customers they draw in. 

The restaurant itself is also small and a bit cramped. Get there during non-peak hours for maximum dining comfort is what we would recommend."

This place is a cajun/creole seafood place which is very similar to The Boiling Crab out in California.  First choose the type of seafood you desire, the sauce you want them drenched in (cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper, or the whole boom-bang which is all three combined), and how spicy you can handle.  Then tie a bib around your neck and keep a roll of paper towels handy.  Finally dig right in and enjoy your meal.

My sister and I ordered the seafood combo for $13.99 which lets you mix certain types of seafood together (crawfish, mussels, snow crab legs, clams, or gulf shrimp) with a 2lb minimum.  It also comes with sausage, potato, and corn in the bag.  We decided on 2lbs of crawfish, clams, and gulf shrimp.  We also ordered a pound of king crab legs and cajun fries.  To our luck, it was spin the wheel day and my sister won us an order of fried calamari.  Everything came out piping hot and the seafood tasted fresh.  The only thing I have to complain about is that the king crab legs were pretty small.  It resembles more of snow crab legs.

I loved the atmosphere and the service here.  The waitresses were pretty laid back, funny, and cheerful.  They kept our cups filled with water and were really attentive.  Nothing more I can ask for.

It&#39;s alright. Crawfish weren&#39;t that big and not all were that great in quality. Some kinda mushy texture. Clams and Shrimp were pretty normal. Sea snails were tiny and one of the others in the group ordered it. Not something I care much for. We got the &#34;everything&#34; mix with mostly no spice. The sauce is kinda thick. It was a true 0.5 star spiciness out of a 5 star scale. I prefer Boiling Crab&#39;s sauce and quality of seafood. I know you can&#39;t have it in seattle, but I guess I have no real crawfish cravings so I can wait til I travel elsewhere.

We had uber&#39;ed it to the area so I couldn&#39;t really tell you how to get here. BUT there is a parking lot, and if you notice all the surrounding stores/restaurants are all asian. It&#39;s in an asian plaza.

Customer Service: We got seated right away! But the thing is, we would ask for certain things and the waitress would forget or take forever to bring it. Keep in mind it wasn&#39;t packed.

Decor: Simple, when you walk in there&#39;s about I would say 8-10 tables. The place isn&#39;t very big. And there are TVs hung up on each side of the walls.

Presentation of Food:  Just like any type of cajun restaurant. All tossed in a bag with their sauce. They use a small glass bowl for the rice.

How did the food taste?: To be honest the sauce they use here is GOOD, and this is comparing it to lie 5-6 or 6 cajun spots in the bay area including Boiling Crab which is one of the most popular ones. The sauce is good, and the spice level stays true to what they say it is. I&#39;ve experienced going to different cajun spots and always get the &#34;oh if you like spicy hot is ok&#34; and it ends up not being spicy at all or, the...&#34;hot is very spicy, I would go with mild&#34; and mild comes out to be not spicy at all. So I appreciate the level of spiciness is accurate! We got the big combo with corn, potatoes, added sausage, gulf shirmp, king crab legs, and clams. It&#39;s worth it! The shirmp were so big, the king crab legs filled with meat, and the clams were bigger too. Only thing is, the sausage wasn&#39;t good and that&#39;s one of the main things I look for at a cajun spot! Try using andouille sausage cajun crawfish, it will be  a hit i promise! Also, lastly they gave us BABY PORTIONS of rice, I swear it seemed like they did one scoop in the glasss bowl and handed it to us. We asked for more and they were polite enough to add a little bit more with no charge.

Overall Experience: Good, we were full!!!!

Would I Come Back?: It was good to try because we aren&#39;t from the area but Seattle is full of great restaurants that I would want to explore more!"

I waited 45 minutes and when my crabs came, it was enough to feed a small child and cost $70+ dollars.
The next night, I decided I would have more crabs yet away from the mega-expensive pier restaurants. I saw a listing for Cajun style seafood on MLK boulevard so I assumed I was going into the hood which didn&#39;t bother me being African-American.
To my surprise, it was the Vietnamese hood which I had no problem with either.
The crabs, crawfish,shrimp and mussels were FANTASTIC. I had mine extra spicy and they were extra extra spicy. I was the only non-Vietnamese person there and no one cared (as I knew they would not). Great staff. I had so much food that I could not finnish my crabs.GREAT place! To all of you non-minorities- message- get out of your comfort zone, away from the tourist and you shall be rewarded.

They put large bits of garlic in there sauce which makes it even more danky.  We also bought garlic fries which went pretty well with our seafood.

Our server didn&#39;t seem very experienced she forgot to get us waters and bring us our lime wedges. Then halfway through our meal she asked us if we wanted to spin the wheel, a promotion they had. We could have won 20% off our bill and menu items. We ended up winning fries. Which we already had ordered. It would have been nice if she had asked us to spin the wheel before we completed our order.

I personally prefer Crawfish House in White Center. Their sauce is way better, they puree their garlic into there sauce. Plus the owners served me and they were super nice."

I came here a couple of times! We ordered the pound of clams, 2 pounds of crawfish, French bread, and their fried rice! Everything was good except for the fried rice. The rice was overcooked and soggy. I dip the bread in the crawfish sauce! If you don&#39;t  want your hands to smell like garlic after, they provide gloves for you to wear and they give you bibs to help keep your shirt clean! Come here on Tuesdays and you get to spin the wheel of goodies!! You can get 10% off, free calamari, free Cajun fries, free fried mushrooms, etc! I believe this place is overpriced ($14/lb crawfish) ($10/lb clams). We got many clam shells instead of actual clams in them. Service was okay, we had to ask multiple times to spin the wheel last night and she kept forgetting. Other than that, service was satisfactory and my cup of water was never dry."

It&#39;s a  bit out of the way for most people but the seafood drowning in spicy butter Cajun sauce is absolutely worth it. 

No desserts and few appetizers. I got the crab legs once and it was strictly ok. Go for the crawfish or shrimp. 

It&#39;s good seafood but doesn&#39;t look like anything fancy and the place is super casual. The tables are covered in plastic and they give you plastic bins (which now that I think of is terrible for the environment,lol on the plus it saves water?)"

Lol, I must say, my first time at the Cajun Crawfish was a hot success!!! Wooooo. I love this place. I am craving some as I type. 

We enter, and it&#39;s a small, but cozy and friendly place. We are seated immediately. We order the sea snails, fried mushrooms, I believe the seafood combo with clams, corn, potatoes, and shrimp. We had I think 2 or 3 lbs which ended up being a total of $45-$50 I believe. With the whole boom bang, and I think we ordered a mild spiciness. Oh, and some french bread and the youngin&#39; had an order of catfish and fries ($8).

I must say this whole boom bang was bangin! It was a kick of spice, but a lot of finger lickin&#39;-can we lick the bag G-O-O-D! The sauce was soaking all the seafood goodies. The french bread was delicious with the sauce. Definitely on point. Very saucy and succulent. The crawdaddies were tasty, some were a bit small, but it came with a lot. I think the corn was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were good too (not mushy or too soft). 

The sea snails, at first, I was so disgusted. However, they taste like nothing. they give you toothpicks to pick em out (pretty genius). They give you some sweet chili sauce to dip with it (not that great). But they give you a lot of snails ( I think it was $8). If a 4 year old can eat it and enjoy it, so can you!

Also--the fried mushroom were perfect. Nice, crunchy and perfectly coated. You bite in, and the juiciness of the mushroom flows. Yumm with their aioli sauce. That was $8 I think. Make sure you share em. We did not finish the sea snails or fried mushrooms and there was 4 of us. 

Anyway, please, eat their whole booom booom bang sauce for me. Enjoy their crawfish. You get a bib, so dig in!!!

PS. Their service was amazing. Kind, fast, efficient, and checked in often!"

All they sell is crawfish and seafood.  The boom bang sauce consists of all of their different sauces mixed into one.  There is a ton of garlic and spice in this thick sauce; really tastes like lobster sauce that the Chinese use for their wok dishes. This sauce, if you must eat crawfish, should be your choice.  The other sauces aren&#39;t ALL that.

Here is the only place I know in Seattle that serves sea snails.  Take the provided toothpick(s) to extract the meat and dip it into required &#34;damn good&#34; ginger fish sauce.  I like the boiled peel and eat large shrimp with cocktail sauce.

All the fried seafood baskets work well.  The softshell crab and the oysters basket choices hit the spot, with fries that aren&#39;t too oily.

I just have to mention that one time a cutie pie that looks like an Asian double of a Jennifer Love Hewitt was our server.  A bonus also, football is usually on TV and their happy hour prices make my choices quick and easy."

This place is messier, the cost is comparable, but you actually get juicy, large pieces of seafood. I went here during my birthday weekend with a bunch of friends so I was able to sample more of their seafood wares. 

In the couple times I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve had:

- Dungeness crab (must have, because obviously)
- Blue prawns (the giant heads are so tasty and creamy!)
- Gulf shrimp (HUGE)
- Mussels (ALSO HUGE. If you are choosing between clams and mussels, get the mussels)
- Crawfish (ironically, this is the least interesting to me considering the restaurant namesake)
- Clams (pretty good, but a lot of them fell out of their shells so some got lost in the goop of a sauce)

Sauce Advice: Whole Boom Bang Sauce at Level 3 has just the right amount of spice without overwhelming the seafood taste (and I am someone who enjoys spice so YMMV). However, you get the bag of seafood piping hot so BE CAREFUL and/or wait a few moments for your food to cool before cracking/diving in.

Reservation advice: they don&#39;t take reservations for under 6 people and they automatically add 18% to the bill if your party is 8 or more. They also add a $0.50 per extra card charge if you&#39;re splitting the bill--splitting ONE bill, as they cannot provide separate checks--which is why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5. Kinda fiddly.

This little seafood place is tucked in an unassuming strip mall in Othello, but it&#39;s so much fun eating with your hands with friends. Go, and then grab a bubble milk tea at Ambrosia across the parking lot."

They were out. So we opted for white rice. 2.00 for a tiny bowl. There was four of us and they don&#39;t offer anything than individual price. Seems a little steep. We decided on the clams, crawfish, shrimp and crab. Super delicious! The whole boom bang is crazy good! They could work on their customer service and maybe quiet it down when they yell in the back they&#39;re not going to split the bill, we can do it they say. We brought cash the second time we went. 

2nd time around the lady was suppppper nice and attentive. I think she remembered us for some reason. The place was busy so they hurried to clean off a table for us. Again wanted to try the boom bang rice. Out again! In fact out of rice all together. How can you be out of rice?! It was  8 ish when we got there but they close at 10 that night. So we went and bought some rice at a restaurant next door. They didn&#39;t like that much because they came over and stated we aren&#39;t allowed to bring in outside food but they&#39;ll allow it since they were out. We all had shrimp this time and it was amazing. Tried the fries this time around it I&#39;d highly recommend them! We were going on a Wednesday night thinking that their special was 1.00 off market price off anything but the menu online shows only a picture of a crab. Would be better if it was a little more clear on that its strictly just the crab.  I&#39;m only taking one star away for their poor customer service the first time and no boom bang rice both times!"

Overall food was good. Sauce was very spicy and garlicky. Garlic in boom bang sauce will help keep vampires at bay for many days. Seafood tasted good but masked in heavy garlic sauce.

Arrival- Came at 6:30 on a Wednesday after work and there was only a couple people. By the time we finished ordering, there was 5 more parties that came in! The whole parking lot was packed when we left at 7:00. They have about 8 diagonal parking spots right in front of the restaurant off Greenwood for easy access. Inside, the restaurant holds 8 tables- bar top plus a private dining area in the corner. 

Food- Ordered the Pork &amp; Chive Dumplings (15 count, boiled, steamed) $8.99, Chive &amp; Scallops Dumplings (15 count, pan-fried pot stickers) $13.99 and the Handmade noodles in spicy sauce $8.99. Our bill was $32 for all that food! We were stuffed and it was only my bf and I. This beats Din Tai Fung by flying colors with affordability. 

Quality- The pork and chive dumplings were fairly juicy although a bit chewy after it cooled down. Chive and scallops pan fried potstickers came out fresh and stuck to a huge wonton wrapper to keep from sitting to the pan I believe. It had a nice crunch to it. The handmade noodles were delicious! It had a spice to it that didn&#39;t take away from the garlic, onions and seasoning it was tossed in. The noodles were thick and extremely long. It was sort of hard to eat with those metal chopsticks and we didn&#39;t have extra plates to share the huge plate of noodles. It also came out somewhat cold/warm and not hot which knocked a star down for me. Other than that, you can eat your dumplings some of the sauces provided at the table. I combined the soy sauce, spicy chili oil and vinegar together on a plate (dim sum style). 

Service- Fast and very polite. Immediately upon sitting down our waiter asked if we&#39;d prefer water or hot tea (complimentary). He also brought back dinnerware and silverware as soon as he came back with the pot of tea. Food was delivered in a timely manner, so was the bill that was handed to us at the right time without asking. Upon returning with the receipt, he asked if everything was to our liking. Of which, there wasn&#39;t much I can say other than it was a pleasant dinner. Will surely be back!"

The pan fried dumplings are my favorite. You get a lot of dumplings for a great price. My second favorite would be the spicy hand shaved noodles. It&#39;s a very simple dish with great flavors. I would skip the green onion pancake. Not worth it and it was a bit pricey for an appetizer. 

Service is here is pretty good until it gets busy. You may be neglected after all your food is delivered to your table. So if you want your check you&#39;re better off walking to the cash register because no one is going to come to your table.

No. But, in this area of hell, options are limited and this is pretty good when you take that into consideration. 

It has one of the oddest interiors. That bar to the right, is not a bar. Was it once a sushi joint? How far have they reversed engineered those alien ships stored in Nevada? Is the world really, flat? Was my father, my real father? Sometimes, you don&#39;t really need to know, you know? 

We were a large group, so they sat us in that little room to the left. Yes, that is a random fridge in there. Don&#39;t look in it. I repeat, DO NOT open that door. Bask in the glory of that lazy Susan that&#39;s on the table. I love lazy susans. I really need to get one of those. 

I took some horrible pics of what we ordered, but each and everyone was worth it. We had several of their dumplings from pork to beef to veggie and were all good. By that, I mean not too doughy or thick and with very well seasoned fillers. The hand made noodles (i&#39;m not a big noodle guy, unless it&#39;s swimming in a broth) in spicy sauce was aight. What was really good? 

&#34;How much for just one rib? Not one rack, just one rib and do you have change for a hundred?&#34; The lamb rib (single) is a bit much, but man, did I get a foodboner eating it. It&#39;s spiced almost too heavily with cumin, which you wouldn&#39;t think was a Chinese thing until you remember how big China really is and the countries that border it. It&#39;s a Northeast China dish, from what I remember. You need to get this on your tongue and down your throat ASAP, Gagina. And you will want more then one. Trust. .

The onion pancakes. These were reDONKulous. GET. IT. IN.

Worst Ting about this joint? No beer or alcohol and they won&#39;t let you bring in...I know.

If that is what you&#39;re looking for, then you must try Little Tings.

Pork &amp; Chive Dumplings (Steamed) were juicy and flavorful. Had the pan fried Carrot &amp; Tofu Buns and these were BOMB.com! They were not overly oily and had a lot of flavor and a great crisp.  Dont expect a true &#34;bun&#34; but rather a big, plump fried potsticker. 

The MUST order was the Handmade Noodles with Spicy sauce. The noodles are like Papardelle pasta but are thicker and wider. The sauce is super flavorful, a little sweet, salty and spicy. It&#39;s a pretty complex explosion in your mouth. 

Service was great. The waiter was a younger Chinese guy and he was very friendly, nice and described each dish very well.  

Also, their dumplings are handmade and made to order. (You can see the lady making the dumplings behind the counter) So, don&#39;t expect the dumplings to come out super fast. Definitely well worth the wait though. I would highly recommend checking this place out if you appreciate authentic Northern Chinese Dumplings."

For $13 + tip we both left stuffed and felt we had gotten our money&#39;s worth. 

While the food was good the restaurant lacks any atmosphere and it is so cold you feel you are sitting in a refrigerator (so bring a coat). The service was slow and dishes came out at different times as opposed to all at once, but you can tell it&#39;s a family owned place so I was perfectly happy cutting them some slack in that department. Overall the food outweighed the lack of decor and long wait for our dishes. We will definitely be back!

Great and funny server which is good! :) 

Foooood is amazing! Idk if it is tradition Chinese food for Chinese, but definitely good and very affordable. 
Okay we had few dishes there and it&#39;s good, here&#39;s the details of each dish: 

Dumplings (15 dumplings each plate): we ordered both regular and pan-fried dumplings. Both tasted good with great ingredients! You can tell they make it themselves in the restaurant fresh. Somehow, the simplest the best! We had the pan-fried first and we liked it, but the boiled plain regular dumplings are surprisingly better! Very juicy and very fresh. 

Egg pancake (I forgot the real name of it): my husband loves that the best! It&#39;s well cooked with egg inside the pancake. Not so special for me (As an Asian) but very interesting and good dish for sure! 

Little shrimps buns (6 pieces): I don&#39;t get how a bun got the same skin as the dumplings but just a little thicker. But anyhow it&#39;s really juicy and tasty. I might get a little disappointed that I thought it would be something like a Hong Kong style BBQ bun &#34;bun&#34;? And wish it could be a bit bigger. But still, very tasty and I&#39;d probably order it again! 

Tofu salad: well, that&#39;s something a little too special for me. It&#39;s like rubberbands with spicy sauce... However my friends liked it and i guess I prefer soft tofu more. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it and I would get the spicy noodles instead. (I guess the spicy flavor would be similar?) 

Price is pretty nice. Only about $8 each for 5 people. But ofcourse if you eat a lot then it&#39;s gonna be much more. Cause we didn&#39;t want to eat too much for dessert later on that night! :P 
Go try if you love dumplings!"

Not exactly what I was looking for but I had high hopes after reading reviews. There is just about 0 parking but we showed up for a late lunch so the place was not packed. 

Pan Fried Pork Buns: If I was rating solely on this one dish, 5 stars! These were so tasty and flavorful. I ate one after the other in the car on my drive home. I was super impressed and was excited to try the other dishes. 

Scallop and chive dumpling, boiled: Scallops are a favorite of mine so I was excited to see them on the menu. However, there is some dry, rubbery thing in the dumpling as well that just ruined it for me. If it had been only scallop and chive, I would have been happy but they obviously use whatever this is as a filler and I found it extremely off putting. Nice dumpling wrapper though, seems hand done, nice and soft. 

Noodles with spicy sauce: I purchased these after some rave reviews on here. They were so hot I could not eat them. Neither could my brother or Dad who love spicy things. It seemed like they left out something? It seemed like pure chili, no sauce. We ended up trashing the whole container because no one could handle how hot it was. 

I&#39;d come back just for the Pork Buns but I&#39;m not sure I would try anything else on the menu after this experience. I don&#39;t live close so I probably won&#39;t be back."

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place since they opened. When we drove by and spied an open parking spot, we made the quick decision that dumplings were in order for dinner!

The server greeted us warmly and motioned for us to take a table. We switched to one closer to the wall, under artwork of an adorable large-mouthed creature eating a dumpling. Our server overheard us talking about the art and said that one specifically was E.T., which made us laugh. He brought us hot tea, iced water, and menus quickly.

The menu is a single sheet so it won&#39;t take long to decide what you&#39;re having. We chose an order of the pan-fried chive buns (8), steamed pork and chive dumplings (15), and an order of the wok-cooked spare ribs. I wanted to try their spiced tofu salad but they were out so I settled on the hot and sour cucumbers. 

The table and condiments caddy were both clean. Our server pointed out the pepper flakes and their homemade garlic soy sauce for combining and dipping. We mixed our saucers and waited for the food. The cucumbers arrived first. They were on the softer side, and not really hot or spicy. I&#39;d skip these unless you want a palate cleanser between dumpling courses. 

The next to arrive were the steamed dumplings. We liked these and enjoyed the flavour of the pork and veg filling. Dipping them in peppery soy sauce enhanced the taste because otherwise, they&#39;d be a little on the bland side. The wok-cooked spare ribs were uniquely plated, dumpling wrappers like flower petals with the beef in the centre. This was the favourite but not enough beef for three people. The buns arrived last and I was the only one who loved these. My dining companions felt they had a fishy (scallops?) aftertaste.

Overall I have had better dumplings and if I were craving some, I&#39;d hit up Fu Man instead. Little Ting&#39;s just doesn&#39;t warrant the cost for us."

The second time we had pork and chive dumplings, both steamed and as pot stickers - it was amazing how different they tasted. 

I know they were fresh because you can see the person making the dumplings behind a counter in the dining room. The owner helped us and he was adorable.

I have no idea if they are authentic or not, I don&#39;t care. Better than Fu Man in my book - they taste fresher and not such strong garlic flavor. 

Maybe I&#39;m not that picky - I&#39;m just happy to have another good place to put on our regular north end rotation. Welcome to the neighborhood!"

Completely ignored, had to finally get up and request service. We watched many others who came in after us get served. I sincerely hope it wasn&#39;t because we were the only non-orientalis in the place at that time.....?
The tofu salad was bad spaghetti, couldn&#39;t eat it.
We ordered ribs that never came
The dumplings had some phlegmy goo on them - I&#39;ve had much better out of a bag from Costco. Chicken soup with noodles had a chicken leg bone with almost all the meat cut off from it.
After paying the bill, another waiter mistakenly thought our tip was to pay the bill, and yelled at us. Everyone in the place turned to look.

But please do not mix that with being delicious.  Yes people it&#39;s true that there are places in China that serve food that doesn&#39;t taste good. Authentic, but not tasty. This place is exactly that. 

 Everything is made with traditional ingredients and in the most traditional way.  However nothing tastes great and the prices are pretty high for what you get.  The spicy noodles were depicted as &#34;凉皮&#34; in another reviewers pictures and I want you to know that it is not that.  It is not a vinegar based dish.  It has curry powder and chili oil.  This is  northern dish and not the 凉皮.  The noodles are hand made,  chewy and delicious but the dish was over oily and bland.  The pots tickers and dumplings were ok.

The dumplings at Little Ting&#39;s are just as delicious (presentation is not as fancy, but who cares), at a fraction of the cost, and without the huge crowds you find at DTF. The pork and chive dumplings are THE BEST, very close to what I remember loving in Taipei. The handmade noodles in spicy sauce are also very tasty. The onion pancake is delicious, slightly salty and crispy yumminess. AND you can get their dumplings frozen, to go and stash in your freezer on those nights you don&#39;t want to cook and you don&#39;t want to go out.

Spicy Noodles- had cinnamon? which was very weird. Undercooked, had flavor but not a good one. WAY too much chili flake. Grated raw zucchini on top, Why?? and it added nothing to the overall dish and I can still taste it. 

Baby shrimp pan fried buns-  another weird item. I have nothing much to say about this because I took one bite and didn&#39;t want to take another. Way too much dried shrimp in it and that&#39;s all it tasted like.

Pan fried and boiled pork/Chive- this was the only thing that was tasty but the dough on most of them was undercooked. 

Scallion Pancake- rolled out very sloppy with edges detached but still served, undercooked, almost on the sweet side. Had szechuan pepper and that did nothing for it.  This should not have been served for a customer to pay for. 

We eat out quite a bit and haven&#39;t had a bad meal like this in a very long time. We go to Fu Man, Thai Siam, Bahn Town, Pop Pop Thai Street Food, Kritikka Thai, and everything like such as. We also are good cooks, professionally and at home. This was a HUGE disappointment."

We ordered the Pan fried Pork Buns, Dumplings with chives and just the plain pork dumplings. I would recommend the pan fried ones even though they&#39;re 1$ more, totally worth it. It seals the juice in the dumplings better. The boiled ones a couple of the wrapping broke so the natural juices of the dumplings came out. 

The pan fried pork buns were OK.........a little greasy and not as juicy as some of the ones I&#39;ve had in the past ( DOUGH ZONE in bellevue has the BEST pan fried pork buns)

Husband and wife team, Jason &amp; Ting (yep, the namesake, &#34;Little Ting&#34;) bring the traditional &#39;fast food&#39; of Hubei province (where Jason&#39;s family has run restaurants for years) to Seattle, in a clean comfortable setting. The expanding menu (they wanted to start simple and broaden from there) now offers a wide range of the wonderful doughy dumplings of their home, but also now traditional Hubei style noodles (very similar to Biang or Xi&#39;an style noodles).

And while there were reports earlier of slow service, this seems to be a thing of the past.  During lunch today I was seated immediately.  And after a nice, informative chat with Ting (who is always willing - indeed eager - to discuss and offer suggestions) had my order in, to be served less than 5 minutes later an amazing bowl of pork and cabbage dumplings (a Hubei classic) in a rich beef rib and seaweed soup, perfectly accompanied by traditional black Shanxi Chinese vinegar and house made soy and garlic dipping sauce.

Great prices, generous portions, and now they even offer frozen dumplings to go (for $30/100 dumplings! and can mix and match), make this a true North Seattle/Greenwood treasure."

Both were incredibly flavorful and came as orders of 15 pieces each.

Each table has its own house-made chili sauce and soy sauce, which mix beautifully together and made the dumplings&#39; flavors jump out even more.

And yes, the review went up from an original one to a well deserved five stars.

I did get contacted by the owner shortly after my original review to get the 411 on why it was closed back on 12/20/14. Fair enough. I figured an accurate assessment could only be given by this second visit.  

We&#39;ve only had dumplings at Judy Fu&#39;s, Fu Man, Din Tai Fung (both Bellevue and UVillage locations), Dumpling Generation, and a handful of dim sum and Tibetan places for comparison. 

We were greeted warmly by the hard working host/waitperson/busser. Turns out this place just officially opened on 12/23/14 and with a dining discount. The menu had a nice assortment of dumplings, appetizers, and a main spare rib entrée to choose from. 

We started with ice water and chamomile tea, which helped us post flu and cold folks calm our coughs. It was good to see that there were earlier business with at least up to three other tables occupied during our visit. Décor is spare with cute artwork to entice dumpling consumption. 

We tried two chilled appetizers: Sauced beef ($7.99) and Hot and Sour Cucumbers ($3.99). The beef is extremely lean and would have preferred a more crisp cucumber, but tasty as starters. Next time, I recommend just focusing on dumplings and the spare ribs.

The dumplings are cooked to order. I noticed that the wrappers are very delicate and thinner with very generous, tender, flavorful fillings. I was told that the chef has over two decades of culinary experience. 

We selected two different dumplings (15 pieces each): Pork and the other was Scallop and Chive ($8.79 - 9.89). Definitely hone in on one of the three condiments on the table - the freshly made garlic soy dipping sauce. One can customize the heat, if needed, with the chili pepper sauce. 

Upon recommendation, we also added the Griddle Cooked Spare Ribs ($11.99). This is a medium hot wok that is brought to the table and placed onto a stand - the dish is presented as a &#34;cover&#34; of dumpling wrappers and underneath are the tender beef spare ribs in a savory broth (star anise? Chinese five spice?) and what I thought were banana blossoms. 

Time will tell how they fare as they are the third business at this site since 2002. Plus being in such close proximity to Fu Man diagonally across Greenwood Ave N is also making a statement.  

I was later surprised at the generous 50% dining discount given (I thought I heard 15% with my congestion) for its grand opening. However, I would have gladly paid full price for the quality of service and food provided. 

Another welcomed North Seattle/Shoreline restaurant - check it out, especially if you enjoy dumplings!"

We had take out last week for 7 of us. I am sorry to report that there was not one dish that had passable food. It was the worst that I have had in quite a few years. The wonton soup was horrible. The scallion  pancake was doughy and cold. The spare ribs, the beef, the shrimp dish and the noodles turned to be of equal edibility. AND the dumplings were wrapped in dough that was too thick and they did not have  any punch to them.

Nice people; very accomodating, but if you are looking for a good meal, you might check elsewhere."

The only thing we all liked was the wonton soup but the wontons were mushy. I understand it&#39;s a dumpling place, but there are almost no vegetables on the menu and no rice!

Pros:  Hands down probably the best pan fried dumpling I ever had, the homemade skin had a great crunchy but chewy texture  with the pork cabbage had excellent flavor.   The green onion pancake was also cooked very well.  We also enjoyed the griddle rib, tasty flavor.  Owners were also friendly and told us about the culture of every dish.

Cons:  The place shares a small parking lot with another chinese parking lot in greenwood.

Not gonna lie my roommate makes way better food than they do! Dumplings are mix in with bad ground pork and lots of alcohol to try to cover the bad smell of the pork! The seaweed dish was purchase at Costco so nothing bad or nothing amazing. The noodle sauce was nah it&#39;s not good but compare to everything else i tried it&#39;s probably the best. There&#39;s a reason why most people come here are American cause Asians can tell the difference between authentic or not ! Please if you want to try authentic dumplings go to fu man across the street it&#39;s worth the wait you won&#39;t be sorry



Alright so I had terrible experience here yesterday then when me and my friends got home we had diarrhea!!!! I have very strong stomach so this mean their food has very high chance that&#39;s old !

Tonight we went again and it was much less crowded and food came out at a blistering pace. Owner said he added a bunch of staff in the back to help improve food delivery speed and it shows, while quality of the dumplings was still great.  Minor gripes about napkins not being available, but we just grabbed some off the bar and helped ourselves.

For the food - favorites are the pan fried pork and chive dumplings, regular pork, and the pork and celery. The pork and cabbage was a bit more bland than its brethren.  The pork buns are also great, not too doughy but with good amount of meat. 

Cucumber app is refreshing, spiced tofu was good but be aware it has the numbing Szechuan peppercorns used the flavor it, in case you don&#39;t like that.

Overall we&#39;re happy the speed of food service has picked up and we&#39;ll be back for more delicious dumplings! 

As an after thought, parking sucks in front but we usually just go to the next street south and grab a residential spot, no biggie."

Prices are reasonable and the home-made noodles are nice and chewy.  The house-made chili sauce has a hint of sweetness with garlic and is flavorful but not outrageously hot so you can enjoy lots of it over the noodles.  Just about everything we&#39;ve tried so far is amazing, though I would steer clear of the Griddle Chicken which is very hard to eat (chopped with the bones in) and not in the same league as the other offerings.

I had the CHIVE PORK DUMPLINGS - Pan Fried.  I mixed soy w/ chili paste and &#34;WOW!&#34;  I was happy. 

I think I am going to order a bunch of these dumpling and put them in the freezer so that I can have them any time I want!  

I view this place as a restaurant that people will eventually have to stand in line to experience.  Once the word gets out, people will just want to have from my point of view, the best PAN FRIED DUMPLING they ever had - over and over again.  Please keep in mind that I have been to China, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and Japan many many times.  I have had a few dumplings over the years and this approach just worked for me. 

Only thing missing is Beer, but I understand that this will change very soon.  The Dumpling House across the street tells me that Dumplings don&#39;t go with beer.  Sorry, I think they do! 

Of course, I&#39;ll be back to Little Ting&#39;s Dumplings."

Ordered the spiced tofu salad, spring rolls, pork and chive dumplings, pan fried egg chive and baby shrimp pancakes.  

Tofu salad was not a salad, it looked like thin noodles but made of tofu, flavor was not bad and good amount of heat but I couldn&#39;t finish it because I felt like my tongue was having an allergic reaction or something, and I&#39;m not allergic to anything! 
Spring rolls... EGG ROLLS, they&#39;re fried and delicious.  Pork and chive dumplings are good, nothing special though.

I was extremely disappointed to find that there was no shrimp in my pan fried egg chive and baby shrimp pancakes, I told the server and she sent over someone else to explain to us that they changed the recipe because the shrimp that would&#39;ve been inside were a little spicy and people couldn&#39;t handle it. Then she said if we wanted the shrimp, there&#39;s a secret menu and we need to ask for it. BUT on the menu it clearly states that there&#39;s shrimp in it, which the original server who took our order confirmed.

After our meal was done, we waited a very long time for the check, so we stacked our plates to try to show that we were done and wanted to leave.. then we waited and waited.. WE WERE THE ONLY CUSTOMERS IN THERE! And paid full price for the shrimp we didn&#39;t eat. 

Overall, food is alright. Hated the service, took forever for a water refill too. I would stick to just the dumplings,  but even better is Fu Man Dumpling across the street! Hole in the wall restaurant but there&#39;s a reason they been there so long."

Ting&#39;s has a small and focused menu.  (Do what you do best right?)  They have 6 or so dumpling dishes and another 6 apps.  You can get the dumplings steamed or pan fried (pot stickers).  We got the celery and pork and chives and pork.  The skin was thin and chewy.  The filling was seasoned well and not too salty.  They have a nice dipping sauce and homemade chilli to go with it.

The service was quick.  The owner said that his family has been selling dumplings in China for 20 years. The dumplings are made fresh daily.

The place was pretty hard to find, since there is no clear sign on the road and their parking space is pretty intensive. But anyway, that&#39;s not important.

We arrived 12:30pm when it was still not that busy, so we even had a chance having a little chat with the owner. He is a really nice guy, and he admitted that they are working on some new dishes and hopefully we will see them on the menu in the future. Pretty exciting!

So, the food! For two girls, one soy bean rice soup, one sauced beef, one spiced tofu salad and one griddle cooked chicken were more than enough to feed us. Both of us decided that the spiced tofu salad is our favorite dish. Its dressing was so unbelievably authentic, with the sweetness and a little bit spicy mixed perfectly in it. The tofu was cut nicely and mixed nicely with the dressing. I really want that thing in my mouth every single day.

The griddle cooked chicken was above average. I really love the sauce, and the food itself was actually not that scary huge as the size of the pot. The sauced beef was nice too. But I am not a fan of sauced beef since I was little, so no comment.

We were quite disappointed to know that the spicy beef tendon was sold out, since there were huge groups of guests coming yesterday evening which they didn&#39;t expect. I guess it&#39;s the power of commercial. So they didn&#39;t have time to purchase new beef tendon. But I believe I will have it in the future, since I shall come back.

We were surprised that today there was only the owner serving all the tables (It got really busy at noon soon after we were seated). The owner didn&#39;t expect that the review we read would bring so many guests. I would love those people who gave out one or two stars review in the recent days kindly understand that it is a new business and they need time to get used to some special situations. It is quite hard to maintain an authentic Chinese restaurant in the US, since too many American tongues are so used to the flavor of &#34;American Chinese food&#34;, while the real Chinese food doesn&#39;t always please those tongues.

I took one star off just because of the most common drawback of the majority of Chinese restaurants: the environment. It was clean, but the light was kind of dim and there was a strange smell in the restaurant (I got that smell in ID as well). But besides that, it was a great experience eating here. I hope Little Ting&#39;s can get on track soon, and hope they work on customer experience better."

In my early twenties I lived in Beijing with a woman who was a master at dumplings. Although the dumplings at Little Tings are a little different, the same flavor notes hit my tastebuds.

The menu is small, and they don&#39;t need any more than what they have listed. Traditional dumpling choices and side dishes. Staples you find on any menu in China, that I can&#39;t wait to try. 

I was able to have a nice conversation with the owner and he explained to me the skin of the dumpling (preferences differ in different regions on the thickness) would be more of a northern style than the thinner skin some would expect from Din Tai Fung. (a Taiwanese establishment) The dumplings were true to his description and I was happy to share them with my (sometimes) skeptical boyfriend. He was also impressed. 


Overall, I am excited there is now an authentic dumpling house in the neighborhood and, selfishly, a reason for me to practice my Chinese. 

I will definitely be back."

I have had dumplings all over America and Asia. I love love love dumplings. I like them fried, boiled, steamed.....Chinese, Taiwanese, Russian, Polish.....you get the idea. 

So, back to the dumplings.....hands down amazing and so delicious. I really liked the pan fried pork/cabbage, pan fried pork/chives, steamed pork/chives, pan fried scallops/chives, pan fried chives bun, and sauced beef appetizer.  I&#39;ve never had dumplings pan-fried so well.....top notch.....like the best I&#39;ve had.  The dumpling skin isn&#39;t too thick and the dumplings are stuffed generously with fresh meat.  The dipping sauce was so good too. 

The portions were really generous. I will definitely be back and back with lots of friends.  I really hope this place makes it because the food is seriously outstanding.  You can tell that they pride themselves in the quality of the food they offer.  

I saw the bad reviews about the service. I can see why their service could use a little help. But, in my experience, they were trying so hard to give us good service.  But it was almost too attentive because they were hanging around too much.  Here&#39;s just a few small pointers:
  
1. I appreciate that they want to be available if I need anything, but it would be better if they came by after we receive the food and check on us and/or check on us after 5-10 minutes or so. I felt bad that they were just hanging around in case we needed them. 
2. Put a little bell on the door. So it jingles and lets you know someone has arrived.  This will also alert you to greet customers.  
3.  Make sure all the sauce containers and napkins are fully stocked. Makes the eating experience go a lot smoother.  And make sure tea cups and waters are always full. 
4.  The music was a bit too loud. I could barely hear what our table was saying. 
5.  I know they just opened. But they should take some time to see how other successful restaurants are run. How does the front lobby look like? How do the servers/waitress&#39;s/waiters work?  How are customers greeted/treated.  Take some notes and implement into your restaurant.  Check out restaurants on their busy nights. 

Good luck Little Tings Dumpling.  You have the hardest part figured out.....quality good food.  Now....show us how you can grow.  I hope people really get a chance to enjoy the food here. The parking is tough but there is parking next door or street parking."
little-tings-dumplings-seattle,Hanh P.,L1dt2ts3wHmEhhQ5clIupw,"Seattle, WA",0,1,0,38,33,tOIPz2uT_jpP_gN9JrbBdA,1.0,2015-02-06,"I love dumplings and have eaten dumplings all over Seattle and even in Taiwan. So when I heard there was a new dumpling place, I jumped on the opportunity to check it out and was excited for some new deliciousness. I wish I could take back that hour plus of my life which resulted in me having to go home and eat leftover pizza. Yes, the dumplings are good but are they anything to write home about? Meh, not really.

Dining out is about more than just how tasty the food is right? So, one star because the few dumplings I ate were good and because Yelp requires me to give at least one star. All of these 5 star reviews must have been from slow days or early on when there were few customers because this place was so new. When it takes 30 minutes to get 2 of 4 items ordered and then nearly an hour later you still haven&#39;t gotten the rest of your food, you need to recheck your ability to run a business. And no, we were not the only ones frustrated with this over the top wait time, there were several tables around us that had also been there just as long as we were who were still waiting for food. 

Little Ting&#39;s would have gotten a second star out of sympathy for being a new business still trying to get the hang of things, but the end of our evening there was too ridiculous for words and makes me question the integrity of the business owners (who i hear are nice guys--nice isn&#39;t enough). What happened? We went up to pay our bill because we were done waiting for the rest of our order and wanted to get our kid home for bed. The guy told us &#34;oh the food will be coming in two minutes&#34; (which i highly doubt would have happened) and then proceeded to tell us that they were busy and didn&#39;t have enough help in the back. The restaurant was NOT super packed and as the customer it is not MY problem that you can&#39;t figure out your own staffing and can&#39;t run your business efficiently, new or not. What takes the cake though? They didn&#39;t bother addressing the fact that the items were never received. WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS DOESN&#39;T OFFER A DISCOUNT RECOGNIZING THEIR OWN POOR SERVICE? Sorry guys, not a way to attract customers and not away to retain customers. Service recovery is something you might want to think about.

Unless you have lots of time on your hands and aren&#39;t hungry and don&#39;t care if you have to wait an hour between plates of food, I would advise you to go elsewhere. There&#39;s a GREAT dumpling place across the street called Fu Man&#39;s Dumpling where they have excellent food and excellent customer service. Sorry, I want to support a new small business, but not one that can&#39;t even figure out the basics of running a business and providing proper customer service."

They know how to create great dishes but unfortunately do not know how to run an efficient business. We ordered two orders of dumplings short ribs and the tofu dish. Waited almost 30 min for the first dish. And almost an hour later and our remaining dishes hadn&#39;t come out. People around us were also expressing being upset. It being almost 830 we decided to leave. A good restaurant keeps patrons in the loop so they know when the food is coming out so they don&#39;t feel forgotten. May give them another chance to see if they figure things out but not rushing to come back.

By the time we got there, I was really...really hungry. We each put down 15 dumplings. They were delicious. We were going to order an appetizer to split (assuming that we would probably take dumplings home for lunch tomorrow). However, the waitress told us &#34;No. It would be too much food. You can have it next time.&#34; I think this place has a lot of potential. The dumplings were good and the space itself could be really nice but you&#39;re not going to get too far if you tell people they can&#39;t order more food. Besides, the more people order, the more your tip is! You like money, don&#39;t you? I work in the food industry too. Honesty is a great thing. You can definitely tell people &#34;Hey, 30 dumplings is a lot of dumplings for two people. Maybe you want to start with an appetizer and an order of 15, I can always send you home with 15 if you&#39;re not full afterwards.&#34; ...but don&#39;t tell them &#34;no&#34;!

They do have some gf and vegan baked goods but it didn&#39;t look like any gf tortillas for the burritos. I got some bread (banana something... I think blueberry) and a chocolate cookie. The cookie wasn&#39;t that good and I ended up not finishing it. The bread was really good though and it made a nice snack later.

The menu consists of burritos, bagels, sandwiches, and a few specials. All items are served all day. It is very accommodating to different diets - carnivores, vegetarians, and vegans can all eat here in harmony.

I tried the Bang Bang burrito - scrambled eggs, pinto beans (they are vegetarian) and home fries all wrapped up and smothered in green and red hatch chile sauce. The chile sauces were the star here. Both had great flavor and were about medium spicy (some bites of the green were a bit spicier since there are chunks of hatch chiles). None of the burrito fillings stood out individually, but they worked together really well. Savory and satisfying. My only critique is the home fries were soggy. Wish they crisped them up more. 

While tasty, it is sort of expensive for what it is - the Bang Bang is now $8.25 plus tax (prices raised since the photo taken in 2014). I tried to snap a clear picture since the photo on their website is also inaccurate (from 2015). Prices seem to go up around $1 each year."

Bang Bang Cafe feels like a coffee shop that&#39;s trying to be a restaurant and I&#39;m not entirely on board. Since when did burritos and coffee go together? And if a burrito is the signature menu item, why the sloppy blandness? My frittata special wasn&#39;t that much better, &#34;previously frozen leftovers&#34; felt like a more appropriate name because the egg was soggy and the sausages were flavorless chunks. Highlights of my meal included the side of potatoes and my caramel coffee, which was beautifully presented and not offensively sweet.

My sister had their vegan chick&#39;n breakfast burrito and it was really good. I felt like the sauce they out on the burrito didn&#39;t add any flavor but the hot sauces did. The variety of hot sauces is pretty awesome too I think they had 4 sauces.

Really great textures, balanced and yummy flavors. Perfect temperature throughout, perfect dry/moisture level throughout. All-in-all a hands down winner in the burrito world.

Unfortunately, I had an average and unsatisfactory time at the place, despite all the raving reviews. I came to the restaurant expecting a good meal but towards the end of my meal, I felt queasy and a little disgusted.

 The service was nice, but the food wasn&#39;t so much. I actually really wanted to like the food and support it, but in the end,I felt disappointed. I love supporting vegan restaurants and I always love going to them, but I wouldn&#39;t come back.

I ordered a vegan mac and cheese bc I wanted to try more plant-based mac&amp; cheeses. It came with a small bowl of salad and strawberry vinaigrette. I got the impression it was a very &#39;home-styled&#39; place and I liked the interior of the restaurant.
When the dish came out, it looked pretty good, but to my horror, while I was digging into my salad, I KID YOU NOT, a BUG CRAWLED out of the salad. I mean, I guess it should be good bc it means the food isn&#39;t heavily processed or something, but I immediately lost my appetite.  I never experienced this before and I didn&#39;t  know what to do in that situation, andI guess experienced people probably would&#39;ve told the waitress about it and gotten a refund, but I didn&#39;t even think of telling her at the time. 
If a restaurant is too lazy to wash their vegetables, then I think there could be a health risk and a bigger problem at hand.
However, the mac and cheese was also disappointing, surprisingly for a totally different reason, because it tasted EXACTLY like one of my all-time favorite mac and cheese recipes I made. I&#39;m not sure if they copied the recipe from online and that there are too few alternative recipes to plant based mac &amp; cheeses, but because I always used that recipe to make mac&amp;cheese, the taste wasn&#39;t special and made me less than excited to finish the food. 
Here&#39;s the recipe for anybody interested: http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=40&amp;catId=10
I ended up not finishing the bowl because it was so fattening, with the cashews and the  saltiness. But I did try 

Overall, I probably wouldn&#39;t come here again, but if I were to redo that meal, I would&#39;ve asked for a refund for the food and tell them about the bug."

I am vegan and I could make a burrito 10 times better than this one. All I could taste was cheap hot sauce and I am very tolerant to spiciness, but this burrito had no flavor besides spice.

I had the daily special, a croissant sandwich of scrambled eggs, sausage, fresh spinach, and melted Swiss with a side of rosemary potatoes. The croissant was perfectly flaky, the sausage was nicely seasoned and hearty, and the potatoes rival the best rosemary potatoes anywhere. My husband got the bang bang burrito and he commented that it was one of the best burritos he had ever had, a stark claim for a guy from South Texas. The two chile sauces were great, good spicy level but also more complex than just hot. Highly recommended."

When I lived in Seattle a few years ago I remember this place being a hot spot downtown so I decided to check it out this weekend.  The staff was all nice enough (but not exactly friendly) when I ordered a breakfast burrito and drip coffee and sat down to wait for my meal.  

When my burrito arrived and my coffee hadn&#39;t I asked the cashier and she THEN informed me that coffee was self serve and refills are extra.  I don&#39;t know about you but when I pay $2.75 for a cup of coffee I at least want a refill or some pleasant service with it.  

Upon arrival my burrito looked pretty wimpy but I tried not to judge a book by its cover.  However when I got all the way through it and realized it was mostly potatoes with a meager portion of eggs I really was disappointed. 

I expected more from you Bang Bang.  There&#39;s plenty of great places to eat downtown, don&#39;t waste your time here."

So, that was disappointing.

BUT the burritos are so, so good. The Red Chile Brisket Burrito had sour cream, spinach, potatoes and of course brisket wrapped in a nice soft tortilla (a bit chewy though, says the boyfriend) with red chile sauce poured over it.  Flavorful ingredients and at a very good cost (I think this was 8 bucks).

Orange juice here is fresh and ready to go.

I&#39;m not the most health conscious person out there, nor do I shy away from non-organic items, bang bang makes it easy to get superb, affordable food made with quality ingredients in a relaxed environment.
The location is very cool, you can walk there from Belltown center and head over towards the water if you need a stroll before or during your work day. Inside, there are plenty of tables to use. I love it when a place has larger communal tables as well as the small private ones. So you can spread out and work on your design project, chat with friends, or bury yourself in a new book. 
The coffee is good to boot! I usually get an iced coffee with the Bang Bang burrito in the morning. Their green chili chicken burrito is also one of my faves. Even if you&#39;re not into spicy items, I&#39;d advise to try the chili hatch sauce and always keep all the toppings on their menu. I&#39;m a picky eater, but there&#39;s nothing overwhelming about the ingredients in these recipes, they are delightful and interested.
Basically, if Bang Bang is rolling it up, I&#39;m eating it, period. I&#39;d suggest you do the same!"

Neither were impressive...not even close. When I eat out I expect something better than I can make at home. The burrito was boring, and personally too spicy for me. The cookie was ok, but I don&#39;t like the chocolate cinnamon combo, so that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t like that. The place was clean and the cashier was nice. My eyes burned the entire 28 minutes I was waiting for my burrito...I think it was from the grill smoke in such a small place. Did you catch what I just said??? I waited 28 minutes for my burrito...my veggie burrito. No apologies were given for the wait. No explanation was given either. Awesome way to spend your lunch break. I was really hungry too. I guess it&#39;s a good thing I didn&#39;t like the taste, since I didn&#39;t have time to finish it anyway.
 
Thanks for having vegan options, but not sure I&#39;ll return. I can&#39;t wait that long for my food, and if I&#39;m eating out I expect better flavor. If I do give them another shot, I&#39;ll try their vegan mac. If the experience is the same as the first, that&#39;s it for me!

TL;GonnaReadAnyway:

It&#39;s high time I update my review from the time I tried it once a few years back. I now work in the area and actually pass by each morning between my parking deck and my office. As a consequence, because of the convenience, I have stopped in here more than a couple times in the past year or so.

I mainly still get the Bang Bang burrito, which is the burrito profiled in my initial review. I&#39;m more of a fan of it nowadays than I was back then. I think this is part me acknowledging that it&#39;s a reasonable burrito, and part me not having lived in New Mexico for coming up on a decade now. I&#39;ve visited the southwest recently enough to be reminded of the glory of a truly dazzling breakfast burrito, and a Bang Bang burrito does not quite measure up in this regard, but let&#39;s be real, this is not exactly a fair comparison, and you know this if you&#39;ve ever gone catatonic while cramming a Golden Pride or Twister&#39;s down your gullet. There be magic in those genuine southwest breakfast burritos. Still, when I&#39;ve stayed out a little too late the previous night, and can still taste it in my mouth, there&#39;s nothing like a Bang Bang burrito to try to put that behind me in a way that a bagel sandwich or pastry can not.

Also, I used to really enjoy the MBLT sandwich--a BLT made with Morningstar facon instead of regular bacon. It was a simple affair, but well-executed, and generous with the delicious, delicious facon. Unfortunately, Bang Bang pulled this from the menu some time ago, so now it lives only in my memory or in my kitchen, if I&#39;m feeling inspired. Between you and me, though, I haven&#39;t felt inspired yet, so really, it only lives in my memory.

You might be well served to call your order in ahead if time is a concern. Although the staff is friendly, tearing through orders at at frenetic pace is not how things work here. Sit down, read an article on your phone. Enjoy the whimsical battle cat artwork on the walls. Your burrito will be ready when it&#39;s ready.

You might have trouble finding a seat, though, if it&#39;s moderately busy. There are about five tables for two, window seating along the northern wall, and one table that can accommodate six to eight people, or a couple smaller groups who aren&#39;t afraid of sitting near strangers. There are outdoor two-tops for when the weather cooperates. The seating area and counter are always very clean; they do a good job of keeping an inviting space.

It&#39;s not exactly cheap, but most things at counter-service shops and food trucks seem to cost more than I feel like they &#34;should&#34; nowadays, so this isn&#39;t exactly shocking. It just means that&#39;s what things cost now. My typical order of a Bang Bang burrito and a tall almond milk latte comes out to $14 and change after tax and tip.

Bonus points for the place no longer smelling heavily of well-done fryer oil on the verge of its smoke point, and a bonus star for allowing me to bring my pup inside while I wait for take out, or when I dine in with coworkers, and having a jar of apparently-delicious MudBay treats that she loves to beg for while I wait for my food."

We had a pleasant exchange as he took my order. He had turned to work on another task while I was signing the receipt and basically forgot about our transaction. Seems his...*ahem* short term memory problems got the better of him. I wanted a receipt but I realized that might be a bit tough for him so I opted to simply leave the store copy on the counter and have a seat. 

On the plus side: he got distracted from our transaction because he moved on to helping orders get out, so I have no complaints about the initial impression,  he relied my order correctly so his overindulgence in his activities during lunch break were amusing. 

They have several veggie options which are simple yet delicious.  I really enjoyed my sandwich and saw many items that I would like to try. My first impression of Bang Bang was a good one and I&#39;m looking forward to trying them again!"

It&#39;s like writing poetry for someone you love, but the words you write cant invoke the depth of emotions you actually feel. That&#39;s what Bang Bang Café is to me.

No, it&#39;s not fancy. And no- there is no wait service. But please, PLEASE tip the friendly people behind the bar. They are amazingly nice and I want them to be in their jobs forever.

The space is pretty small. Lots of 2-top tables, and one 6-top table, plus some bar seating. I&#39;ve always found a seat here, and sometimes it&#39;s not even hard- but I don&#39;t recommend coming with a group bigger than 3 or 4 or you might have a wait.

Street parking is ok.

Ok- the food! The fooooooooood! Without fail, I order a vegan mac and cheese for the table. Everyone thanks me and eats it with pleasure. It&#39;s salty/savory/hearty happiness piled into a bowl. I&#39;m not even vegan OR vegetarian! I love it.
The second thing I get is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel with cheese and veggie sausage. They have morning star sausage here (for anyone who has had that, they know that it&#39;s the best ever)! I can also recommend the Bang Bang Burrito with an add-in of veggie sausage.

The coffee here is good. Nothing amazing, but nothing wrong with it either. The pastries are also good, but it&#39;s kind of a given that they&#39;re not as good as the hot food.

Moral of the story- don&#39;t come here with your dance troop to eat greasy hashbrowns/ to kill a hangover. It&#39;s not that kind of place. Come here for breakfast or brunch on your way to the Market or to bond over a quick meal with the person you love most in the world."

The first time they had staff training on the register, so service was a bit slow. The owner/manager, however, was super awesome about it. Once the rush died down, she came around making sure everyone was enjoying everything, explaining why there had been a delay, and giving everyone free drink coupons as a thank you/we&#39;re sorry. She also didn&#39;t charge me the $0.55 they typically charge for coffee refills, so that was nice of her, too.

There are quite a few options for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans alike. The owner is from New Mexico, hence the attention to red and green hatch chiles on the menu (although we thought that we should&#39;ve gotten a bit more of it for the $1.25 extra we had to pay). We tried a bagel breakfast sandwich, a couple of different burritos, and the vegan mac and cheese (it was AWESOME. *So* good. I have to figure out how to make it!) and were pleased with everything we tried. Coffee and cappuccinos were good, too.

Bang Bang Cafe had been on our bookmark list of places to check out while we were in Seattle and it didn&#39;t disappoint."

This place is vegan so I guess it&#39;s some sort of egg substitute? I don&#39;t know, it just wasn&#39;t great. The chai was just okay as well, no better than something I could make myself at home.

I try to look for places that cater to vegans (I am one) and meat eaters (boyfriend) and this place just knocked it out of the park!

The menu has a lot of vegan options.. not just one.. but a few and very delicious options there are!

I got the vegan breakfast burrito, Shawn&#39;s vegan mac and cheese, and a soy Mexican latte. It was amazing. The burrito wasn&#39;t just veggies, there was pinto beans, veggies, AND russet potatoes! NOM! So filling! The vegan mac is to die for! It kind of has a little smokey taste, but I LOVE it. I could not finish it (thanks, burrito) so I took it home in a box. Also, the mac is served with some toast and Earth Balance butter (tasty vegan friendly buttahhh).

There are several small tables along the windows facing Western - both inside and out - as well as high bar-type seating along the Wall Street windows.  There&#39;s also a big kitchen table that I like to sit at when I need to get a little work done.

I&#39;ve usually gone with one of the bagel sandwiches and a coffee (not a huge fan of the burritos).  Since it&#39;s terribly difficult to find an actually good bagel in the city, I&#39;m always pleasantly surprised and how the sandwich comes together.  There always just a little greasier than I expect (almost always a good thing) and have enough substance to tide me over to a late lunch.

I like the coffee enough that I actually buy my beans here now.  They sell (and presumably use) beans from Lighthouse Roasters.  They have several one-pound bags of the Roaster&#39;s Choice up at the counter.

There is plenty of seating indoors and out, which was great on a sunny Sunday afternoon.

The food service wasn&#39;t fast, which was pleasantly surprising - it&#39;s a small café, so one would think food wasn&#39;t made fresh.  My wife was a little surprised by her sandwich, the hummus panini - the last listed ingredient was field roast, which she missed.  She liked it, a lot in fact - in her words, it was a &#34;perfectly smashing sandwich&#34;.  My sandwich was the roast turkey panini, which used real roast turkey - not pressed turkey loaf, not deli turkey, but real roasted turkey sliced thin, and served on well panini-toasted bread.

The prices were a little high for two sandwiches and some drinks, but what we got was very good.  If we find ourselves downtown again, we&#39;l go out of our way to come back here and try something else."

I got the basic burrito (egg, cheese, potatoes) with jimmy dean sausage.

Not to be deterred by the not so great experience, I went back some weeks later and tried something else... another burrito - this time with turkey sausage.

We made a 6:30pm reservation on a Sunday since I had a Groupon. Finding street parking was fairly easy, and there was free parking on Sundays. 

The interior has a cozy, rustic Italian charm. I was getting really excited to try some delicious and authentic Italian food after seeing how cute the place looks!

The waiter brought over our menus, but gave me the bad news that the dish I wanted (Braciole Di Vitello) was out! I felt sad since my friend raved about that dish, but I decided to go with the Fettuccine Con Salsiccia per our waiter&#39;s recommendation. My boyfriend ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese. We also ordered the clams and mussels dish as an appetizer.

The bread that came with our meal wasn&#39;t spectacular. However, I did enjoy the clams and mussels appetizer. The sauce was delicious! 

When we received our entrees, we were both underwhelmed with the lack of flavor in both of our dishes. The Italian sausage that came with my dish tasted so bland, and even the sauce as well. My boyfriend said his bolognese did not have enough of a savory flavor to enjoy it. We were both pretty hungry and didn&#39;t want to say anything because we felt bad! Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, but I was disappointed in the food. The only thing I enjoyed was the clams and mussels appetizer.

In terms of cleanliness, I was surprised to find bits of leftover food stuck on one of our forks, which was a little gross. I don&#39;t feel like they take the time to check to see if the silverware is clean before serving them to customers, so that is something to consider.

We were absolutely pleased with the atmosphere, service, and of course, the food. 

The setting is rustic with a cozy family feel. They are kid-friendly as well although the tables may be a bit tight to accommodate a high chair. They have a small kids menu.

We ordered the Polpo Affogato Octopus appetizer- octopus braised in spicy tomato ragu ($12 I think), the Braciole Di Vitello Boneless leg of natural veal rolled with prosciutto, pancetta, mortadella, salami, egg and provolone cheese braised in tomato sauce with grilled veggies ($23).

The octopus dish had such a good sauce! 

We also got the seafood risotto with clams, mussels, and prawns ($21 I think).

The risotto was tasty and we enjoyed it but the real star was the veal dish. This dish along with the house-made, tender pasta was absolutely fantastic. We thought we would have leftovers as we ordered an appetizer and two entrees and dessert but we ate every last bite! 

We also shared a bottle of Syrah which was great. 

For dessert, we enjoyed the tiramisu ($8).

Mondello is a beautiful restaurant owned and ran by a lovely Sicilian family! The food is amazing comfort food, the staff are sweet and efficient, and the ambiance is perfect for date night or with the whole family. 

My man always gets the carbonara but I try to jump all over the menu so I can try all the beautiful dishes! I don&#39;t think you could be disappointed with anything you order here!"

The food was great! I finished my plate even though it was more than I could really eat. The salad was great. They brought warm bread to the table along with the wine we ordered and made a point of keeping both the wine glasses and the bread bowl full. The service was fantastic. Parking was street parking but was not a challenge. I will say that I thought the prices were a little high for what the food was but it seemed nice for a special night out. I&#39;d go back if I end up in Magnolia on a special occasion again."

Ok, how about the positive-the waitstaff was super friendly, very personable, and pretty efficient. The place was cute and cozy. We live in Magnolia, so we wanted to hopefully find a new haunt close to home.

That&#39;s where it ends my friends.

The food is SAD. Very SAD. I know, but it bears repeating.

We ordered the Gorgonzola gnocchi with walnuts. IF this sauce had ANY Gorgonzola in the whole batch, it was no more than the sad little piece you might find at the end of the cheese counter at Whole Foods. We&#39;ve had Gorgonzola sauces at many restaurants, and I can say for sure that this sauce should be simply referred to as a cream sauce, as to not disappoint prospective diners.
The Gnocchi itself reminded me of the lazy blister packs you can buy at World Market. Oh, and the Parmesan it was topped with tasted like the green can junk.

We figured we&#39;d try to end the night on a high note and ordered the $8.00 cannoli. That&#39;s about the going rate for good cannoli so we were hopeful...
Sadly, it sucked too. Hershey syrup over, half filled, but crispy (high note) shells. It was tiny and tasteless. 

We hate to give bad reviews. It&#39;s hard enough for restraints to make it under normal circumstances. But when your gonna charge so much for your food, at least make your customers not wish they&#39;d have gone home and opened a jar of sauce and eaten a pop tart for dessert. 
P.S. I hate pop tarts, and still...

*thanks for replying to my review. To answer your question,  yes, I did write the review the same day we dined. In fact it was right after we left. My fiancé and I were both very unhappy with the quality of food. As far as fixing a dish, maybe adding Gorgonzola to the gnocchi would be a great start. Plus, gnocchi should be a bit pillowy not chewy like it was made, dried, then re-boiled. It tasted like very low quality dry packaged pasta, that was covered in a thinned down jar of Alfredo."

The kiddo wanted Italian for dinner before heading north to Shoreline. So I started naming various places in downtown Seattle/Belltown - but he wanted to return to Mondello. 

So here&#39;s a Yelp post for a revisit nearly ten months later. Lucked out with parking and was able to be seated at a two top near the piano without having previous reservations. During this visit, the dining room filled up fairly quickly. 

The complimentary lightly toasted bread with the herbaceous olive oil was delicious. We decided to skip any apps, soup, or salad and focus on Mondello&#39;s delicious selections of entrees. 

Kiddo knew immediately to order the Spaghetti Carbonara ($16). He remembered it from last time and thought it was the best over Ristorante Piccolino&#39;s in Ballard. I&#39;ll have to try it next time and see how it stands up to Machiavelli&#39;s on Capitol Hill. He practically inhaled it, that our server stated &#39;he made good work&#39; of it noting the cleaned plate.

I was still deciding on what to order, but stopped once our server said one of the two dinner specials was Osso Bucco with Saffron Risotto ($32). It was a different execution that I was accustomed to - usually I&#39;m familiar with it being seared further and dark rich sauce. However, it was a very generous, tender shank. I took some of the herbaceous olive oil and drizzled it over the shank and added just a touch of table salt and it was perfect. Bonus - I was able to scoop out the bone marrow also.The risotto was cooked to toothy perfection and again a generous serving. Plentiful that even the kiddo ate several bites too. After such a long day on the road and being hungry like the kiddo, I, too, polished off that entire huge entrée. Just the cleaned shank bone was left. 

No surprise I did not have room for dessert, but the kiddo had two scoops of vanilla gelato del giorno ($9). 

Again, we left very satisfied and stuffed for the second time. It is understandable that Mondello is a well established and loved neighborhood Italian restaurant."

I have tried it four times. I have been disappointed each and every time!!! This last time, my husband and I went to Mondello&#39;s we both got pasta dishes. My husband ordered linguine with clams. While eating, my husband found a rock in his dish. Not a pebble, but a big, black rock. We were told that &#34;that&#39;s what happens when you order fresh food!&#34;
Not, a huge apology, not lets get you a new plate. Nothing. Just laughed it off.

I once praised the venue for its amazing pasta, but my last couple of visits left me underwhelmed. The noodles didn&#39;t have their characteristic thickness and spring that intoxicated me my first dozen times here.

There were some sins at my last dining experience here that really stuck with me. Aside from slow service (which I can live with, Italian restaurants are meant to be savored and enjoyed), the Gorgonzola Gnocchi arrived with shaved almonds on top instead of the staple of walnuts. It would be one thing if this dish was always made with walnuts, but the first six times my friends or myself have gotten this dish, it came with walnuts. For it to be quietly substituted with shaved almonds is upsetting because it changes the texture significantly. Combined with a slightly thinner sauce and smaller sized gnocchi, the whole dish felt cheaper.

Lastly, the tiramisu had frozen ladyfingers on the bottom."
mondello-ristorante-italiano-seattle-2,Karen D.,L6iw9ymuqsbZHDR2sNQvig,"Renton, WA",1,1,0,49,21,Bp4REcZFf7tKRD0ej3lUdw,5.0,2015-05-25,"I&#39;m Italian, and I have rarely (if ever) rated an Italian restaurant in the Seattle area 5 stars.  In fact, there are only a handful of Italian restaurants here that I frequent on a regular basis.  Mondello will definitely be one of them.

Mondello has it all:  Charm, great service, nice atmosphere, delicious food, reasonable prices.  The neighborhood is a bit out of the way for most folks, and also pretty ho-hum, but don&#39;t let that deter you.  Mondello is a gem.

The grilled bread was excellent, and I think they might have changed the way they do the bread since previous reviews, because our 2nd basket of bread was also grilled.  Delicious!  I had an excellent glass of Barbera.  I don&#39;t know much about wine, just what I like, and I would highly recommend the Barbera.  It&#39;s very balanced.  

We ordered the caprese salad appetizer, and while it was pretty much standard fare, it was presented in a particularly lovely way, scattered with little precious drops of aged balsamic.

I had the linguini with clams, which is what I always order the first time I&#39;m eating at an Italian place, if they have it on the menu.  I guess it is kind of my &#34;test&#34; dish, a barometer of the quality of the food.  Mondello passed with flying colors.  I have never had a dish of linguini and clams that contained such a generous amount of clams!  The linguini was cooked perfectly al dente.  Some folks have complained about the pasta here being hard and undercooked...maybe they just aren&#39;t used to pasta cooked perfectly in the Italian style.  It was a perfect dish of pasta.

My spouse ordered the rigatoni puttanesca, and that was also executed very well.  

One of my complaints about many Italian restaurants in the Seattle area is that the servings aren&#39;t big enough.  i can&#39;t count the number of times that I have eaten Italian, paid a ridiculous amount for a plate of pasta, and not been full afterward.  That is a crime!!  

Thank goodness Mondello isn&#39;t that way...  Yes, I have lived in Italy and I know that pasta is usually a primi there, and followed by a meat or fish course.  But here in America, many folks (myself included) just want a salad or appetizer, and one or the other, primi or secondi.  Mondello is set up that way, and I GREATLY appreciate it.  Grazie, Mondello!

As for dessert, I am not faulting Mondello for this, because it is nearly impossible to get the right type of ricotta here to make an authentic cannoli, but the cannoli was not that great.  No worries, no one here in Seattle makes a good cannoli.  I would definitely try their other desserts on a future visit, though. Also, the espresso was delicious, and a very authentic cup of coffee.  I ordered a double, because that is what I would order in other restaurants, because the standard is pretty small.  But the double here was quite large, and the same consistency as the coffee that is served in Italy...less strong, and not as viscous as the espresso one gets at local coffee shops 

All in all, a truly pleasurable dinner...we will be back!"

-Valentines Day menu was not posted on the website (if it was it was not obvious) so the menu was a surprise. Pretty standard italian fare not unlike their normal menu but for 2-3 times the cost. Basically the restaurant was skimming the valentines crowd.
-My date&#39;s meal was gnocchi with some type of sauce. It came out cold, honestly room temperature. Mine was piping hot. So they just left her dish out while finishing mine and nobody checked. If your going to scam me with absurd prices for basic pasta dishes on valentines day, at least get the ladies meal right! Capisce!
-My dish was pasta with meat ragu. A meatball, rib, and two sausage. Meatball was super bland and tasted like it was made from sponge cake. The rest of dish was good, but get this. The cook had left some of the pasta out of the water while boiling it and most of the pasta had a distinct hard end on one side. We are not talking about the finer points of al dente here! Thats why I gave this place a 2.
-Good wine, especially for the price. Whoever is doing the buying deserves a gold star."

Regardless, my wife and I had dinner here on Christmas Eve.  The good:  the service and ambiance.  The bad: almost everything else.

 We had been here once before and were pleased with it and many of our neighbors had recommend it since.  Things apparently have changed for the worse.

We had three dishes, of which only one was good, the octopus salad.  My wife&#39;s saltimboca was rubbery.  My Sicilian sausage soup was way too salty and my braciole was cold in the middle and covered with a out-of-the-jar type sauce.  Even the bread was disappointing!

OK, so why didn&#39;t we complain?  Clearly, the kitchen was in a state of disorder.  We are not usually hesitant to complain about poor food in a restaurant but this was Christmas Eve, there was too much to complain about and we wanted to make the evening as pleasant as possible for each other.

I&#39;m especially disappointed because this is one of only two upscale restaurants in Magnolia Village serving dinner."

Boyfriend and I came for a date night. I made a reservation on open table, mistakenly made two, and they cancelled one. When I got confused and told them I would call to clarify in the morning,  they personally called me the moment they opened to clear things up. I thought that was very nice of them. 

We were seated immediately, and the ambiance was cozy without being too dark (a pet peeve). The first basket of bread was only two pieces, but it was hot, grilled and so delicious. We ordered more bread because the first was so good, but the second basket was not the same delicious bread. Was a little sad about that.

We also ordered a Caesar salad, but the order was wrong and we got a spinach salad instead. We didn&#39;t mind that much because it was still good, and looked better than the Caesar at the other tables.

We got the sausage fettuccine and the gnocchi gorgonzola, and they were amazing. The fettuccine portion was enormous and the sausage was very flavorful and soft and went well with the pasta and sauce, which were both very fresh. The gnocchi had the best sauce either of us had tasted and we were very tempted to lick the plate. Only downside was that it was a small-ish portion. The walnuts were perfect in the gnocchi, and we wished there were as much gnocchi as the fettuccine (which was still great).

Ended with the cannoli, which was perfect. Incredible chocolate sauce and creamy, rich filling. It made me feel emotions.

Small staffing, very friendly, fairly quick and efficient service aside from the incorrect salad order (which turned out ok). Wish there could have been more of the grilled bread, and we didn&#39;t know that &#34;additional baskets of bread&#34; meant one basket. Very charming decor, not overdone or gaudy like some restaurants. Definitely a new favorite place, we loved it. So glad we tried it!"

Yes, the space is charming. And yes, Nona is lovely, but it&#39;s also awkward since you don&#39;t want to disappoint her by letting her know the food she&#39;s serving is actually really kind of gross.

Of the few dishes we shared, the things that kept popping up were:
-- in what year was this fresh?
-- how long ago was this first cooked before it ended up on my plate?
-- should I keep eating this?!
-- we should have ordered pasta!

Service was amateurish and immature. It was kind of goofy to watch a waitress bring a squeeze bottle of balsamic vinegar off the line to her table, then hover, saying they &#34;need it back in the kitchen&#34;...
We ended up taking almost everything on our plates to go, feigning fullness, and ditched the doggie bags on our way to another restaurant where we could actually  EAT dinner."

My wife had the Spaghetti Gamberoni. She found the shrimp to be overcooked, and there was too much lemon peel. We finished with a cannoli. Having recently visited Greenwich Village, it did not live up to hopes, but it was still decent. It was too creamy, and lacked sufficient ricotta cheese.

I frequent the businesses AROUND this restaurant, but never really noticed it.  It&#39;s very much a hole in the wall.

I just went there for the second time and confirmed it&#39;s one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the area, and probably the best one in Seattle period.  Everything is made from scratch, and their pasta is cooked to al dente perfection.

The waitstaff and everyone working in the restaurant has been extremely nice, very attentive, and made great recommendations.

I&#39;ve had the Caesar salad twice, and it&#39;s delicious.  You can tell that the dressing is made in house and it&#39;s got a great anchovy / egg flavor to it.  

As far as Entrees I&#39;ve ordered the Fettuccine con Salsiccia and the Spaghetti Carbonara.  The Fettuccine had great flavor in the marinara, but the sausage doesn&#39;t have as much kick as I like.  I&#39;d never had Spaghetti Carbonara before and I am a BELIEVER.  It was amazing, and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll even dare to stray to another dish.  I&#39;ve also sampled the Gnocchi Pomodoro and the Rockfish Linguine special, and they were both delicious as well.

Cannoli.  I have never had a cannoli that I enjoyed before.  Our waiter on the first visit recommended it, and he said unless you have someone from the right region of Italy making the cannoli it&#39;s no good, and he DID have someone who knew what they were doing.  He was not kidding.  Their cannoli is amazing, and one of the best desserts in town.

Overall the flavor of everything is amazing.  Some dishes need a bit of a kick, it tends to need a touch of salt, but besides that it is spot on.  The portion sizes are a little on the small side, but the taste more than makes up for it for me.  I&#39;ll be going here and recommending it from now on."

My boyfriend and I went on a whim as neither of us felt like cooking. Even on a random Wednesday night, this place was packed (always a good sign). The family was very warm and welcoming, and cleared us a spot on the bar where we ended up staying to eat because it was just too fun to be able to watch Mama cooking in the back. Everyone who works there, and even most of the patrons were extremely friendly which just made for a very fun experience. Aside from the ambiance and service, the food was exceptional. Like typical Sicilian cooking, the ingredients truly shine in each dish and the pasta was the perfect texture. We had the special, which was a fettucine ragu, and the rockfish linguine. Both were excellent. Such a pleasant surprise of a restaurant and made for a very unexpectedly fun evening! Will definitely be back."

We were craving Italian, and looking for something in Magnolia, since I&#39;ve just moved here.

The food here was awesome. We especially loved the first basket of bread, warm (grilled?) and delicious. Unfortunately, the second basket wasn&#39;t the same.

We enjoyed prosecco by the glass, with the caprese as our appetizer. I had the carbonara, which was FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC. Girlfriend had something with meat and red sauce, which was also really good.

Service was great, restaurant is cute, and we will definitely be back."

I love the cute family atmosphere and I love the look of the restaurant. They are all so nice and hospitable. The food is off the charts!!! It is worth it!

My Personal Restaurant Rating Key
One star: the food was bad and I had a negative experience. 

Two star: I had a more negative experience and would not come here again but the food was good so I may. 

Three store: Everything is good except one thing. Example-the food is good, the price is more reasonable but the atmosphere is lacking class. Or the food is good, the atmosphere is good, but they over charged us. These three stars are actually my favorite types of restaurants to go eat at if the reason is due to the atmosphere because they are usually delicious and reasonably priced.

Four stars: Everything is great, food and experience. However the price is definitely on the upper end. I would not recommend this first to Obama unless he didn&#39;t like my five stars. These are restaurants you can take your boss or your mother-in-laws to impress them, however they still don&#39;t fit into the five star category. A bit fancier than my three stars, hence I don&#39;t often eat here unless there is an occasion for it or there is a groupon that gives me a bit of a discount! 

Five stars: I would recommend this to Obama. The price may be on the upper end but the experience and the taste is so exquisite, it is actually worth every nickel and dime."

The hostess gave us a flustered look and said a table would open up &#34;soon.&#34; We had a babysitter for only a couple hours and didn&#39;t want to wait around. I would expect that if I had a reservation, I should be seated at the time of my reservation. I just cannot get passed this bad customer service experience to want to go back."

What got me is the food and lack of clean silverware. The forks and knives had spots all over it and was not very appetizing, a little rub on our napkins was all it took, but for a $17 dish is it too much to ask for to have wiped down silverware. All would have been forgiven however if the food tasted like what was boasted in the fare. We are both vegetarians and, as I say in all my reviews I can only review that food. We got the gnocchi with Gorgonzola and walnuts as it sounded good; when we got it we seen a few things missing like the Gorgonzola, if it was in the dish is was microscopic and the gnocchi was tasteless. The sauce was good, but not enough to justify the cost. The one free bread basket (a second cost $2 more, really?) was accompanied with olive oil with some spices which was both once again tasteless. We lastly tried the cannoli with a drizzle (no kidding) of Hersey&#39;s chocolate sauce. The cannoli it&#39;s self was ok, but my fiancée didn&#39;t have hardly any cream in the middle. The meal was around $55 bucks which I wouldn&#39;t have minded if they put a bit of thought into their food. We went on a Wednesday night and it was packed so reservations might be a good idea and I hope whoever doesn&#39;t heed my warning to stay away have a better experience than we did. : ("

Had the tiramisu for dessert, which was also excellent."

We ordered a wine on the menu but later was told they didn&#39;t have. The server brings over another bottle, starts opening without consulting us, telling us that it is more expensive and better than the wine we ordered but they&#39;ll give it to us for same price. Hmm my boyfriend has a wine bar back in LA and he just stayed quiet and later said it is not more expensive than the one we ordered after the server left. If the server asked us before just opening it, then we could&#39;ve considered but do not lie and then just open a bottle. 


Anyway for the food. One of the pasta noodles were so hard. Like inedible hard. We sent it back. They just seemed to have reboiled it making the pasta more watery than before. 
I took pictures but changed my phone. 

The server though, it seemed like he was giving us permission to order. He&#39;d come and take our drink order. Then he came to take our appetizer order only. 
Then maybe 30 minutes later he comes back and gives us permission to order our main dish. What&#39;s the point of all that time in between?"

We came here on a Sunday night.  The restaurant is laid-back, casual, and quiet.  The staff are friendly and unintrusive.  We started with the octopus appetizer in a spicy ragu, which was pretty good.  The ragu was very tomato-y, but saltier than I liked.

My husband had the veal meatballs with fettuccine and I had the linguini vongole.  Both of the pastas were homemade and cooked to a very toothsome al dente.  The portions were generously sized.  We kept remarking on how good the food was during our meal.

We had a square of tiramisu for dessert.  It was acceptable but will be skipped next time."

My sisters and I all tried a little bit of eachothers food, and it was all incredible. The fettuccini alfredo, the ravioli, lasagna, even the kids macaroni was FANTASTIC.

Loved the rustic Italian family charm inside but the food just didn&#39;t live up to the ambiance. The octopus appetizer tasted like rubber, probably frozen too long, the sauces had strange aftertastes, and the sausage was served in one giant piece like a bratwurst. The only things I enjoyed were the complimentary bread &amp; tiramisu for dessert. I think the worst part was the silverware still had chunks of food stuck on. And not just one utensil but all of them. It was gross and unacceptable for a &#34;nice&#34; restaurant."

The restaurant was very accommodating to our large party, setting up a table by the window and, astonishingly, serving our entrees at the same time. They also saved us the nightmare of splitting the check 12 ways by doing it for us. The service was impeccable, our waters were refilled early and often, and our waiter was friendly and attentive. Our food was wonderful, satisfying proportions, plated well, and unpretentiously good. For a brief period there was even live piano music. Unfortunately, they were out of tiramisu this evening so I tried the cannoli even though I have never had a cannoli that I enjoyed (not in Seattle, not even in Italy!), but the one here had a very thin shell and the ricotta filling was creamy with only a hint of sweetness - and it was, without a doubt, the best cannoli I&#39;ve ever had. 
Mondello is a wonderful hidden gem. If you haven&#39;t been, you must go! Just don&#39;t order the tiramisu because they need to save it ALL FOR ME!"

It was like going to a very cozy and warm Italian persons house. It was definitely authentic Italian food but the reason I am taking off a couple starts is because the noodles didn&#39;t taste 100% cooked and the flavoring was simplistic. Then again I had a shrimp pasta so it&#39;s likely that&#39;s how it is supposed to taste. My friend however loved his food and highly recommends this place.

The restaurant is the perfect juxtaposition of casual and fine dining. All pastas are made fresh in the back and you can tell. 

We split an arugula salad with mozzarella and tomatoes which had a great balsamic on it. After that we had fettuccine with tomato sauce and these incredible veal meatballs. Service was great and wine pours were generous. I can&#39;t wait to come back!"

Its small, so If you want a nice quiet dinner, I would go on a weekday instead. Luckily for us, all we wanted was a table with a cute candle and some dranks and food. 

We got that. I had a glass of the Sangiovesse, which was cab based. It was pretty tasty. He had the Cab Franc which was mild and perfect on a night where you&#39;re just talking and enjoying each others company. 

The Gnocchi with the Gorgonzola was soooooo good. I would recommend that, hands down He has the Seafood Pasta which I could tell he really enjoyed by his moaning and smiling during the meal.

From the wine selection, to the quiet/intimate ambience, the decor, and OH MY GOD the food--I am in love, and will most likely be a regular here. I&#39;ve gotten the gnocchi and the carbonara. Which are very typical, yes, but it was vital for me to see if the gnocchi was tacky. And it wasn&#39;t... It was perfect. Date got some sort of chicken dish cooked in a butter/white wine sauce with prosciutto and gargonzola and I liked his almost as well, but it was very heavy on the meats.

It was terrible.  I order the osso buco special, only to find out 20 minutes after placing the order, that it was out (at 6 pm?).  My wife&#39;s fettuccine with house-made italian sausage was absolutely awful.  The pasta was tough, heavy, and under-cooked.  The marina tasted like it was from Spaghettios .  The advertised fresh basil was missing and we had to ask for it.  And last but not least, the so-called sausage was dry, tasteless, TVP-like, and felt like it had been cooked for 3 days.  I had the gnocchi gorgonzola with walnuts, which was just so-so.  With wine, this terrible meal was about $100.

From the second I walked in the door and was greeted in Italian by the lady walking up front from the back room.  The place is so perfectly decorated and the atmosphere is fantastic!  The family that owns this place are from Sicily (hence the name) and the menu is authentic Italian dishes from the home land.  I decided to go with the Gnocchi Gorgonzola and my dining mate went with the Carbonara.  They were both incredibly delicious and receive two Big Italian Thumbs Up!  For dessert we tried the Cannoli and it was also great, reminding me of how my Mom makes them.
I highly recommend this place for anyone that is looking for great authentic Italian cuisine!  I will absolutely be back during my next visit to Seattle!"

We sat at a table outside, and our waitress was at the table next to us.  We were not greeted or acknowledged.  We sat at the table for 10 minutes, and were debating leaving when the waitress stopped by.  I ordered a glass of wine and the Felini Panini with a side salad.

It took about 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  The panini didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor.  The side salad was dripping in olive oil and nothing else.  Very bland.

Halfway into my panini, I found a black hair melted into the cheese.  I wanted to bring it up to our waitress, but she never checked in to see how our food was, or refill our empty water glasses.

Finally our waitress came back, I informed her about the hair in my food.  She said she would take it off the bill. 

The bill arrived, and the panini was still on there.  The waitress seemed so rushed, that I wasn&#39;t able to locate her to remove the panini from the bill.  Out of frustration, I paid, but I would NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant to anyone.

Bottom line: the wine is delicious, but the food and service are extremely sub par."

I did not know whether to take my own seat or wait for one of the staff to approach me. The only one making eye contact to me was an older woman who stood behind the bar who I&#39;m assuming was the owner/co owner or the wife of the owner as she stood there with sunglasses on drinking wine behind the counter wearing an apron. Regardless, i was growing tired of standing at the front of the restaurant so I walked up to the lady who still was staring at me and asked if I was to seat myself. She said &#34;sure&#34; and to be honest I don&#39;t believe she even spoke much english and whether she did or not was definitely not looking to help me  , so I finally sat myself down. The only waitress there was hustling and bustling around took a minute to acknowledge me and brought me a menu then quickly ran away. After 2 minutes I already knew what I wanted so when she finally came by she asked, &#34; want anything to drink more than water? I gave her my full order and then she left to put it in , no other dialogue or warm conversation. Ive been here before and I know that a complimentary bread basket is usually quickly brought to you but that didn&#39;t happen until some guy who looked like he also owned the place whispered in her ear to bring me some. On a totally different note that same guy was sitting with what looks like people he was entertaining in his restaurant and was very happy to accommodate them but let his waitress deal with all the other clients.  I finally got my food after 20 minutes which was a breaded chicken panini and a cup of soup. The chicken was burnt and looked like the cook attempted to pick off the burnt breadcrumb,GROSS! The soup was delicious luckily and the sandwich was average at best..

I could hear the waitress asking others around me how their food was but didn&#39;t approach me to ask for feedback on the meal. All in all I felt like I wasn&#39;t welcome in this otherwise charming little restaurant.

I really want to like this restaurant, I am part Sicilian and their prices aren&#39;t all that bad for lunch. The management of this establishment needs to either help their wait staff out or completely remove themselves from the dining room so they do not confuse or upset patrons. If they pitched in and helped a little the somewhat new waitress would&#39;ve had a higher tip and a more enjoyable work shift."

There were only 3 other tables with people and it was a little warm indoors so we sat outside.  Our server was knowledgeable about the wine list and answered all of our questions about the menu.  My husband had the gnocchi in gorgonzola and I had the bolognese pasta with sweet peas.  A lot of americanized Italian places have the tendency to use dry pasta and overcook it.  The pasta in the bolognese was fresh and cooked at a perfect al dente.  The sauce was legitimate Tuscan sauce with carrots.  Love! The gnocchi was good but not great.  The sauce was a little lighter than we expected from a cream sauce.  Overall, a good, real Italian restaurant in Magnolia.  Worth the visit and we&#39;ll be back."

My bf and I went here for lunch. At first I thought the place looked nice. Seemed a little quiet but it was a Tuesday and past the lunch rush. 
I ordered the carbonara and had to return it because the meat tasted sour. When I told the waiter, he didn&#39;t seemed surprised when I told him that the meat tasted rancid. The owner was there and never even acknowledged the fact that food was taken back. I asked for the fettuccine with veal meatballs to replace the carbonara hoping it was just a fluke thing. What I got looked like pasta in tomato soup. That&#39;s what it tasted like too. Like canned tomato soup. I took one bite and was disgusted. 
It&#39;s surprising to me that a restaurant who advertises authentic Italian cuisine could produce some thing like that. My bf ordered the Frittate, he said the eggs were over cooked and greasy and the dish overall was very bland. We left the place unsatisfied and still hungry, the food was not edible. A couple hours later I had the worst case of food poisoning. I had not eaten anything else that day and didn&#39;t eat anything after. 
I read good reviews of the place and was the one that insisted that we go there for lunch. What a disappointment. I will not be returning to that place ever."

It&#39;s in a nice little part of the Magnolia neighborhood and would be great for a family or romantic dinner. The restaurant is very cozy and feels like you&#39;re sitting in someone&#39;s kitchen. This is based on the atmosphere and style. It&#39;s not tiny like a kitchen, but a fairly small restaurant. Service was very friendly, but we didn&#39;t care for the food or wine choice very much. 

My bf had the special of the day, it was a pork dish that was cooked all day, served with white beans. The pork had a great herb flavor, but it was so extremely dry and chewy. I had one bite of it and didn&#39;t ask for more because I extremely dislike chewy, overcooked meat. He didn&#39;t even finish his meal. I had a pasta dish that had great flavor. The menu or waitress claimed my dish included homemade pasta, but it didn&#39;t taste homemade at all. It was a good entree; I just didn&#39;t believe the pasta was homemade. We had 2 red wines by the glass and didn&#39;t like either of them. I think we had the nebbiolo and sangiovese, but not quite sure. No plans to dine here again."

When we were seated, we were told that there was a 3 course pre-fixed menu. The options looked very good. We placed our order, but were informed immediately that the tiramisu wasn&#39;t available- okay, we had 3 other dessert options. Husband picks the cannoli and I picked the chocolate mousse. We finished our first and second course meals- it was great. We were very excited for dessert but were informed, when the time came, that those two options weren&#39;t available either. Alternatives (sorbets, gelato) not on the pre-fixe menu were offered to us but were not what we were expecting/wanting (I did not feel like eating frosty treats in the middle of winter.) We decided to go with a cappuccino and espresso instead. The check came and we weren&#39;t even comp&#39;ed for that- when we paid for dessert that we didn&#39;t get. 
It&#39;s  a shame because what we had was very good- I wouldn&#39;t come here again, especially on a holiday. It&#39;s not even like we had a late reservation to make it understandable as to why the food ran out. I was quite disappointed and it made our evening end on a sour note."

My wife and I have eaten here once, and that&#39;s all it took to be wholly impressed. Fresh made pasta, fresh seafood, fresh bread. -OMG.
The staff are peculiar in that Sicilian kind of way, which adds to the wonderful authentic experience. I think I actually prefer this place to Il Terrazzo Carmine.

A buddy of mine and I were thinking of a place to grab dinner and Mondello was in his coupon book for buy one dinner get one of equal or lesser value free. So we decided to check it out not knowing what to expect really.

It is very quaint and would be a great place to take a date. 

I have very happy to see gnocchi on the menu since it you don&#39;t always always find it in a lot of places. So the gnocchi pomodoro was delicious. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the pesto classico. 

My friend and I split a Caesar salad, which they brought out on 2 dishes which was nice, however the salad portion was a little small.

The tables have olive oil and balsamic and they bring out a basket of small thin bread slices just after you are seated. The bread was just OK; I prefer the big fresh out of the oven loaves that you have to rip apart - maybe it&#39;s an experience thing. :)

The staff gave the restaurant a home-y feel and our waitress was helpful.

Overall, I give it 5 stars."

The food was o.k. Really nothing to wow about. I ordered the lunch special. It was pasta in a white sauce with bacon bits and white beans. My friend ordered a fettucine. The portions were small..... I could have eaten three orders. The bill before tax was $29.

We would come here often and the food and service had been great, especially being in our neighborhood, we decided this was our favorite restaurant. 

It wasn&#39;t until we had made reservations on a Friday night at 6pm and had came in 15min early, with half the restaurant empty, the hostess seated us right in front of the door, literally next to the hostess table. We asked if we could be seated elsewhere, given that no one was really here. The two ladies looked at each other and then at their book and said they were booked for the night. We explained that we come here often, but they didn&#39;t care. They still said they were full, with half the place empty before 6pm. We were shocked at how they failed to help us.

I simply said we were going to go elsewhere, and they just looked at me and said ok. We&#39;ve talked with the owner before and whenever we had a problem he stopped at what he was doing and solved it. Really wish he was there because we felt like there was no customer service. Not sure if we&#39;ll return thought, really bummed about it."

The food was good, but not amazing, the ambiance cute and cozy, and the wait times slow.

PROS:
1. Lots of options. Bolognese. Carbonara. Spaghetti. Linguine. Alfredo. Lasagne. Etc.

2. Average portion sizes. Enough to fill, but not overstuff you.

3. Such a cute place! Rustic (termite-ridden? Ick) wooden plank tables, hand-painted walls, tiny chandeliers, etc. 

4. Yummy bread served warm.

5. Good wine menu.

CONS:
1. Slow! Everything came out slow. We didn&#39;t get waters until we were there five minutes, and it&#39;s not like the place is huge.

2. The food took forever! Probably 40 minutes at least.

3. The flavors were kind of meh. We could make better sauces at home.

4. What the eff was up with the peas and bolognese sauce mixed into the bf&#39;s pasta? Not a big deal for me. Kind of a big deal for a picky eater like my bf. Definitely would be a big deal for someone who doesn&#39;t like peas/meat or has allergies. Clean out your pans or use different ones, Mondello."

The waiter had charged us for an extra bottle of wine, 2 extra glasses of beer and 2 additional soft drinks.  Luckily we checked our bill!!!  We brought it to the attention of the waiter who didn&#39;t seem surprised by his egregious error!  The manager didn&#39;t seem interested to find out what the error was either.

This time, we were completely disappointed. What really was a place we loved became something we&#39;ll never go to again.  That&#39;s really too bad.

It appears that they have cheapened the quality of their food.  The side dish of beets were obviously from a can.  The octopus appetizer also seemed like it was canned.   the steamed clams and mussels had almost no flavor.  Our regular dish, the ravioli in marsala cream sauce was all cream and almost no punch of the Marsala flavor.   The ravioli filling was also not very good.  It was like they were frozen cheese raviolis. 

The waitress we had was on automatic and did not even ask if we wanted a drink to start off with.  Maybe it was the language barrier, but it seemed more like she just was not born to be a server.  It was kind of like a &#34;turn and burn&#34; in an empty restaurant. 

We were left so unsatisfied, that we went elsewhere and had some good dished to make up."

Do you think being treated badly by servers and bar managers means the place is super swanky? Do you like drinking warm tap water out of used whiskey bottles that can&#39;t be thoroughly cleaned out? Do you enjoy bars that have all the ambiance of a bank? Well Bad Bar is the place for you!

First you get to walk in and be sneered at by the manager. Did you want to hang up your coat? Sorry, you get to just dump it on the floor. Did you want a comfortable seat? Sorry, you get to sit on a wooden box next to floor-to-ceilings windows that ensure 120 degree temps in the summer and 40 degree temps in the winter.

Did you need to use the bathroom? Go outside, down the hall and that&#39;s when you discover that you need to have a keycode to get in. Go back to the bar and ask Surly The Bar Manager for the code and be glared at as if you just told her that she&#39;s the nasty person that she is.

Ah, check out the DIY decor that exists in every phony hipster restaurant everywhere. But this is different. They used the decorator that no one wanted to hire. If they didn&#39;t spare any costs, they got ripped off by bad welders and pseudo reclaimed bullcrap. And all those hard marbley surfaces everywhere make it impossible to carry on a conversation.

We sampled a variety of appetizers, one of which was a platter of Budig deli meats, grey poupon and shriveled gherkins. WHOOPS! I mean CHARCUTERIE. Served on a BOARD. And if it comes on a board, you know it has to be good! The rest of their appetizers aren&#39;t anything other than what you get at Red Robin or Cheesecake Factory, just dolled up slightly to make you think you are getting something super duper different.

I think that my favorite part of the evening was when I found a woman that they had over-served passed out in the bathroom, covered in vomit. I went back into Bad Bar to get some water to help her out, only to have incurred the wrath of Surly The Bar Manager for walking out of her Bad Bar with a glass of her precious lukewarm tapwater. She followed me into the bathroom hoping to yell at me for taking water out of the bar, but instead I told her to help out the poor woman that they had over served. Now I&#39;m sorry that I subjected her to Surly the Bar Manager. 

But it gets better. When I was handed the bill that came to almost $1,000 for our group, the server told me that I was cut off. She failed to get the info from our previous server that I asked for my drinks to be made with no alcohol in them. These people are not smart.

Bad Bar is nothing more than someone who doesn&#39;t have the first clue how to run a business, make drinks, serve customers, ANYTHING just trying to capitalize on the hipster bar trend in Seattle. Gastropub? More like DisastroDump. But hey, if you are shallow and only into pretentious crapholes, just go on! You&#39;ll LOVE it!"

At first glance this bar looks impeccable, at least on Yelp. I was certain this was going to end the night with a bang. I&#39;d characterize it more as a pop than a bang though. 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, interior is nice, but it really wasn&#39;t the ambience I was expecting to find. It could be due to the fact that it was a Tuesday night, but it felt way too dull in there. That wasn&#39;t all that bad because we at least got to sit and talk unbothered by loud noise or a crowded space. 

The drinks were fine I suppose, but going from one stellar cocktail program to another, I would expect no drop-offs. This one just couldn&#39;t live up to what I had previously encountered. It did however keep my buzz going, so no complaints there.

All in all, this is a good place for an imbibe. That&#39;s the minor letdown, it&#39;s just a &#34;good&#34; place - a good bar to be exact."

I love the atmosphere at Good Bar. It can get a bit pricey I will admit, but the old timey feel of the place is fantastic. While sipping on a whiskey sour or an old fashioned, you&#39;ll feel transported back to the early 1900s with its high ceilings and white banisters and marble decor. A huge black door in the back gives the hint of an old bank that got renovated (which I believe is what happened with this space). Even the bartenders exude a unique character that perfectly fits the feel of the whole place. Perhaps even better than the gorgeous decor here though is the service. I&#39;ve never had an issue with service here, every waitress and waiter attentive and refilling our drinks as needed.

If you have a larger group, a back staircase leads upstairs - there isn&#39;t a TON of space up there, but certainly enough for at least 1-2 large parties up there per night. Otherwise, the bar stools and small tables downstairs offer an intimate venue for a couple of good friends to catch up or for a date night for two. Definitely one of my favorite places to go to after work, if nothing else, just because it kind of takes you away from the usual dirty bar scene that you see at some of the other places in the area."

My friends convinced me to go out for my birthday and we decided to go to Good Bar after dinner. Annemarie tipped us off to Good Bar and yes it was good! I would never have guessed this classy little place was here (okay, it&#39;s not little at all), possibly because I don&#39;t typically roam around Pioneer Square after dark... The bar has a really good, chill ambiance that makes it perfect for a low-key gathering over one or two drinks (which is what we did). I ordered the Japanese Commercial Bank (not for the faint of heart). I saw iced tea (thinking it was Long Island iced tea of some sort) and was sold on that drink. The iced tea was mostly in the form of a large, fancy ice cube, so you want to wait for it to melt a little or you&#39;d just be drinking cognac. 

Service was attentive and everyone was so friendly in accommodating our party of 10. I was really surprised that we could just walk in with a big(ger) group on a Friday night. The place was pretty busy, but it seems that most people preferred to be at the bar. 

Good decor, good ambiance, good service. I&#39;ll have to come back to do more &#34;research&#34; on the drinks, will report back shortly..."

It never felt crowded although every seat was definitely taken. It got incredibly loud though and you had to yell at the person sitting next to you to carry on a conversation.
We were seated on the 2ndfloor loft area. 9 of us around a table meant for 6. Tight, but not uncomfortable. 
Happy hour specials are pretty okay.
Food options weren&#39;t great. And the portions were tiny EXCEPT for the sloppy joe. That was probably the one thing they got right. Charcuterie board wasn&#39;t bad either, but needed crackers or bread.
Our server did her best but I felt they were incredibly understaffed. One server for the whole loft meant we waited for drinks, food, silverware and even napkins. I got my bread and meatballs before my knife and napkin.
Great atmosphere if you were just looking for drinks. But if you come hungry, you may be disappointed."

This is a super fun bar! The food, drinks and service are great! We ate and drank from both the HH menu as well as the dinner one. We had a variety of different foods from the Salt-roasted fingerlings and potato aioli, roasted mussels, olives, the Ploughman&#39;s lunch for dinner (a charcuterie board) and chicken wings. All fantastic! If you came to eat Buffalo Wild Wings, these wings aren&#39;t for you - these are two normal wings (which takes about 3 days to make)  served over a delicious vegetable salad. The Good Bar doesn&#39;t deep fry anything so it&#39;s all made in a hot oven. The craft cocktails were beautiful and quite tasty! The atmosphere was a lot of fun!

Some friends and I popped in for drinks/dinner the other night, and it was a good time. The bar is sleek and the service was fantastic. 

Drinks: I had Joe&#39;s drink, which was right up my alley, with bourbon, amaro, and bitters. I also tasted Japanese Commercial Bank, and it just wasn&#39;t my jam. 

Food: Almost all of us got the sloppy joe, because, hello, it&#39;s a sloppy joe! Good Bar&#39;s version was elevated with Painted Hills beef, stout, and a Macrina ciabatta. It was so tasty, I mopped up every last bit from my plate. We also got the mussels, but those were less memorable. 

Good Bar&#39;s a fine place to kill a few hours if you&#39;re in the area. The neighborhood&#39;s a bit dicey at night, so make sure you grab a buddy."

It&#39;s not some random bar. That&#39;s for sure! I&#39;ve been to this spot a couple of times now. Happy hour seems reasonable and fair if you come early. 

The good: libations. Ask the bartender to whip up your favorite liquor and flavor concoctions: they will. Or order it from the menu! Either way is good. I&#39;m a little particular so I usually just tell them what kind of liquor and what not to put in i.e.: grape fruit or too much sugar/sweet stuffs. They are super nice about it! 

The ok: food 
Baked oysters were rich but a little too breadcrumby for me. 
Mussels - simple and tasty in garlic. 
Roasted pork- tasted this from a friend. Not my favorite. 
Meat &amp; cheese plate: this I like!

Menu is almost short and sweet. It&#39;s a good bar for happy hour. The views are beautiful too. It&#39;s kind of standing alone! Glass all over. Cozy upstairs! Guess I&#39;m a fan. That&#39;s for sure!"

A friend suggested we meet her here because it would be a good place to spend a few minutes and have a drink while we wait. The boyf left his water bottle on the table while he went to use the bathroom (which, btw, was separate from the establishment and required a key code to use which is sooo annoying). The server came up to my table and told me to put the water bottle in my purse since they don&#39;t allow outside beverages. He picked it up from across the table and handed it to me. Then he didn&#39;t bother to ask if I wanted water... or drinks... or anything... and walked away.

I immediately decided never to come back here. Kudos to all of y&#39;all who have had a good experience. Must have been nice.

Pros: the ambience is nice, it&#39;s a cozy place yet has lots of windows all around, it&#39;s in a section of pioneer that is not so exciting during the day but it&#39;s definitely better at night. Located right across from the waterfall garden. 

Happy hour menu is good, a couple of good drinks selection for $5 a pop. 

The regular menu has some interesting dishes, I.e., sardine which was excellent. 

Cons: the happy hour selections in terms of food is very limited and quantity of food is like a small bite (I.e., mussels - you get almost exactly 7 for $7) 

And the wine pour is smaller than I&#39;m used to..although they do use one of small glass container for measurement,nevertheless, it&#39;s about 4 ounce pour, I guess for $5 can one really complain? 

Overall-cozy little with lots of libation drinks options and unique foods."

However the staff was very professional, unpretentious, and obviously knew what they were doing. Staff worked well together. I sat at the bar and I was clearly underdressed as the clientele seemed to have that business professional feel yet each employee I encountered was helpful and curious. The atmosphere was lively and loud. Decor was classic and attractive. Corner bar in Pioneer Square off the main drag has high ceilings and Windows from floor to ceiling.

i first noticed this place when i stopped by the waterfall garden across the street. my partner and i were searching for HH and someone was playing some awesome sax out front of good bar. looked cute, but why weren&#39;t there tables outside? we opted for damn the weather&#39;s patio instead and earmarked it for later.

when we finally went, 3/4 of us ordered the gold rush off the HH menu. the only other cocktail on their HH menu is a gimlet. even after the waitress repeated our order back to us correctly, we somehow all got gimlets. meh, whatever. strike two was the cheese. we ordered three cheeses off of their menu. one recommended to us that we got was the ricotta. this and the other two were not accompanied by anything. not even bread/crackers. nothing. uh. am i supposed to sit here and shovel curds of mealy ricotta into my mouth with a fork? weird. we asked our server for another round of bread and butter (we&#39;d ordered one already) since the cheese didn&#39;t come with anything, and they gave us a weird look.

didn&#39;t really feel welcomed by the staff either. they were good at explaining the menu but not very nice or happy. won&#39;t be back!"

Beautiful space, first of all. Clean and modern, with lots of ornate touches -- from the crown molding to the balustrade to the columns -- to give it splendor and a ton of character. 

It seemed a bit slow for a Friday night when I came. The bar was full, but there were a few vacant tables on the main level. The upstairs was completely empty. It had a very casual and relaxed feel, and I really dug the downtempo trip hop mix they had going in the background.

The menu is not extensive but very thoughtful. I had three other people with me, and we sampled a few different dishes. We were blown away by almost everything we tried.  

They have a pretty good selection of cheeses and charcuterie, $3 per ounce. We kicked it off with an ounce each of salame toscano, bresaola, mole salame, gouda, St. Nectaire, and Rocchetta. While everything was delicious, the wonderful combination of savory, sweet, and spicy in the mole salame easily caused me to develop a mini-addiction.

Later on, we asked for a sardine, a sloppy joe, baked oysters, a couple of orders of braised beef with carrot spaetzle, fingerling potatoes, and a sunchoke and kohlrabi soup. Everything was a hit and all superbly prepared, but my personal favorite was the baked oysters! These babies got me all hot and bothered: crispy ham, chives, leek, bread crumbs. They come with a side of vinegary hot sauce, which I fully utilized. Lawdy lawd, the flavors just burst in your mouth all at once -- creamy, briny, tart, that intense millisecond where the hot sauce hits your mouth in all the right places -- and then you get that nice crunch from the crispy ham and bread crumbs. These oysters on their own are a good enough reason to come back!

I think my least favorite was the sloppy joe. It was good, and the meat was so tender, but a bit too sweet for me. If it were a tad more savory, I would&#39;ve liked it much better.

Cocktails were on point as well. Whiskey drinkers, you&#39;ll be excited about the Whiskey Smash.

Service was impeccable. Every staff member we encountered was personable, professional, attentive, and prompt.

I live a block away, so this place is super-accessible to me. Even if I didn&#39;t live this close, though, I&#39;d still be planning many returns."

Their mussels on happy hour have great flavor, and you can try a bunch of different cheese and meats by the ounce which is exciting for me since I hate committing to one thing.

The staff is friendly and helpful, able to make practically any classic cocktail you can think of, or if you&#39;d like, concoct something new based on your preferences.

We walked in after a Seahawks game, the joint was nearly full and in literally a blink of an eye were offered a table. The table already set with carafe of water and lit candle. We were given menus immediately and within two minutes were offered a chance to order a beverage. We asked for another minute to review the menu and the server returned as requested and with great timing.

This is a &#34;craft cocktail bar&#34; this means some very unique offerings of both food and beverage. The Cadillac umm something and Corpse Reviver both amazing balance of interesting, good, comforting and not too strange. I eventually asked for a tequila with lime juice that was not on a cocktail menu and it was also very well done. So you can usually order what is not on the menu.

&#34;Table touching&#34; and service check ins were frequent, well timed and never awkward for us.
I had the sloppy joe and wife had a meat and cheese plate. The food is very high quality. I would say a touch heavy on the cinnamon in the sloppy joe, that&#39;s a personal taste, but the bread it&#39;s on So fresh and toasted perfectly, even delivered less than ten minutes after ordering. Her plate was well presented with very fine sauces.

Let&#39;s see... The decor... The building is classic over 100 years old with marble and sculpted features combined with some very simple modern elements in the remodel. It&#39;s nice. Me likey. 

I was torn between 4 and 5 stars because of the sort of limited high end menu. That can sometimes turn me off, but because that&#39;s the foody trendy thing they are going for, I think they hit the mark well without trying too hard to be different, they actually have a special feel, and again the highest level of quality service without being snooty. Our time is valuable so we really appreciate the effort by the staff front to back. Will come again. This was my second visit. The last time was late at night, much less crowded and also very nice for me."

Good bar doesn&#39;t carry Crown Royal? Why not carry the world&#39;s most popular whiskey? Told they never carry it.

A bit too snobby for me.

Couldn&#39;t find anything on the ten item food menu to order. Wife&#39;s food just ok.

I tend to go here for happy hour. They have food and drink specials starting around $5. I would recommend the Americano and the marinated gin olives. Both are a great snack and a nice pick-me-up after a long day at work.

The bar itself is fairly spacious, but feels very intimate. Its&#39; bright and airy during happy hour, but at night it feels romantic and is dim. The prices in the evening, after happy hour, can be a bit steep. The food, though, from what I&#39;ve tasted and smelled is well worth the price.

First of all, they have bank vault doors still intact, which, in my opinion, is BAD ASS. Second, their cocktails are super delicious (order a Joe&#39;s Drink if you go, trust me). Third, THEY HAVE BOILED PEANUTS. The last time I had boiled peanuts was in New Orleans...almost 20 yrs ago. And before that? In my home country of Indonesia. So you *know* I order those every time I&#39;m there.

Hospitality.  An employee happened to see me approach their front door and he immediately opened it for me and welcomed me into the restaurant.  I felt like was a guest walking into a 5 star hotel.
  
Accommodations.  I was surprised I was allowed to place a to-go order.  I had an experience where a chef refused to make a to-go order for me.  

Atmosphere.  When I was seated at the bar I noticed it was a busy place and customers around me were happy to be there.  I liked being in a nice warm building when it was in the low 30&#39;s outside.  

Food.  I had the Salt-roasted fingerlings &amp; potato salad aioli and Sloppy Joe for dinner.  It was flavorful and filling.  I chose the Sloppy Joe because it reminded me of the SNL sketch &#34;Lunch Lady&#34; with Chris Farley and Adam Sandler.  I&#39;m also a fan of potato salad.  

Location.  It&#39;s only one block from the 3rd and Main Metro bus stop.  It&#39;s also close to the International District/Chinatown Station and the Sounder Train Station.

What I got was exponentially better!  If a Sloppy Joe is basically spaghetti sauce ladled over a couple of hamburger buns, then the Sloppy Joe here is Bolognese sauce  draped over a light, airy Italian roll.  The meat sauce was so good that I could have eaten without the roll. It was meaty and rich.  The roll was just the perfect texture and the addition of fresh mozzarella was a nice touch. I tried eating the sandwich with my hands and I could have made a go of it, but it would have been far too messy towards the end - it is called Sloppy Joe, after all!  I love this sandwich!!  I kept thinking about it in the days after I had first tried it.  That&#39;s really saying something from somebody that eats as many sandwiches as I do.  

Also had the Fingerling Potatoes with Potato Salad Aioli which was basically a deconstructed potato salad. The potatoes were beautifully done, slightly crispy on the outside, tender and delicious on the inside.  To round out our sample of the menu we had the Milk-Braised Pork.  It was terrific; fork-tender, rich and mellow.  A great dish!  Haven&#39;t tried any cocktails as I stuck with beer, but I promise to next time.

A really good start for Good Bar!"

While sitting at the bar we saw a drink being made. Watched bartender light a match to ignite the oil coming off a twist of lemon. 1&#34;+ of the burnt match dropped into the drink. We pointed it out. After straining it out, drink was served.

Next, saw something dark crawling in one of the Mason jar concoctions they have at the bar to mix with drinks. Reported this to the staff. Only a cursory look at the jar. Didn&#39;t open it. Didn&#39;t seem to care.

Had beer, charcuterie board, and boiled peanuts."

Their marketing department could use a little help since the name severely understates the true quality of the establishment.  Walking into Good Bar feels like you&#39;re entering an old bank because of the white granite bar tops, the high ceilings, and the vault door.  The difference between this bank and the others you may be familiar with is that this vault is filled with small plate and craft cocktail menus.. and perhaps a few bottles.  

The menu is small, but well crafted.  The selection is designed to share with other and try a few different things along the way.  I am a big proponent of the Sloppy Joe, the mussels, and the Ploughman&#39;s lunch for dinner, a not-so-small plate of cold cut meats and cheeses.  

The drink menu follows suit from the food menu, limited but of high quality.  My personal favorite cocktail from Good Bar is the Filson &amp; Co, which was a old fashion variant with campari and Laphroig mist, but sadly has fallen into the cocktail menu abyss.  Try any of the other cocktails though, the bartenders are the ones that make sure the bar lives up to the establishment&#39;s name. 

Come prepared to spend $30-50 dollars on food &amp; drink."

Upon entering, we noticed there was a healthy crowd. The tables and seats were filled but not packed. It was lively but not too loud or rowdy. The crowd looked like late 20s and 30s. There&#39;s a big U-Shaped bar and behind it, I noticed some bank details that went with the theme we read about. All the decor is white-ish/grey-ish and black with lots of dark wood and marble/marble-esque material. There were little copper lights all around the bar so it wouldn&#39;t be too dark and ya know, for photo taking. ;) The whole place was very sleek and sophisticated.

It was a cold night so our group ordered hot toddies and they were really made with love and care. The process was a little slow but watching it was so delightful, who cares? First, they made little sachets filled with herbs and spices. They steeped it into the water which they stored in an adorable Asian-style water boiler. Then they added maple, apple brandy and other liquids I might not identify correctly. They put a lemon slice with a rosemary swig poked through it and then served it to us in copper Moscow Mule mugs. 

They instructed us to leave the sachets in. It tasted as lovely and comforting as it sounded. It was fresh herbal-y, alcohol goodness with the warmth we needed on a winter night. 

Our service was great. As soon as more friends arrived, our bartender checked on us and made their drinks quickly to keep up with our earlier group so we could drink together. I didn&#39;t notice the new business service hiccups that often happen. 

Bars like this are great when the crowd is reasonable. However, once it gets crowded, they can&#39;t take the time to make the drinks with as much care or else the wait is too long. I truly hope Good Bar manages to find the perfect balance between quality drinks and a successful business because I don&#39;t want it to change!"

Came here while waiting for our spot at Damn the Weather on a Friday night. It was crowded, but we quickly found two seats at the bar. The ambiance is swanky, clean, and unique, especially for Pioneer Square. From the restored walk-in safe doors to the intricate crown molding, this building&#39;s past life as a turn-of-the-century bank shines through at every opportunity. The space is lively and inviting, and, with two-story ceilings, doesn&#39;t feel crowded. The second floor standing area keeps the main dining floor clear, even on a crowded Friday night.

The cocktail menu is well thought out- there&#39;s at least a drink or two for everyone, and the cocktails are creative and accessible. My tequila and citrus shrub cocktail was tangy, spicy, and fresh, and my cognac sazerac was a sweeter, lighter take on the classic, while still retaining the underlying flavors. Both cocktails were fantastic, and were made deftly by the prompt and attentive bartender.

Our chef&#39;s choice charcuterie plate came with two meat selections, two medium-hard, white cheese, and stone ground mustard and salted apple butter as sides. It was a well-rounded plate, with nothing truly outstanding. This isn&#39;t a slight- this is what I expected when we ordered it, and there are many more exciting things on the menu if the mood strikes. We spotted Jamón ibérico on the rotating, hand-written charcuterie card, and devoured our order with the requisite enthusiasm. It was, well, just as amazing as it should be- salty, flavorful, sumptuous, melt-in-your-mouth.

All-in-all this is a (relatively) hidden Pioneer Square gem that delivers. It&#39;s likely to become one of my regular spots."

We were seated upstairs quickly upon arrival. Service was a little slow, for how empty the place was aside our party. Their version of the Moscow mule is good, along with the sloppy joe on their late night menu. I wasn&#39;t able to really see my food because of the lighting but  I think it was in ciabatta bread.

Dare I say that it was probably the best Manhattan I&#39;ve ever had.  (And I&#39;ve had some pretty darn good ones.)

Tried the asparagus, pork and fingerling potatoes.

I tried the pioneer punch and hey salor cocktails. Both were great. I can tell they take the bar situation seriously. GreAt artistry there.

On the plate, it just looked like an underwhelming overcooked hardboiled egg. Not so much! It tasted like a great deviled egg with every bite. I want a whole plate! 

Our servers were attentive and very friendly. One even remembered that a friend of mine left her scarf several months before and brought it to the table!

A male waiter really helped us out when he snatched up a table for our small group of four just as it opened up. We thought the prices were a little high for what the food was. I was not excited about the menu, my husband did not like their boiled peanuts, and the couple we were with loved the sloppy joe but not much else. Their cocktails were good. It took a while for me to get the attention of our waitress to ask for our cheque (she was busy, then she exited the restaurant to take out garbage). My biggest complaint is how loud it was inside the building, we had to shout to converse which is simply not enjoyable. When we left close to 8pm, there was a very drunk woman being helped out of the building, spilling onto the sidewalk (classy clientele) and there was a homeless man waving people into a parking spot just outside the restaurant to make money (if you think this is great, you haven&#39;t been to South America - it&#39;s all fun and games until you come back to a keyed car with deflated tires because you don&#39;t have cash to give them for the &#34;help&#34; you didn&#39;t need or ask for).

Although the decor of Good Bar is high quality and stylish, the food doesn&#39;t follow. The oysters were bland and a little funky, the gin olives weren&#39;t funky enough, and the potato fingerlings with aioli we&#39;d heard such great things about weren&#39;t seasoned and were portioned too small.

The beef curry is so much darker than I am use to maybe because it has a kick to it.  The Japanese pickle vegetable was purple cabbage.  That was okay.  The white rice tonight was alittle mussy for me but I like my pasta al dente too. 
The pepper beef was very thinly slice beef.  It was alittle more on the dry side for me when I took a bite of it but the person who ordered it said she enjoys it.  
We got the adashi tofu, this was not sweet at all.  The tofu had a nice coating.  They put it in a pretty fried egg roll skin.  you can add the daikon and ginger to the sauce.
The karaage chicken was my less favorite.  See my photo.  I definitely had better.

I was a bit worried after reading some of the previous reviews regarding the portions. But was very pleased with what was served. I was certainly full after clearing my plate. 

I think the disposition people are having is that the instant Japanese curry that comes in those pre-made roux blocks are so cheap and widely available, it might appear to the average person that the dish itself should be cheap as well. But making it fresh and using fresh ingredients should also be factored into cost. I&#39;m not trying to justify their cost structure. I suppose if price is an issue, it might get in the way of enjoying your meal.

The main drawback of this location is parking, it can get pretty difficult to find a spot to park, particularly during busy times of the day. The hours of operation at this spot is pretty limited too."

Originally, I was only walking past Suga, but I happened to look at their menu by the door.  Lo and behold!  Okonomiyaki!  Dang!  Nobody--and I mean NOBODY--in Seattle makes Okonomiyaki.  They were still ten to fifteen minutes away from opening, but I had to wait.  No disappointments!  Okonomiyaki takes time to make, but you get three pieces of gyoza to placate your hunger while you wait.  Good gyoza and tasty dipping sauce. Woot!  And of the dish?  Awesome!  While Suga is likely the only Okonomiyaki game in town, they did a fine job. But don&#39;t wait around to give this a try.  The dish is a summer item only.  Better sooner than never.

Let&#39;s just talk about everything which is &#34;Japanese Comfort Food&#34; because I have no idea what that is, but if the large plates of delicious goodness that is served here is that, then MORE PLEASE.  I know what Chinese comfort food is, being I&#39;m Chinese, but there is such a thing from Japan!?! Also, this stuff might be better served in a bowl (more about this later). 

Answer is, yes, and it&#39;s darn delicious. So it&#39;s the Dons. These are probably akin to what we think about as Hawaiian food, Loco Moco and other foods that include an egg, meat and rice.

So what did I get?  Oyako Don, which is a chicken (diced and cooked), egg (binder that keeps everything together), rice (that is squashed under all this goodness), saucy (which is covered throughout my place), fried mess.  Also, a delicious, savory, perfectly seasoned, place of warm, stick to your bones, goodness. This take was an overly modern take, when really, it should be a simple, few ingredient meal. Overall, It&#39;s a best of all worlds, Japanese flavors, in something that a southern kitchen would appreciate. My old friend who came up from Cali, had the Kaki-Age Don, which was a vegetable tempura bowl.  Her plate was pretty delicious too (as I had a chance to steal a bite from it)

It&#39;s a simple set of dishes.  Perhaps, if they are to call these 丼 or Donburi... then maybe they should be served in a bowl; being that&#39;s what a &#34;Don&#34; is? eating rice off a plate is not as fun as you might think, and honestly, Japanese, Chinese, or Korean food not served in a bowl is weird to me. 

I mean this is not fancy eating, or anything that you should cancel all your other reservations to come to, but if you are in the neighborhood, and looking for solid food, then this place is highly recommended. Keep in mind, it&#39;s a VERY small location, with only eating for maybe 20-30ish people total, busy and the food does take a moment to come out, so don&#39;t expect fast food speed dining."

I wish it were spicier, but it was still tasty and maybe more tomato-y than I&#39;ve had before. The fried coating of the katsu pork was nice, not too thick or thin.

We ordered the Loco Moco Don and the Chicken Katsu Curry.

3 Stars because of the food was meh. Not bad, not great, just meh.
Curry: It was spicy and the texture of the gravy was interruptive. 
Not what we were familiar with when it comes to Katsu Curry.
Taste was not fitting to the higher-end cost. 
Loco Moco was good but needed more rice and another egg. It was overwhelmed with gravy which was again pretty spicy. And I have a high tolerance for spice. The meat was very good, tasted like the hamburger patty you get in Hawaii, which is hard to find!

The gyoza is homemade! My mom makes gyoza from scratch- Can we talk about this?

The pork katsu is well fried and seasoned - crispy, has a good chew that you would expect from pork, and not oily.  It seems like Suga has tweaked with their curry flavor profile, removing some of the acidity / sour notes.  This is a welcome change as the curry tastes more balanced and has a good spice to it.  Suga has also tweaked the beef curry for the better, the cubes of beef were soft and easily pulled apart.  The portion for the curry plate is large and each comes with either a miso soup or salad, so come hungry.  Also try the flan, a nice lite dessert to round out your meal."

I&#39;m no expert but I&#39;m a huge fan of Japanese curry + katsu. When I lived in New York, I religiously paid homage to Go! Go! Curry. While Suika&#39;s awesome curry has filled that void for me in Seattle, I still get really excited whenever I see a place that serves Japanese curry + katsu. 

So of course, I had to try Suga. Parking can be tricky, especially on the weekends. We had to circle the block a couple times before finding parking on a residential street a couple blocks away. The ambiance is cute in a casual but cozy kind of way. The place is pretty small and probably won&#39;t be able to accommodate large groups, but it&#39;s a great place to catch up with friends. Service was very friendly and attentive. The menu has limited options, which makes decision making easy. I ordered the katsu curry, which was delicious. The katsu was crispy and juicy without being greasy and it was plated beautifully on a bed of fluffy rice with a generous portion of flavorful curry sauce. Maybe I&#39;m a fat ass, but I thought the portion was not big at all. My boyfriend ordered the loco moco don, which was much smaller than my katsu curry. At ~$15 per entree, Suga is kind of pricey but I think it&#39;s a worthwhile &#39;splurge.&#39; 

If Fremont wasn&#39;t so out of the way for me, I&#39;d probably be hitting this place up way more often than I should."

I ordered the katsu curry and found the portion too small, the taste not that special, and price point way too high. My friend was also not impressed with her dish.

There were some very high points: Their Katsu is fantastic, crisp without being oily and firm while remaining juicy. The homemade Gyoza were also flavorful and fresh (a little ginger goes a long way). And some low points: The karaage was undercooked to the point that the coating was still white. And none of the &#34;Dons&#34; short for Donburi which literally means &#34;Bowl&#34; were served in bowls...

I am a big fan of Japanese Curry and as such I have a very concrete idea of what it should taste like. Suga&#39;s curry was different from my expectations. In some ways it was an interesting change, their curry is spicy and thick, almost chunky. Very different from the smooth homogenous curry I am accustomed to. But the curry also had an acidic quality I couldn&#39;t place. It wasn&#39;t bad but it felt out of place. I later realized that it was reminiscent of the acidity in an Indian curry.

The service is friendly but it feels a bit much for the neighborhood. I&#39;d really prefer counter service with a more relaxed atmosphere. All in all a decent place to have in the neighborhood."

My girlfriend and I came for dinner and ordered gyoza, katsu curry, and sanshoku don. We also got miso soup and side salad.

The miso soup was so-so. Not very flavorful and lacking miso. I started doubting the place when I had the gyoza. It was understuffed and had more of a wonton texture. They way oversteamed it. At this point, I was just hoping our entrees would save the day..... NOPE.

The curry was too thick and had a particular seasoning that was overpowering the other favors. I couldn&#39;t quite put my tongue on what it was, maybe cumin? The curry tasted fine overall but I&#39;d say it&#39;s below average for my standards. Japanese curry is one of my favorite dishes and I&#39;ve had it my whole life so I&#39;m a pretty harsh critic of curry. This place did not deliver in the curry department. Nor did they with the katsu. It was too crispy and too thin. Also the pickles were something i had never seen served with curry. Usually, it&#39;s fukujinzuke but they served pickled carrots and daikon like the do chua on bahn mi. Not a good combo to me.

As for the sanshokudon, when it came out, I was completely underwhelmed. My donburi came on a plate.... Donburi literally means bowl. What the hell is this patty looking thing on a plate? $13 for some ground beef and egg on a rice patty I could finish in 5 bites. Hmmmmm.

But the biggest travesty and the sin of all sins was what they did with the rice here. I guess in an effort to liven up the appearance of comfort foods, this place squishes the rice into shapes to fit the presentation. That works to an extent, but not when you squish it so hard together that it breaks the integrity of the rice and becomes more of a mash. 

I question the Japanese cooking crafts here. I did not get an authentic vibe nor feel any comfort eating the food I grew up with. I was more or less just pissed off that I spent $43 on some mediocre food that I could have made better at home. The food here does not justify the price."

The salad was ordinary but very tasty - nicely dressed, cold and crisp.

Chicken KaraAge was the weak point, the fry being not crisp enough, but still hot, fast and tasty.

Katsu curry was very good, with a perfect cutlet and flavorful sauce.

Katsu don was very good, with another perfect cutlet.  (I think donburi should really be in a bowl rather than on a plate, and maybe the egg less cooked, but this was very satisfying.)

There&#39;s a nice selection of beverages and very gracious and hospitable staff.  I felt very welcome, and well taken care of.

My only concern is that Suga does not seem to be promoting itself well.   There&#39;s no web page, no Facebook page and if you try to google map it you just get Dot&#39;s Delicatessen which is closed.

For one reason or another - perhaps the low-key atmosphere, the friendly-looking waitstaff, or my waxing of nostalgia as a former Japan resident - we decided to carpe-diem our night and walked in with slight trepidation. Would this establishment meet two very picky, young and urban professional&#39;s &#34;foodie&#34; standards? 

Turns out, YES! Firstly, the staff greeted us with the proper &#34;irrashaimase&#34; salutation and invited us in with a warm, genuine welcome. We chose our seat at the bar, and instantly were served our cool sake libations and begun good conversations with two of their chef/manager/all-around-jack-of-all-trade staff members. 

Next came the food choices. While there wasn&#39;t a specific gluten-free option on the menu, they were wonderfully flexible and generous, taking the time to walk my roommate through her options and how they might accommodate her every taste-bud whims. We salivated through...

...the Una Don (Unagi Donburi, a.k.a. Eel bowl). Brown rice (or your choice of white rice) topped with unagi, cooked well, savory and juicy, with a garnish of sweet yet sour carrots and radish.

...the Japanese Rice Omelet (Omu-rice). Sautéed or pan-friend brown rice (or white) mixed with chicken and veggies, topped with a thin sheet of fried, crepe-like egg, glazed with a ketchup-like scrumptious teriyaki sauce.

Last, but certainly not least - dessert. Deliciously cold red bean, matcha, and strawberry mochi served on a glass boat with a tiny pink umbrella.

What can we say? It was certainly an evening of unexpected delights - super amiable and genuine staff, quick and attentive service in a clean, bright, and simple atmosphere. Look no further than Suga to fill your Japanese hankerings in Fremont."

Be warned: The portions are huge! My husband and I easily could have shared one dish, though I am looking forward to our leftovers! The beer and sake selection was decent, too.

So when I saw Suga on yelp, I checked it out since it was new. Upon seeing the pics of curry katsu and the likes I told my girlfriend that this is where we were going to eat tonight, get ready cause it&#39;s time to go.

Check out the menu, small but that&#39;s okay. The prices though, all the entrees are above $10. $15 for a curry katsu? Seems a bit pricey but I&#39;ll let that slide because if this place is delicious, I&#39;m sure I would be back.

We ordered the Katsu Curry and the Una don (bbq eel rice bowl), both came with miso. Miso was decent, nothing crazy but it wasn&#39;t bad by any means. The Katsu curry though, while also decent, was definitely not worth $15 to me. It had alright flavors but wasn&#39;t quite as savory/hearty like you would expect from a curry dish. The tonkatsu was nicely breaded, but wasn&#39;t crispy at all in my opinion. If this dish was $10 I wouldn&#39;t have been as upset with it, but at $15 I was. 

The una don was a pretty small portion. Typically with donburis, you get a ton of rice and a decent amount of protein to fill you up. The dish had a good rice:protein ratio but that&#39;s only because the serving was on the smaller side. My girlfriend thought the unagi was tasty, and when I tried it, it definitely wasn&#39;t fishy which is good.

But after finishing our dinner and $40 later, we decided we were still hungry and contemplated going somewhere else to fulfill our appetite. Thought this had the chance to be my new go to spot, but I probably won&#39;t return.

The silver lining is that the service was great and the staff was extremely friendly. I feel like it&#39;s hard to give only 2* when that criteria is met but the food was a let down for how much I was spending!"

We ordered the beef curry, and a pepper beef bowl (they were out of the katsu donburi). The curry lacked the savory / heartiness from the beef; it just tasted flat. The pepper beef on rice was OK, but it&#39;s just a copy of a superior Chinese dish. Definitely not the &#34;comfort food&#34; that I expected. And the prices are too high for the quality and portion size.

The overall decor is off. Harsh white lights make the food look cheap, and the benches are uncomfortable. The setup feels like an American diner, but without any of the warmth or charm. Go to Yoroshiku, or Suika, or Maekawa Bar in ID to see how Japanese comfort food is done."

We moved on to our entrees:  Beef Curry, Loco Moco Don, and Katsu Don.  All were beautifully plated and good portions.  The Curry was heavily spiced which I loved, and the addition of Japanese pickles added a nice tang to the dish.  The Loco Moco Don was also spicy, and such a fun take on the classic Hawaiian dish.  My boys had the Katsu Don - perfectly browned and flavored with just the right crunch.

The interior is well done - clean, not cramped, bright and airy, with kind, welcoming staff. 

The food is amazing: all made from scratch, all accurately authentic Japanese fare. We started the gyoza - homemade and hand-wrapped pork dumplings that were perfectly crispy on the bottom. We also shared the beef curry - delicious cubes of beef and semi-spiced curry sauce with soft sticky rice. The portion was large and the food sticks to your bones.

A restaurant selling it self as homestyle Japanese, can not charge $15 for curry that is on par with S&amp;B&#39;s Golden Curry packets. The meat was done well but that still did not justify the egregious prices. Albeit a different niche, the pricey &#34;modern industrial&#34; restaurant Revel down the street charges $6 dollars for the same import beer Suga charges $8 for, take note of their rice bowl portions, quality, and cost for another point of comparison. Suga is in a great location and I fully understand the cost of Fremont real estate, but customers will be hard pressed to justify the cost of their meal and see Suga as a dependable replacement for a meal at home or a once and a while treat. My advice to the owners is to check out the asian restaurants in Lynwood and the International District for inspiration."

The space is small, but warm and open. Depending on the crowd, it can get a bit hard to hear conversation at lower levels, but it odds to it&#39;s charm and overall feel of venue that would supply comfort food.

Food is creative and the ingredients high quality.  I&#39;d say solid overall.  Nothing we had was a knockout, but there were no disappointments either.  We enjoyed some wings, a house made pretzel, burgers and sandwiches.  Food was fine, above average IMHO. 

Service was good, atmosphere was fun, with games on the telly, dart boards etc.  It&#39;s an open space, with communal seating at large tables, so you will probably share one and get to know your tablemates.

that being said, the brave horse is good at being a place you can take the parents while still getting a bar experience. they have some local beer options and their menu changes regularly. the food is well prepared, consistently prepared, and i&#39;ve never regretted any burger, fried-something or dessert ordered.

i feel bad giving it a 3-star since there&#39;s nothing overly bad about brave horse, but i don&#39;t feel confident enough to give it the &#34;yay, i&#39;m a fan&#34; 4-star rating.

maybe it&#39;s because the atmosphere just feels too stale from the moment you walk through the door. for a place with so much seating and open bench tables, it feels like everyone inside is really segregated--like pandas that have been forced into a cage to mate.

one thing the brave horse does share with normal dive bars is the shitty, can&#39;t-hold-a-dart, over worn dart boards that need immediate replacing. i mean, c&#39;mon, guys. dig into that pretzel fund and get some new dart boards."

We came in and it was pretty empty so we got seated pretty quickly and the server was super friendly and helpful to get us started.  

We ordered a bunch of beers &amp; drinks and after a few rounds, we decided to get some food. I got their Crispy Alaskan Cod Fish Sandwich with tots, but I got fries instead.  No biggie, there&#39;s bigger problems in life. It&#39;s a huge mound of fries so there is plenty to go around.  Sandwich was pretty good, fried fish was nicely fried that came with this slaw in the sandwich and some spicy mayo.  Bar food type of menu but on the fancier side, because T. Douglas.

Everyone else ordered other stuff that I didn&#39;t pay attention to, but no one seemed to have any issues so we were all good. Service was actually pretty good, server was personable, quick and attentive the whole time. Didn&#39;t have any issues separating checks for us and anticipated our group would ask for that anyways.  

Good for large groups, and they have an outdoor patio seating area so that was nice. Weekday nights seemed pretty slow in the area, actually pretty abandoned so there was no issues with parking, walking, bussing or Uber&#39;ing.

I have been working in SLU for a little while now, and somehow I had never made it over to Brave Horse. This is even more surprising considering how much I enjoy Tom Douglas&#39; restaurants. I was meeting a coworker for lunch, and he was shocked I had never been, so we decided to head on over.

Brave Horse doesn&#39;t have a huge menu, and what they do have definitely trends more toward a pub feel. They had a pulled pork sandwich special (pulled pork topped with slaw), so I decided to get that with a side of their tots. I got extra BBQ and the aioli they use on some of their sandwiches as dipping sauces. The sandwich had a nice flavor, and the slaw complemented the pork well. The pork didn&#39;t have a smoky flavor to it, so as a BBQ purist it was average, but I did enjoy the sandwich. It just wasn&#39;t amazing, and certainly not $14 amazing. The tots had a house seasoning on them that was good, but they weren&#39;t really all that different from typical tater tots. They were tasty though, and the aioli in particular was a great dipping sauce for them.

I did decide to return recently at the behest of a coworker, and I tried one of their burgers and shared a pretzel. We chose the pimento cheese dip for pretzel, and it had a very nice flavor. The pretzel itself was on par with many soft pretzels I have had though was a bit small in my opinion. I tried the special weekly burger on the menu, &#34;The Champ&#34;. A lot of folks talk about how great Bravehorse&#39;s burgers are, but I found mine rather pedestrian. It tasted fine, but was small and pretty forgettable. There are much better burgers to be had, even within a few blocks.

Brave Horse is definitely set up like a tavern or saloon and has that ambiance once inside. It is all self-seating, with a mix of smaller tables and larger communal style tables. The service was ok but not exceptional, and it seemed to take a while to get our order taken as well as our check at the end. They do have a large number of beers on draft, which was definitely a plus. I feel like Brave Horse, true to the &#34;Tavern&#34; in the name, is likely a better HH spot than a lunch spot. The food was decent but a bit pricey (including the beer!), and in general I didn&#39;t feel the normal Tom Douglas magic in my meal. I may return for HH at some point, but it definitely will not be my first choice for lunch. I much prefer Local Public Eatery just a block away."

Some of the food was perfect, some of it was off, but the service stood out the most, unfortunately. 

I loved my bacon cheeseburger. Wow. So good. They have American cheese here and that&#39;s really all I needed to know. Nothing beats American cheese on a burger. And they really have my favorite burger I&#39;ve tried in Seattle, yet. But that&#39;s where my good food experience ended. The pretzels we ordered were burnt and overcooked. At first, I thought maybe that was just how they prepared them, but when I looked back at other photos, I realized that was not the case. I can forgive this misstep because the burger was BOMB-DIGGITY! But I couldn&#39;t forgive the bartender for his rage-filled service. 

When we sat at the bar, we noticed something was up with the bartender. He wouldn&#39;t look anyone in the eye and he was rage-slamming everything around like he was really pissed off. I didn&#39;t think too much of it at first. I used to bartend and there were some days, man... you just can&#39;t always compartmentalize the bullshit you have to put up with. Then I saw a group of khakis and Polo shirts come up to the bar near us and yes, they were annoying. Yes, they were doing that chain-ordering BS I used to hate on busy nights (and yes, it was busy.) But the rage I saw this bartender give to this group...  holy crap. I would have been fired. Instead of handing the man his change (he had his hand out right in front of him) the bartender tossed it on the bar. Wouldn&#39;t look at them. Ignored their requests. That&#39;s when I started to get uncomfortable. He wasn&#39;t outwardly mean to us... but he didn&#39;t look at us once. Just shoved food in front of us and generally made everyone sitting at the bar feel like a burden on him. And really, as much as I hate to admit it, being in the service industry means being nice to people--even when you feel the firey pits of rage build up in your soul. He didn&#39;t ask if anything was cooked to our liking. He didn&#39;t&#39; check on us. When we left, I felt like I should tell him &#34;sorry&#34; for coming there and bothering him. 

So, if it just came down to getting my burger fix, this would have been a 5-star experience. I loved that thing. But the combo of the two burnt pretzels and the scary service just left me with a bad taste in my mouth."

Nothing special, nothing horrible, but kinda luke-warm, hearty dishes to fill you up. The jams are freezer jams and the toast appeared to be pre-packaged, but everything else tasted just fine but unmemorable. Based on their menu, this place would probably be better for lunch or dinner when they have their full BBQ menu on feature.

I find myself at Brave Horse quite often and it&#39;s the perfect place to grab a beer or a quick lunch. Service is always friendly and it&#39;s got a great atmosphere. Plus, any place where you can order a giant bowl of tots with jello shots is fine by me!

I am not familiar with Tom Douglas, nor was I expecting such a wide range of reviews for what is otherwise a very hip- and fun-seeming tavern in &#34;Amazon Country&#34; of Seattle. Nonetheless, I always trust my girl Sarah (she runs a great blog called Seattle by Sarah) for when I visit SEA-town, and she brings me to some great spots. I have to side with Sarah and the more positive reviews of Brave Horse, as I had a great time here with a couple of girlfriends for a casual weekend brunch. 

I was a fan of the contemporary tavern-mixed-with-rustic barn atmosphere, although be warned that if you&#39;re seated below one of the skylights and have a wicked hangover or a sensitivity to bright light, that you&#39;ll want to wear your sunglasses indoors. There&#39;s also no chance of screaming children interrupting your meal, as Brave Horse is a 21-and-up spot during all business hours.

I&#39;d highly suggest you begin your day with either the Hop-Mosa (grapefruit juice and Boneyard IPA) or a Breakfast Margarita. We ordered a smorgasbord of breakfast and brunch items, most memorable being the Elvis Pretzley, a take on The King&#39;s favorite sandwich - banana, smoked peanut butter, and crispy bacon - atop a pretzel bun. We also ordered a strangely healthy option (strange given everything else we ordered) - the delicious Greek Yogurt and Granola. 

May I also suggest the Jalapeno-Artichoke Dip with pretzel chips, the Bacon-Spiked Deviled Eggs, and the Handmade Pretzels &amp; Mustards (only $4.75 and you get three mustards: beer, apple, and spicy). Clearly, we were in the mood for pretzels, and that&#39;s an item that Brave Horse has down pat. 

I can infer how this place totally changes personality come evening or weekend night with trivia, happy hour, etc., but if anything, it would be even more fun than a &#34;quieter&#34; (but still lively) brunch/lunch. Parking is fairly easy along the streets surrounding Brave Horse, and it&#39;s located on the second floor of a new building right along Terry Ave. South."

If you are a freak who doesn&#39;t like mustard, though, the tots are still stellar without. 

They&#39;ve got a pretty good selection of beer here and nice chill atmosphere. Also, for my fellow moscow mule lovers, they have it in SLUSHY FORM here. I mean, really. I can&#39;t think of anything more refreshing than that. 
Will definitely be back to try more stuff and their happy hour and just generally douse more things with their delicious table mustard."

First, while I made a reservation for brunch a week in advance, they sat me at a table in the bar that has no waiter service!  I finally realized no one was coming and asked if they could assign wait staff to our table of six, but was told they could not. This seemed very strange given I had a reservation!  Luckily they were able to move us to another table.

However, it was a waste as the actual service on this day was so unfriendly, we might have been better off without service. :)  She was pretty unfriendly to us and despite the fact that we kept ordering drinks/food throughout the game, we always had to ask for service vs. her checking on us.

Finally, the food quality was not great this time.  Several dishes came lukewarm/cold and the bacon was inedible.  The food was so bad that one person who came late decided to wait to eat until later in the day at another restaurant.

This was the counter opposite to our last brunch visit (also during a Hawks game) where we had an awesome table, service, and food.  So I probably would go back again but would love to see a little more consistency in their approach!"

So, when we finally had enough of that, we asked if we could grab a table (the place was super empty). We were hoping that a server (and more comfortable seats) would be the elixir needed to cure the current mood. 

Nope. 

We went off to our table, and were rightly ignored there until we went back up to the bar and asked for a server. We ordered some food, silly us thinking that ordering more would get us better service, and beers. Food came out, and it was just okay. The smokey wings were to be hot, but the sauce was ladled into the bowl, then the wings placed on top. No mixing, just wings sitting on top of sauce. Worst part?  Didn&#39;t see the sauce until we were about done with the wings. Sigh.

I must say that I came here for happy hour during my birthday month and found a hair in my pretzel sauces.

Those coming here expecting the &#34;Tom Douglas Experience&#34; should go elsewhere or lower their expectations. Tom wanted to open a gastropub and well, he did it. Just like many, many others in Seattle. It rises to the occassion, but don&#39;t expect to be blown away.

The food is fine, and the burgers are good although it&#39;s quite easy to run up the tab with burger add-ons. The pretzels are worth getting, though I believe the happy hour version is smaller.

Speaking of happy hour, SLU has better options that perhaps aren&#39;t as imposing as this large building with it&#39;s (admittedly lovely) west-facing bank of tall industrial-style windows. Brave Horse is a HUGE let down on the happy hour front, offering a very limited selection of drink and food specials. Really, you can&#39;t even throw a dollar off all beers on tap??

But, this is the heart of Amazon country where new hire orientation every week packs hundreds of new transplants into brand new office spaces, so expect this place to be packed every day of the week from 4:30-6:30.

However, my prejudiced feelings can be overridden by good food and good drinks. Service was nothing special. They mixed up our orders a little bit but I can get over that. 

Everything we ordered was quite delicious. I finished my Bloody Mary and ordered another one like the glutton that I am... And of course I didn&#39;t finish that but still. I never order more than just one of those babies.

Decent beer, excellent warm soft chewy pretzels with a nice array of dipping sauces. The smoked peanut butter bacon was ok, the onion and sour cream was nice and the pimento cheese was awesome. The jalapeño cheese was pretty standard and too rich.

The chicken wings are cooked beautifully and have a very strong smoky flavor. I doubt they smoke them for that long and I&#39;m pretty sure they use liquid smoke but the end product is delicious nevertheless. 

Really good prices for happy hour but the regular menu is a little pricey. Overall not bad. Would like to go back here again."

The service was good - everyone was attentive and super helpful. They helped to arrange chicken dinners for everyone in our group who wanted to partake. They also dealt with the bill with a level of expertise that is under appreciated. 

The chicken was really good. It was seasoned well and juicy. It was definitely worth a try. Some of the side dishes were disappointing. I love corn so I&#39;m an easy sell there. It was sweet, fresh, crisp, and grilled nicely. The bread was dry and after taking a bite, decided it wasn&#39;t worth a carb cheat for me. The beans were something I feel I could have gotten out of a can.

I like a number of Tom Douglas restaurants. I&#39;m not sure Brave Horse is the place for me. It&#39;s okay but find greater enjoyment at other places nearby."

My friend got a burger and fries with tea. He said his burger was cooked well.

Fries are served a la carte so don&#39;t forget to ask for them or you&#39;ll just get a burger or sandwich by itself.

The first time was for a birthday party. When you walk in and pass the hostess desk we were in the area on the right. We had a nice long table and the server brought us beer after beer, bloody after bloody mary. It was a good time. We ate, we drank, we had fun. Their beer list is full of local beers, well-rounded enough to satisfy any beer-drinkers palate, and the burgers aren&#39;t bad. 

On my return trip, I went to &#34;BHT&#34; for an engagement party. We were in the same place. We walked in, and the hostess....didn&#39;t greet us. So instead, I told her we were there for a private party, blah blah blah. She pointed to the room divider and said, &#34;you&#39;re in there&#34;. Ok. Since we were running late, we had decided to park in the lot under the building. It was quicker than finding street parking on a Saturday evening. They have signs showing you where to park and the parking garage advertises other restaurants their parking would be convenient for. I asked the hostess about the parking situation - validation? complimentary? car washing? hand-wax and oil change? JK. But I did ask about the first two. Her response was &#34;I don&#39;t know, I bike here.&#34; Oh, you&#39;re so helpful, is what I was thinking. She is employed to know these things. To add to a guests experience. I asked again just to verify that she was neither helpful nor accommodating. She was clearly not interested. The parking garage ended up not being complimentary for restaurant guests, which is fine. The sign says it itself - rates apply...but for real, do Tom Douglas a solid and add, not detract from the empire he has built. 

The rest of our stay was pleasant. Platters of meat and cheese and other accoutrements. Pretzels and all the sauces. Drink tickets. So I tipped a few back on the patio outside, enjoyed the fine company, and on our way out blessed the hostess and wished her well. Good riddance. But see you soon, you brave horse"

We shared an order with wilted kale and blue cheese smashed taters as their sides, along with a piece of their bread/roll which had a pretzel crust. Individually, each could be good on their own but altogether the flavors were overwhelming!! Over-seasoned and just too much. Sad to say but I probably liked the roll the most.

It&#39;s a 21+ place with long tables that parties shared. TVs with games on. Could definitely see this place being crowded and busy after work during happy hour since it&#39;s right next to the Amazon building.

If you&#39;re in S. Lake Union looking for a place for Brunch, might I suggest the Brave Horse Tavern?  

Oh man - so, so good!  Rarely do my scrambled eggs come out PERFECT.  The eggs here are fluffy, light, and delicious.  I still think of them often.  The french toast was also a treat (though if you don&#39;t like orange flavor - you might want to skip this). My husband had a skillet which was HUGE!  He was full for the rest of the day. 

The brunch cocktails are worth every penny!  The brunch Bloody Mary is so, so good! Just a warning though, if you ask for spicy, you&#39;re going to get SPICY!

This is also a great place for a mid-afternoon drink &amp; snack.  The pretzels are AWESOME.  The dipping sauce however, needs some work.  The PB / bacon is fun for the first bite but then you&#39;ll pretty much be over it.  I wish (upon a star!) they had a melty cheese to go with the pretzels.  The pimento cheese just doesn&#39;t really do it for me.  The mustard is pretty much just regular old stone-ground mustard.  

Also - the place is seat yourself and most of the tables are long (like picnic table style) so don&#39;t be afraid to make some new friends - might be the only way you&#39;ll get a seat.

Just a tip - this place is 21 &amp; over and they will ID."

What luck for us--I&#39;d been pretty resigned to eating at whatever lackluster establishment might take a huge group during weekend brunch hours without causing massive amounts of headache. I&#39;d eaten at another Tom Douglas restaurant (Lola, which was amazing) the day before, and it had been a struggle to get a table for four. Brave Horse, you guys. It&#39;s not as much of a scene, but it&#39;s a cool place with great food, and it&#39;s easy to deal with.

Actually, there was one headache--one of our party didn&#39;t have U.S. license and was sent back to her hotel to get her passport even though she had U.K. identification. I&#39;m going to chalk this up to the bar doing its job/guarding its ass, but that was annoying. The rest of us sat and waited with drinks while she and her boyfriend ran for the passport. Our waiter was really apologetic, though, and comped both of them drinks when they got back.

The space was huge, and we sat at a long table near the massive bar. The place felt very homey and casual, with a lot of plain hardy wood furniture and some string lights up top for added atmosphere. Service was excellent, as were the drinks. I had two Blood Marys, and they were wonderful, thick and hot with spiced salt rims, generous pickle garnishes (olive, asparagus, green bean, onion), and PBR beer backs. My husband&#39;s Smoked Maple Old Fashioned was also good, made with smoked maple Knob Creek, rye, and angostura bitters, with a nice hunk of bacon on top. Sweet, smokey, and full of booze.

The food was great, a sort of Seattle gastropub tour of American comfort food. We went more or less family style on a few things, and they were all tasty. The handmade pretzel was fresh and chewy, served with a trio of mustards (hot, apple, and beer) and, for a little extra, a dipping sauce or two or three. We opted for the combo that brought two pretzels and all three sauces: pimento~cheddar dip, sour cream and crispy onion, and smoked peanut butter and bacon. It was a fun spread. The fried Wisconsin cheese curds were in the same vein, deep fried little nuggets served with dill pickle tartar sauce. I also really liked the beer steamed Manila clams, which came in a brothy sauce with pretzel croutons and dijonnaise.

I split the summer BBQ plate with one of my friends, and this was a winning entree, plenty big enough for two, especially with other things on the table. It came with a smoked chicken thigh, a house hot link, collard greens, and macaroni salad. Everything was delicious. The chicken thigh was moist and tender, slathered in a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce. The hot link was juicy with a good snap, and the sides were on point. Great light mac salad, and stewy collard greens flavored with ham hock.

I&#39;d recommend Brave Horse for a good drink and a relaxing meal with a big group of friends. Probably fine in other contexts too. I&#39;d certainly come back if I lived in Seattle."

At first glance I was certain I&#39;d hate the place because its so incredibly yuppie. And it is, but this place is also very good.

They have a great craft beer selection, and several IPAs on tap I hadn&#39;t seen elsewhere. I would have probably tried them all already if they didn&#39;t offer a Kill The Keg special during games, which is (I believe) beer at the end of whatever keg is low - $5 for a big glass of good beer.

The seahawk jello shot is the best jello shot you&#39;ll ever have in your life. Its got a cream layer that is insane. I think the waitress said it was a pina colada layer. My group bought out the supply last time cuz they are that damn good.

The food is AMAZING. Everything I&#39;ve had here has been noteworthy. Eggs Benedict is unbelievable. Pretzel with cheese is f&#39;ing crazy - slightly charred, just salty enough, and a cheese sauce that&#39;s like the tostitos brand cheese salsa Tom Douglas style. Brisket hash was great and had a LOT of beef in there.

The one negative is the place isn&#39;t really cheap. But it is definitely worth the money."

Perhaps it was an off night? Came here on a Sunday for Fried chicken night and their beer selection was off-the-charts awesome! $5 for kill the keg maui brewing company and $3 for oatmeal stout?!?! YES PLEASE! Their beer selection and prices are by far my favorite part and most likely reason for me to come back to Brave Horse.

On the other hand, their fried chicken&#39;s breading was underflavored and lacking punch. The pretzels that I&#39;ve heard people rave about was really just a pretzel (not sure if I&#39;m missing something about these reviews??). I ordered the peanut butter and bacon dip and it was totally unique and delicious. I was really diggin it at first, but as I ate more, I realized, well really this is just baconbits inside peanut butter. Novel idea, but not worth the lofty price.

On the mission for the best fried chicken in Seattle, I find myself at random places to celebrate oil, fowl, and a good dose of breading pretty regularly.

This review will read like a celebrity poll in People magazine. The graph will go up and down. 

First, no problem with the seating; communal seating to me is just a way to get to know people--even if they&#39;re wishing they could be anywhere but sitting next to me ;) We got a large table that sat 10 of us, but I ran into that situation where I wasn&#39;t sure who was part of our group, and who was an interloper:

&#34;Hi! I&#39;m CP! Is this your first time here for chicken dinner?&#34;
&#34;Um..hi...I&#39;m dude and dudette.&#34; 
&#34;Hi dude and dudette! Wow, I&#39;ve heard great things about dinner here: have you been before?&#34;

*crickets chirping*

It then occurred to me that they weren&#39;t part of our group. Gah. So me. All the damn time.

Anyways, we all ordered the chicken dinner and our waitperson HELD ALL 10 ORDERS they had left in the restaurant for our table; they pulled off the Sunday chicken dinner special menus from EACH table, just to make sure our table got our orders!

Okay, so serious service awesomeness aside (that carried on through the evening) we got our orders:

The chicken was really, really GOOD! Again, not over-brined/seasoned, I felt like I was eating chicken from my Granny (she also made outstanding butter pickles) but the sides--except the corn--fell flat for me. The beans were radically undercooked, and the bread was grocery-quality bread. 

Ooooh, but that CORN. Yes, sir; that was good eating there! Nice seasoning but still fresh-tasting. It hit the spot! The breading on the chicken is medium-breading, and was crispy and seasoned right too. But...the portion was way too small. $14 when the chicken and corn were the star of the show...I expected a better bang for my buck.

Oh, and the Bravehorse beer that is supposed to be like Manny&#39;s? It&#39;s not...like Manny&#39;s...

I&#39;ve been in twice, and the service was better this time around, the food had definite highs and lows, but that good service...I&#39;ll come back any time for it!"

Only $2 + tax (9.5 sales and 12.5% SEATTLE PARKING TAX WHAT THE FFUUUU??) No matter, still good for Seattle parking. Oh, forgot to mention the parking is in an underground garage. PLUS!

We ordered lots of food but what stood out were definitely the fried cheese curds. They were great and I would go there again just to eat friend cheese but I&#39;m not a huge fan of their burger selection. 

I&#39;m pretty sure I got a rad stomach ache from their steak tartare. I should have known better to get tartare from the same place that serves &#34;tots and shots&#34; on their menu. But don&#39;t get me wrong, it tasted great. Just be aware. 

Service was odd. They kept clearing our table which I can see how that sounds good, but they kept taking our forks away and then didn&#39;t bring any back. It must have been a slow night. 

All-in-all, I would go again for a group drink night."

I&#39;ve been once on a happy hour date when the place was packed with Amazonians and the like and once late on a Friday as a last ditch effort to find life in SLU before heading elsewhere. It was still kicking with large groups of people just out to have fun, which I love. They do shut it down pretty early, but definitely check it out during the day or in the evening!"

The food is mediocre and tasteless, unless you want those seasoned tots (yuck!). They won&#39;t take orders at the table in the trivia area, causing a mad rush at the bar when there is a 1 minute gap between rounds. It wasn&#39;t happy hour and charged me 2 different prices for my drinks ($7.50 and then $9.50). They also didn&#39;t print out a receipt for me until I pestered them about it, and when they did it had someone else&#39;s order on it. My friend was over charged to an obscene degree for a $1.00 pint and 1 Cheeseburger. We will never come here again, and unless you want to be treated like they wish they had no customers, you shouldn&#39;t either."

It wasn&#39;t terribly packed and I am a big fan of Tom Douglas so it was a pretty easy choice for me when it came to where I wanted to go. I really like the interior because it&#39;s spacious and I have a strong love for wood grained table tops, etc. I think I had high hopes because I am a big Tom Douglas lover....and that&#39;s where it all went wrong. 

I saw the words pretzel cinnamon french toast and was super intrigued because...that sounds weird. I opted for it and asked the server what the jersey pork roll was and if he would recommend it, he said it was good. I put a lot of trust into my servers, so I let him sway me. There were 4 of us in total and it took a really long time to get our food. The place wasn&#39;t super busy but there didn&#39;t seem to be many servers working. Finally, the food came and I&#39;m pretty sure I had a &#34;wtf&#34; look on my face because the portion was huge, like massive. I&#39;m talking the french toast was half the thickness of a Harry Potter book. I didn&#39;t immediately dredge my toast in syrup, I actually cut off a piece first (BUT IT FELL APART because they were made with chopped up pretzels) it reminded me of monkey bread. I didn&#39;t finish it and found that dredging it in syrup made it a little better. The jersey pork roll was....not something I would ever get again. Everyone else enjoyed their dishes...maybe I just didn&#39;t luck out. One of the comments about my dish was, &#34;this is different...it&#39;s not bad.&#34; 

Also, it took forever to get our check. Unfortunately, I do not see a reason to come back. At least Mr. Douglas will still be getting my business when and if I choose to visit his other establishments that I enjoy (serious pie, dahlia lounge, and palace kitchen)."

Even with the crowd, we still got good service though. We tried the wings, which were cooked perfectly, as well as the sausage and cheese which was surprisingly flavorful. I also couldn&#39;t resist and ordered a side of tots. The seasoning they toss them in make it that much better."

We came here for dinner during the summertime, and opted to sit outside in the patio seating. Some of the tables are communal picnic style and it was pretty busy that day, so we ended up sharing a table with another party. People were friendly, so we didn&#39;t mind too much.

I loved the food and drinks! Yum! The brick oven pretzel was amazing. We tried all of the above dips including pimento-cheddar, sour cream and crispy onion, smoked peanut butter and bacon. So good! We also ordered the pork loin schnitzel. The pork was juicy and well cooked. It was tasty and went well with the slaw and bun. I loved the variety of beers on their drink menu. They also have a selection of whiskeys. 

Service was quick and prompt. They managed to seat us and take our orders quickly, even though they were busy that day.

Overall, I was impressed by Brave Horse Tavern. Food is delicious and we had a lot of fun. I hope to come back soon to enjoy more handmade pretzel goodness."

We started with some cheese curds which were tasty, but I&#39;ve definitely had better fried cheese (best fried cheese curds in town belong to Cutters Crabhouse).  Still good, just room for improvement.

Then I had a pretzel with pimento cheese.  I love pimento cheese usually, but this was pretty meh.  I ended up eating the pretzel with the mustards which were AWESOME.  I recommend you don&#39;t bother with other dips and just use the mustard.

And lastly I had some of the sweet potato fries - yum yum yum!  Fantastic, would eat again.

Will return!"

The pretzels that they make in house are delicious. They have a variety of toppings to accompany them but I recommend the bacon peanut butter-sounds crazy but combines the best of sweet and savory. They also do amazing sausages.

On this last visit we had both the pretzels and the deviled eggs. OMG, best deviled eggs I&#39;ve had, at least as far back as I can remember. 

This is basically the Amazon bar, especially on Friday evenings. Happy hour is usually packed, and every so often there is an intern there holding a space for the rest of his team to come down. It can sometimes be a challenge to find a seat, but with enough patience and creativity, I&#39;ve always found something. 

Staff has always been friendly, although on this last visit, it seemed like the beer runners were a bit off. We&#39;d get some of our beers, and not others, sometimes many minutes between half of us getting a round and the rest of us receiving our tasty beverage. Don&#39;t know what was up with that, but fairly minor. 

Their beer list has a ton of local and near-local stuff on it; many things I&#39;ve never tried before. Had an excellent Vienna lager this last time, which you can&#39;t find many places. For beer lovers this is a great place, but then again, many places in Seattle are these days."

Tasty gastropub fare: 

- Oven-fired pretzels are excellent - pretzel combo is ideal for sharing (2 pretzels, 3 dipping sauces - love the bacon peanut butter)
- House-cured ham &amp; cheddar pretzel sandwich - comfort pub fare at its best
- Seasonal (summer) strawberry shake served with strawberry fritters is a tasty treat, fun to split with a friend
- Burgers are average, served neat, on the smaller side
- Pastrami hash is super heavy, wasn&#39;t obsessed with this.

Happy hour Mon-Sat. 4-6pm features $3.5 draft, $6 seasonal cocktail, house bubbly $5. Shuffleboard, darts and Amazonians on tap."

The girlfriend and I went while visiting Seattle; it was recommended by a food blogger. As soon as you arrive it&#39;s full of atmosphere, looks and feels great. There are long communal tables but since it&#39;s just the two of us we got a table for two by the front facing window. We had burgers, beef for me and salmon for her. I did not have the salmon, as it is well known that the French word for fish is poison and I do not care for poison. The burgers were excellent but the fries were not. They are very thin and well cooked, making them very crispy and well done, as well as generously doused in salt. If you like crispy fries you may enjoy them but we did not. The staff was excellent, friendly and provided great service. There were also some dart boards and for some reason shuffleboard tables, which were in constant use."

Has a decent sized patio, large dining area, extensive beer and cocktail menu, friendly and helpful staff, 2 shuffleboard tables and 3 dart boards available, decent overhead music. Happy hr twice daily; 4-6pm and and 9pm to close. Food is pretty good; my fav are pretzels with spicy dip, fried chicken sandwich, and the turkey sandwich is freaking awesome!

Cons: Closes at midnight, happy hr menu is dismal and only includes corn dogs, pretzels, and a few of the cheaper beer options. Typically busy and loud during happy hr after work due to the Amazon folks, which makes it not fit for an intimate date if you wanna actually hear. 

Overall it&#39;s a cool mid range priced bar/restaurant that&#39;s more upscale than a dive bar, and less upscale than fine dining."

I tried to order a drink at the end of the bar where I was sitting and the bartender wave me down to the other end, like she couldn&#39;t come over to me. The place wasn&#39;t very busy and there was no reason to make me chase her down. I also had waitress bump into me while I was playing shuffleboard and got upset at me for not seeing her.

See my previous reviews of the Columbia City Bakery, Heavenly Pastry and all my pics from girls trips to Leavenworth.  I smile wider than the pretzels I&#39;m holding!

So I love that Bravehorse gives you several choices of big, soft pretzels to choose from, along with the different types of mustard or apple dipping sauces.  
Also my favorite drink was born here: The Tumbleweed!  It&#39;s Iced Tea Vodka, Triple Sec, lemon, and delicious.  

I enjoy the comfy black stools, the shuffleboard games, the music, the clientele, and prices are reasonable!  Great date place.  So basically, an easy 5 star for me!  
Thanks Brave Horse.  --OH and you have awesome bar name."
