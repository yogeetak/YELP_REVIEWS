I only got food to go so I can&#39;t comment on the service. I ordered the gyros platter which comes with lamb, beef, veggies, tzatziki sauce plus rice, soup, salad, and pita bread. If you think that sounds like a lot of food you would be correct. This was definitely a full two meals. I really liked everything EXCEPT the lentil soup. The soup was this weird pureed texture that had a rather canned taste to it - I would not be surprised if I learned this was canned lentil soup. But hey it was free so I&#39;m not complaining too much. The meat on the other hand was delicious - very moist and flavorful! The rice and veggies were also seasoned very well. 

If there weren&#39;t so many amazing food places to try in Seattle I would probably come back to get my Mediterranean food fix. Just don&#39;t get the lentil soup!"

We came around early dinner (5pm?) and it was empty. I was surprised. But that was good for us. We ordered the bekka wings, the lamb/beef gyro platter, and the north african chicken. Our orders came with a warm lentil soup, salad with their amazing garlic dressing, and PITA, YUM! The pita was warm and tasted actually house-made. Not sure if it was, but it was good. &amp; tell me why they didn&#39;t even charge us when we asked for more? How sweet of them!!

The bekka wings are AMAZE-BALLS! I don&#39;t know if this place is the same as Mediterranean Kitchen in Bellevue, but it was pretty similar food/menus. These wings were just like the one in Bellevue. Tender, soft, juicy, fragrant, and so damn delicious. Ugh, I just wanted to pretend I could eat all 6 or 7 wings to myself. But after the apps, I could only eat 3. It was so damn good especially with the yellow rice. Loved it. The drizzled sauce on top was creamy, a little garlicy, and all sorts of tasty. I want more of that sauce! The plate also came with hummus, which was personally, not my favorite thing. But my brother liked it.

The gyro platter was probably my favorite dish because it was super tender and flavorful. It tasted how it should. Gyro meat is probably my favorite if done right. This one was definitely done right and they give you generous portions! I am definitely getting that platter next time. 

The north African chicken was so good. It tasted either Moroccan or Egyptian, but I couldn&#39;t tell. It was good though. It had this amazing smell, I&#39;m thinking cumin? Not sure, but the spices were so tantalizing. The sauce was amazing and the chicken was so tender and the veggies on the plate were perfect. Everything seriously had me mesmerizing. Yumm!

Overall, good food, great service, and the ambiance is pretty chill. Price range is pretty fair, around $9-$14 for a generous plate. They check on you often and ask you if you like their food and definitely accommodate you to perfection. Only sucky thing is the location because of parking. Otherwise, go there!"

Solid Mediterranean place! Went here on a weekday evening around dinner time and it wasn&#39;t crowded, had an attentive waitress, and one chef that has definitely mastered the art of timing plates!

We ordered the baba ghanouj, chicken shawarma, and the bekaa wings. The baba ghanouj and chicken shawarma were pretty standard in my opinion-all the flavors you would expect, bold spices and topped with tahini over buttery rice. The bekaa wings were AMAZING. They were juicy, full of flavor and charbroiled to perfection! I made a mess of myself gobbling them down... You get 6 full wings, drizzled with garlic sauce, on top of a bed of rice.  The garlic sauce is a little tangy, so it can get a little overwhelming towards the end, but these dishes are big enough to save half for later and be completely satisfied for both meals. Would definitely recommend and return for this dish. I haven&#39;t seen this anywhere else yet but it may be because I haven&#39;t been looking until now.

Both dishes also came with lentil soup, a small side salad with homemade dressing and pita."

Sam and Nael were able to modify a couple of the dishes, so that the entire spread was dairy free and gluten free (except, of course, the pita). Many of the guests raved about the food.

We ordered the North African Chicken and the Combination Kabob.  The North African Chicken was tender and the plate was layered: rice, chicken, grilled veggies, tomato sauce.  The Combo Kabob had beef, lamb and chicken kabob, each with its own unique flavor.  You can taste the grill on the beef and it is medium rare.  Smokey!  It also has a drizzling of garlic sauce.  The lamb is topped with grilled veggies and a thin tzatziki.  The chicken was seasoned and decorated in a thicker tzatziki.  Both of our meals came with warm pita bread, hot leek soup and a small salad with a garlic lover&#39;s dressing which was great because I had skipped lunch.  So the food tided me over before the entre.

We were hoping for Chateau Que Freire but the personable owner spoke to us about difficult it is to get suppliers to carry Lebanese wine right now.  The food has my husband reminiscing his days in Lebanon and adding it to our vacation wish list."

The lamb tasted off in the lamb Shwarma.  Not fresh.  Also like they tried to cover it up with an overpowering citrus marinade.  Just not good at all.  Also light on the lamb &amp; very heavy on the cabbage &amp; rice.  
The Hummus just tasted like straight Tahini paste.  No flavor.   Again, just not good.

The stated delivery was 45-75 minutes which I thought was pretty long. However, they delivered right around the 45 minute range.

In general, the food was good. I ordered the hummus, the gyro plate, and the chicken shawarma. By far, the gyro plate was the best! The lamb was cooked to perfection; not too dry or soggy with the perfect amount of spices. The chicken was also flavored very well along with the rice but it just couldn&#39;t compare to the lamb. I was disappointed with the hummus. I found it flavorless and I had much better hummus. However, they give you a lot of pita bread which was good. Lastly, the rice did not reheat well for a different day but the meat did.

I would come back here again for their lamb, just not the hummus."

It wasn&#39;t bad, but it didn&#39;t live up to its 4.5 star rating.

We came for lunch, and I ordered the Lamb Shawarma dish with a side salad.  Don&#39;t bother getting a salad - it is incredibly underwhelming.  As in, cut up romaine lettuce with one slice of cucumber and one slice of tomato on a small plate.  At least the salad vinaigrette was good.  My wife got her dish with a lentil soup, and that was a much better choice, in my opinion.  The Lamb Shawarma itself had good flavors, but they laid the tahini sauce on a little much, so it was heavier than I would have liked it to be.  The quality of the lamb meat was average - it was a little tough and chewy, but the lack of tenderness wasn&#39;t the only issue - I actually got some chunks of just fat in my dish.  A tad unappetizing.  I did enjoy the rice and grilled veggies, so that was a plus.

My wife ordered the North African Chicken dish.  She wasn&#39;t too pleased with it.  The chicken itself was actually good - it was rather tender and flavorful.  The rest of the dish was questionable, though.  The veggies were cooked in a tomato sauce, and I&#39;m hoping they didn&#39;t just take Ragu sauce and mix it with the vegetables, but to be honest, it kind of tasted that way.  While it wasn&#39;t terrible, it just wasn&#39;t impressive, because that&#39;s what we do at our home, and it tasted about the same.  If we return, it won&#39;t be for the North African Chicken dish.

The service, without a doubt, was superb.  The waiter was very friendly, accommodating, and answered all the questions we had.  Overall, our experience was a pleasant one, we just had higher expectations for the food."

I&#39;m not sure how pita is supposed to be, but they were incredibly flat which I didn&#39;t care for. The soup was alright (split pea), the salad was about house salad standards.

There were times when I used to get take out from this place once a week. Food was off the chart good, service was prompt, and the previous owners were so adorable! Just the matching &#34;garlic lover&#34; shirts alone were worth at least another half star! Unfortunately the good food retired with the owners in Lebanon.

The sauce, soup and rice are still pretty good, but the meat is awful. Not that it&#39;s bad meat or anything, but when lamb, one of the most flavorful types of meat, is dry and doesn&#39;t taste like anything, it raises eyebrows. 

I used to be a passionate advocate for this location against its cousin in Bellevue...sadly that&#39;s no longer the case.

I&#39;m used to there being other vegetables (carrots, potatoes) with it, but the cauliflower alone is pretty delicious too.

I&#39;ve tried several of the meals, and overall, I&#39;d say everything&#39;s pretty solid. All of the meat I&#39;ve tried is really tender; my only complaint is that they pretty much drown everything in sauces and condiments, and one of these sauces is pretty bitter. Unfortunately I&#39;m not sure which of the sauces has the bitter flavor. I&#39;d recommend asking for the sauces on the side.

Small, simple interior with a friendly greeting as I walked in. Only a few other diners there. Ordered the Chicken Shawarma, and was promptly given a tasty bowl of lentil soup and some flatbread to go with it. Then a nice crisp salad (mostly iceberg lettuce with a couple hunks of tomato and cucumber - all very fresh). The salad dressing was on the side (on the table with the salt, pepper, etc in fact) so I seasoned to taste. Pretty good dressing if you like garlic. Main course arrived before I finished the salad, and was a hearty plate! I&#39;m a reasonably healthy eater and I barely finished it. Then a cute little square of baklava came with the check. The food was very good, although if you don&#39;t like garlic, you&#39;re in the wrong place...

The salad was flavorless, with oil and vinegar and TONS OF pepper.

Service was good.  Just very disappointing.

The old couple are so friendly and inviting. The farmers plate is huge (i think 6+ wings) and tasty, as are the kebabs. The lentil soup, salad (such good dressing) and pita bread were great fillers for big appetites. They even gave us some baklava to end the meal."

The owner was extremely friendly and gave us plenty of attention, considering we were the only customers inside the place on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  I had their falafel which was bountiful, delicious, and perfect on top of a bed of lettuce, pickled veggies, and tomatoes.  I wish that next time, I would have asked for the tzatziki sauce on the side because it drenched everything.  Other than that, I enjoyed my dish very much.  He had the lamb gyro which said was a-ok, but couldn&#39;t top Mr. Gyro&#39;s.  His fries were naked with no feta, which made me disappointed, but I munched on them nonetheless.

Great bonus was that we received free generous bites of baklava for dessert.  They deserve an extra star just for that!

Solid place for delicious and reasonably priced Mediterranean food."

Right next to the Thai place (don&#39;t be confused like we were and sit down at the Thai place and then realize you&#39;re at the wrong restaurant). 

The inside is a little dated, and looks more like a sub par diner.  But don&#39;t let that discourage you!  It is amazing food!  Only been there for lunch, you can get a full (large) portion for 8 bucks!  

I&#39;m no expert on this kind of food, but the shwarma was great and the veggie combo interesting (and great too)!  Hummus on the plates for lunch was awesome too!  Split pea soup decent, salad a little boring (but dressing WHOA)!

Baklava at the end of the meal was a treat, and was a little square slice of OMG!"

I work a few blocks away and had no idea they moved to the First Hill location.  Walked there for lunch today and had the chicken schwarma.  It was loaded with that de-freakin-licious rice, juicy chicken, and perfectly sauteed onion.  The owners are friendly, and I have not a single bad thing to say about this place.  At $8 per plate, it is reasonably priced and some of the best food in the area. 

I intend on going back (regularly) and would like to also try the gyros and the farmer&#39;s plate.  

It&#39;s been just 3 hours since I was there, but I am already looking forward to the next visit.  YUM!!!!!!!!"

I had the Garlic Wings and it was a mind bending experience. These are far and away the best non-hot wings I&#39;ve had!!!! 

Try the &#34;Farmers Plate&#34;: bowl of tangy lentil soup, small lettuce salad and mind-blowing garlic wings over saffron rice accompanied with pita and your choice of baba ganouj or hommus (I like the baba). You will not be disappointed.

It has a great vibe, would be a great place to take a date to before dinner for a cocktail, and I&#39;ve always been impressed with their really creative list of cocktails. If you dig bourbon or mescal or gin (read: the strong stuff)- they have some super interesting concoctions on the menu.
Food menu is limited- but the small plates we&#39;ve had have been excellent. I love the chicken liver mousse and the warm Castelventrano Olives. Yum!

Really, what more do you want out of a local watering hole, unless you&#39;re in search of a dive, which OT is not.

The ambiance is funky and dark in the way a cocktail bar should be, and the music is upbeat &amp; sets just the right mood to keep the locals &amp; visitors imbibing throughout the night.

I get it...you&#39;re sitting there with your iPhone in your hand scrolling through the options in this neck of the woods and you&#39;re just not sure if that guy from a year ago that hated it can be trusted. Well, I&#39;ve been coming here on an almost-weekly basis for a year and I can tell you that the good ratings are legit and the petty 1-stars are well, petty. 

Why should you trust my rating? I write a lot of reviews, I was Yelp Elite for 4 years, for whatever that&#39;s worth, and I eat and drink like it&#39;s my job. I&#39;ve been fortunate to meet some amazing chefs and bartenders in this city and Oliver&#39;s Twist (including the Phinney Ridge location) is respected and enjoyed by many who know what they&#39;re doing. You can see lots of industry types in here enjoying some amazing small plates of food and expertly crafted cocktails just as easily as you can see the staff connecting with the patrons in a sincere and focused way. If you want to belly up to the bar and throw out an open-ended request like &#34;something with gin that&#39;s not citrus-y but is a little sweet&#34;, they&#39;ve got you covered. If you&#39;re less adventurous, they&#39;ve got a beautifully curated cocktail menu that will help you step safely out of your comfort zone (seriously, leave your rum and coke&#39;s at home). If you just want a beer or a glass of wine while your adventurous friend has a blast, they&#39;ve got you covered there too. Heck, one night I just didn&#39;t feel like drinking but love being there so I asked for a mocktail and I&#39;ll be damned if it wasn&#39;t the best non-alcoholic drink I&#39;ve ever paid for. The drinks are simply expert level, creative, and thoughtfully crafted and the bartenders are so talented that it doesn&#39;t seem fair to call them bartenders. No, I think from here on I&#39;m going to refer to them as cocktail artists. 

If you were lucky enough to visit Oliver&#39;s Twist when Jen was around, you will remember her uncanny ability to quickly get to know her patrons and like some magical bartending Pandora station, she could line up a series of drinks that would make anyone say &#34;that&#39;s the best ______ I&#39;ve ever had&#34;. If you&#39;ve been more recently and had a chance to get to know Nikki, you&#39;ve probably had one of the most relaxing nights of fancy but accessible rum creations, conversation like she&#39;s your best friend from years ago, and maybe even a few slow jams. I treat high-end cocktail consumption in the same way that my peers treat visiting an art museum. I slowly and mindfully observe and consume the unique art that each of these endlessly talented cocktail artists serve me. I don&#39;t mind the prices because I understand the care and dedication it takes to make something beautiful. If I only wanted an old fashioned I could make that myself. If i want a drink that can transport me to a place I&#39;ve never been, I come to Oliver&#39;s Twist.

I am largely motivated to visit by the fantastic drinks at Oliver&#39;s Twist, but I&#39;d be lying if I said that I didn&#39;t also come here for the food. Like others have pointed out, the menu is small but this isn&#39;t a restaurant as much as it is a hidden cocktail gem with a menu full of criminally underrated food creations by one of the most talented, humble, and exciting chefs in the entire Seattle area. The food here isn&#39;t a bunch of onion rings and queso (though there&#39;s certainly nothing wrong with that). The food here is almost tapas style, highly inventive, and somewhere between high-cuisine and down home. You can get chicken wings but they&#39;ve been confit&#39;d in duck fat and served over several house-made special sauces of mint and pickled roasted peppers and light cheeses. You can get a grilled cheese but it&#39;s pressed beautifully in a panini press and served with frothed homemade tomato soup (called a cappucino for it&#39;s presentation). You can even sometimes order some very fancy special items like last night&#39;s roasted squash with a homemade gochujang sauce, picked watermelon rind, and kimchi. Please don&#39;t try to act like those don&#39;t sound like the absolute best thing to nosh on when you&#39;re sipping on a beautiful cocktail named after a yacht club in Bermuda. I&#39;ve literally tasted everything on the menu and I certainly have my go-to&#39;s, but frankly the entire menu offers patrons a glimpse into the expertly honed craft of Dan Braun&#39;s culinary career. Unassuming and humble, Dan isn&#39;t flashy and worried about being on the front page of the local rag. He spends that time experimenting and creating some of the most exciting foods we&#39;ve ever eaten, and we&#39;re the kind of millennials that blow their money on vacations focused entirely on overindulging in ridiculous foods in any city we land in. He&#39;ll be famous soon, just wait.

When people visit us in Seattle, we always come here. When we need a date night, we usually come here. When we&#39;re just ready to unwind after a long week and catch up like we&#39;re in our own personal Cheer&#39;s bar, we come here."

The menu, with the trendy typeface, had elevated my expectations. But the pate and sliders both ho hum and the service a little odd. I mean the bartender advised that a bottle better deal than by the glass which was obvious but somehow made us feel cheap. The pâté served without green or other colorful garnish, like a turd on the plate. And the sliders? Buy the buns, heat up some Trader Joes pork carnitas and bottled BBQ sauce and voile: you have duplicated. Even the happy hour pricing: a dollar off, really? Wow!

Because we were having cocktails, we wanted some snacks.  Get the mutha effin&#39; popcorn!  I never thought that popcorn could be elevated to gourmet status.  Because that was so good we tried the paté (just say &#39;whoa!&#39;).  Then came the sliders.

For Ian, Nila and the others, trust them, they know their craft and will get you set up. Love the Last Word with Tequila, the New Pal, something barrel aged on site or whatever seasonal drink might be on the chalkboard. For food, my favorite is the Chicken Wing Confit, in moroccan spiced butter, mint feta and pickled chiles. Owner Dan even pickles his own fruits and veggies served with food dishes.

I drive a Ferrari, own a 5,000 square foot home on the water, have a beautiful girlfriend, own the Matrix trilogy on Blu Ray and iTunes, and a best friend named Kellan whom I&#39;ve grown quite fond of recently. But I have to say I was blown away with how fun the Waterwheel Lounge is. The last time I had a night this fun was back in March when Kellan and I bar hopped local country bars and line danced until 2AM.

First off, this place is more chill then Kurt Russell in 1982&#39;s The Thing and that movie took place in Antarctica so that&#39;s saying something. In addition, I would rather come here to drink and sing karaoke then stay home and practice my air hockey skills. That is also saying a lot. On top of that I would rather come here and hang out than sit at home on my PC playing Planescape: Torment to try and improve my level 99 dark elf&#39;s alchemy skill.

This is a great dive bar and the karaoke is more on point than Ryan Gosling&#39;s stubble. You should check it out. Or rent John Candy&#39;s Uncle Buck. Either option is splendid."

Why by myself? Because for EFF sake people LOVE KAREOKEING here. I get dragged here fairly regularly and I hear many, many different reditions of songs that should probably be left alone. Yeah, I&#39;m that girl making faces when you lose your nutsack hitting the last high C in your tinny Falsetto. Let Freddie Mercury rest. 

I prefer to sing loudly in the shower, in my car, to my dog, when I want to wake up my hungover partner. These are great times to sing loudly, I think. In a crowded bar? I&#39;ll pass. So that&#39;s why I can&#39;t say I love it here or I am a so-called FAN.

Here are some tips, because Yelp thinks I&#39;ve been here 7 times (and I&#39;ve been here far too many past that number): 

+ FRIES. They&#39;re some of the best in the city. True facts.
- The bathrooms are a little too close to comfort..the size of a closet and the &#34;doors&#34; are window curtains....don&#39;t you dare poop!
+TOTS WITH CHEESE STICKSSS (if you know anything about me you know I love tots)
-If you want to get on the kareoke list, make sure you&#39;re there early to put your name down. 
+Great bartenders with great vodka selection! 
-Occasional Friday nights become college night. If that&#39;s your thing, awesome, if not, you will feel very old."

The karaoke crowd was fun on the night we went, the service was really stellar considering how busy they were, and even though crazy busy, the bartender was totally cheerful all night.

Before consuming a couple of vodka rocks (karaoke juice, I like to call it), I had to prepare my stomach for the assault with some of their famous (?) fried chicken. It was pretty good, I must say. The vegetables on the side might have actually been my favorite part!

The karaoke selection was pretty decent, although I wished we were able to get into the rotation more than 2x. My homie had...enthusiastic fans dancing...singing...and just generally celebrating his karaoke with their bodies...violently...awkwardly...

Anyhoos, a great dive bar that you should add stop in and visit. They make savory crepes and hear they are pretty good. As of now, 3.5 stars fo&#39; sho. Fix up that bathroom, make a tasty crepe and I would def give up the other stars."

We were upset they ran out of ribs! We went there for the ribs because of the reviews from Yelp. They said they ran out Friday. 

Had a hard time finding parking, so we parked in the neighborhood behind the bar. 

We were there just before 5pm so it was just starting to pick up.

Since there were no ribs or brisket we had the :

Tattor Tots: Crispy and perfect with cheese according to my friend. 
Onion Rings: Over cooked and stuck to one another with a side of tarter sauce. Batter was smooth and brown. 
Fried Chicken: Salty and burnt. I&#39;m a southern girl so I drowned mine in hot sauce because I didn&#39;t like the seasoning which was burnt on. It&#39;s a half chicken by the way. 
Mashed potatos: Large size and with white gravy. What?! I like brown gravy with black pepper.
Mixed Vegetables: Peas, Corn, Green beans and carrots from frozen
Coleslaw: Creamy and vinegary

Drinks:

Buttery Nipple: Yum! Perfect finish to my meal. ($5.00)
Amaretto Sour: Sweeter than normal but still good. ($5.00)
Bud Light: ($3.50) My husband had this and said it was good. 
Diet Coke: Can&#39;t go wrong here. 

It was good for a Group On promo but I wouldn&#39;t go back. Maybe if you enjoy college age girls, jeans and t-shirt, Sports on TV and Fried foods.

So let me start by saying that I have been playing trivia in bars for 15 years and in several different states/cities.  It has been a longtime hobby.  The Waterwheel is a great place for trivia.

Good drink prices and the servers were generally friendly and seemed warm to the trivia crowd.

The host (I don&#39;t remember his name)  had command of the evening, he was funny and he did it without being a jerk. 

The questions were well written and I seemed like the bar average was about 75% correct which is good, no one wants to feel stupid, but you shouldn&#39;t get everything either. 

Great pacing - just the right amount of time to talk between questions.  It is great when a trivia host remembers that you are there for a social event with your friends and allows for that interaction. 

Right length - 2 hours, started at about 8:10 and done by 10:15  

The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars.... the regulars weren&#39;t particularly friendly and bordered on downright surly.  The other new team felt the same way so we just ended up interacting with them.  I prefer an atmosphere of friendly competition over sore losers."

One in particular involving getting up on bar stools and assisting those singing karaoke by belting out some Pat Benetar with my bestie on her birthday. Even nearing last call this place seemed like it could go on for a few more hours.  Everyone here is down-to-earth, fun and just as willing to act a little crazy with you. The drinks are a good price, it&#39;s always a good time and as far as dive bars go, you can&#39;t get much better than here. It&#39;s like home -- if your home involved many happy people smushed in one place playing bingo or singing karaoke. It just feels comfortable.

Word to the wise, ladies:  Don&#39;t make the same mistake I did -- If you enter a bathroom and it looks like a mens restroom, it is! Turn around and walk out the door and THEN you&#39;ll see the women&#39;s restroom!  Oops!"

Little did we know, we walked right in on bingo night and we were late... It was a bit awkward trying to find seats since it was pretty much a packed house but we managed to squeeze with three others close to the bar. Turns out we had unknowingly sat with the owner and her parents!!! It was such a nice surprise because we all started chatting while playing Bingo at the same time... and it&#39;s pretty cool because my bf got Bingo on his first try... and then a few rounds later, I won too! We were really lucky!

We got a free drink each for winning. It was definitely a nice introduction to our night. We then proceeded to ordering the pesto sandwich and fried chicken. I was super excited about the food because I heard great things about the chef and the menu. The pesto sandwich was fabulous and the bf really loved it. The fried chicken was HUGE... they really weren&#39;t kidding when they said that we&#39;d need a to-go box after eating.

Overall, the night was really fun and spontaneous. We got into a little trouble with parking since we parked behind the Pho Vietnam restaurant and apparently the owner gets really mad when people park in their lot... duly noted. Don&#39;t park behind the pho restaurant because they&#39;ll take down your plate number and tell on you. But we moved the car onto the street, no biggie.

Karaoke night started at around 8:30 pm and we stuck around for a couple of songs which was very fun and entertaining too.

Thus far, the Waterwheel remains relatively unscathed, and has even gotten better through changes in ownership/management and shifts in the makeup of their client base.

Inside you&#39;ll find your typical dive: dark, well-worn, and a faint whiff of the possibility of a booze-fueled fight breaking out at some point.  Outside, the beer garden is filled with picnic tables and a variety of backyard games and a ping pong table, all of which are in various states of disrepair.  The jukebox is filled with the expected mix of classic rock, hard rock, and a smattering of hip hop, pop, and other filler.

The service is generally pretty friendly, even for non-regulars, but can quickly turn surly if you start straying into unwelcome behavior territory, which is exactly what a proper dive bar requires (although the level of service for non-regulars is a bit exceptional).

Apart from that, what else is there to say that hasn&#39;t been said?  Unpretentious karaoke, cheap stiff drinks, pre- during- and post-game drinking and revelry, and decently greasy and affordable pub food, all wrapped up in an old school divey package for your (not too) low brow enjoyment.  This place is dangerously close to my house, so it&#39;s a good thing I have a couple of young kids to keep me honest and at home most evenings."

Some of my co-workers and I recently started trying to do a weekly happy hour, and I joined them for a Waterwheel one time.

First impression was... &#34;This feels very back-yard frat party!&#34; We loved the astro turf. Note that none of those are BAD things to us... Just not what we are used to in a venue or something we were expecting to find!

It was happy hour and apparently bingo night. We had lots of fun playing. We started off with one of those super-tall beer tower things... but I didn&#39;t have any from that. Not an IPA fan, and that&#39;s what the person ended up picking. I ended up having 3 Hoegaardens (and taking one red-headed slut shot with the team- ugh! Never trying that one again!) instead. I also had some tater tots and they were quite tasty. They had some amusing prizes that I never won, probably because I lost the focus to keep playing after about 1.5 beers.

The outside area is new since I was here last and it is awesome.  Great for those warm summer nights.  There&#39;s a beanbag toss and plenty of tables and benches for sitting.

The only downside was the karaoke.  I LOVE karaoke and there was a great selection of songs, but it took eons for the two songs I sang to rotate through.  I wouldn&#39;t have been able to sing another song if I&#39;d wanted to because it took so long in between turns that it would have been last call before I could get another one in.  The lady who was running the karaoke also wasn&#39;t particularly friendly and clearly did not like the choice of songs that I sang with my boyfriend and my friend.

For a variety of reasons, we took a week off and joined the crowd at the Waterwheel. The Hawks lost, but we consider it win for us!

The food is a standout. While the menu for breakfast isn&#39;t extensive, it is abundantly tasty. The pulled pork scramble sent me over the moon: tender, moist meat - and lots of it - hugged by scrambled eggs and perfectly sauteed onions. My entree could have fed the entire table, and if my mouth hadn&#39;t been eternally full, I&#39;d have offered to share. Friends shared the green chile and cheese scramble with equal satisfaction. The more traditional bar fare: tots, fries, and wings were also delicious.

Perhaps most impressive was the bartender, Tess. She single handedly managed the entire bar for the duration of the game with speed, skill, and a smile. She made it look easy. It couldn&#39;t be easy. She balanced new orders, making beverages, delivering food, and keeping everybody in the lively and enthusiastic crowd content like a masterful conductor.

I went here off of a recommendation from the Stranger because it was a staff pick. But just avoid if your young. This isnt even a dive its worse its a dog house. 

The crowd there was probably only enjoyable if you were 40+. Its a dark hole in the wall spot and I wouldnt recommend it. 

The lady serving at the bar was prompt which was nice and she greeted us which was good also but aside from that and the cost of our two drinks I would say if your in your 20&#39;s avoid this hangout and go a little farther south to Ballard.

It was karaoke night (maybe that&#39;s every night?) which I&#39;m definitely a fan of as well. The wait to sing was very long but the crowd got into most of the songs which always makes things more fun. I had fun singing Creep by Radiohead... a personal fave. It seemed like they had a good selection of songs and the KJ was engaging. 
I was enjoying a nice glass of water as I was driving but my friends who ordered drinks said they were strong and the prices seemed reasonable.

Tucked in off the street on 15th in Ballard, the place is pretty unimposing. Inside is a typical bar setup. I gathered that this is the place regulars go to meet up and catch the football games on the weekend (I was there on a Saturday).

I chose the breakfast burrito with hatch green chili cream that was on the menu, but had the sour cream and cheese held due to my dairy allergy. The chef, Ramon Shiloh, personally came out to see how I wanted it prepared and welcoming me to the lounge.

As I waited for my food to be prepared, I drank my coffee and observed the &#34;regulars&#34;, finding it comical that some were so tipsy by noon that a cab had to be called for them. The coffee was quite good for a dive bar, too. There are various TV screens mounted around the bar and many were watching the college football game.

When my burrito was brought out, my eyes got big as I saw the crazy-large size! I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever be able to eat it all, but it was so darn tasty, I couldn&#39;t stop myself. The burrito was filled with eggs, sausage and potatoes and covered with that green chili and herb sauce. All the flavors melded into something that was exceptional to taste. It was spicy hot, but I love it that way!

So, put away your prejudice against dive bars and lushes and head over to the Waterwheel lounge for the weekend brunch....it&#39;s so worth it!"

It is, as described, a charming dive. No cider on tap, but they have the Strongbow in the tall cans. Burger was pretty delicious, though dirty fry oil meant the fries were not so good. Seems to be a common problem in places--is fry oil all that expensive? &#39;cuz dirty fry oil ruins perfectly good food. Everyone is so nice there, and the bartender was nice enough to honor my expired Groupon at face value (I thought they HAD to, but she said otherwise).

We came to check out the Wednesday trivia, and it was not all that impressive. All four rounds were themed, and very much geared to a younger crowd. Very few general knowledge type questions, more along the lines of &#34;Musicians with the first name of Chris&#34; and &#34;sports movies&#34;. This was my first time playing at a place that uses a trivia service, and I was not impressed. I&#39;ll stick with homegrown trivia elsewhere, and hopefully my next visit to La Waterwheel will be on a clean fry oil day!"

A grimy, locals bar that didn&#39;t quite feel like Seattle.  It feels like walking into a trailer park or something, with a fenced in smoking area out back.  They were BBQing the night we were there, and made us out of towners feels totally welcome.  We came for the karaoke, and well, stayed for the karaoke.  The KJ knew what she was doing, and even acted as a bouncer when some drunken fool got out of line and was dry humping a girl.  

There was a good mix of people, a couple of dude-bros, but otherwise a pretty happy and fun loving crowd.  And the drinks were cheap.  

I will be back here when I visit Seattle again, until then, I guess I&#39;m going to need to get my fix of semi-nasty, out of the way, karaoke bars."

It&#39;s easy to miss though. We literally drove past it (despite having an address in hand), did a U-turn, and then had to look very carefully before realizing we had arrived. It&#39;s tucked in a bit from the street.

The chicken wings came highly recommended so decided to go with wings - half regular, half spicy. Glad I was able to do half and half since the spicy were too spicy for me (and I can take some heat!!) and it was sopping in the sauce which I didn&#39;t like. The regular wings were definitely better than your typical wings at a bar - crunchy, flavorful, and not soggy. Boyfriend had their special of the night and found his meal to be too salty. The drinks were super cheap (under $5!)...couldn&#39;t believe the prices, but then again, I don&#39;t go to many dive bars so it may be on par with other places. It was a Friday night so by the end of our meal, Karaoke started!! What?! Hilarious and unforgettable at the same time."

Seriously, how can you go wrong with BBQ, towers of beer, and best of all..karaoke?!

First, the food.  Delicious and devoured, although I have to say I&#39;m a bit biased because I didn&#39;t touch their barbeque.  My friends scarfed down the pulled pork sandwiches, however, so I&#39;m sure it was a hit.  I enjoyed their ginormous nachos as well as tater tots and was plenty satisfied.  Pair these with their stiff drinks and you can say HELLO! to bringing on the drunk karaoke!  The crowd was easygoing and fun and even when my gals and I got a little carried away with our singing, we still got some love from everyone.  Staff was super friendly and helpful.  

Note to self: Tower of beer will certainly bring down the house next time.  On my checklist."

Where to begin? How about Karaoke! Not only do they have Karaoke on both Wednesdays and Sundays but it seems that the Waterwheel has become the new venue for Yelper birthdays. This is in no small part to the Karaoke host who always gets the house pumped up with suicide Karaoke songs and wild introductions to the next singing victim. 

Slap into that equation, the owner of the joint (Stu) who ensures the drinks are stiff and that the food is sizzling and good. Tara, one of the bartenders is cool and very friendly. There&#39;s never an empty glass in front of me longer than a minute and it&#39;s never a task getting efficient and fast service. 

Out of the various places close by to stop in and have a good time, I&#39;d put my money on the Wheel as the best of the lot.

The karaoke selection is pretty great and in the past the bartender has done a few numbers while he works which is always impressive.

 I got the fried chicken.  The waitress told me it was going to take a half hour to make so I knew it would be good.  It tasted just like my grandma&#39;s blackened skillet fried chicken.

This pretty much sums it up: I was having a spectacular time sitting on their outdoor patio drinking cheap, tasty cocktails and playing bingo with my friends until a fellow patron made us feel so uncomfortable we decided to leave abruptly. (His comments immediately took my five-star experience down to the unrecognized zero of the Yelp scale.) Unfortunately, this rushed exit also meant I had to forgo my rightfully earned &#34;free shot&#34; for winning an earlier round of bingo. Dammit. Double negative. (In this case did not equal a positive.)

Although that situation (the patron&#39;s rudeness, not the loss of my free shot) cast a very negative shadow on my overall experience, it was in no way the fault of the Water Wheel or their staff and should not affect their rating here. I spoke with the owner and bartender immediately after the incident occurred and both were genuinely concerned, apologetic and friendly, which everyone in my party greatly appreciated. 

In conclusion, outside drinking and playing bingo makes a pretty awesome combination. After all this drama I feel the Water Wheel deserves the chance to earn a fifth star (and a review update) on a future visit. So if the fates allow, I&#39;ll be there on Tuesday ;)"

I didn&#39;t, though, and I can&#39;t imagine there will be some bias here as the Waterwheel is now owned by my good friend Stu (who also plays drums in my band, Stay Tuned).

Stu is one of those few people who discover an opportunity to pursue a lifelong dream and regardless of the amount of work, loss of sleep[, and lack of time to practice with the band,] he pursues it. He&#39;s a killer bartender and a savvy business man, and would love to make his professional life the Waterwheel [and hopefully the band, as he&#39;s an amazing drummer as well. Come see us some time, you&#39;ll agree.].

So, having never been to the Waterwheel, but hearing often about it during practice, me and a few friends headed down to check things out.

Cue to the theme song from Cheers (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8IZfR08S1o), seems like a place where the locals know each other&#39;s names. Stu has been raving about the Waterwheel&#39;s food, so we came hungry. We had the Cheeseburger dip (think like a French Dipped Sandwich, but with a cheeseburger), chicken fried steak, and a regular old burger. We also saw someone having the roasted chicken which looked fricken good. The food was like comfort food, tasty and heart-attack rendering. :) Fries were a bit crispy, but Stu mentioned that was on the list of things to deal with. We had pitchers and/or bottles of beer, and regardless of the place being reasonably full, we still got them pretty quickly. Service was friendly, decor was unique.

And the jukebox... it&#39;s been a while since I paid attention to a jukebox. In fact... I don&#39;t think I ever have. My friends are music-philes and put $10 in, reserving about $4 for me. Selection was pretty good. Rare you can hear Steve Miller &#39;take the money and run&#39; back to back with Curtis Mayfield&#39;s &#39;Freddy&#39;s Dead.&#39;"

...Imagine then you win some money via inheritance--oh, that sweet, sweet Aunt Margie, rest in peace! 

...If you don&#39;t have Aunt Margie or your family members tend to live up until they&#39;re 100-years old, then you got the extra money because you just asked for a Quick Pick as your change at the gas station&#39;s mini-mart.

...Don&#39;t dream too big.  The extra money isn&#39;t that much! Well, it&#39;s enough to buy a house and make some remodeling.  Happy now?

...You decide to buy an old but charming house in Ballard.  After paying for it, you still have a bit of the money  left to make your dream of &#34;I want a hole-in-the-wall-in-my-house&#34; a reality.  You have an unfinished basement-dungeon underneath those 90-years old original hardwood floors.  Better place?  Impossible!

...You sit down and visualize how you want it.  Then, magically, you&#39;re transported to the Waterwheel for ideas, beer and karaoke.

That&#39;s what the Waterwheel is about.  I felt like entering into the &#34;bar in the basement&#34; of a good friend&#39;s house.  It&#39;s a warm, friendly place where Alex the bartender, sings along some tunes while he&#39;s serving you a pint.   If you ask him, he will be happy to mix a Cosmo for you (he told me he likes to be asked for a specialty drink, &#39;cause he doesn&#39;t have much chance to make those).  Needless to say, libations here are on the cheap side of the moon!

The karaoke selection is large, large, large.  From Motown and hairband Rock to Enrique Iglesias and The Hoff, you&#39;ll pretty much find the song you have been craving to sing for ages.  You can even dance when someone else is singing: there&#39;s space enough to shake it to the raspy voice of a Michael Hucknall wannabee.

We had a wonderful time during the Pearl Jam Karaoke night our dear M&#39;lady Katie hosted.  Even thought not everyone sang to the tunes of the legendary band, we had fun listening to a varied selection of musical choices between those.  Yelpers and non-Yelpers (Garrington, man!) kept returning for 5 more minutes of fame.  

That night I discovered, after two years dating The Dude, that he LOVES karaoke and that he can do a killer impersonation of Eddie Vedder.  I wish I could be a bit bolder, so I could have a &#34;Tom Jones fervent female fan&#34; moment...! Second place in the karaoke competition can give you an idea of my man being good (and hilarious).  Fellow Yelper Heather F. and her pretty voice got the first place.  Our friend Garrington came up third.

Karaoke is not the only form of entertainment available at the Waterwheel.  They have a pool table.  The have TVs with your favorite games on.  They have plenty of great bar conversation.  The incredibly sweet karaoke gentleman--very a-la-80s in his gray suit--will sing for you from time to time.  

Waterwheel feels like home.  In these times of general tribulations, this is one of those places where you&#39;ll successfully wash out any pains and worries.

Just ask for a pint and grab that microphone.  And make sure you can reach Marvin Gaye&#39;s highest pitch!  And afterward, get your butt back to your basement...good luck trying to recreate such a wonderful place!"

The decor is totally tacky, shower curtains instead of doors on the bathroom stalls=somewhat effective, but the atmosphere more festive than one can imagine in a place like this. -The staff are beyond efficient! - Super service and lots of fun. 
Basically typical bar food &amp; menu, until you order from the specials menu.... It quickly turns into a nearly exquisite culinary feast! Delicious, nearly gourmet, and inexpensive! The drinks are strong and cheap, and the crowd friendly, so watch out.
For an appetizer Chef Ramon personally presented a new twist on Eggs Benedict: the egg sat atop a fried tomato on top of a sliced roasted green chili. - Truly a scrumptious melt in your mouth flavorful experience. After a few mimosas and fireballs, we shared a delicious fry bread taco w chili cheese sour cream, etc. with the group. Also at the table I tasted other sides that were on other specials... The mashed potato, with sautéed mushrooms &amp; sun dried tomatoes, parsley caramelized onions, etc. everything amazing! 

Gotta&#39; have more next Sunday!"

Made my way to see what the hype was about, before hitting the Baranof. This bar tries really hard to be a dive..but somehow does not quite manage the feat.

Too many fratboys..too many girls with the reese witherspoon do...not my scene. I could see where if there was a yelp event, it could be fun, because all it takes is 20 people in there, and its a crowd...

There are just too many other options from queen anne to greenwood, that I would rather hang out at..."

My bad!

I just can&#39;t control it. Like the full moon to the werewolf, something in the music-lyrics-beer combo turns me into another person entirely. Add in Cousin and her bag-o-tricks (i.e. percussion collection) and it&#39;s all over. 

The greatest thing about karaoke at the Waterwheel was that the karaoke-master didn&#39;t get pissed at us and make us put it all away. Dudes at the *other* places in town (cough-Ozzies-cough) apparently don&#39;t like their patrons to have a good time. No such snobbery at the Waterwheel.

Let&#39;s see, what else was so great about this place? Well, for starters, when I ordered a Mack-n-Jack from Stu (owner), he offered me space to place my face right under the spigot. I declined, but still appreciated the offer. The fries we ordered were super good too! AND, just in case you feel a little hefty after the beer and pub grub, there are two exercise bikes out in the back to burn off some calories! You know, in case you&#39;re not comfortable making a spectacle on the dance floor (like yours truly)."

One of my best friends used to live in a condo right across the street and I can&#39;t believe we never ventured here, we sure missed out!

I came here for my first time for the &#34;Singing for (your) Change!&#34; yelp event. I walk in and this place is packed, granted it&#39;s a rather small place, but it was like sardines in a can in there and I&#39;m not complaining! I would rather be in a packed bar any night of the week then sit awkwardly an empty bar, the more the merrier I always say! :)

The bar tender was a really cool, friendly and very attentive dude. Granted I was sitting at the bar but he was always there with my next drink when I wanted it, no waiting! He even got into the karaoke and sang a few songs, which weren&#39;t too shabby if I remember correctly. 

It was nice to see some yelpers I knew and a few new faces too! This is a fun bar with a great atmosphere and I&#39;ll be sure to check it out again, definitely if the yelpers host another event here!"

&#34;HELL YES!!!!&#34;

Okay, I have only imagined the inside of this place, and was so excited to see it for myself. Plus, I&#39;ve never actually  played &#34;professional BINGO&#34;. To me, professional means using a dauber (commonly known as a daubbie). I was so excited! BINGO goes from 5:30-7:30 and the place gets PACKED! Good thing we arrived at 4:30. Let me tell you, it isn&#39;t easy to eat a brisket sandwich AND pay attention to BINGO... especially during the lightning round. I&#39;m just not that coordinated. 

The MC is hilarious, the staff is super nice and there were lots of regulars. I can see why! You can either choose a prize or get a free shot (did I mention that BINGO is free?). I didn&#39;t win, but thought I did once- oops! 

Yes, the Waterwheel is pretty much the definition of a dive bar. Fun and unpretentious, with ample people watching opportunities."

It is true what they say, when Yelp takes over this place becomes a mad house (in the best possible way!) 

I can&#39;t tell you how nice it was to be at a place where I feel totally comfortable! Bonus was that almost the entire Yelp crew was so fantastic. I was introduced around and forgot most of the names by the time I finished my second Mac &amp; Jack. It&#39;s almost the feeling of coming home to a big group of friends...friends I had never met, but friends none the less. 

Karaoke was divine! I was able to witness the &#34;Rick Roll&#34; that I had heard so much about...there was some interesting dance moves displayed on the floor, and once again TONS of song choices! I think one of my favorite things about this place is the bartender singing and bartending... that is really downright amazing! 

I saw most of the same regulars I had seen the weekend before. Maybe I saw too much of them though, I happened to witness some lovely purging going on in the ladies restroom. This was probably 1 of 2 not so nice things that I witnessed/was part of during the evening but I am not going to put that as a negative on the bar...only the people involved. I did manage to get an apology from the girl who yakked in the bathroom...she said it had been a hard day. :-( I understood... 

I officially love Yelp events...especially here. I drive by often, and really like the folks who work there and run the place. Can&#39;t wait for Stu&#39;s Bday bash... I will be there with bells on!"

*  Drank some very good beer.  Mac &amp; Jacks on tap!
*  Helped Don celebrate his B-day and Trevor &amp; Jessie have a killer last Seattle event.
*  Unsuccessfully attempted &#39;Street Spirits (Fade Out)&#39; by Radiohead on karaoke.
*  Pretty successfully tried out &#39;She Don&#39;t Use Jelly&#39; by The Flaming Lips on karaoke.
*  Kicked &#39;Punk Rock Girl&#39; by The Dead Milkmen&#39;s ass on karaoke.
*  Watched people play Wii bowling for their first time.  It&#39;s always funny seeing people Wii it up for the first time.
*  Got licked in the face several times by the most hyperactive dog ever.
*  Heard good (for the most part) karaoke of songs I&#39;ve never seen available in karaoke before.  Very wide range of songs to choose from.
*  Had a blast with a crowd of happy fun Yelp and non-Yelp folk alike.

Sundays here are going to be fun from here on out.  Karaoke and Wii.  Powerful combination.  Go.  You&#39;ll have a great time."

This place is fun! On the outside it looks totally divey and is interestingly hiding behind a restaurant but on the inside it is totally cool.  I ordered a dinner salad and french fries to eat - the salad was plain but much bigger than expected and the french fries were delicious!  Kind of like the ones at Dick&#39;s only a little thicker... very good.  My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and he said it was great as well.  To drink, I ordered the $3 Sunday night special - the Mimosa (delicious) and he ordered the Men&#39;s Room Elysian Beer (which they had on tap).  All in all a really great experience, and I can&#39;t wait to bring my friends there! Also.. The groupon was worth $25 and with it, our final bill totaled $2.  So the price was right!"

Bartenders are on their game and very friendly and can pour a stiff drink.  

Ping-pong, pool, rockband/guitart hero and poker nights make this a great draw.  Hell, they have a drunkie-bus to home Seahawk games too.  How can you go wrong with that?

Just a great and unassuming spot to hit up for some beers/drinks with friends and really enjoy the evening."

My first visit, I had a close encounter with the best smelling yelper I know and a Sharpie.
Second visit is a blur, because it was Party Bus time!

Third visit, was for Don L.&#39;s birthday party! After the fun time at the Rickshaw, karaoke was something that was gonna be for his birthday, and I had just found out they started doing it at the Waterwheel....but...could they do it on a day when we could do the party?!? Oh hellzyeah! Wil was a wonderful middle-man between me and Stu and Stu was more than accomodating and happy to have us crash his place for the party. 
Rumor has it the Waterwheel will now be sporting Wii bowling and karaoke every Sunday in honor of the &#39;late, great&#39;, Sunset Bowl, so be sure to check them out!!!! Don&#39;t make me cut &#39;ya, GO!

What a freakin blast Don&#39;s birthday was! Just about everybody sang (you songless people know who you are, sit and cry in your cheerios at the shame of it all!), and the songs were just as fun. You never knew what someone would pick next!

My karaoke debut consisted of trying to sound like a 12 year old girl for Don&#39;s rendition of &#34;Teenage Dirtbag&#34;...thanks to the free-flowing alcohol I somehow managed to get up there 3 more times.

HUGE props to Sarah for joining me for &#34;Faith&#34; and for gyrating on the floor with me to &#34;I touch myself&#34;, I could not have done it w/o ya lady! =)

*Single Tear* for Jesse&#39;s &#34;Leavin on a jet plane&#34;, and ^5&#39;s to all the yelpers I drug up there to sing with her, you and Trev are gonna be sorely missed lady! I mean it, Greyhound, $40, I&#39;ll be waiting at the station!!! ;-)

I&#39;ll run out of room if I try to highlight the entire night and all the fun that we all had, so I&#39;ll leave more up to everyone else&#39;s reviews.

First off, the food is great! Be sure to get the friend chicken. Probably the best in Seattle. The vegetables were pretty lackluster but the mashed potatoes, burgers, and all were top-notch. The mashed potatoes and gravy are pretty decent, as well.

The biggest problem is a serious lack of seating. Not nearly enough chairs for everybody who was there and finding a table was very difficult. Half of the bar was taken up by a band. Maybe a better layout is in order so you can have more seating for customers while the band is setting up.

It was a bit of a wait to get a drink. I was standing there for a while before I was helped. But they brought all the food and drinks out to me when it was ready. i&#39;d say the service is a bit slow but they definitely want to make you enjoy your stay."

- karaoke and wii bowling on sundays

Then friends mentioned they had gone to this dive bar in Ballard with karaoke called the Waterwheel and I didn&#39;t believe them. Until one day I passed by and saw what appeared to be a shanty in the back of a parking lot off of 15th. Awesome. My friend just became an MD so where else to celebrate than stiff drinks and a singing bartender? Huge claw footed bar stools surround crowded tables where the bar is the center piece. Karaoke is serious business here (Fridays and Saturdays) - I joked with the bartender if he was going to sing, and he did. Sang the first song, sang while he served drinks, serenaded our new Doctor, and even managed some dirty jokes at our table in between.
Drinks weren&#39;t too bad - stiff and on the cheaper side -the highlight being what I called &#34;The Tower of Power&#34; - European style clear towers of draft beer.
Its nice to have a dive place like this with so much personality when Ballard is becoming more and more gentrified."

The first thing you will notice is how super friendly the staff is and they are genuinely happy to be of service. This really goes a long way, especially in the ultra competitive world of food trucks.

I ordered three tacos and a tamale which was more than enough food even though I was very hungry at the time. When they asked if I wanted cheese on my tacos, I pictured a light dusting of cotija cheese but what I got was a healthy dose of shredded cheddar cheese layered over the top which was fine even though not quite what I was expecting.

One of the things I really liked about this place was the selection of hot sauces which actually do range from mild to really hot rather than from really mild to sort of zesty. When I asked if the hot option really was hot, the lady got very serious and wanted to make sure I understand their sauce was no joke and not to be taken lightly. This, of course, made me very happy and more than willing to add a decent sized dose (not too much!) to my tacos. To me, it really was the right amount of spiciness although nothing that would make me run around in circles screaming for mercy."

There&#39;s a number of meat selection as well as tacos/burritos variation that will suit your liking.

There prices are reasonable, and I&#39;m still amazed despite so many years since I first tried this truck, prices hadn&#39;t really gone up all that much. Today, my colleague and I grabbed 2 lunches and 2 soda, and the cost was just shy of $16. Really good, tasty and filling meal.

Seattle REALLY LACKS in Mexican food. Thank god for this food truck! 

The tacos are really good with soft tortillas, your typical street tacos. I would say the best is probably the Asada or pastor. The lengua was good but not as soft as I usually have it in CA. The chicken was a little try for me. And the prices are really good for what they offer. 4 tacos for $5, pretty good deal compared to other places here. I haven&#39;t had anything else besides the taco, but my boyfriend ordered a burrito and it looked really good. 

I love their tomatillo sauce (the green one) on the tacos. So many sauces to choose from! Definitely THE BEST Mexican place in Seattle. Bummer they only have a food truck and not a restaurant here T__T"

It resulted in a disappointing discovery: Mexican food seriously lacks out here. Heart wrenching for a girl that eats tacos multiple times a week.

And then... I found this gem. 


I&#39;m all about that pork. Carnitas and al pastor were perfection. Cilantro, onion, spiced pork. That&#39;s all you need to accurately judge a good taco. Pork was not greasy, but super moist (ya. I said it). And they include limes without you requesting!!! I know. So great. 

All the sauces were tasty. 

4 tacos for $5. Quite a steal.

I don&#39;t normally get chicken but it&#39;s a good barometer for how good a place is so I usually get it on the first visit to a restaurant to see how much care they put into it. This chicken appears to be of the boiled and shredded variety.

BUT, it&#39;s not bad. I&#39;m biased because of living in AZ, but I still say that the Tacos El Asadero food bus is the best in Seattle. Since it isn&#39;t mobile it&#39;s not hamstrung by the King County food truck laws that require meats to be precooked offsite first in a commercial kitchen.

Prices are decent: tacos are $1.50 individually or $5 for 4. $1 extra for avocados is decent. But 50 cents more for cheese?!

I&#39;ve been there only twice and both times had the most disappointing lunch. Today I ordered a chicken burrito which is advertised as coming with beans and rice. In high-brow, culinary review terminology, it frickin sucks. There are no beans or rice. Just chicken in a big old flour tortilla. About 17 lbs of dry, unseasoned chicken. The best way I can describe the flavor is &#34;like 17 lbs of dry, unseasoned chicken in a big old flour tortilla.&#34; I can&#39;t remember what I got the last time I was there (over a year ago because it was so terrible). 
 
What the hell am I doing wrong? Is there a secret In-N-Out style menu I don&#39;t know about? Do you only get beans and rice--and seasoning at that--after you&#39;ve logged a certain number of hours in line? I thought about going back and asking them to beef it up or give me something different but I&#39;m not sure how receptive they are to that and, obviously, there are 10,000 hungry stressed out Amazonians in line now.

The lengua is has great flavors and melts in your mouth. It doesn&#39;t have the weird texture or flavor that some places do. The carne asada was really good too. The carnitas was my least favorite. It was dry and just not that great. 
I do have to say, moving here from San Diego, I know my Mexican. The super burrito lacked it&#39;s super size. The burritos are Chipotle are easily 1.5 times bigger. But you can&#39;t get a tongue burrito at Chipotle. Anyway, overall this place has OK prices, considering the super popular SLU area.

Overall, I absolutely love this taco truck. It has great pricing, quanitiy, and taste! It tastes just as good as the other taco trucks and mexican restaurants that I have been. 

Fav Dishes/Hints: $5 for 4 tacos (usually get the spicy pork and chicken, i do love lengua, steak, and pork/carnitas as well. The other great deal is $6 for the quesadillas (i get mine with chicken, comes with beans, rice, veggies, etc.). They also have great hot sauces as the usual taco joints, only catch is that the food doesnt come with radish for some reason?). The take credit cards but add a charge for using it. For my meal, it&#39;s $.25 but I usually take cash, there&#39;s a Chase nearby on Westlake.

I go here typically 1-2 times a week for lunch which requires trolley ride, and fair walk.

After being here 50+ times I have had the tacos every time, and 90% of those times were the steak tacos. When I find something I like, I stick with it until it does me wrong. These tacos haven&#39;t done me wrong!

Small flour tortillas, fresh tasty steak strips, onions, and fresh cilantro. They pack in a couple limes to juice over the top. The lime + the hot sauces they offer are the money combo."

My favorite are the tacos... 4 for $5.  Authentic and simple street food.  Choice of marinated and grilled meat (including beef tongue?), cilantro and onion in two corn tortillas, baja style.  A wedge of lime for each pair of tacos - I highly recommend adding a squeeze... it really makes the dish.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever waited more than 2 minutes from order to eating.

Now, it is abundantly clear the staff thinks the experience is all about them and not the patrons. Yesterday, during a very good and very close Seahawk game, the Main Bartender, kept turning off the sound on the TVs and putting on his own mix tapes. It was very clear he was itching to blast his music. The thing was, then he would go back to bartending. It&#39;s football, and not all time breaks are the same length. So the game would come back on and we&#39;d be hearing Biggie instead of the game. At some points 3 or 4 playes would happen before he put the sound back on, and then only after we kept flagging down waitresses to ask. He was clearly getting pissed...at us! Just leave the sound on! People who go to watch the games don&#39;t mind commercials. We certainly don&#39;t care for your stupid music! Due to a lot of resistance, he stopped doing it during the middle portion of the game, but by the fourth quarter, he took on a F*** it attitude and went back to doing it, and appeared to be mocking all the patrons that earlier complained. He kept saying to his friends seated at the bar &#34;what, I can&#39;t hear you over the sounds of the game!&#34; whenever he put it back on. Are we missing something here?!

The worst part is, there was a manager there. He was sitting at a table with friends nearby, and didn&#39;t seem to mind the patrons all around him getting annoyed about the experience his staff was causing. That is never a great sign. I was happy to see the entire bar empty as soon as the game ended. The managers should know that people used to always remain around afterwards, just hanging out. Not yesterday, people all got up and left. For us, we didn&#39;t want to give them any more of our money after clearly not caring about our experience and then mocking us for it.

Servers are hard-pressed to keep up with the constant demands for a small variety of local and standard beers. It may be a better idea to send a runner to the bar and bring back drinks rather than wait for harried staff to find you. Not many drink specials. 

TVs are everywhere, so no matter where you find yourself, there&#39;s one with the right game nearby. They have local and non-locals games, and the TVs are high quality ones that you would expect in a sports bar. 

Clean bathrooms, even on game day. 

Parking is hit or miss on weekends. There;&#39;s a nearby pay lot, but its worth cicrcling a bit for free parking.

Per square foot, I think LTD has the most TV&#39;s I have seen at a sports bar. That is a major plus when  enjoying a sports bar.  It does get cramped for big games. Finding seats for your group might be a challenge, but finding a TV won&#39;t be.  For the numerous TV&#39;s and playing audio for big games, I would recommend it. However, as a bar alone I don&#39;t think I could. 

The prices and drink sizes were higher than I was expecting. I asked for jameson straight. I got a measured 1-1.5 oz of Jamie for $7.75. I&#39;ve been to craft cocktail bars with cheaper shots of Jamie. I&#39;ve been to sports bars with more generous pours.

But I do wonder how the owners actually feel about this. I recently went here and asked what IPAs they had on tap and I couldn&#39;t quite hear and understand what the bartender had said because of how loud it was so I took a guess at what a lot of what the other local bars are serving as IPAs (Pfriem IPA to be exact) and apparently I was wrong.  That&#39;s cool, it happens; so she then proceeds to ignore me and serve about 6-8 other people as I patiently wait. As I wait, there was a group of people next to me; one of which didn&#39;t have proper ID and she asked for it again saying that people under age couldn&#39;t be in the bar.  Well, the gentleman ordering all of the shots some how convinces her that everyone was of age without the person in question actually showing their ID again and they all go on their merry way with their shots.  I then let the bartender in question know that I would still like an IPA, but that it was loud and I couldn&#39;t quite hear the IPAs she referenced to.  She then told me and I let her know I had a hard time hearing her again, and she again proceeded to ignore me and serve other people.  I have never been treated this way and frankly it was completely unwarranted.  I understand that people can be under stress at times and maybe act ways that don&#39;t necessarily reflect who they are as people which is why I patiently waited for her to try and serve me again, but fool me once, shame on you - fool me twice, shame on me.

It&#39;s a chill sports bar in Lower Fremont with lots of TVs -- enough said. I came by after the Oktoberfest 5k to watch a game around 11am, so I wasn&#39;t trying to drink much, but the server was cool about the table ordering coffee (so I compromised and had her add kahlua to mine hehe).

I also opted for some jalapeno poppers for lunch. A little pricey ($9 i think) for an appetizer but they were good. There was a good portion of jalapenos, halved and filled with cream cheese then wrapped with bacon and deep fried. LOL but they were good. Served with sweet chili sauce which piqued my taste buds.

A friend ordered the chips and salsa and those were a hefty portion and the salsa looked homemade. I also tried someones fries and they were pretty decent handcut fries. Anywhoo, I&#39;ll be back sometime."

Yesterday afternoon I arrived with my temporary ID (DMV issued - able to work everywhere else) and was told it would only work if I had the hard copy to back it up. Hard copy? Isn&#39;t that the point of a temporary? I don&#39;t have my actual license. After that, I was asked to leave. Couldn&#39;t even order food (just food). I had to leave immediately.

Then I thought about it and realized this same thing happened to my boyfriend with his PASSPORT last fall. What&#39;s with them? These are govt issued IDs. A license is all that cuts it?

This is very disappointing because otherwise I love LTD. They have great food and the Michigan State crowd is a lot of fun. I wish they&#39;d get it together. I&#39;m pretty sure they just lost my business."

If I had more time and with less of a crowd I would have ordered some food or tried out the shuffle board and pool tables, but as it was, this was still a fun place to hang out.

The bar staff was really good and got drinks out quickly even with a mob of people trying to get their attention. We never had to wait very long for the next round so that was really cool considering some places will have you waiting 10-15 minutes between the time you step up the bar and when you finally have a drink in your hand.

I am looking forward to coming back here so I can try a few things off of the food menu which I have been told is actually really good. As far as sports bars go, this seems to be a pretty solid option."

It wasn&#39;t super packed but had quite a few people. We found a seat and one of the girls from our party went up to order a round for us. Well she stood at the bar for a good 10 minutes while the bartender served every male around her. She finally got tired of it and started waving her hands around. When she orders, the bartender demands to see more ID&#39;s since she asked for 4 glasses for our pitcher of beer. 

I start to walk up there with my ID when bartender just waves her hand and says never mind. Umm, ok. 

Round 2:

My hubby goes up to the bar to order another round. We&#39;re thinking okay he&#39;ll get served quicker because obviously Miss bartender prefers men. NOPE. He again waits for 9-10 minutes for service. The only reason he finally was served was because the lucky guy next to him that got picked to be served made a comment about my husband being next. 

He orders a pitcher of beer and watches the male bartender pour it. Now anyone in the bartending business should know how to draw a beer out of a tap. This guy puts the pitcher under the tap and walks away. He tries to bring it over once its full with about 3 inches of head on it. My husband asked for him to get rid of some of it. Attitude again. I&#39;m sorry if we are paying $15 for a pitcher, there better be more beer than head in there!

I don&#39;t know anything about the food there but as far as customer service they are severely lacking!"

It seems like it&#39;d be a decent sports bar during the week but on the weekend it appears to have fallen prey to the same crowd of bros that descend upon Fremont because Belltown has become too busy. 

A few of my friends got there before it became packed (which, according to them, happened in the blink of an eye) and saved us a couple of seats. Unfortunately, it was at the island in the middle of the bar and we spent an hour being jostled and elbowed in the back. The bar was three-deep and we couldn&#39;t hear ourselves think, much less hold a conversation. The crowd was college-y and bro-y. After an hour, we escaped to Dad Watson&#39;s, where we could actually sit, talk and get drinks in a timely manner."

DURING THE DAY. During daylight hours (and not during football season on the weekends), it&#39;s a relatively sleepy sports bar, with lots of tv&#39;s and a good selection of beer on tap. The service can be hit or miss (last time I was there, the bartender shrugged and wouldn&#39;t turn around when I ordered, but he was replaced at 6pm with a super friendly guy scurrying about). The food is basic pub food -- burgers, friend stuff, nachos (it was funny to hear the cook who was running food out describe the 7-step process involved in his double-baked nachos).

AFTER DARK, however, beware. It&#39;s like a Jekyll and Hyde movie. Douchebags and frat boys come out of the woodwork -- their poison: the devil&#39;s brew. Watch out for loud cheering over pointless shuffleboard games, fights over looking at the wrong lady, and lots and lots of backward hats. 

So, sports during the day: SAFE.
Anything at night: BEWARE."

I&#39;ve never even been drunk in this place, so I know it wasn&#39;t anything I did. I don&#39;t think he got the memo that a bartender&#39;s job besides serving drinks is all customer service, and if he wants a tip, maybe he should read that memo.

They got a smoker and are now serving smoked pork, beef, ribs and turkey, all of which are amazing and perfectly done.  l have now had the dirty fries, the seafood chowder, the bacon-wrapped poppers, the nachos, the beef dip, the turkey sandwich, and the Reuben.  

The dirty fries are definitely a worthwhile try; the gravy has some of the homemade pulled beef in it that makes them so much better, and if you&#39;re one of those people (like me) who loves fries with gravy, you&#39;ll be happy, trust me.  The chowder is OUT OF THIS WORLD; it has several different types of seafood (clams, cod, shrimp, and tuna), and they don&#39;t skimp on any of them; the shrimp are pretty large, and they throw a few on top for good measure.  Along with the cilantro aioli and parmesan, it&#39;s perfect.

The poppers are self-explanatory and need no extra applause - how can you go wrong with bacon-wrapped poppers??  The nachos are fucking huge, and aside from the fact that the meat is smoked, the cilantro aioli rocks this dish, so order extra.  The beef dip is your basic dip with smoked pulled beef, and if you order it philly style with peppers and onions, it&#39;s the perfect addition to make the whole thing come together.  The Reuben, again, is a Reuben (the only tweak on that is a spicy Thousand lsland), but homemade smoked corned beef definitely knocks it up a few notches.  But the smoked turkey, holy HELL.  The smoked turkey is absolutely DIVINE.  First, it comes on artisan bread that they throw on the grill with cheddar so it adheres to the bread, which gives it a great crust and extra flavor.  l&#39;ve always been a fan of smoked meats and BBQ in general, but there is something about this particular smoked turkey that is so goddamned good l can&#39;t stand it.  l went in yesterday and was informed they were out of the turkey for the day and damn near cried.  The rest of the sandwich is kind of your standard club (though you should *definitely* order it with avocado), but because their ingredients are so fresh, it&#39;s just delicious.
l should also mention that, at $10 a pop, these sandwiches are GARGANTUAN.  They are definitely two-parter meals, and l honestly have never been anywhere that had sandwiches that big unless there was some kind of eating challenge attached to it.  l plan to add updates as l work through the menu.

Other than all that, this place is great for the sports fan.  Much of the staff has been there since the place opened, and all of them are prompt, funny, and laid back as hell.  lt&#39;s a great spot during the weekdays and happy hour when the place isn&#39;t too busy and seating is available.  lf you plan to go on weekends -or certain game days- get there early, because this place gets PACKED OUT.  l would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for killer grub and a decent spot to watch whatever game you&#39;re looking for.  And you can&#39;t go wrong with a pool table and shuffleboard."

For the women&#39;s game, on a weekday afternoon, the place was busy and boisterous, but the service was on top of their game and it was a good atmosphere, even with the US loss.  As the game crowd evolved into a happy hour crowd, it settled back into a casual, Fremonty vibe. and all was well.  Just another day at the neighborhood sports pub.

For the men&#39;s game, on a Sunday afternoon, the place was packed to the rafters with hockey fans.  We arrived 15 minutes before their typical opening time and found people already staking out tables.  It didn&#39;t take too long for it to become apparent that they were understaffed, with one guy behind the bar admirably struggling to service the rapidly swelling crowd.  Some guys came out of the kitchen, looked around the bar and commented that the bartender really needed some help, and then went back into the kitchen rather than actually pitching in while the cavalry arrived.

By the time additional staff showed up, there was a pretty big backlog of drinks and food to deal with that really didn&#39;t get sorted out until well into the game.  But once they did, things ran more smoothly.

The scene was very different for the men&#39;s game, with more of a testosterone-fueled atmosphere that resulted in some spirited cheering and chanting, especially with a respectable Canadian contingent in attendance.  Unfortunately, with the heartbreaker OT loss some of the US fans, well-lubricated after three periods of drinks and sport, became less sportsmanlike, prompting many of the Canadian fans to quickly take their leave after the game.  But that&#39;s hardly LTD&#39;s fault.

Either way, I suspect LTD has now managed to become my new go-to place to watch a game, although I doubt it will ever be more than that for me."

That&#39;s how I felt about L.T.D.

When I first walked in I was like, &#34;effing great&#34; in a sarcastic way.  Sooooo many flat-screens and that giant jukebox and the potential for some really douchey clientele - these things all had me on edge.  But then my server was a sweetheart and there was this cute dog sitting in one of the bar stools watching the ball game with his people and I relaxed a little.  

I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich (plus tomato of course) and a basket of the mac n cheese wedges to share.  My dining companion ordered the hot dog without onions.  I was impressed with the grilled cheese - too often grilled cheese at a bar is a giant slab of cheese on two weak slices of bread.  Now, I like cheese as much as the next person, but sometimes it&#39;s just a little over the top.  Not so at LTD - the ratio of cheese to bread to tomato was perfect.  

My friend really enjoyed his hot dog and we were entertained by the mac n cheese wedges.  These aren&#39;t like the fried mac n cheese squares that you see at Icon Grill or the mac n cheese sticks down the way at Roxy&#39;s but instead look almost like chicken McNuggets, only inside they have what could pass for Kraft mac n cheese.  It&#39;s not the kind of thing that&#39;s usually my eating style but they&#39;re a great thing to find on a bar menu!  

One wall had two fire-house style roll-up windows.  I asked if those would be open in warmer weather and my server told me that they&#39;re planning to build a deck and have the windows open so the deck will be like an extension on the bar space.  I asked if she was worried about frat boys coming in and wrecking the chill atmosphere and she said that they were hoping to enforce a &#39;no douchebag policy.&#39;  

I hope she&#39;s right and they can manage that because I&#39;d really like another place I can count on to get a drink in my neighborhood! They have locally themed cocktails named things like &#39;The Lenin (aka: The Commie Kazi)&#39;  How can I resist something like that??"

I could understand if the bar was packed and no one could hear the game....but there were a ton of open tables.

You&#39;ve got another bar entirely devoid of character which would be at home in any godforsaken strip mall in the country.

The food, though from a pretty typical bar food menu, was ample and better than average.  This was particularly gratifying because I had so much time for my hunger to mount while waiting for service.   The web site offers the features &#34;Long Shuffleboard Table, Pool, GoldenTee 2010, and an insane Jukebox.&#34;  Maybe I&#39;ve been spoiled by so many great new bars in town, but when one of your top four attractions is a golf video game, I&#39;m not likely to be back often."

I will update my review when I go a second time and actually get what I ordered (after 2 returned plates to the kitchen) so until then the food is unmentionable. That said, the service needs to improve but the Bloody Mary was very good.

So this morning, I had to drive to work in downtown and decided to stop in. OMG, I am so happy I made this my breakfast stop this morning! So worth it! An hour after I got into work, I was wishing I bought more breads and pastries from here!

I ordered:
- crunchy cream (DELICIOUS! Like a fried doughy thing covered in crispy cornflakes and sugar and there&#39;s custard in the middle)
- miso katsu sandwich (this was more delicious than I thought it was going to be!)
- plus for ordering the sandwich and getting a pastry, I got a free drink

I was fortunate enough to find some of the green tea melon pastries still on the shelf.  I love these!  They are not too sweet and are soft and moist inside and not to hard outside.  I also purchased several pastries to take home but they were eaten before I could take pictures of them. The green tea matcha roll is good as is the peanut and jelly although there is no peanut butter in it. 

If you decide to eat inside there are two very long tables with benches.  One bench has seating on two sides and the other can only seat on one side. 

All of the staff were very pleasant and I think I met the manager or owner who was very polite.  I was pleased to see how nice and friendly everyone was.  I like going places where the staff are happy with their jobs.

Finally remembered to make it over to the far right lane on Elliot and turn into the parking lot of Fuji bakery! Yay! 

Immediately greeted by two very happy and friendly men. I told them it was my first time in, and one of the guys got very excited about it. Everything in the cases looked delicious. I decided on the green tea melon pan, salmon brioche, and the guy behind the counter suggested I also try the crispy custard or crispy cream (can&#39;t remember the name :-p). 

I had just had breakfast with a gf, so I thought I&#39;d save these yummy things for later... Nope. As soon as I got home, I decided to take just ONE bite of each pastry. About 20 bites later, everything was gone. So much for will power and being too &#34;full&#34;. 

The Green tea melon pan was incredible. The green tea flavor was just right. It was soft, yet crispy and flavorful. The salmon brioche smelled sooooo good. The brioche was so buttery with a tad of sweetness to it. The salmon inside was a little salty, but it balanced the flavors of the brioche very well. My favorite was the crispy cream (thank you for the suggestion kind sir!). It was sweet but not overly so, it was chewy and the corn flakes were so crisp and delectable. The cream was smooth yet light. It definitely reminded me of malasadas at home... Mmmm. I&#39;ll be back again for sure... Not too often though, or I&#39;ll be making my own muffins...

The lady serving me was very nice and informational (I had a lot of questions). The only thing I was disappointed in was that the macaroon I got (french roast coffee) was extremely bland.

Of course, all the pastries and sandwiches are amazing. Many of them have Japanese flair with flavors such green tea, red bean etc. They may not have the widest selection but it&#39;s big enough. I am not sure why people are complaining about it. Yes, they also run out of stuff towards the later part of the day and I&#39;d rather run out than over-prepare, ending up selling the stuff next day or throwing it away.

Never over-crowded, always smiling service. Seating and drip coffee available. Highly recommended."

Curry beef Roll. Canadian bacon and potato, Pear custard tarts. Orange and chocolate pastry, brandied cherry pastry, pineapple custard pastry.

No, really. They have a smoked salmon brioche--in cube-form. 

And, it was SO good, bursting with smoked salmon, surrounded by a rich and buttery brioche. A surprise visually and taste-wise. I dropped a little piece of salmon on my gear shift, and popped it in my mouth without even thinking about it. My car is filthy, so this should horrify you. 

Most prices for each piece ranged from $2.50 - $3.50 and were so beautiful, they make Columbia City Bakery&#39;s pastries look like Sysco food product by the can.

Raspberry coconut cream, grape/cream, chocolate cream, strawberry cream pastries...and my new FAVORITE dessert. No sh*t. As in, my favorite until replaced by something else. The orange cream pastry. A slice of sugar-boiled orange, dipped in chocolate; the orange slice was so soft, it seemed almost fresh consistency-wise--but the rind was soft, sweet and edible. It didn&#39;t have that chewy candied fruit texture at all. The cream...the half-dip of chocolate...BLARGH.

The croissants are interesting and tasty as well! Green tea over chocolate, raspberry chocolate cream, and the baked cream-topped almond croissant...Man, I can just look at them and picture what they taste like...but it&#39;s so much nicer to put in your mouth. The croissants overall are not as good as CCB&#39;s, but they&#39;re worth a try :)

The service was nice; very smiley, but I was pretty animated as I browsed the selection. It was small, but quality. 

I&#39;m looking forward to heading back! I love they have their own parking lot too!"

The selection seems to be larger and more abundant then the ID location.  It&#39;s also easier to find parking here as there is a small parking lot beside the shop and ample street parking.  We arrived early and the cases were full of all the treats.  This is a Japanese bakery so there is a definite Japanese aesthetic applied to the baked goods.  I was absolutely smitten with the crunch cream filled doughnut.  It wasn&#39;t too sweet but had great contrast in textures.  The selection is so large, you will have to make multiple visits to try everything.  My friends, that is not a problem.  They also do bread, cakes and macarons!

I&#39;ve visited three times and consistently my favorite are the Diamond Head. Pineapple puff pastry deliciousness. Second is Fraise = strawberry and pistachio puff pastry awesomeness. My son says their pain au chocolat rivals Café Besalu. Pastries are treated so regally - use of tongs and placed on a platter before placed in a pink pastry box. 

Remember this pretty much works as a commissary for the Seattle/International District and Bellevue retail sites. So depending on the time of day - you may have plentiful choices or a tiny selection. Their product line speak volumes and fairly priced for its quality."

I like the fact that they have their own parking lot so you don&#39;t have to park on the street. The space looks pretty new, and the pastry case runs the legnth of the store. I ended up getting:

Bacon epi: this was my favorite, which is a twisted bread roll with bacon in it (can&#39;t go wrong with bacon).

Salmon brioche: this was just ok (salmon was dry).

An apple and a pear tart: both pastries were good, not too sweet.

Regular croissant: this was nice and flaky.

I like the fact that the pastries have a Japanese touch to them, which makes them less sweet. If you are driving down Elliott Ave., Fuji is worth stopping by."

I had driven by this spot over a dozen times and always been curious but never bothered to stop in. From the outside, it doesn&#39;t look like much - like a small warehouse that happens to have automatic sliding glass doors and a plain sign with the bakery&#39;s name on it in a very simple font. 
I parked in their small free dedicated lot beside the bakery and hesitantly walked in, completely prepared to turn around and walk out...  
[eyes widened]
The shiny cases displayed a huge selection of unique pastries I had never seen before and some that were familiar. I eagerly scanned the cases: a salmon pastry in the shape of a cube, large selection of French macaroons, cups of creme brûlée topped with meringue, red bean and green tea flavoured pastries, they even had panettone! 
It was like you took the best bakeries from around the world, mixed them up, and out popped Fuji. 
I brought home a selection of goods, all of them were great but the cornflake crusted cream filled sugar doughnut is by far one of the most impressive things I&#39;ve eaten in months. Crunchy on the outside, with a layer of chewy dough surrounding the creamy middle. 
They have sweet, savoury, meaty, and vegetarian baked goods - something for everyone.

The building itself is relatively unassuming and reminds me a bit of a factory outlet bread store. There is a small parking lot which is great because I&#39;m not a fan of parking on such a busy street. This location is bigger than the one in the International District. Aside from the long, glass cases that showcase the fantastic yummies, they have a really great table. Yes, a table. There&#39;s a long, wood table that looks like it seats about 8 people and I love looking at it when I&#39;m there. 

The staff members are friendly and helpful. They are patient with me in answering any questions I have. On this last visit, I grabbed the homemade orange dipped in Belgium chocolate. Thanks to Cynthia L. I&#39;m hooked on these and honestly, I can&#39;t say how much I could eat. If they had an eating contest for these, I&#39;d be in - carbs be damned! For $3, it&#39;s a slice of a smile that makes me feel like I had never tasted pastry before. The orange (and the rind is the best part) dipped in chocolate is something that I think everyone should experience at least once. 

I&#39;ve had a number of other things like the vegan olive stick, croissants, and tons more of fruity, custardy topped goodies. All fantastic!"

The only thing to do, in that case, is to locate some eats on the way to your destination and try very, very hard to forget about the morning&#39;s trauma. Enter Fuji Bakery.

I was a little surprised to step in and see...maybe only a dozen pastries. Not a dozen kinds: a dozen. Total. For being their commercial kitchen this seems like an oversight. I snagged a croissant for immediate eatings and then got a box with a couple bacon epis, milk sticks, almond croissants, etc. to contribute to the beach picnic. My brother then got pretty much the rest of what they had available for the same reason. 

I&#39;m not sure why, but the two girls in charge of packaging and working the register could simply not deal with the fact that we wanted to pay for our hauls individually. Rang it up as one transaction - we asked if they could just split it down the middle. Much furrowing of brows and staring at the point of sale system. No, was the final decision. So we asked if they could void the transaction and just ring up our separate items as we had initially anticipated. More furrowed brows. A cautious &#39;yes&#39;. We detailed which items we had each selected. Dull panic started to take root in the girls&#39; eyes as they continued to ring it up incorrectly. By now this transaction was transitioning my headache/nausea into an overwhelming urge to scream. I gave up on trying to be rung up correctly and paid for whatever nonsense mish-mash had been tallied and left, grateful to finally get into the open air.

The pastries were, of course, amazing. Everyone loves the bacon epis and milk sticks because what is not to love? Our box of goodies disappeared fairly quickly, everyone raving and wanting to know where we scored such a delicious haul. But because this location is not generally personally convenient, and because the selection was limited, and because of the supreme tooth-gritting incompetence, I&#39;m probably not going to come back unless someone throws up in my shower before I head to Golden Gardens again."

They don&#39;t have a lot of the items that they used to carry (boo..........) I got a curry bun $3 and it was awful (and I love curry) and a poire $3 was which was ok.

It&#39;s been long overdue. Based on the other two locations (Bellevue and International District), I expected something similar - a small den of zen. Unfortunately, from the outside, this place looks more like a factory than a bakery w/ some parking spots next to it. Even the automatic sliding door doesn&#39;t make it less factory-ish.

Now onto the goodies. They have a decent selection of baked goods (pastries, breads, buns, etc.). I maybe wrong, but it seemed to me that they had more sweet pastries and overall less selection compared to the other two locations. I usually go for the spicy curry beef bun, but I couldn&#39;t find it there, so I opt for the regular curry beef bun and I had the orange pastry to go along with it. I also got my usual raisin bread (They didn&#39;t have the sliced one, bummer).

Taste wise, everything was good - just like how I expect them to be, Fuji Bakery good. Due to the shortcomings I listed above, I was tempted to give this place a 3-star review. Perhaps I didn&#39;t come at the right time or maybe they&#39;re still trying to sort things out, I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt.

In short, this Fuji Bakery is decent but I&#39;ll recommend the other two places to get your fix."

Finally got around to checking out the spanking new location on Elliott. My black bean bun had a soft and tasty bread which was good, but it was a teeny bit dry on the inside. Friend had a pineapple and cream cheese (?) pastry, which was very good. Not sweet, which is how I prefer my baked goods for the most part. Self-serve coffee was just right: nutty not bitter with the right amount of coffee to water (not &#34;dense&#34; like many of the better known cafes here). Nice to have whole milk to go with, rather than cream. 

Only downside was no wifi, the automatic sliding door was weird for such a small place and there wasn&#39;t a ton of seating, so overall, not the best for business meetings. A last yet much appreciated bonus was the free parking right outside; only about a dozen spots though. But I&#39;ll be going back soon to try the other baked goodies or to bring some to a friend."

Maybe it was better when the previous baker was in charge, but their pastries aren&#39;t that great.  I always try a plain croissant as a test and although Fuji&#39;s had a nice texture, it had no flavor, no buttery yumminess.  The croissants that have a bunch of fruit and chocolate and other tasty additions work better since it gives it more flavor--except for the very bland and tough almond croissant.  The only thing I can say that I truly liked was the curry bun.  Since it&#39;s a convenient location for us, we&#39;ll probably get some if we have a &#34;pastry emergency&#34;, but other than that, we found it to be pretty unremarkable."

I walked into Tippe and Drague expecting a dive bar and was happily proven wrong. The lighting was slightly intimate, but lit well so you didn&#39;t feel as if you were squinting to see the person across from you.

The bar is small in size, but large enough that you don&#39;t feel too cramped the people around you.

Beer selection is diverse with great flavors from all over. I am for sure going back either on a date or with someone who enjoys a good atmosphere and a good drink."

The patio is fully fenced and has garden tables and benches for ultimate relaxation. The tree out back is one of the prettiest I&#39;ve seen. Leaves are incredible! I could sit out there for hours.... 

Dogs are not allowed inside so you will have to go around to get out back, but since it&#39;s fully fenced they don&#39;t have a problem if your pup is off leash so long as s/he is not bothering other patrons.

To be clear:  the beer/ciders are fantastic, the food is great, and the staff is overall incredible.  However, I have to write this update given a recent interaction with one of the owners.

For the last year, my boyfriend and I were there at least there once a week, and a few weeks ago took a friend to check it out.  The kids at a nearby table were coughing, and it was textbook for pertussis (whooping cough).  I&#39;m not WebMD&#39;ing this;  I&#39;ve been a healthcare professional/provider for the last 19 years.  Even my boyfriend, and the woman at the next table!, commented on it.

On our way out, I waited a couple minutes to discreetly tell the owner, and was completely rebuffed.  &#34;They&#39;ve seen a doctor&#34; (this doesn&#39;t change my assessment, BTW...) &#34;they&#39;re fine.  They&#39;ve been vaccinated.&#34;  Okay.  I dropped it and left.

The following week, she brought it up with me.  I again said that it sure sounded suspicious to me, but left it at that.  People can listen to what you tell them, or not.  I had said all I wanted to say--I&#39;m not arguing about it.

She&#39;s been quite distant with us since then--she&#39;ll serve us, but she certainly wasn&#39;t friendly like she&#39;d previously been.  I attempted to clear the air with her last week, and she was flat-out nasty.  She &#34;can&#39;t believe I don&#39;t care what a doctor says&#34;, I have a &#34;horrible bedside manner&#34; (she&#39;s never seen me practice), she can&#39;t believe I &#34;got in her face&#34;.  I apologized that it came across that way--again, I was trying to be discrete.  

Mind you:  I&#39;m a regular customer there, and my boyfriend and I eat, drink, are friendly with other patrons, and tip well.  The conversation devolved to the point where she became verbally abusive, at which point I told her I&#39;d cash out the bartender (the always-awesome Wieber) and leave.  She told me I could just leave.  So I did.  I certainly won&#39;t be back.

It&#39;s unfortunate that this whole scenario went down the way it did.  First of all:  we are adults, not 15-year-olds.  You get angry at people, you talk it out, you get over it.  The was ONE occurrence where I said something, out of concern for public safety, and I did it as quietly as possible.  Second, this woman owns a business where I routinely spend a good amount of money;  it seems highly counterintuitive to be so rude to a regular customer (who has brought in over a dozen other people in my 1 year attending this business).  It&#39;s just such baffling behavior, and smacks of something a whole lot deeper than a patron saying something that bugged you.

I don&#39;t know.  I do know what it&#39;s like to work with people all day, every day, and customer service is paramount--even when you think people are full of it, you&#39;re still polite to them, because that&#39;s your job.  Any business would do well to remember this, as unappreciated customers will go elsewhere."

There are just two rooms, and it feels like this is the space they were able to carve out of a building that probably used to be a house once upon a time. It&#39;s right up against the sidewalk on the southern stretch of Beacon Avenue that&#39;s just starting to bustle. 

You walk in and there are a few tables, a flat screen, and a great big grandfather clock off to the side. A grandfather clock! Not a smart-ass artists reproduction, with a cheap tin clockworks set screwed into a big old box. A real grandfather clock is standing there off to the side. It doesn&#39;t get any homier than that. They don&#39;t have a fireplace, but not too many bars do. Precious few, if any, bars can boast a grandfather clock though. Looks like a nice one, and when I was in, it was running.

The next room has two semi-divider walls cordoning off the bar area, where there&#39;s a nice barback, a couple dozen faucets pouring well-selected local micros (almost all WA and OR), a flat screen, and a big popcorn machine. They ask everybody if they want a bowl of popcorn. So cool. They tend to run KEXP over the hi-fi.

The food list is a rock-solid lineup of pub grub, with veggie, vegan, gluten-free, and other options virtually throughout. Everything looks and smells great, though I&#39;ve only been here for beers, bowl games, and conversation. No food so far, but I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to dine here for sure.

Beacon Hill is really blowing up. This place went from virtually empty to completely packed in 10 minutes, and stayed packed. The people on both sides of the bar are friendly and fun. I&#39;ll definitely be back."

Reuben sandwich was amazing.   The bread was toasted perfectly and had that slight chewiness to it which made the bread taste so good.  Came with a side vinaigrette salad which was extremely fresh.  No wilted greens here!

Mimosa was crisp and bubbly just to my liking.

Free popcorn was so fresh and addicting I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.

My friend got a local beer and said it was a good pick. 

I&#39;m Pretty impressed for a pub. You can tell by the food they really pick high quality ingredients and the presentation is clean.

A lot has changed on Beacon Hill over the 20-some years since I first got to know the neighborhood, but the opening of Tippe and Drague is second best only to getting a Light Rail station. (The fact that both are an easy walk from my home ensures they stay on the top of my list.)

We first Tipped and Dragued a couple weeks after they opened. Knowing what the inside of the building was like before it renovated, we were stunned when we walked in. For all the work that had been done to turn it into an alehouse, there was nothing in there that looked brand new. And I mean that in the best possible way.

Everything about Tippe and Drague feels like it&#39;s been a part of the fabric of the neighborhood forever. It&#39;s the comfortable &#34;third place&#34; that urban planners stress are what connect us to where we live and the others who live there. Whether we go in for a couple grownup pints without our almost-teenaged child, or we take him with us for some food, we also feel welcomed not only by the owners and staff, but by the neighbors we see there.

The tap list changes constantly and it is for my money the most interesting one in Seattle. I love going there and discovering new beers from small breweries that you simply won&#39;t find on tap at a larger establishment. The food is solidly good pub fare, often with a little twist to it, such as the pear slices on the chicken sandwich. The popcorn is free and endless.

It&#39;s ridiculously easy to give Tippe and Drague a five star review. It&#39;s exactly what a neighborhood alehouse should be."

After a quick yelp search of pubs and filtering through the ratings, I settled on first visiting Tippe &amp; Drague Alehouse in Beacon Hill. The neighborhood reminded me a little of the neighborhood pubs from my time living in Chicago, and when I walked in, that familiar warm feeling elicited by a friendly environment instantly enveloped me. It wasn&#39;t that bar, trying to be something it truly isn&#39;t; it wasn&#39;t the crazy sports bar with screens and blaring noise; and it wasn&#39;t that bar with the sticky floors begrudgingly serving craft beer. It was like visiting friends in an atmosphere almost perfect for good beer and conversation.

I sat down on the wooden stools (perhaps my only suggested improvement would be to pad the stools) at the bar, and (I believe) one of the co-owners asked if I would like to start with a beer. After reviewing the tap handles and beer list, I settled on a malty Emerald City Brewing&#39;s Dottie Amber Lager. She offered me some popcorn, but I was in the mood for something more substantive, just not a sandwich or burger... just couldn&#39;t put my finger on it. As if she knew exactly what I needed, she mentioned they were finishing up brunch, and suggested their cheese grits with bacon. 

Since I grew up in Atlanta, I was a little hesitant to order grits in Seattle. Not that I&#39;m a huge fan of grits, but I know enough about them, that it takes careful preparation for just the right consistency and proper flavor. I cannot even describe how awesome the cheese grits were yesterday. Sometimes cheese in grits can make them heavy, yet somehow these were just the right amount of fresh cheese that did not dominate the flavor of the grits. To make them even more savory, I added some Louisiana hot sauce to my liking, and by the time I finished it was all I could do not to lick the bowl. To top it all off, the bacon was thick and smoky, and frankly, the grits and bacon paired very nicely with my beer :)

As I debated what to try next, another bartender came over and started up a friendly conversation about football. We chatted as if we&#39;d known each other for a long time, and I soon ordered Amnesia Brewery&#39;s Two-Stroke Summer Ale -- a Kolsch style pale ale. It was cold and hazy and just right to enjoy the start of the Mariners game. The bartender wisely took note of my order and offered me a couple of additional similar local samples &#34;for consideration on your next visit.&#34;

Believe the reviews that bring Tippe &amp; Drague to the top of the Seattle pubs on yelp. This place is the real deal -- and I am so glad to find them and add them to the places I plan to frequent. Tippe &amp; Drague has just the right amount of balance to being a friendly neighborhood bar, almost feeling &#34;like home,&#34; and offering terrific food with a superb variety of local beer. Without question, I will be back -- and when friends visit from other great beer towns like Boston, this will be the first place I take them."

I was warned that in this part of beacon hill, there are really only two beer places and most told me that Trippe and Drague was the better one. I&#39;m glad to say that they were right. the beer menu is always changing which I like. I understand people having a go to beer and those people should make a practice of keeping that beer at home. I like to try something new when I&#39;m out. Based on what they told me, each time a keg blows they tap a keg from a new brewery or at least a new kind of beer, so things are always changing! if you like to play with a variety of beer, than this will delight you just like it did me. 

Our server was so friendly and helpful. When I couldn&#39;t made a decision on food she suggested something and also suggested something that would taste better after a few beers. 

My friend who had come with me had a stake sandwich, and it was awesome! I had a bite but kept to my beer until she and I were singing mariachi songs. At that point, the grilled BP&amp;J&amp;B (that&#39;s peanut butter and jelly and bacon) sounded amazing and really topped the night off well. Totally my new watering hole! 

It&#39;s great for watching games and is really friendly! 

I know this place serves brunch as well but the last time my boyfriend and I went there for brunch there was a Seahawks game on and the place was packed. We decided we didn&#39;t want to deal with it... Ok I was hung over and didn&#39;t want to deal with it. Still, the menu looked interesting."

Tippe &amp; Drague Alehouse was a sweet spot for that. Specifically, the Eggs Benedict with fried potatoes and side bowl of strawberries and cantaloupe. I would have preferred a little more Hollandaise sauce covering the eggs and muffin, but it was still very good. The fruit was also very fresh.

Interested in a quality and local micro-brew? Well, they have 16 of them, exclusively from either Oregon or Washington. I was in a dark (beer) mood and the Westport Brewing Porter with caramel and chocolate malts was a very nice selection.

The bartender was very friendly and pleasant to talk to, which was a relief especially since there were only a few people dining there at the time. Although it could remain hidden over on Beacon Hill, TDA is worth a find and a visit."

Great location on Beacon Hill; with a trivia night, delicious FREE popcorn (from the old Columbia City Theatre popcorn machine, now the Ark Lodge Cinema) and really, really great service. 

I like the space, but it&#39;s not someplace I would hang out for a long period of time. I&#39;ve been in for dinner/beers twice and once for weekend breakfast. During breakfast, I ordered a side of cheese grits, that had this strange aftertaste of maple syrup. So much so, I asked my waitperson if they put maple syrup in it (either on accident or purpose) and she said they didn&#39;t. Strange. The eggs, toast and potatoes were fine, but not memorable. We walked away full, but a little unsatisfied with the food.

So dinner; I&#39;ve had the nachos with chicken and was sorely disappointed. The cheese was sparse and reminded me of nachos from the movies a bit. I also have had the mac and cheese (added chicken) and it was really heavy on the bleu cheese and gorgonzola. I adore both cheeses, but it was too pungent together. 

I have heard of the other chef offerings that they had, but I never seem to get there when they are happening. But I kinda wish that they served quality memorable food all the time, not just during the specials. You&#39;re cool; T&amp;D. I&#39;ll wait a bit and give you guys a go again :)"

They greet you with a bowl of fresh popcorn, popped the way it was 50 years ago with very little butter and salt.  Yum!

They have a decent variety of local craft beers, and the girls I was with also ordered their cider.  They said it was delicious, but I prefer more dark brews.  They had a pretty good looking food menu, but I didn&#39;t try anything else. I&#39;ll definitely come back here next time I&#39;m in Seattle :)"

They also have complimentary munchies for anytime, including chips, pita chips and popcorn from their own machine.

It&#39;s interesting to read other reviews that mention them making people feel at home, because even the 5 or 6 other times that we visited the Tippe and Drague, we walked away with a bad taste in our mouth. While they do have a good beer selection, the waitstaff never made us feel welcome, more like an inconvenience. Last night was no exception. A few friends and I came in to play trivia. It was busy and they seated us at the bar. We were halfway through the game  when my girlfriend came in. She had had a long day and just wanted to sit and have a drink. The rules of the trivia game are 4 to a team, which was fine because she didn&#39;t want to play anyway. There wasn&#39;t anywhere for her to sit, so I gave her my stool at the bar and huddled up with my trivia team as we worked on answers. The bartender refused to give her a drink because it was against the rules to have more than 4 on a team. She explained that she wasn&#39;t playing, she just wanted to sit and have a drink. The bartender and manager still refused to serve her and just went out of their way to make her feel unwelcome. I understand the sanctity of trivia rules and as avid trivia players, our team would never cheat. But to make those rules more important than making a customer feel welcome to me is a symptom of a larger problem. They obviously have regulars  and have done a great job making their regulars feel at home. I just wish they extended the same courtesy to other guests."

My husband had biscuits and gravy both times and my son had the buttermilk pancakes and we shared a side of bacon.  The food is really top quality which is a bit surprising for a pub.

The ambiance is very cozy, clean and cheerful.  On our first visit the owner Melissa told us all about how they salvaged a lot of the lights and the grandfather clock from a family farm and it was apparent the place was designed and built with love and attention.  The service was friendly, though as another poster commented the servers are sometimes a little green.

We are thrilled to have another neighborhood option for great food.  It&#39;s a great compliment to the other neighborhood joints and is a consistent family favorite.

Update:  3 years and going strong. Here for Sunday breakfast and the place is packed. Football on TV and Ray Charles on the speakers. Happy kids and families digging into delicious food. Seahawks jerseys, hot sauce, great art on the wall. Still love this place. BTW tho we come most often for breakfast, lunch and dinner food is great too.

&#39;twas a hump day Wednesday when I decided to spontaneously grab a cold one with a good friend. I&#39;ve been wanting to try me some more urbanized gentrified Beacon Hill spots so lo and behold I came across Tippe and Drague. It looks small from the outside but inside is pretty spacious.

Service was great. Upon entering, IDs were checked (I will forever look like I&#39;m 16 with my petite Asian frame and face, boo.) and popcorn was offered. Pints are a fair $5 but for some reason the glasses look smaller than most bars? Great selection of local brews except most of it were IPAs which are 1) too bitter for me and 2) too strong for me to knock back a few and still be able to drive -- NO, I DO NOT DRIVE DRUNK, NOR DO I CONDONE IT IN THE LEAST. 

Food is a bit expensive but we split a rueben that was loaded and delicious. Chips were unimpressive but hey, they&#39;re chips. You don&#39;t ask for a side that has to astound someone. Fair.

The waiter looked like the man on the coaster which I found amusing.
Will definitely come back if I was in the area. Laid back vibes, it&#39;d be great to watch a game over a couple of pints.

How about them &#39;hawks?"

My only complaint is that the food is a little expensive (though fresh and I appreciate the rotating specials), and they don&#39;t do a great job keeping their beer list updated.

Arrived to find the place hopping, but not outrageously so.  Managed to snag a comfy table in the corner and were immediately greeted by a very friendly server bearing popcorn.  Off to a great start....

Neither my husband nor I are beer drinkers, so I can&#39;t comment on the beer menu.  But, he enjoyed a nice cider on draft (getting a bit easier to find, but still not entirely common), while I had to stop myself from quaffing down a lovely glass of sangria (ok, two lovely glasses...).  (Not my normal choice, but perfect for a warm summer evening.)

We each ordered a sandwich with a side salad.  The salads came out first, and, I have to say, I was not particularly impressed.  The veggies had seen better days and my dressing (fig balsamic, which I thought would be amazing) was pretty bland.

My sandwich, though, was much better:  grilled chicken on ciabatta with two cheeses and caramelized onions and pears.  The chicken was cooked just right, all the accompaniments complemented it quite nicely, and it was an ample serving.

Prices here originally look a hair above the odds, but, then you realize tax is already included; so then they seem just about on par with the prices charged for similar food and drink at similar establishments.

As mentioned, our server was very friendly as were the other folks on duty tonight (two of whom happened by our table at some point).  All made us feel like we were very welcome and that our business was truly appreciated.

The atmosphere was, as the kids say, chill.  Patrons ranged from parents out with their kids, to folks on dates, to groups of friends kicking off their Friday night frolicking.  All seemed to be having a great time.

Overall, this was a very enjoyable, relaxed, dinner.  So glad to have found the Tippe and Drague Alehouse.  Even gladder that it is just a short jaunt from home.  We&#39;ll be back."

There are three or four highly rated restaurants near each other on Beacon Ave, so we decided to start with Tippe and Drague.  The wait staff are very attentive and friendly.  The size of the restaurant is pretty small, yet very comfortable.  They have a nice selection of beers and their menu gives a little extra detail on each one to help you make a decision.  We ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a cesar salad.  I have to say that I&#39;ve definitely had better pulled pork.  And, the salad wasn&#39;t anything special.  The lettuce seemed a little wilted.  However, we did have the carrot cake for dessert and it was fabulous!

Overall, I would recommend this place and would certainly go back.  But, don&#39;t expect to be wow&#39;d by their food."

Five of us came here for the first time to watch the Super Bowl because we wanted a place that wasn&#39;t full of overgrown frat boys but also not too precious and full of hipsters.  We came to the right place.

The food is great, and clearly not frozen stuff bought in bulk.  Everything tastes fresh and like the chef actually cares.  The beer selection is one of the best in Seattle if not THE best (not the longest list - that&#39;s not what I mean) and you&#39;ll find small batch craft beers here that you&#39;ll look long and hard to find anywhere else.  

The TV is nice and big, the staff has a really good attiitude and gets things out quickly, and the vibe is comfortable and friendly.

A wide eclectic and constantly changing selection of beers, I&#39;m always salivating to find out what coming next.

In order to find some kind of beer, you had to squeeze into Baja Bistro (too loud music) or travel to Georgetown where you found lots of cold shoulders. I found out about this establishment months before it opened on a beer blog and even paid a visit while the owners were still painting the interior. 

I was there the first week it opened and I think I have been there every week since then (ok, we are fans). I have not been able to find an equally comfortable &amp; inviting watering hole since I came to Seattle (over 10 years ago). Owners Melissa &amp; Robert (and server Ed) are easygoing and always stop to chat, where ever we sit. Their beer menu changes practically daily and one time we mentioned we liked a certain beer and next week they had it on tap! They have 15 beers on tap and at least one kind of cider and it&#39;s all Pacific Northwest derived. Kitchen staff make good food, in particular their soups and bread puddings (not offered all the time). They update their Facebook pretty often with what&#39;s happening that day. They are open everyday - we even went and had a beer with them on Christmas day. 

But because it was a wasteland prior to their opening, it is now popular! People know this is the place to go! Make sure to show up early in the evenings and weekends or you might have to wait for a seat."

Pros: Have you checked out their beer selection?? Ridiculously awesome. 
Delicious food. Ample seating. Separate bar/dining area that ensures its family-friendly status. They engaged with our son, which was great. Clean. Nice big tables. Fast service. Friendly service. Good service. Plenty of parking. They open early weekends for football. Rolllllll Tiiiiiiiiiiide.

They have a pretty substantial tap list that seems to rotate fairly frequently- the beer menu had the previous weeks selections on the back and most of the beers were different. The list  showcases northwest beers that you don&#39;t typically see everywhere else and there was a decent variety of styles. 

The service was good, if not a little over enthusiastic- it was pretty slow and the waitress was checking back with at an interval that felt like every other minute.

My issue was with the food. My bf &amp; I both ordered sandwiches- he got the steak sandwich w/ mushrooms &amp; blue cheese and I had chicken w/ brie and pear. We both had side salads. Our sandwiches were both a decent size but  woefully under-seasoned. The chicken breast was completely flavorless and the cheese was greasy not creamy. I had to add soooo much salt. Our side salads were ridiculous- it was a plate of limp romaine w/ 1 halved cherry tomato and a single slice of cucumber. Wah wah."

The beer selection is awesome.  The menu is relatively simple and straighforward, with a focus on grilled sandwiches.  $10 for a grilled ham and cheese seemed a little pricey to me, but the sandwich was tasty (the ham was very good) and of a suitable size for sharing, so all in all it was very satisfying.

We wanted someplace near to where we live (Mt Baker) and pub-style. So we searched Yelp (thanks, Yelp!) and decided to make a visit to Tippe and Drague, which we&#39;ve driven past once or twice.

Where to start? What can we say? From the minute we walked in, the staff was attentive and helpful. We sat ourselves (as is the practice) and one of the staff came over immediately to ask if we would like the complimentary popcorn (of course). They were more than helpful with the beer menu, including bringing us samples of our potential beverage (scotch ale for me, stout for the hubby). The drinks arrived quickly, and they allowed us time to peruse both the drink and the food menu without being either over attentive or neglectful.

We settled on the Stout-infused burger (hubby) and the French steak sandwich (me). Both were well made and plentiful without being excessive. The food arrived promptly, and all our needs were met without fuss. The steak sandwich was excellent, a wonderful blend of flavors with the earthiness of the mushrooms, the perfectly cooked steak, and the sharpness of the Gruyere and Bleu cheeses. I have only my hubby&#39;s word for it, but apparently the hamburger was excellent as well.

The things we really appreciated:

Staff attentiveness
The family-friendly atmosphere (the 2-year-old girl at the next table was priceless)
The complimentary popcorn
The extensive beer list, with something for everyone&#39;s tastes

** We started with beers -- the Black Bear stout for him, the Scotch ale for me. He finished with a glass of pinot grigio, and I had the bourbon-barrel-aged cider from Victoria, BC (Canadians KNOW how to make cider). The bevvies were excellent.

To the management and staff:  Keep doing what you&#39;re doing. We felt welcomed and served without being overwhelmed. i We will most definitely be back!"

I ordered something off the seasonal menu, a seared tuna dish with brown rice and slaw. For $25, I found the value lacking for me when comparing against pricing; it was visually appealing and fresh but the flavor lacked enough impact to warrant the price for me. There were other options on the menu so those might have some potential in terms of value but I might stay away from the pricier options in the future.

The ambiance and decor was nice. 
The server was good

However, service was slow considering we were one of two tables in the restaurant. 

The food was unfortunately underwhelming. 

-the sashimi (tuna and salmon) in the sashimi appetizer was sliced so thin,  it was disappointing to look at. They were good though, and wasabi, spicy. 
-the salmon wrap was more than half filled with rice.  I would get bites of just the tortilla and rice.  Also the wrap lacked flavor even though there was some kind of sauce in there.  Whatever it was, it didn&#39;t taste like anything.  The salmon itself also had no flavor and I wished for some other veggies in the wrap for some crunch and flavor. I sprinkled it with salt for every bite which made it tolerable. The only saving grace in the dish were the fries it came with,  which was coated with something crunchy and delicious. 
-the sauce in the Mussels appetizer was much too buttery and was a thicker sauce which I thought was too heavy. I didn&#39;t want to dip the bread or the mussels in it."

Ordered the sashimi appetizer and their specialty salmon dish. Sashimi appetizer came with thinly sliced (my favorite cut) tuna and salmon. With a side of their teriyaki sauce.

The salmon plated dish was super juicy grilled (not an oxymoron at this restaurant) salmon with brown rice and delicious coleslaw. The coleslaw was the best thing ever, it wasn&#39;t milky or maoyi or too creamy. I believe it to be the best coleslaw I have ever had.

The restaurant was clean and we were greeted and seated promptly. 

The server was wonderful, kind and every prompt. She was running around attending to everyone&#39;s needs on her own. 

My issue is with the food. We started with a Cesar  salad and the zucchini that was a Yelp offer. The zucchini was grilled and cut and then plopped on a plate. It was very bland and boring (but free so I can&#39;t account this into the review). 

I ordered the shrimp wrap and it was 95% rice. You can see this in the photo. I was excited to try it with the spicy sauce but the sauce was not at all spicy. There were 4 tiny shrimp in the wrap and I ended up removing all the rice because carb overload. It was served with fries (very crunch and delicious) and Cole slaw (seasoned well).

He was friendly and accommodating and despite some setbacks that night with the other service staff, he took care of us well. We noticed the staff seemed to be forgetting to bring out some salad or chowder to other tables, so we just needed to remember what we ordered and remind them for it, and it came out no problem.

We split the combo fry plate and a chowder, with a more than reasonable $1 surcharge as we got it out on two plates with our own Cole slaw and fries. The breaded fish was reminiscent of what a fish stick should be like, and I loved the batter on the fries. The clam chowder was explained to be seasoned with smoked salmon in lieu of bacon, and it was a thick chowder.  

Definitely would come back again. They&#39;ll sort their service staff situation out. Good location near the locks, discovery park, and Kerry park."

Honestly really pleased with Five Hooks!

It was an interesting layout being just a square room and the restaurant looked bigger on the outside but the balcony looked really nice to dine on during the day or when the sun is setting. 

It says it&#39;s a &#34;casual seafood eatery&#34; and the waitresses were definitely dressed casual. Danielle was attentive and very nice. She made sure we were satisfied and over all very helpful and made the dining experience much better.

Alaskan true cod: came with 3 pieces, probably the size of your palm. The batter was light and crispy and the fish was juicy! Their fries came out nice and fresh. The coleslaw was actually refreshing and not overwhelmed with the usual mayo dressing! Apparently you can add another piece of fish for $2. 4/5 wish the pieces were bigger 

Butter toast: light, soft and crispy on the edges! 3.75/5 it was good but idk if I&#39;ll pay $4 for it again. 

Dinner Caesar salad: wasn&#39;t a traditional salad but it was alright since I was expected it to be just a simple Caesar. I liked how they put just enough dressing and it wasn&#39;t overpowering my salad. Like my salad still felt somewhat healthy! Lol even though it&#39;s not. A little pricy for being so simple. 3/5

Large clam chowder: Topped off with dots of sriracha, bacon bits, and freshly grounded black pepper. I was pleasantly surprised it was flavorful and had a light fluffy creaminess even though it was gluten free. It actually felt healthier than usual clam chowders. The salmon pieces added in gave it more flavor! 4.5/5 good but I still love it super creamy..need that heavy cream! 

Grilled zucchini: honestly if it wasn&#39;t a Yelp check in I probably wouldn&#39;t have ordered I that but since it was free it was decent. Tasted just like grilled zucchini nothing special lol. I added a bit salt to mine. 3/5 since it was free? And tasted ok

Waitress was super awesome and it was just an overall great dinner. They have daily specials, the only one I can remember is the AYCE fish and chips on Fridays that I&#39;ll be back for!

I docked 1/2 a star because I felt like their prices were pretty steep being a casual eatery even though they sold seafood.. The way they plate it and just the look of things are just a little too casual? You know what I&#39;m saying...?"

The prices are on a par with similar restaurants on Queen Anne Avenue, but I find the seafood here is the best, and the owner + chef are very enthusiastic about the catch and preparation.  Always something to try on the menu.

We especially love how family-friendly it is.  A small play area, and plenty of high chairs, plus accommodating hosts and servers.

But even before we had our son, this was still a go-to because of the excellent seafood and very comfortable dining environment.  Deck in the summer and fire in the winter."

On the way to meet friends during the week and we arrived a bit early to Queen Anne. We were starving so turned to trusty YELP and found the Five Hooks relatively close.

Anyhow a small, quaint place on the corner and from what I hear gets very busy on the weekend, so make a reservations.

We arrived during happy hour and tried a few things.  Their seared tuna ahi was very tasty and not overcooked, which seems to be a problem when folks don&#39;t know their fish.  Also a half a dozen oysters finished our snack for the evening.  They are shucked per order, so very fresh.  

The menu looked incredible and so did the food coming out to the other tables, good portions as well. Definitely want to come back and get a full meal.

While we were finishing our snacks we talked to Paul, our server, which turned out to be also the owner who runs the place with his son and a few others.  The staff and Paul were extremely nice and thanked us a few times for stopping in.    

Overall great place to grab some seafood without ridiculous prices, plus probably the nicest, sincere staff and owner of any place that I have visited."

Copper river salmon $35 with rice, white corn and a piece  of white bread.  salmon was very good but still underwhelming with poor sides and sauces that did not seem to match.

waitress said comes with soup but the we were charged $8 each for 2 soups? since i plan on not coming back i just let it go.

sushi app came with teriyaki sauce? 

mashed potatoes  and that white bread with a sewed salad to accompany my seared local albacore for $25 again i felt overpriced and did not go well as a food grouping. 

fish cooked well but plates/ menus accompanied with fish made no sense.

We were there after the kitchen closed but they let us enjoy the food and stay until we wanted to. 

There were some complaints with food and service in other reviews but I was totally content with the food and service. Didn&#39;t feel like it was any more expensive than typical seafood restaurants. And the server (two actually) checked on us often. I will return when I&#39;m in the area."

We were disappointed that the only non-seafood item (chicken tenders) was sold out as our son doesn&#39;t eat seafood.  After some conversation, the waitress came back to tell us they had organic chicken they could grill.  I asked if they could slice and fry it, and after checking with the owner, we had chicken tenders after all - and they were fabulous!

It is February and the entire place was lined with poinsettias. Huh? Guess they are green and sustainable or they just are slow at keeping with the current holiday.

Friendly greeting, but pretty hands off and semi-neglectful throughout. You just have to flag them down to get their attention. Once you get them, they get you what you need with a smile.

Go to the Pacific Inn Pub, which has amazing fish and chips, but a dive bar atmosphere. 

It&#39;s not often that food makes me sick, but the cod and chips and halibut and chips plates certainly did. Not food poisoning, but just undercooked, excessively oily and poor quality. The waitress saw us sopping up all the oil and when we asked for extra napkins, she didn&#39;t even ask what was up? Never asked us if we liked the food. Instead of a rich golden brown, all the fish and fries were pale white.

The fish fillets looked and tasted like they were bought from a restaurant supply outlet frozen and then reheated in oil.

Also, the tarter was terrible and tasted old. Definitely from a bottle and not freshly made. Also, I really love cole slaw, but I only ate a couple bites of theirs and didn&#39;t want to eat any more. It was not only bland but tasted old."

However, what really had me going was how bad the service here was. The waiter seemed very condescending and aloof. He was also extremely slow in getting our food or addressing our issues.

My wife ordered the fried clams &amp; French fries. The clams were meaty, well breaded, and piping hot, with none of that sour taste you get from old frying oil.

I ordered the signature salmon. Earthy &amp; mild, the salmon was grilled to just the right consistency and served over a bed of moist brown rice. The teriyaki sauce added a sweet and savory flavor when I wanted it, though the fish was worth eating on it own.

Decent portions and quick and friendly service were also a plus."

Came in for dinner time with a friend of mine on a Friday which they informed us of the all you can eat fish and chips which is what I ordered, my friend ordered the shrimp tacos (Paul&#39;s Favorite) and his daughter ordered the kids Mac &amp; Cheese. 

My fish and chips was awful, at least the fish part was -- it tasted worse then the stuff you can buy from the freezer section in grocery stores. I ate some fries but ended up having to tell the waitress how awful it was -- she kindly voided the meal for me without any hesitation.

We also used the free appetizer with check in from yelp -- we received the grilled zucchini and that was didn&#39;t taste great, some of the zucchini wasn&#39;t even grilled and I&#39;m not sure if it was the seasoning they used or maybe their grill wasn&#39;t clean but our zucchini tasted like old fish taste. 

My friends shrimp tacos were very delicious no complaints there besides the price --$19 for I believe he had only 2 small tacos. 

His daughter didn&#39;t like her mac &amp; cheese there wasn&#39;t much flavor to it -and having a picky child who expects something similar to Kraft - she wasn&#39;t impressed either. 

The waitress and the service and people are incredibly friendly they just need to fix their recipes or their product as well as adjust prices. Being a restaurant not right along the coast who doesn&#39;t provide the &#34;freshest&#34; of fish, I don&#39;t think their prices should be as high as they are especially for the portion sizes. 

I hope the owner takes into account all the negative or mediocre reviews on here and does something to help save their business because I just don&#39;t see it surviving with what they do have."

The service is super nice.  I typically have the combo fish and chips plate which has so much fish!  I think their batter is done really well and doesn&#39;t overwhelm the fish.

Fish, fluffy, crispy and hot from the fryer!  More like a panko breaded rather than battered and fried. I liked it better than my the seared/grilled Alaskan cod, which was slightly bland. The texture was great but I had to season with more lemon juice and salt. I would go for the fish and chips the next time. Our friend ordered the salmon fish and chips and she said they were delicious. Their sweet potato and regular fries were fresh and hot. Everything seemed really fresh and delicious.

They were out of calamari and we ordered clam strips instead. There was more breading batter than clams.

If you check in on Yelp, you get a free order of grilled zucchini. I would definitely recommend doing so, because the zucchini was nicely seasoned.

For our meals, I had the fish (Alaskan cod) and chips, and my girlfriend had the clam chowder and an order of onion rings. I really liked the Cod. The breading was very light and crispy, and the tartar sauce that it came with was awesome. The clam chowder was less impressive though. It was kind of bland and a little watery. The fries and onion rings were just fine.

Every aspect of our dinner last night at this restaurant atop Queen Anne Hill was superb.  Residing on the corner of Queen Anne Ave and McGraw St., I think this location must have been an Italian restaurant in a past life, complete with arches, a homey fireplace and patches of faux exposed brick.  Outdoor seating is available during the warmer months.

Upon entry, we noticed several tempting specials on the white board, including bacon-wrapped scallops.  We also noted that Friday night was all-you-can-eat fish and chips.  We were seated quickly in a booth by friendly staffers (it was an unexpected delight to not have to wait for a table on a Friday evening).

Service was outstanding all night long, with a very responsive waiter and lots and lots of water and coffee refills.  Speaking of the coffee, though this is a fish house, Five Hooks&#39; rich flavorful coffee was the best brew I &#39;ve had in a long long time.

For seafood entrees, prices are very reasonable; most are less than $20.  I ordered the cod with a brown butter sauce  (with asparagus added for an extra $1.95) and JP went with the fish and chips.  

Oh baby, but my cod was the best ever.  I absolutely loved its slightly sweet perfectly seasoned brown butter sauce.  The cod was fresh and tender.  Accompanying the cod was a delicious, straightforward coleslaw, brown rice, a fresh little seaweed salad and a tiny piece of bread.  In addition, there was a most exquisite soy sauce-based dipping sauce with just a dab of wasabi.  The cod sure didn&#39;t need to be dipped in anything because it was good enough already with the butter sauce, so I used the dipping sauce for the bread.  Oh, the grilled asparagus was great.

JP and I agreed that Five Hooks fish and chips are the best ever.  The flavor and texture of the panko-crusted cod chips are incredibly good.  And we loved the slightly crispy fries too.  One last note - we really liked the  that the instrumental background music was set at a perfect unobtrusive volume.  We will be back.  Perfect for Fridays during Lent!"

I sat by a fire place for dinner (side point of joy) and it&#39;s my tradition to get fish and chips wherever I travel. Loved it. I recommend the sweet potato fish and chips.

I went with a group of eight other people (6 adults, 3 kids). It was Friday evening, and I expected it to be busy, but it wasn&#39;t too bad. They were able to seat us almost immediately (which could be a bad sign if you consider lots of people to be harbinger of quality). 

Two of the kid&#39;s meals came out within five minutes of ordering, and they were alright. Nothing special. And based on these first two kid&#39;s meals--mac and cheese, and chicken strips--we thought, &#34;Eh, nothing special.&#34; Few things on the kid&#39;s menu ever are. My daughter&#39;s still hadn&#39;t come out yet.

But then we waited. And waited. My wife said, &#34;The menu says they cook it to perfection, so maybe perfection just means a long time.&#34; It was about half an hour before the food came out. Do you see that five star review, though? I&#39;m not complaining, because it was worth the wait.

I got their signature salmon dish. Dude. It was an amazing grilled salmon with teriyaki sauce and a dab of wasabi on the side. I think I grill up a pretty baller salmon at home (over coal, sometimes with wood for a smokey flavor), but his was something special. It had a nice color, amazing texture, excellent taste. My wife got some fried combo platter; despite the frying of nice seafood, you could taste the fish, scallop, and shrimp. This was good stuff. 

One friend got some seafood stew that was pretty stellar. Another got the grilled shrimp dish that was just as good. My daughter even got some fried cod from the kid&#39;s menu, and that was quite good. She ate some; I devoured the rest. 

Now with each meal we have while in town, we keep comparing it with Five Hooks as the benchmark."

Had a hankering for fish and chips for lunch, found this place, checked the Web site, and say that this place fit the bill... showed up a little after opening on a Saturday, and the place was dead - I can easily see where it would be packed on a weekend evening.  The outside is unassuming, and the atmosphere is homey and inviting - juuuuuust enough flair to set it up as a seafood restaurant, but not so cheesy that it becomes a Long John Silvers.  Service was fast - ridiculously fast, even - as it should be when the place is dead - but friendly and warm.

As for the food itself, dang.  The fish and chips were spot on good - not the traditional beer batter that&#39;s done in town, but, panko crusted and prepared perfectly.  The batter-y fries were a great complement to the meal, and the whole thing was priced pretty reasonably.

The biggest thing I liked about this place... is that from the moment I walked in, even before I ordered - there was a feeling that the folks who run the place love it like their kid and are taking care of it.  Everything from the Web site to the dining room layout to the menu is simple - easy to understand - but shows that the folks in charge put a lot of thought and effort into it.

Finally a man came over who turned out to be the owner and this is when my irritation began to dissipate.  Obviously, an apology was in order for the wait.  I think that we got an insider view into the running of a family restaurant, i.e., covering different tasks, jumping from cooking to waiting tables and the like.

The Ahi Tuna was seared lightly (I asked for it that way) giving it a hint of wood smoke on top of that sashimi silk mouth feel that you only get when the fish is hyper fresh. The salmon was moist and tasty even as it spent more time on the grill. The asparagus and zucchini were cooked just the way we like. Brown rice for good health-soft and luscious. Now the crab cakes and clam chowder were far too rich to be healthy, but what the hell, they tasted so good I refuse to feel bad about them.
This is definitely a great place for a first date, the ambiance probably depends on how busy they are. We came in on a Wednesday night and enjoyed the gas log fire and candlelight as much as the fine service.

The french fries were super crispy. After that.....well....

Five Hooks falls under the &#34;if you order the things we fry, you will love us&#34; places. I prefer a light, golden brown fry on things, and that was served up.

We ordered the combo appetizer. You get clam strips, scallops and shrimp, all fried, on a bed of fries. Like I said, if its fried, you&#39;ll love them.

My husband ordered the signature salmon and I got the combo wrap, on a bed of lettuce. After working in restaurants, I quickly learned you can tell a good restaurant vs. a bad restaurant by having their wrap on a bed of lettuce rather than a tortilla. When a restaurant gets a wrap order, they make the wrap and let it sit so the flavors meld together and mask any under seasoning, poorly seasoned, dry ect variable. When you get it on a bed of lettuce, they cannot do that.

So my &#34;wrap&#34; consisted of super dry cod, and shrimp that had been cooked on a dirty grill. I could taste the burned flavor. Had it been in a wrap, this flavor would have been masked by the fried scallops accompanying the other two co-stars. The lettuce was brown and just plain old, and the rice had zero flavor.

My husbands salmon was soggy and bland. He masked it with the soy sauce/wasabi combo they provided him with.

All in all it was not $55 well spent, and we will stick to cooking at home if we want grilled seafood."

On the plus side, the outside view and interior openness was nice.  Wait staff was also great.  However, each of the three meals, appetizer included, was very disappointing. 

Do NOT order the calamari appetizer with zucchini strips. The strips were OK, but the calamari was the worst I&#39;ve ever had.  They were rubbery &amp; raw with a very greasy breading. I could barely cut the squid with a knife, it was so rubber-band like.  

We ordered three entrees: the wild salmon, the crab cakes, and the scallops.  While the salmon was grilled, it was dry &amp; overcooked.  The other two entrees were breaded and pan-fried to the point of being tasteless.

We loved our waitress enough, and on her great personality alone, almost bumped up from a one star experience to two, but have to be honest here... it was bad.

Bad experience, bad food:

-From ordering to food delivery, it took over an hour.  65 minutes.  We had three orders consisting of fish &amp; chips, and 6 total fish tacos.  That was it - and there were 5 total tables filled at the time.  I don&#39;t get it... not busy... basic order... bizarre.

-The food tasted bad.  Heads up- the fish tacos come with a sugary french dressing sauce, and not much fish.  The &#34;special sauce&#34; tasted really bad to me... way, way too sweet, and way too much of it.  The fried fish was not crispy at all and was half white, half dark gray, on the inside.

-Messed up our order - gave my wife&#39;s taco order to me and vice versa... that&#39;s the thing about them, there was so little meat on them, we didn&#39;t realize what had happened until we were both halfway through a taco.  

-Just an FYI, not a complaint, if you are trying to escape the heat in an air conditioned restaurant, this is not it - no A/C. 

-Lastly, I have worked in a kitchen and I get that it&#39;s not the most appetizing to see how the food is prepared.  However it was not ideal to literally watch through the open bay window how food prep guys were sweating (hey I get it - it was freaking hot in there) and sweat flying all over the food from their foreheads and wet hair.  Not their fault, seemed like good guys, but didn&#39;t add to the experience, let&#39;s say that.

Overall disappointing and after such a nonsensical, almost bizarre wait (i.e. did some guy quit?)  I felt like we might get a free meal or something but we were happy to pay and get the heck out of there."

Five Hooks Fish Grill really cares about their guests enjoying their evening out in a casual and non presumptuous environment, while still providing top notch food and exceptional service. If something is not up to par, it won&#39;t be coming out of their kitchen or being served at your table. Even if you don&#39;t know what to order, you&#39;ll be safe just closing your eyes, pointing to the menu and ordering what and where your finger lands! (It will most likely be so good that you&#39;ll probably be ordering &#34;your special&#34;  the next time you come in!  And believe me, they&#39;ll remember what you had!)  EVERYTHING IS THAT GOOD! 

When I moved back to Seattle after 15 years of living in Chicago, I was craving and looking for a place that had fresh quality fish at a decent price. One day, I saw Five Hook&#39;s special (not to mention seeing their VERY reasonably priced menu), and decided to give it a try. Even though the place was not as busy as other places on Queen Anne Ave.,(for some reason we think that busy means good...while usually it&#39;s the totally opposite) I am so happy that I gave Five Hooks Fish Grill a try as now it&#39;s my &#34;go to spot&#34; while either dining solo, enjoying an evening with friends, or entertaining out of town guests.  

Granted, the exterior might not be that appealing (and maybe even a little misleading), but don&#39;t let that stop you from coming in and enjoying their amazing food! What a hidden gem this place is. After one meal at Five Hooks Fish Grill, you&#39;ll be hooked! (Sorry, I couldn&#39;t resist!)

PS: Did I mention they have a great wine selection/paring, nice beer on tap selection, and a full bar?"

The crispy scallops are a favorite of mine - they are perfectly battered and fried, and served with a trio of delicious dipping sauces to boot.  We&#39;ve never had trouble getting in, and parking in this edge of Queen Anne is almost always doable.  It&#39;s a perfect spot for a light, summertime dinner."

I arrived for dinner early and got to sit on their spacious patio.  For dinner I ordered their crispy cod taco plate and the waitress graciously subbed the grilled zucchini for me instead of the fries.  Everything about the dish was perfect and I polished it off easily.  The fish in tacos were crunchy, not greasy, and the combination with their cream sauce, hot sauce, and coleslaw went so well together.  The coleslaw is creamy but not heavy like others and the grilled zucchini was basic but a nice and healthy alternative at times when I don&#39;t want or need fries.

However, unless you can spring for the really nice seasonal fish, their Atlantic farm raised salmon is what&#39;s used for everything - sandwiches, wraps, etc. It&#39;s not that great. The wrap has a LOT more rice than fish or anything else, so I&#39;d avoid it."

It combined Japanese style and Nordic style of interior decoration. After I got a table, I ordered firstly a cup of Edamame which was hot-boiled soybeans with sea salt. They was salted, but I like them. I do not recommend if you do not like eating oversalted. I had waited not too long before I got first a little bowl with green soybeans that looked appetizing. A taste of this appetizer was saltly and savory. When you begin to eat something briny, you can&#39;t stop it. It like I was eating crack beans. Before I finished the Edamame beans, the mouthwatering ramen had come.

Next, I ordered a big bowl of Shoyu Ramen, a rich soup with slightly sweet soy sauce, two pieces of pork chashu, bamboo shoots, vegetables and roasted seaweed. Then, I requested to add more topping with a seasoned half-boiled egg. A raman soup looked concentrated and smelled aromatic from the intense soup with sliced scallions, so I began first the soup. The soup was seasoned because it&#39;s soy sauce soup. For me, personally, I loved this soup, and I didn&#39;t put any seasoning anymore. I just kept eating the other staples, but they did not surprise me except the perfect browned medium-boiled egg. The runny yolk egg melted in my mouth therefore I did not need to chew. A taste was not only eggy but also mellow from seasonings. I didn&#39;t know what the seasoning they put in it. It&#39;s fantastic. Do try this restaurant!!!!! You won&#39;t regret it."

I think maybe getting a heater or two outside would  make the wait outside more bearable and possibly a bench or two (maybe they don&#39;t have these due to fire hazards, I don&#39;t know). 

The ramen was very flavorful and a good size . We had to remind our waiter twice to bring the extra toppings we ordered, and it was 3 dollars for one small shrimp, but it was tasty nonetheless.

They came out super hot and so fresh. Boyfriend and I each got the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen, his traditional and mine low sodium. From what the waitress the as saying the low sodium one would have less flavor than the traditional. I tried my boyfriend&#39;s and his tasted a little stronger, but mine was definitely not lacking in flavor. Both were delicious! I love their noodles, they&#39;re a little eggy and the perfect consistency. The portions are fairly large and hearty. I finished all of mine and was comfortably full :)

All their broth is made in house so it&#39;s full of nutrients and perfect if you&#39;re getting sick or are sick as it&#39;s that time of year! We got seated right away as well at 1 o&#39;clock on a Saturday afternoon."

Parking: There is plenty of free street parking. There is also a paid parking garage across it. 

Service: It is prompt, and the staff is friendly in ensuring you like the food and get water refills. 

Ambiance: It is a bigger space than the Bellevue location but similar to Northgate. I find their seats to be comfortable and cushiony which I like. 

Order: I almost always get Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, $12: I get the low sodium which is honestly still salty for my taste (which I find that the ramen places I have eaten is salty for me). I like the chewiness of the ramen noodles and the egg (that is still runny - yum). It is one of the better ramen places in Seattle. 

Verdict: 4 because of the deliciousness of the ramen and service. Note also that this place used to be Kukai, but I didn&#39;t taste any change in the ramen."

When I came here on their soft opening I had ordered the garlic tonkotsu ramen and when I was here Friday, I got the spicy miso. Both have really good flavors and was not too salty in my opinion. The only thing I wish was there was more spice options for the people who eat spicy and/or prefer their food spicy haha. 

This location is pretty new so decor and atmosphere is really lively. It was really hot Friday and I was surprised at how many people wanted hot ramen. I overall have had really good experience with food and service so I&#39;ll be coming in whenever I&#39;m craving ramen.

If you&#39;re not familiar with Kizuki, it&#39;s a chain restaurant that started in Japan focused on, yup, you guessed it, ramen. Not that this really needs to be said, but it&#39;s certainly worth mentioning that the ramen we&#39;re talking about is not the ramen you had as a college student, but a wonderfully rich noodle soup/dish.

We rolled in for our 6:30 res (they were taking reservations for their soft open, something they won&#39;t be doing going forward), and the place was packed, and had a great energy. We checked in, and then noticed a couple of possible seats at the bar that were taken over by a couple of unattended laptops. When we asked the host about those seats, she mentioned the manager was &#34;sitting&#34; there, but would ask if we could take the seats. The manager declined.

And this is my only major complaint about the restaurant. You have a full restaurant, and two open seats at the bar. Why in the world are you, as the manager, taking those seats away from paying customers? When we went over to the bar to grab a cocktail, the bartender was also surprised by the fact the manager had said no to our request.

Undeterred, we ordered a couple of cocktails - a yuzu sour for my lady, and Kizuki manhattan for myself. Both drinks were very tasty, and held us over before we were offered a table.

Upon being seated, our friendly, if a tad frazzled server, came over to take our order. She walked us through the menu, and took our appetizer order. We had the pork gyoza and takoyaki, both of which were fantastic. As for the ramen, I had the tonkatsu shoyu, which had a deliciously creamy broth, while my wife had the shoyu ramen, which had a wonderfully rich and salty broth.

There&#39;s a couple of kinks to work out, but that should in no way slow you down one bit from deciding to go here. I&#39;m convinced we&#39;ll be regulars soon."

We came for lunch on Saturday during their soft opening. Everyone was so welcoming and friendly! The service was honestly really great.

We ordered chicken wings to start. My boyfriend thought they were super plain. I thought they were alright, there was a citrusy glaze they had on the top that made the wings kinda unique to me. 

I got the garlic tonkotsu, I thought it was perfect since I got the low sodium option (I LOVE THAT THEY HAVE THAT). Boyfriend got the spicy miso (I think). He thought the broth was a little salty, unfortunately there wasn&#39;t a low sodium option on this one. The portion size was perfect taking into consideration that we both had a couple wings before the ramen.

I was an idiot and ordered what I thought would be a sugar cane cocktail, that ended up being a shot of vodka. I&#39;m not sure if I just misread the menu from my excitement or what..... Lol. But our server was super sweet about it and suggested that I mix it with pineapple juice. Now that was yummy! 

All in all, a very solid experience. If I&#39;m going to judge based on their Bellevue location.. Make sure to plan accordingly and expect wait times!"

It is a franchise and has many different international locations.  They have a large staff and trained to greet you coming and going in Japanese, &#34;Irasshaimase&#34;.  Maybe if you&#39;re a regular you might hear &#34;maido&#34;.

Kind of a busy place as I figure it&#39;s relatively new.  So, we sat at the bar and ordered and ate from there instead of sitting down to the main seating area.  The bar is quite small, no more than 8 seats packed pretty tight.  Only a couple of couples there so comfortable enough and we get a lot of attention with the bartender there.  

We just had some ramen and order of gyoza so not a large exploration of the menu.  I ended up just eating a few of the gyoza, but I heard the ramen was great and quite filling.

We literally checked every month for several months to see if it was open, so we were happy to finally try it out tonight. We were disappointed...

We saw a lot of people waiting to be seated when we arrived--understandable since it&#39;s new and it was a Saturday night. A host immediately greeted us and asked how many in our party. We told him two, but he didn&#39;t ask for our name. We saw him writing on the sign-in sheet though, so figured they had some kind of system. We patiently waited for a few minutes before realizing they were calling people by name. My husband checked to see if they had put us on the list, and sure enough, they hadn&#39;t. (This is foreshadowing.)

The ambience is modern and cool, but it&#39;s a small place and the tables are jam-packed so close together that we literally could hear every word of the hushed conversations next to us, which is pretty uncomfortable. We also had about four different servers come by our table throughout the experience, which felt a little disorienting.

We ordered the Spicy and Garlic Ramens, and then proceeded to wait at least 30 minutes for our food without anyone stopping by our table. We watched the two couples on either side of us who arrived well after we did get their meals before us and started to get irritated. One of the servers came by finally and casually said, &#34;I can&#39;t find your ticket anywhere, so what did you guys order again?&#34; We optimistically hoped the food was being cooked and the ticket was lying around somewhere. But nope! 

She came back and confirmed she had just put in our order, so I asked if we could at least get a complimentary appetizer since we&#39;d been waiting for so long. She proceeded to offer a lengthy and combative excuse for why it was taking so long, to which I pointed out that both tables next to us had gotten their food already, even though they arrived after us. She said, &#34;well, I can bring you an appetizer, but we&#39;re really busy right now, so it might take longer than your ramen.&#34; She did bring out some complimentary edamame at least, but no apology was ever offered.

The ramen was ok but nothing to write home about, and I wish I had ordered the low sodium option because mine was really salty and over-peppered. 

We had high hopes for this place, but with so many other good restaurants nearby, we won&#39;t be returning."

Summary of Cons: 
*The vegetarian option does not come with tofu, but it is the same price as the meat versions that include a protein. If you don&#39;t eat meat you must up-charge for protein. Cute.
*Everyone in your party should be present, otherwise you feel the shame and question whether you actually do have anyone meeting you for dinner.
*They are mean/rude to their back-of-house employees. Gross.
*Since they are a new establishment you will be inundated with, &#34;How&#39;s the Ramen!?&#34; every time you take a bite and have a pile of noddles dangling from your stuffed mouth.

~Five Minutes Pass~

At this point in time I have been given many looks as if I am a possible lone-eater wasting precious space. I then overhear the manager scold the worker who seated me &#39;early.&#39; And in turn he pleads to defend himself, &#34;She said 10 minutes...&#34;"

The food is delicious and I have zero issues - I have never had a bad meal. I have issues with the staff. They are terrible. You never know who is waiting on you there is like 50 of them all running around. They take no less than. 15 minutes to get your order just for drinks and come back. It&#39;s very messy and it&#39;s such an open space you can immediately tell. It unfortunately has caused me to switch to take out only from there."

My mom wanted to try Kizuki and I kept complaining about how it wasn&#39;t going to be good the whole car ride to the restaurant.  I know...I revert to a child around my parents.  Anyways, maybe it was the low expectations but I was surprised by the quality of the food!  I got the garlic tonkatsu shoyu with thick noodles and upgraded to fatty pork belly.  The broth was flavorful, the noodles were al dente and the pork was melt in your mouth soft.  My only one gripe was that the broth was too salty.  But they do have the low sodium option which I will opt for next time.  We also tried a bunch of the appetizers, the prawn cutlet, takoyaki, geso karaage, and the chicken wings.  I liked all of them and would order them again in a heart beat.  Everything was packed with flavor.  I like that this location has a parking garage too so we didn&#39;t have to drive around looking for parking.  The décor is nice and bright and the staff was very friendly.  Might be one of our regular spots when we are back in Seattle."

My review will be updated when I have time to try it. I&#39;m so sad! I was looking forward to it all weekend!! 


I finally went yesterday 08/04 and the wait wasn&#39;t bad. They had told us 10-15 minutes but we only waited 5 minutes which was great!! We sat down and the seating was well spaced out and comfortable. We ordered wings and gyoza. The wings we&#39;re good and crispy although I wasn&#39;t a fan of he citrus flavor but that&#39;s my personal taste. The gyoza was great although I thought the pieces would be a little bigger. 

At first one of the waiters brought out an extra bowl of noodles which we didn&#39;t order. A couple minutes later he came back with my spicy ramen. Noodles were cooked perfectly! Egg was AMAZING!!! And the spice wAs just right. The broth was the right amount of richness as well. It didn&#39;t make me feel nauseous afterwards. 

My boyfriends ramen hadn&#39;t come out yet so I was eating alone. One of the waiters (I&#39;m assuming he&#39;s the shift lead) came over and apologized for not having his ramen ready, but it was put on someone else&#39;s table and he didn&#39;t want to serve my boyfriend that so they were making a fresh one for him. Kudos and major points for that and letting us know instead of just having him sit there! 

We will definitely be coming back and maybe experience ordering to go!"

The yam noodle option was much better than I expected. Next time I&#39;ll opt for a spicier broth and maybe branch out with the toppings. 

I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be in here now and then for some chilly weather comfort food. I hope the service tightens up as they work out the new restaurant kinks."

Even though I had already eaten dinner, I was so excited they were finally open, I ate again. This is exactly what WS needs, a hip, tasty ramen place. Both my husband and I had a really flavorful bowl of ramen, and not salt heavy. My husband got the takoyaki for appetizer and gobbled it up. I got the chicken rich, wow, yummy. It&#39;s exactly what it&#39;s called, a rich velvety, chicken broth with perfect noodles and white breast meat chunks (off of a chicken, not like lunchmeat). Husband got the garlic tonkatsu ramen and he loved it, commenting throughout all of his slurping. Long story short, we are both so giddy this place is finally open."

Both were very flavorful and  delicious, plus this place comes with an extra topping menu that I&#39;ve only seen at one other place.   
  I opted for the pork belly chashu and it didn&#39;t disappoint!! I highly recommend the agedashi tofu, karaage chicken and spicy ramen. Definitely making the drive from Tacoma to eat here again because it&#39;s totally worth it."

I stopped in last week and hooked up with some lovely garlic tonkatsu ramen with a side of krispity-krisp kara-age chicken. Daaaaaaaaaaamn good, son! A+ on presentation, attentiveness, cleanliness, and professionalism. I wanted to try the bottled specialty import beers from Japan (drawing a blank on the names at the moment) but cannot justify shelling out $9 for a bottle of beer. In that vein, although everything was great, a $12 bowl of ramen seems pretty steep, but this is based on the perspective of someone who has visited Japan many times, a land where ramen shops abound and quality vastly surpasses price.

My advice is to not lose the new restaurant momentum. Keep the good food coming, don&#39;t drop your guard. Running a great restaurant is a marathon, not a sprint. Can&#39;t wait to visit again!"

I&#39;ve tried ramen in the Bay Area and Los Angeles, and this place beat both. I usually go for veggie ramen because most ramen spots&#39; pork broth and pork give me a stomach ache (questionable huh?). However, when I read that Kitzuki makes their broth over 10 hours and most of the reviews praised their pork, I decided to give it a shot and I&#39;m so glad I did. I got the Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen with low sodium and wood eared mushrooms. It was so rich and flavorful, I didn&#39;t want it to end. The pork broth and meat were the best quality I&#39;ve had in ramen and no tummy ache after either!! My boyfriend got the Ten Don and he loved it, lots of variety and flavors!

Kizuki (but I&#39;ll always remember it as Kukai for &#39;poop&#39;) is my favorite ramen joint in Seattle. We always go to the one in Northgate when we catch a movie so when they announced a West Seattle location just blocks away from our place, I was pretty darn giddy.

The food is fantastic just like the other locations so no surprise there (my favorites being the Low Sodium Yuzu Shio Ramen and the Chicken Wings). The decor is classy and has a breathable open feeling to it. Considering we went to the soft opening, some kinks were to be had, but I have no doubt that the service here will get better and better. The best part was that as we were leaving and we received the usual &#34;Thank you! Come again!&#34; some of the staff cut their lines short and went for the &#34;Arigato gozaimasu!&#34; as if they remembered they had to say it in Japanese. It was funny to say the least and we left with a smile.

All in all, once the weather starts reverting back to Seattle&#39;s old self, I can&#39;t wait to come back for a nice hot bowl of ramen."

went here as a group of 7 (3 kids, 4 adults)
**i have never been to japan so cant say what is authentic, but i did live in hawaii for years and have plenty of experience eating ramen**

started w gyoza which was as typical as any restaurant...good, taste just like when i make them out the bag from costco.
the takoyaki octopus balls were worth eating, this i was happy to eat...i would have to go back another day to confirm if they were actually good and worth going back for or that i was just starving at the moment

2 ppl had the vege ramen, one low sodium and one regular....both were unhappy with how tasteless it was, not much flavor.
i had the tonkotsu shio ramen which was ok, but way too salty for my taste...i wasnt sure why they had low sodium options on the menu, i assumed it was for ppl with diet restrictions (which i do not have) but now i know its because their food is salty! if i ever go back i would get the low sodium option.
1 person had chicken shoyu ramen, which again was okay but nothing special, and also salty
the last adult had shio ramen and was not impressed... he was a friend from europe and this was his very first time ever having ramen.

the food was ok, nothing to keep coming back for (maybe the  takoyaki octopus balls?)

for noodles we normally go to samurai noodle in international district or other places near to try...we will keep making the drive over there as we prefer it over kizuki. samurai noodle does make their own noodles FRESH! and there is a huge difference in texture and taste.

i think the nice thing about kizuki is the atmosphere and style....but when i go out to eat thats low on my list....i want amazing food as the top priority"

Ive been to Japan five times knowing  the food and service well. I know they just opened but they should have been better staffed. Pecos BBQ in West Seattle was way overstaffed with their opening yet had terrible BBQ. I have higher expectations just based on the other kizuki Ramen places I&#39;ve been to over the last few years. Gyoza came quick but was greasy. It took 25 min to get my ramen yet the couple next to me got theirs 10 min before me yet I orderd before them. To make matters worse my ramen was warm and not hot like it should be. I also had to remind my waitress to get my beer 20 min in. I&#39;ll maybe give them another chance in a few months.

Sadly I cannot say the same about the service. From the supercilious host who tried to skip over us on the waiting list to the server who gave us good ordering advice (don&#39;t order the low-sodium options, they can bring you a small bowl of clear broth if too salty) but then never checked in again and forgot our drinks, this was not a hospitable environment.

The shio ramen is delicious as always and the chicken karaage is perfectly tender and succulent and goes well with the sauce that is served with it. The prices are good for the quality of the food.

He asked us about the things we liked and made recommendations for our personal tastes. We had their Chicken Karaage and two bowls of their Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen.

Unfortunately, I ended up walking out. Here is what happened: I entered the restaurant and everything looked great. The place was clean and presentable. Since I was by myself I got asked if I wanted to sit at the bar or counter. Since I was on an hour long lunch break from work I decided the safest would be counter. I was ready to order the moment they sat me down but the person greeting me left. So I waited for a server to come up to me. After a couple of minutes waiting, I thought they were probably preoccupied, which I completely understand. Then another guy comes in and gets seated next to me. Seconds later he gets a glass of water and shortly after the waiter comes back and takes his order. All while still I&#39;m still waiting. I decide to leave and let the girl at the front know the situation. A gentleman then comes up and was apologetic and asked if I wanted to order to go. I decided not to wait any longer and grab a slice of pizza around the corner. 

My thought is don&#39;t go if you&#39;re short on time. I am not upset because I know stuff happens sometimes. Giving it 2 stars based off of the experience until I decide to try the place again. 

UPDATE: I did return two days later and enjoyed the service from the wait staff. I ordered a ramen and an appetizer. It was delicious. The staff was very attentive not only to my needs but to everyone else. They made sure we were doing okay every couple of minutes. 

Sometimes people have off days and I get it. Regardless I was still excited to try it. Definitely a must try!"

I&#39;ve gleefully dumped many hundreds of dollars into the Bellevue location, and was ecstatic to learn there was a west Seattle location opening.

Overall it&#39;s a good experience, and the food is just as delicious as the other locations.

Unfortunately, every single time I&#39;ve been to the West Seattle location, the tall host that looks like an older version of Ferris Bueller&#39;s friend Cameron is working. Whether I&#39;m there to sit or even just for take out, it&#39;s as if he&#39;s trying to talk us out of eating there. My friends have noticed it too. Everyone has off days, but this is 6 times out of 6 now.

He always overestimates the wait by more than double (even for takeout) and looks at me as if wanting to eat there is the most unfathomable idea he&#39;s ever heard. It&#39;s incredibly off-putting, as if he&#39;d rather fewer people would eat there.

It&#39;s too bad because the rest of the staff is awesome, but your first impression will be someone passively encouraging you to leave. If you can get past that, tasty food awaits."

I understand this is Osaka ramen which is different from Tokyo ramen however there are similarities. My first impression of my miso ramen was that the broth barely covered the ramen, it was filled to less than 2/3 of the bowl, which was very disappointing. My second disappointment was with the chashu (pork slice) which accompanies most ramen dishes. It was a very thin slice, dry, chewy and tough. It should be thicker and melt in your mouth tender. 
Service was erratic, understandable considering this is week #2 after opening. I had asked that our izakaya precede our entree ramen however it arrived sporadically throughout our dinner. My Sapporo draft beer was barely cold almost luke warm.

I had the pleasure of eating lunch here with my family and ordered the Spicy Ramen, the broth was good and the noodles had good texture. I am spoiled and have had some incredible ramen in my lifetime, but this restaurant does make good ramen. The rest of our party ordered the Garlic Ramen and all were more than satisfied.

My family and I ordered Takoyaki, the garlic tonkatsu shoyu ramen and the rich chicken ramen. The takoyaki was very flavorful, and as it was my first time eating octopus, I was very satisfied with it. The ramen took a little long to come, but the waitress we had was very apologetic about it, which I understand because it was very busy when we came in. The rich chicken ramen, was VERY similar to top ramen which was disappointing because it was $11 for something that tasted so similar to the $1 ramen packets you could get at walmart. But the other ramen made up for it. Although still a little too salty (even after choosing the low sodium option) it was still very good, hence why I&#39;m giving this 3 stars instead of 2. I would definitely go here again if I were closer, but because I&#39;m not, I dont see myself ever wanting to make the effort to drive here again."

I was intimidated by the long line outside but thought ok well maybe it&#39;s not so bad and that means it&#39;s popular. We walked in and immediately got seats at the bar (score!). Good mixed crowd and you can see the cooks make my the food. The bar had a decent selection of libations from near and far. The have sake on tap. Unsure what to think of that. We ordered gyoza to start which was wonderfully breaded and fried juicy chicken thigh. It&#39;s served with a spicy aioli. I got the miso ramen. The noodles aren&#39;t made on site but they are made for them and are super fresh. The broth had a depth of flavor and strong umami. Only critique is the broth seemed a tad too salty and the bamboo shoots were too chewy. I didn&#39;t know they had a low sodium option so I might try that just to see. I&#39;m really just nit picking. I slurped down almost every drop of broth.  I will happily go there again.

Actually, it was more like a steady stream of diners the whole time we were there, but nobody seemed to wait too long.
We both decided on a Benedict breakfast - mine with country gravy, ham and biscuits and my dining partner something with avocados and spinach, but with a traditional hollandaise sauce...or at least we thought...the sauce lacked the lemony brightness of a typical hollandaise, but it was good nonetheless. While we were waiting for our orders, we decided to give the cinnamon roll a shot. It was pretty good- topped with ooey-gooey caramelized walnuts. Generally, I prefer mine without nuts, and with frosting, but it was good anyway, and satiated our need for something sweet. As a side note, I gotta say that the hash browns that came with both of our meals were delicious. They were crispy, and tender- hash browns done right! Our service was prompt and friendly. 

So, if you happen to be in this area, and looking for a good breakfast, this place fits the bill."

Very generous portions, we&#39;ll crafted, but simple breakfasts. A step up from greasy spoon, but still on the same staircase. The Egg and Us is a nice face-lift on the space. Tidied up a bit, a nicer bar area, but an accessible weekend family brunch spot. 

I was a little surprised by the quality of the food. I ordered a special from the menu, called the Issaquah Strata, and it was good. Really really good. Generous in size, lots of good fresh veg and clearly good bacon inside. Unbroken Hollandaise! Worth an extra star every time! Plenty of paprika on top and nice balanced flavors.

The fruit side was large and also very fresh. Only quibble would be mediocre drip coffee, but otherwise a very impressive meal for not a lot of scratch.

The menu is quite extensive with all types of egg and non-egg selections. The cinnamon roll on the menu was calling my name. However, at nearly $5, I figured it might be bigger than my head, so I passed, sadly.

I ended up ordering the California Omelet -- chopped bacon, cheese, green onion and tomatoes on the inside, with a dollop of sour cream on the outside). It reallt should include avocado. I mean, that&#39;s pretty California to me! Yeah, I could&#39;ve paid $1.50 to add it. But I also could&#39;ve stopped in at TJ&#39;s beforehand and gotten a whole one for about that price range (Hmm... there&#39;s a Yelp tip!).

The dish came with a side of hash browns (you can opt for fruit) and the house made biscuit.

Having just been to Morsel &amp; Bean, I had biscuits on the brain. The biscuit here has a texture and look of an English Muffin on &#39;roads. I slathered it up with some strawberry jam that was on my table. The biscuit was good, not great. The jam was pretty good, though. It seems to be house made as well.

There is plenty of seating inside as well as a large patio. The nice thing is it was spacious enough inside to fitl my big-ass stroller. That&#39;s a major plus for any eatery in Ballard.

Again, I have to reiterate that the staff were the best part of the meal. Super friendly and courteous. My server opened the door for an older gentleman in a walker, who I think she saw from across the restaurant when he was getting out of the car from the street.

Also, the guy who seated me got the door for me when I was exiting. That was a first for any restaurant I&#39;ve been to with my baby. The courtesy makes a huuuge difference!

I think I&#39;d come back to try that cinnamon roll. My husband would probably go for the Elvis Presley French Toast."

The background music was at a nice level, so it didn&#39;t interfere with normal breakfast conversation (which I greatly appreciate). But I had a bad feeling when I saw every table had their coffee cups upside down, directly in contact with the bare tabletop. I can&#39;t remember if that&#39;s a safety violation or not, but eww! Hoping they were careful about the sanitizing solution used to wipe the tables, we ordered the coffee. I&#39;m no fan of our local bitter-coffee seller&#39;s product, but this brew was flavorless. 

So, we ordered, and the food came out really really fast. They&#39;d changed some of the recipes used for items supposedly adopted from the last cafe at that location (or were supposed to, according to the old owners). Most notably, the new sausage gravy had a pale orange tinge to it, and tasted vaguely cheesy.  It was still edible, but it was unlike any sausage, country or cream gravy I&#39;ve ever tried. The portion sizes on some items were smaller, and the hashbrowns were mushy yet dry, browned but not crisp. Like the grill had used up all its grease on prior orders. The plating had an old-school look &amp; feel to it, garnished with an orange wedge atop a piece of Romaine. Cottage cheese was available on the side, which I hadn&#39;t noticed on a menu for years. 

This visit reminded me that it&#39;s been way too long since I&#39;ve been on vacation. It was like being on a roadtrip, and stopping for breakfast at a cafe that&#39;s miles from the nearest small town. Unfortunately, this one just didn&#39;t measure up. It wasn&#39;t the worst, but I was hoping for better food. Will give them a few months, and probably give them another shot."

On my last night in Seattle, I looked on Yelp for a place nearby. In particular, I was looking for real food, not food that is overly hyped, overly priced, etc. Eventually it lead me San Fernando Roasted Chicken. I ended up making a to go order for the following after looking over the online menu on the business website:

Arroz Con Mariscos, $16 prior to tax (taken to go)- Delicious fried style rice with an assortment of seafood that included muscles, scallop, fish and shrimp. The rice had a great tomato based flavor that kind of reminded me of paella. An order of this entree can easily feed 4 people. 

Parihuela, $16 prior to tax (taken to go)- Tasty tomato based stew that had an assortment of seafood like the Arroz Con Mariscos entree that included octopus, shrimp, fish and muscles. The soup had a great flavor that wasn&#39;t spicy (great for this non spicy eater). This entree can also be enough for 3-4 people. 
---------------------------
(Total= $35.07 after tax) 

When I called on the phone to make my to go order, the employee did have some trouble understanding me on the phone (it also does not help that I was not able to pronounce the name of the stew entree) but eventually made it work. I was told that the food would be ready to pick up in 20 minutes. So my husband and I left 20 minutes after to this place to pick up food. 

I thought it was kind of odd that after we paid, that we still had to wait for our food. I just assumed it would be ready to pick up. But we waited, but it wasn&#39;t a really long wait, but still had to wait. 

We were given two small containers of the green sauce that is spicy (although it did taste good, wished it wasn&#39;t so spicy for me though). 

The parking lot is rather small and when we came, it was full. So my husband tried to find some street parking but there was none. But when we drove back to the restaurant, there were 2 parking spots open. So if you come here, just know that the parking situation may be a challenge. 

Also the seating area in general for this restaurant looks small initially but there was a whole other room that was not being in use, with the lights off in the room. 

Also when I used the ladies restroom while we waited for the food, I found it strange that in a single use restroom, there were two toilets that were side by side. But being that it was a single use restroom, you can just lock the door for privacy. But just find it weird of the set up. Someone took a photo of the two toilets side by side and uploaded it to this Yelp business page if you are curious. 

Anyways, the food was pretty good and the prices are within line with other Peruvian restaurants. I would come here again in the future."

When we realized this restaurant was closer than it&#39;s sister restaurant in Lynnwood, we were ecstatic. My mom would take my siblings at least twice a month. If not with them, I would go on my own at least once a month. That said, my rating isn&#39;t going to be based on the food. The food is fine. It isn&#39;t exceptional, it isn&#39;t bad. It&#39;s as close as you&#39;re going to get to 100% authentic Peruvian dishes in Seattle. This review is based on the offensive and outright poor service my mom received.

Long story short: my sister would always end her meal with a flan. When they requested one, the taste was a little off so they requested a different one. The server happily retrieved another but as she returned a man trailed behind her. He explained that the flan didn&#39;t go bad it&#39;s just that the milk used was different. His wife makes flan with one type, and the other (the one my sister preferred) was made from gallon milk. My mom thanked him for explaining it and let him know her daughter just preferred the other one. As he walked away, he ended the conversation with a simple: &#34;yeah. It seems some people just don&#39;t have a taste for quality.&#34; 

Believe me when I say my mom isn&#39;t one to stay quiet but she did. We later found out he&#39;s the owner. None of us plan on returning. I understand feeling offended when someone rejects your dish. We&#39;re all human. But a workplace is not a place to let things get personal. Customers pay for what they like. It&#39;s simple. And it&#39;s always a poor move to outright insult and offend a paying customer."

I remember my husband asking to try this place out a while back and I jokingly told him that it looks like the kind of place where you would get tummy ache. It wasn&#39;t until I look up this place on Yelp that I realized it actually a legit place for roasted chicken with an average 4 stars. 

Came here in the middle of the week for dinner and they were decently busy. I ordered the half roasted chicken that came with simple salad and fries and my husband ordered something which I cant remember the name but it was a lot of rice and chicken. Chicken was fall of the bone goodness and nicely seasoned. The chicken rice dish my husband ordered must be pretty good because before I could ask for some he had devoured the whole plate. He love the rice but said that my roast chicken was better than the chicken he got. Also, the sauce that they brought out with the food are awesome. The red one is actually spicy and the green sauce is pretty good too. 

Service was not great but also not bad. Will definitely be back."

All the food lacked flavor. To make things worse, we ordered chicha morada which was very sweet. We had to ask for glasses of water to mix it with, and make it taste drinkable.

I got the half roasted chicken with a side of plantains and yucca fries. The default sides are a salad and fires which other Yelpers said weren&#39;t very good so I substituted. The plantains were really nice, the Yucca fries were a tad bit too dry on the inside. 
On to the star of the meal, the roast chicken. The chicken itself tasted decent. It was pretty good but not a spectacular. There was a lot more fat and grease in the tray than I expected considering that it&#39;s rotisserie style which means the fat should have all rendered out. The breast was dry and crumbly but the thigh and drum were perfectly moist juicy and tender. The skin was nice and crisp too so full points for that. 
Like a lot of people have mentioned, the green sauce is really really good. It tastes like the classic mint, coriander, chili and yogurt chutney that is always served with Indian chicken kebabs. The chicken itself is kind of one dimensional in terms or flavor but this sauce really helps.

Overall I think the food was good but not spectacular. The place seems quite pricey for a simple roast chicken. I might give it another shot again some day but not something I would want to drive all the way out for again."

You&#39;ve gotta try the green sauce! 

Fried plantains were amazing and the chicken was crazy good. It&#39;s the new benchmark for me on what rotisserie chicken should taste like. I got the dark meat which had way more flavor than the white meat.

The breast was good, but didn&#39;t get enough of the delicious marinade and crispy bits like dark meat did. It was still really good, but not nearly as impressive.

Of course, I was never in the area for anything before, so why would I have known?  BUT!  After a long hard day of kneeing myself in the face (see: Seattle Bouldering Project), my friend dragged me here for foods.  Because after an hour of (failed) spidermonkeying, we needed to stuff our faces.

Had the arroz con pollo (#10) and MAN THAT STUFF IS DELICIOUS!!!  Lots of rice (ohhhhhh so delicious riiiiiice), and the chicken was moist and tasty.  My friend&#39;s chicken was a tad dry (she somehow ended up with white meat while I got dark), but we&#39;re fatties so she ate it anyway.  Whatever is in the green sauce is SUPER SPICY AND DELICIOUS, also.  My nose kept running and I kept eating regardless (why yes, I DO go to fancy places and ruin it for everyone else).  The extra lime-y red onions were the perfect compliment to my super spicy rice.

It&#39;s enough food that I saved some for tomorrow&#39;s dinner, so it&#39;s a decent amount (because, again, we&#39;re fatties).  A little hole-in-the-wall-y, but that&#39;s where ya get the good food at!  Check &#39;em out.  And can I have your onion things?"

The place would be a 5 star affair for me, except I just don&#39;t like their core chicken combos. By default give me plantains or yucca with the chicken. Their normal combo is an iceberg lettuce salad and some american style burger king looking fries on the side...... i would never want such stuff with the amazing chicken.

It&#39;s a real neighborhood place, if that makes any sense, because what they serve here is great customer service and very good food. 

From the outside, you really aren&#39;t sure what you are getting yourself into.  When you walk inside, it isn&#39;t obvious what to do, but after heading to the counter, our group of 8, was seated and on our way to ordering.  Inside there are booths, and what seems to be a banquet area, with larger groups of tables. We were sat here, but couldn&#39;t help notice that it seemed like they were probably still looking to renovate the place (or maybe not). 

The food... well, the place has the name of Roasted Chicken, so everyone ordered chicken, either a quarter, half or whole. Truthfully, non of us wanted to eat an entire chicken, so half chickens were abound. After maybe 15-20 minutes, and a few appetizers, our food started to arrive. 

Yes, the chicken was the star here, it was fall off the bone good, seasoned nicely, just on the edge of perfect, and maybe too salty (I&#39;m leaning on just perfect).  The rest of the plate was fries, and a simple lettuce salad.  

Once you get over the exterior and interior décor, the food is good, and worth visiting again if I&#39;m in the neighborhood."

I never went. I don&#39;t know why, but that was foolish. This place is amazing, and I don&#39;t live that far now, but it would be so awesome if all I had to do to get access to some legitimately bomb Peruvian roasted chicken was take a few steps!

I cornered myself into going earlier today, finally, thanks to my boyfriend who needed to be scooped up from somewhere in the Central District. I was starving like a mofo and had to pick a restaurant that was close by. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was open or closed at first because the &#34;open&#34; sign facing Rainier wasn&#39;t lit up, but the one above one of the backdoors on Charles was. It looked dark and empty inside, too. My boyfriend said we should just go some place else, but I turned into Charles anyway and commanded him to check it out with me. We were both happy we decided to do what we did. 

While I would never argue against the idea that Costco&#39;s rotisserie chicken is the best rotisserie chicken out there for your buck, the Pollo a la Brasa here, while a lot pricier, is probably the best rotisserie chicken I&#39;ve ever tried by far. Perfectly marinated, tender, and straight-up addictive on its own, but especially when a little (or a lot of) aji verde -- that bottle of mildly spicy green sauce they let you have at your table -- is involved. It came with a salad of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and lime juice, and I asked for a side of rice instead of fries. I wished my meal never ended!

But it wasn&#39;t just the chicken. My boyfriend ordered the Lomo Saltado -- sauteed sirloin strips, onions, tomatoes, fries...and crack. No, it was fantastic. My boyfriend kept saying he felt like he was eating some seriously good poutine. It was so simple but so flavorful. The acidity of the tomato added a great amount of zest to the awesome beefiness and starchiness of the dish. I absolutely loved it.

The Papa Rellena -- deep fried mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef -- was not as earth-shaking as the other two dishes on the table but good nonetheless. It came with lots of citrusy onions on the side, which went very well with the mashed potatoes.

Food came fast, although we were one of only three occupied tables at the time. The lady who served us seemed sweet. She smiled a lot, which I appreciated.

All in all, this is a new favorite. I was thinking I was going to twist my office manager&#39;s arm into ordering food from here for our next company lunch, but sadly, they don&#39;t cater. I am going to just have to go back over and over."

San Fernando did not disappoint!  Between our group of three people, we ordered two whole chickens/Pollo a la Brasa and finished it all!  The chicken tasted really good.  It was moist and tender.  It kind of reminded me of Rotisserie chicken.  We had to wait almost an hour because we came right before the dinner rush and I guess they ran out of chicken! OMG! I would definitely call ahead next time to reserve a chicken, if that&#39;s possible, or order a chicken right away when you come in.

One full chicken is cut up in 4 pieces and completely covered in fries.  They also give a side salad with ranch dressing on top.  There is also different sauces that they have to go along with the chicken.  I really liked the green sauce-it wasn&#39;t too spicy at all.

Sounds kind of odd, but it&#39;s hearty, and familiar in all the right ways.  Peru is not Mexico, so their totally different starches.  They have potatoes, pasta, and hominy corn.

I already mentioned the pasta, but I love the hominy with the skewered beef hearts.  If that sounds scary to you, I say get over it!  Hominy&#39;s not that strange.

The serve eggs chicken and olives over a bed of sliced potatoes.  How does no other cuisine have this!?

I took away a star because I&#39;ve ordered a couple of seafood dishes that were only okay.  But then again the place has Roasted Chicken in the name, so I blame myself.

The folks at the place are friendly and are always great with recommendations. The service is quick and reliable. The folks do accommodate specific requests in case of any dietary restrictions.

There is plenty of parking in and around the place. The place also has a party area that on some occasions are bustling with family parties and makes me to believe that the place can be rented out in case you want to plan a Latin style party."

I mean, who doesn&#39;t want chicken doused with delicious green sauce on top of fluffy rice or french fries? Top that off with some fried plantains to sweeten the palate once you&#39;re done and I&#39;d call that an awesome comfort meal any day! If you are lucky enough to live close by, then definitely phone in your order ahead of time and hurry home to eat your meal while it&#39;s still hot.

The pollo a la brasa is is delish! Full of seasoning and there&#39;s great (spicy) sauces to dip with if needed. It was cooked perfectly, where the chicken came off the bone and juicy. Great portions. The fried rice was really good!  They tend to run out of chicken so don&#39;t wait to long in the day to get some. Parking is minimal. Service was good.

Sadly, I was a little disappointed the chicken here was more on the dry than juicy side, skin was soggy vs crispy, and it definitely needed more seasoning.  The green sauce was spicy and pretty awesome tho!  
Also, to save time, I called to order my food ahead of time and thought it was weird I had to ask the person about 10x before she gave me an answer as to how much a quarter or half chicken was, the to-go order took double the estimated time to come out, and the cashier was very resistant in replacing my fries with a small side of rice since the fries would take another 10 minutes to be done, saying I&#39;d have to pay more.  Thought that was strange since fries and rice are the same price.  Finally she got the ok for me to have rice and I was on my way... Only to find she hadn&#39;t put in napkins or utensils, which I had to go ask for.  Maybe it was her first day on the job or some breakdown in language...  Just found it a very strange experience.  Rice and green sauce was really good tho. My fav part.  lol."

The outside of the restaurant looks a bit shady but the chicken is some of the best rotisserie chicken I&#39;ve ever had.  It&#39;s cant beat Costco pricing but it blows it out of the water.

Staffs~ friendly! 

Peruvian chicken is what you&#39;ll come here for! Half is $9.99 and whole is $17.99. It comes with a ton of fries! My fav is spicy cilantro beef. It&#39;s pure magic. Beef hearts are pretty good too. This is on my list of cheap &amp; happy eats! I definitely wish they open later though. But overall, I like this place!!"

I ordered a half chicken with fries and 1ltr drink and it cost me $20.00 which I think it was way too much.

I don&#39;t care for the salad (iceberg lettuce with a few super thin sliced tomatoes, cucumber, and thick ranch. Ew.), but the fries are good. I took one star off because the restaurant itself is a bit dingy, the double bathroom is really strange, and the service is inconsistent (sometimes they are timely and super nice, others they are forgetful and not very friendly). That being said, my husband and I go here all the time. So delicious. The back half can be reserved for large parties.Take-out is usually pretty fast if you are in a hurry.

There are only a few spots and we were lucky to get the last one. So be aware that you might need to find a spot somewhere nearby.

2. Inside the restaurant
It is quite roomy and generally clean. 

3. Food and price
I would say it is mediocre, but not bad. For the price, it is quite expensive. I like the Peruvian beer that they sell, though.

4. Service
They are very nice, which is a plus. 

All in all, I  am not sure if I will return. It was not a bad experience, but not special either. There are a few other restaurants to compare to."

Anyway, this place has some of the best roasted chicken available. Best? It&#39;s definitely one of the best. I had driven past this location many many times and from the outside, I thought, &#34;meh, the place doesn&#39;t look so special.&#34; Judging a book by its cover, yeah, I totally was. It wasn&#39;t until I really wanted to try it out that a coworker and I went. The first words that came out of my mouth was, &#34;this chicken is amazing!&#34; Imagine how boring chicken is, and how much enhancement it has to have in order for it to be considered amazing. It&#39;s like eating cardboard all your life and then suddenly having Emril Lagasse go &#34;Bam!&#34; on to your cardboard and your eyes open up to the possibilities that chicken has. Well, it&#39;s ten times better than any roasted chicken I ever had at least.

Ok, so when we got in, we got seated and looked over the menu. Duh! The first thing at the top on the left is the roasted chicken with fries and salad on the side. Clearly that was what I was here for. But I saw someone post a pic of Inca Kola and my coworker and I had to try it out. At $2 a can, we figured $5 for the 2-liter was a way better deal for &#34;The Golden Kola&#34;. So there&#39;s a choice of a quarter chicken, half chicken, and whole chicken all bone-in. Once we got the goods, there was no stopping me from devouring that chicken other than if I choked on a bone. Dry spots? None! All through and through moist, juicy, tender, and the seasoning was perfect. I have to admit that the skin was a little on the soft side as oppose to crispy, but hey, the seasoning saved it from complete disaster. Price for the chicken is a bit more expensive than say a whole roasted chicken from Costco or Safeway, but the quality is definitely there.

Once done, we picked up a couple take out menus with wrong prices and got back to work still talking about the chicken and sharing the Inca Kola with our other coworkers. The menu is a bit eclectic with offerings like a spaghetti dish to a dish with Catonese fried rice. I thought this place was Peruvian, but it turns out that there are a ton of different culinary influences in the mix for Peruvian cuisine. I&#39;m an open person. I&#39;m willing to give any cuisine the time of day. San Fernando Roasted Chicken did not disappoint. In fact, it was so good, I had to take my wife to the Lynnwood location for dinner...on the same day!"

I am a picky eater, and the chicken was perfectly salted, cooked to where it was tender and just plain great. I liked the salad on the side and it came with a ton of fries.

Cartoon-like almost, where I can put a whole drumstick/fish in my mouth and it comes out looking like a science model skeleton. 

This is handy when ordering the whole chicken here (around $18.) It includes a trillion fries (nothing special to write about) an iceberg lettuce salad with tomato, cucumber, and dressing with a small side of creamy chimchurri. This serves two fatty-bo-batties or 3-4 light eaters. 

The chicken is infused with equal parts flavor from the perfectly-crisped browned skin to the delicious, non-greasy insides. I love salt but sometimes, I have to take a cool drink of Inca Kola to rest my tastebuds! I&#39;ll drink a specialty soda every now and again and because I rarely run into Inca, I&#39;ll usually order it. Sweet, cream soda-ish, and bright yellow like anti-freeze. AWESOME. They serve in single serving cans and full-litre size too. 

I dig the texture of yucca, though not for everybody. They do yucca fries here and my recommendation (along with their fries) is to season them immediately after being fried, as yucca doesn&#39;t hold onto seasoning well any time after that--and the large, starchy bites need the zip. 

I&#39;ve gotten food to-go twice and sat in once. The service is exemplary, but it&#39;s decorated nearly the same as it was when they first opened: it could use a little warmth.  In Peru, everything is in brilliant technicolor there; it would be great to see them bring some in for ambience :)"

Every time I drive by this place on Rainier Ave I tell myself I need to go there and eat some chicken.  This has been going on for over a year now.

So after getting some ramen in the ID and realizing I have nothing planned for dinner I stopped at this chicken joint.  $18.99 later I walk out with a roasted chicken and 2 sides.  The roasty smell of the chicken filled my car and I was hungry again.  Ridiculous considering the amount of ramen I just ate. Promising.

The staff is always friendly, prompt, and accommodating -- but of course, it is uncommon to be super busy any time I&#39;ve staggered in starving like a marooned sailor.

The first time I went to San Fernando I ordered the half chicken with rice and beans.  While the chicken was a bombastic roast carcass digit slurping magnitude, the beans! Oh the beans. So GOOD.  Not your typical pinto amalgamation but white beans cooked tender in garlicky deliciou-madness. Nom Nom Nom.

When I eat a place&#39;s signature dish and it leaves me feeling glorious, I promise to myself that I will return to that spot and flush out the entire menu. So I return. Again and again.

That verde sauce! Holy Green Goodness!  I&#39;ve tried to get the man behind the counter to divulge the recipe.  Ain&#39;t happenin&#39;.

I can not remember specifically what other dishes I&#39;ve tried since the chicken just blots out my memory of any other food, but assuredly, it was all tasty, well prepared, quick, and served hot!

The trout dish hombre showed me as I was leaving last night was stupid delicious smelling. I will try that next, that is a vow! (That I&#39;ll most likely forget when I realize I&#39;m in proximity of the roast chicken.)

Had the half chicken, it was a huge portion enough for leftovers the next day, the fries crisped up nicely by broiling them, also I peeled the skin off the leftover chicken and broiled that too.

My husband had chicken, with onions, tomatoes, and French fries tossed in a yummy sauce that came with a side of rice which was good too. Yes I said there were French fries mixed in they were not soggy surprisingly.

Also got a side of fried plantains which were good.

So we left hungry and mad to had wasted almost 2 hours, they say it was busy, and sure, it wasn&#39;t empty, but it wasn&#39;t even full capacity, and if they knew it was so full why not hire more people? Only two waiters, and that was a good day, because usually they only have 1, so what&#39;s the deal?

At the urging of our fearless leader, the GIS Team and I trekked out to this spot to check it out.. We were told that the chicken was amazing and the portions were very generous. I&#39;m always up to try something new, so heeeey why not..

Ambiance: Its a good size shop that isn&#39;t into fancy trimmings and extra fetter. Plenty of tables abound and seating wasn&#39;t too hard to come by when we came in..

Staff: So-So. They saw us and quickly came by to check on us.. be sure to ask questions about anything and everything on the menu. We asked for a few more minutes and they came back in about 10.. Took our orders and we sat.. I should have timed it.. but I do feel like we waited for quite some time, which was odd considering there wasn&#39;t anyone in the restaurant at the time. The server didn&#39;t really come to check on us but we did see her peek her head out to see if we were still there... We eventually got our food and started to grub. We did have to ask our server to refill our waters quite a few times..

Selection:  Good selection of food! Lots to try and many of the homey-soul filling basics are there. Mmm those plantains..

Price: Fair. You do certainly get what you pay for.. With the price we paid, we all happily left with some leftovers. Though I will say that their &#34;desserts&#34; were a tad overpriced.. We thought they were made in house but when the server showed up with these prepackaged items we were slightly dumbfounded... Again - be sure to ask questions!

Overall: If I had a lazy lunch time I&#39;d certainly go back.. The food had wondrous flavor and the portions were a good size."

Seriously, this stuff is pretty darn delicious to say the least. Whether you order a half or full chicken, you will also get a mountain of french fries that could be used to build a small village.  I had the opportunity to try a few different things while I was here and nothing disappointed.

The one drawback is if your timing is bad, they may not have any chicken available so be prepared by calling ahead. The staff was also super cool about accommodating the large group that I was with and continued to do so when even more people showed up than what I had originally projected.

Reminiscent of Huli Huli chicken. Get extra green sauce for your fries! If you don&#39;t call ahead prepare to wait about 15 min for a chicken.

Don&#39;t be intimidated by the rundown &#34;mini-mart&#34;-esque appearance of the exterior. This only adds to the whole experience of getting some of the best roast chicken Seattle has to offer. The interior doesn&#39;t offer much, it feels like a former fast food joint. Fear not for the ultra friendly (and English speaking) staff will make you feel right at home.

I always get a whole chicken to-go. For $18 you get a whole chicken, side of fries, and a small salad. I usually get a side of fried plantains for dessert. The chicken is so moist and flavorful you don&#39;t need to dress it at all. But they give you this amazing green sauce (chimichurri based?) that brings a wonderful herbal kick to the fries and the meat.

So, I have heard wonderful things about this place. My friend is Peruvian so she told me to go here since it&#39;s authentic and she said it&#39;s actually really good. I come here on a Friday and am so eager to try it. I walk in, and am greeted. However, she just pulls out a menu and tells me to order. I&#39;m confused. Do I order up here and they bring me food? But wait, others are seated and have menus at the table. I&#39;m so lost.

After much contemplation, I just order something that she says is popular for Peruvian food. I can&#39;t remember the name anymore. But it&#39;s basically stir fried beef with spices. with fries on the bottom. Strange. It was $11. I also ordered some authentic Peruvian ice cream and I was highly disappointed when they gave it to me pre-made from some company that you can buy somewhere at the store. I was like ... wtf? But it wasn&#39;t all that bad. Just disappointed that it wasnt some fancy dessert. Ehhh.

The beef stir fry was good, but I didn&#39;t get why it was $11 for that size portion. Seriously. I thought it was worth probably $8 the most. I thought it was good, but not the best thing ever. I think I&#39;m just disappointed because of how awkward I was greeted, ordering at the front, then I see other people getting seated with menus. Hmmm. Odd. I wish I had tried their chicken instead. 

I&#39;m definitely going to come back and try their other foods. And next time, I&#39;m bringing my Peruvian friend. But it&#39;s cool because I learned about how there were Chinese settlers in Peru so that is why there&#39;s chinese food on their menu haha.
Prices are more on the pricey end, like $9-$12 and I saw their $16 ceviche... hmm, I love ceviche but i don&#39;t know if I&#39;d ever pay that much."

I love the rotisserie chicken and the accompanying sauces as a tasty high carb option.  The skin is crisp and flavorful.   Watch out for the fries, they are crispy and hard to resist.  The rice option is still high in carbs, but healthier.   If you are just looking a filling option, they have the best Arroz con Pollo that have had in the US.  

I usually get takeout, but it is fun to stop by on weekends at night.  There is usually some huge family party or Quinceanera going on the in back."

Plantains as appetizer: Generous portion that was perfect to share for 2.

Chicha to Drink, most delicious fermented corn drink from Peru! 

I love the condiments here, that may be my favorite part of the meal is deciding between using the Cilantro &#39;green&#39; Sauce, the Habenero &#39;orange&#39; Sauce, Mayo or ketchup (or like me mixing em all) in order to dip your chicken and fries in.

In general, my biggest problem with this place is that the flavor is a little bland.

For appetizers, we had the &#34;Ocopa&#34; (bland) and the &#34;Papa Rellena&#34; (which really lacked on the stuffing. It was mostly meat, but it needed more flavor, and definitely more olives, more eggs, and where on earth were the raisins?!?!?)

For the main course, &#34;Lomo Saltado&#34; and &#34;Trucha Frita&#34; were good. We also had 1/2 &#34;Pollo a la brasa&#34;--a little lacking on seasoning.

To drink, we had the &#34;Chicha Morada&#34;, but were disappointed that it had no lime flavor, or any fruits chunks. I thought I was in McDonald&#39;s :( 
I&#39;d also love it if they started offering Inca Kola diet (they only had regular)

And for dessert, we tried the King Kong (Lucuma flavor, since the traditional version was only available as a whole cake!). This was a disappointment, I discourage you from venturing in anything other than the classic King Kong.

We also tried the lucuma ice cream, which is exactly what I had in Peru when I went there earlier this year.

The alfajores weren&#39;t done quite right--they had a strong butter flavor, but my friend liked them anyway."

This little bar room holds its own though, as it is just as elegant as its sister-bar next door. It really has a charming feel that totally sets the stage for what you will get set to experience in a short while. Because it is the smaller bar, this is well suited for grabbing some aperativos along with some small bites. You can start an oyster platter or have a meat and cheese board. Either option would be appropriate here, but if you want neither, they&#39;ll supply you with some simple salted chips to snack on.

The space is small but it&#39;s a pretty long bar that can fit a good amount of 15-16 people and the there is a table in the back that can fit a larger party. A perfect accompaniment to The Walrus, and perfect for an aperitif before dinner or a night cap right after your meal!"

Some of the best service I&#39;ve ever gotten. The waiter was very persuasive (in a non pushy way) about us trying the sardines even though I&#39;m not a fan of fish. I&#39;m really glad I did, because it&#39;s something unique that not all restaurants serve.
The staff here are extremely thoughtful and definitely put the customer first. The server brought bread to soak up the delicious sauce from the meatballs. We came right before closing and they only had 5 oysters instead of 6 so they just gave them to us on the house. When the server praised the great heritage of the cherries in their wine, we asked if we could get a sample of just the cherries and he obliged! I&#39;ve never experienced this kind of customer service at a place of similar price point.

I&#39;d recommend everyone to come try this place. I had so much fun I forgot to check in or take photos."

we came here while we waited for our table at the Walrus &amp; Carpenter.  the two establishments are by the same owner, so this is a normal thing to do.

we had a some cocktails - very fancy and delicious. 
great service. 
half dozen oysters - very good selection.
fresh bread &amp; olive oil
italian sardines - my first go at these and i was pleasantly surprised.  served in the actual sardine can (nice touch)

limited seating b/c it&#39;s basically one long bar and one tiny table waaaay in the back. 

overall, great quality for the very limited menu they offer.  very easy and comfortable way to pass the time until your table is ready or if you just want to chill here and have some light PNW snacks.  

good find!"

A year later and it&#39;s still on my dinner plans when visiting Seattle. Exact same staff as before as well. Spain will be my retirement home one day so maybe that&#39;s why I love this spot so much. It&#39;s a galley bar that can be found on any southern Spain street. Crack open a bottle of red and dip into one of the many delicious sardine cans. If you&#39;re thinking of the crappy American canned sardines then you are wrong. Spanish canned sardines are a delicatessen that is so addictive. Enjoy.

Despite all that, I still had a fabulous time at Barnacle, while killing time waiting for our table at the Walrus and the Carpenter.

I kind of love that you&#39;re brought out a dish of Lays potato chips to accompany your fancy $12+ cocktail. I&#39;d never pair the two together normally (beer and salt &amp; vinegar chips are the only exception), but this was a fun snack.

They have limited small bites available too, although I&#39;m blanking on the one we had.

It was a lovely experience (and whoever chooses their music deserves a high five), but 2 drinks and an appetizer ended up being ~$60 somehow, not quite loving that."

It is a bit difficult to find; the building has a different establishment in front. To find Barnacle, one needs to walk down a long hallway under the small sign toward the back of the building. 

Tips are automatically included in the bill, so no need to calculate.

AMBIANCE: 4.5. Very pleasant to sit at the long bar as the stools are not crowded. Great as a couple. There is a also one table at the far end. Upon entering it appeared full, but we found several open seats after walking towards the back wall. Good indie-type music when we were there, at medium volume. Three of us were able to converse comfortably as we sat along the bar. 
Small chalkboard menus with the glass wines are set on the bar, and there is a separate fuller paper menu.

SERVICE: 4.5. Excellent advice on the wines. Professional, prompt, friendly service.

DRINKS/FOOD: 4.5.  Excellent wine advice - I enjoyed my dark red (La Valentina Spelt) and my partner liked her slightly lighter red (Cabanon Augurio). The serrano jamon was very good. Next time we&#39;ll try a few more of the tapas."

It&#39;s a super cute space, and we were able to find spots at the bar easily. The turnover is fast at the bar, since it&#39;s mostly people having a drink while waiting for a table at Walrus &amp; Carpenter.

The staff was very friendly and helpful - assisting with the different cocktail options, humoring us to take a picture, serving drinks and food with a smile. Their small plates seem designed more for accompanying drinks rather than to eat a bunch as a meal. We ordered the anchovies with chili and butter served with saltines, and although my husband enjoyed it, I found the fish to be quite strong. We did order the Columbia City Bakery bread, and it tasted better with the bread than the saltines.

The drinks are very creative and bitters-based. It was very cool to watch them make the drinks. Good wine and craft beer selection, as well. Overall, a great spot to wait for a table but not necessarily a venue for which I&#39;d go out of my way to eat or drink."
barnacle-seattle,Kan C.,OY0QhxLHumck5FH3mnNDRg,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,8,4,T-QG16K_Yaag1WjGR4A6LQ,4.0,2015-09-10,"Think of Barnacle as the appetizer to your dinner at The Walrus &amp; Carpenter since they have a very limited menu consisting of mostly drinks and because you normally have a lot of time to kill before you actually get a seat at The W&amp;C.  Even though, they provide quality service in addition to offering delicious small plates and fantastic cocktails.

Having been told it was a 90 minute wait at The W&amp;C, it was an easy decision to park ourselves at one of the open bar seats available at the Barnacle.  The decor is nicely done with a long bar and only one table at the end of the bar.  This place is tiny.  Our bartender/server/mixologist asked what we liked and she offered up recommendations based off of what we said.  I told her of my love for Rye Whiskey based cocktails namely the Sazerac and she brought out their version with a twist - the twist being the addition of chartreuse.  It was delicious and a great recommendation.  It helped wash down the complimentary Lay&#39;s chips we were given.        

For small bites, she steered us towards the octopus terrine and the shaved serrano jamon from the huge piece of ham that was literally sitting in front of my face.  It looked beautiful so we had to try it.  The octopus came out first and was delicious and extremely tender.  It was soaking in olive oil and lemon.  We were told the jamon was actually iberico jamon and not the serrano version that was listed on the menu.  Lucky us, because iberico is quite more expensive and tastier.  

A quick lesson on Spanish ham, although both feed on acorns, the Iberico variety only comes from the Black Iberian pigs that are allowed to roam free in the prairies/forests of Spain and is cured for much longer than Serrano ham.  Serrano ham comes from the several different breeds of White pigs that feed and roam in the mountains of Spain and the curing time is much less than the Iberico variety.  For these reasons, the Iberico ham is darker and the flavor is much more rich than the Serrano ham.

The jamon was sliced thinly and with a peach compote piled on top.  The balance of salty fatty pieces of ham were cut by the sweet peach compote mixture for an extremely well-balanced bite.  Also, being able to watch them slice each jamon by order was fun.  

Although not truly a full-service restaurant with a kitchen but rather a quick cold aperitivo spot to enjoy before your meal, Barnacle was a great experience."

They have a great selection of Amaro and vermouth.  They drink selection is great.  The menu is small; plates of appetizer seafood.  I ordered the special for the day; pickled mussels on toast with an herb pesto sauce and aioli.  It was outstanding.  The flavors were fresh and briny.  I wanted the Serrano that they had, it is craved off the leg to order, but I would have been the only one eating it.

A culinary aesthetic, Barnacle is proof of quality over quantity.  Cozy, narrow bar with a sole back booth, now serving prix-fixe dinners. 

Friendly, witty bartenders know their aperitifs like Ballard knows plaid. Barnacle is a Negroni dream come true - an unabashed love affair with amaro.

- Mussels on toast, cilantro pistou - personal favorite. Fresh, luscious mussels. An unexpected preparation and absolutely delicious.
- Anchovy, calabrian chili butter - intensely savory, chili packs heat, butter to add balance
- Duck liver mousse - indulgence nicely done
- Octopus terrine, olive oil, lemon - stunning presentation, food as art. Incredibly thin terrine.

Like everyone else in these reviews, I was actually set on one of the restaurants next door.  

I met up with a friend who suggested Walrus and the Carpenter.  I didn&#39;t believe him that the wait would be long because it was a weeknight and still daylight (meaning it was super early), but he was right; we did have to wait.  Regardless, this cute bar next door, Barnacle, made our wait pleasant.  They had adorable storybook menus and fancy cocktails.  Nautical decor and friendly bartenders contributed to the ambiance.  The vibe was comfortable and mildly romantic.  I would be impressed if this was part of a date night, but it is also casual enough that if a date is not your intention, it&#39;s still acceptably friendly and not awkward.

We contemplated coming back after, but as usual, we were uncomfortably filled to the gills.
Barnacle is an aperitivo bar, as in the Italian tradition, a pre-dinner drink, like bitter cocktails made with prosecco, vermouth, Campari, or Aperol. 

Our visit started standing room only crowded, but as soon as we were able to grab a seat at the bar, it got real comfortable.
First off they were playing the best music, if you grew up in the 80&#39;s, you know what I&#39;m talking about, every time a song started, we were like, are they playing this?! Yes!!
The service was good, especially for as busy as they were. The crowd was chill, everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.

But then my husband saw towards the end of the bar a Jamón holder. The kind where they hand shave off thin slices for you. They serve Jamón Serrano, it may not be Jamón ibérico de bellota, but it was still exciting to see and delicious. We also ordered the Spanish Sardines, which had a nice kick to it.
I think it was one of the most enjoyable bar experiences we&#39;ve ever had."

As soon as we put our name on the list, the hostess recommended we wait and even grab a drink at the bar next door, Barnacle. It was quite possibly the most brilliant idea ever! If only more restaurants were this hospitable, not to mention, friendly with neighboring restaurants. 

So we gladly hopped on over to Barnacle and encountered a sleek bar counter top perched in front of a stunning bar wall. The whole vibe was clean, cool and intimate. 

Our server behind the bar, set in front of us a small dish of Lays potato chips. At first I was perplexed by this choice of bar snack, given the obvious class of the joint. But as soon as I was poured a perfectly crisp, floral, slightly fruity yet not too sweet white wine, I understood and appreciated the simplicity of this gesture.

No windows, but with all of the white walls, its actually really bright and inviting. Recently went here on an early Sunday evening, because we saw on the menu outside the bar, that they had happy hour on Sundays from 4-7pm. 

We sat at the bar and the bartender greeted us and handed us menus. We asked about what the happy hour was and he replied that there was no happy hour. When we inquired about the menu on the door and he just said &#34;Yup,&#34; and walked away. I felt that his demeanor was very curt and with myself working in the food industry, I understand that happy hours change, but a short explanation would have been suffice. 

The food menu is all small plates that the bartenders prepare themselves, so don&#39;t go in super hungry. We ordered the cured ham plate, which came with some pickled cherries. The ham was delicious!

Barnacle has an extensive cocktail menu, with most drinks being $10 and over. They don&#39;t have any beers on draft, but they had three different Italian beers in the bottle. 

Overall the atmosphere is really upscale, but I felt that the staff was a little rude and the food and cocktails were a little pricey."

Took a minute for the bartender to get to us so we snacked on Lays while we waited. Not an issue at all - he was clearly being thoughtful about making their drinks and he didn&#39;t rush through ours, either. 

Ordered bread (very great, came with salted olive oil) and some yummy olives. Lovely spot for a pre-dinner drink.  Haven&#39;t even mentioned the decor - very nice! Makes the daunting potential wait for a spot next door not quite so intimidating... Might just have to try."

My wife and I had another delicious dinner at the Walrus tonight. We both ordered drinks late into our dinner and since we didn&#39;t want to hold up the table, we offered to take our unfinished drinks next door to the Barnacle to finish them. Since both businesses are owned by the same owners, we thought nothing of it. The staff at the Walrus agreed. 

After a few minutes at the Barnacle, the manager approached us and was very rude to us and insisted that we either order something or leave. He was extremely condescending. We were literally stunned by his lecture since we are regulars at the Walrus and have spent money at the Barnacle before. My wife and I were planning to leave a generous tip for the staff.

The great thing is the it&#39;s not so loud, so you can actually talk to your buddy while you drink. 

The drinks are great and the healthy serving of free potato chips is just icing on the cake. I&#39;m not too sure about the food since everything felt like it either came out of a can or was made by someone else.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s still very tasty and worth the visit.

The only thing is that there is no hostess, so it felt bit odd and confused as to if I should just walk in and sit on empty seats or wait to be seated."

barnacle-seattle,Kara M.,Sg2d2hecEZrSSdezHX9tEw,"Seattle, WA",0,1,0,0,621,KKWnyAWe_y2ioC7N15zndA,1.0,2015-05-10,"Heads up:  Be aware of the 18.5% included service charge (supposedly to be in lieu of tip) which is not being disclosed by staff at Barnacle.  I had drinks Saturday night with a friend at Barnacle whilst awaiting a table at the Walrus and the Carpenter.  We ordered two cocktails ($13 and $12).  When I went to pay (in cash), I was not given a receipt and was told the total was $29.  I handed the bar person $40 and made a comment with a smile &#34;when did this happen?  when did two drinks in Seattle become $30?&#34; She said &#34;i know,&#34; took my $40 and handed me back ten singles in return (not eleven - ten).  I left $4 on the bar with the bar person watching.  We then went next door for more drinks and food, which was lovely. ...

When our bill was presented at the Walrus and the Carpenter, the 18.5% service fee was stated on the bill.  We paid with a credit card and there was no place to write in a tip, as per what I NOW know Renee Erickson&#39;s publicly stated intent for the 18.5% service fee to replace tipping in response to Seattle&#39;s mandated increase in minimum wage.  The bar person was lovely when we asked how he felt about this (not receiving tips anymore), he responded in detail and with a very positive attitude, stating this was actually way better for him and for everyone in the end, that they were getting $15 an hour, plus commission, plus benefits including health insurance, retirement, etc.

It seems that this new shift is better indeed for the staff at Barnacle.  It wasn&#39;t until I had arrived home and was reflecting on the evening that I realized that the quoted total of $29 for the two cocktails seemed inclusive of an 18.5% service fee.  I looked online to see if Barnacle had adopted the same policy as the Walrus and the Carpenter, and it had - yet the staff in Barnacle had not disclosed this, and I paid $34 for two small cocktails.  The lack of transparency is not appreciated and feels exploitative and unbecomingly greedy.  

There are many problems with this, merely one of which is: how are staff at Barnacle accounting for their tips (i.e. the one I left unknowingly atop a 18.5% service fee) when the official company policy is now stating there is no tipping.  My guess is that they aren&#39;t.  

I would encourage patrons to be aware at all establishments in Seattle that all employees, wait and bar staff included, are paid a bare minimum base rate of $9.47 per hour PLUS tips, unlike other states where servers and bartenders merely make $2.35 an hr plus tips.  And - now, some establishments, like Renee Erikson&#39;s Barnacle, the Walrus and the Carpenter, &amp; the Whale Wins are paying their staff $15 base, plus commission, etc. which is great, yet doesn&#39;t respect or value the customer when they are requiring a 18.5% inclusive service fee (tip) on all tabs, yet not requiring their staff to inform customers of this.  So, while Erickson&#39;s umbrella organization press release (http://seattle.eater.com/2015/4/21/8463303/three-renee-erickson-restaurants-will-eliminate-tips) states this change in policy is &#34;mostly because we believe that it is right thing to do for our employees, and by extension, our customers,&#34; I would argue that not requiring your staff to inform customers of the 18.5% surcharge, not providing the customer with a paper check/bill listing the costs, giving the customer back ten singles (implying a tip is expected), and then saying nothing when the customer leaves an extra $4, is not exactly &#34;the right thing to do&#34; for one&#39;s customers.  &amp; of course, it&#39;s the principle more than the $4.  : )"

The copper counter drew my immediate attention, but my eyes quickly strayed to the hundreds of bottles decorating the wall, 95% of which I had never seen before.  I fancy myself a wine enthusiast but truthfully my knowledge is quite (American?).  Malbec, Cab Sav, Pinot Noir, etc.  The assortment of wines at Barnacle includes none of these, but rather a vast assortment of mostly (or all?) Italian and French wines, as well as a range of other liqeurs and such that I will make a point to try in the coming months.  

With all of the wines to choose from, I decided on a Foregone Conclusion.  Rye, something in place of Gran Classico, amaro sibilla, and baska snaps.  I have no idea what most of that means but the drink was good.  Full of bite and citrus zest and in general very different then what I generally choose to imbibe.  Different but great.

To eat, we had some of their awesome serrano jamon as well as bread and cheese and something else... terrine I believe, but cannot remember.  I have missed eating these high-brow foods - they are so simple but so appealing.  

Bravo - must return soon."

Smack dab in between Walrus and the Carpenter (and owned by the same person, Ms. Renee Erickson) and Chippy&#39;s (by Ethan Stowell, who also has a neighboring joint, Staple and Fancy, but I digress), Barnacle is an okay place to grab drinks and cold plates while you wait for a table at its cooler older sibling.  It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if this was exactly Renee&#39;s intent. It is a great place to kill time over sips, but it&#39;s not much on the food front. You&#39;re limited to canned, tinned small fish (sorry, but don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth my $12 for some canned sardines and saltines) and a few other overly priced nibbles.

Octopus is good but I normally enjoy the feeling of eating a mouthful bite of octopus which will end up being 2-3 orders of it here.
Gorgonzola here is one of the best blue cheese I&#39;ve had. Please take it as a strong complement as I hate blue cheese in general.
We were also expecting the duck liver mousse but they said their menu changed quite often and it wasn&#39;t available any more. Sad... And the oysters too. So don&#39;t trust the Yelp pics.
What I&#39;m not happy about is that they charge 4 bucks for 4 slices of bread. I don&#39;t mind the tiny slices of jamon for 10 bucks but the bread that typically goes with cheese and ham was overpriced, if not supposed to be free at all. Not the first time in Seattle.."

The list of Italian cocktails is basically impenetrable - I&#39;ve been to Italy many times, consider myself a world traveler and sophisticated foodie, and I really stare at this cocktail menu and don&#39;t know where to go. Drinks are expensive, the food selection is limited, and this bar basically suffocates under it&#39;s own pretentious weight. It was deserted on a Thursday night when we arrived, and deservedly so.

This meant we could have been enjoying their, food, wine &amp; atmosphere for longer than chilling at the coffee/bike shop out the front of the building. 

This has a Corsican/Mediterranean feel to it. The wines we were directed towards were Italian. Usually I avoid these like the plague, however the two our waitress suggested us were great.  

The tapas style plates they have on offer were great! Very reasonably priced and high quality. They even had some locally produced &#34;jamon&#34;. We enjoyed a couple of these with our glass of wine while we waited for our table. 

When our table next door ready we were pleased to hear that we were able to take our unfinished glasses of wine across.

The drizzle of olive oil added a decadence to each bite and if no one was around, I would have licked that plate clean. 

The staff if friendly, talkative and know there way around a bar. We walked in, talked about what kind of drinks we typically enjoy and what mood we were in. I was in the mood for Fernet, and the bartender prepared a drink with another type of liqueur, the name escapes me now, that made it lighter and still gave it an herbal taste. 

The Barnacle is right next to the Walrus and the Carpenter. If you are looking for a hearty meal, I would do both. Go get drinks and an appetizer at Barnacle and head next door to the Walrus for oysters and more."

Anyway, I tried a most interesting take on an old fashioned, made with calvados, walnut liquor, and nocino, which resulted in a deep, rich cocktail, perfect for a rainy Seattle evening.  The rye not was also very good if you are looking for a Manhattan-like whiskey drink.  The menu is also very interesting, with a very tasty if not light octopus terrine.  A better bet would be the happy hour bites, which come 3 to an order.  The space is classic Renee Erikson, with the plenty of white space combined with some very classic touches (loved the copper bar!).

We ordered the jamon iberico, which was ridiculously flavorful, rich, and fatty and just melted in my mouth. We also ordered arroyabe ventresca, which is a fatty tuna. At first, I was a little skeptical of paying $18 for canned tuna, but this one is nothing like chicken of the sea. Again, the tuna was tender, rich, and flavorful and was wonderful paired with the lemon and sea salt. We also ordered the sardines, but this one was meh to me. To go with all of this, we ordered some bread. The waiter recommended that we order a sauce to go with it, specifically the salsa verde, which complimented the tuna and sardines perfectly. He also thew in a jar of marcona almonds for us to try. All these little dishes and sauces individually wouldn&#39;t make for a great meal (except maybe the jamon), but all together made the meal whole and memorable.

The only thing that I would point out is it is pricey, but they importing the jamon and the cans from Spain and hence the price. 

Great place for a date night!"

Been meaning to check this place out for a while but so glad I finally made it!! It can be tricky to find via google maps/iPhone maps. But it&#39;s pretty easy once you get to western! 

The ambiance is exactly how I prefer in my goto places. Dim lit, bright minimalist furniture, warm candles, and beautiful small bar! It&#39;s perfect. 

They have variety of things ranging from jamon aka cure ham to olive oil marinated seafood and things in tins, plates and so on! Octopus looks great. Olives look good. Being the first customer of the day: I took advantage of their happy hour menu! Bubbles and wine are only $5! Tins are $2 off! Yes please! So good I&#39;ll have it thrice! 

Sardines in a can has a cleansing touch. To me anyways because I love sardines! The only thing missing was some kind of arugula or something. They give it to you with sea salt, lemon wedges and touch of espellettes!  Yumm! 

Spanish cure meats were pretty good as well. The salami has a spicy kick! 

They have small but great selection of bitters, wine and even some homemade gin. My friend&#39;s amaro based cocktails were on point! I enjoyed my bubbly cava as well! Their red wine has a stunning aroma to it. A little too spicy for me post bubbles though. But the bartender was super friendly, gave me a taste :) Super cute little oasis in the hustle and bustle of pike market craziness? Yes please. I&#39;m a fan! Can&#39;t wait to come back and spend an evening here for that chill and fun outting!"

The store front is small, but it is right under the Pike Street Hillclimb skybridge.  So if you are walking there from 1st Avenue, you should use the Pike Street Hillclimb as a short cut.  Lots of street parking on Western ave. $4 per hour till 8pm.

Limited seating area due to small restaurant space. There are 2 tables that seats 6 people each. So if you have a group of 4, you might have to share the table with 2 others. Also the bar top seating, which seats I&#39;m guessing 7. 

Service is great. We had great assistance/recommendation with food and drink ordering. They were fast, friendly, and helpful. We ordered all of the Happy Hour food items, and the drinks were also a good deal. We also ordered the Jamon, octopus, mussels, pickled veggies (not much for vegans), and cheese. We ate everything between the 4 of us! It was delicious, fun, and unique. 

Check it out if you&#39;re near by this little gem!"

The concept of jars and tins is...hipster extraordinaire. It also means the portions are tiny and expensive. We didn&#39;t come here looking for a dinner. We came looking for a snack, knowing it&#39;s like this.

We had: 
-Soft cooked eggs with different seafood and veggie toppings: pretty good
-Anchovy stuffed olives: didn&#39;t taste the anchovies at all
-Tin of sardines: It tasted literally like a tin of sardines. That&#39;s about it. Except it&#39;s $7.
-We also ordered some bread and sauces.

This is one of the few places I know that would charge $2 for a sauce to go with your tiny tiny plates of food!  

Between the tiny portions, prices, extra charges, and ok food, I am going to pass on a return trip. A-ok."

By coincidence I&#39;d seen a program about northern Spanish cuisine just a month before coming here, so I was geared up to try jamon and other tapas treats. I&#39;m glad I tried it, but jamon is precious stuff--a little plate of heavenly thin slices will set you back $18. But don&#39;t panic. There are other delicious, less expensive treats to tempt your palate. 

The bartender poured me tastes of two wines before I chose--I would have been happy with either one. Yum.

I was skeptical when my dining companion ordered the canned tuna (yep, that&#39;s a thing in northern Spain) but this is nothing like Chicken of the Sea. It was tender and buttery, served with lemon, pepper powder, and sea salt, and it won me over completely.

We finished with a little plate of sheep&#39;s milk blue cheese served with rhubarb preserves that was so delicious and unexpected it just knocked my socks off. The cheese was umami-rich but not bitter, kind of like a gorgonzola dolce, and the rhubarb was the perfect foil.

You could drop a bundle trying to get full here, but you can&#39;t beat JarrBar as a friendly place to experience novel culinary delights."

Bartender was super nice and cool and asked if we were done with our drinks even though there was just a drop left before taking it away. Totally appreciate that!! :) Sometimes people want that last drop! Never waste liquor is my motto!

Super great place for where you can just chill and hang out or go for happy hour.  It is a Spanish tapas style bar. The only place I have seen in Seattle that has jamón ibérico on the leg where you can just admire. Totally worth spending the money for an order.  You will not find Spanish cured meats like jamón ibérico at the local market so that is why you need to try it!!!!!! The jamón requires a special license to import it from Spain.  I also tried the canned fish and it is great with bread and their Verde sauce.

We also got a jar of green and red olives and dark chocolate with olive oil and sea salt. Is the food and beverage here unlike anywhere else? No. But is this a super chill place to hang out with your friends on a nice summer day? Yeah. I wouldn&#39;t go here specifically for their food again but I&#39;d definitely go here for the ambience and comfort. If it&#39;s a sunny day, get the table by the window and ask to have the shades  drawn up. The bartenders here are extremely nice and service fast too.

Small quaint patio outside, and a small but lovely dining area inside. They also have a deli type display where I guess you can order to go!

We had the Meze Platter, where you can choose 4 apps. We had the Hummus, Babaghanuj, Quinoa Tabuli and Saksuka. We eat a decent amount of Mediterranean foods from a variety of places and my fiance is Lebanese and has a strong reference point, so we are always excited to try new options. This platter was ok. It was a small app starter, decent for two people. Four small mounds of the different items with about 8 pita squares (we really needed almost twice the amount of pita sadly). The hummus was fine- tasty, standard but fine. The Babaghanuj was tasty as well, and standard as well. The tabuli was ok- it is not a standard tabuli and really should probably be called something else. It is all quinoa (which it clearly states on the menu), with a smattering of parsley. It was good, but pretty far from a traditional tabuli. 

The Saksuka... I want to love this dish but it was ice cold and I just couldn&#39;t do it. Hot it would have been great I think. Cold...it made me want to gag a bit. 

The service was friendly and adequate although not much more. We contemplated getting a full meal after the apps and decided to press on with our afternoon and find another location to try for a full lunch. 

A lovely spot with decent foods, and I would happily go back to try an entree. Just be aware that they take artistic licence with the food so you might want to clarify if you are really picky about what &#34;authentic&#34; items are in a dish. If you are pretty open minded you should be fine."

As with most Pioneer Square establishments, the restaurant is a bit smaller so I highly recommend reservations for larger parties (we had a group of eight). 

After going back and forth between a few choices, I settled with the falafel and man, am I glad that I did! I&#39;ve had falafel at other restaurants where it was dry and the spices were overbearing, but Paloma&#39;s falafel had great flavor and texture. I was also pleasantly surprised by the side salad that came with it - loved the dressing!

Other popular choices in my party were the lamb pita and lentil soup (which was my close second). If you&#39;re looking for something a little lighter, I&#39;d recommend the gorganzola sandwich or salad with a cup of lentil soup! :)

Price is pretty standard for Pioneer Square - you can expect to pay over $10 for your meal. In terms of ambiance, I loved the natural lighting of the restaurant and can definitely see myself coming here for a catch-up sesh with a friend or on a date.

It could have been. Not that it was such a negative experience, it just seemed the place had more potential. 

We were seated pretty quickly, and I think there were a total of 2 other customers being waited on.  

We immediately ordered the Yaprak Sarma (grape leaves, stuffed), Kofte, and Falafel plates.  While waiting for what seemed to be far too long, we decided to pass on the wine because nothing on the menu seemed appealing, and then we got to sniff the wonderful scent of... burnt bread? Eh. 

The food finally came out and I was slightly disappointed that the falafel plate didn&#39;t come with any pita bread + hummus, but came with a salad. Granted, the salad was VERY good - as was the falafel.  It just seemed like a lot of money for fried beans and a side house salad.  But I digress. The grape leaves were tasty and the boyfriend loved his Kofte.

Ordered the Quinoa Tabouli and it was another 15 minutes before I got it.  The tabouli wasn&#39;t horrible, but definitely nothing to brag about.  Have always had it with lentils and prefer it that way - gives it more of a texture.  This dish was too soggy and not enough flavor.  Not worth the 9 something that I paid.  After I was done, I waited 10-15 minutes for someone to bring my bill and eventually had to go up and pay at the counter.  Left no tip seeing as how I received no service."

The management is highly unorganized and their operational execution is flawed. I think one woman was in charge of serving the dining room, taking to-go orders, answering phones, etc. It took 15 minutes from the time I walked in to the time I placed a to-go order (3 people in front of me) and less than 5 minutes to actually get my food. At one point, the lady behind me said, &#34;Do you have any idea what&#39;s going on here?&#34; None.

As for the food, to be a real-deal Mediterranean restaurant, I appreciate the uniqueness of their hummus but I have to say, though edible, I didn&#39;t find it to be very good. The prosciutto panini thing was fine. Maybe I just visited on an off-day but three stars for the recognized potential of this cafe."

For the first time ever I had a brand new server and she was very friendly. (Although I&#39;m pretty certain the surly one is &#34;family&#34; so will likely be back.) She still never came to check on the table after taking the initial order, so that hasn&#39;t changed, but she was slammed so I will cut her some slack. She was very nice, though, when we did see her. As usual, our table (and several others around me) either didn&#39;t get a check at all and had to walk up to the counter to get it or had to wait a very long time after the plates were cleared before it was dropped off. I guess that&#39;s just a &#34;thing&#34; at Café Paloma so you have to deal with it or not eat there. This time, though, the owner was there and pitched in to help when the server got busy, while stopping to greet every table. It made a big difference in the experience, for sure. 

Food was yummy, as usual!"

Everything I tried from the Meze menu was a burst of perfect flavor blends.  My friend loved the Yaprak saraia (vegetarian stuffed grape leaves).  I loved the borak (which is like spanakopita with caramelized onions).  Two people had the felafel.  One order wasn&#39;t completely cooked in the middle but it was still so delicious my other friend saw no need to send it back.  Wish I&#39;d had room to try the yoghurt soup and the baklava.  Will have to go back again.  Also loved that it wasn&#39;t noisy (until 7 with live music, but we were out before the).  If you come for the live music, it gets really crowded."

They also have great Red Lentil soup. Every time we get a new person at my office, I use it as an excuse to go to this place! 

The service is good considering they have, at most, 4 people on staff, at any time (cook, waitress, food prep and the owner on the register). Not a long wait time for a table (seat yourself), but crowded around 12pm-1pm...and long wait time on food. 

There&#39;s not much elbow room to eat, but if you bring good company, you probably won&#39;t mind.

Also, they can only split a bill between 2 or 3 credit/debit cards."

Lucky for us, Cafe Paloma was still open and was very accommodating. Had the Köfte and a light Turkish beer--both excellent. My wife got the Meze plate with olives, hummus (excellent), carrot spread, and what are called &#34;dalma&#34; or &#34;dalmati&#34; everywhere else I&#39;ve been. All good.

The atmosphere was easy going with only a few patrons. I was kindly greeted at the door and offered a menu upon request. They have both quick eats (side dishes of different sorts and panini sandwiches) if you&#39;re looking for a delicious lunch on the go, but also a nice sitting area if you&#39;re looking for a sit down dinner. 

I wanted a quick bite so I went with the &#34;turkish version of tabuli&#34; called Kisir. An extremely flavorful and refreshing salad that hit the spot. 

With many more dishes on the menu and full bar, I&#39;ll definitely be returning. 

The authentic atmosphere and service only sweetens the savory and makes Cafe Paloma a solid bookmark in my Yelp."

There were two people serving us: a very friendly woman and a man that also seems nice. After having our lunch we ordered some coffee and stayed there talking for a very good while (maybe 3 hours). There was only a couple more costumers, and plenty available tables, so I didn&#39;t think we were making any difference.

The menu had a nice variety of dishes, though I wish they&#39;d had more than 1 Turkish red wine. The portions were nicely sized - meaning I didn&#39;t stuff myself or have a ton of leftovers. I thought the prices were pretty reasonable. I highly recommend this place for a family dinner or first date.

I ordered a cappuccino, which arrived in a cup twice as large as my companion&#39;s latte, so I&#39;m not even sure the right drink was made.  The milk was not foamed much (which a cappuccino is supposed to be), and had little flavor and a watery consistency.  Additionally, the milk was scorchingly hot.  What type of milk had she used?  Nonfat!  Huh?  If you&#39;re going to try to poison me, just use soy milk and get it over with.  She remade it with whole milk (as it should be), but it was still torched, with little foam.

I had the Kofte plate, which consisted of 4 meat patties, a salad three table spoons of jasmine rice, yogurt and a salad.  The Kofte itself was overly greasy and bloody when I cut into it (I didn&#39;t have the chance to tell my server since she never came to check on me) Traditionally when I eat Kofte it is served with some herbs and this was not, and it lacked serious flavor.   The yogurt had a tiny pinch of mint on top, and there was maybe two tablespoons in the serving dish -- it was warm which I didn&#39;t expect.  The salad was a salad, not much to say and the rice was jasmine rice, and I feel basmati would enhance the flavors in the dish much more.

I love Mediterranean food and Cafe Paloma was delicious.  I had the beet salad and hummus.  Both were amazing, the hummus was especially good--the pita was super fresh and authentic.
I also enjoyed the ambience, very cozy.  Coffee was also very good, made with a french press.
Both gals working were extremely welcoming and sweet:)"

early dinner. The place has a quaint sidewalk cafe type
feel and you can eat outside and people watch if you want.
We chose to sit inside. Place is quiet and great for a date
or any type of dinner where you want to hear your partner&#39;s
conversation. I had the eggplant panini with salad. My dining 
partner had the falafel. They have a small but decent selection 
of foreign beers to go with your meal. This would be a great 
place if you&#39;re a vegetarian as there are a lot of non-meat 
dishes on the menu. Service was very nice and friendly and
non-intrusive. Being that it is Pioneer Square, my dining
partner had to park about 5 blocks away."

I walked in the door of Café Paloma and spotted my friend, who had recommended I try this place.  The tiny place was wall to wall people, but I could see my friend was at the front of the line.  The host (who looked like he might be the owner), said (and this was my first impression), &#34;Well I see you are at the front of the line so I&#39;ll seat you now even though these people behind you are regulars.&#34;  While, I appreciate he&#39;s recognizing these patron&#39;s loyalty, it did not come across very hospitable to me.   This was to be a precursor of the level of service we&#39;d receive during our lunch.   We weren&#39;t escorted to our table, he just pointed.  We sat down and talked for a good 15 minutes before someone came to take our order.  Actually, we thought she came to take our order, instead it was to ask us to move to a smaller table.  Again, no assistance, we had to pick up our water and personal items and again go to a table at the opposite end of the restaurant that she pointed to.  

We waited another 10 minutes and finally she came back to take our orders.  The food arrived in another 15 minutes.  I ordered the mezze plate because I wanted to get a feel for some different items on the menu.   The hummus was good (although extremely garlicky), carrot spread I didn&#39;t care for, and the roasted red-pepper spread was good.   They provided 6 small triangles of pita bread, which was not enough to sample the amount of spread they provided.  I wanted to ask our waitress for some more pita bread, but she never returned.  

We finished our meal and talked for another 15 minutes before we finally saw the owner looking guy and asked for boxes and our checks.  The food itself was ok, the environment cramped, service failed and took over an hour and half for lunch.  

I really wanted to like this place too."

Why haven&#39;t I come here before! The cafe itself is darling, the decor is beautifully simple, warm and inviting. It was a lovely sunny afternoon and I arrived first so I ordered a glass of rose while I waited for my friend. Sitting at the little bar that looks out into the street, I got a bit of sun while avoiding the slight wind. Wine was delicious and when my friend arrived she tried mine and ordered the same. I ate the Cafe Paloma platter. AMAZING. Perfect slices of cucumber and tomato, tasty olives and cubes of feta to top onto grilled pita. The perfect amount of food, left me feeling satisfied and clean. Paired well with the wine. I tried my friend&#39;s stuffed grape leaves, which I&#39;ve never had before. So tasty, love that they&#39;re meatless. Definitely coming back, maybe I can get my bf to join me. He loves lamb pitas.
Oh, my server was super nice as well. A slight language barrier that led to confusion with the bill, but still nice and present but not too much so."

I have to say I was a little disappointed.  I ordered the Chicken PIta and paid $11 (with tax).  The quality of the dish was just okay and the portions were really small.  

This dish comes with some chicken pieces, a side salad and pita slices.  I liked the incorporation of sauteed tomatoes and herbs with the chicken but thought it lacked salt.  The side salad that comes on the side had a nice vinaigrette dressing but the portion size was really small...maybe a half cup of greens?  And, finally the dish comes with about 6 small triangular shaped pita slices which help fill you up but seemed underwhelming. Overall, I felt I overpaid for my meal and was disappointed.

The lamb was delicious and the salad on the side was a nice change of pace. The hummus at the beginning was super tasty, probably my favorite part. Service was quick and friendly, but I do have to agree with the others that the price of the plates was a little high for the amount of food on there.

This tiny cafe lured us in with its display of fresh salads and paninis, and when we entered and saw a baking dish filled with fresh baklava, we knew we had stumbled upon greatness. 

We started off with a mixed meze platter. Meze are Turkish appetizers, served almost tapas-style with warm pita bread. We only sampled three of the options: hummus, shepherd&#39;s salad, and red pepper dip. The red pepper dip was our favorite, a spicy-sweet blend of walnuts, pomegranate seeds, and roasted red pepper. The combination of flavors was memorable.

We also ordered the red lentil soup, which was staggeringly good. It was light and healthy, and I could have easily downed another bowl - probably the best lentil soup I&#39;ve ever had. Finally, my husband enjoyed the eggplant panini. It looked delicious, but I really can&#39;t comment on the taste... he inhaled it before he could share. 

Definitely eat here."

At the point of death, the sailors tell not of their terror but of the love they have for their families.

Evenings are the only times that I have been to the Café Paloma. I have dinner while listening to a jazz group that sometimes performs there. The small dining room is nicely decorated with candelabra, musical instruments (horns), and red papers lanterns. The red painted walls display an on-going exhibition of fine-art photography.
  
When the musicians are playing, the ambiance in this place is quite beautiful.

I usually order a dinner special. But the restaurant&#39;s Mediterranean-style menu lists, among other dishes: gorgonzola salad, with choice of chicken or lamb; eggplant, gorgonzola, prosciutto, or chicken Panini; an assortment of meze (inventive appetizers) such as smoked salmon, sliced pear with goat cheese, bite-sized boreks (spinach, feta cheese and caramelized onions baked in filo dough), stuffed black mussels, hand-wrapped dolmas (filled with rice, onions, currants and pine nuts), lamb kebap, fresh hummus with toasted pita bread, grilled marinated baby eggplants, havuc salata (a salad of carrot blended with yogurt, onions and pine nuts), and kisir (Turkish tabuli salad).

There is also a wine menu as well as a dessert-and-coffee menu.

The owner--Chef Sedat Uysal, an immigrant from Turkey--often greets customers at the door. I find him and his wait-staff to be warm and attentive.  As you can see, I appreciate his effort."

The Mediterranean inspired dishes are all flavorful and made to order, and I can see where the portions might be perceived as small, but in reality they&#39;re still on the high end of what would be considered a proper amount of food.  Meals aren&#39;t supposed to be massive platters piled high with food.  At least not if you spend all day in front of a computer...

The ambiance in the dining room is very comfortable, featuring an elevated section that doubles as a stage for live music and rotating art installations on the walls, which are painted in rich, warm colors.  The tables are smaller and spaced fairly close to each other, but it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re going to be bumping elbows with your neighbor at the next table.

The service can be on the slow side if they&#39;re busy, but it&#39;s usually very courteous and food prep time never seems that long.

I&#39;ve only ever been in for lunch, and it&#39;s an option I don&#39;t take advantage of nearly often enough.  But that makes it feel like a bit of a treat when I do drop in.  It does run on the more expensive side of the typical lunch range (plates start at $10), but I think you&#39;ll find that the food quality justifies the higher prices."

The food was decent, but certainly not the best mediterranean I&#39;ve ever had. Tthe hummus was great (and large quantities) and the bread they give you with it was awesome.

I&#39;m glad to have tried it, but I don&#39;t know as though I would go back. I believe they have music some nights, which may be a good time to go (although it gets quite busy)"

I wasn&#39;t expecting much when I walked into a near-empty cafe that looked like it only consisted of a fridge and a counter upon entry.  It was delightful to be whisked away to the actual seating area and be handed a simple (but varied) paper menu for lunch.  

Though the prices seemed a little high at first, the portions and quality of the entrees was satisfying.  I only made it halfway through my chicken panini ($10) before electing to take the rest home.  A decent wine list also accompanies the food menu, which offers plenty of affordable fares.

The place seemed to start filling up (without being too crowded) after about noontime.  Service was relaxed without being annoying, but I would expect to spend about an hour enjoying your sit-down meal."

The best I&#39;ve had in Seattle so far.  I tried the Black Garlic Ramen and my friend tried the Spicy Miso Ramen (comes in mild, hot, or super hot-- which apparently may burn a lot according to the menu!! (Yikes!)).  Both were AMAZING; though I liked the Black Garlic better! .  

First, it smelled soo good, could barely wait to take the pics haha.  And the flavor of the soup definitely lived up  to the smell!  Not to mention the soup was hot, which I like :)  The noodles are perfectly cooked, not too soft with a good bite. The pork belly was soo tasty too!  It was a little fatty, but I personally prefer that to overly dry meat. 

You have to come here!!"

We were initially thinking pho then it dawned on me that I haven&#39;t tried Arashi yet. It&#39;s a small little ramen shop on 20th just off of Market St in Ballard and it wasn&#39;t tough to find. 

Got there on the early side of dinner time so we were able to sit quickly. After perusing the menu for a few minutes and using my peripherals to see what others at neighboring tables were eating, we decided to start off with the Honey Garlic Kaarage. Nicely breaded &amp; fried up, chicken thigh meat was tasty and this was actually quite good. A little sticky to make you lick your fingers and consider wiping your hands on the inner thigh of your jeans.  

As for the ramen, we got the Spicy Tantan Men and the regular Tantan Men, our ramen orders were totally coincidental. You can probably figure it out by now, It&#39;s basically the same ramen bowl but one is spicy. Good amount of seasoned ground pork for you to scoop up with your spoon. The ramen noodles were pretty good, we definitely slurpp&#39;d it up and got plenty in our bowl.  The broth was just ok for me, the sesame paste broth was quite thick &amp; creamy and was just a little too rich for me and my mouth. Possibly user ordering error on my part, but I left a lot of the broth in my bowl and just ate the noodles and such.  

Service was fine, they were nice, quick and attentive. Portions were fine and pricing is what is to be expected.  As mentioned, it&#39;s a small place, so they fill up fast.  

Overall, glad there is a ramen spot in Ballard and a good option if hankering for a ramen bowl vs a pho bowl. Glad to have finally tried Arashi, glad it was ok and will probably be back to try more items."

After I had ramen here I was in search for other ramen places in a different state and sadly I have yet to find another ramen place that compares to this one. It&#39;s soooo amazing that I dream of the day I return to Seattle, just to have this ramen again. 

I ordered the miso ramen which comes with corn, an egg, ramen noodles, pork.. etc
I personally did not want the pieces of pork but instead ground pork. They were able to replace it for me and still give me the pieces of pork on the side if I wanted it, but not inside the ramen. They do charge an extra $3 to replace it with ground pork. I got the hot level of spicy and I would say it was a 3 out 5 on a spicy level scale. I like spicy and I feel like I could have attempted the next level up for an even bigger kick."

While I missed the heat of the spicy miso tonkotsu (which I ordered previously) the shoyu broth was actually a step above in flavor. Not too salty, on the lighter side, overall good flavor. Unfortunately, this time around the toppings took a hit. The chashu which I very much enjoyed previously was much fattier. Over 50% was just fat. While the lean areas mixed with just a bit of fat had great texture, it was a disappointment overall. There are ramen joints around with better balanced and more flavorful chashu. The egg was also strange this time - tasted like it took a quick bath in rubbing alcohol. No salty/sweet flavor for balance. Maybe mine was just off.

While I enjoyed the broth more this time around, the other toppings were less than stellar, so Arashi is still a 3 from me.

Due to some other personal preferences which I didn&#39;t factor in my review (wish they had a vegetarian ramen, wish they used bamboo or anything other than bean sprouts as a topping), I probably won&#39;t be back. However, it is an OK option if you are in Ballard or just like trying new places. It is not entirely up my alley, but it may be up yours."

Having spent most of my time in the USA in southern parts, I despaired of ever finding a Japanese eatery, in America, which produces authentic food. Arashi Ramen does just that and I only wish it could be transported to a place closer to home base.

I cannot genuinely compare this restaurant to the others which I have awarded five stars; for this is not classy, high end, spacious or, indeed, a five-star sort of place. But I give it five stars for being a real, fair dinkum Japanese restaurant of the style you would see on most city streets in suburban Japan.

In short, I award five stars for the people who appreciate and enjoy good Japanese tucker, and who know how hard it is to find in this part of the world.
How is the food? Totemo oishii desu!"

I understand that most people won&#39;t eat soup on a hot 80 degree day, but I still like my ramen to be above lukewarm. We ended up eating our dish because we had just come back from a hike. Ordered the spicy miso at hot spice, and it was not what I was expecting. 

Corn is added, a definite plus. Noodles were chewy and had a great texture, which is why I still give them a 2.5. The soup was lacking something that I&#39;m usually anticipating from ramen houses: more umami. And I didn&#39;t enjoy the presentation or taste of my pork in the ramen. Full slab of Pork belly is the best, and this dish used shredded pork. It was disappointing for me. 

The restaurant is small, so be patient, please. Service was spectacular. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was the cooks smoking so close to their cooking areas outside. What happened to 25 feet? Gross."

An egg should be flavored and have a runny yolk that when broken, compliments the broth and noodles making a perfect bite. That is not the egg you will get. The yolk will be solid. It will break into crumbles and litter your soup with dry, yellow bits. It will make you sorry you tried to eat it. 

We tried both the thin and thick noodles. I prefer the thick noodles - it&#39;s a matter of preference. I enjoyed the broth of the shoyu ramen and it filled me up quite well. The spicy broths actually had a bit of heat to it. Most of the time when you ask for &#34;spicy&#34; you just get &#34;less bland&#34; but this was okay. You can get a decent combo of ramen, a small appetizer, and a salad. The kid&#39;s plates are adorable - little sectioned cafeteria trays! 

If you have a choice between the chicken karaage and honey garlic karaage, pick the latter. It&#39;s much tastier. 

Like other ramen shops, sign in as soon as you get there with everyone in your party. It&#39;s close quarters. The coolest thing I saw were these baskets at your table where you can put purses and other stuff in while you eat. Everyone should have those!"

Love the feel of this place, similar to a traditional ramen shop in Japan. Service was prompt and friendly. We tried the honey garlic karaage, black garlic ramen and the miso ramen. The karaage had great flavor and was juicy but I would have preferred it to be a bit crispier. The miso ramen was delicious! The pork was succulent and tender and the broth was rich, everything I could hope for. The egg could have been a bit runnier/gooeyer but was seasoned well. The black garlic ramen was also a good option, served with thin noodles. The broth was much lighter than the miso and had a mellow garlic taste. Prices were reasonable, appetizers ranged from $5-$8 and the ramen options from $10-$12. They did offer a decent selection of sake and beer options which I did not have a chance to try. 

Tip: Not good for groups, seating is limited."

I think those are one of the stand-out points of this place, in that there are a lot of spicy options (not just tan-tan!) and you get the option of adding spicy to any soup base!  There are three levels to choose from and I feel that they were pretty dang accurate at giving you the punch you request.  I went with mild because I&#39;m a wimp, and I was reasonably sniffling.  Broth was hearty and very filling.  Another aspect about this place is that they offer both thin and thick noodle options.  The egg is cooked a nice medium but unfortunately 1 serving only has half an egg.  The place is small so probably better for groups of 2-4max.  

I will come back when I have that craving for spicy ramen.  They have a lot of rice bowl offerings too."

I got the spicy miso tonkatsu with chashu and it was delicious. The broth was very rich and creamy and the thick noodles had a good bite to them. The egg had good flavor but the yolk was overcooked and solid. You can order the spicy ramen mild, hot, or very hot and the hot is quite spicy. I was surprised by the amount of heat but enjoyed it.

Service was quick and friendly.

The broth was rich and fatty, the large slice of pork belly was melt in your mouth, and there was a fair amount of bean sprouts and noodles as well. For $9.50 the portions here are quite generous.

They do have combo options (ie: bowl of ramen plus a side such as takoyaki, kaarage, etc) but I wouldn&#39;t order these since they&#39;re half the portion for only $1 less than the full portion.

My friend and I also got a takoyaki to share which was also really tasty as well. They make these fresh to order and you can tell by the crunchy outside texture and the soft custard like center. The octopus in the middle was quite easy to chew and wasn&#39;t that rubbery overcooked texture.

Two ramen bowls and a takoyaki came out to be about $30 after tax which was quite reasonable. I look forward to coming back and trying their other dishes."

The person seated to my left was amusing discussing spice and having his vision affected by his longer hair back in middle/high school. Whatever, it was just nice to be among humanity.

I&#39;ve been to both the Ballard and Southcenter locations now and enjoy visiting either place! So far, I think this Ballard location is less busy -- perhaps because this restaurant just opened its doors recently.

I personally love the shoyu ramen. By now I think I&#39;ve figured out a winning combo for me -- along with all the standard toppings, I also add corn and fried onion for an added cost. I ask them to hold off on the green onions. The broth is always on point (not too salty yet still very flavorful) and the seasoned egg is amazing!

Small place. Bar seats are a bit uncomfortable and awkward to sit on. Japanese pop music playing on background. Bowls are basically cone shaped so it appears as if you get a lot--may leave a few of you hungrily disappointed.

Side salad: spring mix with a very tasty sesame dressing.

Honey Kaarage: nice sweet tangy flavor and crunch. However, some parts of the chicken were a bit stringy/chewy.

Shio ramen: really heavy on the noodles and broth a bit blander than most places. Red ginger was a nice touch and they really loaded up on the green onions. I wish they had a bit more options as far as veggies go. Egg was tasty because it was slightly salted and just the right texture. Pork Chashu was melt in your mouth consistency but it was pretty heavy on the fatty side. Not much meat, which is what I personally prefer."

Not to compare too much, Kukai has been my go to for a very long time and it has a special place in my heart. But my friend and I decided to take a chance and give something new a try. 

We came on a Saturday afternoon and was first off relieved that the line wasn&#39;t too intimidating. We waited probably around 10 min or so and got seated. I was so excited to see the amount of options they had when it came to ramen bowls. They had a variety of options where it seemed like every one was packed w/ a different flavor. I chose the spicy miso tonkotsu and my friend ordered the black garlic ramen. Typically from our experience, salt based broths have always been very one not and a little bland but he decided to take the risk because it seemed to be loaded w/ toppings. 

For the spicy miso tonkotsu - I LOVED it. It was so packed w/ different flavors that all meshed so well together. It was the perfect amount of spice, sweet and saltiness without one overpowering the other. It had corn, a half boiled egg cooked PERFECTLY and bits of pork that seemed to be slow cooked because it melted in your mouth and complimented the noodles so well. The noodles were cooked just right, not too hard, not too soft and the broth was well flavored to where it didn&#39;t taste like packets of salt were dumped straight in. 

Black garlic ramen - OBSESSED as well. The noodles were a little thinner and the broth is why it&#39;s called black garlic because it was a sea salt based black broth which I felt like went really well w/ the thin noodles. It was topped with a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg, pork belly slices that literally melted in your mouth, green onions and bean sprouts. 

Needless to say, we&#39;ll be back. The servers are so sweet, hospitable and very welcoming and I think it&#39;s safe to say we might have just found out new go-to."

This location is really close to my boyfriend&#39;s place, so I was super excited about the prospect of ramen within such a short distance!

In a very fortuitous bit of timing, I was visiting Seattle for spring break and arrived on the first day of Arashi&#39;s soft opening. The space is pretty small, but homey and comfortable. Service is also great - the hostess and our waiter were both super nice and helpful.

The menu offers 5-6 appetizers (think karaage, gyoza, takoyaki) as well as 8 or so ramen options. We tried the karaage, gyoza, miso tonkotsu ramen, and spicy tantanmen.

The appetizers were delicious - karaage was crispy, flavorful, and piping hot, and the gyoza had a nice pan-fried char on the bottom and came with a nice dipping sauce. The ramen itself I would probably rate a 3 or 3.5 out of 5 - I had the miso tonkotsu, and while I liked the thicker noodles, they lacked some springiness, and the broth didn&#39;t have the same depth of flavor that I&#39;ve had at other ramen shops.

That being said, I have high standards for ramen in theory but in practice it really doesn&#39;t take much for me to enjoy a bowl of noodles. I&#39;ll definitely be back - the food is great and it&#39;s so easy to get to."

My personal favorite is the R4- spicy miso tonkotsu. Really like the extra toppings and the option to make this less or more spicy. J-pop is also a great drink.  
My only little bug is that the door doesn&#39;t completely close so it can get chilly when people walk in and out. Easily fixable though I am sure."

The people were really too sweet here. The food, however, nearly broke my heart. :( The tantan men tasted like peanut butter soup and the miso tonkotsu tasted a little too much like instant miso. I hate to say this, but I think I&#39;ve had more satisfying bowls of ramen coming from an instant pack than from here.

Overall, this is a cute addition to the neighborhood, but it&#39;s not a place you would take your Japanese foodie friends to."

The tl;dr verdict: not the best quality ramen in the Seattle area (I&#39;d vote for Santouka, or maybe certain special ramens at Jinya) - but pretty good, and more than worth the price of admission.

Interior: The inside of the restaurant is pretty small - I&#39;d estimate it seats around 30 people. Clean, casual, with minimal decor.

Service: I came by myself, and was seated within a few minutes of arriving. The waiter was prompt and polite without hovering - this was consistent throughout my visit. I ordered the Arashi ramen (thin noodles in a shio tonkotsu-based broth) - it came within five minutes of me ordering. Nice.

Taste: The broth was a little bland for my taste, but still pretty good. I&#39;d say that Santouka, in Bellevue, has a better shio - but it&#39;s not better by a huge amount. The broth also had a really good consistency - it was slightly thick and clung to my palate, which I liked a lot. The pork belly slices were pretty big, and were probably among the best I&#39;ve had in Seattle. Really soft, melt-in your mouth, and flavored very well. The thin noodles were cooked perfectly - no complaints at all. The egg was nothing special, but eggs are delicious so who cares. 

Value: The portion of noodles was huge! I&#39;d say around 50% bigger than I was expecting. The portion of pork belly was also very generous. Overall - portion sizes are more than good enough for a hungry person, and well worth the price.

Overall: I liked Arashi ramen! I think there&#39;s better places for overall taste, but the taste here is still quite good - and the price to value ratio is good as well. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try their other ramen variants."

Good-sized portions at a good price... I imagine this place will get pretty popular soon. It&#39;s not a big space so probably not ideal for groups, but they do serve Asahi and Kirin in bottles and have some sake options available as well for a cute/casual date night.  

Went yesterday for an early Sunday dinner and got takoyaki and 2 bowls of ramen.
The TAKOYAKI came with 6 pieces and a generous amount of octopus.  It was cooked well but I thought the okonomi sauce was a bit too salty and made the dish a little soggier than it should be.  I&#39;ll probably try the karage next time as an app. 
The ramen noodles in both bowls were perfect.  They tasted fresh and had a chewy bite to them.  The SPICY TANTAN MEN broth was sesame based and even had a touch of sweetness to it that I thought was interesting.  We chose the &#34;hot&#34; spice level which I personally thought was pretty mild but I&#39;m used to the numbingly hot SE Asian spicy so I&#39;d say the &#34;hot&#34; is a safe bet for most.  The MISO RAMEN was the highlight and star of the meal.  The broth was rich and tasty without being overly salty and the pork belly chashu was really good and tender as well.  Only thing that could&#39;ve been improved was the &#34;sweet&#34; corn that tasted bland and didn&#39;t add much flavor.  Overall though, it was a delicious bowl of ramen and I will be back to try the others."

Also, the folks at Arashi aren&#39;t messing around when they say &#34;spicy&#34; so choose your level cautiously. We ordered mild and the heat level was just about the most we could tolerate without it affecting the experience. 

We also sampled the kaarage, honey garlic kaarage and takoyaki. The coating on the kaarage was average, but I did like the honey garlic sauce. The takoyaki was pretty good too."

I have been to their south center location multiple times, so I was excited to see they were opening a new location so close to home. I ordered the takoyaki and the Arashi ramen. The Arashi ramen has a salt based broth with bamboo, egg, three pieces of pork, green onions, and seaweed. The meat was absolutely delicious; very fatty and flavorful. I would have preferred a tonkatsu base with the ramen instead of the salt, but the meat and the broth flavors balanced out when eaten together. The takoyaki was also delicious. The middle was very soft while the outside was crunchy; achieving a good balance. Service was really great and I hope it continues after they have their grand opening.

RAMEN: The ramen noodles were cooked really well. They were the perfect balance of firmness and softness. Chew-able, but not too chewy. Soft because of the soup, but not squishy. Low-sodium seems to be more flavorful! A friend and I both got the garlic ramen; one less sodium, one regular. The pork is a different type of cut I suppose as most ramen places give you fatty pork belly. This pork was not typical. I personally prefer the slabs of pork belly. :3
**Everything about the ramen was good! Except for the egg. For some reason both my friend and I felt very close to throwing up after eating the egg. It could have been the consistency of the yolk or the way they flavored the egg, but it just didn&#39;t sit right with us.

KARAAGE: The karaage was crispy and flavorful and came with some mayonnaise dipping sauce. May have enjoyed it more had it not been for that egg in the ramen :( They gave big pieces of chicken, more like giant chicken nuggets. Not especially the best karaage I&#39;ve had, but still good.

DRINKS: Ordered the alcoholic Hello Kitty drink as recommended by our server. It was good! A dangerous drink. Tastes like strawberry calpico and barely any alcohol. A dangerous drink that could make your night interesting. Do drink slowly :) Enjoy the gummies!"

I will admit I am a new ramen eater and don&#39;t have too much knowledge about the food itself but I highly enjoyed my Ramen during this visit. Gem explained to us that Kizuki cooks the broth for over 12 hours to bring out the marrow from the bones and increase its richness. He also took the time to explain the difference between many of their menu offerings. I chose the spicy ramen (level 1 spice-I&#39;m a wimp) and loved the savory broth paired with the mild spice. I also added an egg (cooked perfectly with that rich par-cooked yoke). 

The bowl was massive and I had enough to take home for lunch the next day. Even reheated, the meal was delicious (Kizuki gave me two take home containers--one for the broth and one for the noodles to keep them from getting soggy.)

I look foward to another visit to try more items on their menu."

Write your name down, be open to sitting anywhere and hope for the best!

After waiting about 30 minutes we were seated at the bar. Service was friendly, bringing the sake flight to taste quickly. It was explained to us and was a nice selection of their menu, which is available to customise to your choosing.

Our ramen came soon after, a spicy tonkatsu and garlic shoyu tonkatsu. Both had loads of flavour but I preferred the garlic for it&#39;s richer consistency. The toppings were ample, including bean sprouts, seaweed, pork belly and egg. 

Side note: There was literally one person shelling eggs all night. Dedication!

It was a busy night but service was good and food was served quickly. The meal was excellent and I can see why they have multiple locations. I still prefer the Bellevue atmosphere but it was a great meal on a cold night."

Noodles are al dente. Soft-boiled egg is cooked with a gooey middle, exactly the way it should be (costs extra but must-have); slightly chilled which provides a nice contrast to the hot soup.

Chashu has nice flavor but they only give you 1 to 2 small slices. 

The wait at this restaurant is usually about 30-40 minutes at dinner time. I suggest coming a little bit later or at an off hour. The decor is bright and Japanese; the noodle-making station is in an open kitchen type of setting; there are bar, booth, and table seatings. 

The service here is mostly attentive and friendly. However, I was there one time where two waiters were arguing loudly in the dining area the entire time I dined there, which made me feel uncomfortable and lessened my otherwise positive experience. 

1. Spicy Ramen (with soft-boiled egg) (low sodium option) - flavorful broth with a kick, thin al dente noodles, chasu slices are flavorful but thinly sliced, garlic flakes makes the broth even richer, bites of seaweed/veggies/bamboo shoots add texture and contrast, slightly chilled egg is the best thing of all (I like taking a bite of the egg then dipping my noodles in the yolk).

2. Gyoza - decent flavor which builds up as you eat more and more, pan-fried so there is a crispy and chewy texture

3. Dipping Noodle with Tonkotsu Broth - wider, thicker noodles (can choose hot or cold option; I chose hot but it ended up making the noodles stick together in a blob and made it difficult to break them apart for dipping), tonkotsu broth is flavorful and plentiful, same ingredients as regular ramen

4. Chicken Karaage - delicious, crispy fried chicken with a side of spicy mayo; this is delicious but very hot so be careful."

Such is life when all you&#39;ve had is really, REALLY good ramen in SoCal and NorCal. So I was a bit hesitant when my friends chose this particular ramen spot as the Friday night dinner option because I wasn&#39;t seeing a plethora of great options (surprisingly so) when doing some initial research into the Seattle ramen scene. Well, my fears were allayed after diving into Kizuki&#39;s garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen.

I look for three things when rating a bowl of ramen: (1) broth, (2) noodles, and (3) pork. Broth had solid flavor without being too overdosed with sodium. Noodles were my preferred hard noodles and retained the broth flavor well. I also added fatty pork chashu to the my bowl, which was a clutch decision as it was easily some of the best pork I&#39;ve had in any bowl of ramen. This bowl was so good that it jumped my favorite NorCal ramen spot in my ramen rankings.

Wait was long as hell on Friday night, but at least they&#39;re open until 1 AM on Fridays and Saturdays so you don&#39;t feel super rushed to get in the door before they close. Service was quick and attentive, our orders were brought out pretty quickly after we made them.

Good to know that if I ever decide I want some great ramen in Seattle that there is at least one competent place I can go to. Definitely coming back."

Especially in terms of consistency (I&#39;ve been going here since college). In fact, it may beat out some of the ramen places in SoCal and the Bay Area... it&#39;s that comparable. Heck, with the cold Seattle weather it might make hot ramen taste better. The pork slices and boiled egg are perfectly cooked. The noodles are firm... but the winner here is the broth. There isn&#39;t that unsettling cloudiness - the broth is very smooth - and it&#39;s rich and really satisfying.

My favorite bowl is the tonkatsu garlic - such impact in the garlic and rich pork broth. It&#39;s super addicting and easy to finish. The tonkatsu garlic ramen is so garlicky that they provide mouth wash in the bathroom... it&#39;s that strong. Still, it&#39;s incredible delicious and perfect on a rainy day.

Second favorite is the yuzu shio ramen. If you&#39;re looking for something light but tasty, I highly recommend this. It has a light citrus flavor that goes really well with the shio broth. It&#39;s a very complex flavor for ramen and not something I see at most ramen places around the U.S. Tonkatsu and garlic tonkatsu are a dime a dozen, but this ramen is pretty unique and amazing.

Last time I was here we got the chicken wings... come here for the ramen. Chicken wings are OK, but not satisfying. They had an interesting salty citrus flavor, but the wings are tiny and have little meat on them. Same goes for the pork buns - these aren&#39;t any different from pork buns at other places.

The only negative thing about this place is the wait. XD We tried coming here every day during PAX for dinner and the wait was an hour long - it wasn&#39;t until we came during lunch (before noon) did we manage to eat here. Even when there isn&#39;t a convention in Seattle, this place is super busy!"

The pork broth based broth here is solid, and cleaned well so that it has a neat but milky appearance.  Had it as a spicy miso, which was also done well.  As for the noodles - cooked al dente. 

The appetizers were good, but nothing extraordinary.  Still good though.

My final straw was my most recent visit. We were seated at the bar so we got to see how everyone behind the line was just standing around.

I didn&#39;t even bother to bring it up with the server until the end when I asked for the item I didn&#39;t receive to be taken off my bill.

I had the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen - because it&#39;s the most popular. It was a bit too garlicky for me since I like regular traditional ramen taste but still good. My mom got the Veggie ramen and hated it - I tasted it too and the chili powder was overwhelming. They offered something else so she tried the Miso ramen. Definitely good - but would want to try a different flavor next time.

i normally don&#39;t like pork or pork belly to eat, but it was ok. It was just a little fatty for my liking, but you can upgrade to another pork and MIGHT try that next time, the waitress recommended it, but i wanted just some tasty wavy noodle ramen with some tasty delicious sauce.

Came in on a Saturday right at noon and was able to be seated right away.  Already on a good roll compared to SF shops. I ordered the garlic tonkatsu ramen and order came out in roughly 5 min.

Ramen broth was tasty and a bit thicker with visible pieces of garlic, green onion, pepper which I prefer. Noodles were traditional and tasted fresh with just the right amount of chew.  My only beef with the ramen was the chasu which I felt to be a bit tough as well as the saltiness of the broth.

The food is AMAZING! I have never had Karaage (deep-fried chicken)-Don in Seattle before, but one day, my friend recommended Kizuki. After trying Karaage-Don, I became addicted to it. I know it is strange because I do not usually eat ramen at a ramen restaurant. The Karaage-Don is the signature dish at Kizuki. It consists of golden brown deep-fried chicken placed on top of vegetables. These vegetables are lettuce and baby red tomatoes with Japanese creamy sesame dressing. At the bottom of some vegetables is glutinous rice in a bowl. The bowl shape is really unique. It is white color and the rim of the bowl is slanted. I have never seen a bowl like this in Japan.

You realize immediately that aromatic smells of Karaage-Don when the waiter brings me the dish. I think that the dish is cooked to order because when it was served, it was still steaming. In some other restaurants, when they give us food, it is already cooked. However, Kizuki is different. The food is still hot when I ate it. Juice from the meat comes out from the chicken when you bite it, and it is absolutely juicy. The longer you chew it, the more flavorsome it becomes. It is so awesome! Moreover, I didn&#39;t know what seasoning they used. I thought they use made seasoning with garlic and ginger. The deep-fried chicken is delectable with roasted sesame cream dressing. You can order Karaage as a side menu, but it is without the dressing. 

I recommend going there before 7pm when you go to eat dinner because this is a really popular restaurant. If you go to there around 7pm, sometimes you have to wait around 20 minute（I usually wait around 20 minute）Therefore, I think that is why some people rate Kizuki（Kukai）- Ramen and Izakaya&#39;s low.  I think it is worth to waiting one dish even though there are so many people. Maybe you will be addicted to Karaage-Don like me!"

Wanted to try a variety of bowls before making a judgement since they seem to be the dominant chain in Seattle for ramen. Overall, I find it OK but not as excellent as I hoped. 

My visits span from about a year ago (first ramen place I tried when I moved to Seattle!) til today and I&#39;ve tried a different ramen each time. My experiences have varied but I haven&#39;t been extremely impressed with any of them. The pork is not to my liking (both the regular and the fatty/pork belly chashu), the noodles are inconsistently cooked (I don&#39;t recall if you can specify firmness, but I definitely would if I came back), and the broths are really hit or miss for me (some do hit the mark). 

Spicy ramen - Decent broth. Definite presence of garlic, but not as much as the garlic tonkotsu shoyu. The mild spicy level is below a typical medium (still has some heat, just not much). The &#34;regular&#34; pork that comes with this ramen is very disappointing. Extremely chewy. Awkwardly gnawed at it. The noodles were also overcooked this visit. 

Tonkotsu shio rich ramen - I thought this was going to be the one. Looks super up my alley. Comes with an egg by default and their special fatty chashu. The broth was surprisingly tasty (best I&#39;ve had at Kizuki) and I sipped a ton of it despite being cramped at the bar seating with no AC (hot day - maybe not my best choice for lunch). The pork unfortunately was not to my liking. I love me some fatty chashu but this was just way too much. More fat than meat.

Garlic tonkotsu shoyu - This was the first ramen I tried here and was my least favorite. The garlic flavor overwhelmed all other flavors for me. I do like garlic (why I ordered it) but I guess just not this much. Others seem to love it. Personal preference. 

Vegetarian ramen - Extremely disappointing. Broth is extremely bland. If you are dragged here, at least you will have an option. If you have a choice, check out nearly any other ramen place for a much better experience (Yoroshiku and Aloha Ramen have great veg options, Santouka has 1 good option as well)."

This, however, is about an order I got delivered via Uber Eats....

I got the chicken wings and the spicy ramen. The chicken wings were downright amazing. They managed to stay crispy and the lemony garlic glaze was just so different and fresh. The chicken was juicy and I think this ranks amongst my more favorite chicken wings. 
Then the ramen. The broth was a very flavorful pork broth. I decided to up the spice level to hot and that made it even better. I got some chicken chashu and a soft boiled egg with the usual toppings. The  egg yolk gives this nice density to the broth which I think helps the broth bind with the noodle better. Definitely something to consider before slurping away. 

I really need to dine in at Kizuki Ramen and Izakaya soon. Until then, this will be one of my top bets for a really reliable takeout option. This place deserves a solid 4 stars."

One negative, the restaurant was very, VERY noisy but well lit and the wait staff was friendly and accommodating.

Right at the top, I gotta say this place is a favorite not for the ramen (which was great), but for many other things. 

We started off with the Karaage Don which shocked my world of Karaage. It&#39;s typical of most ramen joints to have their version of the Japanese-style fried chicken accompanied with only a few leaves of lettuce and maybe a slice of lemon.  However, Kizuki took it to another level. Doused with a light creamy dressing sauce, the crispy chicken rested on a forest of lettuce greenery and baby tomatoes, and further beneath was the best fluffy sticky white rice. Essentially, this was a rice bowl with a fried chicken salad. Delish!

I can go on and on about the Shoyu Ramen I ordered, but it wasnt overly impressive. Delicious, but it wasn&#39;t the star dish here.

Being from the east coast, I&#39;m extremely saddened by the fact that there&#39;s not a location over here -- open one up, please!! I came here for lunch on a Friday; it&#39;s in a quiet area, more on the edge of Capitol Hill rather than actually being in it. The door is a bit confusing because it says &#34;Kukai&#34; on it, but it really is Kizuki. I believe &#34;Kukai&#34; is the name it goes by in Japan? I may be wrong about that. 

Otherwise, THE RAMEN HERE IS DELICIOUS. I&#39;ve had ramen from many many places on the east coast, but this is by far the best I&#39;ve ever had in my entire life. They have takoyaki (six pieces for $5) which is a STEAL, because it&#39;s cheap (!) and wonderfully crisp on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. I wish they put more sauce and less bonito flakes on it, but it was still easily the best I&#39;ve ever had. 

The ramen... just thinking about it now makes me want it again, even though I had it twice within a span of three days. I ordered the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen (their special!) with extra egg. I found it amazing that they already give you an entire egg by default, but then they also added an entire extra egg since I asked for another one, too. Usually at the other places I go to, I only get half an egg, which is why I ordered an extra. Already a plus in my book, because one of the best parts of the ramen is the egg in my opinion. The meat was a bit tough, but you can substitute it (for $0.50 extra, which I highly recommend you do) for the fattier and more tender pork belly. The broth was AMAZING. It comes in two options, traditional and low-sodium (for my health-conscious friends), and only costs $12!!! The only drawback (though I didn&#39;t experience this myself) is that it seems that they only make a limited quantity of this broth each day, so get it while it lasts! 

I knocked down a star because of the very slow service :( despite coming in at around 2, we waited a very long time for our ramen (30 mins+) even though it wasn&#39;t that busy. We saw other people come in, eat, and leave before us. Although slow, I would still come back because... ramen. Duh."

Everything tasted awesome- a criticism would be flavoring of the broth, however, as the items inside it were great but the broth of my ramen as well as my family&#39;s were somewhat bland. Customer service was fine, a little awkward when forced American accents are speaking Japanese greetings. Wait time was a huge minus, though we lucked out and got a table 40 mins ahead of the hour long projected wait time. Overall a great experience with somewhat traditional tasting ramen and friendly staff! Great for family time."

Service: 3
Wait: 1 hour for a group of 2 on a Sunday at 6:30pm.
TL;DR: Overhyped, not worth the wait, but I would go again if there was no wait. (Doordash?)

After waiting an hour, my friend and I were very eager to get some garlic tonkatsu ramen in our bellies. But sadly...
1) They had ran out of the garlic tonkatsu ramen. So we ordered the tonkatsu and the yuzu with wavy noodles.
2) My friend&#39;s yuzu order came as a different order. We asked for the right order.
3) When they gave her the &#39;right&#39; order, it came with thin noodles rather than wavy. An outrage!! The noodles are 70% of the dish so my friend told the waitress that they got the order wrong. The waitress didn&#39;t apologize, she just paused then said, &#34;well, it&#39;ll be another 20 mins if you want us to remake it.&#34; Of course after already waiting 1.5 hours (yeah 30 min wait for the food), we weren&#39;t about to wait another 20. I traded with her some of my wavy noodles and there is a huge difference between the two! Thin was overboiled and not chewy... Really ruined the meal she expected/should have gotten.
On the bright side, they were generous with the 3 thick-cut chashu pieces.. but.. these were overcooked and tough to chew. :( 

Besides the noodles, we also ordered agedashi tofu, which was nicely fried, topped with a plentiful amount of bonito flakes and dipped in sauce. But, it came with only 4 measly pieces. For that reason, wouldn&#39;t order again."

The signage has not yet been updated so it might be confusing when you arrive. Just check Google maps for the location and address.

My most recent visit was on a Thursday evening. A friend from out of town was visiting and she was staying in Capital Hill. We arrived at 7pm and were seated within 10 minutes and had a choice between a table and a bar. We ended up sitting at the bar and service was excellent. There is a waiting list available when you arrive. The hosts also ask if your entire party has arrived.

The ramen choices are the same as you&#39;d find at other Kizuki locations - shio, tonkatsu, tsukemen, etc. Regular and low sodium broth choices. And add-ons like soft egg, extra noodles, etc. We also ordered an adegashi tofu and edamame as appetizers. The tofu was good! Soft and flavorful.

After dinner, we enjoyed dessert at Molly Moons. ;)"

This was the best food stop for me during a 3 day business trip to Seattle. I ordered the garlic tonkatsu ramen and added spinach and corn. I LOVED the fact they offer a low sodium vs regular option. One of my issues with ramen a lot is how heavy and salty it would be. By picking the low sodium option, I basically got the best of both worlds - full rich flavors without the normal heaviness.

The corn was a bit over cooked so I wouldn&#39;t order that as a side again. Everything else was perfect! The egg was gooey inside, noodles were chewy, meat was grilled and smoked with good flavor, and the bamboo shoots were delicious too. 

Service was SUPER friendly and attentive. I came around 5:45 pm so they weren&#39;t packed yet and walk in was easy. I would definitely want to come back on the future!"

The broth and noodles are so fresh, you can tell this place does shit right! Service was a bit backed up due to high volume, but that&#39;s to be expected on Cap Hill. Takoyaki wasn&#39;t great, but the calamari is good and so is the soup."

My friend and I started with the Takoyaki. Full disclosure, I&#39;ve never had these balls before but I thought they were awesome. They were piping hot and had a great sauce on top.

Now for the popular garlic tonkotsu ramen:

What I loved - The noodles, the veggies and the perfectly done egg!

What I thought was only okay - The broth and the pork. I like my pork to literally melt in my mouth and this was surprisingly dry and not fatty at all. The broth was okay - not sure why I didn&#39;t love it but I can tell you that I tried the miso broth that my friend got and it was much more flavorful. But probably the most disappointing part was that there wasn&#39;t really a strong garlic taste. There are ramen places that I&#39;ve been to that actually serve fresh garlic on top but this ramen did not have that despite having garlic in the name. I probably could have asked for it but even without fresh garlic there wasn&#39;t much of a garlic flavor.

As I&#39;m writing this out I&#39;m thinking that 3.5 stars is probably a better rating but I&#39;ll go with 4 since there was little to no wait and the food came out very quickly. If I were anywhere but Seattle I would probably come back but with so many amazing food options here I&#39;ll probably just end up trying somewhere else."

There were a ton of wait staff and cooks when we arrived on a typical weekday evening, but we had to call a waitress over after being ignored for 10 minutes with closed menus. Bad start inductive of the food to follow.

We ordered and waited 5 minutes for the comically tiny portion of fried squid to arrive - total ripoff, don&#39;t order it unless you like being robbed... Like property owners in the city of Seattle. I digress. My rage lead to me taking a blurry picture. It takes another 15 minutes after finishing our few pieces of squid before the tsukemens to arrive. Geebus, it&#39;s &#34;quick service &#34; ramen... It doesn&#39;t take that long to prepare.

The noodle portion was disappointing and the broth was weak. They tried to augment it with vinegar and other seasonings to hide the lack of depth. Locally, I&#39;d rather have tsukemen at Santouka. 

In summary, crappy service and overpriced, mediocre food. Hey at least I found a free parking spot!"

We started off with the Takoyaki which was really good. The bonito flakes were a tad bit overpowering but overall the dish was really good and I&#39;d definitely recommend it. 
The veggie gyozas on the other hand were absolutely terrible. Probably the worst I&#39;ve ever had. They had no flavor whatsoever and were unbearably greasy. Instead of crisp pan seared dumplings, we had a soggy disgusting mess on the plate that we did not finish. That one dish literally ruined our meal.

I got the traditional Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. It was absolutely spectacular. One of the nicest ramen broths I&#39;ve had, very rich, full of flavor with perfectly cooked noodles, a huge slice of pork and a beautifully marinated soft boiled egg along with other toppings. Ask for some spicy sauce on the side and add it and a little of the dry spice to take to the next level if you like spicy food. This is definitely my new favorite ramen in Seattle and i can&#39;t wait to go back.

My wife got the veggie ramen. It was not too bad and had a lot of veggies and nicely cooked noodles. The broth however was very bland and flavorless. I personally like the veggie broth at Samurai a lot more. They really should add some miso and figure out a way to make it more flavorful.

Overall the star dishes of the meal were absolutely spectacular but the others failed to impress. I would love to go back here but only stick to what we know is good.

I met SO here for lunch during one of the many rainy stretches where ramen is practically a must. They were really nice and got me tea at the bar since they have a policy where they won&#39;t seat you until your party has all arrived. They were busy, but not too busy to snag me a table about 10 before my guest arrived, so they obviously will work with you despite that. 

The booths are beautiful and have high backs to ensure privacy, but there are only four of them, tops. It is also super strange to have the server island right in the middle of the room-- a true deserted island, but we think it has to do with structural beams that would make putting more seating there awkward. 

We ordered the steamed pork bun, veggie tempura to start and two bowls of ramen. Mine was the spicy ramen and I&#39;ve forgotten which he chose, but they were both so tasty. You can ask for your egg to be hard boiled! I went with this option since all yolk is questionable but runny yolk is the worst. 

The bun and tempura were delicious and perfect size to split between two people. 

Great lunch and take-away option!"

During the holiday season work can be a bit quiet. Which, in some ways, is great because I can trek out farther and take a tad longer lunch! Better take advantage of this while it lasts...Today&#39;s choice was ramen! Well, I actually wanted tsukemen but the reviews for tsukemen at Kukai didn&#39;t convince me enough to order it. Sounded mediocre. However, the reviews for the ramen are great! And accurate!

I came here right at opening - 11:00am! There was already a small line! Woah! Luckily, I only waited a couple minutes. 

I ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen and a side of gyoza. The gyoza was excellent. Delicious pork filling, crispy perfectly cooked wrapper. 

The ramen broth was flavorful but relatively mild. I really enjoyed the garlic oil in there! To be honest, I wanted to add another slabby of pork belly for some extra saltiness but knew I was ordering a lot of food for myself already...so I thought better of it and kept it as-is. I also wish that they&#39;d ask if you&#39;d like light/medium/heavy oil and flavor. They do this at places like Shinsengumi in CA and I really appreciate the customization of it. 

The half-boiled egg was perfectly eggcellent...har har! :P That&#39;s one of my favorite parts of ramen! The egg in the broth! And Kukai knows how to do eggs!

The noodles were perfect. Chewy but still had a bite to it (&#34;al dente&#34;), soft, flavorful...yum. Unfortunately, the piece of pork I got was a bit dry. So I soaked it in the broth for a while before chomping into it. Still dry, haha, but at least it wasn&#39;t bland or anything...still tasted pleasant with the noodles + broth.

Portions were generous, service was great, food is top quality. A bit on the pricier side but I would definitely revisit!"

We were told it would take about 20-30 minutes to get a table for 3. It took over an hour. They have a paper list only and despite checking back with the host directly, at some point we were skipped over. We ended up waiting over an hour. 

The manager gave us two free appetizers to try to make up for it, but it didn&#39;t end there. We had about 5-6 different people bring us food, take our order, bring us the check, etc. The service was fast for ordering and getting food, but it took us over 10 minutes (and some hand waving) to get a waiter to come back and take our dessert order then about the same to get our check. 

It was like they tried to make up for the first mistake, then gave up halfway through.

On top of all that, the ramen was just ordinary and a bit flavorless in my opinion. The gyoza and sauce were bland. Not worth the wait for sure."

I got the chicken ramen with extra spinach, and was greeted with a familiar taste. The toppings were fresh, and the chicken was surprisingly tender. If you&#39;ve ever had wan-ton noodles in asia, you&#39;ll definitely like the chicken ramen.

When I finally had a chance to visit Seattle we came straight to the Ramen spot. We came on a Tuesday night around 6 PM and parking was very hard to fine. We spent at least 30 minutes going around the block and the surrounding street area to find street parking. There are paid parking lots, but at the time the machines were down. 

My family of eight was seated within 10 minutes. Staff was very friendly and very helpful as to describing what exactly is in each Ramen dish. We all decided on eating the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, except for my dad and my uncle, who ordered the Yuzu Shio Ramen. 

Garlic Tonkotsu: 
The broth was SO flavorful! It was just the right amount of garlic. The soft boiled egg was PERFECTION! The only thing that could&#39;ve made it better was if we picked &#34;Low Sodium&#34; it was all too salty for us. 

Yuzu Shio Ramen:
Both dad and uncle said it was perfect for them. The broth was way more clear so it&#39;s a lot healthier for them. Their noodles seemed a bit thinner too. 

All in all this place was awesome. Best place for a tasty ramen dinner in Seattle!!"

The noise level is louder then your regular sit down restaurant. I didn&#39;t like how there wasn&#39;t a host when we walked in. There is a stand with a sign in sheet. Mind you we arrived a little after 6pm on a Monday night. The wait would have been sooner but we wanted to wait for a table rather than bar seating. I have had the spicy ramen before which is super good. This time I had the miso spicy ramen with extra greens. It came with less broth then I anticipated but still very good. I ate the whole thing. Definately worth a try.

Restaurant seems to be run inefficiently. Hostess was seating and bringing waters which seemed to slow down the seating process.  4 min til server came to take order, 5 min for appetizer to arrive. 13 more min for ramen.

Takoyaki- 4* round, crunchy outside, inside fully cooked, decent amount of octopus pieces.

Shoyu ramen- 3* wasn&#39;t super delicious that I kept wanting to eat more but average.  Noodles were cooked well, had enough bite. Bamboo tasted a little funny and I didn&#39;t like the greens. Light broth, could have used more and I had to pick out the chilis.

Garlic tonkatsu - 3* The sides and rim of bowl was cover in broth and bits of food, very unappealing.  Also average flavor, not as much garlic flavor as other places."

 Try to avoid the wait in Bellevue? Come here you will still have to wait. At least, they have more seats. ;)
 
Now talk about the food: Kizuki (Kukai) never get it wrong on the Tonkotsu broth Ramen. Others? I won&#39;t dare to try cause they look really bland. But please don&#39;t miss out the good parts: Their appetizer/ side dishes. Yummy and cheap, never go wrong and authentic taste. Especially the fried or fresh tofu, chicken wings, takoyaki, potato deep fried balls. Don&#39;t try the Bao here cause Taiwanese style is way better. 

Talking about the cons: the service is no where professional. They forgot to bring the drinks all the time. They are more waiter/waitress than what they need but they are always lack and slow on the customer.

I ordered the garlic tonkotsu ramen (which is what they&#39;re popular for) and it just tasted like a garlic flavored ramen? Nothing stood out for me to be like, wow! This is soooo amazing! It was just okay. The hostess and our server were nice but they kept on forgetting to bring one of our side orders... They brought it to us when we were already finished (they were really busy) so we didn&#39;t get to enjoy it. One thing I will give them is how nice and clean the restaurant was. Although it was small, the interior decor was industrial and modern. But definitely wasn&#39;t worth the 1 hour and 30 min wait. If I&#39;m ever around the area and it&#39;s not busy, maybe I&#39;ll stop by again and try another dish. For now, I&#39;ll just stick to eating at Tokyo-Ya Ramen."

By the time we were seated at the bar, I was starving. They have great ramen options and I chose the traditional miso ramen. The customer service here was great, we were greeted promptly, and we got our food quite quickly.

The food definitely hit the spot and I got into a food coma. The flavors were great and everything was tasty. However, it was not the best ramen or Japanese restaurant I have been to. Which to be honest, is a good thing. Especially if I live in Dallas and my favorite Japanese restaurant is in Dallas, it&#39;s probably for the best anyway. But this place is worth a try."

After investigating for months on the best day/time to go I decided to give it a try.  I mean if that many people are willing to wait in a line that long and that often the place must be doing something right. Right?

Unfortunately I was not overly impressed. As you can see by my three-star rating I did enjoy my meal, I guess I just had high hopes.

When it came to service they were surprisingly efficient despite be slammed with customers so don&#39;t let a long line discourage you like it did me. They are quick with turnaround but not pushy when you&#39;re there.
 
As for the food I highly recommend the Takoyaki Octopus Dumplings for an appetizer, the table will thank you. It was one of the most unique and interesting dishes I have tried in some time, very rich but very good. As you can see my experience here started out five-star. My disappointment however stemmed from the Ramen. There is no denying Kizuki&#39;s authenticity with locations all over Taiwan and Japan, but I just was not fond of the broth. 

My second bad experience with this place was that my friend was doubled charged on his credit card statement after we had left. They did fix the problem once it was brought to their attention a few days later but it was still either a big oversight or a blatant attempt to overcharge. I cannot blame the restaurant for the actions of one server and no harm no foul, but still.

All-in-all I would recommend this place to any Ramen and Japanese cuisine enthusiast. It is authentic and has great service. I can&#39;t let my tastebuds and one bad apple spoil the great job they have done with their restaurant."

Thick broth and their chashu was well cooked too. Long wait if you are with a group, very short wait if you visit alone. For the most part the waitresses there were very nice and helpful.

Rant: Not a 5 star because my waiter, Michael, was not friendly at all and doesn&#39;t smile. He rushed the bill while I was in the middle of eating and still wanted to order more, brought my extra noodles BEFORE my ramen came before my ramen got here so it was cold by the time I used it. Ultimately I felt rushed and did not want to order more because my waiter seemed annoyed the whole time.

The ramen here is pricier than Los Angeles, but I really shouldn&#39;t compare. I got the vegetable ramen. Pretty good but I found the broth saltier than I prefer. The pork belly buns are huge but a bit hard to eat. Breaks apart easy. It&#39;s in Cap Hill, so it&#39;s pretty popular and there is often a line so the wait may be longer than usual."

Thank goodness Shiros allowed us to push back our reservation. Staff here is super friendly and the wait goes by pretty fast (20 min at 5p.m on a Sunday).  Love that there are 3 different noodles to choose from , that you can customize their texture, and that you can customize the sodium level of your broth. 

Garlic Tonkatsu Ramen: Garlic explosion in your mouth but in the best kind of way. The creamy tonkatsu broth mixed with the wonderful cooked down garlic made for a flavorful and rich broth.  The egg here is perfectly oozy goozy (soft boiled). Ask to make the broth spicy, you won&#39;t regret it!

Tonkatsu Tsukemen: There are three different tsukemen broths but I chose tonkatsu. The side dish of noodles and sides is HUGE. Came with an abundant amount of bamboo shoots, greens, and chashu pork. The broth is rich with a tang of vinegar but thankfully not sweet. Usually served with flat noodles but I asked for the thick and wavy ones. They will add bland broth to your remaining broth after to make it sippable. Still not as amazing as David Chang makes tsukemen looks but definitely enjoyable! 

Open kitchen concept so you can see all the ramen deliciousness made in front of you. Would love to try their yuzu ramen next time!"

For appetizers, I really liked the fired chicken and the potato croquette. Both are served hot and full of flavor. The pork buns are very underwhelming and I would not recommend it. It has a piece of meat and some cucumber. Definitely not worth it. The ramen is delicious and comes with everything pictured in the menu. You can also add on extras for additional costs. Each bowl has a generous portion of noodles and I have always left really full and ready for a nap. 

It can get pretty busy during lunch time and there is always a wait. Might be better to come with one or two people so you can sit at the bar and have a short wait time. The staff thanks you in Japanese as you leave so you know this place must be pretty legit."

Last night when my partner and I visited the location we were treated very poorly and ended up walking out. We had wrote our name on the list, &amp; requested a table. After seating everyone a head of us on the list the host called my name and tried to seat us at the counter with no discussion first. I pointed out that we had requested a table &amp; she became very rude. She said that she had just sat all of her 2 person tables and we could sit at the counter or go wait but it would be a long time for a table. 
I asked why it would be a long wait when other tables were finishing up. 
She said that because there were only two of us that she would only seat us at a 2 person table. I asked why and she said they were to busy for us to sit at a 4 person table. I pointed out to her that there was no one on the list after us, and she said that we could wait for a 2 person table or sit at the counter.  I asked if I could speak to a manager about this and she said there was no manager or person on duty we could speak with. 
My partner and I were extremely disappointed with her level of unprofessional behavior and tone. 
Rather than continue to discuss the issue with her, and be treated poorly we left the restaurant. We were very disappointed with this experience. We have never been denied a table there before, even when busy. This ordeal tonight will make me think twice about visiting the restaurant again. Since there &#34;was no manager&#34; working I had tried to reach out to the company via their website, but unfortunately they chose to not respond."

The ramen itself was pretty good too. The miso came with a piece of pork, bamboo shoots, green onions, and bean sprouts, while the garlic shoyu had all of the above-mentioned ingredients plus an egg. You can have a less sodium version of the garlic shoyu, and the miso has a spicy option too. The broth was flavorful but a bit on the oily side. Overall, it was good!"

1. Get ready to smell like oily Chinese food after you leave the restaurant. Advice: wear something u don&#39;t mind being smelly, and make sure you take a shower that night. The restaurant owner should really think about getting a better ventilation system.

2. For the price it&#39;s charging the amount of noodles are less than other ramen places

3. Gyoza is only soso, you can&#39;t really taste the &#34;meat&#34; part in the pork gyoza more like a mush of something...( I might be a little overly critical on this one because I really usually love Japanese gyoza"

Shoyu Garlic, sub pork belly is some of the best around. I&#39;ve tried a few other joints around town and this version of the shoyu garlic is the best. 

One draw back of this place is that if you order an appetizers the always serve them with the meal. Super annoying if your looking to enjoy an nice meal with friends and family. I&#39;ve even had apps hear served after the main course. Make you feel like you&#39;re getting rushed out of the joint.

Any how. If you like Ramen, this place hold up."

Overall, I&#39;d say that this location is just as good. Their dishes are some of the best, most elevated ramen in the area, and a place you&#39;ll long to return to on the next rainy Pacific Northwest day.

The restaurant is located next to the Regal movie theaters at Northgate. Like the Bellevue location, the wait times here are long, but in my experience actually a little shorter than in Bellevue. The decor on the inside is cool. Dark wood tables and floors, but lots of light, airy, and huge Japanese-style paintings cover nearly all of the walls. They&#39;re fascinating to look at. 

Service is typically pretty attentive, but the staff shares the load on running food and drinks out to tables. And for some reason, they make a lot of mistakes. Just keep in mind that you may need to double check the food they bring you just to be sure it&#39;s what you ordered. 

Anyway, the food is the most important thing, and Kizuki&#39;s food is awesome. We almost always go for wings or the potato croquettes as an appetizer. I&#39;m probably a bigger fan of the croquettes, which are freshly breaded, fried, and drizzled with katsu sauce for an amazing and unique flavor that I haven&#39;t found anywhere else. For the main entree, I highly recommend the Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. This is their most popular dish for good reason, and the broth is superb -- rich, aromatic, and herbaceous. Noodles and veggies are generous. You&#39;ll love it. Add or subtract ingredients (there&#39;s a large list of various choices of stuff to add in) at your whim. Obviously there&#39;s a modest charge to add more ingredients, but prices are reasonable so don&#39;t hesitate. And enjoy.

If you love elevated ramen soup with delicious broth, made fresh with great ingredients, Kizuki should definitely go on your list."

Soooo, this place was formerly Kukai but is now known as Kizuki. For anyone who has been to the previous restaurant, everything is more or less the same in regards to what&#39;s offered for food options. There are plenty of ramen options (with low sodium / traditional broth offered), multitude of appetizers/small plates, and rice dishes. Prices are still reasonable with portions that are filling.

Swung by here to catch up with my friend and we both left satisfied. My friend had the ramen and from the looks of it, she did enjoyed that bowl quickly! For me, ordered the kaarage don (fried chicken rice bowl) and it was yummy. Topped with kaarage + lettuce on a bed of rice, this dish was quite filling and I couldn&#39;t finish all of it. The sesame sauce used was sweet and savory and the kaarage had a nice crunch to it. For appetizer, my friend and I split the chicken wings and these were yummy! Not too oily and with a citrusy after taste, I will say these wings are a definite hit for me.

Despite some of the reviews mentioning bad service, the staff we interacted with were friendly and were quick in their services. Overall, I enjoyed my visit here and would come again for more food."

Upon arrival, we added our names to a waiting list and were seated within fifteen minutes. We each ordered a bowl of chicken broth-based ramen, and the bowls arrived with steaming hot broth, noodles, a molten yolk soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bok choy, and spring onions. As impressed as I was with the quality of the accouterments, the broth was so-so. Lacking flavor, I asked for hot sauce, and our waiter kindly obliged. Three spoonfuls of hot sauce later, the broth was sippable and I commenced to eat my ramen. 

I highly recommend skipping the chicken broth-based bowls here. The menu isn&#39;t as informative, especially since it lacks pictures of non-ramen items. If you need a bowl of soup and Campbell&#39;s just isn&#39;t cutting it, then come here. 

FYI: If you&#39;re splitting a check, the recommended 15/18/20/25 tip calculation is for the full check."

The host and waiters were fast and friendly and the ambiance of the restaurant was modern yet comfortable.  

The food we ordered was fantastic, and we ordered a lot!  We started with the veggie tempura, takoyaki, and spinach gomae.  All three were delicious in flavor and well sized for the price.  I really loved the freshness of the spinach and tempura and takoyaki were definitely as fresh as they come.  For ramen we tried the pork tonkatsu and the spicy pork.  While both were good the tonkatsu was hands down the most flavorful ramen I have ever had.  The salt and richness was perfect, the noodles and pork were cooked to perfection and the toppings were plentiful but not too much.  

Great meal, great service.  We will come back!"

Called in to place an order and was put on hold but nobody ever picked back up. We were already in the car so we decided to just walk in and place an order. The hosts can&#39;t take togo orders so we had to wait for a server which took 5+ min. 

All we ordered was 2 chicken ramens and we were in the restaurant for over 35 min waiting for the togo order. They were busy but not full.

Overall, the broth for both were really well done. I liked the fact that the tonkotsu was rich and creamy.  The veggie wasn&#39;t too salty and had a nice spice to it. I really liked the flavors of the ramen, but the noodles themselves were on the soft side. The noodles were still good, but I like them to be just a little chewy.

It was going to be our first experiences trying Authentic Ramen and I grew up on the instant ones and was not a huge fan. I figured maybe authentic ramen will be 10000x better. The interior decor was cute and simple and I was surprised to be taken to the back because I just assumed the front of the restaurant was how big the place was!

I am currently on a Pescetarian/Vegetarian restriction diet (for health reasons) and maybe I didn&#39;t look hard enough but I couldn&#39;t find anything other than the Vegetable Ramen option. There was one that caught my eye but I asked our server and he said it was not Vegetarian, sad. 

So I ordered the Vegetable Ramen and the boyfriend ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen. He said it was absolutely delicious while mine on the other hand was &#34;interesting&#34; and we all know what that means. Not that great right? 

Well, before you go on about complaining, here is the best part though- the server didn&#39;t really mention anything about specialties and what&#39;s good but the manager personally delivered our food to us (I&#39;m sure he does it all the time, I&#39;m not hinting any special treatment).

Right off the bat, he let&#39;s me know unless I am a die hard Vegetarian, he would not recommend the Vegetable Ramen. I told him it was okay and that I will go ahead and try it. He insisted he come back after I try a few bites to see if I wanted it replaced. Now coming from 4+ years of food service experience, I hate to see a good plate/bowl of food go to waste because someone was too picky or disliked it (unless really necessary). 

He came back to ask me how it tasted and at this point I had one bite in and it was 
&#34;interesting&#34; the soy milk base definitely made it a bit odd but bearable. After I told him it&#39;s alright and I will finish the rest he left and about halfway through, it got too salty... weird... I know right since the soy milk should make it bland?

Overall, it&#39;s something I&#39;m glad I tried just so I can get a grip on what Vegetable Ramen tasted like but won&#39;t be eating it again."

I love their marinated eggs and added one to my bowl. Honestly this was a fantastic meal, arguably better than their delicious ramen, and filling too at $8.50 plus $1.50 for the egg (it may seem weird to pay the price of a dozen eggs for a single one, but trust me, they&#39;re worth it)."

I&#39;ve read reviews about the long waits and wow they were right. It took us forever to just be able to sit down. We were then brought back to what seemed like a bar sitting area and noticed staff were yelling irashimase which is a greeting in japanese. It a nice gesture if the staff didnt half ass it just because they had to say it. 
Now we sat down and ordered some tempura and the tonkatsu ramen with some tea. While waiting for our food we were just talking and observing. They were busy and the server seemed really stressed out. I almost felt bad for them. Then i finanly noticed a small fly fly by me. Then another and another. I was trying to figure out were they came from and i saw a lot of flies on a wall infront of us. Take a look at the picture and zoom in on all the black dots. Im really hoping this isnt a common thing here because that would be just gross and people eating here need to know.
I didnt say anything and got our ramen about 25 minutes later and forgot about our tempura that came about 15 minutes after that. Kinda strange they should time the food better because i was way too full to eat the tempura. Ramen was meh, i just wasnt in the mood anymore after seeing all the flies around me.

A serious decline in food &amp; service is the sign that Kukai no longer runs this restaurant.  We were absolutely perplexed by the change in quality...seeing the name change here on yelp, it&#39;s all making sense now.

If you are a serious devotee of Japanese ramen, be wary of this location. A recent visit yielded one completely inedible bowl of ramen &amp; mediocre execution on our other items.

First, the worst: a bowl of Vegetable Ramen with broth that was inedible. I couldn&#39;t understand why one dining partner took one bite of his soup and pushed it away. When the rest of our table tried it, we understood. First - an off-putting amount of maple aroma. Then, the bite - super heavy imo (yam) flavour. Not good - it tasted like imo that had gone bad, &#34;a regurgitated maple bar taste&#34; as one companion put it.

Then - egg shells in one bowl of Shio Ramen - and the soft-boiled eggs - made in advance - had not been brought to proper temp. In all our dishes, the egg was cold. That&#39;s poor execution. Further, the Shio Ramen was off-puttingly sweet....and the Goma-Ae (spinach with sesame) was overly sweet as well, like Jif pb thinned with sesame oil. Not very good. 3 of the 4 in our party had stomach aches all night.

Too pricey (about $15 per person) to be this bad, with a very weird vibe in the dining room - the servers are not properly trained in Japanese restaurant etiquette - we won&#39;t be returning."

Update: they decided to comp our appetizer, which I&#39;m glad about because &#34;geso karaage&#34; aka calamari should not be 6.50 if it&#39;s like six or seven pieces of fried squid on a lil plate.

In a city with such a cold, wet climate if you serve anything hot and spicy I will be there.

Ramen: Broth was very nice while the low sodium option hit my palette right while the creamy broth made me drowsy like a warm bowl of milk. The noodles on the other hand was coily, and spongy like maruchan.

Texture &amp; taste were on point, with a light crisp cover.  I do recommend as a started for those who do or don&#39;t like octopus

Entree:  pork chasu don was overwhelm with white steam rice with texture &amp; tasted of steam rice that came from the bottom of the rice cooker.  The pork tasted as if sauce was added after the park was cook and not as the pork was grill.  The flavor was not in the pork but just outter

The stables meant has a very contemporary design with a great atmosphere, the best of the visit in a good location 

Service was definitely not on point, we had to ask other servers for refills, hot sauce etc...the establishment was not matching the service"

It&#39;s really good though and their prices are pretty decent considering. However, it&#39;s disappointing they don&#39;t offer plain miso soup here and their drink menu is a tad overpriced and extremely limited. Last time we went here a server was openly rude to two Asian girls that asked to move to a new table and he scolded them like they were children and it was pretty awkward to say the least. 9/10, would awkward again!"

Luckily it was easy to find parking in the garage. My friends and I went on a Monday night and I was surprised with how busy it was, it took a while to get seated. You sign-in at the front with someone&#39;s name and the # of people in your party and once everyone arrives, you put a check next to your name so the hostesses know that you are ready. There weren&#39;t too many seats for all of us to gather around while we were waiting but we somehow managed to pass the time.

Our table was really comfy and our server was really nice and helpful. We first had an order of gyoza but there was literally only enough for each person to have one. Still pretty good. I ordered the miso ramen while everyone else ordered the shoyu since this was the first time for some of my friends to get ramen. I really enjoyed my ramen but my stomach wasn&#39;t satisfied so I got to finish one of my friends ramen. The miso ramen had a really rich taste, there was a lot of peppers in there though which I&#39;m not a huge fan of but I still managed. When I tried my friend&#39;s shoyu ramen, it reminded me of cup of noodles but even better! It had the perfect amount of sodium to me

Compared to the one in Bellevue, this location is definitely bigger. I haven&#39;t been to the one in Capitol Hill yet but I would still visit this location when an occasion calls for it. Of all ramen places though, I really like Arashi the best but this one is still good!"

After seeing a movie at the independent film Crest Theatre in Shoreline on the evening of Fri, 5/27/16, we decided to check out the switchover of Kukai to Kizuki Ramen.

Well, to not beat around the bush, I&#39;ll go ahead and say we were disappointed with the changes.   First, the music volume had been boosted way up, and they were playing some annoying and trashy urban mixes.

***** Note:  after I posted this review, I received a message on 6/2/16 from Nuri, Kizuki&#39;s owner.   Interestingly, he told me that ownership has not changed, but that they changed the name from Kukai to Kizuki to avoid a copyright issue with a French company.  Nuri indicated that nothing else has changed (i.e. menu).   I appreciate Nuri&#39;s note, but the ambience and service did change since our previous visit.   ******

We were seated quickly (and Kizuki has expanded the waiting area by removing tables).   The menu, which did not have Kizuki&#39;s name on it, was essentially the same, or was the exact same, menu that was available under Kukai.  JP ordered ramen.  For appetizers we ordered the seaweed salad.  For my main course, I ordered pork Don Chas and a pork bun.  

My Don Chaso and pork bun came out (before the appetizer).  Then came the seaweed salad.  After 15 minutes had passed since the last food was brought (and 30 minutes since my entrée had been brought out), JP&#39;s ramen still was yet to be seen.

So JP beckoned to one of the staffers to ask about the ramen, and the guy muttered something about it still having had to be &#34;cooked&#34;.   We didn&#39;t want to wait any longer, especially since I had received my entrée a half hour ago, so JP cancelled his ramen order.

Almost immediately, a guy, possibly the manager, stormed over and aggressively and loudly asked &#34;Do you have a problem?&#34;, like we had done something wrong.  

This person-in-charge blurted out, &#34;Hey it&#39;s Friday night, what do you expect&#34;.   Well for one thing, better timing in bringing orders out.   Even though, in all fairness, the pork bun and spinach salad were delicious and excellent, we explained that we were ready to leave.  

The icing on the cake was when the person-in-charge then brought out the wrong tab.   I understand that mistakes can happen, and can deal with that.  But what I don&#39;t like is rude treatment from restaurant employees."

Will I still eat in? Of course, but the lines, poor coordination between staff, and general disarray while trying to get a meal (waiting 20 min for two people while most of the bar sits empty, really?) are big enough factors to make me go elsewhere. 

When the food you ordered comes out correctly, it&#39;s amazing. But I&#39;m tired of paying for something and getting a completely different meal when I get home."

It was so nice to step into this restaurant and be served excellent ramen without having to wait in line for two hours. Most of the ramen joints I know of seem to attract a hip following and are therefore out of bounds unless you feel like standing on the sidewalk for an hour, but Kizuki, while clearly popular enough to be full up at the height of the lunch rush, was not so crowded that I felt claustrophobic.

I ordered the vegetarian ramen, and props to the chefs, because it was absolutely full of flavor and texture. It&#39;s easy when cooking to fall back on meat as the only option for a full-bodied dish, but this ramen was wonderful with no meat at all. I truly appreciate the creativity and consideration that goes into creating something like this so that I can share a meal with all my meat eating friends and not feel weird or left out or leave dissatisfied.

My meat eating companion got some sort of pork based ramen and absolutely loved it, which doesn&#39;t sound striking until you find out that he&#39;s from England and he&#39;d never had ramen in his life. His first Japanese food ever was the week before. So props to Kizuki for converting him! It was the first meal he had in America that he said he&#39;d actually seek out if he had an opportunity to eat something similar in England rather than reverting to his typical diet.

I also love that alongside the ramen this menu really does fill the traditional Izakaya role with all the classics--my favorite tempura, croquette, and onigiri were all on the menu and reasonably priced.

I will definitely be back to Kizuki for more of their lovely vegetarian ramen, and I&#39;ll happily be bringing friends who don&#39;t share my dietary constraints. Four stars for near perfection because I&#39;ve had Hondaya in L.A., but aside from that, probably my favorite Izakaya."

I have tried a lot of different kinds of noodles here, but garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen is still my all time favorite. So definitely try that. Snacks here are just alright. Have not tried something that I think is like very good. Just average.

Definitely pick low sodium. I am such a salty person I think the low sodium is like pretty salty already. And usually as all traditional Japanese noodle place (in Asia, the portions are always smaller), I never have enough food to get me full, so I just order extra noodles. 

This place so popular and I keep running into people here all the time. But yeah, the line is super long. So be ready for the longgg wait."

I&#39;ve been to one other Kukai locations around town so I sorta knew what I wanted and knew where to look.  Similar decor, very nice looking place.

After looking at the menu, we decided to get an order of the octopus takoyaki balls as a starter.

I decided to make a game time decision and switch up my ramen order and try the &#34;Chicken Rich Ramen&#34; (low sodium).  It was ok,  chicken broth was pretty flavorful, the ramen noodles itself was quite good, some veg and that awesome egg.  It said chicken &#34;chashu&#34;, it just seemed like boiled chicken thigh meat from the broth it was cooked it.....is that what chashu means?  Whatever, I ate it.

We also ordered got the &#34;Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen&#34;, that was pretty good!  Pork broth was super flavorful, meat was good, and for everything else in the bowl she seemed to enjoy it very much.  

After we received and started eating our ramen bowls for a good few minutes, I forgot we ordered the takoyaki because that came out later. Just as good as I remember it!  Crispy, creamy and octopuss-y!  One of my favorite side dishes or starters.

Service was ok, not quick on the refills of water as you have to flag them down, but quick to give you your bill and run your card. 

Anyways, this location was ok but quite convienient for me, so yea whatever."

Started with appetizer of chicken karaage (6$), then the spicy ramen w/ regular spiciness (10$) and chicken rich ramen (11$). At first glance the chicken karaage is what appears to be a disappointing 5 pieces... but then you realize it&#39;s the quality that counts. The outside is a crisp thin layer of skin, while the inside a tender softness that is completely unexpected. Every bite is lean meat and made even better in the mayo sauce. Chicken rich ramen&#39;s broth was so hearty and refreshing. The noodles had a nice texture to them, while the egg was cooked on the outside and runny on the inside. There was SO MUCH lean chicken in the bowl.. I was so full upon finish. Spicy ramen had a little kick and was equally exceptional."

I just got out of the movie and the Ramen place right out in front. Perfect timing, lull in the dinner rush. Second time eating here in a week. Decided to try the Traditional Tonkatsu ramen and a potato croquette. We&#39;ll see how it goes.. 

It was a success. The bowl is stingy in size compared to the ramen I was used to having I the SF Bay Area. Could be lack of competition here or a carryover smaller size from the company&#39;s origins in Japan where American size portions are impossible. That means then to me, the prices are a couple $ too high, especially for size. I did order an extra portion of noodles to see how that worked out. I really don&#39;t recommend that. The amount of soup is simply too small and the overall taste etc is compromised. The side of potato croquette was quite successful. Tasty but again a bit pricey at $4.50 for a large tater tot.

The place is always full and populated with a significant Asian crowd which does provide a confirmative endorsement of the place to some extent as well. Finally, I have to complain about a pet peeve of mine. They provide a tipping guide with the check-because Americans are apparently too dumb to be able to multiply by 10% and double it for 20%. However, this guide shows tips as a percentage of the TOTAL bill, including taxes. Thus suggesting the patrons to tip of tax. I basically am offended by that. Just in case you have decided I am a d*ck, I generally leave 20% on the correct total and tonight left over 25%.

So, enjoy it."

The wait was very minimal, around 10 minutes..  We even came during the peak dinner hour.

We started with the Takoyaki.  It&#39;s a must get to start off your meal here!

Back to talking about the Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen.  The flavor was amazing!  The meat proportion was perfect!  I could imagine myself coming here every time I am craving ramen, which is almost once a week!  Especially if its cold and rainy (like it always is in Seattle)

One thing they need to work on is the service it&#39;s not bad it&#39;s not amazing it&#39;s just a little slow but since this is a popular place I&#39;m not going to pick on them too much, otherwise I really recommend this place if you want some authentic style Japanese Ramen noodles or cuisine, and don&#39;t forget to get your food with some calpico"

But my favorite menu items are non-ramen ones:

Onigiri with tuna - delicious by itself but divine with chili sauce (they&#39;ll bring some on the side if you ask)

Takoyaki - very tasty with big, chewy chunks of octopus. The sauce is also very savory and sweet.

Chicken wings - the garlic yuzu sauce on these wings makes them out-of-this-world and oh so finger-licking good! Fantastic every time!

Came here for a weekday dinner around 6pm and beat the dinner rush by a little bit. YUM!!

PARKING: Underground parking structure with plenty of parking - free!

WAIT: We waited only about 15 mins for a table for 2 (just beat the dinner rush). Tables in the front part of the restaurant for smaller parties, also bar seating. The tables in the back looked like they were for bigger parties. Looks like the wait could be upwards of 30 mins if there&#39;s plenty people!

FOOD: So many yummy options! Dare I say... the best ramen I&#39;ve had in a long time?! I had the chicken ramen since it was one of the &#34;different&#34; ones on the menu (and also a favorite noted on the menu). It definitely didn&#39;t disappoint!

I went here last night with my sister who was in town for a couple days.  We usually get the spicy ramen that comes with a slice of pork (yes, 1 slice so be prepared to order another $1.50 slice if youre hungry), bamboo shoots and spinach. There&#39;s a lot of sides to add into your ramen although the bowl itself would get you full.  I highly suggest ordering with the Low Sodium option if your desired entree has that because trust me, it does get very salty.  You can also request a side of dried chili peppers, chili paste and add half of a hard-broiled egg.  Thinking about it makes me hungry!  We also ordered the fried chicken which I don&#39;t really recommend because the batter was very thick and the chicken was extremely chewy.

Unfortunately every time I&#39;ve been something has gone wrong. Just today we waited 30 minutes for our food and were given three different reasons for the delay by three different people. One told us it was due to the type of broth. False. Finally the third just apologized and admitted it was a server mix up. 

Other times I have been here, I have had the same experience. Waiting, waiting and more waiting, followed up with lame excuses. This place hasn&#39;t seemed to get its rhythm down since opening.

We went here on Thursday, July 8th for lunch. We were seated pretty quickly by another waiter. But, it seemed like the waiter who took our order, James, didn&#39;t put in our orders. It literally took an hour for us, party of 4 to have our order ready. 1 hour!! Really? It&#39;s only ramen with what I&#39;m sure prepared broth. Our waiter, James, kept blaming the kitchen and the mishap the supposedly had while I saw that it didn&#39;t look like much going on in the kitchen. I noticed also, when the order came in, I asked for extra broth (ordered for extra broth). It took a long time for it to come, so we cancelled it, but then 5 mins later, another waiter came with the extra broth. Hmm, communication issues or really mishap in the kitchen? You tell me! 

So, really, did it really have to take 1 hour to be ready? I don&#39;t think so. I have been to literally tons of ramen places in my life including the ones in Japan and have never waited an hour for a bowl of ramen! It was ridiculous. Especially when you were there with guests from out of town and a restless 3 year old. OMG!  For this experience, our  orders should have been FREE although James offered us edamame on the house.

My cousins took me here to have ramen. We got a bunch of appetizers, chicken karage, veggie croquette, and pork belly bun. 

I decided to get 3 orders of the buns because I didn&#39;t know the size of the buns, I usually don&#39;t eat the fat of the pork, but I thought it was pretty good!!! The bun was soft and I enjoyed it. It&#39;s a little bigger than the Peking duck buns. It came with oyster sauce, mayo, and mustard sauces. 

The veggie croquette was good with bits of veggies mushed inside the potatoes. The karage wasn&#39;t too oily and the dipping sauce that came with it was good. 

I got the garlic tonkatsu ramen, it had a soft boiled egg (which I gave away), bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and, pork slices. So I was warned already that the ramen was salty so I opted for the less sodium kind and it was still a little salty, I kept drinking water! My cousin who ordered a cold ramen with no salt dipping sauce said his no salt tasted salty. You could also customize your ramen noodles, wavy, flat or thin. I got the wavy one because I love that kind. 

I told one of the guys who picked up our plates about the saltiness, he said we could get a clear broth one which is less salty and tastier for those who can&#39;t have salt. If i am ever around, I&#39;ll ask my cousins to take me back and try the clear broth one.

I ordered the Yuzu Shio Ramen. The soup and vegetables were very flavorful, noodles were pretty standard, and the egg were cooked to perfection!

Staff were prompt and very friendly! I did not have to wait too long for service or food to arrive. 

The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming, with Japanese decor."

Not having been before, it was a bit confusing trying to figure out what to order, but the food was good.

As someone who has a hard time with slimmer textures, it was hard to eat. Flavors were great though! I think I would try something else next time I go back, which I would.

And this makes sense, since it&#39;s tucked away in the center courtyard of the apartment complex/theater, so its presence isn&#39;t obvious to those passing on the street.

But just like their Bellevue location, Kukai doesn&#39;t fail to please.
It&#39;s a GREAT stop to make before walking over to the transit center to catch a ride, especially on cold winter days/nights.
And the staff are very accommodating too. Obviously if you come with a group, you&#39;ll have to sign in and wait a bit (as is to be expected at a popular/GOOD food restaurant), but if you&#39;re eating alone it&#39;s likely that they&#39;ll be able to immediately get you a single seat at the bar. You just need to mention that you&#39;re the only person in your party. (Cue Muppets- Party of One song... or Forever Alone meme... depending on your life outlook. ;-p )

Beyond seating service, the food is just as good as you&#39;d expect, having eaten Kukai before.
I&#39;ve had many of their Ramen dishes (Mmmmm soft boiled egg!), but this time I wanted to go SPICY! So I got their &#34;Spicy Ramen&#34;, and went a full 3/3 stars for spice.

... OMG.... SPICEGASM.
DELICIOUSNESS!

I had to pay as soon as I ordered, in order to make my bus to meet up with friends for New Years, (YES, they&#39;re open NEW YEARS EVE!) but the soup arrived hot and prompt and in all of its fresh delicious glory.

(Yes, they&#39;re open New Years. So sure, that means employees are working till like 10:30 on NYE, but we&#39;re NOT going to get our panties in a bunch over this (Right?... RIGHT??), because WE&#39;RE CONSUMERS here. So an establishment being open is a WELCOME convenience.)

Anyways, I highly recommend a stop, whether you&#39;re catching a bus or are grabbing a pre or post movie bite.

Mmmmmm YUM!"

The place itself gets packed, so be ready for a wait, especially if you head in during the dinner rush.  Don&#39;t go in dying of hunger and expect to eat right away!

For my taste buds, the low sodium is plenty salty enough.  Adding potato karoke as an appetizer and sake to my meal make it pretty much perfect! :)  No complaints.

I will say -- if you are looking for a place to hangout at length, this is probably not a good venue for that, since they keep a pretty high turnover on the tables (which is common for a ramen place -- so it&#39;s not a complaint, just a tip).

We were sat shortly after 15 min. Our waiter Chris arrived to the table with our waters immediately after we sat. We had never eaten here so he gave us the run down. So many options!

Had Garlic Ramen, Chicken Karaage, and Pork Gyoza. I repeat, it&#39;s not about food, but it&#39;s about customer service. 

This was me and my GF&#39;s second visit to this location. 
First time we went, the waiter hardly acknowledged me and focused more on my gf. Than, before we were even half way through our meal, waiter brings the check.  Felt rushed and promised never to come back.

However, we had visitors and we try to give it another chance. As soon as we sat down they asked what we like to order. We asked for a minute. then it took them 10 minutes to even take our drink order. Then, we had other waiter comes right after they took our drink order and ask if we want any drinks. Then, we had to flag some waiters who were standing around to take our order. 3 ramen and 2 appetizers took nearly 20 minutes to come out. Then we find out we have no chopsticks and had to flag someone down, again. Then, we had about 3 waiters repeating stopping by to check up on us, interrupting our conversations and try to take our plates away even though you can see food on them. 

Food is good. CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS. 

There are other Ramen places, take your money somewhere else, or

kizuki-ramen-and-izakaya-seattle-7,Robert B.,BaOFMm3cs-yEnOdTej3jDg,"Seattle, WA",1,1,0,61,1,lMJ-EnKYDQmqnJjItrXt-w,2.0,2016-01-17,"Normally, I&#39;m not big on chain restaurants, but I am a fan of the Kukai chain of ramen restaurants. I&#39;ve been to the locations in Bellevue and Capitol Hill, and am very much looking forward to the newest location opening in West Seattle. I do hope it is better than the Northgate location. While it is, if taken on its own merits, an acceptable restaurant, it is definitely the weakest member of the current Kukai team.

THE ROSES: Like all the Kukai locations, this one features a lovely dining room, very clean and done in a sort of &#39;Asian contemporary&#39;. Also like all the others, the food is lovely; my favorite is the spicy miso ramen. It&#39;s rich pork broth is further punched up with an excellent miso, and has just the right amount of heat. Another &#39;must have&#39; menu item is the almond tofu pudding: smooth and rich, yet light; it won&#39;t leave you feeling like Mr. Creosote. 

THE THORNS: Service leaves more than a bit to be desired. Our order took longer than usual to get to us, and we felt rather badgered by the staff to order quickly, eat it, and beat it. It is clear that this place is popular, and seeing the waiting area fill up rather early on a Sunday evening, I can understand their interest in turning tables as quickly as they can, but I do think it&#39;s rather poor form to swoop down and clear away one diners dish while the other is still eating; it comes across as a not-too-subtle hint to the other diner to &#39;hurry the hell up!&#39;. Prices seem a little steepish for the portion sizes, vis-a-vis some other quality ramen houses (Hokkaido Ramen Santouka is a better value).

Here&#39;s another pet peeve (though KR&amp;I isn&#39;t the only one that does this; lots of restaurants are guilty of this): printing on the receipt suggested tips at various rates (15 - 20 - 25 - 30%). I know this is helpful because most Americans are not that bright, and rather math challenged, but they have the sneaky technique of calculating the tip on the ENTIRE bill, including the sales tax. I believe in paying a percentage of the actual dinner, but asking me to pay 20% of the sales tax? Intellectually dishonest, if you ask me.

NEITHER ROSE NOR THORN: It is interesting to note the differences in clientele at the various KR&amp;I locations. Bellevue is still our favorite with the more mixed, upscale family-oriented crowd. Capital Hill is the worst, as it is crawling with the most obnoxious variety of Seattle Hipster. The Northgate location is in the middle. It caters to a younger, &#39;brocentric&#39; crowd that populates all the new apartments springing up in the area, but they&#39;re not as annoying as the &#39;manbuns, beardos, and woo girls&#39; crowd that you get on Cap Hill.

THE VERDICT: Solid performance in the kitchen is marred by a front of the house staff that not-so-subtly wants you to &#39;eat it and beat it&#39;. 

Best ramen in Northgate (though I think they&#39;re #1 in a field of one), but not the best service in a KR&amp;I."

We should of left, the table next to us got the wrong food, I wonder if the original party would like that if they knew their food sat on someone else table for awhile, maybe not. So we get our ramen first and it takes about 15-20 minutes to eat ramen , then we waited for the bill the house salad arrives. Call me a snob but I like my salad before the main course, so I said we are ready to go, can you wrap it to go, I pay the bill with tip because we did eat the ramen and waited in the waiting area for the salad.

I had their yuzu shoyu ramen, and it was pretty good - lighter broth than I&#39;m accustomed to, but good.  The soft-boiled egg was great.  My only complaint is that they had only one paltry piece of pork in my bowl.  My pork-loving baby ate most of my slice.

Service was good.  The manager(?) noticed our baby and stroller, and offered to put us in the corner of the bar, so we could park our stroller next to us.  The corner was also the perfect space away from the foot traffic, and we were able to wedge a highchair between us."

Let&#39;s examine the facts. One, service is good, but there are minor misses that add up. 

- Service.  They have a young staff, so it&#39;s hard to fault them, and there it wasn&#39;t the attention per se, but the overall quality.  Firstly, we ordered green tea, after one cup drank, we weren&#39;t offered any refills, or any other beverages.  They also missed the egg which we ordered, and another egg that was suppose to come with the bowl I ordered.  We had a to flag someone down, before it was to come. 

- Food.  Ramen was good, like many reviewers, is on the salty side of things.  I like mine that way, but I&#39;m thinking it some may not.  Also, when the way the food was presented, the bowls are way too big, for the small-ish portion that was in it.  The à la carte style of ordering is a little off putting, considering how the value wasn&#39;t exacting adding up, compared to many other local ramen joints around town.  Their noodles were firm, and tasty, but I wished there was more in the portion, considering it was 12 bucks before add-ons.  The add-ons are good, but realistically, should have been included in the ramen bowl. 

I&#39;m okay with this place, it&#39;s a-ok,  Maybe I&#39;ll come again, but it&#39;s just pricy for the value."

Nothing bugs me more than waiters/waitresses not coming around to refill my water. It wasn&#39;t super busy so I should expect my water to get refilled at least once. I&#39;ve literally been sitting here for the past 15min with an empty water cup, well not exactly empty cuz all the ice melted while I was waiting for more water. I purposely didn&#39;t flag anyone down just to see if it would ever get filled and I still have not seen anyone come around to even ask me if I wanted more water. There&#39;s a lot of sodium in ramen so they should be expecting it


And the previous time I was here, my girlfriend ordered her usual Shoyu ramen which she&#39;s been getting for the past 2 years we&#39;ve gone here. But for some strange reason, it came with thin noodles. We asked the waiter (Adam?) and the guy tried to argue with her saying that it has always been thin noodles and said he is going to have to charge extra for the wavy noodles. But he came back after speaking with his manager and replaced it free of charge. The fact that he tried to argue is what ticked us off. We swore not to come back for a while after that incident but we came back together for the convenience factor. But I won&#39;t make this same mistake again. 

This place has gone down hill recently. I used to love coming here every week. Not sure what changed besides the name. I&#39;m going to give my business to Aloha Ramen down the hill."

First, I am able to bring my dog and sit on the patio with her. Second, they have to-go! But as for the ramen itself, it&#39;s so-so.

I don&#39;t eat pork broth, so there are only two options I can have - the chicken or the vegetarian. I&#39;ve had the chicken twice. So, yes, it&#39;s still good, but the depth of flavor isn&#39;t as good as other ramen I&#39;ve had. I chose the full sodium route because I LOVE salt! My second time around I ordered a side of garlic paste that I added to the ramen and it greatly enhanced the ramen. I also ordered the wavy noodles instead of the thinner ones it comes with (I just prefer the wavy). The potato croquettes are very delicious as well.

My friend had the garlic ramen special (low sodium). I tried a sip of the broth, and holy moly, it&#39;s very delicious. But again, I don&#39;t eat pork, so it&#39;s not something I would ever order.

This restaurant is also a chain with currently 3 locations in Seattle - Bellevue, Capital Hill, Northgate. I&#39;ve tried all 3 and in my opinion, Northgate is the best in terms of quality and service. Parking is also not a problem.

The ramen itself is moderately priced ranging from $10-$12, with the option for extra noodles at $2. You can specify the type of noodles you would like, firmness of the noodle, and low-sodium vs traditional (high-sodium) broth. The broth could have more flavor but it&#39;s not unbearable.

I had the spicy ramen, youngest had tonkatsu shoyu and we shared an order of takoyaki.  While I&#39;m a fan of the food, the service, or the lack of, was waning.  We had to ask for water, water refills and basically only saw the server to take our order and bring us the check.

Food-wise, my ramen was excellent, granted I wished the soup broth was more temperature hot, the broth balance was wonderful, not overly spicy just flavorful with a hint of a kick, very Japanese style in essence of spice and flavor.  Price-wise it could have been a tad bit bigger in portion size, but that&#39;s just me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  My cuz opted for the low sodium broth, I tasted it, it wasn&#39;t bad, but had a sweet flavor to it which I was wasn&#39;t fond of, but for a low sodium option it wasn&#39;t bad.

So when Kukai was opening in Northgate, literally 5 minutes away from my house, I WAS ECSTATIC!! 

My mouth waters at the thought of a hot bowl of fresh ramen! As someone who has been to Japan and loves ramen, I think I can say with confidence that Kukai is darn close to the real thing. Heck, it is the real thing! The broth is rich, hearty and full of flavor. I&#39;ve had most of the different ramens, including the miso, garlic tonkatsu, shoyu, and the cold broth where you dip the noodles. Many of the entrées come with veggies, sliced meat, and a soft-boiled egg. You can add additional toppings for $2 or less. Definitely add the egg if it doesn&#39;t come with your ramen; it was braised in soy sauce and is still yolky on the inside! 

Their appetizers are also great! My favorites would have to be the chicken karaage and agedashi tofu! If you like the karaage, try it as a don on a bed of rice and salad with a sweet sesame dressing!

Seeing such an exploitation of human labor like that made me lost my appetite, I genuinely felt bad for the staff. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the manager turned out to be Kim Jong Un. A little tip: you&#39;re lucky to have such a hardworking and professional staff like that, don&#39;t overwork them. To sum up, this place is a Titanic of restaurants, If there&#39;s an option to give this place a negative 5 star, I would totally do it."

Had to wait a few minutes for a seat because the place was busy on a Saturday afternoon. It was my first time here, so I got the shoyu plus some pork buns. Not bad on the buns. The ramen was super good and a great size too. I wasn&#39;t able to finish it all though. They had lots of flavor options that I&#39;ll have to try next time- like the miso based ramen!"

It was okay. Not the best ramen I&#39;ve had, but not the worst. Service was... polite but a little rushed. 

I got the yuzu shiro ramen with half sodium and the salt level was perfect. Full sodium would&#39;ve been waaay too salty! It came with bamboo shoots (which I don&#39;t like, shame on me for not speaking up), some sort of veg (some of which had a weird bite to it), noodles of perfect firmness, a single slice of char siu (a little dry, very little fat) a soft boiled egg (perfect with a hint of sweetness) and some pretty saffron-colored threads of.. something. I tried a bite and it was thready (duh) and a little spicy. I still don&#39;t know what it is. The ramen portion looked small in the size of the bowl it came in. Go for smaller bowls- can you at least try to trick me into thinking I&#39;m paying for more than I am? :P

I came after the lunch rush-- so after 1:30 PM on a Monday. It wasn&#39;t too full. The front had people at most tables but the back room was pretty empty. I wasn&#39;t even given the option of a table (even though it was just me- I just like space). I was shown a spot at the counter between two people already eating. The tea came pretty quickly (just warm, not hot) and the waitress asked me if I was ready to order before I even picked up the menu. And greeting me. Someone else ended up taking my order. When the food finally came out (two chapters of Jim Butcher book later), it was lukewarm. Wasn&#39;t even hot. But I was hungry and didn&#39;t want to wait anymore.

No one asked me how my food was, as they asked the woman who sat next to me twice. The check was placed at my 11 o&#39;clock before I was even done eating. 

Nice to know that there&#39;s a ramen place on the northside that&#39;s not bad. Just wish the service was better. And the food was hotter. :/"

Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5

This place is surprisingly big on the inside! We went at a pretty busy time and the host up front estimated that we&#39;d be seating in ~40 minutes but the wait was more like 20 minutes. The staff is super sweet here. We were starving so we went next door to get fries and they didn&#39;t say anything even though we brought it in with us and were eating while we were ordering hahah.

We got the 
- Gyoza appetizer: came in 5 pieces, nothing too special

- Garlic special ramen with spicy sauce on the side: This was pretty darn good. The thing I noticed first was how well the noodles were cooked. The broth was super tasty and not TOO thick, but flavorful and not overwhelming (I wanted to drink all of the broth, but I didn&#39;t want to shrivel up and die later). It tasted awesome with the spicy sauce. I normally don&#39;t like bamboo shoots but they tasted great in the broth here. The soft boiled eggs were good but a little cold in the middle. The pork was probably the disappointing part. It was very thin and not that flavorful/fatty. 

Get the traditional broth - it&#39;s not THAT salty. I&#39;ve definitely had saltier broths haha."

So I never went back.

A yearish later, I was sitting in my apartment and had a serious craving for some ramen. But I had none at my apartment and was too lazy to go to the store. Since I live literally right above Kizuki, I figured I&#39;d give it another chance.

Glad I did!

The first time I went, I got one of the plainest things on the menu. That was my mistake. This second time around, I went for the spicy ramen, low sodium, and added chicken. It was fantastic! I went for the spiciest (3/3) and it was just the kick I was looking for. I couldn&#39;t resist wolfing down the entire bowl of broth--something I pretty much never do.

Still a little pricey for a bowl of soup in my opinion, but I was very happy with the meal. I won&#39;t be here every month or anything, but whenever I get a soup craving, this will be my go-to spot hands down"

They won&#39;t give you a table unless everyone in your party is present. When I first went in, i thought that it would be awhile for us to get a table, but they had much more space towards the back. 

So this is my first time having ramen. I ordered the Garlic Tonkatsu Ramen. I love garlic, and this had LOTS of garlic (I personally think you&#39;d have to be someone who loves garlic to really enjoy all the garlic in this ramen). I loved the soft-boiled egg. I remember seeing on the menu that they also have a challenge that you can take there as well. I look forward to trying the other ramen on the menu!l"

There are a couple shortcomings service-wise but they can definitely be overlooked. 

First off, the wait here was ~30 minutes, but it was a Friday night and was to be expected and the whole area itself is really nice and there&#39;s a little area outside with a fire and lounge chairs. But yes, just a word of warning on waiting in case you&#39;re the type to hate lines. Expect one! It really wasn&#39;t that long of a wait though so it&#39;s really nothing to complain about.

I ordered the Chicken Shoyu Ramen w/ an egg at one of my friend&#39;s suggestions and it was SO GOOD. I&#39;ve been to a couple ramen places now but just.. I was craving ramen the night I went and was just so super satisfied. It was exactly what I wanted in terms of taste, portion size and everything. The egg was an additional $1 but it is totally worth and comes totally recommended from me!

On service, I felt like they could have done a little better. There were constantly waiters walking around but my water glass was never refilled until I asked and that bothers me just a tiny bit but is not that big of a concern.

The aesthetic here is lively and fun and very nice. I really liked it and will definitely be coming back at some point (probably this weekend)."

We see a few people look in and leave occasionally bc of how packed it gets. Even when we&#39;ve gone at what we think are off peak times (2:30pm-3:30pm on a weekend) they&#39;ve had lines. We now bring a snack for our kid in case the wait will be long.
Now for the good - there are lines bc their food is amazing! Their chicken karagee is delicious and our son just eats that for lunch. We&#39;ve had the spicy, garlic Tonkotsu, and the miso ramens. All 3 are great but we&#39;ve settled on the garlic Tonkotsu (amazing flavor) and the spicy ramen (warms you up and clears up your sinuses when you&#39;ve got a cold or it&#39;s cold and wet outside). 
Service is no nonsense and efficient. Servers are not going to stand around and chat with you but that means they get everyone&#39;s orders in and out fairly quickly. That being said, a super friendly server did chat up our kid today while we waited and he loved it! We now live about 10 mi away and still visit as often as we did when were just a few miles away.

I had it once with regular size Ramen and once with thin Ramen.  Doesn&#39;t matter both are outstanding.  They offer gluten free Ramen too.

You can get a delicious bowl of Ramen for $8.  They have other Ramen on their menu, all ranging from $8-12.  But I&#39;ve been finding myself being drawn to Shoyu Broth ramen everywhere I go.

Came here with my GF, and of course I ordered the Shoyu Ramen, while she had the Garlic Tonkotsu.  We also ordered the Chicken Karrage as an appetizer.

Chicken Karrage came out hot, like it just came out of the fryer, they served it with a Mayo dipping sauce.  Was good, although I would like to see them use the piece of chicken that has less fat.

My Shoyu Ramen broth was clear, came with bamboo shoot, veggies, 1 seaweed wrap, and a pork Chasu. My GF doesnt like eggs, so I was able to take her Hardboiled egg.  Everything hit the spot for me.

I was able to try a spoon of her Garlic Tonkotsu, and I can clearly taste the difference in broth.  Even though her had more flavoring because of the Garlic, I still like my Shoyu broth."

I started going to the Bellevue location because one of my girlfriend&#39;s introduced me to it, and then started coming to this location because it&#39;s right next to where I work!

I love their ramen, I always order the Shoyu ramen (savory and slightly sweet) It comes with noodles, a seaweed wrapper, a slice of pork chashu, and greens. Pretty filling, this one is my favorite. For appetizers, I also always order their vegetable potato croquette (breaded Japanese panko bread crumb mashed potato that is deep fried) it&#39;s served on a bed of cabbage and drizzled with a sweet sauce, so good! Can&#39;t get enough of that stuff.

Prices aren&#39;t bad either and you get a pretty heaping serving size of the ramen, sometimes I can&#39;t even finish it.

I&#39;ve also tried their pork chashu don and ten don when I&#39;ve gone with friends and wasn&#39;t craving ramen. The chashu don is basically the slice of pork you get in your ramen, but shredded and served over rice with onions and a house sauce. Their ten don is tempura shrimp and assorted veggies served over rice with a savory sweet soy sauce, both are good as well.

The service is nice, they greet you at the door and check up on you just enough. Sometimes theres a wait especially during dinner or on the weekends."

Jk this place is 100x better than that basic ass top ramen and you know it! I prefer the Northgate location as well, since I was thoroughly disappointed by the Bellevue one. Northgate has great staff and fast service! 

I&#39;ve been here a couple times and it&#39;s always been pretty satisfying, especially on a cold day. Taiwanese people have a term we use frequently to describe texture, flavor, and feeling: &#39;q-q&#39; which very roughly translates to al dente. The noodles I had were perfectly cooked, perfectly q-q. This is very important in order to provide both contrast and compliment to the broth. 

Opt for the low sodium option and add the soft boiled egg, thank me later."

My husband and I were here tonight for dinner. We came around 5:30 and the restaurant was already half-full, but it&#39;s a Saturday night, so maybe it was a bit busier than normal. They don&#39;t take reservations on Fridays or Saturdays, anyway, so come when you want.

We started with the Drunken Clams. The broth was so good that we were spooning it up afterwards. My husband had the starter salad and I had a Caesar. The Caesar was wedge-style, with nicely sized slices of Parmesan and enough anchovies to make me very, very happy. We decided to order the Forest Floor Frenzy (parpadelle with rich, creamy mushroom/walnut sauce) and the Elk Bolognese (parpadelle with spicy elk ragu). We pretty much traded bites of two different dishes until we couldn&#39;t eat anymore.

Service was really good--the kind where plates are whisked away as soon as both parties are finished with the course, glasses are refilled at the halfway point, and courses are timed perfectly. It&#39;s a small restaurant but the waitresses were almost like dancers, the way that they managed to weave through the maze of tables and customers. We can&#39;t wait to go back.

The bizarre art is on full display throughout the place, even the bathroom has odd Starwars audio clips playing in the background.

I first saw this restaurant mentioned on Diners Drive-ins and Dives.  Guy Fieri watched as the chef prepared a clam dish with fresh pasta, jalapeños, bacon...and I was so stoked to try this dish!  We were a group of 3, and ordered risotto balls, elk bolognese, lamb w polenta, and the clam pasta dish.  Overall the flavors were good, but a couple of dishes were not freshly prepared as advertised.

The fried risotto balls came out very quickly, and although tasty with house made marinara; they were clearly reheated in some way.  The elk bolognese was very good, and my lady enjoyed the lamb.  My biggest gripe was the clams dish, the pasta was clearly old and the dish lacked pop as that I had envisioned after watching the DDD show."

I ordered their famous clam linguine ($19.25) to share, because the other Yelpers here have mentioned that the portions are huge. Wrong. Portions are actually pretty small so I suggest each person order their own dish. The clams and linguine was perfectly cooked and it tasted very light but rich at the same time. I loved the sea salt taste and smell from the dish. I highly recommend this. 

Parking was pretty easy to find nearby the restaurant.

Party platter was great. 4 different types of cheeses, honey, mustard, apples, candied walnuts and fresh unique meat. 

Elk bolonganse was rich and tasty. The noodles were fresh and soaked up the sauce.

I especially enjoyed the homemade pasta. The only compliant we had with other dish (devil angel angel hair special) was that it was way to spicy. It is labeled as a diablo which I get has a kick but this was too spicy to enjoy which was a little disappointing.

I ordered the clam linguini. The sauce (broth) seemed overly salted but the clams were good. The miss here was the pasta (which in my opinion should be the star of the show). Clumpy, stuck together and some bites were way to firm to call al dente. 
Two from our party had spaghetti and meatballs, and one other had the Elk Ragu. They all enjoyed their meals, and the Caesar Salad was dressed well.

He wanted spaghetti or meat raviolis. That&#39;s it,  nothing else would do. .  He got the Margarita Pasta and loved it,  he also loved the bathroom since they were playing a book on take of star wars.   We also ordered the Lasagna and I ordered The Pesto Raviolis,  for dessert we shared a strawberry peach pie with ice cream and whip cream.

Try a night&#39;s special and you cannot go wrong as it changes and is always something special.

We were about to leave and my friend said &#34;you need to use the restroom&#34;. Off I went and will recommend you do the same; after you&#39;ll understand my suggestion.

Every few years or so I get the need to visit this place..when I&#39;m in the mood for decent pasta and I an unpretentious vibe.
 
The food compared to other similarly priced Italian restaurants (it&#39;s not cheap despite the quirky factor ) is not bad but not great, either. I think Ethan Stowell can be blamed for raising the bar. Tavolata, How to Cook a Wolf...outstanding pasta. The service is a tad slow but the servers are awesome.  Super nice, friendly and knowledgable about the menu and the wines.

What really put them at average was their tiramisu...It was so disappointing. Basically a whip cream cake. Like, where&#39;d the espresso go? or the rum? They need to fix that stat.

So.....cute place, FUN place, a must go at some point in your Seattle life but could be better. Need better pasta noodles, less salt, and definitely, a better tiramisu."

Service: absolutely fantastic! Friendly, kind, great recommendations, helpful and all around great. Continually checked to make sure we had enough to drink and cleared plates quickly.

Ambiance: slightly loud but nothing crazy. Decor - original, to say the least. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a place quite like it. Definitely on the fun side!

Food: bread = amazing! Beet, goat cheese &amp; arugula salad = omg amazing!! Puttanesca with prawns = Spicy yet delicious! Prawns slightly overcooked, but still really good.

The decor is really cool, unique and fun! My friend and I shared the drunken clams, the menu says the broth is life changing, I have to agree it was so delicious and worth sipping up with their delicious bread they serve. We both also got the Elk Bolognese this was my time trying Elk and it was amazing! We also had a nice Shiraz that our waitress recommended to us.

The look and atmosphere blew my mind. Eclectic, fun, and cozy all in one.
Perfect for a date-night or to bring the family visiting in town. Super well priced for the amount of food you receive. 
We started with the bruschetta bread (served with olive oil and red wine vinegarette) -- AMAZING. 
I chose the special recommended to us...a meatball and pasta baked dish and my boyfriend tried the margarita pasta and not only was it so good but they give you so much food we each got a to go box to take home.
For desert we chose the Strawberry Baslamic flavored ice cream that they carry from a local ice cream shop near by (Molly Moons) and I&#39;ve got to say it was the best flavor of icecream I have had since I can&#39;t remember. I never wanted it to end. 

The service was immaculate, everyone was so nice, our water glasses were never half empty and it didn&#39;t hurt we received the table closest to their big open window accompanied by beautiful hanging floral arrangements draping the outside windowsill to keep us cozy (we saw the sunset as we ate our meal).

Add some wine to our meal and you could say this meal absolutely exceeded our expectations."

Fun quirky, cosy place to eat amazing pasta! Atmosphere was great, staff were friendly, attentive, funny and helpful. 

The menu is a nice size with some amusing names, it is not overwhelming and they have specials up on the board.

I read some previous reviews that the tables are close together and the cell phone policy sucks but it&#39;s a small intimate restaurant people!, if you want lots of space go sit in a field!

As for the cell phone policy......It&#39;s a nice idea, many places ask that you don&#39;t disturb other dinners and refrain from using your phone, plus it stops all the stupid couples ignoring each other while playing on their damn phones throughout the entire meal. They are not saying do not remove your phone or check it, they are asking that you are not THAT couple who never speak because they are glued to their phones or taking endless photos. Enjoy company and food for once!

Bottom line, If you want a cool place to eat where you can enjoy some great food, wine, company and &#39;proper&#39; olive oil to dip your bread into, then try Bizzarro. 
For all you cell phone junkies with space issues, stay home!"

The garlic &#34;monkey bread&#34; is as addictive as crack. 
Wine list is pretty good and not too expensive. 
I had the carbonara, which is out of my comfort zone for Italian places but I thought it was a perfect balance and super rich. She had the Forest Floor, which is her go to every time we come here. It is phenomenal.

The only thing that I don&#39;t like here is the meatballs. I have ordered Sunday special a couple of times and couldn&#39;t get into them. This time we ordered a side of them and had the same thing. They almost taste like the ones you get in the Trader Joes aisle. Just not my preference, but everything else more than makes up for it.

It was such a cozy table with dim heart lights, weird paintings, and all kinds of decorations around us.

 I don&#39;t know how people give this place a good review? The food is so bad and the owner is rude. People that come here must not eat out a lot or experienced good food before. My girlfriend and I went here for a casual dinner because we saw the Yelp reviews and thought &#34;why not&#34;. Everything was going ok until it came time to pay the bill. After eating an awful lasagna they charged our bill which was $18 for a child size lasagna plus a couple beers so $28. We had split our lasagna thinking it would be big because Italian food usually is served in large quantities, but it wasn&#39;t. They then charged us $4 to split the meal so now $32 total? Just to put it on another plate is $4?? Whatever no big deal, but it would have been nice to at least worn us prior and we would have just shared the plate. We still gave our server a tip of 20% because she was alright and met all our needs. But I guess the owner didn&#39;t think it was enough and changed the tip amount and gave himself a $21 tip on a $32 tab. Now I have to file a claim with my credit card and claim fraud for this place for stealing. Yes it&#39;s only $21 but stealing is never ok. Guess he was hoping we wouldn&#39;t notice the change he had made. These are reasons why we always keep our receipts. Never coming back nor will ever refer this horrible place to anyone. We had pretty high hopes from the reviews on Yelp but people warned me about this place, and that they are known for scamming people. I didn&#39;t listen and it came back and bit me in the end.

A con is that they won&#39;t take reservations or put your name down while you are driving there, need to be there in person to put your name down.
Now let&#39;s get to the food and service, both fantastic. I got the gnocchi with Parmesan sauce and roasted cauliflower and garlic, I will drive all the way here only for that dish. Mixed green salad was standard fare, bread served up front was fresh and good. One in our party did not like the entree they ordered and the server replaced it with another option without any issues.

I use to work at the Ye Olde Curiosity shop so the decor in here reminded me of it. I love and hate that cellphone policy because when our server came by to drop off the house salad. He told us to put our phones away, his tone of voice was very rude and not nice. I understand you guys have a little rule but we were actually yelping the restaurant reviews and looking at pictures of the food. 
My friend found a fruit fly in her wine and when we told the same server about it, he was also rude. I had to repeat that she had a fly in her glass 4 times before he walked away. Do you expect her to still drink it with a damn fly in her cup?! I was turned off by this place at that point but we had already put in our ordered. 
We got the risotto balls, clam linguine, the pork, the lamb, and lasagna. I enjoyed the risotto balls the most. Did not like anything else that we ordered. Food was sub par at best. The dishes were either too salty or too flavorless. I&#39;ve definitely paid less for better food and better service at other establishments.. Don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be going back."

It looked delish on tv but unfortunately did not deliver in person. On the positive side, there was no wait at 7pm on a Friday, and the place is quirky and has many interesting features decor-wise. 

The risotto balls as an app had a lot of saffron. Covering each bite with sauce helped mellow the flavor but eating without any sauce was not an option. The sauce was good though. 

The side salad came on a very small plate which was unfortunate because it was challenging to eat. Tossing the salad was not an option. I enjoyed the cranberries in the salad but otherwise it wasn&#39;t an amazing salad. 

The lentil soup was overwhelmingly spicy. There were whole peppercorns throughout the entire soup. I&#39;d say 5 bites total were eaten. The flavor was good but biting into whole peppercorns is not good. Visually, you could see whole peppercorns in each spoonful. That&#39;s odd. Why would they dump peppercorns in the soup?? Eek. 

The forest floor frenzy was disappointing. There was something sweet in the pasta that overpowered every bite. I ate maybe 20% of the dish and did not get anything to go (and I normally can finish my plate). 

My friend ordered the elk Bolognese. He said it had nice flavor but he only ate about a quarter of the dish. 

We ordered the tiramisu to go because I didn&#39;t think you could mess that up. Well, I was wrong. It was dry and tasted primarily like whipped cream. Even splitting it, we only finished half of it. 

I didn&#39;t eat anything I would ever order again. I wanted it to be so much better but it just wasn&#39;t. The little Italian place, Salvatore&#39;s, off Roosevelt is soooo much better. I recommend that place if you want good Italian."

The place has a LOT going on on the walls/hanging from the ceilings. My friend called that a nice way of me saying there&#39;s a lot of shhhh here. The server was friendly/nice.

Food: Claim Linguini is one of my go-tos mainly because I love clams. The clams were decently sized and there was a lot of it! To my surprise, it was not a creamy sauce though. It&#39;s a buttery broth. Ok, although it&#39;s all buttery, its still much lighter than a creamy sauce. I ate the whole thing, no problemo, whereas other pasta dishes can be pretty hefty. My friend got the Elk Bolognese. I was skeptical at first because I dont know about eating no elk. However, it&#39;s all ground up in the sauce anyway, so you can&#39;t really tell. It was good! I don&#39;t get Bolognese sauce often, but after this place and the yummy one from Il Corvo Pasta, I think I need to order this more often! 

Prices: The pastas were in upper teens. Hmmm...I think it&#39;s fine.

She rolled her eyes, and just restated the name of the soup. Which was potato something. Being allergic to pork, this was annoying.

The carbonara is amazing. A bit salty to be honest, just a tad. Has a lot of proscuitto and snap peas (!). 

The forest floor pasta with walnuts and mushrooms was a bit bland for my liking, actually needed more salt this time, but my mom loved it and was raving about it. I might have just had a bad batch. 

The fried pork on noodles (forget the name) is tasty too. 

My wife always gets the baked ziti/margarita. Very good tomato sauce, nice portions. If they ever have the spicy ministrone soup - get it! It&#39;s the best broth I&#39;ve ever had. The mozzarella tomoato poppers aren&#39;t great..kind of a weird appetizer that&#39;s sorta like baked moz sticks, but with a steamy tomato. Not my thing."

There are tables and chairs and wheels and a bunch of random stuff all over the ceilings and walls of this place. I took a panoramic photo on my iphone but it does do this place justice. It&#39;s definitely not your average restaurant. We came without a reservation and the wait was about 45 minutes. We decided to wait it out and walk around to see the neighborhood. After coming back we finally got a table. Turns out another group was waiting just as long as we were. So probably count on a long wait for a table when coming here. 

You sit down and their menu is rather simplistic but the ingredients are not. You get some bread with oil and vinegar to munch on while you make your choices. We were driving so we didn&#39;t get any wine even though I really wanted some. We decided to just go straight to entrees and I got the elk bolognase and my girl got the clam pasta. Each entree comes with a soup or salad, I elected for a salad and it&#39;s your average house salad. The entrees come out and the bolognase is your average bolognase but because of the elk it gives it a gamey quality which I like. However the portion is just too small, I wanted more! My girl got the clam pasta and the clams didn&#39;t have any sand in them so that means they were cleaned well and the pasta was cooked to perfection and accompanied the seafood and sauce it came with. 

We also got dessert and we decided on a bananas foster but it was just bananas foster in a cup and ice cream in a cup next to it. It was good but I would have liked a bigger plate or bowl to mix the two together and have both flavors at the same time. The cups were just too small to mix them together. It is a little pricey for the amount of food you get but it tastes good and the atmosphere is pretty wild. I think you pay for the decor and the fact that they serve food here too is a plus. It&#39;s a nice novelty but I don&#39;t think I would eat here regularly if I was a local. When visiting from out of town this is a good place to come. Plus it was on DDD with Guy Fieri which is cool to visit places that were seen on TV. I like that type of stuff."

From the upside down Christmas tree to the bicycle to the plane, you never get bored looking around the restaurant. One of the owners came out and visited our table (they do that occasionally). What a nice, charming man who really enjoys good food and good company. No cell phones are allowed at the table and the wine flows abundantly. Add in some of the best Italian in Seattle, and you&#39;ve got yourself a recipe for a really good time. Everything on the menu is delicious but my favorites remain to be the lamb (in the winter when you need something fatty to warm you up from the inside) and the pomadoro (in the summer when you want something light and tasty). These dishes also happen to be a red wine and white wine choice, so needless to say that&#39;s how I usually decide between the two."

After this we had a Carmel whipped cream thing with salted pretzels and two little bear cookies to top it off, it sounds childish, but it had such a mature flavors, a perfect way to top off a literally close to perfect meal. The service was great and the restaurant had its weird twist to it with pictures that make smile. This is by far our new Italian place, amazing, plain and simple with a little quirky twist.

I&#39;m glad I found this place because it was yummy!

From the entrance to the bathrooms, the decor was oddly interesting like the upside down dining table hanging from the ceiling. Some are creepy and some are just too cute. The girls bathroom though, had paintings of dolls that stare and judge you when you&#39;re doing your business. Not to mention the weird radio playing &#34;700 Hobo Names&#34; in the background LOL 

I ordered their Elk Bolognese and I loved everything about it. From the flavor to the wide noodles (which I prefer), every bite was always satisfying. I wish I lived locally to try their other dishes but I know I&#39;ll come back!

Also, I wasn&#39;t phased by their &#34;cellphone surcharge&#34; on their white board The food and company was good so it wasn&#39;t like I was on it anyways (except to Yelp and take a photo hah)"

And this place definitely delivered. The bruschetta was the best part of the entire meal, which isnt saying much. The salad, which we received about 25 minutes after the appetizer was limp. I had the clam linguine, wife had the snap pea. The clam linguine tasted like something that came out of a box, then you add clams bought from the local supernarket. Pasta itself was undercooked and way too much salt in it. Snap pea pasta was also very salty and congealed in about 37 seconds. Wife ate maybe 3 bites and said f this. Also the wait staff doesn&#39;t like to say bye when you leave or check to see if the food is okay. (They prob know their food is freaking shitty) Not that it mattered at that point anyways.

The table was immediately ready for us once we sat down and after drink orders were taken the waitress brought two types of bread with oil. Both were fresh and delicious! 

The clam appetizer comes in a red sauce which I had never tried before  but absolutely loved. Our entrees came out shortly after we finished the apps/bread and everything was amazing. The elk pasta was definitely a hit at our table and my order of lamb shank with garlic polenta was perfect.

The wait staff was brief, short, and prompted us for our order 3 times before i finally ordered an appetizer I didn&#39;t really want just to get the server to leave us alone.

The food was poor in my opinion. We had the clams for an appetizer, which I thought were at best mediocre, and which my date didn&#39;t want to eat. The elk bolognese was really greasy.

The ice cream was actually rather good if a bit generic. It was ironically the best part of a poor meal and the one thing which likely wasn&#39;t made there."

It&#39;s now 2014, so apparently I have a really hard time getting around to trying them AND to writing about them...

The main things I like: The gluten-free pasta option and that they&#39;re a nice restaurant in Wallingford. I lived in Wallingford 2009-14, so it was nice to have a good gluten-free-friendly Italian spot in the neighborhood.

The thing that I don&#39;t love is that I haven&#39;t been amazed by their food. I enjoyed their pasta and other dishes and felt good after eating their food (not the case for some pasta places), but I was never amazed and for some reason kept expecting more.

On my birthday visit (2013), we stopped by after a long and exhausting drive back from eastern Washington, and I thought: &#34;This is a nice enough place... I bet they&#39;ll be fine with us ordering chef&#39;s choice.&#34; I was wrong.

I have a deeply rooted personal problem in which everything listed on an Italian restaurant menu sounds delicious. That being said, I recommend that you order anything/everything here, as I found myself enjoying all items we ordered (and there were quite a bit). Creamy tomato basil soup is a perfect way to start off the food, and is obviously improved by popping open a bottle of red. Might as well splurge for the eggplant parmigiana as well, with fresh mozzarella and perfectly fried. 

Bring on the entrees! Their lasagna is beastly, hearty, and sinfully great, featuring their no-joke &#34;world famous marinara&#34;. Another great option was the Elk Bolognese, with Mama Lil&#39;s Peppers, thyme, fennel, and pork shoulder. (I can&#39;t wait to try Sunday night meatballs!)

The place is sort of tucked away just off of 46th St in Wallingford.  I could have walked right by it and thought it was a 2nd hand store.  It sure looks that way from the door.  Inside is even more eclectic-ness.  There are pictures intentionally hanging crooked, things hanging from the ceiling, like an old tandem bike among others.  You could spend the entire visit just taking in the décor, and still miss something.
 
The staff was really friendly and (being the early birds) we were seated right away.  Josh and I split a half bottle of wine and ordered our dinners.  I elected to go with the Elk Bolognese. I like Elk, so wanted to give it a try.  After our orders were in, we were brought a really great loaf of bread to dip in oil/balsamic vinegar.  That bread was awesome.   The crust was chewy and the crumb was perfect.  I tried not to stuff it down my face...
 
Now, all the pasta at Bizzarro is made in house.  You can tell too.  The pasta that came with my beautifully and thoughtfully plated Elk (parpardelle I believe) was really, really good.  A delicious and silky texture - and the Elk?  The Elk was like sausage, well flavored, a little spicy and not gamey in the slightest.
 
I am going with four solid and confident stars!  Bizzarro is quite a place and, oh, be sure to check out the restrooms before you leave.  I&#39;m talking eclectic on steroids...

Josh: Bizarro Italian Cafe is a brilliant secret in Wallingford. Concealed around behind the Blue Star it hides in broad daylight. With a slightly eccentric exterior, it looks slightly like a hoarder&#39;s front yard. The windows aren&#39;t large, so if you&#39;re casually walking past, you might not notice what hides within. I have walked past this place many times, often curious, but never actually finding out. 

As soon as you pass through the threshold you know you&#39;re in for a treat. The dining room is busy with trinkets and knick-nacks all over the place. I think my favorite was an old rusted tandem bicycle. But that&#39;s only what I happened to notice. It&#39;s the type of place you can thoroughly inspect and still miss huge details that will only become apparent after repeat visits. There are undoubtedly people on their fourth visit only just noticing the old rusted tandem bicycle hanging from the ceiling. 

The charm of the knick-nacks and random brick-a-brack that is Bizarro is not bound strictly to the dining room either. The restrooms are a true experience to behold. I won&#39;t go into too much detail, but if you find yourself taking this place in, definitely visit the restroom, even if only to wash up. It&#39;s worth it.  

And then there&#39;s the food. We were seated and brought menus, water and bread. This bread was absolutely delicious. Textured something like angel food cake with a slightly savory crust, dipped in the traditional oil and vinegar, it could have been an appetizer I might just pay for. I ordered the clam linguini and we split a half-bottle of Cannon Ball cabernet (delicious!). The pasta is made in house, and it shows. The noodles were about as perfect as pasts noodles can get. The clams were in the shell on top of the linguini noodles, and there was definitely enough to have a clam with every bite. 

I really loved this place. Such an unexpected surprise hidden in Wallingford, I have no problems rating a full 5 stars to Bizarro. There is no way I can possibly not go back."

We ordered two &#34;Clam Linguini&#34; the other night. The noodle for both dishes were all sticking together. We asked our waitress if this is normal. She told us that&#39;s the way they cook their noodle so it is normal the noodle will stick together like that. Then, I bit it. Turns out, the noodle was still raw inside. I showed to her, she then agreed to give us another one. (My friend did not want replacement)

Not only the noodle was not fully cooked, but also there were sands mixing in the dish. For the price at $19, I would expect the dish to be done professionally. I mean at least don&#39;t serve raw noodles and make sure to clean sands out of the clams. Not to mention, we had to wait for like 45 minutes to get seats. 

One last thing, those 3 dishes ( 2 original Clam Linguini, 1 replaced) had inconsistent quality. One of the dishes,can barely taste anything and the bacon was cooked long enough, still soft. The replaced dish did taste better with the bacon crispy.

Compare to Tropea Ristorante Italiano in Redmond, Tropea&#39;s Clam Linguini (LINGUINI VONGOLE) is cheaper (at $15 or $16), professionally cooked, and taste good. Not to mention, their bread with their homemade dipping sauce is super awesome.

Overall, I will NOT recommend Bizzarro Italian Café.

I hope this review helps. Thanks."

Though I am not the one who is gluten intolerant in the relationship, one thing that has always been an issue is finding good restaurants to go to together that wouldn&#39;t make her sick. With that being said, we had to try this out as I&#39;m sure once you&#39;re gluten free, you miss your comfort foods like pizza and pasta.

Food:
Pasta is fantastic. You could not taste that the noodles were gluten free as we were told that they were made in house. The sauces were rich and the portions were just the right amount where you felt overstuffed after gorging on way too much pasta. The Forest Frenzy will always be one of our favorites though I would strongly recommend asking or looking over what they&#39;re seasonal specials are.

Atmosphere:
Not what I expected at first, but it has a lot of character. Reservations ahead of time is always recommended as the space isn&#39;t quite your average Olive Garden.

Food is pretty good but everything is heavy and not really Italian; think lots of sauce, salt, and cheese.  I suspect that Guy Fierri had some influence on this."
bizzarro-italian-café-seattle-2,Ali D.,D-eYK-hLGX3m1ooU2X93kg,"Seattle, WA",1,1,0,328,2,ii2hOZ2ZF1PnH_gmzjtYhQ,5.0,2014-04-02,"I will admit, I first stumbled upon Bizzarro not by accident or coincidence but because I saw it featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. I can&#39;t resist a restaurant that&#39;s been featured on TV (even if it was from an obnoxious show) so I couldn&#39;t wait to try it. 

You won&#39;t quite believe this place when you first arrive. Tables hung upside down on the ceiling, strange and random artwork, a tape playing hillbilly names in the bathroom - it is COMPLETELY bizzarro. But that&#39;s just one of the reasons why I love it. Strange, down to earth and oh-so-Seattle. 

If the quirky atmosphere was all Bizzarro had going for it, I would probably still go from time to time but it&#39;s definitely not. The service is personable and friendly, the wine selection abundant and not terribly overpriced, and the food is spectacular. 

What you will not find here at Bizzarro is truly authentic Italian food. What you can expect is fresh, homemade Pacific Northwest inspired Italian food which is just amazing in my book. All entrees are served with a small starter salad that is lightly dressed and sprinkled with dried cranberries and a plate of freshly baked foccaccia bread. 

The clam linquini is to die for, with a light white wine sauce, crisp pancetta bits and made completely unique with roasted jalepeno that adds a lovely smokiness. The Forest Floor Frenzy - wild mushrooms and walnuts melded with a cream sherry sauce and house made parpadelle ribbon pasta - is rich, creamy and earthy. The lasagna is robust, meaty and big enough to feed a family of four for a week. 

But my favorite menu item which shows up seasonally is the roasted garlic cauliflower gnocchi. Imagine an Alfredo sauce tossed with soft pillows of house-made gnocchi, only it&#39;s not Alfredo - it&#39;s a luscious sauce of cream, roasted garlic and cauliflower. It just works and it is heaven sent."

The place looked interesting, and the food looked great, so I know that within my short stay in Seattle, I&#39;d have to make time to eat here.

I started with a Caesar salad, which is without a doubt, the best Caesar salad I&#39;ve ever had.  My entree was a Clam Linguine, which was featured on the show, and also looked excellent.  Though it was pretty good, and had good flavor, I feel like it lacked something and could use some more flavor of some kind... it just didn&#39;t leave me as satisfied I&#39;d of liked.  It was kinda one of those things where you think you&#39;re gonna love it, but when you get it it falls flat, and then you start looking at everyone else&#39;s food around you and wishing you&#39;d of ordered that instead... oh well.  Lastly, I finished with the Tiramisu, as it came highly recommended on Yelp, and was also recommended by the waitress.  The tiramisu I can say, was excellent.

In the end, I&#39;m sure this place is better than my brief exposure to it, so next time I&#39;m around I&#39;ll be back.  For now though, its a 3/5.

It came with a Caesar salad. My friend ordered the special of the night - the kale ravioli and the bite I tasted of hers was way better than my dish.

Especially given the prices, you just can&#39;t beat this place. Only possible drawback is the wait for a table.

Foremost, they know the typical weaknesses of the average decent restaurant, and they avoid them. It&#39;s very easy to turn out a nice menu of dishes with explosive flavor if you goose the hell out of everything with butter and salt. That&#39;s what makes going out to eat such a treat, and one of the things that makes it hard to duplicate the showiness of restaurant food at home. One mark of a great place is consistently producing spectacular food all across the menu without layering everything down under butter, cream, and sodium. Bizzarro knocks their whole menu out of the park on this pitch.

But before you even get there, you notice how cool the place is. It&#39;s all shoved in together with bric-a-brac everywhere; gigantic chandeliers and recycled signs and christmas trees nailed to the ceiling upside down and on and on. No tables match, no chairs match; you can leave little notes and pieces of paper under the glass tabletops if you want. The staff is clearly having fun, and they&#39;re incredibly charming and relaxed and in command at all times. They know the place cold and can handle anything.

The menu is short--half a dozen apps, a couple salads, half a dozen entrees and three meat dishes in a sort of chef&#39;s choice section. There are usually a couple specials. My mom had the elk bolognese, my sis had the angel&#39;s hair bombastico something or other, and I had the papardelle with mushrooms. All of them had great texture and tons of harmonious flavor. We started with the drunken clams, which were immaculately prepared, all open, tons of flavor in the sauce and in the bivalves themselves. The focaccia was perfect for mopping up the clam sauce. The starter salads were fantastic, especially the caesar. 

The wine list has a bunch of nice Italian stuff, but we didn&#39;t get anything. They pour wine in little half tumblers, which makes you feel all the more like you&#39;re at a great little corner Italian place that stitches the neighborhood together. They really have it nailed here. Never get tired of this place."

The sitter bailed last minute so we brought the 19 month old daughter and arrived just after 9 PM for dinner.  The staff entertained my daughter and my daughter entertained the staff while we were deciding our dinner.  We went with Uncle Guy&#39;s recommendations of elk bolognese and linguine with clams.  Both were spot on, especially the elk.  It was served with a homemade pappardelle that was perfect.  We had some Washington Chardonnay too that was beautifully crisp (we were visiting from CA).  My daughter opted to save her meatballs for tomorrow since it was essentially her bedtime.  When packing up the food we received a tiramisu on the house to enjoy in the AM.  The staff was so friendly they even gave us a bag of ice for my wife&#39;s injured foot and even the let us keep the Bizarro pen as a souvenir.  Hard to say we will not be back next time we are in the area."

When you live in the city, your food options are all about what&#39;s walkable, what&#39;s deliverable, what&#39;s good, quick, and easy take-out. Well, Julie&#39;s Garden has checked all those boxes for me. And their pho has become my favorite that I&#39;ve tried in Seattle (so far.) 

Two words: flank pho

That ish is soooo good. Julie&#39;s Garden does pho broth right. Compared to those I&#39;ve tried around downtown Seattle, it&#39;s more flavorful, rich, and complex. I always get a ton of meat, and lots of sprouts, basil, and jalapenos. My only gripe (still) is their thick slices of jalapeno. Thin those slices out, please! 

This family-owned business is a winner. Oh, and I recommend eating your pho there. The rest of the menu is great for take-out. If you come in the late afternoon, you&#39;ll see the owners sit down with their family to eat. That&#39;s a great sign the food here is made from the heart, and is damn delicious."

When I worked in downtown Seattle (mid 90s - 2011) I frequented this restaurant for lunch several times a month. Last time I was there it was in 2011.  TIP: Go early, for lunch cause the restaurants fills up fast.

Yesterday we were downtown doing some errands so we dropped in to one of our old haunts around 2:30 PM.  We were happy to see that Julie&#39;s Garden was still there.  I believe this is a family run restaurant, and believe it or not they recognized us so we chatted a bit.

We ordered two combination lunches -  Hot and Sour soup, Chicken and Vegetables, Fried Rice, Egg Roll  and fortune cookies- Delicious, and even better than I remembered.  The serving portions are large, and ingredients are fresh.
The second combo - Egg Drop Soup,  Kung Pao Chicken, Fried rice, Egg Roll - Also very delicious.  The entire check was less than $20.00!  

Lunch is served till 4 PM  If you are downtown in the Pioneer Square area, this restaurants is a must!"

I had the Wonton Soup because it was a typical rainy, Seattle day. My friend got the Deluxe Pho. Overall, the food was decent and hit the spot. The portions are definitely large and filling. I did think it was a little weird that the Wonton Soup didn&#39;t come with any noodles... it was literally wontons and broth but still good.

I try to go after the lunch rush because it gets so packed and busy in there. I ordered to go from here once during the lunch rush and still got my food in less than 10 minutes.
The waiters are fast and the food comes out faster.
I tried their broccoli beef and Mongolian beef on the lunch menu. All lunch items come with a choose of hot and sour soup or the egg soup. I usually don&#39;t eat the soup cause the food portions are big enough for me and the soup is just eh. It also comes with a egg roll. All for around $8-9. Not bad. 
They also have tv so you can watch while you eat but if its busy..you&#39;ll feel rushed to finish your food.

I managed to get a table for and friend and I.  Nothing really special to say about the decor, I wouldn&#39;t have gone here if it weren&#39;t for the reviews I&#39;ve seen of this place.  My friend got the L-11, Mongolian Beef and said it was mediocre at best.  She asked for five stars and it wasn&#39;t that spicy, she also mentioned it wasn&#39;t &#34;authentic&#34; and tasted like it had MSG.   

I purchased the Deluxe Pho and I would say for a Deluxe Pho (Meatballs, Meat, Tripe,Flank)  $9 isn&#39;t bad.  One thing I did like about the Pho was how hot it was (I typically like my Pho piping hot).   Other than that, I would say the Pho is above average, definitely better than Pho Cyclo Cafe close by but not as good as Pho Than Brothers.

Personally for me, I would make the jaunt to another Pho joint in the International District or Long&#39;s Provincial any day of the week."

We walked until we found Julie&#39;s Garden. It was open and we were seated right away. We both ordered a Tsing Tao beer and our pho. My guy ordered the Rare Beef Pho and I ordered the Spicy Seafood Pho. I love both spicy and seafood, so it was a perfect choice. 

The pho was really comforting and delicious, the restaurant had great service and we were happy to be warmed up coming out of the cold. I&#39;m actually glad that we discovered this place after finding two others to be closed. It was the perfect pho lunch."

Location:  Pioneer Square

Inside:  Several tables inside, more of an eatery.  

Food:  Mongolian beef were good but the surprise dish was the Mandarin Boneless Spicy Chicken.  For reals, I would come here just for that.  Similar to Peking Chicken taste (for those Korean Chinese food lovers).

Value:  The dinner special was a great deal that offers:  soup, appetizer, rice, and main entree.  

I know they offer Pho as well but did not try it.

If I worked or lived closer, I would probably frequent more to try the different menu items for lunch and dinner.

Staying at the BW in the same building, we wanted a quick and easy meal after a long walking day on  Bainbridge Island.

The premises are clean and attractive; the family members running it were polite, attentive, and eager to please. It is painful to write this review but after 2 days on the fence, I feel it&#39;s better to share these thoughts even if it takes food out of the family&#39;s mouths. 

We ordered 2 of the dinners and a Kirin while waiting. The beer was delivered promptly and was cold. 

The egg roll was of average size. However, it was virtually empty of filling, just a few shreds of cabbage and carrot. After one bite I looked inside and could see clearly to the opposite end. There was a suspicious appearance and taste of congealed fat. The fried shrimp had not been fried very recently but the taste was OK.

The hot &amp; sour soup was highly gelatinous, slightly peppery-hot, and vinegar sour. The fungi were acceptable, but less than abundant. 

The fried rice was done well enough.

One of our dinners was shrimp and veggies, which were both unevenly cooked and swimming in an unpleasant-tasting brown sauce. Ample use of Chinese hot mustard got me through the shrimps and some of the veggies; the brown sauce was so clingy it was difficult to get the mustard to adhere.

This is all I can manage to detail. I bailed on my dinner and was alarmed enough to forbid my wife (I&#39;m writing this on her travel Mac) from finishing her order. We suffered indigestion through the next day. Ironically, that was spent in the ID and we would have wanted to try several places there. In fact, the ID is so close why not find a Cantonese place there? Even the hot tables and the Thai place at Uwajimaya looked a lot more palatable. The large $1.89 tempura shrimp I definitely would have bought but my insides were so unsettled."

The place was a quick walk from where I was and had a cheap lunch menu. I had the Mongolian beef at a 5-star spicy level. The beef was not spicy at all and instead kind of sweet. It also tasted like there was quite a bit of MSG in the food.

Overall, the food was decent. The restaurant was clean and the hostess was very friendly. The service was good. I probably won&#39;t go back because of the sweet MSG food, but for those that don&#39;t like spicy, it is probably right up your alley."

We came in on a Saturday afternoon after the Underground Tour.  Since we were a group of 4, we were given a free eggroll appetizer - nice!  Their lunch specials are around $7.50 and come with a small cup of soup, an eggroll, and rice and include chicken, pork, beef, and vegetarian dishes.  However, most of us got dishes that weren&#39;t lunch specials.  I had the chicken vermicelli rice noodle bowl, which was very flavorful and refreshing.  My fiance loves their chicken pad thai (a 3 is pretty spicy here!).  He used to get it all the time when he worked in the area.  

The one thing of note is make sure you are very clear with what you order.  My sister tried to order a lunch special dish.  When she asked if she could change her soup from hot and sour soup to wonton soup, they thought she wanted to change her whole order to won ton soup so somehow she ended up with a giant bowl of soup (for only $6.50, but still) when she had wanted a beef lunch special dish!  Oh well!

Overall, good affordable flavorful quick food!"

We ordered the spring rolls, pho and shrimp pad thai. All of the food was decent. The pho was a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. 

A couple of things about the service. When we asked for spring rolls, the waitress gave me 2 spoons and a napkin, while my friend got a spoon and a fork. Alrighty then. Then the waitress randomly took away the soy sauce from the table. It wasn&#39;t empty or anything. Lastly, they started playing Christmas music but with Asian instruments. I&#39;m not complaining about the music. Who doesn&#39;t love Christmas music?!

It was a wacky experience with good food. It&#39;s definitely a Viet/Chinese restaurant, but I&#39;m intrigued in trying other places."

(Ladies, here is your go-to pho spot for &#34;that time&#34; of the month.) Julie&#39;s Garden is the place to go if you want pho, FAST. Try the spicy chicken pho! It&#39;s actually not spicy at all, but the flavor is wonderful. Who would&#39;ve thought that tomatoes, pineapple, and celery would be sitting in your bowl of pho? But who cares? It&#39;s delicious. Reminded me of &#34;stone soup&#34; from back in the day.

Given it&#39;s a restaurant in downtown Seattle, you&#39;ll be paying $7-9 for pho, but the service is super fast, the soup is hot, portions are great, and staff are friendly.

Not quite 5 stars because there was a spot on my napkin and because the spicy chicken pho was not spicy at all. (If I were craving a SPICY dish, and got this, it wouldn&#39;t have hit the spot. Luckily, I was famished.)"

Kung Pao Chicken 
Broccoli Beef

That said, Julie&#39;s Garden made a nice compliment to our recent monthly team meeting.

Service:
I called one day ahead of time and asked if the food could be delivered by 11:30, and it was in the office by 11:20! Impressive.

Food/Flavor:
It&#39;s not gourmet, but it&#39;s decent. I was a fan of the mongolian beef and the sweet and sour pork, which had just the right amount of flavor. The hot &amp; sour soup was extra spicy (which I liked, though I know it&#39;s not for everyone...). And the broccoli chicken was somewhat sweet, which I thought was surprising. Wasn&#39;t my favorite, but wasn&#39;t bad.

Price:
Reasonable. Being Seattle you can&#39;t expect the prices to be too low, but with tip and delivery surcharge we fed our staff on $60. I&#39;m fine with that.

My only tip for group delivery is that they package individually, not family-style. One lunch entree equals one takeout box with the entree, rice, and an eggroll.

Anyway, worth a spin if you&#39;re looking for lunch delivery in the area."

Ambiance - Though the decor is cute, the place smells strongly of cleaning chemicals. Plus, near the end of my meal the whole place filled with a rotten smell (maybe a trash bag broke open?) and I had to quit eating and leave to escape. One star.

They are always fast and super friendly when you come in.

The last few times we&#39;ve called, there&#39;s always an excuse of why it cannot be done, i.e, short staffed, no driver, not a good day, etc. Another HUGE downfall and inconvenience is that we have to call in at 10:00am sharp (not 10:03 or 10:05, because that would be considered too late) just to see if they can deliver, and if the answer is yes, we would need to put in the orders asap.

First of all, the combos are good here but will set you back about $8.50 without a beverage. You get a choice of white or fried rice with any combo. They also offer soup and an eggroll with your combo. I&#39;ve tried both soups and dislike them. They were the consistency of snot and flavorless. So I went in and asked for an extra eggroll instead of soup. The teenage girl at the counter said &#34;sure&#34; but the boss lady seemed irritated back in the kitchen when it was explained to her. When I got back to my desk, you guessed it -  no soup and no extra eggroll. The time before they just took out the soup and charged me the same price. 
Now, on to the flavor. The main courses and rice are fine. Im not sure of the quality of my Kung Pao because it gave me the runs 3 times that day after eating.

My coworker has been telling me for weeks to go here, so it was tested today. We ordered a handful of items to try out variety and with a little soy sauce the food was wonderful! The steamed rice was very good as well (its just steamed rice but something good). But the regular fried rice-not that great. The spring rolls were disappointing as they had minimal &#34;stuffing&#34;. The best thing we had was probably the Specialty Fried Rice (again, once soy sauce was added it was awesome). The portion was huge and there was an expected amount of meat added-they didnt skimp on it. 

For the spicy menu items they have a five number range; their &#34;#5&#34; spice wasnt that hot. I would suggest you dont drink the water either-but thats just me.

The service is wonderful and friendly."

The people are always very nice, even during peak lunch hours, which is difficult to do. They are consistently packed during lunch hours and just bang out the dishes. The food here is always consistent, but just isn&#39;t overwhelmingly delicious. It is never bad, overcooked or anything like that. I think it is because they do such a variety. You can get chinese, thai, and vietnamese. They just don&#39;t do any of them exceptionally.

I like spicy food and they come up a little short when I order something with a chili pepper next to the description on the menu. My favorite things to eat here are probably the broccoli with garlic sauce, rare beef and flank pho, and the fresh rolls. They also make a pretty good thai iced tea. 

Despite saying the food is mediocre, I still eat here about once a month out of convenience."

After my last review I was brought back at the insistence of a coworker, who was positive my last experience was just a fluke. I went back, and it worked out. In fact, returned back about three more times and all was good. Until today. 

I ordered the seafood pho, and like before was good, they have some seriously tender fish balls. However, after returning to work, the stomach started churning. And not just my stomach--a different coworkers stomach who also had the same pho. We both got sick, her worse than I. 

Needless to say, I am disappointed. I only give one star when I get sick-and never go back. And this is why: A restaurants&#39; job is to make *safe* food first, then tasty is second. I hope they clean up their kitchen, as the rest is all already there."

My date had a chicken dish, I had a fried tofu dish with fried rice, had green tea, and we both got egg drop soup. Price wasn&#39;t too bad; it was a bit expensive (just $1-$2), but it was better because I didn&#39;t taste the MSG in the food like I have in other hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurants, so I consider the price difference well worth it.

The servers were attentive and timely, but it was also a bit late on Thursday so we were kind of the only two in the restaurant. Lol.

It&#39;s definitely a good, chill place to come to with friends, coworkers, or if you need to get some grub after a late night drinking/dancing in Pioneer Square. I&#39;ll be coming back again :)."

So far no winners...sad someone help me! I usually eat Asian food in the ID but my office is in the P Square  and I am Asian - so sometimes I just need to eat Asian food lol. 

Decent Asian food for being in the P Square. Their hot and sour soup not to shabby but could have more &#34;sour&#34; in my opinion b/c it was a little bland. I usually just get beef fried rice, but today I got their Mongolian beef (i like it spicy) and not too bad. It sits on a bed crisp rice noodles and had onions and scallions and you could see the red chili flakes - typical take out Mongolian beef. 

I have had the pad thai here as well - it doesn&#39;t taste like typical pad thai - and I love Thai food so I only get it if I really crave it and don&#39;t want to venture far.

Something so rich from the orient that it could only be sold in this historic area of speakeasy&#39;s past. 

Well, I can&#39;t say I was overly impressed. Service was A+ and the food was a solid B and I plan to return, but  overall it was just slightly above average. Now, if it wasn&#39;t for all the over the top reviews I might be telling you about this little bistro that could, but in the end the 5 star reviews are just inflated in my opinion. 

Hot and Sour was good, but lacked kick and zip. They didn&#39;t have hot oil, so I splashed some soy sauce on it and it came back from the dead. Mongolian Chicken was way to sweet for my taste, I like more of a rustic heat with a seared seasoning. This was like Chinese food from a teriyaki camp. 

I&#39;ll go back for potstickers and Almond chicken, but this is not a destination place. Would love to have one on my block, but would never drive a half hour again just to sample it. 

Recommend this as a decent place for a good hot plate, but nothing near hall of fame."

BUT i made an acception because of work.  They often order from Julies and I see that they offer pho, because i LOVE pho so much i thought it cant hurt to just give it a try.  I usually stick with chicken pho just to be safe and boy i havent been disappointed.

Lets be honest though, their pho isn&#39;t the greatest and it&#39;s not the most authentic version of pho that i&#39;ve had BUT (yes, another but) it&#39;s decent for what can be delievered.  I always ask for the chicken to be stir fried because it adds a little bit more of a taste to it.  *drools* just thinking about the pho is making me crave noodle soup.

Last week after a long  work shift of standing on my feet, bf was still at work so I decided to get some takeout. After checking out Yelp, I saw Julie&#39;s was super close and they had pretty good reviews so I stopped in. Typical Chinese restaurant decor, nothing too out of the ordinary. I was greeted by who I think is the owner, a small, young-ish Asian woman. Reaching the counter, a young girl asked for my order ( I think she was a daughter and they were teaching her how to use the register). They have great dinner deals where you pick your entree and you get rice, an egg roll and fried prawn. I also ordered steamed pot stickers because it&#39;s been awhile and it sounded sooooo good. 
I ended up getting the chicken curry level 5 in spicy. The wait was about 10 minutes, during which another daughter, a bit older this time, came out and told me my pot stickers had been lightly fried on the bottom, the cook had been frying them all day and misread the ticket. She asked if that was okay or if I wanted a new order, but I&#39;m an easy going patron and was totally fine. Then the owner came out and apologized again, and I reassured her that it was totally fine. They threw in an extra fortune cookie( that tasted house made, yum!) because they still felt bad. 
Anyways, getting home, the pot stickers were super good. Great texture inside and out, I&#39;ll have to try them just fully steamed next time to really judge. I&#39;m not a fan of the sauce they gave me on the side, too sweet for me. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the fried prawn at all, batter was bitter like the oil was just about at the end of the rope, and the prawn itself was butterflied but kinda tough, almost stringy. The egg roll was veggie, which i like, but again, that oil taste kinda spoiled it for me. The rest though, the rest was great. Rice, cooked well, a nice mound that I ate half my curry with. My taste buds are broken so even the extremely spicy is not spicy enough for me, but the curry was still good. The perfect consistency of curry for me, thick enough to coat each grain of rice but thin enough to soak all the way down. Nice big cut veggies with great flavor, chicken cut in kinda an odd, flat shape like a bias-cut but so tender! Maybe the most tender chicken I&#39;ve ever had. I saved half my curry for the next night and made more rice, the curry reheated well on the stove top.
Overall, the price is good, you get a lot of food and their service is amazing. Some of the nicest people in a restaurant I&#39;ve encountered. I will definitely try Julie&#39;s Garden again sometime, just hopefully the oil will be more fresh. Then, I&#39;d give 4 stars."

I got the deluxe pho. You can take pho out for 50 cents more and they pack it really well. However, but I would recommend you just eat it in the store. The broth they give you is so hot (well needs to be hot to cook the raw beef) that the plastic containers could become deformed at the heat. Overall, the service was fast and friendly.

Yesterday I decided to break from my usual and get the Spicy Chicken Pho.  What a surprise this was!

In addition to their excellent pho broth and 2 types of onions, cilantro and noodles that&#39;s in this soup was well chicken of course, and nice big pieces of it, cauliflower that was a little al dente (perfect for me), celery, tomato wedges, and what appeared to be some chili oil added to the broth.

The chili oil is very clever as it stays on top mostly, and forces you to drag pieces of vegetable, noodle or meat through it on the way out of the broth, sufficiently coating each piece in a wonderfully spicy addition to the already excellent flavors.  It&#39;s not so hot that it doesn&#39;t taste good either.  This is not a dish to dare your friends to eat but one to enjoy when you want something a little different."

I understand it&#39;s not their main event, but the veggie broth is pretty light on the flavors.

Vegetables rotate, always celery, onions and carrots, then either broccoli or bok choy.  Firm tofu, fried as a block and then cut or sometimes cubed and then fried. Decent texture there. Veggies were cooked well, still a bit crisp. Nice amount of onions, but nothing exciting

It was delicious , sweet , tasty with peas , carrots and eggs! Man was it yummyyy!!

Fast food-style, friendly service, enclosed patio seating that is not so nice during the cold months, clean restrooms, freshly roasted chicken, generous sides, overall decent quality. 

Each plate comes with 2 sides, one sauce, and a tiny cornbread. You can buy extra sauce for $0.45 each. My fiancé and I each had a quarter white meat this afternoon. For sides, I selected yellow rice and garlic green beans. My sauces were the green sauce, which was minced jalapeño and garlic, and their house spicy sauce, which was not on the menu. Fiancé chose the yellow rice with beans and herbed veggies -- looked like sweet potatoes, beets, carrots. He had the tangy mustard sauce and the house spicy sauce as well.  

My fiancé raved about his meal throughout but especially loved pairing his chicken with the house sauce. He didn&#39;t like the tangy mustard sauce too much, although I actually enjoyed that one the best. He loved his veggies. 

I thought it was all just okay. I was particularly excited about the green sauce, but it didn&#39;t turn out to be that special. The cornbread was moist and flavorful, though, and I should&#39;ve asked for two! The yellow rice was dry, but I liked the garlic green beans. They were crunchy and sufficiently soaked in garlic sauce. 

It&#39;s definitely the Peruvian chicken joint to hit up when you&#39;re hungry because you get your food right away, but I&#39;d rather wait a bit longer for better-flavored roasted chicken at San Fernando Roasted Chicken several blocks up in the Central District. Big Chickie has more sauce and side options, but SFRC gives you a much more authentic experience, hands-down, for comparable prices."

I finished shopping at PCC and on the way home I saw Big Chickie.  Good thing I stopped by because the food was amazing!  Yummy cheesy potatoes.  The staff was really friendly.

The sides were alright, but again, barely even room temp. I ordered a &#34;quarter chicken&#34; and was shocked when I saw how small the serving was. Frozen chicken breasts from Costco are bigger than the &#34;quarter chicken&#34; they dished up for me. 

Oh and the corn bread! WTF?! They are little chicken nugget sized pieces of corn bread that they keep in the plastic bin by the register and they don&#39;t even give you butter. Actually, that doesn&#39;t really matter because they are stale and cold! 

The outside seating is kind of cool, until you sit down. I have no idea whose awesome idea it was to use chairs that have a hard metal point right in the middle of the back-rest of the chair, but they should not be allowed to make any decisions ever again. Seriously. That chair actually hurt when I leaned back before realizing the fatal design flaw. 

Basically, I&#39;d only eat here again if my judgement was impaired by alcohol and had no other options.

I must say that their chicken has a nicer roast aroma (charcoal instead of gas) compared to San Fernando and I love it! I could taste the spice a little bit more and it was seasoned very nicely. However, I was not impressed with their side dishes. Their green sauce that came with the chicken was overly sour and not spicy at all.

The place is clean and neat, with a covered patio to eat any time of the year. I also like the fact that they have their own parking lot in front. 

Since this was our first time here, we just went with a basic whole roasted chicken, with cheesy potatoes and kale slaw as our sides. Admittedly, we got it to go, so it wasn&#39;t as hot as if we ate it there. Overall, the chicken was decent, but definitely on the small side. The cheesy potatoes were really good, but the kale slaw was on the dry side (needed more dressing). The order comes with some cornbread as well, which were good. They offer three different sauces, with the creamy mayo-like one being my favorite of the three. 

Overall, while being decent, I think think it is overpriced (small chicken with two sides and cornbread came to a little under $30 after tax). My preference for Peruvian chicken would still have to be San Fernando, though."

Staff is courteous and prompt. Always helpful. The menu has slowly evolved and expanded for the better. They are fine tuning this cuisine you can tell. From the cheesy potatoes to to the kale salad, they have something for you. The sweet potato side is the best, in my opinion. Just really unique. A wide range of sauces to use as well. 

My only problem with Big Chickie is the bee problem. It&#39;s more of a seasonal issue, but with the &#34;outdoor&#34; seating, if there are bees around, you will get dive bombed by these bees. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just me, but I have been dive-bombed on 3 occasions, so much so that I had to pack up and leave. It was just too dangerous. So, I just get it to go from now on. I think they are aware of and trying to do something about the bees, it just doesn&#39;t seem to be working as we were again dive-bombed by 3-4 bees last weekend."

We were debating wether to get a half chicken with the 2 large sides or 2 of the managers special. We opted for the managers special but regretted it. The portion was small and the chicken was dried out, no flavor and cold. Tasted like leftover BBQ from 2 days ago. The choice of sauces they give you have very little amount in them. The sauce was very bland like as if they smashed up some bell peppers, added some salt and called it jalapeño sauce. And OH MY GOSH, can we talk quickly about the corn bread? It was so tiny like the size of a chicken nugget. It was also stale and nasty like it&#39;s been sitting out for 4 days. The beans and rice were very plain as well. I went to culinary arts and I cannot believe this place is still in business. The only thing that was good was the drinks."

Served cafeteria style, you selected your cut/amount of chicken (1/4 white, 1/4 dark etc.) two sides and a sauce, and they throw in a mini cornbread muffin along with it. What&#39;s great about this place is that their sides rotate with the seasons (stuffing and gravy for fall yummmm) and their chicken is ALWAYS moist and beautifully seasoned. 

My current fave is to do 1/4 white with cheesy potatoes, kale apple slaw and the mayo mustard sauce on the side. 

It&#39;s also a very fun place to hang out when the weather is nice, they have a very cool patio area where you can sit outside and enjoy a beer with your chicken.

No, I am not quoting John Buccigross from ESPN.  This is on each napkin holder in the restaurant.  So what do I do for my first meal at Big Chickie? Eat lunch.

Then when I ordered, I skipped the traditional chicken and had one of the lunch specials - curry chicken salad sandwiches.  On the whole, the sandwich was good.  It had a little more slaw on it that I would put on it, but the curry chicken salad was very good.  Had the rice and beans as a side and it was tasty, but not anything special.

I usually get the half chicken, white meat. The skin is crispy and perfectly charred and the meat falls off the bone.

My favorite part might be choosing the sides. They rotate some in and out and I feel like there&#39;s a new one each time I come. I&#39;m fond of the pasta salad and cheesy potatoes. I&#39;ve also enjoyed the kale salad.

And for the love of God, get the yellow sauce. Dip the chicken in it. Slather the chicken in it. Pour it on your sides, or in your mouth. Whichever way, it&#39;s heaven.

The in-house hot sauce is great, too, but I don&#39;t recommend pouring it in your mouth.

It&#39;s such a casual and awesome place, whether you get it to go or sit outside in their covered seating area.

Plenty of parking in their lot or on the street. Just a block down from the 7/9 bus stop at Orcas.

Highly recommended."

First, they have a parking lot, which is awesome. Second, if parking is full, there&#39;s plenty of street parking. Their outdoor seating is made indoor by clear plastic and temp-wise was plenty comfortable; well-lit to look warm and inviting from the outside.

The SMELL when you walk in is as incredible as everybody says. Wow, I love it when my mouth waters and I haven&#39;t eaten tried the food yet. 

You order from a large board with the Peruvian chicken being the main protein option. I ordered a large half chicken and it looked like a standard bird to me. I imagined that their small half chicken must look like a pigeon. [It] comes with two sides and small cornbread muffins. They heap in a generous serving of the cheesy, salty hashbrown potatoes. Comfort food all the way.

The kale salad was really good! Carrots, edamame, golden raisins..I was feeling it. The lime sweet potatoes were as good as I hoped. Citrus and sweet potatoes are wonderful together and the lime offered an unusual and tasty punch. 

So why not 5 stars? The chicken definitely had the Peruvian seasoning thang going on, but the chicken itself was not a great quality. It was greasy, which I associate with a less than optimal grade of chicken, not so much the cooking preparation. It was okay, but it&#39;s not as good as San Fernando. 

The mayo mustard sauce for the chicken was alright; I preferred the jalapenos side - to cut through the chicken. The red onions in lemon juice accoutrement...that alone made me say mmmmm. So good, I&#39;m going to make some of my own at home. Try these guys out; I know for sure I&#39;ll be back!"

We ordered the half chicken with 2 large sides: cheesy potatoes and corn salad. Portions appeared small but it was actually perfect for 2. But let me just repeat, cheesy potatoes. So creamy. Simply amazing. Cornbread muffins ain&#39;t nothin to write home about. And I was disappointed with the sauces.

I love a good chicken. It&#39;s often easy and hard to mess up a good roasted chicken. When I do find the right spot that gets it right, I&#39;ll stick to it like a magnet. And to top it off, it was Peruvian chicken? Sign me up!

I came here on day five of opening (a month ago). It was still summer-ish and still pleasant outside. They are kind of the end of the restaurants strip on Columbia City. They have their own parking lot. It&#39;s a cute spot. The tent outside was well lit up and pretty. The space itself is bright and open. You come in, check the chalk board menu and order!

You can get the beautiful chicken aroma as you park. Hmmmm. You get two sides with your order. I got half a chicken with sweet potatoes and kale with corn salsa and cornbread. They were out of the rice. Hmmmmm! They also have wine and beer for purchase for around $6. Not bad at all.

A few minutes of picking and viola- I was ready to eat my meat~ Yummm. We sat outside. It was pretty and pleasant. The corn bread was so tasty. I love the sweet potatoes and kale. So delish! And the chef even gave us complimentary brownies to take home. YUmmmm!

Now the verdict for the chicken- it was small, bony and a ok. Not as flavorful/tasty.  I usually get full fast but this one, I wasn&#39;t even after half a chicken. I also didn&#39;t quite like the taste or the texture of the bird. I feel it was moist and dry at the same time.  I like all the sides though. And that brownie was pretty amazing. I have had much better Peruvian chicken in Seattle. This was a ok for me. Perhaps I came too late in the day?They also have sauces for you. Spicy and tangy ones.They were super nice though.I&#39;ll probably try them again if I&#39;m in the area."
big-chickie-seattle,Jens J.,mBruzuCXfVQ3gug8H7EgdA,"Seattle, WA",1,1,0,714,246,KH9PeR7x5ZD32RUuObafVw,4.0,2014-10-22,"Once upon a time, a long long time ago, there was a restaurant in Wood Village, OR named Pollo Loco that served the most scrumptious roasted chicken.  I went there all the time.  It eventually closed its doors (but why?).  Ever since then, I&#39;ve been seeking good roasted chicken.  I did find a Burgermaster in University Village that did serve pretty darned good baked chicken, but the last time I was there, which was recently, they had added five spice to their chicken recipe.  So scratch Burgermaster off the list.

And then, driving home from work earlier this week, I saw the sign in Hillman City for Big Chickie, a.k.a. Pollo A la Brasa (the term for Peruvian blackened chicken).  I had to stop and check it out.  Speaking of Hillman City, it seems the revitalization (a.k.a. gentrification) that transformed Columbia City is now taking place up here too.

In a Portland food pod-like manner, there is covered seating with plastic sheets for walls in front of Big Chickie.  So you can eat-in or take-out.  I planned to take-out.  For a new restaurant, operations seemed very organized.  A good sign.

Yes indeed, Big Chickie serves roasted chicken.  Along with a 1/2 chicken, I ordered the cheesy potatoes, coleslaw, steak fries and cornbread for sides.  At home, I discovered the chicken was very moist and tender.  The cheesy potatoes, made with hash brown-like pieces of potato are dangerously good.  Just the potatoes themselves are a good enough reason to return to Big Chickie!  The coleslaw was excellent - a good mix of vegetables, a little bit creamy and not too sweet or tart.   The steak fries were very good, not salty nor greasy.

So why not five stars for Big Chickie?  Well, even though the chicken was moist and tender, the seasoning mix was not compelling.   It contained a spice that tasted like (sorry to be so blunt) a little like either Listerine mouthwash or the smell of shoe polish.  Having said that, once inside the chicken skin and away from the external seasonings, the chicken tasted fine.

Other than the chicken spice consideration, I can stoutly state that we now have here a worthy alternative to Ezell&#39;s Chicken up on 23rd (and now in Mount Baker too).   However, San Fernando (Peruvian) Roasted Chicken on Rainier provides a very stiff competition to Big Chickie."

We got half the chicken with the kale salad and corn salad. We also got the jalapeño sauce and the onion sauce. The chicken was below par, i actually prefer costco rotisserie chicken over this. The skin was the only thing flavorful but it was not Peruvian flavor at all. The chicken was small compare to a normal chicken, like it was kinda malnourished. The sides were good though, generous portion and tasted pretty good. The sauce was nothing special, the jalapeño was sour and the onion sauce was picked onion, it didn&#39;t go well with anything, you can eat it on its own. The corn bread was ok, i would prefer it warm rather than cold.

The price was ok for what we got, but if we had chosen other sides such as fries, it wouldn&#39;t have been worth the price we paid. Overall, i would only go back for the sides."

I&#39;m impressed that the owners turned a former service station into a restaurant. The ambiance is super casual and non pretentious-- you pick what you want, they dish it out for you, you pay, you sit, you eat. The seating is technically outdoors--the seating area is on pavement next to the parking lot-- but it is enclosed now on the sides with some coverings. There are some lights strung up, which is a cute touch. I bet they will have heat lamps once it gets cold. 

As for the food, the chicken was roasted to perfection. What does that mean to me? The meat fell off the gawddang bone, it was very juicy, flavorful, and the skin was crispy. It was served with two sauces on the side - a spicy jalapeno sauce and a creamy mayonnaise sauce. I wasn&#39;t a fan of either one because I didn&#39;t feel they added much to the chicken; I think the chicken was perfect on its own. For one of my sides, I had the kale salad, which was refreshing. I love that they added edamame and golden raisins to it for extra nutrition, texture, and flavor. My other side was the corn salad, which tasted heavily heavily heavily of olive oil--I will opt for the cheesey potatoes next time. A small corn muffin also comes with every meal. I would have preferred it to be served warm rather than cold, but that&#39;s not such a big deal.  

I was still hungry after we left, so I know to get more than a quarter chicken next time. Maybe a whole chicken?? This is America, after all! Super size meeee!"

There is a slight quibble with the &#34;Big Chickie&#34; name, when the size of these chickens and their parts is not very big at all.  When I saw the leg and thigh portion they were putting on my plate, I almost asked if they were going to add the other piece, until I realized that the two pieces were together in a &#34;quarter&#34;.  The yellow sauce was delicious and  I was glad I chose that one.  The &#34;Quarter Dark&#34; meal at $9 is not a bad deal at all, though, all things considered.

Service was excellent - the two young women working there went the extra mile and were very friendly.  I enjoyed the outside seating, except for the unruly children screaming and running around.  I hate when moms bring their bratty kids to a place like this to ruin other&#39;s enjoyment of their meal.  Not Big Chickie&#39;s fault obviously.

Sides are good.  The little cornbread muffin thing seemed unnecessary, but I enjoyed the slaw.  The thick-cut fries arrived separately in a bag.  They were super-hot and delicious.  My impression is that all the emphasis on sides is meant to compensate for the fact that the chicken servings are kinda small.  How about a three-piece chicken meal with one side?  That&#39;s what people really want and come here hoping to find.  It should be all about the chicken.

I anticipated kind of a no-frills kind of place, but Big Chickie was a lot more slick, upscale, than I expected, much more in tune with the new, gentrified Rainier Valley.  Almost like they hope this is the first of a chain of restaurants.  It had a bit of a chain restaurant feeling.  I appreciated the clean and tidy restaurant, while at the same time wishing for a funkier South American restaurant experience."

Wife and I had lunch at this nice Hillman City chicken shack. Both of us got the 1/4 chicken plates. The dark or white meat options is a nice touch, although dark was out and more not ready yet. Oh well, I guess I&#39;ll have to come back, awesome!

The chicken was packed with good flavor and the skin was crisp and nicely seasoned. The meat fell of the wing and was still moist on the breast. 

A crazy number of side dishes are available. We tried the cheesy potatos, chile glazed carrots, and creamy coleslaw.  The chesty potatos are creamy, cheesy goodness. Using shredded potatos really helps these melt in your mouth. The creamy slaw was on the sweet side, so if you like that which I totally do, it is great.  The chile glazed carrots were a bit soft but the heat was perfect, hit you a second after fist couple chews on the back of the tongue. 

We didn&#39;t try the chicken sandwiches, but lots of other folks seemed be enjoying those around us.

Dining area definitely fast food vibe, built in parking lot with clear plastic roof and plastic retractable walls.  Would be great open air seating in summer. 

If your looking for a good place to get your chicken on this will do just fine."

I was very excited to try it and high hopes and anticipation for it.  We got the full chicken (because we thought the half did not look like enough for two people), the cheesy potatoes, kale salad and the corn muffins.  I thought the chicken was flavorful and moist but nothing really special until being dipped in the creamy curry sauce.  The green sauce was way too limey for our tastes.  

The cheesy potatoes were rich and delicious and the kale salad was nice and healthy but also didn&#39;t wow me.  The corn muffins were quite tasty.  All in all I thought it was a fresh and healthy dinner but nothing really special or that I would order again sadly.

1. The chicken: great tasting chicken. I can see how others felt the flavor could be pumped up a little more, but for me, at least, it was seasoned just right. However, mine looked anorexic---portion size is not the best deal for my buck. I don&#39;t mind paying a premium for food, but at least give me something to chew on!!!

2. The sides: rice, pea salad, and cornbread. All were good and portions were generous, I guess that&#39;s to make up for the smallish chicken I was served. The pea salad, although could&#39;ve used more seasonings, had a nice mint flavor to it which was a good surprise. The cornbread was OK and needed some butter, but to my surprise, this place don&#39;t have butter!!! Whaaat?!?!?! I was told that their cornbread was loaded with butter and don&#39;t need it. You can never enough butter  

Overall: just &#34;meh&#34;. It wouldn&#39;t add this to my rotation unless they increase the portion size of their chicken AND give me butter for my cornbread. That&#39;s two-stars OFF for me."

I was quite impressed.. the bean dip had a hummus quality to it, the chicken was fall off the bone tender, the sides were fantastic, especially the to potato dishes!
The portions were quite generous and the 2 meals with the dip was enough to feed the 4 of us... (the kids are 8 and 6 so they don&#39;t wolf down a ton of food).

Ordering was very easy. We shared a whole chicken (we only ate 3/4 since it&#39;s just my mom, sister, and me), our sides were the cheesy potatoes and pasta with peas.  Our sauces were jalapeño lime and a honey mustard. We also got 4 corn muffins. 
So the chicken was seasoned decadently with a lot of Peruvian flavor. Inside, the white meat was off the bone and soft. The dark meat was very juicy and it really didn&#39;t need the sauce to add flavor! 
The cheesy potatoes, were amazzzzzzing. It was a fresh batch, (she pulled it out from the oven) and she made sure we got the crispy top and the cheesy inside! It was an even balance between cheese and potato. Honestly, the best kind of carbs I&#39;ve had in a while! 
The pasta with sweet peas was your average pasta salad, served cold. Luckily it wasn&#39;t drowned in mayo, but I wouldn&#39;t get again since there are other unique sides to get! 
The corn muffins tasted moist and had great texture. It definitely would&#39;ve been better if it was served hot instead of cold!

The prices were too high. 
The decor is nice in some areas but it&#39;s like they ran out of budget and went with an awful menu board that cheapens the look of their place 100%. I would spend a couple hundred dollars and change that ASAP. To maybe a chalkboard or even a poster. Anything but that cheap amusement park stick on lettering.

I had the half dark meat with the cheesy potatoes and sweet potatoes sides, yes I love all kind of potatoes :)!!! Oh and I had the jalapeño sauce. In my opinion everything was too bland for my taste. Not sure what the hype was about for the jalapeño sauce, didn&#39;t have much flavor to it..just gave a little kick to your chicken. 
I think if the sweet potatoes were all cooked it would taste 100x better! Some of the potatoes were uncooked, crunchy raw taste to it. A few of those bites and it kills your mood to eat anymore."

We arrived here with no expectations and had the people advise us on what to get as first timers.

So we decided to get a whole chicken dinner and split between the both of us and came with 2 sides of you choice. They recommended the Cheesy Potato Gratin a la Huancaína and Monster Kale Slaw...best choice ever! Along with that was the cornbread and 3 sauces of Creamy Yellow Sauce, Fresh Green Sauce, and Salsa Criolla.

For those who are gonna try this for the first time I high suggest the suggestion the people who work there give you. So for the chicken we were told to use the yellow and green sauces together and even though the chicken alone was very flavorful already the sauces gave it that extra punch of awesome flavor. Next was the Cheese Potatoes and the Salsa Criolla which again brought out a spoon full of goodness. Then the Kale Slaw was awesome as well by itself and with the chicken it was even more an adventure with my taste buds. 

So imagine mixing your eating patterns with all those elements along with munching on some cornbread which by the way was very delicious and not dry at all.

Seriously, typing all of this is making me want some now and its only 9am.

My wife and I will definitely be coming back here for more!!

We&#39;ve been driving by this place pretty regularly and kept meaning to stop, and for some reason we finally stopped in last week. I suppose it could have been the Hot Chicken Now sign that reminded me of the Krispy Kreme sign. Mmmm donuts. The boyfriend and I stopped in our way home to grab quick takeout. I was confused by the menu and what sides were available and the guy who assisted us wasn&#39;t super helpful nor friendly [I&#39;ll admit it may be that my midwestern roots sometimes lead to me expect people to fake it a little better]. We ended up splitting the half chicken with large sides and a bag of plantain chips. It came out to just under $25, which I think is a pretty high price for what you end up with. 

The 1/2 Chicken: pretty freaking tasty! Need more chicken. 
Rice and Beans: &#34;the rice was overdone, but the beans were good&#34; - the boyfriend
Cheesy Potatoes: another home run!
Plaintain chips: next time maybe I&#39;d skip these unless I&#39;m eating a cuban sandwich...not that they offer those here. [So I&#39;ll probably go without.]

I&#39;ll admit I don&#39;t have much experience with Peruvian food, but we both enjoyed most of what we got. We&#39;ll probably go back, but not often because we&#39;d spring for the whole chicken [1/2 a chicken is barely enough for 2 hungry people and it wouldn&#39;t be the worst thing in the world to have leftovers] but that&#39;s more than I want to spend on a random weeknight dinner."

Ok, so on to the food.............

Pricing: decent...you get what you pay for...the 1/4 chicken dinner is the best value IMO

The sides:  those cheesy potatoes are a MUST try, but there&#39;s nothing too amazing about the rest (corn salad, corn muffin, coleslaw, fries, etc).

The chicken:  at first sight and smell it seems like this chicken is gonna be bomb AF...but unfortunately, I was a little disappointed by the lack of juicyness and flavor in comparison to San Fernando Roasted Chicken...don&#39;t get me wrong, it was good, but I can say in confidence that I&#39;ve had better...womp womp

Going inside, I felt like I was in Portland - or even Texas. I am a big fan of eating outdoors, whether in a food truck tent setting or simply a picnic. Needless to say, this place definitely gave me that satisfaction on a chilly winter night since it was covered outdoor seating with heat. The menu is very straight forward. They only serve one entree, and that is their chicken which can be accompanied by sides of your choice. Ours were the kale salad, corn salad, and cheesy potatoes. Each order also comes with tiny bite-sized cornbread muffins. 

Chicken - Relatively small, but tender and seasoned very well. They provide a variety of sauces, but none of them really stood out for me. Honestly, the chicken didn&#39;t really need any condiments. 

Kale Salad - Too much acidity. The dressing was a little too overpowering for me, but I did like the raisins for the contrast of flavor. 

Cheesy potatoes - I love potatoes prepared in any way so it&#39;s pretty hard to screw up a potato for me..especially when there is cheese added; I can&#39;t say anything negative about it!

Corn Salad: Refreshing and sweet, great pairing with the chicken.

I think this is a good spot for a quick bite if you want a slightly healthier alternative to fast food."

Three of us split a large chicken and two of us walked away hungry. ugh yeah, i dunno maybe it was a rare day. I will totally try this place one more time and hopefully Ill walk away feeling full.

The chicken tasted really good as expected, the breast was as moist and tender as the thigh, nice charcoal smoky flavor but not overpowering.

I wasn&#39;t crazy about the sides, the corn bread with chunks of sweet corn in it was good but it was served cold.  Maybe that&#39;s a Peruvian thing, I don&#39;t know but I prefer them hot or at least warm.  The corn salad was simple but good, same with the kale salad.  The cheesy potatoes I liked most, good texture with chunks and surprisingly not too heavy.  I didn&#39;t like the yellow rice at all.  It tasted like packets of costco chicken ramen flavoring mixed with rice during the steaming process.  Maybe my own ignorance of what&#39;s actually in it but it didn&#39;t seem to jive with the whole concept of fresh local chicken, seemed highly artificial to me.

Some of the sauces were sold out so we just got the green and yellow.  Green being blended cilantro and yellow being a blend mustard/mayo.  The sauces seemed somewhat an afterthought, the green sauce I can forgive because it&#39;s a Peruvian thing, I had a similar sauce at other Peruvian restaurants and my lack of Peruvian street cred prevents me from accurately assessing the authenticity and quality of the sauce.  The yellow sauce just didn&#39;t seem to compliment the chicken, I dipped some with corn bread but it just didn&#39;t seem to click.  Maybe that&#39;s why the spicy sauce was sold out.

The space is simple and open, might get a little chilly in winter.  They have a plastic drapery that they can slide to enclose the space so maybe not too cold.

A good concept, glad to see more decent yet simple restaurants popping up like this."

 A few notes.  
1. They realy should post their menu for newbies. I had to ask a few times what the options were for sides.
2. Where are the peruvian flavors? No papas la huacannia? No traditional salsas or sided?  I would not have known this was peruvian inspired food if I had not have looked them up online.
3. Offer two sauces with your meals. I paid extra but the pickled onions would have been a nice condiment more so than a sauce.

This outdoor eatery is absolutely incredible and very likely to please your taste buds.

 It is Peruvian style rotisserie chicken(yum!). Incredible seasoning on the skin and very juicy meat. You can order a quarter (white or dark) , a half, or whole chicken. Two sides are included with all chicken orders, but they can be large or small! Yes, love me some sides. 

I tried the cheesy potatoes (if yoy want to taste pure joy then order this) and the corn salad (sort of like a corn salsa/pico de gallo- very tasty!). The corn bread are small (mini muffin size), but sweet and perfect. The sauces are delicious; the yellow sauce is a mustard/chipotle and the green is a jalapeño/lime. 

Now, the brownie, heaven sent. It is a Mexican chocolate dream in solid form. Lots of cinnamon, lots of deliciousness. 

The owner(?) Sarah was a total hostess. She explained the entire menu and gave us her opinion, and then guided us to the order area. Perfect!
The place is an outdoor only seating restaurant and is perfect for Togo orders. You can have a bottle or glass of wine/beer, or bottle of cider. 
This place is wonderful, give it a try.

We were greeted by one of the owners who welcomed us and explained a bit about their &#34;pollo a la brasa.&#34;  This is a marinated, rotisserie-style, very flavorful chicken.  We each had the quarter white with two sides.  He had the cheesy potatoes and rice &#39;n beans; I had the cole slaw and lime sweet potatoes.  All were tasty, as were the accompanying yellow and green sauces.

Prices are very reasonable.  The environment is very casual, family-friendly, and inviting.  This is a great addition to our South Seattle neighborhood.  We look forward to going back soon."

What we&#39;ve done to chicken in this country is nothing short of criminal. With the proliferation of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and chicken nuggets it&#39;s easy to forget that chicken actually has flavor.  When treated with respect and cooked properly it can be a delicious, tasty feast.  Instead, we have raised an entire generation with the expectation that chicken is devoid of  any flavor or texture and that it should be drowned in ranch dressing or buffalo sauce to make it palatable.

Well, true believers all is not lost.  We&#39;re fortunate to live in a town that has some folks that are working hard to provide us with the real stuff - food that&#39;s lovingly crafted with precision and painstaking attention to detail.  These are the business owners that would rather close up their shop than serve something subpar.  Big Chickie in Columbia City is one of those places.  Their charcoal-roasted rotisserie chicken is marinated for 24 hours and when it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s gone.  In fact, they have a red neon sign that reads &#39;Sold Out&#39; when they&#39;ve sold their last chickie.  &#39;Marinated for 24 hours&#39; means a full 24 hour cycle, they aren&#39;t going to compromise here and we&#39;re all the better for it.

Well, the chicken is perfect.  It&#39;s moist and tender on the inside with a golden brown skin that is redolent with the smoky essence imparted from the charcoal fire that it roasted over. They have a yellow and green sauce to complement the chicken, but honestly I felt that the chicken didn&#39;t need any embellishment.  Shelby, on the other hand, thought that the yellow sauce was pretty tasty.  The fact that the chicken was great didn&#39;t really come as a surprise to me. There was a long line to get to it after all and while in that line I got to observe that wonderful rotisserie and breathe in all that lovely aroma.  I felt pretty confident that it was going to be great and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. 

The real revelation here, though, was just how good the sides were!  The cheesy potatoes were terrific! Some of the best potatoes au gratin that I&#39;ve had in a long time.  A creamy, cheesy sauce envelopes tender, shredded potatoes. According to the menu they&#39;re somewhat based on a Peruvian dish called Papas Huancaina of which I&#39;m not familiar with, but that doesn&#39;t matter because these potatoes are delicious in any language! We also went with the black beans and yellow rice which was very solid. I was wavering between that side dish or the corn salad which looked very nice.  The little corn bread muffins were good.  All and all it was a fantastic feast and it was more food than the two of us could handle and, trust me, we tried our best to finish it off."

Well, that&#39;s me in a nutshell during the work week. 

Big Chickie ends up as my go to spot on nights like those. Portions are plenty, enough for leftovers. My go to meal (split between 2-4 people with plenty left over) is the Whole Chicken Dinner with 2 large sides - the Monster Kale Salad, Fresh Corn Salad, and Cheesy Potatoes. My only complaint is the consistency in flavor of their chicken - some nights may require more sauce than others. 

I kind of wished they opened on Sundays and during lunch."

Cheesy potatoes just not enjoyable. The smell and taste reminded me of 1989 school pizza lunch - even my kids wouldn&#39;t eat it.

The food is so-so. The chicken was nice and moist but a little bland. Didn&#39;t like my kale coleslaw or the corn salad and thought both lacked flavor. My mom didn&#39;t like her cheesy potatoes but I thought they were alright, and you could tell they used real cheddar rather than processed. Rice and beans were okay; the beans were better than the rice. 

What really stood out were the plantains. They were cooked perfectly and were crispy an
d sweet, but not to sweet. Honestly, if I hadn&#39;t had the chicken at San Fernando Chicken or La Cocina on Capitol Hill, I would&#39;ve thought it was good. 

They get two stars for the plantains, half a star for the chicken and half a star because everything was compostable except the plastic take-out bag.

If we ever went back, which I doubt we will, I would just get the plantains and some chicken, because that was all I liked."

Tonight was our second trip, and we got there in time to get almost the last quarter of a bird.  I had the 1/4 white plate tonight.  I did prefer the dark that I got a few days before, but you can&#39;t go wrong with the flavors that they get into the chicken.  As for the sides...it is so hard to choose.  We love the cheesy potatoes the best.  Our second favorite was the lime glazed sweet potatoes and then the kale salad.  The coleslaw and fries were also amazing too.  

Grab both the yellow and the green sauces.  I at the green one straight, like it was a mini-salad or something.  So good.  The yellow sauce went with the fries best.  We didn&#39;t try mixing them together yet, but we&#39;ll save that for next time.

All that and a couple of beers makes me a very satisfied customer."

But it&#39;s Boston Market status. My husband ordered the dark chicken meal &amp; I ordered the white chicken meal. Both came with 2 sides, a choice of sauce, &amp; a small muffin of corn bread. The chicken on a bit dry for my taste but was flavorful. The sides I chose was the green beans &amp; cheesy potatoes. My husband ordered the cheesy potatoes &amp; yellow rice (minus the black beans). The cheesy potatoes was a delight but unfortunately the server added the top burnt parts &amp; mixed it in on the plate (which did not taste too good and my son &amp; I had to spit those pieces out). If those pieces weren&#39;t added, I could order a whole plate of the cheesy potatoes and indulge in it as a meal by itself. The green beans were cold side dish, which I was not expecting, and was a green bean side salad. After tasting the first bite of the green beans, I didn&#39;t care too much of it. I didn&#39;t get to try the yellow rice but it was good enough for my husband to eat it all instead of the cheesy potatoes with burnt pieces. The sauces weren&#39;t memorable enough to remember the name of it but they were not needed to eat the chicken meal. If anything the sauces were a tad too highly seasoned that it counteracted the meal. The corn bread--this was perfect--needed to be a larger size than the puny amount given. It had corn bits to it and the right amount of buttery flavor in it. But amount given could be shoved in the mouth &amp; gulp down in seconds. 
Overall, the service was good &amp; the restaurant itself was an experience. It looked like an old car garage turned into a restaurant, which was neat &amp; pleasant to the eyes. Seating is outdoor with a tarp drapery around it. I would not go out of my way to eat there again but if I was ever around the area, I would definitely return for the corn bread &amp; cheesy potatoes (requesting for no burnt pieces to be added)."

I&#39;ve had big chickie a while back and still continue to go there. First let&#39;s start with the food The Peruvian chicken is seasoned well and moist not that dry Costco kind. The cheesy potatoes are literally the best cheesy potatoes I&#39;ve had and that&#39;s saying something. The mustard sauce, to me isn&#39;t that good UNLESS you add the jalapeños with it, so delicious!!! 

Second of all let me tell you the customer service is unbelievably great!! The workers are nice and welcoming. The environment has a very hipster feeling. The parking lot is small but that&#39;s ok street parking is literally next to the place. 

Lastly I believe this place is truly good and not as bad as anyone says it is. But one thing is for sure the price can be a little expensive but I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth it. After all you get what you pay for!"

J and I shared the one whole chicken meal. One entire chicken, 4 corn bread muffins, 1 side of the cheesy potatoes, and 1 side of the sweet potatoes. How does this feed 4 people??? We KILLED it. Everything was absolutely delicious. 

The assembly line went by fairly quickly. Even though there was a &#39;long&#39; line, we got all of our food within minutes. 

I love the outdoor seating arrangement. However, there needs to be more tables and seats! Considering how many people dine at Big Chickie, they definitely need to provide more seating.

I just wanted to update my review because the last couple times I&#39;ve been to Big Chickie have been a little disappointing.  The cheesy potatoes have been so burned on top that it kind of ruins the experience, and the texture suggests they&#39;d been sitting out for too long.

Next when I got home and pulled the chicken out a few pieces were red.  I had ordered a whole chicken. The bone underneath was same way thus chicken not cooked all the way. Side #1 pasta and peas. That was pretty good. Side #2 sweet potatoes. Decent taste however very soft. Side #3 was cheesy (?) mashed potatoes. They were not. They were hard and dry. Pretty bad on them.  The corn bread muffins were edible needed lots of butter to moisten them up. 
I should have known to keep going as at 630 pm was a couple and their son eating. 
Not a big crowd. 
Whole chicken is $27.50. I should have driven another mile and bought two chickens and sides for less than the $35 I spent. You get the idea."

We enjoyed between the two of us (plus little chickie) a half chicken, kale salad, lime sweet potatoes and an order of fries. We could probably have each eaten a half chicken as they are little smaller (likely more legit) but we weren&#39;t starved and had plans to stop for soft serve later on the way home. The meat was juicy, flavorful and had a nice hint of smokey flavor but not overwhelming nor &#39;liquid smoke&#39;.  The sides were great and next time for sure we will order more sides to try. The two sauces we tried were a jalapeno relish and a pickled onion. Pickled red onions were the best and we mixed the jalapeno relish into the ketchup and took it up a whole other notch.   Was the chicken peruvian? Not so sure as I haven&#39;t been to Peru but it tasted just fine, not my abs fabs chicken but a place we will swing by again.

The one bummer were the fries. I think they served us the last of a batch that sat out too long. They were old tasting, I sampled several to be sure. However, they provided us a new hot and fresh order without question, and they were much better fresh. The seating area is an enclosed outdoor space, but for a drizzly January evening it was just fine, nicely lit, had a big heater if needed. Almost everything they serve is compostable and the atmosphere is for sure causal.  The chicken will run out on a busy day and like Krispy Kreme they have their own version of &#34;hot and fresh&#34; sign and also one when the chicken is all gone.... they do take out and I witnessed several orders come and go. Several drink options, of course, I was thrilled that they served bubbly water. :) 

There is a little parking lot next to it, which is great, although there is also street parking in the neighborhood too.  

This was a great place to bring the tot and there was another family there as well, although pretty quiet the night we went."

I wouldn&#39;t say that was the consensus; but as far as I&#39;m concerned, this place was a winner.  The place has its hits and misses, but overall it is a place I will revisit.
You order at a counter, cafeteria style.  There is something about seeing whole roasted chickens stacked and waiting to be cut into...my inner caveman approves.
If you order a meal you get two sides, cornbread, and chicken.  Some of the orders come with an &#34;upsize&#34; option.  I had the half a chicken meal.  The white meat was oh so tender and juicy, which is often not the case with white meat.  Others in the group had concerns about the portion of the dark meat being inadequate; but I attribute that to a better meat source...the chicken is probably not some saline injected robo-meat from a factory farm. Like everybody else, I wholeheartedly agree that the cheesy potatoes are divine.  The beans and rice were not good, so dry &amp; bland.  The cornbread was cute and mini and tasty.  I must reiterate that all of the chicken really was quite tender and juicy.  I can confirm that because I got a supermarket rotisserie chicken a few days after the visit to Big Chickie and it was a flavorless, dry disappointment.  Nothing like a little perspective.  
There is a nice assortment of beers at Big Chickie.  They serve it up local style with beer from Spinnacker Bay on draft.  They have several bottles as well.  Probably wine too.
The seating is cool.  I like the outdoor arrangement.  
It is on the spendy side.  I have heard people tell that price wise, it&#39;s almost better to get the whole chicken meal and have leftovers. 
The service was pleasant.  I had no dealings with the management, but as mentioned earlier there were a few complaints about the portions of dark meat chicken; I mean almost everybody in our group brought it up (to which I say, order the white meat plate...lots more chicken and so good).  Some of our group spoke to the management about it, and ultimately the management/owners comped the concerned...so all&#39;s well that ends well.  
I&#39;m thinking about stopping by on my way home from work and grabbing some chicken."

While some of the other food in the area was decent, none of it so far had made me go WOW. Big Chickie changed that. 

There wasn&#39;t a line when I arrived at about seven at night. The place definitely has curb appeal. The inside of the place is interesting with the seating existing on the blacktop with some heavy plastic(?) sheeting protecting you from the elements. However, as somebody that doesn&#39;t get cold easy, I have to admit that I was a bit cold. If it&#39;s cold out, sit the closest that you can to the front of the restaurant where the heater is. Otherwise, you might be shivering as you bite into their delicious chicken. 

I ordered the quarter of dark chicken with a side of the semi-legendary cheesy potatoes and the kale salad. And a beer. I ordered the creamy yellow sauce and the green sauce. It came with two little cornbread muffins. Perhaps muffettes? 

The chicken? Moist. Tender. Flavorful. You could just taste the grill on them and in a good way. Without the sauces? Absolutely delicious! With the yellow sauce? EVEN MORE DELICIOUS. And the green sauce? I&#39;m a fan, but that yellow sauce. Oh man. I ended up putting that on my muffins, too. I&#39;m weird, but it was really good. 

The kale salad? Fresh. Crisp. Zesty. It was the perfect balance to the cheesy potatoes. 

The cheesy potatoes? Read the other reviews. You might get the impression that a cult is developing around these potatoes. That impression is correct. Even if they are just a big pile of mushy potatoes and melty, warm, mouth watering cheese, they might be the best big pile of mushy potatoes and melty, warm, mouth watering cheese that you can get in Seattle. 

And the beer? While spendy, I do appreciate them having a decent variety of local options. 

All in all, I&#39;ll be back. Again. And probably again after that. And then again with friends."

Hillman City love.

So, we&#39;ve been intently (i.e. impatiently) watching from across the street all summer--while sipping delicious coffee at Tin Umbrella--and finally Big Chickie ~ Pollo a la Brasa is (at least semi-)open!

We were just passing by on our way to a dinner party at a friend&#39;s last Friday evening and saw that they were open. Needless to say, we had dinner twice that night.

What we ordered:
1/4 Chicken Meal (Dark Meat)

It came with a Corn Muffin and two sides. We went with the Steak Fries and the Creamy Coleslaw (both delicious.) Also served with their Yellow Sauce (a kind of mustard aioli) and Green Sauce (chopped jalapeno topping.) Owner Matt swears that dumping the green into the yellow and mixing them is the way to go. :)

I had never tried this Peruvian-style chicken prior to this, so I can&#39;t attest to its authenticity but if I had to ascribe just one word to Big Chickie&#39;s 24-hour &#39;citrus and spice and everything nice&#39; marinated-chicken, that word would be &#39;heavenly&#39;. It was juicy, smokey, tangy, umami-y... So amazing. Seriously.

They have ample parking, with plenty of semi-covered outdoor picnic tables. Their menu is on their website, so check it out (Gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan are detailed there.) They serve their chickens whole, half, or in quarters, with a whole slew of sides. I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re fully open for business yet, so you might want to check out their Facebook page for their daily hours for now.

A big plus: Keeping it local 98118, they have Spinnaker Bay Brewing on tap! :)"

I got there when the sign said hot chicken now and was so excited! Strangely enough though, I was the only one there...the whole time I ordered to the time I left (granted that was only about ten minutes tops). I ordered a whole chicken and three large sides. I had read the reviews that the chicken portion was small so I figured over ordering couldn&#39;t be a terrible idea. I asked the guy how big a whole chicken was and he grabbed one and showed me. I was like eh, wtheck lets just get the whole thing! My sides were cheesy potatoes, kale salad and corn salad. Everything came with four cornbread muffins and I got three sauces (got one of each). Okay, so I get back to work and am sooooo excited to eat everything. For the hot chicken sign being on, this chicken was not hot! It was like lukewarm. That&#39;s one star down. The chicken also looked like it was probably leftover from lunch time cause it was pretty dry too. The sauces didn&#39;t really add much to the chicken so I ended up not using them. Now for the sides...the corn salad was okay. Felt like there could&#39;ve been so more oomph in it. Just felt like something was missing. Kale salad was okay. A lot of good flavors that came together but ultimately too lemony for my liking. Cheesy potatoes though...that was the truth! Mouth full of amazingness! Again though, I think this batch was leftover from lunch because when he was scooping it in to the cup there was lots of burnt patches getting scooped up too (could also taste a little of that burnt potato). The people here are very nice though so that&#39;s another saving grace! I&#39;ll be back to try it again...maybe on not such an off time. Shared the rest with my coworker and he said he really only liked the potatoes also."

We just finished our Big Chickie takeout and are very satisfied. The hubby and I got the half chicken with two large sides (the cheesy potatoes and rice and beans). The meal also came with two sauces and a mini cornbread muffin.  

The chicken was delicious and flavorful. I liked the yellow sauce (which is creamy and mustardy) and my husband preferred the green sauce. We both LOVE the cheesy potatoes, the husband said they were his favorite part! The rice and beans were also great and the cornbread muffin was just enough. It was plenty of food for me, I didn&#39;t even finish everything!

We took our food to go but they do have seating, which is covered with open air but they have plastic &#34;walls&#34; up since it&#39;s starting to get colder. 

We will definitely be back!"

We both ended up getting the Carne Asada street tacos, which was about $8 for 3 of them, while a little pricey it was so satisfying! The service was decent and decor was nice.

Moreover, we had 3 waiters that kept interrupting us to see how we were doing, they should really be more organized because the first time is nice but when it cuts your conversation several times it&#39;s annoying especially when the inside is a bit noisy.

-----

Very disappointed in the food. 

Got the Barbacoa de Cabrito (slow roasted goat), Gringas Oaxaqueñas, pork mole and chips. 

Chips were nice an fresh. Salsa bar (seemed odd to have such in a &#34;classy&#34; bar restaurant) was stocked with forgettable salsa. 

Goat was very tough and largely bland. Pork was also tough, served lukewarm and overly sweet. Mole - I&#39;ve had better from a jar. 

Caddy margaritas were Good. 

Ambiance is bad. Sitting at bar is the best bet. Front dining room has every seat next to high traffic areas. Rear dining room is like sitting in a shipping container - there are no windows. Rear dinning room is also popular with families (this is cool). 

On a weeknight it was about 60% full. Service was fine. 

I don&#39;t get the hype. Sure it&#39;s different than the typical retried beans &amp; cheese enchiladas places. But it&#39;s nothing to write home about."

Decided it was my top pick to celebrate for my birthday. Booked a reservation for 12 people. We were seated at 7, however, our waiter didn&#39;t take our food order until 8pm. He brought us drinks and we said we were ready to order and he left. After an hour I got up to go find out waiter and asked him to take our order. He finally came to our table, took our order, and our food came 30 min later nice and cold. One of my friends waited 45 for a beer, very disappointing. When I made our reservation they have a one check policy and 20% gratuity is included in the check. We asked our waiter to make sure and he said &#34;no, tip is not included.&#34; I knew that was wrong so we asked one of the managers and they told us it is included. So we paid our check and left. We waited outside for our uber to pick us up when the waiter followed us outside and asked me where his tip was. I was baffled. We had a check that was over $400 and 20% was already included and he was asking for more money after it was a terrible dining experience. I would be horrified as a restaurant to have the waiter follow the paying customers outside asking for more money. Will honestly never go back."

The cocktails are excellent. I had the Michilada (nice and spicy, one of the better Michiladas I&#39;ve had and certainly the best I&#39;ve had in Seattle so far) and one of the Mezcal cocktails that I can&#39;t remember the name of, though I do remember it had tamarind in it. Good stuff. My friend got the sangria, and that was underwhelming. Skip the sangria.

I ordered the red pozole, and I loved it. Guys, I&#39;m a pozole snob after having eaten delicious homemade pozole for years, but this place gets it right. It&#39;s got a kick too, which I appreciate. The tacos looked good too, though I didn&#39;t try any.

Tortilla chips and guac was good, though not too memorable. I ended up eating a bunch of the chips without the guacamole. I think I prefer my guac more avocado-y than what was given to us.

The servers and host were super nice, as was the bartender, though it was a very busy Friday night and she looked like she could use some backup. Because of that, the drinks did take a little longer than they should have to come out."

But then my dinner was brought out LONG before my dates which is frustrating because I was almost finished with my food by the time he got his! But the most frustrating part of the whole thing is we waited for 20 minutes for his carne asada plate only to find out it was basically a piece of beef jerky. It was the thinnest piece of meat I&#39;ve ever seen and just as chewy and dry as a piece of drehydrated meat. He always gets the carne asada and it has never been so depressing!

The bar is about the best seat in the place. Comfort was not the primary focus when they created this place.

Instead of higher prices, they opted for smaller portions which is fine with me. But if you&#39;re looking to get filled up, this might not be the place.

The guac is decent. Nothing noteworthy. The mole is great; on the sweet side which I prefer. I had the enmoladas which were very good, even if a little over-moleed (not a word, I know). I&#39;ve wanted to try the tamales, but they are always out of them when I&#39;m there.

They carry Victoria which is a huge plus and they are open until 11pm which is another plus. Worth a visit."

Simply amazing flavor. Co-pilot ordered the chicken tacos and again, flavor, spice, and craft cooking were on display

The combination of their authentic preparation with the lively atmosphere has made it a winner in my books -- before they expanded...and sold out.

Now, this place has jumped the shark.  Previously, they served a very delicious halibut fish taco which was pan sauteed to perfection (as is still listed on the plain paper menus which they&#39;ve failed to update).  That&#39;s not what you get though -- instead you get a beer battered and poorly deep fried fish nugget on a taco, which you could get for $10 less up the road at Rancho Bravo.  Mole Negro?  Nope, that you can only get on the pork, the chicken now served with what I can only describe as marinara with peanuts and spice.

Oaxaca, you are serving as a very clear example of getting too big for your damn britches.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, these types of tacos are amazing, but you&#39;ve failed to live up to your heritage and what made you special.  I&#39;ll have no sadness if you close down."

He took our drink orders and then didn&#39;t deliver them in full (my beer was missing) and our food came before the chips &amp; guac.

Instead, he brought ONE glass of water just for her! Everyone needed water! Der!! Lastly, my beer came literally with the check.

I ordered the barbacoa de cabrito (braised goat), which said that it came with a side of black beans and corn masa. I&#39;d never had a side of corn masa, but was expecting some kind of corn pudding or something like that. The goat itself was pretty tasty, and came with two delicious tortillas. The beans were non-existent (maybe half an ounce of black bean slurry), and the corn masa was another slurry of masa chunks in a flavorless liquid. Pretty disappointing overall. 

My friends ordered the enfrijoladas, which came with thin steaks that were very well-seasoned and very well prepared, but the tortillas (they which were supposed to be enfrijolados), just had a thin layer of bean sauce, and very little cheese. 

Probably the least impressive part was the service. The restaurant was only half full, but we seemed to wait a long time between ordering drinks, appetizers, and main courses. I found myself thirsty at the end of the meal, and realized that the waitress never refilled my water glass. When the bill came, we were charged for 4 margaritas when we only ordered 3.

We were walking up Queen Anne and they were opening their doors for the night and the girl smiled at us and greeted us as we walked by so we said, sure, why the hell not. 

This is one of the best Mexican restaurant in Seattle. 

It is a small, literal hallway. The menu is short, seasonal and very concise. there is no five-paged menu, just a list of things they do best. You get some hot chips and guac, they point in the direction of the salsa bar and you are left to choose. 

This is a place pushes the boundaries of what you know about Mexican cuisine. Oaxaca is a southern region of Mexico, so there was a lot of twist to dishes I had never seen before. The tamales had mole sauce and was wrapped in a banana leaf and sweet and savory at the same time. The star of the show though, was the Pozole, or pork stew. I had never heard of it before, so we took a dive. Great choice to take a dive on. 

Very authentic Mexican food. My favorite Mexican place in all of Seattle is a food truck, but if you are looking to sit down and eat, this is a great place. The food is always on point and you can see them making it fresh from just about anywhere in the restaurant."

Unfortunately, this place doesn&#39;t have a happy hour and doesn&#39;t have any prices online for food, which I understand from an updating perspective but not a fairness to the customer perspective.

FOOD: 

Fortunately, the food is all in the $10-$12 range, with some $6 things and a few $14 or $16 for a big shrimp or steak platter. So the food prices ended up being great. Although the $6 for chips and guac is a little high. We think of chips as free at a Mexican restaurant, so it seems like $6 for guac, which should probably be $4 for the amount you get

Their margaritas and drinks are not as cheap. They are all $10+. That&#39;s when a happy hour would come in handy.

We had the Gringas Oaxaqueñas (learn to pronounce it and they will pretend to think you&#39;re cool), carne asada tacos, bartender&#39;s marg and strawberry marg. Everything tasted great, including the chips and the awesome salsas from the salsa bar. They actually had one that was really hot, and I usually can&#39;t find stuff I think is hot.

SERVICE:

The service was pretty good, it seemed kind of like all hands on deck. We had 3-4 different servers. I asked to move seats when we got in (see below why) and we eventually got moved and they were nice about it.

RESTAURANT: 

By the way, if you sit at the bar right where they&#39;re cooking, it will be hot, because the bar top is metal. Not that it would burn you, but the heat sort of radiates up towards you, you might get a little sweaty.

I am not so sure this would be a good place for a date. It&#39;s not very intimate. The back seating room has a sink and is loud and the lights are a little bright. In the front might be good for a date, but there is not a lot of seating. 

Compared to the Cap Hill Oaxaca:
Smaller, less fancy, fewer things with cheese on the menu :("

There are interesting favorites and new entrees that must be tried on the menu... the Barbacoa de Cabrito (BBQ Goat) or the Pozole (Pork stew). The tacos and amazing and they do the carne asada awesome... but you come here to venture out of your comfort zone and expand what you know about Mexican cuisine.

No need to look any further! 

Although I wish they opened for lunch (opens at 5 daily), I still enjoy the scrumcious food when here. My friend brought me here, promising that I&#39;d love it. And she definitely did not let me down with her promises!

There are seats next to the counter, bar style. And there are also a couple 2 seat tables along the wall. From the looks of it, it seems to be quite small. But there is a back room that has many more tables for larger parties if you walk past the bathroom!
In this back room, you&#39;ll also find a mini salsa bar, which has 4 different salsas that you can serve for yourself - unlimited! FREE! 
(not sure which word was more enticing.... &#34;unlimited&#34; or &#34;free&#34;, so I just wrote both)

Anywho. 
On the menu, I literally got the first 3 items and shared it with my friend. 
The first item was chips and guac. Probably the best guac I&#39;ve had here thus far.
The second were these AMAZING tacos that I can&#39;t really explain. The thick melty zesty cheese on the bottom of the tacos are something I never thought was possible before. The perplexity in flavors that will explode in your mouth can&#39;t really be explained, so I recommend you order for yourself to try. It comes in 3s. So 3 tacos!
The third and last item we got were also tacos (3). Spicy Pork, amazing. Every bite was worth drooling over.

I&#39;ll most definitely be back, and so will you. Because if you don&#39;t, you&#39;re not human."

The salsa bar is fantastic where you can get your own different types of salsa.  

We ordered guacamole and chips and they were terrific, though the portions are on the smaller side.  The chicken tamales were delicious.  It was a little sweet and savory and the masa was terrific.  The corn shell was so yummy where it kind of melts in your mouth.  It is on the more expensive side when it comes to Mexican food but to sit down at a nicer restaurant, it is well worth it."

Step inside and you&#39;re transformed to an eatery right in the heart of Mexico with mouth-watering smells and street-food like sounds. Get the chips and guac to start if you&#39;re a bit hungry - because the guac is amazing. A tad spicy, which gives it an extra edge over regular tex-mex stuff. 

Also get the Entomatadas Verdes if you&#39;re there for lunch, an amazing Verde tomatillo sauce. It&#39;s an amazing assault on the mouth and senses. We also got the Enfrijoladas, which were largely similar, but with a black bean sauce that almost had a chocolatey taste to it. Not as great as the entomatadas, but still delectable. :) 4*"

The restaurant&#39;s wall art is amazing - and there&#39;s lots to see.  I thought it was cool in the men&#39;s room that there were two little mirrors whimsically attached to the wall (by metal accordian arms) next to the main mirror over the sink. You know those mirrors, the ones that that allow you to manipulate them so that you can see the back of your head.  

The drinks menu overflows with thirty plus mezcal options, and nearly as many tequila and cerveza choices.  Sotol is available.  

A side note:  pulque, tequila and mezcal are all maguay (agave) plant distillations.  Pulque is a cheap inexpensive raw form of tequila made from agave sap.   Tequila and mezcal are derived from the heart of the agave.  Contrary to legend, mezcal does not possess psychoactive properties.   Agave distillations are categorized according to how long they&#39;ve been aged.  Blanco has been aged the least, reposado longer and añejo the longest.  The longer the aging, the smoother and darker the finished product.

The difference between tequila and mezcal is a little more arcane.  Per Mexican law, tequila can only be called tequila if it is derived from blue agave, which is grown in the state of Jalisco.  Mezcal can be derived from any variety of agave.  Still, they&#39;re essentially the same liquor.

And then there&#39;s sotol.  It&#39;s also made from agave, but specifically from agave grown in Chihuahua.  Sotol is the state drink of Chihuahua.  Chihuahua is an interesting state.  Part of the state is a high elevation plain, similar to Idaho.  Yes, this is Mexico, but it snows here regularly in the winter.  The plain is farmed and was settled with many Europeans seeking religious independence.  As a result, many of homes and buildings here have a European/Western design. 

The first word that comes to mind in describing sotol is &#34;smooth&#34;.  It sweetly slips down, not burning like tequila. Sotol at Mezcaleria Oaxaca comes in a little bowl along with two lime wedges. Being inexperienced in the ways of tequila, I didn&#39;t know what sequence to use the lime wedges.  One wedge was fresh, the other lightly lined with chili and salt.

For an appetizer, we picked Chayote con Queso, egg-battered chayote (squash) stuffed with cheese, then fried.  It was outstanding, the best dish of the night.  I ordered the Barbacoa de Cabrito, or more simply, barbecued goat.  The pulled-style meat was delicious.  The side was a wonderful saucy corn (or more accurately, cornbread stuffing-like) dish topped with a ribbon of green salsa and another of red salsa.  JP liked the pozole, noting that Mezcaleria Oaxaca&#39;s pozole is generous with the pork.  For dessert we split a dish of toasted plantain strips with a scoop of very good vanilla ice cream."

That being said, their carne asada plate (which I don&#39;t even think is on their menu) is probably the best in Seattle. They have super spicy margaritas and delicious homemade chips and salsa.

The mole sauce  and ribs served with tortillas was delicious and similar to actual oaxacan mole. Sweet and complex like a mexican barbecue sauce. Dessert, which was fried plantains and ice cream was done perfectly and was done very fresh as the heat of the fried plantains contrasted the cold ice cream. 

The portions to me however were small and I was left hungry. Perhaps raise prices and portion size per entree. I think most would need to have multiple entrees or eat a ton of tortilla chips to be satisfied."

Mezcaleria Oaxaca is the friggin bomb....it would put to shame many places in the Mission of SF. 

Homemade Tortillas, fresh roasted Al Pastor withe the pineapple on top.

Everything we had was really really good. Homemade Guac with a side of homemade refrito frijoles....with killer mexican cheese on top. Killer homemade tortilla chips.

We had the following

Tacos al Pastor Barbequed pork in corn tortillas, pico de gallo and salsa verde. Three small tacos filled with succulent pork and vegetables....amazing taste and flavor on home made tortillas....expensive at 7.50 for three..but great.

Sopa de Pollo con Perduras Whole chicken soup with chopped vegetables. Served with tortillas. Killer Mexican soup soul food...chocked with tons of tasty chicken vegetables, and broth.

Mole&#39; Negro mole&#39; with  chicken,served with white rice and tortillas. Mole is how I judge most restaurants...and their mole is rich thick complex and tasty.

And Finally:Tacos DoradosRolled and fried tortillas filled with ground pork and topped with black beans, salsa, quacamole,Oaxaqueño cheese and crema Mexicana. My least favorite dish...fried Taquitoes....had some great flavors of cinnamon...but I just did not love the fried tortillas.

Since we were in the back dinning room we also have privy to their Salsa bar.....four killer salsas: a classic salsa crudo, green cilantro creamy thing, and two red liquid salsas....they were all good...some hot and some mellow...that with the warm homemade tortilla chips.....Friggin awesome.

So me and the misses went for the first time this past &#34;taco Tuesday&#34;.

First, the drinks were just meh.  She had a margarita that seemed to only been 3/4 of a glass, and I had a Pacifico.  Keep in mind, no taps so it&#39;s bottles only.  My entree was the barbacoa de cabrito (braised goat).  It was tender and flavorful, and kinda odd to have in Oaxaqueño cuisine after being so used to having it in Indian.  The sides however left much to be desired.  First there were only two tortillas (although they tasted pretty good), and the beans were like...non existent.  The corn masa side was much thicker, and while it tasted okay was underwhelming at best.

But she had the Enmoladas, which had to have been the biggest surprise of the night and not in a good way.  The whole thing was murdered in molé to the point that it was all you could taste in the meal.  The tasajo while cooked properly was not seasoned at all and looked like it was peeled off a boot...and was completely overpowered by the molé.  Safe to say she didn&#39;t bother to finish the meal.

Service was okay, and the staff was friendly but not exactly enthusiastic.  For the price, I probably would look elsewhere (like Garabaldi on the bottom of the Hill).  The atmosphere screams more gastropub than a full-fledged Mexican restaurant.  I&#39;m sure if you want some good mezcal you&#39;ll want to make this a place to go.  However, if you&#39;re hungry you might want to save yourself the disappointment.

It&#39;s why I considered Chipotle the height of authentic Mexican cuisine for like, 10 years.

I do not know if Mezcaleria Oaxaca is authentic or not. If I&#39;m being honest, I still think Chipotle is the realest mexican grill around.

But what I can tell you, from the bottom of my heart, is that Mezcaleria Oaxaca is the BEST.

Three things:

1. Order chips and guac. I use chips and guac as kind of a benchmark for mexican restaurants, and this place wins, hands down. The chips come out hot and fresh and are insanely crunchy. They have the perfect, balanced amount of oil, salt and flavor that just leaves you wanting more. The guacamole is nothing short of a masterpiece. It&#39;s rich, creamy and flavorful, but not overbearing. The chips and guac make a perfect pair, like that married couple everyone is jealous of. They are wildly different at heart, but both are amazing in their own way. Together, they&#39;re the perfect compliment, bringing out the best in each other and inspiring you to be better too. Chips x Guac, OTP.

3. Order some Mezcal, because everything&#39;s better with a drink. 

2. Order literally anything else, I&#39;ve never had anything that wasn&#39;t amazing here. Personal favorites include the halibut tacos, and &#34;Estofadas con pollo.&#34; To be honest, I have no idea what an estofada is, and I can&#39;t even google it cause all of the results are in Spanish (no, seriously). But the dish is basically a chicken thigh covered in this sweet, almost candy-like sauce. Comes with rice and tortillas, so you can make a little taco out of them, I guess. I can&#39;t really do it justice with a description, but it&#39;s amazing. The chicken is super tender falls right off the bone into and the sweet, tangy sauce brings it all together.

And the blackened halibut tacos...if there was ever a dish on this earth that could be called perfect, this would be it. The halibut is perfectly smoky, flaky and soft. You think you wouldn&#39;t be full after 3 fish tacos, but they are curiously satiating while not being heavy. Don&#39;t forget the lime, and keep the little radish at hand to cleanse your palate between bites, because you&#39;ll want to savor every moment.

I grew up in the Bay Area, and have seen my fair share of tacos.  The tacos here are the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Perfect balance of meat, cilantro, onions....and handmade, fresh tortillas.   

I&#39;m a creature of habit so have only tried two things here:
1. Carne asada tacos - omfg.  I can eat 6 in one setting, it&#39;s like crack.  
2. The chicken mole negro.  Best mole I&#39;ve ever had.  Just thinking about it makes me teary eyed.

On top of the great food, they have great chips and a salsa bar with....wait for it.....amazing pico de gallo.   It&#39;s hard to find restaurants with pico de gallo, much less free pico de gallo.  

They also have a larger room in the back, which is great for families with kids.  

Pro tip - if you bring kids, order a side of tortillas, and two sides of rice and beans.  Let your kids make their own burrito.

Service: I know I ordered water (I was the DD). I know I forgot to gently remind you when you took our orders 10 minutes later. But I didn&#39;t see you again until after the food had arrived and you asked how the food was. By then I already asked (and received) about water from the another server. 

Food: I tend to order whatever I hadn&#39;t recognized before on a menu. True to description, the estofado con pollo had &#34;a&#34; chicken thigh. Drenched in a sauce of tomato, chiles, olives, almonds and raisins. Since it was a thin puree, I&#39;ll assume the olives, almonds, and raisins were in it. Served with rice and tortillas. No other vegetables at all. $16. It wasn&#39;t good and it wasn&#39;t filling for an entree. It mostly just tasted like roasted chilies with tomatoes. The enmoladas my husband ordered were bland. Also not filling. Also $16. 

Maybe that night at 6:30pm, 2+ of the other servers had bailed and you were scrambling trying to deal with the other tables. Maybe the chef was new, also alone (because someone had bailed) and not used to the menu.

Maybe. Still, pretty terrible. No reason to go back."

- Order a house-made sangria while you wait for a table (if you even have to wait). 
- Order the handmade chips and house-made guacamole (unlike any other).
- Hit the salsa bar. Try them all if you haven&#39;t, I love the verde salsa.
- I despise mezcal (smoked agave - tequila) but some people love it, especially if you love peaty flavors, so consider it for the experience. 

Now for entrees, I recommend: 

- Estofado con Pollo
- Tacos al Carbon 
- Everything else, really... you can&#39;t go wrong. 

SERVICE
The service here is always friendly, prompt and communicative. It&#39;s fun to note that the photography around the restaurant are actually all connected to the restaurant in some way. For instance, you&#39;ll see a photograph with smoke coming out of the ground -- that&#39;s how they make the mezcalaria, by smoking the agave underground. Whoa.

I think our server&#39;s name was Karina. We got seated at a long community table and then another couple sat down next to us. We were in between two parties. I was kind of hesitant with sitting at the long table when the server asked us when we arrived. She later comes back and asks the couple next to us if they wanted a two person table and they left. I was just confused as to why they got seated after us and yet still got a different table when we were first. A different two person table opened up and I asked if we could take it. She said another party was already waiting. It was just too loud sitting in between two larger parties to actually hear the person across from me so I kind of had to shout. Bummer city :/

I was just disappointed that we were kind of overlooked. The party next to us also had their checks ready for some time before a server came by. This was only one bad experience out of the few times I&#39;ve gone. I hope they can continue to improve in their service because I really do love the food."

We waited about five-ten minutes before being sat on the patio outside. The couple at the other table had their small dog with them, which was cool for the restaurant to allow. We decided to start with the chips and guacamole which are fried...pretty tasty, but the portion on the guac was a little small compared to some other restaurants I have been to. I ended up going with the Estofado Con Pollo and I can&#39;t recall what my roommate got, but I think it had halibut in it. We also decided to order the tamales just because we had read such good reviews on it. We were told disappointingly that they were out of chicken and that they could substitute it for pork. I wasn&#39;t thrilled at the substitution but decided to go with it as we were already seated. The food and portion sizes were spot on! The tamale was probably the best that I have ever had at a Mexican/Mexican-style restaurant. It is so flavorful and you can taste a hint of banana in it! When it is presented though, it looks like an unappetizing, sloppy, mess. I was kind of worried when we got it, because at other restaurants I have gone to, it is normally well-wrapped and offered with an aesthetically pleasing presentation. Looks can be deceiving though as it was wonderful all around. The Estofado was the perfect blend of flavor pairings and I like that the entrees stay simple. The price points versus the quality are a little on the high side, but it is well-worth it. This is probably my new favorite Mexican restaurant. The ONLY thing I did not like was the service. We started out with a waitress, then the host ended up taking our order, then another waiter brought us our food, and the first waitress came back eventually to drop the check. Not the most personable. You would think that we would be getting a lot of attention based upon how any people were helping us, but the intervals between drink refills and asking if we would like anything else took waaaaaay too long. I had to flag down a random guy just to be able to get change for the cash I was paying with. And I&#39;m sorry, but you are NOT that busy when your restaurant is that small. We tried to offer a compliment to how good the tamale tasted as our plates were being cleared and we were given the stankeye and a thanks. COOL. Regardless, I&#39;ve had worse customer service experiences and it may have been the time that we went. Still offering 4 stars for the food quality alone. It&#39;s tasty. Work on your service industry skills though y&#39;all."

In fact, my friends and I waited over an hour (after we had been told 20 minutes), and we watched every single party get seated before us (including people who came in after us). At the point I was ready to blow up at the host, we decided to just sit at the window on stools (which had been full when we arrived) instead of wait for a table any longer.

But, I was able to forgive that nonsense because the food was THAT GOOD.

After I ate about a bucket of chips with salsa, I ordered the chicken mole, which is FANTASTIC. I licked my plate clean, and that&#39;s not just because I was super hungry. Whatever they use in that recipe (I suspect crack), it definitely works. The chicken was tender (you can also opt to get ribs), and the mole was thick and delicious. It didn&#39;t look like a huge portion, but it was definitely filling.

Margaritas are also quite delicious, but I would stay away from the spicy one, whatever it&#39;s called. It&#39;s TOO spicy going in AND out.

It&#39;s only street parking in Queen Anne (what else is new?), and the wait can be long, so get here somewhat early, especially if visiting on a weekend. In fact, I hate myself for even writing this review, because now another yummy place that I like will become even more crowded. But oh well."

You can tell they use high quality beef for their dishes. The taco carne asada was tender, flavorful and juicy. Their enmolada was also super juicy and nice. As an avocado lover, I had to order extra guacamole and chips. Their guac is the best in town. They put more jalopenos than other places, and it brings out refreshing, spicy kick to creamy guacamole. They bake their own chips at the restaurant and it taste really good.

Most importantly, I was glad to find as health concious mexican restuarant. If you put a little effort in choosing the menu, you can easily have a healthy meal packed with protein and less sodium compared to other mexican restuarants.

Since I am a soup lover, the chicken  soup with vegetables really hit the spot for me! I This is like your regular chicken noodle soup but without the soup and with a mexican twist. I think the lime really makes a huge difference in the taste of the soup when added. I definitely can&#39;t wait to try other dishes from here.

FYI they are fast with togo. It took them 10 minutes to get the dish prepared for togo so I can take it back to work to eat. Definitely will be back here again!"

As the evening went on it was getting freezing so the table next to us tried to close the door. Apparently there are people sitting out in the back patio eating and if you close the door they have no light! So the wait staff started fighting with the table next to us. When I chimed in yo say we were cold too we were asked to be fair to the people that chose to sit outside in the dark! This is Seattle. If you are going to offer outdoor space offer lighting and a heater. Not inclined to go back to a place where wait staff fight with customers when they are actually being pretty reasonable.

My GF had the tacos el pastor from the vertical spit (the way it&#39;s supposed to be done) and I had barbacoa. Both were very nice. The pineapple on the spit stayed there but there was a fruity flavor to the salsa they served on the tacos so maybe they put the pineapple there... Not sure but in Mexico they&#39;d take their machete and slice off a small piece and have it drop on the tacos before serving.

I&#39;ll go back here for sure."

Seated quickly at around 6:00 on a Friday night, which was a pleasant surprise (last table tho...place isn&#39;t very big at all). Got some chips and guacamole with salsa bar access for $6; three salsas and a pico de gallo, all not bad. 

Also had a trio of pork tacos, tender meat but flavor a bit too sweet for me. Tacos are also small but made with fresh handmade tortillas, so that&#39;s a plus fosho.

The enmoladas - this might be an unpopular opinion, but I didnt like the mole very much at all. Too heavy on the anise flavor and topped with tons of parsley. Thankfully, the dish comes with tender carne asada (forgot what they call it). 

Last thing we tried was a steak with a tomato, onion and chile sauce. Tasty but nothing out of this world, yet still the best thing we tried there probably (and the tortillas). 

$48 for the food, XX beer and aqua de piña. Overpriced considering the portions. Might go back to try the goat. Should&#39;ve gotten the goat instead of the overly sweet mole with the strong anise flavor :("

To me, this place is like fine-dining of Mexican food. I&#39;ve eaten a lot of Mexican food, although much of it is Tex-Mex, so I knew not to expect a gigantic plate, drenched in queso/sauce. The atmosphere seemed relaxed paired with mood-lightning. The service was polite and quick and less pretentious than I expected.

My date and I both ordered the Enchiladas Verdes con Pollo with a side of Chips and Guac. The chips came out pretty quickly and were hot; the guac was pretty darn good, but I wish there was more of it. We got a refill of the chips; no extra charge! (whew).

The enchiladas came out pretty quick and came with a side of beans and rice. There were two enchiladas and it looked AND tasted awesome. The tortilla was slightly crisp and the sauce and cheese they put on it was really amazing. 

In the end, I&#39;d have to say that this is a place I&#39;d return to, but not very often. The price is good for quality, but beyond that, I think I&#39;d hit up a cheaper place for tacos if I&#39;m in the mood for Mexican."

The water and guac came pretty quickly. The portion size of the guac is TINY. There&#39;s either 30 too many chips or not enough guac. I vote the latter. I didn&#39;t find it to be that special since it didn&#39;t have any seasoning or a spicy kick. I enjoyed the fresh tomatoes in it, though. We got salsa from the salsa bar to dip the rest of the chips in.

Once our table was ready, we went to the back and got seated. Does this place have air conditioner?! It felt like a humid sauna and there were various BO smells circling the air. I have a strong aversion to such smells. There isn&#39;t very much space between the back of each person&#39;s seat (if you&#39;re sitting in the center) because the waiters will ask you to scoot your chair in every time they pass you. I moved seats 4 times and he made me scoot in EVERY time. I didn&#39;t find sitting in the back there very comfortable. It&#39;s also very loud. It&#39;s a pretty small space to pack so many people in. I found it a bit challenging to hear my friend and we opted to go back to the bar where it&#39;s cooler, and less noisy. I&#39;d rather get a neck creak from facing one another for a few hours than sit in a BO sauna.

My friend ordered the carne asada tacos. Foodiecall and I both ordered the barbacoa. This menu item comes with homemade corn tortillas. These are SO good. They have the perfect amount of elasticity, and don&#39;t break when you fold it in half. They are yum! Be careful of mini bones in the dish if you get the barbacoa. 

The Caldo de Mariscos is pretty oily and orangey brown in color. 

One of my most favorite parts of receiving food is taking food photos. Yes, I&#39;m one of those that takes 15 photos from each angle before eating (don&#39;t hate). That being said, I took TWO photos of my dish, I don&#39;t find the food here pleasant to look at. Yes, I understand Mexican food has a lot of variations of the color brown but there&#39;s a lot more that can be added to make the plate pop besides the sprig of cilantro used as garnish on the side. I also eat with my eyes before my mouth, so seeing something plated beautifully stirs Pavlov-like excitement within my foodie heart. I just didn&#39;t feel excited to eat (and took the rest home). The food is just boring to look at and...not pretty. 

The salsas are decent. One of them is HELLA salty. One of them punches your face with spice. You may cry tears in salsa format. The verde tastes fine mixed with the guac.

The service is kind and accommodating. I&#39;ve been to their sister restaurant a few times before.

Between the blaring music and other people in your space bubble, I don&#39;t find this restaurant very conducive for conversation unless you sit outside. Overall, I may skip on the &#34;Fifty Shades of Brown&#34; and look at a color wheel instead. We&#39;ll see..."

These fish tacos are one of the priciest entrees on the menu, but it comes with nothing.  It&#39;s more like finger food or a very light appetizer with no sides.  When they brought it to the table I thought this must be a joke!  The diameter of the tortilla is like a small doughnut.

I&#39;ve been to numerous taco trucks around town that have amazing fish tacos for 1/4 of the price.

They also charge $6 for chips, which does come with guac and access to 3 different salsas on their salsa bar, but geez, come on!  There is no option for just chips only.

I had the chips, my wife and I both ordered the fish tacos and I had (1) beer and it was $46.  We left feeling still hungry and feeling ripped off and like we just ate a seriously overpriced snack.

Don&#39;t go here if you&#39;re really hungry!  If you don&#39;t mind paying 2x to 3x for taco truck food with tiny portions, this is your place."

If it is your first time, I&#39;d really suggest going with the Mole Negro.  SO GOOD!! The portions here are not large, so if you are hungry, get some appetizers.  The guac is really tasty, as are the chips.  

The tortillas?  Made right there...and you can tell... so warm, so soft, so good.  The rice?  So perfectly sticky and tasty...omg.  I&#39;m hungry right now thinking about this amazing place!!

Walk past the ktichen and you&#39;ll find a host of abuelas stirring enormous pots of mole, making homemade tortilla chips from scratch, and yes, even barbecuing a goat.

This place is the real deal.  You probably know this if you&#39;ve visited their Ballard twin, La Carta de Oaxaca.  The food is just as fantastic.   By all means, order the mole negro with chicken  --this entree is a must have plate for any order.

There are far fewer crowds and jostled elbows to contend with than La Carta, although there is probably less seating overall.   Don&#39;t pass on the house made chips. In fact, make them a focal point of your meal.  Order the guacamole, order the hot bean dip (yes both) and then stock up at the salsa bar.  You won&#39;t regret it.

The food is really tasty.  Legit. 

BTW, those new to this spot, this is Oazacan food  --you are not going to find a burrito in the place.  Its okay.  Don&#39;t panic.  The rest of the food is very, very good.  Much better than the salty, ginormous burrito you were craving.

Coming from San Francisco and the Mission, I take my hat off to Mezcaleria for their amazing food.  Its authentic.  Its delicious.  The heat is fabulous.  The corn tortillas are homemade.  The atmosphere is fun and visually energetic.

Coming from Norcal, the land of some freakin&#39; amazinnggggg Mexican food, I was surprised how authentic the food here was.

I would not order the seafood stew again...too many bones and not much but broth..

But...the rest of the menu items we tried (on multiple meals, same trip lol) is great!

The salsas here are some of the best ive tried.

Very nice waitress&#39; too!"

There was too much liquid in the sauces, and the flavor was really missing.

They need to improve the consistency in the kitchen.  

Two visits back I gave it a 4...  I would give the last visit a 2.  

I guess I&#39;ll rate them a 3 on average, but with pretty small portions at fairly high prices, the food really needs to be prepared with the save heart, soul, and care every time.

MUST ORDERS:
* LOVED the steak (huge and perfectly cooked and prepared).
* Non-alcoholic drink - tangy and refreshing
* Corn (though it was hard to cut) was also really flavorful and fresh
* The mustard green salad sounds bitter, but was so delicious and refreshing. 
* I also LOVED the zucchini bread, which was surprisingly moist. Very similar to a banana bread?

GOOD: 
The Sea Wolf Bread (from the sous chef), was one of the better breads I&#39;ve had in Seattle (dislike Macrina, Dahlia and Columbia City). The boule bread was definitely the best, the rye was super soft, but I didn&#39;t really like that or the baguette. 

HATED:
* The clams - it was practically inedible because i tasted like it went bad. It was also served luke warm. 
* Semifreddo was lackluster, served kind of like a slice of cake, and one of the worst I&#39;ve had."

I had heard good things so we gave it a shot on a Saturday night. Decor was nice enough but a bit too instagram cliche for me. Exposed beam curved ceiling is cool though. Menu was similar to the decor, nothing too shocking here, lots of &#34;impressive&#34; ingredients but nothing too daring or surprising. Almost seemed like they were trying to wedge things in so every dish could have at least one non-English descriptor. 

Had a few appetizers, they were uniformly boring and forgettable. Veggies were fresh but nothing wowed us here. For mains I had a sausage and pepper dish and my companion a halibut. Sausage was disappointing- mealy and dry. Peppers were good enough but for all the florid description just tasted like peppers in oil.  Fish was cooked properly, but again I felt like the menu was all talk as that&#39;s all there really was to this one. 

Service was good and friendly, never had to wait or felt rushed."

The corn was a mix of italian and mexican flavors which we never would have dreamt up, and it worked.

The tuna was.. tuna salad on pumpernickel.  Fine if it weren&#39;t $13 for the less than one slice of bread&#39;s worth, and if it weren&#39;t something I could make at home and enjoy more there.

The chanterelle in tomato soup was phenomenal, impossible to stop eating.

The clams in curry was also phenomenal.

The drinks were lovely.

The server was very pleasant, but for some reason we had to ask for the bread we ordered 3 times and it finally arrived halfway through our meal.  No wiping up delicious flavors for you!  That said, when the bread came it was delicious and holy crap that&#39;s a BIG serving of bread and butter.

We were excited to try a restaurant run by a James Beard award winning restaurant in the area. After all, the Chefs in our area (Tory Miller in Madison, WI and Stephanie Izard in Chicago, IL) run stellar places...and Seattle is supposed to have an even more impressive food scene. 

Well, unfortunately this place was a pretty big disappointment.

Very slow, inattentive and borderline rude service from our server. Although I will say at some point toward the end of our meal, the other servers seemed to try to jump in and save our experience.

We ordered a lot of food...like 3 entrees and a bunch of small plates to share for the 3 of us. It all sounded okay to me, but nothing jumped off the menu as super exciting. Unfortunately, when the plates came, the flavors and execution just didn&#39;t cut it either. I can barely even remember what we had except the sardines were good, yet served on an awkwardly chunky/thick and hard toasted piece of baguette. 

Drinks were good, but we couldn&#39;t get our servers&#39; attention to order a second.

Just a blah food experience and a $300 bill after tip. One of the more expensive meals we have had out this year and also one of the most forgettable. :("

We ordered the clams (usually I love the broth and save it to dip the bread in, but it was wayy too salty), the salmon (pretty basic, fresh for sure but nothing crazy), the cauliflower soup (delicious!), gouda with candied parsnips, and finally the chocolate terrine (this was pretty unique and really good).

As everyone says, atmosphere is 5 stars. It&#39;s cozy and energetic. I walk by it all the time and love the vibes coming out of Whale Wins.

Unfortunately, we ordered 3 things off the menu and were not satisfied with any of them.

Braised Greens &amp; Buckwheat. This is cold. Just as an FYI. At least ours was. Which I was very taken aback by since when I hear the word &#34;braised&#34; I just assume it will be warm. The world &#34;chilled&#34; wasn&#39;t in the description for this anywhere and it honestly was cold... like had been sitting in the fridge for quite a while. My boyfriend liked this dish okay but I couldn&#39;t eat it. 

Cauliflower and pickled mushrooms. I was excited for this dish, but it came out luke warm. Which was weird and unexpected also. I felt like the cauliflower should have been hot (or at least not luke warm) since it was roasted. It honestly seemed like it had been sitting out for a while and someone just threw some sauce on it and called it good. It also came out within 5 minutes of being ordered so I would not be surprised if this was in fact the case.

Crawfish. This is really our fault. But... we didn&#39;t really know how to eat crawfish. We laughed about it and it was fine, but the waitress was pretty awkward when we asked her about how to handle the situation. She just said, &#34;We just encourage our customers to really get their hands dirty.&#34; 

Overall... I was really unhappy with the experience for how much it costed. I won&#39;t be going back again."

Finally got to try one of Renee Erickson&#39;s restaurants a few months back, but I wasn&#39;t impressed. It seems since I&#39;ve been, the menu format has changed a little. I might be willing to give it another try. I left hungry, but paid like I shouldn&#39;t have been.

Nothing wowed me, maybe I was coming in with too high of expectations, but from what I hear about Renee Erickson&#39;s restaurants it sounds like they should be able to live up to it. The Whale Wins seemed like a standard new American restaurant, which Seattle has plenty of already.

The highlight of the meal was young 20-something sitting next to our table who was reading alone. She ordered white wine, a plate of pickles and ate the complimentary bread. She left after being there for 25 minutes, what an odd dining experience."

I love to cook, discovered the cookbook at the Amazon bookstore, and decided to check out the restaurant shortly after. Though prices aren&#39;t the at the cheap eats level where you could eat here everyday (unless you make a ton of expendable money), I still try to come once every month or so.

This place has excellent service, cute decor, and great food. My favorites have been the carrot salad and the sardine toast. They have a steak option for two that I&#39;ve been saving for a special occasion but I&#39;ve seen it and it makes my mouth water every time. Flavors of the food are on the delicate side but portions are generous. If you go through the cookbook (same title as the restaurant), you&#39;ll get a sense of the chef&#39;s style. 

I also recommend going between 4-6pm for happy hour - $1 off double asterisked items, drinks and small plates mostly. My friend commented that their cocktails are the best he&#39;s had in Seattle so far so it&#39;s worth checking out once. And if you&#39;re a bread lover, I&#39;d buy a loaf to bring home ($7). It&#39;s not like any loaf. It&#39;s artisanally made, with a nice crispy crust and a very moist crumb. If you&#39;ve had Bread from Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, they are comparable."

I completely understand the hype as the restaurant is modern, simple, clean-cut and located in a great area by the water next to Joule. The food is very fresh, the dishes are beautiful and light. With that said, here are some items we ordered:

Scallop Crudo
Fermin Jamon Serrano Ham and Butter
Marinated Squid
Pickled Ramps
Hama Hama Roasted Clams
Roasted Half Chicken

It wasn&#39;t that the food wasn&#39;t great, but my group felt the menu selection was small (in terms of meat items). Sorry we&#39;re big-time &#34;meatarians&#34;. It seems the menu is geared towards light eaters because the serving sizes were very small too. The highlight of the menu for us was absolutely the Roasted Half Chicken! You can guess why, but the chicken was roasted very well and it had lots of flavor to it. At least they got the 1 item we were looking forward to eating right!

The menu selection was a big disappointment and so were the serving sizes, but the food was undoubtedly fresh, well-made and you can see the results. It&#39;s probably a hit or miss for many and I can see it&#39;s more hit than miss for Yelp reviewers here, which is great, but for myself and my group this wasn&#39;t our cup of tea."

My friend and I came in to have a light dinner so we primarily ordered the small plates. While I don&#39;t usually order bread at restaurants, theirs is top notch and is really nice to start with. I really liked how creative their menu is...I think it&#39;s really great that their offerings are not something you could get at any other restaurant. Many of their dishes offer new flavor and ingredient combinations to discover.

We had the bread, the burrata with shaved jicama, one of the daily cheeses (a valentine cheese, which I&#39;d never had before), the roasted carrots, and the zucchini bread. Everything was delicious, and I am now dying to figure out how to make carrots like that. You might wonder why on earth you&#39;d order a completely carrot dish at a restaurant until you have these ones. We also had some drinks there, and while their tap list isn&#39;t extensive, what they do have is great. This place is definitely on the pricier side, but is a really nice place for a treat.

Service is wonderful, and the bartender even went through the whole menu for my vegetarian friend and let her know what was safe to eat, which non-vegetarian dishes could be modified to be vegetarian, etc. Overall, great experience here and when I&#39;m in the mood to treat myself this will definitely be on the roster."

We either ordered the wrong dishes or they had a guest chef that night. None of the 5 dishes (4 small plates and the bone marrow) hit the spot. 

The triviso destroyed my palate for the entire night. It is one of the most bitter vegetables to begin with but compared to the bitter melon, the method that they cooked it (which was none) did not help the natural bitter taste at all. Triviso should be best cooked grilled, pickled, or served in very small quantity but they gave us a big plate like the servings of a normal salad and it was served raw, like a salad. When we mentioned it to the server, she agreed and said the decision was purely by the chef and the dish is different at Walrus and Carpenter. Luckily she took the dish off our check.

The beef belly tartine had really good ingredients but the combo flavor was off. It wasn&#39;t even a tartine, more like an open faced sandwich. I thought they would make it more like a Reuben sandwich but they didn&#39;t go that way which was surprising.

The escarole was like a rip off Korean kimchi and had a sardine after taste.

The carrots were surprising. I thought it was be a warm dish but it was cold. Would be nicer to have a warm dish after all the weird taste we had earlier. Overall they did a good job making fennel not taste bitter in this case. 

The bone marrow was disappointing. I felt like I was drinking fat. They could&#39;ve spend more time defattening the marrow. I felt so sick after the meal. It was not necessary to serve 3 large marrows. The execution would be better if they served 1 or 2 marrows but cut open so everything is cooked. My marrow were all pink in the inside. 

Overall, the service was great, location and ambiance were good. They had good ideas but the food execution was terrible."

Our main dish was what I was mostly disappointed with. We got the fig wrapped halibut with chickpeas.

The ambience and service are still fantastic. Cocktails and wine are stellar, and there are stand-outs on the menu like the roast chicken and the famed pickled veggies.  However, the other dishes just didn&#39;t have the flavor I&#39;ve come to expect from Renee Erickson.  The clams were a little chewy and the broth was just average.  Veggies like the shaved Brussel sprouts and the radishes were good, but lacking some seasoning.  Even the chicken was not as delicious as I remember it the first time.  Perhaps it was an off night, or perhaps Renee is not as personally involved as she used to be.

The best, by far, was the green beans with halibut (we ordered a second dish of it). The clams came in a mismatched curry-ish broth, which did not work, but at least was edible. The sausages were horribly dry, without any flavor whatsoever, and we couldn&#39;t even eat it. Perhaps worth a try during happy hour, but not worth the regular dinner prices."

The food could be more consistent.  The house pickles were great.  The braised greens were awful.  I wasn&#39;t prepared for them to be cold.  This gave a bad texture and off flavor.  The roast carrots were good.  The yogurt they use has a wonderfully luxurious mouth feel.  The raclette was not ideal for sharing based on the presentation, but still tasted good. The roast chicken was outstanding.  It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, but it is a little hard to carve if you are sharing .  The sardine was better than expected, but sloppy.  It was too thick and you couldn&#39;t make that balanced bite of topping and toast.  The meringue was outstanding, but the cake was average.

I thought the roasted carrots were very tasty (but cold and not sure if intentional but I think they would have been better warm). All the cheese we had was also good. It&#39;s cheese and jam, though. When isn&#39;t that good? We ordered the roasted chicken and unfortunately the center was raw. The server was very apologetic and comped that dish which I greatly appreciated. Mistakes happen but I&#39;ve never been served raw chicken before and I&#39;m surprised this place missed that considering it&#39;s a little on the pricier side. The coating of the chicken and the cooked parts were very tasty though. 

Overall I think I was just a little disappointed with the menu selection. I think it changes daily but we must have picked a bad day. My husband won&#39;t eat anything pickled, and I don&#39;t eat much protein so between the two of us, there wasn&#39;t much of a selection besides bread and cheese. If you aren&#39;t a picky eater, I recommend giving it a shot. If anything have a cocktail and have some cheese."

- Black ops: Rittenhouse is my rye of choice for a cocktail; this one was very spirit driven but was a bit sweet 

Food: 
- Cascadia Creamery Sawtooth: we loved this cheese - it&#39;s from a local farm and reminds me of some washed rind French cheeses I&#39;ve had.  We searched multiple markets for this after, but even the places that carried Cascadia creamery cheese didn&#39;t have the sawtooth.  The plum black currant rosemary jam had a lot going on, and it changes the character of the cheese (in a good way); you should try the cheese with and without the jam
- Eggplant, fermented corn, cauliflower: the eggplant was more like a baba ganouj at the bottom.  It had so many different colors and textures.  There was purple cauliflower, regular cauliflower, sliced radishes, Israeli feta (great flavor), and calabrian chili oil.  The corn was more pickled than fermented (different from huitlacoche, which is what we were expecting). This was a nice highlight of produce and was a great vegetable dish.
- Fried cucumber: I&#39;ve never had fried cucumber, but this is a richer, warm vegetable dish.  The kohlrabi was great, but between the cultured cream (ie butter), and honey dijon at the bottom, it was a pretty rich/fatty
- Togiak herring butter on toast: it was thick cut toast with a good spread of herring butter, and the pickled onions were a good contrast. They have a lot of different interesting toasts, so we were trying to decide between them and went with this one.
- Salt roasted half chicken: great seasoning and texture on the skin, and the chicken breast part was not dry at all.  The crimson snow nectarine was intense in flavor and was so good.  The tomato jam was a bit sweet.

I would definitely get the eggplant, sawtooth, and chicken again.  By the end, we were too full for dessert - it was a good amount of food for 2 people.  All of the flavors and combinations of ingredients were more unique and interesting than most other locavore/seasonal cuisine menus.  

I would definitely come back."

Who hasn&#39;t been to the whale wins by now?? It was the hot new thing when it first opened,(2013) and it is still the best new kid on the block. Still notable, swoon worthy and worth waiting for.

The chef knows her stuff :) The decor is still my favorite. Beautiful open kitchen. Bright white counter tops, stunning flowers, wine bottles and small patio fits this one story foodie heaven just right. It also happens to be next to my other favorite spot: Joule. Coming here is always a treat. The décor is quite charming and stunning with massive floral arrangements, beautiful marble counters, open kitchen, pretty wine bottles! All of it.

Food 
Try everything. It is such a simple and small menu with seasonal items. You must try them all. 

Love - 
Every toasts - sardines on toast! These are my favorite. Such a beautiful ,clean and tasty dish!

Oh and Pork rillettes on toast! Another fresh ingredients mixed perfectly well on baked bread. Hmmm. 

Roasted chicken! I know it is a simple dish. But it is surprisingly good. I get this dish almost every time I dine here. Chef Erickson knows her bird!! 

Painted hill cote de bouef - 32 ozs of happiness on a plate. It is a massive, juicy, buttery perfection!! I have yet to finish it on my own. And at the price point, it&#39;s quite a deal and a steal. 

The drinks also are quite beautifully done. Whether you want a nice glass of rose or a cold glass of tasty something cocktail, they can deliver it. With an ambiance like theirs, it&#39;s hard not to swoon over everything. Dare I say it is even romantic. I&#39;ve also done their whale happy hour ( weeee), where my favorite things like sardines on toast is on the menu for a steal!! Attentive service, simple food and stunning décor. That&#39;s enough for me to love!"

The first was soon after it opened and we waited a full 3 hours after being told it would be 1.5. We amused ourselves at Joule&#39;s bar for the first 2 and at that point it was so late and we were so invested we just kept waiting. The food was good at that time but we were so hungry at that point anything would have tasted fantastic. 

Went last Saturday with some girlfriends and didn&#39;t have to wait long. The food was good but nothing was outstanding, for all the hype and the prices I expect at least a couple dishes to be phenomenal. 

I hate the mandatory 20% tip. I can understand 15 or even 18 with the opportunity to write in more, but we did not receive 20% worth of service. The waitress was nowhere to be found at multiple points in the night, we had planned on a leisurely dinner but when we were ready to order more drinks or more courses it was hard to get her attention.

Another small annoyance was that she over-represented the size of their pichet. I should have asked specifically how many MLs but I believed her when she said they were &#34;almost the size of a full bottle of wine&#34;. It was defintely 1/4 less if not a full 1/2. 

The 2 star Yelp description is a perfect summary: &#34;Meh. I&#39;ve experienced better.&#34;"

10 stars for the: look, feel, how they prepare the plates (artistic, worth the $ since it&#39;s done in a fabulous, intentional way), the fun yet simple bathrooms, the location)

We ordered the following:

5 stars ~ Roasted Squash, Feta, Sunflower Seeds, Ancho Chili, Pickled Pepper $14
rich, but light, great flavor from the ancho chili, the sunflower seeds great, feta added to this dish in perfect ways.

3 stars ~ Painted Hills Cote De Bouefu, Tomato, Radish, Onions 32oz $80
my hubby ate this entire dish (menu says it is for two, but he only had that with 3 slices of bread). He is pretty high maintenance with steak since we&#39;ve been to Daniel&#39;s Broiler twice and left with only amazing things to say about the meat&#39;s flavor, and this piece of meat came in pretty good but average at the same time. Waaaayyyy over salted, and the oil from the tomato/radish mix was over-done.

2 stars ~ Smoked Roasted Potatoes, Butter, Salt $5.5
Way too much salt and we aren&#39;t fans of butter, apparently. Good flavor though from the smoked way of cooking them. 

5 stars ~ Beet, Apple, Beat Greens, Yogurt, a whole lotta oil and some sesame seeds. Delicious, wonderful flavors. Everything seriously danced together on the plate and into my mouth.

In the end, we unfortunately won&#39;t be returning, but I do wish I could try a couple more of the small plates since I personally felt they were very well done. Really though I was turned off from the amount of oil on the steak&#39;s veg (which I ate on their own, and I think it ruined my whole experience). I don&#39;t mind the $$ of the dishes, but hubby and I were both bothered by the 20% gratuity - understood, though (still crazy to be charged $23 on top of our meal, but nice to not be asked to tip on top of that or anything).

Final word: we made reservations for a Saturday night but it was Halloween so they didn&#39;t seem necessary since it wasn&#39;t that busy. Recommend reservations, anyway ;)"

Thanks to the 2016 price increases, now it&#39;s just fast service and solid food. I can go somewhere else for good value.

Went here on a Sunday evening (with reservations) and it was was already set up for us by the time we got there. The host was really nice and seated us at the table. Unfortunately they don&#39;t have high chairs and our party had 2 kiddos. Maybe something to invest in! 

The decor and ambience of this place is on par. High ceilings with cute light fixtures that spell out &#34;HELLO.&#34; Love the marble tables and open kitchen. You could see the wood fire grill and the chefs cooking away. They have a nice patio with luscious greenery. 

Food: 
-We got 2 of the specials - flat bread with spiced pumpkin seeds with honey drizzled on top and some seasoned butter. I think there was more to it but I can&#39;t think of it right now. It was delicious though!
-Lettuce, herbs, pistachio, and parmasean. Simple enough but it was nice to have a veggie dish to the meal.
-Roasted carrot, fennel, harissa, yogurt - definitely could taste that harissa kick to it! Couldn&#39;t feed this to the little ones. Nice roast that was a little crunchy, yet still soft.
-Matiz sardines on toast, tomato paste, and shaved fennel. One of my favorites! Crunchy toast that went perfectly with the paste and sardines. 
-Manila clams, potato, mustard greens, onion, celery, tomato piquillo sauce - delicious!! Plentiful serving of clams to enjoy
-Roasted half chicken with nectarine, corn, bread and butter rhubarb - the nectarine is warm and oozing with flavor. The chicken was tender with its crispy skin. Overall, a solid dish with lots going on.

Overall impression - I was pretty happy. The servers were all really nice and didn&#39;t seem to mind too much with the 2 kids running around. All the food comes out once it&#39;s made. I would definitely come back and check out other dishes!"
the-whale-wins-seattle,Julie L.,1Y5yVHsDYoCl3WL-jjfMTQ,"Edmonds, WA",0,1,1,6,201,rL4f-Zd8CdNdtNAK0L4AIg,3.0,2016-03-05,"First impression: Aww, cute.
Second impression: Wait, I&#39;m confused. 

My boyfriend and I made an impulsive stop while we were exploring and were lucky to be squeezed in before someone&#39;s reservation, which might tell you something about the place&#39;s popularity. 

What I was confused about was their concept. I finally decided on &#34;elevated farm-to-table that&#39;s not exactly all local.&#34;
But squeezing a restaurant into a concept may not do it justice, so moving on. 

It seemed like an ideal place for a date. We were seated between two other couples (too close in my opinion, but it is a small space.) 
Food takes its time getting out, so there&#39;s lots of time to dig into your date&#39;s head. If you&#39;re not prepared for that, you&#39;re in for pretty long and awkward stretches of time. 
My boyfriend and I enjoyed guessing what stage in the relationship couples were at. :)

The food itself: Since we only stopped for light food, I don&#39;t claim to know jack squat about their fare. The few small dishes we did get weren&#39;t terribly memorable in flavor, but I do remember how clean, wholesome, and fresh everything was. I also appreciated the creativity I saw on the menu, and it was also very apparent that each dish was made with the utmost care. 

Service was on point and friendly, even a bit polished. Gratuity is included in the bill, which I never feel great about, but the service justified it enough. 

Conclusion: The food was good, but not what would keep me coming back, and it&#39;s spendy especially if you&#39;re going to have a full course meal for two. What redeems it is the service and more notably the ambience that sets a slow pace for a quality date night. However, some of the seating is a little cramped and may impede on a good conversation. 
I would give The Whale Wins 4 or 5 stars if the food could catch up with the ambience."

We were the first ones waiting for the restaurant to open.  The restaurant was nicely decorated.  I loved the lamps above that spelled out &#34;HELLO&#34;.  Hello there!  :)

We ordered moscow mules and the Painted Hills Marrow Bones.  The first set of moscow mules came in short cups and were a bit hard to drink because the ice was in the way.  We told the waitress and the second round of drinks came in tall glasses with a straw.  

Now onto the food.  The Painted Hills Marrow Bones came with a side of raisins, capers and pickled shallot relish.  The marrow bones were good, but a little too fatty for me.  It reminded me of the marrow bones that are put in when cooking pho!  But it was a nice blend of fatty, sweet, sour and salty all in one.  

Our server was nice and attentive.  But we were there when the restaurant had just opened and there were only a couple other people there at the time we came.  I would come back to try other items on their menu in the near future!"

We happened to be in Freemont for the day and were seeking sustenance.  The Whale Wins had come up as an excellent restaurant in the immediate area so we decided to give it a shot.  This was a great decision and one of our most enjoyable meals in Seattle.

We arrived around 4pm, right when they opened and we had a quick discussion with the hostess about our food restrictions.  They didn&#39;t seem bothered in the least and this gave me a level of calm that lasted through our meal.  I was a highly impressed with the layout of the restaurant.  The large open and L-shaped prep area and bar was full of a bounty of fresh items that looked almost too good to be real.  They were in fact real and they were incredible.

House made bread with I&#39;m guessing churned in-house butter began our meal and it was as decadent as you an imagine it could have been.

My wife and I split the half chicken and a couple of sides.  I have to give the chicken as a special mention.  As someone who frequently struggles with chicken at home (cooking it perfectly, not actually fighting it) I appreciate when a restaurant turns out a perfect bird.  It was crisp, juicy and even looked perfect when presented.  A lot of love went into that dish and I was thrilled to eat it.

I have no idea when I&#39;ll be in Freemont again but I will be recommending the Whale Wins to anyone in the vicinity.  They come to play."

The sardines on toast that everyone writes about was probably my favourite thing that night, but certainly not a front runner for &#34;best dish in Seattle&#34;.  The roasted carrot and fennel dish was dressed a bit too aggressively with harissa, with nothing sufficient to temper or balance each bite.

The roasted clams weren&#39;t bad, as the sauce oozed bacon and Pernod (in a very good way).  We were hopeful as the marinated squid and pea vines hit the table, but it was probably just a bit too understated and not entirely memorable.  

Overall, each component of every dish was clearly well intentioned, but overall probably a bit too restrained to our liking."

Oddly enough, there was no fish on the menu.  Only small plates of sardines and clams.

Since she doesn&#39;t eat meat, I suppose the sardines were her only choice since the clams were prepared with sausages.

Being a Seattle restaurant with a fishy name, a person would justifiably expect at least one dish that included some type of fish.  Nope.  Not one.

Nevertheless, we were starving and decided to get a few drinks and appetizers, but to hold off on ordering anything substantial since we wanted to go to a different restaurant.

She ordered a mojito and I ordered a $10.00 beer.  Why the fuck does a Fremont Brewery beer cost $10 at this place, when I could probably walk down the street to the actual Fremont Brewery and get it for $5.00!?

While we finished our drinks, we decided to nibble on some bread and butter and some type of blue cheese.

The cost came to $42.00, because they automatically add 18 percent gratuity due to the $15.00 minimum wage thing.  Pretty sure they don&#39;t have 50 or 100 employees or whatever the minimum requirement is, so I doubt the new wage law has affected them....but whatever.  I will always support paying people more money.

We joked about the expense, because essentially bread and butter had cost us nearly $50.00.

I gave Whale Wins one star, because this was not a pleasant beginning to our evening.

Even the chairs were uncomfortable and the tables were situated extremely close to each other.

I wish my first experience at this establishment wasn&#39;t mostly negative, because it&#39;s a nicely decorated restaurant and has pretty good service.  I sincerely wanted to like it, but due to this awful experience we won&#39;t be returning or recommending Whale Wins to anyone.

You don&#39;t always need an awesome or weird name to interest patrons, but it definitely doesn&#39;t hurt The Whale Wins. Besides, if there&#39;s a whale fight to be had, my friends know I&#39;m always down! 

***********
THE ARRIVAL:
We came on a Sunday at 4:30 p.m., so it wasn&#39;t busy yet. I easily found street parking closeby.  

If you can make a reservation, do it.  As the evening progessed, the restaurant definitely became busier.  However, online reservations are limited (best for a group of 2-4) and most seats are for walk-ins.

Situated in Fremont, this restaurant is modern and the lighting made a big difference in the atmosphere.  The Whale Wins has an interesting aesthetic, with marbling everywhere and an open kitchen.  It was intimate but spacious at the same time.  

The tables are spaced fairly close together, so I could see why people might feel it was crowded.  However, that wasn&#39;t my experience because I arrived 30 mins after they opened, it wasn&#39;t busy yet during that time, and the ceiling was open, making it feel like the building was converted from a warehouse.

When I looked up from our table, there were even lights coming down from the ceiling that spelled &#34;HELLO.&#34;  Why, HELLO right back at you! ;)

Our waiter was extremely friendly, polite, and attentive.  Maybe it was me, but I thought our waiter looked like the actor Shia Lebouf with a beard (but in a good way!)  So, as Shia Lebouf (cough cough), I mean, as our waiter was making suggestions, we ordered our food and waited in anticipation.

***********
FOOD a.k.a &#34;THE GOODS&#34;
We ordered:
-Sardines with curried tomato paste and shaved fennel on toast (I think was $8-$12)
-Small Hama Hama roasted clams with lentils ($16)
-Painted hills bone marrow with raisins, capers, &amp; onions ($18)
-Bread and salted butter ($3)

The food had a Mediterranean/European inspired taste, with sour, acid, pickled, salty and sweet tones at the forefront. The small plates are best shared family style and the food is made to order.  This means you can have multiple plates coming towards you all at once.  

My favorite dish was the sardines on toast.  It was briney, with the right amount of crunch from the fennel.  Initially, the toast seemed to be too thick for the dish, but as I ate, it actually balanced out the saltiness of the sardine and the curried tomato paste.

The clams were a good portion size and the bone marrow was cooked well.

Though the plates were tasty, there wasn&#39;t a specific dish that made me think: I HAVE to come back soon to try it again. Luckily, they appear to change their menu regularly to give customers something different now and then.

***********
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

The style of food is not necessarily for everyone.  It&#39;s an acquired taste, especially if you&#39;re not used to eating the combo of sour /pickled /salty foods.

I was also surprised and maybe disappointed to see that the Happy Hour choices were pretty limited.  

If we didn&#39;t order the basket of bread, I might have been hungry.  The butter for the bread was good, but it was a little too salty for my liking.

***********
FINAL THOUGHTS:
Overall, The Whale Wins was a nice experience, with good customer service and pretty tasty food. 

There are some things to take into consideration (see above), but I would be interested in trying their new menu when they change it up."

We came here with some out of town guests - having eaten at the Walrus and the Carpenter earlier in their visit (guess you can say we&#39;re Renee Erickson fans!)

A bit expensive, but worth it. 

We started with the pickled veggies, and had a custom request for a few pieces of cheese paired with some fruit spread and the sliced ham. For a total of 6 people it was probably a bit much for a starter but everything was tasty! 

4 shared the fresh salad, which was delicious and crisp. My boyfriend and I shared the Cote de Boeuf (which is $80 but when split is totally comparable to the other dishes!) - we had tons of leftovers and could have absolutely shared 4 ways, especially given the other items we ordered. We also got the roasted carrots with yogurt. Two others shared the salmon, and the final two shared the salmon mousse and clams. Happy campers all around!"

Service for me gets 5 stars as ours was attentive, sweet, and also very on-point speed and accuracy wise. She was even kind enough to split the check 11 ways. 11!

The food was also quite impressive and not as expensive as it could have been (minus the 70 dollar piece of cow a bunch of us shared). Living in Seattle for 5 years, great food never really gets old and The Whale Wins certainly delivered, with the most notable dishes being the Sardine Toast (it wasn&#39;t Sardine-y tasting at all... other than the sardine. It had a nice acidic, but meaty complexity to it... As others have reported, the flavor and texture was great) and also the Cote de Boeuf which had such great flavor for such a huge-arse slab of meat. For 70 dollars, the bunch of us that ordered it to share were not let down. Trust me... You&#39;ll just have to try it. Everyone was impressed!

Finally, the atmosphere was wonderful. I am really enjoying this whole white marble, bistro lighting, woodfire grille thing Seattle has going on. Not to mention, the restaurant opened up to the outside in the front, allowing a wonderful breeze to pass through and an alright view of the sky and sidewalk... Great for those lazy Summer Seattle days. Due to everything I just described, I would definitely return!"

Our meals consisted of butter on bread. Fish on bread. Grease on bread. More fish on bread. And for dessert, butter-dredged, salted bread. 

They also had exactly four entrees to choose from, two of which were shellfish that you have to pick yourself, and one of which was beef for two people only. 

I also found the seating arrangement very unpleasant. We were seated 3 inches away from the other tables. The people next to us were yelling and gesticulating wildly and we couldn&#39;t even hear the waiter over these two doofuses. 

I wouldn&#39;t go back. It&#39;s expensive. It&#39;s pretentious. Its packed like sardines. And they add an involuntary 20% gratuity, which I would have been happy to give, since our waiter was excellent, but I don&#39;t like the idea of the restaurant forcing it on their customers.

Surprisingly it wasn&#39;t very crowded so getting a seat was very easy.

The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. It has a simple and elegant feel to it. The weather was nice so we sat outside on their patio to enjoy our meal. 

1. Matiz Sardines on toast: Usually when I see sardines on the menu, I stay clear of it, but I was told this was a must try. The connotation of Sardines to me is that they are stinky, slimy, and extremely salty, however this was not the case at all. It was actually very good and lightly salted.The toast had a crisp crunchy outside and a soft fluffy inside (perfection). The tomato paste was light and airy. It complimented the sardine very well. To top it off, there was shaved fennel on top that added this vinegary taste that tied everything together. The crunch from the fennel was also a nice texture change from the soft paste and sardine. 

2. Pork Rillette: This was smooth, creamy, and light. It was spread like butter. The pickled onion on top added a sweet vinegar taste which was delightful! The grian mustard added another explosion of flavor that gave this toast an extra kick. 

3. Passion Fruit Batida. This is the perfect summer cocktail! It&#39;s sweet, tangy, and very refreshing. A really elegant drink. 

Next time I plan to try the Painted Hills Cote de Boeuf. A 32 oz piece of meat meant to be shared between two people. I was given rave reviews about it, so I will have to return and try this out.

I had a wonderful first time experience and I can&#39;t wait to come back. The owners also run the Walrus and The Carpenter, which is now next on my list of places to check out."

When we mentioned this to the waitress, and asked her to tell the chef, there wasn&#39;t much of a response. Usually, I would expect the chef to make a visit to the table, but I guess they don&#39;t do that here. The salmon was great, but overall the experience was not as good as I would have expected for the amount of money they charge for a meal. The pickle plate was good though."

As a place to gather with friends and share some plates and drinks it&#39;s a great choice but I found the dishes to be better as ideas than fully realized.

TL:DR: trendy place with shared plates and hipster vibe. Every dish I had reminded me of a dish I&#39;ve had a another hipster place in NYC, San Francisco, Austin or Portland. The space is crowded, noisy and the service was casual to the point of being non-existant. The portions were San Francisco/NYC tasting menu tiny and while the ingredients were very fresh and I am sure of the highest quality the food was not as elevated as the ingredients.

This is a place that is best with a group of friends and a full wallet. Probably one of the more happening and trendy places in Seattle, a second visit isn&#39;t really needed."

My husband was very unhappy with his meal here. He did not particularly want anything on the menu (exception being the jamon and butter, but he complained that the meat was not sliced to his preference). He hated that &#34;the special&#34; was brussel sprouts and thought that the clams were gritty. The idea of gritty clams is truly loathsome, but the sauce that they came in had good flavor. 
I liked the salad that came with the bone marrow, however, I prefer my bone to be split in half so that I can eat it without all the uncivilized poking and digging. 
I thought the menu was good - I actually like brussel sprouts and eton mess - but it&#39;s not a menu that will please everyone."

We had several small plates and loved the sauce on each one (liked loved the sauce so much we cleaned the plates with our bread!).  Sliced sirloin on toast, fabulous bread, chicken wings, smoked potatoes and an asparagus dish with feta-like cheese and a butter sauce that almost tasted like butterscotch and was very wonderful.  Dates for dessert.  Everything was wonderful.  
Server wasn&#39;t too friendly and I guess she was grossed out by our behavior of eating the leftover sauce with the bread.  She kept trying to take the plates away while we were still eating.  Yes, I guess it&#39;s bad manners to wipe up the sauce but when I asked her to leave them several times, she should have given up on us with our terrible manners instead of just taking them away.  That seemed rude of her."

The restaurant has a lovely ambiance. The food is high quality, farm fresh and well made. Everything I had was decent, but overall nothing really blew me away. 

We ate:

- Dinah&#39;s cheese with raspberry jam 
- Lettuces, herbs, pistachio and Parmesan
- Sliced tomato anise hyssop aioli, toasted buckwheat
- Whipped feta on toast with peaches 
- Roasted half chicken
- Yogurt pannacotta with peaches 

The whipped feta on toast with the peaches was incredible and probably the only thing that I would have a hankering to eat again. 

Some of the portion sizes were ridiculously small. I understand the concept of small plates, but three slices of a tomato (not even the whole tomato!) for $14 is a bit ridiculous."

The decor and ambiance was quirky and modern and overall really rather enjoyable. Our server appeared immediately and had a lot of great advice for us about the menu. The attentive and well-paced service throughout our 2.5 hour visit was actually one of the highlights.

The food was extremely fresh and everything tasted quite good (especially the whipped feta with peaches on toast. Not on the online menu - maybe a seasonal item?) but most of the dishes we ordered were not particularly memorable. The portion sizes also felt a little ridiculous. A few slices of bread with Brie and jam for $9? Three slices of tomato and aioli for $14? These small plates are definitely not designed to be shared by more than 2 people.

Happy Hour

Sardine Tartine - I cannot tell you how much I love sardines in any variation.  WW offers a unique option:  Crunchy toast with a sauce that ties the fennel greens and sardine together.  A tad heavy-handed with the tomato sauce, that could be toned down as to let the fish shine on its own merit.

Roasted Clams - no.  I could never comprehend why or how Rockwell beans, or any bean for that matter, could complement clams.   Bland lemongrass and creme based broth and beans make this a dull dish.  

Pork Shoulder - full of flavor and pop.  A knife&#39;s provided but not needed as my fork easily cuts the soft meat.  Some type of starchy side or veggies need to accompany the pork as it feels so alone and incomplete. 

The limited &#34;Whale Call&#34; Happy Hour starts at 3 pm and sadly ends at early at 5 pm so the likelihood of making it here often is slim to none.  Nice option otherwise."

I have eaten here over a dozen times. My most recent visit may be my last. Since the minimum wage increase they have decided to raise prices and cut portion sizes. It should be one or the other, not both!! I have always ordered the lettuces salad, which is delicious, but what I received the other night was half the size as it has been every time in the past. Every other dish we ordered was also more expensive, and smaller than they were before. 

The dishes are usually good, but they don&#39;t mix up the menu very often. I also find the beer list to be slightly annoying. It&#39;s all 20 oz. pours of mediocre beer for around $10 each. Why can&#39;t I just get a 10-12 oz. beer for around $5? 

This place is simply far too expensive now for what you get. It used to be a good deal and delicious food. Now I find it way overpriced and boring. There is also a gratuity automatically added to the bill. I am not a fan of this new charge. I like to tip what I feel is deserving, and it&#39;s usually more than 18%. I think this should be left up to the customer to decide.

My wife and I were up in Seattle this weekend visiting our girls at college, delivering snow tires for our oldest and a printer to our youngest. Well, I made reservations for this incredible restaurant called The Whale Wins in Fremont, Washington. My fellow Yelper Rachel H. reviewed The Whale Wins back in August of 2013, which was a great read and I immediately bookmarked the restaurant on my iPhone. I went to their website for more details on their menu and cuisine and was very excited that their menu was in a PDF format which made it easy to print out and discuss their cuisine in more detail with the family.

I booked a reservation a couple of days in advance for 7:30pm for five, hoping that my daughter&#39;s boyfriend would be able to join us as well. We arrived about ten minutes prior to dining and found the place packed.  As you enter the restaurant, the bar is behind a glass wall to your left and the dining area opens up to your right; all tables on both sides were occupied. Now I understand why they called me to confirm our reservation; the place was extremely busy. It was the first time a restaurant has ever called me to confirm my reservation. There did not seem to be a hostess but we were asked right away if we had reservations and were seated by 7:35pm. We loved the energy and atmosphere and were very surprised that the noise was not deafening with such a packed house. It was actually very pleasant.

Now let&#39;s talk about the food: it was amazing! Remember everything is served family-style so every dish from the salad, to the clams, pate, bone marrow, pork shoulder, and bone-in rib eye was shared and we just ate each dish as it was brought to the table. Fantastic evening! I would recommend this restaurant all day long. It should be on every foodie&#39;s bucket list. Thank you The Whale Wins for the great memories and being an extended part of my community!

P.S. Just a couple of things: My wife and I occupied three washing machines and dryers in our hotel to do our youngest&#39;s laundry the first night we got into town. The things we do for the children we love! Also, the bone-in rib eye was two pounds and one of the top five steaks I have ever had!"

I must say this was one of the most memorable meals I have had this year. 

My wife and I ordered the steak for two. The meat was amazing . Well seasoned and cooked perfectly. 

To cap off our meal we ordered the zucchini  bread. It was surprisingly good! It just had the right a mount of sweetness and the cream it was served with was wonderful. 

The vibe of this place was cozy but still had this cool factor. Excellent service . Definitely a place to check out when in Seattle."

That&#39;s a lie, I loved it for it&#39;s name before I even stepped foot inside. A big reason I came here was because of my love for the ocean and nautical things...so the name is what drew me in. The space is open, bright, warm and inviting. I adored the wooden tables to the simple linen napkins to the minimalistic feel of the entire space. I made reservations and since it was early we were seated quickly with no problems. 

The servers were very accommodating, helpful, friendly and overall seemed to really enjoy being there. 

I started with the bees knees cocktail (gin, grapefruit, honey) and it wasn&#39;t as strong as I had thought but still really good. Though I did reek of alcohol after but that&#39;s just a thing that happens. We started with the scallop crudo and it was what one would expect, pretty fresh, light, the sauce on that was on point, loved the salt flakes on top. The next small plate was the sardine toast, I know what you&#39;re thinking, ew sardines...but it was the best sardine I&#39;ve ever had. The curried tomato paste that held the sardine to the toast was perfection and the shaved fennel added a nice freshness to it. We also ordered the marinated squid but I didn&#39;t particularly like it, the pickled celery reminded me of relish and that was all I could taste as I ate it. We ordered the chicken to share and the skin on it was so crispy it&#39;s something to write home about, I also was a huge fan of the cherry sauce and roasted turnips. The seasoning was spot on. 

I love Whale Wins and plan on making more trips there."

I&#39;d wanted to try this place for a while and I was really excited to give it a taste. It definitely met my expectations!

I love that the plates are meant to be shared. Portions are here and there - some dishes, like the roast chicken, are meal-sized if split between two people; others, like the cheese plate, are itty bitty. Each dish is inventive and clearly created and arranged with care. I really enjoyed the hummus plate with veggies, and the cauliflower was delish as well. The bread and salted butter were addictive. The cocktails were good, but I wasn&#39;t blown away. The rice pudding with pineapple was interesting - it let the pineapple handle the sweetness, while the rice pudding part was more austere. I really liked it! 

Although I am not as besotted as some with The Whale Wins, nothing missed the mark. We enjoyed a decadent dinner of multiple dishes, spread out over two hours at least, and we were never rushed or given even a side-eye by the efficient staff. I like the clean, marbled aesthetic. I would return gladly."

With BSB, Nsync, and Spice Girls in the background, the Whale had already won me over.  After being served a marvelous plate of roasted Hama Hama clams, my heart was full.  The savory wine-drenched broth that the clams swam in was delicately balanced by the freshness of local greens.  The clams themselves were hearty and cooked to perfection.  I only wish there were more fingerling potatoes to offset the richness of the broth and clams.  

My dining counterparts reveled in the house pickled veggies, roasted chicken, and roasted pork shoulder.  We also all shared the Eton Mess (apple) and Shirlee&#39;s brownie with creme anglaise.  The brownie was VERY rich and dense, but oh-so-satisfying.  The Eton Mess was delightfully light and airy.  I really enjoyed the meringue-like crunchy bites that surrounded a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream and an apple wedge.  Well done, Whale!

Other cool things about The Whale Wins:

-They have a wood-fired stove and open kitchen dining experience.  VERY cool to watch them make your dishes!
-Delicious, fresh ingredients from local purveyors.
-Ample wine and cocktail menu :)

No one knows what I&#39;m referring to when I talk about the restaurant.

They rival Bar Cotto in hiring attractive staff in Seattle proper.  Be aware if you&#39;re ovulating like it&#39;s nobody&#39;s business. 

For someone who enjoys her space extensively, I don&#39;t mind the close seating arrangements here.  The communal table they have would be intimate enough that my gigantic, vicious hair would inadvertently reach over to tickle my neighbor&#39;s nostrils.  I&#39;m a little amused by the thought.

It&#39;s a great hang-out spot or a place to take a hot date.  I have a severe, gag-inducing aversion to what society calls dating but I could suffer a bit for a Whale Wins offer.

Their menu is so small and limited that you have very few choices, which is absolutely perfect.  Having too many choices at restaurants reduces me to being 1.) hostile, or 2.) a deaf mute. 

It&#39;s worth reviewing the menu items they have that is essentially crap slathered on toast.  Really hard toast, too.  Like, so hard I thought the bread had Cialis baked into it.  

The entrees and small plates are all flavorful and plentiful to share among 2 people.  Get the Avocado Toast and the Sardines Tartines.  The avocado toast was unexpectedly good being that it was simply smashed avocado with a green, garlic-spiced butter topped with vinegared arugula.  I was like, ohhhh shitttt, this is better than I had anticipated.

Exceptionally good and friendly service, concise menu, and tasty food?  Not even my high maintenance ass can complain about that."

Bone marrow... ok.

Clams were sooooo tasty, but the whole plate screamed for some bread to soak up the broth. Totally understand that you need to charge for good bread (Girl and the Goat in Chicago has a in house baker and we always ordered the bread because it&#39;s great). But $4~5/order of bread seems a bit high. And for a $20+ dish, I think we deserve a couple slices of toasted bread. Well....we weren&#39;t in the mood for bread anyways.

First the space is beautiful, we were able to get a table near the wood oven and just be able to watch the guy running it work. The thing that kept running through my mind after we ordered was we should have gotten the steak. Started off with the lettuces salad which was very good, the amount of lemon that was in the dressing was just enough and made the whole thing very light and refreshing. We also ordered the sardines on toast because I mean how can you come here and not order that. The sardine were exquisite and the toast was legit as was the tomato spread on the toast. The sardines had an almost tuna like taste to them and it was amazing. For entrees went with the chicken and the clams. Again everything here was really and although the portion sizes were fairly large the meal never felt heavy at any point which is a good thing. For dessert went with the zucchini bread with creme fraiche which was a winner and the rhubarb clafoutis which came with cream. Overall a fantastic meal with great service, the one small knock on this place is that they include a 18.5% service charge for tip which I understand is necessary with some parties over 6 but I wouldn&#39;t expect it at a place like this for a party of 2."

The details of the space from the light fixtures spelling out &#34;HELLO&#34;  and the open kitchen made the dining experience fuzzy warm &amp; welcoming.  Regular tables, patio dining and counter seating options all a plus.  The service was pleasant, food arrived promptly even with a full restaurant and the staff were friendly too.  We were lucky and didn&#39;t have to wait.  Good timing = last two counter seats available.  Our water glasses were always filled and the bartender was our waiter (double duty).  Random observation: the staff all wore matching aprons.

What was ordered?  

Adult beverages:

We started with two glasses of Rose (one dry &amp; one sweet) and ended with two glasses of red (cabernet &amp; syrah).

Starters:

Dinah&#39;s camembert with apricot jam (delish) and some Spanish olives (yummo).  We also ordered the Matiz sardines on toast with curried tomato paste and shaved fennel -- all of the ingredients worked well together.

Vegetable Plate: 

Lettuce salad with herbs, pistachios and parmigiano reggiano.  The salad was perfectly dressed and seasoned.  Crunch and buttery lettuce = heavenly.

Main:

We ordered the serrano ham &amp; butter.  Initially, I had the ham alone with some bread and thought... why butter?  It&#39;s salty enough.  The second bite I sampled was with some butter &amp; ham and wow was it good.  Who would have thought.  I guess I&#39;m a little late in realizing those two work well together.  I&#39;d recommend this and the camembert together.

We also ordered the painted hills filet mignon which was salted, roasted, sliced and served at room temperature.  It came with a sauce verte, fingerling potatoes and fresh horseradish cream.  This was a nice dish, but I personally like my filet warm.  NOTE:  The room temperature thing is clearly noted on the menu.  Anyway the meat reminded me of a much tender version of prime rib.  I really didn&#39;t even need a knife to cut through the meat, the fork worked just fine.  The ingredients and the plating was just right.  Simple, classic and tasty.  Believe it or not my favorite of all of those dishes ordered had to be the sardines on toast.  Simple and delicious.  I wouldn&#39;t mind having it again for lunch.

With all that said though, the whale doesn&#39;t win in my book.  It&#39;s a nice bistro&#39;ish experience with quality ingredients, but I just don&#39;t see myself going back over and over again.  It is however checked off my list of restaurants to try so done and done.  The food was good, but I wouldn&#39;t tell my friends this is a must try restaurant.  It is a place to try at least once though.  If I worked in the area I would probably dine here for lunch on occasion.  Too many room temperature dishes just doesn&#39;t appeal to me.  If I wanted that I would just go to a deli.  I&#39;m still a fan of Walrus &amp; Carpenter."

The Whale Wins is a great seasonal menu with well executed and tasty food.  The carrot salad was amazing and may have been even better than my beloved carrot and avocado salad at ABC Kitchen in NYC.  Whale Wins also had some of the better restaurant cocktails I&#39;ve tasted in a while, including some interesting ingredients such as peach drinking vinegar.  We ordered 3 plates per person which was a reasonable amount of food, focusing more on the vegetables which seemed to be a good choice (as the clams were less impressive).  The heirloom tomatoes were perfectly ripe and seasoned (I don&#39;t even usually like tomatoes).  

The desserts were also awesome.  The zucchini bread was delicious and a perfect mix between sweet and savory.  Also, the giant meringues were perfect.  My husband doesn&#39;t even like meringues and he couldn&#39;t stop eating it due to the gooey center that results from being a meringue of this size.  

My only negative feedback would be on the wine list: the list was almost exclusively Italian and French wine (especially by the glass).  Sure you&#39;re not in California, but with WA/OR producing so much wine, some of it has to be amazing and worthy of being served with this excellent WA food.  If you&#39;re emphasizing the locality of the food, why not do the same with the alcohol?  

This is a destination restaurant for sure.  I&#39;ll definitely be back next time I&#39;m in Seattle."

It made me love cauliflower (which I resisted for years) and if I had every day, I could become a vegetarian (that is saying a lot since my favorite food is steak any time, any day).

The portions are a bit small for the price, but the dishes are distinctive. I did have to eat a bowl of ramen after though."

I had an out of town friend who works in the industry and this was one of the places on the list to try . Since it was on both of our lists, we decided to give it an impromptu try after the Summer Solstice parade.   The wait for a seat was about an hour, but we lucked out because two reserved seats at the bar didn&#39;t show up.  Despite it being packed, service was still fast and friendly.

We both started with a bloody mary.  It was very delicious!   We ordered two vegetable plates, one seafood plate, and one meat plate.  Neither of us were incredible hungry, so this was maybe one plate too much.  Though, we were originally going to order 6 plates, the waiter suggested to knock it down to 4.  Thank you waiter!  Everything was well prepared!  We both loved how everything so was rustic and garden fresh.  Even the carrots looked freshly picked.  The bread for the toasts were all perfectly crunchy.  I ended the meal with a glass of bubbly -- needed to celebrate such a delicious meal.  The meal came to just under $100 which we thought was a surprisingly good cost considering two cocktails, four good sized plates, and a glass of bubbly.  Can&#39;t wait to go back once the menu rotates!"

I&#39;m embarrassed to admit that I hadn&#39;t made it over to visit The Whale Wins since yesterday. I know, I know! And now I really know that I&#39;ve truly missed out.

If you&#39;re like me and you&#39;re a huge fan of Chef Renee Erickson&#39;s other restaurants, this spot will be right up your alley. In fact, I loved how different it was from the Walrus because while they&#39;re both fantastic, this location feels slightly more casual and is much brighter and more open. If it&#39;s a nice day out and you&#39;re in Fremont, you&#39;ve got to pay a visit here.

Indoor seating is plentiful and all tables are near tall, expansive windows. If you want to be outside, there are covered seats and seats in the sunshine. There&#39;s no bad seat or table here.

What&#39;s more, you walk passed fresh baked good and easy take out items just before you sit. Though I haven&#39;t tried on yet, I nearly drooled just eyeing the human head sized meringues topped with crushed pistachios.

The cocktail list is absolutely stellar and the wine selections were solid as well. My friend opted for a passion fruit batida and I ended up just having hibiscus sipping vinegar (shrub) with some soda water. Really delicate and very pretty!

For food the worst problem you&#39;ll have here is deciding. Since we were hungry we just opted for one of each of the small plates. Pork rillette, olives, Dina&#39;s soft cheese and rhubarb jam, house made pickles, and more. Everything was absolutely perfect and extremely reasonably priced.We spent less than $50 and had drinks and food for two.

And though I don&#39;t typically mention them in reviews, the bathrooms were clean and bright. My friend and I had come from shopping for antique jewelry and I did not want to eat without first washing my hands. The soap was even nice! The entire experience here was beyond perfect an exactly what I&#39;d hoped for on a sunny Seattle Sunday afternoon."

Basically, you are forced to pay 20% extra, whether or not your service is good.  This restaurant is simply not worth it.  While the food is ok, it is not special.  The prices are fairly high (dinner for 2 will cost about $100).   Dont waste your time being forced into automatic tipping.  If you enjoy good food, there are plenty of other restaurants in town that are excellent, serve the same level of cuisine and dont force the customer to pay the extra 20% if service is ho hum."

There are many Dishes here that Never Get Old no matter how many times I have them, Dishes have the most Beautiful Presentation, and the Cocktails are so Pretty they easily Get The +1up Thubzzz Up on Instagram.  

Food:

MATIZ SARDINES ON TOAST-  How can something that sounds so simple on Paper  be so Divine! Heads up... I&#39;m not the biggest Sardines Fan, so for this dish to win me over is pretty Amazing.  The Columbia City Bakery Toast straight from Columbia (That Good Stuff) has a Tomato Paste Dolloped on top that is As FluFFY as the Trophy Bowl of Butter that you see at all of Renne Erickson&#39;s Restaurants.   The Paste is very Light and Airy Purre I like to call Ying and mixed with the Sardine I like to Call Mr. Yang it Becomes Super Saiyan.  The Combo mixed with Shaved Fennel screams Turn Down For What it is Unbelievable. You have to try this out to believe it!  (Tip: During HH if you are looking for a wonderful snack to go with your Cocktail please do try this it will elevate your Tasting Palate to be come Oh So ShhhhhMancy Pantsy)

Lamb Taretare- Raw Meat with a Raw Egg on Top to me is one of those things that Food Phrases People Say Like: (Pizza, Hamburger, Ramen, Pho) No Matter if it is WEAKSAUCE or BO$$ $auce I will eat it and it will still be good.  Now this Tare Tare is a lot Leaner than lets say the one at Walrus and the CarPenDoor,  but it is still oh so good.  

HAMA HAMA ROASTED CLAMS-  This is one of my favorite Clam Dishes ever the Broth is so good I wish they Bottled it up in 16.9oz of Bottles and I would drink this like Smart Water.  The Ham, Butta, and Cream is Ty$. 

HERRING RILLETE- Very good love the Colors on this dish.  This is really good but not as good as the Sardine one or my Second Favorite the Duck one at Walrus and The CarPenDoor.

PAINTED HILLS MARROW BONES- So Buttery and DeLiShiOso

BOAT STREET CAFÉ CHICKEN LIVER MOUSSE-  One of the Best Chicken Liver Mousse I have ever had in Seattle So Airy and So FLUFFY.  (I&#39;m Pretty Sure that the Lil Gurl from  Despicable Me Was talking about this when she was Screaming So Phulffy!!

PAINTED HILLS CÔTE DE BOEUF- The 32oz Piece of Beef might be Gigantic for some even to share between two PPL but I find it to be the Perfect Size for me to go along sampling all the other dishes so I Getta Bite of EveryThang &#34;Dim Shum Style&#34;.  The Beef is served Medium Rare I usually go for Rare but this was good. It&#39;s Pan Roasted and with everything it was served with it made me almost prefer Pan Roast Beef over Gilled Beef for a Second!

ROASTED HALF CHICKEN- I don&#39;t eat Chicken Unless it&#39;s Fried, UnFreaKINBelievaBO, since I prefer Red Meats.  But with all the HYPEBEAST I have been hearing about this Chicken I really need to Try it Someday and it is Officially on My Bucket List of Things to Eat!

We were full but couldn&#39;t resist from ordering dessert.  The meringue with cherry preserves was delightful!  Very chewy meringue with the semi-sweet yet tart cherries.

I&#39;ve been here before and the food is pretty decent if you&#39;re in to the family style thing. 

I came here a few weeks ago with a group of people hoping to get seated without a reservation. We couldn&#39;t. It happens. I get it. I should&#39;ve planned better but hey we were in the neighborhood and thought there was no harm in asking. But instead of declining politely or being fake apologetic as is the social norm, we were met with condescension by an eye-rolling jerk of a host. Maybe he was having a bad day. Maybe his mom is dying of cancer. Whatever it was, dude was way too sassy even for me (and I&#39;m a bit of a prick myself)."

Got a great variety of items from brioche toast, beet salad, steak and chicken. Everything was cooked and seasoned excellently. A lot of the food items are already made so may be room temperature. I have no issue with that but it might be surprising for others.

The best meal I&#39;ve had in Seattle in just about my 32 years here was my lunch yesterday at Whale Wins. First, the atmosphere on a sunny day was as good as being in one of Bert&#39;s sidewalk chalk paintings in Mary Poppins. And the waitstaff was friendly, knowledgable, accommodating and as &#34;practically perfect&#34; as Mary Poppins herself.

I had the bread and butter - and holy cow - something so simple, yet done to perfection. I had the cauliflower salad, which sounded like a crapshoot, but what hooked me was the cilantro-garlic aoli and it was a total homerun. And, I shared the filet mignon with my sister, which was hands down, the perfect pieces of thinly sliced meat on a bed of horseradish cream. The prices were soooooo doable. The bread was $4 and worth every penny. The salad was $11 and completely on point. The filet was $16, and quite frankly seemed worth a lot more.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, this place is good, its solid, its enjoyable.....it just didn&#39;t WOW me. For a Chef working at this level, I expect a little wow factor.

Before I start on food and drink, can I take a moment to bitch about the communal table? I just effin HATE those things, almost without exception. The communal table at Revel is great, because its actually a bar. Communal tables suck!! GET RID OF THAT THING PLEASE! I don&#39;t like dining elbow to elbow with the numerous people who have more dollars than sense if you know what I mean!

Cocktails:

SHOCHU THINK YOU CAN DANCE, SHOCHU, YUZU, SALER, ROSEMARY - it was &#34;alright dog&#34;. Not wow - too much ice for the drink - no finesse - just alright, great name though!

SMOKING JACKET, VIDAL MEZCAL, DRY VERMOUTH, AVERNA - solid, it was a  nice drink for sure.

Started off with bread and butter - the bread is good no lie, but hard to knock my socks off there. We ALL love bread, right?

ASPARAGUS, SMASHED AVOCADO, CARAWAY CRACKER, PICKLED MUSTARD SEEDS &amp; POPPYSEEDS - Solid but again not a WOW moment.

MATIZ SARDINES ON TOAST WITH CURRIED TOMATO PASTE
&amp; SHAVED FENNEL - This was the highlight of the meal. REALLY a great dish and one I could eat all day long. This was the wow!

PAINTED HILLS MARROW BONES, JACOBSEN SEA SALT &amp; GOLDEN RAISIN, CAPER &amp; PICKLED SHALLOT RELISH - Solid but not as great as it should have been. I have to admit, I think the ONLY proper way to prepare Marrow bones is cut LENGTHWISE, NOT crosscut. Crosscut doesn&#39;t allow the entire marrow to be properly seasoned and half the goodness ends up drooling out the bottom onto your plate. Renee, PLEASE consider preparing these exactly the same but in lengthwise cut fashion....I promise that everyone will love them much more if you do!

That&#39;s it in a nutshell. It was nice. The atmosphere was nice. It was lively enough. The service was adequate. I just left feeling underwhelmed. I left wishing for more. The press for this place has been RIDICULOUSLY good....and that proves my point about &#34;critics&#34; and &#34;press&#34;, most isn&#39;t worth the paper it is printed on.

If you want a nice experience in a nicely put together place, this will do...if you want a WOW dining experience, wander across the hall to Joule and see what truly great food is about!

3.5 rounded up....maybe someday Yelp will give me a 10 point scale."

This joint situated next to Joule is a must. If you go and decide not to order 5 plates to share between 2 people, then I insist: get the Matiz Sardines $10 (they have happy hour 3-5pm with $3 discount on the plate). It&#39;s a fat, juicy sardine smothered on tomato paste served with shaved fennel for an added crunch -- it&#39;s heaven.

This plate gets a 5-star. I would give it more if I could. 

For a longer review, read further:

When we went at 5pm on a Tuesday, the restaurant was pretty empty. We asked the server if 5 plates was too much and she said no. She was partially correct. By the 3rd plate, you don&#39;t need to eat but you still want to; we definitely could&#39;ve walked away with eating one less plate. Besides the sardines, the other plates were also delicious -- don&#39;t get me wrong -- but I kept questioning their price v. portion.

All the plates were served one by one. Such a tease.

First was the bread the the better. Bread and butter, however fancy, should not cost $4. I don&#39;t think it is worth it unless you order the tomato dish: roasted treviso! It was a plate of thick tomato slices with basil, walnut oil, and peas. Tomatoes are in season so it was quite refreshing. Dip your bread into the oil of this plate and you get your money&#39;s worth (whoop whoop). I wish we had portioned this vegetable dish out to eat with the other entrées that lacked such lightness.

The roast beef on the tartare was cooked medium which made the meat extra chewy. Eat the cherries instead of popping them into your mouth to figure out they are cherries or olives; they are indeed cherries and if you eat them with the tartare, you&#39;ll experience the yummy combo of savory with a hint of sweet. 

DON&#39;T GET BONE MARROW - Now, we ordered the dish looking at the yelp highlights. I&#39;m very dependent on that section but I&#39;m telling you now: you will seriously question the price v. portion for this dish. I personally grew up eating oxtail soup and thus, I had high hopes for this plate and I was utterly disappointed. The plate looks fancy, but the actual food on the plate is less than a handful. The vegetable toss that came with the plate was cringingly salty and marrow is just marrow. The server said it was buttery and soft -- no, it&#39;s just marrow. 

The kitchen, I realized, is quite open. It&#39;s fun to see all the matching chefs and servers mingling in the beautiful venue. I&#39;m already thinking about my next visit. Yes to Whale Wins!"

Family favorite for fried chicken. My favorites are actually the sides - collared greens, potatoes, &amp; slaw. Beans available in the warmer months. The chicken is amazing (so flavorful &amp; crispy) but the waffles are even better. Eat there if you can. There&#39;s a really small dining space but so well worth it. Order everything!

The way the chicken is seasoned and cooked superb. It is ridiculously good and juicy and the waffles. Let me tell you about the waffles, they compliment the chicken as it should. It has its own flavor and a nice crust around the edges. The syrup they make is a subtle sweet and savory.  I&#39;m a first timer when it comes to collard greens, so don&#39;t take my word for it when I say they are good. I like greens in general but my eating partner said they should have been a lot saltier. I didn&#39;t mind the lack of salt. 

The environment itself is cute, small, cozy, and quaint. There is memorabilia that I&#39;m sure is personal to the owner. I like that it&#39;s smaller because it&#39;s more intimate and the service is great. I&#39;m sure the owner was the man cooking my chicken and he was just a gem. I felt like I was a guest in his home. He also gets an A+ for sharing his pickled peppers with me that just sent shit through the roof. One last thing,  it&#39;s a coffee shop and a chicken joint.

The chicken is fried is small batches in cast iron pots right in front of you. It&#39;s delicious you get 12 pieces for 24 bucks that&#39;s great pricing.

The breading on the chicken is nice and peppery with just the right amount of crunch, and has been very soft and tender the two times I&#39;ve eaten here.

Since they are such a small operation, they often run out of certain sides and cuts by the end of the night on weekends. I&#39;m pretty much here just for chicken and waffles, though, and even after a busy Friday they will still probably have some of those two things for you. I am not a cole slaw eater, but I liked their take on it -- fresh cold cabbage with a nice crunch and what seemed to be a non-mayo, sweetish poppy-seed (I think) dressing."

Traffic karma despite the random road projects this weekend, plus a Mariners game, me and the family decided to head over to Harry&#39;s Chicken Joint in West Seattle for the first time. We arrived just as they opened at 4pm and got seated in a window booth adorned with rooster and hen curtains. Clean, homey, and incredible smells coming from the cooking line. 

Incredible customer service with actual personable interaction and conversation with the owner and wife team. Same thing observed at the table next to us also. 

Hydrated with ice water, kiddo had an orange soda ($2, from Port Angeles and bottled in Mukilteo, a liquefied creamsicle!), while we perused the menu. 

Here&#39;s the run down pretty much eating family style and sharing bites all around:
2 Chicken Tenders and Biscuit with Lamb Gravy ($6)
Half a Draper Valley Chicken (6 pieces, $13)
Mashed Potatoes and Lamb Gravy ($2)
Collard Greens ($3)
2 Chicken Tenders and 2 Waffles with Syrup ($8)

The chicken tenders and waffles definitely edged out Nate&#39;s Chicken and Waffles over in Rainier Beach. 

The fried chicken was tender, not greasy, and had a complex seasoned dredging. The drumstick was slightly underdone, but I just ate around it. (BTW - hours later, I&#39;m AOK) It&#39;s cool to see the prep done in cast iron skillets! 

The lamb gravy is tasty, but probably for future visits to ask for it on the side. I&#39;d like to also be able to sample &#39;naked&#39; biscuits since there was a honey bear on the table. Their biscuits are delicious, but I&#39;d like to taste them either plain or with honey. The husband noted they reminded him of former Sammie Sue&#39;s on Capitol Hill. More of the traditional baking powder/buttermilk variety, different than the crunchy sconey texture found at Morsel, or the monstrous ones at Biscuit Bitch.

Today they were out of Pork Belly, so the kiddo was treated to a work-in-progress inspired by a sous-vide prep and chef/owner&#39;s visit to Canlis. No name for it yet, but here I&#39;ll just call them Tender Pork Tots. A trio were brought out with Thai chili sauce and a garnish of their North Carolina style cole slaw. The pork was extremely tender and flavorful. Quality control checked by the kiddo deemed them &#39;epic&#39;. Hopefully, it&#39;ll make a future special or menu item. 

Worth the trek from Shoreline!"

So, I let the navigation send me over to West Seattle and of course this place is on California Ave pretty close to Beveridge Place Pub.  

We came late in the afternoon on a Monday so had the entire place to ourselves.   This is a laid back cozy unpretentious diner where you can see the chicken being fried in these large cast iron buckets.  There&#39;s some nice jazz music in the background coming from a vintage amplifier with a warm analog feel.

The menu is quite simple, you have chicken, sometimes pork belly and a few staples like mashed potatoes, greens, cole slaw, etc...  Almost exactly what you&#39;d take to a picnic.  I really like the personal touch and we felt like sharing the kitchen with some family friends as we talked it up with the owners.  I really like giving money to family businesses.

The chicken was freshly fried and pretty tasty.  Not anything that blew me away, but was good and had to order some more as 1/2 chicken wasn&#39;t enough.   I really liked the vinegar based cole slaw as you never see this very often.

Didn&#39;t get the pork belly, but we&#39;ll be back for it next time.  Hint, call ahead if you&#39;re looking for the pork belly to make sure it&#39;s there.  Also, I can see picking up the chicken here and heading over to Beveridge Pub as they have no beer."

The staff was super friendly, chatting with me while my chicken simmered -just 12 minutes.

The chicken was effing delicious! It was juicy without being greasy and the seasoning was great and complex. I also got the chicken and biscuit and it was great. The lamb gravy tasted great but it did get to be a little much, though, because it was pretty heavy. 

The menu is simple and dishes other than the whole and half chicken are very reasonable and it is fun and easy to mix and match with a friend.

Things sampled:

half fried chicken ($12) 6pieces.  All the chicken is skillet fried (not deep fried) which gives a nice crust.  The breading is a bit unconventional, more bready and herby than most.  The chicken&#39;s are sourced from Draper Valley (cruelty free) and are of good quality.  I wouldn&#39;t call this your mama&#39;s southern fried chicken but I thought it was very yummy! A full chicken is 12 pieces for $24. 

Chicken and Waffles ($8) breakfast and chicken!  what can be better?

biscuits with gravy ($2) biscuits were good. Gravy kind of tangy

Harry&#39;s tenders are very tasty without being over-spiced, the spuds are real, and the lamb / rosemary gravy is an unexpected ally for fried chicken.

I commented about the taste and the fact that the chicken was not cooked completely. It has been 2 years since the last time that I have had his chicken. During that time, he has received accolades from many of the local magazines.  I have had a week to think about this and I have come to the conclusion that it is the preparation of his chicken the gives him the ratings that he has enjoyed. His prep is as follows: a 24-hour buttermilk brine, the flouring, the smoking, and taking the time to cook it in a cast-iron skillet.  The day I visited, I has 1/2 chicken, a biscuit, gravy , and mashed potatoes. The Mashed potatoes have the skin and are fantastic - would have ordered seconds. No overly creamy or lumpy and no other place does this. The biscuit is heavenly and would love to have that recipe. Fluffy, crunchy and big - true biscuits. The gravy is the most tasteless that I have ever had and it is worth dumping or working with someone to find a good flavor. Biscuits and gravy are a mainstay and should be memorable or don&#39;t make it. 
Chicken: While the prep of the chicken is unique, here is where it falls apart for me.  The cast-iron skillet is a nice touch but the chick texture is rubbery and a bit salty. The smoked flavor is unique but unsure if necessary, but it is what makes his chicken different than all the rest.  He tests to see if the chicken is done by using a thermometer. This is the problem.  Those of us that have been frying chicken all of our loves never use this and the chicken is never rubbery and is always done.  His chicken remains pink and slightly bloody at the center- this is a big turnoff for me. I recommend trying Ezell&#39;s, popeyes and Mary&#39;s Chicken, and Jackson&#34;s catfish corner.  It is not that I think that these places are the best ever, but the prep and cooking of the chicken is what you should compare. I believe you can be creative in how you prepare your fried chicken, but you have to cook it thoroughly. Until this happen, this place will not get a : Must have this chicken&#34; from me."

Having said that, I&#39;ve only read about the accolades as far as their fried chicken is concerned, and as it is my taste buds&#39; quest to find the best friend chicken in Seattle, this place was a worthwhile try. My friend who recently in the W. Seattle Neighborhood, asked me if I wanted to go here. I wasn&#39;t about to trek to his neighborhood, but I said I would be open to order a takeout and try the fried treats. We ordered the half a chicken and a side of coleslaw and potato salad. Somehow, they forgot to put the potato salad in the bag.

The fried chicken came as different cut parts: thigh, legs and fried tenders. They certainly looked amazing, a tad browner than most. At the first bite, I basically knew I was only going to have one piece, as the seasoning and taste were quite off with me. The chicken was moist and seems to be marinated as the taste permeated in the meat. It definitely had a smokey flavor, and for my own personal taste was off putting as I didn&#39;t expect this from FC. Also the seasoning was overpowering, not the usual accompaniment that just had a slight lingering taste  -- was it too much sage??? If I can describe even more, if you&#39;ve ever had a Kielbasa sausage, that&#39;s basically how it tasted- and same smokiness. I&#39;ve only tried the latter twice, and haven&#39;t since as I don&#39;t particularly enjoy  the flavor. Although the crispy coating was there, the oiliness was just too much.

The slaw was somewhat good, but again, I think this is again of a personal taste. I don&#39;t eat raw onion, and there was just too much in this slaw for my taste. I removed the onion slivers, but even after doing so, it was still quite pungent and strong.If you like onions you will  probably enjoy this side.

I don&#39;t know if I would venture to try other things with the FC ie waffles-- but it would miss the mark if one didn&#39;t enjoy one as the two goes hand in hand.

PS I recommend this place, as many do -- but for my personal taste it missed the mark."

The chicken: perfectly juicy and moist on the inside, perfectly crisp and flavorful on the outside
The waffles: holy pig!...get the prosciutto in those waffles! perfectly fluffy insides covered in perfect crisp outsides - even with the syrup
The syrup: what??? plum maple syrup??? with a bit of tang, it helps cut through the sweetness and compliments the waffles and chicken.

The only reason for 4 out of 5 stars...I would actually prefer an option for straight up maple syrup. I&#39;m not a huge tangy fan but it works in this case and I WILL be back for more.

And, seriously, the BEST service I&#39;ve experienced in a very long time.  They really make you feel at home...like you&#39;re in their home and they love having you there. It was the most loveliest time.  Thank you!!"

My husband and I had a half order of fried chicken, mashed potatoes and biscuits with gravy (lamb in the    gravy today). It was plenty of food and we brought home left overs!

It didn&#39;t matter that a whole chicken cost nearly $40, or that the sides were &#34;meh&#34; at best, or that one had to reserve their chicken nearly two weeks in advance. Nay, I evangelized about Ma&#39;Ono to anyone who would listen. Best fried chicken in Seattle? No, I said, this may be the best fried chicken west of Chicago and north of San Francisco.

Well, now I am going to have to issue quite a few retractions of that bold statement. Overly bold, in fact. Why? Because I have been to Harry&#39;s Chicken Joint, and it exceeds Ma&#39;Ono in nearly every respect.

Let&#39;s start with the chicken. $24 for a whole fried chicken. With sides, it&#39;ll feed four hungry people. The chicken is lightly fried, includes herbs in the breading, and is brined so it&#39;s extremely moist under the breading. As far as quality, Harry&#39;s makes no claims that its fried chicken is organic/local/sustainable, but the taste of the meat is up there with anything I&#39;ve had from any fried chicken joint that advertises their chicken as such. The chicken may fail the Portlandia-ish &#34;Is it local?&#34; question, but in a blind taste test, most people would never know.

How about the sides? They&#39;re mostly well executed. I have never been much of a fan of mashed potatoes, but the yellow potatoes that Harry&#39;s serves taste extremely good. Cole slaw is flavorful and doesn&#39;t have that yucky blast of mayo that lots of cole slaw has. The &#34;hobo baked beans&#34; have a great smoky taste and include bacon. And the side dishes are great for sharing and cost $2 each...

I would love to come here, get takeout, and picnic on Alki, but my fear is that the chicken would be gone before we got to Admiral Way.

Go to Harry&#39;s if you care for fried chicken at all. Life is too short to eat KFC or pay too much for Ma&#39;Ono."

It&#39;s a tiny place with only 4 tables and 7 bar stools around the kitchen for a very homey, cozy ambiance. Paintings and pictures with meaning to the owners dot the wall along with a clock that says &#34;Time for Harry&#39;s Chicken&#34; which is cute.  They serve vintage sodas like orange cream, ginger beer and honey cream.  

We each ordered a batch of chicken strips with the plum sauce and red pepper aioli dips and a side of the hobo beans.  We were greeted very warmly, almost apologetically by the who we assume was Harry&#39;s wife and by Harry.  They&#39;re both very hospitable and truly nice people who want you to be comfortable and enjoy the food.  Even the cook is very friendly and likes asking guests how they liked the food, mentioning this is the first job he&#39;s had where he was at liberty to do that.  The staff were a little distracted because they received a call for a birthday party of 12 just at the time we ordered and they were trying to figure out how to accommodate that many people in such a tight space.  (Described above.)  As a result, we were just in time to get our order before they had to start telling guests coming in that there was a 45 minute wait.  

The only hitch in the visit was the food.  While it came out piping hot, crisp and fresh, the meat inside moist for strips, the batter is very salty and aside from the buttermilk, not very rich in the flavor that such a beautiful golden, herbed crust promises.  I even tried dipping it in the plum sauce but nothing really salvaged it and my mouth was clamoring for water after I finished.  The beans were kissed with something like honey and bacon but were a little too sweet for me.  For S, they were okay.  I&#39;m hoping it may have been the circumstance of it being a busy day and near the end of the day.  They made a mistake by only charging us for one order of strips and when we pointed it out, Harry said not to worry about it because he felt we didn&#39;t get a smooth experience.  I left a big tip instead as a protest.  :)  

We&#39;d love to give this place one more try if only because it&#39;s so rare to find a place as down to earth and genuine as Harry&#39;s.  It&#39;s one of the few times I can remember receiving that level of hospitality in a restaurant and I can&#39;t see not rewarding it with our continued patronage!"

There is a LOT to like about Harry&#39;s. The staff are all charming and friendly, the decor makes you feel like you&#39;re in someone&#39;s house in the Deep South, and everything is made from scratch.

Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t find the food to match up with all the other things they got right.  The chicken was juicy with an interesting crust, but it was almost completely flavorless, which is not something I generally expect when it comes to fried chicken.  I got a side of potatoes with bacon gravy, and while the potatoes were good, the gravy had a really odd sweetness to it I found off-putting.  Maybe it was an off night or something?"

The fried chicken tasted more like fried ham. I wasn&#39;t fond of it, but the others seem to love it, so I guess it&#39;s preference. You could go try it out and find out yourself. But I won&#39;t be going back there. 

The chicken wasn&#39;t salty nor overcooked, but the meat itself tasted and felt like ham. It just wasn&#39;t the juicy fried chicken I was looking for. 

I was also not impressed with the slaw. It was extremely sweet, and had too much celery seeds. I like celery, but it was overpowering."

Their batter is a little different than some might be used to but oh my god it is filled with flavor! Spicy and herbaceous it is crisp as can be (even after taking it home) and still moist and tender on the inside. The batter also sticks to the chicken perfectly, I hate getting fried chicken and having the best part fall off.

I also ordered one of the seasonal sides, squash and black beans that was beautifully sautéed with a bit of onion. I love my veggies and they had quite a few options which I really appreciate. The biscuit was slap yo&#39; mama good. Seriously. I honestly have no idea how they got them so light.

I will admit along with the others that the gravy could use a bit more seasoning, but holy frijoles fellow yelpers! Must you be so dramatic?!? So I picked up the salt and pepper shaker for the gravy, big whoop! For those of you so wildly offended by the gravy I suggest you do the same next time before going ballistic! Fried chicken is not exactly a heart healthy food and your stress level over gravy is definitely not gonna help you out in the coronary department!

While I stood there I noticed a bowl of what looked like partially cooked chicken in a bowl beside the fryer.   I wondered if it was sitting there long.   I came home with half a chicken and slaw.  The chicken had a lot of spices in the crispy heavy coating.  It had a taste that I can&#39;t identify but I wasn&#39;t sure I liked it but being as I was pretty hungry, I ate 3 pieces.  The slaw was good, vinegary, while I prefer the creamy variety.  

Around 2:30 am, I awoke with an unbelievable pain in the middle of my stomach.  I don&#39;t recall this happening to me before.   It lasted a good 30 minutes while I propped myself up in bed waiting for something to happen.   Nothing did, and eventually I fell back to sleep but believe me it was the type of pain you don&#39;t want happening again.

It looks like they haven&#39;t changed any of the configuration from when the space housed Meander&#39;s so the same small counter and few tables remain. 

The folks running the joint were very friendly, and while we waited we eavesdropped on the owner telling another patron how he got started in the business.

My wife and I split a half chicken with the ginger plum sauce plus two sides and it was more then enough food. The star of the fried chicken is the breading. It was very reminiscent of what I used to eat at my grandmother&#39;s house growing up - a bit heavy and greasy but in a good way. Our sides were beans and mashed potatoes with gravy. Both were good and at a great price point ($2 each).

Overall, recommended due to good food and a very welcoming staff."

I would say that if you are looking for Southern style fried chicken this is NOT the place to get it.

BUT, what they do have is very special and very very yummy. Such a unique breading and spices combo, that it does not taste like anywhere else. 

The man and I sat at the counter and chatted with the cook while we waited for our to go order. He is clearly very into making chicken and went over all the tricks and techniques used.

Their dipping sauces are often mad science experiments of condiments you already know and love, and all of them are interesting or good (or both) and change regularly. As much as I do like their whole chicken, my soft spot is for their strips.

I usually hate chicken strips. Even at Heaven Sent and Ezells they are too dry for me, just not worth eating. But here they are juicy, yummy flavorful dream strips. So worth the wait. And they come with sides. 

Try all the sides, chat with the very nice owners and hostess/waitress and the chef. The people who own this place are passionate about their business and make it a very warm and friendly establishment to visit.

Everything seems right. The whole menu is made from scratch.  It&#39;s family-run, humble, and makes fried chicken in the truest way (cast-iron skillet).  Side dishes are great and an insane deal at $2 each.

This is where the hero in the chicken story loses his way.

The fried chicken, perfect as it should be, just doesn&#39;t have that much flavor.  Given the holy trinity of salt, grease, and chicken, I attempted to rebalance this triforce of flavor by adding a little salt, which is something I don&#39;t do at places that are already fantastic.  The salt did bring out some more flavor, but... something was still missing.

I tried three of the sides - potatoes/gravy, biscuit/gravy, baked beans w/ bacon.  The biscuit and gravy had good texture, and the potatoes were pretty good, but again I found myself yearning for a bit more flavor.

Lastly, while I like the homestyle decor, it, too, lacked soul.  For something this authentic, I wanted to feel like it was tied to some roots somewhere - Louisiana? Georgia? Anywhere? A good soul food spot needs context.

The theme here is the pervasive blandness.  I don&#39;t even have constructive suggestions, so perhaps I should be keeping my mouth shut.  I wanted to like this place SO BADLY, and I really liked the people, but I just don&#39;t see myself going back.

I recommend you try it for yourself, because we can always use more made-from-scratch restaurants in the world, and I respect their efforts here."

First of all, nobody cared to answer the phone for the first two hours they were open when I was curious as to if they did take out. Then when I went in, the smoke from the kitchen was filling the dining room so much, that I literally had to stand outside and wait for my food because I couldn&#39;t breathe. Terrible ventilation. Also, since this is a chicken joint, I expected that they were serving classic fried chicken. And although I can&#39;t pick and choose what they serve, I feel as if their menu description was lacking something about what they were serving. I felt that the breading to chicken ratio was completely off. I literally had some pieces of &#39;chicken&#39; that didn&#39;t even have any meet on it. Just fried bread. 

Maybe the food would have been better if my lungs weren&#39;t filled with smoke."

We really liked Harry&#39;s chicken recipe.  There are spices under the skin and in the buttermilk batter that give it a unique, wonderful flavor, and we also liked how crispy and smoky it was.

The chicken is brined which equals out to a beautifully moist chicken, even the breast (which is most likely to dry out). The breading is just the right amount of crispy, and it doesn&#39;t fall off the skin! This means that each and every bite gets you breading, rather than the KFC classic which usually gets you a mouthful of breading followed by several bites of plain chicken. The chicken they use is also of a good quality, and the smoky flavor is just perfect.

They rotate sides, and are always trying new specials. If you don&#39;t like a dish, I highly recommend you let them know, they are WANTING your feedback so they can improve and refine dishes they are trying to make to please YOU as the customer. The crew is always friendly and good for a chat, and the owner is not afraid to think outside the box when it comes to new ideas, their latest being a sous vide machine (how many hole-in-the-wall places have these?!!)

I ate here the other night, and once again the chicken was fantastic, I meant to save it until I got home, instead I ended up eating 3 out of 4 pieces before I even got home, and it made my commute that much more enjoyable

Well, I was pleasantly pleased, the fried one half chicken and chicken strips was delicious! Unfortunately, they were out of the red pepper aioli sauce, but the sriracha mayo was pretty good. I wasn&#39;t too fond of the gravy, but hey--the sides made up for that ten fold. Collard greens, mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. Yum!

When you walk in you have to be prepared. It&#39;s very small, the diner counter has room for 8. They cook to order, so it&#39;s a bit of a wait. Pretty much a no frills, but very friendly. It may be in need of a woman&#39;s touch decorating wise, but who cares?! It&#39;s a &#34;Chicken Joint.&#34; 
  Their portions of chicken are huge, about twice the size of Ezell&#39;s. The batter is thick and heavy with oil but that&#39;s because of their frying method, it&#39;s very old-school and should be appreciated for that. Rich smoke flavor and definitely a fried bird you can recommend. 
  Best advice, if you get a hankering for fried chicken, call them up and put your order in to-go. You can skip the wait and get ready to enjoy huge helpings of fried goodness."

It didn&#39;t live up to the flavor present in other components, but everything else is so good you don&#39;t need the gravy anyway.  I was also very excited about their soda selection, only to be disappointed that the soda was room temperature.

I had the chicken and waffles which came with 2 medium sized waffles and a few strips of chicken breast, and drizzled with a maple/plum sauce that was an excellent compliment to the dish.  He had the 12th Man Special, which was their normal half chicken dish.  Great spice and smoke on the chicken.

I love the idea, but like very little of the food.  The chicken batter is completely overwhelmed by thyme - way, way too much unless thyme is your favorite food.  I really wish they had a non-herb version of their chicken.  It also drives me absolutely crazy that they fry the chicken in quarters, with the thigh and drumstick still attached.  a) this makes the chicken much more difficult to eat. b) it decreases the crunch to chicken meat ratio, and doesn&#39;t everyone want more batter and crunch on their fried chicken?  The side dishes (slaw and potato salad) were both pretty lackluster as well."

I like their sides, especially the coleslaw and baked beans, and they are pretty cheap too! My only complaints are that they do not have mac &amp; cheese as a side and their hours are always changing.

Outside is kind of ghetto. Inside is clean. 
This was my second time having Ethiopian food. The first time was in San Jose. And it was very good   

Sunset cafe didn&#39;t disappoint me. I had sunset Combe. It came with lamb, beef, chicken, lentil and another vegeies.  Everything was exception. I couldn&#39;t remember what was what. 
All meats were tender and flavorful. They had a lot of spices. And some were a bit spicy. 

You eat the meat with crepe   U loved the crepe. It was pillow soft with a little tartness. 

The combo plate $12.99 was big. It could feed 2-3 people. It was inexpensive. 

I love to come back again if I am in this area."

While he doesn&#39;t have a personal favorite outside of his mom&#39;s cooking -- understandable because she really is an incredible cook -- my favorite used to be Lalibela in the CD, which closed down years ago, sadly. We ordered food to go from Sunset Cafe recently, and while we pretty much enjoyed everything, it wasn&#39;t the best. We had chicken stew, lamb stew, a couple of lentil dishes, shiro (made out of chickpeas), and a salad. I was really looking forward to the shiro, but theirs came out to be a little less flavorful than I would have liked. There&#39;s a pleasant sweetness to really good shiro that I enjoy, and this doesn&#39;t have that. Same for everything we had from here, actually. We were looking for a bit more spice in general. Injera was spot on, though, and we got tons and tons of it with the items we ordered. 

Service was friendly for the most part. Both the server and the cook were out in the dining area when we came in, and they both smiled to welcome us. We were offered the traditional popcorn and candy in the traditional wicker basket as we sat and waited for our food.

The place itself is humble and small -- nothing fancy, not a lot of tables and chairs. 

The restaurant has a tiny parking lot next to it. Other than that, it&#39;s all street parking on Rainier Avenue, but it shouldn&#39;t be that big of a challenge on a typical day."

Although the outside of the restaurant certainly doesn&#39;t elicit excitement, what matters is within. At Sunset Cafe, you&#39;ll find a delightful owner serving extremely good Ethiopian food at a bargain price. The quality is good, and the portions enormous. I ordered the vegetable-sampler, and ended up taking home more in leftovers than I was able to eat at the restaurant. Without exaggeration, I was given 2 - 3 meals worth of food. Given that it was all delicious, the $15 (including generous tip) that I paid made it a very good value. 

I&#39;m told that the restaurant does steady dinnertime business. I went for lunch on a weekday, though, and it was nearly empty. It was great - I enjoyed superb service and practically had the place to myself. Just be ware: it may look closed during lunchtime even though isn&#39;t. You&#39;re simply expected to enter though the attached Ethiopian grocery store.

Enjoy!"

I probably should take a star off for the slow service but the lady was all by herself. I think she did a great job considering. Price point is unbelievable.

However, the food is so good we couldn&#39;t stop eating it. I was blown away by the number of dishes that comes with the veggie combo.

It&#39;s not just a great meal, but an experience.  It&#39;s something you remember the first time, and every time, the kind of intimate transmission of delicious that the owner shares with you.  A destination, that is more than a the sum of its parts.  You can scour the land, and you will find a few excellent places around Seattle, and serve Ethiopian food; but this one stands out. 

My group of 6 finished volunteering nearby, and we came looking for good food.  What was delivered, was a testimony of good food.  Combos were the way to go, and before we knew it, and after some wonderful help from the owner; we had a plate of food, the size of a large pizza.  

Let&#39;s explain, the owner comes out, with dishes of food, and individually places them on a platter of injera (the soft bread layer). Many different lentils, meats, and African curries that left us wanting more.  Vegetarian options too, it was a march forward, systematically more delicious than the previous plate. It was a vast exploration of complex and delicious flavors. 

Get the Combo Plates, it&#39;s a good way to find a ways to try all the flavors from this culture. Highly Recommended.  It&#39;s not the most amazing décor, but who cares, when the food is delicious and priced wonderfully."

So, my boyfriend and I wanted to try this place out. (Just a bit of an insider scoop; I&#39;ve been to about 3 places for Ethiopian food in So. Cal and haven&#39;t found something as great as this place. So a bit of advice for those who want to try out Ethiopian food for their first time or want to try something different, this is the place to be.) If you truly want to believe in the theory of not truly judging a book by it&#39;s cover, this is the place to go. The location of this place is in a very ethnic part of town, the building is located in a random spot and you&#39;ll need to park your car on the street because the parking lot at the restaurant only covers 3 cars. This place is a Ma-and-Pa shop and a hole in the wall place... so expect to eat some GREAT food!  

Oh yeah, in Ethiopian culture they don&#39;t traditionally use utensils to eat with... you are going to use your hands to eat. The cleanness way to eat with your hands is use the spongy bread to pick up the wet/saucy foods.

Decor/Cleanliness
Ok... the building looks beat up from the outside, and when you walk into the restaurant, it  looks over used... so yes... the establishment has seen better days. Since we arrived during the evening... the place was dimly lit. Including the restaurant did looked clean. So... yes... you should feel comfortable eating there.   

Food
We ordered their BBQ wings as an appetizer and the Sunset combo. Honestly... I could have done without the BBQ wings because they weren&#39;t anything special but the Sunset combo, I totally recommend everyone to get that. The Sunset combo is basically a little bit of everything on a spongy bread thing; there were some vegetable sides, some meat sides and home made cheese. Ethiopian food is very interesting... so the food might not match up on what you think Ethiopian food is because some of the favors are very interesting to your palate. 

Service
Great service. The owner/waitress/cook will tell you about the food if you are unfamiliar to it. Including, she will tell you if you ordered too much food for your party or not. She will also prompt you on how to eat the food as well. So... we felt really taken cared of by her.    

Overall Experience
5 stars for Sunset Cafe! The food really did speak for itself and the service was great! I do recommend it to anyone who is adventurist, or anyone who enjoys eating at a hole in the wall place or anyone who wants to support a Ma-and-Pa establishment. I do recommend coming with friends or family!

Happy Eating Everybody!"

You will be pleasantly surprised by the sweet, herbal, saucy, sour, spicy, smooth, flavors of any combo, but there&#39;s so much more...

Ask for &#34;green chicken&#34; with some kind of wonderful pepper and herb flavoring?! Or, the &#34;phasolia&#34; with green beans and carrots. 

Sunny will take care that the kids get fed...
Her &#34;foul&#34; with french bread is, &#34;off the hook!&#34;  as my 10 year old said.   My three year old daughter also loves the &#34;fresh farmers cheese&#34;.   Fried chicken is perfect for the picky eaters, but of course, takes time.

Since everything is fresh and hot, it can take a little while for the food to come out, especially when theres a packed dining room, but I don&#39;t mind waiting for amazing food. Great food is made with love and I feel the love baby!"

That extra touch is very nice.

My friend was visiting from Korea and he really liked it.  The Sunset Combo is a great place to start and to be honest it was enough for three of us.  Usually two of us get it and we have a lot left over.  With three it was perfect.  The young lady taking our order  kept insisting it was&#39;t enough food but we know how much we can eat.  

I have had some of the appetizers here as well and most were pretty good. The Sunset burrito which is with injera and beef or veggies.  The thing is if you get a combo platter it is very similar, so try and get a different appetizer.  The burritos were so big we could barely eat our food when it came!  

The Tibbs are all good.  We have had the lamb, beef and they are nice and spicy with jalapeños. The chicken Tibbs None of them were dry and the balance of spices were great.  The Doro Tibbs is chicken and it was very tasty as well. The Que Wott lamb stew was very flavorful.

The only downsides were that I had the tea it was disappointed because it was flavored water with a teabag.  Also, there were communication issues with the young woman taking our order both times we were here."

The sunset and veggie combos are amazing in both quality and quantity; the injera was the best that I&#39;ve had yet. The owners are very friendly and happily showed my parents how to eat the dishes.

Note of caution: The portions here are huge - the three of us ordered two dishes and had more than enough for a feast!"

This one is the best.  The setting is a bit old but clean and tactfully decorated.  The menu is complete and prices are very reasonable.  The service is fashionably slow but with a beautiful smile.  Slow sometimes is due to the fact that the owner is the cook and waitress.  So visit this place if you are in the mood for the best Ethiopian food in the greater USA area

The combo was enormous - it came with several delicious types of lamb, beef and chicken dishes for the ridiculously low $13. Even splitting it we didn&#39;t come close to finishing the one dish. The owner/cook was lovely and we loved the spiced tea. It was surprisingly quiet when we went around 6pm on a Tues but I can imagine it must get backed up."

I&#39;ve probably been here ten times in the last year. The housemade injera is solid, the right amount of tang and a good consistency. There is a great variety of dishes in the combo meals and Sunny keeps it interesting by rotating what she makes and trying out new dishes on the regular. It&#39;s a great value too, great portion size for sharing with friends and cheaper than the other Ethiopian joints in the area. 

The owner Sunny is welcoming, personable, and considerate. When one of my friends came in with a cold she made him tea and served him on his own injera as to not spread germs! 

Sure, the place isn&#39;t fancy and the service can be a little slow, but it&#39;s a small family run business and I&#39;ve never considered the wait to be too long. Make sure to ask for your bill when you&#39;re ready, otherwise they&#39;ll let you relax and keep nibbling as long as you want."

Service:
Was great. We got the feel of the mom and pops restaurant. The owners were both very nice and sweet!

Food:
We ordered what was recommended and got the Sunset Combo. All the meats were really good! Our favorite was the lamb curry. The Ethiopian beers were good! We tried both the light and dark.
BUT - The Ethiopian bread is sour. If you like sourdough then you will probably like it. We arent fans and it felt like it threw the whole the whole meal off.

We also ordered the &#34;hot wings&#34; for the appetizer. Be warned. DONT order it. Im guessing they dont get many orders of this. Because it literally tasted like the frozen &#34;buffalo wings&#34; and just microwaved."

You head a goodly ways down Rainier before you get here, and from outside, it&#39;s a very humble spot. Bars on the windows, building looks kinda rickety. But there&#39;s parking on the street, and this seems to be a bit of an Ethiopian culinary junction, with a coffee place and another casual restaurant all in the same block. 

Up a cement stair or two, over the homey welcome mats, and you&#39;re in. About 10 tables, a very small bar in the back, and some faded and cracked bathrooms to your right. They&#39;re playing Ethiopian Mtv, or something, on the TV and the hi-fi. It&#39;s a bit repetitive but very, very cheering to be sure. There&#39;s a small staff, and a steady stream of diners and to-go orders. To-go orders? Man, I wish I had this in my neighborhood. I would never stop eating it. 

The menu is brief, with the usual assortment of slow-roasted lamb, chicken, beef, and vegetable delights, plus a couple combo plates, The prices were so good that we hinted at ordering more than a combo, and the waitress just wouldn&#39;t let us--&#34;no, no, too much food for two people.&#34; Thank you for that honesty. You were definitely right. 

We did add some split peas to the meat combo, but they switched out the lentils for them, so it was kind of a regular-sized meat combo. That still was enough to leave us overly full for 12 hours. And soooo good. They bring out the big tin hubcap-sized platter lined with injera, and the owner follows behind with a tray, ready to explain her dishes. She carefully scoops each dish onto the injera, naming and explaining as she goes, so you really get a feel for each dish. Her accent lilts merrily as she speaks, and you just want to listen to her talk (about anything) the whole time you eat. 

Everything is seasoned to an exceptional depth with complexity you just don&#39;t find in most other cuisines. They give you a little basket with injera for scooping, each piece rolled like parchment. We went through about three of those, and paid for it the rest of the night with bloated bellies (please, please, use the smallest pieces you can, for the sake of your own comfort). Everything here was fantastically delicious, and we would have lingered much longer if we hadn&#39;t had to hurry to a show that evening. 

They brought mugs of tea near the end of the meal (well, we ordered them--don&#39;t go in expecting them), seasoned with cinnamon before the tea bags even hit the hot water. The teas are just bagged Stash blends, but the cinnamon water livens them up considerably. The owner asked us if we had been in before, and when we said we had not, she chuckled warmly and pointed out she had been open for three years--&#34;so, why not before now?&#34; Thankfully, we won&#39;t have to explain ourselves again in answer to that question. But if you haven&#39;t been in yet, you will. So prepare your answer, and go explain yourself to Sunny. She will make you very happy you did."

I visit Seattle every couple months and always stop by to enjoy Sunny&#39;s food and to see her beautiful smile. The food is great, but it&#39;s also the warmth Sunny brings when you meet her. Some things to note when visiting:

This is not a rush in / rush out restaurant. Sunny makes each order on the spot so it takes a little time. Expect to be there no less than 1.5 hours. Just relax!

Yes, the area looks a little sketchy. It&#39;s just a less developed area of Seattle, that&#39;s all. If you&#39;re expecting a Ballard downtown then you&#39;re in the wrong area. If you want great food and to meet Sunny, then come in!

Also, if you&#39;re a vegetarian like me then there are plenty of options.

Many times Sunny whips up something new (not on the menu) based on seasonal ingredients and it is always a nice surprise, and delicious!"

Wow. Just wow. Found this place on Yelp (of course!) and decided to give it a go to get out of my usual dining area. Took my friend, who was a little worried about the area, but was willing to give it a go for good Ethiopian.

We were blown away! What they lack in humble interior, they make up for with warm, inviting customer service and amazing food. We split the Sunset Combination (various meats and vegetables served atop injera). This was MORE than enough for two people; we had leftovers to take home. Presentation was fabulous - the owner came out and described what each and every dish was (beef, lamb, chicken, collared greens, homemade cheese, etc.) and gave us an additional basket of rolled up injera. When we asked for additional injera to take home, they didn&#39;t charge us. 

The prices are very economical for what you get. Plus, the patrons seem to be regulars, and they made the atmosphere very lively. 

I think that if you&#39;re new to Ethiopian, it&#39;s essential to try a place that is good and has a good reputation. My first (and subsequent) experiences (back in Little Ethiopia in Los Angeles) left me feeling very nauseous (the quality of the food wasn&#39;t the best), so I didn&#39;t eat it again for a very long time. But, I&#39;m so glad I gave it another go. If you&#39;re okay with spices (not necessarily hot - just flavor), you will love this fare."

Let me tell you, from baseball to food, I love a good underdog. Located outside of downtown, I think, if you weren&#39;t looking for good &amp; legit Ethiopian food, you wouldn&#39;t venture into these corners of the neighborhood. 

Sunny is the do everything, do it all goddess. She cooks all the food herself and comes out to serve/explain it to you. She even had a full conversation with us and brought out more of our favorite sides! It&#39;s quite hard to come across a business/owner with so much genuine love and heart like this these days!

We ordered the ATKILT ALICHA and the SUNSET COMBO. The Injera was nice and fluffy without being overly sour. A lot of cabbage and other veggies of all sorts were incorporated into the sunset combo....so don&#39;t be afraid that it&#39;ll all just be meat because it&#39;s not! We were afraid so hence, the ATKILT ALICHA dish was ordered (it&#39;s always good to eat more veggies anyway!). My favorites were the beef &amp; gomen (collared greens) and the taliwat. The lamb and beef were so juicy and so full of flavor. Sunny didn&#39;t make the gomen sour or with a funky flavor/aftertaste like other places I&#39;ve been to... You could tell a lot of Ethiopian love was put into every single dish. The traditional doro wat was surprisingly very tender and cooked perfectly (a lot of places tend to overcook this part!....even the popular Ensarro in Oakland, CA). 

I have to say, coming from the Bay Area, lots of delicious Ethiopian restaurants coexist on one side of the bay and boy of boy, Sunset Cafe would truly be one of the top contenders if it was in California! Support Sunny you guys! Parking is free and plentiful on the streets! (I don&#39;t understand the tax on parking or the 2 hour parking limits everywhere in Seattle!). Sunny is a sweetheart. Her food is super affordable and legit! Noms!"

Large portions of food at very reasonable prices. My friend and I shared the veggie combo which had 6-7 different dishes and came with endless refills of injera (the bread). The lentil dishes were my favourite - all of them had different but equally delectable gravies! The combo proved to be too much for the 2 of us and we ended up with generous leftovers. We also had the Sambusa which is similar to an Indian samosa but with a mixed veggie filling instead of just potatoes - yummy!
Its a pretty small place but very charming. The waitress was super nice and the chef (or owner) came out to talk to us and explain a bit about the foods - very thoughtful. Don&#39;t let the somewhat dingy exterior deter you, this is a great place to dine at!"

There were 3 lamb stews, a chicken stew, another chicken &amp; greens dish, some lamb tripe (I think), and even some kitfo, which I enjoyed more than I thought I would. She was also kind enough to swap out the lentils that usually come with the Sunset Combo and added collard greens instead.

Right off the bat, you are greeted by an extremely friendly lady who&#39;s the chef/owner who&#39;s as integral a part of the experience here as the food.

My wife and I requested the veggie combo. Since I also love meat, she brought me a hearty portion of lamb tibs on the side and only charged me $1 extra which was amazing.
Every single vegetable in the combo was absolutely perfect. Extremely flavorful, distinct and probably the best you can find in Seattle. The owner brings it all out in small bowls and serves it tableside on the injera explaining what each dish is. There&#39;s also a basket of injeras on the side which they very generously offer to refill if at all you manage to finish those.
The portions are massive and 1 combo can easily feed 3 people with huge appetites and probably still have some to take home.

Overall, Sunset Cafe has outstanding food, extremely friendly service that leave you feeling warm and at home, incredible affordable prices and is definitely well worth the drive. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m going to keep going back here every time I crave Ethiopian food.

Sunset Cafe is definitely the best Ethiopian restaurant I&#39;ve tried in Seattle so far.  It&#39;s a great choice for those that love Ethiopian food or want to try it out for the first time.

The parking is not exactly ideal (since it&#39;s on a busy street) and the restaurant is a little hard to find, but it&#39;s truly worth the effort.

Located on Rainier Ave, Sunset Cafe looks like a small, unassuming, somewhat sketchy looking hole in the wall from the outside. However, the interior was homey and charming. 

*********
CUSTOMER SERVICE
The service was very good, and I think that&#39;s what makes Sunset Cafe stand out.  I&#39;ve been here twice before and the cook/owner (Sunny) remembered me pretty immediately on my 2nd visit.

Sunny was very sweet, and I could tell she took deep pride in her food.  She was genuinely concerned on whether we were enjoying ourselves.

For my first visit, the waitress (the owner&#39;s daughter) was extremely helpful.  It was a little busy, so we had to ask for water 1-2 times when our cups were empty, but that was really a small thing.

*********
THE FOOD
During my 1st visit, we ordered the Sunset and Veggie combo.  It easily fed the 6 people in our group. The costs was inexpensive at around $13/combo.  They also allowed us to substitute one of the meats with some lamb tips for a couple of extra dollars.  

Unfortunately, they ran out of Sambusa on the menu (Next time!)

The injera was fresh, which made me realized I had gone too long without eating the sour, tangy, spongy bread.

Instead of just putting a tray of food on the table, Sunny took the time to explain each component of the dish before placing it individually on our injera plate.

The food was very flavorful with the right amount of spices.  There&#39;s also something fun about eating with your hands, and I can&#39;t wait to come back again with friends."

sunset-cafe-seattle,Corinne M.,7IQb5JiQQ6acxf0qoBkFOA,"Pearl City, HI",1,1,1,42,2,Fcb3KYNwx5uFUKD-aqx6mg,5.0,2015-11-03,"We had a 5 1/2 hour layover at SeaTac on our way back home to Honolulu Int&#39;l, and decided to take advantage of the several hours by leaving the airport.  We attempted to navigate the light rail, but did so not very successfully, though that was mostly because we had no idea where we were going and were just winging it; after about ten minutes at a random station and much Googling, we found Sunset Cafe and decided to call an Uber to take us there.

My group was a little sketched out upon first arriving.  Take this with a grain of salt - but I&#39;ve been blessed enough in my life to frequent nicer, more upscale neighborhoods the majority of my life, and this part of Seattle seemed a little shady at first.  I&#39;m very glad that we gave it a chance, though - we all ultimately decided that this little joint had good reviews, and some of the best food are little hole in the wall establishments, so we decided to just go for it.

Upon entering, the restaurant was dimly lit and pretty empty, only two other people in the entire place.  There were some incenses burning on the ground and a green-lit bar at the back, but we didn&#39;t see anyone at first, no hostess or anything.  We kind of stood around awkwardly at first, then a lady came out from the back and told us to sit anywhere.  We did, all exchanging unsure glances, not sure of what we had just gotten ourselves into.  She returned with a tray of four glasses, a pitcher of water, and menus.  None of us knew what any of the stuff on the menu was, but there was enough of a description on each one to make a decision on what to get.

My husband and his friend each ordered the Sunset Combo, while another friend went with #37 Doro Wot.  I chose #39, Que Wott.  My husband also started with Hambusha w/ Tea as an appetizer.  I couldn&#39;t tell you if it was slow service or not; we weren&#39;t in a rush, but it did seem to be a one woman show in there, as the nice lady taking our orders was also assisting the other table and going back to do all of the cooking.  The Hambusha was an interesting bread, and the tea was delicious, but super spicy, like black pepper.  We had never had a tea like that before.  It was weird, but delicious.

When the food came out, my husband and his friend realized they probably could have split the Sunset Combo as it is HUGE.  Come to think of it, I probably could have split my plate with someone.  The food portions are large, served on a bed of this light, airy, spongey bread that I came to find was called Injera bread.  The lady, who I presume from other reviews is Sunny, the owner/waitress/cook (I told you, it&#39;s a one woman show!), explained what she was pouring onto our Injera bread as she did so, and then what each thing on the Sunset Combo was to my husband and his friend.  Always eager to experience new cultures, I found online that scooping the meat with the Injera bread in your right hand is the &#34;right&#34; way to do it.  I hope the internet was right, lol.  Anyways, that&#39;s what we did, and it was delicious.  Sunny brought us extra Injera bread for our plates, so you could scoop with that but still also have some delicious saucy bread leftover once the meat was eaten.

I regret to say that I could not finish my entire plate.  It was fantastic.  A little spicy, but not overly so, even with chapped lips and a sore throat from our adventures on the east coast in the cold weather.  The lamb was so tender and flavorful, the bread was a slightly weird consistency and a little tangy but it just all complimented so well.  We were overly impressed with the food, loved the aura of the joint, and Sunny was absolutely amazing in tending to our needs but cooking and presenting the food as well.  She offered to box up our food for us to take, but we sadly decided against it due to having to head back to the airport for another 6 hour flight.  She told us to come back and visit, and I told her that if we were ever in Seattle again, that we definitely would.  I absolutely hope to keep good on my word and look forward to returning here if I am ever back in Seattle.  We caught an Uber back to the airport and made our flight with plenty of time; all in all it turned out perfectly and this was definitely an experience worth having!"

Before I even entered, the restaurant looked sketchy. It&#39;s located on a ghetto like street. When I entered the restaurant, it was very hot. They had two useless fans blowing away. However, the waitress was very helpful and friendly. She let us choose a table and explained the menu.

Because of the recommendations, we ordered 2 veggie combos, beef tibbs, and hot wings. The waitress taught us how to eat, which was good. The beef tibbs were also good. 

The hot wings were mediocre. It was also labeled as an appetizer, despite coming after the main entrée. 

They have good service, but the food and location is not good."

I ordered 2 vege and 2 meat combo platter for a family dinner for 7 people, and there was an incredible amount of food.  everything was flavorful, different, and we couldn&#39;t get enough of it. 

The nice, sweet older lady who must be the cook came out with the tray of food and described every single item. We instantly got excited to eat upon seeing, smelling, and hearing about the food, but you might get impatient having to wait to hear her explain everything if you&#39;re starved. 

This place isn&#39;t &#34;nice&#34; so don&#39;t expect anything fancy. But the food is superb and the service is great."

Consistency however is an issue, and the quality very much depends on when you get there, who is cooking and what they have available or left, i.e luck.  Especially like the veggie combo, more than the meat.  The biggest draw here is the variety, on its best days you get a dozen or more different samples, some of which you might have never come across before."

The lady of the kitchen, if memory serves me named Sunny, is always very mom-like, the portions yuuuuuuge, the food delicious!!!!

For one I&#39;m not a lamb person (certain places make them very gamey) but at sunset cafe it was amazing! 

The sunset combo is a must, or veggie combo for the vegetarians! Talk about more bang for your buck! And Sunny&#39;s presentation of each course is very helpful too, especially with such a big combo!

We would like to go again, but have been hesitant to drive that far, as during another attempt to try it out for lunch on one of the weekends (it was supposed to open at noon), we waited until 1 PM, and had to leave as it did not open.

We got the Sunset Combo. It had:
- Doro Wot
- Lamb with Doro Wot sauce
- Chicken with greens
- Chicken Tibs
- Beef tibs
- One dish of lentils
- Collared greens

The sauce/gravy of the Doro Wot is amazing. It is the best I have had. It is spicy and flavourful. The meat dishes were a little overdone but mostly nice. The lentils were good but it wasn&#39;t either Shiro Wot or Misir Wot.

The service was good and the chef/owner (I think) came out to meet us and explain to us all the dishes. 

It did take a long time to get our food - almost forty five minutes and it seemed that everything in the kitchen is serialized.

Overall, this place is great. It is slow though."

It did not disappoint!  Seriously, if you have never tried Ethiopian food (or have for that matter), TRY IT!  We shared the burrito (which sounds weird from an Ethiopian place), but was excellent, and the vegetarian combo, which was one of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire life.  The burrito was made in the Ethiopian bread they use and was phenomenal, slightly spicy, great flavor, and an all around great appetizer (or main entree for that matter).  The veggie combo was an INSANE amount of food.  She came out with the combo and I actually laughed because the food kept coming and coming.  You could easily share this amongst two people, if you only got the combo (that was our mistake, since we got the combo and the burrito).  Everything within the veggie combo was delicious and even the next day after reheating was incredible.  I&#39;m sad I live so far away, so I won&#39;t be able to return for quite a while.  IF you have any desire to try Ethiopian food, or if you have and want a new place PLEASE give this place a try.  I promise you will love it."

Three of us split an order of chicken wings, the vegetarian combo, and the meat combo and it was way too much food. The waitress had luckily discouraged us from ordering more food! Feeling like I&#39;ve tried a good portion of the menu, I think I have a good understanding of what Sunset Cafe offers. There were many things that were just OK. Some of the highlights included the garbanzo bean puree, the beets (spicy!) and meat curries. Otherwise, a lot of the vegetarian dishes were pretty bland and several of the meat dishes were quite dry. The chicken wings had a good flavor but were pretty soggy.

The meal the 6 of us shared (one veggie combo, one meat combo, and kitfo) was delicious and extremely well-priced. I felt like I was getting a steal, in fact! Two of our diners were kids, one a teenager who had tried Ethiopian food before and didn&#39;t like it. She *loved* the different dishes, especially the lamb and the green beans. In fact, there were no dishes that we didn&#39;t *all* try &amp; enjoy. Though of course, some were better than others - the okra was one of my favorites, along with one of the chicken dishes and the yellow lentils. My husband, who is a kitfo fanatic, was very pleased with Sunny&#39;s rendition. 

We stayed for several hours eating the beautifully prepared food and chatting with one another and Sunny. I will definitely be back, and soon. Yum!"

It was our first time trying Ethiopian food so had no idea what it would taste like. The service at this restaurant is super friendly and welcoming. Definitely good quantity of food when ordering the combo. I love the fact that the lady introduced all the food items when she took it out for us - definitely add a special touch to the whole experience. 

However, the food was either too spicy and too sour for my liking to be honest (veggie and sunset combo). I am sure it was good food, but my taste buds and I didn&#39;t enjoy the flavour too much. So based on Yelp rating system, I could only give in an a-ok (3 stars) and not I&#39;m a fan (4 stars)."

After a 5 hour swim meet at Rainier Beach Pool, I decided this was a good time to introduce my kids (&amp; their much earned hunger) to Ethiopian Food.  Couldn&#39;t have picked a better place.  Me the vegetarian, them, carnivores in the true definition of the word. 

Everyone is friendly and everyone really truly cares about their restaurant.  From the guy out front sweeping up the leaves to the owner who really does come out, sit at your table, greet your family, and make you coffee. (It&#39;s not just turning on a machine... it&#39;s truly a ceremony). 

After my 12 year old swimmer ordered the Sunset Combo (for himself), Sunny came out to make sure we knew it was ALOT of food.  After the food came out she checked in again.  Sat with us and talked about her kids, their swimming days etc. 


In the end, we stayed for a couple of hours enjoying the company, feeling welcome and most importantly the amazing food.  While a bit too spicy for the smallest (who had many other non-spicy but equally flavorful options), those that really appreciate a good blend of spice that doesn&#39;t kill the flavor we truly found a place that strikes a perfect balance.  

Sometimes, atmosphere can make the food taste better than it might otherwise.  But it&#39;s a rare time when you have both incredible food and a very inviting atmosphere.  

And yes, the food might take some time to come out, but there is a reason for that."

We were greeted immediately and the gentleman was very nice. I have to say, its been a while but the menu prices were cheap, not reasonable but cheap! 
We decided to get the Sunset combo $12.99 and the veggie combo $11.99. Each combo feeds 2-3 people. What a deal.
Not sure what Ethiopian food is supposed to taste like but it was all great. The platter was beautifully arranged as our server explained what each dish was. I highly suggest getting a combo because you can taste a variety of dishes from collard greens to lentils, string beans. It was all great, hats off to the chef.

My wife went, spoke well of it, and brought home leftovers.

I wish I lived in Seattle so I could go here all the time. The food was absolutely delicious - rich but not too oily, the meat was tender, and the injera was perfect -- light and not too sour. 

The combo offerings have the widest variety of dishes I have seen for unbelievably low prices. The Sunset Combo, which included a variety of lamb, beef, chicken, and vegetable dishes, was just $12 -- I paid $35 for a comparably sized  but less diverse and less tasty at an Ethiopian place in Atlanta just a few weeks ago. The exterior of the restaurant is somewhat unassuming, but inside it is pleasant, with lots of natural light and tasteful decorations. The food presentation is also artful. The coffee ceremony was also the most authentic I&#39;ve seen in the U.S. -- i.e., the only one I&#39;ve seen that is exactly the same as what I saw when I was actually in Ethiopia, when you get to see the beans roasting and have the special garnish to stir/flavor the coffee. It was the best Ethiopian coffee I&#39;ve had.

Also, the lady that runs this restaurant is delightful. She is very friendly and warm, and took care to explain all of the dishes as she presented them at the table. When I asked to add shiro to my combo, she made some fresh right then, and it was perfect. Like everything else here, the tej (honey wine) here is by far the best-tasting that I&#39;ve had anywhere.

The owner completely understands they type of customer service/experience patrons like to have. We ordered the veggie combo and from the description expected the usual: yellow lentils, red lentils, cabbage, salad, collard greens. But what we got was way way more! We got at least 4 dishes that weren&#39;t listed on the menu that we&#39;ve never had at any other Ethiopian restaurant. It was a nice surprise to be given extra dishes for free. They are a great example of under promise (or perhaps normal promise) and over deliver!

In terms of quantity, it was so much food. Be sure to take your leftovers home! Oh and I saw some people come in to get take out so there is always that option as well.

We went during the day and the owner talked to us and asked us about how we liked our food as if it were a matter of pride. And if we didn&#39;t like it, she would make it right. I also saw her talk to all the customers in this same caring, non-rushed manner. It was so nice and not obtrusive at all because the woman is so charming. 

At the end of the meal, our bill came with a small bowl of hard candies. I love when restaurants offer this at the end of the meal! A small bowl so you can pick/choose or eat 5 candies if you want is so much lovelier than being given one each. It was also a good mix of what I think were ethiopian candies and the normal brach&#39;s.

In terms of parking, it is on street either in front of the businesses on Rainier ave or in the neighborhood. It wasn&#39;t that difficult but I remember thinking we&#39;d go this one time just to try it and not come back. But in hindsight, it wasn&#39;t that difficult to find parking (we were about 1 block away) and I&#39;d gladly take uber to eat here again!"

Sunset was our first pick since the reviews were great and it was literally...next door.

Don&#39;t let the outside fool you, this place is more than you could wish for. We were greeted by a nice lady who told us to pick any seat in the restaurant. We sat at a long table for six. The owner came by introduced herself and thanked us for coming in.

We wanted to order 10 things (semi true story) but Tsehay said we should order one item first and if we&#39;re still hungry she will make us the burrito we were eyeing. I appreciate such honesty. We decided to order #45 Sunset Combo: A combination of salad, lentils, and multiple special Ethiopian meat entrees  served on a platter with injera. Basically every top choice meat item on the menu was in this combo + some vegetarian options. 

A little while later, she comes out and presents everything in 12 small bowls including a well dressed salad. It looked and smelled fabulous. After telling us what each item was, she turned the little bowl upside down onto the injera. Everything was presented so well! I loved it.

After taking a few food porn photos, we inhaled everything. While we were eating, she came back out periodically to check on us. Turns out she made a fresh batch of hot  injera in the back especially for us! It was just cooling off when she brought it out. Not wasting a second, we split it and finished up the rest of the dish. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever finished my plate at an Ethiopian restaurant. SO full but SO good. The injera was perfect texture, thickness, and tartness. Some of the best I&#39;ve had. Seriously!  I bet this is what food in Ethiopia would taste like. Authentic, fresh, and delicious.

When we were both finished, she could tell how much we enjoyed our meal and how full we were. She made a joke and asked us if we&#39;d like her to start making the sunset burrito. &#34;You have room for more, right?&#34;

The owners made our meal unforgettable and for this, I will be back!"

We originally looked to go to Altaye, but apparently they decided to close earlier than their advertised time of 9 pm (we showed up around 8:15 or so).  In a scramble to find a replacement place to eat, Sunset presented itself, albeit very discreetly.

The outside of the restaurant is unassuming, as it appears like a convenience store.  Walking inside, you experience a very humble setting, since lavish decorations are replaced with just a series of tables and some decorations indicative of East Africa.  At the front is a simple bar that serves up some of the staple liquors like gin and vodka.

The complexity sets in with the food.  Should you have any doubts, just look at my photos attached to this review.  We originally opted to each order a dish, but we were cautioned by the chef that this would be too much.  A completely appreciated and honest assessment, since their portions turn out to be enough to share between two (I felt bad because the restaurant wasn&#39;t earning much profit as the meal was only $13).  Here is a list of the foods included atop our injera bread:

-  Beef tibs
-  Lamb tibs
-  Collard greens
-  Chicken with greens
-  Lamb with greens
-  Beef with spicy sauce and egg

As my review says, the food was nothing short of a 5 star, when taking into account freshness, taste, and texture.  It was immediately apparent that the food was cooked with plenty of TLC, and the chef was even kind enough to bring the food out in individual bowls, then portion each dish out on top of our injera bread.

An appropriate closing note would be to comment on this staple they call injera.  Probably the best I&#39;ve had - the injera was perfectly tart, and not too thick at all.  Not only do they give you a generous starting portion of injera, but they refill you as needed.  Perfect to wrap your food with, or to sop up the great sauce they use for the food.

Enjoy, peeps."

I went with two friends who were new to this type of food, so I was nervous about how they would like it. The location was already off-putting for them, and the fact that there was only one table occupied as we walked in made me even more doubtful about the great reviews I&#39;ve seen about this place. 

A man got up from the bar to seat us and hand us our menus, but did not take our orders when we were ready; turns out, there is only one person doing the waiting and cooking that night ( or every night? Not too sure). As soon as the waitress was done helping the other table, she approached us with the brightest smile. We initially wanted to just order the sunset combo to share amongst the 3 of us, but the waitress told us it contains only meat and that we should order veggies as well. So we let her decide on the veggies. She brought us back a HUGE tray filled with at least 7-8 different meat dishes, and 4 veggie servings. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. She carefully placed each dish onto the injera while explaining what it was. Everything was delicious, but my favorite was the lamb - and I&#39;m usually not a lamb person. The sweet tones added into that dish either took away or covered up the gamey taste, which worked really well in my opinion. 

I plan on coming back to explore new entrees, but if you are new to Ethiopian cuisine, the sunset combo is the way to go. You get to sample all of the different flavors of this cuisine and all for an unbelievable value of about $13 FOR 3 PEOPLE ( $17 in our case, for the additional veggies). 

--One more thing: if decor or ambience is of any importance to you, forget about it. Fluorescent lighting and rectangular dining room tables with white table cloths..bare is an understatement.  But hey, if the food is good, I&#39;m not complaining."
sunset-cafe-seattle,Madison G.,7KilAevHZjdxgVQI4640Xg,"Seattle, WA",0,1,1,32,4,7SSzjmeoFeo8A9V-pBwuXQ,4.0,2014-12-14,"Overall, I am rating this place a 4.5. I am a fan, but it is not quite &#34;as good as it gets&#34; as the 5 star would suggest. However, this place was still good and some where I would recommend.

The customer service is definitely worth 5 stars. Both the waitress and the owner were very pleasant and friendly. The owner came out shortly after the waitress took our order and introduced herself and then explained a little more in detail about what we just ordered, despite us not asking for any additional information about it. I thought that was pretty cool &#39;cause when I first started eating out at Ethiopian restaurants, I remember sitting there thinking, &#34;Tibs... Tibs... Is that what she had at her family party? Wait... Which one is the saucy one?&#34; So, it&#39;s always nice when someone is willing to explain more than just what the menu says.

The food comes out differently than any other Habesha restaurant I&#39;ve ate it. She brought out the injera with nothing on it and then small bowls of the meats we ordered. As she put the meat onto the injera, she then again explained what everything was. The portions were a bit smaller than what I am used to, which is part of my reasoning for 4 stars instead of 5. I felt there was much more sauce than there was meat and the platter which the injera came on was quite smaller than other places and I&#39;m pretty sure I could&#39;ve finished it myself. So, for this price, it isn&#39;t exactly 2-3 people friendly, like I&#39;m used to.

The parking is a bit sketchy on this block and I was worried about my car the whole time since it was about 8:45 pm when we came to eat here. Dark, no lights, and right on the street. If you&#39;re easily freaked out and will worry about your car being damaged, I suggest taking the bus and going during the day. :) lol.

**EDIT / UPDATE** I left out that they ran out of anything having vegetables in it, so we didn&#39;t get the combo we wanted due to that. Because of that, I now realize why the portions seemed smaller. I still feel like there was very little meat though."

A great introduction! The waitress was very helpful in helping me make a selection (mild beef stew). Ethiopian food is on the spicier side, but they will help you find something mild if you prefer that. As others shared, the chef brings out the food personally! She pours the items individually on a large crepe-like bread. The stew was very delicious!

4 stars instead of 5 because I had a hard time (headache) with some of the incense."

It may also be among the very best bang for your bucks in the city as well.  My wife and I went there for dinner after reading the great yelp reviews.  The owner/manager/chef was indeed very gracious, welcoming and attentive.  My wife and I were quite hungry, so was shared the Sunset combo (meat dishes) and she offered to supplement it was 3 (which ended up being 4) veggie dishes as well.  While no Ethiopian food expert, I have dined in the Adams Morgan district in DC (maybe the best Ethiopian in the country) and have been to 5-7 around here.  Most of my experiences in Seattle have been lack-luster at best, or awful at worst.  

The food was all very fresh, well-seasoned and delicious.  She added literally home-made Ethiopian-style cheese to our meal, and it was fantastic.  While they do have a bar, I think it is fair to say that one would not go out the way to have a drink here.  What you really want, and what speaks for itself, is the great food.

Highly recommended, and if a fraction of the city knew about this place, I think it would be tough to get into.  As it stands now, the place warrants your patronage, as on a rainy night, we were the only diners for dinner."

The food is delicious, hot, fresh and clearly full of love. The cook herself came out and explained everything - including what was in what, and what she personally crafted from hand (she makes the cheese herself), which was very appreciated for first timers like me. 
My guest and I shared a veggie combo (about $13) and a side of lamb tibbs ($12) and could barely finish half of it. We almost order two combo plates and were politely turned away from ordering too much food. 

I researched a long time for the best place to try Ethiopian food here in Seattle...and I came here for the food admittedly, but I would return a thousand times over for the service. 
Our waitress and the cook were adorable and beyond polite, even though we came in less than an hour before closing. They never made us feel like we were an inconvenience and even asked us how everything was at the end of our meal with genuine interest.

They have several different burgers to choose from, or you can make your own. Plenty of options for both vegetarians and omnivores. I find the burgers to be just above average, really nothing to write home about, but they are pretty good. The IPA fries were delightful.

The last time I went in I noticed they had &#34;spicy veggie poutine.&#34; it&#39;s pretty far fetched from what poutine is supposed to be, but it was good and I&#39;d eat it again. Service is good and the mixed drinks are well crafted. Definitely worth checking out if you&#39;re in the area!"

This month, it was time to try BRGR Bar.

Type of cuisine: Burgers. Fancy schmancy ones, but burgers nonetheless.
 
Ambiance: A small entry leads into a rectangular, elongated space with a loft above. Booth seating on the left, intimate settings on the right, a small bar at the back. Dark. Even in full sun, daylight.
 
What I ordered: As we awaited the fifth in our party, we started with one Blackberry Lemonade ($4) and a Spring Soda ($4) with housemate cucumber, sage and lemon syrups with soda water. (Each included one free refill.) One order of Garlic Fries ($7) with olive oil, minced garlic, garlic sauce, parmesan and parsley, and one order of Bleu Cheese Fries ($7) with bleu crumbles, house bleu sauce, parsley.
 
Our burgers, the main show, (local house blend beef patties from Pasco, WA and organic brioche buns fresh from Grand Central Bakery): for me, the BMB ($10 burger only) with smoked bacon, sautéed mushroom, melted bleu crumble, house bleu cheese sauce. For my husband, the Bacon Brie ($10 burger only), a beef patty topped with center-cut bacon, melted brie, caramelized pear, arugula, and sweet date aioli. For one of our dining companions, the Oaxaca with a side Mix Salad ($11), a beef patty topped with pepper jack cheese, roasted poblano pepper, pico de gallo, avocado, pepper chili sauce, and our second dining companion chose the Build Your Own with 6oz beef ($6), Cheddar cheese ($1), Lettuce, Tomato ($0.25 each), ketchup and mustard, with a side of hand cut fries ($3). And one Root Beer Float ($5) for dessert!
 
What I loved: Number one: The Garlic Fries. Number Two: The Oaxaca Burger. Number Three: refreshing Spring Soda.
 
Why I loved it: Not at all crowded on this Wednesday evening at 6:30 for an early-ish dinner.  While small and unaccompanied, a great burger!
 
Cost: Average to high for a well-crafted and constructed burger ($9-$12 each)"

I built my own burger and was blown away by the quality. The meat is top notch- you can taste that it&#39;s high quality meat. All the produce is fresh and the fries are great! I recommend the garlic fries and the IPA battered fries.

BRBG Bar is literally a tiny hole in the wall. The atmosphere is actually quite dark and dreary. I was also surprised to see only one other couple in there on a Friday night.

Since it was past 10pm a number of places in the area was either packed or didn&#39;t serve food anymore. Then we found this place, conveniently located near Trinity.

You go and and order your food and drinks (yes, there are alcoholic options) up front. Then you&#39;re handed a number and wait at your table. Your burger is made after you order it, so there is a bit of a wait, no biggie.

I ordered the Caprese with IPA battered fries. The fries are pretty good and has good girth. The burger was delish. It&#39;s pretty messy with the sauces but it makes it all taste so good. The burger itself is pretty thick and you don&#39;t have to worry about it being dry. Tastes fresh for sure. 

Service was great. The only downside is that both my friend and I wanted pink in our burgers. Neither of us got pink. Shouldn&#39;t have gave us option. I don&#39;t come to Seattle often, but I would definitely recommend this place if you&#39;re in the area."

It was juicy and paired well with the aioli and I&#39;m wondering if I could work out coming here for dinner tonight as I type...

My boyfriend and I ordered a chicken burger and a classic burger and split each to share. I just wanted to inhale both. He&#39;s a fast eater and I&#39;m typically slower. For once in our relationship, we finished our food at the same time. Mostly because I didn&#39;t want to be left with nothing! I&#39;ve already waxed poetic about the chicken... the beef burger is also great. It was juicy and perfectly seasoned. Those qualities seem basic but many Seattle restaurants get them wrong. We also ordered the IPA-battered fries to share between the two of us. WHY HADN&#39;T I HAD BEER-BATTERED FRIES BEFORE? Look, fries are already unhealthy. If I&#39;m going to eat deep-fried stuff, I might as well commit to the wreck. Might as well put my back into it. They were incredible.

They have good beers on tap, great cocktails and have I talked about the IPA-battered fries yet? Yeah? Just wanted to bring them up again."

The fries are simply amazing, but hot on their heels are the onion rings. Can&#39;t go wrong with either, and there&#39;s no shame in getting (a few) additional orders. 

Parking can be a bit tricky, but it is pretty close to a Link station, if that happens to work for you. 

Waitstaff keep things moving with drinks refilled quickly and plates taken away so tables don;t get too laden down with empties. 


Highly recommend."

The pros: the burger was great. We had a Bacon Brie and it was absolutely fantastic, as well as those sweet potato fries. And those IPA battered french fries are what all other fries in the world dream of becoming one day (basically, upgrade your fries, you won&#39;t regret it); the service was nice, there was a girl taking our order at the counter who was so incredibly friendly; and the ambiance was very rustic in a charming, very masculine way.

The cons: the burger of the month was not available on &#34;game days&#34; and nowhere in the restaurant nor on their website did it state that (that we could find) -- it was also the ONLY reason why we drove in to Pioneer Square and circled the blocks for 40 minutes. The Chicken sandwich that we settled for was exactly that - settled for. While juicy, the flavor was not anything to write home about. And the place was SO hot with absolutely no air conditioning, no fans, no air circulation that you broke out into a mild sweat just sitting there. It was also so hot in there that the ice in my glass completely melted from the time I walked from the counter to our table. The prices are also pretty high for what is essentially a fast casual restaurant that clearly does not want you to linger within.

But then again, we visited yesterday during what is hopefully the tail end of this unbearable heat wave.

And then there was the scenery. There were drug dealers and prostitutes outside of the restaurant when we were entering and leaving around 5PM on a Friday. They can&#39;t really do anything about it, and I don&#39;t blame them at all, but any future patrons should be forewarned. It just is what it is. 

The actual burger and both of the fries were unbelievable though, and we&#39;re absolutely planning on trying this place out again. So if you&#39;re craving a freaking good burger, done incredibly well, this is definitely the place for you."

I will say if the &#39;Cheesy Fiesta&#39; is available, be sure to order it. This was a &#39;BRGR of the Month&#39; but really should be a regular - it is a phenomenal burger with great tastes ranging from spicy to sweet. The burger is described as cheese stuffed red poblano pepper, cilantro, jalapeño house pepper chili, fig, and jam - damn..... that&#39;s my new jam. 

Surprisingly, the &#39;Oaxaca&#39; has thus far been the least impressive burger I&#39;ve tried - I&#39;m thinking this is due to having salsa on a burger. It didn&#39;t work out as well as other options. 

As a side order, the IPA-battered fries are borderline addictive. I&#39;d say they&#39;re probably crack-like (this, from someone who has never tried crack).

I will say I am disappointed the original &#39;Hot Mama&#39; is not longer on the regular menu nor are the curly fries. Both were my go to before the menu shakeup. Also, unless it&#39;s a (non-Mariners) home game day, the restaurant is closed on weekends, which sucks. However, I am impressed that BRGR Bar has been open to listening to their customers and (re)added some of their great burgers to the dinner menu after a bit of a hiatus.

food: pork belly burger. lacked flavor. if you didnt tell me there was pork belly, i wouldnt have known. not just due to taste, but they give you this small piece of pork belly. i thought people skimp on giving you bacon, but this burger had 2 or 3 bites at best. ***2/5

service: not full service. you order from the front counter and you get a number. i sat near the front door. it was a fairly hot day so i figured some fresh air from the outside was a smart choice. think again. if this was anywhere else, it wouldve been a fine choice. but this location is next to a bar and close to where the homeless hang around. so once in awhile you get a whiff of a particular smell that is not pleasant. ***2/5

value: not my first time paying for a $10+ burger, but at least i will go back to those places. i dont think i will come back a second time though. so expensive for lunch. burger and fries for nearly $20 bucks out the door and that doesnt even come with a drink. the burger was average at best. ***2/5"

I got the gangnam style burger and had zero regrets. It was the perfect amount of sweet with savory. It wasn&#39;t overly large or greasy either.

The burger wasn&#39;t horrible but it certainly doesn&#39;t merit a return trip.  A list of failures:
 - Burger was overcooked and dry, even though I requested &#34;medium&#34;.  There was no pink whatsoever.
 - Over 20 minutes to get my order during lunch before the server went to check on it
 - A sad, limp, soggy greasiness befell the fries.  Gross.
 - $20 (!!!) after tax and tip for a custom-built blue cheese burger w/ bacon and fries.  No drink, no frills.
 - Another 10 minutes to return my card after paying
 
On the bright side, I kind of liked the atmosphere.  It&#39;s a little dark, but it&#39;s a cool old wooden interior.  It also looks like they have a nice beer selection on tap; sadly I rarely partake at lunchtime lest I not return to work.

I came just before noon and we were able to order quickly.  It was the perfect timing because there was a line to the door by 12:15.  They have a menu on the wall plus hand menus.  You order at the bar and are given a number in which they will deliver your food to you.

For national cheeseburger day they had a $5 classic cheese burger special.  It was lunch and I have a small tummy, so I ordered just that.  You can get your burger cooked one of two ways, medium or well done.  I like really pink burgers (borderline still bleeding pink) so I was disappointed by my options but went with medium.  The burger was the perfect size, I don&#39;t think I could of eaten a side dish with it!  It&#39;s too bad they don&#39;t regularly sell burgers à la carte. 

What elevates BRGR Bar to 5 stars is that my burger had no pink in it  but it was the most delicious patty I have ever tasted!  To be able to make me like something I usually hate is huge!  But it wasn&#39;t just the patty, the burger as a whole was top notch!"

The burger patty itself is thick and juicy even when well cooked (I asked for medium but it was definitely not medium). The bun is great - soft and plush without falling apart. The fries are good.

Cons:
The meat was unevenly seasoned - mostly flavorless but with pockets of weird seasoning. Service is slow and apathetic - our comment that the burgers are often cold when we get them for takeaway to our office a block and a half away was met with a blank stare. Especially since they quote 15 minutes and then just leave the paper bag on the counter, even while two people behind the counter are helping one person place their order. Either say ten minutes, or find a way to keep it warm. 
 
We were in the joint for 10 minutes before we got to walk away with our food - 25 minutes after our order was called in - and a burger with fries was $17. Not worth it. I&#39;m full but not satisfied."

While not the best burger I&#39;ve had nor best burger in town, it&#39;s a solid option and priced really well. For $9 even I got the cornily-named (but maybe comical to some) Gangnam burger which comes with choice of fries or salad. I opted for the former which were quite good and seasoned with a mixture very similar to that used at Five Guys and RR, except they showed restraint and didn&#39;t overdo it.

Presentation was good, the sesame bun held up to the sauce/patty, and the portion was definitely adquate. Ordered the burger medium-well which was listed as &#34;no pink&#34; on the receipt. Next time I&#39;ll order it medium or whatever they would call it to have some pink, as it was a bit tougher than I&#39;d like, and did a disservice to the Painted Hills beef they proudly claim to use. 

My problem with the burger is the unfortunately titled and bland-tasting &#34;Oriental coleslaw. It shocked me that a Korean-owned restaurant would misstep and use that antiquated terminology. I&#39;m not actually offended as I&#39;m not really an advocate of being PC all the time, but it still surprised me to see it up on the chalkboard and seems like a step backward. The last time I heard that used was the Oriental chicken salad at Applebee&#39;s and rugs. Please don&#39;t follow in the footsteps of a mediocre chain restaurant or area rugs and change it to something else like Asian or Korean or something else!"

Actual review: My husband and I came in about 90 minutes before the Sounders game so the place was busy but not packed. He ordered a veggie burger (the Hot Mama) with a salad. He loved the burger (it had good heat and texture - which you don&#39;t always get with veggie burgers) but thought the salad vinaigrette was lacking and a little bland. 

I ordered the fish and chips. I appreciate the portions, however the batter on the fish was really greasy and didn&#39;t have that crisp texture that one would expect from a fried dish. Also, the batter was unseasoned. The french fries while very plentiful, were soggy and also under seasoned. I thought about sending my plate back but the service was already slow (it took them about 10 minutes to bring us a beer) and I didn&#39;t want to miss the pregame festivities.

Came in here today after seeing all the awesome reviews and thank GOD because we needed a decent burger joint around here!
BRGER Bar is hands down easily one of the tastiest burgers I&#39;ve had here in Seattle. 
Tucked away between other eateries you walk in and are instantly greeted by their awesome staff. They are super friendly and on point. You will likely never have to ask for anything because they certainly bring their customer service A-game!

Really cool place. Brick and wood interior. Simple. Clean. Nice small bar area where you also order your food. Upstairs area for additional seating and a few TVs for some sports viewing!

My order was the BMB - Bacon, Mushroom, Blue Cheese Sauce. The patty was cooked perfectly and juicy. Not a wimpy sized patty either! Bacon was crispy just the way I like it. Sauce was good and not overly powerful. Almost wish they added blue cheese crumbles to it for some extra umph!
You can certainly customize your burger though. Toppings listed on back of menu if you want to add any goodies or even build your own! You can also change out a burger patty for veggie, or chicken. Score. 
The meal itself comes with fries. I opted for the IPA beer battered fries for $2 extra. Little did I know these bad boys were actually dipped...AND battered....like imagine thick fish &amp; chip batter with a fry inside. Definitely wasn&#39;t expecting that. They were certainly decedent and my inner fat kid wanted to destroy into them all but knew that wouldn&#39;t be the greatest idea. They are more than happy to give you a to-go container and sauce to-go as well! 

All in all this place is legit. They know whats up and cater to the lunch crowd for sure. Just know that it will take a few for your burger to cook, but it&#39;s so worth it!

I ordered a burger. I was asked if I wanted the burger cooked medium or well done. I went with medium. I cut my burger in half and started eating. As I was bites I started to notice how pink the burger was. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m a huge fan of medium rare but this wasn&#39;t even close to medium rare. The fat didn&#39;t even melt yet, I had pieces of solid fat in the middle of my burger!! 

The waitress asked if I wanted a box, I said no thanks the burger is raw I don&#39;t want to take it home. She took my plate to the kitchen and I saw her talking with the bar tender and cook. She came back to tell me this is how they cook their medium rare. I mentioned to her that I came for lunch a few days ago and it wasn&#39;t nearly this bad. Then she continued to tell me that if I wanted it cooked more, I should&#39;ve asked for rare. (Yes, this is what she told me. I did a double take when she said that)

1. I wasn&#39;t offered medium rare, my options were medium or well done. 
2. If the waitress doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s rare or well done, I don&#39;t think she should be dealing with meat. 
3. 2 burgers, a side of cheese fries and onion ring was $35+tip."

I also love their secret burger sauce and that they use arugula instead of the traditional lettuce on their burgers.  I work in the area and will definitely keep going back for more.

It was a spontaneous choice for lunch despite being proximate to several Pioneer Square established favorites,and yes, the Aloha Burger ($7.50, Painted Hills beef patty with grilled pineapple, lettuce, tomato, house teriyaki glaze, house roasted garlic mayo on a Grand Central Bakery brioche bun) was worth the detour. I asked for medium well and it was perfectly juicy! I enjoyed the curly fries - crisp, not soggy or greasy. I had been craving a burger for awhile and definitely devoured it! 

Burgers comes with fries or salad or one can upgrade for curly fries or sweet potato fries for one buck more, two bucks for IPA battered onion rings. 

In contrast, the husband started with the Tomato Basil Soup ($3.50), then had the Pulled Pork ($7.50, five spiced pork shoulder, melted Swiss cheese, and house BBQ sauce plus house mayonnaise) and onion rings. His words - soup &#39;unremarkable&#39;, BBQ sauce &#39;too sweet which masked the flavor of the pork&#39; and the onion rings &#39;decent, but one had a tough outer onion layer which was difficult to chew&#39;. 

The menu pretty much has something for everyone - soups, salads, small starters, 11 types of burgers including beef, chicken, pork, veggie, and a BRGR of the month, rice bowls including one that sounds like a quasi loco moco, various beverages including sodas, shakes, beer and wine, and the menu lists one dessert. There&#39;s also Happy Hour food and beverage specials. 

Friendly, efficient staff where the tasty food comes out within a reasonable time. 
They are on par with places like 8 oz Burger Bar, Uneeda Burger, and L&#39;il Woody&#39;s. 
An excellent addition to the new and improved Pioneer Square renaissance! Great weekday lunch choice and I&#39;m sure poised to get slammed for Happy Hour and when the sports season ramps up."

There could have been a little more peanut butter, for my taste, but it was really delicious. Well cooked, and very very tasty.

The sweet potato fries were a nice amount for my belly, but I do sort of feel like the price was high for that amount.  (Same with beverages, now that you mention it, though I drink water pretty exclusively.)

More lovely seating upstairs- though not accessible if you can&#39;t get up a set of stairs.

The burgers are great but every time I pick up my order it&#39;s cold.  When they say it will take 15 minutes to make my order, and I&#39;m there 15 minutes later, I expect my food to be hot.  It NEVER is, like EVER.  Which means I have to nuke it for a min when I get back to my office, which means I have to dismantle my burger so I don&#39;t cook the lettuce.  

So today I inquired why my burger is waiting for me on the counter, next to the pre-filled ice waters, and not under a heat lamp?  No response, only a statement that the orders are kept on the counter while you arrive/check-out.  AND when check-out takes 5 minutes that&#39;s another 5 minutes my order continues to get cold...sitting next to the ice water...

In conclusion--great burgers, really, but there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll continue to go here if my food isn&#39;t hot.  Buy a heat lamp.  Or I&#39;ll buy one for you and you can comp me burgers.  Srsly.

&#34;Why don&#39;t you just eat in the restaurant?!&#34; you say?  No way never.  It&#39;s so dark and dreary in there that it&#39;s a cave."

If you gave me one of their burgers and I hadn&#39;t seen the inside, my first thought would be Dome Burger.

The restaurant has been remodeled to have a upscale western sports bar feel, like most of the other restaurants in Pioneer Square. The front staff have been completely replaced, the menu has been rewritten, and big TVs are everywhere.

I ordered a Bavarian Burger, with regular fries. They asked how I wanted it cooked, so I requested Medium (which is a difficult with hamburgers). Their menu is up on a chalk board, and they have little paper handouts. The same style that all the local &#34;artisan&#34; sandwich shops use. Very much the impression of a fancy restaurant with high quality food.

What I got was a well done hamburger, slopped in sauce. The signature Dome Burger style. Why even ask how the burger should be cooked if it&#39;s going to be disregarded? The fries were the typical cheap fries you get at every burger joint. Too thick to be crispy, too well done to be soggy.

The receipt was in both English and Korean, so I&#39;m going to guess the kitchen staff hasn&#39;t changed since Dome Burger days. The food wasn&#39;t terrible, I like a good sloppy hamburger. However it didn&#39;t fit in with the rest of the restaurant. This is very much Dome Burger, with a new look, higher prices, and the same food."

The sides are solid in their own right. My only reservation with any part of the restaurant is the fancier burgers are on average $11 to $13, which puts those ones in the expensive category among eateries in downtown Seattle.

Hence, the birth of BRGR Bar.

I came with friends.  When I walked in I couldn&#39;t define what was theme was.  A knock off of 8 oz Burger?  Brave Horse Tavern?  Local 360?  I don&#39;t understand why there was a cuts of meat chart on the wall since not all cuts were offered.  It makes sense to have one at Rain Shadow Meats Squared but not BRGR Bar.

One of my friends ordered the Hot Mama without tomatoes.  When she received her burger she found a slice of a tomato.  Not that she was allergic to tomatoes but if she was, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be furious.  She removed the slice with a displeased look on her face.

My other friend ordered the Gangnam.  She asked for it to be cooked to medium.  She got a raw piece of meat.  Pink to the edge.  She requested they cook up another one for her which they did.  

My other friend ordered the grilled chicken.  My friend said that it was dry.  

I ordered the BRGR Classic.  I substituted the fries for a salad.  The salad&#39;s default dressing was vinaigrette.  I wanted to have ranch instead, which was an extra cost of $.50.  What came to me was the salad mixed with vinaigrette with ranch on the side.  Why would I want to mix vinaigrette with ranch dressing?  It doesn&#39;t make sense.  It should have been either/or right?  When the server came to check on my order I asked her she could take it back.  I requested to have fries instead.  She came back with fries but they lacked seasoning.

This review is purely on the food. The service was fine and the space looks really good (although the front of house was in complete disarray, but I&#39;ll let that go since they are brand new). 

I first thought about building my own burger and was pretty alarmed at the idea of paying .25 cents EACH for lettuce and tomato. Seriously? I get paying extra ($1) for things like grilled onions or something but lettuce and tomato? The opening price of the burger is already 5-6 bucks. 

I decided to order the basic burger with sub cheddar for american. She asked me how I liked my burger and I asked for medium rare. Ordered fries to accompany my burger. 
Food came out fast, which was nice but the place also wasn&#39;t busy at all. 

Started with the fries and they were nothing special. Tasted like freezer fries, which I sometimes like but nothing to write home about. Then I had the burger. What a disappointment.  With a large sign displaying different cuts of meat, being handed a fully cooked (not medium rare) flat, previously frozen puck of hamburger meat was really offensive. I mean, why ask how I want something cooked? Why pretend that burgers are handmade when they are just frozen junk? The bun was good, as was the cheese and the arugula was a nice touch but if the meat is junk, why bother. 

I might check this place out for their happy hour specials, but not for lunch when there are so many other great places in Pioneer Square."

Numerous others had told us that it was well worth a try . . .and we were not disappointed.  The restaurant is located in a narrow, two-story space, a few blocks from the ferry terminal.

One member of my group ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich, while the others (myself included) opted for the Classic.  All of the cooked-to-order sandwiches were well-seasoned and the accompanying fries were hot and tasty.  BRGR also boasts an extensive beer menu, though I did not sample any of them.

BRGR was a nice find and one that I certainly will consider revisiting if I am ever looking for an affordable lunch option in Pioneer Square."

We were visiting Seattle and wanted to have burgers for dinner.  This place was close to our hotel.  It was around 8 pm, so we called to see if the kitchen was still open.  They were friendly on the phone and told us &#34;sure, no problem, come over.&#34;

We walked the few minutes to the restaurant.  It was getting dark.  There were good number of questionable people along the few blocks on Yesler Way.  But the corner of Yesler and Occidental was very scary.  There were a group of people standing around.  They were watching and slowly approaching.... Let&#39;s just say I was glad there were several of us in the group.  But I was still very concerned about our safety. 

When we walked into the restaurant (probably around 8:10 pm), all the chairs were on the tables.  It didn&#39;t look open.  We were told that the seats upstairs were still open.  We thanked the guy and left the restaurant.  We didn&#39;t want to eat there when they were clearly ready to close down.  And honestly, I was sure we were going to get mugged if we were to leave when it was completely dark outside.  We quickly left the area.  We walked toward S. Washington Street.  And that side of street felt okay.

It was not a pleasant experience, but it was not the restaurant&#39;s fault.  Just be aware if you decide to eat dinner there."

That&#39;s bacon mushroom and bleu cheese, always a good combination.  The meat was perfectly cooked to medium, as I requested, with just the right amount of pink inside.  Very juicy and flavorful and obviously a high quality beef, and an ample portion too, perhaps 6 oz, though the very friendly and attractive waitress did not know for sure.  Photos posted here show this burger started out at $8, but I found it to be $9.50, as it is currently, perhaps a little too pricey.  Stupidly, I declined a side, assuming there would be a savings, but ended up paying the full amount for just the burger.  My own fault for not reading the menu fully. 

I ate outside, since it was a nice early fall afternoon, but the problem here is this place is located on what has always been one of the sketchiest blocks in Seattle as far back as I can remember, and that&#39;s a long time.  So, of course there will be several homeless people to contend with, asking for money, engaging you in unwanted conversation, or perhaps, as on the day I visited, a scary mentally ill man screaming at unseen phantoms, as a SPD van circles the block several times doing absolutely nothing.  The biggest problem for these new Pioneer Square businesses is the prevalence of people who need help of one type or another, presenting a scary presence to locals and tourists alike.

As a treat to myself, I&#39;ll have one every once in awhile. On a Monday or Tuesday night (honestly cannot remember what day) my partner and I came here, having gone past it several times. 
I have to admit, I had never been to Dome burger so I have no idea how they changed overall. But I&#39;ll tell you about my experience there. 
It was pretty much empty when we went in, and being in the industry, in the neighborhood even, myself, this is pretty reasonable. Not too many residents in the area makes for slow week nights. Anyways, I ordered a Blue Moon and the hot mama medium rare with sweet potato fries. My partner ordered the Cajun chicken burger and regular fries. He LOVED his. Had absolutely no complaints, which is rare. As in has maybe happened once or twice before. He&#39;s super picky having been cooking within the industry for 7 years now, and has no qualms about expressing his opinions. 
I did have one critique though. Though my burger was fantastic, spicy enough for a good kick for accessible enough for those only wanting to venture out a little bit, it was over done. Medium well at best. But, it didn&#39;t ruin my burger. The quality of meat they use is bomb, so a slightly overlooked burger in my eyes wasn&#39;t terrible. If the cooks could master that, then I&#39;d be a 120% fan. Oh, and their sweet potato fries. OH MY GOODNESS. Amazing. Just amazing. Perfectly cooked, a little extra bits of crisp, almost as if they are battered after the initial fry. But their ranch... Subpar. For having sweet potato fries that spectacular, they should have better ranch, at least in my own sweet potato fan&#39;s opinion. 
Service was good, engaging but not over bearing. Which is the best kind in my opinion. 
Price wise, this place is awesome. $21 for our two sandwiches and my beer. Oh and my upgrade to sweet potato fries. And they use painted hills beef which is awesome. 
Overall, give this place a try. I hear their hh is awesome. But their beer variety isn&#39;t great. For being in such an IPA savvy city, they need to get an IPA on tap. Also, a porter. That coupled with a true medium rare burger would make this place perfect in my eyes."

We&#39;re always looking for new stuff to try and we noticed that they had a grand opening sign out front so we decided to try them out.

As a local, I gave the BRGR Bar a shot, and initially I thought it was okay. The place is small ... and I do mean SMALL. However, it is clean, and on game days has business. Other than that period, the place is empty. I also have read these reviews about service, burgers, etc; however, its hard to be slow when serving one table at a time. 

The Burgers are NOT as good as the suspicious reviews mention. It is not a foul burger; however, considering its high price, Jack in the Box is far better. The Chicken tenders are usually dry and over fried.  $5 for just 2 strips?? As for TV? Yes, there is TV, nothing special or big.

That all alone, and a number of other issues; do not warrant a single star, so why? Well, DO NOT ASK TO USE THE RESTROOM EVER! One, the main employee there will stop you in your tracks, and demand you buy. Not unusual these days; yet, I did see a very nice African American woman agree to pay almost $3 for a soda. A soda that the main server EVAN did not even bother to ask what soda she wanted; then becoming indignant that she would want the drink she paid for. Again, I remained silent. When the young woman came out to collect her drink and go on her visit to Seattle, EVAN said &#34;This isn&#39;t a pay toilet you know,&#34; in a voice of disgust. Then, when the woman obviously was taken back by such attitude, Evan became even more rude; at which I stopped the insult to the poor woman, who merely wanted to relieve herself. She was polite, paid for a large soda; yet, Evan still found her a bother to use his toilet. Soon after becoming so irate at myself, that he and BRGR Bar implied the woman was somehow less of a person, asking why I would care.. &#34;do you know her?&#34; I do not need to know a human of any type, to know injustice when I see it, The worst things happen every day, in small amounts, and it is the silence of good people that make it worse. In refused to stay silent. 

Eat there if you want, I would never be so cold as to read this, and still smile and eat their food. I am sure some will like this post, and want to eat there. I wouldn&#39;t want to be near that type of person."

I&#39;m a vegetarian so I can&#39;t speak to the meat Arepas but my friends love them. I&#39;d avoid the cheese arepa unless you REALLY love cheese because it&#39;s far too rich in my opinion.

So let&#39;s be fair over here. The foods are nice and I would highly recommend anyone who have no experience with Venezuelan dishes to give it a try. The malta polar is one of the thing people should give a try. It is pretty much a malz, tastes like beer/root beer, but not alcohol. Though on the other hand, the arepa is rather disappointing. *Make sure you read this*: there is no veggies inside the arepa, so depending on what you order, it will be loads of cheese (some melted while most stays dry) with meat/avocado/beans. Pabellon arepa is one thing that Yelp reviews have recommended, after giving a try, I just want to say think into it before you do the same thing with me. I had only one small piece of sweet plantain and barely some sliced beef in my arepa, which makes me feel like I&#39;m just having a cut-open pupusa filled with cheese and beans. 

Also, remember that you have to ask for the utensils yourself, otherwise they seem to expect you to eat with bare hands with everything (even with the epanadas and flan cake)"

All the ingredients were savory with some mild sweetness from the plantain. The gooey cheese bound everything together. The size was perfect for a meal, and they had two creamy house sauces available, one spicy, one milder cilantro. My only complaint would probably be that it was hard to keep the toppings in between the pieces of bread. Value was reasonable, $8-$9. I would definitely eat here again."

Authentic flavors, delicious corn shells (not that gross pastry dough they usually come in, and all homemade. Very affordable and delicious. Friendly service. Family owned. Always clean. I have ordered delivery too and it was also great.

Walked up and ordered empanadas and an arepa and a mango juice. The girl couldn&#39;t figure out how to work the register and entered in the arepa and the empanadas twice. I had to let her know she entered it in twice so she could redo it. My friend ordered her food along with a drip coffee and was told by the cashier that an Americano is the same as a drip coffee to them when my friend pointed out she wrote the wrong order down. ...not an auspicious start.

We got our food and it wasn&#39;t bad! Her food was better than mine (mine was all meat...her tomato really helped to lighten it up) but the meat was tender and juicy. When the empanadas came out, we asked the server if they were beef or chicken (we ordered both) and he was momentarily confused (&#34;chicken....no wait, beef!&#34;). Not a huge fan of their empanadas, but that&#39;s ok. I&#39;m pretty picky with my empanadas.  Their spicy condiment was better than the nonspicy condiment...that one was practically straight up mayo. The spicy one has some real heat to it though, so beware!

...halfway through my meal I realized my mango juice hadn&#39;t come out yet. I went to ask about it and they were making it right then. I assume they&#39;d forgotten about it as once they started making it, it came out really quickly. My friends drip coffee came out and was actually drip coffee because another lady in the kitchen had heard the order and made the right drink (it was pretty bad coffee, according to my friend).

The food would have been rated a 2.5 in my book, but with the service we experienced, I&#39;m downgrading to a 2. Now to find a place that has cafe con leche..."

I got the Cochino Felix Arepa, which came with shredded pork -- think of this as a deconstructed pupusa. Also, the cilantro sauce they have at every table was so good that we both doused our arepa in it! 

One thing I found a little annoying was that the owner (presumably) was sitting at one of the tables in the front in a full suit and eating endless arepa&#39;s - I don&#39;t know if I was jealous (of the arepas) or annoyed as he seemed a little &#34;full of himself&#34;, owning such a homey style restaurant, but flaunting himself and taking up a table for no reason.

The plantain nachos with beef was really good. The beef was well seasoned and the nachos were hot and crispy. It came with 5 plantain chips, shredded beef, and cheese on top. It is served with a pink sauce which is ketchup and mayo mixed together. 

The Peggy sandwich was good but a bit on the heavy side. The pork was cut in thick pieces and seasoned well. It was not dry at all. The bread was grilled on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

This is a casual dining spot where you walk up to order, seat yourself and bus your own table. I asked the cashier taking orders for her arepa recommendations, and she suggested any with pork or beef. So about half the menu, great!

My boyfriend and I split an order of beef empanadas and two arepas: Cochino Felix and Best Bart. We were in a slight rush and we worried by the 10-15 minute warning that was on the menu for arepas, but our food came out hot, fresh, and quick! Everything was in front of us within 5 minutes and piping hot.

Beef Empanadas: THESE THINGS ARE HEAVEN-SENT! I don&#39;t know how, and I don&#39;t know why, but these were so wonderfully crispy. Like unbreakable. Literally. I tried to break one in half and I couldn&#39;t because they were so crispy! Crunchy outside, wonderfully seasoned beef and veggie mixture inside. All praise, no complaints. I alternated between the creamy cilantro sauce and the creamy tomato sauce on with these. 10/10 WOULD ORDER AGAIN!

Cochino Felix: Pork, tomatoes, cilantro sauce. The arepa was soooooo warm and crispy - grilled to absolute perfection. I loved how this one was wrapped to make engulfing it (oops) so easy!

Best Bart: Pork, shredded beef, cilantro sauce. The flavors from the shredded beef were fabulous, but my only complaint was that the juices made the arepa really wet and the whole contraption fell apart very quickly. Soggy arepa was soaked in flavor, but I wish the crispy texture could&#39;ve been maintained because it was pretty hard to eat almost immediately. We thought the pork slices were quite dry in comparison to the beef, but it wasn&#39;t a dealbreaker.

Overall great, affordable grub. I can&#39;t wait to come back and try more of their menu items!"

The place is really cute. It&#39;s like a little colorful house that welcomes you with salsa/ Spanish music - perfect Latin American ambiance ;).

I ended up having to take out a lot of avocado/chicken from the Reina Pepiada, just finishing up the arepa bun itself. 

I had the same arepa Venezuela food in the Mission in SF, but it wasn&#39;t cloying at all. 

The tequenos are very bready also."

I had a really hard time pronouncing the name of what I got which I know isn&#39;t helpful but there is a picture of it on the Yelp entry for this place. I got a chicken and avocado Arepa which is a kind of a fry bread served as a sandwich with all kinds of options for what makes up the sandwich. The chicken and avocado was a sort of salad if you will by itself.I enjoyed the sandwich or Arepa very much!
I also had an appetizer of plantains with shredded beef and sauces which was very good!
Service is friendly and prompt. No complaints!"

We tried as much as we could, but the menu is large enough that we&#39;ll have to come back to sample it all.

You order and pay at the counter, and then they bring your food to your table. We didn&#39;t know anything about Venezuelan food, but the cashier was very helpful and patient in explaining what various things were and recommending stuff for newbies to try. She even came by our table later to ask how we liked the food.

For two people, we got the Cochino Felix pork arepa, beef empanadas, and tequeños (cheese breadsticks with dipping sauce). The arepa is a soft, doughy corn tortilla stuffed with tender, flavorful meat, about the size of an English muffin. One arepa is a good snack but not really a full meal, but combined with the soup or starters, it&#39;s filling. 

The empanadas are fried, crispy, and very hot, but had a really tasty braised beef filling that you can also get on the arepas. The tequeños had a thin, crusty bread shell around a still-solid stick of white cheese, so I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s like a cheese popper exactly, but it&#39;s similar. Cilantro haters, don&#39;t fear the &#34;cilantro sauce&#34; -- the cashier told us that it&#39;s made with minimal, if any, cilantro, and my cilantro-hating dining companion ate it happily and even went and got more! The fresh-blended mango juice ($3.50) was good, and they also have some Venezuelan malt sodas, colas, and soft drinks to choose from.

A fun, casual place to grab a quick meal or a snack before or after a movie. There are a variety of arepa flavors on the menu, with meat or vegetarian, so I&#39;m looking forward to coming back and trying the rest!"

The empanadas are good, but really I order them as an excuse to use a LOT of the creamy homemade cilantro sauce. :) There is a green version that is standard cilantro, and an orange one that is a spicier version. I like to use both at once for a hot/cool effect. The sweet plantains with cheese are another staple. Next time I want to try the cheese sticks.

The first time I ate here I ordered the Cochino Felix and I wasn&#39;t a fan. I assumed the pork would be flavored or saucy, but it was freshly sliced. No problem with a hunk of sliced meat, but I found the arepa to be a little on the dry/plain side.

Last night I ordered the Pabellon and I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. So good! I topped it with plenty of orange and green sauce, too.

It&#39;s pretty casual: food is served in disposable cups and plastic baskets lined with paper. Also note that the movie theater shares bathrooms with Arepa, so if you eat there at the wrong time there is a stream of people walking back and forth to use the restroom."

When we got there no one acknowledged us for about 5 minutes, in spite of standing feet away from two employees who saw us.  Once we ordered, the food took about 20 minutes to arrive, which we knew to expect, and is normally not a huge deal if it&#39;s good food.  It isn&#39;t.  Don&#39;t order anything with cheese!  They use a really cheap, dry, preshredded cheese that they do not melt.  It&#39;s disgusting.  Even Costco shredded cheese would be better than whatever they use.  I made the mistake of ordering the &#34;Double Cheese&#34; arepa, which was filled with raw shredded cheese.  Yuck!  The reason I gave this two stars was that the pork in the Cochino Felix was tasty, but the sauce they put on it takes away from the flavor of the pork.  The Tostones were utterly flavorless and dry.  Also, I&#39;m 99.9% sure the Guanabana they sell for $3.00 is a can of Jumex which you can buy anywhere for less than $1.00.  Please avoid this place!  
If you&#39;re looking for good Venezuelan food, the best place I&#39;ve found is sadly all the way down in Olympia.  A food truck named Arepa Latin Street Food.  If you find yourself in Olympia I highly recommend that place."

The tequenos (imagine swirl over n) and arepas are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!
I would recommend the pabellon to those who love sweet and savory and the reina pepiada for those that enjoy softer meals. Also, get your arepa fried! More calories but also more delicious.
Pabellon arepa- Delicious salty shredded beef (carne mechada), amazing black beans, and sweet fried platains
Reina pepiada arepa- avocado, shredded chicken, mayo, a little bit of spices (it is missing the traditional green apple chunks which add a delicious sweet crunch to the meal)

The tequenos are so good. They are Venezuela&#39;s version of mozzarella sticks. They are better. Way better. Eat it with their version of guasacaca. (green dipping sauce)

The emapandas are Colombian (I know, Venezuelan kitchen in the name with Caribbean food wahhh). They are all right. The cheese are the best, the chicken was meh, and the beef tasted good but had curry flavors which I wasn&#39;t expecting in my latin fare.

They have malta and frescolita, coveted Venezuelan sodas. The frescolita is like big red but softer flavor and the malta (I don&#39;t like this one despite my whole family dying for it) is brown. haha

Best flan I have every had! Not made in house. 

Very little seating and space. It gets VERY crowded by door (poor choice of cashier placement I believe).

It takes a long time to get your food AND it is a bit pricey. If you take into consideration the fact that this is authentic food made to order then the wait and price tends to be ignored.

come enjoy my favorite food (Venezuelan anythingggggg) and let your senses be drifted through time and space with merengue music playing and your taste buds enjoying every bite."

It was really delicious- corn meal pastry filled with black beans, sweet plantains, pork and cheese. It made a great meal and was really cheap! I also had a fantastic coffee (Americano).

I chose the Pabellon, which comes in a lightly crisped corn-based bun.

We went to Arepas with a Venezuelan friend and were expecting a mediocre food that ended up being beyond expectations. 

You order and pay at the counter and they bring the food to your table; according to my Venezuelan friend, PABELLON is the one they like the most because it has everything in it plus plantain. I am not a big fan of plantain, so I ordered BEST BART arepa which had shredded beef and pork in it. The bread is super soft, served hot and just melts as you bite into it. It is not too spicy and the spices are all used to moderation making the overall flavor perfect. My friends also ordered CHICKEN AVOCADO and even though, it was just like any other chicken avocado sandwich, the arepa took it to another level. 
Overall, the food was a really good fast food. The service was not stellar and our dishes were served at  different times which is a negative point to me. The price is very reasonable. Each Arepa is about $7-8, but they are not too big either and one might not be enough to fill you up. I would definitely go back."

The staff were super friendly and helpful and the restaurant is clean with a nice fireplace for cold days to come. This is supposed to be a very authentic casual, everyday Venezuelan food.

The folks working there are members of the two families I undeestand own the place, and they were as warm and inviting as their food.  

That part of the Ave is under construction, so hopefully y&#39;all are deliberate about visiting, &#39;cause until the food options are reestablished (and the walk-up traffic restored), there is a risk this place could be overlooked.

I always get excited by new places with under-appreciated cuisines, especially South American, to get a change from the usual rice and beans of empanadas and pupusas. (yes, there is Latino food that&#39;s not Mexican or Salvadorean or Brazilian)
I got the Cochino Felix (among others!), and the nice slabs of fresh pork just crumble in your mouth. They do take some time to make, but that&#39;s because nothing is started until you order, like many street foods. Once it does come, good luck trying to put it down-- you&#39;ll feel a tinge of regret at how fast you wolfed it down. There&#39;s also a white sauce, which like the mystery shawarma white sauce, is made of who knows what, but goes great with anything.

The arepas here are decent, overall, but not exceptional.  They were a little under-done, but i actually kind of like that.  Cochino Felix was dry and lacked flavor.  Shredded beef was good, though a bit one-sided, and quickly made the arepa soggy; if i were to get this again, i&#39;d add cheese.  Llanera was quite tasty (albeit a little cheese-heavy).

THE WAIT

Arepas are supposed to be fairly quick.  Indeed, they&#39;re often sold as street food!  We waited over 30 minutes for two, and another 15 for the third (they were all ordered at the same time).  I&#39;d say that a better tactic would be to order, ask how long the wait will be, go do something else, and return later for the food.  The downside is that if you arrive late, some of your arepas might be soggy.

THE INTERIOR

The ambience is kind of fast-food-y.  I don&#39;t mind this, but i wouldn&#39;t make a date spot out of it.

The arepas are as close as you can get to the real thing in this corner of globe... and way better than in many Venezuelan &#39;areperas&#39; in Miami. 
I think I&#39;ve tried every arepa on the menu, and the pork and the chicken ones are my favorite ones. Haven&#39;t tried the empanadas yet.
However, don&#39;t go there if you&#39;re in a hurry. It takes a long time to receive your order. Until they figure out to make the arepas faster, bu mindful that you may spend there a good 15-30 mins. waiting for all your arepas to be ready...

Order at the counter and sit outside on the patio. Nice folks. Arepas are big. We tried the pabellon (black bean, plantain, and beef), cochino felix (pork and tomato with cilantro sauce) and reina pepiada (chicken and avocado). Three arepas was more than two people could finish. Pabellon arepa was a runaway favorite - so yummy. Cilantro sauce on the cochino felix was good too but pork was overcooked.

1. The service was so, so, so, slow.  But I think we just had bad luck. We arrived after a big group so our food took for ever and it did not come at the same time. 
2. The Tres Leches dessert was not good at all.  It tasted stale 

Now on the bright side, The arepas are the real deal!  OMG they are soooo good! They reminded me of the arepas they sell at the Caracas airport, not sure if they still sell them there because this was prior to Chavez and Maduro ruining that great country.  (Sorry, I shall not go into politics or religion on my reviews) 

Back to the food.... We had the Reina Pepiada (chicken salad), the Pabellon (Shredded beef, cheese, black beans, and maduritos), the super yummy colombian empanadas, the beef soup (special of the day), and the cheese sticks. Everything was delicious.  Also really good and highly recommended: their mango and passion fruit juices. 

You must go and give them a try!"

Beef Empanadas were delicious. No idea what&#39;s in the little pot of green condiment that comes with it but I looooved it. Totally complements the beef. And also cuts that fried taste too. 

The Best Bart. So much meat. Which is a good thing. But I was full from the empanada. My only thing would be that I&#39;d have liked a bottle of cilantro sauce in the table so I could keep putting that heavenly green sauce on. Mind you if I got up and asked I&#39;m sure they&#39;d have hooked me up. 

My hubby had the Pabellon. Again loved it. Would have liked the plantation to be a little more evenly distributed throughout but honestly that comes down to how you eat it as well.

Overall this place was so good to find. We&#39;ll definitely go back to sample more of the menu.

Oh and the staff were perfectly lovely. They&#39;re efficient, attentive without being annoying. Almost like you&#39;re at a friend&#39;s place and the family are making kick ass food."

You simply can&#39;t beat the authenticity and flavor of their arepas selection. They make their arepas large, almost sandwich/burrito sized, so one arepa is good for a single person.

As a part-Venezuelan, that&#39;s something I never expected here, apart from the variety of dishes at Mojito&#39;s and the arepas at some farmer&#39;s markets. But I guess enough Venezuelans have finally made there way way up here to the Pacific Northwest, with all that&#39;s going on in the country...
   Anyway, the restaurant is very cute and decorated with Venezuelan trinkets. The big TV in the middle of the seating area was useful as my first visit happened to be the day of the San Bernardino shooting :-( , but I usually don&#39;t like the distractions of TVs when I&#39;m eating out. The main menu also happened to be on TVs (what a big waste of energy), and it was clear and easy to read, and it also means they can correct mis-spellings easily (for example &#34;gilled&#34; should be &#34;grilled&#34;, &#34;TEQUENOS&#34; should be &#34;TEQUEÑOS&#34;, and &#34;sodas&#34; should be &#34;pop&#34;). And the second time I was there, they had annoying cliché pop Christmas music on. Venezuela has some beautiful and festive Christmas songs! Why not put on some of this?
   Also, the neighborhood is not the greatest. One block north, a whole row of buildings seems to have been boarded up and possibly condemned. Could be redevelopment, but I also believe I&#39;ve heard of crime there. But I&#39;ve been out of town a lot, so I&#39;m not too sure. Just be aware.
   But on to the food! I of course make arepas myself from time to time, and of course no one beats the way mom makes them, in any family. ;-) In two visits I&#39;ve tried the reina pepiada (chicken and avocado), the cochino Felix (pork, tomatoes, and cilantro sauce), and a bite of the cheese arepa. All of them were really delicious!, with the cochino Felix being the best. It was one that you just had to take bite after bite without stopping. The reina pepiada was good, but unfortunately the avocados were over-mashed into the sauce, with maybe a bit too much mayonnaise. Do a search of &#34;reina pepiada&#34; online and you&#39;ll see chunks or slices of avocado; that&#39;s what it should be like, or what I prefer. The taste was still good, though.
   However... I have a complaint about the arepas themselves before the filling. ...But it&#39;s an understandable complaint, again, going back to the situation in Venezuela. Here at Arepa Venezuelan Kitchen, the arepas are far too thin. They are using the minimum amount of masa (dough) to make each arepa as thin as possible. It could be their style. But my guess is that it&#39;s because Harina PAN (the Venezuelan corn flour) is such a precious resource these days, and harder to find, as simple staples have become scarce in Venezuela. For years, Harina PAN hasn&#39;t even been exported to the US from Venezuela; the supply we got here was from Colombia. And recently, the newest packages of Harina PAN say &#34;Made in the USA&#34;, which almost brought tears to my eyes, because it shows how much Venezuela has changed. In the 1980s, my grandparents sent us Harina PAN in the mail. But little by little, markets started selling it around Seattle. Around 10 years ago (2005), we could buy it at El Mercado Latino at the Pike Place Market, a latino grocery store in Greenwood, a bodega on Beacon Hill, and at the Holman Road QFC. But now, the only place that seems to have it is El Mercado Latino. So I asked the friendly folks at Arepa Venezuelan Kitchen where they got their Harina PAN, and they said they get it shipped from California. Though they have shelves with like 50 packages displayed in their kitchen, it still must be difficult and expensive for them to &#34;import&#34; their main ingredient from another state. So for me, knowing the whole situation explains why their arepas are so thin. They need to conserve their Harina PAN as much as possible. However, the arepas would be that much tastier if they were thicker. I would dock 1 star from a review due to the thin arepas, but knowing the situation with Harina PAN and Venezuela, I&#39;m keeping the review at 4 stars. With little improvements (spelling, TV, music, and the reina pepiada), they would easily deserve 5 stars. ¡Gracias!"

For a party of 5 on a Saturday night, we were seated fairly quickly! It was stuffy inside the restaurant but they were able to prop the door open so we were A-OK! 

Drinks: My SO and I ordered the Squirley Shirley and the Creamed soda. Both were soo flavorful and refreshing! The Creamed soda had actual vanilla bean bits floating in it! I definitely recommend both. If you&#39;re feeling something tropical and fruity, go for the Squirley. If you&#39;re feeling something light and sweet, def the creamed soda.

Food: I ordered the half rack of ribs with cornbread and slaw and my SO ordered the brisket with fries and cornbread. We also took the plunge and ordered a mac and cheese with pulled pork and carmelized onions since people raved about it so much on Yelp!
Okay - I LOVE me some cornbread but this cornbread was not at all what I expected.. It was crumbly (the bad kind) and dry..the kind that gets stuck in your throat and you feel like gagging. The huge scoop of butter didn&#39;t help either so that was a huge disappointment. The meat (ribs and brisket) however were excellent. Esp. the brisket. It was juicy, tender and full of flavor. Paired with the sweet sauce, oooooh I can just taste it now!

Mac and cheese - this dish lives up to the hype. It comes with hearty bits of pulled pork and it&#39;s cheesy to the max! I put some sweet sauce on it and it was heaven.

Service: The servers here are friendly and check in on you frequently to make sure your drinks are filled and you are pleased with your meal! Even when it was packed and busy, they made themselves available if we needed something.

Overall, although the cornbread was disappointing, the rest was good enough that I would definitely go back if i&#39;m craving some good BBQ."

And I consider myself fairly knowledgable about BBQ having been to Franklin and La Barbecue in Austin TX and Mighty Quinn&#39;s in NYC. 

We came for a late brunch at 3pm on a Saturday. Ordered the &#34;Cowboy Killer&#34; combo which was a terrific value (we had a whole dinner&#39;s worth of leftovers for two!). It came with delicious brisket, a rack of fantastic ribs, a chicken, and pulled pork. 

The brisket was off the chain - part lean and part marbled; perfectly cooked. But I also recommend trying pulled pork, chicken, and ribs because they were incredibly tender and filled with smokey flavor that was consistent with the work of a true BBQ artist!!

PS - get the Bloody Mary if you&#39;re in the mood, it was top notch!!"

Normally, I think of BBQ joints as back yard picnic food affair but Bitterroot BBQ tries to elevate it, which didn&#39;t work out too well this time.

My party ended up getting the beef brisket, ribs, and cornbread. The meat came with two sides which we ended up getting the kale, baked beans, potato salad, and lemon garlic broccoli.

The food itself was pretty good, except for the corn bread which was really dry. The meats were tender and moist and they had 4 different BBQ style of sauces to try out. I really liked the sweet BBQ sauce which went really well with the fatty brisket. The sides were pretty ordinary, they were good but not amazing. 

Portion sizes were a bit small for the price in my opinion. Between Bitterroot and the Boar&#39;s Nest, I think the Boar&#39;s nest takes the prize for better BBQ in Ballard."

We stumbled in here hoping to find a beer or some kind of a cocktail. Luckily we found a sweet nugget of love in the form of a beautifully crafted Bloody Mary. Mind you, this was at 5pm in the evening and it was about 38deg outside, so it was quite the environment for a bloody while on vacation. Haha it&#39;s weird having bloodys at night, but when you&#39;re on vacation it&#39;s actually perfect because it validates your thirst for vacation relaxation. 

Some notes on the Bloody - 
Nice and spicy
Candied bacon that was amazing
Served with great hospitality from the bartender

Great job!"

The macaroni and cheese consisted of a large portion of macaroni and very little cheese. The brisket was very tough and needed a steak knife to cut it.

Bitterroot BBQ, located in the Ballard neighborhood of northwest Seattle, introduced me to the idea. After dining at Bitterroot, I can&#39;t say the BBQ I&#39;ve tried here is significantly different than the BBQ I&#39;ve had back home. I&#39;m not an expert -- ultimately, it&#39;s all smoked meats (pork, beef, chicken) and sauces to me. One of the biggest differences between Bitterroot&#39;s BBQ and other regional BBQ varieties is the use of Washington state applewood to smoke the meats.

Bitterroot is located in a section of Ballard filled with restaurants and bars housed in old warehouses and office buildings just a couple blocks from Salmon Bay. The narrow yet deep restaurant has an appealing modern-rustic look, one that isn&#39;t uncommon among contemporary BBQ and farmstead fare restaurants. Think reclaimed wood, exposed brick, etc. It&#39;s nicely designed. The bar is in the back and the kitchen is mostly closed off save for a long window to carry out orders.

Bitterroot is named after the Bitteroot River in Montana where the founders used to fly fish. A map of this river is illustrated on the menu cover.

The restaurant serves chicken, sausage, catfish, beef brisket, pork belly, pulled pork, baby back ribs, rib tips, pork shank, and St. Louis style ribs. Each tray, which includes two sides, will set you back about $15-20. Some of these meats are available in sandwich form. There are salads, soups, and appetizers like hush puppies and fried chicken livers too. In addition, Bitterroot offers large bowls of mac &amp; cheese ($12 each) that come with your choice of different meat and veggie ingredients (nearly 10 to choose from).

I visited with a group on a Friday shortly after the business&#39; 11am opening. Almost empty upon arrival, the place was busy by the time we left (folks were waiting on our table). The restaurant is open late: 11am-2am, daily, with food served until 1am. Perfect for late night dining.

We ended up ordering two &#34;Cowboy Killer&#34; trays at our table, plus a couple orders of mac and cheese, and an assortment of a la carte meats, starters, and sides. The Cowboy Killer is a $48 tray consisting of 1/2 a smoked chicken, beef brisket, ribs, pulled pork, and three sides. It&#39;s ideal for groups. Thus we got to try a lot of what this place has to offer.

Here&#39;s a rundown of what I tried:

Mac &amp; Cheese:
* Mac &amp; Cheese with bacon lardons and pulled pork

Meats:
* Smoked 1/2 Chicken
* Sliced Beef Brisket
* Pulled Pork with pickled red onions
* Baby Back Ribs

Sides:
* Braised Greens with bacon
* Spicy Roasted Cauliflower
* Green Beans with garlic and walnuts
* Cast Iron Cornbread with honey butter
* Coleslaw
* Hand-Cut Fries

Straightforward and attractive plating and presentation all-around. Like other contemporary BBQ restaurants, Bitterroot serves their meats on metal trays lined with paper.

The mac &amp; cheese was terrific. No wonder why they have a special section for it on the menu. These are full entree-sized servings of mac &amp; cheese, not small side servings. The dish I had consisted of elbow macaroni, melted cheese, minced parsley, and grated cheese (Parmesan I think). The optional bacon and pulled pork were cooked into the mac &amp; cheese. This was a very flavorful, rich, and expectedly heavy but satisfying dish.

The meats are dry-rubbed and served without any sauce. Four sauces are provided at the table: sweet, mustard, spicy, and vinegar. I tried all four and thought they were okay. None particularly stood out, though I preferred the sweet which is made with apples and Coke.

I thought the meats were fine. Generally, they weren&#39;t as tasty as I was expecting, but I didn&#39;t think anything was bad. The meat quality was good. They just seemed to be lacking in flavor and smokiness. Sauce was a must.

The pork was pulled into fine strands and was juicy, tender, and a bit fatty. I liked the pickled red onions. They did a good job offsetting all the meatiness. The slices of brisket were thick and hearty. The smoked chicken and ribs were par for the course. Both were moist and tender, but once again, weren&#39;t terribly flavorful.

The sides fared much better with the cornbread my hands-down favorite. A triangular slice of scrumptious cornbread was served with a large helping of cooled honey butter. The braised collards and spicy cauliflower were savory. I added vinegar to my greens and I enjoyed the seasoning on the cauliflower. The green beans had an appetizing, somewhat creamy, garlic sauce and a subtle snap to them. The fries were moderately thick with crispy exteriors and little potato skin.

Someone in our group ordered the pink pickled deviled eggs with bacon and greens ($5 app) and it looked fantastic. I didn&#39;t try any, but heard they were excellent.

Heather was our server and she did a great job handling our group.

Overall, I give Bitterroot 3.5 stars rounded down to 3 (&#34;A-OK&#34;)."

I got the Deviled Eggs and Bibb Salad, both of which were very good, well plated, and somewhat tiny. It&#39;s a fancy place, so that&#39;s what you get!

The price, the quality, and the service were all impeccable. I personally ordered the burger which was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. My roommate ordered the Mac n&#39; Cheese which was enough for two meals.

For drinks we had bartenders choice of bourbon and her combination which was topped of with the best caramelized piece of bacon I have ever enjoyed. Again, with everything said the most amazing part was how reasonably priced it was. The only drawback to this great eatery is the wait. There is normally a line and the wait can be very long since it&#39;s such a small restaurant. Besides the wait this place is top of the list for BBQ in Ballard.

What an awesome spot to grab some late night munchies. Would be perfect after hanging out at the bars in Ballard. They also offer a happy hour menu 11pm-1am.

I was pretty disappointed initially because I had my heart set on brisket, which they had run out of. They were also out of ribs, which was my second choice. Sad times. I guess for 1am, the fact that I&#39;m able to order bbq at all is pretty great so maybe I should count my blessings..? I just wanted that brisket though!

I ended up ordering the pulled pork, which was just okay. It was pretty dry, and I had to cut into it to make some bite-sized pieces, which was upsetting for bbq. Ended up using tons of the sweet bbq sauce, which was pretty good. But another thing that was ridiculously dry was the corn bread! The honey butter was delicious though, so I ended up problem solving by slathering copious amounts of honey butter on everything. Not bad. 

We also ordered the pickled deviled eggs (cool that they were pink), and they were certainly very pickled and vinegary. Could have used something sweet (maybe more maple?) to offset this.

Oddly, the best thing we ordered was the wings from the happy hour menu. Maybe because they were made to order and came out hot. 

Overall this place was just okay. I&#39;d like to try it sometime during the day to see if the food is better when it&#39;s fresher, or when they have brisket or ribs available. The search for good Seattle bbq continues..."

They chose Bitterroot BBQ.

Bitterroot was not at all what I had expected, but not in a bad way! It looked nothing like what I had imagined a BBQ joint to be like, making it a rather pleasant surprise for me (I should have googled it before we wandered over, but alas I had not). Our party of 5 was also rather large for a more intimate place, and we were told it&#39;d be a 20 minute wait for a table, but this ended up being only about 10 minutes - score!

I ordered the mac and cheese, my friend the pulled pork sandwich, while the rest of our table each ordered the smoked pork shank. The mac and cheese was customizable with 2 ingredients, so I added pulled pork and smoked jalapenos to it. What a great decision that was! The pulled pork was perfectly tender and juicy despite being cooked with the mac and cheese, while the jalapenos added a perfect pop of flavor, balancing out the cheese. The pasta was a tad bit firmer than I had expected it to be, but perhaps this was due to my low expectations after having some overcooked pasta recently. The portion was huge! - I ended up taking home more than half of it. This was probably the best $12 I&#39;ve spent in a long time. I didn&#39;t get to try any of my friend&#39;s pulled pork sandwich, but based off of the pulled pork in my mac and cheese, I&#39;m sure it was delicious.

The pork shank was the biggest surprise I had. I originally was considering ordering the pork belly and had asked her how much it would be - she held out her hands and it looked to be a little bit larger than a dollar bill. We had assumed that the pork shank would be able the same size. Boy, were we wrong! Each of the platters that came out were huge! Perhaps not quite the size of a Disneyland turkey leg, but they were pretty close. As my friend stated at the table, &#34;Man I should have asked her for the VOLUME of the piece of pork!&#34; because it was much more than we had anticipated. I only had a bite, but this was also well seasoned and perfectly cooked. I&#39;ll definitely be making a trip back to Bitterroot in the near future to try more of their meats!"

The flavors were solid but most of the meats were room temp or colder.

Even soaked in honey butter most of it went to waste. Fries would have been great, but they were overly salted. For me, ribs should fall right off each other. These were so tough I had to use a steak knife to cut them apart, and after all that they had no flavor. His mac and cheese was mostly just elbow macaroni with some red pepper and a tablespoon of pork and maybe a teaspoon of cheese.

The service was real swell, nice bartender.

I ordered a bloody Mary that came with pickled cauliflower, pickled pear, and olive, and bacon jerky, all were exceptional. The bloody Mary was spicy at cost $10. A little steep but it was good and decked out. I ordered mac &amp; cheese with bacon and peas and it was tasty. I would never balk about extra cheese and pretty much any mac and cheese can always use more in my opinion..this was no exception but the cheese level was adequate enough. The serving is HUGE, I took the leftovers home and it made two more meals.

Back to the livers. Fried (and most likely breaded) livers in a very tangy sauce... yep, just how I like them.
Shredded pork was good also... not a big bun (think sliders) but lots of pork.
Cocktails were good. I recommend!"

While neither of us has rigorously tested this hypothesis yet, my underwhelming experience at Bitterroot certainly poses no counterexample.

Walking into the restaurant, I noticed two things immediately: 1) the interior of the restaurant is really homey and comfortable, but 2) there is no A/C. I&#39;ve discovered that (2) is relatively common among stores/restaurants in Seattle, but in any case, I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here on a hot day.

We ordered the house cured and smoked pork belly (which comes with two sides - we went with the cast-iron cornbread and the cheddar grits) along with the burger (which we added pulled pork to). The most successful of these was the burger, and even that was just okay - while it tasted decent, it was too cluttered with the competing flavors of BBQ and blue cheese and caramelized onions. The grits were coagulated into a sad rubbery lump, the cornbread was crumbly and flavorless (despite liberally applying the included honey butter), and the pork belly was tough and almost impossible to cut through (I was literally sawing at it with the knife, to no avail.)

Service was pretty average, nothing particularly positive or negative in this regard.

Perhaps we ordered the wrong dishes - the mac and cheese that a neighboring table ordered looked pretty tasty. But there are so many other good restaurants on this street, and you won&#39;t be losing out by giving this one a miss."

Best thing about our visit was the staff.  We had a large group and they were so accommodating!! We will be back! GO GRIZ!"

Was promptly greeted and chose to sit at the bar at the back. A word of caution: it was in the 80s and Bitterroot, which doesn&#39;t have A/C, was uncomfortably warm inside. Can&#39;t imagine it on a 90-degree day.

Server helped us promptly and was friendly. Decent beer selection was a bit pricey.

Ordered my usual: half rack of ribs with slaw and baked beans. The slaw was missing something; might have been as simple as salt and pepper. Beans were somewhat bland and a disappointment. Ribs were smoked and the meat stuck to the bone as it should. Would have been nice if they were cut. Ribs were OK, but they just weren&#39;t as good as ribs I&#39;ve had in KC. Had the hot sauce, which had plenty of heat at to the detriment of flavor.

May return for happy hour and $5 pulled pork sandwiches, but my quest for amazing BBQ in the PNW continues..."

The Mac and cheese never disappoints. Most recently I added pulled pork abs caramel used onions to mine and it was delicious. The serving size is huge and I had the rest for lunch the following day. 

My husband has gotten the pork shank both times and I steal as much as I can from it/him! 

My favorite sides are the collard greens and the corn bread. The spicy cauliflower was really good, too!

I vaguely remember eating some sort of bread pudding on our first visit, but was very full! 

I do not, however, recommend the pork belly. Also this most recent time our hush puppies were fried in some old grease, they weren&#39;t as good as before."

Damon was our bartender/server =amazing!!! Drinks have lotz of whiskey &amp; more whiskey = can&#39;t complain there. Their sides ~ grits, greens, fries, beans are beyond!

NOT SO PROS :::
Food was well-portioned, but for $17+....I&#39;d like more than 3 pieces of brisket. The BBQ was super dry too. :&#39;(   The only seating was in the bar area, which was fine, but it was super windy outside &amp; freezing + the fans were blasting cold air (what the...?!)

Really easy to get to from Golden Gardens and for 5pm on a Monday, parking was easy to find too. 

There was seating for us right away in the front of the restaurant, where we could enjoy the eclectic atmosphere. I enjoyed everything about the space!!!!! The wood panel wall, brick walls, chain-link fence painted white behind us, huge hanging light bulbs, tiny succulents spread throughout and the abundance of natural light from the huge windows. 

The service was spot on!!!!! The waitress was bubbly and prompt, relaxed and easy going. Our food cam out within 10 minutes of ordering it. 

We had been drinking that day so we just had water. It was a little disappointing that it was luke warm, but we drank it anyway. 

The HH was incredible!!!!! So many choices that you would actually want to order!!! My friend had the Cowboy Nachos ($5!!!!). PERFECT portion, enough shredded pork and he desperately wanted to lick the tray after he was finished. The bbq sauces they offered tableside complimented our dishes well. 

I had the 1/2 rack Baby Back Ribs, cheddar grits and broccoli ($18, not on HH). The ribs were tender and pulled off the bone nicely, the grits were a little too dense but were very tasty and the broccoli had almost no seasoning; like they were steamed and that&#39;s it. 

Next time I&#39;ll try their pulled pork sandwich, greens and baked beans...and definitely check out the bat in the back."

Bitteroot was recommended by friend who swears by the Buffalo Chicken Livers. Being a huge fan of chicken livers I had to try them.

So I came for the chicken livers and then discovered the whiskey selection. I was totally wowed by how much great whiskey they stock here. You can also get candied bacon with your whiskey. There is something other worldly about a shot of whiskey chased by chomping on a nice piece of candied bacon. I could see myself coming here just to drink. The bar in back is also super cool. 

The food was amazing also, the mac and cheese menu is probably the best I have ever seen. We had mac and cheese with pulled pork and collard greens. I could try and explain how delicious it was but suffice to say I don&#39;t think my words would do it justice.The pulled pork nachos were also amazing. 

The Chicken Livers were every bit as close to heaven as I imagined they would be. The livers are fried and then tossed in buffalo sauce and served with a side salad. The entire dish is incredible, the salad is very tasty and does a great job of balancing the spiciness of the chicken livers. 

I cant say very much bad about Bitterroot except that I think they should maybe not call themselves BBQ as it seems like they excel more at whiskey and chicken livers. If you are in Ballard definitely give this spot a try!"

After visiting a variety of different BBQ joints, I made a decision that the Bitterroot restaurant is definitely one of the best places to have some good barbecue in Seattle. 

The restaurant is located in the heart of Ballard, which is a very lively, modern and interesting neighborhood to visit. But you have to be very careful not to miss the place, because it is a bit inconspicuous. Inside the restaurant, it is small but quite cozy, and it consists of two parts - dining area and bar. The weird thing is that they close the dining area after 8-9 pm, but the kitchen is still open,  and they make you sit in the bar table, even if you want to order plenty of food. So, it was a really ridiculous situation. We were trying to have our dinner at the crowded bar despite the fact that there was a whole empty dining area. 

Anyway, the food totally surpassed all disappointments. The baby back ribs were amazing! The meat was very tender and succulent. I liked the fact that they didn&#39;t put any barbecue sauce on top of the ribs, so you can enjoy the smoky and aromatic taste of the real pork. The ribs were so good by themselves that I didn&#39;t want to interrupt myself from stop eating them. I strongly recommend a visit to Bitterroot restaurant. 

Also, the prices are more than reasonable. 
Yelp Tip: Come to the restaurant before they close the dining area."

The food is okay at best, and a little expensive for what it is. The spinach &amp; orzo salad is, unfortunately, my favorite item at this BBQ joint. The meats (brisket, pork, and chicken) have been fairly dry each time I order a sandwich (and the bun is ridiculously tiny), the baked beans are under-seasoned (it helps to add a lot of BBQ sauce and mustard, but then it becomes a soup), and the pickled deviled eggs just taste very strange.

I personally prefer the BBQ from Kickin&#39; Boot or Bourbon &amp; Bones.

The atmosphere is pleasant-- very hipster-ish and rustic, and the staff has always been great."

It is also very moist. The ribs are awesome and all the side dishes are excellent.  They offer three or four different types of sauces.  All very nice.

I had a great time at happy hour, so I decided it&#39;d be worth it to give it a try for dinner. While I&#39;d say this is a 3 star happy hour (A-OK), it&#39;s a 1 star dinner (I won&#39;t be going back). So 2 star compromise?

(the A-OK) Happy hour: I really liked the chicken wings and jalapeno hushpuppies. Their twist on the old fashioned was also yummy! I think their pulled meat sandwiches (chicken, pork, and beef) are super sucky though. Yuck.

Sauces: I really like the 3 bbq sauces they have on the table! Yum!

(the reason I won&#39;t be returning) Dinner: Of course they were sold out of the pork shank and St Louis ribs (it was before 8pm on a week night, so I was a little annoyed). The catfish I ordered was 99% breading! I ended up picking off over half the breading so I could actually taste the fish. The greens allegedly were made with bacon, but I didn&#39;t see or taste evidence of this. The baked beans were bland as heck. I had to add spicy bbq sauce and vinegar. Plus, they&#39;re more like refried beans: mushy and pasty. 

Plus, don&#39;t even bother going here on a hot day. They have 0 ventilation, so the restaurant feels like being enclosed in a big, bbq pit with no breeze. The bar is a little better, but it&#39;s dark and less inviting."

Drinks were creative and good. Meat was all delicious, but didn&#39;t knock me off my feet. Their mac and cheese was perfectly sufficient but also didn&#39;t blow us away. I thought their cornbread portion was small for the $4 charge.

Decor and ambiance were good - the bar is really nice. I think they could do without the big screen TV. It was very distracting.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon  with a party of 7 for a late lunch after wandering around the farmer&#39;s market. There was about a 45 min to an hour wait, but no big deal, we didn&#39;t mind waiting. The restaurant ha kind of an industrial/rustic/chic vibe with exposed brick, reclaimed wood and iron. 

**Side note, there are two restrooms - one towards the front near the bar and the other in the back. They are not marked male or female, just use whichever one happens to be available. Very clean and well maintained. Didn&#39;t notice if there was a changing table, but the restaurant offers highchairs so they are pretty family-friendly.

 We started with a couple orders of the hush puppies cocktails.  I ordered the BBQ Chicken with sides of garlic green beans and spicy roasted cauliflower. Wow this meal was good! That spicy cauliflower was probably my favorite of the whole meal, really tasty. The half chicken was perfectly prepared, juicy and flavorful. The meals are served on metal trays with your food items separated so you can enjoy the flavors individually. They offer three choices of homemade BBQ sauces to add to your meats (a sweet bbq, hot sauce, and honey mustard), and our group quickly smothered them all over their pulled pork and ribs. I stole some bites off my mom&#39;s plate of BBQ ribs, these were very meaty ribs and the sauce was tasty. The cornbread was pretty dry in my opinion, my mom makes it better herself. But overall the experience and service was great, and we all left with happy bellies."

The coleslaw is one of the best side options, it&#39;s perfectly seasoned, crunchy, and refreshing (not too watery or anything).

Pulled Pork, dry as bones, brisket, flavorless and dry as though it had been sitting out all day, uncovered. No smoke ring. No bark. No taste. Smoked chicken, ghostly in appearance and tasted like a grease ball of flavorless flesh. No smoke taste, color...nada. At Louis ribs somewhat good. Cornbread, cold and dry. Collard and baked beans were ok. But stay away from the deviled eggs. Alpo dog food would taste better.

However, at this place, I&#39;ll make an exception! 5$ at Happy Hour for a huge amount of nachos covered in pulled pork, barbecue sauce and a white sauce? YES SIR! That shit was delicious. The drinks were also 5$, and were very well made. Also, Chris, the bar manager is an incredibly awesome and friendly due. Definitely say hi! I think I had the full dinner a while back, and 2 out of the 3 entrees were delicious. It&#39;s not the best bbq I&#39;ve ever had, but bbq in Seattle is limited."

There is a back door into a small whiskey bar that was pretty neat. The bartender knew his drinks and was welcoming and unpretentious as some crafty bartenders can be. I had the vanilla bean (they make their own vanilla bean simple syrup) old fashioned and it was yummy. A little on the sweet side but still good. I also tried the house fireball&#39;esque whiskey. This was super sweet and syrupy. I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again. It was more of a sipping liquor than a shot. 
I want to come back and try the food and give a more detailed review. But if you&#39;re looking for a hidden gem bar, I would go around the back and head into the bar area."

Josh and I had the hankering for BBQ.  We weren&#39;t sure which place to visit, so we just parked and walked, as has been our custom as of late.  As we walked along we checked out the menus posted at most restaurant front windows.  When we came upon Bitterroot, the menu seemed just too hard to pass up. As we walked inside we were greeted immediately.  The dining room looked very nice and warm.  The waitress asked if we wanted to sit at a table or go back to the bar.  We elected the bar, which was down a ramp toward the back of the establishment.
 
As I walked into the bar, I thought that it looked like an entirely different place.  I mean it was like &#34;steam punk&#34; meets &#34;back stage&#34;.  Green painted cinder block walls and shop grade stainless on the tables and bar.  Bitterroot is a whiskey joint.  I looked at the abundant whiskey menu and counted three trillion, four hundred seventy five million, two hundred and sixty three thousand, five hundred and seventy three distinct whiskeys.  In the interest of total disclosure, there is a slight possibility that I may have counted one of them twice...I ordered a gin &amp; tonic...heh.
 
For dinner I went with the pork belly with greens and beans for the sides.  The meal was a little slow, but it arrived in a fair amount of time on a stainless steel tray (go figure).  The greens were great as were the beans.  The pork belly was kind of bland on its own, but when I used the sweet bbq sauce (recommended by the bartender) it was really quite good.
 
All in all, I think we would have had a better experience if we elected to stay in the dining room.  Those two places are day and night (the dining room and the bar, that is).  It&#39;s strange that I would even think of it as two different places, don&#39;t ya think?
 
Anyway, I am going with three start for Ballard&#39;s Bitterroot.  The place is LOADED with potential, but IMHO they miss the mark of what they could be.

Josh: Last night we went to Bitterroot in Ballard, right in the heart of the Ballard ave. scene. They have a hip little dining room with a bar in the back. We opted to sit at the bar, which might have ended up being a mistake (not a huge one) because it was just the 2 of us and a bartender that was low on conversation. He made up for his seeming introversion with a very non era appropriate facial hair styling that was simply fun to look at. 

We took our seats at the bar and started looking the menu over.  Lots of good looking dishes all throughout. Our bartender took our drink orders while we were checking things out, I went with a bourbon he recommended that turned out really damn good. I ended up ordering the house-made hot link with greens-and-bacon and corn bread. 

The food was brought out with a &#34;sorry for the wait&#34;, but I didn&#39;t think the wait was too bad. And the food was absolutely amazing! Very flavorful hot link that was exploding with bold deliciousness. It was pretty much exactly what I&#39;m looking for when I order something like this. It was like being punched directly in the mouth with spicy bold goodness. The greens were delicious, not overwhelmingly packed with bacon, It seems like a lot of places hide the flavor of their greens behind bacon. Not here. And the corn bread was perfect, slightly crispy top served with creamy honey butter. 

The only complaint I had about Bitterroot is that the plates had a layer of paper the food was sitting on, which in turn became shredded as I was cutting through the hot link, so I had to work around little bits of paper mixing in with my food. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but it would be nice to not have to do that. 

I&#39;m going with 4 confident stars to Bitterroot. I can definitely see myself going back, but maybe next time I&#39;ll take a seat in the dining room."

Heard of this place and when I walked by during happy hour, the lure of $5 sandwiches was irresistible. Pleasant urban wooden hip decor went well with my affable charming server. This place gets crowded but at 4:30pm it was delightfully sparse. 

At $5 I ordered *both* the beef brisket and the pork sandwiches. I tried all 3 sauces in various combinations with each. (each bite was different). My favorite was the pork with a little bit of both the mustard and Chipotle (hot) sauces combined though the pork was pretty good by itself - a good sign. The brisket needed more sauce help as it was a tad dry. 

Sandwiches were smallish (I easily ate 2).  Though they are the same size during happy hour, they don&#39;t come with sides. 

At the end I asked if they had anything sweet and the waiter sheepishly said &#34;all we have is pecan pie&#34;... Wait, what!? That&#39;s only my #1 favorite pie. He must be used to people wanting the sweet potato pie, but I&#39;d be happy with a restaurant whose only pie, ever, was pecan pie! 

Got it and it was a solid offering. Not too sweet, as some pecan pies can be cloying with too much gelatinous corn syrup and not enough pecans. This was just right. Only thing that would have improved it would have been a thicker crust - as there was essentially none - and for it to be warmed up. One odd thing was the house made whipped cream on the side. I appreciate that it wasn&#39;t sweet, it was even a bit sour, but it seemed like it was started to curdle. I don&#39;t think it tasted off but it was texturally strange - I didn&#39;t eat it. The waiter agreed and without provocation took it off the bill. 

So 3.5 stars for the food. 4 stars for the pie and 5 stars for service. This place deserves your business.

UPDATE: went back for dinner. You&#39;ll pay real formal dinner prices but the food was good. Great grilled corn which came with lime and light spices. The pork shank was a (gruesome) hit. The only disappointment was the burger which, while heartily recommended by a friend, I found to be totally mediocre. Overcooked (I. Hate. That.) and bland. The pork and bacon on top didn&#39;t help much. Also the bread was overpowering. It was also small. 

When it was done the women who had come in and sat next to us confirmed&#34; yeah, *never* get the burgers here&#34;. Lesson learned. 

Lastly the strawberry pie was a cool idea but the drizzled honey on the plate clashed terribly with it. Lots of good ideas at this place... I&#39;d stick to the basic bbq options."

Pork &amp; Bourbon seems to be the theme of this restaurant. When we first walked in we noticed the people sitting in the front half of the restaurant looked kind of bored, so we decided to check out the bar in the back. If you don&#39;t have kids with when you visit, I recommend you try sitting in the back...the bar area has the best atmosphere and is decorated quite nicely.  I ordered their nachos, Hush Puppies and Pulled Pork sandwich. I also tried a glass of their chocolate beer (on rotating draft) which tasted yummy.

Happy Hour is: 3-6pm M-F &amp;11pm-1am everyday
Most of the food on the Happy Hour menu is $5 or less, same goes for the drinks. 

PROS: The staff was quite nice, the atmosphere was cool. Happy Hour prices are great.

CONS: The food was just OK. The food looked pretty, but tasted kind of bland and dry. I&#39;ll go back to the bar for drinks, but I might not order food there again."

The HH specials are a crazy good deal. My girlfriend and I split the BBQ pulled pork sandwich (which I highly recommend). Even splitting it we felt it was a generous portion for $5. The tables are all decked out with a variety of homemade BBQ sauces that are packed with flavor. They take the BBQ to another level. I also ordered the Creamed Old Fashioned simply because it was marked down to $5 from $9 for HH. It was very well made with enjoyable flavors and a generous serving of alcohol. 

Even though we were the pesky patrons who only ordered one drink and one HH plate to split we were still treated with friendly and prompt service and never felt pressured to order more. Overall a cute little place with one of the best Happy Hours in Ballard!"

Our friends had to put their name down for a table and went next door to Percy for a drink. We met our friends a little late so the wait was probably 30ish minutes for a party of four. I would suggest going with a max party of 4, otherwise the wait for a table would be pretty long. 

We got seated and I immediately noticed that they kept water 2 large water containers on the table. I really liked this because this is less work for them to constant refill our water cups. It was really hard to choose what to eat from their menu. There were so many different meat choices! You basically get a choice of meat and 2 sides. Their sides were also difficult to choose from. My boyfriend and I ended up choosing the pork belly and beef brisket with sides of bacon lard greens, brussel sprouts, corn bread, and baked beans. We also got the mac and cheese with onions and sliced sausages for everyone to share. The portion of the mac and cheese was HUGE. We had to take most of this home. The meat portions were also quite large and we also had to take some of this home. The pork belly was outstanding! Our friend recommended this and we were pretty happy. The brisket was also pretty good and I enjoyed the fatty and crisp edges to it. 

Overall, our service was pretty good and attentive. Our food came out at a decent time and the wait wasn&#39;t too long. I would definitely come back to try out the other meats they offer. We were close to get the combo, but I think I&#39;d get a heart attack..."

Whisky Flight: I got the local love. It was great - really unique and high quality. Probably a little pricy for the pours, but yummy!

Is it super authentic bbq?  No.  But I think there are many things on the menu that taste quite good and worth it to come here.

What I like - the smoked chicken - so moist and flavorful.  Mac and cheese.  Grits (not as cheesy as could be but very creamy).  Chicken livers - spicy, good.  Pork shank.  Brisket - not super tender or flavorful but not dry either and taste decent.  I also like their sauces that they have on the table. 

What&#39;s not good - the hushpuppies.  After you have real hushpuppies, unfortunately no hushpuppies even compare in Seattle.  The ones here are particularly bad - burnt, dry, etc.  Cornbread - also dry.  

They also have a good menu of drinks . Another downside is no reservations.  

So overall, there are def things to avoid, but I think the quality is there.  Also as a disclaimer I really prefer unsauced BBQ where you can taste the meat and this place hits that spot for me."

I sampled the Cowboy Killer -- four slices of brisket, half a chicken, half a rack of ribs, a pile of pork, and the three sides. One at a time, now:

Brisket: tender, perfectly seasoned, moderate smoke rings. Did not need sauce, though a bit of the spicy stuff didn&#39;t hurt.

Chicken: perfectly tender, moist and smokey -- even the breast. The skin was soft, but that&#39;s the downside of smoking a chicken instead of roasting it, I guess.

Ribs: dry rub only, so you can sauce them to taste. I skipped the sauce. One or two of the outer ribs were a little on the dry side, but the rest were good gnawin&#39;.

Pork: my least favorite of the meats. Under-seasoned and slightly mushy. This was the one meat that really needed sauce.

For the three sides, we picked the greens, asparagus and cornbread. Both the vegetable dishes were at least as enjoyable as the meats; the asparagus was nicely charred, and the greens were, well, green. And hammy. The cornbread was thankfully the more savory style, and not the bread candy a lot of people call cornbread. It was moist enough not to need much of the honey butter it came with.

All told, the Killer was slightly more food than two human-sized people could finish; just about perfect for three, I&#39;d think, but then you&#39;d have to fight over the last slice of brisket. At $48, it&#39;s basically a buy-three-get-one-free-deal, but with fewer sides. If I ever return, I think I&#39;ll just stick to the brisket plate. (Well, I&#39;d get the brisket sandwich, except for some reason they don&#39;t offer that.)

Besides smoked meats, this place is all about whiskey. They have a whiskey list several times longer than the rest of the menu. They also had some special beers around for beer week."

The sandwich was very tasty and flavorful, with a good amount of meat.  The Fried Plantains were delicious, and very fulfilling.  It had this yummy cilantro, lime, and garlic sauce on it.  I ate only half my sandwich so that I could finish the plantains.  And I really enjoyed the Lavender Cucumber Limeade.

I was pretty stuffed, and couldn&#39;t stop thinking about getting off of work to go home and finish the rest of my sandwich.  I would definitely order these items again, maybe try The Orient plate next time.

Today, it was Papa Boi&#39;s first visit and I immediately came onto Yelp to look at the reviews, and whether or not I wanted to try their food. With the high proportion of 4 stars + reviews, I had to give it a try.

They arrived at 11am and plans to stay until 2pm. I couldn&#39;t get away from my desk until just after noon, but I went as fast as my feet would carry me to the food truck. I had dreams (or was it my tastebuds had dreams?!) of trying that pistachio rice the minute I read about it. Sadly, it remains a dream as they served the last portion 2 diners ahead of me. Boo. Hope they come back. Anyways, I opted for The Orient plate, with a cucumber lavender limeade. 

The flavor of the plate was seriously TO DIE FOR. It was like 4th of July food fireworks going off in my mouth. To be honest, it really didn&#39;t give me a taste of the orient, but definitely hit the Caribbean flavors through and through. I&#39;ve been to the Caribbean a few times, and while I&#39;m no Caribbean food connoisseur, I think Papa Bois did a fine job. As mentioned previously, the pistachio rice was sold out so I got a double helping of coleslaw. It was actually the perfect compliment to the pork because the pork was very rich and the tangy acidity of the slaw was perfect. Downside to the pork: while it was very tender and meaty (unlike my coworkers grisly and fatty Cuban sandwich), it was swimming in oil. Not sure if this is from the coconut milk, the pork, or a combination of the both of them, but it wasn&#39;t very pretty and upset my tummy. But, they say fat is flavor, amiright?

The cucumber lavender limeade was the perfect delicate refreshment to go with the meal. At $2, you get a fairly big (20 oz?!) recyclable cup full of the tasty beverage. There was JUST the right amount of ice in my drink - enough to keep it cold, but not so much that the drink felt like a rip off. 

I would definitely recommend trying Papa Bois out - but be warned, the pork may not be a crowd pleaser because of the fat (and the Cuban was apparently fatty and grisly). Next time I will try the Sammy so I can get the &#34;perfect bite&#34; all at once."

The pork belly is delicious (both platter and sandwich) but the jerk chicken is the star at this show!  I find it difficult to deviate from it whenever I patronize them.

Being originally from Florida where Caribbean food is somewhat ubiquitous, I am delighted to have found these guys here!

Kudos and keep up the excellent gastronomic work!"

I ordered the Orient Plate which consists of pistachio rice, Caribbean slaw and slow cooked pork marinated with lemon grass and coconut milk. The pistachio rice was really good and had a lot of crushed pistachios on top. The slaw was fresh and had a good amount of acid to cut through the richness of the pork. The pork was cooked really well but was slightly too salty. The pork also had really good bold flavors. 

This is one of Seattle&#39;s better food trucks in terms of quality of food and portions are pretty big too."

This is my second visit to PB&#39;s in a week.  Went with my girls last Monday when they were in Tukwila at BECU.  They&#39;re here every Monday for the summer.

Last week I sampled the Cuban Plate, which includes fried diced pork belly spiced with homemade Cuban dry rub, Caribbean Slaw topped with Papa Mayo, Oh Boi Sauce, caramelized onions, and tamarind sauce; and a side of pistachio rice.  I was pleased, it was quite tasty but probably would have only given 4 stars if this was the only dish I&#39;d tried.

However, I went back today went and decided this was a 5 star truck. I sampled my friend&#39;s delicious shrimp sandwich (special that day), it was so good!  I ordered a special item that the chef named &#34;the Slaw Boat.&#34;  I mentioned that I was eating low carb and had asked for just chicken and plantains.  The chef recommended something he usually makes for himself: The Slaw Boat, which is jerk chicken over slaw.  It was DELISH!  They should have it as a regular menu option for all the low carb and paleo folks out there.  IDK if the ck marinade or slaw have sugar in them but if they don&#39;t they&#39;re perfect for paleo eaters.

My favorite thing about this truck apart from the food is the ambiance and service.  How can a truck have good ambiance you might ask?  Well, on a hot sunny day with their island music playing and the friendly service... a trip to this truck feels like a mini-vacation.  

The good folks who work in this truck are so friendly, kind and funny.  My cashier, Ashante, was so kind and has a knack for acknowledging multiple customers at the same time.  If you&#39;re standing a the window and he needs to speak to someone else in line, he acknowledges the shift in attention instead of shouting over to the next person.  It would be okay for a food truck if he shouted, but it&#39;s nice that he doesn&#39;t.

And my chef, my wonderful chef, was so kind to suggest a dish that wasn&#39;t on the menu but fit my diet preferences.  He was happy to help and not put out to make something different.  

I came late in the day and there was no line so both staff members even talked and joked with me before I headed back to work.

Thanks Papa Bois!!! See you next week for my Slaw Boat!"

They have a strong social media presence and have a route that&#39;s accessible to many customers around the city. I also find the truck easy to identify with the signature orange and black colors. 

The first time I went to the truck they were running low on some dishes so I tried the pistachio rice after hearing rave reviews and the jerk mac and cheese. The pistachio rice was okay. I was really surprised after hearing so many great things. I found it to be rather bland. The jerk mac and cheese pretty much tasted like plain mac and cheese. It was okay. 

I&#39;m really glad I made my way back to the truck. This time, they had pretty much everything on their menu. I tried the jerk chicken wings and lavender cucumber limeade. That limeade is pretty darn near life changing and one of the best beverages I&#39;ve had on a truck. Perfect on a warm summer day! The jerk chicken wings were moist and had fantastic texture. The spices were flavorful and had just enough kick. Overall, I was much happier with this visit."

That along with the Lavender Cucumber Limeade made for a refreshing and satisfying lunch.

On the day I went, they were in McGraw Park on 5th and Stewart - right by where the Street Car ends. It was a beautiful and sunny day, but the lines weren&#39;t long when I got there.

The bean corn salad, jerk mac and cheese, papaya salad, and cornbread were also things I would order again in a heartbeat. The corn bread was literally the best I have ever had, and I have spent plenty of time in the south!

I got the jerk plate and it was grilled well, the rice wasn&#39;t bad, the slaw was alright. They describe it as &#34;dry rubbed with jerk seasoning&#34;.  But then the put too much other stuff on it all.  There were caramelized onions on top of everything, which tasted good.  But no longer made the chicken &#34;Dry&#34; by any means.  They kind of turn everything into a gravy. Especially due to the &#34;Papa Mayo&#34; they put on top of everything.  I would ask for &#34;no mayo&#34; for sure if I ever went back.  The mayo seems like Greek yogurt plus horseradish.  Not bad, but as they put it on top of EVERYTHING, it makes your whole plate taste the same.

service: typical food truck service. got our food fairly fast. ***5/5

ambiance: nothing too fancy on their truck. ***4/5

price: $9 for that...ill pass. its a glorified banh mi really. ***3/5"

I had the jerk sandwich - good flavors, nice and spicy, bread couldn&#39;t quite hold up to the filling. Husband had the Cuban (not a traditional Cuban) and he liked it too. Sister had the pork plate and plantain chips. She got the last serving of pork, which was sad for me, except the jerk chicken was so good I ended up not minding. Super friendly service.

I&#39;m not sure why it took me this long to try their food when they come out near my work every Tuesday... Matter fact, I&#39;m debating if I should go there again for the third week in a row, lol.

Definetely check them out if you ever see their truck! Their sandwiches are soooo good! The sides and the desert are super yummy as well! You really can&#39;t go wrong with Papa Bois! Oh yeah, the guys who work the truck are pretty great too. :)"

Took my coworkers here and they fell in love with the Cuban. The pork is flavorful, the sauce combinations work well and the bread is well balanced between a soft inside and delicate crust.

I also have had their soft shell crab sandwich which reminded me of takoyaki (one of my favorites). The crab is fried karage style and works really well with the sauces.

Their (seasonal) bread pudding is very well executed and just what I look for in a dessert: not overly sweet, playful textures, with just enough richness to make it worthwhile. 

Definitely worth hunting down if they are in your neighborhood. 

Prices are around $10 for a sandwich and they have some good combo pricing for sides and specialty drinks. One of my buddies was complaining about the prices before ordering but by the time he was done eating was already trying to make plans for next week when they were back near our office."

I recently had some pork belly rice at Mee Sum in the U Dist so my taste buds were particularly salivating for that flavor again... only to be found in the form of a nom-nom worthy sandwich! I usually have pretty bad memory so if I can remember the sandwich hitting the spot that day, then that&#39;s pretty darn good.

Also had the mango salsa &amp; lavender cucumber thai basil limeade.. I usually can&#39;t handle spicy food so I was really wary on the salsa but it turns out... I can handle it! The limeade may sound intimidating (and it pretty much is) but it surprisingly is a nice blend of all those flavors. I thought the lavender &amp; basil would make it taste gross herby... but they are only hints of flavors so it adds a nice little kick.

OVERALL - I&#39;m usually wary of fusion places because I have seen too many restaurants murder what pho really should taste like or adopt orange chicken as a traditional Chinese dish.... but Papa Bois does a damn good job of merging flavors you never thought you would see together. If you have adventurous taste buds, this is definitely a place to check out. 

p.s. friendly staff make it a good experience overall!"

I&#39;m not sure how food truck followers actually &#34;follow&#34; food truck schedules, but this is probably not one that you want to follow if it&#39;s your first time trying to track a food truck down.  This was my first time trying to follow a food truck and now I feel a little empty inside...seriously, I&#39;m hungry.

The website says they were going to show up at 7th &amp; Lander today (6/18/13) in SoDo and when I showed there at noon (I really was excited!), there was no truck.  I went back to my desk and finally found the tiny Twitter and FB link on their website, and went to it and found out they were serving in Queen Anne instead!  That&#39;s so far for a sudden change in plans!

Pretty disappointed, but hoping to review this place again.  Hopefully, they can organize their website/FB/Twitter to have accurate or up-to-date data so that people can try or enjoy their food.  Or if they just want to update FB and Twitter, maybe they should just take their website down.  Just saying..."

Had the Cuban sandwich, which sounds delicious with pork belly, slaw, and tamarind sauce. I don&#39;t know if I was here on an off-day or got the scrapings from the bottom of the pot, but the pork belly was prepared in a way that made most of it so tough it was impossible to chew and eat.  Some pieces were hard as bones and some were like trying to chew through leather.  A thoroughly unpleasant experience where I couldn&#39;t get through half the sandwich.  I&#39;ve had pork belly many times in the past and never anything like this before.  It was like eating a sandwich full of gristle. Not right.

The rest of the flavors were quite good, so other sandwiches might be worth getting. Just stay away from the inedible pork belly."

It was spicy though so if you don&#39;t like spicy food then getting a sandwich isn&#39;t going to be a good life decision. I also got the papaya salad- but after eating the delicious sandwich I think there was just too much spiciness going on for my mouth to handle (which is probably why they sell &#34;palate cleansing&#34; drinks- go figure.)

I definitely will not be letting this happen again next week! However, I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with anything on their menu.

I ended up going with the Jerk Chicken sandwich which has the most robust flavor profile. The chicken is lean and perfectly charred and the hot sauce is just the right amount of smokey and spicy without overwhelming the other flavors of the sandwich. 

I would highly recommend taking a lunch break and heading over. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable!

Came here by myself since I traveled to Washington  alone. Looking for a nice place for good wine and seafood. Wine was overpriced $12 for a glass of a $20 bottle and the food was mediocre.

Was shocked how bad they were since I think of Washington as a seafood destination. Clams in tomato sauce taste like nothing. Suppose to have Chinese sausage but only found one tiny little piece.  I thought Columbia city ale house was way better. Cheap tasty food. 

I would skip it. Decor is cool but for the price is not worth it. Washington  as a whole, food is cheap and alcohol. This place was too yuppy without the taste."

The space itself is lovely, with a nice bar and ambiance. Easy parking close by, and not too busy the Sunday evening we decided to check it out. Unfortunately, those are just about the only positives from our visit.

The food was pricey and portions were fairly small. For $17 we got two measly crab cakes, about 2.5 - 3 inches in diameter. They were okay, but definitely a much smaller portion than expected at that price point. Next up was the smoked trout salad. Huge fan of smoked trout here and it was just decent. But the salad itself had a very strange combination of flavors that distracted from the fish. The tangy dressing contrasted with the pistachio goat cheese balls with some sort of citrus in the mix too - it was all too much. Finally came our main dish, the black cod, a special for that evening. Also one of my favorite sea critters. The fish was well cooked, but it was pretty bland and flavorless. I&#39;ve cooked much better at home, and I&#39;m no gourmet chef. 

The other thing that detracted from our experience was the service. Our waitress said no more than 15 words to us the entire evening. She didn&#39;t give off a very welcoming vibe, she never shared any information about specials or asked how the meal was (which is good I guess, because then I would&#39;ve been in the awkward position of saying that I didn&#39;t much care for the food). Maybe it was just a bad day for her, so I didn&#39;t take stars off of the review for the lack of service, but it was definitely a big contrast with other spendy restaurants in the area.

We both agreed that our favorite part of the meal was the bread and butter (literally). And the stop at Full Tilt afterwards. It looks like they have a solid happy hour menu that people rave about, so perhaps I&#39;d give it another try for that, but won&#39;t be back for the dinner. We both left hungry, sad, and with $80 less in our pockets."

When we walked in to eat the hostest was very short with us and could not figure out whether to give us the happy hour menu or the dinner menu instead of just giving us both. The service was extremely slow and it took over an hour of us being there to get our entrees (it was not busy). Then when we did get our entree we got an extra plate. We asked the server about it after we had tried to figure out what it was. He said sorry that wasn&#39;t yours then we watched him replate it and serve it to another table....

It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve had raw oysters, so I&#39;m no expert.  However, I did find these HH oysters to be good.  The sauce on top was a tad overpoweringly vinegary which is OK if you are Asian.  I prefer my oyster with just a little lemon or with cocktail sauce.

I am not a big fan of the fries.  I usually prefer thinner cut fries.  The fish sauce chicken wings were different, and a hit with my kids.

Decor hip and modern.  Definitely a good place to hang and relax if you like seafood."

BF and I came for happy hour on Saturday night. We were a bit early but they sat us anyway. We decided to order drinks and pan fried oysters off the regular menu. We basically went to town on the HH menu. What we ordered: raw oysters, shrimp toast, frites, crispy calamari, coconut pork belly banh mi, and octopus croquettes.

Literally everything was good. My least favorite were the oysters, so that says a lot about the rest of the food.  The mignonette on the oysters was light but the subtle sweetness was just enough. I especially enjoyed the octopus croquettes. They were like takoyaki except the exterior was crisp and crunchy.  The accompanying lime mayo was delicious! The calamari was really tender but I agree with the other Yelpers that the batter could have been crispier. The pork belly in the banh mi was so good and the bread was perfectly toasted. It was so light and crispy. 

Dessert was on point -- sticky banana cake with toffee drizzle and creme fraiche. It was PERFECT. I now believe that all sticky toffee pudding should have banana in it. God it was good.

We had hella food and 3 drinks (two of which were non HH), and the bill only came out to be $88. Service was so nice too, cheery and genuine. We&#39;ll be back!"

Unfortunatley, the food was not exceptional. I did not enjoy anything that we ordered. I was expecting a more extensive raw selection, considering the name of the restaurant. However, the menu was not reflective of the branding. I repeat nothing was good. I would recommend this place for cocktails on the weekend. For a group of people to get out, and enjoy a nice ambience and cocktails perhaps. I cannot recommend this, the cocktails were not great either. 

The oysters we&#39;re not plated well. There were no desirable pairings for the oysters, very odd. For example, Ettas near pike place market serves their oysters with a savory champagne mignotte. This place had no such thing. I had to ask for lemon, salt and pepper. I was not impressed by this. I also had the crab cake s and they were cold and flavorless. (More cake than crab for sure.)

On more than one occasion I drove by this place and anticipated coming in to try the food. I was disappointed for sure."

That does not equate to having more food, it equates to YOU getting quality ingredients on your plate, supporting local farmers. And supporting small businesses! 

Anyways...I had no issues here with my first visit last night, in fact I&#39;m officially in love with this place! We ordered the Columbia city bakery bread, frites, calamari, smoked trout salad, grilled romaine salad, half a dozen of raw oysters with the minter sweet cilantro, kushii, and a Kumamoto I think that&#39;s what it was called. Beef shoulder steak, seared scallops. 

Everything was delicious, prepared with such care and I was super happy with our experience! 

The bread was good, it has a slight sweet taste to it. It was served with softened unsalted butter and a small mound of sea salt. 
Frites were delicious, the smoked oyster mayo it was served with was so good. It reminded me of a smoky bacon!
Calamari was good too, perfectly fried and lightly seasoned, served with a savory sweet brown sauce.
Smoked trout salad was my favorite. It had goat cheese rolled in crushed pistachios, sliced beets and crisp green lettuces. The smoked trout was absolutely perfect too! I loved the subtle smoky flavor and the dressing was refreshing.
Grilled heart of romaine was yummy, I love the creamy lemon dressing and the cotija cheese. I don&#39;t think I personally like warm salads, but it was a good one to try!
We had half a dozen raw oysters- 2 Kumamoto(I&#39;m not sure of the name) 2 minter sweet with cilantro, 2 kushii. We asked for lemons and Tabasco and added a couple drops of each to the oysters to cover some of the shellfish flavor, it was amazing!
Beef shoulder steak was super tender and delicious. It has a yummy green chimichurii sauce and delicious fried Serrano chilies, fingerling potatoes. 
Seared scallops were so good, it was served with crab lumpia and a citrus-y fish sauce dressing and peanut sauce. 

The restrooms use rain water to conserve clean water so it&#39;s brown. Um....cool!!!!! Anyways, I love this place! Can&#39;t wait to bring my husband for happy hour!

Also we made reservations ahead of time. Service was great! Super professional!"

The dishes we ordered tonight were incredibly delicious and perfectly prepared.  Service was friendly and responsive.   Salted Sea has an extremely comfortable &#34;Northwest&#34; ambience, highlighted by the plank/driftwood sculpture hanging by the front door.  We loved the big windows looking out onto Rainier.  The background music was a pleasant, non-obtrusive style played at a satisfactory volume.

We made reservations thru Open Table, but on this particular night there were plenty of open tables, and a reservation was unnecessary.   Salted Sea has a full bar (and there&#39;s a Happy Hour).   I noticed that the two TV monitors over the bar were off (which is perfectly fine in my book).

Salted Sea&#39;s website indicates that there&#39;s a Vietnamese influence on their cuisine.  Well, that&#39;s obviously a very good influence, as we enjoyed each dish immensely.  We started out with the Pan-Fried Oysters.   The oysters were perfect golden brown in appearance.  Resting atop a mild horseradish crème fraîche, the fresh and plump oysters were topped with slivers of a nice pickled garlic gremolata.  Gremolata is a condiment comprised of parsley, garlic and a touch of lemon zest.

Also as a starter, we ordered the ceviche.  This was different than any other ceviche I had ever seen.  The ceviche was a clump of white fish in the center of the bowl, topped with a leafy green that I could not identify, and encircled by slices of crostini bread.  The a-little-bit tangy tumeric/lime flavor of the ceviche&#39;s light sauce was outstanding.  The fish in the ceviche was very fresh.

For my entree, I ordered the trout.  It was excellent.  Like the fried oysters, the trout came out with a perfect golden crust.  The trout, fresh like all our other dishes, was huge.  This was the first time I&#39;ve seen trout with pink meat.  Accompanying the trout were delicious confit chanterelle mushrooms, thin crescent-shaped apple slices and a lacinato kale.  

My favorite dish of the night was the oyster stew.  While called a stew, it was really more like a soup.  In any case, the stew containing tiny cubes of potatoes was so, so amazingly tasty.  I couldn&#39;t get enough of it!  Hopefully, this dish will make frequent appearances on Salted Sea&#39;s specials menu, or even find its way to the regular menu.

For such truly &#34;Top Chef&#34; cuisine, I found Salted Sea&#39;s prices surprisingly reasonable.   I highly recommend Salted Sea, and you can be sure we&#39;ll be back!"

I&#39;m bumping it up to 4 stars because they&#39;re still new. Though it wasn&#39;t perfect, the customer service was friendly and I enjoyed their happy hour (daily from 3 pm - 5 pm). It&#39;s also hard to beat $1 oysters on a half shell.

Across from Tutta Bella in Columbia City, Salted Sea has a modern atmosphere. This is probably the type of place you would see in Ballard or Fremont, but located in South Seattle.

**HH eats I would order again**

--Dark &amp; Stormy ($7): Rum, ginger beer, and lime cocktail.  Tart and slightly bitter, but refreshing.  

--Green Curry Mussels (~$7): The mussels were plump, and the coconut curry sauce was light but delicious.  Bread is a must to soak up all it&#39;s goodness.

--Oysters on a half shell ($1 / each): Small, briney, clean flavored oysters that seemed to be dress with lemon already.  The only thing missing was horse radish.

--Garlic (BBQ) Chicken Wings ($7-$8): This was a pretty good version of the salty/sweet Vietnamese style BBQ wings. It came out hot and crispy, with the sauce being finger-licking good!

**&#34;Just Ok&#34; Eats (that I might not order again)**
-Frites (Fries) with oyster infused mayo
-Coconut Pork Belly Sliders
-Shrimp Toast

Overall, the servers were friendly, which is a plus.  Salted Sea doesn&#39;t offer regular menu items during HH, so you have to wait to try out their regular menu.  The HH portion sizes are also fairly small, so don&#39;t expect to get full quickly. However, some of their flavors were on point, and I would probably come back for HH."

I wanted to say this was a great raw bar addition to Columbia City and have been meaning to try this place forever but it came out disappointing not because of the food so much but because the service here is horrible.  

We ordered the grilled romaine - grilled perfectly with a char and still crispy at the same time.  The romaine was dressed well and tasted delicious! The Kumamoto and Shigoku oysters were good! One had a jelly on top and tasted more like salt water than the other.  I think it needed a better sauce to go on top.  The oysters were fairly small though - but that&#39;s normal for this type of oysters.  The frites with the oyster aioli was crisp and delicious! The clams had a good broth to it but again small - which is again probably normal for the season.  I thought the food was good, nothing spectacular but good and I had no complaints.  

However, the service.. Our server overcharged us so look at your bill carefully. She charged us for 2 soups, instead of 1 and 3 orders of frites instead of 2.  We pointed it out and she decided to give us free oysters for the difference (per our request) since we already settled and signed the bill.  We then found out it was happy hour and decided to stay for more food.  The server put the HH menu on our table and ignored us.  We finally put our order in and waited an hour for our order to come out.. For which she &#34;forgot&#34; to put in our oyster order and didn&#39;t provide us with any silverware.  

The happy hour minter sweet select oysters were actually pretty good! Nice flavors and a good vinaigrette to top it off. Worth it at $1/piece.  U fortunately it took over 1.5 hrs to come out but the new guys gave them to us for half off.  So when did our server leave and they changed staff?! She didn&#39;t even inform us that this was happening.  I know they tried to compensate for the things that went wrong but who makes that many mistakes on one table in a night?! Especially since there was no one there on a Saturday evening!! There was maybe 1-2 other parties besides us so they definitely weren&#39;t busy!

We ordered the chicken wings, which were a good crisp and flavor.  The crispy calamari had a good sauce but definitely wasn&#39;t crispy enough.  The green curry mussels were plump and the green curry broth was delicious.  For dessert we had the Vietnamese coffee flan which was thicker in consistency but a good flavor. I liked it.  The sticky banana cake was interesting but not my favorite.  The tart butter toffee sauce didn&#39;t go with the banana cake.  

I also ordered a mule and it wasn&#39;t as gingery as I&#39;d like.  I think it was also lacking alcohol and content.  Definitely not the best mule I&#39;ve had - not even close.

I would have given this place a 3.5 for food and probably a 1.5 for service.  I think it would&#39;ve been better if they worked out the kinks in service because waiting so long for orders is pretty unacceptable."

I was hoping it was just because Salted is somewhat new still, but... that might not be the case. I got the brioche french toast. While it tasted delicious - loved the fall flavor with the vanilla poached pears and smoked butter, it was super soggy! Too much syrup or pear juice? Which kind of ruined the experience. My husband got the Columbia City Fry. It came with three yummy, fried oysters but the omelet itself wasn&#39;t anything special.. just had some bacon and onions, and the portion was on the small side. Overall, food was okay, but we just didn&#39;t leave with happy, satisfied bellies.

They were definitely more obsessed than I was since they specialize in oysters (I&#39;m not as big on oysters as they are for sure!), but just having them around with the great waitress we had, it made the whole experience that much better.

I can&#39;t say how busy it gets during the day since we always came here after 10 pm. I can say during happy hour though, it wasn&#39;t crowded at all. But I kind of liked it because it was basically just our group, which was fun because they&#39;re all super fun. Shout out to Susha (our waitress) too, who was super fun and laid-back. The second night we came, we were all wondering if she was working, and then she popped out from the back and so excited to see us!

Okay, now the food! My friends could seriously eat like 50 of these oysters each. I&#39;m not too big on oysters though, but these oysters were pretty good quality because I could eat like, 4-ish before it got too briny for me. Some of them were too watery for me to look like I would enjoy them, but others looked pretty yummy. 

I LOVED their mussels though. So good! We had mussels at another place that I gave 5 stars, but I do like these mussels better than those. They had the best sauce to go with it too. PRO TIP: dunk the fries into the sauce! The fries are also a must-get too. 

What I was disappointed in though was the ceviche. The fish was chewy, and it was a super super small portion for the price. Homemade is better than this one unfortunately.

That all being said, it was a great experience, and I know our group will remember Salted Sea every time we think back on our trip to Seattle."

I&#39;d go back to order the oysters, of course, the crispy, delicious calamari, and the happy hour fries that came with a fantastic smoked oyster aioli. (It tasted like bacon.)

My friend and I came here the day before my birthday to grab some food and to catch up before my hectic weekend. The staff here was really nice and friendly but the food was just not up to par. 
We ordered a half dozen oysters, half Kumamoto and half minter sweet select, grilled romaine, Rockefeller oysters, grilled octopus, and spicy green curry mussels. The raw oysters didn&#39;t come with any accompanying sauce and that was quite a disappointment. My friend had to ask for extra sauce and such. The Rockefeller oyster was a huge let down, they came out cold. Didn&#39;t even look baked at all and when my friend went to eat one she immediately spit it out because the oyster was so slimy and had a weird fishy taste to it. We got it sent back because I sure wasn&#39;t going to try it after that. The grilled octopus and spicy curry mussels would have been amazing if they weren&#39;t so bland. They both were so bland even the spicy curry mussels, there was no flavor or spices what so ever. Our meal was quite a let down but I still gave this place a three star for the staff and their service. It was a good place to try but I definitely don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be coming back.

I had heard the Buzz about this new joint and was ready to chow down on some amazing Seafood and pick an impressive place. After being seated for 15 minutes the party next to us Got up Chuckled (bitterly) a bit and said &#34;ENJOY WAITING A WEEK FOR YOUR FOOD, WE ARE OUTTA HERE&#34;, and they left without eating. 

We were hungry and right as we seated we ordered everything and told em to bring it as it comes out. Well we should of taken the advice that was told to us. In total we waited about 2 hours for this food, it was ridiculous. However, After half an hour at least the Oysters had come. To top it off when it finally came our waitress had messed up our order. She came to check on us once in that two hours and appeared to be in a bad mood as well as she was a a bit rude.

So what did we eat when the food finally did come? Some Raw oysters (only two kinds were available not the kinds we wanted unfortunately) They were decent I wonder what the others would have been like. The fish and chips which was recommended to us by the Waitress was not really all that good, don&#39;t recommend. The smoked trout salad was alright, but very small. Portions for the most part are small here. The whole roasted Trout I ordered just because I figured it would be the biggest thing on the menu and we were hungry (ESPECIALLY AFTER all that waiting). It was honestly ok, but definitely not worth the wait at all.

Ambience: Pretty filled, and definitely loud. If you are looking for a quiet spot look elsewhere. 


Overall, I would say the only way I would even consider recommending this place is if you go during happy hour or when it is not with people, or maybe when they hire more staff? you are better off going next door to Spice Room which is great if you are in the area. And it&#39;s not cheap, so no brownie points there either. We were pretty disappointed. I rarely ever give just One Star but the service here was outright a joke and terrible. 

Moreover,  I know of no Sea that isn&#39;t Salted, but maybe this place needs some changes in their staff and needs to up the Salt a bit."

The rock fish congee is awesome. We had pear and butter lettuce salad too and it was very delicious. I would recommend coming here for brunch. The salt and vinegar potatoes over the hash browns though.

They do good potatoes here and have a kids menu. 

I want to try the late night happy hour next as my old favorite late night happy hour place has been on the decline.

Maybe the sign outside should have bigger fonts to call out brunch as it&#39;s farther down the street from the other brunch places."

The salted popcorn ice cream is fantastic for dessert.

The most forgettable dish here was definitely the shrimp toast. The toast wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t great either. The shrimp was kind of a shrimp paste ? There was shrimp flavor but no actual visible shrimps on the toast. The house made frites were solid but slightly soggy; I like my fries crispy. The oysters were huge and fresh. I liked the mussels it was slightly spicy and had good flavors to it. The best item off the happy hour menu is probably the calamari. It wasn&#39;t too chewy and it was breaded lightly so it wasn&#39;t overly greasy when it came out. There was a nice butter flavor and slightly spicy from the chili oil."

Walked in and sat at the bar. Ordered Capone&#39;s Hat, shrimp toast, calamari and raw oysters. The capone&#39;s Hat drink was really yummy. The mixture of spirits was well balanced.
The shrimp toast, at first I was wondering where is my shrimp?, but once I got bit into a piece of cheesy, shrimpy, crunchy goodness I was satisfied.  The calamari was not overly fried and you can taste how fresh it is. The raw oysters were amazing. I would definitely recommend this place and will be back again"

The open space and style felt nice and inviting. Servers gave helpful feedback, and the food came out in a timely manner.  

I was a bit concerned after reading a bunch of mixed reviews, but the oysters we had were really fresh and quite good.   Admittedly, I haven&#39;t been much of an oyster fan until more recently , but these make me  excited to try more. 

Green curry with mussels was really good. 5 stars. Really enjoyed the broth and the ample supply of mussels. I ordered a side of bread in order to sop up some of the broth as well. Yum!

 Pan seared scallops with crab lumpia and noodles with peanut sauce.  4 stars.  The noodles were a bit too al dente, and it could have used a little bit more peanut sauce, but I really enjoyed the combination of flavors, the huge scallops were seared perfectly, and the crab lumpia was flaky and crispy with a lot of real crab meat.

Smoked scallops 3 stars. The texture and taste felt a little too gelatinous for me and the accompanying fruit and cucumber didn&#39;t add much more to it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d order this again.

Crab cakes were very hearty - full of lots of real crab meat, and not a lot of filler. 4 stars.  Two came in a serving, filled with real crab, fried nicely, and came with a nice side slaw.

Overall, I think Salted Sea is a great addition to the Columbia City food scene. I&#39;d definitely come here again, especially to try the happy hour. While dinner was good, it was on the more expensive side.. but well worth a try."

They went wayyyyy upscale with this location, which fits in perfectly in the neighborhood.  My girlfriends and I tried a few dishes to share.  Before they got there, I had a few minutes of happy hour prices so picked up two oysters ** only $1 each at happy hour, so I couldn&#39;t pass it up.  They were of course delish!  

Before I move on, I really have to stress how impressed I was with one particular item - the shrimp toast appetizer.  This is a quintessential and authentic Vietnamese appetizer that I&#39;ve only ever seen family make....never seen it in restaurants. I had to try it, seeing it on the menu.  I was so impressed with how flavorful and NOT greasy it was (when it&#39;s family-made, it soaks up a bunch of oil, because you spread raw minced shrimp on the bread and fry it in oil).  This will definitely be my go-to app here.

What else...we ordered the spicy green mussels.  I&#39;m not a fan of mussels and have only found one place (in Vegas) where I&#39;ve liked them.  The broth was amazing, the mussels, eh (again, because I don&#39;t like mussels).  The crispy calamari was a solid performer.  Nothing bad but nothing unusual about theirs here.  We also had the garlic yu choy (leafy greens) which actually was my favorite after the shrimp toast. It was so simple yet flavorful.  Finally, we tried the king oyster dish.  I guess I&#39;ve never had king oysters.  I was amazed at how large they were, and we got two slices that were like steak slices.  A very good dish.

All in all, I&#39;d come back here again, if not for dinner definitely for happy hour."

We loved this restaurant.  I only give it a 4 instead of a 5 because we had one dish that wasn&#39;t up to par...ONLY ONE!  Everything else, food, decor, plating, service, all stellar.  Definitely a must try restaurant.

We had the HH raw oysters and loved the mignonette with cilantro and lime that came on top of it.  The oysters were already cut away in the shell so sucking them down included the oyster, brine, and the mignonette.  Very tasty.  At a dollar each, what a bargain.

The only dish we didn&#39;t care for was the Octopus Croquettes.  They were kind of mealy tasting and were cold/frozen in the middle.  Everything else was excellent.

We recommend the calamari (nice sweet/spicy sauce on the bottom of the plate), sticky chicken wings, and the Spicy Green Curry Mussels.  We asked for bread which came hot and with butter and then proceeded to soak up that wonderful green curry sauce.

Excellent place.  A must do in seattle!"

One of my favorite things about Seattle is fresh oysters pretty much whenever you want. Even better, we can walk to Salted Sea from our apartment, so we can eat oysters whenever! Buuuut it has taken us a while to get here, because the only thing that really intrigued me about this place was the $1 oysters and their HH is from 3-5PM, which doesn&#39;t usually fit my schedule. I&#39;m stoked we finally went and we will for sure return. Everything we had was delicious - 8 of the $1 HH oysters and a couple other full price $3 oysters and some surprisingly amazing calamari. The oysters come predressed with their own mignonettes and each one was delicious. There were a few pieces of shell that wound up in each of our mouths, but we&#39;ll live. We also had beverages - the Kir Royal and the Dark and Stormy.

I&#39;m on the fence on Salted Sea. We came here for a family birthday and had a variety of dishes:

-Sea Scallop Crudo- fresh and simple
-Rice crusted King Salmon- the rice crust was rather bland 
-Dungeness crab and potatoes in an herb and orange sauce- tasty but super rich
-White beans and mushrooms- ironically, the vegetarian dish was probably the best dish of the night
-Banana cake- far too rich
-Chocolate marquise- again, far too rich

Service was excellent. The staff really goes above and beyond and even brought us a flower to celebrate the birthday.

I&#39;d be willing to give Salted Sea another shot but I hope they fix the richness/spicing issues because it really does have a lot of potential."

I really liked the decor inside. They had three TVs at the bar, but there was no sound, which was fine. The Old Fashioned I had was perfectly crafted. I had half a dozen oysters which were all fantastic. I am used to having my oysters with hot sauce, lemon and a bit of horseradish, but each oyster had its own accompanying sauce. 

There was a grilled octopus on special which sounded delicious but the plate itself was disappointingly small. The octopus was delicious, but priced at $17 I expected more than a single tentacle with a garnish. 

The food was excellent but my bill came out to $45 and I couldn&#39;t help but feel like I wanted something more to eat."

I don&#39;t eat seafood (the boyfriend loves it) so I was left with either ordering the cheaper summer squash dish or the super expensive lamb dish. I chose the squash and was incredibly disappointed. 

The dish contained lentils, ONE baby sized patty pan squash, and a third grain-type food. It would have totally fine except that is was SWIMMING in lime juice. SWIMMING. It was SO limey that I couldn&#39;t even take more than a few bites. My stomach was doing flips at how sour this dish was. It was the worst. ever.

The pan fried oysters were flavorful and great (yeah, i tried them!), and my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his crab. 

The dessert was very, very rich. We had the sticky banana cake and wished we could have ordered at glass of milk with it. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it WAS tasty. But you shouldn&#39;t feel like brushing your teeth immediately so they don&#39;t fall out after eating anything.

I had made a reservation a couple of days before and we were seated without any problems.

JUST DON&#39;T EAT THE SQUASH DISH. It was just so terribly made.

I will give this place another shot... sometime, but probably not until they&#39;ve worked the kinks out of their menu."

It was really loud in there due to some of the louder customers in the bar and DJ playing music that didn&#39;t feel very dinner appropriate.   I think we ended up coming on an evening where there was some event going on in Columbia City. So we were all shouting and repeating ourselves when we were trying to talk to each other.  I think several of us got the same dishes because other dishes didn&#39;t seem that appetizing.  Here&#39;s what we ordered:

Oysters (Minter Sweet Select, Kumamoto, Shigoku) - I enjoyed all of them, we got a full dozen
Crispy Calamari - Average, it&#39;s calamari.
Green Bean &amp; Cherry Tomato Salad - This one was actually pretty good
Crab Cakes - this one didn&#39;t really look like crab cakes but my sister said they were ok
Grilled Heart of Romaine 
Ling Cod &amp; Chips - Chips are actually small potatoes cut in half.  Not really worth $17.
Grilled Baby Summer Squash - My mom ordered this and was not impressed at all.  She barely got any squash with this dish and that&#39;s what she was looking forward to.
Lamb Burger

Overall I wasn&#39;t too impressed with this place.  Maybe they&#39;re still working out the kinks but I probably won&#39;t be back.  Everything seems a bit overpriced for the what they are serving.  Maybe happy hour is better.  It was just too loud in there and the food was so-so."

The oysters all have their own flavor, too, so I do not recommend asking for lemon or any other kind of seasoning with.  We also ordered the green curry mussels, which was good, especially with the green curry flavor.  But the calamari I would skip out on.  It was greasy, and you could see the oil on the plate.

First, let me say that we had an enjoyable dinner, one great dinner, one pretty good.  But before we got to this, we had a minor disappointment.

It was Valentines Day and I had not been to Salted Sea before, so when I discovered they had a special prix fixe menu for the day so I made reservations for me and my Valentine.  I checked the website before going to the restaurant to see what the menu was, but could not find anything.  After arriving, I discovered that they were serving a salad with beef in it (my date does not eat red meat) and the entree was &#34;grilled&#34; tuna which had an asterisk indicating it was not fully cooked.  Well, neither of us are raw fish fans.  I know, that puts us in the same category as dinosaurs, but that is the way we are.  As a result, the prix fixe menu was out.

Since this was my first visit, I did not know what to expect of Salted Sea inside.  We watched it being built as we ate across the street at the Columbia City Ale House, and were excited to see a new restaurant come to the area.  In the main part of the floor, it is divided into two sections almost equally - restaurant and bar.  The result is fewer tables in the restaurant than I expected.  Not that this is bad, just unexpected.  It results in quite a large bar area, which is great for bar patrons.  In the back is a oyster bar with about 5-6 chairs.  

Now for the food.  We started with several small plates.  The crab cakes were very good and surprising to me, the slaw that came with it was excellent.  Been a long time I ate restaurant slaw that I liked.  While this was a little dry for my taste, the flavor was excellent and it had a kick to it.  Order the bread plate.  Other than having to pay for bread, I have nothing but praise for it.  Comes from the Columbia City Bakery and is very good.  Also had the grilled hearts of romaine salad.  Again, top notch and enough for both of us.

My Valentine&#39;s grilled scallops were to die for.  Perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth, with great flavor.  I ordered the duck breast.  I know, I&#39;m in a restaurant called &#34;Salted Sea&#34; and I order meat?  Well, I rarely get a chance to eat duck, so I tried it out.  I don&#39;t know if I just really do not like duck that much, or it was prepared not to my liking, but it was just ok for me.

But for desert, we had the special that was part of the special menu for the day.  Not sure exactly what it was called, but it was chocolate and it was gooooood!

Ok, so why do I give Salted Sea 4 stars?  All the food was excellent except my duck dish.  I&#39;m not sure if it was the prep or that I did not like that type of prep.  So I am giving them the benefit of the doubt.  The prix fixe menu should have been available in advance, but that it is not a reason to dock the restaurant on the rating.  So I removed only one star for the food I ate.  

This will not be put on my regular restaurant rotation due to it&#39;s prices, but it is definitely a special occasion destination."

The oysters on half shell, total catastrophic failure; the condiments on them ranges from drinking high concentration of salt to chewing on poppy seeds that doesn&#39;t do anything to help. When asked for a simple Tabasco sauce to try to take matters to our own hand to rescue the situation; there are none available. 

Then the main dishes were served; sea scallops, again biting into a layer of over powering sweet glaze. Salmon is overly crusted with a layer of overpowering salt. -- Seafood from the sea already have delicious and delicate flavor; the kitchen is simply trying too hard. 

Perhaps, our expectation were high hence the high disappointment. With the understanding that Salted Sea is new; will revisit in hope of improvement. I really want this restaurant to succeed!"

We enjoyed perfect cocktails along with several delicious small plates (I think the grilled watermelon and cotija cheese with prawns was the fave) and then shared two main dishes which were delicious, fresh and creative without being pretentious. Our server was a sweetheart. The ambience was also lovely- beautiful wood and natural elements which were simple and striking. Highly recommended!!"

The food was a bit of a let down. The cilantro lime mignonette on the raw oyster was kind of bland for a mignonette but the oyster were fresh. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the batter the calamari was dipped in, it was very &#34;floury&#34; and not crisp and i wish they gave more of the sauce it laid on top of because there wasn&#39;t enough to go around. The coconut pork belly sliders were good but I wish it was on a softer bread instead of toasty french bread slice. My mom and I were definitely not fans of the sticky garlic chicken wing. It just had this acquired taste.

I&#39;d probably come back for late night drinks but definitely not for happy hour food."

1) They serve fresh beautiful seafood in a lot of creative ways.
2) Their cocktails are a shelf above the Seattle average.  They do the classics right, and they have some thoughtful signatures.  Blackberry Smash, I&#39;m looking at you.  By the way, if you&#39;re one of those people who thinks that fruity drinks are only for the ladies, please stop reading, and go away.  Maybe to southern Texas or a Denny&#39;s.
3) The owner is a local trying to do something different in a neighborhood that deserves it!

Cons:
1) They have several menus, happy hour, lunch, brunch, dinner, etc.  It&#39;s hard to know what will be available when!
2) While they have an respectable selection of oysters, they serve each variety with a preassigned accent.  I like my oysters plain most of the time, or with just a hint of lemon juice.  I&#39;m talking raw in case that wasn&#39;t obvious.

All in all, I see Salted Sea as a place with fantastic food, that still has a couple of logistics to work out.  I recommend going there with an open mind and healthy appetite.  When you leave, you&#39;ll probably have learned something about seafood and booze."

Overall the food was just okay. The service was great and the decor was minimal/modern, but I wouldn&#39;t come back...well, maybe for the HH oysters only.
Raw oysters-Really cheap because of HH making it $1 each. I enjoyed the raw oysters because it had a subtle flavor and tasted fresh.
Crispy calamari-I wasn&#39;t a fan of this. The coating tasted doughy and I felt like the sweet chili sauce being already poured over the calamari made it less crispy. I wish the sauce came separately. Something I did like about the calamari was the addition of the scallion.
Spicy green curry mussels-I didn&#39;t like this and it was disappointing because the waitress told me it was one of the popular items. It was very bland and I was expecting something like a Thai green curry flavor with a hint of sweetness but it was just plain and very watery. 
Sticky garlic chicken wings-This was way too salty for me (maybe too much fish sauce?)."

I will definitely go back as I am hoping this was just an off night. Although, being a Friday night at 7pm I would have thought they would be much better prepared.

First issue that I had was that we made a reservation but were seated in the bar directly facing a massive tv. I understand that there are only so many seats in a restaurant but when you make a reservation on a Friday night for 2 people at a Seafood restaurant your goal is not to sit in a bar, directly in front of a massive tv with other tables so close your elbows touch other people.

Service:
- We were seated promptly but no one checked on us for ~10 minutes.
- When I ordered the food I tried to explain that we would like to do 6 dishes in 3 courses. This was completely ignored and my girlfriends &#39;entree&#39; came out with the appetizers....
- No forks at our table....after getting our appetizers and waiting patiently for ~10 minutes (without being able to eat) I had to get up and ask the hostess if we could have some forks.
- Food came out in no discernible order or rhythm.
- Table to our left weren&#39;t served 2 courses that they ordered. Table to our right weren&#39;t checked on for at least 15 minutes after being seated. Unfortunately we were sitting QUITE close to both tables so we essentially experienced their whole ordeal.
- After finishing our dinner and experiencing the issues we did and the tables around us did I think this is more the norm than the outlier. 

You could just tell that the general mood of the people in the restaurant was frustration.

Food:
All dishes on the menu sounded extremely good and were presented well. Unfortunately the consistent theme across all the dishes was a SERIOUS lack of seasoning. It almost felt like the chef does not use salt. I am not some salt fanatic but every dish needed a fair amount of salt to be added. Another frustrating thing was that the table did not have salt and pepper and I didn&#39;t want to hunt down the hostess again to ask.

Mentioned this above but it is hard to gauge a meal holistically when appetizers, entrees, soups and salads come out in no discernible order. 

Drinks:
I ordered sparkling water and I am 99% sure I kept getting soda water.

After writing all this out I realize that this meal was a lot worse than I had originally thought it was."

Went last Friday. The reservation was honored without delay.  Sat. Waiter came quickly.  Ordered wine, oysters, and other dishes.  All was well at the beginning.

But the oysters did not come.  In fact, 3 other hot dishes came within 2 minutes. We explained that oysters should come before any other cooked dish due to their delicate flavors.  One waiter kindly took the dishes back while the other waiter showed defensive body language.

Oysters came and they were very good.

While we were at our 3rd oyster, all 5 hot dishes came within 2 minutes, from salad to frites to entrees.  

The flavors were fantastic but we couldn&#39;t really pace ourselves to enjoy the dinner.

Then the waiter pour red wine into my white wine.  It was an accident but...

The issue(s)?  The chefs in the kitchen should have paced properly (or should I say, at all).  This wasn&#39;t the waiter&#39;s fault; she just brought out whatever was ready.  But the team should have been attentive, at least a little.  Give a bit break between each dish.  The waiter was polite on the surface but you sense that they didn&#39;t really care much else (not happy with her job?  Too stressed out that day?  Or simply has not been trained properly?).  In a restaurant like this they should provide services at least above the level of a take-out order, if you know what I mean.

Inattentive services that are below the basic level seem to be prevalent in Seattle these days."

Had booked a reservation earlier through OpenTable but we didn&#39;t really need it as there was plenty of room.  I&#39;ve been meaning to try this place for awhile so i was pretty excited to dig into it.  We originally were seated at a small table cramped next to two other couples and i asked the waitress if we could get a larger table as i wanted to order a lot of food, she was able to move us without a problem and their service throughout the night  was great.  

We ordered half a dozen oysters, the spicy green mussels, the steamed clams, the frites, and our Entrees were the Halibut and the Fish and Chips.

The half dozen oysters we got were very good, not the best but they were good.  Definitely go for HH though 3 dollars an oyster? no thanks.

The steamed clams were only okay, i felt like they were a little bland, and i wish they would have added some bread to soak up the liquid.

The star of the whole dinner however was the Spicy Green mussels! i could eat a whole bowl of these to myself.  They were cooked perfectly! i dunno if other reviews scared them off but it seemed like most of the dishes we had were under seasoned.

the frites were okay, nothing special they&#39;re just fries after all.  I&#39;d definitely skip it next time.

As for the Entrees the Halibut was awesome, great crust on the skin, the sauce was delicious and complemented the delicate flavor of the fish perfectly.  

The fish and chips was just okay also.  They used real fish so i guess that&#39;s a plus.

This place is a cool little spot, but next time i&#39;ll go for happy hour only for sure."

Came here with my wife and parents for dinner and was very impressed. With the four of us ordering, we ended up with most of the menu arriving on our table - and I must say, it was delightful.

The oysters came out without delay; a dozen mixed between Kumamoto, Shigoku, and Hood Canal Pacifics. Along with this was the Columbia City Bakery bread and butter (almost an expectation for any restaurant in CC). The oysters were all mouthwatering. beautifully presented, each with an unique garnish/accompaniment that paired wonderfully with the character of each.

Then the meal really began. Calamari x2, crab cakes, mussels, cod and chips, scallops, king salmon, and the grilled baby summer squash. I could delve into each of these meals and tell you why you should get them, but honestly, it is worth a trip out for yourself.

Inspired by Community is their motto for good reason. Their origins come from the community and it shows in the love of this restaurant and their support for everything local from their alcohol to their ice cream selections.

The more martinis I drank the more ethical I felt.  At the table, the server offered great wine recommendations and the by-the-glass selection was excellent.

We started with oysters offering an explosive color palter - rich orange tawny colors and scintillating grey - over-delivering on what was promised.  I had the grilled romaine salad (lightly dressed and with shaved ricotta) and the smoked trout salad (with goat cheese truffles), two small plates making for a perfect meal.  The house made fries with smoked oyster mayo were so good, we ordered a second helping for the table.  We also had the rice crusted king salmon - perfectly well-prepared with great flavor - loving the simple but sophisticated preparation of the sautéed mustard greens.  The ling cod and chips went over so well, that we ordered a second helping of these as well.  The crispy sea salt and vinegar potatoes where just about the best &#34;chips&#34; I&#39;ve ever had."

I made the reservation and was pretty excited about this place (from all the glorious reviews). The place looked really nice, menu looked interesting, waitress was very friendly. The food though... left a lot to be desired. 
We ordered a dozen of oysters (a must for raw bar right?), shrimp toast, cold scallops, and soup to start with. 
Let me also mention that it was not that busy when we got there, as there were a lot of empty tables. Despite this, everything took forever. There were staff members standing around not really doing much, and not noticing that we were waiting a long time. We were not sure what&#39;s going on in the kitchen.
After 45 minutes (yes, that long), raw oysters came out... do I need to say &#34;11 of them&#34;. They missed one which we thought it was funny at first. The waitress went to fix that right away. She brought out 2 more for us but they were obviously a lot smaller than those 11 on the plate. hmmmm.. ok. Sadly, the oysters were not fresh. (Yes, that yucky after taste)
The flavor was plain. Very plain. Very very plain. Everything was under seasoned. You know you didn&#39;t have a good meal when you were left thinking that &#34;I can make this dish better at home&#34;. We were very disappointed. After 1 hour and 20 minutes and pricy check, we left hungry and disappointed. We went to another restaurant down the street to help us forget this terrible experience.
Not sure if we got there on a bad night but definitely not going back."

Which ends at 5pm so you might have to ditch work early to make it!  Oysters are $1 - AWESOME! They serve it with rhubarb mignonette which doesn&#39;t have much flavor. I usually like something with horse radish to give it a kick. French fries are served with oyster mayo which was over kill because we ordered 7 dozen oysters for our group. When you ask for ketchup they give you ketchup/harissa mix. Delicious !!! Also ordered green curry mussel &amp; mini sliders.  Great vibe and not crowded during happy hour at all.

Ordered the NYE 4-course meal which included a thinly sliced, raw scallop dish, an oyster stew/soup, a seared roast beef dish, and a baked pear tart dessert.  We also had crabcakes and calamari as side dishes.  

The scallop slices are an aquired taste with them being raw and slightly chewy.  They were however, fresh, with no fishy taste or smell.  

The oyster stew/soup dish was good flavor wise until you bite into the oysters, which were either over done or slightly on the rotten side.  The smell and taste was extremely pungent, and I ate the rest with Tobasco sauce.

The seared roast beef medallions were a little too rare for me, but overall, good flavor and texture.  They gladly cooked them a little more for me.  

The crabcakes and calamari were average, not anything special for this price point in the Seattle area.

Alas, the best dish of the night was indeed, the 4th course, the baked pear tart dessert.  

I did enjoy the atmosphere, decor, and cleanliness of the restaurant.  Trendy, but it&#39;s pricey and I didn&#39;t think the seafood I experienced was that great IMO."

The place is well designed and the staff is very friendly.  Our friends thought the fish was good.

My main problem is that we had called a day in advance to confirm they had vegetarian dishes, asked again about them upon our arrival, and only after finishing our appetizers were we told that, in fact, they did not have the vegetarian dish, but that the chef would prepare something for us.  We received a tasty salad - rather amazing given the likely lack of items on hand - but were then charged $17 for the plate.  

An underwhelming experience that I hope is due to their still getting everything sorted."

What I love is that they have really authentic options as well as creative and thoughtful vegetarian options, and classic Americanized sushi like California rolls. There&#39;s something for everyone here! The fish is of the highest quality and all the rolls were superb. We got two appetizers, one sautéed eggplant dish and a tofu dish, both vegetarian, both impressed my meat loving boyfriend.

It was very crowded, we waited for about 30 mins and noone could come to get us to the table. The waiter told us to share our table with a stranger which is very weird. I have nerver heard anything like this in this kind of good restaurant! So we decided to leave after 45 mins waiting. And they just say good-bye.

I was told by many people this is &#34;THE&#34; place for a good bowl of ramen.To my disappointment it did not amazed me as I thought it would. Broth was just wayyy to salty, cook on the noodle/egg/pork was good though. This is coming from a guy that had visited Japan and it did not live up to its hype. 

Next time I will try their sushi, since they do seem to rotate their fish selection."

Got there around 11:10 and was first in line. At around 11:15 the line started building up and eventually made its way around the bend so I am not sure where it ended. They let in a pretty large group when they open, so if you come at 11:30-11:45 you should make it in the first seating. 

It is a great deal (~$9 for ramen, gyoza, and rice) but that&#39;s if you don&#39;t consider the time you will be waiting. Wait, cost, service, presentation, etc. aside, the food is just OK. 

Gyoza arrived just before the ramen. Great flavor, but they arrived cold/room temp. I still scarfed them down before the ramen had a chance to arrive. 

Ramen rolled in and the first thing I tried was the broth. It was decent. Not bad, not fantastic. A bit salty for my taste and lacked meaty richness. Unless you just really love Tokyo style broths, there are tastier broths in Seattle. Chashu was yummy, nice and tender, but it was a very meager portion. Only 1/2 of a typical chashu slice. Actually, all of the toppings came in small quantities except the noodles. Noodles were in abundance, but were probably my least favorite part of the bowl. A bit overdone. 

Overall, it&#39;s OK. If it was a quick lunch spot--get in, get out--I would probably stop by again if I lived or worked near here. However, it isn&#39;t quick and the limited window to experience the ramen is inconvenient to plan around. I wouldn&#39;t wait again and I don&#39;t quite understand the hype, but I am glad I tried."

I don&#39;t think I eat THAT much but their lunch chirashi did not even make me full. I&#39;m a pretty small person too. The quality of fish was merely decent but you get what you pay for, I suppose.

Tsukushinbo is small and has that comfortable hole-in-the-wall vibe. Service is quick and friendly so the only thing lacking for me really is the food. I will probably give this place a second try in the future but not exactly dying to go back.

Some notable nigiri that were served to us included the seared squid (rare to find one that&#39;s perfectly done), hamachi belly, scallops (extremely sweet in flavor), and the variety of snappers. We also finished the meal with a bowl of sushi soup (lol?). It was like a small chirashi bowl with soup added to it. It was my first time experiencing this, but I really enjoyed it. The broth was light and was hot enough to lightly cook the outside of the slices of fish.

You&#39;ve got your basic array of sushi, udon, and donburi-type dishes. We ordered the tendon (tempura over rice) and the katsudon (chicken katsu mixed with egg over rice). It was alright, but not inspiring as the lines would suggest. If you are new to Japanese food and izakaya life, this is a good start.

The service was slow, but they were understaffed. We made a reservation, but still had to wait fifteen minutes to be seated even though there were empty tables. Not a huge deal, but one more waiter could&#39;ve helped with the flow of people a little bit more.

Overall, this place is ok. I&#39;m glad they seem to be doing so well, but I much prefer Maneki for the food and Maekawa Bar for the no-fuss izakaya feel."

I got hiyashi chuka (cold ramen), the daily special ($9.50), which was delicious. The dish was very filling, and the amount of noodles was well balanced with the amount of toppings and sauce. This definitely isn&#39;t a place that tries to fill you up on noodles while skimping on other things.

I had the fortune to go here by myself.  I say the fortune, because the place is very small and their just happened to be a seat at the bar when I walked up.  Coming from the Bay Area, 19/20 sushi places are run by people that are not Japanese.  That does not make it bad, but there is something special about the care and effort put forth by a true Itamae.  As such,  you can expect to pay a premium for the quality of the food and service.

My BF ordered the bento box dinner combo for $19 (salmon teriyaki, fried tempura and grilled mackerel) and I got the 16 piece sashimi dinner set for $28. Both our meals came with a bowl of rice and miso soup. I felt a bit greased after seeing other people&#39;s picture of the sashimi set. My pieces were pretty small compared to others. The sashimi set was somewhat not worth it because of that, but also very filling. I&#39;m not too big of a fan on trying different types of raw fish/seafood, but the salmon, tuna and mackerel ending up being my absolute favorite. I definitely recommend the bento box set dinner (mackerel and salmon was grilled perfectly moist and flavorful) as it is more worth it, and if you&#39;re just a one fish lover like myself, I&#39;ll just add the sashimi or nigiri on the side. We also ordered spicy tuna roll $7.50 for 5 pieces. It was not worth the price and the mixture is more brown than red (how I&#39;m use to) and tasted a bit odd. Not my favorite, I&#39;ll skip it! 

I have to admit, I do prefer Maneki for their prices, variety of items on menu and bento boxes (since they give a lot more for less) but the sashimi here seems more fresh.

We get its very small but why take reservations you can&#39;t handle. They comp us a sake bottle which was very generous. The omakase wasn&#39;t anything amazing. It was good fish but not the best I ever had. The sashimi omakase is a way bigger bang for your buck than the nigiri. It was a very mediocre experience."

Located in International District, Tsukushinbo seats a small number of people inside but continues to create smiles as customers leave. You can make a reservation here which I highly recommend because it can get busy. There aren&#39;t that many tables here and it isn&#39;t the most ideal place for big parties. There is also limited bar seating as well where you can see the sushi chefs making their delicacies. 

For their sashimi, nigiri and sushi rolls they have a piece of paper where you can check off the quantity for each thing you want. They also have a menu that goes over what is in the rolls, as well as some appetizers and other Japanese entrees. Tonight, my friend and I decided on an order of tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, a caterpillar roll, a crunchy roll, and an order of yakko.

Tuna sashimi - The tuna was fatty and thick and melted in your mouth. It was literally like tasting the sea. This is the best tuna sashimi I have tasted.
Salmon sashimi - SO good. I am a huge salmon fan and this was so creamy and fat. I liked adding a squeeze of lemon to it. 
Caterpillar roll - If you&#39;re a lover of unagi and avocado then this roll will make you smile. It had the ripest and creamiest avocado I have ever had on a sushi roll and the chunks of unagi were not skimped out on.
Crunchy roll - Lover of shrimp tempura? This one is for you. The roll itself is covered in those crunchy little flakes and there are plump pieces of perfectly tempuraed shrimp.
Yakko - This reminds me of like a cold version of agadashi tofu. It&#39;s soft tofu that is chilled in ice and comes with sauce in a separate bowl. Really refreshing appetizer.

Service was excellent here. The waiters are really attentive and they want to make sure that you&#39;re enjoying every part of your meal. Water and tea was constantly refilled, even when the glasses were not empty. Edamame is given complimentary here as well. 

Overall, really enjoyed the quality of sashimi and rolls here. Service made me feel very taken care of and I had a wonderful dinner here. Price wise, it is a bit pricey but the quality makes up for it. The total without tip was a little over $60 for what was ordered.

Would recommend as a dinner date spot that isn&#39;t too fancy but not casual."

Overall, eating here was a pleasant experience. The waitstaff were quick and attentive, the atmosphere was warm and cozy and food is pretty good. A friend and I made reservations for a late night dinner at 830pm and even by then, this place was packed. 

We ordered 4 types of sushi rolls (Tskushinbo, Seattle, plus two others I can&#39;t remember the name of) and an order of katsu for the appetizer. For the sushi itself, it was around a 40-50 min wait due to the orders of people in front of us. In the time that we waited for the main food, we had some miso soup and katsu. The chicken katsu itself was done well, with it&#39;s light and flaky tempura batter and the salad that came with this was interesting with its mayo sauce.

Being a huge sushi roll fan, the sushi rolls we ordered from here were pretty good but not fantastically good in comparison to the many sushi joints in Seattle. Of the 4 rolls we ordered, I really do enjoy the Tsukushinbo roll with its fresh spicy tuna. This left a nice zingy aftertaste when eaten. As for the other rolls, it was the standard of multiple ingredients stacked onto each other (imagine salmon, eel, tuna on each other and various sauces etc etc) and proved to be quite filling. In addition, the sushi roll didn&#39;t seem as fresh since it looked like it sat on the counter for some time, but given how busy the restaurant was, it was understandable that food wouldn&#39;t arrive as quickly when it was done. 

Overall, this place is pretty good for sushi and making advanced reservations is highly recommended due to the popularity and small size of this place. When trying to find this restaurant, simply walk on Main street and look for a super packed Japanese restaurant that has no sign on the front door. :)"

Make sure to call in advance and expect a wait even with a reservation- this happens to me often. They should improve on getting clients to their table speedily but make up for it with quality meals. 

I enjoy their donburi&#39;s - the egg one in particular. And the soba is excellent."

There are no signs outside of the restaurant, so just make sure you find the address &#34;517&#34; and go right next door. My friend and I made a reservation to the restaurant for dinner on a Friday evening, and making a reservation alone was a hassle (my only criticism). I tried calling MANY times during lunch hours the same day, and no one picked up the phone (trust me, I called 10+ times...). In their answering machine message, they say to leave them a voicemail if you&#39;d like to make a reservation and they will call you later in the afternoon to confirm. Luckily they called me at 4pm the same day to confirm our reservation. When we got there, we were able to put in our order fairly quickly, even though we were being really indecisive about what to get! We ended up getting gyoza, 2 orders of sashimi rolls (I forgot which fish we got...), the marine roll, white kabuto roll, and seattle roll - ALL delicious!!! In each of the sashimi and sushi rolls, they gave us a generous amount of fish, which definitely was surprising since most other Japanese restaurants are...not so generous when it comes to the fish. We had trouble finishing all of the dishes we ordered and ended up having a couple of pieces of rolls remaining. I also ordered the Chirashi Bowl to go and each piece of sashimi included in the bowl was GINORMOUS!

Yes, this restaurant is hard to get to, hard to find, and insanely small. If you do plan on coming here for dinner, you MUST make a reservation or I guarantee you will be waiting in a long line (even though the wait would definitely be worth it!). I can&#39;t wait to come here again!!"

Sure the sashimi was delicious and fresh*, but seeing tables around us get served before us even though they were seated after us is insulting.  At least the Asahi filled us up and I was thankful for the great company.  Our server was cool, kept apologizing (at least 10 times) for the two chefs&#39; poor organizational abilities, and he gave us some complimentary edamame and seaweed salad.  It was only a Wednesday night and they seemed slow and needed reminders for everything- sauce dishes, water, the damn bill.  I won&#39;t be returning, and there are better fishes in the Sea.

I really enjoyed a cozy, quiet dinner with a friend. The menu was a little overwhelming, but I liked every single thing I ordered.

As expected, the restaurant is tiny and probably seats no more than 35 people so reservations are highly encouraged.

It was a full house so as our party of 5 was ordering, we were told it was going to take a while for the chef to accommodate our order. We ordered a few things off the cooked menu while we waited: vegetable tempura, soft shell crab karaage (pretty good but would only share with two other people), and broiled salmon belly. The broiled salmon belly is SOO GOOD and would recommend if you like the more common, broiled salmon collar. The texture just melts in your mouth.

After 45 mins, we saw the chef pull out this longg wooden board and knew it had to be our order. We got a few orders of their otoro/fatty tuna (part of their special menu), tuna, yellowtail, salmon, sweet shrimp, eel, and uni. We were impressed with the texture and consistency of the fish here. The otoro did not disappoint and simply fell apart in your mouth. My second favorite was the eel but the salmon and sweet shrimp were also really exceptional. The fried shrimp heads that follow came out hot, crispy, but not greasy. The fish to rice portion is also good compared to the more Americanized Japanese restaurants here.

The service was good considering how busy they are. One negative is only street parking in the area. If you&#39;re in the ID, I&#39;d choose Tsukushinbo over Maneki&#39;s as long as we get reservations."

One of the rare places around here that seems to make it according to my research. Apparently it&#39;s a modern ritual for Japanese students to enjoy this the night before exams because katsu sounds like &#34;to be victorious!&#34; (Thanks Wikipedia). So naturally I sought it out for future use prior to my Board exams. So simple, homey, and delicious. The sauce was a good amount of sweetness and it came with a bowl of miso to warm the soul. It also came with your choice of chicken or pork. Definitely coming back for it before my next exams."

The exterior is not marked with anything so you just have to walk by and hope that people are inside! Which is usually the case since this place is always full.

I&#39;ve eaten here a few times and the best thing to do is to make a reservation prior. Otherwise the wait times could be unpredictable. Definitely do not show up without a reservation if you have more than 4 people because it&#39;ll be near impossible to get a seat.

The menu is mostly sushi but there are other dishes. There&#39;s a Japanese menu on the wall. My Japanese is not super great but I did make out &#34;soba salad&#34; (そばサラド) so there&#39;s that.

The food from what I remember is pretty good. On my most recent dinner they didn&#39;t have kitsune noodles so i just got an assortment of small dishes.

The ikura was very fishy. Almost a bit sour. I&#39;m not sure if I really liked this one.

The tamago was pretty good. There wasn&#39;t a lot of rice in comparison to the egg.

The salad was nice. I really like the salad dressing here. It&#39;s probably one of my favorites. The sauce is so tangy.

The curry and rice was not bad! They give you a lot of curry for like $10 which is a good deal.

I also had some of the Tsukushinbo roll. It seemed like a glorified California roll but with some spicy and crunchy stuff. I thought it was good."

I would definitely recommend making a reservation during weekend nights like this since tsukushinbo is a pretty small place and isn&#39;t really suitable for large groups. By the time my group and I were seated, several groups of people were waiting outside--even a table for two wasn&#39;t available.

Wasn&#39;t able to try the ramen specials people on yelp wrote about, but there were some pretty orgasmic items on the menu that satisfied me! The monkfish liver sashimi was probably the best I have ever had in my life--perfect and not too salty or powerful/fishy tasting. The scallop sashimi was also one of the best here--very sweet, smooth, soft. I don&#39;t really like eating sushi since most of the time if just feels like I&#39;m shoving rice with flavor in my mouth but the marine roll was great! The okra salad is def something people that don&#39;t eat veggies much would enjoy and the gyu tan was amazing and a beautiful work of art! Some of the other things I tried were pretty good, but these were the ones I liked most. 

Service was great, food was pretty good, presentation is awesome, and the prices are a little on the pricey side as expected from good japanese restaurants. I would recommend trying the monkfish liver sashimi, scallop sashimi, the marine roll, okra salad, and the gyu tan (beef tongue)!!"

The experience was really phenomenal. I purposefully chose the word &#34;experience&#34; rather than &#34;grab sushi&#34; or &#34;dinner.&#34; Watching the chefs create and cut really incredible edible art made the whole evening very unique. The service was a little rushed/delayed- understandably so being their Friday dinner rush, but the people watching and trying to figure out what the heck to order proved we needed extra time anyway! 

Wrapped in the rolls were some of the freshest fish in Seattle, perfectly cut with nicely seasoned rice. I wish I was more adventurous to branch away from rolls and sashimi- I have a feeling this is the place to do so.

And tsukushinbo had done it! Hahaha

We ordered beer to start. A seaweed salad, six Nigiris, two rolls, and roast ox-tongue. The salad and roast ox-tongue was mediocre. I&#39;m not a fan for rolls but my friend said they were not bad. Seafood was fresh, but rice underneath wasn&#39;t good, I find that a common problem for Japanese food here... Anyway, tsukushinbo was not bad overall! Though I kind of expected more."

Took a friend out here for her birthday, should have called earlier for a reservation. Really hidden and small, but a cute gem. There are like 8 tables in this restaurant and a sushi bar fit for about 6 comfortably. Even at 9, on a Monday, we were waiting. 

Sat down and we knew we were ordering sushi.  Had the sashimi set and a udon with tempura.  Our waitress was super sweet, and even with a lot of tables waiting she was attentive and great with customer service.  

The food: complimentary sea salted edamame served first. Their udon was exactly what I wanted. Not so salty broth and not so sweet either! With chewy noodles. Tempura is served separately and not dunked inside the udon, delicious. You can taste how clean their oil is. Sashimi- buttery goodness of the northwest.

The restaurant is small so do make reservations when you come here. Dishes cost from $4-26 each and dishes are small. 

Fried flounder was good but could be fried more so you do not have to deal with bones. Geo duck, copper river salmon, and scallop nigiri was fresh and tasty. Salmon and yellowtail sashimi would have been great if they didnt have a rectangular cut, and it is too thick. Sashimi taste better when it is slimmer.

I have read all the good reviews about ita authentic Japanese food, so I was pretty excited when my wife made reservation for Sat night family dinner. However I don&#39;t think it lives up to it&#39;s reputation.

I like the interior decoration and the blackboard menu on the wall, which added a Japanese cafe atmosphere. 

The seaweed salad was Just OK, and the vegetable salad was just ordinary.

The sushi dinner costs $22, while the chirashi was $26. For this price and its reputation, I expected something great, something extraordinary about really fresh seafood ingredients and excellent cuts from experience sushi chef. However, what I got was just ordinary sushi. The sushi was just so so, the chirashi was OK but not great. The tuna on sushi was even a little dry. Those dishes definitely did not distinguish it from any other Japanese restaurants. 

I Kept thinking that did we order the right dish? Should we try lunch menu, which might be better? Was it the right chef? But again, it was a Sat night dinner, which should be their best chef&#39;s shift...so, it should be better.

The restaurant is a bit hard to find as there is no signage so be prepared to be looking through storefronts. Parking hasn&#39;t been too hard to find. The food isn&#39;t too pricey but my no means cheap.. But that&#39;s to be expected with high quality sushi-- which they no doubt serve! I&#39;d say service is a bit slow but it might have to do with the fact they have been packed every time I&#39;ve been!! But I guess that in itself is a good sign!"

Other than that, the food was good and I can understand where the hype is coming from. I got the salmon+avacado sushi roll, and you can tell that the salmon pieces were fresh. I also got the tsukoshinbo roll, which turned out to be a little too spicy for my liking because of the spicy mayo (I&#39;m usually good with spicy mayo but this one was a little different). 

I wouldn&#39;t say I had a phenomenal experience here in terms of service, because they were clearly understaffed for the crowd they attract every day. We had to remind our waiter to take our order and serve us water. Both waiters seemed to be all over the place throughout our time there. You&#39;d think that for such a popular restaurant, they would be more organized. 

One tip, do make reservations WAY in advance before coming here, especially around this time of the year so you don&#39;t have to wait in the cold. We were extremely lucky to get a table because we were first in line, but the second party had to wait another 45 minutes because of all the pre-made reservations."

Arrive early for lunch because there will be a wait."

Place isn&#39;t very big and seems to fill up. Probably like 8 spots at the bar. Probably no bueno if you don&#39;t make a reservation. There is no sign in front so you&#39;ll just have to map it and walk along the street. 

Food: We started with 2 appetizers: Agedashi tofu ($5.50) - pretty normal, the liquid it was sitting in was thicker than how I usually see it served, Soft shell crab karaage ($8.50) - I&#39;m not a huge soft shell crab fan but this was very good. Would recommend. We had an omakase dinner for two. The quality of the nigiri was good, although Kisaku is still my favorite, but the differences are very minimal. One thing that I would note is the raw shrimp. They are huge and they put a quail egg yolk over it, which made it even better. Good stuff. 

Prices: Their omakase is split up by $35/45/55 price range. We ordered $55 for each of us, expecting about 16-17 pieces of nigiri. I ended up only having 13 (bc I was getting full) and my boyfriend had 17. They charged us $80 total. I don&#39;t know how they calculate this. Usually it&#39;s done by piece, but maybe it&#39;s different here. Regardless, I felt like the prices were lower than I expected and in comparison to Shiros and Kisaku.

As always enjoyed omakase at the sushi bar experience. I would recommend this much more than just sitting at the table if you don&#39;t have a huge party. I would come back. Prices are a bit lower and quality is still good."

This place is literally a hole in the wall at International District. I didn&#39;t see a sign at front of the door and didn&#39;t realize there was a restaurant at this one area until I saw my friend walk in lol. It&#39;s a whole lot smaller than I imagined but really crowded! I heard the wait time to get in can take a while but we made reservations, so I highly suggest doing that if you eat here especially on a weekend (we went on a Friday night). Because of the limited space we were awkwardly placed next to a couple sitting on a booth so I&#39;m pretty sure they heard everything we said.

I really liked the food choices on the menu, seemed like a very typical Japanese restaurant. I saw that they had onigiri, noodles, bentou with katsu and karaage, and sushi. I heard of the kitsune soup from watching a bunch of anime (lol) so I wanted to give that a try with udon noodles. I still wanted sushi so I ordered salmon nigiri and the Crunchy Roll. My friend got a bentou combo of pork katsu and karaage (which comes with miso soup!), two rolls of the Tsukushinbo and a Dragon Roll. Surprisingly our food came out fairly fast! The kitsune soup was pretty good! The sweet bean curd sheet was really interesting to me, it was a bit hard to cut into smaller pieces but I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s what makes the flavor of the soup. I thought there would be more fish cakes in it but only came with one. The udon noodles were very chewy, the way I like it! I was really hoping one of the sushi rolls had salmon in it but I didn&#39;t see any on the menu which is why I ordered salmon nigiri. It was very good and melts right in your mouth but I wasn&#39;t aware they put a little bit of wasabi in there. It wasn&#39;t too bad but I don&#39;t like wasabi. All of the other rolls were really good too! My favorite out of everything we ordered was the Crunchy Roll mainly because I love shrimp tempura. The Dragon Roll would be my second.

Overall I had a really good first experience here! It&#39;s a bit on the pricey side but I would still come here again and try other things on their menu. Of course I wouldn&#39;t come here with a big group but would still recommend everyone to try it!"

My boyfriend and I arrived about 15 minutes before they opened and I was worried we wouldn&#39;t get a seat since we could already see a long line forming. Luckily, we got a couple seats at the bar, but getting here early is a good idea. We both ordered the ramen lunch special, which comes with gyoza, rice, and shoyu ramen. The gyoza was good. Nothing special but it was just good. The ramen was pretty delicious too. The portion was kind of small but that&#39;s my only complaint. The broth was flavorful. Not too salty and the noodles were good. The star of the show was the pork! It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. My bf really enjoyed it. Also, the price of the special wasn&#39;t bad at all. Definitely an awesome lunch special. I just wish I could get it more often (I work on the Eastside)."

Approaching the location and realizing there was a line of people waiting for the doors to open was intriguing. We started of we a simply made Seattle roll them at was fresh and basic. This location has daily specials which we chose to go with for our entree.  Think fat soba noodles in what can only be described as possibly the best ramen broth I have ever had was paired with a fried pork cutie and soft egg over rice. The sweet and well prepared pork and rice paired magically with the robust salty broth. Price was great for portion size. Staff was fast moving and even kept the water glasses full. Absolutely fantastic meal and I would recommend to anyone to give it a sit down. Just get there early or there won&#39;t be any seats left.

I ordered the rainbow roll and mushroom soba noodle salad. The salad was much larger than I expected and even though we shared it, there was still enough to take home. It had green tea soba noodles, shitake mushrooms and some chili powder (the stuff you put on udon) to give it a little kick. The rainbow roll was fresh and I slowly savored every bite.

My husband ordered a combination dinner of salmon teriyaki and chicken katsu. It came with miso soup and rice. Simple presentation, not a lot of extras, and quality food. 

We did not have any room left for dessert. In our book, this was the best Japanese food we&#39;ve had so far since we moved here."

For 8.95 you get a bowl of ramen, small bowl of rice, and 3 gyoza. I&#39;ve been meaning to go here on Friday to try this out for 2 years and finally got a chance to go today. If you want to try their ramen, I suggest you come early before they open cause there&#39;s gonna be a line and they only have a limited amount they serve.

The ramen soup was rich and very tasty, the broth was hot and very good. Pork chasu was tender, wish they gave me a bigger piece. Nothing special about the gyoza. Will try to come back when I get another Friday off."

It is the mom and pop Japanese restaurant that you keep going back to because of the personal attention to detail and the friendly staff.  More importantly, the food is consistently great!  Not embellished by many sauces for their rolls, but I am not a huge fan of rolls.  I would recommend the chirashi bowl here or the omakase.  They have two tiers of omakase and I would recommend sitting at the sushi counter if possible.  It is just always a greater experience when you sit at the sushi counter.  You can even ask the sushi chef if you need shoyu (soy sauce) or not when you eat each piece of nigiri during your omakase.  The omakase will change with the seasons as they only serve the freshest fish around.  The pieces of sashimi are generous and made in a way that makes your mouth water each time you take a bite.  The side dishes are also recommended if you are a bigger eater.  Usually, I cannot handle that much food in one sitting, but if you are feeling up to it, you can&#39;t go wrong because the food is always delicious!
PRO: Love the personal touch of a small business &amp; delicious sushi
CON: Customer service is okay
TRY: Omakase &amp; Chirashi"

Apparently Friday is the day for Ramen special here.  We ordered soyu ramen, chirashi bowl, sushi and sashimi lunch special and went with the suggestion of the Marine roll.  Everything was incredible!  The ramen was probably the best I&#39;ve had this side of Pacific Ocean.  The ramen noodle was cooked to perfection, the broth flavorful and not just salty.  The Marine roll was incredible as I&#39;ve never been a fan of raw scallop until now!  We ordered another one as it was gone in minutes.  The only negative is that the sushi is not authentic as the fish is just laid on a cube of rice instead of hand kneed.  The fish and the rice comes apart as soon as you pick it up.  Furthermore, the rice not flavorful and the texture not true.  However, all the fish was fresh and flavorful. 

The reason I give it a 5 star is the value of the food.  Given the quality and freshness of food, this place is cheap in comparison with other sushi places.  We ordered 8 different lunch dishes and the total was only $100!  Not bad for stuffing ourselves silly with quality sushi/sashimi/ramen! Now I found my goto place for Japanese food in Seattle!

This place is only open from 12-2 on weekdays, so if you don&#39;t want to stand in line in (cold and wet outside) anticipation, show up by 11:30 for their first seating as the place is small."

Had dinner on a Monday night, and consider myself lucky for having a seat. Was one of the first two parties in line (they were 2 people, we were 3). They asked if I had a reservation, which I didnt, and they were able to accomidate. 

The three of us ordered the following: Tempura with rice, Tempura Udon Bowl, &#39;Pick Two&#39; with Mackrel and chicken teryaki (with rice). We also ordered the Spicy Tuna, Salmon Nigiri, and June Rolls. 

Our food came out pretty fast, and the best of the bunch was the tempura udon bowl. The noodles were really good, the broth was perfect, and the tempura was cooked great. Definitely try the spicy tuna roll. Very good and has a great kick of spice!  

My main complaints are: Service was not great for as small as this place is, and though good, the sushi took forever."

The food was decent, but don&#39;t plan on coming here for a lunch break unless you&#39;ve got 2-3 hours to spare. I give it two stars due to the extremely long wait.

In general, the other sushi and sashimi were fresh with the exception of the salmon sashimi and uni sushi. The salmon sashimi tasted bland without any flavor. The soba was over cooked. The noodles were too soft. The sake was good. The California rolls was good. The spider and crunchy roll was ok."

I had picked this place due to the mouthwatering ramen pictures. Apparently I didn&#39;t do a thorough research because they only serve ramen on Fridays during lunch from noon to something and it&#39;s limited to 50 people. And we missed it by 6 hours. Hahah! 

Not going to lie, I was disappointed and had shown manfriend the pictures! But we decided to give it a try and best decision everrrr! We had the most freaking amazing salmon sashimi everrrr! One plate was not enough and we ordered another! It was so fresh, so meaty/fatty, so irresistibly delicious! Squeeze some lemon on it..you will float to salmon heaven. 

I decided to be bold and try something different! I&#39;ve never had cold soba before. Or at least I didn&#39;t think I did. I ordered the regular and green tea soba combo with mixed tempura. Yaaaasss, I totally loved it. I liked the regular soba more than the green tea one. Green tea was good but I&#39;ll just have it as a tea or dessert. Can&#39;t ever go wrong with tempura but I shouldn&#39;t say that cuz it can! I can&#39;t stand places that drown the tempura in the batter, so essentially you&#39;re eating flour. Anyways, tempura was so yummy! They dipped it LIGHTLY in tempura batter which I loved because I can still taste the veggies or shrimp. I get my veggies and protein in with a crunch. 

Manfriend had the chicken karage curry! Oh! It was very flavorful! It was our first time having Japanese curry too! A bit on the heavier side but really great if you&#39;re super duper hungry! Imo, the portion was quite generous! Chicken was tender and just soaked up the curry sauce nicely! Just yum! 

Staff were very helpful and super friendly! We did wait quite awhile for our food but it was packed that Friday night, so understandable. No sign in front!! It&#39;s tiny and wedged between buildings. Also, don&#39;t walk from downtown to here. Our stupid asses did that and thank god nothing happened, but it was dumb move on our part. Rather be safe than sorry. Yes we did get lost looking for it and thank god (again) for its tininess that there was a line outside. 

When I come back to Seattle, you&#39;ll definitely see me here enjoying a nice bowl of ramen! And salmon sashimi. :) 

Enjoy! :)"

Servers were young and a little inexperienced. However, the lady who took our order was very prompt and helpful.

They ran out of a few items that we were hoping to get, including some items in our sashimi set. They told us that they would either substitute with a seasonal fish or add extra pieces of what was included. The sashimi set had 16 pieces. The sizes of the pieces were average, yet the fish was fresh. I would&#39;ve liked the dish more if it didn&#39;t have clams and octopus.

This place is so good. I wasn&#39;t very hungry but since I made a reservation a week earlier I came. Half way through the meal I told chef I was full and he asked if I was sure I wanted to stop. He said it only gets better and he was right. I was full but kept eating. I was really impressed with the quality of fish and his creativity. The fatty toro melted in my mouth I enjoyed everything.

Anyway, above is the pitch that I deliver to anyone that is thinking of going to Tsukushinbo.  Originally introduced to this place by a Japanese friend, I only knew of this place as the place with no sign across the street from Fuji Sushi.  After coming here a few times, I am officially a fan and encourage you to be one as well.  Going to this place makes me feel like I&#39;m back in Japan with the sushi chefs, the servers speaking in Japanese, and seeing the homestyle Japanese cooking.  Below is some advice if you are a first-timer to Tsukushinbo:

1) MAKE A RESERVATION!  Even if it&#39;s on a weeknight, if you don&#39;t make a reservation prepare to wait about 45 minutes---that is, unless you are going there by yourself and don&#39;t mind sitting at the bar area, which is another element that makes it feel very Nippon-ish

2) Lunch specials on the weekdays are pretty good!  They are usually a set and so include miso soup, salad, and gyoza (potstickers).  I did try the Friday&#39;s ramen special, which tastes good---however, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that worth it waiting in line for, and I don&#39;t understand why Tsukushinbo doesn&#39;t sell it on other days as well.

3) The cooked fish dishes here are SO GOOD!  Specifically, I liked the boiled mackerel with shio (salt) and another fish dish that is glazed with miso sauce.  Also, it&#39;s not fish, but the squid rings have a good texture and are pretty flavorful.

4) The sashimi and sushi here are alright.  Nothing special with them to be honest.  I&#39;ve heard of friends getting uni (sea urchin) here, so maybe next time I&#39;ll try that.

Hopefully I&#39;ve convinced you that this place is worth trying!  And oh yeah, this place does not have a sign out front saying &#34;Tsukushinbo,&#34; but that&#39;s not an excuse to not go!"

not to disagree with so many seattle-ites, but this ramen is just ok.  i&#39;m coming from LA, where there are hundreds of great authentic ramen shops with fresh noodles, tasty homemade broths, and delicious ingredients.  and this didn&#39;t measure up.  

it&#39;s a great deal $10 for ramen, 3 gyoza and a bowl of rice. but i doubt i would wait in a ridiculous line for it, if given the option.

no comment on the sushi b/c we didn&#39;t have any.
service was good.
street parking.
nowhere to wait except outside, unless you are lucky to sit in one of the 3 seats in a corner right by the door."

Unmarked and light on design, this smashing value of a snug lunch spot delivers the real deal. But you&#39;ve got to arrive by 11:30 to join the line for a seat. Top marks on the temper, sashimi, and rolls. Highly recommended."

But luckily we put our names in just in time to enjoy the Shoyu ramen, which comes with 3 gyoza and white rice.  CAUTION: don&#39;t order anything else if you&#39;re getting the lunch special!  We were ambitious and got the white kabuto roll (it just jumped off the page, and might as well have something crunchy) which we&#39;ll be enjoying for dinner later.

This place is just wonderful for trying something new (and dare I say authentic).  When we came for my birthday dinner we got geoduck, which was beyond fresh and delightfully chewy.  Be sure to make a res, or arrive 15+ minutes before they open (we got there 10 mins in advance and they were already serving)."

To my disappointment, they sold out right when My friends and I got to the entrance.  This time we got in line around 11:15, which got us the last open table for their first round of customers.  It took about 30 minutes for our food to come out, which made sense because of the high volume of orders put in as soon as they opened.

We ordered the Shoyu ramen + gyoza + rice lunch special with a side of tempura.  Other than the ramen being a bit on the salty side, everything was delicious and tasted very authentic.  I will be back again!!"

But literally 3 out of the 4 orders we wanted to try were out. We decided to be adventurous and try some of the chefs specials but they were honestly not that great. I really enjoyed the uni ponzu though. My girlfriend thought otherwise. She thought the shiso flavor was too overpowering. Nigiri was above average. Spent around $75 for two and left pretty full.

Got chicken teriyaki, salmon teriyaki and a katsu don bowl. We came for ramen but learned the hard way that they only have ramen on Fridays for lunch. Why oh why!?!? Anyway, the katsu in the bowl was soggy but flavorful. The overall dish was odd to me, I was expecting crunchy katsu but I guess not. The teriyaki dishes were good enough.

We also shared a spicy tuna roll and that was pretty spicy but decent for sushi.

The place is really small and barely has any signs. It&#39;s all in Japanese so you may not even know you arrived. 

All in all a good meal but I wish they had ramen!! I was craving it!!"

Cons: long wait as a result of a recent viral video on facebook

I went with a group of friends to check out the super bowl challenge - 4 orders of extra large Pho in one bowl. We determined that no regular human would be able to succeed at the challenge because there is so much broth. The broth was rich, beef was tender, and the noodles exceptional. The noodles however weren&#39;t the traditional Pho noodles you&#39;d expect. I definitely recommend checking it out if you like Pho."

I come here for their brisket! not their noodles. their brisket! 
Their noodles are different from the classic pho noodles, and I believe its a preference thing. My own preference.. is the originial classic noodles.. so i&#39;m actually not a fan of dong thap noodles.. but their meat well compensates for that :)

The wait is super long, so i advise to either come around 3-4PM, or make a reservations. A little bit on the pricier side.. but if you come with friends.. you can do multiple bowls.. in ONE GIANT SUPER BOWL.. and split cost.. or preorder the super bowl for $45 and split with 4-6 ppl easily. 

Man this place is so aromatic! :)
I like their service too. But just a bit on the slow end."

Dong Thap Noodles got extremely lucky with their viral video hitting Facebook and the rest of the interweb. So I decided to jump on the hype train. After completing the Seattle Marathon that morning, my finishing trophy had to be a super bowl of pho. 

The establishment is in the busier part of the International District---Yesler Terrace area. The restaurant is on the small scale, just like your standard typical Vietnamese hole-in-the-wall. 

Every ingredient in their highly acclaimed pho was top-notch.
 -Fresh noodles
 -Flavorful broth
 -Tender brisket
 -Tasty seafood

Although, bigger is never always better. Surprisingly the taste was not diminished one bit by the larger amount of ingredients needed to quantify a super bowl. 

So why the 3 out of 5 stars? 
x No reservations = long wait, little to no waiting area if I must add
x Some of the cups/glasses were not properly sanitized
x The utensils, although new, still had residue from the sticker that was removed
x We got our straws after the third time asking our server,. We opted for straws because the cups were not cleaned as previously mentioned.

Dong Thap definitely gets an oishii award for one of the better phos around the Seattle metro."

By then, 2 more parties had been seated and 2 more were waiting. 
Boyfriends&#39; pho came out and I waited about 10 more minutes before my noodles came out, but we weren&#39;t in a rush.

Legends also stated that the noodles are freshly hand made everyday. I&#39;m one that is into hype places and would give it a try just to get a personal opinion on it myself. There&#39;s a pho challenge here where if you finish the super giant bowl of pho within 1.5 hours, you can $100 plus your meal for free otherwise it&#39;s $45 for the bowl. We found out that due to amount of bowls available in the store, you have to make an appointment ahead of time. There was no way any of us would finish that much pho, but we really wanted to take a picture with it so we ordered like 4 extra large size pho and asked them to put it in the challenge bowl for the picture&#39;s sake and then shared it among 4 people. Hahaha.

The pho itself was decent, but I might be biased since I&#39;m not a huge fan of pho to start with. I was honestly there more for the hype. The homemade noodles were tender, it&#39;s good, but not enough difference for me to go out of my way if I&#39;m ever craving pho. There&#39;s other Vietnamese dishes here also if you don&#39;t want pho, but I haven&#39;t had a chance to try it yet.

-Pho has a few different sizes, the biggest has been featured in many publications.
-Their lemonade is sweet and lovely.
-The pho has a rich broth, very good stuff. The homemade fresh noodles make it stand out.

Might be the next big thing for pho due to the recent online buzz around it. Lived up to the hype for me."

A hungry and wide-open mouth awaits, ready to score a touchdown. This touchdown however, is no ordinary touchdown. This touchdown would be a game-winner, a game-changer, a legendary feat.

That&#39;s because this noodle is the last of an epic Super Bowl challenge, one that completely bends the laws of human food consumption. Dong Thap Noodles&#39; Super Bowl Challenge is the challenge at stake, and it consists of finishing four LITERS of broth along with an unthinkable four pounds of meat and four pounds of belly-saturating noodles in 90 minutes.

Dong Thap boasts fresh, in-house noodles that are prepared daily and trust me... the difference is anything but subtle. The wait can be excruciatingly long, but if you&#39;re a die-hard pho fanatic, it can be quite worth it. These noodles are truly to die for, and if I was a cat I would gladly give up 4 or 5 of my lives to try the pho here."

We heard about the hype before the hype, so we called right at 10AM when opening while we were on our way there (: called and ask the gal over the phone if we could reserve 2 super bowl. The lady asked if we are doing the challenge or just wanting to share. We let her know we wanted to share and she accommodated us over the phone that we could do that. 

We got there a few minutes after 10 no line at all, was quickly seated. The smell is what woke me up. The raw meat smell was not the business - I&#39;m sure some people stomachs can&#39;t hang with that smell but once the cooking in the kitchen started the smell went away. Idk open the doors or something to air out that smell. 

We did wait for our food but with fresh noodles and broth I&#39;m sure it takes time. By the time we did get our food their was a line. 

Now my rating on the noodle was 5 stars for that! Very fresh &amp; the broth. I got the pho tai x large bowl &amp; finished like a champ. A pho spot that makes fresh noodles and broth is cooked for days tells you a lot. I seen a review I believe Lisa from Cali mentioned garden grove pho better, (chuckles) um maybe you meant Westminster area bc I&#39;ve tasted garden grove area and it&#39;s not as good as this spot trust me hunty! 

Is waiting in line worth it? Nope just plan smart! Come a few minutes before they open wait at the door and you should be one of the first in the doors. Seattle and Washington alone has zillion of pho spots but if you&#39;re only coming here for the super bowl challenge then plan accordingly. Read the tips and reviews and plan ahead, simple! 

If I ever have family out of town visiting and it&#39;s a cold rainy weekend I&#39;ll plan to come back and order the super bowl to share lol I&#39;ll definitely be back for the freshness!"

The food is uniquely solid, the price is justifiably higher than normal, yet the service is extraordinarily slow.   And I mean remarkably slow at all levels. So I&#39;m not even mad I&#39;ve passed this place many times without giving it a second thought prior to their exposure on buzzfeed. We came in for the super bowl challenge (Not football).

To our dismay we found out the hard way; the $45 super bowl of fresh noodles and four pounds of meat we yearned after from the promo video was sadly only by appointment, AFTER waiting over an hour in line outside (that&#39;s no exaggeration). Sigh. Only to be seated and not be greeted with so much as waters or even a menu for the next 10 minutes until we angrily demanded service. We sat for another 10 minutes before drink and food orders were taken. Only for our three bowls to arrive at our table a whopping 35 minutes after ordering. That&#39;s nearly two hours here without food. Insane. 

I&#39;ve never expected good service from an Asian restaurant, but at least my food gets thrown on my table faster than you can blink. I&#39;ll let you guys in on a secret, turning those tables faster and moving through that line might make more money. All that aside, I was really impressed with the very modern atmosphere some of us might not be used to in a Pho restaurant. 

The FOOD however, if they managed to figure out their service time was exceptionally unique. I&#39;d come back on a weekday where I wouldn&#39;t have to wait. The noodles are certainly a highlight as it is very different. We had the bun bo hue, Pho dac biet (house special) and the Pho Bo (beef). All of it, eye rolling to back of your head good. You can taste all the flavors and spices that go into the brother and the freshness of the noodles. 

I&#39;m excited to come back and try some of the other dishes."

I ordered a small pho with meatballs and steak. Warning: It is ACTUALLY a small size lol. It filled me up more than I anticipated, though! I really liked the homemade noodles, weren&#39;t too mushy and just the right amount of chewy. It was very reminiscent of the noodles I&#39;ve had in Vietnam. Meatballs and steak were tender and juicy, not dried up like other pho restaurants.

I thought the broth could use a little more flavor. I found myself drenching it in condiments, which I don&#39;t typically like to do.

Spring rolls are just with shrimp. I usually like it with Vietnamese ham/pork as well. But that&#39;s just my preference.

Service was alright. They were kinda busy on a Monday night, had 2 servers though &amp; I had to ask for water :| 

I think Dong Thap has a lot of potential. Likely will return later to try the rice dishes and vermicelli bowls! I would like to see more appetizers on the menu!"

I could imagine myself coming often if I lived close by.

The noodles were the star - definitely have a little bit more bite than your typical rice noodles, which is really nice. You can tell the noodles are fresh and made in-house.  I got the vermicelli bowl (bun thit nuong cha gio).  It felt very fresh and was delicious.  The bowl is a great portion size.

I live down the street, so I figured why not try this out with another one of my foodie friends to get a holistic take? 

FOOD: 3/5
I came with high hopes and was excited to try their pho. I ordered a small House Special and was underwhelmed. The bowl was very small and came with a single piece of each type of meat (including a sliver of a meatball). The homemade noodles were very good though. I feel like that the noodles is what sets the place apart. I liked the broth at first. It was definitely very rich; however, even with my small bowl, I was left with a salty aftertaste. 
My dining partner tried the Seafood Udon. There were caramelized onions floating in the broth, which she, too, said was delicious at first and after a while we realized it was quite salty. She liked the udon noodles and said that the texture was there. The variety of seafood in her bowl looked pretty good, too. 

LOCATION: 3/5
I am not a huge fan of the location of this place. It is on a major street and the parking is hard to come by. The area isn&#39;t extremely well-lit and it isn&#39;t super easy to find. Because it is not in a shopping area, you could miss it and then have to re-route. 

AMBIANCE: 3/5
The restaurant is clean and the furniture is modern. Clear plastic chairs and glass table tops are nice. It is bright and kind of reminds me of the ambiance I get from going to Yogurtland if you can relate. Green tiled walls and nice white, clean walls and floors. Because this location&#39;s increased popularity because of social media attention, the seating has become tight leading to a rather uncomfortable dining experience. 

SERVICE: 3/5
While waiting to be seated, I was served a mini bottle of water, which was a very nice gesture. However, after being seated, the service experience was just mediocre.

PRICE: 3/5
I usually rate price on two criteria: justification of price based on the food and justification of price based on experience. i do not think that the price of their pho is necessarily justified. I got quite a small bowl of pho and paid about $9.00. The circumference of the bowl was about the size of my hand."

Preamble- on Monday of this week, my wife and I get tagged in this video describing the word&#39;s largest bowl of Pho and it happens to be Seattle. Well we are visiting Seattle this weekend and I had to make this a stop because I am a Pho/noodleaholic. I read three articles describing the bowl and was set on enjoying my weight in broth. 

Fast forward to today: 

Service- 1star- we waited about 10 mins to get seated which was no big deal cause they were pretty busy. However, after being seated we were ignored for another 15 mins before my wife asked if we could put in our order. The waiter comes over and I order my Pho bowl and he replies that it&#39;s by appointment only!!!  Totally broke my heart. After ordering , it took 30 mins to get our food, but not before they dropped it off at the wrong table! They then realized the mistake and brought the  food from the wrong table to our table. Smh 

Food- 4 stars -egg rolls were crispy and flavorful. $4.50 for 2 is a little $$. But they were solid. I went ahead and got the XLarge bowl of beef Pho and it was pretty damn tasty. The noodles are by far the best part. Thick and long.  The broth is flavorful and the spice red sauce at the table kicks it up a notch. 

Overall I would go back just to try the Pho Challenge &amp; the noodles, but I would expect rough service."

My friend isn&#39;t big on adding the sauces and sriracha, so he found it a disappointment that the soup is so bland that he needed to add them. I, on the other hand, love adding the hoisin sauce and sriracha, so the soup tasted delicious to me. I can believe that their noodles are fresh and handmade, because it is different from the typical pho places. However, we both agreed that we liked the regular noodles more than we liked Dong Thap&#39;s, just because theirs stuck together in chunks.

Even Waze couldn&#39;t find the address. Can&#39;t read any of the store signs on the street... (I&#39;m exaggerating.)

Oh! I it is so good! The pho is great. The meat is raw. The broth is complex. The noodles are homemade, thick and perfectly al dente, and NOT stuck together in a big clump like most pho places. 

I could eat this every day.

An added bonus is the street parking just to the right of the building."

There was already a line (to be expected)bc their FB &#34;famous&#34; now. There&#39;s no structure as to where to line up or write your name down or even being acknowledged. We just ask people waiting if this was the line and followed. Be ready to WAIT. You would think once your seated the food comes out a little faster? NOT. 

We ordered the Bun Bo Hue... The broth was lacking depth of flavors,very bland. Not enough lemon grass either.
The Pho Tai and brisket- The broth was a little better( to much star anise). The steak was very tender and enjoyable. The brisket was cut to thick and chewy. 

The noodles you could def taste the freshness which we enjoyed. Would be come back to wait which seemed like forever for mediocre pho?! Prob not. They definitely need some tips on organizing the flow of people coming in waiting to be seated and how to direct customers."

No... this is not the &#34;Superbowl&#34;... we ordered the Large tonight to try. The broth is good. Their pho comes with their handmade house noodles. It&#39;s thicker and the texture is a bit rounded (not round like spaghetti). I like the noodles. You don&#39;t get much meat if you are a meat lover, but you could pay $2.50 for extra meat. How much more meat do they give you I have no idea. 

We arrived at 5:40pm. We had to wave down the sever to place an order. He came by and said they don&#39;t take orders till 6pm. What?!?!?! (Hours 10am to 9pm) By 5:55pm all the tables were full and there was a line of people waiting to be seated. We were all waiting to place our order and to be served at the same time. There is only one server for the entire place. He was slow and did not know how to communicate He didn&#39;t start taking orders until 6:07pm. 

The whole situation was just weird... so far our first impression of the food is ok/good. The service was lacking and the front of the house was very disorganized. By the time we left we were underwhelmed by the whole experience...."

Homemade chewy noodles floating in earthy, beefy broth alongside fresh veggies and lime wedges. The menu is straight to the point and represents their specialty very well...EVERYTHING NOODLES HERE! Fresh pho, vermicelli, and banh canh. They offer different sized portions ranging from small to XXL bowl. I usually stick to medium which is actually a large size compared to most VN rest restaunts.

Mom ordered the Bun Bo Hue Tai (steak) and I ordered the Bun Bo Hue Dac Biet (House Special) and my sister ordered the Banh Canh Hai San (seafood &#39;udon&#39; noodle soup).

My mom&#39;s basically said she wouldn&#39;t come here again because her food was really salty and my sister didn&#39;t really like hers because it was really watery. Too much broth to the noodles. 

I, on the other hand, loved my food! It was really good and had a good amount of spice to it. I like mine really spicy, so I did add more to it. I love that their noodles are made fresh and in house. I just about ate my whole bowl, including the broth! I normally order bun bo hue without the pig&#39;s feet/knuckle.

Would definitely come back again!"

I saw this on Buzzfeed and in an article about the best places to get various asian cuisine in Seattle and knew I had to check it out on a trip home.  Nothing beats noodle soup on a cold rainy fall day! I have to say the noodles are fresh but it&#39;s barely noticeable compared to other noodle places that don&#39;t use fresh noodles.  What makes the dish isn&#39;t the noodle but the broth.  I got the bun bo hue and it was good - very nice herbs and flavors in the broth.  I would come back here but I can&#39;t say I would crave it all the time cause it didn&#39;t amaze me.  It was definitely good and no one can argue against fresh made noodles.

Fresh noodles?? Check!!! Super pretty décor? Check check! Clean, bright spot with awesome staff?? Triple check!! And tastiness that is all things pho and bun bo hue?? Ok fine: check x check x check galore!!

Coming here during lunch time is not easy task but come evening, it is as easy as going for a walk on April 25th. Cause you know: it&#39;s a perfect day. Not too hot, not too cold. No lines! Walk right in! All you need is a light sweater a huge bowl of pho :D 

Bun bo hue is all I came here for but the pho totally won me over too!!! And that MASSIVE bowl challenge?? I can never do it in this life time but I&#39;ll be sure to pump someone up and talk them into doing it. Just so I can document the monstrosity of that huge bowl! HUGEEEEE!

Ok so back to bun bo hue! It is super tasty! Earthy and all that niceness with a side of spice! I got noodles on the side ( mini bowl). Totally getting a full order of noodles next time! They are just so good. XL bowl of BBH will run you about $11 and it is just so big! I ate till I&#39;m full up to my brain and seriously: didn&#39;t make a dent. Ended up taking 90% of the bowl to go!! Hello, leftovers!! 

The combo pho: this one is surprisingly amazing. I love how chewy and al dente the noodles are. Stole this dish and almost didn&#39;t give back :D Sharing is caring you know!! :P

Those noodles though!!! Menu is short and sweet. They got the usual: vermicelli, pho, specialty soups aka bun bo hueeeeeeeeeeeeee and drinks. Their coffee is super strong. Thanks KB!!! Family that owns and work here is super nice. And they remember me by my order! How cool is that??! It is rare to find such a pretty spot in Chinatown but this one is pretty! And clean!! They do them well too! Highlights being their amazing noodles!! Where else can you find that???! Hmmm, fresh noodles!!!"

We ended up getting the Udon soup with chicken, shrimp, and fishballs. The shrimp tasted great and so fresh! The broth was okay, could have been a bit more flavorful though. 

I also liked the restaurant itself. From the outside you might question it, most particularly cause you can see a dog chilling in the kitchen... But inside it&#39;s really nice, clean, and modern.

We can on a Friday night, the place was all packed, waited for 20 mins to get seated. The waiter asked if we can sit with other two people in a four people table. We said no because we just didn&#39;t want to. 

After we placed our order and kindly asked for two ice water, our water didn&#39;t arrive after we asked two more times. Our food didn&#39;t arrive for a very long long long time. The table next to us actually left after one of them finished their food, they couldn&#39;t stay any longer to wait for the rest of their food. While we were waiting for our food, a customer came to us asking if we could change our table because they had a bigger group, I was fine with it but, really, who was working there, why was the customers the one who came asking???

To add to this, we overheard a group of people close to us, they didn&#39;t have utensils on their table, so they asked the waiter &#34;there&#39;s no utensils on the table, are we eating with our hands?&#34; The waiter cursed at the lady who said so. WOW

After waiting for an hour, I would expect something exceptional and amazing. Oppositely, this place is a huge disappointment. Fresh noodle??? Meh more like noodle that stays outside in the most hated place in the kitchen. 

I have a bun bo hue, the broth????? There is a difference in spicy broth and broth that just being dumped in a ton of chili sate. Seriously, BUZZFEED is taking people here with the false advertising and description. 
My others friend have Pho, one of them ordered a small size. Well, I give them this, no false description for this. It is extremely small like my 2 years old cousin soup bowl at home.

Pho broth: it is not the worst, but nothing special. I say pho bac down the street is better. 

Noodle is good. I like that is it not over cooked and that it is fresh.

Spicy beef noodle soup: not worth ordering.

We came in when the restaurant is not even full still waited over a hour without even seeing our food.

Their noodles are undeniably unique since they make them in-house. The noodles taste good and are fun to eat.
The Pho Dac Biet broth is absolutely flavorful! I had the XL Bowl since I couldn&#39;t do the Pho Challenge (Pho Challenges are BY APPOINTMENT ONLY! - 2 days in advance they said).

Advice - don&#39;t get the Spring Rolls - they were plain and horribly wrapped.

My dissatisfaction comes in with their customer service, here&#39;s why:
- With overwhelming popularity from that Buzzfeed video we saw, you would expect them to have TRAINED their employees properly in order to handle huge volume. Their staff were not properly trained.
- Staff members lacked a sense of urgency. I&#39;m not saying they should&#39;ve been running around the restaurant (because that does more harm than good), however, tables shouldn&#39;t have been left uncleaned for more than 10 minutes. If you have a line out of the door, and your restaurant is small in size, you need to get your tables cleaned as soon as a patron leaves.
- When getting to my table, we were handed menus. We sat and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came to us and asked if we were ready to order. At a pho restaurant with a Vietnamese customer - you don&#39;t need 15 minutes to decide. You order when you sit because you know what you want. If we waited for 15 minutes, people who haven&#39;t been seated yet have to tackle on additional time to get seated because the service is too slow.
- I received my XL Pho Dac Biet bowl - with no spoon. None of my colleagues received a spoon either. Not only that, the table next to us (we don&#39;t know who they were but they were a family of 3) didn&#39;t receive a spoon either and they had a different server.

UPDATE:
After I posted this I read everyone else&#39;s review - this place is consistent with poor customer service. They need better training."

My husband had the house special pho and he was very disappointed with it. I had the Bun Bo Hue and it was decent.  The fresh noodles were the only good part of the dishes.

Easy parking on the side of the building was a big plus.  Restaurant itself was bright, clean, nice and open.  Service was fast for me as a solo diner but I noticed that for the larger group of 8 next to me, it took a significantly longer time to get menus, have their orders taken, tea given, etc.  The servers are young and maybe a bit inexperienced but they&#39;re friendly and bilingual.  

I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and it was pretty good!  Noodles had a good texture and broth w/ all the fixings was flavorful (order the &#39;dac biet&#39; to get the pork knuckle and pork blood chunks) -- I just wish it was spicier but I eat pretty spicy and added some fresh Thai chili to fix that :)

I was surprised to see how high the prices were compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.  It was almost $17 w/ tax+tip for my med bowl of BBH and a can of soy milk.  I guess they figured they can charge those few extra dollars since they&#39;re serving up house-made fresh noodles but at that price point, it&#39;s probably the only reason I won&#39;t make it a weekly lunch option."

First impressions, the restaurant is cleaner than most places in the international district. But more importantly, the food:

Vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and egg roll: 4/5
I was a little disappointed that they didn&#39;t have a combination option (with pork, shrimp, chicken, egg roll, etc like most places), but settled with this option instead. The noodles were a little thinner than the regular vermicelli noodles, which surprisingly I really enjoyed!! They were really chewy and tasted almost similar to banh hoi, for those of you who are familiar. Aside from the noodles, the pork was nicely marinated, egg rolls were crispy and filling, and there was plenty of vegetables.

Pho: 3/5
I had a couple bites of this dish from my boyfriend who ordered it. The best part was the broth - it was hearty and had the right combo of spices. As other&#39;s have mentioned, the noodles are thicker in this dish and chopped shorter, which I personally wasn&#39;t a fan of. So I probably wouldn&#39;t get this again. However, they totally skimped on the vegetables!! They gave us like 2 pieces of mint &amp; basil, wth?? haha. I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I like to eat a bunch of veggies with my pho.

Overall, the food was good, but it&#39;s not THAT good to be so hyped up. However, I will most likely come back to try their bun bo hue. Is it one of the best vietnamese restaurants in Seattle? I&#39;m not convinced yet."

The handmade noodles are really good. I kind of like these better than the normal rice noodles because they don&#39;t stick together, and the length is shorter so it feels like a more satisfying bite. 

The broth has the right amount of salt. You may think that the small size is pretty small compared to other spots, but it&#39;s still worth trying it out.

They have a jumbo-sized bowl that costs like $40? If you finish it all, you get $100 or something. It&#39;s very huge... the owner was saying how someone only managed to finish 1/4 of it, so good luck if you&#39;re a huge pho eater.

Only down side is that this place doesn&#39;t have a parking lot... given all the construction going on nearby, it&#39;s pretty tough to find a street spot. Best bet is to sneakily park in the nearby lots and eat fast."

I think the restaurant is adjusting to the high volume of customers, so there&#39;s still a lot of work to be done on that end, but the service was great otherwise. They even handed out mini waters to everyone waiting. 

The pho! I&#39;m definitely no expert, but with pho being one of my favorite foods, I&#39;d best describe the broth having a heavy cinnamon-y type flavor and not as beefy as I usually like, but still good and comforting. Also, the handmade noodles were great in texture, I would comeback just for that.

Noodles are house made, which is the original appeal of this place, as opposed to the dried ones at regular spots. Vermicelli bowl was very good! The noodles def taste different than the normal ones at other places. Grilled chicken also good not too dry. There are also rice dishes, and a couple other noodle soups here. Medium pho was ~$9.

Being the adventurists that we are, my friend and I parked a few blocks away and then went &#34;Frogger&#34; as we crossed a couple of busy streets (we did not jaywalk!).  Usually I recognize the Chinese BBQ meat place a few doors down.

Dong Thap is relatively new: it is clean, has a cozy feel, and is family owned.  There&#39;s always this nostalgic feel when you see Asian kids at the corner doing their homework lol.  There is also a large TV inside with a football game going on, so you know the owners are Seahawks fans.  

The menu has your typical Vietnamese dishes: the pho, the rice dishes, and the non-pho noodle dishes.  I went for the Bun Bo Hue Special (Dac Biet) and chose the large size because there is only a $1 difference between that size and the smaller one so why not.  The Bun Bo Hue is pretty legit I&#39;d have to say --- plenty of flavor and ingredients inside, including the pig trotters (which the wife was kind enough to tell me that pig trotters were in there when I initially tried to order it), coagulated pork blood, and cured pork, to name a few.  The broth was not that spicy but that was fine.

We also got egg rolls --- 2 for 4 bucks.  Piping hot when I bit into it and comes with the sweet and spicy sauce.  I like that it&#39;s not oily unlike other Chinese establishments that make their extra oily and greasy.

Apparently if you go up to the front where the cashier is, you&#39;ll see they have the &#34;Bun Bo Hue&#34; challenge.  Similar to the ramen challenge at Kukai, you have a certain amount of time to devour the gigantic sized Bun Bo Hue (see picture below and compare the large ass bowl with my hand) and if you succeed the owner gives you $100 cash.  You also get bragging rights, which I guess is worth just as much as the cash.  I will pass on this challenge given that I&#39;ll probably barf back into the bowl what I consume.  Gross.

Side note: the owners are originally from Portland and his parents&#39; house is just a few minutes drive away from mine!  Talk about small world!!"

For a Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown, I thought the service was GREAT, and better than other restaurants in the neighborhood. Someone greeted us right away, took our orders, and the orders came out quickly.

I loved my small bowl of pho (P8 steak, flank, and brisket)! I loved that the meat was good quality, especially with the brisket being pretty thick cut - at least thicker cut than any Than Brothers joint. I thought the broth was flavorful, and the only critique I would have is to have more onions (but I really, really love onions in like every bite). The noodles were awesome! I believe the width cut is actually more traditional than the vermicelli noodles, and definitely thought it was so delicious. I thought the fresh noodles were a noticeable difference to the usual dried noodles. 

The spring rolls also had carrots in them. Initially I didn&#39;t think I would like that, but it was a nice crunch in contrast to the softer noodles.

Overall I can&#39;t wait to come back! I grew up with pho, and have never EVER been over the moon with a restaurant pho, and I honestly can&#39;t stop thinking about it!"

Dong Thap is located in a little strip mall on 12th and the closest parking is on a small side street just before the restaurant, so keep your eyes peeled as you approach. It can be a pain to find parking in the ID, but it&#39;s worth the effort.

Inside, the restaurant is very clean, modern, and bright. I&#39;m used to dingy Chinatown mom-and-pop hole-in-the-walls, but this place is nice enough to bring your parents. Personally, I&#39;m not a big fan of the glass tabletops and plastic chairs, but it&#39;s obviously part of a deliberate effort to look updated and fresh, and it does have that ambiance. 

I came in for a very late lunch and was almost the only person eating in. It looks like they do a fair amount of takeout business, and a couple of people came in to pick up orders who seemed like regulars. I ordered the grilled shrimp and pork vermicelli bowl, which came out very quickly and included four juicy shrimp, a generous portion of pork, plus all the usual toppings and sauce. To be honest, I wasn&#39;t blown away by the famous noodles -- not that they weren&#39;t good, because they WERE. Thanks to all the hype, I think I was expecting some magical, mind-blowing experience, but, you know, they were just tasty, fresh noodles. Nothing wrong with that.

Service was friendly and fast. I heard the cook chatting with a takeout customer, and my server was attentive and sweet. On my second visit, the owner recognized me as having been there before! 

I love to get pho to go as comfort food when I&#39;m feeling sick, and I would definitely come back to try the pho. A nice, convenient place for a quick lunch or easy takeout dinner -- or to pick up some fresh noodles for your own home cooking."

The broth was so salty. Parking is horrible. Service was not that great either. I would not recommended.

I suggested it to our Pho Club and nine of us headed to the I.D. to check this new place out. We were greeted warmly at the door by a cheerful server wearing a lovely green áo dài, the Vietnamese national costume. We were showed to our table, already set with chopsticks and soup spoons. 

After we ordered, our server brought us condiment caddies and side dishes of fresh veg for the pho. Two people ordered spicy beef noodles and their fresh veg included delectable banana flowers! One of the vegetarians in our group ended up asking for a dish off menu and the owner was very accommodating with her dietary preferences. 

When the food arrived, the conversation trickled to silence. Everyone slurped happily and raved about the freshness of the noodles. My bún bò was spectacular and I relished each bite. My husband loved his spicy beef noodles with wonderfully oily broth. After demolishing their pho, several of my friends declared &#34;best they&#39;d ever had&#34; and were glad they opted for extra noodles.

Pausing to talk about those homemade noodles - delicate and wonderfully sticky without clumping together. The pho noodles were wider than usual. If you prefer the thinner variety, let the server know when you order.  If you fall in love with those noodles, you can buy them for later use for less than $2 per pound. 

The interior was very clean and brightly lit. Murals of cherry blossoms, dandelions, birds, and butterflies adorned the walls. One wall proudly proclaimed &#34;I LOVE NOODLES!&#34; beside a bowl with chopsticks. They had no problem splitting our cheques and before we left, the owner gave each of us a small bag of Kirkland fruit snacks! 

There are 4-5 steps at the entrance of the restaurant which makes them fully unaccessible. Parking was a little headachy because of the street construction but that&#39;s no fault of the business. I&#39;d recommend carpooling if you can. We lucked out and found a spot less than a block away but everyone else ended up near Tamarind Tree, walking over. 

Dong Thap easily scored five stars from me and I&#39;d give them six if I could. The hype is real. Check them out before the rest of Seattle discovers this gem!"

The restaurant is clean and new and somewhat comfortable. The layout of the store reminds me more of a teriyaki place then a Vietnamese restaurant but it works.

Everything you&#39;ve heard about the noodles being fresh is true, made daily. I had a vermicelli bowl and I was really impressed with the taste that the fresh noodles bring when you bite in to them, it really makes a difference. However, the pork I had in my bowl tasted like a teriyaki restaurants pork and the shrimp wasn&#39;t to perfection either. The greens and vegetables in the bowl were fresh but plain, there was some flavor elements lacking.

In other words I would come here again and I would definitely get their noodles that you can buy by the pound to go. However, I probably prefer a couple of other Vietnamese restaurants around the city that make everything else in their vermicelli bowls better besides the noodles. 

The Vietnamese couple sitting next to me said they were enjoying their Pho so thats a good sign.

The spring rolls were hot and fresh as well which always helps but were a little expensive."

It was very highly recommended in the article but after dining here I can safely say it is overhyped and underdelivered in so many ways. With so many Pho places in Washington I will take business elsewhere. In addition to the underwhelming food, the customer service is beyond horrible (one of the worst I have encountered actually). This was definitely not a isolated incident as while I was dining, I saw 2 families walk out due to rude service or just ridiculous wait times for their food that was never delivered while their families had received and finished theirs. I have never seen so many pissed off tables of people in one restaurant, including myself. 

Things that resulted in pissed off customers:
1)One of the waiters had the nerve to curse at one of the customers for asking for utensils that were missing. And when confronted he got even more angry.
2)Some tables received part of their orders while some people at the tables never received their orders till everyone else finished. 
3)Asking for utensils 3, 4, sometimes even 5 times and the waiter acknowledging but never delivering. 
4)Tables that were seated 40 minutes in advance did not receive their orders until after people who had just been seated and ordered. And yes both were the exact same items.
5)Waiters asking other customers to kick people out of their seats to move to another table rather than the waiter asking. 

The list can continue but my thumbs are getting tired typing this on my phone so I will leave it at that. One word of advice: AVOID!"

Service was a little slow and the waitresses seem a little flustered. It took a while even for water to get on the table - only after I asked. I got the banh canh (udon) which of course had thicker noodles. The soup base was bomb. The noodles - I was slightly disappointed. It could be that it was the last batch (since we were one of the last customers) or because of its thickness, but it was a bit too hard for my liking. I like my udon noodles chewy but with a bite to it, and this did not deliver. My friends however, were slurping away at their pho and claiming it the best they&#39;ve ever had. 

Last week I visited again with Helena N. and 2 other girlfriends. This time I got the meatball and steak pho which was exactly what I needed to soothe my sore throat. There was no wait this time around on a Friday evening, and the service was fast. The noodles I had this time around were exactly what I was hoping for. They are a bit wider than the average packaged pho noodles, but it was refreshing to bite into a different kind of noodle. The broth and the meat were very tasty as well. 

Both times we were greeted by a woman who seems like the owner at the counter and she is always inquisitive about how we liked the meal. She&#39;s very friendly and I also appreciate the Costco fruit snacks they offer as we are paying lol."

The noodles for the pho are homemade. 4sizes sm, med, lg, Xlg, and a challenge size ( which is obnoxiously huge and free if you can finish. Otherwise, $40!)

I like the light flavor and anise broth for my pho.

They are making them fresh 3 or 4 times a week to supply Supermarket, Restaurant and their customers.
I went here for the 1st time yesterday and tried their Pho dat biet and it was delicious. You can taste the freshness of the noodle as soon as you put it in your mouth. I could not wait to write a review and rave about this new restaurant. When you dine here you can even buy their fresh noodles to bring home. Here is a list of their Bun selling in the restaurant by pound. (Gluten Free)

Banh Pho (Pho Noodle) 2 different kind
Banh Canh (Udon Noodle)
Bun Bo (Used for Spicy Hue Noodle)
Regular Bun (Used for Bun Rieu, Bun Moc, Bun Mang or Vermicelli - bun thit nuong)
Pad Thai Noodle
This restaurant only been opened for little over 4 months but already been on numerous newspapers like (Seattle Met, Seattle Times, Seattle Weekly, EthnicSeattle, Seattle Refined also made the list for Top 20 new cheap eats for 2016).
The service is good and they are really busy so be patient. I will come back again for sure and try different items on their menu like (Bun Bo Que, Banh Canh, Hu Tieu, Special Rice Dishes and Bun Thit Nuong). They even have Superbowl challenge so if you can finish their superbowl you will win $100 dollar. They located across from Seattle Deli so parking is a little hard to find but you must give this place a try. So what are you waiting for get in your car and drive there and try their wonderful dishes."

I had the opportunity to test out the pho here and i definitely would recommend that you come for the noodles. They had a pretty extensive menu including bun bo hue, some dry noodle dishes and your usual pho. 

I think the pho broth wasn&#39;t really to my liking. More sour that what I normally like but I guess there is probably a wide variance of how pho broth is made. Didn&#39;t have a chance to try other dishes but will surely make my way back to test out other ones.

You can also buy noodles alone to make dishes at home. Pretty good deal too and comparable to buying the noodles at the supermarket. Of course the market won&#39;t ever be as fresh as these noodles."

the place is open and airy, but it sure gets hot inside.  the glass front absorbs all the sun and makes it boil inside.  not sure hot pho and a hot eating area is the best combo, but whatevs.

i though the pho was okay.  the hand made noodles can be an attraction but i&#39;m more about the broth.  nothing stood out to me and i thought it was just another place to land if i find parking or am  in the area.

the super bowl....i had to ask about it.   it&#39;s huge!  only one person has come close and took out the fixings and the noodles, but when it in came to the broth...no mas.   he started in and then the noodles absorbed the broth in his stomach and wham!  big belly nelly!   i think santa must come here in the off season to keep up his figure."

While the cha gio was good albeit overpriced, the pork/shrimp bun was ok. The bun bo hue was meh at best - pork blood was way over cooked, the pork knuckle and sinew under cooked, the shank was ok, the broth chock full of yummy lemongrass but lukewarm in temperature (not as tasty as being served piping hot which should be the norm).

I got pho and a friend got bun bo hue. The fresh noodles are thicker and taste different because of the thickness, but it was good! It&#39;s not too chewy but not too soft (which I was afraid of). I still need to get used to it. 

I tasted the BBH and the noodles were good too! But I think the broth at Hoang Lan is more tasty.

Probably by someone&#39;s grandmother. I&#39;m not sure about that part. But the noodles are really good! They are fresh and never dried. You will notice that they&#39;re softer and smoother in consistency. They almost melt in your mouth. Other noodle restaurants using dried, packaged noodles just can&#39;t compete. 

The veggie pho is also top quality and has loads of fresh vegetables. I judge pho quality by the vegetables added, since that is the most expensive ingredient. 

The tofu curry vermicelli bowl was our favorite dish. The flavor was amazing, combined with fresh noodles and a more fresh vegetables than an average American eats in a week. Super good. Super healthy."

Staff was accommodating to our group and the food was fresh and delicious; my whole party thoroughly enjoyed their dishes, stating how fresh their spring rolls and vermicelli bowls were. My medium pho was plentiful with meat and the handmade noodles- the shape in the pho is different from the vermicelli noodles but just as good. Very soft and the right amount of chewy.

I personally like my broth to be a little bit more &#34;clean&#34; if that makes sense (better to sip on). 

My husband ordered the Hu Tieu Dac Biet (House special clear rice noodle soup). The broth was a bit different from all the typical Hu Tieu. It wasn&#39;t as meaty and flavorful as I would like to be.

My brother got the Bun Bo Hue, which in my humble opinion was overly sweet and lacked fragrance and depth. 

The establishment is lacking in their operation. They are quite busy for a small place and have very little staff. In addition, the staff are young and appear clueless on what their job functions are.

Parking isn&#39;t so bad around this area, usually there is available free street parking, but there is some construction so we ended up parking in the grocery lot a block away. 

Overall ambiance... The decorations are cute, with paintings of the restaurant name, cherry blossoms, and a noodle bowl. It felt nicer than expected when walking in. My coworker was worried that it was almost &#34;too cute&#34; and that the food would be lacking... But luckily that was an unfounded conclusion. 

We all got the pho, which was great. I got a size small for ~$7.50 (filled me up enough, but left me wanting a bit more), but would probably go for the medium next time. You CAN tell the noodles are fresh, and they are great. 

The broth is nice. They have pepper, sri racha, and hoisin sauce at the table, for those who like to add to their soup. Also looks like you can request chili oil if you want that. 

Another thing that is really nice is that the three of us each got our own bean sprouts/basil/jalapeno plates! Feels more fair than the communal plates that can happen in other restaurants. 

The meat in the pho was also good, and substantial. Sometimes the beef in pho can be bland, as if all the flavor was boiled out into the soup already. Here, the meat was flavourful. The tendon I got was also the perfect consistency - not crunchy or like jello. 

They take credit card, with one of those tablet registers that kindly calculate tip for you. There wasn&#39;t a problem with splitting the bill among the 3 of us.

Anyway, I suspect that we will be back. I really want to try their vermicelli options next. The owner(?) was really nice, if not a bit surprised at their sudden popularity. He said he didn&#39;t know about the article until a patron mentioned it to him yesterday. I hope this place succeeds!"

Tips: next time just clean the table with a clean towel and not with one of those car wash towel it will save you time and the table will be cleaner so you wouldn&#39;t have to use hand towel to clean it again, it would save you more money...

Pho: The noodle was like exactly how I remember having it in Vietnam!! Fresh noodle and just precut the way it is. 5 star for me !

Special combo banh canh: Was a disappointment!!! The just putted different type of pho meet in there and minced pork. And the broth was just to plan for me.

Bun Bo hue: although they have Varieties of different meat in there, but the broth was just over powering with dice up lemongrass, and the broth was just not the right way to cook bun Bo hue. It&#39;s just need more favor to it. 

Over all the place is clean, good location, don&#39;t have good parking though. Would I come back? Maybe if I really wanted some fresh noodle pho.. But over all it&#39;s was just ok for me."

This place is amazing, and they really care about their pho. One tip that they told me, that I now pass on to you - if you have a small appetite like I do, you can get the Large or Extra Large pho &#39;split&#39; into halves - they&#39;ll serve you half of it to eat right there, and package the other half to go. I do this often, as I like to have the other half of the pho the next day. The half to go has the broth separated from the noodles, vegetables, and the other pho ingredients; you just put it together when you want to eat it. 

This way, the noodles don&#39;t sit in the broth for hours or days. 

The tofu veggie pho is jam packed with healthy baby bok choi, broccoli, and carrots, as well as the onions, tofu, and broth. Definitely getting your recommended daily amount of vegetables with this dish!"

All of the noodles are made fresh daily from rice flour and other natural ingredients in house. This is really rare to find for vietnamese cuisine since it&#39;s so labor intensive to make noodles daily. Noodles are fresh and delicious and have a light texture to them that you can&#39;t find anywhere else. 

Next month they&#39;ll have Banh Hoi which is a my all time favorite noodle. Imagine thin silk like noodles weaved together into sheets and garnished with Viet herbs and fish sauce. 

I tried the seafood  hu tieu which is rice noodles in a chicken base broth. My gf had the vermicelli noodles with chicken and egg rolls. Loved both dishes and can&#39;t wait to come back again."

The noodles were flat and did not break apart, the broth was very flavorful and not watery like some places.

Many people before us left because their food haven&#39;t shown up yet in almost one hour. Wow.. So for bun bo hue, I think I can survive from other places. And for the pho itself..

In comparison, it is much thicker, &amp; more dense. Their noodles is similar to fettucine noodles (NOT THE TASTE OBV) but the size and thickness of it. 

I ordered the chicken pho and I had all these great expectations, but IMO it was just mediocre. The noodles do not compliment the pho broth as well as the thin rice noodles at other pho places. The thickness of the noodles do not soak up the delicious pho broth, so there&#39;s not much flavor going on.

I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ll go again, but it&#39;s definitely worth a try. I appreciate fresh and homemade ingredients, so that was worth the trip."

She was starving when she arrived and it just so happened Dong Thap was only a couple of minutes from my apartment on Beacon Hill, so we decided to try it out.  

The place is pretty nondescript and we accidentally drove past it on our first attempt, but we looped back around and found parking in the small lot around back.  We were immediately seated and offered water and tea while we looked over the menu.  The menu isn&#39;t huge and most of the offerings are Vietnamese dishes we&#39;re familiar with, so she quickly decided on the Vermicelli Bowl with chicken &amp; lemongrass.  I was in the mood for something more adventurous and took the server&#39;s recommendation of the House Special soup (beef shank, pig trotters, Vietnamese ham, pig blood cubes, and tendon).  

The food came out pretty quickly, maybe 5 or 10 minutes after we ordered, and we were both surprised at how generous the portions were.  As for the taste/quality, it was superb.  Admittedly, I was a little hesitant about the soup due to the exotic nature of some of the ingredients but it was surprisingly delicious and full of new flavors!  My mom loved her dish as well, and since we were one of the only tables in the restaurant (we came towards closing) we ended up chatting directly with the owner for a good 15 minutes or so.  Super friendly!  

I&#39;ve come back several times since (my current favorite is the pork and egg roll vermicelli bowl) and the food never disappoints.  Combined with the incredible service, I&#39;ll easily award this place the full 5 stars.  It&#39;s still pretty new and I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll continue to grow in popularity, so go enjoy before it inevitably blows up as a local hot spot."

Thus, my friends and I decided to make the journey to ID to check it out. I actually drove in from Bellevue, having spent the morning unsuccessfully looking for a canine companion at the animal shelter. My spirits were low and the grey drizzle was not making me feel any better.

The restaurant is so inconspicuous from the outside as to be a hole in the wall. In fact, the only reason I was able to find it is because the lot I decided to try to find parking in happened to be right next to it. The interior is very nice, however, with a clean white aesthetic.

We were served relatively quickly and my pho special arrived with all the trappings of the classic soup noodle dish, with one exception. The noodles were quite large and wider than other places I&#39;ve been. This is because they are hand-made, which makes all the difference in the world. Everything in the dish itself was quite tasty, from the meats to the noodles. As others have said, I too agree that the broth was blander than other places, but I actually appreciated the lightness of the taste.

The pho comes in an array of sizes from small to the ridiculous super bowl (featured in an eponymous eating challenge which I shall someday conquer). For me, who is usually quite hungry, a medium was enough to fill me up. That coupled with the friendly staff (the owner came by several times to check on us and chat!) is enough to make any guy forget about his animal woes.

tl;dr: come because you are depressed about not getting a cute dog and leave happy because the food is cheap and good and the staff are great"

Breakfast was good and our server, Dianna, was attentive and very cheerful. While I felt the traditional Benedict was good, it was nothing outstanding. The eggs were a bit too soft for my taste. The roasted potatoes were delicious. The orange juice was fresh squeezed. 

The Chef&#39;s Counter is what is puts Scout at five stars. It was one of the most amazing culinary experiences I have had, ever!

We started our journey with Chef Quinton Stewart with an array of appetizers served in the lounge. Accompanied by champagne and a white Negroni mixed table side. The standout for me was the Potato Bellini with Caviar. We were then shown to the counter where we could watch Chef Stewart prepare the rest of our amazing meal. All were accompanied by regional wines matched to compliment the variety of fish, meat and fresh produce. My favorites were the brioche crab sandwich with nori powder, the salad constructed by the Sous Chef of baby greens and flowers and the smallest carrot I have ever seen all lightly drizzled with a slightly sweet creamy dressing, the beef short rib, and the brown butter ice cream for dessert. After all of this, we were invited to go up to The Nest - a bar on the roof of the hotel with the most amazing view of the sound. There we were treated to torched marshmallows in rich dark chocolate. 

I would highly recommend the chefs counter for an absolutely exquisite sampling of the bounty available in the Pacific Northwest. It was well worth the $200 a person."

He elevated the experience with his attentiveness, yet never a linger, suggestions/knowledge, and his special touches. He wanted us to have an experience vs a meal - and we did.

I&#39;ll send my friends, family and colleagues there. I&#39;m an unpaid advocate for those businesses. I want them to succeed.  I was hopeful I&#39;d be able to add Scout to that list, but my experience last night wasn&#39;t close to living up to my expectations.

First off, I want to give recognition to Ty and Mark.  They were engaging, friendly and professional.  The two stars on this review are both for them.  Aside from them, and the decor, which really is lovely; warm, inviting, comfortable, the rest of my experience was an unmitigated disaster.

Came in with a friend and sat at the bar. It was busy, but nowhere close to busy enough for our bartender to be as in the weeds as he was.  He looked totally frazzled, like he was in way over his head.  By the way, I&#39;m not using his name intentionally, not trying to put him on blast specifically.  We placed our drink order, another bartender came over to chat.

We started to chat and he in the midst of the conversation he casually throws in that The Thompson is the new premier spot in Seattle and &#34;We&#39;re better than The Four Seasons.&#34;  Wow I thought, really shooting for the top of the hierarchy, if that&#39;s true this place might earn my business consistently.

Drinks arrive and sadly they weren&#39;t close to the standards the bartender was hyping. In fact, my friend had to send his back to be remade.  I&#39;ll point out that I&#39;ve been drinking with this friend for the better part of the last three years and I&#39;ve never seen him send a drink back, ever.  Keep that as a point of reference, speaks volumes about just how poorly made his drink was.

Outside of Ty and Mark, the entire staff appeared lost.  Completely disorganized, while scurrying about with a look like they were trying to herd cats.  It&#39;s not the way a high end hotel bar should function.  It changed the vibe from very chic to Chinese fire drill status.

Overall, (obviously) this was a very poor experience.  When you charge what you charge and have staff telling customers (unprompted) that you&#39;re better than The Four Seasons you&#39;d better have the crew and processes in place to back that up.  At this point, Scout isn&#39;t close to living up to that claim."

Bearing in mind that this is a brand new restaurant, I went in with a very open mind. Always hoping for the best but expecting some hiccups, it was a lovely surprise that the Scout staff were totally on their game when I was there last Friday night. They were almost too on their game! We had a few servers waiting on our large group and everyone was quick to refill waters, take orders, and follow up with us once food was delivered. We even got to meet the chef who personally dropped off one of his dishes to our table so  he could talk about how it was prepared. Stellar! More on this later...

How it all began: I walked in with some friends at 6:30 or so and we were warmly greeted at the door by a hostess who led us over to a big comfy booth. I immediately noticed that unlike every other restaurant I&#39;ve been to, the booths here are in the center of the room. As in - there isn&#39;t that awkward wall-side where if you slide in first, you can&#39;t get out. Loved it! The booths house large tables so they do double-do as communal dining tables if you&#39;re there alone or with just a couple of friends. Each table could comfortably host about 8 or so people. And I love that because I feel like in reviews I&#39;m often writing things like, &#34;Good for small groups. Don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re with more than 2 friends.&#34; But truly, at Scout (I recommend calling ahead) you could easily bring a bunch of friends and fill out a big long booth. We were a group of six and so we ended up with a little extra bit of elbow room, which was really nice. It left more room on the table for shared plates and cocktail glasses. We pretty much ate every dish and tried every cocktail on the menu over the 3.5 hours we were there.

The decor is sexy. It&#39;s like modern design meets PNW comfort. There&#39;s soft flannel fabric, but it&#39;s magenta. There are wooden tables but they&#39;re a more modern design than you&#39;d expect. There are metal fixtures but they&#39;re bronze and brass instead of nickel. It&#39;s like a super updated restaurant that you wish was an outpost at a ski resort. Almost Scandinavian in the sense that it&#39;s really tidy and modern but still warm and comforting. Look, I&#39;m no expert - just come see for yourself! That said, the PDR is amazing. I totally want to have a birthday party or ladies night in the back &#34;cabin&#34; area. Again, something to see for yourself.

Let&#39;s talk about what really brought me here though... not the decor but the food and the cocktails. There are a few bars that I drink at regularly in town and that&#39;s directly related to who the bar GMs and staff members are. A bar is only as good as the staff leading the charge and the team here is strong. I recognized the GM from other great bars around the city and knew we were in good hands. 

I had:
-Great bottle of rosé to split with friends to start. Prices on bottles were super reasonable.
-Sherry Cobbler - my favorite cocktail of the night! Highly recommend.
-Very Old Cow - a lovely Mezcal cocktail, really packed a punch.
-Forget the name of it but a really pretty purplish cachaça flip cocktail. 

For food we split (and loved):
-A foraged mushroom dish with foie gras.
-Roasted chicken (NOTE: I never order chicken at restaurants but this felt like a good litmus test and this was everyone&#39;s favorite dish of the night. It also came with great roasted carrots.)
-Crudo.

And I think we had an heirloom tomato dish? At this point we&#39;d had a lot to drink, ok! We also indulged in dessert. 

I&#39;d like to come back another few times to see how they manage the hoards of people. This has been a highly anticipated opening and I think it&#39;ll be the perfect go-to spot for Seattle&#39;s summer weather. Located super close to the market (and my house!) I&#39;m most excited to come back for breakfast and lunch. See you soon, Scout! Thanks for a great night."

We left full, happy, and impressed with what they put in front of us.

The décor is awesome, with lots of wood and plaid, and plenty of concrete, glass, and metal to give it a rugged, comfortable, but elegant feel. It&#39;s open, but still feels private and quiet enough to enjoy a good conversation at your table. We sat in the room in the back called the cabin, and it was gorgeous. Great for celebrating a birthday and catching up with friends who just got back from Europe.

Having worked in restaurants before, I was prepared for a few mistakes but they did a damn good job. They were surprisingly well organized and we very well taken care of. Both food and service were executed exceptionally well, and the servers and runners were all friendly, competent, and communicative.

As far as the food goes, we were all extremely impressed. We decided to share everything, so ran through most of the menu. The flavors and textures in every dish were exciting, composed, and balanced. Yet, everything we ate was familiar and accessible - it&#39;s the kind of place you could take your steak and potatoes eating dad or your foodie coworker and both would leave happy. The rock fish was our table favorite, closely followed by the salmon. They nailed the fish in terms of texture and taste, and the accompaniments for each added much in both overall dish flavor and complimentary textures. I can&#39;t remember the exact dish, but we also had an asparagus dish with morel mushrooms in it... it was so good it lasted about 30 seconds!

I usually order classic cocktails, but we all decided to try different house cocktails. They were all really good, and I was happy they had a session IPA as a fancier place since I&#39;m not much of a wine guy.

I&#39;m looking forward to going back to try it again. We truly had a wonderful meal, and my girlfriend had a great birthday which made my night too. Thanks Scout!"

The seating is long tables in the middle where multiple parties can sit at the same table. There are private tables along the window. 

Service was very good - attentive without being overbearing.

The food is a little pricey for portion sizes. I had the tomato salad to start (A) and my husband had the mushrooms with foie (B+). He had the rockfish for his entree and it was amazing (A+). I had the chicken and it was the disappointment of the evening and the loss of a star for my review. It was very dry (C-).

I would definitely eat here again but not as often as other Belltown restaurants due to price.

We were walking downtown after a movie &amp; decided to look for a place for a couple drinks and an appetizer. We&#39;d not been to Scout before, so we popped in thinking it looked like fun. Took forever to get someone to take our order. We ended up just having drinks because their appetizers and small plates were more like sides. They offered squash, salad, mushrooms, barrata with beets...nothing that we could comfortably share at the low table where they seated us. When I asked about appetizers, our waiter displayed an attitude that was clearly unacceptable. What a snob.

So many places downtown, so many many choices. Just move on from this place if you&#39;re  looking for a fun bite and a drink!"

Service was really good, with multiple servers checking in on us as we sat and ordered.  Bar serves a lot of whiskey drinks, but I didn&#39;t get one as it was lunch before going to a business meeting.

Got the Fried Chicken Sandwich...and it blew my mind.  Not only was the chicken, slaw and sauce amazing, the bun was soft and spongey, but also light and held up under the weight of the sandwich.  The homemade chips on the side were addictive, and added the perfect amount of salt to the meal.  

All in all, it was a great experience, I highly recommend both the hotel and the restaurant for your next trip to Seattle!"

The staff was very patient and welcoming. The atmosphere was hipster meets modern so it was quite unique. The food was served promptly and hot! I barely tasted it because of how hungry I was.. But the Bloody Mary was definitely the highlight of the brunch! Dan, the manager introduced himself to me right as I sat down so I definitely appreciated that. The bartender, Sarah, was very friendly and I heard she makes the Bloody Mary mix herself so I will definitely go back again!"

The place has a cool modern lodge feel -- a sleek design with natural elements and upscale flannel decor (yes, that&#39;s a thing). The staff was great but the food was the reason we&#39;ll be back-- PNW ingredients freshly prepared and beautifully presented. Don&#39;t miss the trout tartine served on grilled bread. Can&#39;t wait to go back for dinner."

We came just a little after 10 so we didn&#39;t expect them to still be serving dinner but after trying out a few other spots that refused to seat us for dinner we thought we might as well settle for the light snacks and drinks they might have. 

We told our hostess that we really wanted to do dinner but were fine to be seated for just the bar menu if that was the only thing available. To our surprise she told us that technically the kitchen is closed but ran to make sure they can fit in one more order for us. 

We got seated and the service to our delight was just as great as the place looked. In my experience, high end snazzy spots usually depend on the reputation of their setting to bring people in and little on the holistic customer service experience.  What set them apart to me personally was how it wasn&#39;t just our server that was amazing, but the staff seemed to work really great together. I ordered a drink from another server who quickly sent yet another server to bring it out to me when they realized my server was busy at another table. At most places this very simple system of communication is broken and I end up waiting for 20 minutes for a drink if I don&#39;t end up asking my actual server. Here, you don&#39;t. 

Food was better than i expected too! I ordered the Trout and my friend got the halibut which he really enjoyed.. Portions are a bit smaller.. Personally I like that. As I love when I can actually finish the plate I&#39;ve ordered and prefer that to the typical american sized portions.  But I can understand how the average customer might consider it to be too small of a portion in relation to the price you are paying.

Menu is limited yet curated. 

Overall, I didn&#39;t expect to love the place as most of these types of places leave a lot to be desired. But I left totally impressed on both the food and the customer service experience."

Limited evolving menu.  The grilled.carots were very tasty and an awesome treat to start.  The salad was quite refreshing and simple. Burrata with peaches were ok but paled in comparison to the carrots. 

Main entre including the blackened cod was perfectly prepared. The corn garnish was a great touch. Rib eye nice flavor. 

The service was attentive and knowledgeable.  New restaurant with some growing pains but they own any issues and are accountable. My steak came out over cooked and they immediately acknowledge. Btw it was really good when it arrived. My daughter loves her steak and commented the sauce was delicious. 

Overall, the food was great, space nice location and service great. I will be coming back regularly."

I&#39;ll start with the toughest things that I think the management should pay attention to, in order:

1) we aren&#39;t foodies but both meals (salmon and cod) were over-the-top salty. Even my child&#39;s Mac and cheese was too salty. We waited tables for eons and therefore didn&#39;t send it back since it was obviously how this restaurant creates its food. 

2) portion sizes were tiny, even for me and I&#39;m a small eater. It was clear that my husband left hungry, and we had 2 appetizers (which were much better than the entrees). They should modify pricing or portions, or both.

3) decor felt lacking and not inviting/warm. Hard to explain but the restaurant was essentially a line of long tables, and they seat 2 parties in essentially the same table/booth. Ambience lacking; they never even lit the candles.

4) another couple behind us must have been from Zagat or something because, suddenly, staff were buzzing around them, wiping every crumb or water drip off the table, and we kind of got ignored toward the end of our dining. No big deal but they clearly received very different service (but, frankly, I wouldn&#39;t want that kind of attention at a restaurant).

5) my husband was actually offended that our server tacked 20% on the bill, and we pondered on the drive home if it was because we were dressed down since we hiked all day. It kind of bummed us out. Since Paul was so great, we actually ended up leaving him like a 40% tip but it just was a disappointing way to leave the restaurant. We see now that this is standard practice. Why?

6) we actually went to Scout given a newspaper review that discussed their rooftop dining (Nest). We were so fired up and drove out of our way to get there because it was such a beautiful sunny day. They don&#39;t allow kids up at the Nest. We, and especially our 6-yo daughter, were very disappointed.

7) hostess was confused, didn&#39;t seat us at our reservation time even though the restaurant was open.  ordered a drink while we waited, and it took nearly 20 minutes to receive.  it was painful to watch my beautiful cocktail die in the bar.

So...next time we visit we will try some different dining options. Maybe Scout is still very new and can iron out the kinks, if they consider the reviews they receive."

Staff was very friendly and the place is very well-decorated and has a clean, modern vibe. We split the cinnamon bun and both got the Dungeness Benedict. It was fantastic! The hollandaise was almost fluffy and sort of lemony, and the crab cakes were packed with a lot of real crab. So good!"

In general I&#39;ve been disappointed with huxley wallace collective restaurants and josh hendersen although admittedly I&#39;ve only been to Westward and Bar Noroeste. We went in with somewhat modest expectations and were pleasantly surprised with the creativity and the flavor profile of the dishes they put out in front of us. 

The cocktails are a tad pricey and I though they were at best average. I thought the bramble drink stood out the most. 

We started with their special crab appetizer which was refreshing, unfortunately it arrived as the last course of our meal. They had some goof up in their ticketing system and we had to remind them to bring it. The servers did apologize for the mishap, turns out it was worth the wait since this course was delectable. We also ordered the mushroom appetizer which was a solid dish but didn&#39;t raise the bar on wow factor. 

The pasta with garlic scapes and parmesan emulsion was simple yet so divine. I&#39;d order this again in a flash. 

The rockfish with corn succotash was a comforting dish and packed a lot of flavor. The fish was delicately cooked and the chef&#39;s handling of the fish was clearly remarkable. 

The dessert was somewhat expected with rhubarb and strawberry sorbet. The pastry chef need to really up their game here since the rest of the meal was quite stunning but dessert was somewhat of a letdown. 

There were some lapses in service but that was understandable given that they&#39;ve been open for barely a week when we visited. They were gracious enough to offer the crab appetizer on the house. I&#39;ll definitely be back to experience the menu changing with the seasons!"

Typical Pacific Northwest menu which is not a bad thing at all really. A couple of fish dishes, a chicken, and some meat dishes as well. We went for the fish. I had the Halibut and the wife had the salmon. Both were very very good. I also started with thier clam chowder which was great. Cocktails were also very good. Small but, interesting craft cocktail menu. The only thing the keeps me from adding that extra star is the service. It wasn&#39;t bad per say. It just wasn&#39;t great. The bartender was the type that, instead of asking if we wanted another drink when our glasses were empty, waited for us to chase him down."

We had amazing service (especially considering they&#39;ve been open for only a few weeks!), the atmosphere feels like a PNW getaway, and the food was outstanding. We ordered the mushrooms and heirloom tomatoes to start. They were both excellent. My boyfriend liked the heirloom tomatoes best and I liked the mushrooms the best. More for me :) 

Then we had the Torchiette and Ribeye. Both were fantastic but WOW I have never had pasta this delicious from a restaurant in Seattle. It was light, buttery and packed with flavor."

Most hotel and fancy restaurants in Seattle make the mistake of trying to be pseudo-Chicago or pseudo-New York steakhouses/martini/power dinner places.  This is fine cuisine and fine dining atmosphere with friendly service (and knowledgeable bartenders)  and welcome cuisine on the Seattle scene. Although you can get a good steak there, this is really more new American cuisine with a Pacific Northwest leaning. I Had the trout with muscles which had some Lovely touches of subtlety  as well as a Brussels sprouts dish-- yes I said Brussels sprouts--  with pear and walnut and blue cheese that knocked my socks off. Very original.  Although I did not try it it appeared there was an extensive wine list by the glass if you inquired I don&#39;t know of any place in Seattle like that.

I had the mushrooms without the foie gras (I&#39;d rather not eat something that came from a bird&#39;s lifetime of suffering, thanks) and the baby lettuce salad. The salad was too cold and the dressing had a fishy taste. It apparently had too much acid in it because by the end of the meal, the greens were so broken down it was floppy and inedible."

Originally I was looking to spend some time in the new bar on top of the building that Scout is in - Nest. Unfortunately I had no reservation for Nest and so was not even allowed into the elevator to get up to the top of the building. ( $150 for a reservation is absurd ...)

So, instead of Nest, I was offered Scout. First the decor of the restaurant is entirely unattractive and certainly not going to generate an appetite. 

I&#39;d like to be able to report that the owner/operator is a good chef or at least understands how to run a bar. However, I can&#39;t do that. Apart from the fact that the staff were too snooty to offer good service, the restaurant stank of either thoroughly dead oysters or yesterday&#39;s thoroughly dead fish. It was so awful that after a few minutes I was unable to stomach the stench and so was not even tempted to deal with the inattentive staff.

What a total disappointing experience. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

The head chef came over to our table to apologize that the Chefs Counter spots were already sold out for the evening and talked to us for nearly ten minutes. Service was impeccable and the food was fantastic. Delicious and inventive, novel and thoughtful. Dishes were visually attractive and tastes were well balanced. I&#39;m not saying that I actually licked the lemon beurre blanc sauce off the oyster shells, but I&#39;m not saying I didn&#39;t. Equally memorable was the wild mushroom starter.  Well executed sear on the wild mushrooms, with a flavorful caramelized exterior and a velvety interior. The earthy mushrooms balanced out by tangy creme fraiche and foie gras."

All of the dishes and drinks we had were great. We had the tomato and mushroom appetizers which were delicious, and they shaved truffles onto the dish at the table. I had the chicken which had a nice lemon / citrus flavor and was cooked perfectly. 

We sat at a communal table, but it wasn&#39;t loud so we were able to have nice conversations. The service was superb. Everyone was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive while giving us the space to enjoy our time together. I&#39;ll definitely be going back again soon."

I&#39;d go into more detail, but there&#39;s really no reason to -- trout was underseasoned and strangely creamy which was a clash, vegetable dishes were entirely average. My friends like their dishes more, but one thing we could all agree on -- absolutely insane prices. It&#39;s one thing to charge like this place does if it&#39;s a five star place, but portions are small as cost is astronomical. The small selection of beer was over the top, $12 for a bottle? And an 11.2 oz bottle to boot? Nuts. Session lager stubbies were an option at $6, but honestly, that&#39;s equally absurd. This place is all style and no substance, yet -- which is a shame, because it&#39;s a gorgeous space and the service was killer.

The food was incredible. The sommelier was knowledgeable and helpful in selecting a fine white wine from Oregon that was much lower priced than the ones we had been considering.
I had planned to title my review &#34;Phenomenal chef, Incompetent wait staff&#34;. But we had the chance to speak with a waiter, and came to understand that the staff is talented, experienced, and motivated.
The problem is with the front-of-house: We called Friday night to add 1 person to our reservation for 4. We left a voicemail at prime dinner time -- 8pm. Having heard nothing back by 1pm Saturday, our friends had to cancel because they couldn&#39;t count on having their additional guest included. I called Scout, talked to a person, and told them why we had to change the reservation to 2 people, and that our voicemail asking for 5 should be ignored. 
Then at 5pm, Amanda called us to say that our reservation for 5 people was confirmed. I explained how we had called earlier and had to change the reservation to 2.

I love 99 Park and thought this was a comparable with their chef joining this new team. I wanted to love it, but I didn&#39;t. We came here for Father&#39;s Day, and during their soft opening. They are still working their kinks out. We went up to the Nest to meet our family. At first we were declined to go up, and told we had to wait for them downstairs. I pushed back a little and said there was 20 minutes until our reservations. They already had a table upstairs. The gal put us in the elevator and said nevermind, and to get out or she would get in trouble if we went up without her telling the host upstairs. Understandable since they are working out their rhythm but extremely disorganize. When we sat down for dinner, we ordered a bottle of wine for the table that our server couldn&#39;t find and told us why it took 30 minutes to get the bottle. We ordered the bisque, delicious and creamy but we had shells in it. The steak was lack later, thin cut, filled with fatty bits and underwhelming. It was a heartier portion which can&#39;t say the same for others. Mother in law ordered the mushroom apps, that advertised fois gras, which was a drizzling on the remnants on the plate with little taste to it. We also ordered the albacore crudo, under seasoned but fresh fish. Small portions, also ordered the trout, nothing breath taking about this dish. Menu is too small for a party of 6 and not a whole lot to choose from. For fine dining, wasn&#39;t a fan of the communal tables. I left hungry and came home and ate ramen. I would give them a try again after they worked out some kinks to see if the menu expands and portion hopefully grow slightly."

Beet salad, burger with lots of gourmet add ones ( oh yes I did add bacon, mushrooms, green chiles &amp; avocado) and hand cut fries were all excellent. We also had the huge deep chocolate cream stuffed cupcake and it was decadent and dreamy! I&#39;ll be back any time I&#39;m doing massage on Beacon Hill"

As a native of Beacon Hill I don&#39;t mind a new restaurant close by since there&#39;s not too many choices in the area. The reason i give 3 stars is because the food is actually pretty damn good. Good enough that i&#39;ve eaten there a good 10 to 12 times. 

My gripe is that the service and overall attitude of the staff is corny and does not reflect the neighborhood of Beacon Hill. They are rude condescending and over all unwelcoming! My family and I have NOT been back since!"

The food is fresh here. The portions are large so it does fill you up! The burgers were juicy and flavorful. The price is a little high though... if I wanted a slice of cheese it is $2.00 and if I wanted sauce... it&#39;s .50

The overall, restaurant has a relaxing, clean and nice atmosphere."

Easy light rail ride to get here and enjoy the staff a lot.  The food is much more than &#34;pub&#34; food.  Have had the grilled cheese which was very awesome.

One of the few places that carries Trickster IPA on a regular basis which is a plus for me.  HH is until 6pm each day with Sunday all day.

If you like the cool vibe of get away bar that you can just chill and make conversation with the local community this is your place.  Kudo&#39;s to the ownership and staff.  Cheers."

They have a sort of build-your-own burger menu, with different base burgers and add ons like fried egg, bacon, fancy cheeses and mushrooms, I think I even saw peanut butter but I can&#39;t speak to that. Burger was good and the house sauce was better (CBGB?) but the BRUSSELS SPROUTS. The sprouts were out of this world, crispy with a maple balsamic reduction and done just right. Kitschy hipster 70&#39;s cabin feel that somehow worked.

Good happy hour specials ($5 bourbon and 16oz Olympia) and fun happy hour foods.

Not too family friendly (no booster seats, limited high chairs, glass cups, no changing tables), but good for adults and small groups/couples.

Bar at back with TV. 

Street parking only.

Slow food service... SO slow. Come with no rush, for your sake. The waitress was sweet and semi-attentive but that couldn&#39;t make up for the fact that we waited 32 minutes for our food.

The food is pretty good, but too bland for the price tag. The chili was ok, nothing to be excited about unfortunately ... The bacon cheeseburger is good, but so greasy. The cbgb or chipotle/garlic aioli is the best part of it.

Unfortunately on our second visit it was such a bad experience that I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re not going back again.

We got to the restaurant ahead of the rest of our party and I ordered a grilled cheese for my kid, knowing that she was going to be hungry well before the rest of us were ready for dinner. After a short while the rest of our party arrived and we placed the rest of our order. 20 minutes passed...then 30... I checked in with the waitress about the grilled cheese and it appeared that she had not even put in the order. So she rushed to go put the order in.

The majority of our order came in...of course the grilled cheese was still missing. After (waiting ~45 minutes for our food) we had all finished, our plates were cleared and we were pretty much ready to go my kids food came! And to add insult to injury, we were still charged for the sandwich.

So after a 2 hour dinner, having to go order beers at the bar instead of waiting for the waitress to take our drink orders, and waiting an incredibly long time for our food, it&#39;s unlikely that we&#39;re going make it back to oak."

If you go at peak times be prepared that it can be fairly loud but that is expected in a popular place this size. We usually go after 8:30 and it&#39;s perfect.

Gabbed a seat in the bar because that&#39;s just our preference. After asking for menus we waited very patiently for the bartender to take our order (you have to order at the bar rather than them come to your table). When he finally came over to us, instead of asking for our order he said &#34;you know we have table service downstairs, or is that not what you were trying to do&#34;. After telling him it wasn&#39;t he then told us &#34;well I have a couple things to do, so....&#34; Then walked away. We stood there shocked for a minute then wondered if we should go downstairs. We ended up just leaving because of how embarrassed and disrespected we felt. We understand how busy bartenders can get, but there were so many other ways to handle it. Lost a  few regular customers today...


In response to the comment left by the restaurant: we didn&#39;t want table service. We walked up to the bar to try and order. If you don&#39;t offer food service in the bar, why didn&#39;t he say that when he handed us food menus? This isn&#39;t a case of miscommunication. He was rude. Period."

The server is very courteous, he asked me orders with enthusiasm and activeness. Then assured me of my order with few minutes. Indeed he returned with my food (fried chicken-filled sandwich with freshly taken-from-farm-leafy salad and fries. The food was satisfying, enjoyable and delightful).

The beer is served in libbey can-shaped beer glasses, and they always have Lucille IPA on tap.  

The food is awesome.  They have hand-cut fries served with homemade aioli that&#39;s similar to mayo.  There are corn nuggets that may not sound appealing, but is a little explosion of melted, warm corn kernels that is surprisingly good.  The burgers are solid, but the chicken sandwich is what you really should order.  It&#39;s dark meat, what I prefer, that is extra crispy.  It&#39;s freakinggg awesome!"

We had such a bizarre experience with the service from beginning to end. The bartender seemed friendly but our waitress acted like she was in prison the whole time. She walked by at least 5 times, a good 15 minutes before acknowledging us and taking our orders. Despite her glare we tried our best to exchange pleasantries. When we asked how she was doing, she rolled her eyes and said &#34;I&#39;m really hot, to be honest.&#34; And then stared at us blankly, never smiling. Welllllll ok! Sorry? 

The bartender brought us the wrong drinks. The dark and stormy we ordered was so bad we didn&#39;t drink it but no one ever noticed or asked us about it, even though it sat untouched for an hour +

After getting the wrong drinks, we got our food with the wrong sides. Our waitress noticed but we were absolutely starving at that point and declined waiting for the right sides to be made. It was sad that nothing further was done about all the wrongness - I don&#39;t think they really cared all that much. 

But at the end of the day, our food was really good!!! The kitchen is firing on all cylinders. We got a decked out burger and a veggie burger and they were both great. We each loved our food even with them both being so different. 

So overall the food is good! The mixed drinks and the service were absolutely horrible. Inexcusable. If I were in the area again I&#39;d go, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of  my way for this place and I would encourage the owners to get better servers."

The second time was for a quick dinner.  I had the fried chicken sandwich.  This is actually a large sandwich.  It was two big chicken thighs between the buns.  I ate one piece and used the other for the sandwich which was perfect.  It came with a very large plate of tasty fries. It would be a great split if you shared a salad.

I don&#39;t like seeing surprise $.50 charges on my bill, but I also didn&#39;t need as much sauce as I was given. How about give me a ramekin half that size and call it good? And don&#39;t come back at me and say that complaining about it is what&#39;s petty. I called you it first! We can&#39;t both be Petty. But if I&#39;m Petty, then you&#39;re the Heartbreakers. Either way it means you&#39;re a little overrated. 

The atmosphere of the place is alright, pretty cozy. The beer choices are great. I would come for drinks anytime. Food was a mediocre experience. They have excellent fries, but their burger was dry (both bun and meat). And the prices are a teensy bit steep. Slightly above fair market price, I would say. Food service is a little slow too. 

I also don&#39;t get why their happy hour food is basically just pot pies. Who wants that? I get that you want to have your own thing, and I get that some people like pot pies, but maybe some regular pub snacks would be well received too."

Ordered their rally fries, which included minced garlic and parsley served with mayo. So so good! Want to try some of the burgers and sandwiches next time! Decent prices and a nice happy hour!

I was excited to have a burger joint in the BH area and I always love me a good burger..but I felt like the burgers were definitely mediocre. 

My cousin got the special espresso burger and it tasted like a regular burger. Maybe it wasn&#39;t seasoned well? There was just something off. I would have rather had a 5 guys or red robin. 

The waitress was nice but pressuring us on the drinks which got annoying. 

Anyways, if I was really reallllllly craving a burger I guess I can try it out again..but I would rather go somewhere else. 

Parking is relatively easy since its in a neighborhood area. Prices are average to higher."

I have waiting in anticipation to have The Oak open and have watched it progress weekly after attending my nearby yoga class. Alas! I finally made it here and was excited after reading some yelp reviews.

I love, love, love the interior. It reminds me of modern meets oak meets retro. The main entrance offers dining experince for all ages. A nicely decorated chalk board offers the specials of the day which is a good thing to check out as it will not be on the menu.  A few steps up, there is a nice bar area with seating around the bar and booths.

Menu offers options of burgers, grilled cheese, frittes, dessert, chilli. I was told the menu is still being crafted which will may offer veggie meat options.  For my first visit, I of course being a grilled cheese lover, ordered the grilled cheese. They use a smoked cheese which is flavorful and a bit salty. I would order again, but request a tomato or raw onions to help cut down the salt taste. My friend ordered the Minimum Wage Burger which they LOVED! It has a wonderful smoked spicy sauce that adds a great kick. I would even think of requesting it for my grilled cheese!

Great ambience, good service, great add to the neighborhood!

It gets busy on the wkend evening so service can be tricky but the wait is worth it!"

At first impression I really loved the decor of the Oak, fun arty vibe and the upstairs has dark nooks, a cool fake fire light and thoughtful seating arrangements for all! 
The Oak serves craft cocktails, wine and a good selection of tap micro-brews with their dinner menu.

My favorite meal to order here so far is the Painted Hills Minimum Wage Burger, which is a delicious medium burger topped with your choice of lettuce, such as arugula and then your choice of toppings, (for extra fees) served with amazing frites! 
Man, don&#39;t miss these Frites! My hubby had the Painted Hills Sloppy Joe which also has been a favorite staple.

What is great about this neighborhood joint is they did their homework! Not only do they welcome and serve whole families the full menu and drinks in their all age dining area... A few steps to the back they also welcome adult only (sometimes you don&#39;t want your chair kicked by babies) tables at the bar seating as well! Yay! everyone is happy here!
So far, great food and great service, looking forward to try more of the menu items.

Tip: Many restaurants in this area are closed on Sunday.. but not the Oak."

There was maybe 3-4 tables and not full at all, but it literally took us 35-40 minutes to get our food. Not sure what the issue was, and no explanation was given, we just waited, and waited, and waited.... and we didn&#39;t order anything complicated. Just a bowl of chili (5 minutes in the microwave, max) and a minimum wage burger with cheese (10 minutes on the grill for medium, max.)

The Indie music is a definite plus (even if it&#39;s played a little too loud).  

We came here last night and upon entry, were greeted by what seemed like the smell of wort, though I&#39;m unsure if there&#39;s actually a brewery on the premises.  While there were only a few people when we arrived just after six, Oak was definitely hopping an hour later.  I don&#39;t know if Oak has air conditioning (being Seattle, they may well not), but Oak was rather warm, stuffy and humid.  A thermometer on one wall indicated a temperature just short of 80, and hitting 80 by the time we left.  

Because I had stuff to do later in the evening, I demurred on the temptation to quaff a cocktail.  However, JP got a glass of house red, served in a mini Ball jar.

The food menu looked great and I went with the Chicken Pot Pie (after receiving assurances from our friendly waiter that it didn&#39;t contain rosemary).  JP had planned to just eat like a bird and ordered only the mixed greens, which I also asked for to go along with my pot pie.  Even though we had already ordered, when JP noticed curry chick peas on the Daily Specials chalkboard, he requested an order of the peas.

The mixed greens with balsamic vinegar were pretty good.  Though nicely and thoroughly tossed, there was a smidge too much balsamic vinegar, making the greens overly tart. On the other hand, the chicken pot pie was primo, and I would come back for that.  The baked-to-a-perfect-golden-brown crust was tender and the chicken, potato, peas and carrot filling seasoned perfectly.  Delicious!!   

The curry chick peas looked a lot like Cocoa Puffs.  Their aroma made me think I had stepped into Namaste in Portland.  While the curry on the peas was just too overwhelming for me, I did enjoy the flavor of the clumps of a green sauce (chimichurri?) that had been sprinkled through the chick peas.

Service was very good, though I sense Oak might be a little understaffed when there is a full crowd.  Nonetheless, we like Oak and will return."

The front part has a bar with seating and then there is a back part with another bar and more seating.  Each bar serves an assortment of local beers and ciders.  They were out of the hefe I wanted to try and the bartender encouraged me to try a pale ale that they called the lemonade of beer and it tasted almost like a sour beer to me. I really liked it.  The menu is somewhat limited to mostly burgers and a few small plates.  You have many burger options and you can get fries or a side salad.  My friends went with the burgers which were served on very fresh, hardy rolls.  The side salad was huge with lots of fresh local lettuce.  The fries are served with mayonnaise which is weird for an east coaster but worth a try. I decided to go with the mac and cheese which was served with bread crumbs on top and very cheesy sauce.  The bowl looked small but filled me up!  For a Saturday afternoon it was not terribly crowded and they have happy hour from 4-6 (very cool on weekends too) with $1 off all drafts and a special happy hour menu."

Servers aren&#39;t in a hurry, and there was a theme of no emotion in the room. No smile, no suggestions, no interest, no talk of the food. The tables were sticky, too dark to tell what the stickiness was. Food was mediocre, a strange mix of burgers and vegan options. Expensive burger! Don&#39;t forget to ask for napkins!

We clearly stood out because we looked like we meant to go to a night club but we just wanted to be pretty for 2016!!! We ordered a lot of shots and whiskey and cokes but honestly, we had so much fun! They brought around yummy cake and champagne for everyone to cheers in the new year.

Server spoke really softly, but was great and had some cool blue hair.  I had the Patty Melt burger that was on sourdough bread with mushrooms, onions, and some awesome sauce.  Definitely not your traditional burger, but was really tasty.  Would have liked the burger to be a little less done, but still tasted good.  Tons of fries came with it and they were scrumptious.  

My wife had the Chimchurri chicken sandwich.  Also really good.  They had Bedford&#39;s Ginger Beer (from Port Angeles) which was so tasty.  I really liked the food here.  Sure it was greasy.  It&#39;s a bar/burger place.  What did you expect.  Maybe a little overpriced.  Still, I enjoyed it.  We plan to go back."

The build-your-own burger idea is pretty solid, and though it ends up being a little more expensive than I think is warranted (hence the 3.5 star rating), the ingredients are pretty good.  Only complaint was that the burger patty was a little small...could have done with a little more beef.  But it was cooked decently with a little pink in the middle, and the taste was not overwhelmed by the other burger ingredients.  In fact, it was so good at first bite that I forgot to put the tomato, onions, and other veggies on the burger (they&#39;re served to the side).  I had a heaping stack of fries (good quality) and a quarter-spear of pickle on the plate as well.  Very tasty.  My waiter recommended a ginger beer to wash everything down with, which proved to be a most tasty choice for someone planning to drive immediately after dinner.  Total after tax and tip = $20.  YMMV on that ROI.

When I come back to Seattle, I&#39;ll be able to drop some local knowledge by suggesting this place :)"

For one, there are no pictures of oak trees.

But really, when your server is too zonked from last night and forgets to put alcohol in your drink, and you bring it up, and there&#39;s no goddamn follow up?

It&#39;s hard to believe this was a lifeless zone just a few years ago, because this stretch of Beacon Avenue has four of the cooler new spots in town, all within a couple blocks of one another. Your friendly neighborhood watering hole with the killer kitchen will be played by The Oak (the rest of the ensemble comprises the serious beer bar, the pizzeria, and the Mexican joint). 

You walk in and there&#39;s a bar within a bar. There are booths and banquettes and tables and a little service area in the front rooms, and then up a couple stairs there&#39;s the bar-bar with flat screens, stools, and a few more booths and tables. The barback shows a bunch of old fruit crates turned this way and that to hold the different liquors, and the bartop shows a backlit groove filled with tiny antique apothecary bottles, covered with resin. The whole thridt-store-decoration motif is milked to the fullest extent here. It&#39;s hard to figure whether these decorations were a budget-saver for them, or ended up costing as much as a less whimsical approach would have. But once this place puts some years under its belt and all the shiny surfaces get some miles on &#39;em, it will all look really comfortably worn in, and that&#39;ll make this place even better.

So that&#39;s what you&#39;ve got: stylishly resuscitated old building, brought to life with a light touch. There&#39;s a carefully edited line of about a dozen tap handles, plus another dozen beers in cans (dig that they&#39;re cans and not bottles). There&#39;s a good cocktail setup, though they don&#39;t seem to be angling for the super-trendy cocktail crowd. They&#39;re just mixing good drinks with good ingredients. Didn&#39;t see the wine list but the rest of the bar suggests they probably did a good job with that as well. 

The staff here is super nice--really friendly and easy-going, and very intent on making sure you&#39;re comfortable and you get what you want. Given that they&#39;re on the hill, they&#39;re clearly looking to cultivate regulars who live nearby. They&#39;re remembering what you ordered, they&#39;re remembering your favorites, they&#39;re thinking about what they have that would be to your tastes. You feel like you&#39;re at somebody&#39;s house and they expect you to keep coming over to visit. Like all the places through here, you walk out feeling like you forgot to invite them over to your place next time--because you feel like you just went to a house party, rather than a bar/restaurant. 

And, best of all, the food. Ridiculously good bar food. The menu is short. Just one slightly trimmed sheet of card stock, printed one side only. Two burgers, four sandwiches, two salads, a couple sides, and four entrees. The entrees sound like they could change occasionally, and there are usually specials. The burgers are fantastic--everything is fresh and scratch-made. They must not bake the buns in house, I don&#39;t imagine, but they didn&#39;t come out of a bag after a long ride in a truck, that&#39;s for sure. They&#39;re local. The entrees were pretty awesome too, from the small bites I had, but they could be bolder with the seasonings.

What really stands out on the menu are the desserts. They&#39;re not the same every night, but there are a few slots on the dessert menu that always stay the same--a cake, a pie, something in a mason jar. They&#39;re just different things in each slot, as the pastry chef&#39;s whims carry the list through different permutations. The mason jar had peach cobbler last night. I&#39;m relieved I didn&#39;t tear down the kitchen walls looking for the rest of them. Man, was it good. Really tasted like fresh fruit--not like sugar. 

Bottom line, this is a good neighborhood bar even if your neighborhood is 20 miles away, like mine. Come in and have a burger and hang out. You don&#39;t need an invitation."

Let me explain the many reasons you will love this bar. 

One - it&#39;s among one of only two or three places in Beacon Hill that are actually open past 10pm. 

Two - It&#39;s adorable! The decor is cute, it&#39;s homey, it&#39;s friendly, it&#39;s casual. Perfect for Seattle.

Three - The drink menu is crazy affordable and perfect whether you&#39;re drinking, you&#39;re not, whether you want cheap beer, local beer, fancy beer or of course, a cocktail.

Four - The food is AWESOME! I couldn&#39;t actually decide what to eat so I ordered a Caprese salad and a massive burger. There was no way I could finish either dish but I had to get them because they sounded so good. And so did the rest of the menu, actually. The french fries were also great. I highly recommend anything on the menu. Whether it&#39;s a small plate, dinner, apps, shared food, etc.

So yes... get here ASAP. It&#39;s adorable, there&#39;s room for large groups, small groups or even just a seat at the bar. The service was super friendly and the entire place feels like it has been there forever. Such a welcome addition to Beacon Hill!"

I applaud your sticking to the short menu of awesomeness.  Definitely preferable to a long menu of mediocrity.

Case in point, in general I&#39;m just not that into grilled cheese sandwiches, but I finished what my kid didn&#39;t eat, and even half cold it was still one of the most amazing things I&#39;ve ever eaten.  Aged sharp cheddar is better than I could have imagined on grilled cheese.  I&#39;m talking like last meal, eyes rolling back in my head good.  

The happy hour house white wine was pretty darn good and a decent price too.

So she brings us out 7 shots (there were 7 of us), but since the reason why we were taking these shots was because of her you guys look fun, I want to take a shot with you&#34; we took an empty glass and poured out an additional shot from the 7. We then all proceed to take the shot (some nasty well whiskey, but what the hell- beggars can&#39;t be choosers) and the waitress asks &#34;alright, who is going to pay for the shots?&#34; 

Baffled, one of us gave her an additional credit card (we already had a couple down to pay our bill). Much like our waitress, hindsight is a bitch- should have never agreed to pay for those shots! Tricking people in to buying shots?!?!? On top of that, we were in the process of paying our existing bill. Shady business, left a very sour taste in our mouths (or maybe that was just the disgusting well whiskey we got tricked in to drinking and paying for.)"

I liked the vibe and the space a lot.  I wish they had a website or posted their menu online so I wasn&#39;t going in completely unprepared.  Their menu consists mainly of sandwiches with a few other options, but clearly the sandwiches are their main focus.

I had the grilled cheese sandwich with a side of fries.  The sandwich was OK.  It was very different from a normal grilled cheese, and not really in the best way.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but just not great either.  The fries were really tasty though.

My husband had the minimum wage burger and he LOVED it!  Said it is one of the favorite burgers he has had in Seattle.  Bummer I don&#39;t eat burgers lol.

I guess the skunk air freshener in the restroom is cool enough. :) SoBeHi (South Beacon Hill) has always been quiet at night---and it still is---until you step into either 1 of 2 bars: Tippe &amp; Drague Alehouse and, this, The Oak. 

Since a couple weeks ago, I&#39;d say I&#39;ve been in a few times in the front portion and the back, raised bar (I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a handicap ramp going up to it). It kind of has a classic, vintage-y, early-modern(?) retro flair to it with clean finishes. The upward focused candescent bulbs give off a neat ambient and soft light in the bar. Lots of old, classic touches throughout you may notice while the flatscreens always keep you in check with reality... and smartphones.

The staff I&#39;ve encountered have always been pleasant, friendly and helpful. Bridgett recommends the Herky&#39;s fried chicken sandwich, so if you love those, go for &#39;em.

For the grub, I&#39;ve tried that, the Minimum Wage Burger and the Overtime Burger:
--Herky&#39;s Fried Chicken Sandwich = I&#39;m slowly fading away from fried chicken but I wanted to try this one. The breading was a smidge too much for me, but the chicken that lies within was amazing. So warm, tender, moist and chicken-y. For the side, I opted for the side greens with balsamic vinagriette.
--Minimum Wage Burger: A good, solid meat sandwich with their unique sauce + the side of fries. It was pretty good.
--Overtime Burger: Same as MW, but instead of 1/3, it was 2/3 lb / 2 patties... It was big, it was meaty, it was a massive, messy and moist mess. Have some napkins and finger lickin&#39; on deck.

The desserts sound amazing as I believe they make them all in-house. 1 piece serves 2 so far I can tell and the glass hiding them usually has the ingredients listed. Some are too sweet for me, but if it&#39;s simple enough, I just may go for one.

This place and T&amp;D down the street get busy during the week&#39;s end slots. Check it out."

I was taking a few friends out for dinner.  I&#39;ve walked by this place several times so I decided to go there.  It was a great experience!

They don&#39;t take reservations on Saturday.  We went about 7:30 with a party of 4.  We were able to get a table within 20 minutes.  And the table was the best in the house, by itself, next to the window.

The service was good.  Nothing spectacular but appropriate.  Our drinks and food arrived timely and we weren&#39;t interrupted that much by an overzealous waiter (my pet peeve).

The drinks were amazing.  I had my signature Negroni and it tasted just like it should.  I only mention it because more often than not, it is made poorly at other establishments.

The brussel sprouts and frites were delicious!  The sprouts were crunchy and very flavorable.  I would highly recommend.  My boyfriend got the beet sandwich and he loved it.  I ordered the chili and it was actually pretty bland and the corn bread was dry.  That is why I gave 4 stars.  

Overall, we were there for a few hours and enjoyed it.  The food came out at a good speed that allowed us to have a drink, eat apps and then the mains.  It&#39;s always nice when the apps come out before the mains :)"

The burger... yum! I got the cheapest one and it was made with (I think) Painted Hills beef.  This burger was the juiciest, and tastiest burger I have ever had.  And it was even cooked how I requested well done! A still juicy burger gets and A+++ in my book!

The fries that came with my burger were OK, I would have liked them a little more crispier and not as salty.  But you could tell they were made in house and not just from a big bag of frozen fries.

The drink selection included some interesting beers, cider, and a big liquor selection so there was something for everyone.

This bar is just a few blocks from the Beacon Hill Light Rail station so it is easy to get to.  The street parking seemed to fill up so public transportation is an easy way to get there."

Didn&#39;t have drinks but had a lot of non-alcoholic options too. My husband loved the ginger beer. Will definitely come back to try a few other things.

The menu is pretty small but what they offer is quite delicious. My husband had the minimum wage burger and fries and he loved it. I went with the grilled cheese. I am kind of a grilled cheese snob, and this one was great! They used Cougar Gold cheese, my favorite, and the bread was soft. Nothing worse than eating a sandwich where the bread scrapes the roof of your mouth. The fries here are really good, too.

So why 4 stars instead of 5? It takes a little bit too long to get a cocktail, and the bartender did not know how to make a cosmo, a pretty common cocktail and one of my favorites. It should be a pretty, light pink color, not dark red. I can see myself coming here regularly to have a cocktail or two and would love it if they could get that one right! 

Other than that, everything was great. Pleasant service, good food, and a nice atmosphere. Very glad to have them in the neighborhood. We&#39;ll be back!"

2 tecate + 4 tacos (steak, chicken, pork, house) + multita (chicken) = ~$19

Everything is in the mini tortilla like you see in the ba-jallion pictures available. All were delicious, I am probably bias to pork and house because they had pineapple on it. Love that sweet and salty biz. They were a little on the greasy side, but very tolerable.

+ AL PASTOR

Seriously, the best tacos are the ones where the ingredients are minimal, but the flavor is incredible, and Tacos Chukis has this 100%. I&#39;ve heard iffy things about legit Mexican food in Seattle, but it&#39;s nice to know there is an outlier of goodness here."

If you don&#39;t hang out in capital hill, be warned that the parking situation sucks. We spent about 20 min driving round and round looking for parking. 

When we arrived at the restaurant, we were impressed. It was this cute and very trendy loft style restaurant. I quickly sat down to snag some seats because this place was happening. During the 45 min at the restaurant, there was a steady flow of people coming in and out. They surely had good business. Since it was so popular, I figured the food must have been really good. My husband ordered the quesadilla, pork/chicken/ and beef tacos, and the burrito. All of the items that we got did not taste very good because it tasted sour. It had a very tart flavor. A sour quesadilla just doesn&#39;t taste that great. I thought it was unique that they put pineapples inside the tacos but it all didn&#39;t taste well together. Also, every item was super soggy. So much excess fluid dripped out of our food. The food in itself wasn&#39;t that impressive. I was overall disappointed with the food. I don&#39;t quite understand why this place is so popular."

There was a line of 6-8 in front of us, though it moved pretty quickly. Finding a table was definitely more challenging. All the bar stools were taken. 4 top tables had 1 person dining in it, most of the time done eating and just hanging out. Meanwhile people were just standing waiting on someone to move. Completely anxiety provoking! Some people just started sitting at tables with random people, not asking or anything. Is that a thing??! 

Anyway, the food itself was good and inexpensive. I got one of the cactus tacos and a pollo burrito. Both were decent but not the best I&#39;ve had or anything. I haven&#39;t had cactus before. It&#39;s tasty but a little slimy (similar to okra texture). I preferred the burrito because I like flour tortillas better than corn. The chicken was diced fine. My only issue is both were extremely spicy. Not sure if it was the seasoning or it just happened to be the onion but very very spicy. 

Both were really good, but due to the limited seating and how busy they get, I probably won&#39;t return. Worth a shot trying once though. I just don&#39;t like fighting people for a table. Pass."

Both my tacos came with guac (which was NOT extra), cilantro, onions and salsa on corn tortillas. The adobada taco was topped with grilled sweet pineapple yassssss.

I honestly don&#39;t understand how these delish tacos are only ~$2/each because I&#39;ve definitely paid more for much worst. 

(Speaking of which, you can only pay by Square so it&#39;s a cash free zone)

I was definitely eyeing other people&#39;s plates - tortas, quesadillas and burritos and really had to fight the urge to line up again to overindulge.

The key is to go earlier or later as this place gets PACKED. It also takes some time to get through the line, so this is not the spot if you&#39;re looking for a quick meal. Seating is pretty limited, but I noticed many people taking items to-go or picking up their phone orders. 

Out of their three meat options, I&#39;d say the Adobada (pork) is my favorite, followed by the Pollo Asado (chicken) and then the Carne Asada (beef). While all the options were very flavorful and tasty, I think the grilled pineapple is what takes the Adobada over the edge. ;) As they&#39;re street-style tacos, I typically feel satisfied with ordering 3-4 tacos. 

If you&#39;re not a taco person (say wha?!), their menu also features items like tortas, quesadillas and mini burritos. I&#39;ve had friends order all three with positive reactions. I&#39;ve even had folks order different sides with their tacos, like the frijoles, where they literally served a plate of smoky beans, haha!

It&#39;s got the vibes of a hole-in-the-2nd-story-wall joint with tight eating space and horchata, but the vegetarian tacos let me down.

Tacos Chukis is hidden on the second floor, so if you&#39;re walking along Broadway, look for Ha Na the sushi place. Once you see it, turn into an arcade looking area with older stores. Your dinner joint will be on the second floor where you can see the line. It was very popular on the Friday night we visited!

I had the frijoles and nopales (cactus) tacos as well as a mini nopales burrito with cheese (add extra few cents). The beans were actually more flavorful compared to the cactus, which was a surprise. My friend loved her meat tacos, so I&#39;m guessing all of the stars are mainly going towards those orders. If you&#39;re a veggie eater, I&#39;d say dont&#39; get your hopes too high up, but there are options for you here...they just won&#39;t be exceptional like your meat eater friends&#39;. For dinner, I&#39;d say the pricing was more than generous, but I wouldn&#39;t say that I was stuffed after my two tacos and mini burrito.

You&#39;re lucky if you find seating, but we were able to grab two seats at bar seating once a couple left. I wouldn&#39;t come here with a large group since seating is a problem...but buying takeout seems to make more sense. They also have serve-yourself water, but no salsa station or chips to tide you over. Also, what kind of taco joint doesn&#39;t have tapatio or house spicy sauce? I asked for extra hot sauce, and a kind worker gave me a wistful look saying they didn&#39;t have it. 

You might call me a biased yelper, but California beats Washington in the taco game for now."

Holy smokes, this place is a hidden gem located upstairs in the very back of some building. There&#39;s a bunch of other restaurants nearby, but from the main street you would never see it unless you knew where to look. Thankfully my friend Leo brought me here to taste greatness! 

We ordered the Taco Chukis with Adobada (Al Pastor with a slice of grilled pineapple) and some baby burritos with Carne Asada. The wait is kinda long, but trust me it&#39;s worth! The baby burritos are small and cute, maybe the length of your hand, but they fill it with the good stuff, MEAT &amp; CHEESE! Other places try to fill you up with the cheap stuff (rice and beans) but not here! And the tacos, OMG these bad boys are loaded with meat. The al pastor mixes so well with the sweet grilled pineapple and green. For sure a MUST try when in town.

House Special ($2.25): My new favorite taco equipped with guacamole and pineapple, this is a party in your mouth. Get like 10 of these (just kidding, maybe like 2-3 and some for later)
Carne Asada: Delicious and how carne asada should be.
Pollo: Not dry and has flavor! 
Nopales: Cacus leaf taco - this was delicious and had the perfect amount of pickle and crunch! 
Adobada: Delicious adobo pork, honestly - can&#39;t go wrong with any meat filling at this place.

Located upstairs inside a mini-mall type of place off of Broadway, we found street parking easily and for free since it was a Sunday. The place is small itself and there was always a line! We found seating since it was two of us, but noticed a lot of people would just order to go. The workers here are SO FAST. Cranking out tacos like machines!!

Cheap and delicious eats in Seattle. 10/10 would recommend for a quick stop. Pro-tip: Got tacos to go to take on the plane back with me home. Do it, it&#39;s worth it."

Located on the second floor of a building, and semi hidden from the main busy Broadway street, this is definitely a place to stop by if you&#39;re craving for yummy tacos. Not only are the tacos filling, but all the prices on the menu are fairly cheap.

Went here after attending a UYE and was introduced to some fabulous tasting tacos. Got the classic taco chuki that had: plenty of meat, pineapple and a zesty like sauce with a small kick at the end. Summary of the taco? Absolutely yum. I devoured three and was sufficiently full.

Other items on the menu include a gigantic looking torta (sandwich), other types of tacos and a small variety of Mexican flavored drinks. The place itself is pretty small, casual with tables and seats. Be aware that it could be challenging to find a seat if you come during peak hours.

Overall, this is a definite must for anyone to try if you&#39;re in the mood for tacos. Ahhhh, I already miss my little chukis with the pineapple chunks!"

THIS place is as authentic as it can get...and the Socal in me can confirm that 200%, since I&#39;ve had my fair share of Mexican food.

Location is pretty easy to miss if you don&#39;t look..literally. It&#39;s situated near a Thai restaurant, and in between a bar and a brunch place. And nope...you don&#39;t just walk right in, you&#39;ve gotta climb to the second floor to a small wooden room! Talk about hole-in-the-wall! 

+1 They accept credit cards...no minimum! (They are also pretty high-tech with their ipad card readers) 
+1 Simple, short, beautiful menu. And did I mention tacos are only $1.90 each? (Except the specialty ones..) 

The &#34;nopal asado&#34;/&#34;nopales&#34; (aka cactus leaf) is seasonal, so unfortunately I couldn&#39;t try it this time! Ask anyways, if you want to be adventurous! 

Super simple menu. You choose a protein/filling and pick how you want it prepared! (Taco, torta, BABY-Burrito, etc.)

I ordered:
-1 adobada Torta // HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. I&#39;ve been in search for the best torta, and I finally found it! Bread is perfection, meat is succulent, great portion, and awesome sauces. Seriously. GET THIS. ONLY $6.90! 

-2 Tacos Chukis // House special, $2.25 each! YUM! So...I am completely satisfied with my other tacos, but it was nice to try their house special. It seems like the filling is more fatty meats (bacon..?) than actual meat, since there is more of a crunch. Regardless, pineapple balanced it well and the guac was yum!

-1 Taco Asada // Most places over cook this, but this place retains the precious beef juice!

-1 Taco adobada // YUMM. You can&#39;t ever go wrong with adobada! Perfectly seasoned and mouth-bursting pork juice! Only thing I would say is, I wish there was more lean meat than fatty.

-1 Taco Pollo // Chicken is always dried out but THIS is bursting with flavor! Delicious, if you don&#39;t like pork! 

Pros:
+Awesome menu! Can&#39;t express this enough.
+Quick service. We didn&#39;t have to wait too long...only about 10 minutes?
+Super clean! Most Mexican places are like a steam house. This place, you don&#39;t see any smoke drifting into the eating area! And you don&#39;t leave smelling like you rolled in carne asada!
+Great portion size...seriously. You will feel satisfied leaving this place.

Cons:
-Cheese is 50 cents per item?! Oh wells, it&#39;s okay. It would taint the flavors of the meat, anyways.
-Limited seating. Why don&#39;t you expanddddddd!!! 

Tips/Observations:
-The &#34;cheese shaker&#34; on the table? Actually a salt shaker. (WHOOPS....) 
-Bathroom is available! Get the key from the front cashier. 
-To-gos are available too!
-This place is busy all the time. There is no way of putting out the steam to this hot place!

Overall, love it! I miss it every time I look at the photos..is that weird?"

I didn&#39;t love the pollo asada, but the adobada and house special were great. The addition of the pineapple is wonderful. Fast, cheap (less than $2), and delicious meats. This will be one of my go tos and I can&#39;t wait to try their non taco items as well! It&#39;s kind of hidden - you have to walk inside this 2 story complex and walk upstairs to get to it; we definitely missed it the first time cause we walked right past the front door of the complex!"

This divey taco shop was walking distance from our AirBNB, and although we got a little lost trying to find it, it was worth the trouble and wait. If you use GPS, you&#39;ll need to walk upstairs to find Taco Chuki&#39;s (we wandered around for a bit at first). 

The line at Taco Chuki&#39;s was a little long but moved quickly. The menu is simple, with tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. You can choose from five different fillings for tacos, and my husband and I ordered one of each taco. Once you order, just have a seat (if you can find one) and place the number on your table. The wait staff will bring out your tacos.

I ate the vegetarian pinto bean taco and the also vegetarian nopales taco. The tacos aren&#39;t super big, so you&#39;ll want at least 2-3 of them to fill up. That&#39;s okay, because they&#39;re less than $2 each so you can try them all without breaking the bank! It was my first time trying nopales and I wish we could get it back home because it was tasty. It reminded me of green pepper meets okra, I guess. I really think the nopales and beans would be good together in a quesadilla or burrito of sorts, too.

The only con I can think of is that this place gets packed so it&#39;s hard to find a place to sit and relax. It also gets a bit loud. I wish there was a place nearby to take your food out and eat it. We walked almost a mile to get here, so we ate in and were glad we found a spot.

Even after tax and tip, our meal- for both of us- was about $12. We left happy and full, and it was one of the most memorable and delicious meals we had on vacation. I wish we could find authentic and inexpensive tacos like Taco Chuki&#39;s back home. I&#39;d definitely return if I&#39;m ever in the Seattle area again."

We stopped here on our way to the uw game and took the light rail from Tukwila. Friends have told me how good these tacos are and I&#39;ve been wanting to try them since this last summer. It was kinda busy when we got there so I  was thinking it would take awhile before getting our food, but nope it came fast. We got 7 house tacos and man they were everything that everyone talked about. My wife got 3 and I had 4. Most of the time I always get her leftovers, but not this time. They were so good she ate all 3. To top it off they have great beer to go with the tacos. Everyone know that you need beer with tacos. We enjoyed them and I hope you do to

I guess it was just a coincidence that I was craving tacos on a Tuesday. Tacos are one of the things that I normally don&#39;t crave but I really wanted some that day. Thankfully, my friend also started wanting tacos after I mentioned it.

First, finding this place can be a little tricky, especially if you&#39;re using GPS. GPS will tell you that you are there but you won&#39;t see the sign for the place. Tacos Chukis is located on Broadway street and you&#39;re going to have enter little mini mall store plaza looking environment and go up the stairs. That&#39;s where you&#39;re going to find Tacos Chukis. I spent a lot of time just looking at all the outside signs on the stores along the street wondering where the sign for Tacos Chukis was. 

There are a few tables and bar seating here, or you can easily take your tacos to-go as well. The menu is short and simple. You have your filling options as well as your option to go for a taco or a burrito. You really can&#39;t go wrong with all the fillings here. I tried the carne asada which was well seasoned steak. I also tried the pollo asado which was your chicken taco. I think this one was a tad bit dry, but still delicious. And lastly I tried the adobada which I thought was amazing. It&#39;s marinated pork and you get that delicious slice of pineapple in your taco too. This one was so, so freaking good. The addition of pineapple is amazing. They also have vegetarian options for tacos as well.

The horchata here is also pretty spot on if that&#39;s what you&#39;re craving. It&#39;s not overly sweet, but still has that cinnamon sweet goodness to it.

The best part: the cost. The tacos are so cheap. They&#39;re less than $2 and so I always feel like I can order a lot of tacos and not feel like my wallet is being attacked. 

If you&#39;re dining in, they&#39;ll give you a number and bring your tacos out to you. Suddenly, typing up this review is making my mouth salivate for some more tacos..."

It&#39;s a small and quaint second floor taco shop with a few tables and a tiny kitchen. Mad props to the guys who work in it all day! 

I&#39;m sad to say this place was okay. I had an assortment of tacos and it was all just okay, and I don&#39;t typically have super high expectations. Highlights were the green salsa (yum!) and the seasoning on the Adobada. I would possibly return if I was in the neighborhood, but honestly I might just walk around the corner and go to Neon Taco .  Or drive to Kent to Asadero Sinaloa. You&#39;ll thank me later."

The atmosphere is super casual, with small crowds throughout the day and Mexican music playing through the speakers. They offer a simple menu of tacos, small burritos, quesadillas and tortas (sandwiches). Whatever you get, add grilled pineapple to it.

tacos-chukis-seattle,Ashley S.,1w8iUS85yk5051KQomYTkg,"Seattle, WA",1,1,1,48,83,M2_ez5p0EQFD9nEnpu2-jQ,4.0,2016-07-18,"Inexpensive and tasty tacos. Don&#39;t go if you&#39;re in a rush as there seems to always be a line. Seating feels cramped, perhaps because the line ends up taking up a third of the seating area. I always end up finding a place to sit, but I haven&#39;t gone in a group larger than 2. Parties of 1 and 2 will probably fare better here than a larger group.

I&#39;ve been here a few times and have tried a good sampling of items. The menu is small - 5 choices of meat/fillings and a variety of preparations (tacos, burritos, tortas, etc.). I appreciate that they have 2 vegetarian fillings - nopales and pinto beans. My vegetarian bf finds these options acceptable (though isn&#39;t over the moon about them). I must say the meat options are superior. 

Vegetarian tacos:
I&#39;ve tried both the nopales and pinto beans (in tacos). Both fillings are a bit bland and end up being overpowered by the guac and salsa. The texture of the fillings do not add anything to the taco either. The texture of the nopales specifically could even turn some off - it is a bit slimy. I thought if I ordered them Taco Chukis style (with pineapple!) they may be improved. The last time I went I tried this. The meat tacos came out with pineapple, and the vegetarian ones did not. Disappointing. With how busy the place was, I didn&#39;t feel motivated to ask them about it. Will try again next time if I go with my veggie bf. 

Meat tacos:
As I mentioned previously, the meat tacos - for better or worse - are the tastier option. Both the adobada and pollo asado are delicious. I have not tried the carne asada, as I am not a huge steak person. I found the chicken and pork equally flavorful and they added a nice savory chew to the taco that the vegetarian fillings did not. The Taco Chukis preparation provides the best experience - savory meat, cheese, guac, sweet grilled pineapple and a squeeze of lime work together beautifully. One critique: why don&#39;t they make their own tortillas?? This isn&#39;t a hit on Tacos Chukis exclusively, as nearly everywhere I&#39;ve ordered tacos seems to be an offender. I&#39;m tired of store-bought tortillas! Gimme fresh!"

I tried three different things, including the house taco, a chicken quesadilla, and a baby steak burrito. Each one was better than the next. This is how Mexican food should taste! 

I had a Mexican Coke to wash everything down. Mmmm. 

The whole experience was probably about an hour long, so if you are in a rush, wait until you have some more time. 

I recommend, with absolutely no reservations, that you visit this taco joint that serves much more than just tacos..."

Takes a bit for them to cook it up and bring it out to you, you are probably going to be sitting there and wondering where your food is at then you realize that it&#39;s been a while.  But when we got our food, it was so good, so it was worth the wait.

I live in San Diego but really do not eat a lot of the typical mexican food. Pineapple is not for everyone on a taco (or a pizza) but I have eaten it before at Puesto and really enjoyed it.

The restaurant is located in Capital Hill. We found metered parking a block or two away. Neighborhood can have some crazies walking around. I didn&#39;t see any signs for the restaurant on the outside. It is in a building of multiple stores up on the second floor. I ordered 3 tacos chukis with pollo, carne asada and adobada. My friend and I both thought the adobada was the best meat that we tried. I really enjoyed the flavors of the guac, cheese and pineapple. The chukis are $2.25 each and a bit on the small side if you have a large appetite. My friend was happy to see horchata on the menu. Seating is limited but we found a few chairs at the bar near the counter. I would definitely go back."

Seating is also limited. There are only 2 tables that seat a group of 6 - most tables and booths are set up to serve 2-4 people. It looked like a lot of people were taking food to go though!

Our family of 5 ordered 10 Adobada tacos, 5 Taco Chuki specials, a mini burrito, and a few tortas. Food came out fast for how crowded the place was. 

Everything was exceptionally delicious! I&#39;d probably skip the mini-burrito and just order more tacos next time though. It didn&#39;t feel like anything special (though it was cheap, and full of meat). What makes Tacos Chukis special is that grilled pineapple so I&#39;d stick to ordering things that have it. The tortas had a generous portion of meat and the bread was buttery and soft. 

Note - Tacos Chukis also have Adobada as their meat. Didn&#39;t realize that before we ordered 15 tacos all with the same meat. That&#39;s okay though, they were all delicious!

Granted, I miss the Mexican in LA, but I wouldn&#39;t rank the tacos, quesadillas or imitation tortas anywhere near a quality Socal spot. I&#39;ve given it three shots already and I do not plan on coming back.

Horchata and agua fresas are good. Prices are good. Food and wait time is well below rating. If I had to come back I would get the adobada house taco with the guacamole and pineapple."

Perhaps, it was because it was cinco de mayo and the line was out the door. I expect a good place should be consistent but for $2 tacos, fine. 

The carne Asada tacos were chewy and a little over cooked. I would pass. The taco chukis was also over cooked but flavored well. 

The chicken quesadilla was the best thing I had there. It comes with guacamole and red sauce which cut through the rich cheese &amp; was a great compliment. 

For big eaters, I would recommend the baby burritos which have the same ingredients as the tacos, just bigger. It does not come with rice or beans.

The horchata was good but I prefer it with a little less spice &amp; cinnamon. I brought half of it home &amp; added milk &amp; it was perfect."

Thank God I did!! The food was better than I ever imagined. Coming from Los Angeles, where there&#39;s tons of great taco spots, I was a bit skeptical that this place would be anywhere near as good. Well I soon learned that it was!! This place is great!! I only wish I lived in Seattle or near this place!! I&#39;m actually craving this place right now, while writing this review!!! 

I had 5 tacos of Adobada aka AlPastor, which were great. My girlfriend also gave me a piece of her torta, also with Adobada meat..and omfg it was amazing! Best torta I&#39;ve had (and I&#39;m a Mexican who&#39;s had plenty of tortas lol). The tacos were also worthy of putting on my top 3 favorite spots for tacos.

I also ordered a baby burrito, they don&#39;t have regular size burritos which a bit weird, but I was curious to try one. The burrito wasn&#39;t worth it in my opinion. 

Final thought: If you live in or near Seattle, or simply visiting...I really recommend you check this spot out! I personally can&#39;t wait to go back to Seattle and eat here again.

Thanks Tacos Chukis"

It isn&#39;t anything fancy, but it&#39;s perfect for a quick bite in Capitol Hill. It&#39;s super cheap and honesty better than a lot Mexican restaurants in the area. 
The place is pretty small and packed with people, no surprise. The service is quick and efficient, and it&#39;s not too hard to find a table.

I&#39;ve been to places in San Diego and Mexico for authentic tacos and this place has made it right. I HIGHLY recommend just getting the chukis tacos, best bang for your buck. The carne asada is slightly more dry and isn&#39;t as juicy as the chukis. Otherwise, the chukis tacos will all come with pineapple on top. I haven&#39;t tried their quesadillas or sopas but then again, I&#39;m more of a taco lover. I would probably skip the horchata (has a sandy taste to it that makes it seem like they made it from powder) and if you want to avoid the line, just call in your order and skip to the front of the line to pay and get your food!"

I tried all 3 meat options, all tasty with my favorite being the beef and chicken. Really cant go wrong with either meat option as a taco, at 1.90 a taco its a tough deal to beat. 3 tacos had me satisfied.

The place is small so I would be careful trying to come with a large party, there are only a few small tables and it seams like the line that forms can eat up a lot of the space.

Super simple, small menu. Limited seating. I was told we had to wait 15-20mins for our food before I ordered. 

We tried..

2 house tacos aka &#34;Taco Chunkis&#34; which comes with adobada meat, melted cheese, guac + grilled pineapple -$2.25 each, YUM. Love their corn tortillas..soft but chewy texture. 
Baby burrito with carne asada -$3.33 

*Adobada is marinated pork cooked al pastor, topped with a slice of grilled pineapple.  

Drinks and water are self served. You throw your own trash and put your dishes away in a bin.

The menu is simple: you choose the form of your taco (mini burrito, taco, quesadilla, among others) and then choose the filling (chicken, beef, pork, etc.) Each order is ~$2, comes with a little garnish and a lot of filling. I usually get 3 tacos and 1 mini burrito for lunch and it totally fills up this voracious eater. 

The flavor of the meats are amazing - even the frijoles, which normally would be bland and boring, are bursting with flavor and are totally worth getting. Among the fillings, they have prickly pear cactus to eat, which a tasty and unique small bite to get while dining here.

My husband found the steak tacos to be just as delicious. I also got a chicken baby burrito. That was also fabulous. Everything is cooked perfectly and has wonderful flavors.

I was expecting a food truck but was pleasantly surprised to find a (very simple) sit down restaurant. 

There is street parking only, but go on a Sunday (when street parking is free) and you will eventually find a place.

The restaurant itself is on the smaller side and doesn&#39;t have tons of seating, particularly for larger parties. (So ditch your friends and come enjoy this for yourself or with just one other person - haha) The menu is also pretty small - with a variety of entrees like a baby burrito, tacos (of course), quesadilla, etc. Then you pick from a list of meats! 

The food is delicious. All the meats I tried were great, unlike other taco places where usually one of them is bland, one too chewy, etc. I would continue getting a variety in the future because I can&#39;t pick one. Surprisingly, the sauces are quite spicy. I wasn&#39;t quite expecting it but after eating my whole plate I was really feeling the burn. I consider myself able to eat moderately spicy foods just fine but for some reason this felt super spicy after a few bites! The baby burrito is just adorable for how small it is, but it was not as good as the tacos. The pineapple and salsas really make a difference. 

All the employees I interacted with were super nice. I noticed that they are very slow from the time you order to when you get your food though. I guess this means they make everything fresh but the wait time is not what you would expect. Take out orders were also very slow. It was filled but not so crowded, so I would not come if you are in a huge rush and there already seems to be a line. 

Compared to nearby Rancho Bravo or TNT Taqueria over in Wallingford or El Camion, this takes the cake (or taco?) for best tacos. So happy to have found this place. A must try."

I ordered a carne asada &amp; taco chukis. The carne asada taco was $1.60 and the taco chukis (with the pineapple) was $2.25. You order and grab a number, then they deliver it to your table.
SUPER GOOD TACOS. The carne asada is beautifully cooked and even has a crisp to it. The guacamole tastes so fresh, and the corn tortillas are also on point. Everything about the taco was so perfect, and the best part? It was not greasy at all! Other taco places I&#39;ve been to usually have grease dripping and oozing out onto my hands.

Went yesterday with a few friends and decided to go early (11:45).  Glad we did, because as we were eating, the line went out the door!  The tacos are prepared pretty quickly, fortunately.  All four of us ordered 3 tacos each.  Not sure how quick/yummy the burritos or other options are.  

I got two pork/pineapple regular tacos (as opposed to their Taco Chukis taco which as I understand it, is the same but with cheese), and one carne asada one.  At $1.90 each, these are quite the bargain for the quality and flavor you get.  They&#39;re your food truck sized tacos, so they&#39;re small, but still, can&#39;t beat $1.90.  The meat (both pork and beef) is well flavored, and just the perfect amount for the size of tortilla.  With the pork you get a nice sized piece of pineapple that is marinated and grilled.  Oh boy!  That was the best.  Sprinkle some minced onion and cilantro, and a dollop of guacamole that brings the whole thing together, and there you have it!  Perfection.

Clean menu, simple but offers enough variety to really get a taste of street food done right! I ordered the house taco which is $2.55 &amp; I ordered an adobada taco for $1.90, a mulita and my jamaica! 

Everything is freakin BOMB! Like, fresh, excellent quality, and seriously refreshing. From the salsa, so mild, i wish it was hotter but it tastes so freakin good, to the fresh meat that was tender and not overcooked. 

I definitely recommend the house taco! It was so good. And the adobada meat is really flavorful and tender. The pollo asada was good but a little overcoooked, in my opinion. Nonetheless, it was still really, really good. The grilled pineapples are seriously perfection! So sweet and ripe yet so much sweeter grilled! Definitely was the icing to the taco cake. Salsa is superb, the onions and cilantro are also really fresh and excellent crunch.

- Get the house tacos: pretty much choose your meat and then house tacos comes with sauce and cheese $2.25 each 
- The adobada is delish and so is the carne asada! 
- Quesadilla ~$3 
- Cute little restaurant 

Prior to my trip here, I had always sworn that the best tacos came from my favorite truck in East LA as well as any Mexican restaurant in San Diego... But all of my favorites have officially been dethroned... because Tacos Chukis is simply the best! 

Not only do the tacos look super delicious... but they are super flavorful and as the bf said, &#34;Finger-licking good!&#34; 

Definitely make a stop here, you won&#39;t regret it!"

Why would I want tacos when I can have a good hearty bowl of ramen or plate of creamy pasta?  Only after Tacos Chukis did I realize the years of Mexican goodness I&#39;ve been missing out on.

From rather unfortunate past taco experiences, the shells of tacos usually killed the delicious fillings inside for me because they are either too hard for a softshell or too doughy.  Tacos Chukis, though.. ermgaerd.  The corn tortillas are perfect and the homemade marinated pork with onions, cilantra, and guac are completed with the tastiest pineapple bits ever.  There was just so much flavour and each part of the taco could be deconstructed to stand as its own little explosion of taste buds. 

The baby burrito with fillings I don&#39;t quite recall was also delicious.  This might make for a non-descript review but this place is 100% a hidden gem that changed my previously uneducated view on tacos.  Taco &#39;bout A+ food esp for the low $$ you&#39;re getting these at."

I was craving tacos, looked to Yelp and was not disappointed! I had two tacos adobados (marinated pork al pastor style) which comes with a slice of grilled pineapple (I love it!) and guacamole. I also ordered a pollo asado with guacamole. Both were fantastic. So fantastic that I ordered another adobado and carne asada with extra guacamole. 

Tip: a little hard to find as its upstairs in a mall kinda thing but worth the search!"

First of all, at how many places now a days is guacamole actually INCLUDED in the price of the taco/burrito?  I&#39;m just saying, for $2.25 you get their bomb house taco which has their homemade guacamole but also, and most importantly, the little square of pure gold aka grilled pineapple on top. My second time back I didn&#39;t even bother with anything else, the taco chuckis all the way.

These are by far the best tacos I have found in Seattle.  The place has an awesome vibe, the menu is simple and the service is fast.  And they have cheap mexican beer.  So this is a 5 star joint in my book."

Sure enough upon arrival, the line is out the door which is a good sign that people are willing to wait for their food. We take a look at their menu to plan what we wanted to get. Keep in mind the menu list is small, like less than 10 items small. Yet that small menu list is generating long line of customers.

My wife and I ended up getting 3 house tacos (wish we got more) and a carne asada mini-burrito. The price of everything was very cheap. For less than $25 we got 6 house tacos, 2 mini-burritos and a Agua Fresca drink...not bad!

My first bite of the house tacos was immediate tasteful glory. So much flavor in one taco! The experience was amazing. Even though that one taco blew my mind I look down at my plate in sadness because I realized I only had two left...wish I got more. As for the mini-burrito, it was good too but after eating one of the house tacos your taste buds gravitate to more house tacos.

So remember there are regular tacos and there is the amazing house tacos...don&#39;t get them mixed up, you wanna get the house tacos.......HOUSE TACOS!!!

Just a fair warning, the wait time is about 45 min to an hour to get your food if the line is out the door, but it is so worth the wait. I felt bad to the people that walked upstairs to run into a long line and then walked back downstairs because they were missing out on some great food.

Just typing all this review is really making want to go back today and get more of those house tacos.

Yes, its that great!

Happy Eats Everyone!!"

I&#39;ve never had tacos this delicious. I&#39;ve waited to try Tacos Chukis and I cannot BELIEVE I waited this long. It&#39;s a tiny gem hidden in the upstairs next to Laughing Buddha (tattoo place). The space is small but cozy and has both window seating and tables. 

Now the tacos. I had the carne asada taco and the house taco (tacos chukis taco). Honestly I can&#39;t decide which one is my fav because they&#39;re both so good and have very distinct flavors! The carne asada taco has a deep smoky flavor and the meat was perfectly seasoned! It was a little spicy. There carne asada taco is made up of: thinly sliced steak, cilantro, onion, and guacamole! The tacos chukis taco was more spicy and the meat was a little more juicy. A tacos chukis taco consists of pork adobada, cilantro, onion, guacamole, and topped with a slice of beautiful grilled pineapple! 

Come to Tacos Chukis. You will not regret it."

Some of the best tacos in Seattle. The tacos are authentic street tacos that are small, but full of flavor. They&#39;re simple with nothing crazy on them, but the meat is extremely flavorful. The menu is simple, essentially picking a type of meat and what vehicle (taco, burrito, torta, etc.).

The service is quick, nothing to write home about. Despite the crowd, you usually get your food in less than 15 minutes once you order. 

The decor is simple and the atmosphere is usually pretty lively since there&#39;s always a manageable crowd.

I have been let down a few times, to find them close even though their posted hours (online, on door) say their open. That&#39;s about the only issue I have with this place."

The line seems like it can get long at random times, but maybe due to people getting in line in drones.

On my last visit, I got a horchata, had a bite of the house taco and got a quesadilla with carne asada in it as well.  Both were great and I was satisfied!  Items with nopal are pretty good too for those vegetarians out there.  The torta looks very appetizing as well... I might have to try that sometime. 

Back to the point of Tacos Chukis being affordable, I had gotten in line and ordered for a friend as well.  When I brought her total $ back, her reaction was, &#34;That&#39;s it?!&#34;  Speaks volumes!"

The moment we took a bite of their signature tacos (tacos chukis) and their tortas, we looked at each other in ACTUAL AMAZEMENT.  We used to live in CA, and have been going to the same taqueria for the past 5 years or so, since nothing has beat it.  And I could probably say that Tacos Chukis is now my ultimate favorite mexican joint!  Obsessed with their signature tacos and their adobada tortas!  It is just a little difficult to find parking since it is on the main street.

This place wasn&#39;t too busy when we got there but it took about 15 minutes to get our order (2 tacos and a mini burrito). After that, the place got packed so I cant imagine how much longer the wait to get food was."

I&#39;m really sadden that Seattle doesn&#39;t have good Mexican food, I have to take trips to cali to get that. 

The parking was great, location is hard to get out being that it&#39;s next to a bus stop on going traffic. The only thing that set this spot different from other taco stands/trucks is the sauces was in a nice sauce container very sanitary.

Boy, this place used to be good, but the last time I came here, the meat was seriously dried out. The tacos, which rely entirely on the meat for any flavor and juiciness, had precisely none. In fact, everything here is pretty simply made with just a couple ingredients, and so relies heavily on the meat for flavor. And that&#39;s the problem: the meat is very, very inconsistent, and has been even more so over the years.

I ordered delivery through Caviar - 6 tacos de lengua and 1 Rancho burrito with carnitas. The burrito was small, squashed and poorly wrapped with large gaps along the sides. My husband asked me, &#34;Did you order me a baby burrito?&#34; Each ingredient was smooshed to one side instead of incorporated evenly. There were also very large chunks of raw onion - yuck. My tacos weren&#39;t bad; the meat was tender, but bland. They tacos de lengua that I&#39;ve ordered from the Fremont location on two occasions were amazing little flavor explosions, so I can&#39;t understand why the ones from Wallingford were so underwhelming. The radishes were sliced way too thick. The red and green salsas were tasty, but the orange salsa tasted like water. The overall meal was, to put it in the words of Trump, &#34;sad&#34;."

If you wanna bet money on GOOD tacos don&#39;t go to a sit down restaurant!! My theory of finding the tastiest tacos from a take out window or truck still stands strong and Rancho Bravos just validated that!  i have been looking for some tasty carne asada tacos in Seattle for a while and while I&#39;ve tried a few places I always left the place like meh that was ok .. But the seasoning on this taco meat was good! I ate 2 past 8:30pm (I don&#39;t eat past 7! But I thought these were worth it lol) as my roomie said these tacos are legit cuz they only serve it to you with just cilantro onions and a radish! Lime and salsa come with it to of course ;).

Excellent.  Good flavor, good value.  However, the carne asada was SO SALTY.  I felt like I was eating straight up salt.  My friend tried the al pastor and said it was also salty.  She agreed that the chicken was the best.  The saltiness drowned out the flavor.  That being said, I will be back and I will probably try the burrito next time.  We got here around 6:30 on a dreary, rainy Saturday night and there was quite a line by the time we left.  Must be good."

When you do visit, think food truck atmosphere. This isn&#39;t a sit down restaurant. Being a bit cool with the weather at the moment, bring a coat, but it&#39;s worth it.

So I&#39;m getting closer to finding simply outstanding Mexican food.

Ate here with the hub who confessed that he had known about this place for a month and failed to tell me so and pretended like he tried to get me to come here but I kept turning him down.  What a load of crap!

So we came here for din din and it seriously looked legit.  The cashier barely spoke English.

The hub ordered 3 carnitas tamales.  I ordered one carne asada taco and one carnitas taco and my eyes ordered a plate of carne asada nachos.  We ordered 2 drinks but the cashier only heard me order one.

Yeah, if you played your music a tad bit lower, you might hear your customers.  After everything I said she replied with &#34;huh&#34;?  First of all, it&#39;s &#34;excuse me?&#34; or &#34;can you repeat that, please?&#34;  &#34;Huh&#34; is for barnfolk.

The tamales were excellent but had a slight flavor to them that I had never tasted before.  Yeah, I know, someone else&#39;s gramma.

The nachos were a little on the bland side as were the tacos.  

There&#39;s a sketchy little tented seating area where we ate.  We had the pleasure of dining next to some foul-mouthed bros.  Yeah, aren&#39;t your parents proud that you discuss your balls and quality of your bowel movements in public in a sort-of restaurant-ish place.

I wanted to put some hot sauce on my tacos but there was only mild sauce on our table and I didn&#39;t want to interrupt the highly intellectual conversation that was happening at the bro table to bug them for the hotter sauce.

All in all, the whole experience was a step closer to finding some SoCal slash practically Mexico style Mexican food.  I will definitely come back as the prices at this establishment are awesome, but I will be definitely be taking my food to go."

My Mexican grandmother used to make them when I was growing up and those will always be my favorite. But these were almost as good. The burrito on the other hand was unbelievable. I got the steak with black beans. The steak was seasoned and cooked so perfectly! About the size of a chipotle burrito but better. And the rest of the ingredients were fresh and delicious also. Definitely will be coming back to try the tacos, and possibly another burrito.

For $2.45 each, the price wasn&#39;t bad compared other places I have visited in Seattle. Rancho Bravo definitely has a more authentic feel and taste compared to Taco Time and Qdobo (the first two places that came to my mind), but overall I thought it was just okay. Here&#39;s the breakdown:

Carne asada taco
-Not too fatty, which is always a plus for me.
-A little dry, which I fixed with their green salsa. IMO, the best tacos taste great even without salsa.
-By itself, the meat tasted a little bland. Nothing too memorable but far from bad. I would have liked the meat to be a little more seared at the edges (just a personal preference) because, after all, carne asada literally means &#34;grilled meat&#34; (specifically beef).

Al pastor taco
-Less dry compared to the carne asada and a tad bit spicier (which is to be expected). Other than that, nothing too memorable but definitely not bad.

Overall, the service was good and the food came out quickly (less than 5 minutes). They also included some limes with the tacos, which I appreciated. 

Would I come here again? Maybe, but not in the near future. I&#39;ll have to try out a few more taco places first before determining which one(s) I like best."

Recently they took over the eyesore that was the closed down Winchell&#39;s doughnuts so they now have lots of room to make their food.  With that said they still only have the tents that serve as the outdoor seating, but that will never stop me from coming here.

Three things are a must - quesadilla al pastor, tacos con lenguas, and tacos con asada!  The quesadilla is loaded with cheese, onions, tomato, and the spicy pork that is al pastor.  The lengua seems intimidating while reading on a menu, but be adventurous and you may find that you&#39;ll actually enjoy the tender cut of meat.

Both times I went, I chose the extremely generic chicken quesadilla. Perhaps sometime in the future I&#39;ll get something different, but you can&#39;t really go wrong with the quesadilla - lots of chicken, lots of cheese, and peppers/onions - not to mention some great salsa options.

Without a doubt, this unassuming mobile taqueria is one of the greatest finds produced in a Winchell&#39;s Donut parking lot in the history of mankind.   What it lacks in ambiance (as in tarp covered sticky card tables with collapsable chairs) it makes up for in tasty and plentiful mexican food.

All tacos are good (we tried the lengua, carne, chicken mole, and fish) but stand outs include the carnitas and the carne asada tacos, which have fantastic crisped bits, and meld well with the red chipotle salsa you&#39;ll find at the table (or try the green salsas, which look very good.)  All tacos are stuffed with onion, cilantro, radish &amp; accompanied with lime wedges.  Their burritos are huge, but towards the overly salty side.

This place has nothing doing in terms of ambiance, and even boasts a slight &#34;ew&#34; factor, but its up there in terms of easy and delicious street food. As a frequent past eater in the MIssion (San Francisco), San Diego and Southern California (and no, this Rancho is not So.

Oh little nondescript truck in questionable parking lot.. thanks for being there! Came here in a moment of hangriness and lezzbereal, friends, when one is hungry, anything one eats will taste monumentally better. I came here and thought it was - for the 15-20 minutes I spent eating the food - the best thing ever. And was it really? Probably not, but i was under the influence of hunger and that can cloud judgment. 

We ordered the chicken tamale, rice and bean bowl with carne asada, and the large chicken quesadilla. My efforts were mainly focused on the tamale and the bowl.

I LOVE TAMALES. I love everything wrapped in husks because it&#39;s like a mystery to me every time, even though I know every single time what&#39;s in there. This tamale was solid. I will add the disclaimer that I think tamales in general are all around wonderful and I&#39;ve never had a bad one anywhere. so....

My bowl had black beans (choice of black or pinto), tomatoes, cheese, onions, LOTS of cilantro, and my meat of choice was carne asada.  Regular portions - not too big, not too small. Sauces given to us were mildly forgettable. Carne asada was alright - I have had better.

Nevertheless, if you&#39;re in the area, want a quick grub, and don&#39;t want no fuss, this is your place!"

These tacos were awesome. They are HUGE! At a normal taco truck I get probably 4 tacos but here, I&#39;d say the equivalent is 2. Very good carne asada and overall flavor was great.

The service is a bit underwhelming, but I guess for the price and food, it&#39;s clearly worth it."

For the first time I had the soft taco, pork and beef. Both delicious! I think the pork tastes better, granted I has the beef the day after the the tortilla was hard. 

From their other location, I&#39;ve had their chicken taquitos  (which I believe they have shrunk in size) it comes with a bed of salad with tomatoes and cheese on top of the taquitos. Very good! 

Had their pork posole and it&#39;s decent. It is served with homemade tortilla, radish, onions, cilantro and lime wedge. Sometimes it&#39;s greasy though! 

Their quesadilla is good as well. Definitely will be back to both places!"

I got a chorizo taco, a chicken tamale and a side of the sweet plantains and the only thing I would do differently next time would be to get 2 tacos and skip the tamale. It was a fine tamale, but the chorizo taco was SO GOOD. Their house salsas are also perfectly spicy and flavorful and the plantains were a yummy sweet treat to break up the day of savory food.

I ordered the rancho burrito with steak and then two tacos with chicken on them.  The chicken in the tacos had way too much pepper on them, and I like pepper, and not that it tasted bad but that and the cream sauce or whatever it was just took all of the flavor away from the chicken.  

I also ordered the steak rancho burrito, it like most mexican restaurants, put all rice and beans into the burrito with very little meat.  I also ordered a side of guacamole to be put in my burrito and there wasn&#39;t much more than a spoonful of it and it tasted creamy and possibly store bought.  All in all the food wasn&#39;t terrible, but I&#39;m guessing that most of the reviewers on here tried this food after having a drink or three too many and that could be the reason for so many positive reviews.  

I might go back if I&#39;d been out and had a few too many and had a case of the munchies on the way home from a bar, but would I go out of my way to come back here?  Eh, definitely not.  Maybe some time later down the road I&#39;ll give it another shot but with nowhere to sit, no salsa bar and so on, I think not. I much prefer Taqueria el Antojo in Lynnwood amongst other places.  They have cheaper tacos for $1.25 each, with more meat and that are more authentic and taste better too.  They have indoor seating, a salsa bar and handmade tacos"

I reheated mine a few days later, and it was delish.  They put a LOT of chicken into my portion, which was great!

I haven&#39;t really been to other Mexican places in Seattle yet, so for now this place will stay at 4 stars, subject to change by comparison haha.

The burritos aren&#39;t very good and not quite big enough to be a meal.  2/3 the size of one at most burrito joints although also a bit cheaper.  The menu could use a few more options.  

To each their own, but I can find much better taco/burrito options in N. Seattle starting with El Camion and Gorditos.

Best: Burritos are literally a different world from what you would get at a chain...they are fantastic. 

Good: Meat seems to be fresh and flavorful, that&#39;s something I always watch out for, the quality of the meat. 

Could be better: The mild salsa, they have none. We made the mistake of getting mild one time and I swear it was hotter than your normal hot sauce.

There was no problem getting a table for two on a Tuesday around 7 for dinner.

The interior is nice. I like the big windows and the bar.

For drinks I got the fig shrub... because I love figs and it was also one of the cheaper featured cocktails at $10... a couple of the others that sounded good to me were $14, yikes! But anyway, my shrub included rum (dark, I think) and a mixture of vinegar, sugar, and figs, I&#39;m guessing, based on what a shrub is. It was served over ice with a fresh fig slice garnish. You can definitely taste the rum and vinegar. Definitely meant for sipping... slowly. I enjoyed it but would probably try another drink next time to switch things up.

For my dinner I ordered the portobello sandwich with a side salad. For your side, you get to choose between a green salad, fries, or a small cup of soup. It&#39;s nice to have a few options. The salad itself was good, but not amazing. I appreciated how the dressing, a sour beer vinaigrette, was served on the side. The salad itself was topped with croutons, tomatoes, and pickled onions. I tried a bite of the seasonal pumpkin bisque made with veg stock and coconut milk. It was thick, creamy and pleasant. The real winner was my sandwich. Dang it was so much better than I was expecting! Great flavors and textures. Yum. I probably demolished it in under 5 minutes. The sandwich includes marinated portobello mushrooms, hazelnut pesto, roasted red pepper, avocado, arugula, gruyere, and caramelized onion. I would definitely come back to order that again. I didn&#39;t try the burger but it looked super juicy and pretty fat, in a good way.

Service was standard, no complaints."

I think we got there a little before or around noon. We parked on the street, parking can be a little rough, it was pretty busy when we walked up. We were greeted by the hostess and she said a 2 top just cleared and we could be seated pretty soon. Score! From the outside, it looked like there was going to be a wait, guess the groups were larger than a party of 2. 

We ordered:
- Country Fried Steak with scrambled eggs
- Eggs Benedict (consisted of a cheese biscuit, fried chicken, poached eggs, and cream cheese hollandaise sauce)

The benny was a bit different this time, but it was delicious! They ask you what kind of meat you want on it, which I gave the server a questionable look because usually it comes with ham. But she recommended the fried chicken, so I went with it. Oh man, was that the right choice! I mean, the benny didn&#39;t seem like a real benny but it was tasty. I didn&#39;t try the country fried steak but from the looks of my friend&#39;s plate, he enjoyed it too. 

If you&#39;re ever around the area, give this place a try, breakfast, lunch, or dinner!"

I&#39;ve tried both the chicken &amp; waffles, and biscuits &amp; gravy! Both of them are amazing - and definitely recommend both dishes. When the chicken and waffles first come out, they are definitely intimidating, but just know that you CAN eat it all! The waffles are fluffy, thick and decadent, and the chicken is nicely breaded and spiced. The maple syrup adds a nice touch, but definitely think the sausage gravy is a overkill for this kind of dish. I had food coma for a couple hours following this meal! 

2nd time around, I got the biscuits and gravy! Now this is where the sausage gravy really belongs. The biscuits are buttery and delicious, the bacon perfectly crisped, and the scrambled eggs so fluffy! This dish alone deserves 5 stars! That might of been my hangover talking, and there are so many Seattle places that serve this up, but there was just something that stood out about this dish. 

I&#39;ve tried some of their ciders, beers, and I&#39;ve had a couple of their cocktails (Corpse Reviver #2, May Day, Kin Kan). Their cocktails are amazing, and are even at a reasonable price point. Definitely a must visit if you are in the area!"

They have their chicken and waffle special for $5 off making them $11. We were seated promptly and the staff was friendly. It&#39;s all 21+ here so the crowd was great. We had a large party and there wasn&#39;t a large enough table to accommodate, but they sat us at two adjacent tables until a large table cleared off which the promptly moved us to once the previous party was finished. This is something that was cool and I appreciated.

We all ordered chicken and waffles with the added egg ($3) and bacon inside the waffle ($3). I also opted to get a pretzel to share with the table. 
The pretzel was great, freshly made with great mustard and beer cheese sauce. Our chicken and waffles came out fast too which was awesome. The waffle was massive and they gave you 4-5 pieces of boneless chicken. It looked great. The plate also came with and awesome gravy, bourbon syrup, and applesauce. 

Everything tasted great. Everyone really enjoyed their plates. I got an order of chicken and waffles to go for my boyfriend and they did not honor the happy hour Thursday pricing so with the eggs and bacon add on it was $25. Pretty pricey if you asking me. I would come back here again, but it&#39;s definitely not a place I would come to often based off the price. My bill was $60 for two orders of chicken and waffles with bacon and eggs, 1 beer, and a pretzel."

Honestly, a solid choice would be the chicken and waffles. No doubt. The bourbon infused maple syrup makes it less sweet and more savory, which caters to both the fried chicken and the waffle. And the gravy adds that extra umph. So good!!"
burgundian-seattle,Trisha F.,4pSiWVU4Ffu0w9K3l51OQQ,"Seattle, WA",1,1,1,245,144,5TlbzZLRLdqMQ9gG2XUchw,3.0,2015-12-27,"I so wanted to love the Burgundian. It is close to home, has lovely ambiance, and our service last night was impeccable. All the good aside, I have never had to salt a plate of food I paid so much for in my entire life. Well, other than yesterday. 

It started out so well. I had gotten a gift certificate here for my birthday a few months ago, so on a rare kid-free night we set off (the Burgundian is 21+ at all times, even during brunch). We chose the bacon and brussels and soft pretzel for apps, ordered a cider and a beer. 

Our server was charming and attentive and the drinks and apps came out pretty quickly. My cider was awful-- a Riebela, which was described as being from Spain and &#34;weird.&#34; I should have used that as a red flag and gone with something else-- but it came and was flat and tasted of dill? Olive juice? Just completely repugnant. Luckily my boyfriend has an iron stomach, so we happily finished it and I ordered an Eden. Perfection.

The food was also okay, still. The Brussels sprouts and bacon were amazing-- small bits of thick cut bacon that I almost believed was pork belly, the ratio of veggie to meat was perfect, they were cooked to perfection. It is also a big serving for $8. The $6 pretzel comes with beer cheese and is okay. I didn&#39;t try the mustard because I don&#39;t like  it, but the cheese was very bland. The pretzel is soft and really good, but alone is pretty boring. It would have been better crusted with kosher salt, since the table salt they used was so sparse I could barely taste it in dense pieces of dough. 

SO didn&#39;t see anything on the big plates menu, so he got the sauteed greens and wings. I went with the sole. Would have really loved to know the sole was breaded. It came on a bed of brussels sprouts and fingerling potatoes, some micro greens scattered on top and a beautiful presentation of lemon slices. Thank goodness for that lemon, since there was hardly a trace of the brown butter it lists as the first thing after fish on the menu (brown butter, brussels sprouts, roasted fingerlings, lemon). The major upside to this dish is the amount of fish-- I got two large, thin fillets. The potatoes were good, the brussels seemed undercooked and flavorless. I had to salt the entire plate and squeeze lemon all over it. Really underwhelming for a $20 dish.

The wings and greens were good. They were a small order-- 4-5 wings with a Chinese fast food type flavor/glaze and copious amounts of chili flakes. The greens are also really chili heavy, so keep that in mind when ordering. Luckily we enjoy spice. I felt like the small plates were not worth their price tags. 

Overall I would definitely come back. The service is so friendly and frequent and there are strong points on the menu, I&#39;d like to try more and see whether they outweigh the blah. The brunch menu looks great, and they serve items from it all day long! The outdoor seating is also really cute."

They have happy hour from 3-6pm and a pretty decent happy hour menu. We didn&#39;t end up making it on time though so we ordered from the regular dinner menu and got a few drinks.

Food:
Chicken and waffles - Everyone was talking about this on yelp so about half our table got it. Honestly, it&#39;s mediocre at best. You have the option of adding bacon with the waffle batter for $3 more (which I did) and the option of adding eggs. The fried chicken is more like fried chicken strips (thinner pieces of chicken than what I had imagined). The one thing they have going for them though, the sausage gravy - its the only thing i dipped my waffle and chicken in. They give you a side of some apple sauce butter but it doesn&#39;t go well with the rest of it.

Mussels - very light flavor, the soup was tasty but I&#39;ve definitely had better. Good portion size with enough mussels to fill you up.

Service: Great service with our server. Was nice enough to split our bills in pairs when we had a group of 8+ people! Was always on it with our drinks. I forgot his name but if I remembered it I would give him props!"

We had 6 people on a Wednesday night at 8:00pm. For seating they only gave us the option of sitting at the bar. Finally after some finagling we crammed into a booth. 5 min after ordering our drinks they asked for ids - one member had left hers at the house. Our server told us that she couldn&#39;t serve her - completely understandable. 10 min later our server came back and said &#34;so what did we decide to do?&#34;. We started ordering food and were interrupted. She continued to passively state that she in fact could not serve us AT ALL because the whole place was 21+. Would have been nice to know this before we waited for 15 min.

On the recommendation of my fellow yelpers, we decided to try this spot. Oh. My. Goodness.

First off, this is a 21 &amp; up establishment, a bonus for us as we rarely get to go out to eat in non &#34;family-friendly&#34; places these days.

Atmosphere was low key, comfortable, but nice. Staff friendly and recommended some tasty vittles.

The food was just plain good. Hubs had the chicken and waffles, AMAZIIIING. I&#39;m not a big fried chicken fan, but good golly miss molly, this chicken could change my view.

I had the cornbeef hash and it was equally delicious. The chef has got a great touch with the seasoning and the whole menu looks intersting and fresh.

I&#39;m looking forward to coming back here again, I can&#39;t wait to try some other dishes."

We came for happy hour, which has a great menu with better beers.  The beer list is very, very good with a long list of crafts.  There will be a beer you haven&#39;t tried before, as well as ones you love.  I ended up trying different IPAs from California and Colorado, and my boyfriend had some different European Belgians.  

For food we ordered the happy hour chicken and waffle and mussels and baguette.  The chicken and waffle was really good, so I recommend ordering the dinner portion instead of the happy hour as you will want to keep eating it, especially with the country gravy or apple-vanilla jam that it comes with.  The chicken was flavorful and juicy, but was just a tad heavy on the breading for my liking.  The waffle was light and fluffy.  The mussels were also good, but not as much as the chicken and waffle.  It came in a heavier white broth sauce with chunks of ham and a side of baguette slices. 

There is plenty of street parking nearby, and our server was very friendly and had great recommendations for beer.  I&#39;ll be back to try more menu items, and especially for the beers."

It&#39;s comfortable, the food and drinks are always good, and it&#39;s juuust not well known enough that I don&#39;t have to drive around for ever looking for parking or wait forever for a table.

To start, the food is amazing. Literally everything I&#39;ve ever eaten here is outstanding. And unlike some of the other little high brow gastropub type places in Seattle, a meal here is actually totally filling and reasonably priced. If you get small plates to share with drinks there is actually enough to share around the table. My standbys tend to be the biscuits and gravy or chicken and waffles, but there&#39;s nothing I wouldn&#39;t recommend.

The one big con is that, while the servers are always prompt and attentive and all, more often than not the servers can be a little snooty. I mesh with this place in that I get the feeling that me and the folks who work here are on the same level of snootiness about alcohol, but that&#39;s not going to be true for everyone and even me being on board with it doesn&#39;t shield me from it all the time.

Once I was on the receiving end of this in a funny (to me) way when I asked if I could get a pisco sour and the sever suggested something off the cocktail menu that was a pisco sour variant with some fruit juices. This was a while ago so these quotes are approximate, but I asked &#34;wouldn&#39;t that be sweet?&#34; He looked insulted and said very gravely, &#34;nothing on our menu is sweet.&#34;

He&#39;s right, though: their menu of cocktails are always great, and if that&#39;s not your bag they have both a killer beer selection and killer liquor selection for whatever you&#39;re into. They don&#39;t have a really robust wine list but if that&#39;s your area of interest it&#39;s respectable enough that I don&#39;t think you&#39;d be disappointed."

We&#39;re so glad we went on Thursday night when this signature dish is $5 off. That makes it $11 instead of $16.

The verdict? Decent to good. Portion size of the chicken was smallish and a bit overcooked. Waffle was good and crispy. Syrup was actually TOO boozy. I could hardly use it. Funny thing is the sausage gravy may have been the best part of the whole dish. All in all, it hit the spot but did not wow me in any way.

So if you&#39;re hankering for chicken and waffles and can&#39;t get down to Rainier, go here on a Thursday night. I definitely would not pay $16 for this dish, but at $11, it&#39;s not bad for eating close to Green Lake."

POUTINE w/ OXTAIL GRAVY
not enough gravy, no cheese curds, and extremely salty. Sadly oxtail is in the name, but no sight or taste of any oxtail meat.

FRIED CHICKEN &amp; WAFFLES
came with about 4/5 small pieces of fried chicken that had a nice crispy breaking and juicy meat on the inside. The waffle is light and fluffy. You can add bacon to it too. It&#39;s nice because they chop it up and mix it with the waffle batter. Piece of bacon in every bite!!"

While I can live without their fried chicken most days (I&#39;ve had better elsewhere), the bacon in the waffle is simply brilliant. I will never ever complain about that. 

Papas con Chorizo is alright, I guess. I don&#39;t remember much about it. 

Bloody Mary is far too basic for my liking. I like mine nicely spruced up and with a good kick, and theirs is just really plain. I still drank all of it, psh.

Service -- good. No issues.

I&#39;m just now realizing how truly unenthused I am about this restaurant all in all, even though I don&#39;t have any passionately negative feelings about it. It was really just okay.

We walked in and was seated immediately. We all ordered the chicken and waffle to see how good it was. I got a side of eggs and my brother got a side of bacon. The portion came out really big. The chicken and waffle was really good! I love the sausage gravy that came with the dish as well. I didn&#39;t finish my plate but my siblings did and they thoroughly enjoyed their meal.

Ordered the Burgundian Omelette which was the smallest omelette ever for about $15. My toast was burnt and they filled the plate with flavorless potatoes.

Our server basically seemed to ignore us as she knew we were waiting for our food. She kept going to the table next to us, but didn&#39;t say anything to us to acknowledge our long wait. We noticed the tables who sat after us were getting their food, so was going to try to flag our server down, but another server finally brought our food out.

The chicken &amp; waffles is absolutely amazing, and is right up there with the best in the city. I have seen (and had) some amazing dishes there, and they continue to change out their menu to what is in season, freshly caught, or appropriate for the day.

I mean, fried chicken &amp; waffles is nowadays a thing (as opposed to having to either search out Roscoe&#39;s or the like) and can even be found at IHOP of all places. So having a take on fried chicken &amp; waffles that stands out over everyone else&#39;s is obviously the thing to do. 

Burgundian&#39;s take on chicken &amp; waffles definitely stands out in that crowded field. Moist, tender chicken pieces and that maple bacon syrup -- good times. The gravy it comes with too -- wow. The wife did their fried chicken Benedict -- good times there as well. Definitely worth a brunch stop if you&#39;re in the neighborhood.

How could I have forgotten.  Frustrating!  I didn&#39;t come back to this place for 3 years after my first bad experience, but then tried it earlier this year. Been 3-4 times and the food has been great, mainly happy hour food.  I&#39;ve had fantastic mussels, ahi, poutine, chicken and waffles, and a few others.  So I guess I was lulled back to expect a kitchen that knew the difference between med rare and well done. I get that this is a gastro pub, but if a restaurant is going to advertise Dry Aged Steak (Market Price), then I&#39;d expect this is something special.

They have a regularly rotating craft beer menu and can make any drink you please. Sometimes the house made bar ingredients aren&#39;t really the best though. Stick with the beer and cider menu, and try your drink of choice to see if the craft ingredients are fitting in and if not, stick with a beer or single ingredient drink.
Take a group of friends for dinner and you&#39;ll have a good time for sure."

We got the chicken &amp; waffles w/o eggs or bacon (16$) and the steamed mussels (18$). Boy, the 2 sauces and gravy that came with the waffles were spectacular! The apple butter was so delectable and NOT overly sweet, while the bourbon syrup melted in your mouth ever so slowly. Gravy was nice as well, but paled in comparison to the other two amazing things. The portion size is a little small and expensive though for just ONE waffle and 4 pieces of fried chicken. Our chicken also came a little overdone. Mussels were decent, but some of them weren&#39;t cooked fully and gave that overwhelming seafoody smell. The broth was hearty since it was the typical butter and cream. Kind of made me wish there was something else interesting about the broth since the waffles were so impressive. 

Service was very attentive, especially our water cups being filled after I&#39;d barely even got it down an inch. There seems to be a guy who just walks around with a pitcher filling water... seems like a chill job? Anywho, would definitely return again for those waffles! Doesn&#39;t get any more perfect than these."

I would come here just for that alone. Other than that the fried chicken and waffles were very good as well! It&#39;s currently tied with Restaurant Roux in my book ;) great portion of chicken and the waffle was very fluffy my favorite waffle so far.. the lil lamb burger was also delicious .. No complaints with that one .. The polenta fries were ok .. New concept so I had to try it but I think I still prefer good ol&#39; pomme frites! The only thing I didn&#39;t like was the apple crisp dessert .. My friend and I didn&#39;t finish it.. Me not finishing a dessert says A LOT.

Okay...a little more. The chicken was about as perfect as fried chicken can get . The photos do not do it justice. Then add in the boozy syrup, the apple saucy stuff, and the gravy (yes, all three!).they also know how to cook eggs. That may sound obvious, but it&#39;s amazing how difficult it is to find really good scrambled eggs (fluffy, and neither runny nor dry).

We went wanting good burgers and they use to have variety. Not anymore. I&#39;ll pay $16 for my burger with cheddar cheese somewhere else. 

Small note. Not a huge deal but they sat us right under a burned out light. We had to use the flashlight on your phone to read the menu. Waitress even commented that it&#39;s been out for awhile.

came here on a saturday morning and was quickly seated right away. unfortunately, it was right next to an extremely loud group of people -- slight damper -- but fortunately, we could see that their plates were emptying meaning they were leaving pretty soon. 

service was good -- no qualms about this! 

so on to my chicken &amp; waffles review.. man i hope this isn&#39;t the best chicken &amp; waffles that seattle has to offer, because it was disappointing. the waffle, for some reason, had this strange sour kick to it and it really didn&#39;t add any value to the waffle besides leaving a weird tart aftertaste. i&#39;ve heard of people using sour cream to make their waffles fluffier, but my waffles weren&#39;t particularly fluffy either. i would&#39;ve preferred a traditional, thick Belgian waffle -- crisp outer with fluffy innards. mine wasn&#39;t dense per se, but it wasn&#39;t fluffy either. i kid you not, but i think i&#39;ve had better belgian waffles at those make-it-yourself waffle stations at continental breakfasts in 3 star hotels. if im paying $16 for chicken and waffles, i want a good waffle. onto the chicken -- pros and cons about this. pros: the chicken itself was good -- juicy, tender and not too greasy. flavor was good too -- not too salty. con: the batter left much to be desired. it was crumbly and, for lack of a better description, a sad, skimpy coating. where&#39;s that thick, crunchy, hearty batter that should be lovingly coated on my juicy chicken?! i won&#39;t fault the restaurant for trying to add its own twist on this dish, but i didn&#39;t care much for the bourbon maple syrup. good ol&#39; fashioned vermont maple syrup would&#39;ve been my traditionalist preference. i pretty much only used the apple butter as my topping and would&#39;ve probably enjoyed this more if my waffle weren&#39;t tart! tart butter on my tart waffle = too much of one thing, and not enough balance in flavoring. finally, the gravy was decent (though a little lukewarm), but nothing mind-blowing. nice to have as a dipping sauce for the chicken. 

portion wise -- this is definitely on the smaller side. i got maybe 3-4 small-ish pieces of the fried chicken. 

overall, if you can&#39;t nail the stars of the dish -- chicken and waffle -- the added condiments aren&#39;t really going to add much to the dish. 

my search continues!"

Gastropubs took a strong hold in Portland, but somehow never seemed to spread as well in Seattle, so it&#39;s great to find a gem like this in my city and not far from home. Parking is a pain since it&#39;s in Tangletown, but is worth a little stroll to enjoy this place.

I loved the spicy chicken wings and could have made a meal of them. The tuna tartine was a little underflavored by comparison but would have been a good small bite on another day. Their bar is *well* stocked and the list is staggering. Wine lovers may be disappointed as this is the only weak spot on the drink list, but somehow you&#39;ll work it out with the dizzying other options at your fingertips.

Brunch delivered the best eggs bennie we have had in Seattle in a donkey&#39;s age. That ALONE would bring us back with thin sliced, flavorful ham, a perfectly fresh and bright hollandaise, poached to perfection eggs, all on top of a little croissant-like bread that is hard to describe. 

The place is very busy, but never felt noisy. We could talk at normal voice levels no matter how packed and bustling the place was, which is a welcome trait of this cozy place. The decor itself is standard gastropub with wood booths, dark/black painted ceilings and chairs, which is fine with me. Pretty light fixtures, though, and the carved wood bar is stunning.

Easy to say, I loved (LOVED) it here. Went for brunch. Atmosphere very relaxed and friendly. Decor included natural woodwork, large windows with plenty on natural light, and fun booths. Drink menu was extensive: my grapefruit mimosa was pretty good but I will be trying something else next time.

And now for the main attraction, food. HOLYSWEETBABYJESUS. I&#39;ve heard good things about the Chicken &amp; Waffles, but for some reason I was drawn to the biscuits and gravy. Since I was debating, I asked the server-a very cool dude. He immediately said biscuits and gravy. Okie dokie, all set. But what meat do I have with it? I ordered the homemade sausage, but I&#39;m pretty sure the server was like, nah she needs the fried chicken. SO maybe this was a wrong order, maybe it was intentional knowing I would be so thankful, or maybe the fried meat that was smothered under my gravy really was sausage to which I say: genius! Either way, the fried chicken, smothered in the best gravy, fresh, fluffy eggs, and homemade biscuits as good as my mom&#39;s, was probably the best brunch I have ever had in my entire life here in Seattle."

I don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s so moist inside but perfectly crispy (though just a tad too salty) on the outside. Chicken and waffles is next on my list.

On my most recent trip to Seattle, my friend asked me what I wanted to have for brunch. I responded, &#34;Chicken and waffles&#34; and he brought me here. Without a doubt, I ordered the chicken and waffles, which were amazing to say the least.  The chicken and waffles were crispy and moist, while the sausage gravy, bourbon infused maple syrup, and apple sauce were delectable and paired well with each other or separately with every bite and morsel of crispy chicken and breaded waffle goodness.  Who would have ever thought that Seatte, of all places, dished out some fingerlickingly, mouthwateringly good chicken and waffles?  Burgundian definitely does. 

I&#39;ve sampled chicken and waffles around the nation, and I would have to say that Burgundian ranks near the top of all my chicken and waffle experiences. Keep it up! If I&#39;m ever back in the Seattle area, I&#39;ll definitely be back here for my chicken and waffles fix!"

Now don&#39;t get me wrong, the fried chicken and waffles are really good. The bourbon maple syrup is something else and I wish I had jars of it, but I think it comes up short. The biscuit has a scallion cheddar flavor. Its doused in delicious creamy gravy and my choice of meat is fried chicken, combined together this makes for an incredible hearty meal. Oh let&#39;s not forget about the breakfast potatoes, which the chicken and waffles meal does not come with. I love potatoes of any kind so this is a must!

Now the first time I came here, my group received terrible service. We waited 40 minutes for our meal to arrive. We spent around 2 hours total here. Waiting to order, waiting for our food, waiting for water, waiting for the check, waiting to pay the check. I wasn&#39;t very impressed.

My go to is the biscuits and gravy.  A pretty heavy meal so if you like to eat late at night you might want to try something a bit lighter.

I too have tried the chicken and waffles and have been impressed. I&#39;m not much for the bourbon flavor of the syrup but it does help tie the meal together.
I had an order of poutine but felt like it could have been so much more than it was. Poutine lovers, skip this dish. 

The interior is a clean looking, dimly lit place with tables and benches. They are able to accommodate for larger groups if needed. The location is great and there is (free) parking available near by.

The wait staff here is amazing. Always attentive and great customer service. There was a misunderstanding (partly our fault) with one of our servers and they were quick to help.

First off, if you&#39;re getting fries, get the garlic aioli as one of your dipping sauce choices (out of: whiskey bbq, curry ketchup, honey mustard, etc). 

We had the happy hour chicken and waffles and the pretzel. The chicken and waffle was served with apple butter, bourbon maple syrup, and chicken gravy. The chicken was crispy, well cooked, and tender. The pretzel was browned on the darker side but amazingly soft and just the perfect amount of salt, it was served with homemade cheese sauce and spicy mustard. 

For dinner we the Ruben and the Fried Chicken BLT. The Ruben was packed full of corn beef. The BLT was awesome minus the fact that I asked for the ailoi&#39;s (two: one on top, the other on the bottom) to be served on the side and they weren&#39;t. I&#39;m not a sauce person, so a little goes a long way. 

The drink selection .... HOLY WOW. They know their drink making skills. We got a whiskey sour w/egg white and it turned out pretty good (we opted for the well whisky...bad idea). I got a proseco, they serve it by the glass.

I went here this morning, a Saturday, and it wasn&#39;t overly busy. No waiting, tables free, but definitely at least 75% full. We ordered, and 40 minutes later, our food arrives. A little disappointing, for sure. I had the biscuit with fried chicken and gravy with scrambled eggs. While pouring my ketchup on my plate for my potatoes, I realize I have ketchup all over my hand because the bottle wasn&#39;t clean. Gross. The chicken was good, I appreciate that it&#39;s boneless. Gravy was thick and had chunks of sausage, and the biscuit was cheesy delicious.

On top of being slow, a dirty ketchup bottle, what really irritated me... I mean really, really bothered me, is when I got the bill. You see, I came here with my hubs, and ONLY my hubs. I mean just the two of us, enjoying a Saturday as husband and wife. Why does this matter? Because the bill said he had served FIVE people which constituted an automatic 18% gratuity, which ended up being $6.66. I&#39;m a pretty generous tipper guys, and have no problem leaving 18% or more. I can&#39;t say I would have left a lot more, but  a little superstitious and wouldn&#39;t have left that.

While Burgundian doesn&#39;t take reservations, I didn&#39;t find the wait terrible for a Sunday brunch. There was plenty of street parking, and I like how the restaurant was pretty spacious. While they tried to get everyone in and seated as quickly as possible, it did take a little while to get our food once we ordered. It was understandable though, so I didn&#39;t mind. The servers were all super nice about it and attentive! 

Can&#39;t wait to return!"

For my burger, I got medium-rare, turns out the patty was well done. The patty was cooked all the way through. I also had an egg added, over-easy style. Guess what? The egg was over cooked as well. I was expecting a juicy burger and it turns out to be a plain, dry burger that I could get anywhere.

The chicken and waffles brought back some points. The fried chicken was good. However, the serving size is too small. There were probably only 5 pieces of fried chicken. &#34;Large plates&#34;? I don&#39;t think so."

Luckily, there was a seat out in their patio and the weather was nice! We were seated right away and after a few minutes, our server Hillary took our drink orders. Several minutes after that, she brought the drinks out and took our order. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the breakfast burrito. It took a little over an hour before our food came out! Hillary came by our table at least 3 times to ask if we wanted another drink.... Not sure why it would take over an hour for them to bring the food out...

The food: chicken and waffles was pretty tasty. The fried chicken was lightly seasoned and worked well with the bourbon maple syrup. Waffles were just ok, nothing special. The breakfast burrito was also ok as well.

I was a bit judgmental and assumed that a French style restaurant in Tangletown would be a cold try-hard establishment.  Instead, I found the service to be honest and modest.  My bartender was knowledgable about the beer menu and excited to give suggestions.  The menu is also more straight forward than I expected.  A quick browse through the photos on yelp show how popular the chicken and waffles are.  

I decided to avoid this in lieu of the cheapest option on the regular menu,  The Croque Madame.   It was served with an underplayed yet setisfying house-made beer cheese sauce which has an excellent consistency and compliments the sandwich perfectly.  Both the bread and the egg were cooked pitch-perfect.  Overall this seemingly simple ham egg and cheese sandwich came to life with how well each element was prepared and came together.  

The beer and liquor selection are expansive.  

The one complaint that I have about Burgundian is the pricing.  I would like to see more food items around the $10 range and beers at the $5 range.  Its a slightly upscale area of town, and their prices reflect that."

Chicken and Waffles: I&#39;m not even a fan of fried chicken, but it was fried in a way that wasn&#39;t greasy or fatty, but just crunchy. There was an amazing whisky syrup (Dang it strong. I think I could get drunk off this syrup.), apple sauce, and a gravy with sausage chunks it in. Amazingggg.

Croque Madame: Cheese galore. The cheese beer sauce is amazingly cheesy and delicious. Can&#39;t go wrong with a ham and cheese sandwich, covered in cheese sauce.

Winter Hash (with corned beef, of course): The veggies (carrots, radishes, broccolini) were great, but I don&#39;t know if I would like it if my friend didn&#39;t add corned beef, which was an extra $2.

Overall a great brunch spot. The location is pretty big, so I didn&#39;t have to wait at all, which is a nice change for brunch. My only complaint is that they seemed to run out of stuff. They didn&#39;t have bellinis, some other drink, carnivore strata, and the bruleed oranges. Kinda weird to be out of brunch items by 1pm."

Also?

Chicken and waffle.  Burgundian fries perfectly-seasoned white meat chicken strips and places them on a crisp yet pillowy waffle.  (I should mention here that I almost exclusively hate white meat, but somehow this was moist and tender and fabulous.) 

Served with less-than-memorable vanilla-apple butter and a side of sausage gravy, which might just hold the title &#34;Best Sausage Gravy in the City.&#34;

One small request -- please start doing a chicken fried steak (CFS) with that gravy.  We&#39;ve searched the city far and wide looking for the perfect CFS, and we think Burgundian could pull it off.  The Texan in my life would pay good money to make that happen."

They have a decent tap list, but the prices are jacked on higher ABV pours which I find just annoying. We also recently attended a beer week dinner here with multiple courses. A couple courses were good but the majority were not exciting at all and the carrot cake at dessert was honestly quite horrible.

My favorite thing about happy hour is not only the price, but the portioning, which allows you to order and eat more. The happy hour chicken and waffles comes with a quarter waffle and three pieces of chicken, with some amazing bourbon maple syrup and applesauce (which I had never had before but it went amazingly well with the chicken!). The happy hour poutine was sizeable as well--those carbs and dairy fill you up pretty well.

The atmosphere of the Burgundian was also quite nice; it was sunny when I was there and the big open windows let in the sun and spring air."

The chicken was good, juicy, crunchy, salty, but the waffle needs some work.   As soon as I put any syrup on the waffle instantly turned to mush and it had a weird sour aftertaste.  Maybe cook them a little longer or make them thicker?  I&#39;m also confused by the gravy and apple sauce are they all supposed to go on the waffle or separate.  Just didn&#39;t seem to go together.

Stat.

The chicken and waffle are unlike any other I&#39;ve tried. A giant, crispy yet fluffy malt waffle becomes a bed for a handful of crispy, tender, flavorful nuggets of fried chicken. The best part? Your chicken and waffle is served with a side of bourbon maple syrup (pour the whole thing right over the chicken and waffle immediately!), apple butter and country sausage gravy, that you can take turns dipping your salty sweet bites into.

Luckily, a few friends of mine had their heart set on eating at the Burgundian so I happily went along for the ride!

As soon as I saw the chicken and waffles on the menu, I knew that was what I was going to get. Then a friend told me they&#39;re known for the dish, which further solidified it. Though the menu is short, there&#39;s great variety. There are an assortment of French dishes ranging from cassoulet to croque madam. There&#39;s also a bunch of sandwiches ranging from a burger to a gyro with lots in between. There&#39;s something for everyone! 

My friends ordered the poutine for an appetizer, which was phenomenal. It had a number of different fixings on it that makes it different from a more traditional poutine, including steak sauce. But the flavors of the different condiments along with the cheese and nice crunch of the fries made this poutine outstanding. 

My chicken and waffles were top-notch. I have to admit, the waffle kind of faded into the background and merely served as a vehicle for the chicken, apple butter, syrup and gravy to get in my mouth all at once. And oh boy the GRAVY. My mother has a weird dislike of gravy so I grew up in a gravy-less household (tragic, I know). So I&#39;ve always ordered it on the side, never being too fond of the consistency or the texture it added to otherwise fine dishes. But in this case, the gravy was the crowning glory to the chicken and waffles. It provided a creamy, savory counterpoint to the sweet, earthy, and spicy syrup and apple butter combo. I could eat that gravy on anything! 

Okay, enough purple prose about the chicken and waffles. The service was pretty great despite the packed house. They had a nice bar area with a few TVs, too. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to visit the Burgundian again for the gravy alone!"

The chicken was good, the waffles were thick and crispy on the outside.  My biscuit was buttery and flaky and the gravy was savory and creamy as it should be.

We recently also had dinner here with a group of friends.  The beer list is extensive and they have an impressive number of beers on tap.  The food at dinner is good but not ultra-creative (burgers, grilled cheese, spaghetti, salads), and they even include a few of their popular breakfast/brunch items.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food though no one was wowed by it.  The only complaint I have is with the poutine - they melted the cheese curds into one big slice of cheese so it almost seemed like we had a layer of pizza cheese draped over fries.  I wouldn&#39;t order it again!

Type of cuisine: Comfort food served the Seattle way. &#34;The Burgundian is the latest addition to the Brouwer&#39;s and Bottleworks family. Located in the Tangletown area in Seattle&#39;s Wallingford neighborhood. The Burgundian offers 22 beers on tap and a select craft can and bottled beer selection. We have a wonderful collection of bourbons, tequilas and rum to choose from as well as unique craft cocktails. We also now offer espresso. We serve a full food menu with seasonal specials and all day breakfast. 21 and over only please.&#34; 

Ambiance: We walk up to the brick building and happen upon the establishment, unassuming and easy to miss. Inside, the modernity of concrete floors compliment the rustic, yet new wooden bar and sturdy tables. Decor reminiscent of an Old Wild West Saloon set in hipster vibes, barren trees giving the full experience of life in North Seattle.  

What I ordered: My husband and our dining companion began with the endless House Drip Coffee ($2 each), served with cream and sweeteners/sugar. I opted for a Fonté Coffee Co. single shot decaf mocha ($4). 

My main entree: The Biscuit Benedict ($12). I built my own Benedict on a Cheddar Herb Biscuit topped with a house-made cream cheese Hollandaise, and Breakfast Potatoes. My benedict included crispy ham and two poached eggs.

My husband was so excited to see chorizo on the menu, and selected the Papas con Chorizo ($12), potatoes, chorizo, three eggs scrambled and topped with pico de gallo &amp; avocado, served with four warm corn tortillas and sour cream.

Our dining companion shared a bite of her boneless Chicken &amp; Waffles ($15), fried chicken, malt waffle, apple butter, sausage gravy &amp; bourbon maple syrup.

What I loved: Potatoes. Mocha. Mocha. Potatoes. Difficult decision between the two. However, the boneless, fried chicken was juicy and flavorful and may deserve a second sampling on our next visit. 

Why I loved it: An easy spot in which to get a table on a Saturday morning for brunch, beautiful location near Greenlake for sunny, crisp walks on a February morning, satisfying food that comes in appropriate (not too big) portions.

Cost: Average ($11 - $15 per brunch plate)"

Today at approx 1:15 I came in for lunch, a quick one, with the intention of doing some work on the patio with a Bloody Mary.  The restaurant had a total of 2 tables seated.  I sat myself outside.

10 minutes later, the bartender approached me and asked if I was ready to order.  Yep.  Didn&#39;t ask me if I wanted a drink, didn&#39;t ask how my day was, just completely bypassed any friendly bartender back-and-forth.  I told him I wanted a Bloody Mary ($9).  I also ordered a burger ($14).

The bloody he brought me was pretty much just tomato juice with a lemon, pepper, and a pickle.  Yep.  That was it.  There was no alcohol.  If I wanted a tomato juice I probably would have ordered one.

I was on the phone when the bartender came back, so I kind of understand his interaction....kind of.  If it weren&#39;t so passive!  I told him I was sending the drink back to the bar.  I got off the phone a minute later.  He had a chance to correct his crappy drink or at least ask me why it sucked.  He didn&#39;t really seem to care.  

I was pretty annoyed so I left.  And it&#39;s too bad because I actually enjoy coming here every other month or so, and usually I bring people with.  The burger was pretty good, just overshadowed by my disappointment in the lack of fun and friendly staff."

Some days I just can&#39;t motivate myself to get out for brunch until well into lunchtime. I also love the location - Tangletown is close enough to Green Lake that we can take a pre-brunch power walk to offset the beer and gut bombs. Just don&#39;t try to do your walk AFTER brunch - we tried that once and two strong beers later it was a major backfire. We ended up sitting in the park and sobering up like it was a Friday night... on Sunday afternoon. Not a good idea.

If you come around noon or later there will usually be a wait, but it has never been more than 15 minutes for us. Grab a drink from the bar and relax. The beer selection has been a bit IPA heavy lately, but they always have a good variety, with at least one stout or porter, and usually a barley wine. Yum! The cider selection is also amazing - I saw 7 or 8 different choices last time. Great way to get your gluten free drink on. The bloody Mary here (with the standard vodka) is very good - their house mix is a nice balance of salty, sweet, and vinegar. They offer the bloody Mary with gin or tequila as well but I&#39;m not THAT adventurous.

The food has also been pretty consistently awesome. By the time we straggle in they are usually out of the strata and whatever quiche of the moment is available. The croque madame comes without sides, but it is rich and filling enough to stand on it&#39;s own. The winter citrus salad is light and refreshing, and pairs well with the amazing French onion soup. Seriously, I should have ordered two bowls. So damn good. The lamb gyro was really tasty as well, considering it seemed to be outside of their usual fare. Service is always prompt and pleasant, even when they are super busy. I should probably take up running so I can eat here all the time without turning into a total lump."

The service was outstanding, and since it only seats 28, you can choose to have some good conversations with the staff - including the chefs since the kitchen is wide open! I was seated at the chef&#39;s counter and had the great experience of watching dishes be created. The chef&#39;s had no problem explaining a dish more in-depth, or a particular process or ingredient they were working with. Being at the chef&#39;s counter also allowed me to get a few extra bites of the other dishes while I waited for my different courses. 

Would absolutely recommend and go again - it&#39;s a little out of the way (was a 10 minute drive from downtown), but personally that&#39;s exactly what I was looking for. It reminded me of the tiny restaurants in Paris on the side streets that only the locals know about. Absolutely perfect!"

Since there was three of us, we all got different items. Ethan Stowell restaurants always encourage family style anyways so that&#39;s what we did!

First - albacore crudo, truffled cauliflower soup and cheese plate
Second - seared scallops, pork tenderloin and grilled double R ranch beef
Third - dark chocolate brownie, dulce de leche panna cotta and pomegranate sorbet

It was extremely difficult picking favorites as everything was SO SO SO good but I think I&#39;d have to say the cauliflower soup, seared scallops and (surprisingly) the pomegranate sorbet were my faves of the night!

Cozy, friendly staff always willing to help, delicious food... who can say no to all those??!"

The restaurant is tiny so reservations are recommended. The place was fully booked on a Tuesday. Their SRW selection was great. 

We chose the following:
Appetizers: Washington albacore crudo, truffled cauliflower soup, Macrina bread (extra $4)
Entrees: Seared sea scallops and grilled Double R Rand beef
Dessert: dark chocolate brownie and dulce de leche panna cotta 

My favorites were the albacore crudo, grilled beef and panna cotta. The albacore crudo was crunchy and seasonal with slices of Asian pear and the fish was fresh. The beef was perfectly cooked to medium rare (not bloody) and was pepper crusted. The panna cotta was so creamy, the texture was amazing as was the butterscotch flavor. 

I would definitely come back again and see how their menu changes. I have been to 3 of the Ethan Stowell restaurants and I am much more of a fan of his places than Tom Douglas restaurants. Ethan Stowell has a MUCH better pastry chef so the desserts here are among the best I&#39;ve had in restaurants.

I&#39;ve been here a couple times now and each time the atmosphere, food, and service were all top notch.  The small plate business model works great here, and its a good thing because each dish is out of this world good so you&#39;re going to want to try as many as you can.  The, green beans, the scallops, the hamachi, and the wagyu beef dish are my go-to dishes and everything tastes so amazingly fresh and its always cooked to perfection."

Well, this year&#39;s SRW happened and I had to get a reservation in. Both times we have gone there later in the evening (think: 8:45-9) but it&#39;s been worth it. It&#39;s a tiny restaurant, I like that it&#39;s got more of a casual feel to it, with bar seating if you want to watch them whip up your meal.

The cauliflower truffle soup was luscious, albacore crudo was refreshing, the pork tenderloin once again was superb (my bf hopes to recreate this with his sous vide), we also had grilled steak again which had the perfect crust &amp; seasoning. Having gone to another SRW meal the night before, the quality of ingredients and refinement in the cooking were not comparable. The service at mkt is also on-point.

I&#39;ve been to many of Ethan Stowell&#39;s restaurants and this one is my favorite! I definitely would come here on a normal, non-restaurant week night."

I knew I had to bring her here after my first incredible experience, and it did not disappoint! Also glad I was able to get some pictures of my food this time.

Wine:
Mkt. has a great selection of wine. My friend &amp; I both had 2 glasses of the Rioja and really enjoyed it.

Starters:
- Oysters: They had oysters by the shell as a special, and my friend ordered two. She really enjoyed them and commented about how fresh they were and how much she loved the topping/sauce it came with!
- Grilled asparagus with soft egg, ramp salsa verde, pangrattato: So simple and delicious. I LOVE asparagus so this was great. Perfectly cooked and the salsa verde with the bread crumbs complimented the dish really well.
- Purple sweet potato croquette: This was surprisingly SO flavorful. Really loved the mint chutney it came with!

Entrees:
- Grilled crispy lamb belly: So tender and perfectly paired with the mustard vinaigrette. The combination of rhubarb and lentils was incredible! Who would&#39;ve thought?
- Grilled squid garganelli pasta: Was hesitant to order a pasta dish because we thought it would be too heavy, but fear not! The sauce was light yet packed with flavor. Generous portion of squid and the pasta was perrrrrrfect.

Dessert:
- Rhubarb pistachio tarte w/ creme fraiche gelato &amp; honey drizzle: Okay. This has to be the stand out for me. One of the BEST desserts I&#39;ve ever had (at least in recent memory) - fresh rhubarb, crunchy pistachios, and perfectly dense, yet crisp crust. OH and the creme fraiche gelato was so refreshing! Wish I could buy it in a pint! YUM.

The service and food were both just as stellar as the first time - I will continue to come here for unpretentious, high quality fare at a fair price. :)"

We finally caught a weekday night on a random trip to Seattle.  We were able to sit at the chefs counter. We leaned how they prepare their kimchi and watch them plate and prepare these amazing dishes. 

The manager was a sweetheart. My wife will use her skills in future corporate speaking engagements because she was so personable from the call to our entire visit. The server Matt made us feel like we were his long lost friends that he finally reunited after being on a quest to find a unicorn. He was so excited to have us there and be just the perfect amount of engaged (and give us space) for a fantastic experience. 

Now the food was amazing. I loved the beans that were like fries. The hamburger with kimchi was packed with amazing flavors. The fritters and beet salad were also really good. 

Definitely lived up to the hype."

Reminds me of their sister restaurant How to Cook a Wolf in terms of layout. It&#39;s pretty small with some counter seating to watch the kitchen, which only had 2-3 people cooking. I love watching the kitchen and was happy we got counter seating!

Complimentary mushroom tortellini
This was a nice surprise and actually great to tide over my friend and I&#39;s hunger. It came in a light and flavorful broth.

Green beans
Wasn&#39;t really sure if we were supposed to eat these properly, but we ate them like fries since they came upright in a jar hahah super tasty and light. Maybe not the most graceful eating on my part :)

Squash fritter balls
This is probably the only dish I wouldn&#39;t order again. Basically like fancy tater tot-like squash. Wasn&#39;t bad, but not something I&#39;d crave.

Waygu beef
So tender! Ate all of this in like 3min.

Lemon tart / Chocolate 
Both my friend and I don&#39;t normally go for lemon type desserts, but we decided to go for this and it was so delicious! Very light and not too sweet. Also got a little chocolate pot type dessert, but we were so focused on the tart we devoured that and the chocolate ended up being too heavy.

The service was super friendly/approachable and I definitely wanna come back and try more."

We came in for my birthday dinner on Saturday right when they opened at 5 pm.  We were sat at the bar with a great view of the kitchen. There were only 2 chefs the entire time, but they got all the food out and it was a treat to be able to watch them. Our server had great recommendations and when he couldn&#39;t answer our questions, he got help which I loved! No BS. Thank you!

We were started off with a complimentary purple potato salad with asparagus, creme fraiche, and radishes. It was delicious! 

Hamachi ceviche - Delicious! Perfectly balanced appetizer with pickled red onion, cucumber, and cilantro. The flavored ice was very unique and innovative. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Charred brussel sprouts with black umami sauce - Fine dish, but not worth what it cost. 

Butternut squash fritters - I liked the texture of these a lot. I was expecting a mashed squash mixture inside, but they were made of shaved strings of squash. The pesto was delicious. The fritters were very salty.

Rabbit leg - Beautiful dish. I thought the sides were perfect. The salad was heavily dressed but everything came together really well. 

Gnocchi with braised beef cheek - This dish was wonderful. The gnocchi were rich but not heavy. The beef cheek and swiss chard were very salty in this dish. The chestnuts created a wonderful texture!

Orange chocolate sorbet - Came with shortbread cookie. Lit with a birthday candle. Very nice gift from the restaurant.

Overall, heavily salted food in 3 of 5 dishes. It&#39;s an expensive experience when 2-3 dishes per person are recommended to share, but conceptually the plates are wonderful. I would come back, but only for special occasions!"

We had hamachi ceviche, the most interesting part is the yuzu cucumber ice a really interesting concept, the fish stayed cold. 
The grilled squash salad, pepitas, anchovy vinaigrette. love the mushrooms  which added a great favor 
Grilled wagyu beef crusted with peppercorn, rosemary, fingerling potatoes, fried onions, red wine sauce: it was cooked perfectly, very tender and flavorful.

What really was the icing on top of the cake was when the waitstaff brought my cake out. My bf had gone the night before to prepare for it. The guests in the restaurant all joined in singing me happy birthday!

The restaurant is on the small side, has smaller plates, and like most restaurants in Seattle cost a lot.  It is a trendy spot serving items like rabbit, and quail. No chicken dinner here.  
My wife loves places like this.  She ordered a cocktail with Tequila that she really liked and had some wine after.  Yes, mixed wine and Tequila, but it didn&#39;t end up being a sloshy occasion.  We had some pasta for dinner, my entree came with Pork that I was very impressed with.  Just perfectly cooked, with a bit of salt.
I am not a fan of going to trendy spots, which cost an extra 30%, but for this type of place it turned out great.  Really, my wife liked it, and that is all that really mattered.

We went with another couple to celebrate 2 birthdays, and the server did wish us happy birthday (but no freebies).  

They were offering the Seattle restaurant week menu. 2 of us ordered the grilled wagyu beef medium rare - one of them came out medium rare but the other (mine) was medium well to well - it was very tough but I didn&#39;t send it back because I hate wasting food. The server discounted that one but it was a low point in the meal, esp since I had been so looking forward to a good wagyu beef. At least my guests&#39; meals all came out as expected, except for the scallop order which was cooked well but there was only 2 scallops so don&#39;t go there hungry. 

Also the macrina bread order didn&#39;t come until the entrees arrived. One server said it was a peach spread and another said it was apricot. Would be nice to know what we&#39;re eating. 

The hamachi crudo appetizer was ok. Hamachi was good by itself but didn&#39;t really connect with the other items on the dish. Asian pears that it was served with had no taste and left me wishing I could have brought my own sweet organic Asian pears.  

One highlight was the cocktail which was very good."

MKT is probably the definition of a cozy restaurant, it&#39;s small, dimly lit, and intimate. I had no issues getting a reservation, which was surprising since it was for Seattle Restaurant Week. We got wonderful seating that overlooked the kitchen, which was fantastic. I loved watching the chefs cook and prep. I felt like I was in the kitchen with them. The staff was very nice and helpful with selections and recommendations. Also, very attentive! 

Appetizers: 
Special Chef&#39;s Treat - I don&#39;t remember what it was called but it was a soft boiled egg topped with bread crumbs, pickled onion and had some sort of miso sauce at the bottom. I loved it! There was so much flavor and texture in one bite. I enjoyed the sauce the most. 

Hamachi Ceviche- Cucumber, Pickled Red Onion, Yuzu-Cucumber Ice. This dish was cool and refreshing and the hint of vinegar from the pickled onion kicked it up a notch. 

Asian Pear Endive Salad with Cheese- This was a very light and crisp dish. The pears were subtly sweet but paired with the cheese it gave this wonderful savory sweet combination. 

Entree: 
Grilled Double R Ranch Beef- Fingerling Potato, Fried Spring Onions, Salsa Verde. The meat was cooked perfectly! The flavors were very fragrant and I loved the added texture of the fried onion. 

Dessert:
Dark Chocolate Molten Cake w/ Almond Cream. This dessert just melted in your mouth. The almond cream was delicious and left me craving for more. 

Pumpkin Panna Cotta w/ Caramel Brittle. I was pleasantly surprised how much pumpkin flavor was in this dessert. I love all things pumpkin. There was some kind of berry sauce that gave it a sweet tangy flavor and the crunch from the caramel brittle gave great texture. 


I would recommend this place for date night. It has all the bells and whistles for a romantic night that will surely woo your date. The food is superb and the staff is amazing, but don&#39;t just take my word for it. Go check it out yourself."

I came here with some friends one evening for Seattle Restaurant Week. The place is very tiny, so I recommend making a reservation in advance to ensure you get a table. We were seated promptly when we arrived, and perused the menu before being introduced to our server. She was upbeat, and very excited for us to be exposed to the food at mkt. My fellow Yelper, Nicole B and I both started off with oysters, which were out of this world! So delicious, and you could definitely taste the quality versus oysters at any &#39;run of the mill&#39; place. All the dishes I tried are below:

Anson Mills Grits, Lamb Sausage, Delicata Squash, Pomegranate - the grits were delicious and textured, the lamb sausage was smoky, the squash was flavorful, and the pomegranate added a refreshing sweetness to the whole dish. 

Hamachi Ceviche with Grapefruit - good dish, but not the best! I really enjoyed the flavor profile and I think the citrusy grapefruit did wonders to bring out the flavors in the yellowtail. 

Porcini-Ricotta Ravioli - this dish was heaven!! So delicate and flavorful. The truffle butter really made this dish stand out. 

Seared scallops - this is one dish that I was not too crazy about. The scallops were not cooked in the best way, and I wish they had been a little more delicate. 

Grilled Double R Ranch Beef - This was my favorite dish on the menu!  It came with fingerling potatoes and baby onion rings. The beef was cooked to perfection and the portion was adequate for sharing among friends. 

Pumpkin Panna Cotta - I love pumpkin, so this pumpkin dish was a great end to the meal. While I do love my sweets, I think the caramel brittle overpowered the sweetness a tad. 

Pomegranate Sorbet - surprisingly delicious and refreshing, but could do without the shortbread cookie it came with.

Chocolate Cake with toasted almonds - so rich and decadent, and seriously who doesn&#39;t like chocolate cake!? being the chocolate fanatic I am, I could easily eat a whole other chocolate cake after taking my first bite (with some milk of course)

Overall, very impressed by mkt. and the rumors about this place ARE TRUE - this is really as good as it gets! Definitely visit this place if you are in the area - I surely will be back!"

What I love most about MKT. is the attention to detail in the preparation and presentation of their dishes.  The menu is approachable and caters to meatatarians and vegetarians alike.  I have been during Seattle Restaurant Week and during normal service and noticed no difference in the way I was treated or the quality of the food - both outstanding!

To start, I recommend the fresh oysters (3) or the grilled and marinated green beans with sea salt and lemon.  Both are light and a great way to start your meal.

The scallops here are to die for!  The perfectly seared scallops are served over a bed of fregula sarda (similar to couscous) with a wonderful peperonata and piquillo-hazelnut aioli.  For the red meat lovers I recommend the grilled Wagyu beef crusted with peppercorn and rosemary, served with fingerling potatoes, fried onions, and a memorable red wine sauce.

Seating is very limited so I highly recommend a reservation, maybe even a week in advance for a decent time slot.

We didn&#39;t have a reservation, but called anyways to see if we could get a table. We were able to get a table and had a very nice welcome from the host. Our server was very friendly and talked up all the great menu items.
Small plates and sharing are the way to go! The three of us shared a bottle of wine and some great food: charred brussel sprouts with black umami sauce; hamachi ceviche, citrus-cucumber ice, coriander, pickled red onion; nettle ricotta ravioli, brown butter sauce, parmesan; grilled whole Idaho trout, yellowfoot chanterelles, sunchokes, black garlic remoulade; and crispy fried quail, celeriac puree, apple cider reduction. Presentation was perfect and we enjoyed savouring every bite of every dish ordered. Our server de-boned the trout and made it much easier to eat (I would have butchered it up!).

The wait staff seemed very nice and though not everyone in my group liked their food, I enjoyed my choices. However, I don&#39;t know if I would come back anytime soon and that might be the true test for me.

Mkt was on my hit list of restaurants to try out, and I was super excited for their Seattle Restaurant Week menu.  I highly recommend reservations since Mkt is pretty small and seemed to hold no more than 35 seats.

When we arrived, our table was unfortunately not ready. We waited about 30 minutes while another group finished up, and we decided to grab a cold beer at Elysian next door to pass the time.  Mrkt&#39;s wait staff was apologetic for the delay, even giving us a complimentary glass of pink sparking wine to taste. Free alcohol helps make any situation better, so I definitely give them an &#34;A&#34; for effort.

One of my friends did think Mkt&#39;s food combinations were a little odd, such as adding pomegrante seeds to her appetizer that didn&#39;t need it.

Here are my food thoughts on what I ate though:

1). Hamachi ceviche with grapefruit:
It was essentially big slices of hamachi. The flavoring was clean and crisp, though I didn&#39;t get the reason why it was called a &#34;ceviche.&#34; Though not quite what I expected, the hamachi was still pretty delicious by itself. 

2). Grilled Pork &amp; beans:
This was definitely a more heartier dish than their other mains, and it was plated beautifully. The combination of everything in one bite matched fairly well. However, the pork by itself was a little under seasoned, and the pork was a little too rare /pink in the middle than what I&#39;m used to.   

3). Coconut lemon sorbet w/ a shortbread cookie:
This was a light and tart treat! I would say I tasted more lemon than coconut, but it wasn&#39;t a bad way to end the night. However, this threw one of my friends off, since she didn&#39;t expect it to be so sour."

Restaurant is quaint and quite small but it definitely adds to the atmosphere and makes the place feel homey. 

We started with the Monday special selection (a seasonal salad of flowers picked from the most recent local farmers market). What was genius in concept was quite good in practice. Originally I was put off by the idea of edible flowers but quickly warmed up to it and actually quite enjoyed the dish. It was accompanied by a truffle custard which was sub par at best although its presentation was exquisite. 

Next we had the hamachi ceviche with cucumber ice. While this dish again was amazing in concept, it wasn&#39;t as amazing in practice. It was arguably the best dish we had all night but the cucumber ice lacked flavor in general and was more just a way to wet the hamachi. 

Next we had squid pasta which was just alright. The pasta felt a little underdone and the sauce was incredibly rich, at least for my taste. 

Mussels came out next, this dish rivaled the hamachi as the best of the night. The sauce it was cooked in was incredible and dipping bread in that sauce made my day and possibly my week. 

Lastly, we had the scallops with an onion purée base and seasonal salad. For what it cost, definitely not worth it and most likely would not recommend. 

Dessert was a homemade pink lemonade sorbet and we ordered the post-dinner coffee. Both of which were delightful and up to expectation. 

Service made this experience extremely enjoyable, but the food was not what I expected from an Ethan Stowell restaurant. Considering what the meal cost as a whole, I&#39;m not sure I would return if the food remained at that level. 

Am looking forward to trying more Ethan Stowell, however.

7/10 would return."

Our waitress was very helpful and nice. The food itself varied from meh to very good. 

Four of us (two light eaters and two average eaters) ordered the following:

Warm baguette with herb butter and seasonal spread... which I believe was tapenade.
The bread itself was pretty good (we could have used a little more) and the tapenade was tasty. The butter had a nice flavor but was a bit firm, therefore hard to spread. 

Grilled and marinated green beans with sea salt and lemon.
I liked the concept of eating the beans with your fingers like french fries, but they were very salty. The flavor would have been nice minus all the salt. 

Bartlett pear and endive salad with walnuts, rosemary and smoked sheep cheese.
The pear was perfectly ripe, which was refreshing, and the combo of flavors was good. Endive isn&#39;t my favorite but this was a solid dish. 

Baby lettuce salad with roasted vegetables, soft-cooked egg and pangrattato.
I liked this dish but it could have been a little better. The soft-cooked egg was perfect, and I liked the idea of including pangrattato (think flavorful bread crumbs) but again, this dish was too salty. I could have done without the frilly greens, frisee perhaps? The roasted veggies, a few carrots and radish (I think) were tasty though... could have used a few more of those. 

Roasted beet and wheat berry salad with smoked chèvre, golden raisins and wild cress.
I heard the baby beets were good, but didn&#39;t get to try one. The tangy cheese matched with the sweet raisins was nice, although the (very crunchy) wheat berries kept escaping my fork. A spoon would have been better for scooping them up. The portion was a bit smaller than I was expecting for this one.

Porcini ricotta ravioli with mushroom butter sauce, marjoram and Parmesan.
Definitely the best dish of the entire dining experience. I would actually be excited to enjoy this again! This dish was super flavorful and creamy. Yum!

Chocolate pot topped with (some sort of) cream and nib brittle. 
Really good. The chocolate portion was creamy and had a good flavor, perfect paired with the refreshing cream and crunchy brittle. 

Pear cake topped with hazelnuts and gelato.
Also a good option for dessert. The cake was warm and moist, the hazelnuts pleasantly nutty and the gelato was pretty good but could have had more depth of flavor.

Overall, Mkt. is worth giving a try. Order several dishes (including the ravioli and chocolate pot) since the servings are small and be ready to spend a decent chunk of change."

It&#39;s wonderful that we have this in our quiet little &#39;hood - it nearly makes up for the loss of Eva some years ago now. But there are reasons that it &#34;nearly&#34; makes up for that loss, and cannot get five stars: (1) the wine list is just too limited and there are no great wines represented. There are good wines, but no great ones, and a slender selection (understandable, as they have very limited space). (2) The red wines that they do have are kept too warm, which is likely just an unfortunate result of having too little storage space on site. (3) The place is so small, it&#39;s difficult to get a seat without a reservation and it can be challenging to get a reservation. Eva always had unreserved seating in their bar area so there was always a decent chance that walk-ins could be accepted. But I suppose this is just a business decision on the part of Ethan Stowell, and it appears to be a good decision since the place is very often full. We just had two dinners there in close proximity and they were both delicious, with good service, and the kind of atmosphere that is my sweet spot: no clanging, deafening combination of ambient music and people almost yelling to be heard. I can&#39;t abide a restaurant that is so loud that conversation between dinner companions becomes an Olympic sport! I do note that my previous review was five stars. Since that means &#34;as good as it gets&#34; I have to pull back from that rating just in light of the above comments. Still, this is a wonderful pick, and if you want a great wine, just bring your own bottle!"

This place serves tapas style portions and our server recommended that we get 4 dishes for 2 people.  We debated between the beets and the carrots, and based on our server&#39;s recommendation we got the carrots with whipped goat cheese.  The carrots were delicious!  For starch, we got the porcini ravioli which was out of this world.  I love mushrooms to begin with, but I think anyone would love this.  

For protein, we got the crispy quail with buttermilk biscuit, and the lamb belly.  The quail came in two pieces, perfect for the two of us to share.  It wasn&#39;t too gamey, and the biscuit was good.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever had lamb belly before, but it&#39;s less fatty and quite different from pork belly.  It was melt-in-your-mouth good.

Since the food was so good, we decided to get a dessert to share which didn&#39;t disappoint either.  We&#39;ll definitely go back!"

The waitress came by and recommended what seemed like 60% of menu. I think we got every single one of her recommendations and everything except the trout was really delicious. There was a lot of salt in every dish, but in a good way. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place if you&#39;re trying to watch your sodium intake.

The desserts were nothing special, but still really pricey. I&#39;d come back here to try out their other menus but will probably not be getting dessert again."

That cynic-flavored criticism went out the window when we stepped into mkt. 

This is a neighborhood restaurant that we walk by all the time. The menu is seasonal (woo!). Very friendly host who sat us exactly as we asked- side by side. Lovely server who felt so familiar and friendly I wanted to hangout afterwards with her. Atmosphere was spot on- warm, not too loud, relaxed. Did not feel rushed or intruded upon. At the same time we felt very well taken care of. 

The food--- best ravioli I have ever tasted, and I don&#39;t really like pasta. The filling:  mushroom and Parmesan beautifully married into a handmade pocket of pasta love. No other way to describe it than &#34;melt in your mouth&#34; good. 

The Brussels--- so savory and yet so light. Perfect in between the ravioli and or next dish- 

Wagyu steak- omg. I think I died with every bite. The crispy outer portion wonderfully complimented the tender, quality texture of the meat within. Perfectly cooked, beautifully presented. Loved every bit of it. 

And the wine! Was also delicious. Lastly, make sure you have a handsome man by your side for this spot, it&#39;s so much more enjoyable :)"

The chocolate cake was probably the best dessert. Not the best meal of my life but very good overall, great service and nice ambiance."

It was tough to get a reservation for 2 during Seattle restaurant week but we managed. Rainy Sunday night and the cozy place was still packed. 

We sat at the counter which faces the street which was surprisingly refreshing. Kinda nice to people watch in tangletown on a wet evening. 

Our waiter, Matt, was fantastic. Friendly and relaxed, answered questions with knowledge and calm. 

Dinner was delicious. 3 courses for Seattle restaurant week. They bring each individual dish out as it&#39;s ready so they recommend sharing the meal with your table. I liked this style of dining.

I love the open kitchen concept in this tiny little restaurant. The service was awesome. The food was delectable. I wanted to try every item on the menu, but I limited myself to 5. 

Zucchini and squash fritters: 5 little balls of fried goodness. I&#39;m obsessed with all things zucchini right now so I thought these were pretty good. The pesto that came with it was delicious!
Penn Cove Mussels with house made chorizo: I read house-made chorizo and had to get it. The mussels were cooked in a ginger lime sauce. It came with toasted bread that was just buttery goodness, and was even better doused with the ginger lime sauce. 
Pan-fried potato gnocchi with lamb: I&#39;m not much of a pasta person, but this was very good. The lamb was definitely the best part though, super tasty and not gamey at all. 
Whole grilled trout: This was a surprisingly good dish. I was worried that it would be too fishy but the corn/tomato sauce that came with the fish perfectly balanced the fishy-ness. I loved the crispy grilled skin. 
Grilled wagyu beef: MUST-ORDER. Medium rare. Nuff said."

The first clear day of Spring had now turned into the cotton candy sunset haze. It filled the Seattle evening sky as my good friend and I embarked on what the Capitol Hill neighborhood MKT had prepared for us. Yes we had reservations.

While we waited to be sat, we were brought complimentary Rosé, a pink splash of harmonious notes starting a perfect introduction into the dinner sequence.

Once sat, we gazed over the wine/app list, 
we paired the evening with reds, Malbec and a Saviongese. We were tied between two choices, but alas the heavenly butternut squash fritters with savory explosions of pasilla chile and pumpkin seed pesto won that round. 

The special app of night the beef tartare grasped my tongue through a wave of soft marinade and smoked soaked tea quail egg and topped with crispy onions and accompanied grilled bread.

A quick interlude of Leek Soup, not too sure the actual name, but think cream of mushroom less rich, and more light.

Then the grilled hamachi collar with a light drizzle glaze played on the bottom, a first for me, along with wanting to eat peas for the first time of my life as English peas burst with flavor and overall wholesome taste.

Crispy fried quail, celeriac puree, with apple cider reduction. Yes. That&#39;s right. Cue the tears. I asked chef Alvin if I could get a bucket &#39;o quail to go - he thought I was kidding... Also recommended homemade biscuits, imagine?

Then for the showstopper, ladies and gentleman the grilled to perfection medium rare holy grail 
Grilled wagyu beef. Cut to perfection crusted every curve of this hunk of meat with peppercorn. Dishes with rosemary fingerling potatoes, fried onions, served on top of a delicious red wine sauce. Someone get this lady her inhaler!

Whew. To finish chocolate Pannacotta. A perfect ending to my overwhelmed tour of Old McDonalds farm.

My reacquainted friend smirked as she was impressed as I was. We looked and knew we had just shared a special bond over a truly memorable food experience.

Serious farm to table quality. 

MKT job well done *slow clap* Sarah, General Anais and Chef Alvin, I thank you."

I tried to get reservations for this place last SRW and it was nearly impossible. I definitely made these reservations pretty early in advance to ensure a spot because this place is tiny! We came and our table wasn&#39;t ready yet for about 10 minutes. Our server, Ani was super nice and treated us to some delicious grapefruit soda while we waited. A couple at sitting at a larger table offered us their extra seats table to us while we waited. Super thoughtful! 

We finally got our table and went over the menu to pick out our three courses. Appetizers - we went with the ice cucumber/hamachi and lamb sausages. Both were excellent! I would lean towards the sausages being the winner. However the hamachi was very bright! 
Entree - the hardest part of deciding. Everything sounded delicious and we asked for some recommendations from Ani. In the end, it was such a tough decision that we decided to get the pork tenderloin, scallops, and we even added on the porcini and squash ravioli. I would have to say the scallops were my favorite then the ravioli. The texture of the scallops were everything you&#39;d want it to be - tender and melt in your mouth goodness. The ravioli had a really comforting feel and beyond delicious with the truffle oil!
Dessert - pumpkin panna cotta with pomegranates and chocolate cake with almond cream. Mmmmmmm. It doesn&#39;t get much better than this.

After trying Staple and Fancy and How to Cook a Wolf, this would have to be my favorite Ethan Stowell restaurant. The service was impeccable! Thanks to the staff, Michael + Ani, and sorry I didn&#39;t catch the other server&#39;s name. Cute, tiny restaurant that is bursting with delicious food. I&#39;ll definitely be back."

The restaurant has an open kitchen concept with 3-4 tables and bar seating for about 8, 4 facing the kitchen and the other 4 facing the window. It was pretty difficult to get online reservations for 6:30pm since Mkt is so popular, but I was able to call and arrange for 6:30pm seating at the bar. Bar seating was amazing.

The waiter was nice enough to let my friend and I take our time to decide what to order. Each dish is prepared to share. We were recommended 2-3 dishes per person and decided to go with 4 total. We were given an amuse bouche to start. The first dish was the butternut squash fritters, which were very tasty. The fritters are fried and made of strings of squash, which was interesting since it was better than what I had expected. However, it was quite salty. The next dish was the mussels. There was nothing particularly special about the mussels in my opinion. They were certainly tasty. Don&#39;t forget to use the tiny mussel fork! The next dish was the Yukon potato gnocchi with beef cheek. The gnocchi was tender as was the beef cheek. The dish also contained chestnuts, which I love. So overall I thought this was the best dish of the evening and highly recommend it. Finally, the last dish was the wagyu beef. I didn&#39;t like this one as much because I heard so many great things about wagyu beef and this wasn&#39;t as tender as I was hoping. I&#39;ve had better beef elsewhere.

Overall though, the dining experience was excellent. The food was great and the service was excellent. The most amusing part of the experience was seeing the chefs take photos of their own food."

The woman on the phone gave us a spot at the counter, which was awesome! From where we were sitting, we could see the kitchen, and the whole process. The head chef that night was Roy I believe? It was so cool to watch him and others prepare all the food throughout our meal, and he even gave us a free plate of their version of mexican corn, which was incredibly well-done. Everything is family style, so each dish came out one at a time, and everything was delicious. We started with the baguette, which came with herb butter and I think it was peach jam, which were both very good. Second was the roasted winter squash, which was extremely flavorful and had several different textures, and was a great recommendation by the server. Third we had the ravioli, which had a wonderful creamy sauce. Finally, we had the seared sea scallops, which a sweet and savory puree of parsnip and apple, and was both beautifully presented and the scallops were extremely tender. I&#39;m usually not a fan of scallops, but these were cooked perfectly. Dinner for the two of us, with the included gratuity, came out to around $80, so definitely not an every day restaurant, but it was an amazing experience, if I would return for special occasions.

We sat at the &#34;chefs table&#34; which was a bar overlooking the kitchen but not with the best views, and the bar stools were rather uncomfortable. On to the food:
- squash: good but not great, pieces of squash were a little large, would have loved to have more mushrooms
- hamachi: great flavor, but this is advertised as a ceviche which it is not. It is raw hamachi with ceviche sauce/components mixed in. Great flavor, just misrepresented. 
- mussels: very good, very fresh mussels with a lovely sauce - not the best I&#39;ve had in my lifetime but still one that I went back to dip all the bread into 
- mushroom ravioli: buttery, rich, homemade pasta, velvety - great last course
- amuse bouche for being at the chefs table: soft boiled egg with romesco - well seasoned, especially enjoyed the pickled onions that really brightened it up
- nectarine sorbet and shortbread: great flavor, good texture, smooth

Overall - didn&#39;t get 5 stars because I felt that a couple of the courses failed to be exceptional. That said I would certainly come back, prices were fair for the caliber of the food and the service."

Tonight was my 2nd visit, last one was maybe 2 years ago? For some reason I always forget that this is one of Ethan Stowell&#39;s restaurants. Trust me, if he owns it, it will be delicious. 

The restaurant is quaint and tiny with plenty of neighborhood charm. Simple and rustic and very cozy... perfect on a chilly evening but equally inviting in the summer.

We shared four dishes as suggested by our server. We started with the green beans. They were really yummy and made me exclaim, &#34;These taste better than French fries!&#34;
Next the Hamachi ceviche..best ceviche I&#39;ve had. Plump marinated juicy pieces of fresh hamachi.
Parmesan ravioli mushroom was next...buttery and mushrooms...good. Not my favorite dish but still tasty.
WAGYU STEAK!!!!!!! Holy smokes. Best steak I have ever eaten. Seriously..texture, flavor...amazing. I woke up thinking about how delicious it was. Hence my review while laying here in bed.

Oh, try the barrel aged Negroni. Nom.

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we shared tapas style.  We ordered the ravioli, sea scallions, and beef.  For dessert we had the strawberry tart.  For drinks I had rose and he ordered one of their cocktails.

The ravioli was amazing.  Must have. It was so flavorful without being too rich. I can&#39;t recommend it enough.

The sea scallions were good. I enjoyed them but would be open to trying something else in their place for my next visit.

The beef was ridiculously good.  Melt in your mouth. Again, perfect flavoring and complemented by perfectly cooked onions - I HATE onions but gobbled these up.

Dessert wise - solid. I&#39;m not a huge sweets person so I enjoy the entrees more but dessert was nice.

They have a large wine collection but not much for cocktails as there isn&#39;t a full bar.  That being said, the cocktail my boyfriend ordered was very smooth and good."

Surprised at how small and neighborly the restaurant was - only a few tables and a small bar near the window. The open kitchen and two person cook staff were fun to watch if you&#39;re into that. If dining alone or with one other, I&#39;d recommend sitting at the bar so you can watch the action.

Started with a few oysters; pear mignonette was great. Seattle is oyster paradise.

Then Dungeness crab salad - good contrast and balance. Olives were delicious. Sorel and pine nuts. I&#39;d get this again for sure.

Chef handed me a small dish on the house; can&#39;t remember exactly what it was but I enjoyed it a lot. I want to say it was a wine braised beef cheek or something like that.

Herbed popover stuffed with sweet potato, maitaki mushrooms, caramelized onions, and parm cream sauce was next. It was dank; could&#39;ve had a few of these bad boys and been very happy.

Porcini ricotta ravs were also unreal. Inspired to get the pasta machine out and mimic. Super simple dish but texture/balance was executed so perfectly.

Finished off with the cheese plate. Solid move. Double creme bri and a sheep cheese if I remember correctly. The fig conserva was the best spread possible for this cheese board. Pears, toasted walnuts, and crostini accompanied. Vin santo on the house, which was a delightful pairing.

No complaints on the wine throughout dinner. Lots of local options.

Service was also perfect.

Looking forward to my next Ethan Stowell experience. Always an amazing meal."

First of all the location is great. I always forget that there is such a cute little neighborhood tucked back there near Greenlake. The restaurant is tiny and they only have a few tables and bar style seating. If you are sitting at the bar area you can watch the chefs work. My only complaint was that the large wooden chairs were not very comfortable. 

The first courses were really the only misses of the night. The carrot fritters were awesome. I&#39;m not sure how they were cooked but they were not fried like one might expect (or if they were you sure tricked me!). It tasted kind of like I&#39;d expect a baked carrot falafel to taste. All I know is I loved them and could have eaten bowls of them. The other two starters were less impressive. The hamachi ceviche was bland and boring and the foraged salad was just okay. The portion sizes were also tiny for appetizers.

The main courses were phenomenal. I&#39;m not a red meat eater, but I tried the wagyu beef and it was amazing. It was perfectly cooked, tender, and just melt in your mouth good. The sauce on top was great and I wish there was more. The halibut was delicious too. I normally refrain from ordering halibut at restaurants because it is such a bland white fish, but they managed to add just enough seasoning to make it very tasty. The white wine sauce that it was served with stole the night. My god I have not had that good of a sauce is so long. I definitely contemplated licking the plate clean but somehow managed to contain myself. 

The desserts were all great too. My favorite was the lemon pudding cake. It was light and refreshing but still full of flavor. The chocolate budino was a velvety and rich chocolate pudding that I could have eaten a whole tub of. Even the pear anise sorbet was delicious. 

The food here is fantastic and the staff is nice and attentive. I will definitely be back!"

For $28, you get a three course meal.. and it was an awesome deal for Mkt. The food was delicious and the service was great. They offered four different choices for each of the three courses for their SRW menu. We chose the following:

First course: 
- Hamachi ceviche: Large, fresh slices of fish with champagne ice on top. It was really refreshing to eat and almost melt in your mouth good!
- Crispy fried quail: There&#39;s two, perfect for sharing with your date. The quail is perfectly lightly fried and flavored that I probably could&#39;ve eaten two myself though.. maybe I won&#39;t share next time ;)  

Main course: 
- Roasted lamb shank &amp; spice lamb sausage: I think this is the first time I&#39;ve tried lamb sausage? and it was really good! It was really juicy and seasoned really well. The roasted lamb was amazing too... so tender we used our forks to cut it apart to devour.
- Grilled wagyu beef: The meat was perfectly cooked, tender, juicy and had an amazing smokey flavor. The fingerling potatoes and fried spring onions complemented the beef really well too.

Dessert: 
- Chocolate malted budino: We didn&#39;t know what budino was but it&#39;s pretty much pudding. I know chocolate pudding sounds boring, but it was actually really good! It wasn&#39;t too rich and was perfectly creamy.. which made it easy to finish it all. 
- Pear anise sorbet: I always choose any dessert with pear so it was an easy decision to try this. There were two large scoops of sorbet with several slices of poached pear on the side. Yum! The first bite caught me off guard though because it didn&#39;t have the typical &#34;pear&#34; flavor, and reminded me more of Asian pear. No complaints though, I loved how I could tell there was real fruit in each scoop of sorbet I ate.

Overall, five stars. The bf and I were impressed with all the food we tried and service was outstanding too. Also, portion size for each dish was perfect. We finished off our plates because the food was delicious, and it was enough to make us full but not stuffed. 

Note: Parking is free on the street and there&#39;s plenty around since Mkt. is surrounded by neighborhoods. Also, the restaurant is TINY (and cute) so make sure you make reservations :)"

First, the service was poor...we had a reservation, but still had to wait 30 minutes to get seated and order, and they misunderstood how we wanted our dinner timed and held back the entree, without asking.  Finally, we caught two extra items on the bill that we hadn&#39;t ordered.
Worst of all, the food was mediocre.  The &#34;roasted&#34; vegetables in the salad were warmed, at best, and the ravioli was bland and crunchy.  We did enjoy the beet salad.
Given that they apologized several times for making us wait and over-charging, I would have thought they would have offered a free dessert or other compensation, but that they didn&#39;t.  They also didn&#39;t ask if our food was satisfactory.
You can do better for the amount of money they charge!  The menu is typical &#34;new&#34; cuisine and the space cramped, even if they do manage to get you seated on time and cook your food when you order."

grilled green beans...it was a discovery last year and should be a part of everyone&#39;s diet now.  hamachi was good, although maybe needing a big more citrus.   

the pork tenderloin was outstanding.  moist and well seasoned, it was the stand out of the night.  the lamb was also good, but maybe a notch below.  i think it only paled because we had it last.  

my only complaints are that there is no place to wait for your seats and that there aren&#39;t enough veggies accompanying the proteins.  it&#39;s skimpy and if you love it, you only get a nibble."

The duck breast with figs was delightful. I would 100% go back just for that. I never really enjoy fish other than salmon, but the fish I had there was crispy on the outside and melt-in-your mouth amazing on the inside. Beef tartare was okay, nothing too special there.

The waiter recommended that we each get 2/3 items from the menu which totaled to 8 plus dessert-looking back we should have ordered 6 items because they also served bread. They serve it family style so essentially everyone gets to try everything if they want to and below was what we got: 

Spiced pumpkin fritters, cardamom, allspice, herb pesto- good but heavy

Seared sea scallops, smoked manila clams, thyme-butter sauce, salsify, roasted carrots- really really food

Shigoku oysters, pear mignonette- I didn&#39;t taste this but the person who ate it liked it

Wagyu beef crusted with peppercorn, rosemary, grilled fingerling potatoes, fried onions, red wine sauce- really good and well seasoned

Braised venison, sweet potato gnocchi, rosemary, roasted quince - delicious; highlight of the night for me

Garlic polenta, spiced roasted root vegetables, balsamic reduction, olives, pumpkin seeds- really good- def. recommend ordering this (third highlight of the night) 

Porcini-ricotta ravioli, marjoram, roasted garlic butter sauce, Parmesan- this was delicious; second highlight of the night 

Beef/Steak Tartare (not listed on the menu): the guys ate this and seemed to enjoy it


Panna Cotta: amazing. They don&#39;t publish their dessert menu because it changes so often but this was out of this world good

I asked for a mocktail and it was yummy.

I can&#39;t remember what they all were now, but the standouts for me were the ravioli and the hamachi. The ravioli was one of the best raviolis I&#39;ve ever had. It was perfectly al dente with a rich and savory sauce and delicious porcini-ricotta filling. The flavors of the hamachi ceviche were crisp and refreshing. The ingredients didn&#39;t overwhelm the fish, but let it shine. Some dishes were better than others but there wasn&#39;t a bad apple in the bunch."

The flavors on some items were alright, but nothing terrific. Additionally, we were told by the wait staff that two items per person is about the right amount of food. Unfortunately, we were not told that would be the right amount of food if all we wanted was appetizers. Quantities were quite tiny. My wife and I are small people, and we were left hungry (we ate everything edible). The prices in no way line up appropriately with either quantity or quality. There appeared to be poor quality control, as several pieces of tomato were inedible due to brown spots and holes, one very likely where a worm had been. All said and done, I can&#39;t and won&#39;t recommend this establishment to anyone, after eating 1/4 of the items on the menu (decent sample size). We left hungry after spending over $100. I don&#39;t understand why we paid such a high price, as no part of it was above average - the food, the atmosphere, the service. To us at least, it seems we were paying for the Ethan Stowell name, which is simply that, a name."

Got to stop by mkt. for my Bday. I will admit that I am a big fan of Ethan Stowell. I regularly dine at all is places, but that by no means is an indication that he gets an automatic pass on any new place. In fact, I have mentioned my concern for opening any new places. I do not want to see this man spread too thin.

mkt. did not disappoint on any level. This is a beautiful and very intimate space seating maybe 30? Well designed and too tiny for a bar. There are 3 barrel aged cocktails that are all really well balanced and delicious! 

FOOD:

Snacks/starters...

Why not get one of everything?
Grilled and marinated string beans. Perfection in a glass!. Correct density and correct salt.

Fennel pollen and orange marinated nicoise olives. Really tasty and a nice go to between other courses.

Lemon thyme zucchini fritters with herb pesto. These were ridiculous. Just perfect texture and flavor. Amazing.

Pumpernickel, cured salmon, dill creme fraiche. Simple clean and perfect. Nice balance of flavor.

Dinah&#39;s cheese, walnuts, tomato honey preserve. I could have made a meal of this. It just all meshed together so well and I could have had 3 plates full!


Fish:

Hamachi ceviche, citrus cucumber ice coriander, pickled red onion. Very nice. Not WOW nice but really solid, particularly if you love Hamachi.

Dungeness crab salad, tart apple, tarragon, endive. This WAS WOW! Really exceptional and if you get one thing, this would be something to look at!

Meats:

Grilled rabbit - super nice! Flavorful and well prepared!

Fried Quail - deliscious, well executed and flavors were spot on. Only problem I have with the quail, MORE PLEASE!

Grilled pork tenderloin - great bargain! Well portioned and cooked PERFECTLY, just above medium rare, soft and succulent!

Veg:

Slow roasted veg salad with summer greens. I am a HIGE fan of cold veg! This did not disappoint. Everything was excellent including the soft boiled egg.

Smoked mushrooms with lightly fried duck egg. Absurdly good. LOVE duck egg anything. The smoke on the shrooms was perfect and left with just the slightest odor of that smoke in my sweater so I had a great trip home enjoying that over and over.....is it weird I kept asking the girl to smell my arm?

Desert:

Fig tart with pistachio gelato.....WOW!!!! REALLY perfection on a plate! LOVED every single bite!!

All in all and exceptional experience. THe place is sooooo very small but I like that about it. You are literally sitting on the kitchen for many of the tables. 

Our server Seth was super awesome! Fun guy and presented everything perfectly. Gracious and friendly as were the rest of the staff.

Ethan Stowell, thank you for another great place. I will again implore that you remain happy with your success and don&#39;t open anything else!!! 

For those of you thinking about coming by...YES...YES...YES....you will be glad you did!!"

Lots of great restaurants in those great cities are tucked into neighborhoods, and feel like hidden gems.

At mkt. we felt exactly that way, as if we traveled to another time and place, almost a restaurant speak-easy, in a tiny jewel-box of a space, spare grey and black walls, dark, moody lighting, uber modern setting, with a full, open fire-breathing kitchen. Tiny and very sophisticated, mkt. is a new Ethan Stowell restaurant, with executive chef, Joel Ritchie at the helm, and a small crew of very polished and attractive staff.

Portions are small and shared, with sort of family-style tapas-inspired dishes, all served with bread and all of of which are excellent, particularly any in the fish line-up. Keep in mind, this spot is spendy.  Its also small.  Beware of online reservations: in response to ours, we got a call that we&#39;d be given bar seating and were pretty disappointed after going to the trouble to reserve ahead. Fortunately, we were upgraded to a small table: a much better seat for date night.

We ordered the Dungeness crab salad with tart apple, tarragon, and endive,  Next the albacore ceviche with citrus-cucumber ice, coriander, pickled red onions.  We really loved the addition of the flavored ice in the dish. (We just watched the El Bulli documentary last weekend, and loved this idea of flavor enhanced ice. It was fun to try a riff of this interesting concept.)

We loved the fried quail, which evoked memories of the smallest, tastiest fried chicken we&#39;d ever eaten, accompanied by plum sauce.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of quail, but it was surprisingly moist and satisfying as only fried chicken (or apparently, quail) can be. We ordered a savory mushroom ravioli dish  --really fantastic and tasted like something you&#39;d might order up in Rome.  The chef offered up a tiger prawn dish, that we thought was smoky and tasty, and something I&#39;d definitely order again.  One of the dishes (forgetting which now) had a cold offering of truffled potatoes on the side.  That was disappointing.  Besides not liking the temperature, we absolutely couldn&#39;t taste any fresh shaved white truffles, and while I&#39;m sure they were there, its a sad, sad thing to waste the taste of truffles.)  Still, mostly hits and just one miss.

Several excellent cocktails are served here, and wine by the bottle and glass.

Every now and then, we travel to SF and NYC to satisfy our love for big city life.  Now apparently, we can just drive to Tangletown.  How cool is that?"

Especially the nettle ravioli in a brown butter sauce (with lemon zest and marjoram!!) - savored every bite. The hamachi ceviche, while being perfectly prepared with a cool cucumber ice, and which also blew my mind, is not a sustainable fish so I wish they&#39;d replace it with something else. The hamachi was a little lost in it anyways, so another fish could be an improvement. The wagyu wasn&#39;t quite all on Yelp have touted it to be, but was delicious. We also had the grilled green beans and whole trout, both of which were great.

I&#39;m writing this so that I can rave about the staff. From the time we were seated until we left, we were treated with nothing but smiles and really great customer service. Our server did a great job of reading the table and really catered our experience to our needs.

Lots of good wines choices, handful by the glass or share a bottle, and really interesting choices on the menu for things to eat. The wine was a bit on the higher end though, so if you&#39;re coming in with the expectation to share a bottle be prepared to spend a little extra.

The space is a nice, open area with tables, seating at the chefs counter with a limited view, as well as a community table at the front that is half outside and half in. I was a little unsure about sitting at the community table but after being there I did enjoy it and would be open to it again.

Food wise we tried a handful of things on the menu but a couple of the highlights were the scallops, corn grits, and the green beans. The scallops were nice and buttery and cooked perfectly, some of the best I&#39;ve had in Seattle. The grits were awesome, I&#39;d say these are best tried with one bite with everything together (cheese, pork belly, grits, and seabeans). The green beans seemed really simple, but tasted excellent. They were lemon and sea salt green beans and I wish I could make them that good at home. Very fresh, and full of flavor. 

Overall we had a good experience, it&#39;s definitely a solid pick for a great dinner. Not going to blow you away but it definitely won&#39;t disappoint and you&#39;ll leave pretty satisfied. Price wise, outside the wine, this place was also a pretty good deal!"

This is the second Ethan Stowell restaurant I&#39;ve been too, and I definitely want to try more. It&#39;s the perfect place for a fancier meal. Our server recommended two dishes per person, but I think it depends on what dishes you choose. Within each category, the dishes are listed from smallest to largest portion.

We ordered the pear salad (medium), fried oysters (small), grits and sausage (medium), and scallops(large) and splurged on a financier&#39;s cake and we were extremely full. In retrospect, I would omit the oysters. We liked all the dishes. My SO liked the scallops, and we got three, which I thought was a good portion. I especially liked the grits and the cake.

Service was very good ... attentive and friendly.  The wine list is spendy but has some interesting choices.  The sparkling wine from bordeaux is awesome.  

It was pleasant outside ... probably around 70 ... but at our tables it was warm ... not too warm, but I&#39;m also not sure I&#39;d want to be in those inner tables on a hot day.

The radicchio in the Castelfranco salad was pretty bitter for my taste, but overall still a worthy dish.  The wagyu beef had great beef flavor but I&#39;d prefer maybe a more rich sauce/seasoning.  

Everything was cooked to a perfect level of doneness.

I was very impressed with how mkt. has squeezed a functional kitchen into such a small space.  It&#39;s a fun little space.  I saw they have the walk in around back in the parking garage."

First of all, the place is very small and the kitchen is open. I know that this is the new hip thing to do for restaurants, but, especially in such small places, you end up smelling like fried meat by the time you leave the place. Not cool. The food was meh, some things were OK some things terrible. Good presentation, not great flavor, tiny tiny portions (the &#34;lamb sausage&#34; was actually 3 slices of lamb sausage.) The steak I had was so coated in pepper that this morning I have a blister in my mouth.

The taste from the kitchen had great flavour, the combination of sweetness with licorice stuck out to me, although the endive(?) was oddly dry and bland. 
The green beans were simple, bright, and had just the right amount of charring. 
The lamb dish was prepared well, lots of interesting textures to explore, although I was unable to taste any horseradish in the dish.

Their menu changes based on what is local and fresh.  We have dined here multiple time and never disappointed with the food or the service.

We brought family from out of town for a nice dinner.  For a table of 4 we ordered 2 snacks, 5 dishes and 2 desserts - Grilled green beans, Roasted beet salad, Hamachi ceviche with citrus-cucumber ice, Grilled Alaskan king salmon with English peas, Semolina pasta with morels and Parmesan, Grilled wagyu beef, Rhubarb tart, and Chocolate terrine.  I would highly recommend the Green beans are simple but addicting, Hamachi ceviche as the hamachi is fresh and the cucumber ice is very unique, Semolina pasta was delicious with fresh handmade pasta, Grilled wagyu is cooked to perfect medium rare, and Chocolate terrine is a must if you like chocolate.  Everything was amazing but my recommendations are based on menu items we order every time we come back.

mkt. was my last meal for Seattle Restaurant Week. Unknowingly I had saved the best for last.

The space in here is small. Be prepared for unintentional intimate conversation with your neighbors, at least before the food gets to your table. Once the meal started I was literally lost in my own little world.

I can&#39;t say enough about the service here. The hostess and waitstaff were phenomenal. Kind, funny, and genuinely passionate about what they were serving in an honest way. Our friends weren&#39;t seated until 30 minutes after their 9:30 reservation, so the staff comped them a round of sparkling wine to ease the wait.

The food here is on another culinary level. Part molecular gastronomy, part local organic, 100% flavor. The crispy duck confit appetizer had wonderful texture but lacked a sweet component (corroborated independently by 3 of us). Honestly that was my only &#34;complaint&#34;. The hamachi ceviche was a strange combination of buttery fish and cold champagne ice. A surprisingly good bite.

The entree&#39;s were the shining stars though. The wagyu beef was amazingly tender and had robust beefy flavor. The onion rings were light and sweet, they actually reminded us of fruit loops, in a great way. The beef here was better than el Gaucho! The lamb entree was without a doubt the best thing I ate during my 9 meal SRW. The sausage and greens alone would make an amazing sandwich filling.

Even their malted budino (pudding) was a rich and buttery revelation. For 2 guys who don&#39;t have much a sweet tooth we were raving about the budino and lemon cake. They were perfect compliments to each other and a great way to end the meal.

I was so fortunate to dine here and I couldn&#39;t have picked a better place for my 100th review! I really can&#39;t wait to return to try their full menu out. I know it will be worth every penny!!"

The space is tiny. I think there were 3 four-seat tables, 3 two-seat tables, and 3 seats at the bar. It is so small that all tables share a separation wall with the kitchen. The wall only goes up to 4 or 5 feet. At some point in the evening, one cook was working right behind me on the other side of the wall, and splashed oil... You guessed it, I felt drops of oil on my head, and got one on my glasses and several on my jacket...

Anyway, service was pleasant. Bread was so-so. 
Starter was zucchini and carrot fritters with a creamy mint sauce. It reminded me of onion bhaji. Pretty good. I think we did well to share and get 3 tiny balls each, because it wasn&#39;t something I would have eaten 10 of.
Wagyu beef and fingerling potatoes were OK. It really wasn&#39;t melt-in-your-mouth beef, and the fingerlings were a bit starchy in the center. The wine reduction sauce was very salty. Still good, but not special.
Excellent dessert: strawberry tart with ice cream. Nicely done.
Overall, I am not sure I would say it&#39;s worth the long drive to come back (and I would have to wear rain gear inside the restaurant ;-)."

The restaurant is very small but super adorable - there are wine bottles everywhere and food words all over the wall.  The tables are close together, but we felt like we had enough space to ourselves.

We shared the grilled and marinated green beans, the hamachi ceviche, the dungeness crab salad, and the sweet potato gnocchi with smoked mushrooms.  Everything was delicious - I would have to recommend it all!  Our total bill, including a glass of wine each, came out to about $75 before tip.  A little pricy, but it was all incredibly good so worth it.  We will definitely have to come back!

This is one of the newer Ethan Stowell restaurants, and honestly, I have no idea how he found this place.  Was the space meant to be THIS small?  What else could have ever belonged here? I could only imagine something like a wall of bookshelves for a quaint little bookstore.  However, that is why Ethan Stowell is the genius that he is; for such a tiny space, he utilizes ever square inch to its fullest potential.  I walked in feeling like I had just entered someone&#39;s home kitchen.  And while all of his restaurants give you a glance into their kitchens, there is actually counter seating here that lets you look directly into theirs -- so you can drool as you watch your food being prepared.   

We had 8pm reservations but the party before us hadn&#39;t vacated the table yet, so we didn&#39;t end up getting seated until close to 830pm.  (The only reason I&#39;ve given this place 4 starts, instead of 5).  Luckily, there&#39;s a bar next door so we had a drink or two while we waited.  There is literally no waiting area, as the door opens awkwardly into the establishment, the hostess stand is directly in front as you walk in, and a coat hanger is mounted behind the door. 

With that all being said, let&#39;s get to the important stuff: the FOOD.  The menu options change frequently (it changed at least twice in the last three weeks) but it sounds like they have some consistent menu options as well.  Like his other restaurants, dishes are served family-style and we were advised to choose two dishes per person.  

We ordered:

-- Slow roasted vegetable salad, baby lettuces, sourdough croutons, soft cooked egg: A simple dish that let the sweetness of the veggies speak for themselves. Perfectly roasted.  
-- Smoked wild mushrooms, sweet potato gnocchi, crispy shallots, thyme: light and comforting gnocchi made interesting with the crispiness of the shallots (though the mushrooms were just *slighty* over-salted.)  
-- Seared Muscovy duck, fried brussel sprouts, tart cherry sauce: If you&#39;re not usually a big fan of duck, try the preparation here.  You don&#39;t get the gamey-ness here (that you are confronted with at many Asian restaurants) but the flavors are still there.  Though I thought the duck was a little under-seasoned, when you got a mouthful of the duck + cherries + fried brussel sprouts, it was PERFECT.  
-- Grilled spot prawns, red chili aioli, arugula, pickled citron: They offer you a small fork to peel the prawns out of their shells, but I found my hands worked just fine.  The prawns were amazing and I could have eaten an entire bowl. 

For dessert, we ordered the the pear tarte with pistachio gelato.  To date, I hadn&#39;t really cared for any of the desserts I&#39;ve had at any Ethan Stowell restaurants, but this was really good.  Slightly sweet pistachio gelato, on top of pears that still held their texture, and a wonderfully baked crust.   

Service was attentive, friendly, and inviting.  We were never left looking for anyone or wanting anything.  

LOVED.  Can we make this a weekly thing?"

Do be prepared to be flexible. They do the annoying &#34;it comes out when it&#39;s prepared&#34; thing here. Which is great if you&#39;re with a group with similar tastes and all want to share. Notsomuch if it&#39;s 2-3 of you and you don&#39;t. The seating situation is kind of strange. You might get crammed at a tiny table. You might get seated waaaaaaay across from each other at the communal table. Or maybe next to each other at the communal table. 

For a more traditional, and equally delightful, meal-- head across the street to Eva. 

Anyway- my cocktails were perfect. My dining partner had to return their wine. It tasted sour. The second glass was much better. 

The food was hit or miss. Nothing was a stand-out, but neither was any of it offensive.

The dining room is very pretty. The people here are serious about food. If you like that thing-- it&#39;ll be right up your alley. If it bugs you-- yeah, go to Eva instead.  

I&#39;ll be back, sure. But, this one isn&#39;t on my craveable list."

Those three absolutelys should make you want to come here.

I told the girl I&#39;m seeing that I had planned this great date for her (selfishly I picked mkt because I wanted to try it really bad). I was surprised that I was able to snag a 745pm reservation, especially given that the restaurant is so small. There was ample parking and it was easy to find. Score. 

We were seated quickly, despite being a little early. The menu was terrible because I wanted to order EVERYTHING. I had multiple arguments with myself, with my date and even had to ask our server for his opinion before I finally decided. But I am so glad I did. We ordered the green beans, crab salad, sweet potato gnocchi, grilled wagu beef and the roasted pear and pistatio tart. The date had two glasses of wine too (our server recommended and she loved it). 

Everything was good. Each item was brought out to order, though I wish it had come faster, it was THAT good. Literally, everything was delicious. This was one of the few meals where I wasn&#39;t let down with any part of it. 

Mkt is a little expensive but I think good food is worth it. Plus, one of the servers stopped at our table to say, &#34;I like that you guys are sitting side by side. It&#39;s really cute.&#34; 

Pretty sure I impressed my date by taking her to mkt."

mkt-seattle,Marie B.,FDhTVmQWUyDWoPIBGgScAA,"Shoreline, WA",1,1,0,27,52,x2akArXrhSExzAhiEGo20Q,2.0,2014-02-16,"Disclaimer: I&#39;m a big fan of Chef Stowell, enjoyed talking to him at Elliott Bay Books, and have been to all of his currently open restaurants except Bar Cotto and Red Cow. 

College friend and I canceled a reservation at Aragona to try out mkt....we waited weeks for this reservation as a belated Christmas get together. I had even higher expectations since former management from Ray&#39;s Boathouse talked it up and I value their opinions. 

Crummy weather aside, we lucked out with street parking by Zoka. Walked into mkt. Folks are not kidding how small this place is!. It bears repeating, reservations are imperative! Size wise in contrast, I like the layout of How to Cook A Wolf better. I would not want to be here during a major earthquake....the multitude of wine bottles that would cascade down and make a spectacular mess! Barely step through the door and one is right smack by the host/reception stand. 

I decided to keep my coat on the entire time. College friend had the banquette side of the seating arrangement, I had the supposed &#39;chair&#39;. Goodness are we in preschool? They were designed with no back, plus wait staff used them as step stools to get wine bottles above. Ick. Maybe they ran out of fancy wood or this is a gimmick to guarantee no place to drape one&#39;s coat/bag, definitely not a place to linger. Is this even legal ADA wise? 

Moving on - we were greeted, seated, handed menus, given water - the usual routine. The host and then the wait person seemed pleasant enough. Anticipation was still high.

Expect extreme closeness - tables are very, very, very close. I&#39;m sure no wait staff can have Kim K/JLo derrieres or literally it would sweep things off of your table. Also, for some reason the six top next to us really started to get on my nerves. I like dining out too, but really we don&#39;t need to have an audible rolling narration of your meal and the constant photography of your plates. The other four top on the other side ordered so sparingly. Seriously are you satisfied with that one green bean? Okay maybe it was a progressive meal to be continued elsewhere. Onward...

We got an overview of the menu offerings and recommendations. No specials and the menu evidently changes daily. Comparing the menu to what I saw online earlier  - very similar but with some tweaks based on most likely availability and keeping in season. Also, received Tall Grass Bakery baguette slices with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar while perusing the menu.

We put in an order for the slow roasted vegetable salad and the smoked sockeye salmon on toasted Tall Grass Bakery pumpernickel and dill crème fraiche to start (both $9 each). The former - tasty execution and would make me eat more vegetables, however the soft cooked egg had too much finishing salt. The latter I enjoyed thoroughly, but should have not ordered in order to save room. 

When we put in our main orders, coincidentally both of us wanted the braised lamb shank and spice crusted loin with wild mushrooms, and sautéed baby kale ($27 each), we were rather taken aback when our wait person questioned whether we wanted to just share it and order another selection. She wouldn&#39;t let up until I said we would ask for a takeout box if we couldn&#39;t finish it. Goodness, can&#39;t we order what we selected??? My mistake was also not asking whether the shank was bone in or not. When it came time to receive our identical entrees, we blinked and looked at each other. Had we shared this entrée, we would have had to have dueling forks to divvy up the lamb. Very tasty but kind of spare for the price. College friend yearned for a carb to go with this. Even just a dollop of parsnip or sweet potato would have been perfect. 

Again, wait person made the assumption that we couldn&#39;t possibly want dessert. And one of us was a former assistant pastry chef, of course, there has to be dessert. I&#39;ve never met a wait person who would not be happy that each member of the party wanted starters, mains, and dessert. Granted no one could push barrel aged cocktails or wine on us since we don&#39;t drink.

Our dessert choices ($8 each) were the blood orange sorbetto with a salted vanilla shortbread cookie and the walnut cake, roasted pear with grappa anglaise. The blood orange sorbetto would have had a better effect in a flute vs. a giant bowl (seen similar at a Japanese restaurant used to serve curry katsu don). I liked it, however I&#39;d pass on the shortbread. Too much salt.  College friend liked her walnut cake selection, however, the anglaise was too thin. That would run off a wooden spoon (technique-wise). We also shared the French press coffee (Caffe Vita, 18 ounces, $7), got the cream, but had to wait for the sugar. No tongs. Later was served the bitter dregs as our press was taken away. Not cool.

With tax/tip it came out to $125....probably should have kept the Aragona reservation, sad to admit. An outlier meal vs other ESR stellar ones."

 It is the kind of place that has mugs with the names of all the regulars hanging from the ceiling. Cozy, with lots of booth seating in addition to the bar seats. The bartender was friendly and came to our table a few times to ask us if we needed anything.There is a patio out front, but since I am not a smoker and it was very smokey, I didn&#39;t go out there.

 The prices seemed low, but maybe I&#39;m just used to paying way too much for drinks in San Francisco! Either way I enjoyed myself and escaped at the end of the night with a lot of cash still in my pocket."

Service was friendly and quick and the Bloody Mary and old-fashioned were just fine nothing scary... Nice and clean, I think the place has recently been remodeled well done...  fishing decor but clearly up to date, simple and stylish.
   Gotta say, the Caesar salad was more like coleslaw.. And no pepper! Not on the table and he didn&#39;t offer. That sucks. The walnut and honey shrimp could&#39;ve been totally up to par. .had it but a smidgen of walnuts...for $11.00 Just sad. Crap like that makes me fear what&#39;s coming.
   Can&#39;t complain about the prod its fine for bait. But, the potato we&#39;re undercooked. Kind of like the romaine in the Caesar salad awfully white. tartar sauce looks like Mayo with stuff in it. Tasted like it too.
  Okay, I&#39;m skipping the desert I know I can get anything better elsewhere. They&#39;re not bad the service is just fine but the newness of the place is being wasted. The old folks home across the street explains some of the crowd. But in such a competitive city with the restaurant industry I know my money is better spent elsewhere for the same exact thing.
  Manager doesn&#39;t really give a crap. The waiter mentioned that I mentioned the coleslaw Caesar salad and the manager said apparently that they were waiting for just one more thing. The waiter asked if we were coming back and I said not."

I ordered my burger medium rare, waiter said &#34;Sure, no problem!&#34; I got it extra-extra-well--it was 1/4 char, and not really hot. I understood that by that point the kitchen had switched the fried foods only, and I asked if I should pick something else. He said the grill was probably not off yet since they&#39;d just taken my (lukewarm) burger off the grill, so I asked that it be remade. 

The owner &amp; bartender came back and told my partner that they &#34;can&#39;t cook your lady&#39;s burger medium rare.&#34; I overheard and said, &#34;What about my burger?&#34; He continued to speak to my partner, who had to tell him TWICE that since it was MY burger, he needed to speak to me about it (&#34;well, we can get her burger off the bill or she can eat it.&#34; Hi, right here thanks). He told me it&#39;s &#34;impossible&#34; to cook it any less than they had, because &#34;it&#39;s ground beef&#34; and &#34;we use a char grill.&#34; He offered to take it off the bill, or let me eat it the way it was. 

Ok, clearly you just don&#39;t want to cook me the burger, and I get that the kitchen is closed. But don&#39;t lie to my face and tell me that it was cooked on a char grill when it was cooked on a flat-top, the same as my burned bun--there were no grill marks, it was a nice even coating of burned-to-a-crisp meat. Do not lie to me and say it&#39;s &#34;impossible&#34; to cook ground meat on a char grill without it being SUPER well done (even though it&#39;s a frozen patty, restaurants do it all the time). Do not speak to my partner about it when I&#39;m right there, involved in the conversation about my own food. 

And most importantly: when you screw up a customer&#39;s food, APOLOGIZE."

Hell, who wouldn&#39;t love to have a cozy neighborhood pub/sports bar that serves great food, good grog, has good taste in decor, decent  music, and attracts a clientele who appreciates all of these things. Unfortunately, this joint has a long way to go. They&#39;re not even close.

Let&#39;s start with the food. Ordered the $10 burger and was rewarded with a  half frozen bun, a piece each of limp lettuce and onion, mealy slice of tomato, crappy french fries and tarter sauce from some hospital cafeteria. Also tried the stale chip nachos with out-of-the-can guacomole and salsa.
Waiter asked how everything was and we told him so-so. 
Owner happened to be at the bar and came and attended our table with what seemed to be a chip on his shoulder - &#34;is there a problem? he told me to come over here because there&#39;s a problem&#34;. We broke the news to him to which the owner observed: &#34;I&#39;m not a restaurant, I&#39;m a bar&#34;, and &#34;The cook didn&#39;t show up the last two days so I don&#39;t know what the problem is. People have complained about the nachos, but they&#39;re  fine to me&#34;. 

ummm.. I guess I just don&#39;t get it, and it frankly it comes off as little dishonest. Can they do better? Possibly, but not with this whole attitude thing. And this community can&#39;t be tricked. Do we really need to hear Dodge Ram commercials blaring? 
I would submit that Thirsty Fish dig in and re-evaluate why they&#39;re in business, and focus on deep roots in the community and developing a loyal customer base. Instead they&#39;ve settled for everything that&#39;s wrong in the restaurant business. My suggestion is go the the Loft in Ballard. At least they get it."

At first it has a bit of a sports bar feel to it, but with lower testosterone levels.  But once you settle in it&#39;s fairly comfortable, provided you can handle the volume, sluggish service, and elbow-to-elbow crowds in the main space.

I&#39;ve been told the fish and chips are quite nice for a neighborhood pub, and the jalapeno poppers I snacked on over a couple pints of Firestone Walker IPA were pretty good.  The order of rings my buddy had were reportedly oustanding, and they were certainly plentiful.

As others have noted, the volume in the Thirsty Fish gets inordinately loud.  The place isn&#39;t that big, so I&#39;m not sure why this might be, but we were sitting in the back corner by the shuffleboard table and still had to shout across the table at times.

Combined with infrequent visits by waitstaff, it made for a less than favorable first impression, but I can see where there might be some charm to be found here.  Given that the only other game in this part of the neighborhood is Goofy&#39;s, I would expect the Thirsty Fish to have a pretty good run all things considered."

The food there was okay but it was nice atmosphere and decent drinks with good service.  So when The Thirsty Fish opened, I was hoping for the same or a little better.  What we got was a hostile, odd crowd that would seem more at home at The Baranof.  
My husband and I were hassled upon entering because *gasp* we didn&#39;t plan out our outfits on college game days and had green on while the Dawgs were playing the Ducks.  Now we are both UW fans, season ticket holders for football.  Even the owner/bartender gave us a hard time.  This is not a good first impression.  We should have left then but we decided to watch some of the game and order drinks and an appetizer.  Ordered the onion rings.  They were hot, with little taste.  Not sure how you can do that, but the kitchen managed to make onion rings unappealing.  

If the Thirsty Fish wants a loyal customer base and community roots, try being nicer to all customers who enter.  We won&#39;t be returning."

I waited with great anticipation for the Thirsty Fish to open.  It&#39;s just blocks from my house. I hoped it would be a step up from Goofy&#39;s and the Crown Hill Pub.  And it is.  

You walk in and the atmosphere is quite pleasant now; the owner clearly invested some money to create a nice place.  If you&#39;re a sports lover, they have all the big games playing on their high def TVs.

The problem is the food.   It&#39;s pub grub and I don&#39;t mind that at all.  I am in LOVE with Ballard Loft&#39;s pub grub menu.  But the stuff I had was barely edible.  In fact, we paid, left the chicken wings we ordered on the table and went to another place to get some decent snacks.   They were raw on the inside and had this nasty, greasy, crunchy coating.  Uh, no.  

Hope they can improve the menu a bit, as I&#39;d dearly love to support this local business owner.  Maybe find a partner to handle the kitchen who actually enjoys running the back of the house?"

If you&#39;re a  Seattle foodie, you should adjust your expectations before you go  - the food is standard, decent pub fare.  It&#39;s enjoyable, but don&#39;t expect gourmet artistic creations.

The owner is the nicest guy you will ever meet, who will bend over backwards to make sure your time and money is well spent. His ability to remember your face, your friends, what you eat, and what you drink is uncanny. The food is definitely well above par for a bar(best stuffed jalapenos on the planet), and the crowd is really awesome. He has created a very good community feel to the place that feels more like an invite to his house, rather than a place of business. Which for me is a must in a bar. I hate the cold feeling most have. The only thing I could even remotely consider a con, is that it only has one pool table.  But the one he has is nice, almost always open for a game.

The best part though, is that as a person who doesn&#39;t drink anything alcoholic(10+years without a drink) i don&#39;t feel like some pariah here. Which is something i can&#39;t say of most other bars i have been to in the region."

I want to not just like this place, but LOVE this place since it&#39;s a neighborhood bar and they have NFL ticket.  They need to totally re-think their food.  This is Ballard and we Ballardites can totally hang with pub food, but it&#39;d better be good pub food.  Every single thing we tried VERY clearly came out of the freezer.  Wings, burger, fries, generic-off-the-shelf (not even refrigerator shelf) Ranch dressing...  I hope the owners will rethink their approach to their food- and QUICK.  I&#39;m a small business owner, so I know the trial-and-error and working out the kinks phase, but I&#39;d rather see them working out the kinks on food they make themselves rather than trying to perfect something out of a bag.  If I&#39;m paying you $9 for a cheeseburger, you&#39;d better take some queues from the plethora of good burger places in Ballard and give me something that makes us both proud!

We live in the neighborhood and decided to stop by for dinner and some beers tonight.  The food was delicious, atmosphere was fun and laid back and the service was fab.  They have big HD TVs for the games(s) you want to watch, and best of all, the place was CLEAN.  Huge bar selection, there&#39;s a pool table, shuffle board, Golden Tee, and the music playing rocked but wasn&#39;t too loud.  There seemed to be a good mix of people there, too.  Can&#39;t wait to sit out on the huge patio during the summer.  Definitely check this place out if you&#39;re in the mood for a fun, friendly neighborhood joint!"

We had a burger and onion rings and the fish and chips. Fish was more like the Vandecamps frozen stuff BUT without being overly greasy and horrid. (so they are doing something right with the temperature and type of oil they are using). The burger was great - basic ingredients no nasty tastes or surprises. The onion rings were really good!

Chicken teriyaki wasn&#39;t over-processed like most places

Tempura was standard

Chicken katsu was fresh and crispy - BBQ sauce was great

Side slaws and sesame dressing were perfect together 

Spicy tuna and mango Mochi ice cream were definitely the hit

Parking really isn&#39;t as bad as people make it seem. I&#39;m from out of town and found PLENTY of street parking during peak dinner time

There are a few chairs to sit on if you&#39;re waiting for the rest of your party to arrive. The restaurant is on the smaller side. Interior is that of a casual Japanese restaurant so no need to dress up, unless you&#39;re in the special tatami rooms and then I&#39;d recommend wearing clothing that&#39;s appropriate.

Food: People from Hawaii call it butterfish, but you&#39;ll find it on the menu as &#34;black cod&#34;. The black cod collar they serve here is awesome and a large portion for the price! You can&#39;t buy it and make it cheaper yourself! The chirashi bowl was delicious but on the smaller side. The green tea ice cream deep fried in tempura batter is really good and you can order 1 to split between 2-4 people.

Drinks: Hot tea and water was all we had but the tea was great.

Service: Love the Japanese women working here! Great service :)

Parking: Find free or cheap pay-to-park street parking or lots in the international district and take a short walk to the restaurant. Bring a jacket if it&#39;s raining as you aren&#39;t likely to find parking right in front (unless you&#39;re lucky!)"

And he set like such a high expectation coz I heard this place only took reservations. One time he went in and the restaurant was all empty but they still would not let him in without a reservation. But a lot of people come anyways bcos this place is over 100 years. 

Personally I think it is just okay...  Yah...  The Sukiyaki &amp; tempura combo is pretty good.  The pork cutlet is just like pork katsu I had in most places.  The big mouth roll is really big. Lol.  Like as big as my pawn.  It tastes good though but definitely not the best.  What throws me off though is that they used comic sans for this menu.  Seriously?! And the typefaces use is good messed.  There are prob 5 pages for the menu. They used typeface A for 1st,  2nd,  3rd page, typeface B for the 4th page,  then typeface A for the 5th page.  Lol.  How... 

The service is nice.  Somehow the waiting staff that night are mostly some older Japanese ladies.  But they are kind of adorable.  I told one of them her necklace is nice,  she gave me a super shy smile.  It is cute."

I&#39;m just a girl who is in loooove with Japanese Cuisine and searches near and far for whatever tingles my tastebuds in the greater Seattle area. 

Maneki is this hidden gem sandwiched in a couple other old buildings in what you would call &#34;Little Tokyo&#34; in the International District. When I was first taken to this place, I honestly had no idea what I was getting into. It was all a surprise!

With that said, I&#39;m not going to give you a spiel on the background info. I didn&#39;t get a proper introduction, so why should you?! Just kidding. You already know what is up, if you didn&#39;t... Well, you wouldn&#39;t be doing your research on the interwebs, now would you?! 

Okay, okay, I&#39;ll stop rambling and let you get to the goods:

Sushi/Sashimi - I&#39;ve only ever ordered nigiri here and I&#39;ve been satisfied every single time. The slices of fish are very generous and decent quality! The rice can vary; sometimes it&#39;s spot on! Other days can be off. I really enjoy their maguro, otoro, uni (when they have it), hamachi, tamago and ikura! All great picks!

Hot Foods - The tempura here is the bomb. Batter is always light and crispy. The veggies taste delish! The katsu is also a good portion and is super juicy on the inside! The black cod collar can be spotty; sometimes it&#39;s amazing but other times it&#39;s just decent. The takoyaki might be my favorite hot item to order; it is so cakey and fluffy!

Noodles - I&#39;ve only ever had the Ten Zaru here and it was just okay! Nothing too special but I don&#39;t think that you could mess ever mess up a noodle dish!

Maneki is an oldie but always a goodie (no pun intended). Great prices, good portions, awesome service, kawaii ambience. Solid choice for Japanese food!"

My friends and I happened to be in the area before a M&#39;s game and figured we&#39;d stop by to eat since Yelp said they would be open soon.  The window had a sign saying &#34;Reservations recommended,&#34; but since we were the first ones there, I figured it would be safe.  As soon as the doors open, you are ushered inside to speak with a woman seated at a table.  She asks for your name and for your reservation time.  I shyly shrugged and told her we didn&#39;t make anyway.  We were asked to take a seat so that she could &#34;see what she could do.&#34;  We watched as some patrons were seated (they were clearly smart enough to make reservations) and others were turned away (they wasn&#39;t going to be anything available until 8pm).  Luckily, we barely made the cut and were given a table.  

Moral of the story: MAKE RESERVATIONS. 

I ordered the Sakana Dinner which included your choice of mackerel or salmon?, sashimi, miso soup, cucumber salad, and tempura.  My friends ordered the JoJo (eel) and Spider rolls.  The food was delicious.  The mackerel was salted liberally and the skin was crispy on the edges.  Mackerel tends to be a fishier fish, but I wouldn&#39;t let it deter you if you haven&#39;t tried it yet; a squirt of lemon juice and it&#39;s perfect.  The other dishes were clean and simple; the sashimi was fresh and the rolls were filling.   

Service was great too.  Quick and efficient.  

I&#39;d definitely go back.  But next time, I&#39;ll be smart enough to call for a table beforehand."

We walk in and the host tells us the only available seating is at the bar, although there were open tables in the restaurant.. But we didn&#39;t mind sitting at the bar. Didn&#39;t question it. 

The bartender is friendly and knowledgable. She&#39;s attentive to everyone sitting there and is there to answer questions or ask you how you like the food. 

I ordered the chirashi (sp?) bowl $26 which comes with 17 pieces of sashimi with yummy white rice at the bottom and some cucumber and yellow radish slices in a sweet miso sauce (?). My dad ordered 8 pieces of sashimi each order comes with two pieces and is around $6-8 I believe. 

The sashimi is so fresh and buttery every bit was delicious. They don&#39;t give you too much rice with the sashimi pieces as well which is great because I feel that shows they don&#39;t need more rice to make the nigiri dish feel &#34;better&#34; if that makes sense? The sashimi alone best! 

In the restaurant they also have seating that I think is the more traditional way, with low tables where you take off your shoes and sit on mats and the rooms have sliding doors. 

Great quality fish, good service, glad we came here on our weekend trip to Seattle! Parking is also much easier to find since it&#39;s not in the main area of the city."

We were quickly greeted by two friendly Japanese grandma-sans when we walked in-- one who opened the door and seated us, and another who took our reservation. (Reservations only because place fills up quick, even on a Thursday night. Otherwise, you can sit at the bar, but it&#39;s not the typical sushi bar where you order sushi but an actual bar where you order drinks. The sushi bar is located at the back but its not available for sit down.)

Everything we ordered was super fresh. The Ankimo wasn&#39;t drenched with soy sauce or ponzu but mixed with fresh cucumbers and daikons. The Takoyaki and fried chicken were lightly battered and not oily. The eel rice and black cod were warm and sweet, and they definitely hit the spot in the end. 

Overall:
Unpretentious and traditional. 
Reasonably priced - $88.50 for 10 items.

I was pretty excited for this place given its fame and the fact that its hard to just casually walk in without a reservation. 

On an early Saturday evening, I was running errands around the International District and suddenly had a craving for sushi. Maneki wasn&#39;t far away so I decided to give it a shot. I walked in and asked for a table for 2 but the hostess said the next available seating would be 9:30. I was going to leave and eat laotian food instead but the hostess said if I waited a few minutes, there might be a table available due to no shows. Just my luck, 5 minutes later, the hostess said there was a table for me. What was weird though was that the restaurant wasn&#39;t even completely full when I sat down. About 4 - 8 people came in and out during the time I dined there and even when I left there were definitely a good number of empty tables. I&#39;m not sure why the hostess would tell people that the next seating would be at 9:30 when there&#39;s all these open tables... But anywho, on to the food.

We shared the oden dinner set, geoduck batayaki, toro nigiri and ankimo appetizer.

The geoduck batayaki was a bit mediocre. It was lightly buttered and was mostly comprised of mushrooms. After trying this I realized I prefer raw geoduck. 

The toro nigiri did not impress. At the first bite it tastes fatty but the next moment it all breaks apart and you realize it was cheap fish. 

The ankimo was my least favorite out of all, it tasted a bit briny and foul? 

The oden set was a better bang for buck, it comes with 4 pieces of nigiri, 3 cooked courses and miso soup with a bowl of rice. 

The cooked dishes were better than their sushi (the nigiri that comes with the oden set was low grade fish). 

The miso soup tasted homemade so there&#39;s that.

Overall, I find this place to be a little overhyped. If you do plan to come here, I can only recommend sticking to the cooked dishes. Their sushi is a total miss."
maneki-seattle,Stan Y.,x57m855RO4Ev5l0H3YZWQQ,"Issaquah, WA",1,1,0,326,170,uLJuwiDLmXzxYAvzclILSA,3.0,2016-04-05,"The place is OK. But comparing to its reputation, I have to say that I&#39;m disappointed.

Maneki sure is popular. By 5:30PM its open time, there is already more than 20 people waiting outside the door. It does not guarantee that you can get a table though, even when you arrive early. A family in front of us had to wait for another two hours because they didn&#39;t make reservation.

Fortunately, we had a reservation for us group of six in one of the tatami rooms. With the tatami and the Japanese decoration around the room, the environment is very authentic. The service is pretty good. Our waitress was always smile and attentive.

Of course, what matters the most is the food. I&#39;m sorting the dishes we ordered into three categories: Satisfied, It&#39;s OK and Disappointed.

Satisfied:

Black code collar. It&#39;s one of the signature dish of the restaurant and it sure lived up to its reputation. The fish is fresh and skillfully grilled. It&#39;s tender, smoky and salty but not overpowering the original flavor at all. Very well executed. It&#39;s the must-have dish if you visit Maneki. A little pricey though, $9.5 for three pieces of cod collars.

Salmon combo and chicken teriyaki combo. First of all, the portion is pretty big comparing with other dishes. Big piece of grilled salmon and lots of tender juicy chicken. The flavor is a little plain though.

It&#39;s OK:

Chicken kabab, eggplant and tako-yaki. The chicken kabab is a little dry, the eggplant appetizer is nothing outstanding, and so is tako-yaki. A little overpriced as well. But considering they&#39;re hard to find at other Japanese restaurants in Seattle, I&#39;d rating those dishes as it&#39;s OK.

Disappointed: 

Monk fish liver appetizer. The flavor is OK but the portion is so small. Half of the plant was filled with pickled cucumber and radish. There are only three thin tiny slices of monk fish liver in the plate. Not worth the money.

Chirashi and Unagi Don. The portion is so small that why the waitress delivers the food, we joked about it being kid&#39;s meal. For a $26 chirashi, that is a very small bowl, and again lots of pickled cucumber in the bowl. Same thing for the unagi don. The eel is fresh and nicely grilled, seasoned. But the portion is definitely not matching the price.

In general, we&#39;re kind of disappointed with Maneki. For its reputation, we expected better experience and definitely larger portion.

With Maneki&#39;s reputation, we definitely expected an extraordinary experience from service to food. Unfortunately, we&#39;re not impressed."

Calling for reservations is recommended since a majority of the people that comes in already had RSVP&#39;ed, unless you don&#39;t mind eating past 9:30pm for walk ins (depending on how busy they are). Luckily, one of my good friends who lives in Seattle, RSVP a table for us 2 weeks in advance. Make sure you&#39;re on time or else they&#39;ll for sure give your table away. Now onto the food:

You can never go wrong with your order. The black cod miso was delicious. Definitely my number one pick. Their salmon is definitely organically raised. You can tell by the color, it&#39;s red AF!!! At first I thought it was tuna, but it was def salmon. I got a couple of rolls that were equally delicious and picked off of other people&#39;s food. For none sushi lovers, they have chicken teriyaki that was surprisingly BOMB!! Like I said, whatever you order, it&#39;ll most likely be good.

If you&#39;re in Seattle, highly recommend checking this place out."
maneki-seattle,Henry W.,wEqETrWwpsujK2r8ZueOFw,"San Francisco, CA",1,1,0,674,375,1kQg8_YCqG9pTG1HC1MMUw,2.0,2016-08-21,"For a restaurant that&#39;s supposed to be known for it&#39;s sushi, I was absolutely shocked at how horrible it was. It&#39;s similar to the phenomenon where Japanese tourists visiting Paris for the first time have to be admitted to a hospital due to the shock of how dirty and un-dreamy Paris really is. (this is a real thing, look it up) 

Are most of the people dining here and leaving rave reviews about the sushi just deluded? Or is it me? I mean, I have had great sushi in Tokyo, Asia, and many other sushi hotspots in the world.. but I guess there is a tiny, infinitesimal chance that the sushi in Tokyo is nasty and the sushi at Maneki is awesome.. but I doubt it. 

Uni - two huge pale yellow pieces of sea urchin.. I thought they were pretty generous with the portions, which is usually a bad sign considering how cheap it was. Also the pale yellow sea urchin is usually not as good as the golden ones. My intuition was correct, as the uni tasted very bitter, overly briney, and a little sour. Only seasoned uni eaters would have been able to swallow these. I pity anyone who thinks this is how uni should taste. Good uni should be not fishy at all, have a nice creamy mouthfeel, be slightly sweet and slightly briney. 

Wild Salmon - these rubbery pieces of mystery meat were the most interesting (in a bad way) salmon nigiri I&#39;ve ever had. They were dry, very red, and lacking any fat. I&#39;d say they almost tasted like a dry piece of tuna that had been left out for 16 hrs in the fridge. My girlfriend who loves salmon, had to spit hers out in a napkin since it was so atrocious. 

Unagi Don - 4 average sized pieces of unagi over a bed of rice for $18. Yeah.. maybe if the unagi was the best unagi in the west coast? Not even close.. the eel here was kind of spongey and barely had any of the eel sauce. There is so much rice in the bowl that we barely ate 1/4 of it with the unagi. It&#39;s a shame since unagi is one of my favorite things to eat. Complete fail.

Salmon skin roll - They used way too much sugar in the sauce and in the salmon skin marinade, to the point where it tasted like a dessert almost. Also I couldn&#39;t taste any of the pickled burdock root, which would have been a nice touch. This was also a miss for me, and I absolutely love salmon skin. 

The only saving grace here was the miso black cod collar, which was pretty good, but in my opinion as good as any miso cod at any standard Japanese restaurant. 

Also, just to make things worse, I extremely dislike any restaurant that is always busy, seems to live on hype alone, and doesn&#39;t deliver on most or any of the items on the menu. Maneki fits that profile for me.. I would have totally given them one star if it wasn&#39;t for the black cod.."

The menu here is simple and not too complicated with just enough of a variety to keep everyone satisfied. I ordered the chicken bento which was a good size portion with three side items. The chicken was fresh and tasty with a good teriyaki sauce. The three side items consisted of a cabbage salad, a cucumber salad and tempura. All three were very good and nicely complimented the meal. The meal also came with a nice size bowl of miso soup and rice plus four pieces of California roll. Since I am not a fan of eating raw fish, the restaurant was nice enough to replace the original rolls on the menu in exchange for the California rolls.

We had also ordered three appetizers which were the large squid, chicken wings and takoyaki. The appetizers were more hit and miss as they were the least tasty. The takoyaki was probably the best out of the three, but the wings were over cooked and didn&#39;t have much flavor. The squid was just grilled nicely, but again missing any kind of seasoning.

Service here was great as we were well attended to throughout the meal and they even cleared out all the dishes quickly after we finished our meal. The pricing of the menu items were on point and were not overly expensive as some Japanese restaurants can be.

I was glad to come here again to sit tatami style which doesn&#39;t happen very often and enjoy a good fulfilling meal."

However, they do not offer omakase. You&#39;re going to have to order everything off the menu. With that being said, the quality of fish is top notch and the portions are sizable. Two note-worthy things. First off they have you two full &#34;tongues&#34; of uni in each gunkan sushi. It&#39;s pretty big so you&#39;re going to have to strategize how you&#39;ll eat it. Second, what blew me away most was the spider roll. Maneki&#39;s spider roll is hands down the best spider roll I&#39;ve ever had. The soft-shell crab is HUGE making the roll HUGE. More importantly, the crab is still crunchy when you bite into it! Highly recommend stopping what you&#39;re doing when it comes out and take a bite before the texture and crunch starts to go bad. 

Tip: their daily special selection of fish is posted bulletin-style on the wall to your right as you walk into main dining area. Also, their nigiri orders is 2 piece per order so come with a friend so you split each order and experience a wide variety"

Fresh sushi, great cuts.  What more can you ask for.

The place isnt pack or noisy, they really emphasize on keeping a nice ambiance where everyone can enjoy their meals.  They even have private rooms for larger parties in the Tatami room.  But let&#39;s get down to the food.

One of the must try dis there is the Black Cod, the flavor and juiciness of this dish leaves you craving for more.  I also enjoy the Tempura soft shell crab..  I also feel that their Nigiri pieces are a little more generous than other places.  They do have daily/weekly specials that they post on the wall, so you will have to look.  Cant go wrong with Wild Salmon, uni, any toro, and scallops nigiri.

Dont take my word for it, go and try it yourself.

Also this place is by reservation only, so you will have to call and leave your info.  Or if you&#39;re 21+, then you can try a seat at the small bar section."

This is a go-to place to good Japanese food. Every time I have visitors in Seattle, I make reservations at Maneki (I would highly suggest making reservations at least a few days in advance- a week if for a weekend day). Their phone number is stored in my phone to text reservations. They book up quickly and if you try to go without reservations, you&#39;ll likely have to wait until after 9:00pm for a table. 

We always order the black cod collar miso and some sushi. Last time, we ordered yellow tail nigiri, cucumber salad, black cod collar miso, salmon in foil pouch, garlic tempura (so good. not too garlicky), gyoza, spicy cod karaage, and susan&#39;s avocado delight. Everything tastes so fresh, and they bring out everything as it&#39;s ready. I never dislike anything I try at Maneki. Great place for sharing food with your group. 

Prices are excellent f, service is fast and attentive. If you want to add something to your order, someone will always be around. Your table is always clear of empty plates and the servers even sometimes give you a new clean plate halfway through your meal. 

I love this place and wish I lived closer!"

I had the black cod collar and the vegetable tempura. Clean, good food. I wish I had come back here again to be honest but it&#39;ll just have to wait until next time I visit the area. I could probably eat buckets of the black cod collar but I should try more of what they have haha."

The atmosphere is cozy and the service is super friendly. The sushi rolls were pretty cheap, with a good amount of fish and very fresh. The chirashi was super fresh and the sushi rice was perfectly chewy, sweet and salty.

We made reservations, as was recommended. And got a table pretty quickly. There were only two of us so I&#39;m sure that didn&#39;t hurt either. The menu has a lot of variety and we were having trouble deciding what to get. We ended up deciding to get two appetizer-type dishes and a bunch of sushi

We got:

The Tataki 
The Black Cod Collar (since so many people on yelp recommended it)
Spicy Tuna Roll
Yellow Tail Nigri
Wild Salmon Nigri
Octopus Nigri
Salmon Egg Nigri
Scallop Nigri
Pickled Mackerel Nigri
Eel Nigri

For dessert we got the fried green tea ice cream.

None of the food disappointed me at all. The tataki didn&#39;t have too much flavor but was very fresh tasting and a good dish to start with. The black cod collar was delicious as everyone said. It had sort of a smoked fish kind of a flavor and there was plenty of creamy fish meat on those bones. The spicy tuna roll was the best spicy tuna roll I&#39;ve ever had by far! It had much more flavor and was a lot spicier than the usual spicy tuna roll I get at any other restaurant. It was so good. 

The Nigri selection worked out really well for our anniversary dinner because each selection comes with two pieces. So we tried each piece at the same time. Which was a simple, but great way to make the meal really fun. All the pieces were delicious. I loved every bite. The octopus was pretty rubbery, but that&#39;s to be expected from fresh octopus. The pickled mackerel was soo good and soo mackerely so if you like the taste of mackerel (which I do) you&#39;ll love that one. The scallop was sweet and buttery. The wild salmon and yellowtail was yummy as expected. The eel was really meaty and to me sort of had a chicken kind of flavor (though my wife disagreed). The salmon eggs were fun to eat as the balls burst fish oil in your mouth, slightly fishy and salty, sort of like mild caviar. It was great.  

The Green Tea Ice cream was really good I thought. The batter was really sweet though and sort of overpowered the flavor of the ice cream, but I didn&#39;t mind that. 

The service is really friendly and awesome. They got us a table fast (because of the reservation). They were very attentive to my water and were constantly refilling it (I drink a lot of water). the dishes came out about as quickly as I could have expected and were spaced out really nicely. They were also very good at taking our dirty plates when we were done, although some of our plates still had pieces of ginger on it that I had my eye on. 

The ambience is really nice. It&#39;s a quiet homey kind of place. Very relaxing. Someday I want to try going into one of the tatami rooms. 

We had a great experience at Maneki and want to go back sometime and try more of their selections. I definitely recommend it."

The fiance is more of a meatitarian, so I kept putting it off. That and I can&#39;t just make a reservation on Open Table, I actually have to call or text. Finally, some friends moved to town and asked if we wanted to join them there. The stars aligned and we were able to get a reservation the following day in a Tatami Room! 

We ordered SO. MUCH. FOOD. 

We were a few minutes early so we stopped into Momo before going to Maneki, and she told us to make sure we ordered our sushi first. I probably should have asked why, but I just went with it. We ordered the spider roll - if you like delicious things you absolutely need this, and something that I think was called a Jo Jo Roll - if you like eel, it was delightful! The friends got another roll that was pretty good, I think it was Yellowtail?

The fiance said &#34;just order whatever you want and make sure I&#39;m full.&#34; He lived to regret that. I ordered beef teriyaki (everyone ate it before I could even try, so it must have been good), which came with tempura veg, rice and miso soup. Then I ordered edamame, black cod collar (way better than I could have imagined, but hard to eat with chopsticks), ankimo (the pate of the sea!). Then the friends ordered even more. We were so full and happy by the end, we could barely drag ourselves out. And to top it all off, we had such a great time without any alcohol! They do have a full bar, but we were fine with the tea. 

The prices seem fair and pretty low considering the outstanding quality of everything we had. I think our experience was so awesome because we had a Tatami room, so you should totally try to snag one on your next visit."

The tenant (who states he was well versed in sushi) told me that this was by far one of the best he has ever had. With that being said, I had to go see if this was true and..... it was good but i wouldn&#39;t say the best that i&#39;d had.

The restaurant is open later in the afternoon 530-1030pm I believe but reservations for the business fill up very quickly so call a few hours before they open, leave a message requesting the # of people and time. Apparently this restaurant has been around for about 100 years and is one of the oldest establishments in Seattle. No kidding with the amount of people that were inside. Everyone&#39;s parents, grandparents and great grandparents must have been suggesting this place throughout the years. Bar is opening seating and I got lucky with a single seat in a busy bar area that was slightly behind the sake machine. 

Service: Good, the bartender was diligent in walking back and forth from the kitchen to see if the food was ready and with updates on the food periodically. The hostess, an older japanese lady and her colleague, was incredibly hilarious as I spoke to them about the craziness of Las Vegas while coming back from the bathroom 

Food: The bento box I got was prepared wonderfully. Chicken was very soft and not overly sauced while contrasted by a light salad with mayo sauce. The cucumber salad was ok and garnished with that really cheap tiny shrimp that I am not fond of. The sushi cuts were great. The hamachi was a deep pink, fresh and the salmon was buttery. The blue fin tuna was slightly on the fishy end but the consistency was good.

Overall: I can&#39;t say this is the best sushi i&#39;ve had but definitely very good"

Make a reservation because this place gets crowded, fast.

The miso black cod is a must. It melts in your mouth and is packed with flavor.

I highly recommend the sassy salmon and spicy tuna rolls as well. They both have great spice. The spider roll is another great choice. 

My favorite nigiris are the albacore and sweet shrimp, the fish is extremely fresh and the rice is cooked perfectly. The rice also has a hint of sweetness, which is really pleasant.

In terms of appetizers, I would also recommend the fried oysters and agadeshi tofu!"

Authentic Japanese cuisine. Great prices AND genuine and attentive service

SUPER FRESH fish - Everything we got here was amazing. 

Hamachi Kama ($9.50, not on menu) - Perrrrrfectly cooked.

Uni, hamachi, or wild salmon nigiri (~$5.50) - everything was so fresh and flavorful. The boyfriend and I were saying &#34;mMMmmmm!!!&#34; So much that I think the table next to us copied some of our dishes.

Cute, cheap, and delicious! Some say you can&#39;t have it  all, but this place defies that notion.

Even before they opened at 5:30 pm there was a line outside. They won&#39;t seat you until your entire party is there. 

Ordered spicy tuna sushi ($5.50): overall pretty good, no complaints. For the price, it was worth it! It&#39;s basically what you&#39;d expect, except the spicy tuna does have a kick to it which was more that I was expecting. 

Also got the beef sukiyaki, was craving something soupy and hot since it was a cold day. It comes in a wide cast iron flat skillet. Overall good flavor and texture, it actually is a lot of food (looks can be deceiving!) I barely ended up finishing it!

Service: very attentive but sometimes I felt like the waitress was too overbearing, wasn&#39;t sure if she was just trying to shoo us out to make room for new customers. 

Tips: DEFINITELY make reservations or you won&#39;t stand a chance to get a seat. Even people who made reservations for a later time came early to see if they could get seated earlier and they were turned away. Next time, I&#39;ll probably make a reservation for the tatami rooms!"

And the answer is probably nothing... Haha but I&#39;ll detail my amazing experience anyways, as this place is probably my new favorite sushi place in Seattle. Make sure you get a reservation in advanced (they text so it&#39;s pretty easy to find a time), as we went at 7pm on a Sunday night and they weren&#39;t taking walk-ins until 9:30pm. Crazy!!!

Dish 1:
ANKIMO. (Monk fish liver) $7.75 This is always one of my favorite thing to order at nice sushi places. (While sometimes all you need is a cheap sushi fix, this is not one of those dishes you can get at your run of the mill sushi stop). Buttery, melt is your mouth, fantastic. It&#39;s the pate of the sea, and anyone who has not had it absolutely must give it a try.

Dish 2: 
TAKO YAKI- fried Octopus balls, mostly ordered because my boyfriend likes these. (Also at a place where sushi is not cheap, he has to order something filling!) There are 7 on the plate for $4.50 I believe? Don&#39;t regret ordering it, although personally thought they could be a tad crispier. 

Dish 3: 
MISO COD COLLAR- wow. Definitely their star dish. As countless Yelpers have said in the past, this is the most worth it dish on the menu. $10 for 4 collars. So tasty, not sure there&#39;s much to say. Miso cod is a classic, and for this price it&#39;s usually one small piece that we fight for the last scraps of. This is not the case here.

Dish 4:
CHIRASHI- at $26, definitely the priciest of the dishes, but arguably worth it. They menu says 17 pieces of fish, but we were too busy savoring it to count haha). Why so expensive? Probably the amazing quality fish they use- and the fact that they give you 2 pieces of toro, which is like 50% of the cost of the bowl.... Worth it in my mind. So fatty, melt in your mouth amazing, then it&#39;s gone :( also, scallops, and overall fresh fish. We were at first taken aback by the size of the bowl (just a regular small rice bowl size) but do not be fooled! It&#39;s actually nice because they stuff a bunch of the fish on top and the ratio of fish to rice is perfect, not like other places where I count the chirashi is a &#34;filler&#34; dish, with mostly white rice topped with some fish. 

Overall, at $30/person after tax and tip for a quality Japanese food experience, totally worth it and I will return."

Ordered the Sakana Dinner which comes with sunomono (pickled cucumber), rice, miso soup, salt broiled salmon (or mackerel), sashimi, tempura, and a piece of fruit. I was very very pleasantly surprised by the food. The salt broiled salmon was prepared and salted perfectly, with a perfect crisp to the skin (refer to my pic if you want to drool). Additionally, I was blown away by their sashimi. It was so buttery, it was like I put a cube of butter in my mouth and it literally melted. I&#39;ve never had a slice of sashimi like this before.

My friends both ordered the chirashi bowl, which is something Maneki is really known for. Of course, the sashimi was delicious, but the bowl itself was not a very large serving of food. My friend had to order sides of nigiri to fill up after her chirashi bowl. We also ordered agedashi tofu, ankimo, and the spicy cod karaage. Agedashi tofu was pretty standard, nothing memorable. Pass on the spicy cod karaage, it was not spicy, and dry- I think I&#39;d have preferred chicken over cod. The ankimo was pretty good. Nice, rich, creamy flavors of the ankimo paired with the refreshing daikon and a salty/sweet ponzu sauce.

The sashimi was 5 stars. Everything else was 3-4 stars."

The food here is spectacular. Yelpers  suggested getting the black cod collar and that was just okay. The whole roasted mackerel was ~fantastic~, as well as the tempura garlic (surprisingly!) Beef sukiyaki is another must get if you&#39;ve never tried it before, and the tekka don is a great shareable tuna dish.

Their chirashi (a variety of sashimi over sushi rice) was decent! The cuts of fish were like little jewels and the rice was perfect! My memory is a little foggy at this point, but I think I paid around $20 for the chirashi bowl. The ambience reminded me of an old-timey Japanese restaurant in Hawaii, a little run-down, but definitely cozy!

The food is just so excellent in flavor, quality, preparation and appearance. And as far as I can tell, their menu and presentation is authentic and traditional and avoids things that are trendy or flashy. It&#39;s no-frills yet exquisitely cared-for at the same time. 

The same can be said about the service (always warm and professional, never snobby nor cloying) and the decor (a bit cluttered but in a manner suggesting that you can be comfortable here and enjoy yourself). And there are little waving kitties (Maneki-neko) everywhere! 

I went to Maneki last night with my GF, feeling lucky to have a reservation on a Friday night (saw lots of people turned away because they were booked solid). We shared (1) a salad with tuna, yellowtail, avocado, flying fish roe, greens and a light soy/citrus dressing; (2) the black cod collars; and (3) a bowl of kinpira. Everything was just perfect. The black cod collars are one of my most favorite dishes in Seattle and I think they&#39;re even better than the sablefish sake kasu at Ray&#39;s (that&#39;s hiiiiigh praise from me). And I can&#39;t recommend the kinpira highly enough. It&#39;s main ingredient is burdock root...I wouldn&#39;t know a burdock root if it knocked on my front door, but goodness is that stuff delicious.

We ordered different sushi, tuna roll, black cod collar, agedashi tofu. The sushi was really fresh and pretty decent sized. We enjoyed all the food. 

The hostess was a very sweet lady, she came over to our table and gave us a sample of the lemon shochu shot. She also showed us how to eat the black cod correctly.  At the end of dinner she gave us a few recommendations of where to eat around town since we were visiting. We enjoyed our visit and plan on coming back here again!"

My very first encounter with her occurred on a Tuesday evening around 6:30pm and is as follows:

Me: (enters the front door and sees an apparently pleasant looking elderly Japanese woman sitting there) &#34;Hi, party of 4.&#34;
BOL: (in a bitchy voice) &#34;Reservation?!&#34;
Me: (surprised at her initial response) &#34;Oh, I didn&#39;t make a reservation...&#34;
BOL: &#34;COME BACK 9:30pm!&#34;

Either BOL has been in the U.S. for too long or her granny panties were tied up in a bunch---probably a little bit of both---but at least the other waitresses and servers were friendly.  The place definitely has a positive vibe with the exception of BOL: the waitresses speak Japanese to you when you speak to them in Japanese, and there are Japanese-style tatami rooms inside.  The food here can be divided into two categories: 1) the typical sushi, which is not THAT typical because they have uni (sea urchin) here AND 2) the homestyle dishes.  I love the latter here because all the dishes in said category is SO good.  One of my faves is the miso black cod!

This place would have gotten a 5 if not but for the BOL.  One star knocked off.  In Japan, the greeters greet you with a bow and a courteous &#34;irashaimase.&#34;  I know this is not Japan, but as the oldest Japanese restaurant in Seattle you would think Maneki would seem as legit manners/etiquette-wise as the places in the Land of the Rising Sun.  Just sayin."

Every time I try to make a reservation here they don&#39;t have anything available until 9p. So the one night I got a reservation at 8:30p, I had to take it. 

I walked in super excited! All I&#39;ve heard about are the black cod collars. So of course that was one of the items I ordered.

Order:
Octopus sunomono 
Shiro-maguro tataki
Black cod collar miso
Ten-zaru soba noodles
Sassy salmon roll

The octopus sunomono was fine. Nothing special.

The albacore tataki was good. 

The black cod collar was as amazing as all the other reviews say it was

The soba noodles I really liked and considering I don&#39;t like cold noodles, I think that&#39;s saying a lot. 

The sassy salmon roll was the most disappointing I think. First of all, if it says 5 stars hot, then I of all people should be in tears. I don&#39;t eat very much spicy food and considering I could eat a piece without tearing or breathing heavily, it is not five stars hot. I didn&#39;t eat another piece, but from the taste of the first piece, it wasn&#39;t that great flavor-wise. 

I think everything flavor-wise was just ok. The fish/octopus wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. It is definitely not Shiro&#39;s quality. But I shouldn&#39;t be comparing this restaurant to Shiros. 

Service was great. 
Interior was cute. 
Wish I had seen the handwritten specials before I ordered off the menu."

Simplistic dishes and fresh fish. Came here for a birthday with friends. ** please be sure to make reservations in advanced, they get booked up quick**
1) Sautéed squid with butter and garlic - tasty and enjoyable
2) Clams in sake broth - not my favorite as the broth is literally boiled sake, no other flavors involved
3) Broiled oysters in basically a mayo sauce - obviously deliciously fatty :
4) Tekka don (tuna chirashi) is better cost wise than getting nigiri . Husband really enjoyed it
5) Beef sukiyaki - contains beef, udon, vermicelli, cabbage, and tofu in a sweetened soy sauce broth. It is tasty. Probably even better with rice!

Very enjoyable dinner. Will try to book a Tatami room next time :)"

Really sweet old lady, and I kept hearing the servers calling her that. She was really sweet, but the service was a bit slow. Which dragged our dinner out.

We ordered the black cod collar, avocado ponzu salad, tempura, and nigiri. Highlight was the black cod collar; it wasn&#39;t overwhelmed by the saltiness of the soy sauce and it definitely smelled wonderful with the miso. The tempura and deep fried green tea with poppy seed cake batter were too oily and greasy for me. Although I enjoyed the light batter and crunchy poppy seeds in the deep fried ice cream, I didn&#39;t like the oil residue clinging on my lips. Nigiri and salad were pretty good as well. 

It&#39;s a good homestyle Japanese restaurant, but food was a little too oily for me."

Their fish is SO incredibly delicious and fresh and just plain buttery.  Who doesn&#39;t love sushi like that?! I got the chirashi bowl and was thoroughly satisfied. I had some other plain sushi rolls (nothing fancy - this place is pretty traditionally Japanese) and again, was really really impressed with their fish quality.  

I love this place and am dying to go back when I visit Seattle again.  There&#39;s ALWAYS a wait BEFORE the place opens. Yup. That&#39;s how good and renown it is.  So make a reservation ahead of time!  Service is wonderful as the place is small and home-y (as so many others said).

Menu is extensive. Most people go for sushi, but there are a lot of other Japanese dishes that are great and should be tried. Chirashi bowl is delicious, sometimes comes with blue fin tuna which is a great deal!

Non sushi items:
- Seaweed salad is great appetizer
- Agadeshi tofu is always a crowd pleaser
- Onigiri: comfort food, big round ball of rice with filling such as bonito, a bit too much rice for me but still tasty, comes grilled too
- Foil wrapped fish: gives it a great, baked flavor
- Eggplant in miso: a bit salty but delicious nonetheless!

On a 1 to 5 scale,
Service: 4
Interior Design: 4
Food: 5

So I have noticed that a lot of the people are complaining about not being served well. If you pay extra attention to those post, then you probably will notice that they did not make reservation prior the visit. And that will sure lead to a big problem because all you have to do is make reservation through text and then they will pretty much respond in a very short time. 

I have been there twice now, and upon making reservation, you can also double check with their inventory. For instance, my girl friend and I were craving for uni (sea urchin), and since they were out of uni on our first visit, I specifically request for the availability before making my second visit. 

The foods are very well-served, I would recommend at least one entree follow up with sushis or nigiris. Remember that Japanese food is about quality and not size/portion."

This place is a great find in the ID. FYI when you call no one will answer and you need to leave a message with desired time and party size. They will text you back the time available and to confirm the reservation. It&#39;s confusing but DO leave a message and someone will get back to you. And you NEED to make a reservation. It&#39;s always full. 

We had the sea weed salad, the eel roll, smoked salmon row, the cod collar and Amber jack sashimi. The Amber jack was outstanding. It&#39;s like a wild yellow tail. It had some texture to it and was a little sweet. So good! The cod collar was recommended to me and was outstanding it was flavorful, buttery and soft (this is 3 pieces of cooked fish). It melted in your mouth. The smoked salmon was delicious but it is really a smoked, salty roll so you have to be in the mood for that. The eel was great as well. All recommended!

There was a snail app special that was... an acquired taste. The snails were swimming in a clear broth that was very pungent in smell and flavor. I wish I could describe it other then, the whole thing tasted really, really...&#34;snail like&#34;. I&#39;ve had snails half a dozen times and I&#39;m not the biggest fan, but I will eat it if someone orders it. I will never eat this version again in this lifetime. 

The salmon in a foil pack, was odd. It was drowning in mayo, onions and the liquid from the steaming process. All I tasted was mayo and onions. I love salmon; Seattle has the best and freshest Salmon varieties in the lower 48. Skip this...unless, you like mayo and onions with a hint of salmon. 

Collar. The first time I had it was one of those life moments where you go, &#34;how have I never had this&#34; ? The black cod is God (skip the salmon and get two of the black cod, minimum) It&#39;s the Lebron of Cod and I&#39;m not a cod fan (or &#39;Bron for that matter). The miso seasoning on the meat from the cheeks combined with the char from grilling it is a game changer. I&#39;d come back and get 3 orders of this and call it a night. I don&#39;t share this dish and tell people upfront, get your own. 

&#34;It&#39;s the best Sushi in Seattle&#34;, she said. &#34;It&#39;s the best, I&#39;ve ever had&#34;, he said. &#34;It&#39;s sooo good&#34;, they said in harmony. What&#39;s more annoying then that last phrase? 

Really? I mean, not to be a NYC douche, but come on...I can get this kind of fish quality in NYC, in just about every hood. It&#39;s good fish, but not great. Living in the food capital of the world is a blessing and a curse; mostly, it&#39;s a curse. 

Sushi quality is no longer exclusive to an area of the universe. It goes back to my long standing point: fish or any ingredient from anywhere in the world can be shipped in 24 hours; proximity to a body of water doesn&#39;t make sushi better, anymore. What does is the technique and consistency married in harmony with the fresh ingredients you have been given. The sushi chef here is not on par with top flight sushi chefs even though his ingredients may have been caught today. Salmon caught in the river from your back yard slapped on some rice doesn&#39;t make it great. There was something missing here and that thing is great technique to elevate the ingredient from good to spectacular. Other then the Salmon sashimi, which considering it&#39;s Seattle and almost impossible to screw that up, the overall sushi experience here is middle of the road. 

Overall, you are getting a great price for the quality of both food and service. The second best thing about this joint is the story. It is old and family run. In the big scheme of things, you&#39;re supporting a generation of people and the friends they employ who&#39;s life is this spot. I love that and is half the reason why I have been back twice; the other reason is that collar!"

The reservation as fairly easy to make (called and didn&#39;t answer and texted me right back..but alright). Once we were seated (party of 3) we waited 15 minutes before we had anyone bring us anything to drink. Finally someone noticed we were just sitting there with our menus closed and offered us tea. No water though. It was impossible to find a waitress. We waited another 10-15 minutes before a waitress, a bit on the heavy side, black hair tied up, rudely took our order. She was not friendly nor was she helpful. 

So I ordered the chicken teriyaki and tempura combo (only 4 pieces, I&#39;ve had better for less money), another had the eel roll and another ordered chirashi. My food came out first which is always awkward because I feel like I should wait but I was so hungry. It was very salty and watery for teriyaki and the chicken tasted old and a bit dry. 

10 minutes go by and my friends eel roll comes out. She said this was just alright. And here&#39;s the best part! The chirashi doesn&#39;t come out for another 45 minutes since we ordered. 45!!! I have never in my life seen such horrible service. We had to track down a waitress and ask where her food was and she brought it out 2 seconds later. Was it just sitting in the counter? They obviously forgot. No apologies. Nothing. By the time her food got to the table my friend and I were done. No one wants that. You don&#39;t go out of your way to  china town to eat separately with friends. You go to eat together. 

Lastly the a waitress comes by &#34;looks like you need a box&#34; in a really rude tone, the only words she uttered to us all night. 

I&#39;m being critical for extremely bad service and mediocre food. I&#39;m Japanese and this was not an authentic Japanese experience. I saw other people around us have the same issue as us. Whoever is managing this place needs a huge wake up call because you cannot treat any of your customers like this. 

I will not be coming back and I have told multiple friends about this bad experience. Don&#39;t recommend it!!"

The food is GREAT! Chose the simplest of items (spicy tuna, spicy salmon, edamame, green tea) and enjoyed every single thing.  Next time I&#39;ll be more adventurous!

What&#39;s more is the family team here has some real history that you can&#39;t help but appreciate. Maneki has been around for over 100 years, and they have followers to prove it.  In fact, one person stopped me as I was waiting to be seated and shared his story of coming to Maneki for 50 years now. &#34;You&#39;re in for a real treat&#34;, he said.  And he wasn&#39;t kidding!  The ladies here are truly the sweetest I&#39;ve come across at any restaurant, and most patient considering they have to repeat probably 30 times a night that they can&#39;t take walk-ins for hours because of the demand. 

Though a reservation is good to have, don&#39;t consider this an upscale place where you should be dressed up. Instead, Maneki offers a casual dining environment that makes you feel at home."

i chose maneki cause of them being around for 100 years and figured Seattle and sashimi has to be a good combination and it was, just melt in your mouth, but still nothing like Japan.

the review would&#39;ve been at least 4 stars if the black cod collar was served hot of the yakitori grill or broiler. only conclusion its a popular item and they must have them ready and sitting before serving. great miso flavor, beautifully charred, buttery cause of the part of the fish, but room temp on the first bite hurt it alot. when you have a buttery/oily cut of fish, the last thing you want is for it to be cold. also the beef terriyaki was more like sukiyaki. if your using shredded sliced beef that&#39;s sukiyaki. 

nothing is going to changed from this one review, if they&#39;ve been around 100yrs what do I know."

In the past we have tried to come here and the wait is ridiculous and when you try call to make a reservation they can&#39;t give you a reasonable time or say they have no reservations. I was given a gift certificate here and tried to use it. Took my elderly grandpa was first in line and waited outside 15 minutes before opening and was told to wait until 8:30. You can do much better by going to another Japanese restaurant nearby that has great customer service and reasonable prices. 

I will throw the gift certificate away....time for a reasonable reservation time and better customer service. I will never return here."

We sat at the bar which is a free for all and doesn&#39;t require a reservation. I was very excited to eat here again, but they let us down big time! We ordered the beef yaki udon, black cod collar, broiled oysters, and sea urchin nigiri sushi.

1) Beef yaki udon - VERDICT: Yuck! It was super duper salty, did not have the bonito fish broth flavor, no bonito flakes on top, and the udon noodles were way too soft. This dish was pretty much unedible. I had to order a bowl of rice and pick out the vegetables and beef.
2) Black cod collar - VERDICT: Yum! This was excellent as usual
3) Broiled oysters - VERDICT: It was okay. This dish had a bit of a kick to it, but we weren&#39;t fans of it. However, the oysters seemed fresh.
4) Sea urchin nigiri - VERDICT: I&#39;ve had much better for the same price... This was an unappetizing pale yellow color and didn&#39;t taste like quality. Also, the seaweed wrapping the rice was wilting which means that they prepared the sushi a while ago and it&#39;s been sitting. I ate the sushi immediately after the waitress dropped it off at the bar. The only good thing about it was the generous size of the sushi."

Traditional &#34;family&#34; Japanese food. They have Japanese dishes that you wouldn&#39;t normally see in a restaurant but rather in a Japanese home which I absolutely love. The staff is so friendly and the food is always on point; especially the sushi! The fish is always high quality and they give decent portions. Below are the dishes I love:

- Salmon Nanban
- Tamago (egg nigiri) 
- Gyoza 
- Tempura Ice Cream
- Agedashi Tofu
- Tekka Maki
- Niku Tofu

I called and booked a reservation for me and my husband on his birthday yesterday (02/08). I texted back and forth with whoever was in charge of taking reservation. I asked if the restaurant does anything special for birthday. The person said that they will bring out an ice-cream with candle on it to surprise my husband. It would a nice little surprise and see how much my husband loves Japan, I thought he would be so so happy.

So we came in yesterday, we were super happy to see how traditional this restaurant is. The grandma at the door was friendly and seated  us. Ordering and foods went smoothly. I pretended to go to the restroom, so I can ask about the nice little surprise they PROMISED. I asked the waiter walked by. He said yea yea, let me ask my boss. I saw them chat for several minutes. I waited and waited. Then, the waitress came by and gave us our check. I was like: ..hum, I thought Japanese is very trustworthy..maybe I should wait a little more since this is a surprise???? Well, we waited and I tried to distract my husband with all the talks. Well, their promise obviously didn&#39;t happen. I walked out very dissapointed and I have to say: I&#39;m torn whether or not I will be back. They lost my trust."

It&#39;s difficult to find many restaurants that serve beef sukiyaki like Marina Mago did which was my favorite.

Maneki&#39;s version wasn&#39;t as sweet as the versions I&#39;ve had in Los Angeles.  Nevertheless, it was a good version and priced well.  The main complaint is that the beef had a lot of fat on it that I had to try and pick off before eating.  I guess you have to pay extra for a bowl of rice to go with it.

They understand things like chopping veggies to the correct size (no huge chunks of carrots, onions, peppers, etc.), not over saucing things, and giving generous portions. Ever get Chinese food and have 90% of your dish be practically inedible filler (as in tons of onion and peppers, etc) with just a little bit of the dish&#39;s namesake? Not at Best Choice! I enjoy every last bit of the dish, and never have waste as a result. I always feel like I got my money&#39;s worth, and would still feel that way even if the portions weren&#39;t so generous (but please don&#39;t change this Best Choice, it&#39;s awesome!). 

As noted, the owners are very kind and friendly, and remember you after your first visit. I feel like a valued customer every time I come in...like family!

It was about 7PM this past Tuesday and while my man and I were waiting for an Uber, I came up with the brilliant idea to grab a quick shot of tequila before we got picked up. Ha! This dark, firemen&#39;s bar was quiet, with only two other patrons that I saw. It was clean, small, and had beautiful exposed brick on the walls. 

As we walked up to the bar, I realized with joy that we wouldn&#39;t have to wait. The bartender was ready to serve us with a smile on his face and the sweetest attitude. He seriously made me smile. We asked for two shots of tequila and what we received looked more like a shot in a half, or maybe even two! Ummm, yes please! I asked him to immediately check us out, and shared my plan of doing shots before our Uber arrived. It really cracked him up and he was super-swift with our check. 

While I didn&#39;t taste the food and our visit was no longer than 5 minutes, I can&#39;t help but love this place. I&#39;ve already been thinking of excuses to come back. In fact, I asked my man if we could make this our regular bar, considering it&#39;s a short .4 mile walk from our place. 

Can&#39;t wait to come back and do more shots with that awesome bartender. I just wish I would have gotten his name!"

Great happy hour prices. Pretty large food selection (fries, chicken tenders, jalepeno poppers, etc). I&#39;m pretty sure the well vodka is just rubbing alcohol but, what did I expect? Would certainly come back here again."

Knowing that I&#39;d be blowing a butt load of cash on my two day layover there, I thought I&#39;d ease into the spending- so I Googled &#34;cheap bars near me&#34; and McCoy&#39;s came up. It was just few blocks to walk with my luggage in tow, and it was gonna have to do. 

The place has a warm, neighborhood bar feel with exposed brick and I thought it would be a good spot to get some grub, and slowly yet methodically drink. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was beyond delicious. It came with what looked like a hamburger patty, but when I took my first bite I started to wonder if it was chopped steak. Turns out they grind their own blend and they don&#39;t skimp on the sirloin! It kicked ass. Three warm tortillas came on the side and let&#39;s just say that my plate was almost ready to go back on the clean stack when I was done.

Simon: What can I get ya
Me: You got hot chocolate
Simon: Sure do
Me: Can I get that...with like...ALL THE BOOZE IN IT
Simon: On it
And that was that. Might I add it tasted delicious. 

Our group comes here just about every Tuesday before our weekly work night and have always typically had a good experience. 
My only reason for not a higher rating is that there has been a time or two where other staff members have been slow and not as attentive. The other night I waited at a table across from the bar for a good 10 minutes before being attended to. 

They have happy hour 3-7pm with several items under $3 for food and cheaper prices on alcohol. Their regular menu boasts some great food options as well, many all under $10...which is hard to find in Seattle.

We landed here and the menu looked decent for bar food but we were given a much more limited Events Day menu which was a handful of burgers and sandwiches.  This included zero vegetarian options.  We asked if maybe they could make the cheesy bread on the appetizer menu on the table.  No dice.  My kid ate some okay onion rings for dinner.  Our burgers arrived late and were okay. We were at least distracted by a firetruck that arrived to investigate a vandalism across the street. On the plus side we did not have to wait long for a seat and it was close to the venue.

It&#39;s unique and fun, has great food, friendly staff, and a very neat firestation vibe. I also see some firefighters there on occasion (for you ladies who like a man in a uniform....). ;)

Maybe I should have let this place sit at a solid 4 stars, but I couldn&#39;t help it, I had to add the extra star. I love their buffalo chicken sandwich (which I get with cheese and buffalo sauce because, you know, I&#39;m healthy like that) and their peanut butter bacon burger still calls me in my sleep. Like I said, I&#39;m a healthy eater....

Yes, the neighborhood is, well, interesting.... But, you have to look beyond what meets the eye. Actually, people watching is rather entertaining during lunch, as you do get to see a lot of the craziness. I imagine this area wouldn&#39;t be the safest at night, but if you travel in groups and aren&#39;t a moron when walking through shady neighborhoods, you&#39;ll make it out just fine. 

Oh, and lastly - the beers. What they lack in selection they make up by providing your staples (Moose Drool, Ninkasi, Manny&#39;s, Mac and Jacks, etc...) AND by giving you ice, and I mean ICE cold glasses.  So perfect for a hot day! 

Like I said, probably should be only 4 stars, but I love it too much..."

It&#39;s kind of a divey bar, but the staff is friendly, the drinks are good, and the food is dirt cheap. Can&#39;t beat a $3 chicken quesadilla (or it might be $4, I forget).

The bar itself has kind of a funny layout (think of like an O-shape, with a wall where the hole in the &#39;O&#39; is) so you&#39;d do better either coming early or keeping your group small, if you want to sit all together. If that makes sense.

McCoy&#39;s Firehouse is a staple lunch place for me. The food is good (but not amazing) very cheap and the service is good. If you come here more than 2 or 3 times chances are the wait staff will recognize you and greet you by name.

The food - 3.5 / 5 - Like I mentioned before, its good but not amazing. The food isn&#39;t anything to write home about but its far from bad. They have very good specials going on during the week, you can get a decent steak for around 10 bucks.

The service 5/5 - They&#39;re friendly and attentive here, they&#39;re also very good at remembering their customers. There is also never any fuss about splitting check, even when you have 5 or 6 people in your party.

Atmostphere 3/5 - The place is a little on the small side and it feels kind of like a dive bar. There isn&#39;t really anything wrong with it but it&#39;s still just meh to me.

Greasy late night food also hit the spot - I highly recommend the Onion Rings... or Fried Mozzarella Sticks (worth every calorie!)."

Stopped in here on the way to meeting a friend. Don&#39;t sit in that corner by the door as you go in.. you get ignored. We had started up a conversation with a few folks and we were like 20 minutes for even drinks. TG we weren&#39;t eating. DH got a big ol beer, seemed legit. We paid for cash for our drinks but wow, 18 bucks for the two drinks seemed a little steep for this place. I had vodka on rocks. Just sayin a little spendy. The Atmosphere was fine, this had one of those one bathroom deals. I really hate that about a divy bar sometimes, what if someone locks themself in there or gets sick or whatever what do the rest of us do that have to go? Yea never understood this about the bars. Anyways.. no complaints really and sure, I&#39;d go back. Keep it up!"

I&#39;ve been here oodles of times pre-Mariners&#39; games (I know, right? Who goes to those?), and now for a few football games. While I haven&#39;t tried the food (sorry, I know!), I can vouch for the drinks. A good, solid pour, and if you ask for &#34;something that&#39;s strong, but doesn&#39;t taste bad&#34;, they&#39;ll do that, too. (Your companion just might need to leave at halftime due to barfage, though...)

But it&#39;s a fun pre-game environment, the bartenders are funny and friendly, so I can&#39;t find anything bad to say.

Oh, and the bathrooms are clean and there is more than one stall!"

Which actually make for pretty cool decorations.  Who knew?  

McCoy&#39;s Firehouse is one of those places I always pass by during lunch hour or when I&#39;m on my way to sling fire at another fine Pioneer Square establishment (wink wink).  
But last nite we decided to meet there and hang out...and I gotta say:

Friendly bar staff?  Yes
Quick service?  Yes
Tasty eatins by a happy cook?  Yes
Courteous patrons?  For the most part, yes
Dickheads?  Not last nite
Awesome attitudes had by all?  Yes

For the first time in a long time, we weren&#39;t met w/ a lippy douchebag for a bartender!  SCORE!  
And he apologized for not having the vodka that I wanted, but chose something equally as good to replace it.
Now that&#39;s what I call service."

We have never had a bad meal there and everything is made in house!  The atmosphere is great and the staff is attentive and helpful..  We recently were there for a Seahawks game and it was incredibly fun!  We have also stopped by on our way to and from the stadium since its within walking distance.   A must when in Seattle!

Somehow they manage to not be overflowingly packed but they still provide that great atmosphere after a game.  I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had the food there - beyond an appetizer or two - but the beer is tasty and the seats are comfortable. Outdoor seating is also a good option on a nice day.

Their service is always very good, and the food is too. I&#39;ve been here about 6 times to meet with business partners and they always agree that it&#39;s unique enough to seek out when you need to sit down and chat for a while over good food, but not a full-ambiance dinner.
The only thing that isn&#39;t great is the neighborhood, but it&#39;s totally worth it, especially for lunch."

I have eaten lunch here three different times over the past couple years and each time I am reminded why I don&#39;t go more often. The service by the waitresses is unfriendly and the food is greasy and not very flavorful. 

If you are only going for beer they do have 32 ounce Budweisers which is nice. 

So, if you have to wet your whistle before a sporting event just grab a beer here and get food somewhere else. Or just go somewhere else, lots of options in Pioneer Square."

The tap selection is decent and it is fairly clean compared to fuel across the street. My biggest complaint is that it is so small and yet they are too lazy to open the deck on a night where they are overflowing with people. So, instead of opening the deck the other night you lost business to Temple from 5 people in my group and however many other people left. I have been here probably 3-4 times and not eaten mostly before so I can&#39;t comment on the food."

While they do not have a big beer selection, they always have something tasty on tap. The inside of the bar has a funky, local bar feel (which is a good thing). It&#39;s a great place to grab a pint before the game. Food is typical bar food but they have decent happy hour deals."

However, my wife, her Brazilian friend and I decided to catch the US-Ghana game last Saturday.  I was first surprised to have bacon and eggs at a bar.  The food was OK, but it was breakfast, and I was hungry.  We had lunch during the game and it was more what I expected, greasy bar food.

It&#39;s a great place to see games.  When Donovan scored the goal a siren and a light went off.  It&#39;s a great addition to the game.

While the game was tragic, the experience was well worth it.  I would definitely suggest seeing sporting events here."

Everything you want a dive/sports bar/firehouse themed restaurant to be. It&#39;s awesome inside, with gorgeous molded ceilings and super comfortable booths to sit in. Bathrooms are clean. Good alternative music playing. 

The food was delicious; the drinks were great; our waiter was cool and very friendly. It&#39;s centrally located in Pioneer Square so when we were done we just walked to another bar (the ONLY reason we left was because we wanted to dance). The other awesome thing is that you can actually hear your friends talking without screaming or going outside! 

Fantastic place, cool memorabilia, everything you could ask for in a low key restaurant/bar. Next time I&#39;m in Seattle I&#39;m for sure going back."

This place is the best bar in the pioneer square area I&#39;ve been to so far.  You have to order food and drinks at the bar. Surprisingly the bathrooms are modern and clean. I really didn&#39;t expect that from the wooden bar furniture.  They also have a modern Jukebox.  Best time to come here is after a game or at night. 

I must warn you though: If you only have a 30min-1hr lunch, don&#39;t come here. The service is slow."
