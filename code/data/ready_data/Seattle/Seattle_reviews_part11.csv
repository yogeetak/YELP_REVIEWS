Go with either the Italian, the club, or the tri-tip.  Good options for local beverages as well.

But if it&#39;s a rainy Saturday (or Monday, or really any day the ends in -y in Seattle), do yourself a favor and get a cup (with a sandwich) or just a big bowl of Martino&#39;s chili. Tri tip chunks, roasted tomatoes, and there had to be some pork in there too. 

All in all-- your first choice for lunch in Phinney."

I came up on their last day for lunch with the BF and had the steak salad. It was delicious! Fresh ingredients, tons of flavor, and the restaurant itself is small &amp; cozy.

Plus I&#39;m beating the dinner rush!

My last visits were back in Sep/Oct 2013, right before I had major surgery and then rehospitalized. I enjoyed my chat way back when with Chris Martino. Major protein got me through  hospital food and being tethered to an IV pole. Talking to him, one could hear the passion for the menu items.

Seriously, after eating one half of tonight&#39;s Santa Maria Tri-Tip....why the 3 year time warp? Probably because there are so many terrific, indie spots to get sandwiches in Seattle. I ordered the Tri-Tip with no sides, dining solo, with just water to focus and get reacquainted.

Personally, I&#39;d love just a pile of their signature tri-tip with a drizzle of their chimichuri on top. Give me a fork and knife, says this carnivore. Yes, that smoky, complex flavor, a bit of heat, tender and succulent. Sigh.

It seems the folks behind Martino&#39;s will be focusing on catering and their last day of service at their Phinney Ridge site will be 12/4/16. 

After writing this much, time for me to polish off the second half and say farewell. All the best to the Martino crew with their soon to expand catering venture."

I think if I had got the ribs earlier than 8pm they would have been much better but the sauce is not good. It does not state on the menu these are South Carolina style.  Which isn&#39;t good in the first place!
The sides were ok. The beans were a tad sweet, could&#39;ve used a bit more spice. The coleslaw did not have enough dressing which was a disappointment. I ended up making my own dressing because the actual slaw was tasty, however, undressed.
I will go back for the tri tip. Always want to give places a few at-bats before calling them out.

The Italian- Great. Fresh mozzarella, crispy roasted pork, onions and Mama Lils

All their sandwiches come on Macrina bread, which is my favorite bakery.

Fresh grilled corn on the cob and smoked potato salad are perfect accompaniments.

The smoked potato salad was a vinegar base vs a mayo base, very unusual but awesome. 

Super casual atmosphere with riendly counter service. The only weird thing was we chose to sit at the bar which was cool, but as it got busier people were standing in line all around us to place their order, kinda made me a little claustrophobic. 

 They have a really small menu, which shouldn&#39;t scare you away because it seems like everything on the menu is a home run.

The counter service is always cheerful and the food comes quickly, considering it&#39;s made to order.

The place is small but trendy sandwich spot that I would expect in Phinney.  The menu is small but to be honest, they really don&#39;t need to add any more options.

I ordered the tri-tip sandwich per recommendation from my co-worker.  It took a few minutes to get my order but it was definitely worth the wait.  While I was waiting I sat at a small table facing a mounted TV so I wasn&#39;t bored.  

Now on to the food: The sandwich size is a little small for my liking but it was an EXTREMELY delicious sandwich.  The steak is very tender with some roasted poblano &amp; tomato salsa generously served on top of it.  I would have to say, it was flawlessly prepared.  I am definitely coming back tomorrow to get another one!

Update: Came back to get another tri-tip sandwich.  Still tasted the same.  Loved it.  I went and got a cup of the Martino&#39;s chili and although it had tri-tip, pork loin, chicken breast, red &amp; black beans, smoked tomatoes &amp; roasted poblano, I wasn&#39;t a big fan of it.  I&#39;m not sure if it is usually like that but the chili tasted a little old and was not a big fan of the &#34;over smoked&#34; sauce."

A place that has a tiny menu, with a few sandwiches and salads. The menu is on the wall, and the location is very clean; with a white interior. 

The food?  Well, It&#39;s a meat place, so expect meat, it&#39;s not cheap sandwiches, but they are tasty.  I had their BBQ Cuban, as well as and Tri Tip Sandwich.. yes two sandwiches, it was my cheat day, it happens.  So what made the meat tasty, was the flavor that was instilled by the smoke.  I don&#39;t know what they use, but the meat had an excellent flavor, and tenderness.  

Potato Salad, so I needed a side also, of it was a good mix of tangy, and the textures were just right, because in my mind, BBQ includes a potato side.  

So what you have here, is a basic looking, clean, hip looking place, serving BBQ.  I really want to say, it&#39;s too clean.. a BBQ place should have some grit and darkness, because BBQ is dirty and messy, smokey.   Also, not the cheapest eat... but worth going to if you are seeking some meat, stuffed between bread."

I opted for the Tri-Tip Sandwich. The steak was great smoky and tender, served on soft Macrina Bread smothered in delicious Chimichurri. In my opinion the salsa on the sandwich was served too cold and it made for a strange composition of hot steak and cold tomatoes. The potato salad was ok. It lacked fat and the occasionally large chunks of pickled red onion were overly acidic. I probably wouldn&#39;t get it again.

We ordered the two best sellers, the Santa Maria Tri-Tip and Big Italian sandwiches. Our experience was quite different than other diners and made me wonder if we were eating at the right place. Instead of the tender and juicy smoked meats described by others, we got tough pieces of meat that were full of sinew. In the case of the Big Italian, the pork tasted old. I resorted to eating the tri tip sandwich with a knife and fork after the first bite. For $10 sandwiches you definitely expect better. 

The garnishes on the sandwiches and the bread were both pluses. The grilled onions and smoked peppers on the Italian were a nice contrast to the smoke on the meat. The chimuchuri on the tri-tip has a similar tasty effect.

The service was disinterested at best. Another troubling thing was no hand soap in the bathroom. Hope the cook took care of business before arriving at work."

The tri tip sandwich was fresh and they use macrina bread. It was pretty tasty according to the hubby. It was a tad on the smaller siZe and might not fill you up. Grilled corn was a nice side. 

Nice, but not comparable to paseos. Took out one star for lack of vegetarian options and for size of sandwich as it was 10.5$. I have had the only veggie caprese sandwich before and didnt like it as it seemed to be made on the same grill or used some type of oil which tasted of meat. If they can take care of the oil/ grill issue, it was a decent  sandwich.

They also had a tv in the corner- it was tuned to fifa world cup when we were there- a plus. Big windows let you people watch on phinney ave.

Went in for a quick dinner last night and tried the Bar-B-Cuban for $11.  When the sandwich arrived I nearly exclaimed out loud on how small it was.  For $11 I expect a hearty sandwich with plenty of meat and probably some sort of side (even a handful of potato chips would have made it a bit more satifsfying).  This sandwich was small!!  A square hamburger size telera/ciabbata style roll was filled with maybe 4 thin slices of pork loin, topped with a layer of carmelized onions. My tact won over, however, and I smiled at the server and thanked her.  The flavor of the sandwich was great with super tasty onions, a nice amount of smoke to the meat and a delicious mustard sauce. For the size of the sandwich, though, I would have expected to pay more like $6-8 (and I&#39;d still be dissapointed with no side).

Despite the wonderful flavors, I won&#39;t be returning to Martinos.  Just too expensive.

I&#39;ve had almost every one now, and loved it every time.  I&#39;ve also had the chili, which comes with big-ass hunks of steak in it.  Not a light side at all, but if you&#39;re craving some bomb meat chili, its worth a try.  

If I&#39;m not getting Ken&#39;s for lunch, I&#39;m probably getting Martinos, highly recommend!"

Yes, the sandwiches are a bit overpriced for the portion that you get but I honestly don&#39;t mind because they are so delicious, and they leave me (a 22 year old female) satisfied. Quality, fresh ingredients and the meats are smoked in house. The meats and the sauces (mostly made in house as well) are incredible.

Great Sandwich! Is it better than my old favorite Tri-Tip sandwich in Seattle The Fast Eddie at Honey Hole? Boy, that&#39;s a toughie. I think it requires more research on my part, but they are both really good and you could not go wrong with either one.

The potato salad didn&#39;t fare as well, unfortunately.  The taste was there.  It&#39;s was a quasi-German-style potato salad with a nice vinegar flavor, which I like and the crispy bacon bits and the scallions were a great addition.  But the potatoes were cut into really large pieces and weren&#39;t cooked enough.  You don&#39;t want al dente spuds in your potato salad and these were much firmer than al dente.  I chalk it up to growing pains, I&#39;m relatively sure that it was just an oversight and that the salad is great almost all the time."

Strolled in for lunch over the weekend and right away noticed the space was a good size with plenty of seating, bright, and clean. 

Their menu had few items but exactly what a place like this should have. Not too much to overwhelm you and allows them to specialize. I ordered the &#34;Smoke Club&#34; sandwich and my wife ordered the &#34;Big Italian&#34; sandwich. 

Service was quick and sandwiches were superb. The bread was fresh and meats were succulent. There was a little too much mayo on mine but I looked past that as the taste was great. I tried my wife&#39;s sandwich and loved that one even more than mine.

The service was super friendly-- homey even. They really do a good job of making you feel like you are walking in to your own kitchen. 

As far as the food, the sandwiches are pretty good. Not the best I&#39;ve ever had, and they&#39;re certainly not cheap, but the meat is a high quality, the ingredients are fresh, and the bread is awesome.

My favorite is the Santa Maria Tri-tip (which is probably their signature item). Really delicious tri-tip steak with a chimichurri sauce that doesn&#39;t overwhelm. The oil really adds a good flavor to the bread without being too greasy. The tomato/bruschetta-like blend makes a nice balance of flavor and texture."

This sandwich shop has this trendy high-end feel but evokes a warm and welcoming vibe. I got the tri-tip sirloin sandwich and it was quite wonderful. Probaly the best sandwich I&#39;ve had in the past year that I can recal. The combination of the tomato/onion roasted salsa (like a topping for bruschetta) combined with the chimichurri sauce and the toasted roll was just awesome. My little girl got the grilled cheese and even that simple thing ($3) was buttery bread cheesy goodness.

For our sides, we tried the potato salad, black beans, and roasted corn. The corn was on the cob and I preferred it trimmed... but the flavors were good. The black beans had a lot going on... onions, brown sugar, BBQ sauce. It was sweeter than I expected but still tasty. I really liked the potato salad... lots of bacon bits and scallions and onions.

The chimichurri is pleasant, though it was a bit small given the price and the meat was only solid. On my second visit the Bar-B-Cuban and the Big Italian both shined, 5/5 for both.

The smoked meat itself seemed delicious.  I say &#39;seemed&#39; because it was completely obscured by an interesting choice of condiments and additions to the sandwich.

We had the Cuban and the Big Italian.  I&#39;m not sure why they call it a Cuban.  It has nothing in common with this classic sandwich except that the meat is pork - sorry, I LOVE a good Cuban.  Among other unfortunate flavors, the bbq sauce on the faux Cuban was thin and lacked complexity.  The Big Italian was overpowered by the pepperoncini and really, not so big.

The service was friendly and quick, which I appreciate.  The atmosphere was cute.  Unfortunately, the food fell a little flat."

The menu is very limited, just 4-5 sandwiches and 2 salads and some sides.  But the Santa Maria Tri-Tip Sandwich was just awesome.  The X factor here is that they smoke the meat first (red oak to specific for the tri-tip), which makes for an extremely flavorful sandwich, which complimented beautifully with salsa and a chimichurri sauce.  The  store front was ironically occupied by a vegan leather shop, and it&#39;s a bright space with floor to ceiling windows overlooking Greenwood Ave and an interesting selection of old knives for décor (check out my pic of the knives in the restroom).  I would love to see some entrees come later, like a smoked ribeye steak.

Personally, I think $10 for a fabulous tri-tip sandwich beats a &#34;five dolla foot long&#34; any day of the week!

The tri-tip salad is a real salad with a nice serving of beef, the chili ($3 and $5 portions) is a taste treat - if this was a hole-in-the-wall in Pioneer Square, there would be lines out the door!

I went to Martino&#39;s yesterday for their first day being open to the public.  I really enjoyed the ambiance, the tiling, the judicious use of decorative elements, and how light the place feels.

I will say that the food was good, but for me the price points for the food, especially since it is not a full service establishment are high.   $9.00+ for a medium sized sandwich, ($12 when you add on tax and tip) no sides, no drink and no service is too much for me to be a regular customer.

On the plus side, I really appreciate smaller, focused eateries that do something well and don&#39;t try to do to much and Martino&#39;s is a good example of that.

I am going to bump it to a rating of 4 stars because I am going to assume that the employees are going to be as consistently friendly as they were yesterday.

We also tried the smoked chicken breast salad, tossed with roasted red peppers, corn, and cojita cheese. Basically we left very happy.

I am not a big meat eater, so the fact that I truly enjoyed the meat heavy sandwich( a lil more onions and peppers I would have loved cuz they tasted so good too)  is a testament at how flavorful the meat is. 
The sandwiches are around $10 a piece but you do get a $10 dollar sandwich, we didn&#39;t feel robbed. 
The staff was cool, the music was good, the scene overall what you want from a small neighborhood joint.   It is a small joint with only a handful of seating options so getting the food to go for a picnic is what I plan to do next time. The ambiance inside though is nice, from the big blue mason jar with free lemon water to the doors having meat presses for handles.

I was excited to wander around this little nook of Phinney Ridge a few days ago and stumbled upon this new spot. The menu is small and it seems like a lot of their business may be centered around catering, but the two things I had were pretty fantastic. The tri-tip was extremely flavorful, with some sort of chimichurri-type sauce. The bread had a nice crunch to it but softened up as the meat juices seeped into it. The side of black beans was pretty good as well.

My friend ordered the chicken club (or something along those lines). While it was yummy, it definitely wasn&#39;t anything super special. I&#39;d say there are better versions elsewhere.

The space is nice for a quick and casual dinner with 1-2 friends, but definitely not a lot of room. I think in total there are 8 bar stools along the window and two tables which seat 2-4. Definitely worth stopping in, especially if you need a red meat fix!"

The sandwiches and the salads are just to die for!
I got the bbq sandwich and it was the the perfect balance of sweet and savory. 
My taste buds were dancing! 

Not only is the food really great, the customer service is excellent. The woman at the register was very personable and friendly. My godchild was running around the small space and instead of giving us one of those annoyed looks that some people get, she was very kind and asked about her and told us about her kids. 

Definitely coming back"

I REALLY want to like this place. 

It&#39;s tiny, it&#39;s independently owned, love the subway tile, love the 2 beers on tap. 
It&#39;s a very bright, cheerful spot. 

Unfortunately, the most important thing (the FOOD) isn&#39;t that great. It&#39;s pretty AMATEUR.  
I&#39;ve gone twice, now. 

-1st time I tried their BBQ Ribs Special. Nothing memorable, slightly underdone. 

-Last night I tried the &#34;Bar-B-Cuban&#34;. It was just not good. Chewy pork loin would benefit from a thinner slice and some seasoning. SOOO SWEET. It was like a candy sandwich. Between the &#39;mustard&#39; BBQ (tasted ZERO mustard) and the balsamic onion &#39;jam&#39; it was a sugar bomb the equivalent to 5 or so Krispy Kreme donuts. 
How this resembles a Cuban, I&#39;ll never know. I guess there was Gruyere in there, but I couldn&#39;t taste or see it...what a waste of some amazing, expensive cheese. 
A Cuban is a perfectly balanced sandwich. This was FAR frrom that. No acidity from pickles, no saltiness from ham, no funky umami from the Gruyere, no rich fatiness from slow cooked pork. Re-think this one, Martino&#39;s. 

Martino&#39;s could really benefit from making some better sides, too. 


I&#39;m beginning to think that no one tastes the food they make anymore."

All too often a steak sandwich can become too greasy, where the bread takes on more of a characteristic sponge-like quality. The Santa Maria Tri-Tip is the perfect solution to this problem. Moist, yet perfectly smoked morsels of steak are layered onto one of Macrina Bakery&#39;s foccacia-esque flavor torpedos - which first receives a nice slathering of chimichurri sauce !  This combination of items is capped off by smoked - yes SMOKED - Roma tomatoes and diced red onion, perfectly rounding out this tangy balance of smokiness and acidity. One can taste the effort that must go into this delightful sammy. 

Unfortunately for my waistline I eat out a lot, so believe me when I say this is one of the best steak sandwiches I have ever eaten. Keep up the good work guys, and see you soon ! !"

Planet Java is an old school diner in a sea of hipster restaurants popping up all over Pioneer Square. It&#39;s fantastic. It&#39;s the kind of diner that you understand the second you walk in and makes you feel like home. It&#39;s diner food with no frills at good prices. The staff is older and probably have worked there for decades. Again, this place is no nonsense. Sit, relax and order some pancakes. 

In juxtaposition with the old-school feel, they check you out using a Square and iPad. This makes the checkout super fast which seems to fit right in with the low-key but speedy mentality of the diner.

Speaking of time, this place has probably a hundred clocks in it. I try not to let it bother me that only a few of them are set to the correct time. But every diner needs a schtick I guess. Still not sure what the clocks have to do with &#34;Planet&#34; or &#34;Java&#34;. (I love how my glowing review is 50% complaining about the name.)

Anyway, if you find yourself in Pioneer Square and want some comforting food that won&#39;t empty your wallet, this is the place!"

Our food took 45 minutes to come.. We all ordered eggs... I&#39;ve never had a breakfast place take so long for the food!
When our food was finally ready the waitress brought it out but then proceeded to talk to people waiting to be seated with our food in her hands for 2 minutes... It was very odd that she didn&#39;t bring us our food and then go talk to them.

It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like a fancy meal here or there. But there&#39;s just times when I don&#39;t need or want a deconstructed, hyper-locally-sourced, hand-crafted-with-a-handlebar-mustache-in-a-mason-jar kind of meal. I just want to go somewhere nearby that&#39;s quick, low-key and not-even-close to trendy for a regular old, stick-to-your-ribs meal. You know, the kind of place that doesn&#39;t scoff at you for asking for American cheese instead of cheddar. Or better yet, the kind of diner that doesn&#39;t attract the brunch crowd. 

Enter Planet Java Diner. 

No, it&#39;s not weird, 90&#39;s coffee and smoothie place. But actually, the &#34;java&#34; in the title does allude to the decor inside, which looks like what a &#34;throwback diner&#34; would have looked like in 1993. The booths were wobbly, but the place was just gently a-buzz at about half capacity on a Sunday afternoon. Perfect. The service was no-frills, but efficient and nice. 

We came here for the eggs Benedict and Java Planet did not disappoint. Just something to note: eggs benny isn&#39;t on their menu, but it&#39;s served &#34;every weekend until they&#39;re out and Friday afternoons.&#34; When my dish came out I was excited to see pan-fried, shredded potatoes for hash brown, and not breakfast potatoes in disguise. The eggs Benedict was simply prepared and very tasty. Was it the best I&#39;ve ever had? No. But it&#39;s delicious enough to keep me coming back. I really only had two criticisms. We asked for our muffins extra toasted and they were not. And next time around I&#39;ll likely ask for my hash browns extra crispy, too--a personal preference, for sure. Other than that, everything was great. Even the diner coffee was delicious, which I&#39;m sure many native Seattle folk may argue, haha. 

When you&#39;re all finished with your meal, this retro diner goes modern when they close you out via Square on an iPad. Super quick and efficient? Yep!

It can be challenging to find a good breakfast, especially one of the hearty, sticks to your ribs kind. Bonus points if you are outside the south and can find good country fried steak. I heard Planet Java delivered on both counts, so I decided to go with a group for breakfast.

Planet Java has an old school diner feel to it. It has lots of décor that makes it feel like something from the 50&#39;s or 60&#39;s, including a lot of cool old signage and toys, providing a very unique atmosphere for the Seattle area. It also is not what you would expect coming from the outside, as it doesn&#39;t look like much before you go in. The restaurant itself is comfortable, and we had no problem getting a table in the middle of the week, but I could imagine it filling up on the weekend and requiring a wait.

The menu is fairly large for breakfast, but I had heard about the country fried steak and eggs for breakfast, so that is what I ordered.  I got a sizable country fried steak smothered in country gravy, 2 eggs (I ordered fried over medium), house hash browns, and a biscuit. The steak was fabulous, with a great flavor in the meat, breading, and gravy, and it wasn&#39;t overly breaded either. The eggs were prepared as I expected, and the hash browns were also quite tasty. The biscuit wasn&#39;t amazing but was still good. The portion was large and when I finished I was quite satisfied. In fact I didn&#39;t even feel like I needed to eat lunch after having such a hearty breakfast!

The prices were quite reasonable, especially considering the portion size, and the food was prepared excellently. The service was attentive, and the food came out fast and hot. On this particular visit I had brought some guests from Hungary, and they were also impressed with the food and service. I will definitely be back for breakfast, and I would like to try them for lunch sometime as well. If you want a hearty old school breakfast that is reasonably priced and also delicious, then check out Planet Java!"

Cool retro feel with a kitschy clock and Coca Cola-themed interior, checkerboard floors and metal tables. Service is blazing fast and friendly, and if you want it your way, they make it happen. Some of the snooty, expensive gastro-pubs around here could take lessons from these efficient pros!

My better half got the pancake combo; I got the French toast combo. Pancakes were textbook Seattle (you better not screw up pancakes in Seattle!): fluffy, plate-sized buttermilk creations with a host of available additions, like blueberries, chocolate chips, banana, peanut butter and so on, though she got hers plain. 

Eggs were cooked perfectly and unbroken, and the generous Black Forest-style ham steak was juicy, browned just slightly and smokey-flavored. The French toast was also perfectly cooked and plated, so delicate and custardy it practically melted in the mouth. Someone back in the kitchen knows how to work a proper griddle! So nice to see fine attention payed to these American diner classics!

I saw some Yelpers whine about the prices, which I thought was bizarre, until I considered: it&#39;s easy to forget where and when you are in this joint.

It feels like a typical mid-western small-town diner from some past decade. You actually have to force yourself to remember: this business is paying premium rent in 2016 Seattle, not in 1974 Sedalia, Missouri or some such. The cost of doing business here will be reflected in your bill...but it&#39;s still reasonable for the neighborhood; a big breakfast with coffee and tea ran us $30, with tip! Not bad at all, in this boomtown.

Sooo close to five stars! Take care of that pesky intermittent mildew smell, and keep up on the general maintenance the vintage seats, tables and fixtures will forever require, and you will get that fifth star from me! 

Recommended. Highly!"

The staff were attentive, helpful and pleasant which I must admit seams to be the norm here in the USA.

- The food was terrible and bland. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, and it was the WORST I&#39;ve ever had. It was dry and overcooked. Seriously, even Denny&#39;s has a way better tasting version than this.
- The eggs are so flavorless that I&#39;m positive there was some sort of &#34;filler&#34; being used. Gross.
- The sourdough toast was stale and cold. The butter couldn&#39;t even melt over it.
- The service was slow and forgetful.
- The decorations are tacky and the whole setting is just depressing. Feels like you&#39;re in a basement.
- The food is WAY overpriced for the low quality.

The background:
My fiancee and I went here as a back-up when another brunch spot in Pioneer Square had too long of a wait. It was Saturday late morning and this place was maybe 1/3 full."

Being right around the corner from my building, I come here often, rain or shine, to sit in a warm restaurant with cheerful servers, fun decor, and breakfast all day. 

You seat yourself. Look around, find a spot. See one that&#39;s dirty? They&#39;ll clean it. But they&#39;re busy, working... Serving the people currently sat. And once you do, you&#39;ll become part of that and get prompt service, too. Take a look around, hear the cooks cooking, take off your coat, before you know it, a spot opens up. 

It saddens me to see reviews of people who complain about small mom-and-pop places like this. Being someone who served breakfast for two years, this place is great. What are you expecting when walking in a Pioneer Square diner? Gourmet? My food comes out in less then 10 minutes - I&#39;m not expecting the &#34;best breakfast I&#39;ve ever had&#34; but it comes pretty damn close when I hear that 50&#39;s music playing and sip my warm coffee. Which is fantastic every time. They accommodating to vegetarians, which is awesome. And it&#39;s pretty decently priced for where we are in town. 

I come to read or write, eat up, pay and leave. Patrons around me laugh and take photos, probably tourists visiting Seattle. 

I recommend PJ. The food doesn&#39;t get 5 stars, but when you include everything else, it adds up.  

Enjoy!"

Place was probably 2/3rds full at around 9:15am, but there were still plenty of spots.  I grabbed one and waited for my friend to arrive.  The waitress was super nice and brought me coffee while I waited and was not bothered by the fact my friend didn&#39;t arrive for another 15-20 minutes.  While I waited, I admired the décor, which was fun and funky, and perused the menu, which was filled with all kinds of mouth-watering goodies.

Once my friend arrived, we placed our orders.  I went for a small breakfast - just a couple of scrambled eggs and some veggie sausage.  Both were super tasty and it was just enough food for me.  My friend had the Denver omelette, which was HUGE!  It came with a side of hashbrowns and toast.  I tried both the hashbrowns and the toast and they were top notch.  

The only downside to our meal is that it took quite a long time for the food to arrive.  Other than that, things were great.  Wait staff are all friendly and keep your mug full of coffee.  Prices are good and they accept credit cards (and handily use iPads with card scanners to settle your bill tableside).

Planet Java is a really neat, kitschy hideaway down some side street in Seattle. It&#39;s really embraced the 50s/60s diner feel, and has about a million different types of clocks. It&#39;s a comfortable space.

I ordered Biscuits and Gravy ($7.75), which came with eggs (scrambled) and hash browns. The eggs and hash browns were solid; fluffy and crispy, respectively. I was not a huge fan of my biscuits, as they weren&#39;t very buttery, and the gravy was pretty bland. Service was fine, though I we could hear two of them arguing about a third employee in the middle of the diner which was unnecessary.

Sit at the bar and watch the staff full on panic and enjoy your pancake or whatever while feeling ashamed for making people wait on you, you sadomasochist.

We went on a Sunday morning around normal breakfast time so I completely understand that it can be hectic and stressful for the waitstaff, but when their anxiety and frustration is palpable and they are so vocal about the problems that they are having that you turn to your girlfriend and ask &#34;should we help them?&#34; then there is a problem. I&#39;m honestly surprised that no one on staff stabbed someone while we were there. There was a lot of &#34;DO THIS&#34; and not a lot of &#34;I GOT THIS&#34; going on. Also, lots of &#34;I&#39;M WORKING ON IT, SHARLENE!&#34; paired with eye-rolling. Customers appeared to be as on edge as the waitstaff... I imagine it was similar to the ambiance right before a prison riot.

There was this sweet old man sitting next to us who waited patiently for coffee a solid 15 minutes. After he got his coffee and waiting a lot longer, he got to a point where he said--very politely-- &#34;if you haven&#39;t started making that omelette yet, go ahead and cancel the order&#34; which broke my heart because this dude looked hungry and old so this may have been the tipping point and he is now dead. 

Food was decent; coffee was not. They have a bunch of clocks on the wall, most of which are not that cool except for the &#34;Kit-Cat&#34; clock. We promptly bought one after leaving and it is now my prized possession, so, due to that, 2-STARS! Thanks, Planet Java!!!"

Prices are fair, service is always excellent, and the food is great. I remarked to my dining companion this morning that of all the &#34;happening&#34; food places Seattle gets written up for, Planet Java hasn&#39;t yet gotten a nod. We&#39;re not talking Michelin stars here but it&#39;s rock-solid diner chow, straight up.

It&#39;s busier than I remember, which is great for PJ but less so for me. Fair amount of okie tourists snickering about still being hung over from their legal herb the night before, and some families waiting for a turn on the Underground Tour. Most unfortunate was the marked increase in grossly over-perfumed techbro yuppies and their corn-fed North Face girlfriends, but that&#39;s Seattle nowadays. 

Long story short, Planet Java is where it&#39;s at. Im bummed it&#39;s not the local &#34;secret&#34; it once was, but I&#39;ll be a regular until I finally can&#39;t afford the rent in Seattle anymore."

They used actual chocolate ice cream - no biggie. I&#39;ve always seen vanilla with the choc. syrup. They over mixed it so it wasn&#39;t very thick. Plus, it was nearly $7.50 for a milkshake, not including tip. REALLY!? It was only so-so. For that price it should have came with booze or something. The prices here are horrendous."

But you&#39;re guaranteed decent and quick comfort food to scare away your mid-day Blues. Some no- nonsense, solid items on the menu are Biscuits and gravy, peanut butter pancakes, chicken fried steak, coffee milkshake.

First, I have to say how utterly amazing the service here is. The waitress that I always see is happy, efficient, friendly, and accurate with your order. There is an amazing team of guys that come around and fill your coffee and water and take your payment, and they get all of the same compliments from me. The food is really good as is the coffee, and the 50&#39;s diner atmosphere is so fun. To top it all off, every time I go in there they are playing my favorite music and bands (often it&#39;s a 1980s mix). The prices are not steep and I always find parking really close to the diner. My only complaint is the restroom, which smells like a used litterbox. I think it&#39;s due to the chalk that people use to write all over the walls, which is a fun idea but peeee-yew!

Think Time After Time video by Cyndi Lauper.  The server, Patty, was the cherry on the top of my experience here.   She was a real peach.

And.  They.  Were.  Really.  Good.  Like, so good, my husband said it was just as good as his favorite burger spot at home.  Well, that&#39;s saying something.

I had the burger with cheese and giant onion rings.  My husband&#39;s was cheese and bacon.
I had a side salad with mine.  He had the fries.

So yesterday the oddest of circumstances led me here for Happy Hour to meet up with someone with whom we shared a mutual friend.

The bartender and the one who took the next shift were both really nice.  The people already sitting at the bar were friendly.  It was a nice and comfortable atmosphere to me.  It&#39;s right down the street from work so I feel like I can just come here and have a beer in this unassuming place again in the near future.

A pint of the happy hour Hoppy Bitch was $4 and I had some greasy yet tasty fries to soak that up.

It&#39;s not in the most parking friendly area unless you know the hood.  The best place to park is at the lot a couple blocks away on 5th and Stewart.

I will certainly be back."

This was my first time in this surprisingly expansive dive. My hamburger sliders were delicious and the fries were pretty good, but my friends were disappointed with their meals (dry hamburger and overly-herbed meatloaf). The drinks were strong but didn&#39;t taste great, and the server was nice, overall, it was fine but not amazing."

It was also the last one we went to, so whether it&#39;s pure luck or the amount of alcohol in my system, I&#39;m not really sure, but I liked the vibe here.

For starters, it&#39;s low-key. The front room seems to be mostly regulars sitting at the bar, but we immediately went back to the room with the pool table, where we played a few games and sat on the couches rocking out to the music: staff had no problem with us making requests and selections, so we were mixing Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and other 90s greats for a great, chill mood.

I&#39;m not much of a drinker, and by this point was not intending to partake of more, but the bartender insisted that the lady try the chardonnay- so I did, and it wasn&#39;t overly sweet or heavy as it sometimes can be.

The bathroom décor is quite nice and surprisingly clean for a place that initially seems to err on the side of divey. Marilyn Monroe features in the black-and-white décor scheme, and there was ample toilet paper and paper towels- always a must, and usually out by the end of the night."

We saw the Angry Orchard sign in the window and decided to take a look at the menu. The menu is pretty limited but it was most of the typical pub food and the prices weren&#39;t outrageous. 

We ordered a couple of pints of cider and the fish and chips from the bartender. This is more of a bar with food than a restaurant (there&#39;s a sign in the window clearly stating &#34;no minors&#34;). We took a seat at a table near the front window and enjoyed our drinks while listening to the music (music was nice and the volume wasn&#39;t so loud that having a normal level conversation was difficult). 

The food was cooked fresh to order (which is exceptionally nice when it involves fried food) and arrived in a reasonable time (not a place if you&#39;re in a big hurry but not slow either). My husband, who&#39;s British, said that this is the best fish and chips he&#39;s had since he&#39;s been in the US. The fish was a nice, solid fillet and the batter was light and crispy and perfectly cooked. The chips were sort of a small wedge and were obviously made from actual potatoes as opposed to the reconstituted garbage many places try to pass off as fries. 

Sure, it&#39;s not a fancy place but the bartender was very attentive, the food was great and the prices were fair for the area."

The user just created her account the same month as the lounge opened (Sept 2013) and this is her only review on Yelp.  I don&#39;t think anyone is buying it.  Update:  I reported the first review as a possible fake to Yelp and it has been deleted. 

I know it&#39;s called a restaurant and lounge but really, it&#39;s a bar with a kitchen.  It&#39;s not a place for kids.  It&#39;s perfect for people eating during the lunch rush.  The bar is updated with modern accents and a nice wood bar.  It&#39;s a small venue  with front windows but has great potential for regulars.  The bartender is nice and the place looks pretty clean.  

They have a separate small room with a free pool table and 2 couches.  The pool room doesn&#39;t have any windows and the walls are pretty bare.  The best part about the pool room is that it has its own jukebox system that&#39;s not connected to the rest of the bar so you can play what you want (pay of course).

The menu has a perfect number of items for the size of the venue.  They serve lunch and I was told that they don&#39;t serve food at night.  I wasn&#39;t happy with the menu prices.  The menu states that all of the food items are $2.00 off from 11-2.  The prices would be reasonable if they knocked $2.00 off most of the items for the entire day, then had some lunch specials.  I uploaded pictures of the menu.  You can&#39;t tell how late they serve food.

The menu itself needs someone to make some formatting corrections.  This is a minor issue but it&#39;s something that can be fixed with minimal time and effort.  The menu should look perfect.  It&#39;s the first impression you get of the kitchen.  The spacing isn&#39;t consistent between the categories and the items.  There is even leftover space toward the bottom of the center column so there is room to make the appropriate corrections.  All of the category items are in order by most expensive to least expensive except one.  By putting them in this order it highlights the high cost of each item.  They should be mixed up.  The chicken burger is listed first under burgers!!!  That makes no sense.  You will sell many more beef burgers than chicken burgers.  It makes it look like the chicken burger is better than the local Angus burger.  Angus is capitalized by the way.  Who is Don and Joe (so confusing)?

I know I dogged the menu but I will definitely be pack to hang out for the night!"

Atmosphere: lively bar scene.

Food: we only got a few nibbles including garlic bread and artichoke hummus pita plate. The Garlic Bread was what you&#39;d expect. The Pita Plate came with vegetables aside from the main artichoke dip, which I enjoyed. I had a margarita cocktail that came in a big glass. 

Service: the person taking the order was nice in coming by our area and checking on us, especially since we weren&#39;t sure what we wanted and ordered our items at different times. Service was quick and painless.

No deep fryer...those must have been made in house.  We asked for a menu only to find out that the cheapest snack option was oven roasted cashews...incredibly over priced..5 bucks...

We finished our beers and asked for a check.  The check, which was sitting right next to the register 20 feet from us, took at least five minutes to get to us.

I know Jesus drank in his day and appreciated a good meal.  So, I don&#39;t feel guilty or ashamed, but rather proud of myself for letting go and enjoying a lovely thing.

Hilltop Ale House was delightful from start to finish.

Attentive and friendly staff, a fine selection of brew, and a decent menu.  Our table shared meals of homemade soup and salads, flat iron steak sandwiches, and a cilantro pesto chicken quesadilla worth writing home about.   

We said a prayer before we ate, just in case."

Had lunch with a friend who ordered a weekly special of Oyster BLT. As I savored my gumbo, she raved about this sandwich.  I couldn&#39;t stand it, so the next night I took my husband there, and we both ordered it.  Whoever came up with the idea of an oyster BLT should get a bonus!  The flavors of the oysters with bacon and the chipotle mayo they put on it were spectacular! Add the freshness and crunchiness of lettuce and tomatoes, and it was a great sandwich!
In fact, we enjoyed it so much that we went back 2 days later for lunch to have it once more before the week was up.  So if you happen to be there when the Oyster BLT is on the menu, get it!"

When enterring, I felt as if I was going into a pub in England.   People playing cards, nice people behind the bar who greeted us as we came in and a great atmosphere.

Weird, right? Who goes to an ale house in yoga pants after an outdoor yoga session? Oh, that&#39;s right - pretty much any Seattleite (it sure is nice to visit a city where fitness and comfort trump &#34;the scene&#34;).

Our waitress, Emily, was so sweet, and took really great care of us. I realize a large majority of these reviews center around &#34;stumbling in&#34; or &#34;being a great drinking establishment,&#34; but it&#39;s also a great idea to come to Hilltop for a casual, local lunch that&#39;s actually tasty, satisfying, and affordable.

They have some good wine and beer specials, and all &#34;the good stuff&#34; on tap, so you won&#39;t be disappointed. I just stuck with the victuals (or vittles, if you will) while I was there, and they were good eats! I started with the Sausage Gumbo in a cup, which was hearty and sated me just enough without ruining my appetite. The gumbo wasn&#39;t overpowered by rice, and had satisfying chunks of sausage, and some delicious pickled okra. It&#39;s served with two slices of sourdough bread - don&#39;t overlook this bread as just another sad side of white bread, as it&#39;s that fantastic San Francisco sourdough. My entree was the Mediterranean Steak Salad - I loved how the steak was thinly sliced and cooked medium rare, served cold, atop the delicious greens and accoutrements such as red peppers, chick peas, banana peppers, and cucumbers. The (I&#39;m guessing homemade) Greek Vinaigrette dressing it good, but I&#39;m glad I ordered it on the side, as it was very thick and rich. You can also opt for feta and red onions if you like.

One of my friends opted for my second choice, which was a Green Chile Tuna Melt, and it&#39;s served on that TDF (to-die-for) sourdough. The third girl in our group chose the goat cheese salad, which she finished every last bite - the oven-baked goat cheese medallions looked so good, and the portion just right!

Definitely check this place out if you&#39;re looking for a surprisingly good pub lunch to go with your pints!"

I can pop in, grab a beer, and the wait staff is always friendly and courteous.

The last couple times I&#39;ve come here, my husband and I were able to snag a table outside (1 of 2) and we were happily sipping away our local brews and eating delicious food.  I&#39;m particularly fond of the chicken sandwich, which is satiating and hits the spot after a long work week.  

It&#39;s fun hanging out in front of it, watching all the people wander along Queen Anne Avenue to find the next hot spot to hit up.  This place is a relaxing joint:  not snobby or dirty, it is the perfect middle.  

It&#39;s near the upper Queen Anne Starbucks, so that is always entertaining people watching if you&#39;re outside.
Primarily, it is the best hole in the wall that traditional Queen Anne Avenue has to offer.

The place is usually busy, and with good reason. The food is delicious, though the service could stand to improve a bit (mostly due to a shortage of staff, 1-2 servers, when the place is packed). It&#39;s a little slow. I will say, though, that we had a party of 6 come in for lunch on a busy day and the server kindly and promptly split the bill 6 ways without complaint. I tipped extra for that, as it&#39;s rare for a server to be so accommodating during the lunch rush and keep a smile on their face.

I always get the steak sandwich with a caesar salad as the side. The steak sandwich is delicious - flavorful steak, crunchy bread, spicy pico, gooey cheese, creamy sauce. It&#39;s perfection, and it&#39;s not available at any other ale houses in the chain. I would drive out of my way just to come to this particular ale house for the steak sandwich. 

The caesar salad is delicious - perfectly dressed, ample portion, lemon wedge and parmesan cheese sprinkles."

My opinion both times was &#34;Meh.&#34; 

Few vegetarian options. The salmon sandwich was all right, I guess. SO was equally &#34;meh&#34; on the chicken dishes. Everything felt really heavy and greasy and not in a good, satisfying way. The server on our first visit was very impatient and I felt pressured and anxious. On our second visit, service was okay but we were often ignored for extended periods.

It does feel like an English pub, I s&#39;pose. It feels like a good place for a large group of people who enjoy sportsball."

All three in my party got beers and all really enjoyed them.  I tried the Pacemaker Porter and thought it was delicious.

Two of us got the sandwiches (one went with the Reuben and the other the salmon) and thought they were really good.  The Reuben is delicious, plentiful, and came with pasta salad.  I had the hot and spicy gumbo and it was indeed hot and spicy.  The bowl was filling and delicious but make sure you do like your heat.

I had a Groupon so I came here with the boyfriend.  We aren&#39;t big drinkers so we passed on the beer.  However, we both tried weekly specials.  I got the bangkok chicken salad and he got the beef pot pie.

The salad sauce was surprisingly really tasty.  It was somewhat sweet, like the peanut sauce they use in Thai places.  They sprinked wonton skins and peanuts all over the salad.  Unfortunately they used plain iceberg lettuce for the salad, and I would have prefered romaine or mesclun... since the salad regular price was $14!

The pot pie was okay.  They should have mixed the contents of the pot pie or something, because the top layer did not have that much flavor!  The bottom was very rich and tasty.  The pot pie is pretty smal though and served with a giant salad.

The server was pretty friendly and had no issues with the Groupon.

We got there at 8pm on Saturday and it was already super packed.  We had a group of about 10 people and there were no tables to sit at so we sat in this corner with barstools and asked the waitress to let us know if anything looks like it&#39;s moving.  She didn&#39;t.  But we eventually got something on our own.

The beer was OK - I was disappointed that they didn&#39;t have any Hefeweizen or other wheat beers on tap.  They did have a very tasty cider on tap though and a lot of places don&#39;t do ciders so I was good with that.

We had the hummas (OK) and garlic bread (good) as finger foods to eat throughout the night.  We would come back for the &#34;best Ruben in Seattle&#34; but didn&#39;t get to try it then.

The quesadilla was grilled and filled with chicken, Monterey Jack cheese and cilantro pesto,and served with a small greens salad tossed in a chipotle vinaigrette. The salad was light, and not over dressed. The quesadilla was crunchy and had just the right amount of bite.

I usually get the Reuben, which I do feel is most often among the best I&#39;ve had.  One time, it was less than stellar, so they do have some consistency issues (but, it&#39;s a pub for freak&#39;s sake).

The Reuben comes on delicious and most often perfectly toasted Rye bread and consists of medium slices of Boar&#39;s Head corned beef which have been house-braised in hard cider, pickled red cabbage, melted Swiss cheese, a thousand-island-type aioli and something that gives it a little heat (I think it may be in the aioli).  It&#39;s crunchy, tangy, spicy, and creamy at the same time -- just lovely.  It also comes with pepperoncini if you want to make it spicier and tangier.  The chips are Tim&#39;s and they&#39;re fine. My foodie friend from Napa Valley also agreed that this sandwich was fantastic.  However, I do tend to agree that the prices here are a bit aggressive, but apparently I don&#39;t mind too much.

Another friend had the tuna melt -- again very good, with perfectly toasted bread (sourdough) and tuna that wasn&#39;t smothered in mayo and spiced-up with roasted green chiles and pepperjack cheese.  Flavorful and great texture.

My husband had the &#34;fish&#34; tacos -- it was one giant flour tortilla folded over and filled with spiced-up bay shrimp, slaw and cilantro.  Just okay according to him.

The atmosphere is standard cute pub.  It&#39;s pretty narrow in the front (there&#39;s a back room I&#39;ve been in) -- so with our party of 6 we were either relegated to the back room or the very back of the front room.  For some inexplicable reason there wasn&#39;t a way to combine any of the other tables in the front -- the bartender mumbled something unintelligible when I asked about this ... other than that, the service was fine but nothing special.

This is by no means a gastropub -- it&#39;s a straight up pub with some decent beer selections and good but not outstanding or creative food.  Perfect place to ride out a weekend hangover ..."

The beer selection is pretty stagnant- pretty much hasn&#39;t changed in the 3 years I&#39;ve been going there. They need to get some new brews.

Sadly, they&#39;ve discontinued their grilled ahi sandwich (I&#39;m told the tuna was getting to pricey).   The fish tacos and reuben are good too, and they have a good selection of beers.   The stews and soups come with various names, but pretty much all taste the same - some folks like them, some don&#39;t (I&#39;m not a fan).  Sandwiches are served with potato chips (Tim&#39;s?) or tabouleh.

I go back for the steak sandwich again and again - it has a southwest seasoning and a flavorful aiole on a nice crisp baguette."

From servers who not only remember your name/drink, but also keep your snow sled in the back room for a week after you drunkingly leave it in the middle of the pub after sledding down the counterbalance in the winter - to their fantastic beer selection. Good ol&#39; standbys like Deschutes Mirror Pond and Georgetown Manny&#39;s, to my favorite IPA&#39;s in the form of Boundary Bay and Ninkasi. Not to mention a constant rotation tap that never fails to disappoint. They also recently added a full liquor menu, so get your drink on that way if it pleases you.

Is it small? Yes, that is what she said. That would also be what the architect of the Hilltop also said when he/she/it built the place. It can be right packed on the weekends. The biggest table available is a spot capable of dropping yourself and seven other friends located in the back room. Everything else = two tops for romantic bro dates, four tops for family dinners (minus the family) and bar seating. Outside, a mere two tables are situated - though the window seats offer a not too shabby location for people watching.

Food has never been bad. Slightly overpriced for what it is, but always tasty. Take advantage of the cioppino if they have it on special. Burgers, salads, fish tacos - also good selections available all day, every day.

In the end, this is the place me and the homies will go for a QP (quick pint, which ALWAYS turns in to two, three, four...) after a hard day of making that paper. Now if only they stayed open a bit later on the weekdays.

Cheers..."

I should end the review there. 

However, I will go on! Chill place to grab lunch and a beer or two. The staff are friendly (if a bit slow at times) - like super-personable in an authentic, relaxed way. The bar is along the lines of a local pub, pretense dropped and lots of wood. I haven&#39;t been to the other locations but I&#39;ve heard similar and if they&#39;re striving to be a neighborhood watering hole at each location I&#39;d say they&#39;ve at least found it for Queen Anne.

The beer selection is fine (just the right size, not threateningly large nor sadly small) with good seasonal rotation (and cider for when you want it on a fall day).

The sides are nothing really to write home about, with some slightly amped up options on the cashews and good-quality potato chips.  The reuben however was a w e s o m e (best I&#39;ve had in Seattle so far).

Prices are fine, the quality is good, and the feel is awesome."

It&#39;s your everyday pub inside -- so I like it. Small tables, long bar, dimly lit, some game or something on in the corner, brew news mags distributed throughout. It is my kind of laid back neighborhood joint.  The after work crowd seems to fill this place up, but a seat at the bar shouldn&#39;t be TOO hard to come by. 

Pretty nice tap list -- interesting imports, higher quality local brews, and they are a couple bucks off during HH. Maybe i&#39;ll try the food, but really all I need is a pint and a window seat here at Hilltop and im more than happy."

Atmosphere: Cramped and causal pretty much sums up Hilltop Alehouse. They do have a good number or monitors for you sports fans. There&#39;s also additional seating in the backroom. You have to walk past the kitchen and restrooms to find it, but it does have a fireplace!

Price: Yes, it is not the cheapest place in Queen Anne, (if you&#39;re looking for that go to Targy&#39;s) but the food and atmosphere are worth the price.  

Drinks: Their tap is not as diverse as some should hope, but what they do have does not leave me wanting. If you&#39;re an IPA fan the Boundary Bay IPA is especially hoppy and tasty. They do serve little half pints so take advantage of that if you don&#39;t feel like a full brew. 

Don&#39;t miss: 
The Reuben: Yes, all the reviews you have read about the Reuben are true - it&#39;s a rich, crispy, flavorful delight! The toasted rye bread is the perfect foundation to hold the juicy corn beef, topped with pickled cabbage, Swiss cheese, and Thousand Island dressing. If you&#39;re picky about your bread being too crunchy, then I&#39;d ask for plain break or go with another sandwich. To mix up the side request half pasta salad and half chips. 

Blackened Salmon Sandwich: This is my &#39;go-to&#39; choice when a good meal is needed. The salmon is perfectly cooked to Northwest standards and served on a French baguette with your standard mayo, lettuce, and tomato. The salmon is blackened so it is a bit spicy, but nothing the average person couldn&#39;t handle.   

Could go without:
Fish tacos: While good intentioned the fish tacos are bland and have a poor follow through. The texture is pretty much all soft and leaves you saying, &#34;meh.&#34; Melena&#39;s Tacos on McGraw has better fish tacos (cheaper as well).

Chicken Pot Pie (specialty item): I wanted to like this because I love chicken pot pie, but the base of the pie was broth not cream or milk. It&#39;s hard to get into a soupy thin based chicken pot pie; this was more like a stew with tomato... yes, tomato. Overall, just don&#39;t order this meal.

If you&#39;re in the area you should try this place at least one time."

They do have a nice beer selection but I would really like it more if they rotated their taps more often.

I totally agree with Laura S. that it is a destination dish! Their menu describes it as:  &#34;Lightly  breaded, boneless breast of chicken, seared in garlic olive oil, then topped with Mozzarella cheese and baked in the oven. Served on toasted rye bread with cream cheese, sliced tomatoes, sliced red onions, mayo and lettuce.&#34;  It&#39;s also a very good deal for $10.95. Get it with a side tabouli instead of potato chips. The gumbo, blackened salmon sandwich and pesto chicken quesadilla are damn fine too!

They have an array of great beers on tap and are served in true Imperial pint glasses. These are 20 oz glasses that are the standard you would find in your typical English pub. US pint glasses are 16 oz. The obvious difference other than size is highlighted by the bulbous bulge near the top of the Imperial pint.

I may be mistaken, but I seem to remember this place used to house Queen Anne hobby way back when.

UPDATE:  07/25/07

Had a late dinner here after catching a sneak preview of Sunshine.  I tried one of their sandwich specials:  Caribbean Pork Loin Sandwich.  This sucker was crazy tasty!  It&#39;s slow roasted pork loin that&#39;s rubbed with Ancho chili, allspice and black pepper, sliced and marinated in orange juice, cilantro, habanero, green onion, garlic and fresh basil.  Grilled and piled on baguette with caramelized onions, mayo, lettuce and cilantro.  Served with a side salad with honey mustard/chipotle dressing.  It&#39;s a little pricey at $13.75, but it&#39;s worth it!

Service is usually good and efficient. They close at 11pm on weekdays, and midnight Friday &amp; Saturday, so you may have to have a backup if you want to party all night. 

Dinner: Good, not amazing, and a little overpriced for pub food. I also asked for no cheese or cream cheese on my chicken sandwich, and it arrived with cheese. Between the two mozzarella is the one that can be picked off so I didn&#39;t complain, but still. I substituted the Tobouleh for a Caesar salad and that was about $4 extra!

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food is quite good, but it is not as good as the price tag they slap on it.

In my first visit, I was in the mood for something light, so I ordered the soup and salad combo with gumbo. And while I expected a soup and a salad, what I got was soup and about a half a salad - for $12. So strike one: ridiculously overpriced entree combo.

On my second visit, I first sampled the happy hour chicken strips, which though tasty, were pretty overdone. The exterior was overcooked, so they might have been in the pan a couple minutes too long. When I ordered my entree, I was hit with sticker shock again. 

While I can justify $12 for a reuben sandwich, I can&#39;t if it only comes with chips. I don&#39;t care if they&#39;re handmade - or made by cartoon elves in a treehouse kitchen - they&#39;re still chips. So I want a salad instead? An extra $3. Now we&#39;re talking $15 for a sanwich and a side salad? That&#39;s way too much in my opinion. Was the sandwich good? Yes, but was it the best ever? Nah.

My other complaint, which is to be expected of the type of place, is that the bartenders spend too much time chatting up the locals and not enough time paying attention to empty glasses on the bar. The price you pay for it having a neighborhood feel though."

My husband and I got to Hilltop periodically b/c the food and beer are reliably good, as they were once again last night.  But the service stunk.

OK I know it was St. Patrick&#39;s Day - a long, tough day for the waitstaff but I don&#39;t think that is any reason for our waitress to embody the dreaded combo of forgetful, inattentive and surly. 

She gave me the wrong drink. How about apologizing when I politely point that out, rather than scowling and removing it? We asked for water and 15 minutes went by. Could she have made eye contact, told us she&#39;s slammed, and would have it to us in a few minutes rather than rushing by, obviously ignoring us, and scowling? We asked for the check and offered a credit card, could she have asked how everything was and thanked us rather than just grabbing the card and scowling? Note the common theme of scowling - it&#39;s not accidental. 

Will we go back to Hilltop? Absolutely. Our corned beef and guinness beef pot pie were great, and despite being St. Pat&#39;s day with soccer on the tube, the crowd was jolly but respectful (and generally older than 22). But we sure won&#39;t sit in Angela&#39;s section."

We sat at the bar a couple minutes before happy hour ended.  Waitress waited 10 min to come by, so we missed happy hour.  Beer was hastily poured and placed in front of me so quickly that the foamy head ran over the side, creating a puddle on the bar.  She walks away, and I have to ask her for a rag to clean up the beer lake in front of me.  We finished our drinks and asked for our tab, no desire for a second round here.  I gave her my card to pay, and she goes to run it.  After she swipes my card, she walks off to chat up customers (not pouring drinks or taking orders, just chewing the fat with the regulars I guess).  After another 5+ minutes I have to ask her again for the tab.  I don&#39;t wanna sound like a complainer, but I can&#39;t seem to talk about this place without complaining."

The place is quaint and appealing, but the layout could stand to be revisited by someone who has a better idea of feng shui or at least traffic patterns. I felt like I was running an obstacle course while trying to get to the bathroom between dodging backs of chairs, elbows and other people heading the opposite direction; this place needs a hall monitor, like in grade school with a sash and everything. While Hilltop is wheelchair accessible, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it just because of the reason I just mentioned. I had to shimmy around folks and I&#39;m not wheelchair bound; I could just see it being a royal pain trying to get through the place if I were in one.

While perusing the menu I noticed that their reuben sandwich was &#34;Seattle&#39;s Best Ruben&#34; so the decision on what to eat was predetermined for me; I must try (apparently) &#34;Seattle&#39;s Best Ruben.&#34; The choice of sides were a little weird and took me a back. There was either a couscous concoction (I don&#39;t remember the name, something fancy-sounding) or a bag of Tim&#39;s Cascade Chips (plain chips btw; had they had sea salt and vinegar I&#39;d have been all over it). Which for a $12.95 order I would have hoped for something more interesting than a couscous salad or a bag of chips; maybe they would take my SubClub card so I can add some points to it as well!

After getting about half-way through the couscous (they dump a pretty healthy amount on the plate) I started to get overwhelmed by something in it and actually felt a tad nauseous. Which just left me with the remainder of my sandwich to finish off as well as the rest of the pitcher we had ordered.

My co-pilot ordered their chicken sandwich which was incredible from the bite I had of it. The chicken was moist and delicious, just how I like it. Although she too felt the couscous salad was a bit overwhelming and ended up leaving most of hers on the plate. 

The ruben, while good, is not what I would call Seattle&#39;s best. My absolute favorite ruben (of all times) is the one that the lovely folks at Elliott Bay Brewery in West Seattle dish up. That thing is incredible. While everyone can strive for greatness, some things simply are not meant to be. Despite all of my drawings of rocket ships and aspirations as a lad, I never had the &#34;right stuff&#34; and have found myself Earthbound for the foreseeable future (side-note: that game is cool). I feel that the ruben at Hilltop; while good, does not have the &#34;right stuff&#34; and is going to have to rely on it&#39;s corned-beef filled imagination to paint it&#39;s own picture of traveling through the endless black of our universe alongside the greats like Armstrong, Adama and 6."

There are tables in the back that most people don&#39;t know about.  If the front is packed (which it usually is), head int he back and see if you can snag a table.

They have a good menu with the Gumbo being their staple.  It&#39;s good, but spicy- so beware.

I was impressed. Most ruben&#39;s I have had were sloppy, falling apart or in general half assed. This was none of the above. Tasty on toasted bread with great pasta salad on the side. Also being a fan of good beer I tried their rotating tap which happened to be an IPA which I can&#39;t remember the name of unfortunately but it was very good.

Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good beer and a good sandwich."

Personal favs are the Fullers ESB, the chicken sandwich, and the reuben.  I&#39;m pretty hooked on the potato chips, as well.

Good:
- Food is tasty
- Good beer selection, with some interesting choices and rotating tap
- 20oz pints
- Super comfy atmosphere
- Fast and friendly service

Bad:
- Tables are a bit too close together for when it gets busy, resulting in a crowded space

Neutral,FYI:
The atmosphere is cozy, casual, and unpretentious.  This is not a trendy, chic, or hip restaurant.  If you are looking for an impressive &#34;destination&#34; bar to wow a date or client, this probably isn&#39;t the place.  It&#39;s just the perfect neighborhood pub.  You won&#39;t find a singles scene or throbbing music, instead it&#39;s local folks having a nice meal and/or a few drinks with their friends and family."

Everything comes with tim&#39;s chips or pasta salad but try the pasta salad it is pesto and I always make the mistake of getting chips because I&#39;m not thinking straight.

No regrets. The Trouble sauce is mouth-watering: creamy, slightly sweet, and spicy.

Most of the brunch items are very good choices if you&#39;re here on the weekend. Otherwise, get a sandwich. I&#39;ve not been impressed with the nachos, hummus, quesadilla, or salads. Average bar food.

Waited for about 25 minutes before we got our sandwiches.  Everybody else&#39;s sandwiches looked fine, well, except for mine.  It was double wrapped in foil and sandwich paper. Lemma tell you one thing.  I love my sandwiches fresh.  When I get my sandwiches or burgers it&#39;s got to be fresh and eaten immediately.  No sauces, lettuce or tomatoes to sog up my bread while it&#39;s wrapped up in a to-go bag.

Back to my sandwich...It can double checked, bad sign, and when I unwrapped it I was highly disappointed to have the entire sandwich fall apart because the bread was just mushy and saturated from the juices of the beef and cooked vegetables.  The bread became a mushy texture that stuck to your fingers.  I bet my sandwich was the first to be made, wrapped and left on the counter until the other three sandwiches were prepped.  Highly disappointed.  I used a fork to eat the meat and veggies.

Would I come here again? Yes, but definitely go with something else!"

Here&#39;s a truth out-of-towners, it doesn&#39;t rain in Seattle as much as you&#39;ve been told and due to global warming it&#39;s just becoming nicer here. Still, outdoor dining it&#39;s not a prevalent thing and many restaurants close their patios in what they perceive is the cold time of year. Perhaps Smarty Pants closes their outdoor area in the wintry blustery months, but they are always good for the sunny days. 

I have had no problems with service here. It&#39;s a casual, laid back atmosphere where the waiters and waitresses are going to give you your space and let you go at your own pace. If you&#39;re expecting to be doted on you won&#39;t here. They have no issue with being flagged down or going into the bar to order another drink if the waitstaff is backed up, which they very well can be on especially warm days. They&#39;re not going to greet you upon entrance, they&#39;re most likely not even going to seat you. This place almost borders on an independent attitude or think of it like going to your favorite goth/grunge friend&#39;s garage for a drink and a sandwich. It&#39;s a very industrial ambiance with a dash of welcoming indifference. If you don&#39;t like employees in t-shirts who are tatted up with piercings every which way...well, you probably won&#39;t be happy eating in Georgetown. 

You may be thinking why should I eat here, and why do you like it? Well, because they immediately set the expectations. They are welcoming in that high comfort level sorta way - they aren&#39;t demanding, they don&#39;t hover, they let you go at your own pace which is really nice. They have a full bar with bartenders that don&#39;t skimp on the alcohol and that is greatly appreciated. 

And they are the king of sandwiches. I all sorts of love their sandwiches. Every sandwich comes with chips, potato salad, or slaw. I personally love their tortilla chips and salsa. It is just nice. Many of my co-workers go for the potato salad, but chips for me! I go for their grilled cheese sandwich. I typically order it straight up with just the cheese abandoning the tomato, avocado spread, and onions because I like classic grilled cheese and they never disappoint. They also don&#39;t get all judgy when I order that way, which most places actually do. But they offer an amazing selection of sandwiches that any sandwich lover will find something scrumptious to eat."

Passed by a million times but never got the change to check it out. Ordered the Gringa and a vodka tonic and was very surprised with the sandwich. Very flavorful with just the right amount of seasoning. The potato salad was bland as wood and I should have ordered the chili as it looked delicious with cheese and green onions. My only major gripe is the booze. Ordered vodka and tonic and there was about three drops of vodka. I understand that booze is expensive but don&#39;t short the customer.

Sandwiches are pretty top notch.   Messy, flavorful,  good bread and ingredients.   I got the Troublemaker which had a perfectly spicy sauce that has me wanting to come back for more.   If I had one piece of constructive criticism, it&#39;s that this sandwich doesn&#39;t need lettuce.   It just gets soggy because of the other components.   Maybe replace it with something else that maintains crunch a bit better.   That&#39;s just the chef side of me talking.   I&#39;ll definitely be back for the food,  beers and good time ambiance."

The owners are from Chicago, and maybe that colors my judgment a bit, but it also inspires some of their menu items. I went with the french dip, which was utterly, surprisingly delicious.

The Chicago Italian Beef sandwich was okay.  I&#39;d like to say it was good, but really, it was lacking in flavor.  It was moist, and had the pickled vegetables, and whatnot.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s not worth writing home about.  It was a decent size, and I didn&#39;t leave hungry.

The chips and salsa side was disappointing.  The salsa came in a little paper cup, and was hard to manage, and there really wasn&#39;t enough of it for the chips.  The chips weren&#39;t bad, but seemed like they came out of a bag.

I believe my cohorts fared better than I.  One said the meatball sandwich was tasty, and the other had the Troublemaker and was impressed with it.  Both had the potato salad, and said it was good."

First time I went because I had been working at a coffee shop in Georgtown. I was really hungry but all I wanted as a really good turkey sandwich. I found this place mostly because I saw someone on the street shouting to a friend &#34;This place is fucking good!&#34; So with an endorsement like that, how could I not try it. Got a couple of beers and a turkey sandwich which was really good. They didn&#39;t have fries which was a little sad, but it wasn&#39;t like they were out, the sandwich just comes with chips, or coleslaw, or some other side I can&#39;t remember just at the moment and I didn&#39;t really want fries anyway. The sandwich came out and was really good. I drake my beer, ordered another, then ordered some fries because I wanted to sit and watch people for a bit. The bar is motorcycle focused, which is not to say a biker bar. It&#39;s really into motercycle racing, so I people watched a bit. Most of the crowd was nice and talkative but didn&#39;t mind ignoring the guy with the book in the back picking through his fries. 

Recently I came back with my boyfriend. He had been talking about wanting a Chicken Parmesan Sandwich for a week and I remembered that they had one here called the Thunderbird. He got that and I got the Chicago Italian Beef. Both were just awesome! Great taste, great bread! All of it. I&#39;d totally go back."

Their outdoor area is open and welcoming and there is one fire pit that you can sit around. Other seating options are long picnic style tables that are casual but polished and nicer than the ones you would see at a park.

So what went wrong?
1. We waited over 30 minutes for two Bloody Marys.  We had forgotten that those were ordered.
2. We waited another half hour for 3 breakfast dishes.  The hash browns were hard and under seasoned. I had a chicken/cheese/egg dish, and without ketchup or hot sauce, it was bland.
3. My sister&#39;s omelet was barely warm, and the cheese on top looked like it was sprinkled on top at the last minute.  So after an hour wait, she either got something that had been sitting on the counter for awhile, or somehow that wasn&#39;t cooked all the way?

I work nearby and come here often for lunch. The food is good- great sandwiches and salads (love the Chopper Salad). The restaurant is very Georgetown themed and they also have a nice outdoor patio area. 

Now comes the reason I am giving them one star (would give 0 if that was a choice). The SERVICE was HORRIBLE that it ruined the entire meal and my Friday luncheon out. I came with a friend and we were seated out in the patio. Our server MELISSA was rude and intentionally ignoring us from the moment we were seated. I have never experienced such blatant rudeness, especially from a server at a restaurant who&#39;s core job is to serve their customers. By the end of the meal, we could not believe what happened, MELISSA&#39;s rude behavior and treatment, which consistently continued all the way through- let me explain.

Offense #1: After being seated, I asked Melissa if we can place our order as I had limited time for lunch due to meetings. She replies that she will get to me after she goes around to everyone else who were already seated, walks off, and takes her time slowly with the other tables and making friendly conversation. Then she proceeds to walk around and refill water, making sure to not look in our direction and basically ignoring us. Finally when she comes back, she asks what we want and walks off- no friendly conversation or apologies for the wait. 

Offense #2: My friend wanted to ask Melissa if they can put the BBQ sauce for her sandwich on the side after we placed our order. Melissa was right next to our table and my friend only got to say &#34;can I ask&#34; before Melissa responded with &#34;I am busy right now I will come back to you&#34;. She did not even let my friend finish her sentence and cut her off. Are you serious?!? Melissa never got back to her and never came by our table until the end of the meal to deliver the check. Melissa did walk around and checked on all the other tables around us throughout our lunch but she never once came by our table to ask how we are doing, if we needed anything, which we did. Another server brought our food out and she was great and did ask.

Offense #3: Now Melissa is walking around with checks for a few tables and being seated in close proximity, we can hear her conversations. She laughs, smiles, and is friendly and polite in giving the other tables their checks, telling them thanks and wishing them a good rest of the afternoon. Now she gets to our table and she just drops off the check- that&#39;s it. No thanks for stopping by, have a nice day, nothing. Also, we gave her 2 credit cards so she can charge our orders separately. I tried to ask her and was cut off with her response of &#34;well, I don&#39;t know your names&#34; when I was proceeding to show her the 2 cards and what to charge to which. Usually the response to splitting a bill is &#34;what do I charge to which card?&#34; or &#34;how would you like to split it?&#34;.

We were not sure if she was just having a bad day and to let it go, but that was the final offense that made it clear she just had an issue with us. I am a young, professional, Asian-American women, and my friend is Indian-American (the other tables were not as &#34;diverse&#34;). Did we just experience discrimination?? I am not one to pull out the race card or see and think I am being treated differently because of who I am. I certainly did not expect this to happen in Seattle, in 2015, at my local luncheon spot that I enjoy and recommend to people."

We ordered numerous things but this narrative revolves around the eggs - over medium.  

When the plate came the first time, the eggs were fried into a hard disc that you could pick up with your fingers and spin around.  Picture attached.  The server agreed and said he would be back with another order.

The order that came next was basically raw.  Photo attached.

The server came and looked at them and then offered some personal opinion on the chef.  I declined to have more eggs cooked.

Later, we heard someone behind us ordering eggs over medium.  I chuckled.  That poor bastard has no idea what&#39;s in store for him!  Then I hear the server tell him that he can&#39;t have eggs that way.  That the cook cannot prepare them.  The over-medium-egg-seeking citizen pointed out that is an accepted method of preparation, but I think went with something else in the end.

The server was nice and did discount my meal.

I love the deck!  A pleasant place to wile away an afternoon while people bring you tasty beverages. The Frito Pie is inspired.  Always ask for extra Fritos."

I love me some G-town places pretty hard, so my hopes are always high when I go to a new establishment there.  Smarty Pants didn&#39;t disappoint.  

First, the food:

I had their Club Pants sandwich with potato salad.  It was SO tasty!  The portion is generous, especially for the price, and the avocado spread they slather on it is divine.  The bread was perfectly toasted, and the turkey they put on the sandwich was super good.  I was pretty sad that I could only finish half of it.  The potato salad was also great.  Again, after spending time in the South, I am picky about some side items like mac and cheese, potato salad, and slaw.  I was really impressed with the potato salad; I won&#39;t say that I licked the container it came in when I finished it, but I also won&#39;t say that I didn&#39;t lick the container it came in when I finished it.  

Service: 

Awesome!  Other than staffing the place with people that are just fun peeps, they were super fast and attentive.  My glass stayed full, and my food and bill came to me quickly.  No complaints here!

I plan on returning soon for happy hour; the menu looked awesome.

This place should change their name to Genius Pants; excellent experience here!"

I&#39;ve had their French dip before and it was pretty great (previously a non-menu special item ), but THIS time it was on the menu so I ordered it again. The French roll was soft, cut perfectly and didn&#39;t disintegrate in the au jus. It had the perfect ratio of horseradish, swiss cheese, and caramelized onions. The roast beef was flavorful and tender. The au jus wasn&#39;t too salty or too watery. I highly recommend you try the French Dip."

Their menu is extensively huge.  I would guess that they have at least 20 sandwich choices, plus a large selection of breakfast/brunch choices.

I love their potato salad, and the homemade giardiniera that comes on some of their sandwiches should be sold in 5 gallon buckets!

I had ordered an extra sandwich for take out. Big mistake. 
The cost listed on my bill for a TAKE OUT BOX is $0.50. I know it&#39;s cheap, but it&#39;s the principal of it all.  A grocery store charges $0.05 for a bag, and it&#39;s half a buck for a box that cost  about a dime? Can way say &#34;profit&#34;? Sorry, but costs like this needs to be assumed by the restaurant, NOT passed on to restaurant patrons. There was no sign they would charge for a take out box (if there was, I didn&#39;t see it).

So I am expected to eat ALL of it in the restaurant or not take home extras or to-go? No wonder why &#34;Americans are fat&#34; Eat two-three servings per meal.
I wouldn&#39;t blink an eye if they upped the price of everything by a nickel to cover for the a cost of a take out box from a restaurant.

There aren&#39;t many options in Georgetown and Smarty Pants is one of them.  It&#39;s a decent spot, though I (perhaps arbitrarily) usually prefer 9 Lb Hammer.  The patio is nice, in fact I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever really hung out inside.  It&#39;s covered and there&#39;s a fire pit of sorts so this is an all-season patio*.  The menu is mostly sandwiches and a few salads and appetizers.  The hummus appetizer is surprisingly tasty and enough food that I had it for dinner once.  I wanted to show my boyfriend Georgetown on our last trip to Seattle so we had dinner and drinks at Smarty Pants.  What prompted me to finally review this place was the somewhat strange experience we had with the waitress.  My friend and I decided to split a sandwich.  I asked if it was toasted, since I wanted to take the cheese off.  My friend asked if the coleslaw (side option) was very mayo-y.  The waitress told me that the sandwich was NOT toasted and she told my friend that that coleslaw was NOT very mayo-y.  So we get our food and lo and behold, the sandwich was indeed toasted and the coleslaw sat in a puddle of mayonnaise.  The sandwich wasn&#39;t too cheesy so I ate it anyways, and I personally thought the coleslaw was just fine.  But, either the waitress wasn&#39;t familiar with the menu and made up answers, or she was familiar with the menu and lied to us.  Either way, not the best service experience.  I guess you should stick with drinks if you have any questions about the menu at Smarty Pants.  Who knows what they&#39;ll tell you.

*Boy do I miss Seattle.  There&#39;s no such thing in MN, where I live now, and where you can literally use your porch as a second freezer during the winter.  In fact, it will soon be much, much colder than a freezer.  Why does anyone live here?!?!"

Smarty Pants is the kind of &#39;dive&#39; I like.  They&#39;re a great place to stop in for a sandwich and a couple of beers.  The beer selection isn&#39;t huge, but they do always have at least a couple of local micro-brews on tap, as well as PBR for those who want it.  Full bar as well, but so far I&#39;ve stuck with beer.  

The sandwich menu at Smarty Pants is extensive, with more than 20 different sandwiches to chose from.  Most of the sandwich choices seem to be a good value for what you get (they&#39;re quite large), but I&#39;d balk a bit at paying $8 for an egg salad sandwich or $9.50 for a tuna salad sandwich.  The happy hour menu has a few good valued choices as well.  

They also have some good, basic appetizers (Chips &amp; Salsa, Quesadilla, hummus, etc.), soups and salads.  So far, I&#39;ve stuck with just sandwiches - and been happy with each one (I&#39;ve had: Firecracker, Troublemaker, Miss Piggy and the Chickenhawk).  They serve a full brunch on Saturdays &amp; Sundays from 9 AM to 4 PM as well, but I haven&#39;t had breakfast there yet.  I&#39;ll have to go soon and update this review or write another one.

They did and both were so incredibly disappointed and grossed out by the chili.  It was so chunky and had a really odd taste/flavor to it.  I ordered a sandwich which was just okay and a side of the vegetarian chili for an extra $2.75.  I took one bite of the chili and it was so spicy I knew I wouldn&#39;t be able to eat it.  Others in our group tried it and they too thought it was incredibly spicy and inedible.  I told the waitress that it was too spicy and that I couldn&#39;t eat it and she said, &#34;oh.&#34;  That was it.  She could care less about trying to improve that situation or taking it off our bill.  When we got to the bottom of the glass of beer it became clear that the glass was dirty.

We can either go down to South Center or go up to Georgetown. There are not a lot of options around the office. I thought my manager picked a nice area to have lunch because that&#39;s the area I may never go by myself. Yes, not quite ghetto, but it&#39;s very industrial. 

Smarty Pants! I saw a lot of my Yelp fellows checked in there. I would never know they serve lunch. I just thought it&#39;s a bar where people drink and watch sports. Not sure how to categorize this bar, maybe a dive bar, maybe a biker bar? 

I ordered a philly sandwich for my lunch. I really liked the grilled onions and green peppers. However, I feel the bread can be a little smaller so that I wouldn&#39;t feel there wasn&#39;t enough meat. Overall, I thought it&#39;s a good sandwich. I paid $12 with tips. 

Our goal is to eat in Georgetown and try all the restaurants in the future. I am sure we will come back have different things on the menu."

I sat down ordered a beer and asked if i could get something to eat? they ask the main guy in the kitchen and he said sure no problem. What would you like?

It did take us an awkward few minutes to be seated.. and yes, it was awkward as no one greeted us, and didn&#39;t talk to us until we stood there for a while, not sure if we were to be seated ourselves or wait. And it seems you seat yourself.

We quickly got menus, and they seemed to rush us to order because we ordered in less than 5 minutes, which is a record for me because I love to take my time to order. But it doesn&#39;t matter too much cuz I was satisfied!

We got the sandwich sampler and ordered the Miss Piggy, the Trouble Maker and the Falcone. IDK why the Falcone isn&#39;t on the menu on the website but it is sure damn good. I think that is the one that was my favorite. 

Let me say that all the subs, were so damn good. Juicy, tender and had the right amount of creamy dressing to it, and the bread was toasted but soft too. I absolutely loved the bread. I think my favorite was the Falcone because it was the juiciest and had the most flavor. The Trouble maker was goood too. I think this is the one with italian herbs b/c my friend didn&#39;t like it. Ms. Piggy was definitely good. I&#39;m not a big fan of pulled pork, but this was hella bomb. I&#39;m salivating thinking about it, haha.

We also ordered the chilli con queso that was served with nacho chips. It was definitely cheesy, which I didn&#39;t even think about. It was good though. They said it had meat in it, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it did. Either way, it was good. Very cheesy. Nice beans, and tomatoes to the mixture which I loved. I would definitely order it again... but I wouldn&#39;t eat it all. It&#39;s a small cup, but to me, the cheese is overbearing because I&#39;m not a crazed cheese fanatic. But still good though. We killed it... we killed all the food. LOL.

So my friend and I split the tab in half after we ate and it came to about $6 a person. Pretty cheap and we were hella full after that. I&#39;m definitely coming back though. The sandwiches were too darn good!"

It wasn&#39;t super busy, and obeying the sign that said &#34;seat yourself&#34; I grabbed an empty table as I waited for my friend. No one came by, but I don&#39;t mind waiting, my lunch was leisurely after all.

In comes a man who sits down at the table next to me. The server IMMEDIATELY walks up to him with a menu and a water, and asks if he wants food. He says he has a friend coming but he&#39;d like a Manny&#39;s. I try to grab his attention but he doesn&#39;t even look at me. As I try to catch his eye, I see him get my neighbor&#39;s Manny&#39;s, another glass of water and another menu. I think, &#34;Great, he saw me.&#34; Instead he returns to my neighbor&#39;s table with the menu and water for his friend who hadn&#39;t even arrived yet, and I am still sitting at the very next table completely ignored. I raise my hand to indicate that I&#39;d like some service, but he acts utterly oblivious despite the fact that other customers have noticed me by now. Finally, when I am literally waving my arms in the air trying to grab this guys attention, he walks up to me and is like &#34;uh..yeah?&#34;.

It was the sandwich special of the evening -- so how could  resist?

This &#34;biker bar&#34; is surprisingly cozy -- friendly and warm service, nice patrons, and hey! Patio seating with fire pits in the table. Cool. We sat inside, ordered a Manny&#39;s (we were in Georgetown, duh!) and waited for our specials. 

The verdict? So damn close. My bread was nice and toasty, my au jus was actually rich and flavorful (with a delightful mystery herbal undertone), cheese was melted, and my roast beef warm. So my only complaint? My sandwich could have used more meat. MOAR! It was, sadly... more on the skimpy side of things,  CW&#39;s chili con queso was tasty -- pre-bagged chips but with a lovely warming cheese dip full of beans, peppers, and other spices. I enjoyed it and stole many a slathered tortilla chip.

It was a cold rainy night - no surprise there. But there were a couple tables in there dining still at around 6PM on a Tuesday night.  I asked the girl at the register what combos were the most popular and she said combo #1, 3, and 4.  Hubs got the #1, ironsteak $10.95 with added egg, and I got the sashimi grade salmon $12.95 and added cheese. Any additions are $1 each-- kinda steep for what you get and the amount.  

You order at the register, pay (don&#39;t forget the Yelp 10% off for checking in!!), then seat yourself.  The food came out quite promptly and was definitely sizzling.  I like my salmon medium rare so when I asked the girl how to keep it that way with the sizzling hot plate.  She ended up just  doing it for me -- placing the cooking salmon atop of my rice and telling me to keep it there until things cool to keep my salmon medium.  I thought it was a great idea but I realized that my rice would still also be cooking and getting very crispy underneath (crispy rice aka hardened and chewy rice, too..). 

So once I felt like things was not as hot, I mixed everything and put the sauces at the end (pineapple teriyaki all the way!  The hot sauce is not really hot/spicy and garlic soy is waaaaay too salty!).  My salmon ended up getting cooked at the way but at least it didn&#39;t cook so much that things were dried out.  You have to mix up everything and eat it.  Honestly, I was not that impressed with the dish.  Other than the sauces, I make this type of stuff at home frequently (I am Asian after all... rice is a staple!) just not with the hot skillet.  The amount of shredded cheddar cheese that was sprinkled on top did not justify the $1 imo.  

Combo #1 with the egg looked okay.  When everything was mixed, things looked very dry.  Mine looked super greasy though with all the cheese (but I rather eat it that way than dry).  Overall, I hope they offer other dishes that I could try bc I could see other people wanting to try this place and I would come along.  But I think I might return to try it again but in no hurry to.  The service was great, prompt, and very nice... But not my type of food.  When I go out, I want to eat things I definitely can&#39;t make at home. I really wanted to like this place a lot, it just didn&#39;t knock my socks off."

At Ironsteak the answer is &#34;yes you can&#34;.  The concept is simple.  Rice &amp; raw meat served in a piping hot cast iron pan with some side veggies (additional cost).  You cook the meat at the table and mix in sauces to your liking.  I ordered the rib eye and corn and added an egg for a dollar.  I mixed everything up and tried it with a few sauces, then all the sauces at the same time.  They had a garlic soy, pineapple teriyaki and chili sauce.  Honestly, I didn&#39;t think any of the sauces enhanced the flavor of the dish.  I felt it was better plain with a little pepper.  It somehow reminded me of risotto.   

The food is fresh, the meat is good quality (5 oz. of steak per order) and the portions are pretty big (lot&#39;s of rice), but it&#39;s really expensive for what you get.  $24 with a coke after tip.  I couldn&#39;t get over the idea that this was essentially the most expensive fried rice ever.  

The restaurant is immaculate and the server was very enthusiastic about explaining the menu and how to cook your meal.  In the end, I don&#39;t think the value is there, especially in the International District."

The prices are reasonable, the portions are huge, and the sauces on the table were great! I would totally come here again to, but I would choose the ribeye steak over the sirloin steak next time. The few extra dollars made a noticeable difference in the quality of the meat..."

And just waiting for everyone to eat their food with those delicious smells wafting through the air? It was torture! Since then, I&#39;ve been back twice on my own for delicious meals. 

My 5-star rating for this casual, delicious and hands-on restaurant is not meant to be compared against a Michelin star, &#34;splurge restaurant&#34; experience. I&#39;m also not judging based on authenticity. It&#39;s meant to be compared against other fast-casual dining experiences I&#39;ve had here in Seattle, and all around the U.S. And in my opinion, Ironsteak nails the fast-casual vibe with attention to detail, care in the ingredients they choose to use, taste, ability to customize, creativity, and uniqueness! 

I&#39;ve tried both the ribeye and the sirloin steak options--both were delicious and I loved the opportunity to cook the meat to my liking. I&#39;m an add-on gal, so I couldn&#39;t pass on adding mushrooms, broccoli, and of course, an egg! In case you haven&#39;t gotten the gist of things, they bring out a sizzlin&#39; hot, cast iron skillet packed with rice, protein (steak, salmon, chicken), veggies--whatever you want! You move the meat around to sear both sides, add some of their several sauces, mix the egg, rice and the rest of the mix-ins until you&#39;ve got what looks like a bomb fried rice dish. They even have some specials that include noodles instead of rice. It&#39;s not overly complicated--just simple, fresh ingredients. You can dress them up the way you want to. You can add pepper, hot sauce, whatever! 

I can eat a lot for my size, and both times I&#39;ve had to bring food home with me. As far as the price, I haven&#39;t had an issue, especially since both times I took a lunch portion home with me. The fancier the cuts of meat or fish you get, the higher the price tag. While the ribeye was my favorite cut of red meat, I enjoyed the cheaper, leaner sirloin option, too. The add-ons do add up, but you can choose more or less depending on how much you want to spend. 

A delicious, fun, healthy, casual way to eat. Ironsteak will definitely be a regular spot for me."

Looking at the reviews, it seems like this restaurant had a few kinks to work out when it first opened. So keeping expectations low and our fingers crossed, we swung by on a Wednesday evening.
Clean and quiet, Ironsteak was pretty empty at 5:30PM. The process is simple - you order up at the counter first and then seat yourself.  The girl at the counter was super helpful, asking if it was our first time there and offering suggestions.

We both opted for #1 - Sirloin Steak. I&#39;ve only had teppanyaki at Benihana, so it was kind of fun having a more &#34;personal&#34; experience with the food being served on the individual iron griddles. The #1 came with the steak, corn and rice, and I added an egg. Be sure to let your meat cook thoroughly, especially if you order chicken!

I&#39;d definitely say it&#39;s more about the experience of having a sizzling plate come out and cooking your food then and there. While the taste was pretty average, my friend and I had fun experimenting with the sauces on the table - our favorites were the garlic soy sauce and house chili sauce. We were also pleasantly surprised with how large the portion sizes were. :)

Even though the overall taste of the teppanyaki wasn&#39;t spectacular, I still think Ironsteak is worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area.  I&#39;m glad my friend and I came by to give this place a shot!"

I&#39;ve never had teppanyaki before, it was sort of like your own personal bennihana! They make it easy if it&#39;s your first time with plenty of instructions everywhere. 

You get your food extremely fast from walking in, we got our food within 10 minutes. I got the rib eye and it was surprising high quality, well marbled meat. My only regret is not getting an egg added :(

Another plus was the large Dragon Ball Z esque mural."

Very friendly service, decent food, fun concept.  

The key word is &#34;decent&#34;... food...  Not bad by any means but it wasn&#39;t life changing or anything and I thought it was pretty pricey for what it was.  

At the counter, they dont take tips.  I didnt have any cash on me so I couldnt leave any tips for my server.  Its one of those restaurants you pay when you order and then you go sit down.  Server greets you, brings you food, etc.  

I may give them one more try and check out another menu item."

Upon walking in, the interior and setup was really nice. I love the comic style wall in the back. Super cute and creative! And there was also a tv showing us how to eat our food. Lol. Ordering was super easy (just like a fast food order setting where you go up to the counter and order). The waitress there was nice and helpful and told us how everything worked. She even explained the menu items. 

Me and my gf ended up sharing one plate (Surf and Turf) just to try it out. And thank god we did. We ended up being disappointed by the bland taste of it and how easy it would be to make it ourselves. They had sauces too but they weren&#39;t really anything special. But my gf liked the sauces. :3 After we mixed everything, it just tasted like basic fried rice. We even added a fried egg in there. The portion was pretty good for two people though.

Overall, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the price."

Beef was gammy, and was not tasty at all. It didn&#39;t have its own flavor. (The three sauces they provide at your table did not help either.. none were very pleasing). 
Veggies are bland. no added spices. It seriuosly is.. adding some meat veggies rice on a hot plate.. with no extra seasonings whatsoever. If bland is what you&#39;re going for.. this place is the place for you.
During their opening week, we got to add a toping for free. I opted for the egg.. but instead of having a nice presentation of the egg in the middle of the rice or on the rice.. it basically took a big section of the plate where MEAT should&#39;ve been. 

I think MEAT is more desirable than Egg right now.. so I was not pleased. But then again.. the MEAT wasn&#39;t very tasty.. so i guess thats ok.

Will probably not be coming back."

The sauces were not something that I would come back for. I remembered there was there house soy sauce and some other pineapple teriyaki sauce. It&#39;s like an overpriced beef teriyaki meal to be honest. Didn&#39;t leave too big of impression and I probably wouldn&#39;t come back.

Had the surf n turf, ended up reserving judgement. Found out they&#39;ve tweaked their menu, so tried them again, #1 this time). Much better, at least 4.5 star:

- Meat portion increased somewhat. For an average appetite I walked away comfortably full. Some people might like the thicker cut before, but I&#39;m fine with it.
- Plate came seasoned and plenty hot. Not sure how sauces are tweaked but net effect is more flavor.
- Service is easy and friendly.

I have to sa, this place has some delicious food that is at a highly affordable price. As of now, I don&#39;t know a place where you can get an alantic salmon and sirloin steak combo for $9.95. An d it didn&#39;t taste cheap either. With the concept of Teppanyaki, all the food is cooked for you on a big grill, freshly lit with fire. But the food, here, is served in hot sizzling plates that are brought out to you. So, if you don&#39;t mind teppanyaki minus the cooking show, then you have to try this place out. It&#39;s good for small groups as well. I&#39;d go here for date as well :)  For me, the serving size was perfect. They have steak and salmon dishes galore and a veggie dish as well.

1. The quality of the meat was good.
2. The portion was pretty big for me.
3. The service was super nice!

However, as someone who loves Pepper Lunch, I wasn&#39;t really satisfied with the food. The sauce (butter?) on the rice didn&#39;t make any difference on the taste, and their yuzu teriyaki and garlic sauce weren&#39;t good. The garlic sauce didn&#39;t taste anything like garlic, and the yuzu teriyaki was closer to the yuzu side than to the teriyaki side. Also, they didn&#39;t provide salt only pepper was available on the table.

I really hope that one day, if I come back to this place, I can update my review with one more star. But well, let&#39;s see."

For those of you who&#39;ve visited Asia, this is basically a dupe of Pepper Lunch (same concept, menu items, and sauces). However, the food tasted really bland despite adding in the sauces. I think they&#39;re missing the butter/sauce that usually comes with the rice like Pepper Lunch does. I&#39;ll most likely come back in a couple months when they&#39;ve fixed up their recipes.

But it has now transformed into a teppan grill. I&#39;ve been to a couple other similar style food, usually they can be found in food courts in malls. So I gotta say I was kind of excited when they opened up one in the neighbourhood.

It was pretty quiet on a Friday afternoon. You order and pay up front first, then they had you a number and you sit. They have complementary water and an iced tea (tea is only served until 5pm).

The staff is very friendly. The prices are a bit high, but hey, it&#39;s a restaurant and not a food court. 

The three sauces are made in house, which is great. It&#39;s almost too bad that the rice doesn&#39;t get crispy like in bibimbap stone bowls

If your looking for a teppan experience go to Benihana. But for a casual lunch this place is great.  If yelp allowed half stars it would be more like 3 1/2stars. It&#39;s not terrible, which is saying a lot coming from me.

Since this was my first time here, I decided to go with the basic Ironsteak order which had slices of beef with rice, corn, and chopped green onions. I added on an Egg, Broccoli, Mushrroms, Bean Sprouts, Carrots, and Kimchi. With the add-on items, my meal for one came out to be around $15 which sounds pretty good to me. The food came out and was on an iron skillet where the meat was still cooking. I added all the sauces in to give it flavor since it did not look like there was flavor in it yet. They had Yuzu Garlic sauce, Hot sauce, and Pineapple Teriyaki sauce. The food wasn&#39;t too bad. I liked it.

The problem I had was that I felt like they gave very little meat and too much rice. I would&#39;ve liked it more if it was more balanced. The free water that they provide in their water dispenser was warm. I would&#39;ve liked it if that was chilled in ice.

So main complaints from this place: Not enough meat, too much rice, and water isn&#39;t cold.

Everything else was pretty good. I liked the decor. The service was helpful, friendly, and nice. Food was reasonably good as well as the price. I plan on trying this place out again and ordering the Kobe NY Steak because that just looks amazing. Price on that could be lower though."

Yes you heard that right. And that&#39;s not including side items you can add. We added side of kimchi and egg and they are $1 each item. So you do the math. Taste test = 2 stars for the dishes. The dishes was really bland and tasteless, now I know why there are 3 different sauces at the tables cause you&#39;d need to season your own dishes. Honestly even my steaks with a little bit of seasonings has more flavor then what was served to us. Last reason why the dishes itself deserved just 2 stars is because of the portion. It&#39;s really small. It actually did not hit the spot. I could&#39;ve finished 2 plates if it tastes better, oh and be sure to ask for your rice! They had forgotten mine and a couples sitting next to us. Service was mediocre at best like I mentioned before. It&#39;s mainly fast food style. There was no greetings nor thank you as you leave or enter the restaurant. And at the time of ordering if you ask for water the girl will point to the cooler and say over there self serve but they charge you for the bottle water. It&#39;s at the end that we noticed that there is an self serve water station. Overall I&#39;d give the place a 3 star cause I had to round up from 2.5 star. I don&#39;t have the heart to give them 2 star as they are new and still working on the kinks. Hopefully they&#39;ll do well."

Ironsteak serves their food -- rice with various toppings and sauce accompanied by some meat -- in a super hot iron skillet that cooks the food while you watch. Between ordering and receiving food the wait is very short. We got our food within about five minutes! Once the food arrives, you quickly toss the ingredients to cook them evenly on all sides. I ordered the curry sirloin with mushrooms and corn and it was amazing! The meat was incredibly tender and soft; among the best I&#39;ve had at any restaurant. There are variety of sauces on the table. I really like the spicy one. The iron skillet is surrounded by a paper ring to protect you from some of the spatter while it&#39;s cooking. One benefit of the hot skillet is that your meal stays warm the whole time, so your last bite is as delicious as the first. The restaurant is very clean and not crowded at all. We went on a Saturday night and didn&#39;t have to wait at all. I plan I&#39;m going back here as soon as I can! Sorry I don&#39;t have any pictures of the food. It smelled so good I inhaled it before remembering to take a photo! :)"

The girl that took our order was really nice and patient w/ me and my boyfriend even though we were taking forever to order so the service is pretty good! I got the #1 and he got the plate w/ salmon. I might have done something wrong, like seasoning after flipping the meat instead of before, but I thought my beef was very dry and bland, even after using all the sauces on the table. There was too much rice in comparison to the meat so I felt like I was just eating a plate of rice with some corn and kimchi, since I chose kimchi to add to it. My boyfriend said his plate was nothing special either."

I will definitely come back again. The food is unique, and the meat was delicious. I&#39;m a big fan of adding sauce, so seeing garlic soy and apple teriyaki was a huge bonus. Mixing the meat around to cook at your own desire was fun too. 

My only complaint was that the curry rice, for an extra $2, was pretty much some extra curry powder and a teeny tiny bit of curry. I really hope the portion of curry is changed, or I wouldn&#39;t order curry rice again.

Ps add an extra egg!"

I liked the concept and found the ingredients to taste good and fresh but this place is a solid 3 stars for me and no more. Few points which can be improved:
1. Bad value for price. The meat/fish and the add-on portions are small. After having a dinner here, I would have to go to one of the newly opened Hong Kong style dessert places to be &#34;full&#34;. I hope the management is able to increase the portion size for the price.
2. Pushy/suggestive management? On the opening night, the person taking our orders kept pushing us to order the surf+turf or the kobe beef options both of which are the most expensive options on the menu. If the &#34;ironsteak&#34; option is that bad please dont serve it or make it better. But atleast the customers shouldnt feel awkward about ordering the &#34;cheaper&#34; menu options. (We ended up ordering the surf+turf and the kobe beef options, because we didnt wanna have bad food).
3. Bland(ish) beef. The meat without the sauces has no taste. I found it to be high quality but it definitely needs the sauces to make it taste good. It would be good to season the steak/meat  so that the sauces can be used as accompaniments and not a necessity. I was afraid of over-saucing my dish and kept adding little quantities of sauce and the first few bites were very bland.

However, the place is nice and clean and I like the concept and would definitely return to give it a try again."

Service - professional but unpretentious. Felt like we had space but didn&#39;t feel neglected. You can dress up or not. Perfect balance across the board. I was pleased and I would keep this place in mind for future special occasions.

Value/portions - though only a few courses, they were generous. I left feeling full and happy. The non-alcoholic pairings were tasty, but we would share 1 in the future. I was satisfied after just a few sips of each. 

Food - compared to other vegan restaurants, they do an excellent job at showcasing vegetables. Instead of making tasty substitutes, they just make tasty food. They utilize fun seasonal ingredients in creative ways. 

My favorites:

2nd course - winter veggie potato salad. A paragraph of ingredients, but it felt like everything belonged and worked together well. Salty, sweet, savory, bitter, tangy, floral--loved every bite.

4th course - smoked veggie bread pudding/souffle (tasted like) in a slightly spicy carrot sauce. Compared to the other courses, this one leaned closer to comfort food and was extremely satisfying. Super savory flavors and great texture.

The less memorable:

3rd course - everything was a bit on the sweet side. The autumn olive chutney, beet coulis, candied pecans, squash... sweet on sweet on sweet. Not bad, I just preferred the more savory dishes. 

1st course - brothy mushroom/veg soup. On the bland side and lacked interesting texture, especially in comparison to the complex flavors/textures in the other dishes. Still slurped it all up. Their lows didn&#39;t dip that low."

A 3-week revolving menu based on the micro seasons is very cool and different. Things kick off at 7pm when the chef brings everyone together to talk about the menu, ingredients, etc. Definitely a different and special experience that&#39;s unique. 

Reservations are required, but the Saturday night we came in they had at least 25% vacancy. As expected, staff is very attentive and friendly. Ambiance is intimate yet somewhat casual. I&#39;d say dress code falls somewhere between casual - business casual. 

The food is very thoughtful and tasty, especially being all vegan. I won&#39;t delve into individual dishes because by the time you read this, it&#39;ll be something different on the menu. The non-alcoholic pairings were interesting on their own, but I didn&#39;t find them to elevate the courses. I will also say that portion size is on the small size. 

My biggest draw to Harvest Beat is an actual vegan, fine-dining establishment. Too often do I see vegan restaurants resembling small coffee shops with their mismatched furniture, limited/cramped seating, and no wait service. Nothing wrong with that, but theres far and few vegan restaurants where I want to spend more than 15 minutes eating my food."

From the minute you walk in, you feel welcomed and invited to be involved with your meal.  I promise you, if you aren&#39;t vegan - you won&#39;t miss the animal products what so ever!

Reservations are required and can be made online; however, I had to call since there are not any spots for a single person online.  Since I was alone for this 2 hours adventure, I opted to sit at the bar by the kitchen so I could see all the action.  It was a wise decision.  I was able to watch all the food being prepared and plated.  The commitment to making your meal visually stunning as well as taste amazing is remarkable.  I also chose to have the wine pairing.  The wine was just as meticulously thought out as the food.   The staff even called me by name and each one interacted with me at some point in the evening.   The chefs were consistently smiling and asking if we enjoyed the food.  The sommelier was very informative and passionate about the wines that were chosen.   Each course came out just in the right flow of time and overall it was a wonderful evening.  There&#39;s no real reason to describe the food as it&#39;s just outstanding.  Highly recommended!!!"

I now understand why 7 pm was the only time slot available when booking my reservation (which isn&#39;t necessary, but recommended): They start the intimate dining experience at the same time for their entire family of diners, to last a full two hours. A special dining model!

At the beat of the gong after everyone is seated, Head Chef Joe details each of the 5 courses the entire restaurant (yes, the entire restaurant) is about to be served.  

And so it begins! 

We sat at the bar so we could chat with Joe and Matt, the only two occupying the kitchen to prepare all of the dishes, course after course. We learned just how much passion goes into the menu, every three weeks!  After that time period, a new menu is created to use in-season ingredients from local farmers.  

SO much creativity and thought goes into each dish.  From the onion sage corn bisque (topped with POPCORN?! Perfection in a cup) to the thyme grilled lobster mushrooms, with my personal favorite: the masa crusted joe parker peppers filled with cashew cheese - holy crisp and flavorful wowness!! Ending the night with an avocado key lime pie (interesting dessert choice and really refreshing!!). 

With each course, a drink pairing is served by the owners - your choice of alcoholic or non-alcoholic.  

There is probably something to be said about being seated at the bar, where you can be a spectator of all that goes into each dish and appreciate the fine details that they put into prepping things, so my recommendation would be to head straight to the kitchen and seat yourself there for a full show! 

For diners who have an open palate and curious taste buds, Harvest Beat is more than satisfying.  There were many new-to-me ingredients such as fennel flowers, dragons tongue beans, and elderberries, that it felt in part like a food-test experiment... and I was loving every minute! 

All plant-based, locally sourced, fresh elements in a restaurant that has a hint of romanticism! But don&#39;t let that deter you from coming in some shorts and a t-shirt - this place doesn&#39;t discriminate. 

If you&#39;re not vegan... even better! A nice testament to how gourmet is possible with veggies and fruits."

I was lucky enought to sit at the bar and right in front of the chef&#39;s plating up. Its a prefixed 5 course meal (soup, salad, vegetables, protein and dessert) and I got the non-alcoholic pairing.
The setting is very casual and that was my favorite part. The chef starts the meal by explaining the concept of the restaurant and the menu for that night. I went during eatly autumn hence the menu had some autumn and summer ingredients. The soup + salad course was my favorite in its entirity. The soup was creamy (with no cream) and the salad had the best kimchi roasted apples. The vegetable course had cauliflower mushrooms which were tender like pasta. I could have eaten a bowl of them :). The protein course had a mung bean crepe with a smooth mousse in between. The salsa on top with corn and habanero was my favorite. The dessert was a huckleberry cheesecake with chocolate ganache and chocolate whipped cream. The cheesecake tasted like any regular cheesecake and not at all tasted or looked vegan. The non-alcoholic elixirs were yummy. The asian pear and rosemary was my favorite. The second favorite was the huckleberry kombucha cocktail.
The service was warm and friendly. My favorite part was that the chef interacted with us and even made small alterations for us on courses! Would come again and again!"

First thing you HAVE to know before coming in is that this is a fixed menu and starts at a fixed time... while this might seem odd it completely enhances the experience and allows the service to be top notch... 

We arrived a few minutes early and were given the tour to decide where to sit.. after being shown the dining room and the out door patio that is very shaded we decided we would sit at the bar so we could observe Joe and Matt put together the incredible meal... This would be the best (and last decision) we&#39;d have to make all night... as I said the menu is fixed, the pairings are set and once we decided where to sit we were on cruise control... 

Once we were settled Aaron, one of the owners, came around with our first drink and a quick chat... his warmth and passion for the restaurant shows in everything he and the staff do... 

The unique experience continued with the gong ring and the premeal talk which was centered around where the food is procured from (all locally sourced), giving thanks and gratitude for the meal and a moment of togetherness... 

ALL of the food was incredible... I&#39;m not great at going into detail on things like this but suffice it to say there wasn&#39;t a single course that wasn&#39;t delicious... HOWEVER, with that being said... The caramelized onion sage corn bisque was the best soup I have EVER had... 

Joe, the head chef, kept saying the word &#34;beautiful&#34; to describe the foods, tastes, process and everything about what they do at Harvest Beat... there is a lot of beauty and love in this place and if you want a fun evening with friends or loved ones I highly suggest this experience.. the whole thing took about two hours and was well worth it... 

One final note that I didn&#39;t want to make the value, nor do I want to harp on this, but for the VALUE I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find a better meal in Seattle... honestly, they could and should be charging a lot more for the quality product they are putting out and the experience they create...

We eat a plant-based diet every day.  We keep visiting various vegan restaurants and say that this is the reason why meat-eaters hate plant-based foods.  The food is just not very good - lacking in flavor and weird textures.  

I am quite puzzled as to why there were so many great reviews for this restaurant.  My husband, daughter and I came here for a 5 course dinner on a Saturday night. As soon as we sat down, both my husband and I felt like we had made a bad choice in dining here.  I hate the smell of patchouli and that is all I could smell as I was sitting at our table. One would hope to smell the aroma of the amazing food we are about to be served.....oh yeah, that is why there wasn&#39;t any food aroma; they are masking the odor with patchouli.

We had inquired what the menu was going to be served in advance and we were very disappointed when we arrived that the menu had &#34;slight changes&#34; and by that I mean that the first 2 courses were completely different and there were some changes to the following courses as well.

The first course we were served was a watercress soup but it really was a lukewarm extremely unappetizing green, weirdly thick (think thinner pudding) consistency soup. The second course was served on the same plate and it was a salad with sparsely any dressing and loads of thinly sliced radish.  

The third course was &#34;Celeriac wrapped sumac grilled asparagus on a pea kaffir lime puree with a tempura battered goose tongue and micro pea shoots&#34;.  There was supposed to be micro cilantro but they were substituted for the micro pea shoots.  This dish was weird but at least it was edible. I wouldn&#39;t order it again but I ate it because I was hungry.

The fourth course was &#34;Alder smoked morel mushroom garlic arugula cashew cheese spanakopita with a caper tomato allepo sauce, and grilled wild ramp finished with a balsamic reduction.  This was my favorite of the night but still not great.  I judge a dish by asking myself &#34;Would I come back for this?&#34; and my answer is a resounding NO.  

The fifth course was dessert and I love dessert. The dessert &#34;Sitka spruce tip chocolate ganache topped cheesecake with a toasted walnut spiced date crust and a kombucha plum glaze. Sounds amazing!  I&#39;m so excited.  I love chocolate.  I love cheesecake. Did I mention how excited I was to try this?  Until I took my first bite.  Such a disappointment!  

Now it was $50 per person to eat this 5 course meal and with tax and tip we spent around $200.  I think this is outrageous.  We knew in advance the cost but expected way better food, better service, and overall more of a fine dining experience. The servers were sloppily dressed. I never complain about the cost of anything - shoes, handbags, jewelry, clothes, dining out, etc. but the price of this meal was ridiculous for what we received."

Great place, super friendly staff and superb ingredients/dishes. The 5-course prix fix menu is pretty uncommon at vegan/vegetarian restaurants but we were pleasantly surprised by everything. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys an artful and elegant dining experience in a  relaxed atmosphere. 

Even if you find vegan/vegetarian food to be ho-hum at most places-this place will definitely change your attitude for the better."
harvest-beat-seattle,Kari G.,2izTRCBL5Iq19E5Ededtug,"Redmond, WA",1,1,1,179,2,Mis5gNb0ZMy2XXEDppacyw,5.0,2016-01-08,"Harvest Beat has all the makings of a world class dining experience. Its humble 5 course vegan format takes the responsibility of parsing together a great meal off of you and squarely places it into the hands of its very capable chefs/owners (who by the way are wonderful people). FYI, there are &#34;seatings&#34; that occur every night which allow the chefs to focus solely on their guests, libations and dishes. You must sign up in advance, as there&#39;s one seating per night, but it&#39;s entirely worth it: The service is impeccable, and yet takes its time to generate some lovely hospitality.

It&#39;s clear from the time you get there, that a lot of love went into this place. The chefs begin with a small nightly ritual of storytelling: introducing themselves and thanking their local farmers and foragers. Presumably, the reason why you&#39;re eating at Harvest Beat (a vegetarian restaurant, which is actually a rare thing, even for Seattle) in the first place is because you give a damn about what goes down your gullet, so there is a strong focus on familiarizing guests with ingredients, techniques, and backstory. A nice gesture, as well as a tribute to the values of the restaurant.  

A la other restaurants sharing the &#34;seating&#34; model (ahem, Herbfarm), there are options for alcoholic and non-alcoholic pairings. I love the idea of this, mainly the notion of non-alcoholic pairings, as they offer more creative freedom in flavor range than wine (which only ever tastes... umm... like wine?) and are reliant on taste alone (and not on getting their imbibers hammered... which is a kind thought, but sadly, not always a possibility or even a goal). 

In the end, the food here is king... and dishes come out of the kitchen like clockwork, are plated and garnished beautifully but not pretentiously (pay attention to the colors), and taste wonderful as well. The flavors are nuanced and delicate for ANY restaurant, let alone a vegan one. Like any Seattle restaurant, the ingredients rotate based on what&#39;s seasonal, local, and forageable (if that&#39;s even a word). 

If you&#39;re lucky enough to arrive while there are still some &#34;chef&#39;s table&#34; seats (at the little bar by the kitchen), I suggest snapping up the experience. Overlooking the kitchen is serious fun, visually stimulating, and also, you might actually learn something about the food or the chefs. The chefs are pretty much the nicest, calmest people you&#39;ll ever meet... and if you come in on a weekday, the vibe of the chefs and how they run their place will instantly make you forget that you work a nine-to-five, that you need to take your car in, that you&#39;re tired. You won&#39;t think of anything except the conversations you&#39;re having and the experience at hand. Plus, the kitchen is warm (important to keep in mind in the winter months)...

In closing, this is going to sound so hippy, but I&#39;m grateful I came here. I&#39;m going to come back here for sure... and I hope you, whoever you are, make it here, as well!"

Even if you&#39;re not vegan or vegetarian, you need to try this place. We started the night by gathering in the kitchen and ringing a gong (while we sipped Prosecco). The chef told us where the food came from and what we were eating for the night. We then went back to our table to receive the first two courses (soup and salad) along with a glass of wine. The salad was so delicious and the soup was full of flavor. Our third and fourth course were both so delicious, it&#39;s hard to put into words (also paired with their own wine).  The dessert (again, amazing) came with a vermouth. Each dish was different and full of flavor. The portion sizes were perfect for five course meal. We left stuffed!"

Everyone involved cares tremendously about what ingredients are served, how they are prepared and where they are sourced from. A ton of time is spent making sure a dinner service is just right above and beyond the 2 hours it takes to dine.

I am not a vegan, and a vegan restaurant would normally not be on the top of my list, but while in town recently I wanted to see the scene these guys created and we were not disappointed.

Everything was fresh, artfully prepared, and delicious. I especially enjoyed a morel mushroom dish in which the produce was foraged. Really quite superb. We sat at the bar and had the opportunity to watch the kitchen in action. Food is not thrown onto a plate here - there is a lot of care and precision put into the preparation. The wine pairings were spot on, and I was not hungry at all when the meal was over (a common worry for a meat eater going into a vegan meal).

It&#39;s not inexpensive, but it is also a high quality meal that is prepared painstakingly by hand. If you care about where your food comes from, you will enjoy the pre-meal commentary that gives that detail.

Will definitely come back on our next trip to Seattle. These guys are capturing the PNW positive vibes here in a great way."

If they did, they&#39;d know that 1/2 of Sutra has opened up Harvest Beat in its place (sort of).

Let&#39;s just get one thing straight: my husband is so NOT a vegan. But he looooooves him some vegan food.

We had a 5 course meal that was quite possibly the best fucking thing I&#39;ve had in a really long time. Sorry for the swears. But not really. They&#39;re necessary.

1st &amp; 2nd courses: some kind of delicious concoction of roasted chestnut and celeriac soup that tasted like heaven in my mouth. Plus a really fresh salad that I probably could&#39;ve kept eating the rest of the night.
3rd course: cashew &#34;cheese&#34; cake. WUT. Now, I haven&#39;t perfected the art of cashew cheese, but these guys have. LIKE A BOSS.
4th course: eggplant stuffed with a butternut squash mousse that burst into flavour in my face hole. I was so happy after this. But what came next made me even happier.
5th course: pomegranate &#34;cheese&#34; cake, topped with coconut cardamom magic, pom gastrique, dark chocolate dust HOLY CHIT I DIE.

NO DAIRY THANK YOU VEGAN GODS.

If this doesn&#39;t convince you to go and eat here, I don&#39;t know what will."

I was one of the people unable to get reservations to Sutra before it closed. I thought I had missed my chance, but alas, Harvest Beat is here! My family enjoyed one of my favorite evenings ever last weekend. The mood and ambiance was inviting and warm and the staff was extremely gracious and accommodating. I have lived in LA and became used to plant-based menus of inventive vegan cuisine, a concept the Seattle vegan scene is sorely lacking, but Harvest Beat is my hope that Seattle is evolving.

The food itself was wonderful, though it changes regularly so describing it wouldn&#39;t specifically help. One of the unexpected favorites was a chestnut soup and salad as well as my nonalcoholic drink pairing. I highly suggest trying their elixirs and homemade concoctions! I also heard one of the neighboring tables exclaim that the dessert was the best vegan cheesecake ever they had ever had, which if you know the vegan dessert scene, is really saying something (and I would have to agree!)

We will definitely be back for more special occasion dinners!"

As a south Asian person, the whole white spirituality vibe was a little bit over the top for me, but with food that good, who can complain? 

So when I heard that Harvest Beat was opening with so many of the people from Sutra, I was pretty psyched. I was excited to see a new restaurant that had its roots based in the Sutra family.

The first red flag was when we sat down and I noticed that, rather than starting with the Sutra vibe and putting a fresh, personal spin on it, the owner of Harvest Beat was basically trying to recreate the entire experience in a new location, from the gong to the flavor profiles. Reboots almost never work, and Harvest Beat is not exception to that rule.

One, on an atmospheric level, it just doesn&#39;t work to try to create the same intimacy in a big split up space like this location. It doesn&#39;t feel like an extended family dinner, and trying to force that atmosphere only highlights that.

And most importantly, the food was just not great. Although they used a lot of similar ingredients that I was such a huge fan of at Sutra, the flavors were off on all of the dishes, including dessert, and I love, love, love dessert.

At Sutra, they used unusual and seemingly discordant flavors with such a delicate touch and fine balance. The dishes were often surprising but harmonious and really dynamic. I know that sounds super frou-frou, but it&#39;s the only way to describe it. Harvest Beat tries to do the same, but without the same finesse or subtlety. In all the dishes, it felt like there were too many flavors, and they weren&#39;t balanced well, we&#39;re heavy-handed, or just didn&#39;t seem to meld well.

We had smoked morel crepes, and the smoked flavor was so overpowering that I could barely taste the sauce and the crepe (which were both pretty good). The beet &#34;poke&#34; was overly floral, and the saffron cashew cheese was an off putting yellow color for some mysterious reason. The cherry tart, which I was so looking forward to, just tasted like cherries stacked on top of a crust. Many of the components of the dishes were good, but the dishes themselves were not.

None of the dishes were bad, but none of them were great, either. I didn&#39;t finish any of my courses, including my dessert, which is a huge first for me.

I hope that Harvest Beat veers from the Sutra path and takes these new circumstances as a chance to do something new, rather than trying to recreate the old magic of Sutra."

From the moment you walk in you are welcomed as if you are at a friends house for dinner.  This isn&#39;t an ordinary restaurant and is set up to provide you with a food experience.  The vibe is warm and relaxed and not complicated.   Don&#39;t overthink dress code or menu. The menu is set and you can truly relax into the experience because they take the decision making out of it and you can relax.   Sitting at the kitchen viewing table top is the best because you can watch the art happen.   The Chef will explain that all food is local and relates to the season.  The flavor and texture are truly food porn.   My husband is a meat eater and is always skeptical at vegan restaurants because they tend to overcomplicate items and get to abstract with food.    He was blown away with the food and loved every bite!  The wine pairing is the way to go as well and can open your eyes to new favors.   This was a magical experience and I highly recommend it.  As a side note, make sure to smell the hand towels in the bathroom.   Amazing!"

One can taste the innovation and love in each dish that the staff carefully crafts in Harvest Beat&#39;s open-kitchen style venue.  From the owners&#39; local origins and experience with manifesting this style of restaurant, to the hand-selected farmers market items that appear on the menu, I was amazed at how in-tune the food is with the seasons and the local crop availability.  In addition, the staff is amazingly engaged, obviously love what they do, and are attentive to each of their guests.

I feel as if the main set-back for Sutra, (Harvest Beat&#39;s predecessor, RIP 2015) was the lack of space.  Half of the seating was located semi-offsite; but the new Harvest Beat is stunning and there is no offsite room for overflow seating.  The wide-open plan includes all seating in two tiers.. Exemplary and high-class to say the least, yet the addition of natural accents like the driftwood partition between the seating tiers give it a comfortable Northwest vibe.  

The rotating menu ensures you are truly eating local and in-season, and the non-alcoholic drink pairings are to die for.  I have bounced around between omnivore, vegan, and everywhere in between and cannot emphasize enough that the fare here tailors to all palettes, assuming you are a human being.  I&#39;d definitely recommend reservations for the weekends!"

The group dining concept was fun and the food was really fresh and delicious. They had both wine and non-alcoholic drink pairings with the menu. We had the latter and they were perfect! The meal started out very light with soup and salad and ended with an amazing parsnip cake main course and raw cake dessert. My husband and I both loved the meal!

If you&#39;ve ever been to Sutra, then you&#39;ll like the new incarnation: it&#39;s virtually identical, down to the ringing of the large bell and the rambling introduction of what you&#39;re going to eat by the owner. The chef has changed. Joe from Vermont used to work at Sutra and has been promoted to Head Chef. I don&#39;t know if he has quite the deft touch that the former chef has, but he does an admirable job. Same $50 per person for a 5-course set dinner, with $27 wine pairings or $14 non-alcoholic pairings.

The first two courses actually come together: a soup and salad. We had carrot &amp; ginger soup with a salad composed of beets, miner&#39;s lettuce,and walnuts sweetened with agave. I feel it&#39;s really ONE course, not two, because the soup is served in a very small ramekin, so don&#39;t expect a bowl. A cauliflower napolean was next, and it was probably my favorite dish. Savory layers in a tomato-based sauce. Entrees change all the time. We had a vegan gnocchi made of stinging nettles served with broccolini and abalone mushrooms. It&#39;s hard to make a gnocchi with no flour, so the texture was a bit weird. I applaud the effort, if not the final result. Finally, dessert was a vegan vanilla/orange ice cream topped with a chocolate peanut-butter crust. It was rich and satisfying.

The space, in the old &#34;Satay&#34; location on 45th, is on the spare side. Two levels, with two different types of tables &amp; chairs. Not much in the way of decor that could heighten one&#39;s experience. Overall, I&#39;m glad Seattle has a Harvest Beat. It&#39;s expensive for what you get. A few improvements would really make diners feel that spending $125-$175 per couple was money well spent: first, get a liquor license and serve fine cocktails. Right now, it&#39;s only wine &amp; a few beers. Second, invest in making the space feel warmer and prettier. Third, don&#39;t skimp by calling what should be one course, the first and second courses. Fourth, offer a choice of desserts, which the kitchen can very well make in advance. And it wouldn&#39;t hurt to offer an amuse bouche, as many high-end restaurants do."

I found Fat Ducks by searching Yelp for &#34;black and white cookies in Seattle&#34; after I had a craving, and they came up. I got the Lucky Duck (corned beef, pastrami, Russian dressing) and my wife got a bagel dog. The Russian dressing was made in-house and it was fantastic. The owner (Jacqueline, though I might be misspelling that) brought us samples of all of her cream cheeses for my wife to try with her bagel dog and they were all so good that it was hard to pick just one--the sun-dried tomato and chive were my favorite.

While I was ordering my food, I mentioned to the owner that the black and white cookies were the whole reason I came. She was baking about 50 of them for a catered event, and part of the way through my meal, she brought me half of one of the cookies that had fallen apart. (It was delicious!)

In addition to that, since we&#39;ve only been living in the area for a short time, she brought us a free (!) bag of eight (!!) bagels--the bagels she uses come from Blazing Bagels, so I&#39;ll have to give them a try as well. She also gave me a free brownie on my way out after I paid. She&#39;s way too sweet! I can&#39;t wait to go back next time we&#39;re in the area."

The owner had me try the garlic cream cheese and potato salad to make sure I would like it before I bought it (both were great, I love potato salad with a good amount of dill).
When I went to pay I left a tip but she said it was &#34;too much,&#34; gave me back a dollar, and insisted I pick a dessert to take home with me as well.
On my way out she gave me a bag full of four bagels since it was my first time, on the house, instructing me to put them in the freezer so they would last in the heat.

I highly recommend this place! Both for the sweet, friendly service and the yummy filling food."

I was a little confused about how to order at first. There&#39;s a menu chalkboard above the counter, but you order by filling out an order form - they are hanging right inside the door, and the bagel choices for the sandwiches are also visible there. But the choices for cream cheese flavors are on one of the chalkboards. It was a little complicated (for instance, cream cheese is listed in two places on the form) and not entirely clear which items are included in the sandwich base price and which cost extra, but the friendly assistant helped me figure it out. 

I ended up ordering a veggie bagel sandwich (the Green Duck) on the 9-grain bagel with sundried tomato cream cheese and havarti cheese. The owner urged me to add mayo and mustard to the sandwich, but I declined - I&#39;m not a big mayo fan and while I like mustard, I didn&#39;t really want it on this particular sandwich. While we were waiting for the sandwiches, the owner brought us out some yummy bagel chips with samples of the two cream cheese flavors we had ordered on our sandwiches (chive and sun-dried tomato) to make sure we liked them. 

We got the sandwiches to go. On the way out the owner offered us a free cookie! We chose a ginger molasses cookie, and it was delicious - tasted great and had a nice texture (I like cookies to be soft and not too hard). The sandwiches themselves were also very good - tasty and filling. The owner was very apologetic that my bagel got a bit &#34;extra toasty&#34; but I actually like them that way. I definitely felt more satisfied with what I received for the price here than from Einstein Brothers in the U-Village QFC. 

I would recommend Fat Ducks for bagel sandwiches or baked goods. I didn&#39;t try the coffee, so I can&#39;t comment on that."

It&#39;s a little inconspicuous as a restaurant, but it has a sign outside the restaurant so you can&#39;t miss it. The interior definitely reminds me of someone&#39;s house and has a pretty nice homey feel. I was a little confused when I walked in, but luckily I read other Yelpers&#39; reviews and knew how to order bagel sandwiches from here. There&#39;s a bunch of clipboard with slips of paper on your left - just fill those out and hand it to them and you&#39;re good. 

You can tell right off the bat who the owner of this place was. As another Yelper mentioned, some may be put off by her attitude at first, but she&#39;s actually a very nice lady and really cares about making a sandwich that you&#39;ll like. Jaclyn, the owner, suggested a few changes to my bagel sandwich and I&#39;m glad she did because I&#39;m sure she knew what she was doing. Because my bagel sandwich tasted bomb as well. I don&#39;t even know what sauces she used or whatever, but it was great. All the ingredients tasted fresh, and the bagel itself was delicious too!

The bagel I had was A-OK.  Made on the spot and was quite good.  It was messy but that&#39;s besides the point.  Ducks in Row with a jalapeno bagel.

To begin, service. The woman who owns the shop (I really wish I got her name :/) was attentive, genuinely cared if you liked what you were getting, and went WAY out of her way to make you feel comfortable and welcome. It was the best service I&#39;ve received in years. That alone was enough to make me want to come back.

The food, wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow. I don&#39;t know what it is about University Ave, but there are a LOT of good eats. This place, no exception. The bagels (from Blazing Bagels), are just so damn good. I can&#39;t believe I hadn&#39;t had a bagel this good before. Its a bit sad. The cream cheese I swear feels/tastes like its made there. I didn&#39;t ask, but my money is on made-in-house. I have only had one menu item but you better bet that I&#39;ll be back to sample just about everything else.

The price, so low! For what your getting, the value is spectacular and they have so much to offer.

I came here for the first time looking for some lunch after seeing that it had bagel sandwiches. After a poor experience with bagel sandwiches at the airport, I was willing to give this little deli a shot since the pictures looked so good. I found the sandwich order forms on the wall, but was a little lost as to where all the bagel choices were. The lady at the front helped me and she showed me all the fresh bagels at the front of the entrance. She recommended any of the cheese bagels for sandwiches because they are bigger and can hold all the filling a bit better than the others. So I decided to get the asiago bagel.

There are many sandwich choices, all named after ducks. I chose Daffy Duck with chicken instead of tuna. You can add mayo, mustard, and other veggies to it as well. I first opted out for mayo and mustard, but the lady recommended I add them on because they make the sandwich that much better. So I took her suggestion and went for it.

The owner in the back, Jaclyn, is such a sweetheart. She called my name out and asked me if it was my first time here. She gave me a spoonful of the chicken salad filling to make sure I liked it. And I sure did! It was a delicious, giant spoonful! I took my sandwich and pecan bar to-go and headed home.

That bagel sandwich is big. They cut it in half nicely and I only finished half during round one. Round two came two hours later. The chicken salad is so filling and creamy. It is a tad bit on the salty side, but still divine. I love the addition of red onion, and adding dijon mustard was such a good recommendation. My asiago bagel was the perfect vessel and added that cheesey flair. 

Pecan bar, so gooey, ooey, and caramely. I loved it. It&#39;s a huge, thick piece that can easily be shared. Pecans are everywhere and submerged in this thick caramel sauce that will have your sweet tooth smiling. 

Overall, this place just tastes so homemade. It makes me feel like I&#39;m getting real home cooking. I paid a little less than $12 for my sandwich and pecan bar without tip. Although maybe a little pricey for a sandwich, it was just so worth it."

Jaclyn is the epitome of great customer service and really enjoys making people happy.  My Roast Beef on a Cheddar Bagel w/Garlic Cream Cheese was perfect.

Then she told me I couldn&#39;t just order at the counter and had to fill out a sheet for what I wanted.

After filling it out, she said that I chose the wrong things and insisted on adding / changing my selections. Then she said that because of what I ordered, I had to choose a different (larger) type of bagel.

None of this made sense, because if I&#39;m custom ordering something and an option is there, I should be able to choose it or leave it out. If not, the option shouldn&#39;t be there or there should be some sort of a note about what combinations you can or cannot make. Or she should just have a normal menu.

She then told me that she&#39;ll avoid charging me extra for the options I chose this time, but next time it would cost more. This also didn&#39;t make sense because she forced me to choose the more expensive options.

The sandwich took a long time to make and when it came out, it was fairly small. I finished it in within several minutes, and then went to another place to have an actual meal.

The sandwich did taste good, but it was way too small to fill me up (even though it was one of the larger ones they had), way too expensive for the size, and the weird rules about what I am and am not allowed to add to a &#34;build-your-sandwich&#34; order were off-putting."

I was just about to give up until I found this place. This place gave me a small town feel in the sense that they serve you on non-disposable plates, don&#39;t rush you and have you pay at the end. While these are no NYC bagels, these are probably the best you will get in Seattle."

I just moved to Seattle (down the street, actually) less than 3 weeks ago and Jaclyn chatted with me while preparing my to-go order. Jaclyn threw in a free dessert as long as I promised to call her and let her know how my husband and I liked our sandwiches.

I didn&#39;t call her, but came back the next day instead (with my hubby) to let her know in person... and order lunch again. :) This time, as we were walking out the door after our meal, Jaclyn handed us a bag of 5 bagels to take home for free. Amazing! I sliced them and put them in baggies in the freezer to make ham/egg/cheese sandwiches with.

My husband ordered the Lucky Duck and said it was better than Paseo, the over-hyped sandwich shop in Fremont. I got the Daisy Duck on a croissant. Jaclyn&#39;s chicken salad is super good with tons of dill, just the way my mom makes it.

The sandwiches are meant to be made on the Blazing Bagels which Fat Ducks carries. Their asiago is the only asiago bagel I&#39;ve ever liked. Most of the time it smells too... I don&#39;t know, sour/funky? But this asiago bagel was what I&#39;ve always dreamed such a bagel would taste like.

You&#39;ll also want to order dessert. Peanut Butter Death Bar is a must-try."

Nor do I have many &#39;bests&#39;. Not because I&#39;m a foodie or snob -- the opposite actually, food is sometimes a burden and a chore, a thing you have to eat because otherwise it hurts. So I don&#39;t often pay attention to food and I can&#39;t usefully compare this or that ramen shop or those and these doughnuts. I came in to Fat Ducks expecting a grab and go fast breakfast sandwich, but I left a changed man. I picked up a jalapeño, pepperjack, sausage and egg sandwich. The lady in front urged me to eat in and enjoy it, and lightly suggested a coffee too. Why not? They brought it to me when ready and I dove in. 

Prior to this sandwich I didn&#39;t understand what bagels were. To me, bagels were always thick, doughy resignations, for sad motel breakfasts or campus event catering. I had no idea they could be so flaky and toasty and flavorful. The sausage and egg were thick, hearty patties, spiced and savory, not overly salty at all. The cheese! I&#39;m lactose intolerant! I hate cheese! But it was so melty, chewy, and just the right amount of tangy. And the coffee was great. I savored the sandwich, missed my bus, and would happily do so again. Best breakfast sandwich I&#39;ve ever had."

Just coffee and some soup. Are you wondering why the hell am I writing a review for them and giving them 5 stars? I am new to Seattle and this is the first place that made me feel close to home. To start with, this place is adorable and the kind lady behind the counter is even more so. She was really sweet and patient. We got talking and I told her I am new to this neighborhood. She immediately skedaddled to the bagel counter and put 6 bagels into a bag. She handed them over to me and said &#34;Welcome to the neighborhood&#34;. She also handed some of their cream toppings as samples and they tasted amazing. I am yet to try the bagels (these bagels have no preservatives added :D) but I am sure to become a regular customer here. Its definitely a wonderful neighborhood."

The owner, Jacqueline,  no-nonsense gal with a huge heart and is a one-woman show in running this place. I used to live nearby and decided to stop by; I was 7 months pregnant and desperately in need of brownies! Here&#39;s my breakdown:

Food - Awesome! Not once, in well over a year, have I come into this place and disliked anything. Her bagels and sandwiches  are packed full of flavor. She makes her own cream cheese spreads and they are fantastic. She has a really great variety when building your own bagel sandwich, which I prefer. I&#39;m completely biased towards her brownies but I&#39;d never say no to the rest of the baked goods. Prepare for a very rich treat! Her portions are huge! 

Service - like I said, I love this woman. She possesses a characteristic that I admire and rarely see in many business owners and that&#39;s a raw honesty. She&#39;s real and connects with her customers on that level. Every time I go in, even if she&#39;s having a rough day, I feel welcomed. She&#39;s incredibly generous and you can tell this bakery is her passion. 

Price: Very, very affordable and you get a lot. 

Overall, I highly recommend this business. I honestly wish there were more like it and I pray for Jacqueline&#39;s success because I think she has a good thing going.  It&#39;s worthwhile to stop by once and I guarantee you&#39;ll be back for more!"

How about when you walk into your Grandmother&#39;s house and the first smell you get a whiff of is freshly baked goods as she welcomes you with a loving smile? Walking into the Fat Ducks Deli and Bakery was comparable to exactly that.

Not only did the the owner walk us through all the glorious bagel/sandwich selections, she made a point to make sure we got exactly what we wanted. As soon as we sat down after ordering, this wonderful woman made up of sweetness brought us a plate of cream cheese and bagel chips. Then after diving into the mouth watering sandwiches, she bid her farewell by giving us each a baked good free on the house, as well as chocolates just because.

We&#39;ll leave it as this: Fat Ducks Deli and Bakery isn&#39;t the sandwich place that any of us truly deserve, but the one that we need. Unbelievable food. Unbelievable service. Unbelievable experience. If you want to fill up your stomach and be put in a good mood at the same time, go to this place, now."

I went into this place to grab some sandwiches to take a friend and his parents at the UW hospital (in the ICU). The gal behind the counter, Jaclyn, the owner and a wonderful character to be sure, started asking me questions while she made my bagel sandwiches. She got out of me the story about this young man in the hospital, an amazing story to be sure. She had me wait while she served another customer and then proceeded to load me up with over $150 in food, bagels, delights, sandwiches, chips and more. I carried out three full and heavy plastic bags of delicious foods. She told me to feed this family and the nurses and anybody else who was touched by this young man&#39;s life. I wanted to take her picture, but she insisted I not. So, I demanded a hug which she gave me. She&#39;s an excellent hugger!

I could leave off right there and be satisfied, but when I got to the hospital and sat down with this family to eat the food. It was truly outstanding and worth a 5 star rating regardless of this saint&#39;s gifts. This food was made with love, and I was in heaven with each scrumptious bite.

But if you want to know more things...I got the Triple Duck Club (ham, turkey, bacon) and it was freaking delicious.  All the meats and veggies were fresh and tasty.  I was urged to add cucumbers and onions, which worked out well.  I was also urged to add cream cheese, which I declined, but just might have to try next time because Jaclyn gave me a sample of the garlic spread on their homemade bagel chips and it was the BOMB. 

My one complaint is that she made my sandwich without gloves- which is a very minor deal as I&#39;m sure she washed them...but still.  I will eagerly make this a 5-star review if this is different on my next visit (and you can bet that&#39;ll be soon).

Overall, a lovely shop with a lovely owner who makes a killer bagelwich.  High in the running for best sandwich in the U-District."

Hello, you darling pecan bar. Thick, gooey sweetness. The crust on it was like shortbread (if you&#39;re a fan of that texture). Sweet, and should be eaten slowly; don&#39;t want diabetes so early.

Enter the magic bar. It reminds me of a samoa cookie. Probably because of the coconut flakes and the chocolate chips on it. Tasted like a good homemade bar that I would gorge on all through the winter. But, something I wouldn&#39;t be getting every day. Mainly because it&#39;s the type of bar that could be replicated in the home, and the crust on it was crumbly; like the consistency of a cheesecake crust. 

Also had the raspberry bar. It had a gingersnap taste. Very Christmas-y. It was good! (I love gingersnaps!) Though I feel like it should have more raspberry filling in it. (Update: more like a gingerbread flavor)

Price-wise each bar was around $2.75 so the total came up to around $9. Quite pricey for three bars that aren&#39;t fancy in appearance nor ingredients, but the size is good, and satisfies. 

Will try the bagels the next time."

There was no time listed on the note so I walked in and was rudely questioned by a blonde haired lady with What do you want? I stated I was hoping to get a sandwich and she replied well didn&#39;t you see the sign on the door and I said yes I did but your Open Sign is on and your door is unlocked so I thought you were still open. I then told her no problem I will spend my money somewhere else. She told me not to leave and that she would make me a sandwich but by this point I didn&#39;t want her handling any food I would be eating.... She followed me across the street asking me not to leave but like I said it was already weird and she had been rude so why was she changing her tone now?

When we ordered the lunch special, she gave us bagel chips to munch on while we waited and called us over for samples of the potato salad we ordered to ensure we would be satisfied with the taste. 

The bagels the sandwiches were on were incredibly flavorful and of the perfect texture. The flavor... well, bacon on top of my sandwich (bacon cheddar bagel) and bacon inside it is pretty much my dream.

The employee that was working (owner perhaps?) was extremely nice and genuinely seemed to care that our experience was top notch. As first time customers she walked us through the menu and shared the favorites, specials, etc. My wife and I both ordered items that we tend to get at other places but found that what we got here stood out as opposed to falling flat as they have in most of the other places that we&#39;ve been to lately. In addition to the great food and excellent service the place just had a good vibe. The customers were on a first name basis with the employee. The employee knew all the customers. It all had a very small town feel that chains or mediocre places never achieve.

On top of the delicious sandwich, the woman working the counter was incredibly friendly and helpful.

It&#39;s at almost the end of the Ave so unless you come down here for other reasons you will probably miss it. 

Brownies are the best around ooey gooey fudgey more than a cake brownie which is exactly what I like. I also get the rugelash (amazing!!) in apricot and cinnamon too. Cupcakes are huge but nothing in comparison to Cupcake Royal or Trophy but every other dessert I&#39;ve had there has been top notch. However my roommate did love the red velvet and say it was the best he had ever had. Maybe it was my mistake for going for the vanilla cupcake instead.

For food I usually get a bagel dog, the bacon horseradish cream cheese you can put on it is out of this world. But I &#39;ve also tried the Lucky Duck (ask for a little bit of corned beef and pastrami on it) and it is also super yummy and filling on rye.

I agree with other reviewers that this place is a bit pricey for homemade style food. However, it is a small business and I like supporting them, so I tend to go when the budget allows to spend a little extra. Sandwich, chips and a treat and you are easily looking at $12-14 bucks. Comparable to grand central bakery in price.

The owner is very friendly and I always get great customer service from her. She sometimes gives me extra treats for myself or my dog and always makes good conversation. Really adds to the &#34;like home&#34; quality of the place and for someone who&#39;s family lives across country its nice. :)"

I always get really odd combinations of ingredients on my sandwiches and Jaclyn always jokes that it might not fit on the sandwich or she always wonders why I get berry cream cheese with my sandwich, but here sandwiches are all so tasty. You have to try them all.

COFFEE: 4.5 stars, and a good value. 8 oz Americano for $2.50.

SERVICE: 4.0 stars. She was friendly and prompt with the Americanos.

AMBIANCE: 4.5 stars. One of better interiors we&#39;ve experienced in the Seattle area. Old, narrow high-ceiling room with plate glass windows across the front. 4-5 two-person tables and a 10 person group table on the ground level. The balcony area has a counter with several seats overlooking the first floor, a group table, and several two-person tables. There is also outdoor seating on the sidewalk in front.
We were there on a Monday afternoon, and all of the two-person tables on the first level were occupied by solitary women working on PCs; meanwhile, 4 of these tables on the second level were occupied by solitary men working on PCs or reading.

Coffee: Good, not great. I had a &#34;Latte&#34; without any cute pattern.(I just came in for good coffee anyways so that doesn&#39;t really matter.) Kinda a bit too bitter yet no bitter sweet aftertaste from it. Also I thought I ordered a latte, turned out I got a cappuccino version latte.. if that even makes sense. Yea, I don&#39;t think the barista knows the different but I know a little. Latte supposed to be more smooth and milky. Just a heavy light color foam with a shot of coffee. I am sure I ordered Latte but it&#39;s okay. Just stronger on the coffee side and the foam is not smooth enough. I don&#39;t know how to rate this latte while it&#39;s capp you know? :/ so is it good? or bad? I guess it&#39;s okay. 

Environment: You can tell it&#39;s modern rustic style, but kinda try to hard on it. Maybe because of the tables? I love wood work and those wood tables they have is not good quality wood so it looks a bit trying too hard to match the steel. But overall it&#39;s relaxing and chill. Natural lights in with good seating set up. Oh and the music, Jazz without singing. meh. 

For Laptop users:
Both the big wood table and the side window tables don&#39;t have ANY plug-ins. Only the small individual tables have plug-ins under the long bench. Not handy. Didn&#39;t check the upper level but since the lower level only have 5 plug-ins for small tables is enough for me to think it&#39;s not that convenient. And WiFi is so slow. Maybe better than my grandma&#39;s house WiFi but def not coffee shop standard. Sorry I go to different coffee shops to work and this place&#39;s WiFi drove me crazy...

I think one or two times is enough for me. Not a bad place to work but I hope they will improve  their coffee skill and also the WiFi signal + speed problems.
Overall, since you are in Chinatown, you should go get bubble tea instead of coffee! :P"

I used my card and to pay and the white guy at cashier didn&#39;t give me the receipt and told me that it will be in my email (no signature). When I got back to hotel, I noted he took out an extra dollar in tip without my consent or knowledge. 
I called the cafe and asked them if it was their policy to charge people tips without their consent.  The lady on phone told me it&#39;s a mistake and will refund me the money. 
A dollar is not a big amount but I don&#39;t think legit for them to charge people tips without their approval. 
If I had a choice I would give them a zero star for their food quality and customer service. Please stay away from this place!!"

Downfall: The service. We stood in front of the counter awkwardly for at least 5 minutes before the guy there even said a word. And when he did open up his mouth he didn&#39;t really listen carefully to anything we said. We repeated what we wanted over and over. And, my pet peeve, he didn&#39;t even say thank you at the end. 
I ordered the nutella crepe which was delicious. I love the almonds on top. And, the best part, they didn&#39;t hold back on the nutella. This is usually the case when I order this dish at other joints. 
The view from the second floor is my favorite. It&#39;s also not crazy loud in here, at least during the morning time, so you&#39;re more than able to study here. I just wish it was open later at night so I could swing by then!"

Otherwise, my latte was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. Maybe it was because it was so cheap. You gotta pay for quality, I guess. 

Where do I start with the terrible latte? It was watery. The espresso to milk ratio was definitely off, or maybe there was just something wrong with the espresso machine. The &#34;caramel&#34; flavor tasted nothing like caramel and more like cotton candy, a flavor which does not belong in coffee. The foam was depressingly thin, not even a quarter of an inch, and it looked like he tried to do latte art but did not succeed or was going for something abstract. Lastly, I asked for extra hot and got it lukewarm. Overly sweet, insipid, cheap garbage."

Crepes: Thin with a hint of sweetness and good amount of stuffing. Portion is big enough to share between two people for a light meal. The fruit and custard was good with just enough custard and fresh bananas, strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. The savory breakfast was just right, flavorful and meaty. 

Matcha latte: Good amount of matcha and sweetness. Some places the matcha taste like powder and latte is too sweet or too bland. It was perfect here. 

Service: At the time of ordering the cashier told us they were a little backed up so there&#39;s a bit of a wait for our crepes. It was weird since we saw only 4-5 people sitting, but it wasn&#39;t as bad as we thought we got our drinks and food within 15 min."

First and foremost, I love the atmosphere here. They change up the artwork here every once in awhile and I&#39;m always so impressed. It&#39;s clean, cool, and casual here. 

Second, I love their food and beverage menu. Every single sandwich and crepe I&#39;ve tried here is equally delicious. But if I had to pick my favorites, it would be the veggie sandwich and fruit and Nutella crepe. You can get coffee or tea, but you can also order beer and wine!

It has several tables you can sit at on the ground level, as well in the the lofted area. The vaulted ceilings make it feel so spacious. I also like the music they play here as well. It&#39;s not typical soothing coffeehouse music, but it keeps you motivated so to speak."

Like another reviewer had mentioned, there are a lack of coffee shops in general in this area. Why is that? There&#39;s decent foot traffic in the International District at all times of the day. I digress, but this all makes me extra grateful that Eastern Cafe exists!

Reasons why Eastern Cafe rocks:
1. Diversity: Here, you&#39;ll find black people, Japanese people, white people, hapa people, green people, purple people slanging and drinking coffee. All peacefully coexisting in this beautiful meeting place in the middle of the International District. It&#39;s a dream out of Martin Luther King Jr.&#39;s playbook.
2. Great coffee and local tea!
3. For something that looks like a hole in the wall, it is quite spacious. This shop provides two floors of fabulous space for meeting and eating.
4. They serve alcohol?!: Ladies, if you are tired of being bothered at your local bar by some creepster bros, come here and I promise you this won&#39;t be a meatmarket paradise.

Just go, you will be glad you did!"

My friend and I both order mocha and thought it was decent.

Yes, the place is cute and you do get a relaxing feel. But what I wanted was a good cup of mocha and what we got was something that tasted like it came from Starbucks. 

Expect Starbucks would charge me less for a mocha then they did. The art foam was also disappointing, it seems like they only knew how do one art foam and that&#39;s all. My friend and I both got the same bear.... 

Service was okay, we walked in and they didn&#39;t even greet us (we were the only people there) until we walked up to the counter. I think they left us standing there for a good 2 minutes before they actually asked to take our order. I kinda felt like they didn&#39;t want to deal with us or even serve us.

I had the Eastern Special Crepes and my GF got the Fruit &amp; Custard.

The Eastern Special was filled with all types of yummy deliciousness of Cheese, Salami, Bacon, and eggs.  The Fruit/Custard had blueberry, bananas, and I believe some strawberry (I didnt have it, but it looked very savory)

I had a White choco mocha along with my Crepes, very big portion and filling.  Everything was good, and I will most likely make a trip back to have some more crepes."

The food and drinks seem to be more French and Italian than anything in Asia but I&#39;m not complaining. I ordered up a latte which was served with an adorable bear depicted in the foam. I also got the Eastern Crepe with a dollop of their house-made creme fraiche.

The Eastern Crepe was HUGE and it was stuffed with delicious ingredients including bacon, cheese, and avocados. The creme fraiche is just like sour cream and provided a nice, refreshing contrast to the heaviness of the crepe.

The service at Eastern Cafe was solid. The employees had an easy, friendly manner while maintaining professionalism. They provided good descriptions of the food when I asked about them and helped me decide on my order. I got my latte from the counter and my crepe was brought to my table.

Eastern Café is a rare find in notoriously coffee free zone of the international district which is dominated by bubble tea places.

Last time I was there she brought me my sandwich on a plate that I had ordered to go, so I told her it was to go.  Without a word she spins around back behind the counter, grabs a box, with no gloves puts my sandwich in the box then picks up the pickle and sorta tosses it in the box (turns to see if I&#39;m watching - which I am), then brings me the box.  Didn&#39;t like that so much.

Another time I was in there ordering and I saw her preparing a dessert crepe.  She needed to open a new can of whipped cream, used her teeth to pull off the safety seal, put the whipped cream on the crepe, proceeded to wipe the tip with her finger and lick it off.  :P"

Up until recently, the only hangouts within the main I-D area were bubble tea shops. That is until Eastern Café opened up last year.

This is a great indie coffee shop in the heart of the I-D. The space is huge and expansive with two levels of seating. It is reminiscent of the layout at the old Bauhaus space on Capitol Hill.

The café has a industrial loft feel to it. There is a large community table on the lower floor which is amazing. If you are looking for seclusion, the top level offers you this. Free Wi-Fi is available and there are a few electrical outlets if you need to charge.

The fare here is unlike the food you will find around the rest of the neighborhood. It is a bit like World Pizza in bringing something unique to the area. They serve your typical coffee drinks as well as offers food items like crepes and gelato.

The latte ($3.25) I had here was well made, though it was a little confusing where I needed to go to pick up my drink. I think they should set it out front instead of at the side pickup area.

Nevertheless, I would definitely visit Eastern Café again if I am doing the working out of a coffee shop thing in Seattle. The ambiance here is very chill which is something I look for when it comes to visiting a coffee shop for this purpose."

I love the rustic industrial chic decor, the huge reclaimed wood table, the exposed brick, and the Gallery space upstairs with crazy cool artwork.  I didn&#39;t try the food, which could be this place&#39;s saving grace, but the vanilla latte w/almond milk that I ordered was one of the worst I&#39;ve had; it was really bitter, incredibly weak and was served to me without any foam?  Honestly, It tasted like folgers. I&#39;m not convinced it was even espresso.  The crapes look amazing and I may give this place another try for the food.  Hopefully the step it up a bit with the coffee."

I just love this little independent coffee house in the middle of Chinatown. Surrounded by tea shops and Chinese restaurants I think it&#39;s a cute little gem. 

I stopped by one day after I found it on Yelp. I work nearby-ish. I ordered a cappucino - the first time I&#39;ve had one in my life, so I can&#39;t really say if it was good or bad, but I don&#39;t like coffee in general, so... Next time I come, I&#39;m going to order some gelato maybe. Or wine (after work, of course). The workers were really friendly, starting a conversation while I waited for someone to make my cappucino. 

I LOVE the decor, I mean, there isn&#39;t much to it which is what I love. I sat upstairs and love the high ceilings, huge windows, the lighting, everything. Half of the cafe is painted and the other half was left bare or unfinished. I&#39;m guessing it was intentional and I think it&#39;s cool. The seating wasn&#39;t too comfy (not butt = needs seat cushions) so I couldn&#39;t sit forever, but there are a lot of tables upstairs and a great big table downstairs. 

New fave spot in the ID."

They were serving gelato and another dish as their offerings (I obviously got distracted by gelato). I tried the pistachio, which was creamy, dreamy, and made by Gelatimo. 

I recently saw a deal online for a free affogato after 4pm. I happened to be in the area today and decided to pop in with a group. We had some espresso, tea, and affogato. The espresso beverages were good. Affogato had nice strong coffee flavors contrasted by the pistachio and toasted almond I picked as my two scoops. 

The space was amazing! We sat at a rather large wood table that looked to seat about 12-14 people. There were also smaller tables and an awesome space upstairs. The place was decorated with local art and the menu offerings went beyond coffee and dessert. They offered crepes and sandwiches and such. Had we not eaten earlier, I would have tried other items. Also offering wine, beer, and cider is a plus! 

Both staff members were friendly and efficient. I&#39;m glad I went and will likely return."

I got a vanilla latte. Yay for latte art. The coffee was just ok. I think it was only $3.50 for my 8 oz. So a tad cheaper than some other spots. I also got a banana nutella crepe. It was just ok too. It&#39;s huge though. I&#39;d suggest sharing their crepes. $6 cheapie too."

If you want to be more secluded, the seats upstairs are perfect. The ambiance is nice and quiet with soft music almost always playing in the background. 

I&#39;ve had the Nutella crepe, and the fruit and Nutella crepe (can you tell I like Nutella?) Both were good and big enough to share with a friend. I&#39;ve also had their green tea latte and iced soy hazelnut latte. When you finish your cup of tea, you can get hot water and enjoy it again. I don&#39;t usually get the gelato unless it&#39;s happy hour, then that&#39;s when I go crazy.

Drip coffee is what I usually order - I&#39;ve had a few drinks off their coffee menu, but somehow always find myself going back to the drip. The vibe of Eastern Cafe reminds me a lot of another place called Moondrop Coffee (their music is more EDM/Hip-hop though). This is just a side note for anyone who might read this and is looking for more hole-in-the-wall places around Seattle. 

I believe the pastries they offer are made by Fuji Bakery as well. It&#39;s always great to see a local business supporting the community around them!"

It&#39;s just turned 10 AM and the several customers of Eastern cafe are still waking up. By 12:30 it will be bustling with the regular patrons. Heavenly Father by Isaiah Rashad blends quietly into the cafe ambiance. The employee&#39;s taste in music here has always been top tier. For the last two years i have gone without broadband internet access at my personal abode and have developed a nearly religious practice around wi-fi-ing at Eastern. My relationship with the internet and social media, for lack of a better word, has been toxic. Just as food nourishes or poisons the body, information and ideas either nourish or poison the soul. Sadly, much of the content in my internet feeds is more akin to junkfood than health foods if not actual poison. But is one&#39;s feed no more than a twisted reflection of oneself? Is my aversion to the internet actually rooted in a deep seeded fear of who I&#39;ve become? The &#34;problems&#34; of a 20 something, I shake these dark thoughts from my head and return my attention to my sandwich. Ham-brie, toasted. quite delicious. By now all the Eastern Cafe archetypes are showing in full force. The freelance graphic designer, flicking through his twitter feed in a second tab. The multi-generational group of non profit grinders, discussing the next grant for their organization. The laptop music producer, headphones on, blunted eyes glued to digital wave forms. Around lunch time the police arrive. The group of officers always stop by mid day for a quick coffee. I understand now more than ever, that these officers are likely decent humans who are making a well-intentioned effort to patron the local businesses and weave themselves into the fabric of the community but in these tumultuous times I cant help but find their presence deeply unsettling.  I close my laptop and walk slowly down the stairs, out the door and onto the sidewalk. the sunlight washes over the street. Enough internetting for one day. I&#39;ll be back next week. 

Great people! great coffee! great music! AAA+++ will coffee again.

But coffee definitely is a craving of mine on cold Seattle rainy days.  The latte art here is delightful and pretty good.  I would say that it&#39;s on the sweeter side however, and not my favorite coffee place.  The one thing I enjoy most is the atmosphere of this cafe, it&#39;s nice and quiet with a modern/industrial low key ambiance and I&#39;ve always had really friendly customer service with the cashiers.

The crepes are definitely not my favorite though, texture is a bit more dry than I like,less of a thin moist pancake consistency.  I got a assorted fruit with custard crepe and a scoop of pistachio gelato.  The gelato scoop was the TINIEST scoop EVER.  It was really unproportionate to the size of the crepe, which was BIG.  I wouldn&#39;t get the crepes again per say just because something about this crepe tasted savory.. like chicken.  and I think that&#39;s just because something wasn&#39;t cleaned thoroughly when they prepared my crepe/fillings."

Yes, yes i know there is a difference in quality between the two, but i have a great bond already built with my baristas there and the reward system is nice.

I have came here 2 times so far, and back to back. Both times I got a mocha, and the first time I as well had gotten a seasonal fruit and custard crepe. The mocha was great both times, and the coffee was tastable unlike some other places. My only down side to it, but i don&#39;t think big enough to take away a star is that half way through my drink it was cold. But I do try to make things last and not chug down so i do take longer. So it makes sense. So if you usually take more than 20 mins to drink something, maybe try asking for it to be a little hotter. And onto the crepe, I LOVED IT. I do think next time i may ask or pay for a little more custard, because i simply love it, but the fruit was great. At the time they had raspberry, blueberries, and bananas. I opted out of the bananas, and usually would have with raspberry, but choose not to. And I don&#39;t regret it. 

The atmosphere was pretty good. As many people I know would call it a hipster place, it doesn&#39;t reflect on the quality of the place. 

I would defiantly recommend."

And almost all seven billion people will tell you that somewhere, hidden amongst them, is The One. The odds of ever meeting them are statistically very improbable, but somewhere, deep within the spiritus mundi, the collective consciousness of humanity, there is an irrepressible desire to find them.

I go to Eastern a lot. They say that home is where the heart is, and my home is halfway through an 8 ounce Americano with white chocolate and a splash of cold soy. Somewhere in the nightly sipping of my beverage, I lost my chance at The One.

I sat in the loft upstairs, looking out at the waves of college students and ID yuppies typing away on their laptops or flipping through their study notes. I felt like Rapunzel, so close to the world, but so far away and unable to connect. Unable to reach out and feel the tenderness of a warm smile or the gentility of a hug.

And then he walked in.

And everything felt... real. Like the first time you played in the snow. I felt at once betrayed that the world was cold and uncaring enough to never share him with me before, and grateful that he was here now.

Just as we are sure there are about seven billion people in this world, we can be sure there are at least seven billion pages of literature each describing the heat, the electricity, and the sheer gravity of the first time you meet eyes with your One.

And I promise you, every one of those pages is a lie. There are no symphonies - no weeping strings and choral cherubs. There are no sparks - no combustion or dazzling displays of spiritual energy. There are no stomach turns, no heart dropping, no soul shattering. There is only silence.

The whole thing is maddeningly monotonous, frustrating in its mundanity. It&#39;s when he looks away that you hear the weeping strings, feel the combustions, feel your heart sinking down through the dark hardwood, seeping into the grain, molding itself into permanence.

There are seven billion people in this world. And I can tell you that somewhere hidden among them, in a quiet, chilly cafe in Chinatown, is The One.

The wi-fi here is very reliable."

When we were finished with our food, we weren&#39;t sure if we were supposed to leave the plates there or what... so we had to go down and ask.

rolled in this morning for a bfast crepe. it&#39;s huge for $7. i&#39;m going to have them go easy on the basil next time, tho. it&#39;s fresh basil and they put a lot of it in which is generous but it overwhelms the flavors of the crepe&#39;s other fillings, even the meats in it. the crepe itself had a nice mouth feel (tee hee) to it, plenty toothy if that makes sense. i should have eaten it there instead of walking the 2 blocks back to my office. it was cold by the time i got back (due to being a blustery cold day). i&#39;m gonna try there signature crepe next time for lunch. 

i was originally worried that this was a sign of gentrification in chinatown but i&#39;m actually liking this as a quiet spot to come relax in the neighborhood and sip some coffee or tea without loud music and teens (yeah, i&#39;m a curmudgeon...)

i saw today on the chalkboard menu behind the counter that they serve beer and wine and also a beermosa (beer and OJ) which i&#39;m pretty sure is just a brass monkey."

Its such a hidden gem it&#39;s been my go-to hideout for the past year, the last thing I want is more people to fight over the tables with! But, alas, they (the staff, the owner, the cafe) are just too nice, I can&#39;t deny them the 5 stars they deserve.

Why so much love? Let me count the ways:
- friendly staff
- delicious food (try their crepes and pastries, yum!)
- great drinks (I&#39;m a tea snob, love their selection here)
- nice, spacious and comfortable decor with natural lighting from tall windows and ceilings
- consistent, free, unlimited wi-fi

Above all, the place offers quality food, drinks and service at affordable prices. (E.g., $6.50 for a HUGE crepe with loads of FRESH fruit (strawberry, banana, raspberry), ample amounts of Nutella and fresh cream with sprinkles of almond slices) Typically one has to choose between either quality OR affordability, here you get both.

I love the place because it reminds me of Bauhaus. It has an upstairs and it has this very simple feel and very clean.

Very different feel from Oasis Tea Zone. The manager did a good job switching it up :)

They have alcohol, gelato and food. 

The gelato is awesome... rice is one of the flavors, which tastes like vanilla, but my personal faves are the pistachio and hazelnut :)

So far from what I&#39;ve experienced, the staff is very friendly.... honestly a bit friendlier than Oasis hehe ...

Their sandwich menu is pretty simple, which I wish they added more to, to give it that &#34;bam&#34; to a cafe. In addition, maybe expand the coffee menu? 

From other opinions and of my own, their coffee does taste a bit burnt, but hey cut them some slack, they just opened and burnt coffee doesn&#39;t turn me away from the place AS OFNOW, I&#39;ll keep exploring the menu."

I am upset due to the service and the food quality I received today at Eastern Cafe. I ordered some crepes and a roast beef sandwich. Crepes were good. But the lettuce inside the roast beef sandwich was soggy in the middle and dried on the edge. It was obvious the vegetable was not fresh. The service was horrible... I had to pay the tip upfront so I paid 20% tip expecting to receive decent service. All I got was forks and knives thrown at me when I asked for extra silverware. So sad...

On an autumn evening this was a pleasant, welcoming space to enter, all lovely dark wood and soft lighting.  The servers were welcoming and kind.  And every dish we tried was delicious.

I didn&#39;t get enough guidance from the menu or staff on portion sizes, unfortunately.  It fits with the French bistro concept, I suppose, but it feels a little odd for an American to sit down, order dinner, and then decide an hour or more later that we really need more food for a decent filling meal.  The half-chicken and the butter lettuce salad came in dinner-sized servings, but most of the other dishes (brisket, beans, risotto, salmon, mac-n-cheese) were definitely on the small-plate, or even perhaps appetizer, scale.  There&#39;s no way to tell this from the menu, which just lists everything, more or less in the same price range ($8-$18), in one long column.  The photos here on Yelp will give you some guidance, they&#39;re a fair reflection of what we received.

I recommend treating this as that bistro experience - sit down, get a glass of wine, order some food, have a lovely conversation, if you&#39;re still hungry, order more food, more wine, repeat until you begin to believe you&#39;re in an old café in France.  Without the surly and forgetful waiters, thank goodness."

We came in just in time for happy hour and were happy to find some open tables in this cute, quaint space.  The happy hour has a good amount of options to choose from : my favorite was the mac and cheese and the fried cod with aoli.  Those were so good!  

Entree- wise, we got the braised octopus, which was not as tasty as I was hoping it would be and was a rather small serving size.  I don&#39;t think I would order that again... However, the moules and frites were of ample size and the fries were so good - it was a little hard to get at the sauce at the bottom because the dish was overflowing and shallow spoon, but it was still very good.  The house bread was very much used to sop up the rest of the sauce and make sure it did not go to waste.  yum. 

Cocktails are solid as well and slightly discounted for happy hour.  I tried the Ginger whiskey sour - it packed a decent punch, and my friend tried a cocktail with plum in it.  We weren&#39;t sure how that would turn out, but it was actually really light and refreshing, and not too sweet.  Would definitely order that again!"

We ordered the Mad Hatcher Free Range 1/2 Chicken, Mushroom Risotto, and Painted Hill Steak Frites. That&#39;s gotta be the smallest chicken ever - about four pieces, each only slightly bigger than your hand. Only the steak frites (only the fries really) looked like a non-kid size portion. Despite the size, the chicken was not tender at all, pretty tough to eat, the sauce wasn&#39;t too flavorful either. The risotto was the best of the three, but a little too greasy to my tasting. 

SERVICE: standard
We sat at the bar because there weren&#39;t any open tables when we got there. We ordered everything from the bar like we would from a table. After you&#39;re done with your meal, the server/bartender cleans away your dirty dishes and presents the dessert menu. We definitely weren&#39;t full from the entrees so felt the need to eat more. 

AMBIANCE: nice hidden date spot, romantic but slightly loud
This place has a minimal industrial feel to it, perfect for dinner or girl dates. Definitely has a more young adult/mature vibe to it, didn&#39;t see any table without any drinks."

For dinner we ordered the steak frites and the South Indian crab cakes and both enjoyed our wine. The meal was about $60 plus tip which is very reasonable for dinner for two and a glass of wine each. We could have enjoyed one more dish but we were comfortably full with our two dishes. The bread served at the beginning was delicious. 

Pair feels like a neighborhood place, not necessarily a spot one would drive too far out of the way to visit, not that it wouldn&#39;t be worth the trip. Parking was plentiful in the residential area, as well which is a great bonus. 

Noise level can get higher with the setting and close quarters. 

Note: not a good place for kids and the tables are very close together so it&#39;s hard to get in and out of your table/booth. Could be worth knowing if someone in your party has limited mobility."

In fact, I&#39;ve never been in this situation before. Thankfully, everyone was polite and we were ushered to our seats and attended to quickly. 

There&#39;s definitely that air of curiosity and perhaps even embarrassment around a woman dining alone. There were some glances of uncertainty, but everyone mostly carried on their business. The waitress was nice, but left me with the impression that she would have rather been assigned someone else. Perhaps my first sentence shouldn&#39;t have been &#34;I&#39;ll have water for now, thank you.&#34; Those words probably give servers nightmares.

The food was (expensive) delicious! I really liked the moules frites, and that Pair made it a signature dish by serving the fries in the mussels and broth. Very nice touch, and probably some of the best frites I&#39;ve had in a long time.

It was a fairly cool spring day, yet it was still warm and stuffy inside the restaurant with the doors wide open. I can&#39;t imagine what the dead of summer must feel like. The staff are somewhat stiff, with the exception of the owner who flitted from table to table in a lovely flowing dress giving the place a touch of lighthearted charm. There was an interesting mix of older and younger couples, which could be why I was experiencing some confusion over the general atmosphere. Everyone dressed casual and comfortable, but there was still a &#39;pinky up&#39; vibe, somehow..

Hopefully no one took offense when I started reading. I couldn&#39;t help it. I&#39;m not an avid reader, but taking books to restaurants when I dine alone makes me feel more comfortable. Also, I&#39;ve been on a Ligotti journey for the last week and can&#39;t put it down.

After my dinner, I really wanted something to soothe me as I read, so I ordered some tea.
The tea was $4..HOWEVER, the teapot holds 4 cups. So, you&#39;re really only paying $1 for tea, if you finish the teapot. Why on earth would someone do that? No idea..

(Yes, I drank 4 cups large cups of tea after a heap of frites to confirm this information)."

The menu is French inspired and the ambiance feels like you have stopped at a French countryside inn. The Mad Hatcher roast chicken was juicy, full of savory flavors. Friends who we ate with us on one of the visits raved about the brisket as well. Desserts are creative mixed-in with a couple reliable classics such as flourless chocolate cake, a pot de creme and creme brûlée. Their French press coffee is an excellent way to round-out the meal. One can have an intimate meal with a spouse or date as well as experience revelry with a group at one of the larger tables.

It is very cute and casual. My boyfriend and I walked in without reservations on a Wednesday around 7pm. We were able to get a table right away, as it was fairly quiet. Being complete foodies, we got several things to share.

-Summer fig salad: It was a little bit too sweet and that is saying alot since I have a major sweet tooth. I feel like the vanilla oil and ricotta made the dish a bit overwhelming because the figs are quite sweet already.

-Charcuterie plate: One of my favorites! I loved the variety and flavor that came with this dish.

-Curried Squash: This was pretty mediocre as it did not have much of a surprise element. It tasted plain. 

-Natural Beef Brisket: Very tender and juicy. I loved the horseradish creme fraiche!

-Steak Frites: Pretty basic. Presentation was not there. It seemed pretty crowded on a small plate. The proportion of the fries to the steak was overwhelming. The steak was pretty good overall. 

-Mac and Cheese: SO YUMMY! I would get this again in a heart beat. The blend of cheeses and the perfectly al dente pasta was on point.

i&#39;m a hoover so we split the chicken and the pea vines, too.  i thought the chicken was okay.   the skin was crispy but the meat was a bit over done and not as flavorful as i had hoped, even with the jus.   the pea vines needed garlic and was a bit disappointing.

Service was solicitous and friendly, not at all interfering with our conversation. Dishes came out at appropriate times and we didn&#39;t have to wait at all when we were ready to pay and head out.

The only thing between Pair and a five-star review was a little grit in the salad. Otherwise, everything was lovely."

The portions are on the small side but the prices are not too steep considering the tasty dishes and high quality ingredients used to prepare them. We started off with the gougeres, which are on the happy hour menu, and they were near perfect... light, warm, and herby with a subtle cheesiness. For the main course I had the mushroom risotto (vegetarian) which was rich and creamy. Yum! My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his crab and tomato fettuccine as well. We ended up splitting a simple green salad for some veggies and I am glad we did so, to help round off our flavorful meal. I am looking forward to coming back soon! Hopefully to try something off the dessert menu."

Nice touches like bringing the Happy Hour menu to your table and encouraging you to use it even though you&#39;re clearly there for dinner. 

The food is tasty and visually pleasing. The herb gougeres are amazing and should not be missed. Especially if you&#39;ve ordered the cambozola fondue--great for dipping.  The browned butter pasta dish with sage &amp; sour cherries stole the show, however. Drooling thinking about it.

We arrived when they opened, with 3 people. Although the restaurant was mostly empty, they refused to seat us because we were expecting a fourth sometime in 15 or 20 minutes. We explained that we wanted to order food before our friend arrived because we were trying to get to an event. But the hostess, and then the owner, kept explaining that it was the Policy not to seat partial parties. I can understand if it were only 1 of 4, but this was frustrating and ridiculous. It would have taken too long to meet somewhere else, so we stayed in their cramped bar area. When we finally did sit down at a table shared with other diners, there were plenty of other seats around us. So annoying.

Definitely not a friendly, service-oriented place. Plenty of better restaurants to choose from."

Honestly, for months I&#39;d walk by look at the menu and thought it looked like the same old over-priced items you find anywhere else in Seattle. I was so wrong! The lighting and decor give it a cozy  feel, you  hang up your coat by the entrance, then are greeted with friendly smiles, and the waitress brings a small serving of nuts and crackers while you review the menu. The crowd was a mix - parent&#39;s with their teenager, a few dates, and good friends getting together. There was definitely a neighborhood feel, but much nicer than a cafe. This is what we had: 

*Gougeres (cheese puffs): sort of flaky and airy little round biscuits with cheese. Much  lighter than they looked.
*Halibut (special that Friday): pan fried with crispy edges. Served with a baked potato but looked like it had been cut with an egg slicer and still in one piece with a sauce on the side (forgot to ask what it was). 
*Steak Frites: the beef had so much flavor! With the little blue cheese and the fries it was a really satisfying dish.
*Bread Pudding: this is what the waitress recommended so I went for it. It really was phenomenal. It&#39;s really good once you get to the center. I do wish it had a little more ice cream is all.

Servings are small as noted by others, but I was thankful because I got to eat more than one dish.  Total bill before tip was $64 (included 2 beers). We left super happy and now consider it a favorite."

I checked out the menu ahead of time and picked out what I wanted but they had changed the menu and my dish wasn&#39;t available anymore.

We had the gougeres and the cheese plate, which was the highlight for me. It came with great crackers and a great rhubarb compote. I has a cocktail (The Vesper) and it was very well-made. It was strong but refreshing at the same time.

I had the lemon chili pappardelle. The noodles were good but dry-not enough sauce for my liking. My boyfriend had the moules frite (mussels and fries). The fries were crisp and well-seasoned and came with an aioli and ketchup. The mussels were just okay.

I finished with the coffee chocolate pot de creme. It was rich and small and delicious.

Came tonight in a group of 5 people at 6:25. We were told the wait was 50 mins because there were lots of reservations tonight ( they take reservations for groups 6+). We stood in the entrance trying to figure out if we wanted to stay and wait. While we were deciding, a group of three came in, and got seated at a table that would&#39;ve fit us! There were 2 2-seater tables put together to make a spot for 4, and the hostesses separated the tables and sat the party of 3 at one 2-seater, and left the other 2-seater available. Surprised, we asked the hostess why they didn&#39;t just seat our party at the table when it was configured for 4 (and add a 5th chair to the side, like they did for the 3 people at the now 2-seater). The hostess wasn&#39;t even very apologetic, she just said &#34;oh, we didn&#39;t think about that&#34;.

So...that decided it for us. We went somewhere else for dinner. Didn&#39;t even get to try the food. Isn&#39;t a hostess&#39;s main job to greet and seat people?!"

The ambience was great but the waitstaff was a little slow.

We also ordered dessert. It ended up being $24 each including tip so not the cheapest happy hour, but we enjoyed our time. The food presentation is excellent, but know this is not a quick in and out happy hour. It took us a little while to receive our check and leave. We spent over 2hours there and did not feel rushed out, but if you&#39;re in a hurry I would not recommend.

I would highly recommend the patatas bravas and macaroni and cheese off of the happy hour menu and the banana bread pudding off the dessert menu it definitely is as amazing as pictured."

This place is fabulous and I have not had a menu item that tasted bad, ever.  For people on a budget, it is a bit on the spendy side, and the plates are small, more than a tasting but less than an entree, but the trick is to get there before the happy hour ends, and take advantage of the very good happy hour deals on appetizers -- the Brisket sliders, horseradish crème frâiche &amp; shallots are to die for! --   and that way, you&#39;ll spend less on the regular-priced menu items.  Oh, the happy-hour Sidecars are delicious!  Second only to the Sidecars at Cyclops, where they use Metaxa instead of the usual brandy.

My boyfriend and I always sat at the bar when we went to Pair, and never had a problem with the service.  In fact, the bartender/server is so pleasant and sweet!  Most of my staff interactions have been with her, but once, I asked for a Sazerac, and she wasn&#39;t sure how to make one, and one of the other servers overheard my request, stepped in and with confidence and aplomb made the best Sazerac I&#39;ve ever had!  He even dipped the lemon rind garnish in something and set it on fire before putting it in the drink!

Some of the items I&#39;ve tried that were fabulous -- pan seared trout, the lamb served over baby carrots (I believe that was with saffron butter sauce), the zucchini risotto were all beyond good and delicious.  A few items were good, but nothing to write home about, like the leek gratin.  Not sure what was missing, it was tasty, but not out of the world.  In other words, not beyond my own cooking skill-set.   That&#39;s why I love places like Pair, they can do stuff that I can&#39;t do in my kitchen.

The decor is elegant/rustic/hip and very reminiscent of a the kind of chic eatery one might find in Bordeaux.   

I would give this place six stars if I could.  The sixth star would be for the banana bread pudding (served warm), with vanilla ice cream, caramel and walnuts.  The only other dessert I&#39;ve had that makes me swoon the way I swooned over this one is Tart Tatin at Cafe Campagne.

It comes on kind of oblique, starting with the sign. You drive by and it&#39;s clearly marked, you turn the corner, and, again, it&#39;s clearly marked. But it&#39;s kind of old construction (especially for Seattle), and the outside is pained all one color. Well, the glass isn&#39;t painted, but pretty much everything that can be painted is painted, and the exterior space to some extent blends in with the office frontage next door. 

Let&#39;s just say that I mapped the location, GPSed it on my way there, parked, and *still* wasn&#39;t entirely sure I was heading through the door until I had hand on the handle. This might well say more about me than it does about Pair, or architecture, or paint color.

And then when you&#39;re in, it&#39;s perfectly clear where the bar is, where the dining room is, where the lobby is, and so on, but it&#39;s all just one big space. They have some wrought iron balustrades in the middle of the floor to enforce a No Minors Beyond This Point policy, but, really, the whole thing is one big room. It&#39;s what my sister (and she would know) would call deaf-friendly architecture, because everybody who&#39;s not either in the bathroom or the kitchen can clearly communicate with anyone else in the place using only sign language. 

There&#39;s a bar, and there are tables, and there are benches, and there are the aforementioned balustrades. But, given that the place is in an old building, and they haven&#39;t really added many divider walls, it walks a fine line between a semi-formal bistro feel and a real living room feel. What&#39;s best about this is that they walk this line perfectly, but they don&#39;t insist that you notice right away. You sit for an hour or two, and that&#39;s when you realize that the ambiance is just as it should be. I wasn&#39;t facing the street, though, so I didn&#39;t have an eyeful of Calvary Cemetery. Not sure if that might change the sense I got. Probably not.

We&#39;re just across the gulch of U-Village from the greatest source of entry level restaurant labor in the city, that being the UW. And the staff here seems young, but you don&#39;t get the sense that they&#39;re just putting themselves through school. They might (or might not) be career restaurant people, but they clearly care about the work and they do a great job. And, besides, they might not have anything to do with college...I can&#39;t tell the difference between 20-year-olds and 25-year-olds anymore. 

In fact, I should hasten to add that the service is part of what makes the place great. They handle every table visit and every other interaction right on time, but they project the sense that they actually enjoy finding out what people are interested in ordering, rather than just asking because they have to. Who knows? Maybe they&#39;d even work there for free. Well, probably not. But they do seem to enjoy the work, and genuinely so.

As far as the provisions, there&#39;s everything to like about those as well. The Maritime Pacific Old Seattle Lager is certainly a great choice for a place with two tap handles, but, alas, as seems virtually always to be the case, it was shot through with diacetyl. Tasted like a big imperial pint of popcorn butter. Switched to a very nice Walla Walla red, Forgeron I think, that&#39;s available by the glass. The Delmas champagne seemed to be welcomed heartily across the table. 

The special last night was chicken oysters. They&#39;re little dense, earthy, chewy delights from...somewhere inside a chicken. There are two great scenes in Amelie wherein Dominique Bretodeau relishes eating the oysters out of a freshly roasted chicken, before he even musters the patience to carve the bird. This is really not a culinary basis for wanting to try a new food, but it&#39;s piqued my curiosity for years, and it&#39;s very cool (for me at least) that Pair happened to have these out as a special.

One thing about the approach here is that small plates are a focus. The charcuterie plate and the cheese plate both turned out beautifully. I&#39;d not had blu di bufala before, but it&#39;s a great funky way to eat blue cheese. Altogether, the oysters, cheese, and cold cuts made for a great french-ish sort of indoor tapas picnic by the graveyard. 

Dessert capped the evening in fine style, again in the theme of homage to Amelie, being a creme brulee--one of Amelie&#39;s favorite things to do in the movie is crack the brittle surface of creme brulee with a spoon. Evidently, people who truly delight in creme brulee take fairly universal delectation in the cracking of that brittle surface. Especially if the creme brulee is as good as Pair&#39;s; just the featheriest crackle of darkened sugar keeps you from the tureen of sweet cream you seek here. If you keep your fingers away from the edges of the well, you&#39;ll walk away with no spoon scars if you&#39;re lucky, but that all depends on how much everyone at the table likes creme brulee."

The prices are fairly decent on the HH menu for alcoholic drinks and little bites. I wanted pommes frites, but that probably would have spoiled my dinner. Next time, for sure!

We both had the house wine, and chose different items off of the RW menu. The dishes were good - maybe not the best we&#39;d ever had, but still very good. Service was friendly but unobtrusive, which is nice for date night. The restaurant itself is super cute and definitely European-inspired; I really liked it. There&#39;s a small bar, as well.

While not exactly tapas style, Pair offers smaller plates, and ordering multiple dishes to be shared works well. Like others have said, this is a small space, and we sat at the bar to avoid a wait. If your showing up on a weekend night at prime time, budget 1/2 hour to chill out and have drinks before being seated. No worries, the drinks are excellent, and the space is warm and friendly. 

Food was superior. All of it. FANTASTIC risotto dish, endive salad from heaven (insert happy place here if your an atheist), caramelized cauliflower in a sauce that packed a piquant punch, crab cakes that were heavenly. 

I&#39;m happy we sat at the bar. The bartender, Brandon, chatted with us, and was knowledgeable about the menu.

The olives were great (what are they marinated in?  It&#39;s a tasty mystery).  

I ordered the caramelized fig &amp; arugula salad (sans bacon) and was super excited to taste it.
And then it came - now, I luuuurv arugula, cheese, and figs.  Together.  But this was kind of bland, which made me sad b/c it looked so...tasty.  I&#39;m not blaming it on the lack of bacon b/c I don&#39;t eat the stuff.  Maybe there wasn&#39;t enough salt?  Pepper?  Spice?  I&#39;m not sure.
We also had the mushroom risotto, which also sounded amazing on paper, but when it came, it was tiny ($14?  Really?), and also a wee on the bland side.

The flourless chocolate cake was Pair&#39;s saving grace - as it was dense, chocolate-y, and quite lovely.  And gluten free!  

Our server was sweet, but I was a bit perturbed when they started clearing our table when we hadn&#39;t even paid yet.

I&#39;m not saying I won&#39;t come here again, b/c I probably will.  Just not anytime soon."

The servers were extremely friendly and helpful in picking out some good bites for sharing. The restaurant is on the small side, but the ambiance is cozy and welcoming.
I especially enjoyed the happy hour mac and cheese, the fondue, and the gougeres. The prices are fantastic for the quality of what you get. Even the house wine at $5 was really tasty.

Even the regular dinner menu looked fantastic and very reasonable. I&#39;d definitely come back just for the dinner.

It does get VERY busy, VERY quickly. This place is better for smaller groups - 4 people max. Otherwise it could take a long time to get a table."

We each ordered a slice of the flourless chocolate cake ($8 each). Ooh it was rich! Rich in a good way, but I wish I had a glass of milk to go with it. The atmosphere reminded me of a French country cafe, but the old French music playing in the background made for a perfect candle lit date. Next time I want to try the banana pudding.

We had a delightful and delicious dinner at Pair last night. Both restaurants have so many options on their menus that appeal to me, but I&#39;m too full to eat enough! Last night we had the Gougeres and the warmed Olives as an appetizer, and found that a bite of both at the same time is quite delicious!  We shared the 1/2 chicken and the Leek-Potato Gratin, which was just the right size and soooo good. I can&#39;t dine there without getting the Banana Bread puddin&#39;.

It&#39;s in the Ravenna neighborhood on a quiet street, and has an unassuming exterior.  Inside, however, has a fantastic cozy atmosphere.  Seating and lighting is intimate, with a pleasant level of ambient noise coming from the crowded tables.  The music was soothing and fit the mood.  Overall first impression was that we had found somewhat of a gem in this sleepy neighborhood.

The food was seriously good.  After munching on complimentary nuts, we had cambozola fondue that was wonderful.  We ordered some crab fettuccine that was good but not spectacular.  Lastly, the moules frites were amazing and I would highly recommending this dish if nothing else.  After a very pleasant meal, we finished with excellent dessert dishes of rhubarb pie and chocolate mousse.

The wait staff was friendly and attentive, even taking a few pictures for us on our date.  The vibe was just right for an intimate date night and I would definitely go back.

The food is amazing, well presented and the atmosphere is casual and unpretentious.

I got the brisket and potatoes au gratin both times.... Reminds me of the home cooked gourmet food I grew up on.

My one complaint is that both times we were here it was very loud with cackling women in their late 20&#39;s - early 30&#39;s out for a girls night sitting at the big tables.   They were so loud and belonged in their own private party room.   My ears were ringing for hours afterwards from their loud, high pitched screeches of fake enthusiasm.

I refuse to take a star off for this because I love Pair THAT much."

Most importantly, the happy hour menu was amazing!

They had various options for happy hour drinks, including house wines, champagne, cocktails, and beer (all for under $6) and about seven or so happy hour dishes, ranging from olives to &#34;gougeres&#34; to brisket sliders (all under $5). The herb &amp; cheese gougeres were delicious- fluffy cheesy puff pastries, and plenty of them. There was also a healthy option- the quinoa and red spinach dish was really refreshing. All of the food was impressive, especially for the prices.

When my husband and I lived a few blocks away, we came here enough that the waitstaff started recognizing us - good customer service, but probably bad for our wallet!

In the years we lived in Seattle, we went there for birthdays and anniversaries.  We took out of town friends/family and in town friends.  When I had to go to the ER and couldn&#39;t eat all day, my first meal afterward was at Pair.  We had a 13 person graduation dinner here.  We&#39;ve done early dinners and late dinners.  Even when we moved to Ballard sans car, we would still trek over here.  What I&#39;m trying to say is that I love it.  

The food is always excellent.  They just make good food, without getting too over the top.  The menu changes seasonally, but I consistently love the brisket, the brussel sprouts, the gougeres, the macaroni and cheese, the fondue with pears or apples, the beet dishes, etc.... Service has always been outstanding and professional.  The decor is comforting and makes you want to sink into some more delicious(ly fatty) dishes.  

Order a variety of plates to share amongst yourselves.  I usually find that 2-3 a person works well, but your mileage may vary depending on your stomach.  If you are my husband, you order the steak frites and don&#39;t share.  If you are me, you steal some when he&#39;s not looking.

If I had to fault them for anything, I would say that dessert isn&#39;t that exciting, but it does the job.  Reservations are for six or more.  Their brother restaurant, Frank&#39;s Oyster House and Champagne Parlor, is just down 55th St and also excellent.

Seems that in this case, perseverance does not pay off. After 3 unsuccessful attempts on 3 separate days, we gave up (for now). Because Elemental requires you to show up before 5pm to even have a chance to get seated, we were now in search of a restaurant serving dinner pretty early. Driving around, with my Yelp app open, we came across Pair.

Pair is a rather small, but really cute restaurant in the U-District/bordering Wedgewood. I&#39;ve driven past it several times, but it always looked closed. As we drove past it today, I spotted an Open sign in the window. Bingo, we found dinner! 

We walked in and noticed one occupied table in the otherwise empty room. As we were seated, our waiter informed us that it was Happy Hour. Awesome! We decided to try several dishes from both the Happy Hour menu as well as the regular dinner menu. 

Everything that we ordered, with the exception of the stuffed grape leaves, was scrumptious. The two dishes that stood out in my mind were the Brisket Sliders and Smoked Salmon Toasts.
Brisket Sliders were so good! 3 for $5?! Here&#39;s a hint: Get TWO orders of this! 
Smoked Salmon Wild Toasts - seriously good! Maybe it&#39;s my strong love of smoked salmon....or maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m a greedy greedy person...whatever the reason, I definitely ate more than my half of the dish.

The quality of food that we got, paired with the happy hour prices (see what I just did - a play on words! &#39;paired&#39;....haha, ok, nevermind) made this restaurant a real find!"

This place is so unfortunately overpriced and the quality of the food simply doesn&#39;t justify it.  We had the roast vegetables which were so undercooked, that both my dining companion and I kept slamming our knife into our plates in our vain attempt to try and cut the rock-hard fennel.  They had to have stuck it in the oven for (max) two minutes before bringing it to the table.  The fennel was abnormally licorice heavy- it overpowered the carrots which sadly didn&#39;t fare much better.  (I had a similar dish at the Whale Wins which was not only far more delicious and adequately cooked, but also much bigger in portion!  How is it that I could get a cheaper, bigger, and more delicious meal in Fremont, than in Bryant?!)  The homemade spaghettini was pretty good albeit the sauce a little too tart.  It also was definitely not spaghettini- it was on the thickness level of linguine actually.

The best dish of the night was the smoked salmon toasts- they were very good and the crostini was the perfect bread to serve it on.

It&#39;s unfortunate that places in this neighborhood don&#39;t have to try that hard- there simply isn&#39;t enough competition.  That means unfriendly prices and average food.  I guess I&#39;ll have to venture further to crowded Fremont, Ballard, and Capitol Hill- at least I know it will be worth it!"

The thing is, these are small bites... and i mean small, i had to go home and sadly eat a microwavable pizza.

What a great find! The ambiance was friendly and comfortably upscale, and our server was helpful and attentive. The food we chose was spectacular. We first shared a wonderful salad (a daily special) of sliced heirloom tomatoes with prosciutto, tomato jam and fresh basil followed by a crisp but moist and tender piece of pan-seared halibut filet nestled in a yummy concoction of green garbanzos, seared baby turnips, all tossed in a richly flavorful miso and black sesame reduction. Yum! And as so many others have noted, we couldn&#39;t resist the banana caramel bread pudding. OMG. Probably the best dessert ever.

The first, I would have rated five stars, the second, three, or maybe four. And finally, we went for the last time this evening and where it stands now is at a two, because the server was sooo disinterested in her job. And some of the  food is delicious, but some of it is hyped b.s. For example, I ordered their house green salad, and for $9 for 4 or 5 pieces of iceberg lettuce and some dressing! Come on, really!? You really have to try harder than that. I mean, would it kill you to put a tomato on it, too? A little slice of cucumber? Anything besides lettuce? It cost you ten cents for the lettuce, another ten for the dressing, double that for labor, and boom, mark it up x 20 and you got a nice profit. Wooptidoo.

Ultimately, what we realized is that we initially liked 1) the service - the first time we were here about a year ago the server was sooo excited about the food they had, it somehow made us feel excited about it to. With each subsequent visit its gotten worse. Tonight the lady couldn&#39;t even smile. She seemed depressed or upset that she had to work. 2) we liked the ambiance, which maybe the music was different or because its summer and not winter or something but ambiance without good service I guess feels like a lie. And 3) the food is real hit or miss. Some things on the menu have great depth of flavor, but most of what we ordered tonight was either okay or lame (i.e. the $2 per bite of bottom-of-the-line lettuce). One of the things we loved the most the first time we visited was the lavender and cucumber dry soda. But we&#39;ve since learned that its available at the grocery store and don&#39;t have to spend $30 per-person on a meal to get it.

So, that&#39;s about it. It&#39;s still a unique, interesting place...glad we went there the first time but they&#39;re seemingly not trying to hard to gain our business so I guess nevermind."

The first time we tried to eat here we got turned away pretty rudely, so it took a while for me to be ok with trying again.  We finally went and were able to get seated quickly.  Unfortunately, while the food was great, service felt slow and inattentive.

We tried a series of different things on the happy hour menu, and were pretty happy with them. The Mac and cheese was crispy and deep with flavor.  We also tried the Herbed gougeres, which were light and airy and delish.  The sliders had great balance of flavors with the horseradish and brisket.  Finally, we also had the rillette, and the toasts were a great pairing.

Overall, food was good but a little overpriced, and service was just so-so.  I think we&#39;d like to try more of the menu in the future."

We always order the gougeres, and the banana bread pudding is simply phenomenal - this coming from a chocolate girl.

I&#39;ve been delaying eating at Pair for so long I must be a freaking genius. I like that explanation better than being a moron for waiting so long to enjoy the likes of Salt Cod &amp; Ricotta Cakes with red pepper aioli and kalamata olives, Gougères (herbed cheese puffs), Smoked Wild Salmon Toasts, watermelon with feta cheese and a rich, meltingly scrumptious chocolate &amp; coffee pot de creme. 

Really, though, waiting a long time to go didn&#39;t do anything for my appreciation for the interior of Pair. I would have loved the cute, cozy, casual French country-ish decor just as much a couple of years ago. The out of the way neighborhood location and wide open doors on a sultry summer night would have charmed me just as much then as it does now. On the other hand, it makes me smarter, so who am I to complain?

The only things keeping this from a five-star review are the tables that are just this side of too small, seating that could be just a skooch bit comfier and the Potato Leek Gratin that, while good, had way too much salt. Service was good but not outstanding. There are several menu items I still want to try that will bring me back to Pair. I think that&#39;s an intelligent choice."

There was about a 15 minute wait but it wasn&#39;t so bad, the restaurant is tiny... First we were seated at the bar and ordered our drinks, and then we were escorted to the table that opened up.

During happy hour, my two girlfriends and I had two orders of the mac n cheese, pork belly, half chicken and the sliders. The sliders were SO tiny, omg. They were really adorable though AND tasty but... I eat a lot so this were ridiculously small sliders.

I really liked the mac n cheese but my friends thought it was tasteless... I have to agree with them but I sprinkled some pepper and salt over it and it tasted dandy.

The chicken was REALLY juicy, I had read all the reviews about how amazing the chicken was. Well, I wouldn&#39;t say it was absolutely the best chicken I&#39;ve ever had but the sauce or broth or whatever it was cooked in was very tasty and the chicken felt so tender and moist... if that&#39;s even possible? But, again my roomies thought the chicken had no taste... which sadly, I hate to admit, it was quite bland but we dipped it in the sauce and it made everything a little better.

The pork belly was not bad either although I&#39;m Taiwanese and I feel like we can get this kind of slab of meat and fat on the street stands for like a couple of bucks but this baby was about $13. Tasty but not worth the price.

Our waiter kept coming around to check on us... maybe a little more than necessary that it felt really awkward saying &#39;everything&#39;s great&#39; or &#39;thank you&#39; a million times.

I really wanted to order the creme brulee but it was $7 and I was surprisingly full already so I passed on that. This place is really pricey but if you&#39;re a light eater and enjoy bland foods on small plates, then this is the perfect place for you. As for me, I will stick to moderately priced flavorfulness that will keep me full without burning a hole in my wallet."

I have been a regular customer at Pair over the years and have ALWAYS had great experiences... until last night.  

Due to the popularity of Pair, we sat in the bar and waited 10 minutes before our server gave us water.  (It&#39;s a very small bar and we were right in front of her)  She finally returned for our drink order and we started out with some starters and said would order more later.  She quickly dropped off our starters and ran off before I could get the worlds &#34;beef brisket&#34; out of my mouth.  

I understand, that when sitting in the bar, your server is most likely tending to the drink orders of the whole establishment.  But this girl seemed to have little experience with multitasking.  I have sat in the bar before and have ALWAYS had a positive experience.  

Later I had to ask weather Pair had changed their policy for free bread in between meals.  She responded, &#34;Oh did you want some?&#34;  Yea.... didn&#39;t realize you had to ask. Another feature she failed in doing, was bringing a clean plates in between the starters and the meal. Would any other restaurant make you eat your main course off of your salad plate?  Very odd.  Then when trying to decided between ordering the lamb steak or chicken for our last serving, the girl talked us out of the chicken and suggested the lamb as her FAVORITE meal.  Having no concrete information on WHY this was her favorite meal should have been a giant red flag.  It was WAY too undercooked and GAMEY tasting for me.  My boyfriend described it has having to chew it 15 times before swallowing.  No to mention it was so raw I couldn&#39;t cut it with my knife.  When I told the server I thought it was gross, she just said SORRY and charged us for it.  

In past experiences the servers have been articulate, polite, and highly informative regarding the menu.   It will be a while before I go back to Pair, which is a pity because I LOVE their beef brisket.  And it&#39;s a cozy setting for a rainy date night.  Hopefully this girl will get some more training before she is left to tend the bar and customers at the same time. Previously being a waitress myself  I always tip 20%, but after spending $65.00 (no alcoholic drinks included) my boyfriend was generous enough to leave 13%.  I would have tipped %10.  Making sure your customers have a great experience should ALWAYS be #1."

The Inn provides shuttle service within a 3 mile radius, and Pair is probably only a mile or less away. So it was a good choice from where we&#39;re located. 

The restaurant is in a cozy little corner location. We visited on December 30th and there were garlands with white lights draped behind the bar. The atmosphere was was elegant, though simple. We arrived around 5:30 and the place was already packed. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. So you&#39;re taking your chances when you stop by. We asked if it was usually that busy so early and were told that from 5-7 they&#39;re usually full. Then they experience a bit of a lull before filling right up again. Happy hour is from 5 - 6:30, which explains why they get such an early start. The only space they had available when we got there were some seats at the bar (and they had to move a couple over to accomodate us). 

My husband started with the turnip soup which was fabulous! I tasted it and had to force myself to stop after awhile or I would have eaten it all. We got the Manny&#39;s Pale Ale to drink, which is a locally made beer. It was $3 for draft beers, but they only had two options. Thankfully the Manny&#39;s was delicious. I don&#39;t like beers that are too hoppy, but this one was on the calm side of hoppiness. We also got a bowl of olives as a starter. They were on the happy hour menu for only $2, but it was quite a lot of olives and they&#39;d been tossed with orange peels, a spice (cardamom?) and garlic. It was a pleasant combination. 

For our meal I had salmon on toasts and my husband had the special of the day which was large tortellini. I loved my salmon toasts. They were just the perfect amount of food (given that I also had the olives and bread with butter that they&#39;d brought ou) and they had a great flavor. My husband didn&#39;t like the tortellini as much, but it was mostly because the noodles weren&#39;t done to his liking and he admitted that he likes his noodles a lot softer than most people. 

 Since we were at the bar we had a lot of opportunities to talk to our waitress who was also the bartender. (Well, it seemed like everybody did a little of everything. So other people were mixing and pouring drinks as well. But she seemed to be the main person doing it.) She was very friendly and told us quite a bit about the restaurant. 

They have a seasonal menu so they may have entirely different items available if you go at another time of year. The food was very fresh. We didn&#39;t wait long for our food and the service was very friendly. And considering the number of dishes we got, our bill was surprisingly low - only $31. So it&#39;s definitely worth going during happy hour."

Flourless chocolate tort (delicious)

The bartender made an excellent wine selection, which we enjoyed. The pour was generous and price was reasonable--nothing ruins a good glass of wine like that &#34;ripped off feeling.&#34;

The service was excellent, including every person we interacted with. Everyone was warm, friendly, and helpful without being over attentive.

The staff and kitchen were very accommodating to gluten a nut allergy,

Atmosphere is beautiful, fit for a the cover of Bon Appetit.

Thank you Pair, you are a ten all around! You are one of the best restaurants in the city. We&#39;ll be back."

Good food, small dishes although it is still $$, so while I accept the fact that it is designed to be a &#34;European&#34; serving plate, that does not mean I enjoy this place due to that fact.
They have a fun, changing menu with the seasons and mostly anything you get WILL be delicious. While they do have a cocktails, I have personally not been super impressed with them-neither has my husband. So if you order drinks, go for the wine: definitely more of a wine place than cocktail.
It is a small cozy restaurant, with a home-like feel. I&#39;d like to give it 3.5 stars, simply because I have not been &#34;wowed&#34; by the food consistently w/ every dish that I feel this place could/should be capable of, but the service has always been attentive, &amp; wonderful."

ATMOSPHERE:
When we came in, I remember commenting to Dana W that I felt like a little kid at the grownup&#39;s table, but I&#39;ve been feeling that a lot since hitting my mid-twenties, so that might not be a reflection on the restaurant. 

The ambience was definitely intimate, more the kind of place you&#39;d take a date, your parents, or a couple really good friends on a night you want the feeling of eating at home with the luxury of service. The music was just loud enough to recognize the songs (Something by Pink Martini and Ravel&#39;s Bolero), but quiet enough to talk over without having to repeat yourself. The acoustics of the restaurant also lent the same quality to neighboring conversations; even the conversation of tables seated next to us didn&#39;t interfere with ours, and though the space was limited, we didn&#39;t feel like we were on top of anybody. 

SERVICE:
We were told it was a 45 minute wait and given menus to look at, but we were seated within 5 minutes, and greeted almost immediately by our server. Service in general was not exactly neglectful, but also not attentive. Even though I couldn&#39;t pinpoint anything specifically bad, this was the first time I considered giving less than my usual tip. 

FOOD
We had the moules frites and the steak frites. The steak was amazing: the meat was tender and juicy, and the au jus and blue cheese sauce were a perfect combination and seemed almost to hint of Chinese style meat sauce, which was a very odd experience for me (though not altogether unpleasant). The frites were not as crispy as I hoped they would be, and more a convenient way of disposing of the delicious, delicious sauce than anything else.

As for the moules; the one thing that keeps me from wholeheartedly loving shellfish is that terrible moment when you take a bite and your mouth is flooded with this nasty, grimy, sandy saltwater taste like you&#39;ve just done a face plant on the beach. Though Dana W. didn&#39;t complain about this, about 2-3 of the 4 mussels I tried had that flavor, so unfortunately I can&#39;t offer much more of a review of that- you&#39;ll have to wait for hers. 

For dessert, we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was great and topped with homemade whipped cream, but the cherries tasted like cough syrup.

BOTTOM LINE:
Pair was good, but didn&#39;t earn its reputation."

We had no trouble getting a table on a Saturday night, contrary to some of the other reviews.  

All of our food was excellent.  I can&#39;t wait to get back for more fondue!!  Serving sizes were perfect for small plates.  Enough to really enjoy each plate, but not so much that you couldn&#39;t try a handful of things - perfect for me.

My friend asked my wife and I where a good first date would be... we both said Pair. It feels like a French countryside restaurant in the middle of Seattle. You don&#39;t have to get dressed up for good food (like we actually dress up in Seattle, Polar Fleece is a sports jacket here!) 

I like sampling food instead of ordering one big dish. This place allows me to do this. The menu is just simple food, done well. I had the Frisee salad with bacon and duck egg, perfect! It was velvety and made my mouth very happy. After that, I forgot what else was going on and just enjoyed the night with my wife."

I wanted to love it!  I had read reviews and looked over the menu and was anticipating a new favorite!  Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t.  The good/positive: cute place!!  Small but nice and open floor plan.  Food was good, especially the gougeres and the sauce that came with potato slices. Meh: We tried all but one HH item.  Despite other reviewers&#39; raves about the Mac and cheese, it seemed just ok.  Mostly pasta and bread crumbs, but with good flavor.  The sliders were most unfortunate: 3 about the size of a 50 cent piece each (seriously) and less than a teaspoon of &#34;brisket&#34; between all 3, so about 98% bread.  I mean way less, could hardly find it!  The other unfortunate part was that when we arrived, the place was about 15% full, yet the hostess said she&#39;d be right with us, walked to the bar area and chatted, did something with glasses, came back to the front and then returned to the bar to pick up what appeared to be two water glasses and delivered them to a table, then got back to us about 5 mins later.  She seats us two feet away which took all of 10 seconds.  Weird.
I might try it again, but with so many other choices out there, probably not.
We still had a good time, though!  :). I&#39;m giving 3 stars for the setting and our server was good, and food was pretty good.
Sorry, I am probably more critical than most reviewers!"

Pair should remain here forever as little decent froggy bistro in this neighborhood.  Perhaps the only nice little restaurant in the neighborhood and is therefore the only real choice when you don&#39;t feel like making dinner, tell your girl to get hotted up because you&#39;re taking her for some French food to be followed by other assorted French activities.

I found it nice, but that might have just been the bacon talking.  They were employing a lot of the standard big winning French culinary gorillas here, so it was a nice dinner all around."

We arrived right at 5:00 and the restaurant was pretty full by 6 (and it&#39;s important to note they don&#39;t take reservations for parties of less than 6). The food was all very good and the service was amazingly fast and attentive. My sidecar was definitely not as good as I expected (it wasn&#39;t BAD, just not well-balanced) and I wasn&#39;t excited about the banana bread pudding (though my boyfriend loved it). It was great to end the meal with good, strong coffee and creme brulee (good thing we tried two desserts!). I would certainly recommend it for a nice dinner with friends or a date.

I rated 3 stars because of the price and portion. I know this restaurant is a &#34;small/tasting plate&#34; kind of place, but the size of the plate does not justify the price.

The sliders and brisket are delish! I love their horseradish, so yummy! Not overpowering in taste, just the right amount of &#34;kick&#34;. The cheese plate is also good. This is the first place I&#39;ve had cheese served with honey. It was totally unexpected, but it works so well together. It was a great unexpected flavor in my mouth. Who knew honey and cheese would be a great combination? 

I do like Pair and I will always go back, but the price definitely hits the pocket even with happy hour! Even though your bill may be a bit pricey, this shouldn&#39;t prevent anyone from trying this place out at least once!"

I missed there not being any fish dishes when we were there over the weekend, but the crab ravioli was a highlight. The steak frites is always perfect, and the sliders are a no brainer.

The presentation of the food is great, and I guess what you order is really gonna make a difference in how you feel about the food.  My suggestion, don&#39;t order off the happy hour menu, because the people sitting next to us didn&#39;t and their food was apparently amazing.  We had the brisket sliders with horseradish fraiche (the buns and brisket were dry...but the fraiche was super tasty), the mac and cheese  which was too salty and bland for my taste, the pommes frites, and the heirloom tomato salad with balsamic reduction (which was the only REALLY yummy item).

Their happy hour runs from 5-630, Tues-Sat (they are closed Sun/Mon). We ordered practically everything from the HH small plates menu: 

Herb &amp; Cheese Gougères: Amazing, light and fluffy biscuits. Not too greasy, balanced flavors.
Tomato soup &amp; polenta panini with cheese and caramelized onion: Couldn&#39;t believe the &#34;panini&#34; was made of polenta. So crispy and somehow didn&#39;t fall apart. The soup could stand on its own.
Brisket sliders, horseradish crème frâiche &amp; shallots: I would like to put the horseradish creme fraiche on EVERYTHING. The horseradish wasn&#39;t too over powering... but enough to add a little bite.
Fontina mac &amp; cheese: deliciously decadent. The breadcrumbs are crunchy and garlicky.

All of their food is under $5. They have great house wines at $5 a glass and other good drink specials ($1 off house cocktails, $6 sidecars and $3 pints of beer)

We came for happy hour, delicious red wine from Abruzzi fro $5 and some warmed green/black olives in oil for $2 can&#39;t be beat. Flat water in glass bottles and pine nuts completed the appetizers treat. Sitting at the bar, the bartenders seemed over worked for such a small space, but the service was professional, polite and friendly. Really interesting selection of alcohols at the bar that would also make this for a fun tasting experience.

Did drinks and appetizers before a movie, potato gnocchi was light and fluffy with a slightly crunchy outside in this wild yellow butter sauce that was amazing (and great for dipping some of their bread in). 

I highly recommend it for Happy Hour and want to come back with no time restraints to sit through a full meal and enjoy the experience.

Upon entering, the restaurant seemed quaint and lovely and had a nice ambiance. We had to wait about 20 minutes for table on a bench near the back of the restaurant, which was a little weird, but worth the wait.

We both ordered a glass of wine to start and were served a bread basket while we looked at the menu. We decided on the brisket, steak frites, mushroom risotto and the lamb meatballs. The mushroom risotto was delicious and I could have eaten two more plates of that stuff! Also, the steak frites was insane and my husband closed his eyes each time he had a bite of the delicious steak w/ blue cheese and wine reduction. The brisket was also delicious, the lamb was a little underwhelming after all that flavorful meat, but I still liked it. We ordered the creme brulee and flour less chocolate cake for dessert and both were again, delicious. Overall the food was great quality and I would definitely go back for a special occasion.

The fondue was also quite good.

A few of the items probably aren&#39;t worth the price and size, the brocolini was one. I also have to give them props on the cocktails- they were surprisingly inventive and exceeded my expectations for a wine bar.

When visiting a city for the first time I make sure to do my research on the best of the best and this was second to Canlis which was unfortunately, booked on the weekend I went. We sat at the chef&#39;s counter which is a cozy alternative to your standard white tablecloth dining and gives you a closer look at the dishes being meticulously prepared. 

Here&#39;s the negative: Their wine list is not impressive at all. The sommelier wasn&#39;t very helpful on finding a wine that would pair well with the dishes or to your palate for that matter. Instead I found myself compromising for a glass that I did not like.

As far as the 15 courses, it&#39;s with extreme pity that I say I was not floored by any of it. None of them seem memorable and that makes me sad because I had such high expectations for this establishment. Perhaps an off night?

The dishes I will say are in fact very creative, complex and have a wide range of textures. The chefs are young, bright and very passionate about their craft. Seattle has an incredible food scene- but perhaps Altura needs some fine tuning before they can send you home $800 lighter."

I won&#39;t go line-by-line through every course. In general, the food was creative, interesting, and tasty. Many diverse dishes, textures, and concepts. The quality was quite appropriate for the tasting menu price... I&#39;ve seen similar quality go for more cash. The service was attentive, personal, and warm too. They let us take a few of the dessert items home when we were full, so they weren&#39;t too snobby about it. We left smiling.

But several details prevent me from giving 5 stars, especially given the higher price of this restaurant:

The &#34;finger foods&#34; are a fun start - all tasty - but no wet nap or towel was offered after those courses to clean our fingers.

My date thought many dishes were overseasoned - too salty.

Perhaps my sense of taste is simply unrefined but I did not understand the flow and overall theme of the courses. Same for the visual aesthetic of the interior decor and plating.

Finally, perhaps the chef is catering to a US demographic he understands better than I do, but the desserts lacked the elegance of earlier dishes. They were out of place in terms of aesthetic and portion size. My palate was totally overwhelmed with sugar. I would have much preferred a gentler ending, more of a transition than a body slam of sweets.

Overall a solid 4 stars and a special meal we&#39;ll remember."

I was undecided between 4 and 5 stars, but I decided to go with 5 because I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get an experience as close as this offers anywhere else in Seattle. Frankly speaking, if this restaurant was in San Francisco or New York City, it would likely be a 4 in my book.

Food was 5. Beverages/Service/Ambiance were 4.

The food itself was fabulous. Just as spectacular as some of my favorite restaurants in the country like Saison, Benu, French Laundry, Grace and Alinea, to name a few. Altura has eliminated the 3-course offering and the a la carte offering altogether, so now, there is only a prix fixe menu at $137 per person. There were several little bites and amuse bouches at the beginning, leading into dishes with more substance like the Beet in Bone Marrow (amazing), Risotto (great but tiny), and the Lamb (probably the stand out!). The Lamb  definitely hit the climax of the meal - thoughtfully crafted with playful flavors on the plate. They seasoned just the lamb bone with some salt and sugar, which really was awesome- tasted like buttery candy cane-meaty-goodness. Then came a pretty good cheese course, and fairly standard desserts and mignardises at the end (no particular stand outs here). 

I think where the restaurant fell short was in the beverages/service department. To charge $95 for a Drink Paring that includes spirits/ciders/wine and $162 for a Traditional Wine Pairing- I expect excellence. The drinks in the $95 drink pairing my fiancee got were pretty good but not excellent. And my wine pairing was mediocre at best. I lived in Italy for 8 years, and the Nebbiolo, one of my fav grapes, was awful here. Pretty much all the wines weren&#39;t good here, except for the last round to wind down our meal which included Nonino Grappa (one of my all-time fav Grappas actually) and Moscato D&#39;asti (can&#39;t go wrong with a sweet dessert wine). In regards to service -  it was very attentive and professional, but not very warm and friendly. Ambiance was cozy and inviting- a lot more casual than I anticipated actually, yet still wonderful for a date night/small group special outing.

All in all, I really enjoyed my dinner at Altura and each dish was beautiful, original, and delicious, but I can&#39;t help but think that the wines didn&#39;t complement the entire experience, and at $675 out the door for two- I really was expecting perfection. If I were to return, which I very much hope to do, I will be bringing my own bottle or opting for a mix of spirits/wines by the glass instead.

Finally- as a small note- I really had wished they gave us a copy of the food and drink pairing menus. I save all menus from my fine dining experiences and it was my first time the restaurant didn&#39;t provide one at the beginning nor end of the meal, very unusual."

However, I find that I rate restaurants against other restaurants of their type so, in fairness I have to rate this against some of the higher end dining I have experienced.

The ONLY reason I am giving 4 stars vs 5 is the dollar to experience equation. It is an exceptional meal, but was over $500 with the wine pairing for 2 people not including our tip. My main comparison here is with Castagna in Portland, also an unreal dining experience with pairings that ended up at 21 courses for a mere $400. Anyways, if you want to have a very very special meal, one for the memory bank, this is a great one, I just think they should more closely evaluate the end price point. Service and staff are excellent! It really is a nice experience! We sat at a table this time but next time I think we would opt for the counter which is right on the kitchen.

Here are the goods from the jan 20 Chefs Tasting Menu:

Osetra Caviar, Shigoku oyster, smoked sturgeon and prosecco sabayon paired with Bodegas Muga &#34;Casa Conde de Haro&#34; Brut Cava 2011

Mediterranean Mussel wrapped in house cured Pancetta smoked with Madrona Bark - really great!

Roosevelt Elk Crudo with black trumpet mushrooms and white truffle snow paired with San Lorenzo &#34;Le Oche&#34; Verdicchio Dei Castelli Di Jesi Classico Honestly I am all the way in ANY time Elk is on board!

Steelhead Roe arugula and fermented potato. This was really a stunner. Arguably the firmest Roe I have ever had....it was stellar!

Ezo Black Abalone with sweet garlic burnt honey and pigs feet braised in apple juice. Paired with Hexamer &#34;Meddersheimer Rheingrafenberg Riesling Hochgewachs. Great bite and great pairing! One of the best Riesling I have ever had and perfect for this portion of the meal.

Agnolotti Dal Plin Dungeness Crab and Spicy Brodo paired with Antica Masseria Venditti &#34;Assenza&#34; Falanghina Del Sannio. The whole thing was great but the Brodo was particularly amazing!

Columbia City Filone baked in Cartoccio with black winter truffle and duck liver

Tortellini Bone Marrow Roasted Beets, Dill Pollen, Elderberry Wine paired with Moric Reserve Blaufrankisch. This was one of the highlights for me. Just spot on all the way through!

Kiwi Sorbet grappa blood orange. Beautiful and light packed with flavor!

Magnolia Farms True Wagyu Beef winter roots and braised greens paired with Buckhorn Cabernet Sauvignon. Really a beautiful and delicious dish, but quite light on the protein. It was done perfectly but typically there would be 75 percent more on the protein as I look at this as the &#34;main course&#34;. Really great though!

Gorgonzola Dolce Bosc Pear Crispy Sage Black Pepper Honey. One of the best bites of the night. Really creative and perfect in every way.

Satsuma Passion Fruit, Vanilla, Meringue paired with Elvio Tintero &#34;Sori Gramella&#34; Moscato D&#39;Asti

Affogato Roman style Hot Chocolate, Mascarpone Gelato. Wow!

This is a great place if you want a splurge that is on bar with some of the best tasting menus around, if you want to impress that significant other, it is really enjoyable. I think everyone should have a splurge on dining from time to time. Next time I will probably just order off the menu unless a little price eval takes place though."

Went for a 30th birthday dinner. Did not intent to order off the tasting menu, as it&#39;s all or nothing for the whole table. But, one person wanted the tasting menu so we caved, and so glad that we decided to order the tasting menu. 

The icing on the cake was not the fact that the whole dining experience was top notch, but you get to have a copy of the whole menu take home. So, don&#39;t worry about memorizing what you just got served as you can look back on it afterwards!"

You can choose from small list of menu items with wine pairing or truffle inspired choices at set prices for both. Truffle menu is $197 per guest and you get a wide variety of truffle dishes prepared by the chef for the entire table. I opted for the $73 three courses meal with appetizer, entree and dessert with wine pairing.

It started with Chicory Salad which was small enough and just the right amount of balsmico. The chef served us a complimentary duck liver appetizer. Nice job chef.  Entree was Neah Bay Ling Cod prepared on top of roasted cauliflower, crispy polenta, caper, lemon and diavolicchio. And finally dessert was Meyer Lemon in Velo (fancy lemon pie). 

It was delicious from end to end for sure. Friendly staff, good atmosphere and excellent menu. I will return definitely and try the truffle inspired dishes."

The service I received at Altura was lack luster at best. First, after holding me captive by holding my credit card during the reservation process, I was told I had to wait 30 mins for my table to be ready. I was told multiple times that they would make it up to us for waiting so long (they never did).

Having to wait for a table is not a big deal in my book, however the entire meal took 4 hours! I am all for an experience, but sitting 30 mins in between very small portions was horrible. We even had to take a dessert course to go after the 4 hours. We ended up spending 500 dollars on our meal and since it look so long for everything to come out it was hardly satisfying. We were really hoping to indulge (including cost) but what we received just sent us away upset and bummed we had such an &#34;off&#34; night. A horrible feeling to have after paying so much. 

Our hostess and waiter both kept apologizing to us throughout the evening, but nothing was ever done. That being said the overall taste of the food was great. But only expect a taste. I would much rather have few courses with less time in between and more to eat. 

Also if you read on zagat that you can order a la carte here- you can&#39;t. Strictly pre fix"

We chose to dine at a table and not at the chefs&#39; viewing seats but the restaurant is narrowly shaped so everybody has a view of the chefs at the least (minus their hands at work). 
Their oyster soup is creatively presented and one of their best dishes IMO. One amuse-bouch was salted, fried gnocchi, which was MY JAM. A couple entrees were too salty, some left us underwhelmed and altogether kept us slightly hungry afterwards, hence the 4 star rating. For $73 per person, my expectations were high. I do appreciate their acknowledgement of my mom&#39;s birthday, though. They presented her with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sprinkled with salt."

The tasting was $137 per person and totally worth it. The flavors went well together and each plate was visually stunning. The plating was done on a variety of things and the utensils were unique too. The meal took about 3 hours and is truly meant to be enjoyed. Out of all the courses the abalone was our favorite with the flat fried cheese course being the worst. After filling up on so many courses I&#39;m glad dessert was not chocolate related and a lighter cheesecake. Reservations recommended in advance for Altura.

We had made a reservation to dine here during our visit to Seattle.  When we arrived, promptly at 6pm, we were told that we would need to wait for at least 30 minutes. This started us off on the wrong foot.  About 15-20 minutes into our wait, a place for two opened up at the counter and we were offered those spots.  We begrudgingly took them, as we were informed they really didn&#39;t know when a table was going to open up - maybe another 30 minutes.  OK...So that is a huge negative.  You should honor your reservations.  That said, this inconvenience turned out to be a gift.  

What we didn&#39;t realize because it was so crowded, was seating at the counter was for the Che&#39;f counter.  So we wound up getting to see every one of our courses created and crafted in front of us.  We got to engage the Chef/Owner in conversation.  He seemed to be a good guy and cared about his restaurant and was passionate about his food.  He wound up giving us a few little extras along the way too.  

I would definitely take the time to dine here if you are in the area.  If I return to Seattle, I certainly will"

A good comparison at an identical price point is Ryunique in Seoul, a city which also lacks Michelin ratings (for now) and also has an overall less formal dining culture. 

We arrived in time for our reservation and were informed that they didn&#39;t have a table available for us, and the only option was the counter. As a heads up, if you are a couple you will most likely be seated at the counter, as it looked like nearly all of the tables were of small groups. We offered to come back, but they said they could seat us at the counter for now, buy us a cocktail, and serve the small bite courses while we waited. Fair enough.

As an additional heads-up the entire restaurant is extremely loud, no matter where you sit. If you like to watch chefs in action, you might enjoy sitting at the counter. However, comfort is another story. The bar stools looked pretty but were oddly tippy, and the design didn&#39;t allow one to lean back to use the backrest without tipping back. I also had to sit forward to use the footrest, but of course this probably wouldn&#39;t be a problem for the lucky tall people out there.
The service of the small plates was extremely rushed, and the bites piled up faster than I could eat them. Descriptions of the dishes reminded me of the Micro Machines guy (revealing my age here, but whatevs). If I returned, I&#39;d ask for the menu up front so I would know what I was eating. 

After about an hour, my legs had predictably fallen asleep and we were asked at least three times if we still wanted a table (nope, that was my wanting a table joke) but once we were seated, the table was fine. However, service continued to include random awkward moments, such as one server sounding annoyed when they asked the other to take the lid off of a dish. The most polished service was from the man refilling the water, who needs to be promoted ASAP.

Despite some weirdness, the food was mostly good to fantastic, with the lamb being the highlight as one of the top red meat dishes I&#39;ve ever had. There were, however, also a few disasters. I am obsessed with truffles, but the truffle butter was so salty that I was tempted to spit out the bite--luckily, there were only a couple of bad dishes, and my husband will literally eat anything, so nothing went to waste.

More awkwardness followed (lost count of how many times the free drink was brought up--seriously?) but dessert followed as well, which was bomb.com

I may return in the future when it&#39;s likely that the tasting menu has significantly changed to try the chef&#39;s new recipes, but at this price point I hope an improvement in comfort, service, and pacing goes along with the new dishes."

Food: They no longer do ala carte...so Chef decided what we ate the night. I got to try a lot of different flavors I hadn&#39;t before, the presentation was great on every plate, at over $130 a person it isn&#39;t cheap (excluding drinks), I was a little worried that I would leave disappointed by either what I tasted or by the quantity of food but everything tasted great and the food just kept on coming. I lost count at one point but I think I tried over 10 items. I definitely did not feel that I didn&#39;t get my money&#39;s worth; plate count was perfect. I cannot speak for the experience when you add drinks. Keep in mind though that this place is better suited to &#34;foodies&#34; or those looking for unique culinary tastes as opposed to someone craving say, an expensive steak (better off at a steak house). 

I was also very impressed by the kitchen&#39;s attention to our pace: we kept finishing our plates pretty fast (arrived hungry) and with the exception of the time it took to get our first plate, I never felt that I waited too long for the next. 

Bravo to the kitchen too for exceptional attention to our dietary restrictions (I noted that only one of us required gluten-free, though not celiac, as well as no pork when I made my reservation). Not only did they ensure this on every plate for me, they also made sure that I didn&#39;t feel left out when the other person got their &#39;regular&#39; item. In other words, they didn&#39;t just eliminate wheat/pork, they replaced it something else that complemented the dish just as well. 

The open kitchen is cool, great to see the chefs at work.

I&#39;m trying very hard to think of note-worthy things to say about how I could have had a better experience here, but i&#39;m coming up short. Though in my opinion, minor CONS, i will add though that the restaurant is small and it will be a little uncomfortable at first sitting very close to the couple on the table next to you. This isn&#39;t ideal. 
Last, parking can also be a pain (its capitol hill after all). So in short, if i were to change anything, it would be its location....and that, in the grand scheme of things, isn&#39;t really that bad at all."

We&#39;re from San Francisco and like most San Francisco people we are food snobs LOL We wanted a unique and intimate experience and that&#39;s what we got. There is no menu so if you have food allergies you can let them know in advance. I would recommend sitting at the chef&#39;s counter and going in with an open mind and hungry. They do take reservations and do them in advance! 

It took a little over 3 hours to finish everything and we didn&#39;t even realize it. All the courses that came out were delicious, some were better than others. There were a few that I personally did not like but that doesn&#39;t mean it was bad. Everyone tastes food differently. 

The service was on point. Our server was very sweet and more than attentive. The chef and the other &#34;chefs,&#34; work incredibly hard and put a lot of detail into their food. Even though they are right in front of you they are working on their plate they&#39;re so focused. I never felt obligated to start a conversation. 

The wine by the glass options was the only thing that was tough for me. Their selection is not traditional but I still found something to drink, hey it&#39;s wine! 

Perfect spot for a romantic evening. We will definitely be coming back if we&#39;re up in Seattle again!"

Definitely one of my favorite spots in Seattle and I&#39;d venture to say some of the best food I&#39;ve ever had. Haven&#39;t been able to splurge on the tasting menu yet but everything I&#39;ve had off the three course menu has been superb. I love that you can mix and match from different sections to order exactly what you want. The flavors in every dish, from appetizers, to main dish, to dessert... Especially dessert... Will blow your mind. We asked for an intermezzo pallet cleanser before our dessert, even that was had unique flavors and so delicious. 

The ambiance is nice. Intimate and welcoming. For the price I&#39;d expect a little more but I do enjoy sitting down and enjoying my meal without being rushed. This isn&#39;t the place where you get in and out, instead sit back, relax and enjoy the night. 

I came here 3 times, twice for special occasions and once just because. Its expensive, and just didn&#39;t feel worth it unless we were celebrating something that was worth really splurging on.

That being said, the food and the service are both incredible and this was simply the best dining experience my wife and I have ever had. We also were sat at the counter in front of Nathan Lockwood the Chef and although at first this felt less than ideal for a romantic night, but at the end of the night we were glad this is where we landed. We chatted with Nathan throughout the night and watched as these beautiful dishes were prepared.

The food seemed overly complicated. I&#39;d say I enjoyed roughly half of the menu which is pretty bad considering the cost and time committed to have dinner here. Some of the dishes I could only eat parts. The nut coated, duck liver bite was gross. The green shaved ice tasted like black licorice. One dessert came with a dill sauce that was odd. 

I really enjoyed the fermented potato, wrapped tuna, charcuterie board, ezo black abalone, chocolate truffle and one dish that came with a spatula to scrape all the good stuff from the plate which was fantastic. 

Dinner took over 3 hours and while we expected 2.5-3 hrs, service was pretty consistent the first 1.5-2 hrs and hit a wall. At first came a flurry of bites. Then a few small plates. Then a big gap between 2 and 3 hrs with maybe 1-2 dishes and then dessert came all at once. With this many courses/dishes it should be better paced. There were about 12-15 bites/plates/courses in total. We were hoping it would end at about the 2.5 hr mark as we were full and not enjoying the novelty anymore. 

Our service was very good at first but as more people arrived, people stopped coming by and at one point took our empty wine glasses but never asked us if we wanted any more wine. We were already over 2 hrs into dinner so we just decided we were done. 

I think you&#39;d have to be really adventurous to enjoy the whole menu. It&#39;s tough because I&#39;m sure other nights we might have enjoyed more but not knowing what&#39;s on the menu night-to-night seems like a very expensive roll of the dice."

From the caviar and oyster dish with potato foam that was salty and brash with starchy, sticky, unpleasantly textured potato, to the lamb chop with looked perfectly medium rare only to cut into it and realize it was illusory - it was an end piece that was hiding the fact it was well done, to the 3 bites of agnolloti in sugo that were so salty we drained our water glasses twice over.  

To top it off, the pacing of the tasting menu wavered, with uneven service.  Sometimes we received a nice pacing of dishes, but other times there were long breaks between courses, so long that by the end we were eager to leave.  The other part of service that was interesting was the open kitchen concept.  In this particular open kitchen, it didn&#39;t seem like the chefs likes or enjoyed being so close to the diners.  There was extremely limited interaction between the kitchen and the patrons, other than presenting dishes, as if there was an invisible wall between the two.  One of the reasons we like open kitchens and chefs tables is the informality that comes with them, the ability to talk to the chefs for a few minutes throughout a tasting menu and get and understanding for the dishes and menu."

Without a shadow of a doubt, the meal that we had at Altura was the absolute best meal of the trip. In fact, it was one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. 

I am no stranger when it comes to Italian food. I taught myself how to make handmade pasta, gnocchi, risotto and all kinds of sauces. Back in Hawaii, I eat a lot of Italian food. I&#39;ve eaten Italian in many places including New York, San Fran, Austin, Anaheim, Juneau, Portland, Washington DC.. you get the idea. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve been eating all my life, but it wasn&#39;t as good as the stuff from Altura.

For $67, you can choose your own 3 course meal. The only stipulation is that only one entree can be chosen. If you want an entree and two desserts, so be it. I love this flexible menu and wish more restaurants would adopt it. 

We each tried three different courses and closed the night with THE most amazing dessert I have ever eaten. Details are below:

AMUSE BOUCHE:
This was complimentary: fennel panna cotta with beets and a parsley foam. Oh my god.. so delicious

GRASSFED BEEF CRUDO:
I was expecting a carpaccio of sorts, but it came out looking like a beef tartare. Once it hit my mouth, I didn&#39;t care what it looked like because it was absolutely delicious

RISOTTO:
There were wild mushrooms and foraged greens. Also a foam and some peas. The rice was perfect and it tasted lighter than most risottos I&#39;ve made and eaten elsewhere. Delicious. This was the best risotto I have ever eaten.

GNOCCHI:
Wagyu and lamb ragu? Done. Healthy shavings of cheese? Done. The gnocchi was perfect. So light and pillowy. Clouds of heaven to be sure. Delicious. This was the best gnocchi I have ever eaten.

PAPARDELLE:
There was also a ragu in this dish. This one was made of tripe and oxtail and some spice. It was amazing. The pasta was perfect and helped gather up all the amazing goodness. This was the best papardelle I have ever eaten.

ZABUTON STEAK:
Its hard to describe this one. Yes, it was delicious, but it also tasted so clean. Lots of flavor and very filling

RABBIT FIVE WAYS:
The most I&#39;ve ever eaten rabbit before was one way. This dish had various parts laid out in a beautiful presentation. Wrapped in cabbage, chicken fried, rack of rabbit, kidney, wrapped in bacon.. they were all amazing. In a night of standout dishes, this one stood out slightly more and it was also the best rabbit I have ever eaten.

MEYER LEMON IN VELO:
Any additional dishes would be $11 more. I&#39;m glad we decided that we could handle dessert. Words cannot describe how amazing this dish is. The flavors were so intense and the dessert itself I found to be very velvety. This was the perfect end to an amazing meal and to no ones surprise, this was the best dessert I&#39;ve ever had. 

I would suggest anyone who is even remotely into food to come here. Sit at the bar like we did so you can witness the action of Chef Nathan Lockwood and his team first hand. You will not regret this decision. Altura is now on my list of permanent fixtures every time I come to Seattle and it should be on yours as well."
altura-seattle,Quyen V.,DV8r9FhLv6Ay5pSkvgainQ,"Seattle, WA",1,1,0,124,55,FFV1qmNSY0L5S9ZvHsmq6Q,5.0,2016-04-06,"Wow. Just wow. If Seattle restaurants were included in the Michelin ratings, Altura would most definitely earn its stars. 

There are several different menu options for dinner at Altura. You can go with 3 courses for $75, or the tasting menu (roughly 12-14 courses) for $137. Yes, it&#39;s quite pricey for a tasting menu, but you would be extremely remiss to order anything else, in my opinion. If you&#39;re trying to make the decision, let me put it simply: you&#39;re within moments of ordering an extremely unique and memorable culinary experience, which may possibly be one of the best in Seattle. Why sell yourself short?

I love open kitchen concepts in general, and Altura is no exception. I would absolutely request a counter seat when making your reservation, as it is well worth it to watch the dishes being constructed with care. There was almost a theatricality to it as well, and I mean that in the most complimentary way -- every detail was painstakingly attended to, and carefully coordinated and led by Chef Nathan. I really felt like watching the preparation significantly added to our experience. 

The tasting menu itself is centered around 5 main plates, with the others being smaller amuses-bouches or accentuating accompaniments. One of my pet peeves at tasting menu restaurants is that the portions can be so exasperatingly small that even after you end up forking over a significant amount of money for dinner, you still feel like you have to fill up at a fast food joint afterward because the teeny tiny morsels of food simply weren&#39;t filling enough (tell me you haven&#39;t been there!). I am beyond pleased to report that there was no danger of this happening at Altura. The meal was paced well, with an astonishing amount of variety while still leaving us very full and satisfied at the conclusion. I honestly don&#39;t think I could have taken another bite, and that&#39;s not something that usually happens for me at tasting menu restaurants, ever.

The menu on the night we visited had 14 courses (they provide you with a printed menu at the end of your meal). This included:
1. Osetra caviar with arugula and fermented potato
2. Steelhead roe with shigoku oyster, smoked sturgeon, and white asparagus sabayon
3. Mediterranean mussel wrapped in house cured pancetta, smoked with madrona bark
4. Wagyu beef crudo with pickled turnips, wild onions, parmesan
5. Carabinieri with porcini, popcorn
6. Risotto with juniper smoked pigeon, aged catelmagno, and kale
7. Stinging nettle farfalle with dungeness crab, mussel sformato
8. Columbia city filone baked in cartoccio, black winter truffle, and duck liver
9. Tortelloni with bone marrow roasted beets, dill pollen, elderberry wine
10. Kiwi sorbet with grappa, blood orange
11. Dry-aged pleasant view duck breast with winter roots, braised greens, spicy pickled cherries
12. Gorgonzola dolce with bosc pear, crispy sage, black pepper honey
13. Variations of winter citrus with lingonberry, vanilla, meringue
14. Adffogato with roman hot chocolate, mascarpone gelato

Overall, the flavors were extremely well balanced and showcased seasonal and local flavors. Chef Nathan clearly takes great pride in unexpected and unique flavor combinations, which I think is well highlighted in this meal. Presentation was also a delight: an example included the smoked sturgeon, which was brought out in a miniature smoke-filled glass dome and unveiled by our server. These are magical moments that only the most special of restaurants can evoke, and Altura therefore earns its seat among the culinary greats."

The tasting menu we had recently was weird with flavors and textures not pairing favorably. The service... what happened to the excellent service?

I had the pappardelle. Insane! Just insane! Spicy too. Wagyu beef is to die for. Risotto with morels, fiddleheads, fava beans, ramps, asparagus, pea shoots, garlic spears, all the things that make Seattle the best culinary in the USA. You are going to have an excellent dinner.

LOVED:

The ambience.  Many high-end restaurants will have an air about them that feels unwelcoming.  We did not feel this at all.  In fact, the decor probably did help as a more industrial West Coast decor.

The service was en pointe - utensils and plates changed between each meal, water was refilled with good cadence, they didn&#39;t miss a beat with us that night.

The pace of the servings.  It was a 14-course tasting menu. Each was small, and they gave us enough time to savour, and definitely enough time in between to yearn.

Food experience - I don&#39;t know how else to say it, but the menu truly does the taste no justification.  Each bite was full of all different kinds of flavours, and textures, and crumbliness....delicious.  Just try this place!

One of the best (if not the best) tasting experiences.  Thank you!"

We were the first people to show up at the restaurant and were seated at the bar...Shortly after, the restaurant filled up! Get your reservations, folks.

We did the tasting menu with the beverage/wine pairing. I&#39;ve never encountered a staff that was so knowledgeable about beverage pairings. In addition to wine, it also came with champagne, cocktails, and a few beers. 

The meal was excellent from start to finish. Because we sat at the bar, the kitchen staff seemed to go the extra mile to time our food. I really loved watching them prepare each plate. We even got to meet the head chef/owner (and of course, we sung our praises). Each bite was flavorful and well-planned. Each step of the meal played into the larger scheme of the overall feast.

I was so full by the end, but couldn&#39;t leave without finishing each bite. Definitely come to Altura for A+ food, service, and ambiance. Couldn&#39;t have asked for a better experience!"

We showed up on a busy Friday night to celebrate my wife&#39;s birthday, only to be told we had missed our reservation -- it turned out I had booked it for Thursday by mistake and didn&#39;t notice. Completely my fault! No worries, they found seating for us anyway.

We sat at the counter, as a) that was available, and b) that&#39;s what we wanted anyway, as I had read recommendations for this arrangement. Good choice! We were right in front of the chef, and watching him and his crew in action was a bit like observing controlled chaos playing out. Yet, in spite of being so busy, everyone was very professional, and even found time for small bits of humor and to interact with the counter customers. The wait staff were similarly professional and courteous, and I was impressed with how well everyone navigated through what is really a very small and quite full space.

We opted for the &#34;tasting menu,&#34; which is basically offering yourself up to the chef&#39;s choices, and we were not disappointed. Multiple small courses over about 3 hours left us very satisfied, full but not over-stuffed, and every course was delicious. If you want the full experience, I recommend this option.

I took the wine pairings as well, and the sommelier seems to really know his stuff. &#34;Wine&#34; is perhaps a misnomer, as there was also an ale in the mix for one course. Most unusual and well-done was the pairing of a sweet moscato with a peppery gorgonzola, where the opposing flavors highlighted each other in an unexpected way.

The room and kitchen are both small, and diners are at their tables for a few hours to get through the entire experience, so they don&#39;t seat many people per night. Despite the close quarters, though, the ambiance is very welcoming and the staff manage to be unobtrusive as they weave between the tables and to the counter, where we sat. It doesn&#39;t feel too crowded when you&#39;re inside.

Highly recommended."

But for a restaurant at this level, I wasn&#39;t completely impressed. Everything from the amuse bouche to the entree was good, but just slightly underwhelming. Their beer list is interesting with a number of large format bottle options, but a bit  narrow overall. For the first few courses we got elk crudo (fine), salsify soup (very good), pumpkin risotto (fine), and gnocchi (pretty good). Entrees were wagyu beef (fine) and pork shank (pretty good). Dessert was bourbon caramel semifreddo which was quite nice. The service was attentive, but a bit stuffy and uncomfortable for such a casual environment.

All around, its a very nice restaurant and if you were looking for something upscale but inventive in the area, it would be a good pick. We just didn&#39;t walk away enthralled with any of our food selections."

Fresh, beautifully crafted Italian food with unique ingredients in a small restaurant with an intimate ambiance.  We splurged and had the pasta with Alba truffle shavings, followed by Wagyu beef fillet (and salad/dessert). We selected the three course meal, not the tasting menu.

Service was good, however I was on a dinner outing with an older male &#34;foodist&#34; friend of mine, and the server was definitely deferring to him, i.e angling the wine bottle label to his side of the table, addressing him first when explaining the wine, food etc. Please don&#39;t make any assumptions when a pair is dining, as I was just as interested in the wine and was indeed fully capable of paying what turned out to be a $350 each including tax and tip when we split the bill."

My friends booked a table here for my last night in Seattle (moved to Austin).  Because we were a party of six, they advised we would have to do the chef&#39;s tasting menu that was pre set.  I have a pretty unrefined palate and when I saw the menu I have to admit I was confused and worried. Give me a nice bowl of pasta and I am happy.  Then I caught wind of the price and I proceeded to do everything I could to talk my friends into something else.  THANK GOD they didn&#39;t listen to me.

This dinner was nothing short of amazing.  There were 10 courses (or small bites) that covered ever taste you could imagine.  A few of my favorites:

- Grassfed Beef Crudo
- Frito Misto (note - has nothing to do with chips)
- Wagyu Beef
- Every single desert!

This is a place you go to have your taste buds dazzled and to experience food the way it was intended.  For smaller groups, they have many options in terms of the number of bites you can order.  Their wine and cocktail options were top notch and the sommelier will help you pair the best options if you choose.

Altura came heavily recommended and I was looking forward to eating here for the preceding two weeks, but I was left completely shocked by my experience. The aperitivo - apple juice with cardamom and fennel - was wonderful and the amuse bouche of potato with bottarga and arugula pesto was just heavenly. I was ready to get the party started! 

I might have put a little more faith in the restaurant than I should have and ordered things I would normally not have ordered, but even taking that into consideration the dishes were downright terrible. First was the Tajarin with wild boar ragu and brown butter. This pasta was intensely rich and overly salted (and I&#39;m a person who is accused of over salting their food). There was only one note to the dish with no acidity or brightness to cut the fat or salt. I forced myself to eat it to be polite, but the only thing I wanted to do afterwards was brush my teeth! Things only got worse. I got the pork shank with braised greens and angry egg. Again, INTENSELY salty and fatty with not a single note of anything fresh and bright for relief. The greens were also too salty, the bitterness was compounded by zest of something - lemon or orange? It was simply horrific. 

Afterwards we had the lemon velo and caramel semifreddo. They were just average desserts. Definitely not anything I would consider calling the &#34;best dessert I ever had&#34; like other reviewers have said. Really? That was the best dessert you ever had? I think a graham cracker easily tops either of those desserts. The lemon velo was too sweet, the fruits on top seemed modified in some unnecessary way, and the whole thing made me thirsty. The semifreddo was good, but nothing I would consider ordering again. 

Overall there are much better restaurants in Seattle at this price point."

Moreover, every course (and mind you, I believe there were a total of 11 or 12) was fantastic.  The attention paid by the waitstaff and moreover Chef Lockwood was beyond reproach. My only beef with the meal was the beverage pairings. My wife had the classic wine pairing (for 165) and I had the modern beverage pairing (for 95). We do a number of wine pairings at some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas and in retrospect this was WAY overpriced for what was served.

The other option is $73 for - 3-course prefixed meal. The food was good, but most dishes are so &#34;busy&#34;, including 10 or more ingredients. The beef tartare, which claimed to have bone marrow, was mediocre at best. Same can be said for the liver pate. The pasta I chose was rigatoni with oxtail and tripe spicy tomato sauce, and it was delicious but didn&#39;t blow my mind. I would highly recommended the Wagyu beef and the Coho salmon, though both had too much flavors and too much salt, are both done properly and deserve some recognition. Overall, with the price that comes with the food, I would expect more flavoring but less showy dishes that showcases the essence of the ingredients more. 

I was mad because we made a reservation at 9PM at the bar so we can watch the chefs prepare all the dishes (they have an open kitchen). But we were told upon arriving at the restaurant that people won&#39;t leave so we have to sit at a table until they do. However, we didn&#39;t get to sit at the bar until 11PM, before we had our dessert. 

It was my boyfriend&#39;s birthday, but all they did was write happy birthday and lit a candle on the dessert we ordered. I guess I just expected a lot more from the entire experience but was very much disappointed by it :( In conclusion, I will not recommend this place to anyone."

Had to cancel after my husband suffered a lung contusion (he was a victim in a car accident and was taken to Harbourview Trauma Center). They had no problem rescheduling.

When we came a different night, we enjoyed seats at the Chef&#39;s Table and tried the Chef&#39;s Tasting Menu. They had just flown in gargantuan white alba truffles (the largest Chef Nathan Lockwood had seen for a long time). It was no pressure! But we decided to go for it. Celebration of life (doubly).

The atmosphere is anything but stuffy -- definitely not what one would expect from a multi-Michelin-starred restaurant. It&#39;s more chatty bistro-esque, pull up a bottle of wine and some current topics, enjoy your neighbors sitting next to you or the shut off the world for the company of your soulmate beside you.

It was a rich experience of Pacific Northwestern specialties (think green and fish) and also strong Italian influences (think techniques and influences) and also some molecular gastronomy techniques (just the right amount of show and pop/sous vide). I loved re-creating the Roman hot chocolate and adding my own twist of espresso zing to it at home.

Plus, they give you a little cheat sheet, so it&#39;s easier for my super-taster palate to for this home cook to serve the dishes up for my family at home a second time. Thank you Altura for awesome Seattle hospitality!"

Place was a little small and they tried to put us at the counter.  After talking to the hostess, they moved us to a table which was much more comfortable.

Grassfed Veal Crudo was excellent.  The meat was fresh and not very gamey.  The anchovy and bone marrow complimented the dish very nicely.

The Octopus was grilled nicely.  It was tender.  Unfortunately, the spices overpowered the Octopus and we couldn&#39;t taste the natural and delicate flavors of it.  

The Braised Tripe and Ox Tail Pappardelle was the best dish of the night.  The tripe practically melted in my mouth.  The ox tail was very succulent.  The anchovy crumb added a nice texture to the silky pasta.  

The Gnocchi was cooked perfectly.  But the ragu of beef and sage masked the gnocchi.  The flavors did not work well together.

The Snake River Steak was cooked excellent.  It was a perfect medium rare and had nice flavor.  It was seasoned wonderfully and it enhanced the beefy flavor of the steak.

Our dessert was the Bourbon Caramel Semifreddo.  This was a nice way to end the dinner.  The flavors worked well together.

We had the tasting menu, which was amazing. Definitely the best meal I&#39;ve had in Seattle. The perfect place for a special occasion, and the very nicely accommodate food allergies. If you go, splurge and get the tasting menu. Not an everyday occurrence, but worth every penny. Every &#34;course&#34; was delicious, but some highlights included the Columbia City filone with duck liver mousse, the squash blossom frito misto, and the caviar. I plan on coming back for future special occasions!"

We got there 15 minutes before our reservation time of 8pm, but no problem, the hostess sat us right away at the counter as we&#39;d requested. 

Because it was a $$$$, I wanted to dress up for the occasion, but luckily I didn&#39;t. I wore business casual and anything more than that would have made me feel over dressed.  The place has more of a cozy bistro feel than that of a fine dining establishment. 

As for the cost of the tasting menu, I recommend you check out Altura&#39;s website for current pricing. When we went on 6/11/15, the tasting menu was $137 with $95 beverage pairing. This means with tax and tip, you are looking at $300/pp. I believe this is slightly higher than they charged just a few months ago. 

Our tasting menu included a total of 14 dishes (10 savory, 4 desserts) served with a different beverage every dish or two, for a total of 10 drinks.  if you come for the tasting menu, do not pre-eat.  Each dish was small in portion, but 14 dishes will definitely fill you up to the brim and some. We are not light eaters, and yet, we forced ourselves to finished the 13th plate and take the last dessert home.   Perhaps Altura should lower the price and reduce the amount of food/drinks served. 

I would say my experience here was a solid 3.5 stars. 

I removed 1.5 stars for 3 reasons: 1) casual ambience that is just at odds with the high price; 2) the service was good, but again, is not up to par with other establishments with similar price range; 3) only 3 dishes stood out to me (fermented vegetables with caviar, Columbia City Filone with black truffle, porcini and duck liver mousse and Black Cod cured with colatura caramel smoked with Martina wood) the remaining 11 were beautifully (painstakingly) presented, but flavors were just ok to me. Beverage pairing was awesome and I found 2 drinks that will become my all time favorites."

I&#39;d been wanting to go for a while but I hated that they require a credit card to make a reservation and that alone has kept me away... but, all the good reviews finally got to me so I went for dinner on a Saturday night to check out what the fuss is about. I made a reservation only hours before my dinner there (I don&#39;t recommend this by the way, it is likely this was only possible because I was dining alone). 
The food was phenomenal. They take time to plate and garnish all the dishes beautifully. The flavours and textures were interesting in every dish. The little touches here and there really make this place special. Every dish I had - beef crudo, cavatelli, elk steak, and cannoli - was excellent. The service was great, and I felt Altura is very reasonably priced when you consider the quality, presentation, service, and even quantity of the food (I left stuffed)!!! 

Tl;dr: I only have good things to say. Make a reservation and go ASAP!"

It was not reminiscent of a high end Michelin star rated restaurant,  but they were charging like they were.   The highlights were the desserts and Wagyu beef.   Pastas were forgettable.   Fish, steak, and venison were nothing special.   I&#39;m disappointed as I expected a lot more.   It was fun to sit by the kitchen and watch the chefs in action, and would be even more fun to sit at the bar.   

We go to a lot of similarly priced tasting menu dinners in the San Francisco bay area, and they are a few notches above in food quality and service."

Altura is as good as it gets to all things truffles, pasta and italian dishes. It&#39;s also the only place  you&#39;ll find authentic dishes outside of Italy. And it also helps that it is located right up my street. 2 minutes drive to all things pasta, truffle and delicious things. Oh the joy of it all :)

Chef Nathan Lockwood has taken all things fresh in PNW and created an amazingly tasty Italian meal. The menu changes weekly but it&#39;s a set menu. You can get 3- 4 or 5 courses. And if you are really hungry or want to try it all, try the 7 course tasting menu! Each dish will be presented in an ooooh worthy fashion.

The place- cute little tiny place on the south end of the Broadway. You might have passed by and never noticed it. But it is the warmest adorable place you can find in this area. From the moment you walk in till the moment you walk out, everything is magic.

Food- whether you get 3, 4 or 5 courses, you will get pampered with little amuse bouche in between. They are all so perfectly portioned and tasty. Wine pairing is a must. 

*First bite- beet soup! So refreshing!! I love beets and this was just perfect. 
*Albacore crudo- capers, anchovy, lemon! Yummm.
* Wild red peppers  with quail egg and anchovy thumbs up
*Corn panna cotta with truffles! Eeeeee this is where I start squealing with excitement. Omg....it was sooo beautiful and tasty! Like magic on drug. So goood. It looks nothing like what it should taste but you can taste every single ingredient in here. I can have this as my meal and be pretty happy with it. Luckily, I didn&#39;t have to stop here :)

**** Pastaaaaa- you can add fresh shaved truffles for $25 on your dish. And you know what. It is worth every penny! My advice- always do it when truffles are in season. The rule of thumb? Black truffles are in till Summer (end of summer ish), white truffles come out in October and then some. Altura obviously will carry whichever one is in season! 

** Ravioli with truffles and olive oil- divine!  Truffle on top of this was divine. 
**Bolognese sauce with goat and kobe beef! Yummmm ( be mindful that these are all tasting portions. Everything is about a few bites. But great few bites are better than plenty of mediocre bites.)

***Rolled up pasta with tripa!! This is a classic roman dish and oh so tastyy!

** Alaskan Halibut - with anchovy crust, artic charr and fried artichokes! YUmmmmmmmm!
**Magnolia Farm Wagyu with potato , bone marrow crisp and chantrelle mushrooms!  On nom nom nommmmm!
** Clabrian chilli- roasted with sea salt. 

**** Slow Roasted Duck Breast with mustard green, confit budino and cherry mostardo!  My favvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv! Such a stunning and tasty dish. It&#39;s super light. 
**Mozzerella di bufala - with sun gold tomatoes, watermelon and basil! So refreshing. 

 
Every bite was better than the next. And since I opted for the truffles on my main dishes, I get the Chef coming on by my table every few minutes! In the end, I got to go into the kitchen and go nuts over the truffles with both Chef Nathan and his souchef!  Woot woot :))) 

Oh yea, ended this phenomenal 10 courses with a perfect dessert! 

House Made Mascarpone Gelato  - with beautiful figs, pears, peaches + drizzle of traditional aged balsamic on top. 

Food was solid 5 stars all around. Wine pairing was right on the spot! And the service and atmosphere? Just fantastic. People next to our table was so friendly and intrigue with my food picture obsessions, they offered me to taste their food. How cool was that? Such nice ladies!! Love it when that happens :) This place is and will always be my favorite place to go celebrate any birthdays, occasion, non occasion, dinner dates , girls night and then some. 

The only problem? Large groups are kind of hard since they only seat about 32 people. So no 22 people dinners here. Altura is such a place that you want to enjoy your every bite. And you&#39;ll get to if you have less distractions :)  5 stars all around!! Thanks Chef!!!"

I love the concept of a tasting menu - and this was by far the best I have had. Ingenious pairings of flavors and the most beautifully displayed food.

The atmosphere is extremely laid back and calm. We sat at the chefs table and if there are only two of you I would highly recommend it. The chefs all work in perfect harmony and to see them construct the dishes right in front of you is a joy.

Service was exemplary - charming and thoughtful insights into the dishes and the pairing wine we had. 

To do both the tasting menu and pairing wines is fairly pricey but if you want an incredible dining experience it is great value. Put Altura on your list of places to try and you will not be disappointed."
altura-seattle,Colette H.,pHzGmIwwkZg7lnHr6bt0sQ,"Flatbush - Ditmas Park, NY",1,1,0,53,3,camkiX_4Ppg7pb9LH-nSHA,4.0,2015-08-29,"Hard to find anything bad to say about our experience at Altura. 

We had our first experience there tonight, celebrating my mother&#39;s 75th birthday. We were a party of 5 and we all did the tasting menu. I arranged the reservation and had great communications with the restaurant before arriving. 

The interior is inviting and charming but not too fancy. It initially felt laid back with an open kitchen design. The staff in the kitchen seem highly disciplined and calm from the start. We were seated immediately and given menus which was slightly confusing since on the reservation we said the whole table would be doing a tasting menu. The server came by, informed us of some specials we could add to our tasting and swept our menus away. 

I&#39;m going to spare you a course by course description of the vast tasting menu and say only that while some might balk at a $137 price point, the amount of care, time, and attention that is given to the experience make it feel like a bargain by the end. There was only one course that I frowned at and only two that I felt so-so about. Otherwise, the 11 course experience is padded with a lot of sweet details and extras, unique ingredients, and multi-layered flavors. Some of our favorites included a concord grape sorbet with finger limes and sorrel granita, fermented vegetables with osetra caviar and nasturtium pesto, panna cotta with fascinating slices of honey truffle, filone with black truffle, chantrelle and duck liver, kona kapachi that came in a globe of smoke and sung of the sea, and on and on. There really is an amazing care put into each dish and I haven&#39;t a clue how that kitchen juggles their regular clientele and our 3-4 hour course meal at the same time. Numerous staff worked to make our experience seamless. Everyone seemed very disciplined and focused. 

If we were going to say anything bad, it would probably be that they do tend to up sell you which I find a bit off at these price points. Folks who are willing to spend this price point on a culinary experience are going to ask for what they want. Granted, it wasn&#39;t too aggressive but we definitely felt it, despite being a party of five already spending $137 a head and paying to add an additional course. My sister was covering the wine for the evening and requested a very specific price point on the wine (especially because she intended to buy two bottles) and they brought her a wine that was $16 over her requested price point. She felt uncomfortable sending it back in front of our guests so she accepted it.  

I also felt that the way the space was laid was open and airy, the kind of space that made it feel like a place where diners could coo and share their joy over the food, dish with the staff and compliment and converse with the kitchen. However, the service style was more suited to the type of place that had more enclosed, private seating areas, a more intimate setting with low lights. It was the service style that the servers left you alone, swept in and out with your flatware and plates, and there was a lot of aloofness. I have no problem with that style. While I often enjoy interacting with the staff who make the magic happen,  I don&#39;t expect my server to be my buddy. Nor do I always want to be joshing and dishing with my server. I just felt a bit of tension with the atmosphere and style of service and the feel of the interior. That said, our server was excellent and attentive, as well as the support staff.. Though we did sense a bit of pretentiousness and grumpiness in the hostess--but who knows--it could be our flawed perception or she could have just been having a bad day. Everyone is allowed that.

These are probably the two things that kept me from giving the fifth star but don&#39;t let that deter you from enjoying Altura.

I&#39;ll close by saying, it&#39;s well worth a trip here. The quality and effort is clear. They don&#39;t skimp on the experience and every detail is attended to.  One of my best meals in the Seattle area to date. I hope to return on a future visit and try a three course meal ($73)."

The atmosphere is casual yet cozy.  Seating choices are the counter or a table.  There are a number of people prefer the counter.  Perhaps they enjoy viewing the process seeing their plates prepared or perhaps they aspire to be chefs, I don&#39;t know the reason.  I prefer a table and to let the chef concentrate on creating his wonderful dishes to enjoy.   

We opted for the tasting menu which consisted of 11 or so courses.  Each course was good.  There were a variety of foods and as well as some interesting tastes.  However, there was no particular course that was over the top, which is the reason for 4 stars ($137 tasting course).

The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable about each course.  I found them to be pleasant and accommodating.  

Overall it was one of the better dining experiences I had in Seattle."

My brand new husband and I came to Seattle as our first stop on our honeymoon.  Our very first meal as a married couple was an Altura tasting menu, and we opted to also have the beverage pairing.  We had made our reservations months before, and included the fact that it was our honeymoon on the reservation.

When we arrived, our server brought us a palate cleansing sippable, and asked us if we drink.  We told him we did, and he brought us two glasses or congratulations prosecco.  

We ordered, and our drinks and tastings came out, and truly were astonishing.  Each dish that came out was better than the last.  My absolute favorite thing that came out was a truffle bread with a duck liver mousse. 
 
Now, let me tell you about this bread.  When it came out, I was disappointed.  I couldn&#39;t believe that for the price, one of my dishes was bread.  Then they opened the parchment paper it came in, and the smell that escaped had my mouth watering. 

They had pre-sliced the bread, spread butter and scallions (I think) in between each slice, re-wrapped it, and let the butter melt.  The duck liver mousse was sublime.  It was savory and tangy and creamy and melted when I put it on the bread and in my mouth.

My husband loved the braised pig feet.  It had a sweet, tangy sauce on the meat itself, almost like a barbecue but not quite, with torched kale and orange shavings.  
The other thing that had us going was one of the desserts.  It was a panna cotta with a 25 year old aged balsamic drizzled on top.  

Now, we didn&#39;t know what we were getting before the dishes showed up at our spot at the bar, but they set down a spatula before we got the dish.  It was a cute spatula, don&#39;t get me wrong... it looked Crate and Barrell-ee or like it could have been from Williams and Sonoma, and it was small enough that you could get it into your mouth.  When they explained the balsamic to us, I realized they gave us a socially acceptable way to lick our plate.  And good heavens, am I glad they did.  I would have had no problems making a fool of myself and picking up the bowl and licking it clean, right there in front of God and everyone.

This was the absolute perfect way to start our incredible honeymoon.  We flew out to Seattle, rented a car, and drove back down the coast over the course of about two and half weeks.  We ate amazing meals at fabulous restaurants, but none of them held a candle to Altura.  We have been married about 4 months now, and still frequently look back and revisit this exquisite meal.  I had to write Altura a thank you card when we got home.  What a way to start a marriage,"
altura-seattle,Terrence M.,9Bi0sw8H_WvC4GDBex2NcA,"Seattle, WA",0,1,0,0,7,UhgKkUym7c9jl2T4L-7Fqw,5.0,2016-03-04,"My wife and I went to Altura for our anniversary recently. It has a very good reputation and it has been on our list for sometime.

 We arrived and were sat at the large kitchen counter where we had requested to spend our night. The place is splashed in warm colors and certainly has a warmth and modesty about it. The focus is you and the food and where wine and drink compliment, that&#39;s it. Not even a bar to sit at or stare upon a sea of spirit labels while watching bartenders swirl around and overhearing boring workplace drama. Totally refreshing and very confident! There is a hutch off in the rear of the restaurant where your wine is poured and paired and beverages are crafted. This is not the place to catch a drink after work or have a reckless and forgettable bite. 

 We chose to go all out. Had a great bottle of crisp and fruity pinot meunier champagne. We chose the full seasonal tasting menu for each of us. This included 15 courses and a creative seasonal fennel and blood orange aperitif brought out to greet us. If you&#39;re a light eater it will be too much and I would suggest the 3 course option which looked ample and delicious. If you&#39;re celebrating, eat a light lunch and go for the full tasting. I really feel it was very well priced considering the ingredients and preparation. Plan on a long dinner and take the time to talk and enjoy.

 I will not mention all the tastes because there were so many. One course included a beautiful red Carabinieri prawn with porcini and popcorn. It was so good I started laughing like a hyena. The set was a perfect foil for the clean sweet prawn. A total slap in the foodie face. We added the offered supplement of a Magnolia Farms Wagyu Bone-In Ribeye. I wouldn&#39;t blink at spending the extra cash on this upgrade again. It was supremely served and carved, beautifully watermelon-hued and salted perfectly. Perfect. Absolutely perfect. I told my wife, &#39; this was a happy cow!&#39; Perfectly farmed and respected. A Kiwi Sorbet with grappa and blood orange made for the perfect introduction to the beef. Only one taste felt lost or soulless and that was the Short Rib Tortelloni with beet and elderberry. 

 Equally outstanding was the staff! Brendan, the Captain waiter was a so nice and proper yet never stuffy. Jeremy, the sommelier has some of the purest and most humble restaurant eyes I&#39;ve ever seen. A service master in head and heart. He took great care of us and often refilled our water and wine as well as pairing a flawless Tuscan red with the Wagyu and a Moscato for my wife during dessert. The Service Assistant and Hostess helped serve courses also. They were well versed in the menu as well. We loved watching the kitchen crew work together. Everyone was well kept, groomed and totally respected their product and role in the dinner service. They would even help expedite the fare to ourselves and other tables and enjoyed serving with the Captains. Nathan Lockwood, the Chef and Owner must be so confident in his teachings and staff. He was a gentleman and rallied his line to time courses and present everything with dignity and confidence. He was constantly cleaning and sweeping and it was exciting to watch his calm and happy demeanor.

 You really can&#39;t expect more from the product and the people who put it all together at Altura. It is a place to celebrate where they are focused on you and the ingredients at hand with warmth and humility. The staff has a way of making you feel wanted not because of what you&#39;ll spend but because they want to. It is in the way they speak softly and it shows in their eyes."

I appreciate the farm-to-table attention and conceptually can&#39;t complain with the many-course prix fixe style menu with each item carefully related to the other ones.

I just can&#39;t rate it 5-stars because it&#39;s over-priced compared to similarly fancy options by easily 25% (maybe 50%). I&#39;m not saying every upscale restaurant has to be hush-hush/suit-wearing, but this is a loud, small restaurant where you&#39;re surrounded by fleece-wearing northwesterners - I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s anything particularly &#34;romantic&#34; about it. Secondly, we had to wait a bit for our check, and while the food was awesome it&#39;s not better than other 5-star top-end restaurants I&#39;ve dined at in SF, NYC and even Seattle. Considering you&#39;re paying a minimum of +$100 per person without alcohol, I expect more than just great food. 

Again, not going to knock it down that far, but it&#39;s just not hitting it out of the park because of those downsides."

Saw Altura and all of the great reviews, and was able to get reservations. After dining, I can confidently say that Altura was all it was billed up to be. Were Michelin stars to be given in Seattle, I think Altura would get 1 Michelin star; it was similar in quality to Gary Danko&#39;s in San Francisco and Tru in Chicago - 2 of my favorites, and both earning 1 coveted Michelin star. Now, onto the food: 

Did the chef&#39;s tasting menu - 13 courses/bites that were all well done and crafted nearly perfectly. I&#39;ll describe each course, attach pictures of each, and rate each from 1-10

Course 1:
An excellent take on &#34;potato soup&#34; - salty, fermented potato foam, with perfect bites of steelhead roe and a sweet brown butter and arugula pesto at the bottom to cut through the richness. -9/10

Course 2: 
Mussel, wrapped in house cured pancetta, and smoked. Smokey, meaty, and done very well. Came with house made focaccia, which was excellent. -8/10

Course 3:
Bone marrow roasted beets, with assorted vegetables and an incredibly tasty parmesan cream. One of the highlights, as the beets and vegetables were done so well, with the parmesan and bone marrow giving meaty, salty notes. -10/10

Course 4: 
Abalone, with kale, pigs feet, and sweet garlic sauce. Garlic sauce was incredible, as were the pigs feet, which were sweet from being braised in apple juice. Kale was a tad too salty, but overall, the dish was still very good. 7/10

Course 5:
Asparagus risotto with king crab. Not a huge fan of risotto, but this one was done so well. Not too rich as to mask the sweet crab and asparagus, and the rice still had some tooth to it, which I appreciate. Served with an Italian fry bread and house cured meats, which was outstanding. 8/10

Course 6: 
Squid ink pasta with prawns, squid, scallops, and greens. This dish, I could have over and over again every day. Seafood was fresh and delicious, pasta cooked perfectly, and an outstanding use of red chili - just enough to taste and feel, not enough to detract from the delicate flavors. 10/10

Course 7: 
Essentially, mushroom ravioli. Was very well done. Served with house made truffle bread and pate. Tried to stop eating this bread, and couldn&#39;t. The bread was that good. I almost forgot that the ravioli was the main dish and the bread was the accompaniment. 9/10

Course 8: 
Pigeon (aka Squab) breast, leg, and heart/liver pate. This, I was a big fan of. Squab was cooked perfectly, and wasn&#39;t even as gamey as some duck I&#39;ve had. Cherry mostarda was acidic and helped cut through the Squab, as did the root vegetables served underneath. 9/10

Course 9: 
Their play on a cheese plate - good, but my least favorite part of the meal. Chase was a sharp, assertive, tasty brie, but the &#34;cracker&#34; it was served on was difficult to eat and a bit of a waste. 6/10

Course 10:
Tart kiwi sorbet, sweet blood orange, and herbaceous sorrel - an excellent, balanced sorbet. 9/10

Course 11: 
A vanilla and rum panna cotta, with kumquat, orange, and drizzled with 25 year aged balsamic. This was the epitome of a perfectly balanced dessert round. Sweet, light panna cotta, the acidic, slightly fermented, and sweet taste of the aged balsamic, the sharp note of the rum, and the fruity complexity of the assorted fruits (imagine that) all came together for an excellent dessert course. 10/10

Course 12: 
Hot chocolate affogato with a mascarpone gelato. Best hot chocolate I&#39;ve ever had outside of Italy. Aerated yet rich, chocolatey but not too sweet. Very rich towards the end of the meal, but a small enough portion to give us a great taste without hurting us. 10/10.

Course 13: 
Assorted goodies - an excellent chocolate meringue, bourbon cherries, etc. All very good. 9/10 

Atmosphere was very nice and cozy. A smaller, intimate place with an open kitchen, Altura was neither imposing nor pretentious. Likewise, service was very good. 

Altura was all that it was propped up to be. I&#39;ll be sure to go back if I find myself in Seattle again."

I had requested and was seated at their dining bar which allows you to watch their chefs preparing dinner, which I recommend if you are a party of one or two. Service was excellent throughout and they have a wonderful wine list. 

I had the chef&#39;s tasting menu, which is simply a page-long list of ingredients from which they decide a full menu for the evening. In other words you are ordering on faith without knowing your courses&#39; exact content or quantity. But it is faith very well placed. Each of my 13 courses, from savory to desserts, is served and described with perfect timing and each is balanced and delicious. I added the beverage pairings as well, which began with a gin cocktail (I don&#39;t even like gin and it was great), champagne, wines, a beer and port. These come every few courses, as they are meant to be paired. 

The meal was certainly pricey at just over $300 for the full tasting menu, beverage pairings, an espresso and tax, but it was well worth the kingly sum. Altura ranks on a short list of one of the top meals I&#39;ve ever had, I highly recommend it and am looking forward to my next visit when in Seattle again in a few months."

I left thinking I just been had. Restaurants overdose on salt tend to be hiding their own inadequacies. Altura was one of those places. If you know what you are doing, then why try to murder me with salt? If this is one of the better places in Seattle, then it is just depressing."

Although I think it&#39;s slightly overpriced, you won&#39;t be able to find a restaurant in Seattle that can duplicate this place&#39;s creativity. I came for Christmas dinner and I found the dishes being served were playful, but small portions. Since it was a prix-fixe menu I&#39;m guessing several of the items were not in the regular menu. I will say that I was happy with the recommended wine pairings- someone is doing something right with the flavor combinations. That being said, I would have liked to see more Washington wines available. If I had to do it again, I would not have come here for a prix-fixe meal. The quality here is not on par with the aptitude of other places I&#39;ve been to. I would however return for a bite to see what their regular menu is like."

OMG - I don&#39;t know how people in Seattle can handle coming here!  Hubby and I booked my b-day dinner here during our weekend away, and I had super high hopes since it was the top ranked Seattle restaurant in 2012 and I absolutely love Acquerello, the SF resto where the chef previously worked.

But the torture of trying to find parking in this area for an 8 pm reservation was ridiculous both at meters, on the street, and even in the paid lots.  Seriously took us 30 mins to find a spot!

That put us both in a crabby mood... so not off to a great start.  Service was pleasant and we eventually settled in.

That being said, I wouldn&#39;t come back.

Pros:
- Decent service
- Lovely birthday dessert acknowledgement
- Food quality is excellent - pastas are beautifully done, we both loved our meat courses, and some of the amuse bouches were very interesting (popcorn!)

Cons:
- Super small portions... seriously, I thought one of my hubby&#39;s courses was one of those filler ones that they give you sometimes to even out the courses when the couple orders different amounts
- Terrible spacing in between courses... we didn&#39;t leave until after 11 pm.  My hubby and I had huge gaps in between the courses, so although we liked the food, we both had to eat so much bread just so we had something to do!

At this price point, I have pretty high standards.  Sadly this did not live up to the best restaurant of 2012 claim in my books."
altura-seattle,Arthur K.,eipO40vDyfHFXug2ElJ7Yg,"Seattle, WA",0,1,1,271,4,52enRdHZPI5pt5q5ZFjUJQ,5.0,2014-10-09,"Rather than go for the chef&#39;s tasting menu, a group of 5 of us decided to do the 3 course option and just order all the items on the menu. We&#39;re glad we did as we were stuffed at the end and incredibly satisfied with our meal. Everything was masterfully crafted and a few were beyond description.

Service (5/5) - The service as expected here is impeccable. From the hostess who sat us immediately as we arrived to the server who made sure all our needs were met right away. She was also incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. Even the hostess helped deliver dishes which I&#39;ve never seen in other restaurants but it seems that everyone chips in to make sure things are done quickly and with class.

Spicy Grilled Octopus (4.5/5) - The octopus was cooked just right. It wasn&#39;t too chewy but had a good snap to the outside of it. I didn&#39;t really taste much spice but it was still seasoned well and had plenty of great flavor.

Chicory Salad (5/5) - I&#39;m usually not a fan of fancy salads as I don&#39;t really like bitter greens. They tend to overpower the salad, but this salad did not do that. Everything in this had a perfect balance and never did I feel like I was eating a healthy salad. 

Grassfed Beef Crudo (Abstain) - This was probably my least favorite appetizer but that&#39;s probably because I&#39;m not a huge fan of beef tartare. I love medium rare meat but rare is not my thing so I can&#39;t really tell people if this was really good or not.

Foie Gras Seared &amp; Chilled (4/5) - The foie gras was good but not the best I&#39;ve had. It definitely had a more mineral-like flavor than others I&#39;ve had which does make it more reminiscent of actual liver, but it did have the butteriness that we all have come to expect of it.

Carnaroli Risotto (5/5) - Wow! Just wow! This risotto is probably the best I&#39;ve ever had. The creaminess and unbelievable flavor just rocked my tastebuds. If this is on the menu it&#39;s a must eat!

Papardelle (5/5) - This pasta was easily my favorite pasta of the night. Be warned though as it does have a little kick so if you can&#39;t handle spice at all, this one isn&#39;t for you. The tripe &amp; oxtail give it a balance that I never even imagined before. It just worked so damn well. Again, this is a must eat.

Gnocchi (5/5) - The gnocci&#39;s ragu is another flavor that I wish I could have all the time. Damn was it good. You can&#39;t go wrong ordering this dish. It&#39;s only just slightly behind the papardelle.

Pansotti (4/5) - Though this was a very good dish on its own it was a bit hidden behind all the other better pasta dishes we had. Honestly, I&#39;m having a hard time remembering much about it besides that it was pretty good.

House Special Pasta (4/5) - This dish was a supplemental charge of $55 because they add white truffles to the dish. We figured between the 5 of us why not splurge a little and all have a few bites of this.  The dish was the smallest of all the ones we ordered, but was pretty good &amp; the white truffles gave it a nice punch, but compared to the other pasta dishes, this was probably my least favorite one.

Potato Crusted Petrale Sole (5/5) - What I really like about this dish was how light the sauce was so that the fish would really stand out. This is probably the best sole dish I&#39;ve ever tried. It was very flakey, yet tender. I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better fish dish.

Snake River Farms Zabuton Steak (3.5/5) - The quality of the steak is top notch. It was even cooked just right. I&#39;m just not a big fan of char grilled. I prefer my steak to have grill marks and not all black on the outside. That&#39;s the only reason for the lower mark.

Roosevelt Elk Saddle Cut for Two (5/5) - The elk was my favorite entree by far. It wasn&#39;t too gamey. Actually, it was unbelievably tender.

Lopez Island Goat (4/5) - The goat came beautifully plated and served goat multiple ways which included sausage, braised neck and roasted saddle. This is my first time having goat and I&#39;ll have to say it&#39;s not my favorite type of meat but braised neck was pretty awesome.

Canoli (4.5) - The canoli is made in a light mold rather than the traditional thick one that you get at most restaurants. The ricotta cheese was light as well. 

Vanilla Semifreddo (5/5) - This dessert is awesome. The grapes balanced out the meringue with a great sweet &amp; tart burst. Highly recommended."

If you like wine, spring for the pairings as it won&#39;t disappoint.  It is places like this that make me want to downgrade all my other ratings because if the highest I can give this is a 5, then it is hard to imagine anything else being above a 3.

We arrived 5 minutes early for our reservation...the person at the door said they weren&#39;t ready to seat us yet and then just stood there awkwardly...no conversation. The person receiving you at the door sets the tone for the whole evening, and you blew it!
Later, we found it odd that one of the server&#39;s inquired as to why I was ordering non-alcoholic drinks &#34;Are you taking a break? or....just don&#39;t drink?&#34;  What an odd question to ask a guest!  Additionally, we felt rather ignored by most of the staff.
We opted for the tasting menu, and found it rather unremarkable.  Granted the ingredients did seem of very high quality.
One last thing...we are both allergic to dairy. It is not a voluntary restriction...so once the wait staff insured us it was ok to order the tasting without dairy, it was disheartening to hear passive aggressive comments from the chef&#39;s behind the counter.

For the prices they charge, I would rather go to Spinasse twice. This place is loud, overcrowded, and overpriced!"

I did the whole culinary tour of Seattle and I thought this was the best meal we had and that includes Canlis. The menu at Altura is fun, exciting, and more importantly inventive. I went in convinced that I was not doing the tasting but once I got in and saw what this place was all about I knew that I had to, couple that with a 9 gram $23 truffle addition and you have a winner here.  I will not spoil the surprises for anyone that in contemplating doing the tasting but I will rattle off a few of my favorites, the uni eggroll, the gnocchi, the duck, the steak, the smoked cod, and so many more. On the menu you will see a list of ingredients that they will use in your tasting menu and that&#39;s all they give you so you are largely in the dark.

My first impression of the place was not positive. The decor, lighting, and furniture does not adequately reflect the level of cuisine. When we first entered the empty restaurant at 5pm we were sat right near the cooking station where we could see food refuse and mess, not appealing. The place feels a bit cold overall. We asked to move to another table and also asked they turn the heat up (which they did). 

There are two dining style options- getting the full tasting menu with an optional wine pairing or choosing three dishes with an optional wine pairing. I found this limiting and disrespectful of the customer. If someone in the party wants to order just a couple of small dishes or even one dish I think they should have that freedom. 

We opted for the choose three with the wine pairing. The food itself was delicious. My stand out dish was my desert- a camembert/black truffle plate of delectable delight. I also loved the plating of the amuse-bouche, a foam with tiny flowers within. The wine pairings on the other hand were sub par, the sommelier failing to say much at all about the wines or ask our personal preference. 

For what I expected from this level of a restaurant, I give it 3 stars. Great food but lacking elsewhere."

It beats Canlis and my favorite restaurant in Paris. My world travelling mother and aunt visiting from DC felt the same. We came to Altura expecting a good meal, but were blown away by the creative flavors and excellent presentation. Yes, pricey, but much less than the Little Inn at Washington and far far better. I would only say the wine list could have more options that aren&#39;t as pricey. We had a reservation, made with the restaurant directly, were not asked for a credit card. We arrived early and were seated right away. We asked for a menu and they explained they normally present it at the end but shared one at the start so my elderly ladies could read what they were getting as it was a little hard to hear the descriptions when the courses were delivered. The menus are printed daily and presented in a scroll tied with a ribbon- nice ending to a wonderful evening. The Chef&#39;s menu is the only option and it changes weekly. You definitely have to go to Altura if you are a foodie in Seattle."

So I booked a table without hesitation. I was there in March and I tried their tasting menu - only 2 dishes out of 10+ are actually delicious. This restaurant charges a Michelin Star price (paying over 700 for a table of 4) but failed to deliver a Micheline star level of dinning environment, experience and pleasure. The staffs there are friendly, but if you are looking for a fine dinning experience, I hope this review helps you to adjust/fine tune your expectation before going.

I highly recommend going during their happy hour times of 3-5 and 8-9 because all sushi is 25% off which is incredible. 

All the servers here have always been nice and eager to fulfill requests. I learned early that ordering calamari instead of picking if off the belt is worth the wait. It comes hot and crispy. Other favorites of mine are the dragon roll, seared salmon nigiri, unagi nigiri and kinishi roll. My friend is also a big fan of their tempura fried ice cream. 

Definitely a must try on the ave. I always like to think of it as a better Sushiland."

There is no use for the conveyer belt because they weren&#39;t making anything new, during their happy hour mind you, on a Friday, they should have been prepared. 

The restaurant had a good amount of people in it but no one wanted anything from the conveyer as it looped around about six or seven times by us. We had to order specific rolls through the server and even then they were very incompetent. Not really listening to the orders and taking (I&#39;m not joking) 20 mins to just pick it up from the chef and delivering it to our table. At one point as we are watching the same sushi plates pass by us yet another time, I start having awkward eye contact with everyone waiting for the server to at least pass by so we could order sushi. Eventually, people had to walk over to the cashier to ask to order their sushi, ridiculous. Having to wait 20 mins for a four piece small plate of sushi is so frustrating.

You go to a conveyer belt sushi for convenience and timeliness, this place is seriously a disappointment and not worth it."

Their cheapest plate costs $1.25 while the most expensive one costs $3.75. That&#39;s relatively cheap compared to other joints! It would be even cheaper if you come during the happy hour 3-5 PM and 8-9 PM where you can get 25% OFF. They also offer additional 5% OFF when you post a picture on FB/IG! *see photo for detail*

Moving onto the food, I highly recommend ordering them off the belt through the servers to guarantee freshness *especially if you order nigiri that has raw fish slices* As for the taste, I&#39;d say they&#39;re pretty fresh and good! No complaint so far~

The service is great to be honest, they greet you constantly refill your water, and check on you even when the place is quite busy!

The waiter always made sure the glasses of water were full and we had what we needed. The reason it&#39;s getting a 4 star is because I question the freshness of the sushi and other food products. When I sat down, I saw a plate of crab salad go by and at the end as I was leaving, I saw the same plate of crab salad go by on the conveyor belt. Food normally served warm, such as calamari, fries, and chicken katsu, were cold when I tried them. There weren&#39;t many noodles in the tempura udon and the tempura was kinda soggy, but overall the taste was good and the soup was flavorful. California Rolls are a staple when eating sushi. The Black Sesame ice cream was even better than it looked."

I came by with my family for lunch during their grand opening week when they offered a &#34;Two-for-One&#34; special. Just imagine not two, but FOUR pieces of fresh salmon nigiri at $2.50! Amaaaaazing. :D

If you didn&#39;t get a chance to visit during their grand opening, I&#39;d say that Sushi Town is a comfortable middle ground between simple and overpriced. As a college kid, my concern was always about getting the most bang for my buck. If you&#39;re worried about getting a decent meal without breaking the bank, I&#39;d recommend ordering the udon ($3.75) with a few sushi plates for a pretty filling dinner or lunch under $15. 

Sushi Town also has a few dessert plates on the belt and available for order, from chocolate covered strawberries and slices of green tea  or chocolate roll cake to cream puffs and mochi. I&#39;d say my favorite was the green tea roll and mochi - yuuuuum.

I don&#39;t think i would be coming back unless they have the promo again. Everything is a bit overpriced or maybe I am just not use to paying that much. They serve a lot more variety, I would say better variety, than sushi land. They have a lot more interesting rolls too.

It was a busy week for them so i understand if we don&#39;t get our water filled or tables cleaned, but the sushi quality is not quite there. I had salmon nigiri and it tasted so stiff and old. I almost wanted to puke. I saw pics on Yelp where the salmon look fresh and smooth. Maybe I came in on the wrong day.

They didn&#39;t seem annoyed at my requests for replacing dropped chopsticks and when we had a special order that was going to take awhile they let us know. They even brought some mochi ice cream when we couldnt get tomago. When we took forever in the bathroom (again... twins) they cleared our table and wished us a great evening.

I&#39;ve tried almost a bit of everything from Sushi Town and one thing that I like is that portion wise, the rolls are generous compared to other conveyor belt restaurants. I like how there are decent portions of fish and avocado in rolls such as the California and tuna avocado. The only exception to the generous fillings is the Philly Roll. I think they could add in less cream cheese since it does overpower the smoked salmon.

Sushi Town has decent cuts of nigiri on the menu too. My go to is always salmon and tuna. I also love seared salmon nigiri but at Sushi Town, it&#39;s my least favorite due to the sauce they put on it before searing (sriracha mayo, I think?). I would prefer something garlicky, or similar to the sauce used at Sushiland.

Price wise, it is slightly higher than Sushiland, but not as expensive at Blue C. However, with the ratio of fish to rice, I&#39;m totally fine with the price point Sushi Town has. 

With Lent coming up, I will be a lunch time regular at Sushi Town."

It&#39;s the classic fast food sushi format, filled with White people who don&#39;t know a thing about sushi. It&#39;s where good sushi goes to die.

Sushi Town doesn&#39;t need the conveyor belt format. It&#39;s good enough to stand on its own. We went during an off-time, around 3pm. There were a bunch of complex rolls on the belt, so we had slim pickings of simple nigiri. We had the rainbow roll, mackerel nigiri, california rolls, and a roll reminiscent of the super bad boy roll from Japonessa. The rainbow roll was great, with an aioli sauce rained upon it. The mackerel was flavorful and not too terribly fishy. Everything tasted fresh. As with all conveyor belt sushi places, I recommend coming when it&#39;s busy, so the dishes go under more frequent rotation. Perhaps the restaurant knew that it didn&#39;t need the freshest fish for the complex rolls. They just needed something that looked good. 

Oh yeah, I also appreciated the faux-gold on the conveyor belt. CLASSY. Much better than the gold on Tyga&#39;s shitty Gold Album.

The reason I give it 4 stars is that if you didn&#39;t find good shit on the belt, you can CUSTOM ORDER anything off the menu. To test the caliber of the fish, I ordered what I consider the sacred order: salmon nigiri. For $2.50, I received two pieces. The salmon was CREAMY and the pieces were long and the length went well past the well-vinegared rice. It was glorious and surprisingly some of the best salmon I&#39;ve had in recent memory. 

So my piece of advice: skip the belt and custom order!

I&#39;m impressed, Sushi Town. See you again soon.

Or even the same at a better price. After the giant letdown of Sushiland failing to open its doors, I was hoping Sushi Town would fill the void left in my heart. 

The product is comparable to Sushiland, only at 1.5X the cost. I had a California roll, a Philadelphia roll, a salmon roll, and seared tuna. The Cali roll was  too heavy on the cucumber for my taste, the Philly roll too cheesy, and the tuna a bit over seared. Again, I wouldn&#39;t expect too much more from Sushiland, but Sushi Town seems like it&#39;s going for more of a Blue C vibe, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m nitpicking. I ended up spending $14 after tax and tip. I won&#39;t be back unless I&#39;m really craving sushi, so I&#39;ll probably be back."

Located where the old printing/copy shop used to be, you really can&#39;t miss this place. Inside, the interior is modern and sleek and the ambiance is quite relaxing with the dim lights and such.

Seating was quick and the waitstaff was attentive and nice. Typical of many conveyor belt sushi places, once seated, you just grab whatever looks good to eat. On the wall where you see this huge flat screen TV, the types of sushi rolls are displayed and it&#39;s pretty convenient to look at since the prices are also marked on the screen and along the walls. 

Since we all didn&#39;t have enough room to sample some pretty looking sushi, we went all out with the desserts. Overall, the desserts were tasty. The chocolate strawberries tasted fresh and the cake was not too sweet and very soft and fluffy.  Prices here are pretty comparable to other sushi places like Sushi Land / Genki and such and it&#39;s a pretty good stop if you&#39;re in the mood for quick and fast sushi."

This place was walking distance from our hotel so we decided to give it a shot. As we walked in we noticed there was really no one there. For a Saturday around 7:00 it was strange but we sat down and watched the conveyer belt go buy with sushi. We ordered our drinks and were told we can order off the menu or pick what ever you want off the conveyer belt. Before I started to pick off the belt I asked how long the fish has been there. The waiter said nothing is up there longer then 2 hours. That was a little scary but we ate there anyway. 
Took some sashimi off the conveyer belt and I have to say the fish was a little warm. We the ordered off the menu. Much fresher off the menu. If you happen to give this place a try make sure you order off the menu or watch to see when they put something new on the belt. I am not sure I would recommend this place to anyone but that&#39;s up to you if you want to give it a try. Oh I do have to say it was the cheapest I have ever paid for sushi. When eating they charge you per plate. Each plate has its color and its price."

I eat a lot of sushi. Like A LOT. So, whenever I go to conveyor belt sushi places, I always have to watch what and how many I eat. While this place is probably much cheaper than regular sushi restaurants, I prefer going to other sushi places during Happy Hour (I have my usual spot). I have also been to Sushiland. Though my last visit was years ago and it may or may not have stayed the same in terms of quality, I think Sushiland was better.

During my dinner, I saw several of what I think were Tuna Salad Gunkuns go around many times. They looked totally dried and unappetizing. I just feel that the staff should have taken them off of the belt and replace them with fresh ones. Just my opinion though.

PS. Oh, and wasabi was superrrrrrrrrr mild. Not really an issue. Just wanted to point that out."

If I were to compare this spot to the infamous Sushiland (which was suppose to open up further down the ave, but oh well), I would say it&#39;s quite similar in many ways. The prices of the plates are worth it for conveyer belt sushi and the menu has a fair amount of selections. It&#39;s always a hit or miss when you arrive. When the place is busy, it can get backed up and it&#39;ll sometimes feel like there is nothing on the belt. The service will be slow. But on other days, the belt can be filled with many things and the service is great. The sushi can sometimes be inconsistent in quality (mushy/hard rice, thin pieces of nigiri, etc.) The busiest times will be late afternoons to evenings. So arrive with that knowledge! 

Not sure if this will be a consistent thing, but I think it&#39;s pretty cool that they offer a complimentary Ferrero Rocher. Who can say no to that? **EDIT: I believe it was just during the grand opening when they offered it. Sorry Forerro Rocher lovers! 

So of course, never have too high of an expectation and just enjoy cheap sushi when you have that craving every now and then! (Especially for those college students out there, eh?)"

The quality of the food was much better than Sushi Land in Queen Anne (which has really gone downhill over the years) but there weren&#39;t many options on the belt.  The same few rolls kept going around.  They would not offer a menu (they said they were revamping it and not offering some of the items on it) so we were not able to order off the menu.  The vegetable tempura was a great deal (and was fresh when I picked it off the belt) and their salmon nigiri was amazingly fresh.  Good size cuts and it was melt-in-your-mouth fantastic.

I guess I shouldn&#39;t be too surprised. This restaurant somehow nabbed the chef behind the legendary Muto Izakaya in Lynnwood. And it&#39;s also the kind of spot the owners eat regularly - they own the building and it&#39;s their first foray into the food world. 

It&#39;s conveyor belt style sushi, which usually means mediocre quality fish and potentially blah food in general.

But wow. This is all fresh and affordable. In fact, I had some of the most tender and delicious scallop sushi I&#39;ve ever had. It blew my mind.

They don&#39;t have the most amazing variety, but you don&#39;t have to wait around for the belt to bring you what you want. You can ask any of the waiters, or if you sit near the chefs - who prepare the sushi right up in front of you - you can ask them for whatever you need.

Everything is reasonably priced, the sake is plentiful, and the staff are great. 

I&#39;ve been to a lot of restaurants during soft opening and there&#39;s usually a ton of glitches. Not here. But still, the manager was personally attending to every single patron to make sure things went smoothly.

Excited to see how this place goes from here, and will definitely go again.

The service is pretty mixed too. Water refills are pretty non-existent, and everyone&#39;s slightly unfriendly. Also, like another reviewer wrote, the waitresses often forget to put in your orders.

My major concern was that my sushi, from the conveyer belt, was warm. There was no way to determine time of plating to know how fresh your plate was. The sushi rolls were very small and bland. The plates were relatively cheap, but so was the quality.

Atypical of most Asian restaurants, they charged you for tea. This came as a surprise to everyone in my party. No one likes a surprise on their bill.

They also only had their sushi chefs present, there was no cook to prepare some of the more desirable items. 

The positive was the wait staff. I felt adequately checked in on for refills of my water and tea, and any other concerns I might have.

The sushi is pretty good. I heard they had some issues the week of grand opening but I&#39;m glad to see that they&#39;ve figured it out. The fish is pretty fresh and the rolls are generous for this type of restaurant. My only complaint about this is that it felt like we spent more time just looking around for good rolls to eat, rather than actually eating or enjoying our meal, but maybe that&#39;s just the downside of a conveyor belt sushi place.

As for the prices... they could be better. They&#39;re not outrageous or absurd like some other places (*coughs* Blue C) but they&#39;re not quite where I think they should be either, but they&#39;re not bad. I would say everything is just a little overpriced, especially for a location on the Ave, where broke college students will frequent. It&#39;s not enough to keep me from coming back, but I really think they would benefit with a slight price reduction, because it will be more affordable for what you get and more people will come.

Figured it would be okay with a small crowd. We should have left then seeing old looking sushi going around, but we ordered off the menu hoping it would be fresh. Both of us are terribly sick and miserable now. Nothing we had for breakfast or lunch from yesterday could have made us sick since we had different things. I&#39;m not sure what we had here but definitely not worth getting sick. Might be okay for lunch when it&#39;s busier but I would NOT risk it."

I&#39;m usually the Guinea pig when it comes to trying out new places to eat at so I decided to come in by myself to give it a try and I was surprised at the price and quality of food they have here. Portions are big and the taste very good. Really affordable for college students and perfect for a quick bite. I really enjoyed the service here and will definitely be coming back with my friends! 

My only complaint is depending on the time you come in their selection on the belt is very limited and they got rid of their paper menus to encourage customers to grab from the belt. You usually have to ask the server for what you want. I feel to attract more customers and sales you should expand the selection of sushi and menus because not everyone would know your style of business."

Went there today for lunch and decided that I will never come back. The service really needs some huge improvement.

Grand opening was today so for the most part real busy during dinner service. 
Service: 3/5 the person taking care of me was polite and checked in periodically, but was either really stressed or little experience, Didn&#39;t offer to refill our tea and water that was a bummer, the floor manager seemed to support the staff as best he could which was cool. 
Food: 2/5. Mostly because the sushi rice was hard. I also felt like the wrong colored plates where being used just by comparing to the menu to they had available. The food was not stand out amazing but was good. 
Environment: 4/5 the restaurant was nicely designed. Very modern and great amount of seating. 
Price: 4/5 very good prices. With the most expensive being less then $4. 
Overall: 3/5 Again as mentioned it was opening night this place has plenty of room to grow and get better it&#39;s also the only sushi belt place in the area as far as I know. I wish them the best of luck!!!"

This is the worst sushi place I&#39;ve ever been to! Not a lot of variety, either. One of my favs is Salmon Nigiri. I love the delicate flavor of the Salmon when it&#39;s fresh. It wasn&#39;t fresh here - not at all. The Nigiri was slightly fishy, but the next item I picked up, the Salmon was so fishy I almost spit it out, right there in public. Up to this point, all the fellas who worked there had been very courteous, helpful, etc. But I told one guy that this dish was really fishy and another one came up and asked me just what I meant by fishy and I about blew a gasket. I started to tell him that what I meant by &#34;fishy&#34; is that it was old, had sat out too long and tasted nasty! That&#39;s about when Sharon told me to lower my voice. Oops, didn&#39;t realize I was shouting! But fresh fish should never, ever taste fishy! And you&#39;d think that an establishment in Seattle, of all places, would have fresh fish!!!

In Xi&#39;an Noodle House&#39;s case, it&#39;s the latter, as they have an order-first-sit-later system that borders on frustrating, but it also builds up the anticipation for a noodle payoff that delivers bountifully. 

On a rainy mid-afternoon Saturday, the line to place lunch orders threaded through the rather small dining room, deterring anybody who needed immediate satisfaction. At first glance, the house specialty is confusing, as there is a refrigerated shelf of can drinks alongside a random collection of hot pot ingredients. But the dining room doesn&#39;t seem to be teeming with hot put customers, instead populated by noodle dishes (which, from my visit, proved to be the star of the show here). I stood in line for probably 10-15 minutes, watching an overworked but earnest staff manage the organized chaos as best they could. Service doesn&#39;t suck, believe it or not, but you will be a bit suspect of things until you get our food.  I was shocked when my first dish came out maybe three minutes from sitting down. And that was with the line even longer than when I first arrived!

Like any place that knows their strengths, the menu isn&#39;t exotic or vast, but focused on what it does well. It&#39;s a basic collection of noodle dishes, both soup and stir-fried, with a few different noodle options, and some predictable sides (spring rolls, jiaozis, etc). They do boast a few selections of Chinese &#34;street food,&#34; such as cumin-spiced meat burgers (lamb, ground beef, and chicken (I think)). These would be great for a filling on-the-go breakfast food, although between location and hours, I don&#39;t get the vibe that they&#39;re taking advantage of that market. 

My order was elementary - cumin-spiced &#34;spicy&#34;  lamb hand-cut noodles and a shredded beef burger. I think I&#39;m most taken with his restaurant by their magnificent noodles, which were long, thick, and had a sturdy al dente quality to it. I could have probably handled some extra noodles (available at extra cost), but the dish itself was hearty, plentiful, and delicious. In this case, the dish leans on the oilier side, with a generous mix of shredded lamb (I imagine a similar proportion of any other meat), with a smattering of red onions and green peppers. The &#34;spice factor&#34; was minimal at best, but that&#39;s fine by me. Enough for some sight kick, but not so much that you can&#39;t enjoy the other flavors. Of course, you can add more spices, sauce, or other additions from the table of Hot Pot ingredients that sit near the refrigerated shelves. 

From the looks of the house, it would seem like this caters to the local university community, with plenty of Mandarin-speakers present to vouch for authenticity. I would guess that busyness varies according to weather and time of day, so you may not have any option but to brace the crowd. That said, by the end of the meal, pure likely to feel as if you&#39;ve discovered a new place that belongs at the top of a Seattle&#39;s Best Noodles list"

It is a hole in the wall place, and definitely wants to be known for it&#39;s delicious eats. Their menu even asks you to give them 5 stars on YELP, but I don&#39;t just give out 5 stars to anyone...

It was a chilly night, so the noodle soup I got really hit the spot! We were asked to grab a table and then go order our food (should be the other way around). There are loads of tables inside, so as long as you go at a suitable time, you should have no problem finding a table. We both got the Cumin Lamb Noodle Soup, and it was a steal for the portion size and price (less than $10). The lamb was so tender and flavorful, but the hand-ripped noodles were a pain to eat! For a moment I just pierced the noodles with my chopsticks because I was so hungry! 

The staff was friendly, but the service could be improved! I would of also liked them to provide forks and knifes, for those not as comfortable using chopsticks. The large ladle was not needed as well, as I felt awkward slurping soup from a utensil that big.

I&#39;ve just been here once but it left a big impression on my taste buds, as well as a stain on my shirt. Xi&#39;an Noodles is a very understated little restaurant located up at the north end of the Ave, just past where all of the vegan stuff is. They serve a variety of Chinese food with which I am utterly unfamiliar (I presume from the Shaanxi Province in central China, where the city of Xi&#39;an is located).

I tried the cold spicy noodles, which is one of the vegetarian dishes, denoted by a green &#34;V&#34; on the menu...said menu also had a little chili pepper next to this item, and indeed it was spicy, but in an earthy, low-burn kind of way, not a guzzle water while weeping kind of way. And the noodles were just superb...thin and wide and delicate and perfectly cooked. A very simple but deeply satisfying dish.

Looking forward to coming back here and trying some of the other veggie offerings, particularly the warmer dishes now that the gray, drippy winter has set in."

I don&#39;t care much for soupy anything so I usually go for the dry noodles. My favorite is the lamb cumin noodles w/o soup, although the tingly beef noodles give them a run for their money. Fair warning, the dishes are somewhat spicy, so know your limits if you are spice-sensitive.

Protip: Ordering is done at the counter, after which you will be given a number to take to your table, or, if the tables are full, sit by the door to wait for a free one. Don&#39;t be a noob like me and sit by the door for 10 minutes waiting to be seated before even ordering."

stuff tried:

hot oil with ripped noodles (dry)- not too spicy but nice and flavorful!

Mount Qi pork with ripped noodles (dry)- different sauce base, almost has Spanish flavors

broccoli with garlic and chili sauce:  needed something green to offset the gluttony. but it was tasty.  if only all green things tasted so good.

pork burger/lamb burger:  sort of looks like a breakfast sandwich since the bread is sort of English muffin looking but lighter.  its better than any breakfast sandwich though! get the lamb one!

Lamb soup with bread chunks (PaoMo) a little bland.  the kind the soup you really want when you are sick in bed.

The place its pretty divvy which is awesome in my book.  Haven&#39;t tried the &#39;make your own&#39; Ma La Tang (stuff served in spicy broth) self serve station yet.   Need to try the rest of the noodle combos as they all seem really delicious!  check them out!"

Cafeteria-esque setting but very small place. Order at the front and find your own seat. No need to bus your own table. Ambient music is Bieber filled. They must be Bieber fans. Every song that played was either Chinese or Bieber. Not saying it&#39;s a bad thing but not everyone is a Bieber fan.

If you want a drink from the cooler, simply grab one and bring it to the front when you order--this method is a bit disconcerting for such a busy place (we saw a homeless man walk in and grab a drink and leave).

The cooler with all the hot pot foods is not very self-explanatory. We left still questioning what it was and how you order it--non of it is on the menu at all.

N3 Stewed Pork Hand-Ripped Noodles: Noodles are thick, wide, and just the right amount of chewy. Noodles don&#39;t have much flavor themselves but the meat is pretty salty so you need those noodles to counteract all that salt. The meat is very soft and &#34;pulled&#34; pork-like, so the texture is good. Comes with cabbage as well--not too wilted and still had some crunch.

Even though I only had one menu item, I have to say that nothing really seemed to &#34;wow&#34; my experience here. This place has more of the feeling of a &#34;home cooked&#34; meal rather than a &#34;restaurant&#34; so I can see why so many international students like this place. Perhaps it&#39;s a sign of being truly authentic."

I&#39;ve been here three times already and my love of this place has not waned.  No where else in the area (that I am aware of) can you get biang biang style noodles.  These noodles are simultaneously chewy, thick, and wide.  Each dish is topped with simple, yet flavorful toppings, such as their stewed pork and cilantro garnish.

My favorite dishes are the tomato egg hand-ripped noodle, stewed pork hand-ripped noodle, and the garlic cucumber salad.  Surprisingly, I ordered the tomato egg on initial visit, and it&#39;s now my boyfriend&#39;s favorite dish.  This is surprising because he&#39;s a real meat eater when it comes to dinner.  However, he loves the tomato egg!  The tomato egg noodle has a very good flavor, almost buttery.  The soft shredded stewed pork is always perfectly prepared and tasty, too.  Their Chinese hamburgers are pretty good, too, if you&#39;re on the go and want a delicious snack.  I&#39;d recommend the lamb or pork burger.  Chinese hamburgers are more like harder, English muffin-type bread with shredded meats in the center.  I do wish there were greens inside, though.  A little cilantro or lettuce goes a long way!

Best part? Each noodle dish is generously portioned, and only $10 each.  Appetizers and street food (like the aforementioned hamburger) are around $5 each.  Simple, delicious, no frills. The best kind of restaurant =)

Fun fact:  I was reading about the Chinese character for &#34;biang&#34; online - it&#39;s one of the most complex characters in the Chinse language, composed of a whopping 58 strokes in traditional form and 43 in simplified Chinese!"

I don&#39;t go to this part of U-District much but now I have a reason to come back.  It&#39;s a medium sized place, pretty simple &amp; plain décor but whatever.  Go up to the counter and order and they will bring out your food to you.

Not a huge menu to choose from, but that&#39;s ok. They have house specials like &#34;burgers&#34;, their hand-ripped noodles, some appetizer salads, &#34;street food&#34; as in dumplings and egg rolls, rice noodles, build your own noodle dish area, and smoothie/ milk tea drinks. 

We shared a few dishes among us and got the Potstickers to try and they were pretty good, super piping hot off the hot wok, slightly smaller in size but it was tasty!  Nice little soy/green onion dipping sauce on the side too.  I like it was not deep fried and more pan fried to a crisp.

Cumin Lamb Burger was pretty good too, the bread for the burger was a thinner dough, kind of like an English muffin, but the meat was flavorful. No other accoutrements come with this like lettuce, tomato, cheese or any of that.  Its just the meat &amp; bread, that&#39;s it. Glad to check this out and would get it again. Pretty good to split as an appetizer too.  

Also, we got the Cumin Beef Biang Noodles w/out soup, it was way too hot outside to have soup and I&#39;m already sweating (No AC inside the restaurant). Can taste the cumin, kind of wished they went heavier on the spice. I was anticipating that it would be spicy but it wasn&#39;t. There&#39;s a little hot sauce station if you need to jazz it up a few notches. Noodles were fresh &amp; wonderful, seemed it was hand-ripped as they were of different sizes as you may get a short one or a super duper long one. Noodles were the highlight of the meal and I totally enjoyed it. Not a whole lot of veg in the dish though. In my opinion, the dishes weren&#39;t small portions but good enough to make you full, but not Thanksgiving kind of full.  

Staff was very nice to accommodate such a large group, they were gladly to put a few tables and gather some chairs for us etc. You typically have to go up front to order but they provided us table service and took our orders, very nice of them to do that and don&#39;t expect that if you bring 10 of your friends. Staff was working hard to get our food out and brought it out quickly when it was ready. Prices were pretty good and they were quick on doing the bills and able to split checks and group people together for easier check out.  

Will have to come back and check out more of their dishes in the near future."

Further up University Way than most people wander, but definitely worth the trip. The noodles are just right. The beef tingly noodles are just the right amount of spicy and savory, and the noodles with pork are good too (but I didn&#39;t love them quite as much).

When I took my bf here, he was pretty happy to find a &#34;legit Mala tang&#34; place. Apparently, it&#39;s hard to find real mala tang where they have the good spicy broth, and this bowl for you to fill up with goodies. 

We grabbed a large plastic bowl, threw in meat, spam, noodles, veggies and had it weighed. For mala tang, you choose the broth you want and they bring your food out cooked in that soup. The mala tang was SO GOOD. My bf (originally from China) raved about how this is the closest to &#34;authentic and tasty&#34; mala tang he has found outside of China.

We also tried the hand ripped noodles with beef and the one with lamb. Get the noodles WITHOUT the soup. I always find that the soup ruins the chewiness of the noodles. These noodles were thick and chewy and tasted like Big Plate Chicken at Chinese Halal places....if you&#39;re not familiar, just get it. The noodles, sauce, and the meat were a mix of spicy, chewy, and flavorful...sooo good. 

This was by far the most satisfying meal we had during vacation. Need one of these in Southern California."

However, if you&#39;re craving delicious Asian noodles close to UW, make the trek out and you won&#39;t be disappointed.

I ordered the stewed pork noodles. Service was fast and courteous. Noodles were obviously handmade and perfectly chewy and silky. The pork was nicely seasoned and went well with the rice noodles. However, the pork was more reminiscent of pulled pork rather than Chinese stewed pork, and there were weird shreds of lettuce scattered throughout the dish that were oddly cut and didn&#39;t fit well with the dish. 

Overall, this was a good meal that satisfied my noodle craving, but still was lacking in some element. Maybe could benefit from more veggies or seasoning other than just a few shreds of lettuce."

I tried the hand pulled noodles with egg and tomato. I was afraid they would be a bit lacking in taste but the garlic they used in it definitely keeps them from being tasteless. My breath was rather ferocious for many hours after eating there. I also ordered a side of what I think was bean sprouts and gluten. I can&#39;t exactly remember the name but it was awesome! I want to go back for more of both!

My friend ordered a soup with lamb. The soup didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor but the lamb was good and tender.

I love hand-pulled noodles, so I was very excited to find this place. I ordered the hot chili oil noodles and the spicy cucumber salad. I didn&#39;t love the noodles because they weren&#39;t chewy enough. They were a little dense from what I recall, and they tasted a little cold. The chili oil was good though - not too spicy and my noodles weren&#39;t drenched in it. 

This is a really convenient place for UW students, and I can see why it could get crowded here fast. We came on a Sunday night for a fairly late dinner (~8:30 PM), and it took a while to sit down at a table - maybe 25-30 minutes."

Pros: 
~Interior of the place is very spacious with plenty of room to sit. 
~Tables are bussed by the staff pretty quickly.
~Menus are displayed everywhere.
~5% discount if you choose to pay in cash.
~Ordering Process: You order &amp; pay first. You then get an assigned number. Then you go ahead and seat yourself where ever there is room.
~Our one dish that had hair in it, was replaced pretty promptly
~Prices: All dishes are under $10!

Cons:
~Service is so-so. Cashier was very curt and wasn&#39;t too helpful at all when my friend and I had questions regarding the menu. 
~Hair in our noodle dish was a major turn-off
~Food was lukewarm. Never had Xian food before, so not sure if the food was meant to be served this way?
~Located beyond 50th and closer to 52nd, it&#39;s quite a walk from the ave. 

Food Quality: 3.5/5
My friend and I opted to split: Lamb burger, Heart spicy noodles (this dish has glass noodles!), and the stewed pork noodles. For the lamb burger, it was a bit pricey ($4.99) for a small little thing and the taste of it reminded me of Indian flavored lamb due to the cumin like taste. The bun was crispy but I found the whole thing to be a smidgen too salty. As for the spicy noodles, this was pretty good! The broth wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly spicy and had a nice texture to it. I think it would have been even better if the noodles were hot instead of lukewarm to cold in minutes of being served to us. Finally, the stewed pork noodles.

It is very gross to see hair wrapped / entwined within the noodles.....Needless to say, we brought this to the staff&#39;s attention and our dish was immediately replaced without much question. The noodles itself was creamy with a slight chewiness and the pork was pretty well seasoned. Despite the decent tasting, my friend and I couldn&#39;t help but be extra paranoid in examining every bite since finding that hair. Aii. At least I can say I gave this place a try!"

If it weren&#39;t for Sara C&#39;s review on the Cumin Lamb Hand Ripped Noodles, I most likely wouldn&#39;t have known about Xi&#39;an (thanks Sara!). The restaurant is located on the northern end of The Ave, which I haven&#39;t frequented since the closing the Pochi &amp; Hawaiian BBQ&#39;s original location.

When you enter, you just walk up to counter to order. They have a couple of laminated copies of the menu so grab one. That way, by the time its your turn to order you&#39;ll already know what you want. After you place your order, they will give you a number, and then find yourself a table. They do emphasize that you will get a 5% discount if you pay in cash but since I&#39;m ordering 1 item, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth saving an extra 40-sumthin cents to run down to the ATM on 47th. Also, they will tack on a 15% gratuity charge if you bring in a group of 5 or more, which seems reasonable, as other restaurants in the city will go 18%-20%.

Anyways, I&#39;m sure many of you didn&#39;t care for what I just wrote so I&#39;ll get to talking about the important matter at hand: THE FOOOOD! 

For my first visit here, I obviously went for the Cumin Lamb Hand Ripped Noodles w/o soup. ($9.85 w/o tip). The wide flat noodles seem to go on for days, and I have a soft spot for long noodles. for my first bite, I made sure I constructed it perfectly: twirl a portion of the noodles, sop it in the sauce and top it with some of the lamb and cilantro. For a dish that may seem simple visually, there was so much flavor in that first bite. The noodles were heavenly to savor the chewiness, while the tender lamb packed in the flavor. The sauce (or oils?) gave it the right amount of heat.

I also got to sample the braised pork noodle and lamb burger. I recommend the pork for those who don&#39;t like chilies or heat in their food. The lamb burger was delicious, in fact one of the better one&#39;s I&#39;ve tried (I&#39;m looking at you Dough Zone!). Its hard to choose if I want a noodle dish or the burger, since having both was filling for me but the cashier recommended that most people order the burger with a small side of their cold noodles. I&#39;ll have to try that some other time.

I think Xi&#39;an is worth the trip to the U-District. The portions are just right and priced well."

Parking karma to get a spot right out front, versus the congestion of the ID, I took this as a positive sign.

Entered and knew it was a jackpot, because just about everyone in this modest restaurant space were of Asian descent. 

The cashier/counterperson was helpful and made various recommendations. Ordering tips though, most of the placemat sized menu is crossed out and not available. There&#39;s also a 5% discount if one&#39;s order is paid in cash vs. debit or credit. A number is given and the orders are delivered to your table directly. 

Entrées ordered ($8.95 each) were the Spicy Tingly Beef Hand Ripped Noodles without soup and the Stewed Pork Hand Ripped Noodles with soup. Both are garnished bean sprouts and cilantro, except the former also had red and green peppers. 

The hand ripped noodles (biang biang style) were fresh, toothsome/al dente, and very filling. Each broth were of distinctive flavor profiles. I did amp up my soup with the green onion laden potsticker dipping sauce. 

The potstickers ($6.99) were excellent vehicles to get copious amount of heat and complex flavors from that memorable dipping sauce. I couldn&#39;t feel my lips anymore, yet I would gladly polish it off as shots. Delicious slow burn!

Large tumblers of ice water were provided although there are assorted milk tea flavors, sodas, and Asian beverages available.

Also, I also watched other diners customized their entrées, by taking a plastic bin, fill it with the contents of many ingredients in the refrigerated case. Looks like it is paid by weight.

Spare, functional kitchen and dining area, but what are  brought out (dine in, takeout, or delivery) are simply amazing. I look forward to return visits and to try other items from the menu.

Still curious what was considered Custom Item on the receipt for $1...really didn&#39;t care in the end, just thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to Xi&#39;an Noodles!"

I really liked this place because of the handmade  noodles. I haven&#39;t had anything authentic like this in a long time. It kind of takes me back to when I went to China and I told my family that I loved noodles...they brought me to every noodle place in the city it seemed like. hahah

What I didn&#39;t like about this place...half their menu is crossed out. I wasn&#39;t even sure that what I wanted was on the menu because it looked like everything was gone. And it was only open for a couple of weeks...

I also got very sparse amount of meat on my dish. I got close to 5 pieces. 

I got a dry noodle dish, boyfriend got a soup. I would recommend getting the soup, it seems like they&#39;re a bit more generous with all the ingredients when you get soup. 

I also thought the layout was kind of weird. They have signs for everything...but there was no sign that you order first before seating yourself. Then there was no one to really direct us because they were too busy trying to figure out tip money...

Came here on a Sunday for dinner around 6pm. Plenty of street parking available. Upon entering, walk straight up to the counter as that is where you place your order. The staff were polite and greeted me in Mandarin! I was still waiting for a friend and tables were filling up so they told me to wait at a table and gave me a menu. Since my friend was going to take another 40 minutes to get there and I felt bad for occupying a table and was getting hungry, I decided to place my order after deciding what I wanted to order.

We had the biang biang noodle (thick hand pulled kind) without soup. I had the one with cumin lamb (not too spicy). And I ordered the stewed pork noodle without soup for my friend since she doesn&#39;t eat spice (think zero stars). My friend is also allergic to nuts so I mentioned that to the server and she was very polite. 

The food came out about 15-20 minutes later. Just in time for my friend to arrive. The serving sizes are quite large and we ended up with half a serving to take home.

I thought the noodle dish was quite tasty and similar to what I had in Xi&#39;an albeit it has been probably 10 years since I visited. I will be back to try their other varieties; many items on the menu were crossed out. Perhaps they are new and just focusing on mastering certain items first?

I ordered the tingly beef hand ripped noodles with soup--tingly meaning &#34;numb spicy.&#34; But don&#39;t fear, the intimidating layer of chili oil isn&#39;t too spicy. It adds just the right amount of bang to the beautifully handmade biang biang noodles. My friends ordered the version without soup (due to the hot weather, which was definitely a good choice) and it looked delicious as well.

Keep in mind that this place doesn&#39;t open until noon, so it&#39;s a no-go if you&#39;re trying to catch an early lunch.

But other than their cold noodles and some of their appetizers everything else falls flat. The hand ripped noodles are too thick and grainy for my taste. 

The place is kind of dirty the first 2 times I was there. I also happen to visit them during one of the few hot days of Seattle and the place had no AC, no fans, no airflow. It was a steam room in there with all the cooking. I don&#39;t really know if that is up to code to be honest. We broke a sweat within 5 minutes of being there and sweat through the rest of the time while we tried our best to finish the meal quickly. 

The female cashier is seriously so annoying. I went there 3 times and she has just been so rude. Not going to go into detail about it but it was just such a turn off for me. I love their cold noodles and hot sauce but I won&#39;t be back since there are better places on the Ave.

Protip: If you use cash you get 5% off.

In response to Business Owner:
1. At the time of my visit there was no air conditioning or fan. I&#39;m glad you guys have installed the air cooler.
2. You are right, it&#39;s 5% off with cash, my mistake and typo. 
3. The lady at the cashier was very rude and curt. 

First time I visited I asked for a small liangpi and she said &#34;Are you sure you don&#39;t want a Large?&#34; In which I replied &#34;Yes&#34; and then she asked again, &#34;But are you sure you don&#39;t want a large?&#34; &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m sure.&#34; &#34;But we also have a large size?&#34; Complete that with her curt attitude it really was a turn off.

Im not going to go on for 2nd and 3rd visit. I have more than 150 reviews and 3 years of being a Yelp Elite, which by no means is anything to write home about but I don&#39;t need to make things up or have unrealistic standards. 

I think after 3 times I visited, I gave correct information about the times I had visited, no AC, that&#39;s my real experience. Just because you have it now, doesn&#39;t take away the times you didn&#39;t have AC. Unless you want to state that from the time you opened till now, the restaurant has never been absent of an AC.

We ordered the baby fungus, potstickers, and noodles with chili oil (no soup). We took a number and a glass of water from the tray and seated ourselves. The food came quickly. The fungus (turned out to be wood ear) was room temperature/slightly warm and it really should have been cold. I think the temperature ruined this dish and it made me question their food handling safety. The potstickers were OK and I would not order again. The noodles were really, really good.

That&#39;s usually a good sign but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just hype or did they order something I didn&#39;t get. We got the cumin lamb with ripped noodles, which was pretty good. The chili wontons and the spring rolls were just meh. I&#39;m glad we tried it though."

This place is run by legit mainland Chinese people, which gives it a super authentic feel. At this place, you got up to order first and then you queue up for a table. I was there a week ago on a Saturday (around 1:30pm) and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.

The handmade biangbiang noodles are incredibly satisfying to eat, probably the best noodles I&#39;ve eaten in Seattle. We got two soup-less noodles: spicy beef, and a non spicy pork. Both were great, but I&#39;d very very highly recommend the non spicy pork one.

A must-go restaurant!"

Tried the lamb spicy cumin hand shaven noodle with soup, will be back for it many more times. Just the right amount of spice. Lamb and broth were both so flavorful. 

Everyone working was super friendly and helpful.

In my highest opinion....best Chinese noodle spot in Seattle. Can&#39;t wait to try the Ma La Tang."

Texture of the noodles were GREAT but only seasoning or flavor you ever get is out of the braised pork so after a while it feels plain.

They were very good. Hand-ripped noodles were cooked right; broth was well seasoned, not too salty. The pork burger was good but could use a little more meat. For a $5.50 &#34;burger&#34;, I would&#39;ve expected a little more in the bun than just thin layer of meat. 

The place also had a section on the side where they had a selection of toppings (?) that you can put in your soup. They were left open which would&#39;ve looked much more sanitary if kept closed/covered. The restaurant itself was also a bit disordered and could use a bit of a workflow.

I would come back since their noodles were good, but considering the location -- on the far north on the Ave, I think prices can be a bit lower."

They really let their noodles do the talking; I&#39;m usually a sauce fanatic, but I wasn&#39;t the least bit mad about their use of subtler flavors and low sauce-to-noodle ratio. The beef was plentiful and very tender. The dish had an understated numbing spice component, which I would have preferred a little more of. I tried some of my brother&#39;s pork bun and my mother&#39;s spicy and sour rice noodles in broth, both of which were hits."

I&#39;m not from mainland China but my friend who is seems to think the food here is pretty authentic (northern style) and it makes him nostalgic.

We ordered a variety of dry noodle dishes (pork, lamb, tomato egg) and we tried the infamous liang pi which was quite tasty. I&#39;m a fan of their noodles since its fresh and chewy, kind of similar to hand shaven noodles.

Overall, pretty solid place. Would recommend to my Seattle friends from China who crave authentic northern style Chinese food."

Loved the beef dish with hand pulled noodles and garlic and cucumber.  It was very light and fresh.  The lamb soup is more for a cold day and is very hearty.  We noticed that there was a shelf with various drinks and even veggies that can be put into a broth for soup such as watercress.  Will definitely be back to come try a customized soup in the future!

Long, uncut noodles symbolize long life and fortune in Chinese culture right? (So my sister says)

Anyway, the beef noodle soup was the best in my opinion and the hot chilli oil noodles were also good and had a tingly spice and kick to it.

They need to step it up a bit with the decor and the hot pot setup is a bit sketchy. The tap water they serve you tastes disgusting.

All in all, worth it to try but I would much rather go eat at Mike&#39;s noodle house in Chinatown."

I was so pleasantly surprised when I picked out a menu to see so many of my favorite dishes that I haven&#39;t been able to find anywhere else in Seattle. Hand-pulled noodles, wontons in chili sauce, soybean salad, garlic cucumber salad.... I was in love.

A friend and I decided to split the Spicy Cumin Lamb Hand-Ripped Noodles w/o soup and the Stir Fried Tomato Egg Hand-Ripped Noodles w/o soup. The service was a little slow (and our friend&#39;s dish unfortunately came much later than ours) but ahhhh I can forgive them because this all was so good.

Got the stewed pork and hand ripped noodles both times, second time got the wontons in spicy sauce as well. Very satisfying and there was a lot more flavor than I expected from the noodle dish. The noodles had a chewy texture and the pork was extremely tender and flavorful. The wontons weren&#39;t too spicy or overpowering, and they came in a large amount of spicy broth. 

THE PROBLEM: 

The first time I ate here, I had a moderate allergic reaction a few hours later and I was unsure why. Second time, I had the same allergic reaction. Itchy skin, wheezing, cough, a bit of a tight chest.

Unfortunately because of this, I will no longer be eating here. I don&#39;t know what ingredient caused it, considering nothing seemed out of the ordinary for my diet. I&#39;ve also never had a food related allergy before. I&#39;m assuming it was some sort of seasoning or additive.

I wish this weren&#39;t the case, it was so delicious! I have a bunch of leftovers after today and I have to give them to my brother :("

This restaurant seems to have copied most of the XFF menu, but didn&#39;t manage to copy the food.

We ended up getting the N2 and N3. I&#39;m used to the strong flavors from XFF so this place was a very toned down version with more delicate flavors. The stewed pork in N3 was tender and very flavorful, but the overall dish was a bit bland, not spicy at all, with the strongest flavor being garlic. N2 was also alright, not spicy enough. The noodles were definitely the highlight of the dishes, very chewy and correctly done. I will have to come back to try their N4 and hope it&#39;s as addictive as the version at XFF.

The ma la tang was very meh, there was really no flavor to the soup. They seem to really skimp on spices and seasoning here. =/"

Starting from the food... I was really excited when this place opened as I love Xi&#39;An noodles and there aren&#39;t much to offer nearby. The pictures on yelp looked beyond delicious and the reviews were amazing. So i thought it couldn&#39;t go wrong.... That was the first mistake I made! Some reviews can be faked.. and this is one of those places. I got the hand pulled tingling beef noodles - the noodles were not impressive at all, they were not chewy and had terrible texture. The flavor was pretty meh as well. I had to add spoon fulls of chili oil make it tasteful. I also ordered the Hong You Chao Shou also known as Won-ton in chilli sauce- these were by far the worst. I don&#39;t think they should serve them if they don&#39;t make it well. I didn&#39;t even finish it. It was really disappointing. 
Lastly, the service was not that great. This place literally has nothing to offer. The owner seems to like to bother each negative reviewer, so I am definitely expecting her to ping me soon."

The main selling point of this place is the hand pulled noodles. This is the -one- thing they get right here. 

Everything else, not so much. The ma la flavor is seriously watered down in every dish we ordered. I ordered the hand pulled noodles with beef, wife ordered the noodles with vegetables. In both cases it was a mass of noodles with small shreds of beef or a few sad vegetables.

We also got the marinated cucumbers (not marinated long enough) and the dumplings in red chili oil (dumplings were good, the chili oil watered down).

In short, the only reason I can see why it has 4.5 stars is because it is cheap and the noodles are decent. That&#39;s of prime consideration if you&#39;re a not-wealth overburdened college student.

If things have changed for you, though, I&#39;d recommend you go elsewhere.

Edit: nice snarky comment in Chinese there by management. To translate for everyone else, she said: &#39;All I can say is that you&#39;re in your own class of finicky.&#39; I leave it to my fellow Yelpers to determine if this is the type of restaurant you want to go to."

Very disappointing to see that there&#39;s literally more than half the items unavailable. So, I hope you don&#39;t want anything with rice, because...that&#39;s crossed out too. Even a portion of the noodle dishes were unavailable, leaving a lot of spicy dishes vs. unspicy dishes. 

You get a 5% discount if you pay with cash, which seems to be important for them to stress when you check out. I think the cheapness of the business is what&#39;s led them to not reprint menus, instead just using marker to cross things out. Bad impression."

I can tell the  noodles are handmade fresh and the liangpi is very on point! They seem to always sell out which I can understand since I can imagine how much time and effort is put into making fresh noodles and liangpi everyday. I will definitely eat here often from now on.

A bit of history - it used to be called &#34;QQ noodle&#34; in UW and recently just opened at a new place. The food has always been amazing and tastes very authentic (according to my friends from Xi&#39;an,China).  Pita Bread Soaked in Lamb Soup is a must-try,  Chinese hamburger and all the noodles are great too.  Not to mention their self-picked hotpot soup, just amazing. 

The owners are a Chinese couple, amazing people with gentle heart,  and it always feels like going back home and having home-cooked Chinese food. 

All in all, great place great people and amazing food, highly recommended!!"
xian-noodles-seattle-2,Sherry Y.,vPjoIns0wwsFpGSei74Wtw,"Mayfield Heights, OH",0,1,1,0,17,fWxWU1SQj7VTPLGOvVPXrg,1.0,2016-08-21,"I guess... I&#39;m ready to get the reply from the manger...soon..

1. I picked the ingredients for &#34;malatang&#34; and then waited in the line to check out. Then  the cashier said &#34;the minimum weight of malatang has to be 1 pound&#34;. I looked around and didn&#39;t see any signs about that rule. 
In a normal  day, I&#39;d prbly add something to the bowl, no biggies. However today I truly wasn&#39;t that hungry. My family is in town and we had a big lunch. So for the dinner, they were getting some yogurt; whereas I was gonna grab something light here.

So I said, &#34;well, there is no sign for it.&#34; The cashier replied, &#34;No, we don&#39;t have sign, but we will have it next time.&#34; -- um, ok... not exactly the reply that I was looking for.


2. I didn&#39;t fully understand the logic there, so I was like, oh well, I will get something else instead. Then the cashier said &#34;no, you have to meet the 1 pound rule, or you pay the price for the 1 pound in full, because you took out the ingredients and they were &#39;contaminated&#39; and we couldn&#39;t serve that to some other customer&#34;. I looked around again, and see no sign about this &#39;final sale&#39; rule.
 And just to clarify, &#39;malatang&#39; has to be cooked anyways, so I started to get a little unhappy, as the cashier, IMO, was being a little rude.

3. I still tried to work things out, so I thought to myself and thinking maybe they were just not happy about me not spending enough money. So naively, i offered to buy some additional items to raise my minimum cost, thinking my family would like it. But still, I was told a big &#34;NO&#34;, apparently it&#39;s not about the money, but about the 1 pound rule of malatang.

4. So I decided to reason with this cashier, and said &#34; you don&#39;t have a sign and you expect the customer to follow the rule and can&#39;t cancel their order, do you think that&#39;s reasonable?&#34; She said, yes, because, 1 pound is reasonable. Honestly, I laughed, right there. I literally had no word for it, what if in my world, for some reasons, I think half a pound is more reasonable because I was looking for a snack? (For your interests, my food weighed 0.7 pound)

5. At that point of time, I asked if I could get some help from her manager. She said she would call and told me I need to wait. However she actually asked another waitress to check if the manger was inside of her car outside of the restaurant. I saw someone approach that car and talk to the driver, but nobody gave me an update. Then a waiter came by and told me to wait at the table. I figured they weren&#39;t happy so I politely waited by the door.

6. 10 mins later, no updates, so I went back to the cashier and asked if she knows when the manger is going to come back. She told me she had no clue. So I asked if the person in the car right outside of the restaurant was the manager, she told me she was the manger but not the owner. 
(For who can speak Chinese, my question was, 车里的那个菇凉是你们老板咩，and her reply was 那个是我们的manager, 不是老板 ) 
So I asked once again, if that so called manager could potentially talk to me, and guess what, she said NO. In this restaurant, apparently the manager is not responsible for solving customer issues. Then I asked when is the owner going to show up, and was told no idea.

7. My family called me saying they got their food and were going to pick me up, whereas this owner/manager still hasn&#39;t showed up. I left the restaurant with no food, and thanks to the rudeness of the cashier, a bad mood."

Most places just have overly sweet/salty food, yet lacking flavor, cornstarch sauce slapped on top of some unfortunate meat, veggie, or fish. That&#39;s not real Chinese food, which should have really clean distinctive flavors. 

We were so happy to see Xi&#39;an Noodles open after the owner had to close her previous location when the store she was renting from closed. The Liang Pi noodles actually have flavor (sour from the black vinegar, a little spice from the chili oil, savory from sesame oil). Order anything on the house specialties or hand-pulled noodle section or hot pot/dry pot. Don&#39;t be silly and order from the American Chinese dishes. 

On opening day the kitchen was super super slow (waited 1 hour for our 3 dishes), so I do hope they&#39;ll straighten that out soon or it&#39;ll hold them back. But given that I waited years to have a nearby option besides DTF, I can wait a little longer."

Loved the liang pi and cumin beef burgers - savory with tad spice. Wished there was more of a Chinese veggie menu. 

Noticed most of the menu was crossed off (dry pot, side dishes, beverages, etc) on weekday night, but we definitely were served promptly. No 1 hour wait. Looks like they&#39;re nailing down operations!"

Ive been here once or twice a week at various times of the day since they opened. This red tipped girl was present for at least half my visits.  So its just after 3:30 pm and not busy in the dining room, not many customers, employees on break.  I walk in and this same girl immediately bombards me with a cutesy how can i help you but hastily tries to physically entrap me like a velociraptor with a menu. I tell her im going to wash up and use the restroom first.  So after her insincere greeting i beeline for the restroom taking no heed as i dart in bypassing and ignoring her irrelevant, stern and broken slurred English warning &#34;restroom for customers only&#34; blah blah  blah.  No ones listening.  She was attempting to bully me into placing an order first as if it was a sin to not place an order with her at her demand.  Such artificial hospitality.  Thats the first thing that does not jive with me. 

After i have utilized the facilities to my comfort i place my order with a nice young man.  Its lunch and im hungry but didnt want anything too filling so i didnt order my usual stewed pork hand ripped noodle dish l mostly get for dinner. It was such a hot day so I didn&#39;t want to be carrying around left overs either. So cold noodles sound good.  I never tried it before.  There is a small and a large order. Then i told him i wanted meat.  I inquired and he advised and FYI i was able to get stewed pork for $2 more just as i liked.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful to that point. I asked him what was the difference in ingredients between the cold noodles and the hand ripped noodles.  He made a good attempt with concerted effort and after i prompted, he still didn&#39;t know what or how to describe it.  I already placed my order with him and i was fine with what i ordered but he didn&#39;t finalize the order.  He asks help from this same girl and i commend him for seeking the proper answer for me and him wanting this knowledge as well. This girl immediately takes over the till trying to push my order through without acknowledging my request. This is pet peeve number two. 

I still wanted to know the proper answer to my question. So i insisted on knowing the difference between the two noodles to make a more formidable decision. They pressed some button on the tablet screen which popped up the ingredients. Both are made with flour,  but it revealed that hand ripped has water and also contains some preservative identified with a long chemical number. Easy choice.  Im sticking with the cold noodles. Im not paying more for water and strange chemicals just to make my my noodles look and feel bumpy. 

I really just wanted to sense a texture comparison.  It is not like a chow mein noodle as he described but more of a wider,  thinner fettuccine, similar weight to the hand ripped but flat, not wavy and airy.  She still insists cold noodles would not taste good with hot stewed pork and i insist it is fine. So i ask her to repeat the order, reminding her of the stewed pork. At this point my order is up to $9.50 and says shes gonna charge fifty cents additional for using a debit card for under $10. There is no sign indicating this extra fee for such purchases. Only cash gets 10% discount.  So at this point, it was obvious she was all about attitude and brings us to number 3.

So i add a can of Sprite along with my Nutri Express apple flavored soybean drink, and my small order of cold noodles to reach the threshold and transaction finalized.  So after a few minutes she serves my cold noodle dish and i quickly look and the stewed pork i had ordered which i had repeated twice to her wasn&#39;t in or on there.  So i asked her why it wasn&#39;t cause i told her it wasn&#39;t on there like i asked. She said she didnt add it because SHE thinks it wont taste good.  She is really some serious control freak noodle nazi. I am the customer so serve me what i want and request.  I would appreciate not being condescended for my preferences.  Quit telling me what i like and shouldn&#39;t like.  Such rude behavior!  This is now an all out battle - #4.

So she takes back my can of sprite from my table to offset the cost and finally brings me my side of stewed pork. She was just mad cause she couldnt upsell me to the $9.99 hand ripped stewed pork noodles and i only paid $8.49. At this point after all the bs I&#39;ve put up with i should have just got free meat.  This is now #5.

The male cashier was nice this visit and one girl at a prior visit was genuine and exceptional. This rude girl is just one big bad seed growing into a noxious weed, infiltrating and damaging the good thats thriving.  I just want to enjoy my visit when im here -food,  ambiance,  service without a hassle.  They do have good food here. Their stewed pork has great flavor so i will still patronize this place,  and yes my cold noodle stewed pork creation was perfect :p"

Food, always on the money! Been here about...4 times now and haven&#39;t been disappointed once. However, my first time I just got the plain hand pulled noodles in a soup and the overall experience left a lot to be desired. My recommendation, get something with hot chili or sauce on it. The noodles by themselves, while really good, are super bland. However, they are amazingly chewy (they have that elasticity that you would hope for from hand made noodles) and satisfying.

Service, it&#39;s aight. Don&#39;t walk in and wait to be seated, they don&#39;t do that here. Walk in, go to the front register, order your food, take a number and then sit down (if a table is available). They will come out to you eventually. In my experience, its a bit hit and miss. They might bring you water before your meal, they might not. Not terrible, but not the best.

Overall, really love this place. Some tips for first timers, if you go on a weekend/Friday expect there to be a line out the door. Seating is first come first serve, and people tend to linger after they finish so if you&#39;re looking for a quick bit and they&#39;re busy maybe consider to-go. And, finally, don&#39;t get just plain noodles, all of the goodness/flavor is in their many sauces."

I&#39;m so glad to see these guys have finally gotten the ratings they deserve here. This place is just a treasure, a simple little lunch-counter environment that does a really interesting and uncommon cuisine quickly, politely, and simply.

It didn&#39;t have that unique flavor that homemade pasta or hand made noodles usually do. The noodles were also very clumpy, so you&#39;d get a bite of noodle block, then some meat or sauce. It didn&#39;t blend well. They&#39;re also the kind of restaurant that doesn&#39;t know how to separate &#34;spice&#34; from &#34;spicy&#34; though, as I got the non spicy dish. The spicy one my friend got was much better and wasn&#39;t even that spicy. Flavor was decent for that one. Something that left a bad taste in my mouth was when after we had already paid and sat down, we saw some friends and decided to move our tables together. Upon doing that, they went nuts saying that we had to pay an additional service fee. Sure, many restaurants have that rule, but they usually seat you and are organized about it. You know what you&#39;re getting ahead of time. In this case, it was a surprise, very unpleasant, and we kind of just wanted to move our chairs back, but they just came at us with additional bills for a few bucks. The manager was staring us down and the workers looked scared and very uncomfortable for having to ask us for this fee. This is after some of us had already left a tip upon paying. This isn&#39;t exactly a top tier establishment either, I would even say that a full tip is even expected the way it was run. We had to wait in line to pay, we had to find our own seats, they don&#39;t take your order, they didn&#39;t even give us water until after they decided to lay this additional charge on us for talking to our friends. Suffice it to say, they value a few bucks over the happiness of their customers. Will not be going back, not just because they were kind of unorganized and mean, but because these noodles are not worth the trip.

My wife, kids and I shared pot stickers, pork stewed rice, noodles with spicy tingly beef, hand-ripped noodles with pork in soup, and a simple rice noodles in broth.

All was excellent (though the rice noodles in broth, ordered mainly for my kids was relatively plain -- but that was sort of why I ordered it).

The tingly beef was the main attraction. Great noodles. Interesting flavors. Not too hot, but with some spice, for sure. The pork on the rice was great and yes, even the pot stickers (I know ... not exactly adventurous) were well above normal.

I&#39;m sure there are a lot of dishes left to try that I&#39;d love, and the make-it-yourself stuff is beyond my level, but I&#39;d highly recommend.

Loco Moco: Comes in a large bowl filled with gravy (like it was soup) with a small bowl of rice, burger, then an egg on top. Then there was some mac salad on the side. I thought it was okay but I was not too much of a fan, especially with it so drenched in gravy that it made my rice quite mushy... :( The mac salad, honestly, was disgusting with way too much pickles. Ohana Burger: Very mad, I did not get to taste it!!!! He did tell me that it isn&#39;t that great and not special at all. The fries though were pretty good, crunchy. We also grabbed a pina colada to share. We went virgin that night, kinda regret it see pics of those upside down corona drinks but next time!! I really enjoyed the pina colada though, omg!!! (I&#39;m a big blended drinks fan lol!)

Our meal ended up nearly ~$50 + 18% gratuity, which in all honestly I felt like it was not deserved. Our waitress was kind of offish and seemed mad the whole time though I can guarantee our group was not being chaotic or messy at all. She also wasn&#39;t around and did not check up on us a lot, especially to refill our water cups.

Overall: I gave it a 3. Not a place I wouldn&#39;t come back to but not a place I would bother much to come back."

For food I had the spicy tuna roll which was actually spicy! I&#39;ve found that most spicy tuna rolls from other places aren&#39;t spicy at all. So that was much appreciated. The miso soup is pretty standard, not amazing but good. Food is a little expensive but not too horrible. 

For drinks I had a sake bomb with Sapporo and the hot house sake. I do have to say that the chilled house sake is a bit more enjoyable to drink. If you want some bubbles the sparkling sake is a good choice, and probably easier to down than the other options. The bartender mixed up a decent Washington Apple (usually a mixture of Crown Royal, sour apple pucker and cranberry juice) and I don&#39;t even normally like whisky. I also had what kind of tasted like a kamikaze (usually vodka, triple sec and lime juice) and that was good too. Not sure if it was lime or lemon but the juice seemed fresh. 

My group sat at a table but the bar is super festive and fun. Service was good, no complaints there. At 10 on a Thursday a DJ started to play popular current music but I also enjoyed the raggaeish music they had on earlier. I guess you can dance by the DJ (umm yes I did for a couple songs) but maybe that&#39;s more of a weekend thing? 

Side note, the bathroom stall doors are shower curtains, which wasn&#39;t a problem when I went because no one else was there but just be prepared in case someone tries to whip open your curtain in a full bladder frenzy."

I got a groupon but it is not applicable to the Happy Hour Menu. I would suggest checking out the HH menu before purchasing a groupon. The groupon is only worth it if you are interested in ordering things off the HH menu. 

As for service, I came in at the tail of Happy hour and when I asked for the menu the gentleman rudely informed us &#34;U CANT DO HAPPY HOUR&#34;. It left a bad impression before the food even arrived. 

The sushi is just average. I guess we shouldn&#39;t expected good sushi at an hawaiian place. The scallop, and sweet shrimp sushi were sub par and not sweet. However the fried shrimp head that came with the sweet shrimp was good. The salmon and uni were okay. Uni is priced well but they only give you one piece vs. two pieces at usual sushi places. I would recommend ordering the specialty rolls such as the 69 roll which was very tasty but the sashimi/nirigri is lacking. 

For dessert the fried tempura ice cream was good but could have been crispier. Overall, I would recommend this place for happy hour, drinks, and specialty rolls but not sushi."

My favorite item on their menu is probably their half baked roll. It&#39;s a California roll topped with salmon then baked. It&#39;s seriously amazing! It takes a little while for it to come out, so you probably want to try to order it as soon as possible. They also have a great happy hour menu as well. I&#39;ve had their spam musubi and their loco moco which I also love! It&#39;s like comfort food to me, the gravy is so good. Definitely try it! 

It can get a little loud and rowdy inside so it&#39;s hard to have conversions sometimes but it&#39;s part of the environment I guess. The service is sometimes slow and we need to try to flag someone down but overall it&#39;s not too bad. The food is great so I&#39;ll definitely keep coming back!"

Love this bar cos of the Hawaiian style fruity drinks. I tried almost all the drinks here and I like all of them especially mango madness and maui mango punch. Some drinks here are too sweet for me. I would only come here for drinks. Gawd the food is horrible.

Last night was my first time getting food here. Luckily we came just in time for happy hour. We ordered some sushi rolls, Kahlua pork sliders, and spam musubi.
Minus 1 star for the food. Maybe we ordered the wrong rolls but they weren&#39;t that good compared to other sushi restaurants nearby like wasabi and momji. There was about 5 small pieces for each roll. The Kahlua pork sliders were also a disappointment. The Kahlua pork was dry and the vegetables were barely pickled and boiled instead. We were still hungry so we ordered spam musubi which was another letdown. How can anyone get this wrong? The spam had no flavor or sauce with it. I think they drizzled a little eel sauce on top. I picked up the spam musubi to take a bite and it completely fell apart. They didn&#39;t even pack the musubi properly.
I really like this bar. I do. Only for the drinks though. I wouldn&#39;t recommend getting  food here. The servers here are all pretty but they should work on less gossiping with their coworkers and pay more attention to their customers."

Ohana is a tiki bar with sort of a Japanese-Hawaiian fusion thing going on.  The drink menu screams &#34;tiki&#34; but the food menu has a lot of sushi.

The Mama Shake, blended with mango, was OK.  I&#39;ve had better tiki drinks for $10, but the atmosphere is nice.  The vibe is fun and good for groups.

Thankfully, the drinks were cold, although two beers weren&#39;t on tap, which left a choice of either Bud Light or an IPA. Chicken was very pink and undercooked - this is where I got super concerned, especially as this was my young son&#39;s meal.

I came with a group of people for my friend&#39;s birthday dinner. First off, our server was unfriendly; she was impatient when taking our orders, abrupt when serving our food, and basically told us how we should tip her. Strike one.

When the food came out, everything looked decent. But everyone at my table didn&#39;t enjoy their meal. The adobo was nowhere near authentic (not flavorful and almost peanut-buttery). The loco moco was overpowered by the taste of onions (even though we all loved onions!). The kalua pig was bland, and we felt that even UW food trucks were of better quality. The short ribs were charred and tasted ashy for a few bites. The burger was underwhelming as well; my friend claimed she &#34;could easily make this at home&#34; (it was dry, without any special flavor). I think the only redeeming quality of the food was that the meat was tender. Strike two.

And last thing, Ohana is superbly overpriced; I think they can get away with it because they&#39;re on First Avenue. Strike three.

Two stars rather than one because they were very generous toward to the birthday boy. Free cake and a lei--how nice! Also, there&#39;s lots of seating and I liked the casual environment and live DJ."

My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night, it was busy, it was fun.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The food was great!  We had a nice mix of basic rolls, fancy rolls, and Japanese appies.  

It helped the experience that we ran into friends there too :)  The only reason I&#39;m not giving it 5 stars was price.  We felt like we paid slightly too much money, but that&#39;s a small quibble.

Just a great night all around."

We visited this location in on two occasions, a Saturday night for drinks and a Monday afternoon/evening for dinner. 

Drinks:
The bar tender was very helpful and made sure we enjoyed the drink we selected. He also assisted with other options based on my choice of beverage. Overall they have great selection.

Music:
The music selection during our for visit was great and the people were vibrant. If you are looking for a fun atmosphere for the late evening, with great drink options, this is your place. However, the food may or may not be want you expect depending on what you order.  

Food:
The food was okay. The second time we went back, we just knew the food was going to be good because everything looked so fresh. However, we ordered wings for our appetizer and the ginger chicken and broccoli. The wings were too breaded and did not have enough meat on the bone. Didn&#39;t care for them after that.  The chicken and broccoli was good but nothing really stood out about it."

They are good. But for the same price, there are a handful of restaurants in Seattle to get fresher and larger-piece raw fish.

* there&#39;s regular seating (booths and tables) bar seating, or sushi bar seating.
*open until 2am! The shift from the casual dinner I had to the late night snack with a lively bar, dance floor, and DJ was interesting. Also, personal  to last night&#39;s DJ for playing PM Dawn and Diana King.

Located right on 1st Ave in Belltown, finding parking on Fri /Sat night is usually a pain for me.  However, Ohana has a relaxed island vibe to put me in a good mood, and their staff (especially Zac) are always very friendly.

I last came for a friend&#39;s birthday dinner, and the experience was nothing but delicious, straight-forward Hawaiin and Japanese American food.  I ordered the Mai Tai, Ohana (Spam) sliders, Spam Musubi, and the fried rice.  The portion sizes were generous and it was easy to share amongst friends. The food is unpretentious and not overly complicated.  Though I could make the food myself, Ohana&#39;s HH is an inexpensive outing with friends (@ $4-$7 per item).

If you can make it to Happy Hour (HH), that&#39;s where you get the biggest bang for your buck.  Their HH typically goes from 5-7 pm, but it&#39;s until 11:30 pm on Mon &amp; Tues.  What a sweet deal!"

It&#39;s a cute little Hawaiian Bar/Restaurant located in Belltown. IMO, Belltown isn&#39;t as packed as people make it out to be, so parking isn&#39;t ever really that hard for us to get in. 

I&#39;ve visited this place in two of it&#39;s different setting, just as a restaurant and then on a busy friday/saturday night when it&#39;s a busy, busy bar and semi-dance club.

Restaurant review: The food here is really yummy! I ate here on a Groupon and boy let me tell you it made a difference. I&#39;m not gonna lie, the food is pretty pricey, and it stinks how you can get a standard Spam Musubi for like $6, when you go to L&amp;L and get it for like $1.50. There&#39;s a lot of options though and it ranges all over the grid of different types of things to eat. The service was good and fast. 

Bar review: Coming here on a busy night is tons of fun! Depending who&#39;s DJing, you can hear anything from some soulful islander music, to something from Top 40 R&amp;B/Hip Hop. It&#39;s never really a line to get in, because it&#39;s more of a home bar rather than a night club, but you will see people dancing."

Hopefully this is an adolescent phase they&#39;re going through, as I was very unhappy with service &amp; atmosphere on my last two visits.  They&#39;re called &#34;Ohana&#34; for a reason - but the teen phase seems to have them more focused on being a hipster bar right now.  (Assuredly, the bar has always been a focal point, but never to the detriment of dining - til recently)

I have been a huge fan of Ohana&#39;s food since they opened.  They really hit the Seattle Asian mix of cultures on the head.  I can tell these O&#39;dea alums grew up here.  The blend of Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese and Japanese food is like coming home for me.

The Lumpia Sariwa ($6) is a thing I crave - a more sophisticated take on soul food, it is a hand made fresh roll stuffed with veggies and noodles served more like a large taco than egg roll.  The same soulful sophistication is found with the adobo - not to be a pig, but I could eat a bucket! (oink oink)  

My critique of the sushi would be that they tend to put spicy sauce or peppers on a lot of items...that aside, I enjoy their maki creations and find their fish fresh.

I love the Hawaiian food as well - it&#39;s got love.  The loco moco is solid ($11); same with kalua pork and the fat Spam musubis ($5)!

Sadly, I can&#39;t recommend them for family dining at this writing, but maybe they&#39;ll sow their oats and return to more of an Ohana atmosphere soon.  If you are a true blue Seattlite who grew up on Asian food, I recommend them for a drink and some pupus for sure."

That was interesting, but actually pretty tasty in a different type of way.

We also ordered the Loco Moco, they put that in a bowl, for just under 12.00 bucks, you don&#39;t really get too much. This was nothing to write home about, the gravy tasted like package gravy. It wasn&#39;t bad, just thought it would of been much better. 

The bill was 65.00 dollars, so for what we got, it didn&#39;t seem like a lot of food for 2 guys, I left still kind of hungry. I guess this is the going price in Seattle, considering the 15.00 minimum wage law out there.

I have a lot of fond memories here drinking tiki drinks with my girlfriends, catching up with friends over happy hour, getting drunk on cheap tequila shots in the back bar, and eating more sushi than one should. Many heartbreaks, new jobs, new engagements, birthdays and more have been celebrated (or eased) here over the past years, and more importantly, many friendships have been formed and strengthened over their strong drinks and spam musubi. 

Ohana is divey, but it&#39;s very well maintained. It looks exactly the same as it was 8 years ago. The same unrecognizable jumble of colorful things still hang from the ceiling and the booth seat covers (in Hawaiian orchid, sea turtle and other tropical pattern) still look the same as the day I rested my back on them as a junior in college. Even the menu is still the same and as far as I can tell, the price hasn&#39;t changed much over the years. I love their spam musubi, beef robata, and sushi rolls (they&#39;re good, but the half-baked rolls are a must-get! And their 69 and firecracker rolls are good too). The Hawaiian dishes themselves are a-OK. 

Drinks are stiff here and service is usually good. Tips: they have a Groupon, all-day happy hour on Monday and Tuesday (and pretty much HH every day but Saturday), and a DJ spinning hip hop and pop music late night Friday and Saturday. When there&#39;s not live music playing, the place is perfect for carrying on a conversation, not too rowdy and not too quiet."

The sake margarita was a great deal for at $16. It was on the watery side with taste but there was definitely a good amount to sake in there. 

HH-Pork skewers were tasty but really small for $5

Special Dynamite roll was delicious with coconut fried outside. $15 about 6 pieces. 

HH- chicken Katsu was the best HH deal for the money and delicious. 

Spicy WINGS $7.50 very tasty for 6 wings. 

HH- poke with taro chips. Delicious but very little  fish given. $8.00

All in all a good experience but I wasn&#39;t impressed by the HH menu. If I ever go back I&#39;ll be getting an entree."

That being said, their happy hour is a great deal. Two people can easily order several rolls of sushi and a few other appetizers for around $30. Add another $10 if you both order a drink. 

The service is acceptable. The restaurant has a laid back Hawaiian vibe, and I think the staff takes that to heart sometimes. They can be a little slow and unprofessional. 

The sushi is made fresh in house, but I don&#39;t think they use the best ingredients because the sushi lacks some flavor. Ohana serves most of your traditional sushi rolls with a few twists of their own. 

I only recommend them for happy hour, or if you have a groupon."

The drinks: looks amazing and they have a large variety of mixed, speciality drinks and beers. No bud light -_- . Womp womp. We had a blue moon, lemon margaritas, lava flow and some drink that had a corona beer poking in. They were okay. I like sweet but some of these guys are a little too sweet for me. Presentation and style though, pretty damn good. 

As for food we ordered calamari, four types of sushi rolls, shrimp and spam Mitsubi. Delicious. I think if I&#39;m in town again, this is a &#34;must go &#34; to spot for me. Go to Ohana&#39;s and get that island feeling! Bookmarked for a return. 

Tip: reservations on a crowded night is always a plus. Friday and sat. Oh! And kudos to the dj on top of the tree house!"

Service is not great on Sunday lunch at 12. The waiter appears irritated and does not want to answer questions about the menu today:( We ordered 2 Bentos and a few rolls for the table. Food took a while to arrive. Bento was unimpressive. The rolls were a shame. Loosely rolled and the ends were just sushi rice. The sushi were the worst I have eaten. They were so plain, hard and dry. The rolls reminded me of those prepackaged sushi that I used to buy at the grocery store. Very disappointing, and they are not cheap either. What an experience."

Really a bad place for vegans/vegetarians. 
But that&#39;s our fault since we didn&#39;t do our due diligence in checking out the menu ahead of time. 
The food we COULD eat was the Vegetable tofu Yakisoba which was a bit greasy and under seasoned, plus hardly any veggies :(. The other dish was the teriyaki veggie skewers very small and sad, but the Teriyaki sauce was good without being overly sweet. We had a 2 veggie sushi rolls $7.00 bucks each! Yikes! That were very small and very unremarkable. I decided to try a Mai Tai which I would say TRY IT if you like VERY Strong sweet drinks. I couldn&#39;t get past two sips, so I asked the waitress to exchange it for a Lava Flow instead. Talk about going from one extreme to the other! They were both $9.75 and one was an alcoholics&#39; wet dream and the other was a fancy 7-11 Slurpee. Not sure if it even had booze in the second one. 
Oh well, carnivores might like this place better, but us VEGHEADS need to keep searching.

On a positive note: our server Jenae was super nice and totally patient about me sending back my first drink. Overall, I&#39;d have to say, the People totally great, the food totally subpar and small."

The staff was very friendly and helpful. We tried the lava flow drink and it was ok but needed a bit more liquor in it which coming from a person who rarely drinks is saying a lot and the khans Mai Tai which had wayyyy too much booze in that one.

We were promptly seated in a nice comfortable booth that was situated in the middle of the restaurant. I liked the location, but found that cold air blowing from the environmental system that made it noticeably cold where I kept wanting to put my jacket back on.  The service was exceptional and engaging where the staff really was good at engaging their customers, describing the menu and making suggestions.  

The first course was a beer and the pork tacos that were really good and had a good bark to them and I found the pork to have a good crunchy taste.  There was a green sauce that looked initially like guaqamole but was a verde sauce that was really good.  As the main entree we shared the half chicken dinner and the kimchi mac n&#39; cheese.  In hindsight, we ordered way too much food and had leftovers, so the portions here are above average and served family style; so would be good to bring couples here as the meals are made more for 4 than 2; in my opinion.

We ended without a dessert as too full and a glass of some of their choice whiskeys that was serviced neat with a glass of ice to add, if needed.  The server was great at describing all the choices and had first hand experience in all of them.

My take away from the chicken meal was that the pieces were huge and I like how they cut the breast into 2 large portions.  The batter on the chicken was very crispy and almost in my opinion burnt although not burnt tasting.  The chicken spices were over salted and the salt taste really overwhelmed me where it took away from the flavor of the meat.  Too bad you really need to take off the crispy crust because of the over salted and appearance of a shiny oily sheen. 

This said, there&#39;s a huge selection of choices on the menu and you can come here a dozen times and have something different.   Come here hungry or in a group as the I said the portions are really big."

BUT this time I did have rezzys so we were GOOD. 

Our server was fantastic and the pork buns, oh yes the pork buns. I could do just a double order of those tasty treats. I also had the sautéed Bok Choi which was good but way too salty...Yes I do know soy sauce is salty...but this was like salted soy sauce with salt on the side. but the veggies were crisp...  My friend had a great salad with pears and endive... she also got the Ahi Poke which was yummy. So I say yes.. it&#39;s good.. get a rezzy."

In order of my favorite items -- 

* Corn - 5 stars: Super buttery, sweet, crunchy, and flavorful, some of the best corn on the cob I&#39;ve had! Would only have been better if the corn was fresher. 
* Broccoli with sesame butter - 5 stars: I hate black sesame but I LOVED this charred broccoli. Super flavorful and delicious
* Fried Chicken - 4.5 stars: Highly contested here, I think the chicken is great. So much better than the stuff at Witness because the skin is salty and extremely crunchy. Could only be better if it was a little more moist and brined with herbs. I even enjoyed the furikake rice
* Sweet Rolls - 4 stars: HUGE, fresh, soft, warm rolls. Will definitely fill you up.
* Curry Fried Rice - 3.5 stars: Can you ever really go wrong with curry fried rice? Good, but nothing special.
* Mac n Cheese with Kimchee - 3.5 stars: Again, this is always a winning combo. Wish it was cheesier...
* Banana Cream Pie - 3.5 stars: I always love banana cream pie, thought the filling was a little too firm, not banana-y enough, and crust was mediocre. Still ate the whole thing though..."

Came to Seattle over Labor Day weekend for Bumbershoot with some friends, and as we were staying in West Seattle this spot was recommended to us for brunch. Three of us got their bottomless mimosas (yum), which were reasonably priced (I want to say $10-12, but don&#39;t remember the exact number now). We also had reserved a fried chicken. Since it was their specialty, I was definitely expecting it to be good, but it was DIVINE... and I&#39;m not even a big fried chicken eater. Waitress was awesome, didn&#39;t laugh at us too much when we insisted on pouring hot sauce into our mimosas to &#34;spice things up&#34;.

We&#39;ve been dying to try some so we knew we had to go :] Definitely make a reservation, fortunately we did before coming and it was busy when we got here.

From the Restaurant Week menu, we ordered:

Appetizers:
Calamari- It was really good, I loved the light batter and the sauce that it came with.
Papaya Salad- Came in a small bowl, portion size could&#39;ve been better but it was light and had a nice dressing to it.

Main Entree:
Okonomiyaki- We both got this and if you don&#39;t know what this is, it&#39;s like a japanese pancake mixed with assorted stuff. This one was vegetarian, it had maitake mushrooms, green garlic, smoked sweet potato with that sauce and kewpie drizzled on top. It also came with a side of perfectly cooked rice with bits of nori. This was soooooo GOOOOODD!!!!! I wish they had this on their regular menu, but this was only just for restaurant week.

Desserts:
Pineapple cheesecake-My sister didn&#39;t like the crust, but she did enjoy the main cheesecake part and the pineapples on top.
Kona Coffee Ice Cream-I thought was delicious if you like coffee flavored ice cream :D

Overall, we were really satisfied with this place and their service. Our first time having okonomiyaki and it did not disappoint! I would definitely love to come back here again to try the other items on their everyday menu."

We had so much food leftover and some of it would of been great to take home but dang, ITS SO SALTY. I will say that I usually have a light had in the salt department but even all my friends were saying everything was salty, especially the saimin. WOW, I couldn&#39;t even finish it. We got the sweet rollz which were yummy and came out warm and went perfectly with the jam and Nutella. Also tried the coconut congee which was good, but I wasn&#39;t raving about it and maybe i&#39;m a congee snob who likes it from Mike&#39;s Noodle House but still...

We ordered the pineapple and apple ciders. They were so delicious.    For food, we ordered the miso corn (very good), half order chicken with a substituted order of the curry bacon fried rice, and mac and kimchee.

I really enjoyed the corn and mac n cheese.  I thought the chicken was dry.  It was good, but dry.  I didn&#39;t care for the curry bacon fried rice.  I love curry, but maybe this dish just wasn&#39;t for me.

We also ordered the kimchee mac and cheese, loco moco and bacon fried rice -- my husband loved the kimchee mac and cheese -- just the perfect amount of cheesiness and spiciness. 

Service was great -- everyone was friendly. The restaurant and rest room was A+ clean.

Came in on a Saturday and sampled the fried chicken with curry fried rice (yum, definitely pay for the $6 upgrade), Poke, and Hawaiian rolls with their drippings butter. 

All was really, really good. This place is expensive but the food was really enjoyable and everything tasted great. I will say the poke fish was sliced in pretty large chunks. I would have wanted them sliced a little bit smaller. Probably 1.5 cubic inch pieces...like...whoa. Definitely well seasoned still so that made up for it. I think we went with a citrus variety and I&#39;d recommend it. 

The fried rice came covered in house smoked bacon. MMMMMmm, bacon. Delicious. 

The bread...was to die for. Chicken was good but it wasn&#39;t my highlight. It&#39;s good, but I&#39;m not big on fried chicken. My friend loved it and even had the leftovers for a snack later. That evening. I know, he&#39;s crazy.

This part is not a big deal, but he opted to stay in for Superbowl 50 instead of going out to watch it with his friends. Why?

Dinner? Not superlative. Fried chicken is good, but all the effort is on the coating. A good marinade would be amazing. Curry fried rice was better, but the best thing we had was a pineapple cider. Yum.
There&#39;s a hipster vibe. If you&#39;re into that, you&#39;ll like it, I suppose.
And it&#39;s really very fashionable for a Hawaiian place, or, I suppose, a Hawaiian-inspired place.
I gave an extra star for excellent service. Just putting that out there."

I also reserved a half chicken, to see what all the hype was about. We were seated right away and I was surprised at how large of a space this was. From the outside it looks tiny, and a few of the reviews mentioned it was small. It can fit quite a lot of tables, plus the bar. But that also results in quite a loud atmosphere, but I was always able to hear the conversation at my table, so it never bothered us. 

We ordered 5 items, received 4 of the 5, but we ended up being happy the 5th item was missed since we were all very full. The chicken was pretty great, I wish I had known you could make it spicy! Very crispy on the outside and still juicy on the inside. Not something I would crave enough to order again over trying new items, but still good. The biscuits that come with it are huge, and very dry in order to accommodate the gravy topping. I&#39;m not normally the biggest fan of biscuits and gravy, but I loved their choice of gravy! We also ordered the coconut french toast (very tasty, though I could&#39;ve done without the pineapple since it was not ripe and rock hard), mac-n-kimcheese (great blend of spice and cheesiness. I was super excited to eat this the next day, but it was pretty mediocre as leftovers.. which isn&#39;t really their fault), and the baby bok choy stir fry, which ended up being one of my favorite items. It had a great garlic sauce prepared with it! We had ordered the polynesian sweet rolls with jam, but that item was never entered, so I&#39;ll have to try it the next time I&#39;m there. The food came pretty speedy, which we were thankful for since we were starving! Even with how busy it was, and the fact that our waiter was being shadowed by a trainee, we still had very attentive service and we never felt like we were waiting for very long for our order, food or check.
There&#39;s so many tempting items on the menu, it&#39;s difficult to choose, so I&#39;ll definitely be back again for brunch with the fam."

Roasted carrots: perfectly crisp and yet tender, sesame seeds, lemon? Perfect.

Roasted broccoli: spicy, complex, yum!!!

Curry Fried Rice: spice-heavy, sinus-clearing, enlightening! 

Sweet Rolls: comes with a butter that I would love to be embalmed in. 

Chicken: You must order ahead to reserve your chickens! Best fried chicken I&#39;ve ever eaten.

Their biscuits were nicely crunchy. Drizzle that syrup that they provide and it&#39;ll be the perfect combo with the fried chicken!  I was nomming away.

I don&#39;t recommend their Ramen because their broth lacked that homely flavor that I seek in ramen broth and the spam with Kailua pork wasn&#39;t all that great or complimentary with the ramen as a whole.  Skip!  You&#39;ve been warned.  I asked for hot sauce too and they gave me the typical Sriracha. A deal breaker for me.  Real ramen is served with the peppery spicy seeds, but this wasn&#39;t.  

Their rolls were nice and fluffily warm.  Service was attentive and got it done.

2 times deep fried chicken for the win!  Then, those biscuits with it!"

That said this place does a nice job punching up the flavors and the presentation. The smoke on the dog was amazing and pot stickers drenched in egg yolk were luxurious. Better Hawaiian street food than I had in Hawaii. But you can skip the spam musubi -- it still just tastes like processed pork.

A whole chicken for 4 people was a bit too much, but a half chicken may not have been enough. I was pretty happy to put chicken on a biscuit and put gravy on it. It was simply scrumptious. Not sure if it&#39;s worth the cost, but between 4 people it worked out fine. Then I also ordered the coconut french toast, which was also pretty yummy. The fiance had Curry-Bacon Fried Rice &amp; Eggs and basically licked the bowl. I&#39;m a huge jerk and failed to consider that our friends don&#39;t eat pork, but in spite of my absentmindedness they seemed happy with whatever they ordered. Oopsy!

I ordered bottomless mimosas for $12 and I definitely got my money&#39;s worth. Even better, the glass was truly never empty.

On Thursday night, my boyfriend and I went to try it out. We were super stoked to try their fried chicken (because you know, it&#39;s in their name and all). We got the Ahi, a half order of the fried chicken, side of pea vines, and side bacon fried rice.

The chicken came with a small side of kimchee which, along with the pea vines and ahi, were good. The bacon fried rice was forgettable, and the fried chicken was TERRIBLE. On the menu it says that it is &#34;twice fried,&#34; which to me should have been a red flag from the beginning. Sure enough, the exterior of the chicken was so dark, very dry and crunchy, and just inedible. There is no reason to umami spice it if you can&#39;t even eat the exterior. I had one of the smaller pieces to eat first and ended up throwing 50% of it into our bowl for bones and didn&#39;t eat another piece.

Overall, not worth $20 for 5 pieces of some super burnt and dry chicken. I&#39;d rather go to Safeway to get fried chicken."

It is a long and narrow space, and we were close to the kitchen to see all of the action. We reserved a half-order of chicken already with our reservation, but wanted to try some other dishes and probably over-ordered for just the two of us. We got:

Sweet rolls: these were hot and really tasty. You get some whipped pan drippings with it, and you spread it on like butter.

Fried chicken: we got 5 pieces of Asian-style cut up chicken, which was crispy and non-greasy. Very good.

Pea vines: just ok, a little too lemony for my taste

Idaho trout: this was good, although be prepared for lots of little bones in the fish

Next time I stop by, I would want to bring more people so that I can sample more dishes. Overall, this a nice restaurant in the Junction area of West Seattle if you want your Hawaiian-style food fix."

As someone who used to spend their summers in Maui as a kid I am very familiar with Hawaiian style fried chicken.

Upon pulling up to the street where Ma&#39;ono is located we see people packed inside and a few outside the door which is already a good sign. Glad I made reservations because those that didn&#39;t were in for a long wait or just left because the amount of people who made reservations still waiting to be seated...yes it was that packed!!

So lets get to the food. For starters my wife order a whiskey cocktail and Spam Musubi (*which by the way was $6 --- for that price they better give me super physical strength for a couple hours cuz in Hawaii you can get a Spam Musubi at 7-11 for a buck and change). Sure enough it was just a regular Spam Musubi for just one! I&#39;m thinking in my head, I could have bought one can of Spam, fried that up and cook some rice use my musubi maker and sprinkle the same seasoning on it making 6+ Musubis all for under $5. So for those who have had Spam Musubi&#39;s I rate a big negative &#34;NO&#34; on this purchase --- highway robbery!! ....and to those who haven&#39;t and don&#39;t mind wasting $6 sure why not.

For the entree we ordered the Warm Portuguese Sweet Rolls, Curry and Bacon Fried Rice, Ma&#39;Ono Saimin, Newaukum Valley Farm Butter Lettuce, and half order of the Fried Chicken (*you must reserved your order of chicken as you confirm your reservation to be seated over the phone)

Breakdown:
Warm Portuguese Sweet Rolls - typical hawaiian style bread with delicious butter
Curry and Bacon Fried Rice - very salty with the combination amount of bacon and curry
Ma&#39;Ono Saimin - An even flavor of the soups saltiness with all the components to absorb it in
Newaukum Valley Farm Butter Lettuce - very fresh taste of the radishes and sauce with the butter lettuce
Half order of the Fried Chicken - Now this is why I gave a four star instead of a two, for $21 you can get a half order to split for two if you are just curious why it is so damn expensive. The way it is cooked double fried while the meat inside is still juicy and the outside is super crunchy, then dab some of the sauces given...thats some good fried chicken bruddah!!

Throughout the entire night my wife and I kept saying --- &#34;&#39;but that chicken tho!&#34; even when we finished eating our Banana Cream Pie with a birthday candle on top for dessert.

We ended up taking one piece of chicken, a roll, a little bit of the Butter lettuce and a good chunk of that salty fried rice home.

So if you are looking for something new to go to for dinner, then this would be a decent spot to hit up!

Happy Eats Everyone!!"

My crew and I sat at the bar because the wait for tables was going to be around 30 minutes. The restaurant space is on the small side, with the bar taking up most of the indoor space. 

I had the Manapua which is a hawaiin pork that is enveloped in a soft dough. It was more of an appetizer, so I decided to eat some of my crew&#39;s food. One person in my party had the Tostada and another had the Chicken Nugget French Toast. Every dish was handled with such precision and care. I tried the other two dishes and they were bursting with flavor! The Chicken Nugget French Toast sounds odd, but it is so delicious. The chicken was different than any other chicken that I have ever eaten. It had a more crumbly tofu texture, but I know it wasn&#39;t tofu. The exterior of the chicken was light &amp; crispy, but you could taste the light presence of the oil. 

The service is pretty fast, especially since it seems like Ma&#39;ono is always busy. They must have it down to an art. I wish I had gotten the chance to try the fried chicken. Next time Ma&#39;ono."

It could easily be the best but I hate when people use that term loosely. The fact that you have to call 24 hours in advance should tell you it&#39;s good but not how amazing it is. It&#39;s some next level fried chicken.

They have you call 24 hours in advance because they cook it, deep fry it and let it sit until you arrive when they deep fry it again. It gets extra crunchy and delicious with their cooking process. The chicken itself is pretty delicious as well once you crunch through to it. Try the chili sauce, I loved it! 

The kimchi is fantastic and a bit on the spicy side which I really like. It&#39;s not out of this world but it&#39;s very tasty.

The rice also comes with a bit of seaweed which gives it an unusual taste that is easygoing and adds a new flavor."

Not sure what the consequences of not reserving a chicken were, but in any case - since I made the reservation, I had no problem getting chicken!

I noticed someone had the issue of having under cooked chicken when ordering from here. I was a bit nervous for this, but to my relief, I did not have that problem with the chicken that we received. In fact, the only problem I did have with it is how much food we got!! They had the option to reserve either half a chicken or a whole chicken - I ordered half a chicken since it was just two of us at brunch, and ordered a couple of other dishes for us to balance out the meal. What I didn&#39;t realize though when ordering the fried chicken (because I&#39;m terrible at reading the fine print) is it comes with more than just chicken. Apparently the fried chicken came with biscuits, gravy, and syrup as well! Oops. Suffice to say, we had a bunch of leftovers after this meal.

The friend chicken was glorious in cooking - I still can&#39;t get over how crispy it was! Every bite I took was outstanding! I think I&#39;m going to have to call and reserve a whole chicken next time I have a family dinner or something. The flavors were good - a bit bland towards the center of some of the bigger pieces, but still very good with the umami flavor. The sausage gravy and biscuit were also pretty good - I wasn&#39;t sure how to incorporate the syrup into this portion of my meal though, so I ended up not using it.

The other items we ordered were the Apple Malasadas and the Portuguese Sweet Rolls. The sweet rolls were okay - I was not a very big fan of them because there was so much other good food on the table, but they weren&#39;t terrible. They&#39;re big, soft, and fluffy, so this is likely very enjoyable for anyone who enjoys their bread this way. The Apple Malasadas were probably the best things I ate while here - I didn&#39;t expect to like them that much, but I scarfed them down before the chicken even showed up because they were so good. They list them as &#34;apple donuts&#34; - it&#39;s really just an apple, with (maybe) dough on the outside so they can fry them though. With the actual apple in the middle, I definitely believed I was eating something healthy for a little while. I&#39;m pretty sure with all that cinnamon sugar on top, and the fact that they were fried, they are not that healthy - but with that sweet, tangy, crunchy goodness, I like to believe that they actually kind of are.

Overall, loved Ma&#39;Ono - I&#39;m definitely a fan, and I&#39;ll definitely be back for that perfectly fried chicken one day, as well as those Malasadas!!"

So, if you show up on the weekend without a reservation, you&#39;re going to wait a bit. That being said, we showed up on a Thursday at 7:30p with a reservation and still waited 45min for our table. This is the only real negative mark I have. The food and drinks were fantastic. The full bar boasts some great specialty cocktails that have a Japanese/Hawaiian twist on some classics. 

I enjoyed the Knox Manhattan: Old Overholt Rye Whiskey, Carpano Antica Formula, Fernet Branca, Orange Bitters. Quite lovely. 

For apps I was able to sample the fried rice which had a curry and bacon component to it. Not greasy as I&#39;ve seen in some. Packed full of flavor and a perfect crunch. The manapua were a touch sweeter than I&#39;ve had before but in a good way. It balanced with the tang of the sauce they&#39;re served with. A friend at the table was even able to part with a piece of the fried chicken. Perfectly crispy, not greasy and spiced to perfection. The meat was moist and tender. Highly recommended. Oh, and the Brussel sprouts, char, balsamic, perfection.

For my main I had the Fatty Saimin ramen. Rich smoked pork &amp; pork fat broth, kalua pig, bacon, cured egg, scallion, furikake. The broth was nothing short of sublime. Fatty indeed but without too much floating humiliation on the top. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that there wasn&#39;t too much of it. I mean, you savored it but the other components weren&#39;t drowning in it. Each of the components were cooked perfectly and the noodles had just the slightest bite to them. Awesome!

The delightful meal finished on a good note with banana cream pie. A thick and hearty crust dusted with sesame seeds and a filling dotted with fresh chunks of banana and a hearty/thick cream. Finished with freshly whipped cream. It wasn&#39;t overly sweet which I appreciate.

Overall: they certainly know how to control the oil. Temp is a hard thing to nail over different applications like fries, chicken, etc. The ambience is a touch on the loud side but not intolerable. The ingredients are solid and there is certainly a level of skill in the kitchen comparable to higher priced venues."

Summary: burger is not bad but nothing memorable or worth returning for. 

First the good - at 1:30 on a holiday weekend Sunday we were seated quickly, promptly greeted and drinks came quickly. 

I&#39;ve never been a fan of the space - it feels like an upscale cafeteria and the acoustics are awful - it&#39;s always loud and hard to hear your companion. That hasn&#39;t changed. The bar seating is nice and if I were to return I&#39;d sit there instead. 

Our burgers came fairly quickly and the bun was crisped nicely and the pickle garnish has an addictive spicey kick.  The burger itself was forgettable. No flavor to the meat and generally had a greasy feel. The sauce (a white garlic aoli?) was tasty but not enough impact. They use a yummy white cheese but wished I had more. The shredded lettuce quickly became a soggy mess. The day we were there the burger was served on a tasteless low profile ciabatta bread. It may have been better if it came with the advertised sesame seed English muffin. 

The fries? Nicely browned but lacking potatoe flavor. 

Overall? You won&#39;t regret coming here but not likely to make your list of favorite burger place. We will have to return to try their famous fried chicken another time."

We ordered the saimin ramen and that was the best dish of the night. Very, very good. We also has called ahead and ordered the half fried chicken with kimchi. The Kim chi was decent. The chicken was juicy, but relatively bland. You have to dip it into the sauces they provide otherwise you don&#39;t taste much. We also got the green wand and those were pretty yummy, although a bit salty.

The waitresses were attentive, but not particularly friendly. I didn&#39;t see a smile on any of the waitresses at the restaurant, which is fine, but a bit of a bummer. Overall, Maono is good and all but I think a bit over priced. That being said, id come back for the ramen :)"

Call in advance and let them know how much you&#39;re gonna need; make a reservation while you&#39;re at it since they can get so busy.  

The fried chicken is the reason you come here.  It&#39;s crispy, it&#39;s crunchy, and it&#39;s salty (in a good way). I really enjoyed it and with a full order plus a few sides, the four of us were pretty full.  Sadly, I didn&#39;t care too much for the sides.  We ordered the mac &amp; kimcheese, green beans, Brussel sprouts, and rolls.  While the Brussel sprouts were prepared well and tasted great, the green beans were nothing special, and I could have done without the mac &amp; kimcheese, which made me really sad.  The rolls were fine but they were just rolls. 

Next time I come, I&#39;ll be completely happy with an extra order of chicken and a side of Brussel sprouts...and beer to drink."

And too, in a gauzy sort of way, Junction evokes fond memories of our previous Portland life. 

We came here for dinner on a weeknight recently.  We were optimistic because Ma&#39;ono was open (often times it is closed during its stated open hours).  Ma&#39;ono has a pleasant throughly modern Dwell-ish design.  Except, we have to say that the lighting is much too dim, lending to a somewhat gloomy ambience.

You might be tempted to call it Hawaiian or Pan-Asian, but really, Ma&#39;ono&#39;s menu covers a lot more ground than that.   Lots of tempting items to pick from.  Probably my favorite item of the night was the Portuguese sweet rolls.   Served hot from the oven, they remind of King&#39;s Hawaiian bread, but are better.  The butter with the bread comes with sea salt, balancing nicely the bread&#39;s sweetness.  Yum!  I should of ordered a second round to take home for a late night snack.

I know there is a caution that if you want to order their much-vaunted fried chicken, you should call and place your order in advance.  However, on this particular evening, JP was able to order the chicken right there on the spot without any issue.   So, believe the hype about Ma&#39;ono chicken.  Yep, I&#39;m gonna say it, this is the best fried chicken I have had yet in Seattle.  It&#39;s seasoned perfectly and cooked to just the right doneness.  

But beware, the half order (that comes with kimchee and rice) is enormous.  It comes with 4 hefty pieces of chicken and would be ideal for splitting between two people.  At the least, you will have leftovers for another splendid meal.  The rice, topped with fine strands of crispy seaweed, along with the kimchee were nicely prepared.

I went with the attractive-to-the-eye Loco Moco.  On some of Ma&#39;ono&#39;s dishes, they note if they contain cilantro.  So I dived into my Loco Moco with a little too much gusto, not anticipating cilantro.  Oh, what a shock to have that wreched flavor explode in my mouth!  But instead of fussing to our server, I meticulously picked the weed out of my dish, and proceeded to enjoy and otherwise a very good Loco Moco, which contained hamburger patties, Portuguese sausage, a fried egg and rice in a broth.  Well, maybe the Portguese sausage was a little pungent.

Service was good.  We liked the warm steamed towels they brought us at the end of the meal.  A nice touch.  Would we come back?  We sure would, and we would definitely order the fried chicken and Portuguese sweet rolls again."

Ma&#39;Ono means &#39;very delicious&#39; in Hawaiian, and this island inspired eatery lives up to its reputation. We had their signature fried chicken (commonly mentioned as one of the very best in the entire country), and it was pretty delicious. The fixings where, IMO, where this place stands out. The sausage gravy was divine and the biscuits were amazing (maybe it&#39;s a secret islandy something in the mix). (However, I note, we had it Sunday during lunch/brunch, you may get rice/kimchee on other days/times).  The stirred fried pea greens was super tasty and great. 

We will definitely be back to explore more of the exotic menu, from the oxtail soup, to the whole wood grilled trout, to the popcorn ice cream. Plus this place is famous for their whiskey selection (though, our bunch all you can drink mimosa was too tempting to pass up). This place is definitely: Ono."

I had previously heard great things about this place and was excited to try the fried chicken. We ordered the fried chicken, a side of the broccoli, and the grapefruit hefeweizen as our drinks.  

The fried chicken came with a side of rice, kimchee, and gochujang dipping sauce. The food is good. The chicken breading tastes like it may be battered in mochiko flour which gives it a nice crispness and it was seasoned well except for the fact that it was a lot salty. In fact the broccoli in the cheese and kimchee sauce was also super salty. I think the highlight of the meal was the rice (which was cooked to perfection) and their kimchee (which was really good and I&#39;m Korean and eat kimchee almost everyday). Don&#39;t get me wrong, it tastes good but the balance was off and just a little to heavy on saltiness which is why I will probably not be going back here when I&#39;m craving fried chicken."

Everyone was already seated when we arrived, and the service throughout the evening was fine - they were busy but still checked on us regularly.

I tried some of the meats off the Hawaiian BBQ plate and they were very tasty. This is just a big plate of meats with condiments. The side of kimchee was great, very garlicky and not overly spicy. Their fried chicken was also pretty good, very crispy and crumbly, fried to perfection. However, my absolute favorite was the curry and bacon fried rice. The curry flavor was very subtle, and the bacon was more like delicious fried bits of pork belly. I&#39;m bummed I did not have room for some popcorn ice cream as it sounded very intriguing!

We should have for the amount of time we waited). 

I ordered the saimin, biscuits and gravy, and my hubby ordered the ma&#39;ono burger. The portions are huge and you&#39;ll leave full. The broth for the saimin was delicious, the biscuits were warm and crispy and the gravy lots of sausage in it. My husband enjoyed his burger. 

Understandably, we were there at 12pm on a weekend (thank goodness I made reservations). I guess my issue was that we barely saw our waiter, she never really passed by to tell us that our food was on the way (or giving us an ETA on when we&#39;d get our food - nothing). Another table, who sat down maybe 20 min after us, got their food before us. We got our food at almost 12:50pm. They were really lucky my husband got to my bill before i did, because he was too nice and overtipped. 

Overall, yes i would try this again (I really want to try the chicken and the other brunch items), but I probably won&#39;t go on a weekend, and/or I&#39;ll call in an order, or call in a reservation and call in order of the chicken."

I came here wanting some Hawaiian food, but I ended up ordering the twice fried chicken because it was highly recommended.  As far as what I though of it?  Meh.  Because the chicken is twice fried, it made the outer coating very hard, it might just be a preference thing, but IMO it wasn&#39;t that great and it kind a hurt my gums just chewing on it.  As far as flavor it  was average, I did not get the whole &#34;umami&#34; flavor or spice as they described it.

Growing up in Hawaii, we had our share of fried chicken.  But it usually came with rice and mac salad.  When I got biscuits and gravy with the fried chicken I was confused on the type of restaurant I was in.  The only time I remember eating fried chicken with biscuits and gravy was when I ate a KFC.

3. Mac and Kim cheese. Kind of looked like krafts with some shin ramen powder in it but it was actually really good. Nice side order to the fried chicken for sure.
Our friends ordered the loco moco which I didn&#39;t enjoy as much. The burger patty was flavorful but I think the rice to meat ratio was a little too rice heavy.

Our first encounter was wonderful. Your Spam Musubi was a delectable size and had a good balance of seaweed, spam, and rice. I couldn&#39;t wait to taste more of you.

You showed me your chicken, and that&#39;s where things started going downhill. Those five fried pieces were no doubt crispy, but were severely lacking in flavor. They needed more salt. They were also over battered, especially in those nooks and crannies. Under that crispy exterior was some soggy, steamed, grey batter speckled with pepper. I wish I could say you were finger lickin&#39; good, but you weren&#39;t. I found myself wiping off the excess oil. But, I am grateful you provided wet napkins for me to use at the end of the meal.

Figuring I might need to coax out your wild side, I also tried the Loco Moco. The pineapple added a fantastic touch of sweetness, but the gravy sorely lacked salinity. And oh, don&#39;t even get me started about your Portuguese sweet buns. They were warm, soft, and puffy, but weren&#39;t sweet enough. Plus, they seemed store bought.

Well, I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be continuing this relationship any longer. For now, Ezells is my girl. Call me when you get better."

My family had visited Ma&#39;ono twice so far. First time it was for their famous fried chicken, which was really good. Crispy on the skin and tender in the meat. However, we felt that $20 half, $40 whole chicken is a little over priced, so we wanted to try something else this time. 

We should have stick with fried chicken.

This time my wife ordered benedict, I ordered fatty saimin, and got maono two egg for our kid. 

Benedict: $14. It&#39;s quite decent, with eggs really nicely cooked, and have this tasty golden fried potato browns. The portion is pretty good. My wife only finished half of it. However, it&#39;s not as great as we expected for a $14 benedict. 

Maono two eggs. $12. Same issue with the benedict. Good but not great for a egg dish whose price is in the higher end.

Fatty saimin. $14 The highlight of our visit. The pork broth is really creamy and thick, though more at heavy side. You got to be careful with the broth, because it&#39;s very hot under the layer of fat. Egg is perfectly boiled, and the big slice of thick bacon added nice smokey flavor to the ramen. Bacon in the ramen is not traditional cooking in Japanese cuisine, but it is definitely an excellent twist in this case. The portion is good too. As a male adult I almost couldn&#39;t finish it.

Stumptown coffee. $3.5. Another highlight. I don&#39;t drink coffee much, but this Stumptown coffee they provided sure has a smooth and wonderful flavor. It&#39;s so nice that they use quality coffee.

Orange juice. $4. It&#39;s fresh juice. The price is a little high, because only at the bill time we realized it&#39;s unlimited refill, like coffee. However it&#39;s for our kid and how much orange juice could a 6-yo drink? I wish they have a junior drink for less price.

Service. It was at busy Sunday lunch time, and the Seahawks game just ended so the place was almost packed. At first the service was a little slow but soon it improved, with our waitress checked us for our needs and refill coffee quite often. 

Now back to the topic of fried chicken. I noticed that our main entries price adds up to $40, which is the same price of a whole fried chicken. If we ordered the whole fried chicken, which comes with biscuit, gravy and syrup, I&#39;m very sure the dinning experience would be better...at least better than the egg dishes.

So, next time we will go for fried chicken for sure."

We ordered half chicken, which came with sausage gravy, two biscuits and maple syrup because it was the brunch platter. We also tried the warm Portuguese rolls which came piping hot and you could see the steam. It was delicious, we were pretty skeptical at first and almost didn&#39;t order them. But the rolls were warm, soft and almost melt in the mouth, reminds me of Asian breads back home in Singapore (pandan bread). 
The twice fried chicken - we had a drumstick, a wing, one thigh, two breasts. Five pieces in total for two to share. It was crispy and had a slight Asian tang to it which we loved. The sausage gravy was delicious with the chicken and the rolls we ordered. Also the gravy had a slight Asian tang to it that we could taste so everything tasted well together. I was too full to have the biscuit, packing it home and warming it up to have with butter later. Overall, pretty big meal for two and not to mention, great drink selection too! Can&#39;t wait to try their other dishes especially the noodles next time!
AT the end of the meal, they provide warm towels for your sticky fingers! Finger licking good meal!"

Seated with 7 people and surely came with a bunch of hungry eaters. I love the fact that the food comes as family style so it is easy to share.

The many dishes that we ordered included.

kim chi mac and cheese

spam musubi

stir fried green beans

hum baos

maono hawaiian bbq appetizer 

and of course... fried chicken!

I would have to say that some of the dishes that were available weren&#39;t very special, the bbq appetizer was actually the most disappointing. It was definitely a little overpriced for the portion we were given. 

I would have to say that the two things i did enjoy was the kim chi mac and cheese and the fried chicken. 
The mac and cheese had a velvety texture that was melt in your mouth and a little kick to it. 
Fried chicken was up to par in terms of crispyness. It came with some sides including pickled veggies some rice and red hot sauce on a large platter. A whole chicken can probably feed 4 people if you get an additional couple of sides with it. 

If you decide to come here... don&#39;t come with hungry hungry people, they will be disappointed with the portion of food. 
each side seems to be portioned for 4 people so if you go with a large group make sure to get enough for each end of the table. 

It is a little far of a reach to get to Ma&#39;ono for me since it is in west seattle. Definitely will be going back to get me some fried chicken and kim chi!"

The &#34;fried chicken&#34; is obnoxiously priced- and touting that you need to reserve in advance. Not worth that kind effort. Crispy chicken. PNW biscuits.. (Chapel Hill has ruined biscuits for me- these are overly complicated flour,butter concoctions). 

Ramen here is again average- nothing bad but nothing great. Just a bowl of ramen. 

Wife got hamburger once - sent incorrect temp. Twice. But it again- tasted like a burger- Ma&#39;ono is a nice restaurant with average food. It won&#39;t disappoint but you&#39;ll probably forget what you ate by the time you trek it back to your car."

We are not huge fans of the friend chicken dish as it seems to be relatively undifferentiated compared to the other offerings.

4.5 stars for the food.  Love the dishes mentioned above but many of the side dishes are mediocre

4 stars for the service.  We have had a few lovely servers and a couple others that were sub-par.  

5 stars for ambiance.

My only issue was that the staff was not very  attentive or friendly.  Is that a hipster thing?  Just kidding, kind of.

Their fried chicken fills the deep-fried void that my usual kale-salad diet leaves me with. I&#39;ve tried it both as the dinner option with the chili sauce and as a brunch item with biscuits and gravy. 

Both are great, but I&#39;d definitely give an edge to the brunch styled chicken due to the heart-stopping, mouth-watering, knee-weakening gravy and biscuits. The sides I&#39;ve tried have all been delicious too, including their carrots, sweet rolls, and french toast. A friend ordered the ramen, and although it was tasty, it wasn&#39;t the traditional tonkatsu ramen that you would get at a straight-up ramen joint. I would pass on that if you have your heart set on a traditional ramen.

I highly recommend you make reservations instead of walk-in, as I noticed that many people were walking in the place, standing around for awhile until a table opened up.  

The service is really great.  Even though our waitress was busy with the tables around us and ours, she had a great attitude the entire time and was patient.  She also did a great job of refilling our bottomless mimosas!  Speaking of mimosas, they give you a wine glass instead of a flute, making the bottomless mimosas even more and worth the 12 bucks.

We started out with the Portuguese Sweet Rolls, which come with butter, apple jam and Nutella.  They were surprisingly really, really good, with its fluffy texture yet dense, sweet flavor, especially with the Nutella.  Some of my friends had the Chicken Nugget French Toast which came with a side of country gravy, but they mentioned that the plate was way too rich, so had a hard time finishing it.  My other friends ordered the Tostadas with Kalua Pork for an additional three dollars and believed that the pork was a waste of money.  I had the Loco Moco and it had a bland taste, where all I could taste was soft rice (like congee) even though it was slathered with yolk from two fried eggs and gravy.  I had to put the vinegar hot sauce on the food, for it to have some distinction.  I also didn&#39;t think it was necessary for the dish to have two different meats hence the sausage.  The Loco Moco costs 17 bucks, which is way overpriced for what it is.

Overall the service is awesome and the bottomless mimosas is what to get during brunch.  I just wished I liked the food more."

I&#39;m not from Seattle and infrequently make it up, but considering I went back specifically with all there is to eat in Seattle...speaks volumes! 

Their fries chicken is second to none.  It&#39;s perfectly crispy, perfectly greasy, perfectly flavored and juicy!  It&#39;s outstanding!  I absolutely LOVE their rice, the way it&#39;s sticky but not overly so, moist and not overly cooked and then topped with the seaweed and sesame seed seasoning that you need to get in every bite of rice.  I only wish they gave you more of that. I could eat it all day long! 

Their buns (bread) with the salty butter is just a simple filler, but exceptional! Fluffy and moist and the butter is heavenly.  

Definitely try their green beans and carrots they are super yummy!! 

Missing one star because both times we went we had a cocktail in form or another.  Both practically undrinkable!  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that we aren&#39;t up to the whole craft cocktail vibe in Seattle, but we were just like woah cannot do this revert back to beer!

The cafe is kinda small though, so if you&#39;re planning to dine-in, you are gonna need some luck.  I was lucky enough to get a seat right away.  They can only seat up to probably about 16 people max (inside the store).  They have a nice variety of sandwich selection, in which a lot of them seem pretty unique to me.  I ended up ordering Bacon, BBQ-Pulled-Pork Sandwich and a 12 oz Mocha.  The total price was around $15, which is pretty high for a sandwich and coffee.  However, the sandwich was delicious and I got really full out of the meal.  The two half-sandwiches were serving with lots of kettle corn chips in the middle.  I tried to eat the whole thing, but I got so full so I had to take some home!  The mocha was solid; nothing too special but it had nice flavor of chocolate-blended coffee; and I would prefer here over Starbucks so it&#39;s a yes from me.

I also got treated very well by the cashier guy.  He was being very polite and helpful about my order, showing me the portions of different sizes and giving me the Wi-Fi password.  He eve served the foods to my table!  On top of that, he came by to check if I needed anything else.  So, yeah, he hit all the checklists for great customer service.  Good job!  

If I ever get chance to come back to this place again, I want to try their other sandwiches.  A few of them caught my eyes when I was looking around at other tables...   As I said, the price might be a bit high and you have to compete for the seats, but I had such a great experience that I would love to come back here again."

She suggested Madison Kitchen.

Type of cuisine: A simple, yet very Seattle selection of breakfast sandwiches, paninis/grilled sandwiches and soups/salads and house-made pastries.

Ambiance: Simple and sweet, the awning in front covering the minimalist patio space under the trees lining the sidewalk, nearly masking the floor-to-ceiling street-facing windows. Indoors, a cozy charm surrounds with the wooden accents and glass drop lighting. Limited seating is found throughout, along the right wall and at the entryway to allow space for those placing orders at the walk-up counter, alongside displays of salads, pastries and the coffee bar.

What I ordered: Ready for a sweet treat on this dreary day, I couldn&#39;t pass up the bars they are known for, but had to sample more! I started with a chocolate chip cookie ($2) to eat at the establishment, while my friend and dining companion had a Salad Trio for lunch: including the roasted beets, faro salad, and broccoli slaw. To take away, I selected the S&#39;mores bar ($3.25),
and the Gluten-Free Chocolate Pecan Cookie ($3.25). Just before we left, my friend picked up an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie for her beau, and the Tahini-Pistachio Shortbread for us to nibble on as we ended our conversation and made our way out.

What I loved: The abundance of chocolate chips in the cookie! The beauty of the large bars, and the creativity of the Tahini-Pistachio bar: the texture and flavor of halva, and flaky goodness of shortbread paired perfectly with soft dark chocolate and the crunch of pistachios. But my stand-out favorite was the Gluten Free Chocolate Pecan Cookie.

Why I loved it: Simple elegance, a diverse crowd of neighbors, colleagues and people of all ages.

Cost: Average ($2 - $5 per treat)"

She was clearly new and not a kid...perhaps in her 30&#39;s.  I told her I appreciated how nice she was and that it was the first time in there anyone had smiled at me. So that&#39;s a step in the right direction.  I know my review was unforgiving but yeeeesh.....hipster kids are a bad choice for employees. 

Fingers crossed that the smiles stick."

You can custom make one or order a specialty sandwich. I chose to get a custom sandwich and it was delicious. My mom got the MK special, I don&#39;t remember what it was but she enjoyed hers as well. Everything was great but I was disappointed in their mac and cheese, I thought it was a bit bland for my taste. We also tried their snickerdoodle and oatmeal raisin cookies. They were really delicious but pricey. I think they were $2 each. I really wanted the Belgium waffle but they only serve them during the weekend so I guess I&#39;m going to have to come back!"

Right on the main street, the Madison Kitchen serves as a cozy new breakfast and lunch spot in this out of the way neighborhood. I&#39;m always on the lookout for a weekday breakfast spot, and although simple and tending towards baked goods, it is officially worth a drive across town for their breakfast sandwich w/egg.

Their bakers breakfast comes with a baked item of your choice, a enormous bowl of fresh fruit topped with a petite ice cream sized scoop of rich yogurt and a coffee. I went with a group who ordered this up in quantities, either getting it with some fresh baked scones or in one case, settling on a dark, delicious chocolate egg-white meringue. The black sheep always nails it, because that darn chocolate meringue was terrific and fresh, so much so that you might be willing to rewrite your breakfast rules to include it. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with a very garlicky aioli and a perfectly cooked oozy medium egg. I almost drove back to get it the following day. It was good.

This is a small, popular cafe, and the breakfast here is simple, but respectable and solid: breakfast sandwiches, homemade granola, fresh baked items and oatmeal. Seating is limited and service is not particularly speedy.  When we first arrived, the lone server seemed overwhelmed by the influx of customers, but soon after the owner (or chef?) arrived and the hospitality was taken up a notch and proved attentive.  Later visits for dessert sampling proved exceedingly tasty, we especially like the Naniamo bar and the shortbread bar with chocolate, tahini and pistachios.

Feels like a neighborhood spot.  Clearly inconsistent, given some of the other reviews, but we&#39;ve been several times and had a consistently good experience."

I&#39;ve been going to Madison Kitchen for a few years now and the quality has always been consistent. The staff is friendly and great. Josh is always nice.

The Salad Trio is my favorite item to order. A few great salads that I just love:

1. Tuna
2. Broccoli, bacon and onion
3. Black eyed pea
4. Beet
5. French lentil

Although I don&#39;t currently indulge, I would recommend the pastries/baked goods to anyone not on a diet. They are always delicious. Also the breakfast sandwich is excellent.

Prices are high, but again, it&#39;s Madison Park so I actually think prices could be higher all things considered. Certainly will be back."

I tried the pulled pork sandwich and the roast beef. The pulled pork came out with a hair on the plate (curl and color made it clearly not mine). They brought a new sandwich pretty quickly but seemed pretty un-fazed about it. 

I liked the mint on the pulled pork and the horseradish on the beef, so flavorwise, everything was tasty. We were sad to find that although they serve beer, patrons aren&#39;t allowed to drink it at their outside tables. All in all, a little lackluster."

Was a little disappointed as I&#39;ve purchased this sandwich before and it was around $10 ( which is still a little over priced but would still splurge because I loved it). Today I went in and my bill came out to 12 something?!?! For a take out grilled cheese! I was shocked. Not to mention they did not update it or have that price online. It says 9.95. With tip it came out to 13 something. I know a few bucks isn&#39;t worth saying anything, but had I known I was about to drop 13 bucks for a grilled cheese I would not have came here . I called to ask what that was about and the guy just mentioned that they had not updated their menu. You should honor what&#39;s posted anyways, but that&#39;s just me. It&#39;s unfortunate because I work up the street and I loved coming for lunch, but there&#39;s no way to justify paying 13 bucks and some change for a grilled cheese. 

Update : Ended up being that I was  accidentally over charged due to a mistake. Owner was kind enough to treat me to a free sandwich for the hassle and due to getting over charged. Thank you for the gesture . Glad prices didn&#39;t go up on my sandwich ! Will definitely be back :)"

I brought my family here for lunch when they were in town, visiting from out of state.  We wanted something good, casual, and quick near the arboretum.  
We came into Madison Kitchen and were very pleasantly surprised.  It is small and has the neighborhood coffee shop feel.  We all ordered different sandwiches with different salad options they had available, and they were truly delicious.  I haven&#39;t had a sandwich this good in Seattle yet- but at the time of writing this I have only lived in Seattle for 7 months.  Still, I go out for lunch often and seek out sandwich spots.

My boyfriend&#39;s &#34;go to&#34; is the meatloaf sandwich and I love the salad trio because their deli case is full of inventive concoctions that I always want to try. Always changing and always intriguing.

Outdoor seating on a beautiful day in Madison Park is heavenly but there&#39;s not much incentive to linger. It&#39;s obvious they are trying to turn tables and some seating is right by parked cars, so not much atmosphere to savor. Indoor seating is limited and nice but can get a bit chaotic with noisy families.

I have never been there before and my boyfriend and I just wanted a place to read and grab some breakfast. I&#39;m not complaining on the food. The breakfast sandwich was pretty tasty. However, the service is why I am giving it one star and not returning again. 

Not only did the girl not smile at us when we walked in, but we didn&#39;t understand if it was table service or you order at the counter. She was standing by a table talking to a customer so we figured table. But she didn&#39;t say anything to us as she went behind the counter and we sat there for five minutes. Not even a hey, just so you guys know you can order at the counter when you&#39;re ready. I then ordered when I figured it out and ended up tipping her $5 which I completely regret. She never came to refill my coffee even though she said she would. I understand the whole bussing your own table thing, I&#39;ve worked in counter places before. But when you&#39;re standing behind the counter on your phone or just STARING into space, I can tell you have the time to come pick up our dishes, you just don&#39;t want to. Didn&#39;t ask us how anything was. 

To top it all off, there was a family with three kids that pushed two tables together and when they were getting up to leave, a guy appeared behind the counter that asked that they put the tables back where they were because they have to be in alignment with the lights. Are you kidding me?! You work here. It&#39;s your job to clean up after customers even if they did things you don&#39;t necessarily like. 

Both myself and my partner have been servers for a long time and know the ups and downs of working in the industry and I don&#39;t normally complain about service. However this was just completely annoying.

I couldn&#39;t agree any more with the other review that said it feels like we&#39;re just a pain to them to be giving them money."

While I have enjoyed everything I have tried on the menu, the MK egg sandwich is literally the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had.  I now find myself almost unable to eat other breakfast sandwiches because I always compare it this.  I&#39;m not sure what the secret is....it could have something to do with the basil aoli.

If you want a fast, fresh, organic breakfast or lunch in Madison Park, this is the place to go."

It&#39;s tucked away and there isn&#39;t much room if you plan to sit and work on anything, but the food is AMAZING! Try the BLT, you won&#39;t be disappointed! They serve illy coffee and my latte the one time I had it was nothing great. The staff is generally pretty kind and do a good job at serving their customers. I love Madison kitchen and would recommend it to anyone just stopping by for brunch or lunch!"

The atmosphere is nice, if hollow feeling (its missing a certain je ne sais quoi), and the staff is friendly, if slow. Prices are fair, standard for the area, and service tended to be slower than most considering they can have up to 4 people behind the counter.

I&#39;ve had the Cochinito and Ruben sandwiches as well as their Caesar salad (a nice touch it the large flakes of parmesan cheese on top). The food quality is very good and quantities are average. The &#34;favorites&#34; sandwiches are served with Tim&#39;s chips at 8.95 a piece. Same price for the whole salads coincidentally.

Overall this is a nice addition to the neighborhood that needs some time to gain some character."

Sitting outside in the Seattle sun eating one heck of a sandwich and drinking a delicious latte gets the five stars. It&#39;s the kind of neighborhood spot we all wish was around our corner.

All the baked goods that I have tried, cookies, tarts, and the amazing many layered carrot cake are superb! The chicken cutlets, quiche, frittata are fantastic. Sandwiches are excellent. There is a theme here. The MK is very very good. I stop by to pick up food for dinner and too often for a cookie. So glad to have really good food in the neighborhood!"

We stood a full five minutes at the counter before we were acknowledged - while a barista stood directly in front of us making drinks, and another employee walking back and forth behind the counter. Even a simple &#34;Hello&#34; or &#34;We will be right with you&#34; would have sufficed. They weren&#39;t particularly busy, and when we were acknowledged it felt like we were an obligation rather than paying customers. We had been debating on whether or not to get breakfast,and after the poor service, we opted just for coffee. We were glad as it took an extraordinary long time for our two coffees to finish.
The coffee itself wasn&#39;t that bad - Illy coffee, which some may wonder why you would import coffee all the way from Italy when there are so many delicious local roasters to choose from.  The poor service clouded the otherwise ok drinks.
And from what I see on the other Yelp reviews, it appears I am not the only one that thinks the service here is seriously lacking.  Too bad as the product isn&#39;t that bad - its just that the service leaves such a negative impression..."

However, yesterday was the last time - I went for breakfast - craving eggs.  I was told all they had was an egg sandwich - I didn&#39;t want bread - I was asked &#34;is it a gluten-issue; we have gluten-free bread&#34;.  NO I just don&#39;t eat bread.  No alternative was offered, like &#34;let me get you just an egg on a plate&#34;.  I left and went home to look at the restaurant scene from Five Easy Pieces - it was as absurd at Madison Kitchen as it was in the movie."

The breakfast sandwiches are down-right scrumptious and the pastries are dependable.  I brought my dad here when he was visiting and he loved the scramble.  However, my partner is somewhat of a mocha connoisseur and does not particularly care for their mochas.  I think their drip coffee is great.  The food is on the pricey side, otherwise we would come here way more often.  Madison Kitchen does have limited seating, which can be a problem depending on what time of day you come.  It seems as though moms love to bring their kids here, and we&#39;ve been assaulted a couple of times by a toddler banging around our table or screaming at the top of his lungs... c&#39;est la vie.  We wish Madison Kitchen were open later, since we are night owls and would like to have a work spot available in the neighborhood that is not Starbucks.  All in all, Madison Kitchen is a cheery place for a good bite."

This is a wonderful breakfast/lunch spot in a great location.  The only reason I give this 4 stars vs 5 is the wait time to order.  On a nice day at lunch time it can take a while to order your food.  Even if you call ahead and order to go, you still have to wait in a line that can take a while with people ordering.  I suggest going before 11:30 to void a crowd and long lines."

I do enjoy the 3-salad combo, but they will charge you $2 more if the curried chicken salad is one of your selections.

The first time I went was the day of the &#34;Open House&#34; and I had a mini pumpkin spice muffin and chocolate chip cookie. Both were delicious!

Then I came in for a business meeting and had a drip coffee. Also delicious.

Today I came in and had a half a build your own sandwich and the Pacific Rim coleslaw. I had the sandwich grilled. It was perfectly crisp.

The coleslaw was so yummy. I wanted to eat a whole quart of it. 

Half sandwich and slaw was about $9.50. Not bad for Madison Park and for the quality of the food. I am very pleased!"

It may be my last &#34;trial run&#34;. I come back here for the convenience and proximity to my home, however I wont put myself through the disappointment again. Especially because my husband used the &#34;hate&#34; word and he never does that!
Several times I have come here and several times I have been turned off. 

1. Prices for what you get is a big turn-off!
Example: granola to go and a side of fruit felt like robbery. I got only melon and a quarter of a strawberry for over $10. Two Sandwiches w/ chips and a single cookie $31, need I say more? 
2. Don&#39;t be surprised if you walk out without your sweet treat. I have ordered coffee and a treat. more than once they forgot to give me the sweet treat and had to go back. 
3. Pre-made Dinner: For Thanksgiving I inquired about the meal and what it consisted of. I got a blank stare and a rude, &#34;I don&#39;t know...&#34;. I had to explain there is a sign on the front that said Madison Kitchen provides a full Thanksgiving dinner to purchase, can you tell me about it. I got a response, it consisted of no words but a menu shoved at me. No thank you.
4. #3 pretty much sums it up on the service. Mostly it is an awkward interaction with the people behind the counter. There is one guy I see regularly that is very nice and willing to help. The others I have come across seem to be really unhappy to see you walk in the door or not &#34;see&#34; you. 
5. I ask for my egg to be fully cooked every time, I have yet to receive a specific order correct.

I figure if your overpaying for a sandwich they should at least make it to the request of the customer."

We asked for our eggs poached, which they gladly accepted, and the result were fabulous.  I&#39;d return for the egg sandwich alone.

The decor on the northeast wall is somewhat lacking and I agree with a previous review, that there&#39;s a lack of atmosphere (even though it&#39;s not unpleasant) which is the reason for a 4-star review.  Overall, a great place for a light brekky!"

I have had their pastrami reuben twice, and it is wonderful.  They have yummy baked goods, and delicious salads.  And they serve Illy coffee, which is a plus.   But what is making me write this review is their INCREDIBLE breakfast sandwich. I just finished it.  OH MY GOD.  It was the best breakfast sandwich I have EVER had.  The arugula and the herbed aioli on it elevated it from a really good sandwich to something straight from heaven. And it is served with fresh fruit!  YUMMY!!  I may get another one tomorrow."

The old deli, maybe one of their sandwiches could. But a sandwich at MK no longer fills me up for lunch. Its a great menu, great space, but if I&#39;m going to pay that price for a sandwich I want a deli-sized one, not thin offerings on smaller than avergae bread slices. This is not high tea. The place is fantastic otherwise, but please, bring back the filling sandwiches, fit for taking over to the park or beach for a picnic!"
