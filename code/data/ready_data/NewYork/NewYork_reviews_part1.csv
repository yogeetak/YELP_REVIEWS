I finally was able to try their master piece last weekend and it was everything that I imagined it to be and more. We arrived at around 6:15 pm on a Saturday and surprisingly, the restaurant was completely empty. Tip - the restaurant isn&#39;t tricky to find, but it is a bit confusing on where to enter. You&#39;ll walk past their closed door thinking it&#39;s a side door and end up peeping into the next opened door (which happens to be a different restaurant), so just pull on the first door you see when you see the Virginia&#39;s sign. The restaurant really is that small. 

My boyfriend and I both ordered the famous burger - his medium, mine medium rare. Not sure if it was an off day, but service was lacking here. The bartender didn&#39;t ask / remember who ordered what burger and just handed the burgers to us. My boyfriend ended up with the medium rare, while I ended up with the medium. Granted, both burgers were amazing (we both switched halfway), the medium rare was amazing x1000. It was so juicy! I shamelessly wiped my bun in all of the glorious drippings. Virginia&#39;s burger easily became my favorite burger in NYC, beating out Rahoul&#39;s and the Le Matt from Emmy Squared. 

Despite its sauce, you can hands down still taste the purity of the beef patty. It&#39;s also complemented by an oh so soft bun, which is also toasted to perfection. You also don&#39;t leave the restaurant wanting to crawl into a ball from being overly stuffed and the heaviness of a meal that you just had. My only compliant would be that you&#39;re paying a whopping $18 for just a burger - would love the accompanying side of fries (you can&#39;t order a side of fries either), but hey for the best burger I&#39;ve had, I&#39;ll sacrifice fries (and boy do I love fries). 

Yes, it&#39;s a bit far given its location on Avenue C, but you HAVE to come here for the burger. They&#39;re known for their burgers for a reason."

Virginia&#39;s is a cool-looking little spot and the service was very friendly, but, as someone who goes out to eat many times a week, this place gave me that rare &#34;I just got so ripped off&#34; feeling.

Maybe just don&#39;t get the hanger steak. I got it because Yelp said it was good and I wanted a steak. But it was such a boring steak and the portion was SO INSANELY SMALL. After a $30 hanger steak, I shouldn&#39;t still be super hungry after.

This place wants to be fancier than it is, and it doesn&#39;t work at all."

It&#39;s simple and it&#39;s so juicy and delicious. The simplicity of the burger really lets the beef shine. The bread helps soak up all the juices but you will still have juices run down your finger. Just ignore social graces and lick your fingers. You don&#39;t want to miss any of it. The service here is warm and welcoming. It&#39;s a great place to just have a great bite. It&#39;s relaxed just a great place in the neighborhood.

Alphabet City has so many great hidden gems that are far enough off the beaten path that make them so worth the trip over there from time to time. 

Virginia&#39;s is seriously not to be missed. Let me be clear, we came here for the burger, and OMG we were not disappointed. The bar is small, fits about 10 people at best, and is where you need to be if you want the burger since it&#39;s on the bar menu only. The rest of the menu can also be ordered at the bar. The restaurant itself is small, but not tiny, and very minimalistic and classic. Nothing too fancy about the vibe. The staff were all very friendly and outgoing. 

The bartender, Eric was super friendly and totally fit in to the east village relaxed vibe. We were going to order 2 burgers to split between the 3 of us and 2 smaller plates, but Eric talked us out of it, and basically said he&#39;d like to watch us fight over 2 burgers because they are that good. We cancelled one of the smaller plates and went for the gusto - 3 burgers, all medium rare. SO glad we changed our minds! We also started with the caramelized cauliflower which was awesome and definitely unique. I&#39;m sure the regular dinner menu is great too, and according to Eric, everything on it is amazing. 

The burger was pretty simple with no fancy toppings, no sauces; just Cabot white cheddar and a Vidalia onion marmalade. It needed NOTHING more. The meat was flavorful and the onion marmalade added a touch of sweetness. I ate every. last. bite. It came with nothing but a little side of pickles which was really all it needed. It comes with a price tag of $18, which isn&#39;t something to just blink at, especially since it comes sans fries or a side, but it was absolutely worth it. 

This truly is now on my top list of favorite burgers in the city. Don&#39;t take that statement lightly."

Not only was the food beautifully presented, but it tasted amazing. I am a huge fan of corn and decided to go with the Barbecue Shrimp, Corn, Pickled Mustard Seed, Peach appetizer. What a wonderful way to start my meal. For my main I had the fish which was good. And desert was a delicious Market Fruit Crisp, with Oats and Honey Ice Cream. Sad to say that the menu is always changing here, so I don&#39;t know when Ill be able to get this again. On the bright side each menu item is delicious and I&#39;ll be back to try some new things. 

This place is only wine and beer, but they make great cocktails with their options. If you are a fan of ginger go for the Ginger Spice and Everything Nice!"

The burger and the bartending service we received. This place has been on my burger list since I moved to the east village. So you can only order the burger if you&#39;re seated at the bar. The bartender was just so down to earth and really nice. He was very confident that this would be probably one of the best, if not the best, burger we would ever had. Honestly, he isn&#39;t wrong. This was one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had. And for NYC, reasonably priced. It seems to find a very fancy burger for under $20 is a steal. Their burger is topped with Cabot cheddar, vidalia onion marmalade, and a bone marrow aioli. Seriously? That just sounds amazing typing it out. It&#39;s like having a juicy tender steak in buns. You have to just try it for yourself. I don&#39;t know what I can possibly tell you to describe the joy of eating this burger. Go eat it. ASAP."

Cute place hidden on Avenue C. We were welcomed by a professional service from Eric... truly a nice guy. 

We pretty much came here for their famous burger ($18), and were not disappointed. It&#39;s only available if you&#39;re sitting at the bar, so please don&#39;t be a jerk trying to get it from a table. Good quality of beef, great bun, very good cheese, and delicious caramelized onions. Definitely top-5 burgers I&#39;ve had in the city. It doesn&#39;t come with anything other than a few pickles, so the price tag is kinda high. However, it&#39;s a very sizable bun that will fill you up if you&#39;re not starving. 

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more dishes."

The food was excellent and they have a killer wine selection. We arrived early and had a quick drink at the bar. I strongly suggest the &#34;ginger spice and everything nice.&#34; The summer melon also looked good though I didn&#39;t get to sample that one. 

For dinner I had the ricotta toast, falafel, and s&#39;mores dessert. My highlight was definitely the dessert. It had a toasted marshmallow with sophisticated graham cracker crumble and cold chocolate moose on the bottom. Just so freakkkking good. 

As for service, their sommelier came over to offer suggestions on the wine menu which I thought was a nice touch. Our waiter was attentive, the waters were constantly refilled by a busboy and the bartender didn&#39;t miss a beat when offering suggestions on their all beer and wine menu (no hard liquor here folks). 

Please note that with a few drinks and dinner you will round out a bit of a hefty price tag. Def save for a nicer occasion.

All in all, lovely experience."

Maybe I did it wrong and should have ordered the burger at the bar? Had the cauliflower to start. For dinner I had the mackerel and my boyfriend had the cavatelli. The portions here are EXTREMELY small. I had a very small piece of fish and a few bite sized potatoes. The pasta &#34;large&#34; was the size of a typical appetizer at any other restaurant. The food was tasty with some great flavors but I do not think this makes up for the price and portion. My boyfriend has a stomach ache for the rest of the evening upon finishing eating...

The crab chowder is not to be missed. Eggplant toast was ok. Mushroom risotto pretty yummy. Brussel sprouts were standard and the scallops were also just ok. Nothing too unique honestly. The byrrh cocktail was very good.

What I noticed was how they kept trying to rush us out. We were four girls catching up on a Friday and I saw no reason for them to keep pulling our semi-full plates away. I find that such a huge difference vs dining in Europe. There you&#39;re expected to linger. Here it&#39;s like a big revolving door. Granted, sometimes I&#39;m in a NY rush and I&#39;m in and out. But when I can take the time to enjoy my meal, I&#39;d rather not be pushed out the door. Feel me?"

The space is cute and the service is great and the burger is out of this world! I would argue that it is one of the best burgers in NYC right now. The jam, cheese and juicy burger are perfectly blended and not to mention the perfectly toasted tasty bun! I haven&#39;t been so pleased with a burger in a really long time and this one knocks it out of the park! I got the crushed potatoes on side which were great but totally overshadowed by the star! My burger came out a little to rare for me at medium so if you like it cooked a normal medium I would suggest medium well. They threw mine back to cook with no complaints and it came back perfectly cooked after a few more mins! 

Monday&#39;s the burger is on the bistro menu and sit anywhere...every other night the burger is at the bar only.

Seriously, go NOW!!"

I have personally eaten at a lot of restaurants, ranging from the grittiest holes of Los Angeles to the crunchiest farm-to-table joints of Portland, Oregon, to some of the most renowned restaurants of New York City, and many, many places in between. But this is honestly one of my favorite restaurants of all time.

On a scale of unique flavors and inventive combinations, Virginia&#39;s is a 10, no question. Things happened in my mouth that I never expected nor imagined could happen. So lemme just tell you what we had:

Lamb Tartare. I mean, what the fuck. This dish seemed to contain every ingredient I could want in one dish; lamb, Greek yogurt, harissa, pistachios, dill, parsley...god it was just heavenly. And of all the tartares and carpaccios I have tasted, this one was most unique for the fact that it tasted almost nothing like lamb once it is cooked. I happen to love lamb, but I was surprised at the mildness and ever-so-slightly chewy texture of the raw cut.

Roasted Cauliflower. At first this seemed pretty standard, but when you really got into it, cutting the florets apart and bathing them in the dressing, scooping them into your mouth with pine nuts, speck, and tiny morsels of cheddar, this dish ended up being the perfect veggie starter.

Grilled Red Wattle Pork Chop with fava beans and charred corn. I don&#39;t even have words for this dish. Just imagine eating a fat juicy gorgeous chunk of bacon but better than any bacon ever. I am obsessed with fava beans, so this really hit a homerun for me on every level, and the sweet, fresh, still crunchy corn was exactly the compliment that smoky pork was begging for. I just don&#39;t know how to stress this enough: order the pork.

Lastly, we had a beautiful cut of fish. I can&#39;t even recall what type of fish, but it was served over a bed of legumes and perfectly offset all of the other amazing rich flavors, but it is mentioned as somewhat of an afterthought, since it did not quite reach the incredible heights of the other dishes. (However we still cleaned the plate to a near shine.)

We shared both desserts on the menu and all I can say is that this is a far cry from your boring creme brulee. There was black sesame ice cream with some kind of frozen raspberry compote which was so surprising and addictive that as soon as it was gone I wanted another serving. The dark chocolate, roasted peanuts, banana, and brown butter was basically the best chocolate dessert I&#39;ve ever eaten. I mean c&#39;mon. It is just perfect in every way. The texture of the chocolate and crunch of the roasted peanuts became my whole world during the beautiful moments that my tastebuds were allowed that experience.

Needless to say there was scarcely a remaining trace of food or sauce on any of the plates that were delivered to our table. We had a beautiful bottle of white wine which complimented every bite.

Finally, I have to give high credit to the service. Every single person who works at Virginia&#39;s is someone you feel like you can talk to. Our server was an angel. The manager was incredibly friendly and attentive. The bartender was both funny and personable. The guys in the kitchen were visible and, well, they turned out some of the best food I&#39;ve ever tasted. I want to personally congratulate them. I just cannot wait to come back to Virginia&#39;s."

Overall, I felt this place was a bit overrated, and more expensive than it should have been. 

Perhaps the burger (only available at the bar) makes for a better meal."

It was really juicy and flavorful and the toppings went very well with it. We tried all of the sides: potatoes, squash and Brussels sprouts and all of them were great.  We also had the pickles, which were very good.  Our group tried both of the desserts, the chocolate one and the black sesame pudding one and both were great. I had a mixed drink as well and that was delicious too.  Great dinner, and I would love to go back sometime."

I had the virginia spritz cocktail, which was an amazingly refreshing citrusy and not-too-sweet spruced up version of a wine spritzer. The meat and cheese appetizer was delicious, as well as the scallops and steak. The portions are fairly small so it&#39;s nice to order multiple menu items between a table and sample. Something was a little off about the ambiance that I couldn&#39;t really put my finger on - maybe the lights were too bright or the rap music? - but with food that good it&#39;s fully worth the trip."

It was an early dinner, at 6, so the place wasn&#39;t too crowded when we got there.  The place isn&#39;t huge, but there&#39;s two rooms and a bar.  The window in the front was wide open, which is nice to have when the weather is nice.  The tables are a bit close together, but while we were there no one sat directly next to us, so it didn&#39;t bother me at all. 

We weren&#39;t too familiar with the wine list, and weren&#39;t looking for something too expensive, so the wine guy (sommelier just doesn&#39;t sound right when I say it) helped us to pick out something we liked.  He found us a bottle of Riesling that wasn&#39;t too sweet, and all of us enjoyed.  

On to the food!  We all got our own appetizers and entrees and split desserts.  I got the sweetbreads!  When I found what sweetbreads were I never thought I&#39;d like them, but I tried it for the first time at WD-50 and have been hooked ever since.  I hate when people say this, but it really does taste like fried chicken.  It was really good here too.  It was accompanied by peas and apricots at the bottom.  For my main course I got the Atlantic striped bass.  It was really good.  The skin was nice and crispy and the fish was cooked well.  It was in a broth and had clams and potatoes underneath the fish.  For dessert I shared the Austrian (I think, it was a special) layer cake. It was good, it kind of tasted like marzipan.  I would have liked a chocolate dessert, but they only had a chocolate beet cake and my dad despises beets.  I&#39;m not a fan either really, so we went with the special. 

Overall, food was great!  It was a nice little spot.  It&#39;s kind of out of the way, being close to the corner of Ave C, but I&#39;d like to go back sometime.  The menu is not huge, but I feel like everyone should find something they like."

I came here with my cousin and we started off with Grilled White Shrimp which was absolutely delicious, and the waiter was kind enough to bring extra bread so we could use the sauce leftover. For my large plate order, I got the Five-Spice Chicken Breast, which was nicely flavored and matched perfectly with the Crushed Potatoes. My cousin got the duck special which was super flavorful and tasty.

Anyways, onto the food... We started off with a shrimp appetizer which I thought was perfectly cooked just like the scallops I had for main. The shrimp were crispy on the outside and very moist and tender when you take a bite. The scallops were nicely seared and bursting with flavor. I loved it! To balance my palettes I had the panna cotta which was delightful. It was not overly sweet, very smooth and creamy. 

Overall, the service was A+ which completed the meal!"

We were quickly offered an apology - which was completely unnecessary as it was our fault completely - and offered seats at the bar...now...I had read up the restaurant before coming and jumped at this offer!  I knew there were good things only available at the bar!

And I would just like to quickly mention here that you should completely ignore the reviews by the spoiled NY reviewers that were upset that they couldn&#39;t get the burger at the tables - the restaurant is very clear about this policy. And I can just imagine the obnoxious behavior of these pompous brats and Virginia&#39;s staff has my sympathy.....how dare they tell other people how they should run their businesses...gross presumptuousness.

Our dinner was fantastic. We tried so many different things and loved them all.  The beer and wine selection with educated suggestions was a treat.  And yes....that burger you&#39;ve been hearing about is that good - BUT ONLY AT THE BAR.  Don&#39;t be an ass - if you want the burger, sit at the bar.

Service was attentive and fun.  The staff obviously has a great respect and joy for Virginia&#39;s and it shows.

I can&#39;t wait to go back...and I&#39;m torn about where to sit...but I keep thinking about that burger!

Thank you Virginia&#39;s for making my birthday dinner and extra special treat in every possible way!"

Of course I do. Let&#39;s be real, this place is theoretically not for anyone under 21. I had a hard time to settle with tap water and continue drinking my Starbucks latte without being stared at, which trust me, wasn&#39;t a pleasant experience (they came to me three times trying to get rid of my coffee!) I don&#39;t know if it is this place&#39;s fault or maybe just because I&#39;m in East Village and nobody adores Starbucks. Or maybe it&#39;s just me being picky.

Otherwise, things are pretty solid. Our uber ride came a tiny bit late but we had no problem settling for a nice table. My burger was nice, just as nice as everyone else cited, and my buddy&#39;s sandwich turned out quite nice. Very juicy, very satisfying, and stimulated my taste bud just enough for me to not grab a dessert at the end.

I&#39;d love to say this place is casual, but even without the wine, it went a tidbit above my budget. Saw a table of wealthy, presumably Jewish gentleman, who seems to be having the time of their lives. That&#39;s how I will show up here the next time."

Virginia&#39;s recently opened on the quiet corner of Avenue C. I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant as it had some high-profile names (ex-Per Se Sous-chef Christian Ramos and Locanda Verde vet Reed Adelson) showcasing modern American bistro food. I thought this could be the kind of neighborhood place I would love to go again and again and wish no one would know about. While the food overall was all good, though, I didn&#39;t see unexpected magic coming from the kitchen. 

The starters I tried were both good, Grilled white shrimp came with peaches and purple pole beans and provided a nice crunchy texture. Seared cuttlefish also had an interesting texture and worked well with asparagus and green garlic. Neither dish was particularly ground-breaking, however. I guess I was expecting a bit more vitality and versatility in flavor, and cuttlefish was a bit on the salty side. The large dishes were a bit more underwhelming. I was really eager to check out the roasted duck breast, but it came away a bit on the tougher side to my great surprise. I have grown to love the tender texture of perfectly cooked meat, and came away puzzled, and the fermented soy bean, breakfast radish, and plum didn&#39;t add much to the meat. Atlantic striped bass, accompanied by saffron, cockles and potatoes, was nicely cooked, but bass is another one of those foods I&#39;d grown to love and tried truly outstanding dishes elsewhere, so perhaps my standard had become unattainably high. I am all for a simple yet well-executed meal, but the one at Virginia&#39;s felt a bit inconsistent. Raw honey panna cotta came with blueberry compote for a nice, delicate flavor, but it wasn&#39;t particularly memorable.

Getting a reservation at Virginia&#39;s wasn&#39;t particularly hard, although the space was nearly packed in the course of my meal. The restaurant has a full bar with fairly standard cocktail menu and some nice wine selections. I did like the neighborhood vibe of the restaurant that gives the cozy vibe of the increasingly gentrified Alphabet City. I really wish I could&#39;ve liked Virginia&#39;s more, but I&#39;ve been to other American bistro places lately that I would give higher score for consistency. Perhaps I would visit again once the kitchen settles down a bit more?"

This sweet little restaurant is tucked into the east village off of avenue C, but it&#39;s well worth the venture east. Once here, don&#39;t even hesitate. Just get the BURGER. It&#39;s only served at the bar, so plan to post up there. But, hey, it&#39;s fun eating at the bar sometimes isn&#39;t it?! Okay, back to that burger. Order it medium rare. The juiciness that oozes from this thing is amazeballs. What makes it extra special and flavorful is the vidalia onion marmalade...sweet but not too overpowering. And that cheddar cheese mmmmm. Didn&#39;t want it to end.
Nice app and side too - white shrimp and Brussels sprouts."

This quaint little spot is the newest addition to Alphabet city providing amazingly fresh and fun dishes.  Everything about this place was simply delectable.  We were made to feel so welcome!  What a great start for this new restaurant!!!

The Food:
Magnificent!  Chef Christian Ramos did such a fantastic job on the scallops.  They just melted in your mouth.  We also had the summer squash toast which was so fresh and fun.  A taste of spring, it was a great starter.  We also had the grilled shrimp with fresh garbanzo beans and Asian pear.  The pear was an excellent addition to these very meaty and fresh shrimp, the tastes pared so well.  For dessert we had the cookie (I think this was the Baumkuchen?).  This was just so wonderfully prepared.  The presentation and taste were just exquisite.

The Drinks:
We opted for the Columbia Valley cab which was fantastic.  The wine selection is small but they had some very solid wines I recognized from tastings I&#39;ve been to.  The cocktail selection is also small but cheap!  Only $9 for a cocktail?  Superb!

The Atmosphere:
Quaint, warm, and inviting.  There was a small bar area and a couple rooms with warm space.  The place was also very clean.

The Service:
Our server was so warm and friendly.  She checked up on us a few times to see how we liked each dish.  She had recommended the summer squash toast which was lovely.  The real kicker was when Chef Christian came out and spoke with us at the end of dinner.  I got some great advice on how to cook scallops (something that&#39;s eluded me for ages).  

What an amazing time I had here.  I usually don&#39;t go back to many places, but I just HAVE to return.  I have to try Christian&#39;s hangar steak!  If it&#39;s half as good as his scallops, I will just melt!  Superb!"

Based on the previous reviews, I went in with high expectations and they were all spot on. 

We had 7:30 reservations but my friend was running late so I waited at the bar until we were ready to be seated. When my friend arrived, they transferred my bar tab to my table without any fuss and treated me like I was a regular by knowing my name based on my reservation, despite the fact that it was my first time here. 

Even though the space is tight, and we were less than 6 inches from the tables next to us, the dinner still felt intimate enough where it didn&#39;t feel like we were sharing our meal with the strangers seated along side us.

For us, however, we were there to celebrate and so that night it was like our motto was, &#34;the more the merrier&#34; and true to form, we ended up making new friends with the couple seated on my right, as if we suddenly became a four-top midway through our meal. 

I honestly wish they had more vegetarian options. I accidentally ordered two appetizers based on the description on the menu without realizing there was meat. To start, we ordered: Caramelized Romanesco (sans Speck). It was fine but would have probably been better served as it was intended.

We also ordered the Mizuna salad, a Japanese broccoli type dish (which was probably the best thing on the menu) that no longer seems to be available.

And the Crispy Sweetbreads. *Caution! Turns out this isn&#39;t actually a sweet bread as the name implies, but we found out too late and took a bite before realizing the texture seemed off.. turns out it&#39;s veal! My bad.. (we&#39;re both vegetarians - sorry!).

For sides, we ordered the Crushed Potatoes (which was more like very creamy mashed potatoes) and it was smothered in chives giving it a really awesome crunch. I actually really loved everything about it. 

We also got the Roasted Mushrooms but it was a little too salty so I had to balance it out with a mouthful of the potatoes with each bite.

For our main, we split the Gnocchi and it was delicious! It was creamy, soft, savory and I really appreciated their plucky size because it gave them a nice mouth-feel.

The Chocolate Beet Cake was actually very good. The portion size seemed extremely small, even for fine-dining plated dessert standards, but nevertheless, I enjoyed the entire 3 bites it yielded.

We also got the ordered the Raw Honey Panna Cotta, which was fine."

We noticed the press Virginia&#39;s was getting in various publications, and being two locals and business owners, were eager to see what the hype was all about. 

There is no way to explain how impressed we are. We walked into an empty restaurant (still is btw, almost 8pm). You wouldn&#39;t know it. The staff from the wait staff to management are all so on point, not cracking a bit under the obvious nerves of a brand new restaurant on its second day, waiting for the people to come. Come they will. I have no doubt this is going to be the place that Alphabet City knows to go to for a very un-alphabet city dining experience. Everything is perfect. Every dish is constructed perfectly. Perfect. Got it? It&#39;s perfect.

I would list the dishes we had, but there&#39;s no point. It&#39;s clear to us they know exactly what they&#39;re doing, so order anything and enjoy.

Thank you Virginia&#39;s! We&#39;ll see you soon."

Great cocktails served by a very knowledgeable and friendly bartender. And so reasonably priced at $9. Yup, you read that price correctly!

Wine list, while not super extensive, has some really nice choices and also very affordable. I don&#39;t recall a bottle over $75.

Food was delicious. We shared the grilled shrimp and cuttlefish apps - so flavorful and fresh. And we shared the hanger steak and mushrooms for the main course. Steak was cooked perfectly!

Service friendly and helpful, as well.

Only complaint of the night was that the wine was served a bit too warm, especially for a typical muggy summer evening. But a quick chill down did the trick.

If you live nearby or don&#39;t mind going to the out of the way location, check this place out!"

I came in on a Tuesday night at 8 with no reservation and we were promptly seated at the bar. 

The decoration is warm and cozy, typical East Village/Alphabet City style. The yellow  leather seats set against the white brick wall, reminding me of the Hamptons. I like that they opened up all the front doors - even sitting in the back of the room, we could still feel the breeze. 

Menu is not big but very well thought of and intriguing. Mostly small and medium plates so good for sharing. It is new American cooking but sparks Asian influence here and there. 

Good thing, my friend was starving so we just ordered any thing catching out eyes :)

We started with couple small plates:
- Grilled white shrimp. 3.5/5  The real star of the dish is the dressing which appears to be green peas purée . Simply seasoned with sea salt, spring herbs and decorated with Asian pears. It&#39;s healthy and seasonal. The reason of 3.5 is that the shrimps were slightly over-cooked.

- Crispy sweetbread. 3.2/5  I had high expectation for this dish yet I was not as impressed. The breading was a tad too thick for my taste; and it was not crispy but almost rock-hard - think a frozen chicken nugget. That is how hard the crust was. I could barely taste the sweetbread itself. on the other hand, I love the dressing and the accompany  pea leaves and charred lemon. the color is simply delightful. I wish the taste too. 

- Seppia a la Plancha 3.8/5 This is good but not mind-blowingly good. Savory, toothsome seppia goes well with the sweet, earthy asparagus and green garlic. 

We ordered a bottle of Varron Cotes du Jura Chardonnay to go with the small plates. and it worked out perfectly. Adding one note, wine list is well curated and reasonably priced at Virginia&#39;s.

Now move on to the bigger ones. 

- Gnocchi with morels, fava beans, top it with shaved parmesan. I am not a fan of any pasta; but this one will get my vote. The texture of the gnocchi is al dente! The dressing is savory and fragrant. It is also a nice transition from the lighter, smaller plates for the meatier entree to come.

We switched to Les vins contés R14 for the main courses. it is a lovely red blends, ruby red, robust plum, raspberry notes, soft tanning.  

- Seared scallops. The scallops are huge!  Perfectly charred outside yet still juicy and buttery inside. Cutting it in halves are effortless; putting in your mouth , it melts like butter! Very satisfactory. This dish itself is worthy coming back for. 

- Now the star of tonight&#39;s dinner: roasted duck breast, seasoned with fermented soy bean, accompanied with breakfast radish and plum. The skin is light and crispy with a thin line of fat adding richness to the dish but not feeling heavy at all. The meat is soft and juicy. The fermented soybean adds earthy, savory taste to the bird; the accompany plums are tart and sweet, great contrast to the saltiness of the soybean sauce . 

Along the main course, we order two sides, the roasted mushrooms and crushed potatos. All good. 

We finished up with the chocolate beet cake, with Beet Cream, Oaxacan Chocolate, Amaretti. it was lighter than regular chocolate lava cake. if you like dessert, def go with this one.

Overall, I am very impressed about Virginia, giving the fact that they just opened a week ago. Food are well designed and perfectly executed. And services was friendly and prompt. The bar tender, Ginger, is a total sweetheart, who took care of all our orders, questions and drinks! I wish I lived close enough to come back often.

Don&#39;t say I did not warn you. Words are out, make your reservation before it becomes too difficult to :)"

This is a difficult one to review because although we didn&#39;t like it, I feel like nothing that was served was different than what the chef intended to do.

That doesn&#39;t stop me from thinking I spent way too much money for a meal that I didn&#39;t like. 

The portions are not filling at all (and please do not think that it is the reason why I didn&#39;t like the food; would there have three times more food, I would have found the food just as unsatisfying). 

Not much flavor, and the only flavors I tasted were actually not the kind of taste I wanted in my mouth.

It took over a fairly crappy pub that had mediocre food and never had any people in it, so seeing a nice restaurant like this pop up was a welcome sight. Well, had dinner here finally tonight and man, was the food fantastic. My boyfriend and I started with the shrimp and peaches, which was delightful. I wish there were, oh, maybe 6 shrimp instead of 4, for the price, but it was great.

I had the sweet corn risotto and he had the hangar steak. We got the potatoes on the side. Those potatoes were amazing! so so so good. I loved my risotto; im a big fan of risotto in general, but often they are a little too creamy and very heavy. Not so here, it was just perfect and delicious. Even my boyfriend was in love with the couple bites he took.

The steak was very good; he ordered it medium rare, and that it was. But even better than the steak was the Argentinian chorizo served on the side. Wow. I could eat just a plate of that!

On top of the food, VERY friendly service. They were really kind to us with being neighbors, and everyone just seemed so pleasant and attentive. Couldn&#39;t ask for better.

I enjoyed the eggplant toast despite not being a big fan of eggplant.  Ditto for the brussel sprouts.  The duck small plate was great, as was the cuttlefish.  The butternut squash risotto was delicious.  The star of the night, though, was the diver scallops.  They were easily some of the best I&#39;ve had.  Every dish was fairly simple, not overly ambitious, but extremely tasty.

The service was very good - friendly, helpful and quick.  The atmosphere is relaxed, though a little noisy, which is unavoidable given the close proximity of the tables.

I&#39;m a food and beverage photographer whose photographed in some great kitchens, so I don&#39;t think the euphoria of the celebration clouded my experience at Virginia&#39;s.  Again and again the food and staff will draw us farther east than we would normally be willing to go.

Must have: Caramelized Romanesco"

A mere 2 minute walk from our apartment and new to the neighborhood. We didn&#39;t have a reservation and a table for two would have been an hour but  they had spots at the bar which suited us fine...plus you get full access to the bar and full menu. The bartender was great and super friendly; cocktails were delicious! Nice selection too. But the food...just incredible!! I had the pumpkin risotto and it was delicious...very rich but worth it! My husband had the burger and it was the best burger we have had in NY...and we have had our fare share! Juicy and so flavorful! This is definitely a place we will come back too!

Came here by recommendation of The Infatuation and I must say they have definitely found a gem in East Village. Arrived around 7:00pm on a Monday and there were plenty of seats. 

The Roasted Mushroom, Chicory, Sunchokes appetizer was out of this world; each bite was a different but equally amazing flavor. I believe that the restaurant doesn&#39;t have a liquor license yet, but their wine-based drinks are expertly-made and an untrained palate probably couldn&#39;t even tell the difference. For the main course, the Hanger Steak, Argentine Chorizo, Bok Choy entree was cooked perfectly. Ordered it medium rare and even though the steak was pre-cut into bite sizes, the flavors and textures were on point. 

Everyone needs to try this place."

Almost $30 for a scallop &#34;entree&#34; with only two scallops is something I would expect at le bernardin, not a cramped bistro.  Worth checking out but they need to do something about portion vs pricing balance.

Also, they don&#39;t have full liquor license yet, but the wine-fortified cocktails are nice and refreshing."

My wife and I really enjoy making it out to excellent restaurants that NYC has to offer, and we both left very impressed and most importantly... happy. 

Virginia&#39;s gave us one the best dining experiences we&#39;ve had in a long time. the atmosphere is not overly stuffy, but the food is top-notch. My first meal here was an early meal on NYE and we had an delightful time. Excellent and inventive food, good cocktails and a well selected by-the-glass wine selection.

The service was really outstanding as well, to go with the vibe of the restaurant (and the neighborhood). Everyone was very relaxed, attentive, friendly - and casual but absolutely professional. 

My wife and I are new parents and don&#39;t get a chance to dine out often, but the combination of proximity and our experience means that given the chance, we will definitely be back."

he had been aggressive all night (this was last night, in case a manager wants to confirm) but we ignored it. then, as we were having dessert, i looked over and he was talking to a group at the end of the bar and looking over at us laughing. then he waved at me and the others started to laugh. it was strange and felt nasty but i couldn&#39;t figure it out. finally, he came over and said, do you need anything else. i asked, do you need us to leave. then he said, well yes actually we need the seats. i wouldn&#39;t have said anything but you asked. the truth is, he taunted us and then i asked and then he said yes go. we had just spent over $150. i woke up thinking about it and still can&#39;t believe that guy works in the hospitality business."

Staff energy level and flow -  depressed and awkward.
Atmosphere and space - guess the music was good.

Be prepared to come with a fat wallet only and no personal affects because the tables are so tiny and also so crammed together.., it is designed for grasshoppers.

I understand the resume of the owners, but cmon you are operating in alphabet city- don&#39;t be so precious over yourselves. 

Food wins. Experience = 2, thus the 3 stars. 

From what I witnessed, I give them until February/March 2016.

I have written very few reviews, two of my predicted fails resulted in exactly that. 

If you can withstand the awkward environment and pay $$$$$, yes the food delivers. However I&#39;m commenting on &#34;the whole&#34; dining out experience, and I hope they make some changes to last. 

Again , Food nearly flawless. You will pay for it.

Amazingly subtle and rich food with lots of surprises  and moderate prices. The staff is professional yet friendly and the space is simple but warm. I think that they use locally sourced ingredients  and  make changes to the menu with the seasons 
We had the romanesco and the cuttle fish appetizers which were both extraordinary. For our main courses we shared the hanger steak and the bass- both fabulous. Our friends shared the corn risotto as an appetizer and raved about it. The wine list is interesting with fair prices. This was our second visit and we will be back again soon.

The grilled shrimp appetizer is literally shrimp that was sauteed for 5 minutes and put on a plate with cocktail sauce. The burger is AMAZING, but its the only thing worth going for and they only serve it on mondays. I had the seabass and it was way too fishy and at best 3oz for a 20 something dollar fish! The service was great but not a great food experience over all. I&#39;d skip it and go to gnoccho around the corner."

For entrees I personally had the scallops one visit and the sea bass the other visit. Both were very good. Others had the steak, and the pork and only good reviews. Table shared a variety of sides and apps (romanesca, eggplant toast, Brussels sprouts, shrimp, mushrooms), and all 3 desserts. Everything was fantastic.

I ordered the Oyster Ceviche which had great flavors but very small portion. Then I had the duck. This is where I give it five stars. That was the best duck I have had ever.

This is a great little (literally) restaurant in the far East Village, an American neighborhood bistro that will challenge you a bit and please you a lot. It&#39;s tight, bordering on communal, but offers really interesting very seasonal food and an exceptionally thoughtful and diverse wine list. We split the corn risotto entree as an app - sweet corn, chanterelles, etc - summer farmer&#39;s market in a bowl. They gave us an order of the caramelized romanesco gratis - really good. Hanger steak and very gingery scallops were delicious. BTW, nothing is over $26, I think - and the wine list is really unusual. Try the white Txakolina if you haven&#39;t had it before, really nice. No liquor license yet but they&#39;re making up for it with some interesting wine-based cocktails.

Incredible food and service; the only negative was that it was a little warm in the restaurant; hence the four stars.

We had a party of 5 and each got something different but shared everything among the group.  The sweet corn risotto was over the top as were the starters of grilled Romanesco and grilled white shrimp.  Other favorites were the hangar steak and duck.

Service was excellent -- on point without being over bearing. We both had appetizers -- I had a romanescu salad and my friend had grilled oysters. Excellent -- especially my salad. My friend had gnocchi and I had scallops for our mains. Perfectly cooked with a sear on the outside and juicy on the inside. We had roasted mushrooms and mashed potatoes as sides -- the mushrooms are so hearty it was almost like having meat. Delish. Desserts were terrific too. One nit is that they don&#39;t have a full liquor license...oh well, we had to stick with their excellent and unusual selection of beers (and I had a great glass of Chardonnay with the scallops.)

The menu is small but diverse. The wine list is very interesting and accessible. We picked out three wines and then asked the sommelier for a recommendation, he was great and we settled on a wonderful Carignon. My friends had the scallops and I had the fish special.

I frequent here for dinner. When I don&#39;t want to cook or have crave for comfort food, I think of their juicy pork and rice meatballs bubbling on a cast iron skillet, tenderest fried chicken strips in flavorful crisp crust, perfectly harmonized sautéed mushroom and kale grilled cheese sandwich, fun to eat fried potato balls (tater tots), creamy yet light mac &amp; cheese with a porched egg, fried green tomatoes and fried pickles, to name a few. They are not just usual bar food, guys!

I see there are many cute &#34;first date&#34; couples and beer aficionados who challenge knowledgeable bartenders among groups of well-behaving, happy, respectful patrons. It tends to get loud when this small place is crowded after dark, but it&#39;s OK, everybody&#39;s having a good time. There are no waiters that interrupt your conversation, your order will be delivered quickly, and nobody is going to force you to order more drinks that you don&#39;t want. You walk in, find a table or bar stools, order what you want with one of the professional and kind bartenders, and enjoy yourselves with good drinks and food. As simple as that.

More people seem to come here for drinking than eating, which struck me as odd because the food was great, nicely presented, and, as mentioned, had generous portions. 

Was too tired to imbibe, but there are plenty of choices for liquor, beer, and wine lovers, and the mimosas looked the best I&#39;ve ever seen: 1/4 OJ and the sparkling wine overflowing over the top of the glass.

Place has a summery, almost maritime feel because of the open-faced wall [in the summer] on a somewhat quiet block. Service was very slow for Sunday at noon (maybe someone called out sick and they were overwhelmed?)."

They have a great selection of beers and whisky but I stick as always with my vodka soda.  

I had the fried pickles, if I see these on a menu I must try them.  They were great, I have my eyes on the iPa fries and the grilled cheese which I hear are popular.

Service was fast and friendly and fun, Olivia is my favorite.  The other clientele were nice too so the place has a really chill vibe.  I will be adding this bar in my &#39;rotation.&#39;"

I just moved to the upper east and this restaurant is on my block so I thought I&#39;d give it a try. I absolutely love it. The ambiance is great. Good vibe without being overly crowded or loud. Which I love. The bartender Roberto is great. I have been there probably 4 or 5 times in the pst couple weeks. It&#39;s that good. The food there is also on point. I tried their Mac-n-cheese one night when I wasn&#39;t feeling well and needed some comfort food and it was soooo good! It really hit the spot. There are so many things that I want to try on the menu. I went last week and had the kale and collars greens salad and it was delish as well and very hearty. I figure I&#39;ll just keep going back and trying new things until I&#39;ve gone through the whole menu haha. Highly recommend checking this place out for a drink or food!

I was a bartender for over 10 years and have never seen such disrespect.  I think his name was Mike.  I have had some pretty bad customers and would never get away with that behavior.  They seemed like nice girls.  Not sure what his problem was but I won&#39;t be going back there.  I think I would try the 2 story place next door.  I think it&#39;s called 5 mile or something like that.  I feel bad for whomever dates him with a temper like that.  Good luck!

This place is more a bar than restaurant, so it was dark and very loud so we had trouble hearing one another, but I guess that is to be expected of a bar. 

Service was just okay. We were able to seat ourselves right away but had to order at the bar and after that, they served us the food. Also at the bar, we asked for water, which took quite awhile to arrive at our table... It took so long that we had to physically go to the bar to ask for it again. 

Also, the food menu was not that extensive so we we had limited options. At least the food was pretty good though. 

We ordered homemade tater tots, which were OUT OF THIS WORLD amazing! They were the BEST tater tots I have ever had. The tater tots were delightfully delicious fried balls that were extra crispy, coupled with fluffy potato interior and just mouthwatering morsels of yumminess! I  definitely could have eaten every single one of them, but I only had 2 because sharing is caring, ya know. 

For my entree, I ordered the hamburger with Muenster cheese, onions, lettuce, tomato and a fried egg on top. This burger was massive! The only thing it was missing was bacon (might have been overkill but anyone who really knows me, knows that I love many toppings on anything I eat). It took me awhile to cut the burger and figure out how to eat it... It was quite messy but very tasty. The meat was juicy, well flavored and seasoned; the cheese was wonderfully melty; the vegetables were crisp and crisp and the egg was a nice addition. All the ingredients tied together well and made for a very satisfying and filling meal. 

Overall, though I found the food to be good, I probably wouldn&#39;t come back unless I am in the neighborhood, which isn&#39;t often."

What I&#39;m trying to say is everything I&#39;ve ever eaten here has been AWESOME. Another personal favorite is the bourbon bacon jam grilled cheese. Holy moly, the combo of bacon, in a more easily chewable form, plus hot, melty cheese, on large fluffy bread is downright dangerously good. The food does not disapoint

Onto the beer (probably what you&#39;re coming here for)!!! Super solid beer selection. Last time I was in, they had a bunch of sours and IPAs, which is what I&#39;m into, so it was a total win. Also they&#39;re one of the blessed few who manages to get their hands on some beloved Grimm beer, so that&#39;s a huge selling point. They&#39;re really fabulous at bringing in seasonal beers, while keeping a few staples on hand. 

The only negatives keeping this from a five are the noise level, and service. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s up with the acoustics of this place but it gets LOUD, so it&#39;s a little difficult to have a convo with someone unless you&#39;re sitting really close...which might not be the worst thing for a date. The other drawback was the service. Bartenders would make eye contact, then look away and help someone else. Unless you&#39;re a repeat visitor, don&#39;t expect to get served or acknowledged in a speedy manner.

All that aside, I do love this place and will be back because the combo of fabulous food and excellent beers is hard to beat on the UES."

I also asked for a sangria (just because they said they donate 1 dollar out of 10 to cancer research). I ordered a &#34;sangria light ice&#34;, because we as Europeans are not used to that much ice. What I received was only half a glass of sangria!! Because the other half should have been ice!
My mushroom melt arrived 10 mins before my friend&#39;s burger. There is only one person delivering the food. So if you need cutlery, you need to wait another 10 mins for him to show up. 
The fries look food from the top, but all skin and burnt below! See the picture. 
Perhaps a good bar, but with this service, they don&#39;t really have to serve food!"

This time around on a Wednesday afternoon, got to sample some of that good looking food from their regular offerings.

This place does NOT skimp on portion sizes. Got the Classic Burger w/gruyere ($13) and a side of Homemade Tots ($7). Burger comes on a pretzel bun, with your assorted condiments and a juicy properly-cooked patty. Each bite melts and the bread keeps it all intact. The tots are enormous (definitely a &#34;share&#34; item) - warm and served with a tangy ranch sauce to the side. 

A little on the pricey side, but all the meals are shareable/take-out worthy. Obviously the beer list is top notch, and combined with the food will make this a must-stop in the area."

On to the food..... The pimento burger (despite its good looks) was OK... nothing special. The fried chicken however... SO GOOD. It comes with honey butter but we also asked for honey and hot sauce. The sweet and spicy combo = 100.

The whole brunch (IPA fries, beer, bloody mary, fried chicken, and burger) came out to $60 for the two of us with tax and tip. Not bad at all considering we left completely full and had tons of food to go.

It used to be a very welcoming neighborhood bar where you can have a drink and converse with the talented bartenders. Not anymore. On Monday night, I had brought some friends there from out of town for an after dinner drink. Upon paying the bill, my friend had left $2 in quarters towards payment as she wasn&#39;t from the US and was leaving the next day. She had figured why not get rid of the currency and add extra money towards the tip. Mike the bartender got angry and threw the money in the air. He stated they didn&#39;t accept change. We had more than enough money to cover everything and were over-tipping at this point. This bartender should be fired as he caused a scene and made my friend feel terrible about this country and the way we treat each other here. I take pride in my neighborhood bars and I&#39;m embarrassed by how this establishment runs its business."

Whatever it was (hummus, dip, etc), that was nothing to write home about. Also another time I had the smoked wings are they were not my cup of tea. In this sense, I think the menu can be improved upon. 

Besides that, my only other gripe is that the music could be better. By this, I mean that the atmosphere here has so much potential to be cooler. I suggest playing some loud, good ol&#39; rock n roll. Imagine walking into this place while its blasting The Who or Hendrix? Currently, the music is not even audible. The music must be audible enough to drown out the one or two resident loud, drunken fools at any NYC bar. 

Luckily, the IPA fries and beer selection are reason alone to come here. 

This place has a downtown vibe and a cute bartender, two major pluses for the Upper East Side."

We ordered the Sweet Georgia Peach cocktail with homefries and mac and cheese with pork belly. The drinks were strong (not complaining) but tasty. The homefries were just okay, but the mac and cheese was delicious - very creamy without being too rich. Since this place is more of a bar, we placed our order with the bartender but didn&#39;t sit at the bar. This is probably why our food order was forgotten, and we had to order again 20 minutes later. Not too much of a problem because this gave me a good buzz and a chance to get hungry. Not a place that I&#39;d rave about, but I wouldn&#39;t mind visiting again and trying other cocktails."

Classic Burger 12
house ground Creekstone Farms flank &amp; shoulder steak, pretzel bun, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles
--We asked for medium, but it came out more medium-well to well. Still very good, though!


Sausage Gravy 12
house ground Berkshire pork sausage &amp; bacon, sage and black pepper gravy, biscuit, fried egg
--This was one of the brunch &#34;specials&#34;. The gravy was very chunky. Bottom of the biscuits were very crispy, almost burnt. It wasn&#39;t bad and actually sort of made it kinda unique.

The place is tiny and can get crowded but we were able to get a table right after entering. The only con I have is that it was really loud. 

Sweet Corn Grits - I had high expectations since I am from the South but they tasted instant with all of the flavors mixed together they were good though 
Watermelon Panzanella Salad - delicious, tasted fresh and I really enjoyed the watermelon chunks and feta cheese

As far as the beer goes, it may seem high but this is NYC and these are good craft beers. I got the Saison de Banc Vert but my favorite was the L&#39;Herbe a Detourne Dieu du Ciel which is a high gravity abbey tripel! They also have a TON of whiskey and bourbon for those of you that drink that."

I have already professed my love of deep-fried, crispy bird in past reviews, so I won&#39;t go (too much) into it here, but it&#39;s one of the few reasons why I&#39;m always on the brink of becoming vegetarian (that, and bacon). I have yet to come across any suitable substitutes for chicken fingers. Bondurants pairs their version with a fluffy biscuit and honey butter, and despite my better judgment, I ate three pieces and stared longingly at the fourth. 

I wasn&#39;t a fan of the kale salad. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;m a fan of kale salad, in general. The lime-based vinaigrette overpowered everything else, which I suppose was the point, and I wound up rooting around the bowl for the pickled onions and spiced pecans, and stuffing myself silly with the IPA fries. Next time, I am ditching the pretense of being healthy and just getting an order of the chicken tenders for myself. 

Friday night got ear-piercingly loud: We managed to score a table to ourselves, though we had to lean way into each other to shout above the din.  Around 9, the crowd started thinning out, with most of the foot traffic marching towards Two Little Red Hens. You order food and drinks at the bar, which made it a little uncomfortable when the bartender started sidling away each time I took a breath, thinking I had finished, only for me to order two more things. 

NEXT TIME: the burger with pimento cheese on a pretzel bun (dang), the IPA fries (can&#39;t taste the beer at all), and, of course, the chicken tenders.

This place is an absolute beer snob mecca. I wish it were only closer to my neighborhood or job! I would be here way more frequently else-wise. At the time I had come in it was a Ballast Point takeover. A fantastic selection and included many ales from the brewery I had never tried. I remember opting for a Habanero Sculpin - that one took awhile to gulp down but it was awesome on taste and later quenched myself with their Mango Even Keel. The bar was kind enough to offer tiny bites and tapas to the group. I tried a half a taquito and it was pretty tasty. Enjoyed the open door and window atmosphere for summer and spring days. I feel like this place in addition to having great and friendly service by the bartenders also has a craft beer menu of more exotic options that rotate every few days.

The first time, we had ordered the chicken po&#39; boy and the wings. The chicken was a tad dry but I really enjoyed the wings. As far as drinks go, if you don&#39;t love whiskey and craft beer, it&#39;s the sort of place that you would feel really bad asking for a cosmo or a Miller lite. I ordered something off the specialty cocktails menu and ask them to replace the gin with vodka. It was alright but I wasn&#39;t impressed.

Tonight was the second time I came here. We didn&#39;t get food but I did order the spiked cider with applejack. It was AMAZING. If you don&#39;t particularly care for strong alcohol, this is the perfect drink. You barely notice the alcohol in it... and in the chilly weather, it warms you right up!

The bartender gave really good recommendations for whiskey. My boyfriend told him what he liked and he picked out 2 different whiskies, both of which were well received. 5/5 for the bar service and knowledge!

The chicken tenders are ridiculous, come with honey butter, a spicy bbq, and a biscuit. They are perfectly beer battered and a good amount of food.

The tater tots are something like arroncini meets the regular tater tots...melt in your mouth and served with a spicy ranch that&#39;s to die for.

Finally, the pimento burger. Perfectly spiced and rich in flavor, it&#39;s officially made my list of favorites.

I ordered the Nitro Pale Ale, which is a light, creamy beer. It&#39;s also light on EtOH if you - like me - aren&#39;t trying to get hammered off a few rounds of beers. But I digress...on to the food. We ordered: 

IPA fries - Who knew that IPA brined potatoes could taste so good?? For $6, you get a huge bowl that can be shared easily between a group of friends.

Buffalo chicken sliders - Pretty much (boneless) buffalo wings sandwiched between a roll. Nothing special, but 3 per plate means that you can share it amongst friends.

Fried chicken tenders - The chicken was super tender and the seasoning was perfect! It also helped that these came straight out of the deep frier.

Mac &#39;n Cheese - Get it WITH the pork belly. Two extra dollars, but a million times more satisfying. I like the Bondurants&#39; version because it is less cheesy than most. 

The food took longer than I would have liked, but everything was freshly deep fried, so I really have no reason to complain.

If you have been to and like The Penrose, you will probably like Bondurants. Bondurants provides a wide selection of fun cocktails and beer. Decor is brick walls, wooden panels. I really like the layout - they have a circular bar in the middle of the floor that everyone hangs out around. Good for large groups and also with just a few friends.

Service is friendly. This place usually has a good crowd but is never too packed. I came here with a larger group once and we were able to all sit at one of the back tables. Menu is your standard bar food but we ordered a bunch of finger food dishes to share. Good spot to also come to during the day/early evening. Bondurants will be on your short list of good bars to visit in the Upper East."

And I don&#39;t think so. I like gastropubs because each one is different and unique. This one in particular is quaint. I like that the bar is almost a 360 bar and there&#39;s a lot of standing space. 

Came in when it opened and there was even a couple of people in there before they officially opened. haha. Looked at the menu and drinks. They have a very extensive list of whiskeys, which is really nice. They have craft beers and few interesting cocktails. I ordered the Spiked Cider (perfect getaway from the cold). Though my friend and I had to wait awhile for the cider to warm up, which is understandable since they technically just opened. From a small food menu, deciding what to eat was hard. First, we ordered the Boudin Style Meatball Skillet, which was flavorful and delicious. I really like the sauce that it was in too. Then, we both decided and ordered burgers except my friend added with bacon jam. The whole burger was delicious. Moist, juicy, flavorful. MMMM..... Really good.

So the Bacon Jam needs a paragraph by itself because it was HEAVENLY. The alcohol may have gone to my head at the time, but how could you go wrong with bacon? The bacon jam is sweet and salty and quite addicting. So, after finishing our burger, and just finishing up our drinks. I was thinking what would be good with this bacon jam. So, someone came up to the bar and ordered fries (extra cripsy, which I didn&#39;t know that was a thing). And a light bulb lit up. YES, fries. So I asked the bartender if it was possible to do fries with bacon jam, and she&#39;s like I don&#39;t see why not. Yaay!! :D 

GET FRIES WITH BACON JAM. 

We also asked the bartender to recommend a whiskey because we&#39;re not too familiar with whiskeys and the type. Of course, with any alcohol, it&#39;s a personal choice of what you like. So, she asked if we like smokey, dry, spicy types of flavors. We said a nice smokey one would be good. Then she said the campfire, which we took her recommendation. It was good and smooth. 

Our visit here was very pleasant and relaxing. Great staff. I would love to come here for brunch one day, but I am hardly in the Upper East Side. 

Side note: They&#39;re tv&#39;s are hidden behind the chalkboards, which I thought was really neat. Only have them on Sundays, I believe."

All very solid choices. Nothing over the top or exceptional. The drinks, however, are excellent. Any of the whiskey containing cocktails are great. 

Ambiance: It was actually a quiet, slow weeknight save for the area immediately at the bar. We sat at a table bar a few feet away and had an enjoyable time. 

Service: We ate during happy hour, so the only service was via the bartender although there seemed to be a roaming barback/waiter?. My first set of cocktails sat at the bar for while. After about 20 minutes from the time I placed my order, It dawned on me that no one was going to bring them to me. My B.

Bottom line: 3/5. A nice spot for a quick date and a few drinks during happy hour. With so many other places to try in NY, I probably won&#39;t be back for awhile."

I ordered the tator tots, and grilled cheese but when i got home i noticed they gave me fries instead of tots. They were nice enough to say they would put the order in and gave me them for free. luckily I live close by

I know people rave about the fries here but i really didnt love the flavor. Maybe its because i dont like beer, but the IPA flavor just didnt do it for me

the tots were also a unique spin on a tator tot.. .reminded me of a latka.. a fun snack but nothing i would order again as well.

the grilled cheese was on thick cut bread and was really good. think ill stick to that if i ever order from there again.. which i probably will because the wings looked pretty good as well"

We visited this UES spot a weeknight drawn to the great reviews.

When we came in the bar area was pretty packed &amp; tables just clearing.  We grab a little wood booth and sit...

Unfortunately my hunny goes up to the bar &amp; brings a cocktail menu for me to see.  He orders our drinks &amp; the bar and brings them back.  Thank goodness I have a quality man otherwise I would have already left this do it yourself service.

Mine is the mezcal lime drink... On first taste I think it tastes like a BBQ. 

It takes me over 1 1/2 hours to drink my liquid bbq.

We leave a drop even then!  Trust me I do not ever leave a drop of alcohol!

If this place had 1 cocktail server or host they would greatly benefit.  This day &amp; age, customers come first in order to drive revenue.  I guarantee employing a host would even benefit- to share tips with guests &#34;sit anywhere you would like, we are bar service only so feel free to come up &amp; order when you are ready&#34;.

Until they take my suggestion, SIT AT THE BAR to enjoy customer service &amp; interaction."

It&#39;s a cute little place with a southern vibe, a big bar in the centre of the room, which is where you order your food (no table service), and the clientele at the time we went seemed mostly local and very millennial.

We got the pimento burger, tater tots, chicken fingers, and the smoked wings. Everything was great, the wings were the best (loved them). I would skip the chicken fingers and get the kale salad (or something else, it&#39;s a great menu) next time. The meat is all sourced from local farms (as per the menu) and there was a great selection of craft beers on tap (I had a ginger cider and my husband had Chanukah in Kentucky He&#39;Brew)

Food 
- 3 stars for the food - decent gastropub options but a little on the bland side. We had the avocado toast, tater tot skillet, and chicken tenders from their brunch menu.
- Each were decent but felt like it was missing something.
- Beer selection was really good with all the different options available on tap - better than the food itself.

Service
- Must order at the bar as there is no table service ... But I wish someone would let you know that the moment you walk in so you don&#39;t stand around awkwardly.
- Ordering at the bar would be fine if the bartenders were actually attentive and not just hanging out with their friends.. Not sure what was going on today - maybe it was the female bartenders birthday or something, but all of her friends sitting around the bar seem to be the only ones grabbing her attention, while the rest of us seated at the tables that were trying to place orders with her at the bar took a back seat - seemed super unprofessional when she spent more time taking photos of her cake and speaking at obnoxious levels than acknowledging patrons... even for this laid back environment.
- Not asking for much here except to be acknowledged especially if the directions are to order at the bar.. The bussers were even hustling and acknowledging people more than the bartenders. 
- 1 star for service - this is NOT for the bartender as there wasn&#39;t any service provided by her, but at least a star for the bussers busting their butts around the whole room instead."

There is a varied selection of whiskey &amp; craft beers.
With no wait service, you do have to order everything at the bar which isn&#39;t ideal for date night or if you want to feel spoiled, but for casually chilling it works for a perfect day/night out.

The blue cheese burger on a pretzel bun was very flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium and the IPA fries made a great side/appetizer. The portion of the fries is pretty huge- more than enough for two and with a beer or whiskey - hits just the spot :)

The fried chicken tenders were only decent. The crisp on them was just right but could have used some more seasoning or favors. Maybe a dipping sauce would&#39;ve made all the difference.

Overall, this UES joint has a good vibe and yummy American/bar food and I would definitely give there other items; burgers, sliders, sides another taste!"

BF and I arrived about 3 minutes before their 4pm opening time on a Saturday. Staff totally ignored us as we walked in and we were like...okay..well they&#39;re not open for another 3 minutes so we&#39;ll leave them alone. We sat at the bar and waited. 4:10 rolls around and we still haven&#39;t been spoken to, I&#39;m getting angry because I see two bartender/waitresses talking to each other and totally ignoring us. Finally, one comes over to take our order. Scarecity beer, IPA fries, sliders and a burger were ordered for the two of us. 

FYI - throughout the order and the remainder of the meal I found the bartender/waitress to be very rude. She barely made eye contact with the patrons, was throwing menus at people and being very abrupt in conversation. Frankly, it left a sour taste in my mouth. 

The food came out PIPING hot, I kept burning myself as I ate it. After waiting a sufficient amount of time, I found that it wasn&#39;t that great.

Bondurants is an awesome new bar addition in the area! Super craft beer selection that rotates weekly. Superlative whiskey list. Some terrific house cocktails to choose from along with a small eclectic food list. Inviting rustic decor with cool rock music playing. A more adult mixed crowd that flies in the face of the frat boy clientele in the area. How did this wonderful place happen to show up here and not in Brooklyn or the LES?

Oh, that&#39;s right! Because the UES/Yorkville part of town is starting to explode with great bars and restaurants all over! Once the 2nd Ave subway is finished this will become the hot spot of town to eat and drink at even more so. For those of us who live up here we know this is the &#34;undiscovered country&#34; with many gems that those who refuse to venture above 14th street even know about. That&#39;s ok, because we like it that way. I don&#39;t even have to leave my hood anymore to have a great beer, quality cocktail, or tasty meal. 

Yorkville: The final frontier. To explore strange new bars, to seek out new restaurants and new gathering spots, to boldly go where no man has partied before! (as narrated by William Shatner as Captain Kirk)

The whiskey list here is pure quality with so many to choose from. From Makers 46 to Elijah Craig to Larceny to Rough Rider and more. Impressive! I can walk in at any time and enjoy a creamy Nitro Stout brew or sample any of the beers on their board until I find one I like. Terrific bartenders here who are friendly and will offer top notch selections when you are on the fence about what you want to drink. 

Hungry? Try the Frickles or Roasted Almonds to nosh on. Their seasoned IPA Fries are addicting! They are perfect to go along with a beer or cocktail. Oh, the cocktails are fine! The Maggie Valley and Take It Easy Baby will surely cure what ails ya.  

Large octagon shaped bar centers the room with some tables and window seating around it. Spacious and can get a bit crowded as the locals have taken to this spot, but always a space to hang your hat. Pure inviting ambiance that makes me want to call this my new neighborhood bar home. This ain&#39;t your grandparent&#39;s Upper East Side anymore. Love it!"

The highlight of the visit to Bonduraunts was their killer french fries! The owner explained that their fries are hand cut, soaked in IPA and twice fried. They are Perfectly seasoned and crispy.

The order/context: Came for Sunday brunch with 2 other people, ordered the IPA fries, deviled eggs, breakfast tacos, and chicken tenders.

The food: The IPA fries (5/5) are popular for a reason - they&#39;re fantastic, even for brunch! They give a ton though, so carb watchers beware. Chicken Tenders (4/5) come right after the fries in terms of quality - well seasoned, not oily, and you can tell its a house recipe. The breakfast tacos are a satisfying, but also feel lacking - they could use one of two extra ingredients to give them a better kick (3.5/5). The deviled eggs were beautiful, but we&#39;re pretty average taste wise (3.5/5). 

The service: The bartend is friendly and attentive while you&#39;re ordering, but I had to remind him twice to check up on an order that took ~20 min to come out. (3.5/5)

The ambience: Very relaxed and comfortable! The centralized bar makes the bartends very important, so there is some possible struggle with getting their attention when it gets busy (4/5)"

-Craft beer and bourbon. Seriously, what could be better? My two favorite things. And Bondurants doesn&#39;t dissapoint on either front.

-I came here on a date (it went well, as I&#39;m sure all of you were anxious to know). I&#39;d say that this bar is better-suited for happy hour/larger gatherings as it gets pretty crowded and loud, but because we came relatively early (around 6:30), we were able to get a table no problem. If you want to get a table here, your best bet is to come earlier rather than later (at least on a weeknight - that&#39;s my only frame of reference)

-The bartenders were knowledgable, friendly and all together wonderful. I&#39;m a whiskey drinker myself so that was my focus for the night. I like to try the more esoteric brands at whiskey bars given that I&#39;ve tried all the usuals (Basil Hayden&#39;s, etc.) so I gave the bartender a short list of my go-tos. She recommended two kinds and I ended up trying both. Not only were they both delicious, she hit the nail on the head in terms of flavor. My favorite of the night was Town Branch Rye (her first suggestion). I&#39;m picky about ryes, but man, was this good.

-Though it got packed at certain points, the ambiance here was great. Had a very organic (and no I don&#39;t mean kale and quinoa craze organic) feel. Pretty bare bones decor but it felt homey and relaxed. 

-Lastly, everyone around me was raving about the food. We didn&#39;t get any ourselves so I have nothing to report on that front, but the couple next to us ordered fries that looked, smelled - and i suspect tasted - delectable."

The meat was juicy and the cheese was perfectly melted. Fries were thick cut and also very yummy. One portion is good enough for 2.

Tables are on a first come first serve basis so don&#39;t expect reservations. Ordering is atthe bar too.

I would recommend this as a good place to catch up with friends or to grab a bite after working out. Nice atmosphere, not too busy. 

Wouldn&#39;t recommend as date night spot though."

There is no table service at the restaurant, so you must order from the bartenders. Because it is a small place, this never seems to present any problems.

I&#39;ve heard the IPA fries are to die for, but I&#39;ve never tried them (next time!). The classic burger on the pretzel bun is my favorite. The bun really makes such a difference in the taste of the burger, and leaves me wanting more from every burger I try elsewhere!

If you&#39;re looking for a casual, low-key spot with better-than-average bar food, Bondurants is an excellent choice (whether it is during the week, or on the weekend.)"

I&#39;ve watched on many occassions, the waitress (who ignores customers) eat a banana behind the bar, and then make a cocktail that involves touching fruits etc, without washing her hands. They also shovel french fries etc into their faces behind the bar. They call it a break for a reason. On a break, you eat your food away from customers and wash your hands after.

Surveying your surroundings: exposed brick, stacked bar (alcohol of all sorts, beers on tap) food was present.  They had a variety of hand crafted cocktails on the menu, many featuring my favorite alcohol/pasttime: whiskey.

Prices were reasonable for NY (and upper east), and ambiance was great - quite a few double dates that looked to be going well, and NY ladies catching up and sharing tinder date stories.  I would definitely go back."

Wait, wait, wait. 

A gastropub with exposed brick, pressed tin ceilings, a great craft beer list, bourbon, and Southern food in the UES? Yessss.

I&#39;ve been here twice - once for drinks and once for brunch. The crowd really wasn&#39;t so different between the two times(lots of twenty and thirty-somethings with a mix of older couples) and it just seemed like a really great neighborhood gastropub. It wasn&#39;t uncomfortably crowded either time, and we were able to find seats at the open, large, octagon bar both times. Bartenders were friendly, laid-back, and quite attentive. It didn&#39;t give off as much of a swanky, romantic vibe as The Penrose (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-penrose-new-york?hrid=sHoyeMDlNyHaOL1ssJRTWQ) did, but I think it&#39;s still a great place for a date or for conversations with friends. 

There&#39;s a rotating craft beer list, an impressive bourbon list, and a creative cocktail list sure to make anyone&#39;s mouth water. You know what else will activate the salivary glands? The food. For brunch, we shared a large bowl of IPA Fries that were thick-cut fries in a Lagunitas IPA brine with a smattering of salt, pepper, and herbs. Whether dunked in ketchup or not, these were a great accompaniment to drinks. The Sausage Gravy consisted of savory gravy with ground sausages over two biscuits with eggs on top. It was delicious, but I&#39;d have to say the Fried Chicken Tenders ranked a tad higher. Four huge chunks of chicken tenders came on the plate; all were juicy, tender, and covered in a thin layer of crunchy batter. I appreciated the thinness of the batter and the ease with which they could be bitten into. The &#34;sassy sauce&#34; was so delicious. I wanted to bottle that up!


Likelihood of another visit:
Very likely! They had an awesome manatee bottle holder on display, and I&#39;d love to ask them about it. And try their chicken tenders again, of course. Like the girl with the annoying voice a few seats away said to her fiancé, &#34;No babe, you have to get the chicken tenders. Nooo, the chicken tenders. You have to get them. Are you crazy? Wait, are you kidding me?&#34;"

We sampled a few different beers - I like that they come in 12-oz pours, so you can try a few without feeling too full.  This past Sunday they had a delicious pumpkin beer on tap - Pumpkinfest - which I tried, plus a nice witte.  We didn&#39;t stay for a full meal but tried the pimpento cheese spread and IPA fries.  The fries were completely delicious; I couldn&#39;t really taste the beer but they were served hot and greasy, exactly how I love to consume potatoes.  The cheese was okay but kind of chunky and they only gave us 4 crackers, which was definitely not enough for the amount of cheese.  Still, I&#39;m definitely going 4 stars here, and if you&#39;re looking for a great spot to camp out for the rest of football season, particularly if you live on the UES, you could do a lot worse."

He commented on how he felt like people here are trying to pretend like it&#39;s cool to be Southern...OK. Anyway, I just thought it was a cool bar. 

What I did think was interesting was when he then started to educate me on the Bondurant family being a famous bootlegging family from rural Virginia during the Prohibition area. I was like &#34;Oh wait! There&#39;s this movie with Shia Labeouf. What is it?? Oh yea, Lawless!&#34; Wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the movie, but def made me appreciate the concept of the bar.

Really like the chill, woody decor. Was able to grab a seat at one of the booths on a Friday night and was pretty comfortable. Crowd also seemed like they were all there to have a beer an enjoy themselves without going too crazy.

Beer selection is broad and varied. They have an interesting beer here for whatever you&#39;re in the mood for. Light? Full-bodied? Sour? They got a beer for ya. I did try a cocktail here of which the selection is smaller and the drink was wayyy too sweet for my taste. C&#39;mon, if we are going Prohibition area I&#39;m not expected a cocktail that is so sweet that it feel like I need a dentist appointment ASAP. 

Overall, good place and I&#39;d good again."

This place has a great selection of craft beers, many of which I had never even heard of, but was willing to try new ones. Our group ordered the IPA fries, which weren&#39;t as flavorful as the &#34;soaked in IPA-brine&#34; description might attest, but the portion size was generous for the price ($6). Overall, they were good quality fries (on the thicker side). 

Most of my party was happy with the drinks they ordered. Keep in mind, we came here at a reasonable hour (5:30-6) on a Saturday, so I have no idea how busy it gets during prime time or how the service is when it&#39;s packed. Their burgers also looked very appetizing."

Probably wouldn&#39;t hurt for them to have an extra bartender behind the bar.  Service was a little slow, but the bartender was super nice and helped us as quickly as he could.

On a Wednesday afternoon (but it is the day before a national holiday) it was quite crowded and we ended up waiting about 15 minutes.

The ramen bowls are $10-12 and during lunch hours, you can add an appetizer for $3. I thought the ramen was great - wish there was more stuff in it and they definitely skimp on the bok choy, but other than that, I don&#39;t have any complaints. The food was well priced for the portion sizes.

Service is so quick. Our server is probably the same cute energetic lady everyone has been talking about. She is adorable and checks up on you very often - honestly I&#39;d go back just for her.

The atmosphere is relaxed and feels true to Japan. I would take friends here if I lived in the area, but no more than a party of 3. Prices are about $10-12 a bowl. 

We stopped by for a late lunch on a weekend, and we were seated immediately. Opted for the bar seating as I feel like it&#39;s the appropriate thing to do when you&#39;re just eating ramen. They have hooks underneath for your bag. Seating is limited (it&#39;s a small place), but I can&#39;t imagine the wait time being anything crazy like the big name ramen spots. Japanese folks do eat here, which adds to the authentic feel. 

Ordered 2 ramen, the Kakuni and the Veggie ramen. It&#39;s a filling and satisfying portion. Also, less stressful than a trip to Ippudo or Ichiran (works for me!). I replaced the pork slices with chicken. Bad move, because they give you thick chicken breast slices and it felt clunky/out of place in the Kakuni. Probably would have been better to opt for all veggie substitutes, since the chicken didn&#39;t taste that good either. The veggie ramen is soy milk based. I haven&#39;t found many places that pull that off well. Also, the tomato topping felt odd. Next time, better to stick with the Kakuni ramen. I did like the bowl that the veggie ramen came in, though! We also ordered a side of chili oil. It&#39;s enough to share between 3-4 people (or 2 if you&#39;re looking to drench the ramen in that).

They have cup/can sized sake and a free kae-dama promo during late hours. Makes me feel like it&#39;s a good late night talk/eat kinda spot."

Both the ramen (their basic chicken/pork broth ramen) and the homemade fried gyosa pork dumplings smelled rank &amp; gamey, as if they had used old meats.  

After passing by the restaurant several times over the last few weeks and seeing it packed with Japanese customers (always a good sign for a ramen place), I decided to give it another try.  

This time, I ordered several items: their base ramen, grilled chicken wings, pork bun, fried chicken bun and grilled beef ribs.  

Ramen was worse than I remembered.  The soup smelled even more rank and gamey.  The thick pork slices were chewy and sweet, and not in a pleasant way.  The cold raw onions did little to mask the terrible smell of the soup.  I left the rest of the dish uneaten.

Chicken wings smelled so foul that I spat out as soon as I put a bite in my mouth and cleaned my tongue with a slice of lime.  I left the rest of the dish uneaten.

Grilled beef ribs smelled old and bloody.  In fact, they smelled like foul-smelling old liver bits.  I left the rest of the dish uneaten.

The only decent items were the buns but the foul taste of the other food items made me so queasy that I couldn&#39;t enjoy them.  

This is by far the worst ramen place I have ever tried in my 30 years of living and working in Manhattan.  And I have experienced a few bad ones in my lifetime.  

I honestly don&#39;t understand how this place manages to attract so many customers."

I think my previous visit at Ichiran guarantee my bias against this place. 
First of all, after eating Ichiran, I felt all ramen place in Manhattan sucks...
sorry that I gave bad reviews.

Location: very far from subway station, and a local hot spot for ramen, Nishida sho-ten is very easy to be found due to the familiarity of few japanese character I knew. Inside, the place is tiny: 5 tables and a long table where you can interact with bartender.

Place is immersed with japanese pictures.

Food: get their black ramen. in fact, the soup isn&#39;t black at all. However, the meat is not cooked well. Why? The meat doesn&#39;t preserve its richness. The soup is okay. The straight noodle is mediocre but still maintain its high level of chewiness.

However, the good part is that their portion is huge. 

If you are hungry, close to the areas, this is a great spot for some ramen craving 

Price: average ramen is 10 dollars.
They also have fried ramen for dinner only.
Appetizer as well.

Overall: 3 stars COMPARED TO Ichiran.
still worth a visit .

There&#39;s only a few 4 top tables and a handful of 2 tops, and then a usual wraparound ramen bar. Yelp noted this place a cash bar but we found out that you can use a credit card if over $20. 

Their menu selection was very nice- I&#39;m not a ramen expert but I thought their version of vegetable ramen included a lot of little usual things that made it special- a hint of coconut milk and many different kinds of veggies served with a lime wedge (nice touch!). They also have their famous black ramen soup- my friend got this and really liked it. I got the traditional miso ramen and thought it tasted great and appreciated that fact that it came automatically with corn and hard boiled egg that Totto charges extra for. The &#34;homemade chili oil&#34; side for $1 wasn&#39;t as spicy as I expected however and thought it wasn&#39;t really worth the dollar; you and a friend could share one of these if you really need it...

My friend ordered the miso ramen and I ordered the fried chicken over rice with curry. The fried chicken had a nice crunch and went well with the curry. It also didn&#39;t taste oily - which is always a plus when I eat fried chicken.

They had a sign saying that noodles refills after 11pm are free. Definitely take advantage of this if you&#39;re around the area after 11pm!!"

It&#39;s a very small place, so I advise coming on non-peak hours. Luckily we were able to grab a table for 4 at 6pm on a Wednesday evening. But afterwards the place started to get packed, about a half hour later. 

I had the kimchi, two onigiri balls, and the yaki ramen. Both myself and my friends all enjoyed our food. Delicious and average price for ramen. Drink prices are a tad on the high side though. The staff were polite, though a bit understaffed I think, as it took a while for our food to arrive. But it was a solid ramen place overall and I would absolutely come back."

I arrived to NYC late on a Friday night and this ramen establishment was located near by my hotel. Score. Ramen &amp; sake at 1:00AM? Let me just pretend I&#39;m in Tokyo really quick. 

Nishida Sho-ten is pretty small, but we arrived right before the rush and scored three seats at the bar area. Service was friendly, fast, and efficient. There&#39;s a $20 minimum on credit cards, so plan accordingly. 
They had a deal for a sake flight, which provided three cans(?) of sake for $18. The waiter thought I was going to share the sake - a can for each person - but in reality they were all for me. Oops. 

So, here&#39;s where the 3 star rating comes in. The ramen. I ordered the black kakuni ramen. The noodles and pork belly were great. I love thin noodles and these were prepared just right. However, the broth left me disappointed. It was more on the salty side and there just wasn&#39;t much complexity to it. I&#39;ve had my fair share of ramen and tonkotsu broth, but this just didn&#39;t do it for me. 
I will say that the price point was a thumbs up though! 

I&#39;m glad I tried this place out, but I probably won&#39;t be back with there being so many other ramen options in the city."

It&#39;s a little bit of a rat-hole (to quote my dad) but they know how to make good ramen. The ramen is spicy and way, way too much to eat. I have not yet tackled an entire bowl. I haven&#39;t tried anything else on their menu, but the size of their $11 ramen comes fast enough and is more than enough food to make me completely uninterested in appetizers. They have a wide range of sakes in cute little glass cups but unfortunately, you have to go 3-4 down the list before they actually have one in stock."

Thanks to my Dad&#39;s interest in Japanese culture, I&#39;ve honestly been eating ramen for the past 20 years, before the craze hit, before most of my friends even knew what ramen was. I was SO happy when ramen took it&#39;s rightful place in the food trend world because it is so much better now than it ever was.

So, I&#39;ve been to 10 different ramen places in the past few months... and many more before I started this list... And as of now, Nishida is my FAVORITE. I&#39;ve only been here once before 1am... so I can&#39;t say much for the other menu items. But the RAMEN is just SO good. I LOVE THE BROTH. And the portion size! And the level of spicyness. I finish the whole bowl every time even after eating a takoyaki app. 

Furthermore, I love that this place is small and relatively unknown. I love that it&#39;s open late. I love the guy that works behind the bar late night. I love the poster in the bathroom and how seemingly lazy the servers are. I think this place is really great! And I&#39;ve only come to appreciate more now that I&#39;ve been on my ramen tour. 

Way to go Nishida! So far my only 5 star review on the ramen list. I&#39;ll be seeing you soon!"

Nishida Shoten was one of the only few that showed up. One problem was the transportation but we found that it was close to a subway line so success! 

The restaurant itself is quite warm in temperature but that was perfect because it was a cold night in NYC. Coat racks are available throughout the restaurant and you can choose to sit at the bar or at a table. The restaurant had a Japanese feel to it and having recently come back from Japan, it made me feel like I had never left. There were masks of all characters shown throughout the restaurant as decor and being a collector of masks myself, that was the cherry on top. 

The service was quick and attentive and although the food took a while, the environment made up for it. It&#39;s not a noisy restaurant either so the ambience was very relaxing and felt cozy. 

I ordered the chicken ramen with added Bok choy and straight Noodles (around 12$ in total). My boyfriend ordered the miso ramen with wavy Noodles. Having tried both, I prefer the miso with wavy Noodles. The soup base is thicker and more rich with the Noodles being thicker as well. I definitely recommend it. The chicken ramen had a salty soup base so I wasn&#39;t much of a fan. 

After 11pm, you can have an order of extra Noodles for free which was great. That&#39;s always appreciated. 

Overall, it was a perfect ending to my night. I&#39;m so glad I stumbled upon this restaurant and I will definitely be back!"

I tried the very popular black kakuni and it was absolutely amazing.  The ambiance is actually really good for a small hole in the wall type place.  The service is fast and friendly.  Did I mention that they serve saki?  What more could you ask for?  I will definitely come back.

I ordered the White Kakuni Ramen and my friend ordered the Black Kakuni Ramen (the only difference is the black one has garlic mayu sauce). Both were very good: the white was lighter (which I prefer) and the black was a bit more savory. The egg was AMAZING and the pork was pretty good (the fattier parts were better). They also have spicy tan tan ramen which I definitely want to try in the future. 

We also ordered the pork buns and those were decent, but not the best I&#39;ve had. They added a tomato which I wasn&#39;t a fan of (not even a thin slice, a chunky tomato...) I&#39;ll probably try another appetizer next time as they had an extensive list of relatively cheap options :)

Tables inside are tiny and seats are tiny but the atmosphere inside is good other than blast of cold air you get when door opens. 

My friend tried the black ramen and I had the spicy miso ramen. I have been trying all of the ramen in the city and this one was great! I def recommend it. Prices were 10$ for black ramen and 13$ for spicy miso which is average for Manhattan. They have some drinks on menu with avg rest prices as well nothing special.

I would call their Ramen really tiered-1 Ramen place among all great Ramen places in NYC. 

Place is very small - but cozy. Not fancy at all - but with playing perfect volume of Japanese music, and all the Japanese posters attaching on the wall makes this place feels pretty authentic, like you are in Japan.

I passed by location on Sunday, little passed Lunch time like 3:30PM. They don&#39;t have break time between Lunch and Dinner so it&#39;s pretty easy to go to place anytime you want. It wasn&#39;t crowded at all so I sat on the bar, ordered their signature Black Kakuni Ramen. Staffs were very nice and very attentive.

As soon as I received my Ramen. I could smell strong scent of garlic comes from Mayu(Black Garlic) Oil. Sesame and Mayu makes great combination witgh their rich broth on your parate. Broth could be heavy for someone yet if you have no problem with broth from Totto then this should be alright as well. Kakuni were cooked perfectly and diced onion is perfect finishing to give little refresh touch on this broth. If you&#39;re a garlic lover- like me- then this is perfect bowl of noodle soup for you. Even though color of soup isn&#39;t pleasant and bit darker compared to common Ramen, it doesn&#39;t salty too much. 

Noodle was perfectly cooked as well - with tender inside and solid outside, and this wavy noodle make great compound with their rich broth. Toppings were prepped perfectly. It was really great bowl of joy. I enjoyed every bite with this noodle. 

Amazingly their price is lower than other places. Which gives another reason for them to being great. Great service/great food/great ambiance with great price? You cannot ask anymore.

Loved this place, surely coming back again..again and again...and again."

My bf &amp; I came to NY on vacation and I did my research and it seemed like Momofoku noodle bar was thee place to go for ramen, so we did what any &#34;toursit&#34; would do, and we had our first ramen at Momofoku. It was a bit of a dissapointment, and unfortunately it didn&#39;t satisfy my noodle cravings, so the next day we decided to check out Ippudo. Ippudo was INSANELY busy and the wait time was over an hour and 30 min.... So we were like screw that, we hangry... Some way, somehow by the power of the ramen gods we ended up at Nishida. We took a glance at the menu and noticed how it wasn&#39;t too busy, so we decided to go for it! I&#39;m so HAPPY that we did! Literally the best ramen I had in my existence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The manager was really realy rude and didn&#39;t allow me to sit down, even though the place was empty. It is one thing to have certain rules, which I respect, but the rudeness is inexcusable.

Regarding the food - below average.  Broth was way too salty. Noodles were ok in consistency. But this was really bad- there was a bug in my food. Maybe this is why they didn&#39;t want me to eat in!

 The soup here is soooooo good, especially the pork broth. I ordered the Black Kakuni Ramen, which is your typical pork soup flavored with black garlic oil. In less that 5 minutes my order came out. Great service my good man!! My waiter was gracious and very courteous, and I watched with amazement how quickly he handled 4 different tables including mine without missing a beat.

The deco is so cute that one can easily imagine herself eating ramen somewhere in Tokyo. I rarely go out for ramen to be honest. Home cooked instant ramen can be quickly made and taste even better. Yet, since the friend from Niagira Falll insisted, here we were and I had no regret. I got Black Kakuni Ramen (this is new, haven&#39;t seen this anywhere else). My friends got Vegetable Ramen and Miso Ramen. As usual, LESS SALT and THICKER BROTH (this&#39; Cali thing, most NYC places can&#39;t do this but I still ask anyways) please. Can&#39;t believe my eyes, they have home made sauce and spices on the every tables (vinegar, dry fried garlic, chili, etc)! Wow, this&#39; how you tell if the restaurant is serious about whatever food they are about to offer. I can&#39;t wait to slurp that ramen down. JK, no slurping anywhere in the States I know~ As expected, we were very satisfied with the ramen. I especially liked the vegie ramen that contained extra flavor from the coconut milk.

I split a bowl of the black kakuri noodle with my friend and we had the extra side of noodle be extra firm. I&#39;d say the normal firmness and extra firm is nearly the same. The noodles are thin so I actually preferred them to be extra firm. Meat was tender and the broth was well flavored, not too salty. Egg is soft boiled just right.

In any case, this store is small but very authentic feeling. They play Japanese music and have low-key traditional decorations on the walls. It&#39;s dimly lit. 

I tried the White Kakuni ramen, which is a heavier broth, and I chose the straight thin noodles. It came with a soft-boiled egg and nori. Really delicious. After 11pm, you apparently get a bowl of free noodles for free. Yes, they are really open until 4am!

My friend got the Tan Tan Noodles, which is mildly spicy. I have to say that this was the best Tan Tan I&#39;ve had in New York so far. Quite impressive, both in the texture of the noodles, and the flavor of the broth.

I ordered the black ramen and had pan fried dumplings. The dumplings were surprisingly good. Crispy on the bottom and chewy on the inside. 

The ramen on the other hand was very underwhelming. The broth was missing so much flavor that I&#39;m usually use to. The broth was also very thin, almost watery, and very oily! The restaurant also gave very little noodles to me in the bowl. I ordered extra to feel full.

I got the tan tan noodles this time around as the the spicy chili oil drew me in. The noodles were plentiful, wavy and al dente which was nice. The soup was slightly on the thicker side which I appreciated as well. Although it looked to have plenty of flavor, I found it be just okay, maybe a bit oily. It could have been from the chili oil but unfortunately the chili didn&#39;t contribute any spice to it so nothing was enhanced. The quality was fine, I guess I was just hoping for something with alittle more punch.

The place is pretty authentic and I never heard of it.  I was in the area and needed something quick and easy for lunch and this was it.

The service here is very no frills.  It&#39;s basically a  place where you eat and go.  I can imagine it gets really busy during lunch time during the work week.  The place is also pretty small so if you&#39;re going to come here, come here during off peak hours.

My miso ramen was good, but nothing special.  It didn&#39;t wow me, but it did satisfy my ramen craving.  The only thing I didn&#39;t like about it was the large amounts of chopped onions.

White Kakuni - this ramen had huge chunks of braised pork.  The pork was more like the texture of chinese roast pork in bite and thickness.  If you like that kind of pork, then you will like this.  It&#39;s definitely not the melt in your mouth kind.

Overall, this place is pretty solid for the neighborhood.  I probably won&#39;t be back since there are other ramen spots I like more/want to try."

It was apparently still lunch time so we received the lunch menu which has a set deal of any ramen + choice of appetizer for an extra $3: gyoza, mini curry with karaage, pork bowl, or spicy cod roe (I think). 
We ordered the black kakuni + gyoza and white kakuni + mini curry.
Both ramens were tasty, but like other reviewers have said, the black kakuni is more peppery and garlicky. I don&#39;t think it was overwhelming at all in garlic flavor. The white kakuni is more of the classic broth. I really liked both.
As for the gyoza, I really liked the tetsunabe look of it but it fell pretty flat in terms of crispiness and flavor. The pork flavor actually was slightly off so I had to dip it in the mini curry to hide that weird flavor. And the curry was just standard, but unfortunately didn&#39;t come out really hot like I wanted. There was also only like 2 or 3 tiny chicken pieces that end up getting soggy really fast. So -1 star for the apps.

The service was great. There was only one lady working and she was checking up on everyone (total of only maybe 7 people or so). She was the cutest and friendliest server ever! I want to go again just to hear her bubbly sayings.
The ramen does NOT come out as fast as Ippudo or Totto (Ippudo is just freakishly fast though). But it doesn&#39;t take too long, and personally, I think it&#39;s a little weird when my food comes out in 2 minutes.
The bill was around $35 (after tip &amp; 18%) tax for two people. Not bad.

Dont waste your time with other dishes. For a $10 bowl you get alot of noodle and broth. I also ordered an extra egg and slow cooked pork belly topping. Total per bowl of Ramen was $15.  Very quick service. It was delicious. I thought the broth was better than Ippudo NY on 4th Ave. I had them both on the same day. Lunch at Ippudo NY and dinner here. This place is open till 4am. Great spot to swing by after a night out. After 11pm you can ask for an extra serving of Noodle for Free. 
It&#39;s definitely a hole in the wall. Very small restaurant but very cozy. I went for dinner here on a Sat around 9pm and there was no waiting. They will accept credit cards for orders over $20 but won&#39;t split the check. 

Cons: Host/Waitress is lazy. She didn&#39;t want to ask her manager or chef for the price of a bowl of rice on the side. She just lied to the customers face and said it&#39;s &#34;6 or 7 dollars&#34; so she wouldn&#39;t have to put in the order. That&#39;s some bowl of rice. 

Other dishes we ordered were somewhat disappointing.  Pork bun (see photo) wasn&#39;t that great. It had this massive slice of tomato in it. Octopus in Wasabi sauce wasn&#39;t great. 

Just get Ramen!"

The broth is complex and flavorful, the noodles perfectly chewy, and the hunks of pork thrown in mean business.

My friend ordered the miso ramen plus the &#34;small&#34; curry dish that you can add on for $3 (I put that in quotes because their small curry is a full meal for me). For a kid with a bottomless stomach, this place is golden.

I really like ramen places that aren&#39;t overly hyped, so this one hit the spot in terms of ambiance. Now the food is a whole other story (a great one). Affordable, delicious, authentic, lasting taste. There&#39;s really nothing negative that can be said about Nishida Sho-ten.

The ramen noodles are al-dente to just the right degree, broth is rich and flavorful, the toppings are tastefully chosen, meat is tender and soaks in the broth, and as usual, the egg melts in your mouth. 10/10 great bowl of ramen.

On a side note, the Gyoza appetizer is the best I&#39;ve ever had (I really love Japanese food, and despite never having been to Japan, I do appreciate good gyoza when I see it). They are supposedly homemade, paired very well with a slightly-sour slightly-sweet tare (dipping sauce). Unfortunately, the Takoyaki leaves a little to be desired, but it is more than made up for by the rest of the meal.

Best part: the price. House Special Black Kakuni Ramen is only $11.

Recommendation: Black Kakuni Ramen (MUST GET!!!!), Gyoza (might as well get like 4 of these... they are so good)"

This has become my go-to ramen spot, even with Totto a few blocks away. Yes, it&#39;s a small place, but we never have to wait too long. 

What I love is that you have a choice of chicken or pork and of wavy or straight noodles. I prefer chicken, and most ramen places are so heavily into the pork. The broths are flavorful. I especially love the miso ramen because it comes with everything I&#39;d want- egg, corn, bok choy, sprouts, and more-- and then I often add chili oil on the side.

Speaking of on the side, they have a box full of more condiments than I&#39;ve seen anywhere, on every table- sesame seeds, sirarcha, soy sauce, sesame oil, togarashi, vinegar, pepper, and a few other things I can&#39;t remember. 

As far as appetizers, I don&#39;t know how they make their dumplings, but they are always SO crispy and good. The ribs are tasty too, but often very fatty.

The servers have been helpful with recommendations and questions, and friendly every time I go. Also, If you like sake, (it&#39;s not my thing) there&#39;s a lot to choose from, and they even offer flights. Overall, ramen prices are better here than most places at $11 for most.

I look forward to also trying it late night one of these days, and enjoying the free double noodles ;)"

As a visitor in NY, one of the things I love about it is how many awesome late night options there are. When I found out there was a ramen shop that closed at 4 am, I had to come try it.

My bf and I shared the garlic black ramen and added an extra order of egg. Since we came after 11 pm, we also got a huge extra serving of noodles. This makes it perfect to share for two people without getting overly stuffed before bedtime. 

The broth was delicious with great flavor and the thin noodles soaked all of that up really well. The egg was perfect - still yolky in the middle just the way I like it. The meat was also super tender and the chunks were pretty big! I was really impressed.

To top all of this off, base price for the ramen with extra noodles was only $11. The extra egg costed us only $1.5. If you&#39;re looking for an affordable ramen shop with quality/authentic food, this is definitely a place to stop by."

I was surprised that this place was so packed at 2 in the morning, but my friend and I were lucky to get seats at the bar. The service was great and our waiter was very attentive. 

When it comes to finding good ramen in the city, this place is THE spot. You can&#39;t get more real than this place. I haven&#39;t been to too many ramen spots, but this place really blew me away. I highly recommend the chicken ramen and the pork ramen. Both blew me away. We also had the pork dumplings to start and they were some of the BEST dumplings I&#39;ve ever had. Super fresh and crispy. This place really pays attention to what their making and you can tell they put heart and soul in to making the most authentic Japanese ramen for he folks of NYC.

We ordered the chicken ramen and their signature pork ramen, with chicken ramen being wavy noodle and pork one being straight. I wish we could choose the type of noodle as I&#39;m not a huge fan of wavy noodle (reminded me of instant noodle cooked at home). Our waitress was extremely helpful and always checking on us.

I&#39;ve been here many times and the ramen never disappoints. Stopped by on a Monday evening for dinner, and the line was 15 minutes for party of two. The place is fairly small with seating capacity for about 20 between the tables and counter; I don&#39;t suggest coming here with more than 4 people). The service was quick and friendly.

As for the food, we started by sharing a takoyaki ($5 for 6 pieces) and had the black kakuni ramen and the tan tan ramen ($11 each). The outside of each takoyaki ball with sauce drizzled on top was just the right amount of crispy while the batter inside was creamy. I was pleasantly surprised by how much octopus bits were inside each takoyaki ball.

If you like garlic, the black kakuni ramen is an easy call. The broth is rich, but not overly salty. Mayu (black garlic) oil is used to really enhance the roasted flavors of garlic and sesame and you&#39;ll find yourself drinking the broth long after the noodles are gone! And as with other ramens on the menu, you have the choice of wavy or straight noodles and pork or chicken topping (I went with wavy and pork). The wavy noodles were cooked al dente and the fatty chunks of pork (3 pieces) are tender and slightly sweet. It&#39;s accompanied by half a perfectly soft-boiled egg (not fully cooked but not runny either) and some bok choy and onions. It could have used more bok choy, but you can always add more as an additional topping. Overall, the portion is spot-on and leaves you satisfied, but not too full.

I&#39;ve had the tan tan ramen on previous visits and would recommend it if you&#39;re in the mood for something spicy. Also, while we didn&#39;t have it this time, I also recommend the chicken karaage (served with spicy mayo for dipping) as an appetizer!"

Noodles here are perfectly chewy (I always pick wavy over straight)  and the broth is hearty and full. Excellent dish for a for a chilly or wintry evening; warms your soul right up! Ingredients are portioned well and not overwhelming. Egg was on point: boiled on the outside, soft in the yolk. I do feel like 2 pieces of pork is a little on the skimpy side but that&#39;s a minor complaint. 

I don&#39;t find this to be AMAZING, but it is an undeniably great option for a quick, inexpensive meal on a cold night. Service is on point in all aspects. Tasty and worth recommending, but not an absolute must. 

They take credit cards here, which is excellent if you eat a lot of Ramen and also happen to be a credit card points extraordinaire. Not a must go if you&#39;ve got other food places on your list (if you&#39;re a tourist that is) , but certainly worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area on a brisk day and want a hearty pick me up.

I am fairly knowledgeable with Japanese food in NY and I was very surprised I never heard of this place. I have been to Japan a few times and this place felt very Japanese. The layout was very straightforward and the number of Japanese clientele and Japanese businessmen was a very promising sign, as was the constant stream of people. The place is on the small side as it only has a small bar and 3 smaller tables, it seats around 18 but that 4am closing time is a huge draw. Hungover ramen anyone? Helll f&#39;in yeah! 

The food:

Black Kakuni Ramen- Ma-yu oil, pork, egg, onion, dry seaweed, scallion, bok-choy in chicken &amp; pork broth. The ramen had so much flavor, the broth was so perfectly amazing, I also like the pronounced garlic flavor throughout. The soft boiled egg was great, the wavy noodle was a good noodle since it clings to the broth well and I like the chewy texture, the char siu was pretty good and fatty. The only issue I had was it does tend to get salty toward the end of the bowl and the broth is kinda greasy and that greasy feeling kinda sticks with you when you leave. If you wanted extra noodle it is only $1.50, but after 11pm you get one order for free. On my next visit, I will try the White Kakuni Ramen. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ee2vZHztLmtZ7s7YkOAcXg&amp;userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Japanese Pancake- Also known as Okonomiyaki was too mushy. The flavor was just OK, we originally wanted gyoza but they ran out, this dish is worth skipping."

You can come here hangry: their ramen bowls are definitely bigger than average and the broth is very heavy. I ordered the Black Kakuni. The first few bites, I was mindblown: the richness of the broth, the finely thin noodles springy and savory with all the flavors, and the fatty meat all together and hit my hungry stomach in the most satisfying way. Unfortunately though, this amazing first impression did not last throughout the course of the meal. Don&#39;t get me wrong: this was a solid bowl of ramen. However, it can&#39;t compete with the Totto&#39;s and Ramen-Ya&#39;s and Ippudo&#39;s of the ramen world. The broth, while rich and tasty, gets very overwhelmingly salty after a while. I also thought there could have been more toppings included (you can add your own for some additional $). Overall pretty good though and kudos for being very cheap: around $10-12 for just a regular bowl of ramen."

Usually, I&#39;m not a big fan of thin ramen noodles, but it complemented the broth pretty well. I had the white kakuni which was a little lighter than the black kakuni, but just as flavorful and not as overwhelming! Each bowl of noodles comes with a soft-boiled egg (A++++++), char siu (which is super fatty, so beware if you&#39;re trying to count macros), and bok choy! 

I was surprised to see that it&#39;s a tad bit cheaper here in comparison to a lot of ramen places, especially for it to be a late night eats. Service here is pretty efficient, but it wasn&#39;t as busy when I was eating here so I don&#39;t really know how it gets during peak hours."

GOOD:
-Price is very reasonable at $10-12 for a bowl.
-Very quick service
-Complimentary small romaine lettuce salad with ginger dressing
-Good lunch specials: for an extra $3, you could add pork bowl, curry chicken and rice, or gyoza to your ramen! 

BAD:
-Ramen is average. It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s certain not the best. The broth department is lacking in depth of flavor. It&#39;s just missing some umami ingredient that my favorite ramen spots happen have in their soups.
-Small place, but at least seems okay clean
-The lady was so incredibly rude on the phone when I asked how long the wait was for 2 people. She hurriedly said to sign in on the sheet and wait for my name to be called. And then she hung up! I understand you&#39;re busy but bad phone communication is a huge red flag for the quality of a restaurant.

I also can&#39;t decide if I like the main waitress or not. She seems mean and rude but then she seems really nice.. I guess she&#39;s just busy, so don&#39;t take it personally.

-No draft beer

As for the food, we started off with the pork buns. They had fried chicken buns as well but I decided to go for pork. The buns lacked sauce and flavor, and the pork was literally a fat cube of pork, that wasn&#39;t very tendor nor tasty. To be honest, I was disappointed.

For the ramen, I had the tan tan men. The prices are quite reasonable, it was about $11-$13 for ramen. The tan tan men had a good spicy kick to it, the noodles were good too - not too hard, not too soft, just al dente.

I didn&#39;t have a chance to try the late night menu so I&#39;ll have to come back super late one night."

I came to nishida today and was quickly seated.  Servers are friendly and attentive and their ambience here really reminds me of a tokyo ramen joint and the ramen museum in yokohama.

They have these individual size sake cups here and a wide selection of appetizers.  We got the tonkotsu omelette which taste really homemade, the cod roe on top added extra spice to it.  i ordered the white kakuni ramen which came with pork, egg and bok choi.  My hubby&#39;s miso ramen came with the same toppings plus corn.  Nowadays most of the ramen joint charges you $12 a bowl and you pay extra for toppings which is a bit crazy for me,  the fact that nishida&#39;s ramen comes with toppings made me love this place even more.

BBQ short ribs - Lots of flavor and not bad. $7 for 8 pieces. 

Kakuni Black Ramen - I expected more. While it has tons of flavor, my taste buds are asking if it&#39;s the right ones. Incredibly oily. As much as I want to slurp up the savory broth, it&#39;s just far too oily for me to do so. Pork was incredibly tender though. 

Decent but not that good."

What I like best about Nishida is that their menu isn&#39;t the typical, tired out miso and shio ramen options you normally find, but isn&#39;t so out there like some of the ramen spots in Brooklyn either. This place strikes the perfect balance of &#34;interesting ramen selections you might want to try&#34; and the classics.

I came here during lunch and even though it was pretty busy, my order was ready in less than 10 minutes. Insider tip: This place is cash only, so make sure you&#39;ve got some bones in your wallet before coming here."

We looked up some places that were still open at 2am, and we decided to come here because the ratings were decent.

I personally wasn&#39;t too hungry, so I ended up just getting takoyaki and fried chicken appetizers. The takoyaki was pretty good, and I think it was worth it. However, the fried chicken just came with 5 small pieces, which in my opinion was not worth the money.

The plating aesthetic was really nice, probably could have appreciated it more if I were sober. Their sake comes in hot and cold option, it&#39;s $6 for one of those mini bottles (I split with my friend and I think it&#39;s about 4-6 shots each?), and it was pretty good sake.

From the ambience, aesthetic, late-night availability, and taste of the appetizers, I know I&#39;ll definitely be back soon to try their ramen!

Also, I think they have jello shots but since we were there so late, he couldn&#39;t make any for us. Next time as well"

The Black Kakuni Ramen ($11) features some delicious chunks of stewed tender pork belly (kakuni), a half cooked soy egg, and a rich garlicky soup. 
My one gripe was that the noodles were soggy! Next time I will ask them to give me firmer noodles.
My bf got the special &#34;Ougon no Tantanmen&#34; (THE GOLDEN TANTANMEN!) It came out in a hot rock bowl (the kind they serve Korean soondoobu in?) and was filled with a rich broth and seafood. He said that the ramen was delicious and mildly spicy, but because the noodles were still &#34;cooking&#34; in the bowl, they became soggy very quickly.
I like that Nishida also has a lot of toppings (conveniently placed on the tables). Check out the roasted garlic chips!
Great taste, but hoping for better noodles next time! Will definitely be back."

Came here a few days ago with my family friend for dinner at around 5ish. The place wasn&#39;t packed at all and we were the first people there. It&#39;s a small ramen restaurant and I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here with a huge crowd. A group of 4 people should be enough.

So my friend and I both got the Black Kakuni Ramen. There&#39;s bok choy, scallions, minced onions, pork, and half boiled egg. I had the straight noodle and my friend got the wavy noodle. Overall, I though the ramen was OK and it was forgettable. Personally, I thought the soup was kinda salty. At least the service here was good."

Everyone who works there is super nice. And you never wait more than 3 min to be seated. 

We went on a monday night at 8 and were seated immediately. We got an order of the fried gyoza which were good. We also got three orders of tan tan ramen with ground pork. Very good. Great soup flavor, deep spices, and superfresh and perfectly cooked noodles. 

We skipped the beer and sake this time as we were hungover from the night before. 

All in all our meal cost a total of $47. Be aware thay they have a $20 min on all cards. 

Try out the black kukuni ramen at some point too if you get the chance. Its a super dark sesame oil yhay is just fantastic and savory to taste.

Not only is their Tan Tan Men really yummy but their appetizers are equally delicious.

I have tried about half a dozen ramen places in the city and this is by far the best!


The appetizers that I had were: BBQ Short ribs, pork buns, grilled octopus and the Asian sausages 

I would definitely come back again next time and reorder the Tan Tan ramen. it is the best type of spicy and the broth is extremely flavorful."

I got the white kakuni ramen with wavy noodles. I was looking for a spicy ramen but I think they only had one option, so they suggested to order the spicy oil for $1. The broth was pretty good, little but oily. Lack of toppings, but they gave a generous amount of pork that was really good. Got about 2 piece of bokchoy LOL. As an appetizer we got the Takayoki.

For those who are not familiar with hiyashi chuka, it&#39;s a cold noodle dish covered in vegetables with a vinegary broth at the bottom. The version served here comes topped with a heap of corn, tomatoes, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, lettuce, half an egg and thick slices of chicken. This is a salad I can get excited about - they use really delicious noodles (likely Sun noodles but I didn&#39;t confirm this) and with all those fresh veggies you can actually enjoy a balanced meal at a ramen-ya! 

They have other seasonal cold noodle options for summer that I&#39;ll need to try also. I sampled the version with minced pork (tan tan men) which was ok but the pork flavor didn&#39;t work quite as well for me in a cold context. It also had less vegetables. 

As far as sides I can vouch for their fried chicken (4 pieces of karaage for $5). Still need to venture through more of the menu. 

Be ready for large portions here! Nishida is a somewhat cramped, low key ramen/curry/izakaya place that does not lend itself to lingering. I&#39;ve never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. The service is friendly and efficient but I&#39;ve always found it strange they serve only bagged tea and charge for it. If you order cold green tea they hand you a bottle of Ito-en."

At midnight, the place was still packed, granted it was a Saturday evening and the interior is small.

I ordered the Black Kakuni Ramen ($11). On the menu, it is described as ma-yu oil, pork, egg, onion, dry seaweed, scallion, and bok choy in chicken and pork broth. When my ramen came, it did not look at all appetizing and the taste also missed the mark. The broth was extremely oily and the ramen was just meh. There was also no dry seaweed and an overwhelming amount of onions as compared to the rest of the ingredients.

- Staff are rude and ramen is subpar. Do yourself a favor and walk a couple more blocks to Totto Ramen."

If you are not a fan of ramen, the good news is that Nishida also offers many other things on the menu, easily allowing you to snack on lots of different things. Chicken wings, pork buns, sausage, eggs with anchovy sauce, platters, rice bowls - you have your options!

Where I really felt we got our money&#39;s worth is with their saki drink specials. Flights of 3 cans - yes cans - of saki ranged from $10 - $25. And each one we tried was simply delicious...but then again, I can drink sake all day and night! I cannot wait to come back and have more sake shots with Beverly, the bar tender. Our girls&#39; night out was truly special because of her service, charm and generosity. 

The venue itself is quite small so this place is best for a party of two to four max. Sit at the bar and converse with Beverly and the friendly staff, or grab a small table and bench and slurp up your broth to your heart&#39;s content. I&#39;ll definitely be back to Nishida!"

I&#39;ve had really awful ramen and amazing ramen.  Nishida falls somewhere in between.  If it wasn&#39;t for the spectacular ramen I had a couple of days ago, I would probably give Nishida a higher mark.

In fact, the ramen was fair.  The noodles didn&#39;t taste like they were from a package as from my horrible ramen, also earlier this week..  The dish was good enough. but it wasn&#39;t spectacular.  I didn&#39;t care much for the ground pork, though.  I was mistakenly expecting char siu.  Next time I&#39;ll know to make sure.

I can walk 3 more minutes and have astounding ramen as long as it&#39;s not peak dining time.

I&#39;ve not gotten ramen in quite some time in the city given it&#39;s typically $14-15 a bowl...and for that bowl we&#39;re just talking noodles, two slivers of meat, like two seaweed sleeves, and some scallions. It&#39;s honestly pretty absurd and even laughable when you consider a typical bowl of ramen prices out at $5-6 in Japan. It&#39;s meant to be comfort food but in a city like New York, that sentiment and belief in cheap eats gets lost. But back to this review-- the ramen here hovers around $11-12 but more importantly, they provide flavor (and broth) that&#39;s incredibly unique. The black kakuni ramen is solid and a totally different take than any other ramen I&#39;ve had in the city. Would highly recommend this along with the spicy chicken dish. 

Decor is really Japanese--which is obviously a good thing. You&#39;ve got traditional kabuki masks alongside Ultraman masks posted up on the walls along with other Japanese fare littered through the small hole-in-the-wall restaurant. I think it&#39;s a great option for a meal if you&#39;re ever near the UN and the Japan Society, where they screen films for their annual Japanese Film Festival every July."

I personally don&#39;t know of any ramen spots open this late, so this is a major win when trying to beat the post-drinking hunger pang with ramen.

Next to other ramen dining experiences in the city, Nishida feels authentic. Less so the Americanized ramen, but this ramen speaks true Japanese ramen to me. Comparatively to say the great ramen joints like Totto or Ippudo, Nishida was an unexpected, yet pleasant surprise. It is a small, cute and cozy little space, offering a limited number of seats. Simple decor and is like any other average ramen spot in terms of appearance. For food, we wanted Gyoza, but they were out. This was (my guess) 9PM or 10PM on a weeknight. We instead opted for the Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake), which is pretty safe and usually awesome standard to order at Japanese restaurants like this. I thought it was a rather decent dish, but my guests felt otherwise. The only thing that bothered may have been the texture. Though compared to other spots, I would say this wasn&#39;t a winner or a must-try. Onto ramen, I had the Black Kakuni Ramen, which sounded and looked amazing on the menu. It features a mix of ma-yu oil, pork, egg, onion, dry seaweed, scallion, garlic, bok-choy in chicken &amp; pork broth. The most prominent flavor was the garlic. Albeit, a little salty, but I didn&#39;t mind the saltiness and that pungent garlic flavor. The broth is a bit on the oily side, as compared to some other ramen bowls I have had. Though this was a solid ramen dish, and I was pleasantly surprised by it. I was not expecting too much, but I would definitely return for their Kakuni Ramen. I opted for the wavy noodle, which was much better next to the thin noodle. They do offer options in terms of noodle type. We did order a share of kaedama of the thin noodles (extra noodle) at the end, just to compare. The texture certainly changed with the thin noodle. With Black Kakuni, you are much better off with the wavy texture noodle, which soaks up more of that strong flavored broth.

Nishida is certainly a hidden gem. Not too many know about this little midtown spot. And nothing beats a ramen spot open so late. I would highly recommend if you are in this area and need a satisfactory ramen fix."

At first glance, it appears to be an ubiquitous venue - a barebones, hole-in-the-wall eatery with the traditional row of counter seats next to the kitchen, as well as a handful of two-tops for groups. Thankfully, it meant that my two friends and I had no problem securing seats on a Monday evening after work, especially given the fact that they run an attractive Monday deal for a plate of gyoza [1].

We were greeted by a friendly, gregarious Singaporean lady, who eagerly pointed out some of their more popular menu items, simultaneously nudging us to order more. We did, of course, take on her offer for a plate of gyoza per person. They&#39;re cooked so that the &#34;pan cracklings&#34;, as I like to call them, form as one even layer that links all six dumplings together. Although they were a little inconsistent in size and shape, the filling of pork and diced vegetables was tasty and well seasoned, and the wrapper wasn&#39;t too thick.

As for the ramen, I went with the Tan Tan Men, a generously portioned bowl of ramen with a chicken miso base which is topped with ground pork, scallions, bean sprouts, bok choy, and a hint of sesame paste. I have to say that I was particularly taken by this broth; it was unctuous, smooth, and perfectly seasoned with just a hint of spice at the end. The miso and chicken base blended so well that I might have mistaken it for a tonkotsu base instead. The noodles, a thin, slightly wavy variety, were toothsome and satisfying, and complemented the various other toppings well. It reminded me a great deal of Terakawa&#39;s version of the same bowl, so fans of the latter will definitely enjoy the ramen here.

There are few ramen spots I&#39;m willing to visit more than once, but I have to say that I&#39;d be more than happy to return to Nishida Sho-ten. Not only do they have an ever-changing menu with a regular rotation of ramen specials, but it&#39;s a welcoming, low-key venue that any diner would feel comfortable in. As for my second visit? It&#39;s already in the works...

Service was hands down 5 stars. Our server was amazing and the sous chef came out and spoke to us which was a nice touch. 

We ordered 
Mac and cheese: very good flavor, unfortunately the dish was lukewarm. Good portion tho. 

Short ribs: delicious as well as the mashed potatoes.

Surf n turf: The big disappointment which put a damper on the experience. The three ounce filet was fatty. The description said jumbo shrimp, the ones on my plate WERE NOT jumbo. They were teeny tiny shrimp, trust me I know the difference. It felt like a wasted $20 for that entree. 

Overall, I enjoyed our dinner and would return to try a different dish. I really wanted to give higher stars but the surf n turf killed it for me."

I really want to give it a higher rating as the waitress is super friendly and she gave us a dessert on the house since the braised short ribs we ordered were not yet ready. 
But I am a foodie, so let&#39;s talk about the food! I have to say it&#39;s a let down!
Before I went, I actually checked on the website and read about the Chef&#39;s profile and some of the reviews on yelp and was looking forward to the Jerk chicken and etc.
So we ordered the lamb lollipop, homemade ravioli, jerk chicken, c2c calamari, seafood pasta. The 4 small boneless chicken breast jerk chicken are so bland with no trace of &#34;jerkiness&#34; and slathered with some canned mushroom and canned chicken gravy. The ravioli came out with just one lonely ravioli! I understand this is a tapas place, but come on, you come with a friend and you do want to share! It&#39;s a $5 piece ravioli! Its actually the best dish of the night.
The fancy name C2C (coast to coast) gives a fancy air that the ingredient is fresh! But the squid itself has no taste, the tomato sauce used has some bitter aftertaste like the tomato sauce came from an inferior brand of can tomato sauce! Huh, how can one expect to break out in the competitive NY food scene with such offer?!
The pasta has nothing to brag about, at $15 a plate, the portion is really small, with two shrimps and a few tiny scallops. 
The lamb lollipop is just a tiny piece of lamb, which is just a bit.
So when one looking at the menu, the price does not look expensive but when taking the portion into consideration, it&#39;s pretty steep with very so so food! I certainly can cook up something more fancy than the Chef Eddie G&#39;a kitchen! And we are not even full at all at the end!"

My boyfriend and I came in on a Thursday evening. I purchased a groupon for the restaurant after reading all the reviews. I was feeling this is a great deal and this place must be amazing! Wrong!

Place: The restaurant  is small, but very nicely decorated. You get a cozy, Romantic, intimate feel, which I am big fan of. The place was not busy, so we expected the service to be on point. 

Food: To start off we order ginger ale and they were flat. I forgave that. We were soo hungry so we were quick to look at the menu. The selection was small, but we saw some things on there that we liked. We ordered an appetizer and our meals. 

We order the calamari for our appetizer. It came with sauces, blue cheese and marinara, drizzled on top. I am not a fan of blue cheese, so I asked for it on the side. So let&#39;s just say I was very disappointed when the food came and it was on top. Forgiving the sauce mishap, the calamari was bad. It tasted like &#34;store bought I fried at home and over cooked&#34; calamari. We wanted to leave then, but thought the entrees would be better. 

I ordered the fish (tuna) and my boyfriend ordered the surf and turf. To start the portion sizes are laughable. I get small plates, but seriously. The meal was even more disappointing than the app. The tuna was super hard and flavorless, I didn&#39;t even eat it. The broccoli was watery, like steamed in a bag type of broccoli. The mash potatoes we decent and the only thing I ate half of because I was soooo hungry! My boyfriend said his steak was terrible and the shrimp tasted like they were dipped in wine before served.

Service: I have to give a star rating or I would give no stars. I will say of my experience, the only positive thing was our waitress. She was nice and very understanding about how we were displeased with the food.  She took off my order from the bill. 

The food took EXTREMELY long to come and the place was not even busy. I couldn&#39;t understand for the life of me why it was so slow! I am starting to question these 5-star reviews. We left get food at another place afterwards. I didn&#39;t even want to stay for the free dessert. 

It is safe to say I will not be returning. I do hope they are able to turn it around because I love the idea of what they are trying to do, but they are just wayyyyy off the mark."

He&#39;s also a great chef. On a late weekday evening, a friend and I were looking for a spot to eat and catch the game. We settled on Chef Eddie G&#39;s kitchen as it was close to his place, a few blocks walking distance.

I have to say that even though I was a bit weary because the size of the menu was a bit small, I was in for a real treat. We kept it simple: a side order of steak fries, and the jerk masala chicken. It&#39;s pretty cool to see the action and watch your food being made real time.

The sauce for the chicken was out of this world! I don&#39;t know the components that went into it, but I could not stop, every bite made me crave it more and more. Even after we finished the chicken, we made sure to clean up the plate. Every droplet was worth it!

Omg...what are you guys (previous reviewers) used to eating...horse sh*t??! I trusted the 5 star rating and reviews and came here, and was severely disappointed!!! We ordered the lamb lollipops &amp; clams...both LACKED flavor!!!! I&#39;m sitting here in the restaurant typing this with a screwed face. For our entrees we both ordered the short ribs, mine as it comes with garlic mashed potatoes..there were lumps in it, and not a hint of garlic. He substituted his mash with mac n chz...FAIL. It was worse than box velveeta mac n chz. At the end of our meal, our waiter brings out some Peanut butter tarte of some sort for free. I&#39;m thinking &#34;I don&#39;t want that, I want REAL dessert...so I call the server over, fill out the comment section of the check in part on yelp, and ask for a dessert menu...to my dismay he responds &#34;that&#39;s all we have left...the tbl that just left ordered the last dessert I don&#39;t want this PEANUT BUTTER FUCKERY you call DESSERT!!!!!!!! 

Trust me...I am a TRUE foodie, I&#39;ve been to way more restaurants than I&#39;ve reviewed on here (procrastination + business=less reviews) this IS NOT it!

And to make matters WORSE, the owner/Chef (who btw didn&#39;t cook one single course of our meal in an EMPTY restaurant) sat with his back toward us the entire time.

The food: we tried the mac and cheese, short rib and the seafood arabiatta pasta. Even though the portions appear to be small, it is very filling and food this good should not be reheated. 

Only one bit of constructive criticism: the music being played in the restaurant (oldies/doo-wop) does NOT serve the atmosphere you have created with the interior design and food profiles. Elevate the experience with quiet jazz, instrumental, alt rock, folk rock.... literally anything but what was on :)"

Also tried the nutty cup which is like a high end Reese&#39;s cup. You should probably share with a friend as its rich and sweet - but I&#39;m not really a dessert person.

The restaurant is not very attractive outside, but inside it is very cute and intimate. Service was excellent. Although their menu was limited, the food was very good. I ordered the braised short ribs. It was tender and just the right amount of food. My friend ordered the jerk chicken, the gravy was delicious and the chicken was cooked just right. They don&#39;t have a license for liquor yet but there was a store around the corner that we were happy to go to because it saves us money 10 percent off if you say you&#39;re from Eddie&#39;s). The dessert  was phenomenal and I would come back here and recommend it to anyone:)"

My review is a personal judgement of our experience, yes, but also we do try to be objective on what we experience and see.
Place is cozy, byo which is not bad at all, as soon as you get in you can smell meat, which for me is a plus.
Atmosphere: great for most of the events, with friends, on your date(which i was) family dinner, business, i don&#39;t think small kids would enjoy it much tho lol. The chef walked couple of times around the tables to check on guests, and did welcome them if he did recon it&#39;s their first time. It gives an extra to the place. Warm.
Service: it wasn&#39;t busy, but if you want some water better ask right away otherwise you might be waiting for a while. Most of our food came at the same time despite we asked to have it served in different timing. Not a big deal, but having already more than 2 hot dishes at once makes it hard to enjoy. Superficial.
Food: keep in mind this is a tapas place, and that is what you get. The portions ARE SMALL, to get full you still wanna pay around 30-40 bucks per person. But you get the chance to try different interesting dishes. Things everybody likes to do.
Melted mozzarella and tomatoes 10$:
3 pieces i wouldn&#39;t get it again honestly, it tastes like cheap mozzarella melted on top of a piece of tomato. Greasy.
Lamb Lollipop 5$: ordered 2, both medium rear, i suggest you to try it that way. 1 per serving but worth it, with a nice mix of citrus flavor with a mustard kick. Juicy.
C2C calamarari 10$: nicely done, crispy, served with a great spiced dipping sauce. 
Crunchy 
Braised short ribs 15$: ok that was absolutely the best dish, extremely tender it could melt in our mouths, well paired with the garlic mashed. Love it!
Surf and Turf 20$: supposed to be served with jumbo shrimp, but as they ran out of it the server proposed us to try the scallops. We ordered the filet mignon rear, we got it kinda medium well, but it could have been just a misunderstanding, so we eat it anyway and it was dry, still chewy in the mouth. We probably should have send it back, our bad, this is not how we wanted it, but the rest also was not great, Scallops were yes fresh but kinda cold, and the veggies(broccoli) tasted like microwaved or reheated. Disappointing. 
Steakhouse cut french fries: if you crave fries JUST GET THEM!!!

We spent 80$. We were pretty full. 
Overall was a nice dining experience, we both liked the place, the setting, i can tell food is good, despite some accident. I understand it can happen. I really wonder how it would be in a really busy day tho. Or maybe it was just a casualty. I am sure it can definitely improve on some aspects.

We will come back to try again the surf and turf but rear, and some other things from the menu, and i am sure we will give an extra star:)"

I have never seen a review articulated with the use of profanity, it&#39;s seems as though it was more of a personal attack than a review based on a dissatisfied pallet. But I guess in this strange world I shouldnt expect the slightest bit of civility. I have yet to have a bad meal at this spot and having a generous expense account which allows me to dine anywhere, I say Chef Eddie  can stand up against the midtown spots.

It&#39;s so great to have a place with great food, great ambience, great service right here in the East Side. It&#39;s truly something we&#39;ve been missing for a very long time. Chef Eddie and his staff were absolutely amazing. Taking time to speak with us made us feel as though we went to a friends house for dinner. TVs were on with some games (Monday night football and Baseball highlights) however, the true winner was the music. It wasn&#39;t too loud or over powering however it was at an enjoyable level. 
The overall menu is reasonably priced and each dish we tasted was exceptional. The portions were absolutely amazing. They were just right, not too big or too small. Enough for you to finish the meal without feeling gluttonous. This trip I tried the braised short rib with garlic mashed potatoes. The shorten was seasoned well and he potatoes had chunks of garlic which made for each bite savory and flavorful. I can&#39;t wait to try out a few more dished. 

I highly recommend this place."

Tapas were perfect portions. Service was attentive, knowledgable, and courteous. We started with a pork belly slider, ravioli, and calamari. All were fantastic, the ravioli was oozing with flavor, pork belly was tender, and the calamari was very nicely breaded, paired with marinana. Entree&#39;s were the Jerk Chicken Marsala and the shell steak (5 oz.). The Jerk Chicken Marsala was spicy, very tasty. The steak, like every other dish, was flavorful and cooked perfectly. To end the meal with the caramel crumb cake was amazing. Will definitely return here. An East Harlem gem."

When my brother and I arrived on Thursday night (6/30) the lovely server let us know that it was a BYOB sitch, and directed us to a local shop where we were offered a discount on our purchase if we dined at Eddie G&#39;s. So we picked up a bottle &amp; returned to the resto. It was all downhill from there. On the evening we arrived Chef had the night off. No prob, except that he left behind amateurs to run his kitchen. We ordered the pork belly sliders to start. The biscuit was hard &amp; dry, and the pork hadn&#39;t been braised then crisped, just crisped, leaving it tough and inedible. Our server was kind enough to take it back &amp; offer something else. We ordered the lamb lollipop which was gray on the outside and inside it was basically raw. For our entrees, we ordered the tuna (rare) and the prime rib (med-rare). The tuna lacked the correct sear on the outside and had a fishy taste. The prime rib was basically a dry hockey puck. We were DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED and sent our entrees back as well. The sweet server was very accommodating, and I&#39;d like to give it another try when Chef is there. It seemed like the folk in the kitchen were afraid to fire up the grill &amp; get it hot enough to cook the proteins properly, resulting in incredibly sad cookery.  I tried it on a groupon which has now expired, so I won&#39;t be able to use the deal. All in all it was a less than stellar experience. Now I have to try to deal with groupon customer service and try to get it addressed. Truly a bummer all around..."

I don&#39;t write reviews often, but the mac and cheese there is the best I&#39;ve had in my entire life. (After, I literally texted my roommate that I&#39;d had the best Mac and cheese of my life.) You can customize it with mix-ins like shrimp and tomatoes; I had it plain and was not disappointed. One thing I really appreciate about this place is how flexible they are. I asked for a side of broccoli instead of the cream of spinach on the menu, and they were happy to accommodate me. (It didn&#39;t hurt that the broccoli was surprisingly well done.) I also had the ravioli as a starter - not mindblowing but no complaints. Finally, had the crumb cake with the rum-based sauce - good presentation, good crumb, could be a little airier / fluffier.

A couple of months ago when it opened I wanted to check it out immediately. BEST DECISION EVER! We came here late on a Tuesday and Thank God it was still open. We were immediately greeted and seated by Chef Eddie G himself, a New York native and soon to be an East Harlem Staple.  We ordered the Mac and Cheese, blended and arranged perfectly with cheeses I couldn&#39;t name off hand.  It was perfect to share and start with as it came out first.  We were then served the scallops and linguine as well as the short rib.  I enjoyed the scallops as they were decent sized and perfectly cooked.  But my boyfriend ordered the short Rib according to the recommendation of Chef Eddie G and that was a great decision on his part. It was extremely tender and the mashed potatoes were actually potatoes that were mashed not the crap that comes in a box or a plastic tub.  Chef Eddie G made his suggestion and instantly got in the kitchen, like a boss, and began serving us.  I was extremely impressed and satisfied. I always love places where the owner is also the chef.

New York Times: N/A
Michelin Guide: N/A

Dinner:
* fire-grilled baby octopus with soy and apple-vinegar sauce - whole baby octopus, not extremely flavorful but the octopus was tender and cooked well with a little charcoal flavor on the outside. We ended up dipping the octopus into the budae jjigae soup base;

* deep-fried cod fish in spicy gochujang sauce with onions, bean sprouts and sea squirts (RECOMMEND) - lukewarm fried cod fish paired with hot gochujang on the bottom, which was a surprising delight of the day. the gochujang was sweet and Korean-spicy, thus dominated the flavor of this dish; the cod fish was fried but very tender on the inside.

* budae jjigae (RECOMMEND) - portion could be larger, but the pot had everything a meat/budae jjigae lover was looking for (three kinds of ham, rice cake, noodle, etc.). Adequate hotness of the dish was a delight.

Overall: 4/5"

Snagged a precious lunchtime table for two at Her Name Is Han, passing up old staples such as Luke&#39;s Lobster or the usual KTown eateries nearby.  Ordered the seafood kalguksu, which was a shame.

The joy of kalguksu is that the thick noodles are supposed to leach out into the broth, thickening it such that sucking down the soup is a high point of the meal.  Not here.  Noodles were toothy good, sure, but soup was sour and unforgivably thin.  Further, seafood was chewy and oddly flavored.

Based on other glowing reviews, perhaps it&#39;s just the kalguksu that is poor.  Might be convinced to return, if someone else is paying the tab."

My friend Anna and I initially wanted to go to Cup &amp; Cup (Take31 at night), but I didn&#39;t realize their lunch was weekdays only. They recommended we hop over to their sister restaurant right next door. I&#39;m really glad we did! The ambiance was brighter and more welcoming. The menu is also very well laid out with pleasing visuals, so it was very easy to choose.

Instead of cocktails we opted for their fresh juice which was a thick half strawberry, half grape smoothie. The smoothie was really refreshing. It had pieces of grape skin in it, which some people might not like, but I liked the texture it added.

I ordered the Black Cod. The texture of the cod was soft and melty. Be careful of the little bones. I loved the sauce basted on the cod mixed with the rice. The cod also came with half a soft-boiled scotch egg, beetroot potato salad, miso soup, kimchi, pickled mushrooms, apples, bok choy, salad with a wasabi mustard sauce, and a large bowl of rice. The cod was small, but with all the accompaniments, I was very full.

My friend ordered the Hamburger Steak with Quail Egg, which came with the same side dishes. I had a piece of my friend&#39;s hamburg, which was smothered in a delicious gravy. The texture was really silky smooth.

The presentation of the food was so neat and cute. The entree and side dishes were presented in little bowls that fit snugly on a metal tray. It really reminded me of those Japanese-style breakfasts. Given how much I enjoyed both brunch here and dinner at Take31, I definitely want to come back for dinner.

Everything about this place is on point, from the unique Korean dishes not typically found in other K-Town spots to the beautiful plating that is both appetizing and photo-friendly. I love coming during the daytime the most, since the crowd is a lot smaller and their lunch menu offers a wide variety of main and side dishes. Perfect for those who want to have a little bit of everything! Did I mention that the lunch options are also extremely affordable? 

I know it&#39;s tempting to just settle for one of the many Korean spots on 32nd, but Her Name is Han is definitely worth checking out! Everyone I&#39;ve recommended to come here has fallen in love with the place as much as I had. If you have extra time (and extra space in your stomach), I&#39;d highly suggest going to their sister store Cup &amp; Cup next door after your meal to enjoy a nice cup of green tea latte (in a cute bear design, no less!)."

My fiance and I went with another couple for dinner on a Thursday night. We put ourselves on the list and waited for our table which didn&#39;t take very long at all (maybe about 20 minutes). PS: don&#39;t expect to be seated unless your entire party is present.

Anyway, we were seated and given menus. We decided to try out a few things so we would end up with a nice variety of dishes. We got the seafood pancake, which was good, but could&#39;ve been fried up just a little bit longer for some more crunch. Also, they didn&#39;t serve it sliced up, which is weird... I forgot what they gave us for dividing it up, but it was just weird.

Moving onto the main dishes, we got two different types of soups/stews: the spicy seafood &amp; dumpling soup and rice cakes, fish cakes, noodles, beef, sausages, seafood and vegetables in a spicy fish broth (sorry, the name of the dish just wouldn&#39;t translate into what it was really lol). Both were good and the portions were perfect for our group of 4. My only complaint is about broth for the rice cake dish... it got like overly sweet? I&#39;m not sure if it started off like that or just turned into that the longer it cooked, but it wasn&#39;t what I was expecting from the dish. I think you can find better Korea food for less money in the K-Town area, but I guess this place is worth trying as long as you&#39;re not expecting the sun AND the moon at the same time.

I think I&#39;d definitely return to try more of their menu and perhaps change my opinion about this place especially since I&#39;m such a fan of Take31 (their sister restaurant right next door)."

After starting with a slew of nibbles, the dumplings and bulgogi soup were the main event. Both exceeded my wildest expectations and left me breathless - you know that feeling where you don&#39;t actually eat but just inhale the food because it&#39;s so good? That type of breathless. Of course, the whole was topped with a few bottles of Chum Churum, a soju that&#39;s as delicious as it&#39;s fun to say. 

I can&#39;t recommend this place enough. But if you do visit, maybe wear sweatpants or at the very least, jeans with an elastic waist."

1. It&#39;s a little further away from KTown, which I enjoy since there are significantly less crowds. You have to wait outside for a table so it&#39;s nice not having to dodge a bunch of tourists on the streets.
2. The cleanliness of this place is quite impressive considering the amount of traffic that comes through. The decor is cute and their bathroom seemed well kept.
3. The food was delicious! My friend and I split the pork belly, the seafood pancake, and a veggie over rice bibimbap. My only critique is that the portion sizes could have been bigger since it wasn&#39;t very filling. I&#39;m also definitely coming back to try the galbi and the fried chicken too.
4. The dessert was great - we each had our own green tea cheesecake because it was actually tiny...which takes me back to my point about portion sizes. I am also going to get the ice cream during the summer months since that looked amazing.
5.I will say that I sat right next to the door and it kept opening and closing due to traffic. Unfortunately, that took away from the dining experience. I know they have seating there to fit more people, but they really shouldn&#39;t seat people there when it&#39;s cold outside OR they should have someone controlling the amount of cold air that travels into the restaurant."

Jocelyn - Black Cod has a lot of bones but the fish melts in your mouth mmmm

We ordered the &#34;army stew&#34; hot pot and the Fire Grilled Bulgogi. Both were really delicious. I highly recommend ordering the bulgogi-- It is so flavorful. I could have eaten three plates of it. Both dishes alone were enough for the two of us and didn&#39;t leave us feeling too full.

The interior is homey and cozy. Since we only tried two things on the menu, I&#39;m excited to go back to try other things."

We got the dumplings, clams with potato noodles, seafood pancake, cold chili noodles and bimbimbap. The food was all flavorful with decent portions (the dumplings were quite small). The prices are very reasonable for a hip-ish new Korean place in New York.

This place is adorable and came right out of a Korean-drama story book. The decor is homey yet put together, how I imagine a posh cafe might look like in the quaintest neighborhood in Seoul. 

The food is beautifully plated. Although the prices seem a little steep, the portion size is generous and the food is tasty. There&#39;s a bit of Japanese-inspired in there somewhere.

The soju based drinks here are delicious and cheap. The shareable portions are massive! We had the grilled octopus to start and ended the meal with a broth/noodle dish. They bought out a bowl warmer, lit it up and placed this huge pot of noodles in front of us. We had asked to make the brother extra spicy and they were able to accommodate us very well.

The least amount you should expect to have to wait in line for dinner is like 20 mins. I went there once but left cause the line was too long. So, finally I gotta try it and was somewhat disappointed.

My friends and I came in three on a Saturday night. We had to wait for around 40 mins to be seated. We ordered the signature pork belly, beef bulgogi with rice wrapped in (?) leaves, clam japchae, and subdubu. I liked the clam japchae a lot. Actually it was the only dish I like. The rice wrap thing had a kind of weird smell. Also I didn&#39;t think the boiled pork belly was really good. It was tender but lack of flavor and chewiness of the skin. 

A lot of tasty-looking dishes on the menu that I wanted to try but not sure I will come back because of the long waiting."

Ambiance-wise everything was spot-on. Lots of natural light in the front dining room which I think lends itself to a lazy brunch. The table spacing was pretty good, and the service was efficient and friendly.

Oh! I know why it&#39;s not 5-stars. No liquor license (just wine and beer)- so my brunch drinks kinda sucked.

But besides that we enjoyed our meal. Really enjoyed the corn and sausage apps- especially the corn version (it was like a deep fried spoonful of corn soup- you should try it).

We had the black cod and fried chicken entrees, both very tasty in their own way. Also the sides went well with the food. Nothing was blow-you-away special, but I thought  the plates were well balanced, everything was prepared very well, and we left full and happy.

You&#39;ve probably had the same or similar dishes someplace else, but here, they rely way less on salt or oil, and way more on bringing out subtle and interesting flavors. 

SIDE DISHES: Mix of traditional and modern. To the latter, i was especially impressed by the asparagus (very tender) and potato salad (was a sort of puree). 

MAINS: Here&#39;s what we ordered for a group of 4 (which was a good amount)::
- Crispy pancake with seafood and hot peppers: SO GOOD. Perfectly crispy and also stuffed with hot peppers which made it taste super fresh and substantial.
- Fire-grilled bulgogi - sweet and yummy
- Country fried chicken - STANDOUT dish. The chicken was SO crispy on the outside and SO tender on the inside. It also came with this awesome sauce that was some sort of fancy delicious ketchup. Highly recommend this one. 
- The C6 budae (had rice cake, fish cake, beef, a crap ton of other stuff). Also great. Unlike a lot of other budae jigaes, this was NOT at all overly salty. Instead, every single ingredient had its own flavor which was complemented by the broth. So in love with this dish. 

DESSERTS: Save room for dessert, seriously. Even if you&#39;re already full, you will not regret this. 
- Green tea biscuit with black sesame ice cream and dehydrated strawberries - just get it. Just like everything else at this place, everything tasted as it should. Nothing was too sweet and the flavors and diverse textures worked together really well.
- Green tea cheescake - very thick and very matcha-heavy. Surprise hit with the group. 

DRINKS: We got the grapefruit sowuju. While it was decent, I think you can skip this. 

SERVICE: Good! Our waitress was super friendly and helpful in recommending dishes and portion sizes for us novices. One thing to note - they only seat complete parties and you have to wait outside. When I went, it wasn&#39;t very cold so wasn&#39;t a big deal, but I was thinking that with winter coming up, it might be an issue for groups with stragglers!"

True, there is always a very long line (but the trick is to have one member of your party get there earlier &amp; put your name down on the list. But keep in mind, the whole party must be there for you to be seated). It is also quite noisy inside but the restaurant was full at the time, so it makes sense. Otherwise, my dining experience was wonderful.
The host is so polite and friendly; he does a great job of managing the long line/ big crowd. He also came to our table to check on us and helped my mother carry her suitcase (I always appreciate those acts of kindness). Our server was also very sweet and attentive. Overall, excellent service! The food also came out super quickly. They must have a very efficient kitchen.

Here&#39;s what we had:
-bulgogi (10/10, sweet and juicy)
-Assorted small dishes (we must&#39;ve had at least 4 helpings of kimchee lol)
-mushroom hot pot (an excellent vegetarian option)
-codfish with fruity/tangy miso sauce (light, flaky &amp; perfectly cooked. The sauce is addictive)
-salmon tartare (surprisingly large portion size, so tasty, a great appetizer)
-big apple (probably the heaviest dish we had, and it&#39;s just ice cream and poached apple- so that&#39;s really saying something. Also, it was super good)

The wait can be long and the prices are a little high. We ordered the seafood hot pot that came with clams, calamari, shrimp, rice cakes, and yam noodles. The unappetizing part was the end when you start to see all the oil start to congeal. 

The octopus was okay. It doesn&#39;t look like the picture in the menu and I wish it was more like barbecue or charred. But it seemed more like it was boiled or baked in the oven. It didn&#39;t have much flavor and instead a slightly chewy texture."

But holy COWWW this was Korean food with a twist on it like I&#39;ve never seen before. The cuisine that was served here was on par with that of a Michelin rated restaurant. This place definitely deserves more recognition. I was such a huge fan of the rice cake wrapped pork belly. (The only thing that couldve made it a little better was if it had a little more of a kick to it aka it could&#39;ve been easily solved if I had just asked for hot sauce). Each dish was packed with flavor but it wasn&#39;t overwhelming to your taste buds or stomach. I can&#39;t wait to come back.

The pancake was different, but still fried well and tasted good. However, I thought it needed some sauce with it. The salad was actually my favorite, because it was better than I expected from a salad. It was dressed nicely and the bulgolgi added a great touch to the greens.

As a vegetarian (precisely pescatarian), I very much enjoyed Black cod steak( ), Memtaiko, Japanese yam and potato pancake(), and   (perrilla leaf rice wraps - non vegetarian friend ate the bulgogi). 

On Saturday 7pm, I had to wait about an hour. There is a big crowd outside combined with wait lines of Take 31."

I gave three stars because the waiters kept rushing us out before we could even finish our food. 

My friend and I ordered a lot so we were taking our time to finish our food and enjoy it. The waitress was so impatient, she threw our side dishes together in a dirty bowl when we told her we were still working on it. She wasn&#39;t even paying attention, her mind was somewhere else and she seemed rushed and agitated. She did apologize for all the wasted food. 

Same happened before when we ordered. It was my friend&#39;s first time having Korean food and I had to explain some basics to her. The waitress came over at least 3 times during the first 10 min we sat down, and pushed us to order. Clearly she saw we were still trying to decide, instead of asking &#34;do you have questions?&#34; she kept asking &#34;are you ready to order???&#34; 

When it gets crowded for dinner, the whole dining experience really goes down. They come across as wanting to turn tables as quickly as possible rather than ensuring quality service and giving customers a decent experience.

Also sitting by the entrance was freezing every time the door opens or closes, so do yourself a favor and ask for a table further inside."

We didn&#39;t wait for a table for two at 7:00 pm on Sunday 
However this place is pricy!
We ordered one beer, the pancake (potato based), the octopus for appetisers and then the fried chicken and the seafood stew for the main course and it was $90 each.
That really should be considered given the several other equally authentic Korean cuisine places around this area and thus can&#39;t give it a five star rating.

Having said that unlike other Korean places, here you don&#39;t feel rushed, the joint is clean and the staff is attentive. 
The pre dinner appetiser samples (Kim Chi, asparagus, seaweed etc) are small just FYI. Try it if you want a Korean place with authentic but expensive menu and better ambience than the competition.

I&#39;m not apologizing for that joke.

If you&#39;re looking for an awesome sit-down lunch deal, this place really can&#39;t be beat. Set lunch specials run $9 to $11 and it&#39;s a ton of food.

I went with the garlic chicken lunch special, which came with a bunch of kimchi sides, like pickled radishes, sweet cauliflower slaw, and some other tiny plates. It also came with the soup of the day (which for me, was a fish cake clear soup). The chicken had garlic crumbs and a sweet (honey-based?) glaze. Chicken was a little lukewarm, but portion sizes were big and filling, especially with the white rice side.

The decor is also great. There&#39;s exposed brick, a painted tin ceiling, library lamps at the tables, stage light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, and a neon sign in the back. The space is also deceptively big, and there&#39;s additional seating in the back. Perfect for lunch with coworkers. Or friends (if you have those).

CASH ONLY!"

We ordered (6) dishes for two people, a bit much, but they were all spectacular, 5 out of 6 anyway, one fell a little short, but we didn&#39;t notice.  Absolutely worth the 20 min wait.  The restaurant next door (Take31) also looks amazing and will try there next!

The hanging TV studio lights over an area within the restaurant was a nice touch but I would have loved this place even if the wallpaper was made in toilet paper!

The items we sampled:

Drink - blueberry infused Sowuju - wanted Grapefruit but they were out, super sweet but delicious.

Food:

- Sauteen rice cake, shishito peppers, kabocha with yuzu Gochujang sauce - good spice , super delish.
- Spicy salmon and cucumber noodles with Plum-Mustard sauce - divine, well balanced
- Tuna sashimi with asian pear and cucumber with spicy Gochujang sauce - while not very innovative in terms of a tuna dish, it was superbly well done, and greatly balanced, delish.
- Fire Grilled beef marinated in chef&#39;s soy sauce with onion - excellent
- Beef Bone noodle soup with poached bok choy, ground beef, and sauteed zucchini - again great dish, wonderful noodles and broth, tying it together like it should be
- And the fried cod dish which I don&#39;t see on the menu as we had it with a spicy red sauce.. and this was the only dish we didn&#39;t completely fell head over heels, but it was still quite nice. 

Absolutely recommend, and to top great service and fast.  The food comes out speed of light fast, but be aware almost all at the same time.. so if you order 6 dishes.. be ready to eat.  Or order them as you finish.

Service was very good and prompt.

I always love Korean food, - spicy but sweet. Flavory but innovative.

However, the recent visit at Her Name is Han is such a disappointment that I might not even wanna come back.

The place is always full even it was during midnight. They look like the next door - TAKE 31, where wood table and seats are dining table and seats and every thing is jammed together. 


Food: this time I had the C7, clam noodles.
I am very disappointed. The C7 is a hot pot where you have very little fish tofu, few instant noodles, and nothing else. The soup of the hot pot is too sweet and loss of sense of spicy. The sweetness made you want to skip the soup.
The clam noodle is bland. I thought it would have little bit soup on top of the noodle. Clearly, we only have noodles and clams.. At least, the whole taste is balanced.

Price: bit pricy.

Service: quick

Overall: 3.5 star. 
I doubt that the quality of their dish would allow me to come back again."

The food is slightly different from those on K-town&#39;s Main Street. For me, it tasted lighter, healthier, simpler, but equally as delicious. I have no idea what homemade Korean food tastes like, but I imagine it would be similar to this.

The side dishes were smaller than what you&#39;d get at most Korean restaurant, but I loved the presentation. The kimchi, which I usually never eat too much of, was incredibly addicting.

My friend and I shared the rice cake appetizer and a seafood and dumplings soup pot. Everything was absolutely delicious. The rice cake isn&#39;t too spicy and came with a few pieces of tasty Shishito pepper. The soup was my absolute favorite of the night. I loved the dumplings, the array of seafood (crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams!), and the vegetables. If you&#39;re a seafood lover, you can&#39;t miss this.

I would recommend that you check out this new korean place not only for its different style of korean food, but also for its restaurant ambience created to mimic a library or a book club with full of characters. 

For a dinner of two, we ordered BBQ pork belly and seafood stew, a HUGE plate of ham, vegetables, eggs, shrimp, ramen, korean rice noodles, rice cakes, spam, clams all slowly stewed up to satiate your appetite. Contrary to what I thought, the broth of seafood stew wasn&#39;t the typical spicy taste, but more sweet than spicy. It really took some getting used to before I could enjoy it; it was definitely a new dining experience. 

What I really liked about this place is that the restaurant prepares their bbq meet dish in the kitchen rather than at your table, a smart way to keep the restaurant&#39;s classy ambience intact and help prevent strong bbq odor from staying at their customers&#39; clothes after the dining experience. Therefore, I would suggest that you have a date night here instead of other typical korean restaurants if you want your date to be able to still smell your coco channel perfume after dinner :P"

ofcourse my Korean friend ordered everything and this may have made the food taste yummier :p

Our waitress recommended the fruit infused soju.

So I gave this place a second chance. The food was much much better this time. Prior to visiting this place, I had checked out the menu online and I originally planned on ordering the Noodle set but that &#34;1 dumpling&#34; was kind of a turn off. Instead of ordering the noodle set, I tried the Salmon &amp; Avocado Platter ($9). The salmon was delicious, topped off with two piece of deep fried avocado. The rice with sweet potato was meh, but it went well with the spicy veggie soup. No way I would&#39;ve finished the spicy veggie soup (not like I finished it but... I was able to finish the rice due to the soup. :)). In the beginning I was sort of worried, but the side salad ended up being pretty good.There wasn&#39;t much salad dressing so I went around the ones that had no dressing. But in the end, there were salad dressing at the bottom. 

Aside from the noodle set, I wanted to try the Grilled Mackerel Bapsang ($9) but my friend chose to ordered that. *sad face* it&#39;s okay, at least I was able to try some and boy, was it DELICIOUS.  I sort of regret not ordering that but then again, I would hate picking the fish bones.. :x 

At the end of the meal, we both felt... unsatisfied, not because the food wasn&#39;t good but because there wasn&#39;t enough food. We had to go for round two. And you have to understand that we&#39;re not a big eater! So...

By 3pm, they started to get ready for dinner(?) so everyone was politely asked to leave..  :(

Have you ever have a tendency to go eat lunch by yourself but you can&#39;t seem to find a good place? Well, guess what? You&#39;ve found it! This place is great to go if you want to eat alone or a on a simple date. Well, at least for me. I wouldn&#39;t mind eating alone in this place or next door at Cup &amp; Cup. I liked the vintage decor and the dim lighting. The place was small with mainly two person dining tables. Once the place gets packed, it&#39;d be hard to move around without being paranoid of knocking things over. 

For the lunch special, I ordered the garlic chicken ($10) and a friend who is no longer in my life ordered the spicy tuna tartar bowl($11).  I guess the expectations i had for this place was set pretty high..  and ended with me being disappointed with the side dishes. One thing I love about  Korean restaurants, are the side dishes. I honestly didn&#39;t finish any of the side dish nor did I like them, the soup was decent, the main course was good for it&#39;s price.

I normally hate raw food.. yes, that is correct, I do not eat raw sushi! But when I tried the spicy tuna sashimi, I had to admit it was pretty good. The flavor was right there (in the beginning), but unfortunately, it didn&#39;t last long...

I couldn&#39;t tell if the portion was just right or too little. At the end of the meal, I wasn&#39;t hungry but I also wasn&#39;t satisfied. 

The service was great though. The food came right away, water kept on being refilled and the music was pretty good. Overall: Decent food for a decent price. Lastly, this place is CASH ONLY."

I&#39;ve ventured here twice because I didn&#39;t think once was enough. 

Both visits I dined in on a Saturday early afternoon and we were seated almost immediately. My first visit, I was skeptical as the place wasn&#39;t crowded but I&#39;m glad I stayed.

The ambiance and food reminds me of a cute cafe right out of a K-Drama. 

Brunch items include your typical Korean dishes from bulgogi to spicy pork. I&#39;d highly recommend the bulgogi. Side dishes include kimchi, various types of salads and a poached egg on top of a pea paste. Mind you, it may sound funky but that pea paste is flavorful with a touch of sweetness. (IT&#39;S A MUST TRY.)

The cocktails here are A-OKAY, nothing to rave about.

And it&#39;s even better that the location isn&#39;t right smack in the madness of 32nd St. If you&#39;re looking for Korean food but sick of traditional bbq joints, do yourself a favor and give Modern Korean cuisine a try. I wouldn&#39;t label them as fusion either because it is purely Korean dishes.

There was hardly a wait from 6-6:30 when I came on Saturday night. They usually get packed after 7. The restaurant looks small from the outside, but extends deep into the back so there is plenty of seating available. Service is decent. Rustic and romantic interior, a bit of a farm to table theme. 

The special cocktails are eye candy. Small, but not bad for $7 which is 1/2 price of cocktails anywhere else. The sparkling lychee was sweet and not too strong. Also delighted that they served us 6 banchan at the beginning of our meal. 

For dinner we ordered spicy noodles, fried chicken, the braised ribs and sweet and sour fried rice. The first two were average.  The fried chicken was breaded without salt or sauce, pretty plain and dry. Most disappointing dish for a whopping $20?! I was expecting more Bonchon style wings too where you get the thin and crispy crust. The best dishes in my opinion were the sweet and sour fried rice and the ribs! All our dishes were a mild sweet spice too so for someone who can&#39;t handle spice at all, I was still able to enjoy my meal. 

I will definitely be back a few more times to try all their food options. I highly recommend this restaurant for a delicious relaxing meal."

If we had had a little bit more time, I might have ordered something else or some appetizers, but we were content with just getting straight to the real deal.

For two we ordered the spicy pork with gochujang sauce and the beef noodle soup. The spicy pork was a decent size and we recommend ordering with a side of rice. The dish has medium heat and it&#39;s a bit sweet, which I liked. The noodle soup was also delicious because the noodles tasted so fresh!

We actually combined some of the leftover spicy pork sauce to put in the noodle soup. 

Overall, we walked out paying $22 a pop, and while I agree this restaurant has a few expensive items on the menu, the key is to underorder (We were pretty full after just these two dishes) and share everything!

Will be coming back to test out the rest of the menu."

I ate at their sister restaurant, take31 a few months ago and absolutely loved it so I really thought my name is han would be up to par too.

Between three people, we shared the budae jjigae, seafood pancake, and slow cooked pork belly. The budae jjigae was just alright. It wasn&#39;t as flavorful as I expected. The seafood pancake had a strange fishy taste that was way too overwhelming. I had the slow cooked pork at take31 and it was delicious so I thought it would be similar, but it was really disappointing. It wasn&#39;t very fragrant and to be honest, really tasteless. We also ordered the cocktails (lychee and thank you berry much) and they are delicious! And only $7.

We were there in the summer, so I&#39;m not sure if it was seasonal. 

The server explained everything and was really friendly and helpful - service overall was really pleasant, which is sometimes the missing element in those mom &amp; pop Korean restaurants (of course, there is a different kind of place, but you know what I mean). We had the Han Bossam, and a bibimbap dish. Everything was hot, seasoned well, and rode that balance between home cooked authentic, and updated classic. We enjoyed everything.

The noodles are really soft rice noodles so don&#39;t expect really chewy noodles. 

The big downside to this restaurant is all the dishes come all at once!!! Way too fast. They should at least split up the dishes so they come two separate times.

However, the ambience could use a little more work. Like they went through all the trouble of making the place look like a library/refurbished furnitures with sewing machine legs but they didn&#39;t consider that the lamp cord for each of the tables against the wall were an eye sore climbing up to an outlet above each table! Like seriously? You had all the money to make those outlets be located above each table but couldn&#39;t find a way to be discreet about hiding the eye sore cords or the outlets themselves??? Who the heck designed this nonsense? Seriously folks, have you heard of extension cords??? And to be honest, each of the non-matching library lamps are just ugly. Like why would you put those lamps at the table?  It doesn&#39;t make sense. Am I eating at a library???  Idk if you ran out of budget to finish the design scheme appropriately, but details details details!! 

If their cords and outlets were smartly designed, then I think this restaurant would have been considered a cozy ambience. But with their current &#34;after thought&#34; sort of design, I get the feeling that the owner is NOT smart and CHEAP."

Came here with 2 friends on a Thursday at 2pm. We got seated immediately and the decor of the place was delightful. They have these old-fashioned spotlights, plants and pretty lights in the back. 

I ordered the Bulgogi Bapsang which is a lunch set. It came with bulgogi, white rice, spicy kimchi soup and four tiny sides. The sides I got were kimchi, sliced potato salad, this sweet tofu thing? and something mysterious. Nothing to write home about but good for tasting.

The bulgogi was delicious though! So tender and marinade was spot on. Left the restaurant not stuffed but not hungry either. Would highly recommend for a Korean lunch fix and to avoid the usual evening K-town crowds."

My friend and I shared the budae jjigae (army stew), which was the perfect comfort food for rainy weather. I liked it better than the one from Pocha. Ingredients tasted more fresh, and it was less salty or heavy feeling.

I got the great good grape cocktail, and it was very refreshing. Would get it again. 

Service was excellent. Everyone was super friendly, from the hostess to all of the servers.

Definitely coming back to try the other dishes. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to make it for the lunch specials sometime."

The brunch menu is not as extensive as the dinner menu, but definitely offers something for everyone, including people with dietary restrictions. 

I got the salmon brunch option, which was a piece of grilled salmon, served with rice, salad, miso soup, and six little side dishes. My favourite side dish was this soft-boiled egg that was breaded on the outside - SO GOOD! I really really loved this meal. For 15 dollars, I got a really good mix of food and the portion was decent but not too big so I was uncomfortably stuffed by the end. The atmosphere at this restaurant is also super hip and cute. 

I would come back again for lunch or for dinner. Would be a great spot for catching up with friends or even a date."

Admittedly, making an Eminem reference probably isn&#39;t the most fitting for HNIH but I had to. Her name is Han... and she is a mega hipster. Straight outta Brooklyn but got gentrified back into Manhattan.

The vibes here... am I in LA&#39;s Silver Lake? Williamsburg/Crown Heights? Unclear. The wait staff are wearing apron&#39;s straight out of pinterest. The menus has diagrams. Is there conventional lighting anywhere in this spot? It&#39;s hipster modern with a Korean spin. I was an intrigued as I was judge-y.. 

The portion are huge, especially for the Manhattan price point. My friend and i were more than full by the time we left... with leftovers. We ended up getting the pork ribs and a seafood stew. It was flavorful, true to Korean flavors with an American spin.

The biggest selling point for me: $6 cocktail. Yeah, you read that right. No, I did not leave off a number. While they are not high in alcohol content, it&#39;s a nice spot to just 

That&#39;s the biggest thing HNIH has for it... it&#39;s original. In a very hipster way. Check it out. It&#39;s worth the small wait."

Staff are very courteous and kind; there&#39;s usually a wait and gaggle of Asians outside and they patiently explain wait time and take your name down for a waitlist. My waiters always fastidiously explained anything we were curious about on the menu and always described each of the banchans they brought out (good for my non-korean foodmates).

I recommend crispy baby octopi and bulgogi.

While there was always a wait and they never seat you until your entire party is there, the food is worth it! While most people think of Korean BBQ when they think of Korean cuisine, Her Name is Han is the new kid on the block bringing REAL home-style Korean food to our mouths. Kamsa-hamnida! 

My favorite dish is a Jeongol, which is a stew or casserole. 

Order the C7 (thank goodness they numbered their dishes because I can&#39;t read or speak Korean) - Chicken, Daikon, Potato, Bok Choy, Potato Noodles in spicy chicken broth to share with a group of 3-4 people = $25.95. I don&#39;t think I can ever come here and not order this dish. It&#39;s such a comfort food and really soothes my soul. 

You won&#39;t regret it. And if you don&#39;t like it, well, I&#39;m sorry but we just can&#39;t be friends. 

Of course, order other stuff like any of the fire-grill meat dishes: beef, pork belly, pork, chicken (D1, D2, D3, D4) and anything from the small plates menu: dumplings, salmon/cucumber noodles, octopus, rice cake (A1 - A4)

Cute ambiance. Great place for a date night or family style dinner with friends!

Enjoy!"

You have the old school library lamps on one side and bright studio lights on the other - the decor is on point. 

They have several set menus for lunch. We had the corn cream croquettes and fried chicken to share and I had the salmon avocado platter. Everyone raves about the croquettes and I have to admit that I did enjoy them as well. It came in two pieces and the creamy, crunchy texture had me wanting more. The platter is very hearty and wholesome - they didn&#39;t have steamed vegetable rice that day so I opted for white rice and it literally came in a heart... - you get a salad, soup, pickled okra and these avocado fries. They were lightly fried in tempura batter and the inside was still perfectly soft. Same goes with the fried chicken. No grease.

Dinner was on par. For a party of four we had the bossam, dakkjang jungol, fire grilled beef, and kalguksu to share. We loved everything. Strong flavors but not overpowering. Thank goodness nothing was too salty! It came with a fair amount of side dishes, though not a crazy assortment like some KBBQ places or BCD. The bossam was just fatty enough and the sauces went well with it. Service was a bit slow when we asked for more banchan, but the pacing was just fine. I really liked the makgeolli tiramisu, too. A bit too sweet at first then the subtle rice wine flavor grows on you. Perfect size to share with another person after all the food we had.

They are cash only during lunch but do take cards during dinnertime. I heard the wait time can be quite long for dinner especially on a Friday night (as expected), but I&#39;ve gotten lucky during lunch hours and only waited 15-20 mins for a Tuesday dinner. Worth up to a 30 minute wait, this is as comforting as Korean comfort food can get."

The hostess asked if we had reservations, and although we didn&#39;t, she was able to seat us immediately. All the servers were  very attentive and friendly. Our water cups never went empty and there was always a smile on their faces. 

Food - Between the 3 of us, we shared the CLAM JAPJAE (~$10) and SEAFOOD AND DUMPLING HOTPOT (~$25). We really liked the clam japjae, it came with lots of clams and the noodles itself were flavorful. The seafood hotpot came with (a few) shrimps, mussels, mushroom, and lots of clams and sea squirt - be careful with the sea squirt! We didn&#39;t know what that little brain-like thing was in our hot pot, so my friend was going in with her chopsticks to cut it in half to try it but it SQUIRTED right into her hair! I then asked the waiter what it was and he told me the name and that it&#39;s a hit or miss. 

Drink - Fizzy Jalapeño ($6) was pretty darn good! It&#39;s soju (perhaps with carbonated water) and fresh slices of jalapeños and a lime wedge."

We got the beef something appetizer, flavor was good because I love sesame dressing. However there were only few pieces of beef, mainly veggie and onion, a bit disappointed.

The seafood hotpot did not meet my expectation as well, it wasn&#39;t flavorful nor spicy.. Feels more like water down spicy soup.."

The food here was pretty good. We had the seafood pancake which I thought was awesome. We also had the Mixed Stew. It was C6. It was a little salty but I loved it and so did my GF.  

The only reason why I give 4 stars is because the cocktails are pretty weak and the beer is almost a brewery sample size. When I order a draft beer in NYC, I don&#39;t expect Spain Caña size. For $5, I say it&#39;s on the &#34;pricey&#34; side. Other than that, service was great and I liked the restaurant itself. I would definitely recommend it to friends."

Pro-tips: Always get the dumpling set - $1 for a dumpling, worth it; try the creamed corn croquettes.

Dolsot bibimbap, SOOOOO DELICIOUS. I never had such a yummy bibimbap. The greens wasn&#39;t dry and had a good texture. Don&#39;t recall if there was a meat option but regardless, I&#39;D COME BACK FOR IT.

SLOW COOKED PORK BELLY. I had it with pickled bell sprouts. DELICIOUS GOODNESS. SOOOO YUMMY. Words won&#39;t explain it.

Mungbean pancake because I couldn&#39;t eat the other pancake with peppers.. SOO CRISPY. It was awesome.

Turns out there was a last-minute dinner cancellation so we were actually seated in less than 5 minutes.

We ordered a bottle of the grapefruit sowuju, mung bean and pork pancake, slow-cooked pork belly, and seafood stew and shared everything. The grapefruit sowuju was surprisingly good - you can definitely taste the soju but they mix it really well so that the drink tastes pretty sweet instead of the sour grapefruit I was expecting. They also include pieces of grapefruit in the bottle.

The pancake was crispy and tasty. The pork belly was incredibly flavorful. It also came with two sauces to dip in: a sweet and spicy one and a garlicky one. My favorite was the seafood stew though, which contained mussels, clams, shrimp, fish balls, ramen, rice cakes, and japchae, all in a simmering sweet and spicy broth.

Everything was so filling that we couldn&#39;t finish. Our total came out to ~$40 per person. It&#39;s a bit on the pricier end but the food and cute atmosphere of the place makes it worth it. I&#39;d definitely come back again to try their many other menu options."

The food was fantastic! I got the cold noodles; never tasted anything like it. The noodles were so chewy and soft and the sesame sauce was sweet and nutty. I would totally recommend this dish. The kimchi they served was so good i asked for three more!

What kept me from lowering the rating was the authenticity of food. We tried the fried chicken and the three-type sausage stew with kimchi and mushroom, accompanied by blueberry housemade soju. I wish there could be more vegetables inside the stew...Fried chicken was crispy and juicy. Would try the seafood pot next time, but I do wish they could increase their portion size."

I tried coming for dinner on a Friday night and it was packed, so I left and tried again for lunch on a Tuesday. When I got there around noon, it wasn&#39;t too crowded yet so we were seated immediately.

Initially I wanted to try the cold noodles (kalguksu) but I ended up going with a lunch set that had fried chicken and vegetable steamed rice. I also shared an order of avocado fries and KFC with my group and was underwhelmed by both. The avocado was underripe and the texture was similar to pumpkin or sweet potato. The KFC was just okay. I was expecting wings but they turned out to be boneless pieces of chicken, very similar to Japanese karaage. I didn&#39;t really like the sauce that it came with. It was oddly sweet and not spicy.

It turns out the fried chicken that was in my lunch set was the exact same chicken as the KFC; if I had known that I probably wouldn&#39;t have ordered the appetizer since I had to deal with two portions of mediocre karaage. The vegetable steamed rice was kind of bland and reminded me of baby food lol. It had pumpkin and carrot in it. Very soft and mushy. My boyfriend got the curry which was decent but it&#39;s hard to mess up curry imo, esp if you&#39;re just using Japanese curry roux.

For smaller parties, the wait was a lot less. Even though it was prime dinner time on Saturday, parties of 2-3 were seated within minutes. 

As a party of ten, we ordered family style. We easily went through half of the menu. Some of the highlights were the bulgogi and pork belly. My friend doesn&#39;t eat red meat, and she was able to find nice vegetarian dishes.

Granted, Mew is Japanese and HNIH is Korean, but everything from the Asian hipster decor to the printed menu, daily specials, $10-and-less price range, and CASH-ONLY policy smacks of that other great Midtown lunch spot.

HNIH is blissfully relaxed during lunch hours, but really packs in the crowds at night, from what I&#39;ve seen. Maybe it&#39;s the partially obstructed street view due to adjacent construction, but I kind of hope it doesn&#39;t spin out of control after Time Out, Eater, and other foodie rags sink their teeth it. Han should remain a jewel for us Midtown workaday schlubs. Alas, the quality of the food suggest a different fate.

On my first visit with Korean-loving coworkers, I went for the fire-grilled chicken bapsang lunch special. The chicken was chopped with homemade garlic crumbs, grilled in a subtle sweet sauce. It came with 3 or 4 banchan selections, including dried anchovies and some high-quality kimchee, a bowl of rice, and a bowl of miso soup.

My friends had equally awesome dishes: bulgogi quinoa salad and sweet and sour chicken fried rice. Yum.

But the absolute toppers were the dumplings and amazing K.F.C. (Korean Fried Chicken). I could get a bucket of those and die a happy man. Three a man had to do.

Return visits are definitely in order--there is much to try."

I was craving some Bossam and we looked up places that had the dish on the menu and found ourselves at Her name is Han.

To be honest, calling the dish Bossam was a bit of a stretch as they did not provide lettuce as is tradition. Nevertheless, the pork was excellent and the pickled radish was better than average.

Definitely stop on by if you are in the area, the wait was not too bad walking in on a Friday night."

The service was pretty good, with the exception of them making me wait outside before getting seated in the cold because my friend wasn&#39;t here yet (and there was literally nobody sitting in the restaurant!!!) 

I got the popular pork belly dish to share and also the seafood soup. The pork belly was bomb--it melts in your mouth, but the seafood soup was meh. Probably will order the noodles next time if I come as I hear it&#39;s handmade."

I have only been to this spot for lunch but I will literally walk the 4 avenues from the west side of Manhattan with no complaints! Its a welcoming addition to midtown spots that hits that Korean food craving perfectly without having to deal with the chaos and stress of Korea town.

The food is fantastic. Everything is so fresh and made with love... with a very homey charm with delicious authentic flavors. The portion sizing is perfect for you to enjoy and not feel like you need to roll out of the restaurant or feel like you&#39;ll be hungry in 2 hours. The plating is the cutest and nice clean and simple. And the prices are on point and very fair. Keep in mind, this is a CASH ONLY spot. (chase and Citibank walkable to Park avenue)

The decor is super rustic and cute... a great date night spot or for a small group. Seriously dont go with a group larger than 6 at MOST... You&#39;ll end up waiting because most tables are sized for 2-4 people with only 2 larger tables.

The food and especially the service was great. I don&#39;t think anywhere else gave me the level of attention and just willingness to help. Huge thumbs up to our waiter that day. 

I ordered rice and spicy pork from the lunch menu. It is honestly pretty basic and simple but that&#39;s what I wanted and it was good! To add, it was pretty filling. I could barely walk from how full I was.

We ordered C4 (boiled beg slices, tendon soup w onikn, lemon, mustard sauce) &amp; E4 (9 seasoned veg on rice). Both dishes are very high quality &amp; medium portions.

I read about this little gem on a food blog and just knew that I had to try it out. This sister restaurant to take31 is soo adorable and less dive-y feeling than its counterpart. The decor is much brighter and the space is more open.  

After perusing the menu online, I decided to stop by for lunch. I walked by a little early (around 11:51AM) and it was still closed. I came back a little later (around 12:02PM) and it was already bustling with the lunchtime crowd. I guess everyone tries to beat the lunchtime traffic..

Service is quick and friendly. I was in and out of there in under 30 minutes. All of the lunch items are very reasonably priced (I believe each entree/lunch set is $10 or less). I had a really hard time deciding between the bapsang lunch special and the salmon avocado platter, but I ended up going with the bapsang. The chicken was suuuper tasty and tender. The selection of side dishes wasn&#39;t super impressive, but it was a nice array, and the soup was just what I needed to warm up my belly. :9 Next time, I will be back to try the platters!

Cash only, so hit up an ATM before heading over. The great thing about paying with cash though is that you can leave it on the table and head out if you are in a rush - no need to wait for your bill or for them to process your credit card! Plus tax and tip, I paid $13, which is pricey for lunch, but definitely well worth it for a relaxing and enjoyable meal!"

The food was pretty good. We got the budae jigae and the seafood hot pot, everyone preferred the budae jigae over the seafood pot (the seafood soup was lukewarm and we kept trying to heat it up). Their budae jigae isn&#39;t as spicy as some other places make it but I think it&#39;s good. 

The only downside is the wait is sooo long! But that&#39;s expected in ktown. We waited at least 30 minutes before we got our seats. So put your name down right away when you get there! They won&#39;t seat you until your full party is there."

It wasnt a long wait but I was surprised that there were that many people on a weekday. This place was worth the wait. We ordered the famous (sausage, noodles, cheese) stew &amp; another dish forgot name but was shiso wrapped rice with sesame seeds &amp; vinegar like sushi wrap but with shiso &amp; sesame seeds + oil in the rice braised with a sweet sauce. &amp; with a side bulgogi where you can eat together or separate, how you like. Both of the dishes were really delicious and highly recommend them. Specially the stew one, the base was super good. I was a expecting the stew to be bigger &amp; came to be a little smaller for the price $32. It&#39;s a little pricy for the size that you get so was a little disappointed. You can share among 2-3people that are not very hungry. I just wish there could be more ramen to it. Overall, was really good.
For dessert we decided to try the sake or soju tiramisu, forgot name but the alcohol was there in the cream but the bottom layer was not that great. Don&#39;t really recommend it unless you just like me want to try it. I ordered just to try it since haven&#39;t seen it anywhere else. The size of the desserts are pretty deceiving, they are very tiny &amp; consider expensive for the price. The cup of this dessert is like the size of a tiny candle. The other dessert we order was green tea cheesecake, it was not the best I tried. Would say was okay to really bad for a cheesecake. Maybe it just me with higher standards but the cheesecake was not fluffy enough, was a little hard. But Flavor was there, it tasted like green tea pocky. I would say this is not the best choice for dessert, it is relatively small &amp; very expensive for the size. Totally not worth eating dessert here. Would really not recommend their desserts. Not really because of the price but also what you getting. 
The reason I gave five stars was because of the stew was really good, the food is super good. Highly recommend this place but not dessert."

To our surprise, this place had a line before the restaurant opened for dinner service. That is a good sign right? After seeing raving reviews, I knew I had to give this spot a try. My party was one of the first groups to be seated on a Saturday evening. The vintage decor is mesmerizing and lighting is romantically dimmed. It really reminds me of a secret society and where only elite members are allowed like in dramas. 

My girls started off with drinks the Apple Sangria and the Lychee Sparkling. Both were really sweet and tasty drinks, not to mention $6.00 was a fair deal. We wanted to get the Grapefruit Soju but was told that we will have to come back in two to three months. They have just ran out and in the process of making it. Love to hear that the soju is homemade and fresh best time we visit. 

Our first and most successful dish was the barbecue marinated short ribs. It was cooked so perfectly tender. We really enjoyed the sweetness of the marinated sauce. Kimchi &amp; Pork Stew always hits the spot for their pork just melts in your mouth. Other dishes we tried were the Country Fried Chicken, where once again the meat was super tender but tasted bland even with the red sauce and salt pepper condiments. The Pork Stew which had bacon, hot dog, spam, ham, ramen noodles, rice cake, and topped with a bit of cheese was okay. The least successful dish would be the Clam Glass Noodles. This was extremely dry which made it very unpleasant to eat overall. Taste-wise is quite boring for I can produce a similar rice noodle dish at home with scallions, onions, and red pepper at home. 

I was disappointed in my food experiences here. To sum it up, cocktails and meats are their strengths. I&#39;ll be back for the grapefruit soju and the barbecue meats."

The soup was great but the noodles were mediocre and there were just a few clams and one shrimp in my dish.  I was desirous of more seafood and veggies.  The kimchi was also not fermented enough and lacked sparkle.  Overall it was an ok experience for the price.  I will give it another chance as it is such a close lunch option.

Pros:

For two people, we ordered four things:
1. dumplings - there was a generous amount of filling but it was too bland for my taste. It does come with a vinaigrette kind of sauce but it didn&#39;t help much. 
2. clams with noodles - AMAZING! I loved the flavors, savory with a hint of clam. The noodles were perfectly cooked, not soggy or mushy. 
3. pork belly platter - delicious! I especially liked the buttery sauce that came with it. It paired really well with the meat.
4. rice cake - I loved the flavors! Sometimes I don&#39;t like Korean rice cake dishes because the spicyness can be too overpowering. But this one was perfect! 

If you checked in using Yelp, you get a free beer! Service was great! Although the wait can be crazy during dinner times, it is totally worth it. Only thing is - portions are tiny - making each dish a little pricey. But once in a while, I don&#39;t mind!"

Won ton noodles you can pass. The broth was nice since I was in the mood for soup but the noodles and won ton could be improved.

WONTONS!

I first came to this little spot because I was hungry and didn&#39;t want to spend more than $6. Also, I initially thought I&#39;d have dessert, but decided I wanted something more savory.

Since then I&#39;ve checked out H K a few times and have stuck to what the place is known for on all occasions. Many of their other menu items look tasty, too, so I&#39;m going to have to mix it up one of these days. The plain wonton soup, which is delicious and filling, costs under $5. You can add a variety of toppings to your soup (noodles, veggies, mushrooms, beef stew, beef tendon, et al.). Regardless of what you get it probably won&#39;t come up to more than $8 or $9.

The waiters here wear Hawaiian shirts, which is a cute touch. Service is just okay. Place has an A inspection grade, whoa! 

There&#39;s a good mix of locals and tourists here. I&#39;d say there&#39;s more locals, thank goodness. The first time I came here I sat next to these two hipsters, one who kept going on about his supposed knowledge of Asian cuisine (because &#34;Asian&#34; best describes Chinese), yet couldn&#39;t tell the difference between the duck and the beef tendon when it came to his table.

Service here was terrible - maybe because I expected it to be bad. Almost 100% of the time, the service I get at hole-in-the-wall/family-owned Asian restaurants is incredibly subpar to the point to where employees just simply disrespect you. When I walked in, the restaurant was half empty -- or half full if you&#39;re positive! It was my last day in New York, so I was dragging my luggage around. I wasn&#39;t event carrying that much. It was just my backpack and a carry-on luggage. I sat at a 4-person table because it was kind of away from restaurant traffic in a corner. The guy, who would be my server, yelled at me and pointed to a smaller table. I mean, I understand, but there were several other vacant 4-seated tables. 

When I asked for water, my server complied with a snarl. He never smiled. He just seemed grouchy with me. Seriously, I don&#39;t now what his problem is. I kept a to-go menu as a piece of memorabilia, and without asking, he snatched it from my table and passive aggressively placed it to its original location. Okay, whatever. Take it. I don&#39;t think I should ever use that menu again. 

Okay onto the food: 
The beef noodle casserole was okay. Wontons were pathetic. Look at the photos I posted. Only one spec of a shrimp per wonton. Oh, and when I asked for chopsticks, they are kind of unsanitary with it. Another employee touched both ends of the chopsticks with his bare hands when he handed them to me. Gross. Well, if one were actually in China, there is no such thing as sanitary, so I guess what just happened is an authentic China experience."

We ordered 3 wonton noodles with roast pork and duck, chicken feet (dimsum dish), shu mai - pork dumplings (dimsum dish), tripe with noodles, and squid with dry noodles. The waiter asked if there was a 4th person coming, we told him no then he asked why we ordered so much...my friend pointed at me and said &#34;She&#39;s hungry&#34;.

I was super hungry but it was a decent amount of food. I enjoyed the wonton noodles with pork and duck. The shu mai was good too- decent amount of shrimp and pork. The chicken feet was too soggy. The tripe with noodles came with more noodles than tripe but it was decent. I was not a fan of the squid. 

I recommend the wonton noodles with roast pork and duck!"

The sesame chicken (all white meat) also tasted very clean and didn&#39;t have that leftover, twice-fried look that some takeout Chinese food has.

Unfortunately, I had the most terrible bout of MSG poisoning after eating here. I had a slight headache about 10 minutes after walking out of the restaurant, and that was followed by about 3-4 hours of nonstop nausea and throbbing headaches.

My guess is that the soup base of the noodles had too much MSG in it. My boyfriend picked up the taste while we were eating, but I brushed it off and paid the price.

I wanted to love this place so much. Perhaps I&#39;ll try it again one day."

We ordered a bowl of pork and big wontons in noodle soup and were very happy. The soup was savory, the noodles cooked al dente, the pork was tasty (though 1-2 pieces were chewy) and the wontons - superb!!   These were large, the noodle wrapping not too thick, the meat inside, very flavorful and huge portion. Well done! 

We didn&#39;t expect much here, but truth be told, we&#39;ll be back to try other things.  It was pretty busy, with lots of local Chinese customers. 

I read many of the reviews here that said the service was poor.  Our server was fine - not an overly friendly or chatty fellow, but was quick to return to take our order, brought our to-go item bagged and ready. Food came fairly quickly and as others have noted, it was a &#34;dump and go&#34; type delivery to the table.  In the end, we did not have any complaints about service here.

The broth was also good. Not too salty or greasy. I like to add red vinegar to my soups because it kicks the flavor up a notch.

Wontons are like the Chinese version of pizza. A somewhat over-hyped, simple dish with lots of competition and claims to fame. However, as anyone knows, when you happen to be in the mood for wontons (or pizza) they are like manna from heaven.

The wontons are very well made and the meat was tasty.

I ordered the wonton soup with noodles and a side order of special vegetables with oyster sauce.  I&#39;ve been back many times and I always order the same thing because I literally LOVE it. So simple but sooo good!

Over the years, I&#39;ve talked about HK Wonton so much, that my family has an inside joke about it. I finally took my little sisters (ages 14 &amp; 17) here last weekend so they can experience the yummy wonton and noodle goodness for themselves.  So this is what happened:

Leah ordered the noodle soup with wonton and roasted chicken. The chicken came in strips sprinkled on top. It was epic; I think I&#39;ll get that next time. 

Tiffany stuck to the basics and ordered the noodle soup with wonton.  

I ordered the noodle soup with wonton and fish balls. It was my first time having fish balls anywhere, ever. It was tasty but I didn&#39;t fancy the texture too much. I&#39;m glad I tried it but I&#39;ll skip it for next time. Tiffany and I shared an order of special vegetables with oyster sauce.

The verdict: It was worth all of my hype! My sisters both agreed that I wasn&#39;t exaggerating about how awesome the food is here.

A few things to note about the establishment and the service: 
The restaurant is clean, bright, cozy, and wallpapered with foreign currency.
They wear Hawaiian themed shirts, which is awesome. 
Our food came out very quickly.
Tip was included in our bill, even tough it was only three of us dining in. The total was around $28, including the tip (Tip is not included for takeout orders)."

They always taste fresh and home made, so if you go here definitely try them. I recommend the stewed noodles with wontons and dumplings because it is phenomenal. 

Cons: The service is ABYSMALLY rude...I was never expecting friendliness but there&#39;s a difference between neutral and down right rude service. Also, watch out when you pay because they include tip at the bottom and try to hide it by writing roughly and in Chinese with a small &#34;sc&#34; next to it. I don&#39;t know why they would have service included when they only really serve you by roughly dumping your plate anywhere on the table and then just walking on without a word. No thank yous, no acnowedgmenets if you thank them...if you hand them more cash than you owe do NOT expect them to give you change. 

I continue to go here because every time without fail, the food is delicious. However I only order take out nowadays because I was sick of feeling like a transaction rather than a paying customer."

My date ordered 2 orders of 2 char siu bao and 1 order of shumai.  We ordered a single dish of the beef with mixed vegetables and a &#34;special side order&#34; of mushrooms with vegetable.  He had a soda, I asked for water. 
We were brought a soda and a bottle of water.  This made me sad because it meant I couldn&#39;t drink as much as I wanted, as it would be limited to the bottle.  It also meant I would be paying for my water.  The annoying table next to me was asking for sparkling water, then INSISTING on sparkling water, which was not available.  They were then given tap water, which is what I wanted.

The Char Siu Bao weren&#39;t the baked kind.  They were the small steamed kind, and 4 should have been a single order for the size.  You got six shumai.  I always feel shumai are a ripoff for the price, and this was no exception.  He said they were good.  
The people who worked there started a conversation without moving closer to eachother - one was yelling from the kitchen opening and the other was yelling from the cash register.  I was seated at the back next to the kitchen opening.  The person came out of the kitchen and stood directly over me to yell at the other one.

The side of mushrooms was a bowl of mushrooms with chinese broccoli at the bottom.  Very plump mushrooms in a thick sauce.  Much like the one at Wo Hop, which costs more but you get a ton more.  Good but gloopy for our tastes.  We were not given rice, nor offered rice.  We had to ask for it, and were probably charged for it.

I wanted to order the Beef with Broccoli, as I&#39;ve seen photos of it there on yelp served over fried noodles.  It had everything i was looking for - beef, a green, straw mushrooms, and carrots.  Before ordering, I asked if the Beef with broccoli had other vegetables in it too.  The waiter said no.  He did not make any suggestion, so I ordered the Beef with Mixed Vegetables.  This is a dish I usually get for $6 at lunch or $10 at dinner.  It was about $15 here and was, again, a big gloopy mess.  The vegetables were good, but too many onions for a premium dish.  The meat looked like watery dishrags, but it tasted tender and didn&#39;t have gnarled bits in it.  Nothing was crispy.  
I&#39;m not a stickler about service, but these folks were both inattentive and intrusive at the same time.  I couldn&#39;t get help when I needed it, but I couldn&#39;t get them to leave me alone when I needed alone time.  They were doing something weird with the bathroom, it was all in Chinese.  The one guy went in there with a mop but wasn&#39;t cleaning it, he was opening the door over and over to yell back at the other employees.  I couldn&#39;t get in there.  When he came out, another employee went in, and then the mop guy went back.  Probably because they&#39;d been doing something with the mop, the toilet seat was covered in dirty water.  I couldn&#39;t hear my own conversation because of the yelling around us while we ate. Yet, when it was time to sign my credit card slip, the waiter pulled it from under me (I had stood up and placed my bag on the table, was fixing my pants and getting ready to go).  The bill was enormously high for having a single entree - $40.  Again, that&#39;s $40 before tip for:
10 pcs dim sum
1 small vegetable side
1 entree
2 sodas

After we ate, my date noticed they had won &#34;Best Chow Mein in NYC&#34;.  He said that it made sense, that they could make that type of antiquated dish.  They&#39;d do well at something with a thick, viscous sauce.  Is this kind of sauce a Cantonese thing?  I felt robbed as he was still hungry and I didn&#39;t get much to eat for the money.  Now, reading here, I see that they added the tip in already, without telling you - and to think I felt guilty for not leaving more!  Now I wish I&#39;d left no tip, since they&#39;d already built it in to the bill.  The bill was all in Chinese, so I had no way of knowing where I&#39;d been overcharged. If we&#39;d gone to Noodletown, this would have seriously cost half of the price...and it would have been delicious. Not happy at all."

Well done guys.

I came here after checking in initially into another Asian dining place BUT in efforts to shake my &#34;followers&#34; and/or &#34;fans&#34;, I did a little quick check-in and head on out to the real destination.  I could be hallucinating or just paranoid BUT I trust my spidey sense more than most people.

This place is pretty small but can still accommodate  20 people at a time easily.  This place was pretty darn clean.  I repeat.  THIS PLACE WAS PRETTY DARN CLEAN.  Being an Asian restaurant AND located around Canal street can bring on unmentionable filth but this restaurant was CLEAN.  Heck, I&#39;d come back just knowing that I won&#39;t be seating on sticky seats GLADLY.

I was indecisive on what I wanted to eat and as I sort through many pictures posted by other Yelpers who have dined here previously, I had some idea.

Eventually I went with S17 (Beef Stew with wontons and Shanghai noodles).  I loved this dish.  The size was good.  Would I have liked it more if the portions were bigger?  Absolutely.  But for what it was it was filling and tasty.   The beef stew were mostly tender and flavorful except those few extra fatty pieces that you had to bite off.  The worse are the beef stew pieces that are sandwiched in between 2 extra fatty layers.  Very hard to bite that off cleanly.  The wontons consisted of shrimp &amp; minced beef fillings.  The skin of the wontons left much to be desired as I&#39;m one of those people who like thin wonton skins to avoid feeling like I was eating what seemed like a bunch of noodles stacked together in the shape of a wonton each time I took a bite.  Even so this is quite the go to dish and don&#39;t let my criticism deter you from ordering this.  ORDER THIS.

I was pretty starving so as an insurance policy I also ordered the D11 which is minced chicken congee.  Mmm...just like granny used to make when I was a child.  The congee came practically overflowing out of the bowl which I didn&#39;t mind.  The chicken was tasty.  The ginger slices were tasty.  And the congee was the right balance of saltiness to neutral that makes congee such an excellent dish to have in the mornings.  Except, I was eating it at night. 

WHOOPS.

Hey!  If IHOP can served pancakes at night and have people eat it, I can eat congee at night as well.

Service was on point even though they barely acknowledge you with a smile or words.  

The ONE thing that they really do need improvement on?  Lower the volume in which they scream Cantonese across the dining area where people are trying to eat their meals.  I understand that Cantonese is supposed to sound like a bunch of angry men using strong air gestures and not giving an EFF BUT I happen to understand Cantonese and believe me it wasn&#39;t the State of the Union address translated.  

I would definitely make a trip just to come here or if I&#39;m around the area, which is the more likely scenario.

But the price is right, the food is filling, and the service is no nonsense.

The menu is easy enough to navigate. There are noodles, noodles, soup noodles, pan fried noodles, and more noodles. They&#39;re topped with your choice of a dozen or so toppings: soy sauce chicken, roast duck, braised lamb, stewed beef, beef tendon, bean curd, squid or shrimp, and more. All their noodle dishes are between $5 and $9 and will fill you up. The meats tend to be a little dry because of the extended cooking times, but that may have been because I came late at night. The noodles are normal egg or rice noodles, nothing special, and the broth is slightly reminiscent of a thin chicken or beef broth, but you can&#39;t complain given the amount of food for that price.

The more ambitious entrees, such as fried grouper with mixed vegetables, orange beef, and boi nam steamed chicken work a little better but cost $10-15. One cold night, I had the fried grouper, tender white fish meat on the inside, and a chewy breading outside. It was served with a cornstarch thickened sauce and mixed veggies, such as snow peas, carrots, onions, Chinese broccoli, and red bell pepper. Other entrees are served with equally gooey and thick sauces. Seafood isn&#39;t particularly fresh (I asked if they had live fish and they said they only do frozen). 

If you are nearby and want your Cantonese noodle / wonton fix, check this place out. If you want a real banquet style feast, head to Flushing."

I had it almost everyday when I was in HK last year so I was hoping this would be an adequate replacement.  

The wonton texture and flavor just wasn&#39;t that good.  The beef broth was missing something.  They did give me lots of tendon but bits of it could&#39;ve been more tender.  The noodles were thinner than I&#39;m normally accustomed to and bunched together.

We had the fried pork dumplings and the skin tasted a bit tough.  The choy sum vegetables with oyster sauce were good though.

Overall, a decent place if you have a craving but nothing to come out of the way for."

REVIEW YOUR RECEIPT VERY CAREFULLY. We noticed an unannounced $2.50 service charge (allegedly for using a credit card, but then how did would they know we were using a card for payment when calculating the bill before bringing it to us  ....?) in addition to tax. Now, I would understand that if it was an ANNOUNCED gratuity for large parties but that wasn&#39;t the case. It was just two of us. Mind you, this service charge is nowhere to be found on the menu, wall, display of policies, etc.

Bottom line: What they were attempting to do was extortive, predatory, and illegal. It&#39;s a shame that they try to take advantage of drunk people and those who don&#39;t look at their bill carefully.

I have no issue rewarding waiters with a good tip for good service, but as you see here, there is no honor amongst thieves. 

Shame on you all."

Its hard finding good Cantonese food in Chinatown now.
Many places are gone and Fuzhou places have replaced them.
But this place is the best in Chinatown.

Four stars

Classic Chinese food shop. I walked in held up one finger and sat. The waiter poured me a mug of tea and I ordered char siu tong ho and a wonton mein for myself. The food took a bit longer than usual. The bbq pork was quite good - less salty, less roasted, and less dry. The wide rice noodles were not uniform but delicious. The wonton were a bit small. The egg noodles were straight from the package but still fine. The broth had plenty of umami taste. Overall, a quick, tasty $12 meal. 

They even take credit cards!"

I arrived in NYC late, and had to get my Chinatown fix immediately.  This happens to be the best rated restaurant in Chinatown that is open at midnight, so that&#39;s how I ended up here.  (And surprisingly, about 50% of the tables were full at that hour.)

I ordered the Shanghai noodle soup in chicken broth and hubby got the Shanghai noodles in beef stew (which is the same thing as my order except it&#39;s beef broth).  The Shanghai noodles were thick, yummy, and made on site. I thought my dish was decent, but when I tasted the beef broth, I wish I had ordered that.

As others have mentioned, the employees do not seem to be happy people even though their boss dresses them in Hawaiian shirts. But I can&#39;t really blame them - who would be excited about working at midnight?"

That dish is absolutely phenomenal and simply just the best. I had always been a fan of Wonton Garden ever since I was a little girl when my parents used to bring me to the original restaurant. I was devastated when they closed down, but when they reopened at this new location I just never found time to go because I am never in Chinatown. I am so glad I picked this place for lunch today. The broth was so beefy and delicious, the beef was very tender, and the wontons... well, no where compares! I did find the egg noodles to be overcooked but nonetheless I was a very happy camper with the dish as a whole. Call it nostalgia. :) I did, at one point, bite into a piece of pure fat, it was so gross I had to spit out. 

Don&#39;t expect to come in and be treated like royalty as this has your typical Chinese restaurant kind of atmosphere, no gimmicks kind of place. Just be warned that gratuity is already included in your bill and the handwriting is really bad so you would not notice if you just look at it very quickly.

Since it was lunch time, I searched for the closest decent yelp review joint and found myself inside H K Wonton Garden. After all, hot wonton soup on a cold day can&#39;t go wrong.. or can it. 
I get that the service is expected to be lacking in Chinatown, trust me, I grew up in Beijing, I get it. So I didn&#39;t mind when our waiter waited impatiently at my table while looking around at anything and everything except for us (- don&#39;t come here if you feel you need to be loved). 
I ordered wonton noodle soup and pork chive dumplings. The wonton and dumpling fillings were the disappointing part. For you vegetarians, this is your warning to STOP reading now. The filling was made up of all the meat by-products (AKA scrap meat), like the meat that you don&#39;t even give your dogs and cats. Like all the parts of an animal that is not considered real meat. Think about it.. you got it? Yeah, that meat. One sec while I hurl (not because of the pregnancy).

I have been enjoying the soup here for the longest time, since I was a small child with my mushroom haircut.  My family would ALWAYS come here, eat-in, enjoy the soup, and then take containers and containers of soup home for us to enjoy for the next day or two.  As a note, I was sooo scared back in 2011 when I saw the original location on Mott Street closed.  However, to my excitement, this establishment moved to Mulberry St!

Once you enter H K Wonton Garden, you will notice how much of this place is a &#34;hole in a wall&#34;.  This is a small spot and you will notice many of the workers here wearing a Hawaiian shirt, which they have been wearing consistently over the years.  At the front desk cashier, you can order your take out, or you can decide to dine in.  

As for what I recommend to order, I always get the beef stew and wonton with noddles in soup.  I can never get tired of eating this.  The majority of the soups are less than $9.  I have tried many other different soups which I have enjoyed that include the curry soups, beef tripe, pork, and so on.  Depending on your mood for soup, there is a soup for you here!  Furthermore, if you are looking to get other items that are soup-related, I have tried their fried rice and Peking duck, which I have enjoyed.  My personal favorite non-soup dish here though is their pan-fried noodles.  

As a note, when you do order the soup, it comes here within minutes, which is a plus.  The decor here is simple and to the point, which is what you should realize once you enter H K Wonton Garden.

Oh and I can tell a bunch of Filipinos still come here, they always talk to me in their limited knowledge of Tagalog when I leave!"

I ordered the veggie dumpling and noodle soup, I received a veggie dumpling soup, but I was able to steal some noodles out of my daughter&#39;s soup so it worked.  

The veggie dumplings were divine, but very large.  They broke up in the soup, but I didn&#39;t mind.  It added to the broth.  They have several condiments on the table so I was able to season the broth up exactly how I like it.

Clean place, quick friendly service and they take credit cards.  Definitely winner."

I read an interesting article about the best wontons in Chinatown the other day and I decided to test the validity of it. For a place with the word wonton in its name, you would think that it would be the champion of the little round dumplings but I was greatly disappointed. A group of friends and I ordered their wonton noodle soup

Wonton Noodle Soup ($4.50) - They give a tiny bowl of egg noodles with 5 wontons. The broth was bland and had a huge scent of sesame oil. As you can tell by the picture, the shine in the soup and noodles is a giveaway of the amount of oil. The wontons tasted fine but I was bothered by the chewy, clumped-together skin. Wonton skin is supposed to be slippery and waving around in the soup. These were like chunks of dough with little meat. They almost resembled Siu Mai. Obviously their wontons were frozen and not fresh. (5/10)

The good thing about HK Wonton Garden is that the items are not pricey. At $4.50 a bowl, it is quick and cheap meal."

Since &#34;Wonton&#34; is in their name, one would anticipate that it&#39;ll be a large selling point. I ordered their wonton noodle soup and it wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had in Chinatown. It was decent to okay but I wouldn&#39;t name a restaurant after an item that&#39;s only done decent to okay. The skin on the wontons were thick and heavy. The meat filling was a tab bit bland and there was no shrimp or at least not much. I really wanted to like it but it didn&#39;t work for me. 

Aside from their failed wonton, they have rice dishes too and those are comparable to any restaurant nearby the area.  It&#39;s a good place for lunch but it&#39;s small and they usually rush you out so its not a sit and relax sort of place. Considering all factors of the restaurant, I can only rate it to be decent to okay."

This was the second visit for my family &amp; I to this Chinatown eatery with the same reaction from all of us, YUMMMMMM. We ordered a few soups which we liked the last time. I must say, they are very consistent in the items they serve. They were exactly the same. We had the Ho-Fen Wonton Soup with 3 types of Mushrooms &amp; the Wonton Soup with sliced roast pork. These soups were amazing. I loved the broth base on both of then. My youngest child was in heaven over all the mushrooms. For the main courses we absolutely loved the noodle dish with the sliced pork &amp; roast duck. The thin noodle had just the right amount of flavor from a sauce ( I think Oyster Sauce ) that they used as a bed for the pork/duck. The second main was a more conventional &#34;Americanized&#34; Chinese dish that was prepared perfectly. We had Sesame Chicken. It was excellent. The sweet sauce held it viscosity and stayed thick even though it was hot, and even better, this restaurant didn&#39;t skimp on the Broccoli . Most places that I go to serve it with only 2 or 3 florets. I was impressed at the portion size for Manhattan !! I always look to my children for help in rating restaurants &amp; I would have rated them a 4 1/2 Star but it could only be a 4 or 5 on Yelp. The food is 5 Stars which is the most important fact !! The value is also 5 Stars in my opinion, very inexpensive, but don&#39;t tell the owners, they&#39;ll raise the prices, HaHa !! The ambiance is only a 3 Star. It&#39;s not their fault, but the size of the restaurant is very small &amp; there&#39;s not much you can do to improve that, I&#39;m sure rent is astronomical. So in consulting my 2 little critics, we agreed that a fair rating for H.K. Wonton Garden added up to a 4 Star from us!! VERY VERY RESPECTABLE !! I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this restaurant to people."

I do agree that quality has dropped over the years (OPEN since 1978!) but I still like their soup base (despite knowing its filled with MSG) and it&#39;s a decent to go place if you&#39;re in the area late night for a bite pre/post likely LES outing.

The assorted dumplings are OK and they don&#39;t overcook the noodles. Their chili oil sauce is fine, not spicy. Their beef stew/tendon is pretty good.
I would not recommend the dim sum unless you absolutely have a craving. Overpriced and just frozen/re steamed.

Fried noodle dishes at ~$8-$9 piece is a bargain, especially since you&#39;ll split it between 2 persons.

And they serve Peking Duck even at midnight! Only in NYC :)

*I didn&#39;t get the added SC on my tab, but I did notice they incorrectly priced one of the Shanghai noodle dishes we ordered at $7.75 vs $5.75 (think it was an honest 1:30am mistake) and they immediately corrected and returned. So just double check your bill since all in Chinese!

The curried chicken w rice was ok. And the fried pieces of fish mixed w veggies in a brown sauce was ok. The fish balls were awful. The pork steamed dumplings were exceptional. But my general Tsos chicken was just yuky. Soggy. Oily. Spongy. Fatty. All swimming in a too sweet sauce.

My group of three had 5 dishes:
1. Scallops: the raw scallops tasted very fresh, but I think the roe gave the dish a bitter aftertaste that wasn&#39;t very pleasant. The pomegranate seeds helped a little bit with the bitterness, but definitely this is not a dish I&#39;d be interested in trying again

2. Steak tartare slightly seared: We got two plates of this because my friend who&#39;s been here before said this was very good, and I generally adore steak tartare. However, no more quail eggs on the steak tartare, which really disappointed my friend because that was one of her favorite parts. I think it would have also been better without the searing, and the added sprouts on top didn&#39;t add anything to the dish... I liked the steak tartare enough, but it wasn&#39;t as interesting as I&#39;d hoped based on previous reviewers.

3. Foie gras pops: My husband liked this but I wasn&#39;t a fan. The foie gras in such large chunks was a bit too rich and felt like eating pure fat with the soft liver texture that comes with foie gras. I believe foie gras should be spread on bread and not eaten in large chunks by itself. Otherwise, it&#39;s just too much.

4. Duck confit: My least favorite dish. This one was actually terrible. The soft potatoe texture does not work with the duck meat in the middle. You also end up with large bites of potato. Also, the  truffle smell was very overpowering and made the duck barely existent as part of the dish. I felt like I was eating a potato mash with a unknown meat that had a strong truffle smell (which is stinky because truffles are stinky even though delicious)

5. Salmon butterfly: probably the best dish we had. The salmon was delicious and worked well with the ratatouille. Unfortunately, this dish doesn&#39;t work well with the other tapas... the tomato and pepper flavor doesn&#39;t work with the scallops, steak tartare, duck confit, and foie gras. I think this should just be made into an entree that can be eaten by itself.

Drinks here are great. We each got something different. I don&#39;t think you can go wrong on picking a drink as long as you know which main spirit you like.

I wouldn&#39;t come here for the food. Just the drinks and ambiance. Would be a great after dinner place to hang out, though majority of the space is taken up by the bar. It gets pretty busy later in the night."

I had dinner here on a Thursday and it was very packed. Don&#39;t worry, grab a beer next door at Top Hops while you wait. The only thing that I didn&#39;t like at Excuse my French was the seating. It&#39;s basically a long bar all the way down except for a couple small tables in the front. 

As we seated at the bar, the waitress recommended a nice French red that was very good. We ordered a bunch of tapas for the table. We started with a bunch of cheeses and charcuterie. They paired nicely together especially with a little wine sip. We also ordered the duck rillettes which was probably my favorite thing the whole night. We shared a steamed artichoke for the table. Cooked nicely and brought back childhood memories which can sound weird. My other favorite dish was the sea scallop carpaccio. Cut very thin with a lot of flavor. It&#39;s topped with salmon caviar and yuzu. 

For my entree, I ordered the duck confit parmentier which is a gorgeous presentation. It&#39;s paired with crushed potatoes, olive oil and truffle purèe. This dish was pretty good but I thought it would be better. Next time, I&#39;ll listen to reviews and order the foie gras lollipops. Heard they are amazing.

For dessert, they gave the table a free crepe. I kid you not, it&#39;s because they liked my cousin. It worked out well for me because it was delicious and a great way to finish a meal."

I made my way through all the Royales- think Kir, hibiscus, lavender, rose etc. They were floral without being over sweet and had plenty of crisp prosecco. 

We had dinner plans but we loved the look of the French small plates and classic cocktails so we headed back a couple of times. The small plates were great for picking at while drinking their fabulous cocktails. The duck confit parmentier was rich and beautiful. Scallop carpaccio was a little oily but really fresh tasting.

The steak tartare was definitely the highlight of everything we ordered. The meat tastes fresh and has a nice mild flavor. The fig and goat cheese tartines were amazing except for the bread that was a little bit tough and chewy. I have never had duck rillettes before but after having this one, I will definitely try more! The butterfly salmon was okay, nothing to write home about.

I also ordered blue cocktail (I don&#39;t remember the name of it but it had something to do with a lady in a blue dress.) The server drink served me the drink with a back story which I thought was pretty cool. The cocktail was fruity, sweet, and delicious. 

Service could use a little bit of work. We were sat in the back of the restaurant and after our initial orders were brought out, our server slacked on refilling our water and it was hard to flag him down to make more orders."

New York City has seen a growing number of gastropub style bars/restaurants that serve serious food as well as drinks at the same time. It makes a lot of sense. When you go on casual outings/dates, you don&#39;t want to break the bank but at the same time you want to have memorable experience with food while imbibing some creative cocktails put together at the bar. The catchy Excuse My French had that promising outlook where I absolutely loved the cozy space that makes you feel like you&#39;re at an exclusive lounge somewhere in Paris. On the other hand, my meal had a lot of mixed results.

The menu at Excuse My French is what the place calls &#34;French tapas,&#34; focusing on shareable small plates, starting with various charcuterie and cheese options. Iberico ham that my dining companion and I had tried was pedestrian, and the tartine of figs and goat cheese wasn&#39;t particularly memorable either. Some dishes had bold flavor that worked quite well. Sautéed Brussels sprouts with lamb merguez which the bartender highly recommended as the signature dish had nice touch that would make for a nice vegetable meal, and my favorite menu of the night was organic Cajun chicken with ratatouille and quinoa, with the chicken more or less cooked quite well and working harmoniously with the texture of quinoa for definitely an above-average dish. On the other hand, I couldn&#39;t finish sea scallop carpaccio with salmon caviar and yuzu as the freshness was quite lacking in the seafood, and boudin blanc sausage with caramelized apple came out in unexpectedly lukewarm temperature with soggy texture. It is a bit unfortunate that the dishes didn&#39;t quite have the imagination or creativity to be extra special, and the execution tended to be more often inconsistent than I had hoped.

Excuse My French doesn&#39;t take reservations, and the adorable space is tiny, so I would suggest showing up early. There is full bar with some happy hour discounts for wine, but my suggestion is to sip on one or two cocktails that the bartender quite aptly put together. I would definitely come back here to try more drinks, and the vibe of this place will definitely invite me back. For serious dinner, however, I might reconsider trying other places in the bustling LES neighborhood."

I did notice a lot of drinks where they burn the rosemary and put it in your drink. All I know it looked good and people were ordering it like crazy. I know I am going to go back to try more of their drinks. I loved the food, love the atmosphere and the service was excellent.

The meals are tapas style and I would argue even the &#34;big plates&#34; aren&#39;t entree size (though my steak tartare was a large sized portion as was the duck confit. 

We tried the four cheese plate which came served with bread (and consistent refills), fig jam, and grapes 

Beet small plate was good but nothing out of the ordinary. Better when paired with the goat cheese we had from our cheese selection :) 

Steak Tartare with quail egg. This was a &#39;simple&#39; dish that was good and quite filling. Again paired with the blue cheese from our sampler and a slice of bread (and red wine) really made this for me. 

Foie gras lollipops- as another reviewer mentioned aren&#39;t much like lollipops and more rare than some may prefer. They had a sweet after taste.

Duck confit- very good and excellent presentation I recommend this 

Happy hour has 2-4-1 wine !

Oh well...once he finished his sliders and dove into my crepe, all was well.

The interior was cute, the food was delicious, the service was good, and drinks were interesting. I got the photogenic Hibiscus Champagne with the edible flower, the Butterfly Salmon, and the Watermelon Salad. This was enough to fill me up. The food was great, no complaints there. The salmon was flavorful, moist, and tender and the bed of ratatouille (stewed veggies) that it was on was equally flavorful. The portion was a good size for me, I tend to like smaller portions or sizes that leave me feeling content. This is a tapas place, so the portions will be smaller. The drink looked great, it was a bit sweet so be warned. It was on their happy hour, so I also got to try their Lavender version. They have a few options to choose from and the cool thing is they extract the essence from the flowers in house. For dessert, I had to get the Nutella Crepe since everything else tasted so good. It was a bit bigger than I expected and would be good to share between two people. It had a nice crunchy texture to it, but had a bit too much nutella for me; you can ask to have less or just press it out before each bite. Overall, this place is great for a couple that wants to share a few items and have a drink or two. The drinks appear the be the only things on their happy hour though."

The bartender was warm and attentive. My chardonnay was perfection! Well chilled, dry, and a little sweet with notes of citrus. Their cocktail menu is very innovative and features classic French cocktails  complete with the history of the cocktail!! (Major points for a beverage nerd like yours truly.)

But, oh no! we would certainly not recommend any other place. This is a peace of heaven! 
The place itself is tiny but really well organized to make the best out of it, with a kind of mix between modern &amp; old French decor that really sets you in the perfect mood to just sit &amp; enjoy. I also really appreciated the music which was perfect as it was filling the room but soft enough that we could easily speak &amp; understand each other (btw, the chef used to be DJ!) 
You can choose to sit at a separate table or at the bar, which is where we sat, overlooking the chef &amp; its kitchen.
The service was perfect, efficient &amp; knowledgeable,  and also very clean (I saw the server slightly sneeze -happens to everyone - and immediately he went to clean his hands, really appreciated!)
And last but not least: the food is paradise in your mouth! As we sat at the bar, we got to see the chef cook (He opened the Laduree macaron shop in NYC btw...) and selected a few tapas: Brussels sprouts, duck confit, scallops, boudin blanc. Each had a special touch and it&#39;s like you&#39;ve never eaten that food before, so delicious! But the best part is that the chef had seen our selection of tapas &amp; when we were done with these, he started preparing more for us to taste (salmon and the other was tuna) as he said he thought these would match better the selection of tapas we made initially: so delicious! Such a nice gift of him! 
Of course, we ended up taking a crepe, a simple lemon &amp; sugar. You have to try it, it has a special surprise, which I won&#39;t tell, but definitely worth it! :)
We will definitely go back &amp; bring more people with us!"

- Then : the service was HORRIBLE. But they still arbitrarily charged us 20% gratuity for two. 
- The food itself : Nice to unpleasant...

...depending on your order. 

I strongly discourage you to order the CRÊPES, except maybe if your have cœliaque illness - only reason that may justify to order a dry, flacky, bitter &amp; expensive &#34;gluten free&#34; Crêpe.
Note for true crepes suzette lovers : the crepes are probably prepared upfront. Then they re-heat them and pour Grand Marnier with sugar over the top. If you were expecting them to be cooked on the spot, soaked with Grand Marnier, orange, butter &amp; sugar right in the pan, as it&#39;s supposed to be... Then, don&#39;t.

The STEAK TARTARES&#39; pictures we saw earlier on Yelp were optical illusions. The egg is quail egg, so beware : the portion is tiny... If you were looking for a true french meal that satisfies you and relate to the genuine meal they serve in France, you shall order 3 of them. And it comes with no side (so make it 4?) but a few slice of dry baguette. And no capers, nor shallots.

The little starter &#34;TARTINE&#34; is a joke : slice of supposedly grilled -but dry- baguette with half (tasty, nevertheless) sausage. More of an appetizer for one. Noted.

The DUCK PARMENTIER is tasty. Moist, with nice truffle flavor, and a crusty layer on the top. 
But small, which was unexpected for a traditional regional meal, that contains no caviar. So too pricy, considering it was mostly mashed potatoe with less than the equivalent of a duck thigh inside. And no side. No salad. Nothing. 

WE. LEFT. HUNGRY. (...with starters + main course + desert = 100+)

We arrived for a late Happy Hour (20mins before the end, we were already installed) and even if the restaurant was nearly empty, the staff weren&#39;t happy that we order two cocktails AND apparently felt the urge to mention that it was late (but HH still)......! You know what ? If you don&#39;t want to do HH, then don&#39;t. Or if the last half-hour is too excruciatingly painful for you, then make it shorter. But stop trying to drag the clients inside and then wish out loud they don&#39;t order a drink. 

Then we had this &#34;dirty dishes situation&#34;. The waitress probably forgot to pick up the starters&#39; dishes from our table, so when she brought the main courses, the table was still full of dirty dishes. 
So she waited for us to push everything on the side and pile the plates to make room. And then, she just left everything AS IS.............. Yes, we ate somewhere in between our dirty dishes. 
So next time I want to feel like I&#39;m having diner in a school cafeteria, I&#39;ll go somewhere that won&#39;t cost me 100$ for two. 

Last but not least. Please, smile. I mean : not only when you bring the check (with arbitrary upfront 20% gratuity, remember ?)

Seriously."

Maybe it was just our selection, but I have to be honest, we were very underwhelmed with the food. Menu seems promising, but lacks in delivery. Drinks on the other hand were good, leaning toward the fizzy variety.

We ordered:
foie gras lollypops - appeared as a piece of liver on a mini skewer, not resembling a lollipop at all, and was cold in the center.
Scallops - served raw, bad choice as they were somewhat spoiled.
merquez sausage toastine - tasty, but basic.
breaded portabella - they must have forgotten the tomato as it was just portabella topped with too much overtoasted breading. 
dessert - nothing caught our attention (think Nutella crepe for $9).

$140 later (for two) and still very hungry, we left to go feast at Antibes (try their foie gras for comparison). EMF is a great place, nice staff, but needs to liven up the menu. They are after all competing with every other french place in NYC."

And they have these great light green gorgeous big olives that I crave pretty much all the time now.  Haven&#39;t tried too many of the drinks because I&#39;m mostly a gin and soda girl, but  I tried the French 75 the other night and really liked it.

You should instead crack open a Playboy to get your nudie fix). The place looked too cute from the outside to resist and I&#39;m a sucker for claiming &#34;first!&#34; to new places. My group of four was a tad hesitant to stay, however, as the layout is not conducive at all to anyone larger than a couple. That said, I very much want to come back for a solo drink at the narrow, snaking bar. Still, we managed to take over the corner all the way in the back. 

You will want to start with a cocktail off their extensive list of classics. I had the L&#39;Antonieta, dedicated to the Mexican writer who killed herself inside Paris&#39; Notre Dame in 1931. Our waiter (owner?) hauntingly recounted the story as he mixed my cocktail right before my eyes. It was great. And delicious. Like a smoky margarita, not to trivialize it (I f*king drink margaritas at the club). As for food, we split the baked camembert and fresh crab and avocado tartine. The former was pure ooey-gooey bliss (shout out to a free refill on bread!). I could have sworn the crab on the tartine was still kickin&#39;, it was that FRESH, fresher than Kanye&#39;s clique. I need to come back and try more plates (looking at you foie gras lollipops).

As an aside, I&#39;m 99.89% sure this place has no affiliation to Pardon My French in Alphabet City, but it still leads me to wonder...are there really no other francophile idioms out there? French kiss? French letter? French leave? French fries????"

Everything is designed to be beautiful, and gracious, and luscious and so very Belle Epoque! I force my friends to photograph me holding different drinks (and there is an excellent variety to choose from, to please every taste!) It&#39;s now my go-to brunch spot. The yogurt with berries and granola? A mouth party. The French Toast? We&#39;re freakin&#39; engaged. I try to sample a little different something with each visit, but it&#39;s so hard when I just want my favorites over and over! It&#39;s like being at the cocktail hour of the best wedding you&#39;ve ever been to; you know the cocktail hour is your favorite part. 
My personal suggestion is go with a few friends, and just order a whole mess of dishes. Everyone grab a fork, don&#39;t be shy! Little tastes all around. 
The owner, RIcardo, is a true HOST. You&#39;re at his party, and you&#39;re his most favorite guest, the one he&#39;s been waiting for! If you can&#39;t decide what to pick, believe me, put yourself in his very capable hands, and let him choose.

Came in for Sunday lunch / brunch, the place had several tables, not packed. We have waited for 45 minutes for our food to come, mind you it was a breakfast sandwich and a cheeseburger. Although starving we did not complain. Now I love my meat well done, which I specified when I ordered the burger. The burger was most likely medium - rare, the inside was raw meat. I did not complain or send back b/c the waiters were impossible to flag down and since I was starving I ate around the raw meat part. Very sad b/c the burger could have been delicious if cooked to my liking. Now as I ate my food my friend tried to flag the waiter down because her sandwich was missing avocado. By the time the waiter came er food was cold, my burger was eaten and she was told her sandwich is missing avocado b/c they ran out. Call me crazy , but maybe you should inform the customer that one of the 3 ingredients from the sandwich is missing??? She asked for a piece of tomato. By the time they brought it out she ate her sandwich, she did get lucky though b/c it was an entire bowl of tomatoes instead.

Although the menu looks delicious, the service was not good, the wait time is ridiculous and our orders were messed up.

Will not be back."

So when you first walk up you&#39;re a bit confused b/c all you see is a bar and wonder how are they serving dinner when clearly there is no real table for 5. We were told to go through the double doors in the back and walk up the stairs. We did and boom a whole secret eating area inside and outside... very nice. Nice shabby chic decor and dim lighting, 

We were seated right away even with one person missing. I definitely appreciate that when you&#39;re always told no seating until the entire party. She was only 10 mins behind so it wasn&#39;t that bad

Drinks on the table... the jaguar was the winner of the night for me! 
Food on the table... we did their $90 beef rib special we thought we should get 2 but out waitress told us it was more than enough for the 5 of us....she wasn&#39;t lying. The ribs needed just a little bit more flavor for me but it was good. The side that came with it was lettuce wedge salad and potatoes w/ herbs. We also ordered roasted cauliflower and a potato cheese balls. For dessert we had the nutella beignets. Everything was pretty tasty and being able to share all of it was awesome. 

We were told that the menu changes often, so I definitely will go back to try something else."

Welcome to my Friday night. 9pm, hubby and I strolling around looking for a new yet nearby place to grab a bite. Pull out Yelp, decide to try this place. Now the reason it seemed even more surprising is because it&#39;s literally two doors down from where we used to go to the gym.

So we walk in, and all of a sudden a very cool cloud envelops us. We sashay into this sexy basement, complete with world fusion music, good-looking (mostly French) 
staff, but low-key, no-attitude vibes. We first go straight to the piano because...I mean there&#39;s a piano, hello. We were a bit confused because we had seen an extensive menu and couldn&#39;t see how this would be served in this small, intimate space. But then the host greets us and says though it&#39;s busy, there are more seats in the back.  He jots our names down on the list and we grab seats at the bar. We get some drinks and wonder in awe when the bartender tells us this place has been open for over a year. Wait, quoi?? 

Eventually we were taken through a labyrinth of nicely lit, well-decorated rooms. Wow, all that hidden space! The element of surprise is so rare in NYC so when you see how they were able to make the most of the real estate it kinda blows your mind a bit.

We were seated outside. It was kinda brisk out but we sat next to a heater and were given blankets. We order the curry mussels, cauliflower and honey carrots. The food takes a bit of time, but we&#39;re given compensation shots. 

The food. So you know the chef is French or had French training when the food seems so simple but is actually really multi-layered sensation delicious. The use of dill in the cauliflower dish was exquisite. 

What more can I say?"

There were 3 drink choices and my favorite was the French strong, delicious and refreshing.   I also like the El Hombre however I would have liked it a bit more spicy, especially with the red chili garnish, but still had good flavor.

Well due to the crowd I was only able to try the potato and leek soup, with hazel nuts and ricotta was totally delicious!!!  Other elites said the fried chicken was good and they had beignets....which I would have loved to try???  Overall it seemed people enjoyed the food they did have.

However the service wasn&#39;t very good. We booked a dinner for 15 people - and the amount of back and forth was quite heavy, the manager was not very accommodating and at times plane rude, and when the date actually came for the dinner - the treatment towards the guests was by far subpar. It&#39;s a pity because this place has potential (everyone thought the decor and food was good!), but at same time almost everyone at dinner commented at how the staff was making things so much harder and inconvenient. For that reason, will not be coming back :(."

Simple elegant bar located at the old fatty cue space on South 6 in wburg. I love this area and this bar opened at the best location. One block from Diner, same black as Bembe, one block form Bua, It is the best spot. 
This tiny space is cosy and the decor is on point with wood furniture, marble bar with lights inside, small kitchen, and awsome ceiling lights. Since it opened it is always a scene with beautiful people, great drinks and very friendly bartenders. i have been already two times and both nights were equally good (and one was on a sunday). The inspiration is coming from New Orleans with bites and drinks having a southern twist. Oh and I heard this place will soon carry some really rare and expensive bourbon bottles and offer liquor tasting flights, can&#39;t wait. Again, great find, great crew behind this bar, and many good nights to come."

Instead we had a modified menu with a host of seafood dishes. We observed small portions walking in, which made sense given reasonable prices, so we ordered several things and remained hopeful. 

Unfortunately, nothing was particularly memorable. The best of several mediocre dishes was a crab and lobster based grilled cheese sandwich. Otherwise, the octopus wasn&#39;t as advertised and the yellowtail tuna we tried was dry, like it had either been cooked too long or left out too long. 

Service was slow and we had used the &#34;Reserve&#34; app to make our reservation, which they forgot when they brought us the check twenty minutes after we asked for it. 

There are better southern style places in the city and better seafood places throughout Brooklyn. Try them instead."

I almost missed the huge restaurant area which is beautiful and tucked away behind an alley.

My husband &amp; I have been here twice for dinner, once with a large-ish group (8 people) in the garden, and once with another couple, inside (in a section opening onto the garden). It&#39;s so rare to find a nice open air setup in NYC! 

Both times, what impressed me was that I didn&#39;t notice the other guests. Most of the time, when we dine out, I am distracted by the people at neighboring tables. At Loosie it was magical - maybe it&#39;s how they have the tables set up, maybe it&#39;s the music - I don&#39;t know. But they got it right. 

Fried chicken was fantastic. We don&#39;t eat seafood, but we loved the chicken so much we ordered another round. We shared some salads and sides. 

Loved dessert! 

No coffee, but they said they were working on setting that up.

We are not big drinkers so it&#39;s hard for me to rate the cocktails, but we got a bottle of rose the second time, and it was lovely.

On our second visit, when we showed up, they said it would be a long wait,, we were bummed but starving, so we decided to try our luck elsewhere. We were halfway down the block, when a girl came running up to us. One of the staff! Someone had cancelled their reservation. We were so happy that she did so!

Go to Looise, you will not regret it!

 The cocktails and the food  were to die for. We order the pork chop, scallops, and the shrimp Po  boy and everything was delicious, tasty and cook to perfection. I am French so I am very picky about flavor and everything was fantastic! The atmosphere at Loosie&#39;s kitchen was great it did not seem like we were in the middle of Brooklyn on a Friday night.

Finally made it for a dinner here and while I really wanted to love this place it fell short on both drinks and food. That being said, the atmosphere is wonderful and the servers are lovely but the food was almost at the point of being inedible. We had the octopus (the best out of the 4 dishes) which was quite bland and served on top of an unrecognizable substance. Next was the pork belly which was the worst pork belly we&#39;ve ever had. It was so rubbery we couldn&#39;t even cut through it with a knife. Last we had the seasonal roots (very undercooked) and the Shrimp Po Boy which was the saddest Po&#39;Boy I&#39;ve ever had. The bread must have been old and the sandwich was cold. Not good. The drinks we had were also extremely extremely sweet and hard to get down.

It looks like from the other reviews that most people have had a wonderful experience here. I&#39;m thinking we just came on a REALLY off night or there must be a new chef."

For 40$, you have to get your own water, utensils, and they expect you to bus your table.

Saturday night my girlfriend and I ventured here for a little pre-hockey dinner and boy were we clucking by the end of it.

A tiny spot that&#39;s not too far from the Barclays Center/Atlantic Terminal. It was bustling with take out orders and delivery for those lucky enough to live locally. A handful of wood-glazed tables and some counter seating makes up the innards. A chalk-written menu filled with poultry options for your palate is your way to order.

To start, my girlfriend and I split the chicken burger and chicken breast sandwich. The burger&#39;s patty was a wonderfully ground combo of light and dark meat topped with lettuce, tomato, grilled onion and special sauce on a brioche bun creating a juicy and fresh mouthful in each bite. The sandwich had similar toppings but went in a different route with mashed avocado and turkey bacon (two birds on one sandwich!). The breast was well-seasoned with a nice charred flavor and a good balance of all ingredients. 

We also split a couple of sides. First the mac-n-cheese which had a crispy layer of cheese atop it and oh so creamy underneath. But the real unique and amazing side was the jalapeño mashed potatoes. Soft and fluffy mash with jalapeño purée placed on top. It packed a helluva spicy punch (my girlfriend couldn&#39;t handle it), but the flavors were incredible. 

We washed everything down with Pūrbird&#39;s own original iced tea. Super tasty with pomegranate juice, lime, and a hint of refreshing mint to top it off. It was a delightful way to wash down the chicken goodness we consumed.

Overall, Pūrbird is king of the coop when it comes to high quality chicken choices, amazing sides, and refreshing drinks. With the close proximity to the railroad, I know I&#39;ll be back to flap my wings and chow down until I lay an egg!"

I wanted a nice seated dinner and it&#39;s pretty clear that this is more of an order-at-the-counter, take-out option. HOWEVER, they also have nice outdoor tables on an adorable Park Slope street and we were able to snag one of those so it was fine. I went with the famous chicken burger and my friend got the chopped salad - both of our dishes were good but the real highlight was the jalapeno mac and cheese. Do not think you can order this and not finish it - we were just planning to have a few bites each but definitely scraped that plate clean. One of the better mac and cheeses I&#39;ve had recently.

I tend to be a solo diner who eats in the restaurant, and the way their menu is set up it&#39;s surprisingly difficult to put together a meal. Their finest offering - a $15 special that includes their amazing crispy &amp; juicy grilled chicken, wonderful mashed potatoes, a vegetable of the day that&#39;s usually well prepared and some fresh tasty flatbread - possibly the best chicken dinner in the city - is only available at lunch. Huh? Otherwise you have to put something together from their list of sides, which are only available in large sizes meant for sharing. I suppose I could get a salad with chicken, but salads are frankly not their strong suit - not terrible, but there&#39;s better salads to be had in the area. I could get a sandwich, but that would have to be my entire meal as the sides are too large and correspondingly pricey. The &#34;hand-held&#34; chicken pot pie should really be considered a shared appetizer - tasty, but too rich and monochromatic to be eaten by one person at one sitting. As you can see, I&#39;ve been there several times and tried different things. I&#39;m also a big fan of their breakfast sandwich - eggs, turkey bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato on brioche - which is also only available at lunch, since they don&#39;t open til 11:30. So it&#39;s a great place if you want breakfast or dinner at lunchtime. If you actually want lunch, though, it&#39;s a challenge - which is weird, because the vibe of the place screams lunch: it&#39;s not intimate enough for a dinner date, and you have to order at the counter and get your own utensils. And if I want dinner at dinnertime, I&#39;ve learned that I have to go elsewhere, since the menu does not have the solo diner in mind.

I suppose this place is designed with the takeout customer in mind, which is why their in-store dining is kind of a mess. But, if you&#39;re listening, purbird, you should know, if you care, that this is one customer who would go there a lot more often if I felt that you wanted my business."

My friend and I got jalapeño Mac and cheese to share. It was delicious! My friend had half a chicken, with mashed potatoes, and corn, which was the special of the day. Everything tasted great. The vegetables and the chicken had so much flavor. I ordered a chopped salad with grilled chicken. My grilled chicken had so much flavor and it was really great. We also had two glasses of wine.

Matter of fact I could literally live on chicken. I say this to impress upon you my experience that we had literally just moments ago at Purbird. It is out of this world. It&#39;s nothing fancy in decor as it&#39;s an eat and go kind of place. But don&#39;t let that fool you. There is some real attention to preparing their food. As it was our first trip I can&#39;t comment on a lot of the menu but what we had was fantastic. The half chicken with green hot sauce is some of the most tender flavorful chicken ever!  And the skin is cooked to a nice crisp. The chicken burger was so juicy and perfect with the cheddar cheese we added. And the jalapeño Mac n cheese was some of the best we&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;ve read a few comments about the expense and will agree that it may be slightly on the high side but the portions are big!  My fiancé and I split those 3 items and were completely stuffed. Wow!  Purbird you nailed it!

Handsome little restaurant with friendly folks running it. We went there for the chicken sandwich. The chicken itself was tasty. The bread/roll was tasty.

It&#39;s a small but very tasty bird. Perfect for two, just add a side. Whole bird is $18 and a side is $7. They just need 15 minutes to prepare it so I am sure they pre-cook it and then when you order it they just &#34;finish&#34; it on the grill. 
The bird has tiny drumsticks, it&#39;s cute. I am a drumstick lover so I would need 8 of those to feel satisfied :)
With the whole bird you get 0ne sauce free, otherwise each sauce costs $1. I had the Chipotle creamy sauce and it was good.
PurBird is our favorite place when we are out doing things around and want a good chicken meal to bring home. I would love to have it delivered but unfortunately we are a few too blocks away."

The place is a grab and go and/or buy and sit yourself type restaurant. The space is fairly small so i would advise against going with a large group unless you&#39;re super lucky like me :) we managed to snatch the large communal table in the back corner for the 5 of us. 

The food takes about 10-15min to prep because they make everything to order. I just came from the gym and was craving for carbs so i went with the Chicken Pie and couldn&#39;t pass up the Jalapeno mac and cheese; which was AWESOME. Not too spicy; just enough heat to keep wanting more. The portion of the mac and cheese is definitely sharing size (though you may not want to) The chicken pie is fairly small; I would order that again but maybe as a side to share. 

My friends had the lunch special which came with their chicken, string beans, a potato side (mashed), and bread. I highly reco this if you have the time to sit and dine in. It&#39;s a pretty big serving, and the empty plates suggest that it tasted good too. Looks pretty healthy as well.

With the high protein healthy options and reasonable prices; I wouldn&#39;t mind making this a routine meal after the gym :D"

My chopped salad with grilled chicken thigh was great with plenty of beets, feta, juicy marinated thigh, and tomatoes in a vinaigrette. The Caesar with olive oil and Parmesan is solid as well. The grilled chicken sandwich is also very good with juicy chicken on a bun slathered with mayo and topped with LTO. I loved the sweet potato fries which are not as greasy as the standard versions and the chicken noodle soup which is cream based and made with plenty of tender slow-roasted chicken and farfalle pasta. You order at the counter and it is fast casual but the food is very good. Prices are okay - it came to about $40 for 2 orders of fries, salad, chicken thigh, soup, and sandwich."

I was about to head home and decided I wanted dessert and they only had the brownies, but WOW. Those brownies man, so on point. I left happy and decided to come back. 

Second, revised review. 
No change this time. The staff is still sweet and when I chose the wrong drink from the fridge, she simply told me to throw it away and grab another. It&#39;s small touches like that that make me love a place. This time I had soup again, but with a side of fries. And once again I was not disappointed. You&#39;ll enjoy yourselves guys.

The one thing I&#39;d change is the be able to make your sandwiches and wraps &#34;deluxe&#34; and have a single serving of fries added.

We ordered the Chicken Breast Sandwich. It is a Grilled Chicken Breast with avocado, turkey bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo on a toasted roll. A simple and delicious chicken sandwich. The chicken was moist and juicy. Flavorful.  

We also had the Chicken Burger. House Ground Dark and White Chicken Meat with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and special sauce. Again..simple...tasty...moist..juicy..enjoyable. I would eat this chicken burger over any meat burger any day. 

For side dishes, we ordered the Sweet Potato Fries. These were great sweet potato fries. Crispy on the outside. Soft on the inside. It was not oily at all. Sweet and it was made right. 

The Mashed Sweet Potato was even better than the Sweet Potato Fries. Very smooth, creamy, sweet, and amazingly delicious. I would sink my teeth into this everyday. I loved it. I should have licked the bowl. 

Our last side dish we ordered was the Jalapeno Mac &amp; Cheese. 3 cheese mixed with jalapeno. This is a good mac &amp; cheese. You get a good delicious cheesy bite with a little bit of heat. The mac &amp; cheese had the right amount of heat, but it did not over power the cheese. It was oozing cheese and it was creamy. 

This meal was simple, comforting, amazing, and delicious. Nothing fancy about the food. Nothing that will wow when you look at. It will Wow you when you taste the deliciousness of the food.

Reviewers don&#39;t lie, their chicken is pretty fresh and moist. Unfortunately that&#39;s about all it stands up to. Ordered the chicken breast sandwich, and found it rather bland.

It&#39;s a small shop, located on the corner of St. Marks Ave and 6ave, in Park Slope. I came here with a friend because we heard they make chicken pot pie and other chicken dishes, and we absolutely had to try. We got their chicken burger, chicken wrap and handheld chicken pot pie.
Their chicken burger was delish; juicy chicken with lettuce and tomato, sitting on top of the fluffiest buns you&#39;ve ever had. That burger was excellent. The chicken wrap was also great; tender, cooked-to-perfection chicken breast, sitting on a bed of sauteed cabbage, tomato and onions. 
Then, the main reason why we came: the chicken pot pie. So yummy, so moist, sooo good. The pot pie is in a huge, flaky, baked empanada-like crust. It looks like a triangular empanada. The inside is moist, tender and super hot. It was worth it just to make the trip all the way here.

Everything tastes fresh and the sauces are flavorful without overpowering everything else. 

The Purbird Salad wrap (which confusingly says 5PM - until or starting from? - on the website but on the menus clarifies as being &#34;until 4PM&#34;) with romaine, tomatoes and feta was excellent. The lunch special was fairly substantial - chicken, bread, a vegetable (very well prepared cauliflower the last time I was there), and a choice of potato (had the sweet potato fries which were also good) - but wasn&#39;t all too cheap at $15. Sides, for the most part, are a tad overpriced (many cost close to the same as the chicken sandwiches) though some coming out of the kitchen like the mac and cheese did look quite tempting.

Having just the wrap (and picking a bit at my friend&#39;s lunch special) I left a little hungry but very satisfied with the quality and general healthiness of my meal.

Tonight, I call to make a $50+ delivery order and &#34;Reuben&#34; tells me because it&#39;s raining (misting at best) they won&#39;t deliver to my apartment. They will only go as far as Washington. I live no more than a 30 sec walk past Washington.

There&#39;s actually nothing that special at Purbird...it&#39;s not bad food, but it&#39;s not special either, and given that this is the Park Slope area, you can find some really excellent food in the neighborhood.

The chicken itself is what you should try if you ever come here.  It&#39;s pretty good and juicy, but pricy for what you get and it&#39;s not exactly all that special (something one could easily cook at home). When we got it, there was also pools of grease on it.  If I made this at home I would at least pat it down or drain that after cooking, prior to plating.  But it was still good.  Aside from the chicken, the other food is where it really gets pricy for what you get.  

Jalapeno mac and cheese was alright but I felt a little ripped off because again, you can get amazing mac and cheese in this neighborhood and Purbird isn&#39;t one of those places.  It&#39;s somewhere between what you could get at a restaurant and what you can get from a box from the grocery.  No yummy crust on this mac and cheese.   You could even call it under-seasoned.  I would not order it again; not impressed.

The fries were in the same boat...nothing special, and possibly the most expensive thing I ordered for the flavor you get.  Well, I had to try it at least once!

To sum up, the chicken is the only thing worth trying, but even then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s special enough to warrant another visit. It is, however, the sole reason my review has 3 stars.

I also deduct a star for the bad service.  After ordering, they got our order wrong by giving us a second plate of chicken (also with pools of grease/oil on top of it) instead of the fries.  It took them a long while to correct the mistake, we were nearly done eating our other 2 dishes during this time.

I don&#39;t really get this place.  People post rave reviews for something not that special, and stuff you can cook at home in 20min...which is roughly how long it took for them to prepare our food.  It&#39;s alright to rate something 3 stars when it&#39;s mediocre, not everything is THE BEST EVER or THE WORST EVER, ya know?"

Brooklyn is one of my least traversed territories, and although we ran into inevitable train delays and reroutings on the planned weekend afternoon, all of us managed to arrive at Purbird with our appetites in tow.

Purbird is a neighborhood spot, even at first glance. It&#39;s not large by any means, and consists of a handful of tables and counter seats for guests; all drinks are self-serve (including the bottles of tap water that are kept in the refrigerator), as are the bins holding plastic utensils and condiment dispensers. After we&#39;d settled in at a table and gotten a few cups of water, we headed towards the counter to make our orders. Purbird&#39;s menu is relatively compact, focusing on the pedestrian chicken, offered in iterations of sandwiches, salads, burgers, and grilled plates. Our group decided on two sides to share and ordered our own mains.

I suppose I&#39;ll get my complaints out of the way first. The Chicken Burger I ordered was one of the least impressive &#34;burgers&#34; I&#39;ve yet to try. Chicken is typically not used in patties a good reason, given that it&#39;s such a sinewy and dry protein to begin with, and Purbird&#39;s version was a perfect example of this. The cheese wasn&#39;t melted, much less warmed, and the sheer voluminousness of the airy brioche buns was almost comical in contrast to the actual petite size of the burger. Much more satisfying were the two sides that the three of us shared; the fries were well-portioned, crispy, and had just the right chew and the Jalapeno Mac and Cheese quite possibly might be the best thing on Purbird&#39;s menu. The macaroni is cooked to the right al dente, doused (in the best way possible) in melted cheese mixed with slice jalapenos, and baked so that it achieves a hint of a crust just before serving. Needless to say, it disappeared quite quickly from the table...

In hindsight, I&#39;m a little disappointed to note that the protein which the restaurant is named after wasn&#39;t done to justice at Purbird, but at the very least, the Mac and Cheese certainly made the journey into Brooklyn worthwhile."

We came here to grab a late lunch after a show at Barclays. We ordered a chicken breast sandwich, chicken pie, and jalapeno mac n&#39; cheese. Service was super friendly and very patient, as we took a little time to decide what we wanted. 

The chicken sandwich was simple, with chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, mayo, turkey bacon, but very satisfying. I really liked the flakiness of the chicken pie and the amount of creamy chicken filling was just right. The mac n&#39; cheese had great texture on the noodles and a nice spicy kick. The cheese was slightly less impressive, as the top of the noodles are covered in a nice thick melted cheese topping but not much cheese underneath. Still, we enjoyed everything and ate every crumb. 

Special thanks to the woman at the counter who also gave me a mango dipping sauce to go with the pie. Really hit the spot!"

Sweet potato you can also share for two which was delightful nice and soft and just melts in your mouth! So good.

Turkey thigh on a whole wheat wrap with lettuce tomato and dressing and it was tender juicy and fulfilling ! Best part of the chicken if you ask me.

I&#39;ve been a closet reader for years, but never have taken the time to actually review. However, after the experience we encountered at
PURE BIRD in Park Slope, we felt it would be a major disservice to others not to
inform others of this establishment. These folks are the lowest of the LOW! 

The folks at Pure Bird outright discriminated against my wife and I. And to make matters worse, they failed to issue a credit to our credit card after we rejected the food and called them out on it. Let me repeat that... we were DISCRIMINATED against... AND they took our money.
After this incident happened, we made several attempts to contact the owner, CHRISTINA L, and she has failed to contact us back which says A LOT about the business owner she is. We ended up contacting the BBB and the ACLU to report them. EFREN and ANDY two of the flamboyant cashiers are as nasty, rude and inconsiderate as can be. It truly baffles me that folks can get away with this. WHO does this? WHO treats customers in this manner in 2015? PURE BIRD does. Stay FAR, FAR away from this place at all cost."

I would have to say that the food was just okay at best. The whole chicken wasn&#39;t technically a whole chicken. It didn&#39;t come with the wings. I expected a bigger chicken and more meat but the meat was quite scarce for the price you pay for a whole chicken. Definitely not worth the price point to meat ratio. However, the chicken was moist and the skin a little crisp but the meat couldn&#39;t stand on it&#39;s own flavor wise. The sauces we got were the mango chutney, lemon &amp; parsley, and purbird sauce. Out of the 3, the best were the pubird sauce and lemon &amp; parsley. Both were flavorful and excellent as sauces.

The fries were standard. Nothing fancy about them. You have to buy their sauces otherwise it doesn&#39;t taste that good.

The jalapeno mac and cheese was spicy and that&#39;s about it. The cheese was just okay, no special cheeses used and not much of a crisp on the top layer. Kind of soggy. Kind of tasted like Kraft&#39;s mac &amp; cheese but spicy.

The good thing is that they have root beer!

NO! Washed lettuce, basic lemon and oil dressing, dash of salt went well with the meal.  Mashed potatoes were surprisingly good and we ended up taking a to-go bag.

Most places seem to overcook it. Even something as common as roasted chicken usually comes out with dry breast meat. However a great way to trap the moisture is to wrap a brick or a skillet with foil and placing it on top of the chicken. That is the idea behind brick chicken and that&#39;s what they are serving at Purbird.

I&#39;ve had some versions of brick chicken at different places but none came at a price of $9. The high end restaurants serving this dish charge about 3X that. Our order of half roast chicken was not 3X worse. The meat was very soft and moist including most of the breast meat. The skin was probably as crispy you could get it without actually frying it - and decent flavor too.

I don&#39;t know how many sticks of butter they put in one side dish of mashed potatoes but it was one of the creamiest mashed potatoes I&#39;ve had. We ordered it cuz it stuck out at us on the menu but we later found out they had actually gotten an award for their mashed potatoes from The Daily News. I think we can all agree that if anyone knows food, it&#39;s The Daily News.*

The concept is great an a much appreciated option for healthier food in my general area.   Everything has been solid or good, but I would have to cast my vote for the chicken burger as the menus star item, easily besting the chicken breast sandwich, and the somewhat ordinary rotisserie chicken options.  It is juicy and extremely flavorful, and there is no need for the addition of cheese, keeping it relatively on the healthier side.  The lemony egg based chicken soup was also nice and quite unique.  I know this place caters to the hordes of families in the area who must be thrilled for healthier organic options to feed their spoiled yuppie offspring.   In keeping with the appealing to some less healthy options are offered like the much discussed jalapeño mash potatoes (good, quite light &amp; fluffy), mac and cheese (haven&#39;t tried as of yet), and for dessert, WAAY better than average brownies.  I usually try to keep it to the healthier options as we all know i get more than enough of my share of the opposite elsewhere.  They have some nice beers on tap, although if management is seeing this I would LOVE the addition of a nice IPA.
     Perhaps the thing that has impressed me the most however, even more than that chicken burger, is the customer service.  It is nothing short of top notch, with the staff greeting regulars by name, even a relative new bee like myself.  All and all the type of neighborhood establishment any hood would count itself as lucky to have."

First up was the Chicken Pie {chicken, veggies and special sauce wrapped in phyllo, $5.50}.  The pie itself was awesome.  I was a bit worried it would be dry, as it looked like it was mostly dough-  that thought dissipated as soon as I took my first bite.  Purfectly flaky, proportioned right, and all around creamy deliciousness.  The menu says &#34;hand held&#34; implying that you could take it to go and eat/walk.  I don&#39;t recommend that - with the mixture inside one bite and you&#39;d be wearing it. I think plate &amp; fork is the way to go.  

Hubs decided to try the Chicken Breast Sandwich {grilled chicken breast, avocado, turkey bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo on a toasted roll, $7.95} and didn&#39;t waste any time diving in.  The sandwich was a bit larger than either of us thought it would be and the chicken was seasoned and grilled up very nicely and was still juicy when it came out.  I don&#39;t think you could ask for anything more in a chicken sandwich.

Sides came next- we opted to go all-carb and try the Jalapeno Mashed {original mashed served with jalapeno puree, $5.50} and the Mac &amp; Cheese {made to order with three cheeses, $7.00}.  Both were outstanding.  Taters were super creamy and I loved the jalapeno puree.  If you like a little bit of heat you have to try these!  The mac was totally cheesy and didn&#39;t lose that creamy factor.  Loved every bite.  If I had to choose only one I&#39;d have to go with the jalapeno mashed- they went purfectly with the chicken pie.  Just like Sunday dinner with a bit of a twist. 


A few notes: 

The sides are big enough to share... so don&#39;t be shocked by their price tag.  We each had a generous helping of both taters &amp; mac.  

{Free} water carafes &amp; glasses are available for your table if you don&#39;t feel like buying a soda... and they were purfectly chilled, right from the cooler.

The atmosphere in the place is pretty lax. The guys behind the counter don&#39;t rush you to place your order, welcome you back up if you have a question or concern, dance &amp; sing to the music playing and laugh.   They seem like such a fun group to just be around.

The sides are awesome -- we&#39;ve had the spinach, both regular and jalapeno mashed potatoes, and one of the daily sides -- and they&#39;ve all been good to fantastic. They also throw super delish grilled bread into the delivery. But the chicken steals the show. How do they get that fantastic char? How does it stay so juicy and flavorful? How do they debone it with the skin still on and make it so easy to chow down? As far as I can tell: Amish chicken magic.

Pickup orders are always super fast -- 15 mins or less. One time they forgot one of the sides on a pickup order, and when I pointed it out at checkout, they apologized profusely and put together a fresh order in three minutes while I waited.

Awesome."

My bf and I always split the whole chicken and a couple of sides: the sweet potato fries and creamed spinach are a must and so is the mango chutney sauce. This sauce is delectable and works wonders with the sweet potato fries too - since the chicken does not need any extra flavor (it&#39;s that good!).

Having said that, it is quite difficult finding street parking, especially if you come here on a Saturday night like we did.  

Both the exterior and interior of the restaurant are pretty contemporary and upscale-looking.  The lighting of the establishment is a bit on the dim side, but it works well with the semi-gothic looking furniture and decor.  We situated ourselves by the bar because we found the tables to be a tad close to each other, given the size of the space and the number of tables the establishment tried to fit in there.  Unfortunately, what came with our own privacy was getting knocked continuously by passersby.

We next checked in like avid Yelpers and claimed our free lychee mimosas, which were delicious (I mean, they&#39;re free).  We then ordered the steamed dumplings appetizer, the stir-fried glass noodles and mango salad to share.  Every single spec of food was devoured by us, because they were that tasty.  Service was pretty good as well and a plus that there is a TV by the bar area to keep us entertained while chowing down.  

I&#39;d definitely recommend this place.  We walked in on a busy night, so I&#39;d advise trying to make reservations in advance."

It was fairly busy and there was only one waitress for all the tables. It took her a while to get to us and she was very impersonal so I bumped the rating down a star. My friends and I were seated at very uncomfortable seats. We felt like we were sinking in the seats. I had to sit at the edge of my seat to feel a bit more comfortable.

 I ordered:
- Thai iced coffee (If you like your coffee bitter but sweet, you should try this)
- Yum Ma Mong salad (Such a refreshing salad. It&#39;s a bit on the sour side but that&#39;s what makes it good)
- Lychee Crème Brûlée (I&#39;m always down for some crème brûlée. The lychee flavor added a nice twist to it and I definitely recommend)

I must say that I am not big on Thai food. I feel like maybe it&#39;s because I always associate it with pad thai (so sick of it after eating it one too many times). However, I know I&#39;ll be back for more at Kitchen 79."

Kitchen 79 sets your fried ice cream on fire and I&#39;m assuming they use some sort of alcohol for the fire effect. Whatever that alcohol is + the taste of fire is very unpleasant. I went from enjoying my dessert to having a bad aftertaste in my mouth. The service was mediocre at best. I was given the check rather quickly even to the point I had to tell the waitress we were still ordering. Either way, it wasn&#39;t exactly pleasant.

First of all, I&#39;ve been hearing about this place for a long time. When I had to chance to go to New York, I had to make sure I made time to go here. Almost 45 min of metro from where we were staying but it was worth it. I went on a Sunday afternoon in between lunch and dinner time so we would miss the crowd but also because we woke up really late haha. 

Ambiance: 
I have to say it wasn&#39;t what I was expecting (in a good way) from a Thai restaurant. The set up and decor was modern and upscale but still had a comfortable feel to it. I took a minute or two when I first arrived just to look at the surroundings. 

Drinks: 
- Thai Tea (3 cups there, 1 cup to go)
I don&#39;t think I need to explain this, I love Thai tea! They also have a full bar for those who might want alcohol or wine. 

Appetizers: 
- Fried Tofu
- Steamed Dumplings (Kanom Jeeb)
- Calamari
- Tom Yum Soup
The first 3 appetizers are my go to whenever I go to any Thai restaurants. The fried tofu is pretty standard with good sweet chili sauce, tofu was fried well. The dumplings was also really nicely done and not all Thai places get it right. The calamari was also great, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside! My friend had the Tom yum soup and he really liked it. The appetizers were all great, we cleaned the plates and bowl.

Entrees: 
- Shrimp Pad Thai
- Roast Duck in Red Curry. 
Pad Thai is usually my go to whenever it&#39;s the first time I visit a Thai restaurant so I have a baseline to compare. It was well balanced, I would say slightly towards the sweet side which is my preference, so I loved it. Had to box some of it to take with me because of all the appetizers but it was still good later! The roast duck was fantastic. First of all, the plating was basically eye candy, you just can&#39;t help but snap pictures of it. And the taste did not fall short either, I definitely recommend everything we&#39;ve had there. While we were there, I noticed the next table had order a whole fish, that&#39;s definitely something I will try next time I visit this place. 

Service: 
Awesome friendly service, food arrived at reasonable times, made good suggestions, made sure our glasses are never emptied, checked in on us on a timely manner. 

All in all, well worth the trip and hype! Definitely will be back to try other dishes!!"

At first the waiter seemed agitated and annoyed but as time passed, he began to be more attentive.  The woman waitress was much friendlier as she made sure we were taken care of and answered any questions we had. 
Let me begin by saying that the Thai Iced tea was huge and was mediocre-I&#39;ve had better! 
Food was great! Coconut soup was a bit watery but still enjoyed it. Tom Yum was delicious but wished more vegetables were added. Steamed snapper was cooked well until we realized it wasn&#39;t scaled thoroughly. Otherwise, it had good flavor. Khao Pad rice  with tofu was delicious-wished it had more eggs. Duck was great as well-worth trying!

For desserts, we had fried ice cream and coconut ice cream. Fried ice cream was okay as I&#39;ve had better and coconut ice cream tasted just like a coconut with pieces of flakes added.

Overall, I will definitely return to try other items:)"

The restaurant was fairly quiet with 3 other small parties. The hostess was very friendly and seated us in a large booth by the window. 

The food here is better than the more hyped place in Woodside; I actually prefer their food over the other one. We ordered the curry puff, beef salad, calamari and Wonton soup for appetizers. The shredded beef salad had a much more pleasing taste than other restaurants as it did not burn my throat eating it. Curry puff and calamari was tasty as well. We did not care too much for the Wonton soup, although my non-Asian husband loved it.

For entrees, we had the chicken yellow curry, Singapore rice noodles and oven baked pork ribs. The curry was sweet in taste and excellent with their jasmine rice. Oven baked pork ribs had a tangy spicy sauce over the crispness. The Singapore rice noodles was too salty for my taste buds and we had a few uncooked Chinese vegetable stems in it that ruined the taste of the dish for me. 

Dessert was coconut ice cream and fried green tea ice cream. My daughter and husband devoured the coconut ice cream and fought over the last bite. The fried dough was crispy and delicious but the green tea ice cream was too hard - as if it was sitting in the freezer for too long.

All in all, we would go back again!"

Located in a predominately Latin America area is Kitchen 79. A rather stylish, modern with mild remnants of the culture behind the cuisine. That and the Santa Clause in the glass that looks like a fancy dessert from afar.  

Kitchen 79 has all the staples you are looking for from the curry puff &amp; tom yum soup as starters to the pad thai, pad se ew &amp; my go to....crab fried rice as the main dish.

The two best dishes I&#39;ve tried so far is the curry puffs and the crab fried rice. Both have a good mix of spices that don&#39;t overpower the pallet. The crab fried rice had multiple healthy chunks of crab cooked just right. 

Potions for prices are reasonable. A starter and main dish for dinner will be under $20, maybe slightly over with tax &amp; tip.

The most disappointing dish was the Tod Mun Goong (Shrimp Cake Fritter). While the sauce was excellent, the flavor was ok. Breaking into the outer layer was difficult since it had been fried to a crisp, but not burnt in any way. Maybe for other people it tastes better, but for me I wasn&#39;t a fan. 

Overall: 3.75 Stars
Solid Thai food. Certainly not the best in the area, but it does the cuisine justice.
Portions for the price are hard to beat (possible, but hard).
Reservations are not necessary, but I recommend them between 700m and 800pm just in case.
Ambiance is sleek modern and perfect for a romantic get together with your loved one.
Kitchen 79 is worth a try.

So happy I found this place upon yelping Thai restaurants in Queens. I visited Kitchen 79 on February 6th (almost three weeks ago...yes and I&#39;m writing the review now) with the bf and it was REALLY pleasant. Here&#39;s why:

We got there roughly around 3:52 pm as the trains took forever and yeah, a pretty LATE lunch. The $7.50 Chicken, Tofu or Vegetable and the $8.50 Choice of Shrimp or Beef lasted only until 4:00 pm. The friendly lady greeted us and gave us the lunch menu. It was 3:56 pm and she told us we only had a few minutes to put our order in if we wanted the lunch menu. Now she could&#39;ve gave us a dirty look and pass us the dinner menu but she didn&#39;t. Thumbs up, thumbs up!! 

APPETIZERS--we chose the &#39;ka nom jeep&#39; (steamed fried dumplings with minced chicken) and the deep fried spring rolls with mixed veggies and glass noodles. Those were appetizing for sure. I really liked it. I can&#39;t really 100% remember how it tasted like (I will make sure I write reviews on the spot or shortly after from now on)...but salivating nonetheless because I remember really enjoying it. 

I got the Pad Thai (always have to get the pad thai at every Thai restaurant as I said in my other Khao Thai review) and it was delicious. The portion was a pretty good size and I was stuffed. Can&#39;t forget about the huge mug of Thai Iced Tea for only $3. Oh boy. SO WORTH IT. The bf got shrimp Khao Phad Ka Prow. It was delectable as well.

Service was superb (user experience is so important). The decor is another thumbs up. I was super pleased and I cannot wait to revisit!"

But seriously, how I could be enjoying myself so shamelessly when all the while I was betraying my beloved Thai go-to, Sripraphai?  Clearly, I got over it:

Anyway, our meal here was very solid.  The biggest standout was the ultra-fresh tasting Seafood Salad, which popped with lemongrass flavor.  Tofu-filled Summer Rolls were a nice, light, non-fried way to begin.  Cut into bite-size pieces, this was a very shareable starter.  Though the kid, a self-avowed tofu hater, managed to scarf down most of this.  Another dish worth mentioning is the Whole Fried Fish with Mango Salad. Though the fish was perfectly cooked, the Mango Salad lacked the bright herbal punch of Srip&#39;s version.  (Yeah, I went there).  Not worth $27 (!).

This spot apparently prides itself on a focus on Southern Thai cooking, with a few menu options that fall into this particular category.  We tried a Southern Eggplant curry with Tofu that was very brothy with lots of heat (no coconut milk).  Honestly, there were a couple (Southern) meat-based choices that looked more intriguing, but we were with my pescetarian brother, so we accommodated him.

I rarely mention service, unless it is exceptional in some way.  In this case, we enjoyed exceptionally gracious and helpful service, in sharp contrast to Srip&#39;s often impersonal, rushed variation.  Ambience here felt more zen too.

Ultimately, this was just a dalliance. No matter how much I stray, I always return to Srip.  But this was no one-off.  I&#39;ll be back to explore some of the more meaty menu options sans my tofu, fish and seafood-centric brother."

-Thai green tea - $3.50 this was delicious! 
-Pla Muk Tord (fried calamari) - $7 this was okay, nothing really special.
-Phed Ma Kham (roasted duck in tamarind sauce) - $18 I ordered this dish because the pictures other Yelpers posted of this looks amazing. Although the sauce was good, the duck was way overcooked and hard to chew. Disappointed. I would not order this again.
-Moo Yaan (grilled tender pork) - $12 this was also okay but again nothing special
-Lychee creme brulee - $7 I ordered this because it sounded interesting and it was pretty good. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s amazing enough to order again.

After looking through the reviews on here, I decided to order the duck noodle soup. The portion was fairly large (for me at least). It came with a nice and rich broth, thin rice noodles, and a large roasted duck leg. The waitress was very nice and attentive, offering me spicy condiments for the soup as well. There were four different condiments, and she recommended the spicy red paste for my dish. The servers were very nice to me, and gave a smile whenever they passed by, which I really appreciate.

I will definitely come back here again. I&#39;m excited to try the lychee creme brulee and curry puffs."

This is an up and coming Thai restaurant in the neighborhood and its review status does not lie. With just three people at lunch special prices it came out to just over $10 a person - BUT the food and service and atmosphere and ambience is reminiscent of the restaurants that are visited by the upper echelon. We had the Papaya salad, green curry, pad see ew and curry puffs. Not one thing to complain about. Finished off the meal with green Thai iced tea and it was perfect. All of these are a must have. 

One of my first reviews in a long time but I felt as though it was necessary for an amazing restaurant like this. Support the small businesses!!!"

Amazing lunch special deals. In addition to the usual soup or salad add on, they give you a range of delicious appetizers to choose from (minced chicken dumplings, fried crab wontons etc). My go to dishes are som tam and chicken pad Thai. 

Service is fast and friendly. Decor is beautiful and modern as well. A great place to dine in groups or solo! They are also on seamless."

Excellent food for an excellent price in Jackson Heights.  There&#39;s plenty of more popular spots around, but there was no wait at Kitchen 79 on a Saturday evening and I would surely choose this place over SriPraPhai and Ayada Thai.  I went with a group of 6 and we were served with barely a wait for a larger group.

I ordered a Thai tea and it was only $3 for a MASSIVE mug of probably some of the best Thai tea I have had in NYC thus far (and I&#39;ve had a lot).  Most people can&#39;t tell the difference between their Thai teas, but after visiting Bangkok and drinking Thai tea growing up, I&#39;ve become somewhat of a Thai tea snob.  Kind of weird, yes.  Kitchen 79 gets an A+ for their original Thai tea.  They ran out throughout the night though, so my friends got the Thai green tea, which I&#39;d never had before, but tasted somewhat like a green tea frappucino from Starbucks oddly enough.  

For our appetizers, we got the normal som tum (papaya salad) and the nam tok (grilled beef salad).  The papaya salad was also one of the best I&#39;ve had in NYC and was quite authentic and very flavorful.  A lot of the papaya salads in NYC lack flavor.  This was really spicy and sour and tasted as it should.  I liked the beef salad as well, with just as much flavor.  However, it was a tad bit too sweet for my liking.   Still really good, though.  Warning: spicy here is really spicy!

For my main, I had the duck noodle soup which was something like boat noodles in Bangkok with the dark herbal soup with angel hair noodles.  I got a massive duck leg in my soup versus pieces of soup which was interesting.  Not spicy at all, so I added a generous heap of spicy powder. I think this had tons of MSG in it or something because when I got home I couldn&#39;t stop drinking water.  Either way, tasty noodle soup dish!

For dessert, we got a crazy fire presentation of fried ice cream.  The batter was a bit too thick for my liking and it was soaked in some very strong alcohol from the fire.  Yikes.  Probably the only hiccup of the evening.  That, and I could barely taste the flavor in the ice creams.

Excellent authentic Thai food for the price and very large servings.  Would come here again."

Hell, it is great for wedding proposals.  I love the interior!  Lots of thought and insight put into details.  You can tell they want it to have a lounge like appearance while still balancing a nice dinner menu.  The music is light and unlike most bar/dinner arrangements you can have an actual conversation and hear what the other person is saying at all times.  I went with the duck noodle soup.  It was in pho broth which was heavenly.  Inside my bowl was a huge duck leg complete with fat and skin.  May I say more please?  I loved it.  Right before I arrived, there was a couple who thanked the waiters countlessly over the great experience they just had.  That led me to believe only amazing things about Kitchen 79.

The food was either bland or way way too salty! We ordered a bunch of things and nothing tasted right. We had the turmeric chicken wings, they tasted old and soggy. The Indian pancakes were extremely greasy and so salty, though somewhat better tasting. 

The coconut milk soup was at the other extreme, very sweet. You could almost taste the cheap coconut milk from the can. The shrimps in the soup were thin and drenched in sweet milk. The red curry we had was alright (again too salty) but nothing special. 

The one positive was the staff. Everyone was very nice and attentive. 

Overall, a gimmicky Thai place with cheesy decor and overly salty food. We came out of there dehydrated and hungry. There are much better Thai places in the area, like Ayada Thai."

Service is standard and food is also standard. The staff is attentive but they&#39;re not the happiest bunch. My friend and I went all out with drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts, etc, but they proceeded to give us the check when we didn&#39;t ask for it. We completely understand when the restaurant is crowded and they need to clear out tables, but it was only 6:00 on a weekday night with only two tables besides us. Rather off putting; it basically tells customers &#34;Hey, you&#39;re done eating and you&#39;ve been here a little over an hour which is too long so please get out.&#34;

Food is decent, but not awesome and memorable. We can eat a better, hearty meal at Ayada for the same price and for the same service."

Kitchen 79 is a great addition to the multitude of Thai restaurants in Queens which includes one of my favorites SriPhaPhai. 

I came here with a friend for dinner on his recommendation and I&#39;ve been meaning to try it out after his rave about it and he was right. The food was spectacular. I had ordered the wild boar with spicy curry paste and the server actually warned me it was quite spicy. Now, when it comes to spice, I always say I can handle it and then regret it afterwards. I actually debated whether or not to get a different dish but I&#39;m so glad I stuck with my first choice. Thanks to the addition of the baby corn, Thai eggplant, and bamboo shoots for fresh vegetables, it toned down the spicy curry paste but it was still quite spicy. However, it was that really good kind of spice in spite of my low spice tolerance, I really enjoy. It burned but it burned good and still flavorful because of the basil leaves in the dish too. White rice helps as well.  As a specialty dish, it stands out.

Our service was excellent throughout the entire meal thanks to the attentive staff. The decor is dark and modern with the the black brick interlaced with white throughout the space. Some of the seating arrangements are a bit cramped but compared to other places in Manhattan, you could do a lot worse. 

Go for the Thai food at Kitchen 79. Happy eating and remember: Don&#39;t deny, satisfy!"

The lunch special is a great deal, for 8-9 bucks you get any appetizer with a small entree, I wish they had photos next to each meal since there are only really dinner pics on Yelp. I ordered some noodles and pork which was pretty good. My friend ordered the salmon, the sauce and mushrooms on that entree were really good. The ice teas were milky and had just the right amount of sweetness. I&#39;d definitely go back and try other things they have to offer.

Pros: good lunch menu, great atmosphere and decor.

Staff are amazing. Greeted, got me water, and unlike service we sometimes get, a genuine desire to help me figure out what to get. 
Not too hungry, I started with Tom Kha soup and a green Thai iced tea. 
The Green tea comes out in this huge mug. It was delicious. 
My soup was perfect. So flavorful. 
Then I decided to try out the papaya salad. I was deciding on getting it with crab or not. The waitress was honest and real. 
So I ordered without crab and spicy. 
Another home run. 
Place was not overly crowded but busy for sure. 
Everything was delicious. Staff were amazing and they had Planet of the Apes on as a bonus.

I&#39;m definitely coming here again. It&#39;s about an hour and a half away from where I live and I&#39;m coming here again. 

I arrived a couple minutes before my friend did. I was seated and given a menu while I waited. We had agreed to meet at 6:30 so the restaurant was pretty empty. (But boy did it fill up later on) I asked a waitress which Thai salad she thought was better and she went in great detail about the flavors and spice of each, which salad was most popular and which one was most authentic to Thai food. It was unexpected and much appreciated since my questions about dishes are usually responded with &#34;they are all good...&#39;why do you think they&#39;re on the menu...duh&#39;&#34;. 

My friend arrived and we ordered the green curry, pork satay, green mango salad and the tom yum soup. 

Pork satay (B)
The flavor was very good. It was super juicy and the peanut sauce and vinegar sauce that accompanied the pork were delicious as well. I would give this dish an A if the pork wasn&#39;t so chewy. I could barely eat the meat due to the really chewy fat. But great flavor. 

Mango salad (A)
Omg this was delicious. I asked for spicy and they definitely gave me spicy. It was sweet and sour and salty. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the mango was slightly sweet but had a great crunch to it. The cashews have a nice creaminess and small crunch and the spice was so spicy I started sweating, but it was fantastic and I loved every minute of it. 

Tom yum soup (A)
Definitely one of the better soups that I&#39;ve had. Tangy and perfectly sour. There was cauliflower in it which was surprising (but I love cauliflower so no complaint from me). I was able to get just vegetable Tom yum as well. Not as spicy as I would have liked but very very good. 

Green curry (B)
Not the best green curry I&#39;ve had, but not the worst. It was a little too watery for my liking. It wasn&#39;t spicy at all which I was a little disappointed about, but my friend is very sensitive to spice so it was perfect for her. She really enjoyed it and would give it an A. Each to their own. 

Great and very friendly service. Nicely decorated and there&#39;s a small little bar (seats about 5 or so people). Lots of mirrors and a nice ambiance at night."

So we thought!  I was the first to show up and was greeted by friendly staff.  Sat by the bar to wait for the rest of the group.  While I was debating whether to order Thai ice tea or not, a cold glass of water was placed in front of me.  I was impressed and grateful for that simple offer/service while I waited.  When the rest of the party arrived, we took quite a moment to decide as there were too many choices to choose from.
Finally decided on calamari (Pla Muk Tord), mango salad (Yum Ma Mong), flat noodles w/chicken and squid (Guay Tiew Khua Gai) and deep fried fish (Pla Toad Yum Ma Mong).  
Can I just say, we cleaned out our plates!!!! Everything was so good!  The calamari was just right, lightly breaded &amp; seasoned.  The mango salad was sweet, savory, a lil on the spicy side &amp; perfect.  My friend really wanted the mango salad AND papaya shreds, so for a small addtl $ they added it for us without grief.  If you&#39;re the type to stay safe and order Pad Thai, please, be adventurous and get the Guay Tiew Khua Gai.  You won&#39;t regret it. Promise.  And last but not least, the FISH!  It was soooo sooo good that the only thing left on the plate was part of the head/a bit of the tail.  Some might be weirded out by it but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do the same when you get there.

Decor was nice and modern. Really comfortable seats. Came here expecting cocktails but all they have is beer, wine and sake. Now, the food. Started with classic curry puffs but found them to be on the bland side. Tamarind duck was pretty good but nothing spectacular. Hate how they just throw some steamed vegetables on the side just to fill the plate. No flavor. Just straight up steamed vegetables. Also had the crispy pork eggplant basil but it was soooo good. Texture and flavor was all there. Fried green tea ice cream was mediocre. I&#39;ll give this place another chance solely based on the eggplant basil."

Rice noodle rarely travels well in a delivery order. It&#39;s either too mushy or hardens during transit--best to eat in. Their Pad Kee Mao noodle, however, travels well with good ice noodle texture and very good flavor. 

Their Pad Kra Prow is also quite delicious. Very Thai basil-y flavor and a good spice at both medium and spicy level (I&#39;m Korean but rarely order Thai spicy). 

The gaeng dang curry has good coconut milk taste and a slight sweetness. One thing I&#39;d add is Thai eggplant to the curry. That is where ayadathai gets it right. 

Moo Yaan/Neua Yang Nam Tok salad was something new and tasty. Tangy with grilled pork that is reminiscent of Thit Nuong. Similarly Moo Yaang salad has a similar flavor profile but with sticky rice. Both delicious."

We were kindly welcomed and gracefully served by a welcoming and attentive staff. The place has a sexy look... good for a romantic date. 

Labb with pork: although the minced pork was tasty, the greens that came with it were cut too big, and never really mixed well with it. It felt like eating plain lettuce with meat on the side. 

Moo yaang (grilled tender pork): although the meat was tender, it wasn&#39;t as hot as it should have been; also, the sauce was uninspiring. 

Phed ma kham (roasted duck in tamarind sauce...$18): this sauce instead was very good, and the portion size huge; however, the meat itself was kinda tough, and the steamed veggies beyond boring.

Overall, I only tasted three dishes, but because of the fact that they tend to be popular, they probably represented a general idea of the chef&#39;s skills. I found them ok, but with considerable issues that prevented them from being good. Despite the kind service, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d come back."

We had reservations &amp; were seated right away. There was one chair which is lower than others &amp; it was uncomfortable for my mom but when we tried to switch it at first they refused.. Eventually they gave us another chair when my uncle tried to ask for another chair. 

The service: the waitress is nice. But the food took forever to come. My food took the longest. It was so long to the point that everyone at the table were pretty much finished eating while I was still waiting for mine to arrive. Frustrated, so I just asked them to have my food to-go since it took forever and everyone were pretty much done. I had ordered pad see ew with shrimp (which is $2-$3 extra).. It was my mistake that I didn&#39;t check it (I was super frustrated by this time already). When I ate it the next day, I saw that it was pad see ew with chicken instead of the shrimp I ordered which is extra.

I didn&#39;t check my receipt if they charged me extra for the shrimp. At least it was only $2-3 extra. I still tipped them appropriately because that&#39;s just the way I am. But I definitely won&#39;t be coming back here, and neither the 12 of us who came that day. 

One star for the nice waitress. Another star for the food. But then again, I can&#39;t really remember how everything tasted like because I was so frustrated with this place."

-Fried Calamari - was okay, seemed a bit dry and heavy on the breading. I loved the spicy, sweet mayo though! 
-Crab fried rice - awesome! I&#39;m a fan of Thai style fried rice. Its not overly crabby which is good. It was moist and not oily. Good stuff!
-Panang Curry Chicken - was pretty good! The chicken wasn&#39;t dry and the curry tasted great! not super spicy if thats what you&#39;re looking for. 
-Kana moo khob/ Chinese broccoli &amp; fried pork - good and simple food (don&#39;t know why its a speciality lol). The Chinese broccoli was fresh and young, so it was sweet =] and the fatty pork added a nice touch
-Phed Ma Kham/Tamarind Duck - gotta say it was a little disappointing. The duck was pretty dry and didn&#39;t help that there wasn&#39;t much sauce to help compensate for that. Luckily for my party of 4 that there were 4 pieces. I&#39;ll pass on this one next time.
-Pla Sam Rod/Sweet &amp; Sour Fish - I liked this one better than the duck. It was fried well but I wish there was more sauce as it barely had enough to cover the fish. 

Overall not a bad experience. If I was in the immediate neighborhood I&#39;d stop by, but I&#39;ve had tastier Thai food around the city."

(Just like every other Thai place) There was also a bar (I believe full service) Our server was nice, very attentive in filling the water glass.

I ordered phaug tord (deep fried taro with a sweet chili sauce) and a tofu guay tiew pad see eiw. Both dishes were good, but not out of this world, haha. Prices were normal too."

We had the deep fried (non-breaded) taro for an appetiser and it was perfectly crunchy and dense and served with a sweet and spicy sauce. Then for entrees, we had a very spicy green curry with vegetables - excellent and flavourful, and a fried catfish dish with eggplant dish which was AMAZING (although we had to convince them to not bread it b/c my friend doesn&#39;t eat gluten - but they did, and it was sooooo good). 4 stars because I&#39;ve only gone once, but if it&#39;s as good the next time, 5 stars all the way!"

Started off with some apps, the Pla Muk Tord (calamari) crispy with a great sauce. Kanom Jeeb (friend dumpling) the sauce made them better but it drenched up more of the oil than I would have liked. The thai tea was great but would have been even better with some boba! We had a guay tiew rad nha noodle with chicken, the gravy made it better. And I liked a gauy tiew pad kee mau noodle better though. For dessert we had the lychee creme brulee, a MUST have SOO good creamy not too sweet, great consistency with pieces of lychee. Fried banana rolls with green tea ice cream was overall too sweet, maybe due to the honey on the plate also, but not bad. 

Cons: There&#39;s only about 12 tables inside and they don&#39;t take reservations for parties of less than 6. The parking is a little bit of a pain but that&#39;s jackson heights in general."

You get a fairly wide selection of starters--options cover one side of the menu--and the main courses are listed on the other side. 

In addition to the typical offerings, these guys offer quite a few alternatives for the jaded Thai food enthusiast. Spelled out with Thai script and names, some menu items sound unfamiliar but are actually dishes we know well.

It&#39;s not just the Thai iced coffee and tea that are big--the food portions are pretty generous too. Decor is tasteful, and the cushioned seats are comfy and inviting. The only distractions were the &#34;old digs smell&#34; when you first walk in, and the black tape used to patch up the bench cushions. Our waiter was friendly and accommodating.

Yum Woon Sen - 4.5 stars
Excellent balance of flavor. Maybe they toned down the tanginess, but I took a half star off because it lacked a little punch.

Ka Nom Jeep, fried chicken dumplings - 4 stars
Despite being a lunch special appetizer, its texture and sweet tangy sauce were surprisingly satisfying.

Pad Thai - 3 stars
Drenched with sauce. Not a good version of the classic.

Guay Tiew Pad Sei Eiw (a.k.a. Pad See Ew) - 3.5 stars
Also heavy on the sauce and very salty. This version lacks breadth of flavor.

Khao Phad, fried rice - 3.5 stars
Not bad. Avoid ordering it with beef. It was incredibly leathery.

Gaeng Kiew Warn, green curry with crispy pork - 4.5 stars
The crispy pork is similar to Chinese roasted pork belly, and is a refreshing choice of meat for all curries. The curry itself is pretty standard in taste--nothing wrong with reconstituted paste--but the bamboo shoots, peppers and meat were quality ingredients. 

Lots of novel items on the menu to try, so we&#39;ll be back!"

I liked the bit of embellishments on the wall and cool light fixtures. The food was average. It wasn&#39;t bad, but I&#39;ve had much better Thai food. I get the pad ke mao at most Thai places and the one here was just a bit too salty and the flavors weren&#39;t that pronounced because it was just a bit too salty. Other than my order, the other dishes my friends ordered were good and the creme brûlée was delicious. Would try this place again."

However Kitchen 79 topped it by just a tad. Tom yum soup was tangy, spicy and strong tomato-y flavor. I got the lunch special that comes with an appetizer and entree. I wanted the salad thinking it was a shredded mango or papaya one, but it came to the table looking like a regular old salad with some sauce on top. However, to my surprise it was delicious with the sweet peanut dressing, and was fresh-lettuce was crunchy and sprouts were not wilted. For my entree, I decided on the red curry with shrimp-the flavor was all there, more coconutty than curry but downfall was I would like it to be a thicker sauce. That aside, the shrimps were soaked with the flavor of the curry and had a nice texture. Onto my favorite part - Thai Green Tea Iced Tea, for $3 you get a huge mug and the flavor is unbelievable, tastes like a scoop of green tea ice cream melted into a cup of thai ice tea, I slightly like this better because it is less sweet. Service was impeccable, had water refills multiple times, and staff was attentive to clearing plates. Overall experience was top notch, I love this hidden gem and will be returning soon!"

How?! I don&#39;t even know. This place has quickly become my go-to Thai spot in Jackson Heights. I&#39;ve eaten here quite a few times (dinner and lunch special) and ordered take-out. 
My dine-in experience was absolutely wonderful. On my first visit, my bf and I each ordered an entree, and we quickly found out that although the portion is on the small side, we were  full before the end of our meal. On our next visit we each ordered from the lunch menu - again, small portions, but we were still satisfied. We&#39;ve also split a lunch special, along with a separate appetizer, and we were still full. So....don&#39;t be fooled by the portions. 
So far, I&#39;ve tried the 
- Red/Green curries: Delicious! They&#39;re creamy and full-bodied. The red curry is a medium on spice scale, but you can definitely ask to turn up the heat. 
- Pineapple fried rice: Standard compared to the other times I&#39;ve tried this dish
- Crispy calamari: Loved it! You get a huge serving of this, it almost feels like you&#39;re eating bottomless calamari. 
- Geoy Hor Cheese/Crab Rangoon: I was surprised to see this on the menu, but I&#39;m glad they have it. The wonton is so crispy, and the filling is above standard. 
- Geoy Nam: Ok, I usually get the crab rangoon with my lunch order, but I think I&#39;m going order this from now on. The soup is so light and refreshing. I could probably eat 10 chicken wontons - so good! 
- Pad Thai with beef - I asked for this to be medium spicy, and they weren&#39;t shy with the heat. Good. You know when you&#39;re eating something spicy but you don&#39;t stop because you still want to finish it? That was me lol. The dish overall was standard, but that might&#39;ve been because it was a delivery order.*
- Thai ice tea: Lovely, creamy &amp; sweet. When I first ordered this, I was shocked at how huge it was lol. For $3 you get twice the amount of thai iced tea you would usually get elsewhere. (Unless there is another Thai spot that serves you a bigger portion, because if so, LET ME KNOW!)  
- Thai iced coffee: Hard pass. I was expecting my drink to be a lot stronger. Instead, what I got was overly sweet and pretty watered down. I asked the waiter to remake it so that the flavor stronger/less watery, but I ended up with an even sweeter drink. I&#39;m not sure if this was a one time thing, or maybe a misunderstanding but I haven&#39;t ordered the coffee again. 
- Lychee creme brulee - New favorite dessert. No words needed to describe it. Just order it. 

I&#39;ve become a regular at Kitchen 79, and I&#39;ve actually stopped going to the nearby Thai restaurants because I love this place so much. My dine-in experiences have been perfect. This is such a cute place for date-night, or even for family dinner. The decor impressed me a lot. I felt like I was in a trendy Hell&#39;s Kitchen spot. The staff here is polite - they always check in to see if everything&#39;s going alright - especially the lady who I&#39;m guessing is either the manager or owner. The only thing I would ask them to improve on is the quality of their delivery orders. I didn&#39;t mind the wait (the wait time is accurate) but my order was below their standard quality so I was a little disappointed. Nevertheless, I&#39;ll still be ordering take-out on days I&#39;m too lazy to walk over.

Can you tell I love this place? I wrote an essay."

First off, it really is a nice space that&#39;s conducive to a pleasant evening out--even though I was here alone just getting off a flight. Ordered Khao Phad Ka Prow hot and on the latter I found it just right to my liking. Hate when you can tell they dumbed it down to mild because you don&#39;t look Thai (that&#39;d be me, Mr. Midwestern white boy). Ordered with pork which while quite good, there was not a lot of it. Savory, nice peppy basil and onions and the rice was quite tasty, seasoned about right. I note that I arrived on a late flight and was eating at 4:00 p.m. which is a recipe for poor food and service and locations. Not here.

I found this amusing and must pass it on: of course they serve Chang beer which almost any Thai restaurant with a liquor license will. They had bottles on display along with the wines, etc. The other prominent beer option? Here goes: Pabst Blue Ribbon... for those hipsters that just must I guess. Gross.

Ah well, nicely done Kitchen 79. You&#39;ve given the locals a pretty nice venue that has an intimate feel without having to leave the &#39;hood. If I lived here I&#39;d be returning for sure.

Overall:
Restaurant interior/design: 5 stars
Food: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars
Price: 3 stars ($11 for a plate of rice with a little meat... not overly impressed on this."

Fried Fish with pepper &amp; garlic(?) 2/5 The sauce was all the way on the bottom below the lettuce, below the fried fish was the lettuce. So I really got no sauce especially that it was literally like a spoon of it. I love flavor so I was lacking that, I even had to bathe my Fried fish in some of my sisters Red Curry. Otherwise the fish was fried nicely, veggies were fresh as well.

I thought we were going to eat some kind of Latin American food based on the neighborhood but once I walked in I realized that was not the case. It&#39;s a trendy joint considering the location. The menu is quite extensive, almost made it a bit hard choosing. 

The staff was quite friendly and considerate to us. I decided to try the Tom yum noodle soup with pork. The portions are quite large. I had a massive bowl brought to me. Thin strands of rice noodle, peanuts, and pork pieces filled the bowl. The soup had a nice sweet and sour kick to it with some spicy. I was able to choose the level of spicy. Overall it was good, probably up there with other good thai places I&#39;ve been to. I also tried the curry puff, papaya salad, coconut chicken mushroom soup, and calamari. All were good but my favorite was the salad and calamari. The calamari was very tender and crispy on the outside with a nice light flaky tangy bite. 

However my favorite thing I ate the whole night was the lychee creme brûlée. This thing was amazing. It really had a solid lychee taste in every bite. The creme brûlée had a nice top shell and smooth custard inside. I loved this! I would go back just for this."

This place is tiny, but it works. There&#39;s a very strange taxidermy-mini-GI-joes-fountain-ukele-haunted-house shrine by the bar. A really great work of art (?) to keep guests mystified while waiting for seats.

I like the food here better than Arunee Thai, which isn&#39;t bad to begin with. I ordered the lunch special of vegetables in angel hair noodles and yellow curry. Yum!!!! Service was great, very courteous. The bathroom is not for the claustrophobic, but it works. Only rub was that in a group of six of us, food came to us one or two dishes at a time (they probably have a small kitchen), but after we dug in, not complaining, because the food more than makes up.

Their Thai iced tea looks intimidatingly large. I&#39;ve never seen people drink it out of flower vases before."

I had the pad kee Mao with shrimp and it was perfect! Would&#39;ve preferred a bit more bell peppers but it was very delicious. 

Appetizer I had the cream cheese dumplings which were mouth watering ! I wish I had ordered more. And the tofu for appetizer was really realllly good. So surprised how good those apps were ! 

And for desert I had the fried ice cream with coconut ice cream and wow was that good. I&#39;m usually not a fried ice cream kinda person but I def could&#39;ve had seconds.

Pla Muk Tord - Crispy Calamari, amazing amazing amazing. Get this! There is a substantial amount of calamari and it is not drenching in oil, unlike other experiences I had. 

Som Tum Thai Salad - Refreshing. The peanuts with the papaya, make the perfect marriage. 

Khao Phad Nuea Poo - Best fried rice I had ever, and the crab meat did not have that rubbery texture. I recommend it!

Gaeny Dang Curry - I have never had green curry. This dish made me a lover of it. The dish way flavorful and milky, but not heavy. 

Pad Thai Noodle with beef - I recommend getting this classic dish! You know if a Thai restaurant is good if their Pad Thai dish tastes good. 

Gauy Tiew Yen Ta Fo Noodle- The waitress gave us some background information about this dish, which I very appreciated. She told us how the dish is more on the sweet side, which can throw people off. The dish is definitely something different, oh and the broth is pink! The fishballs were the highlight of this dish.

Suki Talay Noodle- Huge portion, can be shared with 2-3 people. The mussels tasted fresh. This is a good dish overall.

Phed Ma Kham (roasted duck in tamarind sauce) - is not too sour and very generous portion on the duck. Texture of duck was excellent.

Labb Gai (ground chicken salad) is also recommended (but maybe just slightly too salty for my taste.) Smells like it has fish sauce but I don&#39;t think it is indicated in the menu, so be sure to ask if you are allergic to fish sauce.

Talk about the interior design, the restaurant looks nice and clean with subway tile black &amp; white. They put black crystal chandelier in the corner of the room which is make the restaurant look chic &amp; modern. And on the wall, they put some designing mirrors which makes the room looks bigger and has something to look at. Even the restaurant is limited space but they are setting up the table very well ( not too tight ) and also has some private sections on the window tables and the corner inside the restaurant.
Food...I usually get the same things. There are 2 of my favorite main course, first is Kana Moo Krob ( crispy pork with Chinese broccoli ), believe me.....it&#39;s hard to find this kind of crispy pork that not too hard and has some meat on it.and second Poo Nim Kratiem ( soft shell crab with garlic ), the order comes with 2 pcs of soft shell crab on top with garlic sauce and steamed broccoli, I can eat this dish everyday.

1. Fried calamari ($7) &amp; fried wontons ($5/5pcs): They were so great. Crispy and not overly oily or fried. We inhaled it all. 

2. Chicken pad thai was perfectly done. Texture was on point with enough flavor and sauce to go around. 

3. Beef masaman curry: For the first time, I think I&#39;ve gotten more beef than the curry itself. Beef was a little tough and could have been more tender. 

4. Beef pineapple fried rice: The flavor was not what I was used to in other thai restaurants. It was odd and we all couldn&#39;t even take a second bite. It was much better the next day when I refried it with egg and some kitchen. 

5. Shrimp drunken noodles: The flavor was nice and spicy and the shrimp was big and succulent. 

6. Asian broccoli with pork: I loved how the pork actually tasted like pork belly with it&#39;s tender flesh and melting fat unlike a lot of other thai places. It could have been a little less salty but overall, it was good.

I have ordered their Tofu Pad Thai a lot and it is always savory, with plentiful of tofu. My sister adores their Pineapple Fried Rice. 
Their Kamon Jeeb/chicken dumplings are absolutely delicious. OUR FAVS
Last night I tried their Peek Gai Mak Khamin Tord (chicken wings.) They were a bit spicy and sour upon the first bites but it becomes an acquired taste.

My friend and I ordered the deluxe ramen. Maybe I was just super hungry and every minute felt like an hour, but it was pretty slow to come out.

The ramen was okay - portions were typical for a ramen place. The broth was okay, maybe a tad salty, but nothing to complain about but also nothing to brag about. Pretty much, it was decent. Not the best ramen I&#39;ve ever had and not the worst.

Setting: Cute ambiance, hipster like feel with mason jar cups and wooden seats and table 

Appetizer 
1) Gyoza - 3 stars
Pork- it had a strong gingery taste, which in my opinions delicious! You can definitely taste the pork.
-The vinigar sauce mixed perfectly with the flavor and not overpowering
-My only gripe it that they were small little bits, 6 pieces in total

2) Steamed pork buns - 3 stars
-Thick buns, with lettuce for a bit of a crunch, however the meat although tender and juicy was on the small side.
-They topped it off with a mix sweet and tany sauce that was pretty good, but it did over power the meat since the pieces were small
-It would be something to try at least once, but I wouldn&#39;t say it is great.  

Main:
1) Truffle tan tan ramen - 5 stars
-If you like a sweet, crunchy mix this is the one to get!
-You can smell the truffle from a mile away, but surprisingly not an overpowering taste. It blended very well and for not having broth, it melt my mouth away.
-Along with the blend of truffle, it has a light cheese type taste, with a crunch from the fried/candied toppings they put on. Although seems pretty weird describing, it was delicious!
-I do warn that if you don&#39;t eat it fast enough the sauce gets soaked up by the noodles and it gets thicker.
-This was definitely something worth trying especially for a different type of concept of ramen and a unique taste.

2) Zurutto Chicken Ramen - 3 stars
(Ordered by my friend)
-Thick broth, salter then the Truffle Ramen
-Meat was ok, shredded easily when you take a bite (thank god, because I am not too fond of tough meat), but in my opinion it had a weird taste, almost like a gamy taste
-My friend on the other hand thought it was one of the best he has had. So it is up to you to give it a try.

Noodles: Thick and wavy to perfection. 

Overall: More of a 3.5 star place. I would come here again, but it wouldn&#39;t be something I would crav on a daily. Maybe for special concept cravings."

Decent ramen, their zurutto ramen is actually quite good...however...the after taste is very strong and WILL stay in your mouth for a while, even a mint doesn&#39;t help. Likely because the broth is quite thick and flavorful, they also put onions and scallions in the ramen, so that doesn&#39;t help. I enjoyed the noodles during the meal but after was not happy with the aftertaste in my mouth. 

Their truffle dandan noodle is overwhelming and too truffly for me. They use truffle oil which I&#39;m not a fan of since the taste is super strong and too fake. The noodles itself is al dente which is nice so if you like Dan Dan noodles and not a big truffle oil fan, make sure to ask them to not add the truffle oil.

Fortunately, our experience overall was still very good. They have various Japanese beers on draft, and I had a delectable craft Japanese IPA (a bit over priced but very good, $10). As for food, we got karaage, pork gyoza, and pork buns. All were a bit over priced, but we&#39;re in New York, right? All the dishes also did the trick in terms of quantity and unique flavors; I really liked the karaage dipping sauce, and the sauce on the buns had a nice kick.

I wanted to dislike this place because admittedly, I am a bit contrarian. I do not like following food trends and I am growing tired of the endless odes and debates about the best bowl of ramen here in NYC.

Zurutto has a lot of NYC restaurant cliches. It is located on the UWS with the open concept kitchen so you can see their genius at work. Their decor has lots of shou sugi ban style wood on the walls, a nice touch. One cliche it didn&#39;t have is that the tables are not too close together, which I appreciated.

Menus were placed on the table by our server without a greeting. One side is several varieties of ramen, the other has the gyoza choices. We both got the Zurutto ramen. The broth was very rich and flavorful, with tons of yummy umame notes. The pork had a really nice char but was still tender. The noodles were so good. The corn adds a nice sweetness and texture. This is a place that you would give a portion of your 401K for the broth recipe. [I make soup all the time and I am still thinking about this broth, trying to decipher it] This is winter comfort food at its best. It was so filling that I didn&#39;t want dinner that evening.

There were lots of gyoza choices, all of which looked great. There is a happy hour menu too. Lots of great beer choices. I would come back for them.

Prices were beyond reasonable. Lunch for two people was under $30.

I&#39;m no ramen connoisseur by any means, but I definitely liked this bowl of ramen! In particular, the thick broth was enjoyable. No matter how full I am, I find myself slurping up every last drop. The pork buns were a good appetizer, good for sharing as they come in orders of two. However, my favorite appetizer was the karaage (fried chicken). Squeeze some lemon, dip in the sauce, and enjoy!

Not a large menu to work with at first glance. However, they have your solid ramen options with a few snacks as well. Decided on the Spicy Zurutto Ramen ($13) and a Hot Sake ($10) to wash it down. Big bowl of buttery noodles in a medium-thick broth. Pork on top is crisped well and fatty, with a solid amount of your typical veggies and the sliced hard boiled egg. Comforting all around. I also had a bit of the Vegetable Soy Ramen ($15), which had even butterier noodles and thicker broth (wonderful). Sake is a nice compliment - not too strong.

Service here is accommodating - despite the menu stating otherwise, we were able to make ingredient modifications. Next time I stop by, want to try the Karaage. Side note, where did the french fries go??"

I have never ordered a bowl of ramen that I did not like. There are simply places that I like more than others. Besides having an unpronounceable name, this Ramen and Gyoza place is nothing special. 

The Gyoza was on the smaller side and unevenly cooked. Half of the dumplings had a nice sear but other side were undercooked with sticky skin.  The filling was tender and juicy but no other flavor than the pork. The Takoyaki had lots of tasty components, salty bonita flakes, cream sauce and sweet sauce, the inside was creamy. 

The spicy chicken ramen was not very good at all. I ordered extra noodles which they put into the bowl instead on the side which made the broth too thick and starchy. The broth was fatty and salty but lack any real chicken flavor. The noodles were thick and wavy. The Pork was tough. The canned corn, bits of cabbage, and ribbons of scallions added some much needed freshness. It was filling but nothing else really comes to mind."

The takoyaki is one of the best we&#39;ve ever tasted and trust me, we have tried a lot, including some in Japan. Chicken karaage is very good too. In comparison, the gyoza is just average. 

The best part about the ramen was the char-siu, which has a great charbroiled flavor not found in usual Japanese char-siu. The noodle was lovely and I&#39;m not too sure I like the chicken broth. It&#39;s a little thick for my taste. But overall, we were so satisfied and happy that we picked this little joint for dinner."

Had the zurutto ramen for lunch and was full at the end of my meal. The noodles were good but as someone already mentioned, the broth was thick and had a lot of soy. Since I do enjoy salt, I did enjoy the broth although I can&#39;t eat this meal everyday! My biggest complaint was the cha-sui. It had an aggressively charred taste and was pure fat. Bummer. 

I&#39;ll give this spot one more try since it&#39;s the only ramen in the neighborhood. Some of the other things on the menu looked good too, so we shall see."
zurutto-ramen-and-gyoza-bar-new-york-2,Allene T.,APoAugdz6nscL4HjF4Oryg,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,1,1808,111,wq-v1LJMlJBYRjYEvBYo9g,4.0,2016-04-30,"3.5 stars rounded up because the SO liked this place a lot.

Zurutto is a very much welcomed newcomer in the ramen business in the Upper West Side, where good Asian food is hard to come by.  It&#39;s location on 72nd between Broadway and Columbus is excellent and easy to access from the subway stations.  While dining here on a Saturday evening, you could tell this was definitely the UWS as there were about a bajillion children under the age of 7 dining with their parents and stuffing noodles into their mouths with their bare hands.  I also wouldn&#39;t call this a &#34;gyoza bar&#34; given there&#39;s only 3 choices of gyoza to be had.

There is a clipboard similar to that of Totto&#39;s where you put your name down and the # of your party.  We only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table, and as the night went on, there were plenty of tables all around.  Service was okay - though all the ladies were very nice, I had a water jug with no cup to drink my water with for about 15 minutes until we had to ask for one.  It also took us about 20 minutes after our appetizer to finally get our ramen.  I was yawning and sleepy at that point.

The space is actually quite nice - very spacious and you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re enjoying your dinner with the table next to you.  It also doesn&#39;t smell inside and the lighting is great.  Music is interesting.

They sell my favorite beer - Kagua Rouge and Kagua Blanc here!  Definitely try this if you can.

The takoyaki (8 for $7) was delicious.  It tasted as takoyaki should taste and I have no complaints here, except maybe that it could have been more hot (burn-your-tongue-hot).  I would recommend getting this as an appetizer.

For the ramen, the SO and I both got the $13 spicy Zurutto (miso) ramen.  The broth is made of chicken, like that of Totto.  Sodium levels were not off the charts, as is the case with many Japanese noodle soups.  MSG level seems to be fine, as I&#39;m not currently dying of thirst.  I liked the consistency of the broth - not too rich, not too thin, but I did find that it had a sweet flavor to it that I didn&#39;t really like as much - perhaps from the miso?  I don&#39;t typically like miso broths and usually get tonkotsu, so that may be the case.  This ramen also came with onions, cabbage, and corn, which the first two I found to be interesting additions.  The ground pork was nothing to call home about and neither was the char siu.  However, I must say that the egg was probably the most perfect egg I&#39;ve eaten in a long, long time.  Noodles were the curly kind and perfectly al dente.

Overall, I&#39;d say this is a decent place for ramen in the UWS and I will likely be here again, since the SO said he really enjoyed it (maybe more than me)."

Wasn&#39;t too packed, I was afraid we&#39;d have to wait on line but we were seated right away by friendly staff.  There is some chill trance music playing in the background and the establishment is nice and clean. 

Gyoza is average and it seemed like it was cooked first and then just pan fried for a few seconds. Thought it was a bit odd that they gave us a piece of lemon alongside. 

Karaage uses dark meat and was generally pretty good. 

Tsukemen&#39;s broth is tasty and the noodles are chewy.  The broth also contains some sweet seaweed, don&#39;t forget to eat it because it sinks to the bottom!  

Almond tofu pudding dessert is different from the traditional Chinese one!  It&#39;s very milky and more like a pudding.  I was disappointed to find that the berries they put on top were still frozen when they served it to us.

Overall my experience wasn&#39;t too bad. However, since it is pretty far from where I live and work, I don&#39;t see myself coming back here again."

Broth had a sweet/starchy/cloying character. As if they just dumped the whole can of corn into it without bothering to drain or rinse it. I am no ramen expert so it&#39;s possible this is just a different style of ramen that I am not used to. But I have been to five or six ramen joints around the city, and basically loved them all (Jin Ramen, about 10 blocks uptown, is great) and never come across this kind of thing. Sorry to be a downer -- if my displeasure is just due to my being an unsophisticated white guy, I can accept the blame, but the rest of you unsophisticated white guys should consider yourselves warned."

Unfortunately this place was not impressive at all. Usually when you walk into a Japanese restaurant or even Chinese restaurant you will see a mixture of Asian ethnicities which usually hints that the place will be pretty authentic. At this particular spot, that was not the case. This spot was filled with white American customers which often makes me feel some type of way when this happens at any &#34;Asian&#34; restaurant. I start wondering if the people inside even know what actual authentic food taste like.

That being said... I took a look at the menu and saw fries as an appetizer. Thought that was weird but was curious to why a Japanese ramen spot would choose to have fries on their menu. I ordered them and was pretty grossed out. They were deli fries. Thick soggy with mayo and some type of tangy sauce dripped on top. 

Next...

I ordered the Vegetarian Ramen which had zero protein in it. No tofu just broth, noodles and vegetables but was the same price as a bowl of ramen with chicken or beef. How does that even make sense? Something gross about my ramen too was how it had kimchi in it. The flavor of the kimchi over powered my bowl of ramen. I was just not impressed at all. Zurutto needs to go to Totto Ramen in Hells Kitchen and get some serious pointers on how to make actual quality ramen. There&#39;s a reason Totto Ramen is filled with a mixture of Asian ethnicity customers. It&#39;s authentic. Zurutto is the type of ramen place a person goes to that has no idea what quality ramen is. A place that is more westernized and not so much Japanese Authentic. 

Zurutto you&#39;re across from where I live and I plan on never going back. I&#39;d much rather travel to Totto Ramen for some actual quality ramen."

Most vegetarian gyoza I&#39;m not too much of a fan of, but they make it more flavorful than most and get it quite crispy.  Miso ramen broth is delicious and creamy (lots of salt if you&#39;re into that sort of thing) and the friend onions on top are always a winner.  Their beer selection is small but nice - recommend the kagua rouge.

Nice place to sit as well - small area but you&#39;re not on top of your neighbors and the decorations are very cool.

My one complaint: prices can be high for what you get.  I.e., the miso ramen is $15, and then it&#39;s another $2ish dollars for everything you want to add (and since the vegetable ramen doesn&#39;t include tofu/egg/other protein you might want to add some)."

Was fully prepared to be disappointed, given the history of mediocre new restaurants on 72nd, but came away optimistic about this spot&#39;s chances.

The interior features a nifty ocean mural up front and minimalist wood paneling throughout. The staff was young and hip, and the crowd was a mix of couples and friends and families of all ages.

Tried the pork bun, which could&#39;ve substituted cucumber for the limp green leaf lettuce but was otherwise very good - juicy pork, moist bun, lively Sriracha mayo.

Also had the chicken miso ramen and found it pretty distinctive. Broth was rich, creamy and cloudy but not oily at all. The salinity was perfect, and we added black pepper to balance out a slight sweetness from the miso. Noodles were excellent - thin and springy and perfectly chewy. The grilled pork was tender and nicely charred, and there was also ground chicken or pork (not sure which). There was no egg, but that might&#39;ve been because of the soft opening. Abundant corn and green onion added some good veggie flavor.

FWIW, the limited menu also included veggie ramen with soy milk as well as fried chicken and gyoza. There looked to be some interesting Japanese craft beers in the fridge as well. 

So there you have it - a good first impression and hopefully a worthy rival to nearby Jin."

However, I was very disappointed and can quite honestly say I had the worst bowl of ramen I have ever tasted here. I got the zarutto ramen and the tofu gyozas. The ramen noodles were lumped together which is the first sign that this was not gonna be a good meal. The broth was flavorless and had a very unappealing look to it since all the fried onions were getting completely soaked in the broth, turning into mush. The regular onions were overcooked and also very mushy along with the cabbage. Because the noodles were not correctly cooked the soup was very gummy from the noodle water. The consistency of the ingredients in the ramen was just very unappealing and everything was just very mushy and resembled a bowl of overcooked noodles with leftovers from the nigh before. The gyozas were also underwhelming, lacked flavor and texture. I would not come back again and would also not recommend this to place to anyone who is looking for a decent tasting bowl of ramen.

I usually sit at the counter because it give me an authentic feel of eating at a real ramen shop.

I want to like this place. I&#39;ve been here on opening day and I came back again to see if the food improved. Last time I had the miso ramen and this time I had the tan tan truffle ramen (mazemen style aka no broth). It sounded great in theory but it was boring and uninteresting in execution. Spicy but not tasty. Plus they use Kraft Parmesan. Love the service and want to love the place but been here 2x and haven&#39;t been wowed. Not ippudo or totto. Not even Jin ramen (just up the way) by a long shot. 

For being a Gyoza as well as a ramen bar, you would think they would more options for Gyoza other than adding radish or Cheese, but they only have one option. Buns are just ok. Gyoza is just ok. Ramen is mostly chicken broth based, which is fine but not that tasty or interesting. Service is so nice and great but just can&#39;t see myself coming back again unless the food gets better.

Although price at @$12 for the signature Zurutto ramen seems reasonable, the amount of ramen in the bowl is very little. I am small size, I do not even feel half-full!

The &#34;chicken broth&#39; is too starchy and sweet for my taste.

Definitely not a keeper!"

I&#39;ve had tantan ramen at a lot of other places so was excited to try it here. It was strained noodles with other flavoring but not soup-y as I wanted. I gave it a shot but wound up having to track the server down and ask for broth to add to it. She looked me in the eye and flat out said no. I said I would pay for it, and she laughed and said no that&#39;s not how it&#39;s made. I said I&#39;ve had tantan before with more broth. She laughed again at me and continued to refuse then walked away and went server to server whispering while looking at me and laughing as if I was an idiot for wanting broth. I asked another server who said he knew my request and would talk to her about it. Waited almost ten minutes as they stood there ignoring/refusing my request so I wound up telling them I didn&#39;t want the dish anymore and they took it away: they&#39;d rather waste food than allow a paying customer some broth. SO RUDE. I was being perfectly polite and even said I respect the culture and how the dish is made/should be eaten but that&#39;s what I wanted anyways and I was offering to pay. Totally out of line. I wish I had just gotten up and left without paying for the rest of the food but I was the respectful one.
Also there was no soap in the restroom, which a couple of servers used after I was in there. I went in to see if it had been refilled and it wasn&#39;t, so they&#39;re not a very clean bunch. I can&#39;t wait for them to shut down."
zurutto-ramen-and-gyoza-bar-new-york-2,Krash T.,q4Oz1c_OjGu_a8ZkP53Vnw,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",0,1,0,1,4,nWnn1fLV9Awu6Jncev44dQ,5.0,2016-09-23,"If you&#39;ve read my reviews, you know that I am from the Netherlands originally, spend a lot of time in Japan, and also in Nashville. My time in Japan is for business and with friends. I spend a lot of it eating Japanese food, as it becomes more and more prevalent in the US and more and more bad or so-so &#34;Japanese food&#34; places crop up.
So when I passed this unassuming storefront a few weeks ago, I paid little attention. From the window, it looked a little dark. There weren&#39;t many people inside. No menu in the window.
Pass.
This afternoon, trying to decide where to eat with a friend, I passed t again - the glass doors were open, there were menus to peruse just beyond the doorstep, and we were so intrigued by the phrase &#34;Ramen and gyoza bar&#34; that we resolved to stop in.
I rarely give five stars, because for me, a five star meal means I would eat there at least weekly if I could. Perhaps even daily. It means the best I&#39;ve had of at least one dish. It means surprisingly good, memorable, and not something I&#39;d expect to find duplicated elsewhere.
Am I glad we took a chance!
We began with edamame, just warm enough, not over-cooked, not too salty. Deceptively average.
Then, an order of the &#34;handmade&#34; gyoza. My eyebrow actually arched in surprise at this one, because I&#39;d never seen that advertised. There are places in Japan that still make their own gyoza, but fewer and fewer. In the US, this was my first. 
I confess, I have never had gyoza this good. Very slightly charred on the outside (which gave it a lovely kick), the filling was light on the tongue and heavy with flavor. There were scallions in it, very fresh, and something crunchy (I don&#39;t know what). The gyoza sauce, which in the wrong hands can be a vinegar-y disaster, was just warm enough to bring out all its flavor. 
In fact, the gyoza were so good that we ordered a second helping.
Takoyaki (octopus ball) seems to be gaining favor in America, so we tried that next. Shaved bonito covered the small savory balls. We bit into them and discovered a filling that made one of my lunch partners gasp with joy. Quite often ,takoyaki are loaded down with so much sweet sauce, it becomes impossible to enjoy the inside. Not so here; there was just enough sauce to please the palate, but not enough to interfere with the rest. Size matters here - too big, and they&#39;re difficult to eat without splashing. Too small, and you don&#39;t get the entire flavor. Half of one of these was a perfect mouthful.
The cucumber with sesame seeds was just that, beautifully sliced bite-sized pieces of mini-cucumber sprinkled with sesame seeds and a bit of soy sauce. Fresh, crunchy, a lovely between-course refresher.
The pork buns were delicious, with a slightly spicy sauce that brought out the flavor of the dough without obscuring the char siu. 
I have an absurd confession to make now. Instead of ordering ramen, we decided we&#39;d liked the gyoza so much that we&#39;d all have second helpings, along with the tofu salad. The salad did not disappoint; unusually good. And the gyoza?
Well, I&#39;ve said my piece.
A few other notes:
- We did see a lot of ramen bowls go by, and they looked splendid.
- We loved that the ramen is in chicken stock. One of us was allergic to shellfish, another to eggs, so having chicken stock and vegetarian offerings available will be a big plus on our next visit (which will be as soon as possible).
- Seating, very basic, is surprisingly comfortable.
The wait staff consisted of one young woman, who was marvelously unhurried while keeping an eye on everything.
*** All the websites I checked say the hours are 4:30 to 11:00 pm, but we ate lunch at about 12:45. So I would call to check.
I cannot recommend this place highly enough. I&#39;m going back tonight!"

I&#39;ll happily devour a bowl of slightly-below average ramen any day. That being said, I&#39;ll never go back to Zurutto. We ordered the Sesame Cucumber because it sounded refreshing and tasty. What was disappointing about it wasn&#39;t just the fact that it was one sliced cucumber with sesame oil and sesame seeds, but that it didn&#39;t taste good and didn&#39;t warrant the $6 tag. Next, came the Spicy Zurutto Ramen. The broth was unusually thick for a chicken broth, although it may have been the miso. Regardless, the flavor and texture of the broth wasn&#39;t good, and there was a hint of old-refrigerator-food flavor as well. The noodles were harder than most (though some prefer it so), and the boiled egg was cold. The only good part of the dish was the roasted pork, which was smokey and delicious. Anyways, if you&#39;re drunk and craving ramen in the area, it might satisfy your needs, but other than that, THUMBS DOWN!"

Staff/Maitre d&#39; - waitstaff extremely attentive, courteous and fun to chat with. Tonight I met Maki, the Matire d&#39;. Maki is pleasant + welcoming and pays very close attention to restaurant patrons needs and operations... 

Interior Decor: seating very comfortable and great design. Ramen bar too. Lighting - comfortable, no blaring lights. Noise level, low - you can actually hear yourself chatting with your friends as oppose to other new restaurants in the neighborhood. Cook staff behind the Ramen bar, friendly too.
 
The tableware: plates, sake bottle, water decanter and glass - great design.

Food/Menu: Wow, extremely fresh ingredients! Menu authentic. Ramen noodles cooked to perfection too. Great beverage menu:  Soda, Beer, Saki. I had the Spicy Ramen, with egg, pork, scallions, chicken broth - 5 stars! And, a bottle of hot house saki - dry and served &#34;hot&#34; temperature (as oppose to saki served luke warm at other restaurants).

I highly recommend visiting and supporting our new neighborly restaurant. You will be happy you did. Welcome to the neighborhood Zurutto!!"
zurutto-ramen-and-gyoza-bar-new-york-2,L D.,WISfeyytHFbSo0HPftOh7Q,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1,6,FOe51PN0GbQ5WQq9q8oPbA,2.0,2016-06-13,"Went there this past Saturday after noticing it as I walked down W 72nd with the family. It was on the other side of the street and while I waited for my kids/husband to finish shoe shopping I looked up the menu.  I spent a month in Japan some years ago eating my way around the country and then was back there not too long ago, so was super-excited to see a new Japanese place with ***okonomiyaki*** (which is super-delicious and not easy to find in the U.S.)  on the menu, and my husband was in the mood for a burger, which they also had on the online menu.  This was not &#34;menupages&#34; - it was the restaurant&#39;s actual website.  

So we sit down and prepare to order immediately upon sitting (b/c we have 2 kids under age 5 with us so we have to be quick in terms of ordering in restaurants - and we knew from the website that we wanted okonomiyaki, burger, gyoza, and miso ramen and a salad.)   Imagine our surprise and dismay when the waitress (who was very nice)  told us that neither okonomiyaki nor the hamburger nor the salad that we wanted are on the menu - they just don&#39;t make them anymore (and the restaurant has only been open about a month.) 

 In fact, about half of the items that were on the menu on the restaurant&#39;s website were not available, permanently.  When we then didn&#39;t know what else to get, they handed us laminated menu cards and we noticed they had scratched out in black marker about half the items.  Sigh. 

If the restaurant had updated their own website, we might still have gone and been less disappointed, or we could have said, hey, that menu doesn&#39;t work for us.  

We ended up getting takoyaki (octopus balls) which were good but slightly underdone compared to others I&#39;ve had in Japan.  We got 2 orders of gyoza (good) and miso ramen (ok, not the best) and an order of cucumber with sesame oil (very good.)  

Overall, the food was ok - good but not great.  We probably wouldn&#39;t go back as the menu was super limited - there were only 4 types of ramen and 3 gyoza (all were basic minced pork, which you can get plain, topped with cheese, or topped with radish.)  

Also, and this is a big deal on the UWS - for a casual restaurant,  it just wasn&#39;t &#34;kid friendly&#34;  - we are always prepared with books, toys, crayons, stickers, etc. for our kids, but a lot of parents aren&#39;t and then their kids act out while waiting for food which is annoying.  So, it is nice when the restaurant has a kids&#39; menu, place mats to color, juice on the menu (Zurutto did not have any juice, which is a special treat our children only get at restaurants.) They should also consider offering plastic cups with straws (our older kid can drink out of big glasses but it is definitely not as relaxing to have to be on alert to her potentially spilling or breaking it  - we tried to convince her to use her straw cup which we had with us, but it is fun for kids to have a different experience in the restaurant, just as it is fun for us adults.)  

There were several other families there with kids, and given this location and the fact that kids generally love, love, love dumplings and noodles, the Zurutto owners should figure out how to use this to their advantage. Our children did enjoy most the food we tried (more than my husband did - he just found it too salty.) 

Atlantic Grill and Isabella&#39;s are great about this stuff and Zurutto should go there and have a look at how those places handle children.  Zurutto won&#39;t last long in this neighborhood if they don&#39;t cater to families. 

Overall we were pretty disappointed but hope that Zurutto will expand the menu a bit in which case we will be back!"

The atmosphere was pretty generic (wood paneling, Edison bulbs, etc.). It&#39;s a big place and the tables were spaced well so you can avoid overhearing every detail of your neighbor&#39;s conversation. No wait for a table. Service was average for a ramen shop and all the servers and chefs shout &#34;Irasshaimase!&#34; to greet you as you walk in. 

The food, of course, is where this place shines. The pork buns were delicious. The ramen had really flavorful and thick broth. I usually prefer tonkotsu but for miso this was great. The noodles stayed firm. There were some weird ingredients (corn?), but all in all it was delicious. Would say this ramen was much more flavorful than Jin on the UWS. Overall 3 stars because it&#39;s still not on the level of the ramen places a little further downtown (Ippudo/Totto)."

HOWEVER, here I am leaving a review for my experience on 10/8 with Chef Menya Musashi from Tokyo.

We arrived before the line grew quite long. With seating for six people (!), I imagine the wait can get to be pretty painful. We waited for about 20 minutes before being seated when we arrived at 5:30. Our party was initially four people, but two decided to dine elsewhere when they were told that they couldn&#39;t split a bowl. Odd policy, in my opinion, but whatever. I&#39;ll play by the rules. I&#39;m glad I did, because this was the best ramen I have ever had. The star removed was for the sharing policy and for the possible variability of the experience.

The pork belly was tender with a good crisp on the outside and melted in my mouth. The noodles were perfectly chewy. The portion size was generous. The broth was incredibly rich, creamy, and flavorful with just the right amount of salt. The boiled egg was a touch overdone for my taste, but still enough yolk to add to the broth.

I think the biggest problem is that it&#39;s hard to write a review for a restaurant that changes chefs and ramen styles every month.

That being said, the concept of Ramen Lab by Sun Noodle, is genius. I love that I can have different types of ramen from all over the world. Like many real ramen shops in Japan, Ramen Lab is in a small space with standing room only. Inside the shop they only have room for 10-12 diners at once, but thankfully their turnover rate is quite high and people usually move quickly. I have seen this place accommodate for the disabled and elderly so don&#39;t let the standing rule dissuade you from eating here. 

Since their menu and chefs constantly change I&#39;m a bit hard pressed to write about their food. I&#39;ll write a bit about each individual residency, although most of them have come and gone. Despite this, please make sure you come and check out Ramen Lab at least twice, this way you can see the incredible changes between different checks from different regions. 

Shoki Ramen House - Tan Tan Tsukemen: Shoki Ramen House hails from Sacramento, CA and serves fresh and lighter styled ramen. They pride themselves on not using preservative ingredients and making a healthier ramen. The Tsukemen was quite different from styles I&#39;ve had in the past. Despite the broth looking heavy and strong, it was actually quite light and easy to eat. The toppings were all very fresh and seemed to showcase the ingredients itself. There was quite a heavy mushroom flavor to it. Do not expect heavy handed flavors in Shoki&#39;s Tsukemen.

Tsukemen.NYC - Tsukemen Ganja Style: When I walked in to Ramen Lab for the second time, I quickly realized how eccentric some of the chefs could be. The two masked chefs behind the counter looked up at me at the same, throwing me off completely. The Tsukemen Ganja Style also showed me how little I actually knew about Tsukemen. Placed in front of me was an unassuming bowl of noodles with two pieces of pork, an egg and a bowl of seemingly light broth. The broth was packed with heavy flavors that I long to have again. The eggs were done so perfectly that my friend actually ordered another one. I have had trouble trying to track this place down. If anyone knows where their storefront is located or how to try their amazing ramen again. PLEASE LET ME KNOW!

Chibakiya - Tokyo Shio Ramen: This residency is one of the reason I like Ramen Lab so much. It isn&#39;t very often that you get to try a ramen shop that is located around the globe in Japan. Shio Ramen is not something I usually order, as I usually prefer the deeper flavors of Shoyu Ramen. This time I made an exception that did not disappoint. The clear broth carried with it a nice mellow flavoring that perfectly accompanied the noodles. Their synergy between noodle and soup is something that is rarely seen. I will be visiting their shop in Japan soon!

We just made it in before the line started forming. Tiny standing room only ramen bar- authentic Japan feel :) We had the classic and modern Okinawa soba (Nov only), with spare ribs and the toasted egg. The noodles were nice and firm and the soup was flavorfully salty. I would go back, curious to see next month&#39;s special!"

This month, I was fortunate enough to encounter Chef Naoko Miura, one of the renown Japanese female chef, who has created numerous top-selling dish within the country.

Menu was rather simple with three options - soy sauce, green sauce and coconut dandan hiyachu. I went straight ahead with chef&#39;s recommendation green sauce hiyachu. Amazing! The green chive sauce merited itself so well with the well-cooked, yet still chewy noodles; and the chashu carried a light refreshing scent, so as to make the whole plate of cold noodle more well balanced. Portion size was also just about right, leaving me satisfied, yet not stuffed.

You would have to stand in front of the counter to eat at ramen lab, and I guess this was my first time trying to eat something without a seat. Nevertheless you actually got a better view of how chef Miura worked with the gang. I love every single slurp of my noodle, very well done!

Now I&#39;m thinking about returning on a later day, to try out other possibilities. After all, eating ramen is a lifelong process."

It is a pop-up kitchen in which each month a different well-known chef showcases their ramen creations. Therefore, it is difficult to give it a star rating since the menu changes every month. For this particular visit, I&#39;d give it a 3.5 stars. I went here during Chef Naoka Miura&#39;s month (August 2016). Her ramen theme was HiyaChu, which is short for Hiyashi Chuka, a cold ramen dish typically eaten during the summer. 

I went with the Green Sauce Hiyachu. It is green onions minced into a pesto-like sauce. The sauce had good flavor and the noodles were cooked just right. I didn&#39;t care for the sliced pork or the minced tuna. It was flavorless and didn&#39;t add much to the dish. I prefer ramen in broth.

It&#39;s a really small place. There&#39;s a counter and you basically stand while eating the ramen. They have stools in front of the store if you really have to sit, but then the place would be even more cramped. Not a good place for big groups or families with young children."

Me &amp; my friend came here because were both craving for ramen. Got there almost 7pm. We waited about 20mins to get in. I didn&#39;t expect that this place is very tiny that theirs no chair &amp; you&#39;re gonna be standing while eating you&#39;re ramen. Actually its not that bad. Its fun! 

For drinks we ordered their cold tea in a bottle drink. Ehh, I didn&#39;t like it because its unsweetend so I returned mine.

- Tonkotsu broth (pork bone 豚骨)

- Buta kakuni 

- Thick springy noodles

i like the noodle very much, it&#39;s springy, thick (thickier than soba, thinner than udon).

the buta kakuni was good, melt in your mouth, it was ok.
may be because the broth was too rich that overwhelmed.

1 star was deducted from the Tonkotsu broth,
the broth was rich, it had a little touch of sour taste, 
it also had a few tiny pork meat in the dipping sauce,
there was a layer of red oil on top,

um ... it&#39;s overly oily, greasy, ... may be better in winter when u r crave for the calories, but it&#39;s not right for the autumn.

but i bottom up the soup :p, anyway, not in one shot, may be four.

if u like Tonkotsu broth or Buta kakuni (or both). it will not disappoint u.

i might want to try the shoyu, because i really like their noodle.

Word on the street is that this place is owned by Sun Noodles, a company that makes ramen noodles for most places in the country (they are delicious btw). The chef/operator rotates on a 2/3 month basis where different styles of ramen are featured from each new concept. Brilliant if you ask me. 

I had the pleasure of eating a brilliant tonkatsu from two gentleman straight from Tokyo. As noted above, the noodles were amazing. The pork broth and egg were just silly and all in all, a comforting experience. That&#39;s what I love about great soups, the way they make you feel when you&#39;re finished...satisfied and tired. :) This ramen made me extremely happy after a long day of humping around New York City and was really one of the better soups I&#39;ve had in a while. 

I&#39;m not sure when this &#34;team/concept&#34; is finished and the new one in but, if I were you I&#39;d get here ASAP. 5 stars all around, kampai!"

I went when there was a guess chef and it was a cool experience since it is an open kitchen and you could see everything that is going on. I thought it was amusing the humongous pots of stock being heated up, these things were gigantic! The team of three really prepared the food seamlessly in such tight quarters, I commend them for that. 

The food:

Tonkotsu Kimchi Ramen- Overall, I thought the ramen was just OK. I think my two big issues were the broth and noodles. The Kimchi broth was surprisingly mild in flavor, when I think Kimchi, I think big bold in your face flavors, sadly this was not. Also, I thought the noddles were too chewy/hard, it seemed like if this was pasta, it would be too al dente. My favorite part of the dish was the egg, the egg was cooked to perfection, the char siu pork was good, a little over but still OK. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ByORGOZXfIiXYTladtEF2A&amp;userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA"

------

Another chef at the Ramen Lab, and from Japan?!? Great!!  This month chef Kenji Chiba from Chibakiya is welcomed to the lab and has his shoyu ramen on showcase here.  All the ones on the menu are variations of his ramen.  His Tokyo Shoyu Ramen has the base shoyu ramen with bamboo shoots, scallion, nori, naruto and one piece of Chashu.  He then has an option that adds an egg, and finally, the Chashu-Men contains extra pieces of Chashu (five total!) but note that the egg is not included here and you would have to get that separately.

I opted to get the Chashu-Men with egg.  I have to say that the broth here is light, and divine!  I loved this broth so much that my entire plate was empty!  The chashu was good, but nothing I would entirely rave about.  However, the deliciousness of the broth and noodles was the star of the show here.  I feel that you get a nice helping of noodles and the Chashu-Men size really fills you up with all the pork added on to the dish.  The egg is something I would recommend getting, as it is prepared great!

If you enjoy ramen (especially shoyu ramen), make sure you take some time to check out Ramen Lab this month!"

The noodles have such a delectable texture: the perfect balance between al dente and soft. I could have eaten two bowls of just that alone. What amazed me even more though was the broth: normally I find shoyu bases to either be much too soy-sauce-y or just plain not interesting enough, but Chibakiya&#39;s was well-flavored but also very subtle at the same time. It wasn&#39;t overly salty but all of the ingredients within absorbed the broth to just the right extent to reach maximum flavor without being too heavy. 

Would recommend going for lunch since they&#39;re now open for it on more days and the line is much shorter! I opted for the first option (without the egg) but I&#39;m sure all of them are good!"

They&#39;ve got our 4.8/5.0 in the bag and here&#39;s why.

Quality ramen in the U.S. supplied by Sun Noodles, goes pretty much hand in hand with every great establishment in New York.  It&#39;s no secret that Ramen Lab would lead the forefront of this charge from when they first opened with Chef Jack Nakamura operating and setting the tone for others to follow.

I met up with three others around 7pm, as there&#39;s no reservations, you write your name down on a board by the door entrance (within the vestibule).  The wait time lasted for no more than a half hour, decent given the time we showed up. If you arrived an hour earlier, there&#39;s probably little to no wait at all.  Their choices are listed on the wall and there&#39;s little in the way of ambiguity of decision-making, which makes order-taking simple, efficient, and straightforward.  That part happens when they call your name to enter.  It&#39;s standing room only, as can be expected, and cash only.

This season, Ramen Tetsuya from Sapporo, Japan holds residency, the same Tetsuya Brothers Ramen known to specialize in Shoyu.  Oddly, they offered miso tonkotsu here and serve it particularly well.  I was not decidedly hungry so I ordered a regular, my friend ordered one with the seasoned egg.

The ramen arrived lightning fast (well, within 5 minutes of entering) and we were able to snap photos, yet still have steaming hot ramen awaiting us after ten minutes of photo-snapping obnoxious fun.

There were a couple pieces of decent sized chashu sitting above the broth, but the broth is what made the meal, in addition to the nice chew from the ramen noodles.  I nearly finished the broth. It was that good!  It&#39;s no secret that other restaurants may offer an extra side of noodles so you can finish it along with the broth, but that is not an option here.

As the staff here were very professional and worked quickly, there were no complaints to be had other than the familiar waiting period and that there were no seats to be found except a couple of makeshift ones outside by the vestibule. Beyond that they&#39;ve earned their stars. 4.8/5.0"

The barometric pressure was at a low and dropping to 30.07 inHg which is a perfect catalyst for an earthy bowl of tonkotsu broth tsukumen style ramen.  Although, I wasn&#39;t sure if they offered a tsukumen atsumari style, the execution was flawless and worth every minute of the wait.  

I always like to begin my ramen journey with a quarter spoon full of the broth to coat the palates and attempt to identify the robust flavor profile-- all while making eye contact with the chef and appreciating the work of art it has created a couple feet away.

The soup base was fantastic and immediately my recollections of the time I had one of the best bowls of ramen began to surface.  However, this shop was in hatagaya station-Shibuya, but you get the point, same calibre and on point.  I will definitely be back for more as I love the stand up stall type of places.  

The only thing I would improve is heating the ceramic bowls longer in the water boil so the exothermic process of dissipating the heat transfer to the broth is retained for a longer duration while one enjoys the ramen til&#39; completion. Nonetheless, this made the overcast gloomy day all that much brighter and I cannot wait to return for round two~"

At first, I was confused by their concept - with the different chefs.  I felt they didn&#39;t have an identity and it would be hard to make me a repeat customer.  I&#39;ve been here twice now and I can officially say I love this place!  I love the different chefs coming in every few weeks.  I like being able to sample different types of ramens and meeting different chefs, even if the ramen isn&#39;t great.  I like the variety offered and I can honestly say it will keep me coming back in the future to check out new chefs and their menu.

My review for Ramen Lab itself is 4 stars. I am a return customer.  There is a lady here with short hair and she is really nice!  I&#39;ve seen her during the Shoki Ramen and Hiyachu takeover.  It really pays to have good service.  The place is small and at first, I wasn&#39;t sure how that would work.  I was dreading the standing and no seats too, but I actually like the concept a lot!  It doesn&#39;t take long to eat a bowl of noodles anyway and I don&#39;t mind standing.  I am a slow eater so being forced to stand helps my digestion and makes me eat faster, which is fine by me.  I also think the row of bar seats is perfect since customers generally eat quickly and the turnover is pretty fast or as fast as can be.  Having seats would probably  encourage people to stay longer.  

Hiyachu Popup Review:

Coconut Dandan - I loved this one. This was my favorite out of the 3 we tried. I was skeptical about the cold noodles&#39; ability to cool me down, but after taking a few bites, I was feeling really refreshed.  The noodles were nice and springy and tasted really fresh.  I was afraid the coldness would make the noodles hard, but it wasn&#39;t.  The coconut dandan flavor was subtle so it&#39;s not heavy at all.  The chashu, even though it was cold, was very tasty.  It wasn&#39;t melt in your mouth, but that was all right since I welcomed the bite. The egg, even though cold, was also very tasty. You could really taste the freshness of it and the yolk was even still slightly runny even though it was cold! 

Green Sauce - everything was basically the same as above w the exception of the green sauce. The green sauce is good, but after a while, it is a little overwhelming and much. I enjoyed this, but I wouldn&#39;t order it again. 

Black Vinegar - same for this one w the exception of the soy sauce.  The soy sauce was delicious and I&#39;d eat this again! 

The Hiyachu chef is looking to open a b/m in Oahu.  I wish her luck and success.  Having a ramen spot that dedicates itself to hiyashi chuka in a hot climate is great and I think it&#39;ll do well provided they find their niche and come up with a worthy menu."

So rather, let me just say that the concept is excellent. No one can go to Japan every month on food tasting trips, so this is a good way for chefs to come, have a residency and get food. 

Some of the featured chefs have gone on to create their own restaurants, and what is here is a sneak preview. 

Whoever is here, the place is small and turns over quickly. The absolute best time to come is early in the week (even for lunch) on a good day. I went on a recent Monday and the wait was under 5 minutes. For those willing to brave the cold or rain, the line can look longer than it actually is. 

Come, have a great bowl of ramen, and then leave a few minutes later. It&#39;s fast, efficient, fun eating."

The place had a nice food court and they occasionally opened an event that inviting great ramen chef from Japan. I really enjoyed the time whenver they opened those event and those ramens were remarkable. I was very frustrated when they stopped on opening those event, and was missing so much on those great bowls of ramen that I have eaten.

Ramen lab was the one. I was so happy when I found ramen lab. This place is running with just same idea with those event that Yahwan market had. They invite great ramen chefs from all place to serve us good bowl of ramen. What a sensational idea! This must be great addition to NYC, so happy that this place is exist in New York. 

After few month from my last visit, I checked from their website that they have chef from Sapporo Japan until 2/20. I was like I cannot miss this and went to spot with my girlfriend. This was 5th times that I been to this place. I know place is small and there is almost 30+ wait time yet this time was bit longer than user. My expectation became higher as I could guess that Ramen Tetsuya must have great reputation. I waited 85min to get my spot. After long time of wait, Tetsuya sang handed me a bowl- wow... all

It&#39;s a great concept, with rotating chefs &amp; Pop-ups visiting their restaurant space. The establishment is quite small - about 10 standing &#39;seats&#39; at the bar. I was pretty intimidated at the thought of not sitting, but it&#39;s nice to be able to watch the chefs assemble your ramen and the standing room only makes the line go by pretty quickly. 

The Machita Shoten experience in itself was ideal. With bass heavy music thumping, it set the perfect casual, party-esque atmosphere.  The broth for all ramen types had a great flavor and depth to it and I absolutely loved the thick noodles. Food portions were spot on - I left very satisfied and full, but not to the point of self loathing or food coma.

The first time was a while ago, so forgive me for forgetting the name of the ramen joint that took residency here. As others have said, Ramen Lab serves as a venue for outside ramen places from around the word. Both times I have visited, the ramen chefs have come from Japan. The name Ramen Lab makes a lot of sense since it seems that these businesses are experimenting with the New York crowd without have a permanent business here. 

The place is small, about 10 seats, and you actually eat standing, so be prepared for that. The wait likely would not exceed 30 minutes. My first experience here was excellent. My second experience was from Machida Shoten from Japan (March 2016), which was also good. I&#39;ve noticed that Japanese people are very friendly, and they love greeting you but can get quite loud and yell at you in Japanese, so be prepared for that, too! 

I love Ramen Lab and its concept. The continuous change at this ramen venue encourages customers to keep coming back to try new ramen, which is good for their business and good for the customers who love trying new ramen. Follow them on Facebook to get news on who will take residency at Ramen Lab next.

I came on a Monday evening around 8 so luckily there was no real wait for a &#34;seat&#34;. Note no seats exist. You stand while you eat on a counter facing the cooks while they prepare the ramen and it can only probably fit 10 people at a time. I actually really appreciated it because they say standing is better for your digestion anyway.

It seems typically they have 3-4 ramen choices and it changes seasonally. My boyfriend and I were going to do shoyu ramen with egg but fortunately, they had just started offering shio ramen with egg as well so we did one of each. Shoyu ramen was a soy sauce base broth and the shio was a salt base ramen. Both were absolutely delicious. Both ramens contained two halves of egg, bamboo shoots, nori, naruto and chasu pork. The shoyu sauce definitely had more of the deep darker look, with more of soy sauce taste to it while the shio tasted like a very clean, mildly salty broth. Both were a perfect balance of flavor. The eggs were just as delicious, cooked perfectly where the yolk is still a bit raw in the middle, really orange-yellow in the middle. They provide only one slice of chasu if it says it is included but the chasu is really well made. Super tender. If you are a big eater, I would maybe opt for extra chasu. The ramen itself was al-dente, great with the broth. 

Everything was really delicious, simple with clean cut flavors that all individually popped in their own way. I left both full and satisfied."

I guess its to promote faster eating considering we were in and out of there in 30 minutes. If you don&#39;t like crowded spaces, this is not a place for you. The busser and chef were within a few feet from us, a little uncomfortable when the busser is listening to your whole conversation and starring at you.

 There was 3 ramens on the menu plus a special of the night which was a spicy seafood broth ramen. I ordered the pork ramen that they are famous for. We also ordered the fried chicken appetizer. Fried chicken was good, not a fan of whatever sauce they drizzled on there. Then the ramen came ... it looked amazing!! But it did not taste as good as it looked. The broth was luke warm which was strange to me, the taste of the broth wasn&#39;t that great either. Pork was just okay, nothing special. Like I said earlier, the best part of the ramen bowl was the yolky egg. 

Overall: crampt space, no seats, lukewarm ramen broth, flavor wasn&#39;t great, overpriced for what you get."

A friend was being belligerent, so I decided to rob him of the experience of taking him here. HA! I&#39;m also currently working on stealing his best friend.

Anywho, what started out as an act of vengeance turned into something of beauty. Like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon. There&#39;s only two choices for ramen and pressed to decide by the man in front, without a thought I landed on Tan-Tan, never having it before. Hell, I didn&#39;t even read the description; the guy just came out and asked what we were having. But of course, in the splendor of life, not all accidents are bad. I wish I could say the same for my cousin Andy.

To my surprise, there were no seating arrangements; just designated eating spots, like traditional on-the-go ramen shop. I&#39;m a sucker for novelty. My companion didn&#39;t find it so charming but she can stand to lose a few pounds. OH SNAP! Also, for a place so cramped, they still accomplished to have a bathroom. The world needs more places like this.

Minutes from getting to our seats... standing areas, our order was ready. And there was where I had my first bite of my now favorite ramen. *Whispers* Tan Tan Ramen. It blew my mind how I&#39;ve never considered it. Not even so much as glanced at the description. Lesson of the day, kids: Learn to read. I&#39;m a huge fan of sesame oil and this ramen was entirely sesame. The noodles, were as good as another other ramen place BUT THE BROTH! There was a silky texture running down my mouth, and down my throat&#39;s mouth, and my stomach&#39;s mouth... and I guess my rectum&#39;s mouth. It was accompanied with a pool of minced meat and not over saturated by an excess of vegetables.

The only component that would&#39;ve made it perfect was if I slices of chasiu. For all I know, it was an option, but again... the guy in the front."

It must be cause I want to avoid having the lines grow any longer than they already are but they deserve the good reviews. 

Ramen lab is a very small restaurant with enough space for about 8 customers at a time. There are no chairs so everyone stands to eat. This has never been a problem for me but I&#39;ve read some reviews that are upset about this fact however, not having chairs helps the turnover rate of customers. Ramen is meant to be eaten within 10-15 minutes of the bowl being assembled otherwise the temperature and the noodles aren&#39;t at the best state. It&#39;s not really a place to sit and chat.

Also, they are not open everyday of the week and sometimes they can be closed for several weeks at a time. To avoid visiting while they aren&#39;t open just visit their website and follow their Instagram to get updates of which chef will be there and what they will be serving. It&#39;s really very simple.

After all that I just have to say I love this place. I love the concept of having visiting chefs so I get to try ramen from different parts of the world without having to actually travel there. I&#39;ve turned my boyfriend into a huge ramen junkie and we&#39;re always excited to try the ramen of a new visiting chef. Right now Chef Tetsuya is making delicious bowls of miso ramen that&#39;s unlike any miso ramen you&#39;d find in the city. They also make one of the best ajitama that I&#39;ve ever had with ramen. 

I can&#39;t wait to be back."

- Miso ramen = so good, thick wavy noodles yay
- Perfect egg
- No real seating, you stand there and eat (it was so good I didn&#39;t notice I was standing) 
- Small shop, put your name down on the list and wait outside in the cold

It was really tasty. I ordered the Tokyo shoyu ramen with egg (also has cha-su, bamboo shoots, Naruto,scallions etc) The ramen itself was cooked pretty well. Somewhat al dente which I like, but my boyfriend preferred if the noodles were softer and &#34;melt in your mouth&#34;. I disagree with him cuz that would mean the noodles would get soggy. But  this review is not gonna be about our disagreements. The broth itself was yummy. Eating the first half of the bowl was delicious and I really enjoyed it. It literally bought a smile to my face everytime I slurped up my noodles, I&#39;m sure I was starting to look crazy. But after a while, it does start tasting too salty. I had to gulp down ice water during my meal. The cha-su itself was nothing special. The egg was awesome though. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. Even my BF agreed the egg was on point. 

Place is definitely small. When you come, you have to put your name on the list and they call your name out when it&#39;s your turn. It&#39;s all standing which I don&#39;t really mind as I&#39;m 5&#39;5&#34; and the height of the tables were just right for me, but my boyfriend is 6&#39;3&#34; and he was really uncomfortable bending down eating. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t enjoy the place as much as I did. 

I&#39;d come back without him XD"

As November 2015 rolls around, this time we have Ken&#39;s Ramen from Providence, Rhode Island. The small space recreates the coastal town hip, young atmosphere of the original by blasting hip hop and the commotion of buzzing young chefs in the kitchen.

They present their Paitan broth that reminisce of an Asian grandma&#39;s chicken broth, clean but rich in flavor. The thin slices of pork are flash charred to give a bit of a smoky taste, along with fresh corn kernels, bean sprouts, shredded wood ear mushrooms, scallions, and crushed raw garlic give it a complexity to round out the simply familiar broth. For the spicy versions, the chili oil and peppery emulsion adds a nice gradual heat. The noodles are the typical thin straight Sun noodles that has a nice chew to them.

The miso version is the same as the regular offerings just includes a scoop of smooth red miso paste to mix in the broth. The noodles are also thicker ribbon shaped and wavy cooked al dente for the miso. The egg add on was perfectly cooked and marinated with miso so pairs very well with the miso version. 

Another winner from Ramen Lab. Must check this one out again before they go they go back. Happy slurping!"

Every three weeks or so, it change it up and showcase a different ramen chef and their respective style of ramen.

So in essence, the menu and type of ramen is constantly changing, but everything is still ramen. To see exactly who is the current chef and the ramen options, I recommend you check Ramen Lab&#39;s website: www.ramen-lab.com

I came on 10/2/15 and they were serving a shoyu ramen by chef Masuo Onishi. It was not exactly cheap, ($15) but it was delicious. 

It&#39;s a pretty unique experience. There&#39;s only about ten spaces to stand in the restaurant, so it&#39;s super small. The vibe seems like you go in, stand and eat ramen, then pay and leave. It&#39;s normal to wait in line out the door. But if you get a chance to try this place, it&#39;s def worth a try."

Stopped by this past weekend with my husband. It was one of the hottest and muggiest days and ramen lab was the perfect meal to eat. I don&#39;t know if the weather determined it, but they only served cold noddles that day (no broth) by Hiyachu. We got to pick from 3 different types. We got the black vinegar and the lemon wasabi. Both were delicious. It was perfect for the weather. We walked out feeling full but a good refreshed full since the meal had so many crisp veggies. We regretted that we couldnt try the third flavor. We will definitely be back to try more ramen here."

My party of two arrived around 6pm on a Tuesday and waited no longer than 10 minutes. There is no seating, but instead there are just spots to stand around the counter where the chefs cook. The spots are a bit uncomfortable as it small and customers were coming in and out behind me. 

We ordered the paitan ramen and the spicy paitan ramen, which both had a chicken broth base. The noodles were a bit smaller than usual when they arrived. The flavor was less salty than your typical ramen joints, but the flavor was on point. The ramen was good and workers were friendly."

It was hard to catch them since they were closed on Sundays and Mondays and only open for dinner hours. I was also skeptical about waiting an hour for ramen. 

Luckily I came in on a random weekday around 7 in late July and my wait was no more than 13 minutes. 

While this place lacked space and seating they make it up through hospitality. The hostess, chefs and servers were more than friendly towards me from the moment I got on line till I opened the door to leave. 

The concept of Ramen Lab is quite original, I love that they house pop up ramen and they change their chefs and menu every 3 weeks. This gives you a good reason to keep coming back to Ramen Lab because they&#39;ll constantly have new items to offer, it makes the experiences much more unique because not every two can be the same depending on when the reviewers went.

However, you have to keep in mind that any review more than a month old will not qualify in being the same experience you&#39;re expecting to get since there&#39;s a change of chefs/staff.

I just missed Yume Wo Katare but I decided to give Butanchu a chance regardless. (They&#39;re from Tokyo and Seoul!) 

The service here is fast and efficient, the hostess took down my order of Toko Tonkotsu ramen so it was already being made when I stepped inside. 

After I got to my standing spot, I was offered sides of pickles, kimchi, ginger and relish. My Toko Tonkotsu ramen came in 5 minutes, it was piping hot, flavorful and savory. The portions are pretty big. I like that you can customize your ramen to either wavy or thin noodles. The broth was pretty thick and heavy, they definitely did not skimp out on the meat. There were big fatty slices of pork belly along with the cha shu. If you prefer a lighter broth I recommend the Shoyu Tonkotsu ramen. 

First round of kaedama is free with your order so I opted for the thin noodles just to compare the difference. As I had suspected, wavy is the way to go, it&#39;s more bouncy and chewy in texture compared to the thin noodles. 

The serving of kaedama was pretty big and I later regret it when I failed to finish my ramen. This is what happens when your eyes get too hungry even though your tummy is saying no. 

I was a bit embarrassed when I left since the last 3 people before me had finished everything in their bowl and they shouted perfect in Japanese to praise them while I got silence when I went to pay. I tried to get the ramen to go but they don&#39;t have any take out boxes. Although I felt guilty for not finishing, the chefs were understanding about my small apologetic tummy.

All in all I enjoyed my experience at Ramen Lab and I would recommend it to ramen connoisseurs if you&#39;re getting tired of the items at Toto Ramen or Ippudo. I could see this place getting real fun when there&#39;s new offerings each month. You&#39;ll never know what you get next! I don&#39;t know how they do it, inviting chefs from all around the world to serve at Ramen Lab for 3 weeks, so take advantage of this while you can. 

P.S. They accept credit cards now and tip and tax is NOT included with menu price. My bill was $15.24 after tax. (Ramen was $14) I&#39;m not sure if it varies based on each vendor since previous chefs have done things differently."

No frills and great if you want a quick bowl of ramen.

I would come back every time they change the chef to get a ramen fix. The noodles are great! About $15 per bowl and $2 for extra noodles."

I&#39;ve eaten more styles of ramen here than when I lived in Japan for two months. This pop-up business model keeps me coming back religiously every month (or more)! Ramen is an art, not a set recipe, and it&#39;s so exciting to see different chefs&#39; interpretation on such a remarkable food. The chefs range from ones straight out of Japan to others from more &#34;exotic&#34; places like Milan and Connecticut. The offerings have ranged from traditional tonkotsu to spicy tantanmen to fusion style broths. Each month&#39;s menu has been so different from the last, and while I&#39;ve obviously liked some more than others (usually, if the chef is from Japan, the ramen is pretty promising), I nevertheless always have such a fun time here. And if the menu of the month is disappointing, there&#39;s always good ole Xian Famous Foods next door to satisfy your taste buds. 

Eating in Ramen Lab is very reminiscent of being in a cramped little shop in Tokyo itself. The space is small. There&#39;s a bar, NO chairs, with standing space for roughly 10 people. You can&#39;t make reservations. There&#39;s almost always a line, so try to get here by 6 if you don&#39;t want to be stuck waiting for at least half an hour or more. The staff are friendly and clearly very passionate about ramen.

I tried both the chilled beef and the lap cheong gyoza ramen. It&#39;s really about the noodles and the broth and I thought these dishes did both. Noodles were really bouncy and cooked to perfect al dente. I loved watching the kid chef in the back too. I typically don&#39;t finish all my ramen soup but with the chilled beef broth was so cool and refreshing, especially during the summer--I need a tub in my fridge at all times. While the cantonese sausage dumplings didn&#39;t taste particularly different from regular pork dumplings, the other (limited) toppings were great additions. Wish there was more but isn&#39;t that always the case with ramen shops? I&#39;ll definitely be back to try their other collaborations. So glad a place like this opened up in the city. Only complaint would be that seats are incredibly limited. Only a dozen at the bar and that&#39;s it."

Every couple weeks you get a new ramen chef in the shop serving up their own unique take on ramen from wherever they may be from. I was there during Luca Catalfamo of Casa Ramen all the way from Milan, Italy. And surprisingly you could actually taste the Italian influence. These were some of the most unique bowls of ramen I&#39;ve had.

You get to sit at the 10 person standing bar. Yes, you stand, there are no stools, so now you know, no complaining. This is a custom in Tokyo so try to enjoy it, it&#39;s actually kind of awesome. You stand and eat in close proximity to the kitchen and chef (literally 2 feet away) so you get to see everything that&#39;s going on.

I went here for my birthday and it was the coolest experience. If you&#39;re even just a tiny bit interested in the craft that is ramen and cooking in general, this is a must try. I&#39;ve had really hit or miss experiences with bowls of ramen but this was one of those hits man.

Unfortunately that was not the case since my ramen wasn&#39;t all that good. My ramen came out to a whooping $16 (yes, this might&#39;ve hurt my hurt just a little bit). I expected the taste to be spectacular, but it wasn&#39;t! The ramen noodles came out of a package and the seaweed that plated this dish was half-sized. The pork slice (char-su) piece was thin and tasted good, but there was only one meager slice given...what a rip off...and they wanted me to pay extra for another piece or two? No way! The egg was the best part since it was a bit runny and tasted good. The broth was the worst part. I don&#39;t know how people could manage to finish up their broth, but let me tell you how I could&#39;ve had high blood pressure from it! Indeed, it was super salty. I took one sip and never touched my soup spoon ever again. Ramen Lab...this probably will be the first and last time.

I went a while ago when KEN&#39;S RAMEN was in town (around November or so). LOVED IT. My cousin and I went quite early (basically right when they opened). We quickly got seated (or... standed?). There are too many standing locations -- I think 8-10. We were the 5th or 6th person; so it took a bit longer for them to make our ramen. The first few people quickly got their ramen.

My cousin and I both ordered the paitan ramen, but they messed up my order by giving me the hell paitan. That&#39;s fine with me. I kinda regretted not ordering the spicy one after I saw other people eating it. Despite it being SUPER spicy though, it was pretty amazing. Not only this, they were playing some bad ass beats the entire time.

We also ordered the bun, but that could&#39;ve been skipped.

Definitely will have to come back in the future to try more ramen from the different places."

We waited about 20 minutes for a seat, which wasn&#39;t bad for a Friday night. They take your orders while you are in line - and you have a choice of two ramen dishes available - Torigara Shoyu Ramen (chicken broth with pork) - $13, or XO Miso Ramen - $14 (vegetarian). It is about $2 per topping, which is expensive - but I nevertheless ordered an egg to go with the ramen. 

The storefront is tiny with no seating - you stand at a counter that fits about only 8-10 people total at a time. However, you get to watch the chef make and prepare the ramen behind the counter, which is a good experience.  I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and really enjoyed it. The soy-based broth was very light with a clear consistency, and the noodles were thin, which I enjoyed. The taste reminded me that of a Chinese noodle pork soup, or the flavor from xiao long bao. The pork slices were soft and tender. I thoroughly enjoyed the bowl of ramen - although portions were on the smaller side. 

The water is also served in a beaker, which is probably where the name comes from! Despite the cramped space and limited menu, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!"

Poached egg to stir in with your ramen, your completed plate will be glistening!  There is definitely a citrus kick and a lil heat but if youre like me and you like ur heat...ask for more...but be warned...it is habanero diced....after a second heaping of heat...it was delicious!

I had a taste of the Champon...the tonkatsu seafood ramen....and i wish i got that instead!  it was rich, porky but  a bit of the seafood as well! WHYYY did i let my brain decide for me =(!

I went on a rainy Tuesday before 6pm and we only had to wait for a min or so. The menu was simple and the staff was helpful. I liked the set up and be able to see the entire kitchen, specially the pots of broth!!! 
I tried Ken&#39;s ramen and chicken broth was used. I want to talk about the chicken broth first. If you like Asian chicken soup made by your mother or grandmother, you will definitely love this broth. It is light but super flavorful. The consistency is thick because of the amount of chicken bone and chicken feet used to make the broth and not because of any other thickening component such as flour or cream. 
I ordered 2 bowls of ramen (second bowl shared with my husband =P) the first one was miso with chili oil. It was the perfect spicy level for me. I won&#39;t go into the noodles since its sun noodles. All I have to say is that it was cooked perfectly (al dente). In my opinion, don&#39;t bother with the pork belly. It&#39;s good but not any better than other ramen places. The torched pork cheek and the egg were the highlights. The torched pork cheek had that nice smoky flavor and it was crunchy bcuz it&#39;s pork cheek. The egg was a combination of tea egg and poached egg with the running egg yolk! Delicious! 
The second bowl was the simple chicken broth with thin noodles ( better than the thick noodles from the first bowl). It was chicken noodle soup to a different level! Simple but complex at the same time. 
The only thing I would change is the raw onion. It&#39;s s bit strong specially there is already green scallion. I would switch the onion for bamboo if I could. Other than that I have nothing else negative to say about my experience.

I would definitely love to go back and try different chefs and styles."

It&#39;s a small space that fits about 10 people. I ordered the spicy miso tonkatsu ramen with a side of grated garlic, fried onions, and mayu. You choose the flavor, richness, and fattiness of the broth.

The ramen was delicious! The pork belly and chashu was cooked to perfection. Every bite had such a rich flavor. The only change I&#39;d make to my order would be to go with the light soup flavor to go with a less saltier broth.

The chefs from Machida Shoten are there for a couple more days. Go if you have a chance!"

Much along the lines of a pop-up shop, Ramen Lab exists to showcase Sun Noodles.  They bring ramen chefs from all over the world and allow them to use their facilities and noodles to show off their special styles. 

This is amazing.

You may not always love what they&#39;re serving but just come back a few weeks later and the menu and staff will be completely changed! No problem!

The small space also allows for an intimate experience whether you just want to quickly slurp down your yummy noodles and GTFO or if you want to savor and gawk at the culinary ballet going on behind the counter. It&#39;s basically Tokyo style standing room only so post up against the bar and prepare for some amazement.  Only about 6 seats so the odds of a wait are good.  Luckily, ramen is a quick meal that should be slurped up quickly and loudly!

Hours and days vary depending on the chef so be sure to check the website or Twitter before heading over.  Otherwise, いただきます!"

Just happened to be walking by around opening time (5pm) and there was no line. Got the soy ramen, very simple and so damn good. Went back two more times that week, just as good. Even went there AFTER I had dinner at another place for a 2nd dinner. It was STILL that good on a full stomach.

That was my first time at Ramen Lab and when I tasted Casa Ramen, I was in love and thought it beat all the ramen places that I have tried in New York.

NOODLES DOPPIO PEPERONCINO - E loved this one, but I prefer the broth one he had below. 
- Double chili tare
- Spicy chicken
- Spinach, green onion and sprouts
Choose from three levels of spiciness - mild (1), medium (2) or hot (3)

MILANO KING TONKOTSU RAMEN - SOOOOOO GOOD
- 100% pork broth
- Chashu and kakuni
- Spring onion and menma

I went this month and tried Tsukemen NYC and I am sorry, but this really brought my perception of Ramen lab down for me. I love the dipping concept, but the broth was room temperature and it just made eating the ramen so not enjoyable for me. The pork was super salty, but P enjoyed it. I liked the chicken version better, but seriously room temperature and then when they poured the water to make the soup broth, the water was also room temperature.

I was really really disappointed....."

This tiny spot only has space for about 10 ppl but the line is always there. But like I always say, a line outside is always a good sign. I guess if you&#39;re starving and on the brink of death, go elsewhere. But it moves relatively quickly. I never have a problem waiting. I&#39;ve been here a few times and love the concept. I love trying a different version of the same dish. I love love LOVE ramen, so it&#39;s perfect for me. It&#39;s far from me but always worth the trip. 

So now.. On to the experience. When you get in, you can see everyone working behind the counter. The music was good (Biggie was on while I was there). The staff is friendly and they get you set up quickly. Everything is prepped in front of you. Depending on who is showcasing their ramen, you might have customization options, sometimes you don&#39;t. 

I went the other day for Machida Shoten&#39;s second day there. I got the shio tonkotsu with the chili paste, mayu and diced onions on the side. The broth tasted very clean and not overly salty. A very good balance of fattiness and lightness. I had it as it was served at first and then added a bit of mayu and chili paste to the broth and the onions over it all. I love spicy broths but I didn&#39;t want to shake up the dish without tasting it without the extras. You have the option of how strong you want the broth, the texture of the noodles and the fattiness of the broth. I got everything regular, but I will be back to experiment a bit more. I loved it. 11/10. I will be back for Machida Shoten at least 2 more times... as well as for all the future chefs. Of course."

After work on Thursday, I and a couple of friends came to try the new pop-up at Ramen Lab. Prior to this, I had never heard of Ken&#39;s Ramen prior to this, but apparently it originated in Providence, RI and has 4 stars on Yelp. But the words &#34;pop-up&#34; would magically draw out a crowd of curious foodies anywhere in NYC, so there we were, waiting outside for 20 minutes (which is actually not bad) for a spot in the restaurant.

The curious thing about Ramen Lab is that there are actually no tables and seats...everything is standing room only. Ramen Lab has enough standing space for about 12 patrons, and that is how you eat your ramen...standing. To be clear though, I&#39;m not complaining; at least the food comes out quickly enough, and it certainly doesn&#39;t encourage people to linger past their meal, so turnover time is also fast. Prior to getting a table, the host brought out laminated menus that we could write on with a marker to pre-order our food, therefore also speeding up turnover time. So overall service was fast, just the way a New Yorker likes it.

Onto the Ken&#39;s Ramen food (and yes, I will be comparing it to my still favorite ramen spot of all - Totto):

1.  Iced matcha tea - loved the strong green tea flavor.
1.  Pork bun - juicy and well-seasoned, and I loved the spicy mayo.
2.  Hell miso ramen
------ Broth: The chicken broth was very rich, and the miso came in a scoop that I had to mix in myself. What I didn&#39;t realize is that the miso they make comes with a lot of garlic bits. *cue insane garlic breath*
------ Noodles: Ramen itself was wavy and cooked al dente.
------ Toppings: The pork chasiu looked more like chicken in that it was very lean and charred, but it was still delicious. Interesting thing about this is there are raw chopped onions as a topping, which I&#39;m not a huge fan of. *cue insane onion breath* I also ordered an extra pork belly and soft-boiled egg as toppings, and both were great.
------ &#34;Hell&#34;: The spicy oil that makes the ramen &#34;hell&#34; though was a little much in that I didn&#39;t really feel the spiciness but the oil itself settled in my stomach in a not-so-good way. I ended up waking up in the middle of the night burping up spicy garlic oil and clutching my stomach because of acid reflux, something that has never happened to me before.

As a side note, my friends ordered the regular non-spicy paitan ramen and miso ramen; both were fine and enjoyed their meal more than I did.

In conclusion, Ken&#39;s Ramen is worth checking out if you are a ramen fanatic like me, but the ramen didn&#39;t treat me very well in the end, so if you&#39;re afraid of an upset stomach, maybe stay away from &#34;hell&#34;."

It&#39;s a TINYYYYY location tho. Standing dining only. Tiny tiny bathroom. Hard to squeeze in and out of your &#34;standing spot&#34; jacket rack behind you, open kitchen in front.

I came here right when it opened (5-10pm) so just 4 people including me. The menu consists of only two items. I had the Shoyu Ramen($15) - A chicken, pork and vegetable broth with shoyu based, negi, menma, a piece of nori seaweed and 2 pieces of chashu. The soup was pleasant enough without being too salty. The size was a bit small.  
Overall it&#39;s alright - nice if you&#39;re looking for simple ramen, otherwise, Nothing really special and not sure if it&#39;s worth $15.00 a bowl.

Five Stars

Ramen Lab is a small spot on Kenmare and Mulberry. It has no chairs and stands only 10-12 people at a time. There was only a ten minute wait. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen ($13), an Egg ($2), and an oolong tea ($4) in front and then took a stand in the back. The water glasses are 500ml beakers which adds to the Lab-like feel. The ramen was traditional. The broth was based with soy sauce but was not overly salted. The soup oil and fat coated the tongue nicely. The well portioned noodles didn&#39;t feel house made but were cooked a perfect al dente. The toppings included a slice of lipid rich pork, crisp asian vegetables, bamboo shoots, thinly sliced scallions, and nori. The simple ingredients were complete harmony. The soft boiled egg was spot on. The white was firm but the yolk was velvety. 

Overall, I loved this new ramen place both for food and unique dining experience."

Ever since I found out about this place, I&#39;ve been wanting to try them out, but the timing just wasn&#39;t right.

I finally was able to come on a Tuesday night in March with my boyfriend and we were fortunate enough to come by when Machida Shoten was taking up residency at the Ramen Lab, and I gotta say, it was a great first experience at this restaurant! We arrived a little after 8PM on Tuesday, and there were several groups already waiting outside. After putting our name down on the list, we were expecting to wait about 30-40 minutes, but we actually waited closed to a little more than an hour. 

Machida Shoten&#39;s menu is very versatile, in that you can customized your bowl of ramen with noodle texture (firm, regular, soft), soup flavor (strong, regular, light) and fattiness (rich, regular, light) and you add up to 3 condiments for extra flavor. I got the Shoyu Tonkotsu Ramen with all regular options plus a side of seasoned egg with doubanjiang, sesame, and mayu oil. My boyfriend got the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu Ramen with the &#34;regular-strong-rich&#34; plus a side of the egg with sesame, diced onions, and mayu oil. 

When our ramen was placed in front of us, we seriously couldn&#39;t wait to dig in (I was hangry, and he was just super hungry). We first tried the soup without adding in the condiments, and it was already very yummy, but after adding in the 3 condiments, both bowls of ramen became much more flavorful and very very delicious. We devoured the ramen really quickly.. while trying to slowly savor every bite. We were both actually really sad to eat the last bite of the ramen, but all good things must come to an end. The 3 chefs were so cool too, and it was easy to see how they worked so well with each other. They greeted everyone walking in and out in Japanese, and were all smiles, and even attempted to interact with the customers, even though only one chef seemed to be fluent in English. We both agreed that Machida Shoten was worth the wait, but the next time we come to Ramen Lab, we&#39;ll try to come earlier in hopes of shorter wait. 

Also, Ramen Lab is standing room only, so you will be standing for the entire duration of your meal. This is nice in that it can seemingly get patrons in and out quicker. I think that if it was a sit down type of restaurant, our one hour wait could easily have turned into two hours since people are more prone to chit-chatting when sitting down. There are little hooks under the counter for your bags and jackets. It&#39;s nice to be able to eat at the counter and see the bowl of ramen being prepared. I&#39;ve never been to Japan, but would like to think this is what eating ramen would be like over there. 

While walking home, I couldn&#39;t help but gush over how delicious the meal was, and my boyfriend stated that it was possibly the best bowl of ramen he&#39;s ever had (so far). Needless to say, we can&#39;t wait to come back and try out the other guest chefs taking residency in the future!"

The first time I had passed, the menu looked quite a bit different- however, when I came the other day, the menu was for this ramen that I didn&#39;t recognize. Only now do I realize that this is a pop up store, so it seems that on the particular day I went, they were serving noodles from this place called Tsurumen.

Anyway, the noodles were decent, and they prepared them pretty quickly. They don&#39;t make the noodles here, they come prepackaged (I saw them take it out of the package), so that was slightly disappointing. However, it did nothing to dampen the taste of the ramen itself.

I got the soy sauce base soup, which was service with green onions and two pieces of pork. The soup was great, as was the pork. 

Overall, I&#39;d recommend people to go here, but there&#39;s no guaranteeing how long this particular establishment will stick around."

Setting aside the food momentarily, the beauty of this place is their limited selection - 2 ramen options (1 vegetarian, 1 pork) and gyoza. That&#39;s it, plus some beverages. This is great because the chef can focus on ramen and make it perfect, but I bet it also speeds up the preparations so people get their food faster. That means you won&#39;t have a ridiculous wait for great ramen (ahem other places with two hour waits...). I waited all of 15 minutes to take my seat at the 10-person bar. 

Back to the food- the shoyu pork broth is perfection. Light, just salty enough, and with that hit of umami. You get one piece of pork, some spinach, and bamboo. I also opted for the boiled egg, which was the best boiled egg I&#39;ve had. They serve it separately so you can try the broth in its purest form before you add the egg and let that flavor start to enhance the broth. 

The funnest part of the meal is watching chef conduct his wrist flick on the noodles. 

A great addition to the atmosphere is that the price includes tax and gratuity, so what you see is exactly what you pay. CASH ONLY!

My only regret is not getting the vegetarian ramen as the guy sitting next to me said it was better. And the vegetarian broth is &#34;cooked to order&#34; to an extent. I know exactly what I&#39;m getting next time!"

First of all, I don&#39;t know the who or the why, or if it&#39;s a temporary space or what, but it&#39;s a tinny little walk-up with a very efficient friendly system for ordering before you arrive. When you do it&#39;s the size of two closets, no seats, and on my night you had two choices, ramen, or ramen with a few extra pork pieces. 

Inside they&#39;re stirring, fussing, and chopsticking. More than half of the clientele including small children and all of the staff are speaking Japanese, which proves... not sure what.

Moments after you take your stand, they pile a huge portion of reduced broth, simmering broth, and odd al dente broad noodles that seem to have something to do with ramen, plus a heaping of bean sprouts and garlic. This is 3X a normal ramen dish. The pork is interesting, half the pieces are chewy and dry (but flavorful), the other half are melt in your mouth (but full of fat). If you peer into the pot, there are large parts of a pig simmering in there.

The broth, well, it&#39;s a fat bomb. It is a delicious, almost overpowering tontatsu broth. You are the goose, and your liver is ready for foie gras.

And what&#39;s driving the whole thing is this little ritual. When you come you get various wishes in Japanese. When you leave a staff member takes a deep look in your bowl and if you have finished most of the solid objects they yell out &#34;Good Job&#34;, and then everybody behind the counters joins in, &#34;Good Job!!!&#34; Just imagine what happens if you do not finish your dinner, you do not want to be there."

Still in the first week, the menu consists of 3 items: shoyu ramen, miso ramen, and gyoza. Sadly, there was no gyoza today. Opening glitch I suppose. Anyways. 

They start taking names by 4:30 for a 5:00 opening. By 4:45 the first seating was filled and they were on to the next. By 5:45, the wait time was 2 hours with people still putting names on the list. 

The food... Really this is going to come down to personal preference. The shoyu is made with a chicken stock and soy sauce with some chashu pork, and we added some extra pork, naturally. The broth is light and not overly assertive, and the noodles were likewise light. It&#39;s a bowl you can consume to the bottom. The chashu is excellent. Fatty and super tender. The extra pork, however, was a bid dry; surprising and disappointing. 

The miso ramen... This is the one. The broth is so rich and creamy and full of umami flavor. The noodles here are a little thicker and get a great coat of flavor from the broth. It&#39;s heavy to be sure, but so flavorful. This is the one to get if you prefer heavy ramens.

Each showcased ramen chef typically stay in the restaurant for a month so you have to be fast if you are determined to try as many varieties of ramen from each place. The spot is small and can feed about 8-9 people at a time. They take your order prior to &#34;standing down&#34; so when you get &#34;seated&#34; they have already started to prepare your bowl of ramen. The turnaround time is pretty fast because they are efficient. Follow their Instagram to get the latest chef introduction and date/time. The noodles will always be Sun Noodles which is the best as noodles can be. Sun Noodles have yet to disappoint me. The chewiness of the noodles is just there for every bowl of ramen I&#39;ve tried here thus far (I guess I will have to also give credit to the chefs).

Here at Ramen lab, they are trying to bring back the classics, the non bastardized versions that have been popping up lately. The flavors are clean and well layered as most ramen broths are. The ramen itself fits well with the lighter broth as the noodles are more light, springy and wavy rather than the thicker version for tonkotsu.

There&#39;s nothing I hate more than falling for hype (via Yelp or otherwise) and paying for mediocre to terrible food. 

There&#39;s a bit of a parallel between food in New York and contemporary abstract art these days where &#34;expressions&#34; and &#34;interpretation&#34; outweigh actual taste and the audience is sometimes afraid to express confusion lest they are accused of &#34;not getting it.&#34; So the ignorant pretend to appreciate the absurd conceptions and inflate the egos of the poseurs. 

To put it in more tangible terms: Casa Ramen&#39;s noodles doppio peperoncino tantalized with ingredients like spicy chicken, double chili tare and fresh saffron. It turns out that the dish consisted of shredded chicken that could&#39;ve come from a can, fresh and raw leaves (5 to be exact) of spinach, and saffron (used as a GARNISH but otherwise contributing NOTHING to the dish) laid on top of a bowl of Sun noodles drenched in a fiery sauce appealing only to people who add sriracha to every dish like it performs like a miracle sauce. Utter waste of quality noodles. It&#39;s like the dish was conceived of in a vacuum and the test group only provided feedback on the menu description and never got a taste of the product (or the focused group consisted of the aforementioned. 

The dish was offered in varying degrees of heat and it seems to me people like to take on such options like a challenge. Tolerance of heat in food seem to be a badge of honor for foodie yuppies who grew up without seasoning. Just a quick rant on spicy foods: there are other flavors that can show a developed palate. In this particular instance, the bold move indeed would have been to choose mild. I took the medium and even then I couldn&#39;t taste anything but the hot pepper sauce. And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the chef&#39;s focus on heat took away his attention on all other aspects of seasoning, including the ajitsuke tamago which was about as bland as a plain boiled egg from a salad bar."

I went with the Musashi Tsukemen. Believe me you won&#39;t need more, because this is a filling dish.
Noodles - Quite large with a slightly squared shape. Not as thick as the ropes that come with tsukemen at Kambi House, but thicker than any other tsukumen I&#39;ve had in NYC. Good texture and taste.
Broth - tonkostu. Strong pork base with a slightly sweet taste from the tare. I went with mild so I could taste the broth and not any added spice. Very good! Swimming in the broth were green onions, menma, pieces of chopped pork and globs of fat form the pork - it was like a pork stew!
Toppings -  The pork was incredible! The Mushashi came with two pieces and you don&#39;t need more. Each piece was sliced to nearly an inch thick. The top layer was crispy and caramelized. Sweet soy and a touch of pepper. Underneath was a layer unctuous fat. Next was a layer tender pork. Each piece was like a delicious roast carved for your bowl. Fantastic!
The whole egg was soaked in soy and when you opened it there was a wonderfully runny interior. Perfect.
When you are done with your noodles, ask for soup wari (not every tsukemen peddler in NYC offers this). You get added soup to cut the broth down to a drinkable level. Please be warned - even after being cut with soup wari, there is a thick fatty skim to the broth. Delicious, but a vivid reminder that you are clogging your arteries.
Since Menya Musashi is a pop-up and not here selling their wares on a regular basis, it would be unfair to give them the 5 star review, but still this was an incredible bowl.
I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get to Ramen Lab earlier to try it multiple times or post this review in time for any readers. Menya Musashi&#39;s last day at Ramen Lab is tomorrow (10/22). If you can make it (and it&#39;s not as hard to find as you think) you will be rewarded with a bowl of tsukemen that you can use to compare to the best of the offerings in NYC."

I believe I ordered the Goma TanTan Men. The food was pretty good though because it was sesame base, I felt like it lacked one particular ingredient, because the soup base was a bit dull. Furthermore, the chef looked a bit stressed out, since he was a little behind schedule, and plus since it&#39;s not his usual kitchen, he was a bit all over the place. And us watching him cook, didn&#39;t help ease his tensions. LOL... Anywho..the whole concept of having different chef showcasing their ramen is cool, though I am not sure if I would particularly come back every time they have a new vendor. If I am in the neighborhood, I might check it out.

Note: Not the best place to hang out with groups, as everyone is eating standing up."

Waited outside for 30min in freezing cold weather, no hot beverage whatsoever, stood by the bathroom spot (imagine people open and close the door right next to you while you are eating.)

The ramen shop&#39;s modest exterior is matched perfectly by it&#39;s utilitarian interior. at 5PM sharp you are shuffled into a simple ramen bar that has standing room only (for 10), with just a slab of wood separating you from the lone ramen chef and his trusty side kick.

You have only two choices: the shoyu ramen (for which the chef is known) and the miso ramen (which has been said to be the better of the two).  

I had the shoyu ramen. The broth is a basic chicken stock with excellent flavor without being to overpowering or salty. The egg was perfectly soft boiled and the sun noodles were cooked to al dente perfection. To complete the masterpiece was a single slice of naruto and a single slice of fatty pork, which I thought they could have been a bit more generous with.       

$13 tax and tip included + $2 for a soft boiled egg makes it $15 bucks CASH ONLY if  you are enjoying a solo meal.  

Get there by 4:30PM the latest to get to enjoy the first seating.  Even when I got there at 4:15PM there was a line snaking around the front entrance.  Solid spot, look forward to ramen collaborations in the future!"

Finally decided to come here on a weekday shortly after the doors opened. So happy to see it wasnt much of a wait then! We waited maybe about 15min after we signed on our names on the clipboard.

From the get go, they only have limited standing space here. This is the only reason why i gave it 4/5. During the winter times its a bit of a hassle with the winter jackets. They do have hooks underneath the table so that helps.

The staff were very nice and attentive. Making sure that everything good. There are 3 main ramen you can choose from. You can choose the type of noodles, the flavor, and how fatty you want it. You also get a choice of 3 sides to add more flavor. I would def recommend getting the mayu as a side. I got the Shoyu ramen which was super yummy. I was amazed with all the rich and tasteful flavors everything in the bowl. Def worth getting and kept slurpping on the soup afterwards!

Ramen lab is a great concept with a monthly rotation featuring different ramen restaurants from around the world. When I went on a Wednesday evening around 6:30, the wait was a little long. You first sign your nsme onto a sheet and they go down the list. When it is your turn they take your order and you wait a little more until there is space in the little restaurant.

We stopped by at 9:30 and only had one couple in  line before us-which as anyone who enjoys ramen knows- that was a score especially since ramen lab closes at 10pm weeknights. 

As you&#39;re name is called you place your order, even before being shown in. I didn&#39;t say seated as its standing room only and it looked like 10 people were the limit at this small restaurant. 

There was a guest chef featuring some specialty bowls of ramen the night we were there, unfortunately we didn&#39;t see his name so I couldn&#39;t tell you.

We were wondering why the menu looked so different from the yelp reviews so I&#39;m not sure if this is helpful regarding the regular menu. 

It was okayyy.. Its by sun noodle, the company that supplies some of the best ramen joints with their amazing springy (and my preferred) type of noodles. 

Me and a few friends went to this little hole in the wall on a Friday night. Wait time was about 30-40 minutes.. not too bad. It&#39;s stand up dining which was a new experience, water came in little beakers (haha.. cus it&#39;s ramen.. lab). I ordered the miso vegetable ramen (miso tomato broth) and everyone else ordered the champon ramen (tonkatsu seafood broth with shrimp). I wasn&#39;t a big fan of either. My order was overflowing with vegetables - a good thing - but I&#39;m not a fan of the tomato broth. The seafood one was a little better but again, I don&#39;t think any of us were a fan of seafood broth either. 

What really bothered me though was a lot of the ingredients didn&#39;t look too fresh. Soup was taken out from chinese take out containers and reheated. Usually you see big cauldrons of soup constantly being stirred and heated on the spot and the chasu was taken out of a plastic bag along with other ingredients. 

Overall, meh. We&#39;ll probably come again to try out the regular menu."

Normally I feel like all ramen places are pretty much the same but Ramen Lab really stood out. The broth is thicker than the usual ramen broth, and so so flavorful. The noodles were al dente and the chashu was melt in your mouth delicious. I actually couldn&#39;t finish my bowl of ramen, because it was so filling. I obviously regret that now, so next time I&#39;m gonna make sure I&#39;m ready to eat when I come here.

The wait to get inside is no joke though. We waited 50 minutes on a Friday night at 7:00pm to get inside but it was so worth it. It&#39;s standing room only inside, with hooks on the side of the wall for your belongings. Our ramen was served quickly and we could see the chefs preparing other people&#39;s ramen as we ate ours.

As for the ramen, I only had one place in nyc that was at the top of my list. Now I have two. The broth was delicious, noodles were perfect. I got the added bonus of my girlfriend ordering the miso (I had the shoyu) and I usually always get to finish her bowl. Both were awesome.

I made reservations although you definitely don&#39;t even need them. Plenty of people walked into this sweet little family BYOB Italian place. It definitely has a mom and pop vibe and the staff was SO nice and welcoming. They were all just so so so nice and the service was great. 

We ordered the burratta for an appetizer and it was divine. It came on crostini with pesto and roasted peppers and I would have just eaten that for dinner. 

We both ordered the shrimp and lobster squid ink fettuccini and it was the best pasta I&#39;ve had in a VERY long time. There were huge chunks of lobster meat and about 5 large prawns. The pasta was homemade and delicious and the sauce! Oh god that sauce. It was creamy and thick. Just perfect. We ate so much we couldn&#39;t even eat dessert but I would have tried the tiramisu- they make it daily and it looked amazing. 

I love that this place is BYOB. There were families and friends and couples dining here and it just had a very awesome home-y vibe. People were enjoying their dinners and wine (that they brought- awesome perk) and having a nice leisurely dinner.

When you eat here you need time and patience. This is a slow paced place with a very high noise level. Onto the good stuff.
We were 3 people and shared fried calamari which was light and so not greasy. Crostini burrata melted in your mouth, mussels was a nice portion for even 3. A light incredible sauce that I felt like I just wanted to drink. The best for bread dipping! 

Main courses - mine was pasta e piselli  cut spaghetti with pancetta, green peas and eggs. Delicious and bursting with taste. Took home half because I was busting from appetizers. Friends got pappardelle agnello which she liked but was a little too heavy if a sauce for me and was stew like. The chicken Marsala was also very good. 

Side was meatballs we all didn&#39;t like. Very bizarre taste. Have no idea what&#39;s used in them.

Feel like it&#39;s coming from someone&#39;s Italian Grandma&#39;s Kitchen. It&#39;s a small place and it gets crowded. Make sure you have a reservation and expect to spend a lot of time there. Don&#39;t go if you&#39;re trying to catch a movie or have other plans afterwards. The food is enjoyable so it&#39;s worth it. I&#39;m a basic Italian food eater so I had to chicken marsala and spaghetti with an appetizer of mussels. Everything was delicious.

The staff is very nice and friendly. They love what they do, very passionate. They truly want you to be well aware of what they have to offer, they also give you a heads up that the food may take a while. They suggest you order an app or salad and a main. I had the spicy mussels, and herb crusted lamb chops with a side of kale. I seen many Yelpers say that this is a family restaurant.  I beg to differ,the cool artsy feel and travel posters and the lowly dimmed lighting oozes as a perfect restaurant for first dates. The food was overly salty. I did love my lamb chops were tasty but they were tough and like most people I love a little more tenderness. The waitress was nice but overwhelmed. The time the food took was way too long (even if its made from scratch) and as a native Brooklinite I got things to do, places to go, and people to see. I hope that they ask their guest if they have any food allergies or special diets. The salt content was too much and is not good for my heart. But I will come here on a date and will byob.

Nary a closed shell or funky one in the bunch.
Homemade squid ink fettuccine in pink sauce with lobster and crab...divine. 
Beautiful burrata and heirloom tomato salad. 
Lovely service but due to such a small space, it&#39;s evident that they don&#39;t want you to linger very long after dessert. The BYOB more than makes up for that!"

we kicked things off with lightly fried calamari with cherry peppers on top as well as crostini with burrata. amazing, all of it!

we all ended up ordering a pasta dish, but they were all specialty pasta dishes that my family isn&#39;t going to cook at home (or at least, that was our justification). I had pappardelle with braised lamb and vegetables - fantastic! my mom had the squid ink fettucini topped with shrimp and lobster, and my dad had the pesto gnocchi, and they really enjoyed their dishes. good portion size, and the quality was top-notch.

of course we saved room for dessert - as I reviewed the menu, I remember the words of a very wise philosopher: &#34;leave the gun, take the cannoli.&#34; so I ordered the cannoli and a cappuccino; both were excellent! 

it&#39;s a small place - actually, 2 rooms with a divider in the middle, somewhat like the letter U - and very cozy. I wish they had put the air conditioning on - it got pretty warm in there - but that was really the only downside of our experience.

service was excellent and they even chilled our wine since my parents had forgotten to chill it at home before we brought it. if you don&#39;t have a bottle with you, there&#39;s a liquor store a block or two away.

Nostro is a welcome addition to this neighborhood and I&#39;m looking forward to returning."

Would have given this Neapolitan treasure five stars... But for the quirks in service. While the owners are super warm and friendly, there were some blips in the service. It took 45 minutes for us to get our appetizers, and our server wasn&#39;t sure if we had already eaten them....no we didn&#39;t. 
But the food, overwhelming made up for this.  Delicious and light eggplant parmigiana. The smoked mozzarella app, was heavenly and the burrata just creamy and delish! The  pasta was just like grandma made....even the espresso didn&#39;t disappoint.

The place was extremely cute and was decorated very nicely. They had nice pictures on the walls and the lights were different which we enjoyed. We had no idea it was BYOB but it wold have helped us to deal with the service because it was horrible.

We ordered our food and the appetizers came in a timely manner. After we finish our appetizers we wait over an hour to actually get our main courses. Finally when our main course comes they bring my stepmom the wrong meal and my dad has yet to get his meal. Finally the lady comes back and she explains to her this isn&#39;t what she ordered. The woman had the nerve to tell her that she was wrong and she heard what she heard but she would be willing to take the blame. For some reason she had a problem with remaking my stepmom&#39;s dish. She said it would take too long to make chicken parmigiana which I don&#39;t understand since it&#39;s a simple dish and really doesn&#39;t take so long. Then after a couple more minutes my dad still haven&#39;t received his order. The woman came back to tell us she had no main course order for him. She did tell him she would have the kitchen make him a new dish.

Finally it&#39;s time to eat after the whole mess. The food wasn&#39;t even that great. I was disappointed with my chicken parmigiana and some of the sides we ordered just didn&#39;t taste that good. There was nothing special about it. 

This place ended up being such a waste of time and the woman who was our server was extremely rude. No matter what happens you&#39;re suppose to treat the customer with respect and she did not do that when she was called out for messing up two of our tables orders. Will not be going back here and really do not recommend. There are so many other restaurants that have better food and better service."

The staff was friendly and courteous they explained the menu to us and brought us cups for the wine. Based on the yelp reviews i went with the squid ink pasta and was not dissapointed. it wad delicious, the flavors blended together really well. My friend ordered something that reminded me of lasagna(noodle with ricotta cheese in the middle), i personally liked mine better but his wasn&#39;t bad as well. Their crustini was superb, simple fresh and delicious.. i am a huge fan of pesto and was glad they used a pesto sauce at the bottom to bring out a kick of flavor without being overwhelming. I also got the carpaccio which was beautifully presented with arugula and Parmesan on top (goes excellent with wine) it had a hint of truffle oil which i appreciated to give it a bit of flavor without overpowering the taste of the meat itself (i personally dont like truffle oil but i didn&#39;t mind it this time) last but not least we got the tiramisu and it reminded me of the best tiramisu i&#39;ve ever had which was made by my friend whose a culinary chef. The only thing i thought was mediocrew was the free garlic knots that was served, it was a bit cold and soggy but since it was free i didn&#39;t factor it into this review.

The warm ambiance, lovely service, and of course the FOOD.  It is also BYOB which is great, and so we had a bottle ready for poppin upon arrival. Finally, the prices are amazing - what food should actually cost in a restaurant. It&#39;s always great when food is reasonably priced and you are not sacrificing it for it quality in any way. I told my wife during the meal that it felt I was eating at my mother&#39;s or grandmother&#39;s - that&#39;s always a good thing; eating well past the point I was full truly resembled a home cooked experience. Nothing pretentious about the place or the food. There were too many things on the menu that sounded great (kale pesto gnocchi for one) which I did not have a chance to try, so will obviously have to return.
 
So the food. Mamma mia! For appetizers we had the kale Caesar salad and also the crostini spread with pesto and topped with burrata and roasted peppers (crostini burrata). Yes it all tasted as good as it sounds. You can never go wrong with burrata, and the flavors went great together. A must have. As for the kale caesar salad, that was also great. I do not normally order caesar salads but had a feeling they would do it right here, and they did. 
 
For entrees we were just in the mood for pasta and it seemed like we couldn&#39;t miss on anything we chose. When when we asked the owner for her recommendation, she had a hard time narrowing it down as she explained that they developed the menu based on their favorite home recipes - I loved hearing that. So we went with the Pasta e Piselli and the owner beamed when we ordered that (their website describes this dish as one of their most loved dishes). We also ordered the lasagna. The lasagna was great, pasta was clearly fresh and light, using béchamel which adds something special. The Pasta e Piselli was equally great, with this dish just reminded me of something my mother or grandmother would make on a week night - have never seen this pasta dish on an Italian menu before but it is supposedly a dish of Naples (where I believe the owners are from).
 
I would have a hard time returning and not wanting to have what we ate again. But I have heard their lamb chops are delicious and for 16 doll hairs!!! I recently had lamb chops at two Italian restaurants in Manhattan and they each were close to $40 bucks - they were delicious but the price gap is just plain nutty. I hope that when people catch on to this gem, they don&#39;t up their prices too much.
 
My wife and I shared two desserts which is rare as we don&#39;t usually get dessert too much. So this was more of a testament to the atmosphere and overall experience. We had the tiramisu and affogato. Both were delicious. Havent had an affogato since Italy so this was a treat. Look forward to more dinners here and I wish the owners success. Arrivederci Nostro Ristorante!"

This place is what you want in an Italian spot; mom in the front, pop in the back, everything homemade, etc etc etc. I&#39;ve recommended this spot to everyone who would listen and the feedback has been universally great. Heck, I suggested this to so many people that groups of my friends actually ran into each other there! Grab a nice bottle or 2, and head on down. Don&#39;t be afraid to leave a glass for the kitchen if you&#39;re as impressed as I was.
By the way the first thing the host/server/owner told us when she approached our table was that they were out of a few things. This is because they make all the pasta daily, so when something is out, it&#39;s out! No complaints here; Burrata Caprese, Bresaola Carpaccio, Seafood Risotto, Seafood Fettuccine, and a dish featuring hand cut spaghetti whose name I forget were ALL delicious and warranted us reaching all over the place eating off of each others plates. Top notch addition to the neighborhood."

This is, right out of the gate, among the very best Italian food in the neighborhood.  And by neighborhood, I mean Brooklyn.

It&#39;s run by a husband-and-wife team who clearly care deeply about running a restaurant the right way, and doing justice to the food that is their heritage and their passion.  

To think there are so many overpriced and underconsidered restaurants around Park Slope--  It&#39;s truly a wonder to walk into a brand-new establishment, sit down, and immediately be served simply the best lamb ragu pappardelle you&#39;ve ever had, outside of a hole-in-the-wall in Sienna.  And not one single dish exceeds eighteen(!) dollars.  

I understand that Milan&#39;s (which Nostro replaced) was a beloved neighborhood fixture, but this restaurant isn&#39;t some cold corporate cash-in... It&#39;s authentic Italian made with love, skill, and care that is truly rare.  This is the restaurant you have been dreaming would open in your neighborhood.  Well here it is, in mine.  And I&#39;m not giving it back.

I ate there 4 hours ago, and I&#39;m already jazzed to go back.  If a restaurant this fine doesn&#39;t succeed, then it will be because we simply don&#39;t deserve them.  Nostro shames all the local joints whose prices have soared as their quality plunged (hello, Sidecar!) and is stiff competition for all the neighborhood gems I adore (you got some serious company, Lot 2!)"

The owner -- who is also the host and, for now, the sole waiter -- attended to us intuitively throughout our meal. She wanted us to enjoy ourselves from beginning to end and graciously made sure we did. The Neapolitan food is more specific and refined than any restaurant in this neighborhood. I really enjoyed their bresaola, eggplant parm, seafood risotto, meatballs and pappardelle with lamb ragu. Take advantage of the BYO while you can. They don&#39;t even charge for corkage.

We all loved our meals and the lovely, homey setting. I had sea bass cooked perfectly, moist and tender, with a more complex than usual lemon butter sauce with capers and herbs, and garnished with fresh parsley.  The kale Caesar salad was fresh and tender, with high quality shaved parmesan and dressing. A side of fresh local sauteed veggies was cooked just right, each of the large variety of vegetables retaining its individual taste and appearance, and seasoned lightly with herbs and extra virgin olive oil. My husband enjoyed his meat lasagne with fresh pasta.  Ricotta cheese cake for dessert seemed home made.  Our waitress, the co-owner, was happy to explain any of the dishes and even food preparation that we asked about - and I was touched by her stories of how her family meals were organized, and that she did not bring our dessert menus until we had each finished our dinner because that was how she was raised at home.

We happened to walk by on our way to Emmy Squared on a Sunday evening and this place is right across the street. We saw on their board that they offer oysters so we decided to stop in just for those.

St. Mazie has so much more to offer. First of all, ooooh boy is this a place for couples. Going solo may leave a weaker person feeling quite dejected. It&#39;s easy to canoodle in one of their booths, feeding off all that romantic energy flying around. We were gross, everyone there was gross, and no one felt any shame. Except for the one couple who walked in apparently giving each other the silent treatment, who abruptly walked out after surveying the scene. Be nice or leave!  

Sunday they usually have a New Orleans jazz and swing band come in and play live, and this night had many people dressed up and dancing swing in the front and back of the house, pretty much anywhere there was enough room to move. 

The space itself really makes the experience. There&#39;s something almost steampunky to the decor, apparently the owner gets a lot of odds and ends from different sources. Lots of ambient lighting, retro fans operating on a shared rotating belt that spans the length of the bar ceiling, a dark red candy striped hallway leading to no where, a ultra cozy wood and stone basement with old framed photos, a beautiful courtyard out back with fairy lights and ample plants. You feel warmth the moment you walk in, and I loved discovering detail after detail.

They offer cocktails (mezcal!) and small plates, as well as a few more substantial items like a burger. I will definitely be back."

I came here with my girl friend of a few and had a great night planned and I knew The Maze was a solid place to start. The ambience is jazz club meets Italian decadence meets hipster cocktail bar. You&#39;d think all this would come at a huge price tag, but I personally believe the prices are modest when you regard the large amount of food you receive, and at a very high quality, as well.
I can&#39;t recommend any of he dishes enough! But tonight I had the risotto and my girl had the pasta with chicken. Both dishes were amazing, as expected, but what wasn&#39;t expected was the incredible service we received from EJ, our sweet and attentive waiter. She gave us such a warm greeting, and gave us a great spot out side, which I&#39;ve never had the pleasure of doing, that I knew the night would be extra special because of her.
She gave amazing recommendations both on drinks and food. And she recommend the cookies and ice cream, which has changed my life.
If you go to Mazie, you can expect an incredible time, but I hope you have EJ as a server. My girlfriend even said I was talking about her too much! Haha!
What a great time. And what a great person!"

We decided to give it another try this weekend.

Just lovely. The atmosphere downstairs is welcoming and peaceful, making it a fantastic date spot, as others have pointed out. Food was on the simpler side but perfectly executed and obviously from well-sourced ingredients.

I am not old enough (or wealthy enough) to remember the lodge aesthetic that Mazie seems inspired by. It reminds me a bit of &#34;The Shining&#34;, if it had been a summer destination and without the unfortunate haunting. Many restaurants in the area try to capture this in terms of design, but pair it with nothing more than fancy bar food. Mazie captures the cuisine as well -- lighter and more delicate, to be sure, but with admirable attention to detail and the same sense of modest luxury. It&#39;s a wonderful, indulging experience.

My one tip is not to overlook the pickled vegetables, especially if you pair it with a whisky or rye. I don&#39;t know how they did it, but the spiciness is perfect."

We sat &amp; got a table while we chill &amp; enjoy our drinks. Drinks here is good! I ordered non alcoholic drink, the pomegranate iced tea &amp; it was amazing! It taste very different from any regular iced tea. I got some raw oysters too. I missed the happy hour so it cost $3 per oyster.

The first night I was here, a French singer with a beautiful voice performed, and I, drunk, pontificated about how sexy the language was, which was then misconstrued by my partner as me wanting to sleep with the singer. While that wasn&#39;t far wrong, that certainly wasn&#39;t what I was trying to convey.

Came here on a busy weekend night when they had a live jazz band playing. Love the vibe and ambience of this place. It&#39;s small/cozy, intimate. Dimmed lighting and lots of candles. It&#39;s a bit loud and hard to carry on a conversation, but didn&#39;t mind too much because the band was hopping and was really lost in the music. There&#39;s a few tables and seats out front close to the entrance, the bar is in the middle, and then some more tables closer to the stage in the back of the restaurant. There&#39;s a super small space in front of the stage which some people try to dance in, but it&#39;s really crowded and cramped so don&#39;t be expecting to bust out your fancy lindy hop routine or tossing your partner around in aerials haha.

The bartenders were nice and cocktails were around $10 which is super reasonable by NY standards. Only improvement I could see is maybe having one more bartender on busy nights. The night I was there, there were only two so there was a bit of a wait getting drinks...but really not that big of a deal.

Definitely recommend this place to enjoy a cocktail, listen to some jazz...in a fun, casual, yet romantic environment. Will be back!"

The oysters were on happy hour and they were shocked perfectly with the liquor still in them. The octopus melted in your mouth. Our daughter ordered the cavalieri pasta with linguini noodles and it was so good. All the pasta is noticeably homemade. She is lactose intolerant, so they informed of which dishes we could order. The polenta on the polenta board was delicious, but I didn&#39;t care for the meatballs. They seemed a little too dry. I also didn&#39;t like the tiramisu, but you can&#39;t win them all. Loved the ambience. Server was fantastic. Will definitely be back. One thing on a side note. Ordered the jalapeño margarita. I have yet to find an actual spice jalapeño margarita.

We came here right before it started pouring on Saturday night and could have not have been more pleased with the service at the bar, the amazing music (upbeat Jazz?), the romantic lighting, and the just-right-amount of chatter from the patrons. Their seemingly newer venture, St. Charles is located downstairs and is used as a &#34;supper club&#34; of sorts. 

Their Happy Hour is from 5-8pm, even on a Saturday, hurray! We also had the Mazie Burger (very tasty toppings and well flavored patty, but it was on, oddly enough, a stale bun), pasta of the day (the mixture of tomato sauce, olive oil, and pecorino was so fresh and pungent), and a very skippable charcuterie board (although the pickled root veggies were quite good).

The moment you walk in you will hear a classy nice live jazz band playing which is seldom to find in NYC these days. Left door and go down, you will find a sexy little wine cav where you can enjoy a little intimate time with a date or a friend who you would want to chit-chat away over great choices of red, rosè to white. 

Go up and chill with the band, sit at the bar and enjoy a glass of drink and meet people. Give a little smile away and you&#39;re good. 

And if you&#39;re a smoker, oh boy! Need no weird bystanding outside, explore the little garden at the back. 

Food is excellent! Service is great, really nice people. You just have to wait a little, and can&#39;t blame, the place is conveniently packed. 

A must to see! And by the way, come early. Live jazz band usually plays just up to 10pm or maybe it was just last night. Have fun!"

We get there around 10 pm and it was already pretty crowded, but we were able to procure two nice seats pretty close to the small stage. We were already to full from our dinner to get food, so we just filled our tummies with the delicious house wine. The prices are average for Williamsburg, roughly $10 per cocktail and our bottle of house wine was around $27. The musicians and dancers were extremely authentic and talented, which really gave a great feel to the bar. For a second I felt as if I had been teleported to a small Spanish watering hole. After the music was over, we had a few words with the guitarist and the dancer and then we were on our way. Overall, the venue was pretty average for a bar.

The bad part is that service takes forever, the pours are small, and the prices are expensive. Also you can&#39;t see your food because it&#39;s so dark and the tables are too small to actually enjoy the meal. It&#39;s a constant juggling act of moving around plates so they don&#39;t fall off. 

Waitresses wander by, but they don&#39;t actively try to help you unless you flag them down.

(A free brunch for 2 to be exact - thanks howaboutwe!)

My fiancé and I arrived around 12:45 for our scheduled date and this was place was completely empty. At first, We hesitated in going in since from the outside, the dining room was pretty much pitch black aka not open. But coming all the way from Manhattan in the middle of polar vortex, we were determined to get our free grub on. 

We decided to sit in the back of the restaurant with the leathery booth seats overlooking the entire restaurant. The ambiance was very cozy and laid back. My fiancé and I felt as if we were teleported back in time with the jazzy music and old school decor. It felt just so perfect as the place to be on a slow lazy snowy Saturday afternoon. 

Onto the food! We ended up ordering the St. Mazie BLT and smoked mackerel hash with a pomegranate iced tea and their Hemingway daiquiri.  The iced tea wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly sweet, just the I like it! Even though I&#39;m not a big fan of cocktails, with the deal I knew I had to try one. The daiquiri I found was quite refreshing especially with the touch of grapefruit and lime. It was definitely worth trying. 

The food took a bit to come out - perhaps we were their first customers of the day. The couples who came in a good 20 mins after we arrived received their entrees at the same time as us. However the food certainly did not disappoint! My amazing deconstructive BLT came with two generous slices of French toasts, 4 strips of crispy bacon (on a bed of kale salad), and topped with 2 perfectly poached egg and sweet tomato purée. All the components combined and alone was simply delicious. It was just so much yummy food that I couldn&#39;t resist on not finishing. 

My fiancé was worried that smoked mackerel would be too fishy for his taste but found the dill sour cream, potato hash + the two slices of toasted sour dough with brushed on olive oil to be the perfect combination. 

This place definitively served one of the better brunches we&#39;ve had. Our server Shawn/Sean? Was a complete sweetheart. He was on point from the beginning to the end. He took his time in explaining the deal - 2 cocktails + 2 entrees (allowed us to swap out the cocktail for tea/coffee/soft drinks). We were checked on multiple times and he was apologetic when the food took a bit of a wait. Even without the deal - people should stop by to try their brunch menu - each entree only cost about $12 - with the portion, creativity, and taste - definitely a steal! 

Just to imagine we weren&#39;t going to come because of the polar vortex, my belly would had missed out."

The place is soo cool, cozy and warm :)
The ambience, decor, staff, drinks everything was beautiful 
And the best is they have live music very often if not every night!!!!!! 
You feel you are in Paris in the 20s AMAZING! 
They have a happy your oyster

The bar is tucked away down Grand Street--almost like a secret. The front was open on a warm Thursday night and the bar was full. There are tables in the back and a stage--that night a jazzy French band was playing and added to the Art Deco/retro vibes swirling around. The drink menu looked fantastic but I stuck with the house red, which was decent. We tried to sneak a peak at the backyard but it was closed that evening. After the band finished the crowd thinned out, giving us the chance to snag some stools and chat. Would love to come back and get adventurous with with cocktail menu and try their food."

The decor is impeccable - you feel like you&#39;re in a dimly-lit speakeasy from the 1920&#39;s, from the ragtime playlist to the streetcar aesthetic. (Think a bar version of the typical opening credits of a Woody Allen movie.) The drinks are varied and inspired, and the wait staff is nicely attentive for a busy place. Oh, and the best part?

A truly awesome bar spot. The decor is done by the same guy as Five Leaves and Maison Premiere -- so if you like that vibe then you&#39;ll love this. 

The drinks were strong and the food, which I believed we ordered from the restaurant below the bar, was awesome. I highly recommend the risotto.

There was a five piece jazz band starting at 1030 providing hours of free entertainment. How can you beat that?

I&#39;ll definitely be back for some more jazz and libations sometime soon. A classy spot."

We had the dinner after our wedding in their basement for 48 people. (I&#39;d say 50 people is the max for that room.) Everything was perfect: the food, the wine was excellent, and it was very reasonably priced relative to other places in Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and Bushwick--and we did a lot of research. Such a cool atmosphere in their basement too: intimate, old-timey, hip, Brooklyn-y. It was quite warm though but after we asked to turn the air-conditioning on, they did and all was well. Another note on the food: artisanal, farm-to-table, high-quality, well-prepared; everyone thought it was amazing. People said it was the best wedding they&#39;d ever been to.

This bar reminds me of my fav places: La Maison Premiere and Manhattan Inn. The bar is beautiful, they have these old cable fans set up and it just takes you away to another time - perhaps a steam punk time - but more like the 1920&#39;s.

The vibe is nice as I went there on a Tuesday night and they had a band playing some lounge music with guitars."

The first floor was beautiful and had a bit of a modern touch to it. It was very homey and comfortable. What REALLY set this place apart, however, was the basement. The gent taking our order informed us it used to be a speakeasy during the prohibition era.

The room downstairs was fairly small, but not in a claustrophobic kind of way (unless you can&#39;t stand low ceilings) and the lighting was impeccable- very romantic. The entire room was bathed in warm candle light with 1920&#39;s jazz music playing lazily in the background. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to impress a date. The mood is incredibly sexy and low-key. The drinks were very good too! I&#39;m hoping to go back as soon as this next weekend rolls around and maybe try the food as well."

Bartender made the soda, walked away, and I watched him take care of three other customers (existing and new). I assumed he forgot the coffee, left momentarily and came back a few minutes later. He&#39;d eventually started making the espresso but forgot about it and it had overflowed. I said, &#34;This is great! Actually, if that&#39;s waste then please, please don&#39;t make me another coffee, I would *love* to order a cocktail, may I see a drink menu?&#34; He said no (?!) and insisted on making me another espresso. &#34;No, but please I don&#39;t actually want a coffee after all. And since you haven&#39;t made the new one yet *please* let me give you a drink order.&#34; He still talked over me and insisted that he remake my coffee. Feeling uncomfortable I basically begged, &#34;Sir (oh yeah, I said &#39;sir&#39;) *please* don&#39;t make me a new coffee, I would really like to order a drink...&#34;

His response? &#34;FINE! I&#39;m making this for myself!&#34; and continued to make the espresso.

Are you kidding me?! Regardless of the fact that I work in the service industry, who the f*ck talks to a customer like that EVER? And because I do work in that field, I&#39;m overly polite to fellow servers/runners/bartenders, but that didn&#39;t help me one bit here. Not only that, but I was arriving late to a large gathering, and upon telling several friends this story they said &#34;Oh my god, this bartender is the worst. He is sooo slow, and his drinks do *not* taste right at all.&#34;

THE FOOD.

What the heck is wrong with the chefs here? My partner and I have been to St. Mazie for brunch three times now (I really want to love the place so I can come sink in the amazing space and incredible music as often as possible) and every single time we&#39;ve come for brunch our &#34;poached&#34; eggs have been cooked through! That&#39;s 8 attempts at poaching!! (my boyfriend wisened up and stopped hoping for the best after the first time). The flavor palates are just plain off on the dishes, sometimes it&#39;s just too sweet, sometimes it&#39;s just too bland and sometimes it becomes very obvious they have no idea how to cook potatoes without turning them into bricks. It got the point last time when I didn&#39;t even want to bother after the first bite.

Such a disappointment.

The service and food however left a lot to be desired. The bruschetta in particular was an embarrassment - two tiny pieces of crusty toast buried beneath a mound of inedible garnish. It really felt like it was trying to hard and was ultimately just a rip-off. Also, despite not being too busy, the staff almost ignored our party of 7 (no water refills etc).

The first thing you will be aware of when you go to St. Mazie is how beautiful and precise the interior is. From the furniture, to the stage, to the art, everything about the inside makes you feel like you&#39;ve immediately been transported somewhere that manages to be both exotic and comforting. Similarly, the wait staff here is generally friendly (bordering on talking a bit too much) and attentive, and they do their best to serve you promptly without rushing you.

But the place gets worse with every dish, unfortunately. 

To start off our meal, my friend and I got cocktails. We both agreed they were decent, but a bit too sweet. These we might order again. After cocktails, I ordered a brunch version of the BLT and my friend ordered a dutch pancake, and both were past a bit too sweet and just straight up cloying. 

His dutch baby was completely smothered in a fruity syrup, which overwhelmed any other flavor. He might as well just have been fed a bowl of it. My BLT was a hodge podge of unfortunateness, with bacon that might as well have been the pre-cooked Oscar Meyer stuff, poached eggs that were completely cooked through, french toast that was flavorless, and a tomato jam that, again, was so sweet that it overpowered all the other bad components and own the mega-bad ingredient award. 

Overall, I wanted to like St. Mazie. The atmosphere is great, but the cocktails were mediocre, and neither my friend or I finished are dishes (which is really sad because we&#39;re pigs). We actually went and got a sandwich right after to split because, despite being hungry, we simply couldn&#39;t finish the food."

That was just about the only accurate recommendation and the rest of the article was pretty boring... but I digress.

A lovely date (he was/is ... is, I guess because he isn&#39;t dead, the epitome of a Brooklyn boy who knows all the gorgeous hidden spots like someone out of a CW show) took my hand and brought me into this spot. There was a four-piece jazz band playing on that picturesque stage. I fell in love instantly and it wasn&#39;t with the guy.  

This space is so so so SO gorgeous! Girls DREAM of being whisked away to a place like this by a sexy, steel-eyed gentleman with stubble on his chin and great shoes. While the guy probably doesn&#39;t exist (and if he does he&#39;s a jerk anyway), Saint Mazie does."

They kept telling me that  my meat plate would be up any minute, all the while I was sitting there right next to the kitchen.

The hubby had the breakfast BLT, a decadent French toast with super crispy bacon and poached eggs with tomato compote and spinach.  I had the smoked fish with poached eggs over herbed creme fraiche and potatoes.  Will be coing back just for these dishes!!

Server was brand new and a bit slow/pokey; not super attentive, especially because it wasn&#39;t too busy.  But we sat in the beautiful back garden, which garners a little less attention, otherwise it would have been a solid 5 stars.  

Love this place.  Cozy and romantic for drinks and night, and now obviously for brunch on the weekend."

Let&#39;s start with mine. I ordered the fish plate. The fish was a few parsimonious spoonfuls of smoked trout, pickled vegetables and some rusks of white toast. The trout was featured in name only as the helping was scandalously small and the taste was lackluster, a Russ and Daughters reject. The pickles too were nothing special or memorable. No bite, no pizzazz. And the dry toast showed no imagination or knowledge of what balances well with smoked and brined food. A rye would&#39;ve been a more thoughtful choice. On to the mussels. Overdone. No more needs to be said. The white bean and veg bruschetta was so dominated by a mush of white bean that seemed like left overs from the day before that there was no distinction between the other ingredients. Typical of less than fresh fair as well as hack execution. 

With the small selection, I was initially excited, figuring that with so few things to pick, surely they would&#39;ve mastered them all. But what also caught my eye, most everything on the menu did not have to be made to order. A cost saver there, the price being quality. It may explain the overdone  mussels being - reheated, perhaps? Also, I the basement vibe reminded be of perhaps one of the top restaurants in the City - Peasant. The similarities are subterranean only.

Concerning service, inattentive at most, obsequious at best. The topper, they added items on the bill we never ordered. 

So I ponder is it me? Surely all these glowing reviews can&#39;t be wrong. Ill informed and possessing a naive palette is more likely the case. It reminds me of Lemon Grass Grill in Park Slope. They love it on Zagat. The reality is that it&#39;s a Mc Thai place for people too gutless to try the real deal. The people who review it are the hum job slack jaw denizens of the North Slope. They got money but they&#39;re so busy feedling young Skylar and Calab gluten free organic PBJ sandwiches  they wouldn&#39;t know a good meal if someone threw it in their face. I suspect a similar phenomenon taking place at Mazie and across most of Williamsburg. As I looked around, I couldn&#39;t help but notice a crowd that seemed far too young as well as mostly transplants perhaps too new to the City to have experienced NY&#39;s truly sublime eateries. 

With the exception of a handful of restaurants, the dining scene in Brooklyn is more name than game. Noodle Pudding, Colonie, Buschenshank, Marlow and Sons and some far flung African places off Nostrand are truly excellent, but for the most part, the North Brooklyn scene is disappointing. Restaurants like Mazie wouldn&#39;t survive a month in Manhattan. The competition is too fierce. 

In all, Mazie reminded me of a recent outing to Disarra Ramen. Crowded, noisy, forgettable service, and not an Asian in sight. They know better. Instead it was festooned with folks who never experienced ramen done right. Like Mazie, they were subjected to a menu and execution that says the owner / chef are skimping and cutting corners. I can&#39;t wait for the kidults in Williamsburg to grow up and try some real food across the river or in Queens and demand better from their nabe."

The band playing that night was alright, but I didn&#39;t very much enjoy it -- it was odd music to be playing..sounded like music out of a Russian wedding. I was hoping for some upbeat jazz music. The music killed the mood for me - they have live music every night though, so perhaps I just had bad luck.

It is located in your typical downtown NY location and we were visiting so we managed to find parking close by on a Sunday. It is a cute cafe that totally has a chic vibe to it.

I ordered the avo toast, quinoa hash, and green tea latte. The toast was A-MA-ZING! It had smashed avocado with seasonal vegetables and almond parm on 7 grain toast. It was quite flavorful and most importantly, the avocado was ripe. The quinoa hash was filling and maintained its shape, it did not turn crumbly as I would expect.The green tea latte tasted somewhat watered down.

There is seating, but it was very tight since I went on a weekend. The booths do not have much space in between one another so if you do not mind the close proximity it should not bother you. If you prefer more personal space, there is a larger table but you might have to share that with other patrons."

Knowledgeable, warm, and enthusiastic staff - such a nice way to start the day. Must get the breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich. Each are substantial meals. The quinoa hash brown is tasty, too, thanks especially to the paprika, scallions, and tofu cream on top. 

The lemon poppyseed muffin and green tea muffin are decent, but the highlights are the hot non-pastry meals.

I went with some classic menu items that I have not yet tried and was blown away by all of them. I love the Pesto Meatball sub, loaded fries, and Mac n Cheese. You could easily feed any of these menu items to a non-vegan and I doubt they would notice the difference. I tried a seasonal cupcake-pumpkin with marshmallows on top, which was flavorful and moist. The Kale and Cookies ice cream is also really nice (trust me, you don&#39;t taste the Kale).

I think a lot of people come here thinking the food is healthy, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not the case. I might come back to try the burger. The fries were good, but they tasted like they were cooked in a lot of oil. The beet ketchup also tastes wayyy too sweet.

I want to order this again asap. The sweet potato fries are seriously delicious, better than most places. I enjoyed the garlic chipotle style sauce on the side, but did not care for the beet ketchup. The guac burger was really good too. It tasted light and fresh.  I would go back for the salad before the burger though.

Even though it was a literal hike to get there, I am so glad they introduced me to this place!! The line met the door and the restaurant is narrow aka it was crazy cramped. Although many got their orders to go (probably because seating is minimal), looking around to see who was about to finish their meal was completely necessary to snag a seat.

You order at one of two registers and then get into another line to wait until your name is called. They also text you when your food is ready which is BEYOND HELPFUL because the menu isn&#39;t huge so a lot of orders are similar.

Everything in the restaurant is vegan. The burgers, ice cream, salads, cupcakes, pastas and ketchup is alllll 100% vegan. I ordered the quinoa taco salad (recommendation of the cashier) with sweet potato fries and my friend had one of the burgers with fries as well. We had to try the chipotle and beet ketchups and both agreed that we were a bigger fan of the chipotle one. 

Salads are huge so leftovers are in your future (praise hands going up!!) The food was filling yet light so feeling bogged down is not so likely aka theeee best combination in my opinion. I wish By Chloe would expand to the Midwest because I would love to keep going back! The food is not necessarily &#34;drop everythaang, this is remarkable!&#34; but it&#39;s fresh and rather unique!

If it&#39;s anything like the day I went, the demographic of their customers is overwhelmingly similar: young women in their 20s. I saw two guys in the hourish I was there and one was the cashier and one was my friend I was eating with. Gentlemen, don&#39;t let that stop you. Get to By Chloe and try one of their massive espresso chocolate chip cookies because I regretfully only eyed the beaut and didn&#39;t try it out."

The whiskey burger also had a lot of flavor. 

The air baked fries were good but a tad on the oily side. My body has a strange way of letting me know when I&#39;ve had too much oily foods - my nose gets very itchy.

The taco salad was my fave. Lots of different textures and flavors to keep your taste buds partying. The combo of corn, beans, tortilla chips, seitan, and the sour-cream like sauce was amazing. The guacamole burger was a great veggie burger overall but I felt like something was missing as it was somewhat one-note. 

The fries were a let down. Especially since those are my favorite food group aside from dessert. It came with a beet ketchup which was potent and the fries themselves were kinda soggy. My friend compared them to McDonald&#39;s fries (ouch).

+1 for messing up my order, twice, but mending the situation the first time. 
+1 for decent burger 

I just don&#39;t understand. How can a highly revered establishment, especially one that is under the &#34;By Chloe&#34; name mess up my order twice?! I ordered Air-baked Sweet Potato Fries and a Guac Burger. I paid the exact amount for both items, so I know the cashier definitely got my order down. When I got my order, I noticed that the fries were of the regular kind, so I quickly talked to the manager, who obligingly gave me the Sweet Potato Fries. I couldn&#39;t give back the wrong fries, due to some food safety law. 

Because it was my first time trying By Chloe&#39;s vegan restaurant, I didn&#39;t realize that I got the wrong burger by the time I sat down near the Pennsy to eat my meal. As I took a couple of bites, I was wondering to myself, &#34;Where&#39;s the guac..?&#34; And then my friend checked the menu and then told me that I probably was given the Classic Burger, which is $1 less than the Guac Burger.

Not only was I given the wrong fries, but I was also given the wrong burger! This might not seem like much of a big deal, but to me it is--how would you feel if you purchased something and it wasn&#39;t what you were expecting? I don&#39;t know about you, but I was pretty pissed off, since I had a terrible craving for guac that day. And it&#39;s really clever of By Chloe--they don&#39;t give out receipts to customers who pay with cash, so even if I went back, it would probably be pointless. 

The food: 

Classic Burger-
Reminded me of the burgers at shake shack. Buns were toasty and patty was flavorful. The lightness of the lettuce and tomatoes really complemented the heaviness of the patty. 

Air Baked French Fries + Sweet Potato Fries-
Terribly soggy. I hated them. I hated them even more when I found out that I got the wrong burger. Not worth the $3.95, and regardless of the method used to make French Fries, the ones at McDonalds are WAY better and cheaper. 

My friend&#39;s Spicy Thai Salad-
Way, way, WAAAYYYYY too much dressing. Everything else was alright, but hard to enjoy because the overwhelming flavor of the dressing kept getting in the way. 

For vegan food, there&#39;s really no need to go overboard on  seasoning. For me, vegan food is supposed to taste light on the palate and make me feel moderately full. The vegan food at By Chloe was heavy, and made me bloated."

I chose the location in flat iron and went around noon. There was a huge line which was expected since it was a Friday and prime time lunch hour. I ordered the quinoa taco salad with sweet potato fries and also tried the spicy Thai salad. 

You are able to give them your number so that they can text you when your order is ready. That&#39;s a bonus because you&#39;re able to come and go as you wish. The waiting area for this particular location was very small so it&#39;s a good idea on their part. The spicy Thai salad only took a few minutes but i ended up waiting about 15 minutes for the taco bowl. Again, it was lunch hour so it&#39;s not surprising. The staff was handing out peanut butter hot chocolate for customers in line which was nice. It was thick and creamy and definitely very sweet. 

Once the food came, I realized it was too much food for me. The bowls are pretty big in size and the two of us didn&#39;t end up finishing two bowls.

The ambience was loud and quite cramped but since it was a busy time, that was expected. If it were less busy, I would have enjoyed sitting there for a longer period of time. A good lunch spot for if youre alone or with company. 

The taco bowl is flavourful with lots of toppings. Definitely a must try. The Thai bowl was a bit sweet for my liking; I needed to buy water to help wash it down. But both were a good lunch option and I was happy with the choices. 

Overall, I can see why they get good reviews. Will definitely be returning for their food!"

1) The food is super tasty
2) It&#39;s healthy and everything is vegan 
3) It&#39;s filling (unlike a lot of vegan places!)
4) It&#39;s affordable ($10 to get me full)
5) Service is super efficient. It&#39;s packed basically all the time but if you&#39;re eating in, they text you when your order is ready, and you can spend the time waiting finding a seat. Took about 5-10 mins to wait in line and 10 mins to get my food &amp; find a seat at peak lunch hour. 

My favorite dish is the avocado pesto pasta. Hands down. Super tasty. I get the small ($5!) because it&#39;s so filling! 

Second fave is the vegan mac &amp; cheese. They use cashew cheese and it almost tastes like the real thing. Def worth a try. 

I haven&#39;t tried the brunch food yet, but I know I&#39;ll be back again and again to try the rest of the menu!"

Highlights: Guac burger, market vegetable, espresso giant cookie! The burger itself is really filling and you really don&#39;t need much of a side, you could probably split one. 

We also shared the macha cupcake and the marshmallow pumpkin spice cupcake and both were super delicious! The macha cupcake had fresh blueberries in it. 

Overall the pricing isn&#39;t great (over $130 for 6 people, however we did all order a main, side, drink, and split some desserts)...but steep if you just want a salad and probably will pay around $15, that&#39;s not bad by NYC standards though."

I&#39;m usually a meat eater and I really enjoyed my food here. The wait wasn&#39;t too bad to order. Mostly looking for a seat is the tough part.

I had the Mac n cheese, guac burger, and the pesto meatball sandwich. Everything was really good! The shiitake bacon in the Mac n cheese enhanced the flavor a lot and it does tastes like bacon too. The pesto meatball sandwich was oozing with delicious avocado and sauce. I would definitely order that one again!! The sauce in guac burger kinda tastes like a Big Mac.

I would definitely come back."

By Chole was the type of vegan restaurants that I always turn to when craving veggie dishes, it was simple yet trendy.

Unfortunately I arrived a bit too early, so was not able to try their quinoa toco salad that I was longing, which was only served during lunch times. Settled myself with the avocado toast - only a small piece yet very fulfilling, considering the huge avocado smashed and bell pepper/tomato pieces on top. 

Pretty spacious and lots of seats if you arrive early, but for some reason it was too dim inside. I would not resist dining in, but prefer to grab-n-go."

Unfortunately, this place did not meet my expectations hence the 3 stars.

I came by around 1:30 PM on a Friday and the line was almost out the door.  When you first walk in, you can grab a nice colorful menu to your right.  The line moved fairly quick (10-15 mins) but the waiting time was around 20-25 minutes.  I got their famous Quinoa Taco Salad, Sweet Potato Fries and a Pup-Cake for my doggie at home.

Quinoa Taco Salad - consists of spicy seitan chorizo, black beans, sweet corn, avocado, tomato, tortilla strips, crema and agave-lime vinaigrette.  The portion was pretty good for $10.95!  The salad tasted good and fresh but I have to complain it was a bit too sweet for me (probably the agave)!

Sweet Potato Fries - I was really looking forward to this but a bit disappointed.  My fries were not crunchy AT ALL - it was very chewy and hard to eat.  To make matters worst, when I got to the bottom, the fries were mostly SOGGY.  I am extremely disappointed about this.  Although I have to say... these fries taste okay with their chipotle aioli sauce.

Pup-Cake - EXTREMELY disappointed in the size.  Before I ordered, I imagined it to be like the ones from Sprinkles but I was so wrong.  They advertised this as &#34;house-made organic whole oat K9 CUPCAKES.&#34; They were the size of a MUNCHKIN AND THEY WERE $1.95 EACH.  And they do not look CLOSE to a cupcake at all.  The only reason why I got it was because I want my dog to try it.

I also have to complain about the ordering &amp; waiting system here.  It is terribly organized.  You wait on line (to your right) to order then you have to wait even longer to get your order (left side of the line).  Even though they take down your number to &#34;text&#34; you when your order is ready... I never got a text.. they just call people&#39;s name when it&#39;s ready... whole process is just extremely messy.

The only thing I will compliment on is the attitudes of the employees here.  They all seem very patient and helpful.  Not too sure if I will return though."

Much less crowded than the Bleecker St location - shorter lines and more seating - which is a definite plus.  We stopped by for breakfast on a Saturday morning and had no trouble getting a table. 

This location also has a few additions to the menu. The Sunrise breakfast burrito was great. 

The raspberry coffee cake and Mom&#39;s cinnamon roll were also highlights of our meal. If you&#39;re going for lunch, I highly recommend Chloe&#39;s taco salad!"

They provide some delicious combinations of fake meat and potatoes. This location is also less crazy than the Village spot.

The air baked potatoes are good but can be a little soggy at times if not fully cooked. Regardless I keep ordering them because, fries.

avocado toast, BBQ seitan, and morning scrambles later the food has been good. greasy a bit even. probably why its so tasty.

I also enjoy the matcha blueberry muffin even though I&#39;m trying to be low carb. I usually eat it a few days after purchase so it can be a little dry but its a tasty little pastry."

The salad was sweet and I loved the crunchy texture for the taco bits. The salad portion size was pretty big. It was a little too much for me. I was a little bloated after eating it. One problem I had with this salad was that the lettuce was still very wet with water. Other than that, the salad was tasty.

I am not sure if I&#39;d stop by here for lunch again as the line was super long. It took 40+ minutes before I was able to place an order and get my lunch."

And it definitely didn&#39;t disappoint!

By Chloe is a vegan restaurant that everyone loves. It was fun visiting and seeing some of the recipes that I first learned how to make from her cookbooks. The new Flatiron location seemed to be pretty busy despite being only a few weeks old, with a decently long line the whole time I was there. The fare at By Chloe is reminiscent of fast food, but obviously WAY more healthier and delicious. I get the pesto meatball sub, which was delicious, along with the air baked fries. Yum!!

Chloe is also big on desserts, so it&#39;s no surprise that there were lots of those to choose from! I tried the Chlostess cupcake (a veganized Hostess) as well as kale cookies &amp; cream ice cream. Sure, it may sound weird, but it was super yummy.

So go forth and visit By Chloe, whether you&#39;re vegan or not. You may find that vegan food can still be insanely delicious (because it&#39;s true!)."

I went with the Classic Burger (on multigrain) and split sweet potato fries with my boyfriend. The burger was so delicious, especially if you like pickles. I asked for the special sauce on the side just in case, but it was soooo delicious and made the burger. Again, pickly taste. I&#39;m pretty sure this is what McDonald&#39;s used to taste like in my childhood, but would never step foot in there now - ha!

The sweet potato fries tasted like they were regularly fried even though they use air frying - 10/10!! Sauces - beet ketchup was ok, chipotle aioli was amazing. My boyfriend got the Meatball Hero, which he loved even for a non-vegan/still McDonald&#39;s eater!!

For dessert we overloaded and shared the espresso chocolate chip cookie, GF chocolate chip cookie and kale cookies &#39;n cream ice cream. The GF cookie still had tiny remnants of cookie dough in the center - baked to perfection. Delicious. The espresso was good, but I&#39;m not too into crunchy cookies. The ice cream as others said looks a bit too frozen on top, but it was still great, just not a creamy ice cream. 10/10+ visit!!!"

For folks that are strict vegans I&#39;m sure by Chloe is a godsend.  Entrees and other food items are creative but is this place healthy?? IMHO... Junk food with the vegan moniker.   

The queuing system is a calamity. I waited in line for about 10 mins and then another 15 for my food. I didn&#39;t mind the wait but there is zero organization at this place so while you are waiting for your food you are just mushed up against everyone else. 

I ordered the Thai salad, gluten free and dressing on the side.  Also got the chocolate chip cookie which looked so pretty.  When I got my salad, they said gluten free.   Upon inspection, I said &#34;where&#39;s my dressing in the side?&#34; Said salad had wontons chips which thank goodness I looked because they gave me the wrong salad.  

All would have been forgiven had the food been good. The tempeh in the salad was drenched with some sweet cloying sauce that I had to pile in the corner of my salad bowl not to be eaten.  Ok.  Maybe a recovery w the cookie? Nope. Tasted like cardboard and went straight into the garbage.  $16 for meh food with not great service.  My inclination was to give this joint one star but I do love what they are trying to do and if the line wasn&#39;t so long I would come by to buy the whole young coconuts at $5 (?) a pop.  I guess if you are vegan it&#39;s a fine choice.  And probably the junkier food items like the air fries or the Mac and cheese would have been a tastier choice. If one wants to delude themselves that just because it&#39;s vegan, it&#39;s healthy.  Don&#39;t. But if you want vegan fast food Chloe is one of the trendy options in the hood.  I&#39;d rather go to sweet green to get something healthy."

Everything here is fresh and delicious. I normally hate salads but the kale caesar here is fantastic. I just have to remind myself that vegan =/= healthy, and i&#39;m pretty sure the calorie / fat content of most of the food here is low, hence why it&#39;s so delicious. 

PSA: You can do a half-n-half order of regular fries and sweet potato fries!"

The layout isn&#39;t as open and bright as the Bleecker Street one, so it will be interesting to see how they deal with crowds (that side door helps a lot with a quick exit at the other one). They still have a large communal table as well as a number of tables along the sides, so it feels like they can seat more people, but the waits will inevitably start right away.

If you are there for breakfast (this one opens at 7:30), definitely try the Mornin&#39; Glory ($10), which is a take on a Sausage &amp; Egg Sandwich, with Scrambled Tofu in place of eggs, and the addition of some chunky avocado slices. Just like the other stuff, it will be hard to understand how this is vegan and so good.

From the current two seasonal smoothies, both are deliciously refreshing and make you feel like you&#39;re being a bit healthier, but  I&#39;d definitely go with the Purple Rain. I&#39;ll be back soon for some of the other breakfast items, including their take on a breakfast burrito and some of the toasts."

Accidentally found out their new location just opened up at Flatiron near my office, I literally ran there to try out this place!

Spicy Thai Salad- Delicious. Somehow taste like Pad Thai salad lol.

Quinoa Taco Salad- so yummy! but I&#39;m not sure why is it &#34;taco?&#34;

Air-baked fries and sweet potato fries- I&#39;m usually a big fan of sweet potato fries than regular fries but I think the air-baked technique makes the sweet potato fries a bit on the drier side. Regular fries turn out to be more delicious. And the chipotle ketchup was oh my god!

Mac n&#39; Cheese- I love it. Not as cheesy and greasy as regular Mac n&#39; Cheese, the shiitake mushroom was excellent.

I forget that everything is vegan. The line gets long between hours of dinner time, so plan accordingly. Also, I learned this after coming the first time that most people usually order to go in case all the seats are occupied, or if you are dining in, then best have your friend hold seats while you order for them. Personally, I like the layout of the Bleecker St location better because even though it is equally crowded, at least the line doesn&#39;t overlap with walking space. The Bleecker location also has a separate shop next door for all the sweet stuff in case you want to skip the main course and go right to dessert.

When I heard that this location had finally opened, I knew I needed to check it out. Came for breakfast to avoid what my coworkers told me were lines out the door at lunch, and I ordered a Mornin&#39; Glory and Chlostess cupcake (I can have cake for breakfast, I&#39;m an adult). Both were absolutely amazing and packed with flavor. I wouldn&#39;t have believed the cupcake was vegan at all, in fact.

Definitely want to come back to try some of the lunch options that everyone raves about.

I ordered the classic veggie burger and actually couldnt even tell I was eating a veggie burger. The beet ketchup is REALLY good and sweet tasting, the pickles are perfect and the onions aren&#39;t strong so you dont have to worry about onion breath all day at work if you choose this for your lunch spot. The bun was a little hard but still nicely toasted and almost like a potato bun but not sure exactly. 

Splurged for the regular fries which werent AS good as I was expecting, but they are tasty and the chipotle aioli sauce you can get on the side is g o o d. Definitley has a kick to it. I also went for the *old fashioned* choco chip cookie, not hte regular one and boy was that a great decision. SO soft, didnt break all over, perfect amount of chips, and yummy nuts in it. 

My friend got the avo toast and lemonade with sweet potato fries and all looked fabulous (you can follow her @jewforkcity on insta ;) )

I ordered the Quinoa Taco Salad ($10.95) as one of my NY foodie friends had recommended it to me, and I was so impressed.  Had me like, &#34;wait a second...  that was a completely meat-free vegan taco salad??  Ya could&#39;ve fooled me!&#34;  Whatever they&#39;re doing back there, they are doing it right.  And it was completely satisfying...  I couldn&#39;t even finish my salad.  

I also ordered the Air Baked Sweet Potato Fries ($3.95) to share - DELICIOUS!  Make sure to get the Chipotle Aioli sauce (I could actually eat this stuff with a spoon if that was socially acceptable).  

I know the location in West Village always has a line around the corner.  Not sure if not enough people have caught on to this new location or what not, but we got pretty lucky with no line and a very short wait for our food.  Seating is first come, first served...

We ordered the burgers, Mac n cheese, original and sweet potato fries and artichoke dip. All good. The artichoke dip tasted a little on the sour side as artichokes normally taste. It&#39;s served with tortilla chips on the side. They also serve all natural smoothies for about$7.50 small/$8.50 large and bottled green juice.

I&#39;ve been wanting to try By Chloe for a while; I do own her Italian cookbook and love her style! I&#39;ve walked past her Bleeker Street location quite a few times, scared by the &#39;round the block line I saw each time! However, when my friend Liana, a burgeoning plant-based food connoisseur, posted video of her eating there on her Snapchat, I knew I&#39;d have a partner in crime to go with me! Little did I know that a location opening neat the Flatiron, however! Upon entering there around 6 p.m. on a Monday night with her and another friend, the crowd was nothing compared to downtown, and thank goodness! Patrons seemed a bit more interested in take-out options, and we were easily able to sit for our entire 45-ish minute duration there. 

Of course, upon my arrival, I had just spent the previous weekend recovering from a food allergy attack, so my tummy was a little on the *myeh* side, still. The menu looked promising, however! As I have a Brewer&#39;s Yeast allergy, I am not sure how Nutritional Yeast might affect me...and I don&#39;t want to purposely find out. Ha! Some dishes had &#34;cheese&#34; on them, likely seasoned with the yeast, so I avoided that, but I found many other options. The Gauc Burger looked superb, so I went for it. Per their menu, it consists of a  black bean/quinoa-sweet potato patty, corn salsa, onion, guacamole, tortilla strips, and chipotle aioli on a whole grain bun. WHOA, SON. It&#39;s just as delicious as the description makes it sound, not overwhelmingly huge (i.e. - just the right size), and the chipotle aioli really seals the deal. I also got an order of sweet potato fries, and they were spectacular, flavorful, and, because they&#39;re air baked, not too soggy or dripping in oil. My friends, respectively, got the avocado toast and the Spicy Thai bowls, and they both devoured them! 

I&#39;m so glad I got a chance to swing by and get some fast food that was as delicious as it was nourishing. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll return, though I do want to give the O.G. location a chance someday, as well!"

I had the Guac Burger, which I thought for my first ever non-meat burger, was actually quite tasty. By the time I got to the end of the burger though, i realized I wasn&#39;t a fan of the mushy texture (bean + sweet potato patty) and was craving the savory flavor of real meat.

Probably wouldn&#39;t come back, but glad I gave it a try. I&#39;m no expert in vegan food, but I imagine if you&#39;re vegan, this is definitely five star stuff!"

Definitely a fast-casual sort of deal and a kitschy, diner vibe with some odd decor. 

I dragged my non-vegan friend here, and his verdict was that it&#39;s the bomb dot com. 

I ordered the Taco Salad and he ordered the Guac Burger with a side of fries with the beet and chipotle ketchup. We dug in ravenously, probably fueled from nonstop sightseeing all day. We came nowhere close to finishing either. 

Taco Salad: I thought the quinoa was a very nice touch, along with the standard issue &#34;Taco veggies&#34;. I didn&#39;t really know what the white sauce was, but I went into it without question. Don&#39;t question the white sauce. It&#39;s great. 

Guac burger: The tempeh is flavorful, salty, and compliments the guac nicely -- and essentially is a burger &#34;without guilt&#34; so ring one up for a fake cheat day. 

Air baked fries: I am not a fan of beets, and so I&#39;m not sure why swirling the fries in magenta liquid would change my mind. I gave it a chance, and was not really a fan, but I know a lot of people beg to differ. The orange sauce -- chipotle, I believe -- was amazing. I&#39;m hesitant to go back to my ketchup-vore ways. 

So yes, come here, and come here with an open mind."

I came with 3 friends on a Saturday around 1pm. Although the restaurant was busy, we found a table quickly that also had a trendy swing replacing one of the seats. 

Between the 4 of us we ordered: 
Whiskey bbq burger
Quinoa taco salad
Sweet potato fries
Avocado toast
Pesto pasta
Kale artichoke dip

As you can tell, we definitely had enough food and left the restaurant STUFFED. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their options and I was absolutely obsessed over how incredible my quinoa taco salad and sweet potato fries were. The salad had the perfect amount of dressing and flavor while the fries were delightfully crispy and perfectly paired with beet ketchup/spicy aioli. 

Overall, this place gets an A+. Whether you are vegan, meat lover, or somewhere in between, you won&#39;t be disappointed! I plan on returning here ASAP!"

Honestly, I would not go back!
The athmosphere is good, the people working there are really nice, but the food --nee!
Our sweet potato fries were not cooked enough, the mac and cheese wasn&#39;t really tasty and all you could taste in the guac burger was guacamole. 
The cookie was average and the ice cream was nothing special either! It looked all really nice, but at the end the taste is, what counts most.
I feel like they put a lot of effort in promoting it and making it look fancy but don&#39;t care enough about the actual food they are serving.

I also tried the greek salad for my entree and it was so delicious. The salad was so colorful and packed with tons of nutritious veggies. I can honestly say...I&#39;ve been craving this salad ever since I tried it. I also tried the purple rain smoothie and it was made of blueberries and other nourishing fruits. All the dishes look bright and colorful. I love how I can pig out here and not feel guilty about anything I ate. I have yet to try their vegan icecream (they have plenty  of options).

By Chole is an excellent surprise we ended up coming here 3 times during our stay in New York. Quiet at breakfast but come lunch time and supper time the place is packed!  Great food and didn&#39;t have me yearning for my usual beef chicken or pork!  

Vegan food done properly I must say.  I&#39;m a novice when it comes to vegetarianism or the vegan world. But if it&#39;s tastes good then I&#39;m not too concerned at all.

Beetroot ketchup, Guac Burger and the Quinoa hash browns &amp; the weekend cinnamon swirl are the highlights here.  Go there! You won&#39;t regret it!"

Both were excellent and tasted super healthy :) I also sampled some of my coworker&#39;s order of sweet potato fries with the chipotle aioli and they tasted great! I got an espresso chocolate chip cookie to split with my boyfriend later - it was really thin and crispy but huge! The flavor was good but was a tad too salty, which was unexpected. I don&#39;t really see myself going here too often since I&#39;m not vegan, but I do want to try the brunch and smoothies. It&#39;s so close to my office, it&#39;s too convenient to not come back!

The tables are basically first come first serve. They had a glitch with their computer system when I was waiting on line. It seems they were struggling to come up with a back up plan when their computers broke and they ended up passing around free samples. Finally they decided to take orders by hand and separate two lines for cash and credit card. 

The food here is so good. 
-Kale Caesar salad - slightly over dressed for my liking but the dressing is DELICIOUS. The croutons were crunchy and the shitake &#34;bacon&#34; was very good. The portions are also huge. 
-Mac and cheese - This was also very good. Tasted just like mac and cheese.

When I heard they were opening up another location that was closer to me, I knew it was finally my chance to try it.  

Shortly after opening (maybe the week of) I made it there early on a Saturday morning.  I went for an early morning bike ride, and decided I was going to end up there, so I could finally try it.  I figured if I got there early enough there was not going to be a wait. I was right.  I showed up around 8:45/9 and they had opened at 8:30.  I was not the first person there, but there were only a few other people. More came and went throughout my meal, but it never got too crowded. I took a look at the menu, and decided to go with the early bird: scrambled organic tofu, spinach, maple sausage, market greens and 7-grain toast. When I went up to the counter to order I was tempted by the huge cupcakes, and other pastries that were on display, but stuck with my original order.  When you order they take your number so they can text you when your food is ready.  That&#39;s probably more useful when there&#39;s more people and you can&#39;t really wait near the counter. which wasn&#39;t the case Saturday morning.   

My food didn&#39;t take too long to come out.  It looked good, but I also grabbed some chipotle aioli to have on the side.  I am by no means a vegan, but everything I had was so good.  All the components of the dish were separate, but I wound up piling some of it up on the toast and eating it.  The tofu was good, but I did put the chipotle aioli on it. It gave it a nice kick.  The maple sausage was really good too. It was both sweet and spicy at the same time.  Definitely had the maple flavor, but also had a kick to it. I can&#39;t wait to come back and try some other dishes!

Like I said I haven&#39;t been to the other location, so I don&#39;t know how big it is, but I thought this location was a pretty good size.  There were maybe 10-15 tables inside, but I&#39;m sure people will be taking it to go as well.  I&#39;m happy to have finally tried ByChloe, and see it lived up to the hype, at least for me. I definitely plan on going back!"

I was so excited to try this place namely because I&#39;m basic like that, but also I love a good veggie burger. Chloe, I wanted to love you so much. 

First, this place had a line out the door at 12 noon in the middle of the week. I generally don&#39;t care about that, and they were handing out free juice samples so that was fine EXCEPT the inside of the dining area is small and narrow and the line ran right through it. Not conducive for a stellar dining experience in my opinion, even for the Fast Casual segment. 

Second, my burger was OK. Seriously a 3 star veggie burger. I have made better at home. Why is this a thing? Also, the beet ketchup was kind of gross. Pretty though. 

Third, my friend and I decided to share a side of vegan mac n cheese. I normally love vegan mac, this was pretty meh. No flavor. We didn&#39;t finish it. 

On a positive note, my chocolate chip cookie was cookielishious. Seriously dayum. 

I may be wrong and don&#39;t lynch me if I am, but I&#39;d say hard pass on the burgers, but strongly recommend for the baked goods."

Guac Burger-better than the original, everyone agrees they like this one the best!
Mac n cheese-love the crispy shiitake bacon and the rich creamy sweet potato sauce.
Sunrise breakfast burrito-wouldn&#39;t have gotten it unless recommended, but after one bite was seriously like &#34;oh my glob.&#34; It&#39;s outstanding. The &#34;chorizo&#34; really tastes like chorizo!

The guy I interacted with at the front counter was really cool, but didn&#39;t know much about the products(specifically the baked goods in the case). Still pretty good service and quick here.

I got the raspberry coffee cake. I was excited that the server picked out the biggest piece without me suggesting it...WIN. It wasn&#39;t the greatest coffee cake though. It was kind of texture-less and not super flavorful. At least have more raspberry flavor. It was pretty blah. I&#39;m glad I tried at least something here, but I think since it&#39;s revolutionary in the vegan world it gets a little too much recognition that may not be deserved. That&#39;s just my two cents.

Also, beware that vegan does not always mean healthier...if you&#39;re a calorie counter you might as well just eat a meat burger and save yourself the extra friedness of the burgers at By Chloe. 

Conclusion: good spot with decent food, but overhyped too. Vegan doesn&#39;t automatically mean healthier."

My friend had recommended By Chloe, or to put it more accurately: she told me we HAD to eat here or I&#39;d be eating on my own. (Now I understand why)

The food here is absolutely amazing. Everything is vegan, fresh, and delicious. 

Very trendy atmosphere...which at first, made me nervous because sometimes trendy spots are lacking in the food department. Not the case here.

Everyone working here is friendly. Prices are reasonable. My friend&#39;s order took a while to come so they actually gave her doubles of everything. (Not a bad deal)

However, I will compare offerings between the two where applicable, I went with my favorite from the Bleecker street location, the Guac Burger, and another crowd favorite, the mac and cheese. I rounded out my picks with the lemon poppy seed muffin, since it was too cold and rainy for me to enjoy a salad.

In order from Good to No:

The Good:
The lemon poppy seed muffin didn&#39;t taste stale and the thin layer of glaze was a nice touch, any more than that and it would have been too sweet. It was a bit crumbly, but still good. It would have been better slightly warm.
I would get it again.

Guac Burger had a healthy heaping of Guac  (plus) but it was missing the aioli, which I happened the grab at the counter. Without it, the burger was still tasty but it was missing that unifying element that made me fall in love with it. I will always get this burger, but will make sure to grab extra aioli first.

Finally, the No: 
I don&#39;t get the rave reviews about the mac and cheese. The sauce was gritty, as though the cashews were not blended well and, despite the sprinkle of paprika on top, it was pretty bland. But the most offensive part of this dish was the mushroom bacon. For the record, I love mushrooms. However, the bacon tasted like the soaking water of dried shittake mushrooms that was left out to ferment for 3 days.
It was absolutely disgusting. I don&#39;t think I have ever made or bought vegan Mac and cheese that disgusted me so much. I really think I got a bad batch, but I&#39;m not about to order it again to find out. 

This By Chloe is fly free and features an open kitchen, so I happened to peep a server eating next to the prep area then plating and bagging food. They have an A, so they should know better. It is also significantly smaller than the original, just as crowded during the lunch rush and yet they somehow managed to fit a patron restroom (bless you, Chloe). The cashiers were neither rude nor overly friendly, they just looked a bit over it. It was also impossible to hear them over the lunch rush. They ask for your number to text you when your food is ready, but then call your name over the crowd anyway. At one point, the registers were left empty so the cashiers could go to help prep/bag while a line was forming. The manager had to ask repeatedly who was on register for them to return. They need more organization/staff at this location, especially since the space is so small.

I ultimately gave this location 3 stars, because they take Level Up and were pretty fast. As for the franchise as a whole, though the salads look good (particularly the thai and the taco salads) and certain dishes are tasty, I feel that By Chloe (fittingly) is best at desserts and that&#39;s honestly all I would get here.

I would probably go to Terri around the corner for my lunch needs."

The MINUS 4 STARS is for the manager who has the most standoffish and just downright bitchy attitude I&#39;ve ever experienced. Honestly it feels warmer in mcdonalds than in by Chloe when she&#39;s running around. 

It&#39;s also for their incredibly strict lunch policy. They literally will not serve you a lunch item if it&#39;s 10:59. 

There was one time when I asked for a guac burger at 1057 and was denied but then this big executive chef guy glances over and was like &#34;it&#39;s three minutes away! Just take the order&#34;. That&#39;s the best customer service I&#39;ve experienced there ever and it was abrupt to say the least.

I find it strange that she sells matcha tea on the shelves but doesn&#39;t offer it on the menu. This would be a great addition to the drink selection, and could help promote the product as well.

This was delicious! Tomatoes were great and the seitan chorizo tasted like meat! We also ordered unsweetened iced tea and that was nice, too. Place is small and cute. It was a little weird where they ask for your cell number so they can text you when your meal is ready. My meal was ready before I stepped away from the cashier. Food&#39;s a bit pricey.

The sauces are really good. The ketchup and chipotle are SOOO good.

As a fan of spicy foods, the Spicy Thai was extremely delicious. The sauce on top fit just right with the fresh greens underneath and the taco strips gave just the right amount of crunch. It was approximately $11.00, and there is no tip necessary. 

The entire experience was just plain awesome, as someone who is not a big meat person, I was avoiding ordering the salads with &#34;meat&#34; on it until my friend told me the entire brunch place was vegan. Though, I can assure you that even if you&#39;re a meat lover, you will love this place.

As mentioned the salads range from $8-12, which is not too expensive in my opinion. I&#39;m pretty sure you can tell from the picture, but these salad bowls were quite large and hefty. In fact, neither my friends nor I were able to finish the salads. I actually noticed that most people shared one portion with a side or two (their fries are a-ok), however, this obviously varies for different people. 

The only bummer to By Chloe would be their long lines and long waits (especially if you arrive there around 1-2pm on a weekend) . Not only do you have to wait 15-30 minutes to actually arrive at the front desk, you have to wait quite some time for your food to actually be made. It is a popular shop so it is understandable. 

The shop actually offers limited seats and usually the entire brunch place will be filled and packed. I would suggest (if you&#39;re with a friend) to split up, allow one to order and one to wait for seats. These seats are not managed by a waiter or whatnot (thus there being no tip necessary), so if you see a seat, go claim it!! 

All in all I would really suggest you to try this place out, their sauces and dressings are pretty much - on point, so if you ever stop by this place on an empty stomach, hop in line!!"

I&#39;ll admit the first time I visited the original Bleecker St location just about everything I ordered I was NOT a fan of, I know my palette prefers more savory than sweet. I&#39;d had the BBQ Sandwich, Mac &amp; Cheese, Brusselsprouts and a Chlostess cupcake - my tastebuds only preferred the brusselssprouts.

Then just a few weeks ago I discovered the tastiness of the Classic Burger as Chloe had a booth at Governor&#39;s Ball 2016! I&#39;ve been anxiously walking by this &#34;Coming Soon&#34; window for months and although I swung by with an empty excited appetite for a 45 min wait at the height of lunchtime: by Chloe did me so right!

Guac burger (w/o onion, I asked and its raw - tummy no-likey) w/air baked fries were perfect for a pre-weekend &#34;healthy-unhealthy&#34; (vegan-burger!) Nabbed a cupcake and plate sized cookie to-go. I&#39;ll be back again soon. :)"

The space is larger than the west village (longer and not as square) and wasn&#39;t crowded when we got there at 800 pm on Saturday

We went to town and ordered a bunch of stuff:

- Kale Caesar Salad - phenomenal, but you may want to have them go light on the dressing
- Pesto Meatball Sandwich - very good as well, and wish they could serve this sans bread!
- raspberry cupcake (the cupcake that won cupcake wars)
- lemon poppy seed muffin - this was a bit dry, perhaps it was from the morning (we had dinner here) so it wasn&#39;t as fresh
- ice tea mixed with the lemonade - just perfectly mixed

I didn&#39;t try my usual order - the quinoa taco, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s good cause I loved everything else that we ordered... If I could have this everyday, I would go vegan!

This is my benchmark. The bread is from Orwasher&#39;s in the UES and it is divine. The avocado portions is always the perfect balance between satisfying/avocado overkill.

I am recently on a health kick so I was looking for a way to spice up not eating meat. I got a guac burger with Sweet Potato fries. Tasted really good it didnt even taste like veggies. 

As for decor/ambiance, its crowded and noisy, but that&#39;s not surprising for a place in NYC, and even moreso on a Friday night. The line was a little long. When you order they take your cell phone and they text you when its ready. They also call out names but who can hear them with all the noise. They need a PA system or something, plus the music was kind of loud. Its also a tight squeeze, when you&#39;re going to get your napkins or sauces you have to dodge people who are standing around waiting on orders."

Breakfast sampling:
- *The Sunrise is a flavor explosion of ingredients from black beans, corn, avocado, onion, fake sausage and tofu that somehow tastes like scrambled eggs, wrapped in a tortilla into a burrito 

- The Early Bird is the vegan version of eggs and sausage but I found it to be bland. Pass 

- Quinoa hash brown was spicy and mushy, drizzled with sour cream and sprinkled with paprika. Pretty but not a fave

Dinner sampling:
- *avocado toast was generous, and tasty with a sprinkle of sea salt and hot pepper flakes, a staple for me

- *combo of regular and sweet potato fries that is air baked?! this invention tis better than sliced bread!

- *kale and artichoke dip was worth every calorie, soooo tasty. Rich in flavor, gooey and you won&#39;t remember there&#39;s kale!

- tried both their burgers and as much as I want to like it, I don&#39;t :( I found the texture to be too mushy, like patties made of mashed potato. And while there was flavor, it doesn&#39;t hit the right notes and is just a mishmash of flavors"

Had the classic burger.  Nice size.  I really wanted to love it. But I actually got tired of eating it about half way through. The aoli is good, the beet ketchup on the sweet side.  After a while they just started to taste the same: sweet. Superiority Burger remains my #1. They&#39;re smaller, but I feel like I could eat two of them because they taste great.

Mac and cheese was good.. for being vegan.  Some things can&#39;t be totally substituted, but this was pretty good.  Love the &#34;bacon&#34; on top.. I&#39;d order the extra.  

Only real complaint is that the packaging, while pretty, is wasteful.  Did I really need that big old box for my cupcake?

They&#39;re right across from Olive Garden and next to Bite, and seemingly all the staffers were outside taking photos of the empty storefront, but greeting neither of us waiting. We (Chloe included) then waited until 7:35am for the cleaning products applied near the entrance at 7:25am to become less slippery (and for them to continue unpacking the branded van). 
What a difference compared to their original location, as they now seem to take their popularity for granted and are completely unresponsive to IG, twitter, and email, and their Instagram is shockingly just re-posts (mostly from Pinterest). The staffers here were also large in number but small in collective knowledge. I stepped up and asked what was available, and was told all breakfast and all day items, then they quickly retreated to say All Day was not available until 11am, a bit confusing given the name. I ordered 2 baked goods and they requested my # so they could let me know when it was ready, odd given that I was the first customer, ordered 2 already-made pastries, they had more than enough staff to get it quickly and send me on my way, and that there wasn&#39;t a large enough line where they couldn&#39;t just say my name when it was ready (when it was ready and they were bagging it, one staffer asked the other, &#39;Is that all he got?!&#39; with an appalled face). They then had issues with LevelUp but eventually seemed to figure it out (their 2nd customer knocked over the other ill-placed Levelup terminal). The $3.50 raspberry tiramisu cupcake and the $2.50 old fashioned (aka non-GF with pecans) chocolate chip cookie were both very good for vegan fare, but with the attitude and what will almost certainly become massive lines I won&#39;t be back.

*Mike was presumably at F&amp;F/soft open. I wanted FTR at both By Chloe locations, especially since this one gave nothing out for free to celebrate, not surprising given their hype now.

The Kale Cookies &amp; Cream &#39; ice cream &#39; was incredibly overfrozen, but the huge cinnamon chocolate cookie was great.

I liked how they had a quite a number of selections for their HH special so my friend and I were able to select the ones we really liked and just focused on those.  Very fresh and very good.  There was only one out of the 6 types that we both didn&#39;t enjoy cause it had a funky smell/taste to it (it was the second to last choice on the menu).

Also, we didn&#39;t realize that they had changed their HH hour from 5-7pm to 4-6pm but thankfully the waiter was super nice and gave us our oysters for the HH special price.

We also ordered two drinks: Spring &amp; Delancey and Lavender Piscine.  Both looked super delicious and very instagram-worthy.  

In addition to the oysters, we also ordered the chicken liver mousse.  While it was good, it was a little strange because the jar that the mousse came in basically had a thick layer of straight up fat on it.  My friend and I had to scrap the fat out before we could really indulge in the actual mousse.

It&#39;s $1 oysters from 5-7pm, and no, they are not just Blue Points. I freakin hate Blue Points. I got one of each of the five offerings they had that day, my favorite being East Beach Blonde. The oysters come with cocktail and soy sauce, the only down side being I&#39;m not such a fan of their cocktail sauce. I like a good amount of horseradish in mine and there&#39;s is very mild and with a strong tomato-y flavor. 

The decor is beautiful. At 5pm in September, the entire bar radiated with a soft light from the many large half-frosted windows. I usually like my bars dark, but there was something both soothing and energizing about the environment, it made me feel far away from NYC. There&#39;s lots of exposed brick, white, marble; it ends up looking both polished and rustic. The music was perfect in volume and selection: a good amount of jazz, but also Johnny Cash, the Violent Femmes, The Presidents of the Unites States, and Frank Sinatra. Sexy. 

I also had an order of their deviled eggs with salmon roe. The roe paired perfectly with the eggs, adding texture and a little saltiness. 

I ended up ordering two of the same drink while I was there: The Hunter. Made up of mezcal, ginger syrup, mesquite honey, lime and grapefruit, this is a cocktail that deserves your admiration. It&#39;s smoky but not too aggressive, and very refreshing. Hook this up to my veins please. Bartenders were very friendly while not being too chatty. 

A fun aside, the handicapped bathroom has the BEST acoustics of almost any space I&#39;ve ever been in. It&#39;s extremely large and spacious with high ceilings, and if you think you sound good in the shower just try belting out your go to karaoke song in there. Cuz that&#39;s what I did."

I had a dinner at Sel Rrose with my BF.
The waiter is super racism to us.except the one serve us oyster .

When we were ordering cocktail and food, waiter gave us  impatient face and attitude . I asked him if I can order seafood salad . 【 He asked me back, show me where seafood salad on the menu.】 I explained to him I don&#39;t see it on menu, but I saw other table has this kind of salad . Never back to our table and take care us. 

I guess this waiter had a bad day and try to forgive him,but he actually had a good time chat with other white customers about his life in LA next table.

If we only order one drink and sit there all day long. I could understand but An Asian Couple ordered cocktail, beer, fries,lobster roll, salad and oyster . $120 before tips. And usually we tips them 20%.
24$ for this service? No way. 

Start to regret , recommended this place to my friends and colleagues.  I ensure I will start tell this story to all the people.

I like the decor of the place.  It&#39;s not terrible large but you don&#39;t feel cramped.  I can see there being a wait if you came on a busy night.... Esp if only using indoor seating. 

My cocktail of choice was the Spring &amp;  Delancy.  Sweet but not too sweet.  The berry taste was perfect.  It&#39;s not overly strong and given the weather,  it&#39;s an ideal drink for summer. 

We came for oysters so oysters we got.  I think e shared 30 btwn 2 of us.  I prob could have eaten more. 

Then we decided to share the chicken liver dish.  

Waitstaff are attentive and nice. 
There is bar seating as well. 
It&#39;s also a place to come for a date. 

I def recommend and would love to return for more yumminess."

My friend ended up getting food poisoning from an oyster.

The servers were a bit aloof, but the ambiance is awesome. There&#39;s outdoor seating and an beautiful brick wall decor along the bar. The bar is long and spans the restaurant. 

We did the chef special for the oysters for $30 plus three extras (@ $3.50 a piece). I liked 2/4 of the oysters on the plate, but wasn&#39;t that impressed with the west coast oysters. Wine was $14 a glass and mediocre at best. 

Happy hour oysters sound like a great deal and the cocktails looked good, but I wouldn&#39;t rush to come back here. I&#39;ve had way better in NYC."

Sel Rrose is definitely very easy to miss. I normally hang out in this area but never even knew this place existed. 2 friends and I tried this place out on the Friday before July 4th. It wasn&#39;t too crowded, but we also had reservations.

We started out with some oysters and clams and everything was really fresh.
We each got one of their specialty cocktails. I got the Le Moult (whiskey, combier l&#39;orange, lemon, bonal gentiane-quina, pastis). I normally shy away from cocktails because a lot of places make it too sweet. But this one was pretty good. It was on the sweet side but not too much so. I tried my friend&#39;s lavender cocktail, which is their most popular drink and I didn&#39;t really like it. It tasted like soapy soda. It was presented very well though - even came with a lavender sprig. That being said, their cocktails are very well crafted, but also pretty expensive. 

Their menu options are pretty limited. My advice is to go in for a few oysters during happy hour and head to dinner elsewhere!"

Super great cocktail and wine list, nice selection of oysters and fabulous small plates. The service was okay, but not a deal breaker, maybe just improved communication between servers and runners or better execution to chefs. The food speaks for itself so this should not be a deterrent. Highly recommend the bone marrow, duck confit, steak tartar, chicken liver pâté and truffle fries. Personally, I&#39;m a purist when it comes to bone marrow so I did not care for the roasted pepper &#34;garnishment&#34; on it, but when I scooped it off I could get to the unctuous, salty, decadence with a crusty piece of bread- which was heavenly. The ambience is a major plus- speakeasy without being overly trendy vibe. SO highly recommend!"

Solid cocktails and $1 oysters during happy hour! Happy hour every day 5-7pm Monday - Thursday, 4-6pm on the weekends. You get a nice and fresh variety of oysters and some fresh little neck clams. Don&#39;t forget the well-balanced cocktails and plates. 

The wait staff service was spectacular and attentive but do expect a wait on the oysters while you salivate at the table. Everything I had, I would definitely recommend. Oysters were fresh and briny. The scallop crudo was thinly sliced topped with mint, orange zest and the orange oil really gave it an interesting combination. The chicken liver mousse was one of the best ones I had. It was rich, creamy, potent, top it with the sweet and sour shallot, heavenly. Truffle fries were not that crispy but that&#39;s the way I like it.

The food we had was quite good, but the service overall was simply just bad. There&#39;s just no way around it. The host was sitting down talking to his friends for about 5 minutes, before realizing he needed to do his job and you know, seat people. Not even apologetic, he was very curt, as if we were inconveniencing him, which was sort of off-putting. I&#39;m generally a pretty gregarious guy, but I just couldn&#39;t get past the passive-aggressive attitude. Anyways, I had a reservation for 4 people, and we were seated in the back. The place has a moderate amount of outdoor seating, and the inside space is nicely laid out, with a sort of dilapidated look, but executed in a relatively tasteful manner. 

We started with the pisco sour, and the prosecco on tap. The pisco sour was well-balanced, and I found myself really liking it, despite not typically going for sweeter drinks. We ordered every HH oyster they had on the list that day, and they were all tasty, and generally all had a very clean finish. The Littleneck clams were delicious too, but even at the HH price, it&#39;s not really that good of a value, since it&#39;s only a morsel of food. We also ordered the poached seafood salad, which was really delicious. The scallops were delicately cooked, the shrimp and calamari were just the right tenderness, and there wasn&#39;t too strong of a fishy flavor, which I was a fan of.

However, as previously mentioned, the service was generally very inattentive and just not very friendly. The waitresses barely paid attention to us all night, which was curious, because we wanted to order more food/drink, but we simply didn&#39;t have the opportunity. The people sitting at the bar seemed to be having a really good time, and perhaps that&#39;s the place to be, but nonetheless, it doesn&#39;t excuse the poor service at the tables. After a while of waiting around and unsuccessfully waving the staff down, we decided to just go elsewhere for dinner, and it was the right decision. Prices beyond the $1 oysters are generally pretty expensive, and it&#39;s hard to find the value. When beers start at $8, that ain&#39;t a great sign.

I likely won&#39;t be back. Despite the quality food, there are just too many other good places with oyster happy hours AND good service."

The good: the place itself is nice. Fortunately not crowded on a Thursday evening. I had the French cocktail which was delicious. Ordered oysters and a beet salad.

The meh: I asked the bar tender about cocktails and he was not great about answering my simple question. Is the French sweet? The answer is no but i didn&#39;t get that from him. Essentially, he says: &#34;Some are, some aren&#39;t, some have a fine balance.&#34; Okaaaay.

I ordered food and waited for a friend. Oysters came quickly. As I&#39;m waiting, bartender decides to chip ice for other drinks and its flying all around me. I shrug back and he notices a bit too late. No apology. Whatever.

Oysters gone, friend arrives. My beet salad doesn&#39;t arrive. He ignores my newly arrived friend for a bit. She orders drink. My salad comes 25 minutes later.
(It&#39;s good btw). Friend orders fries. 30 minutes later she asks where they are. Bartender replies that oh there&#39;s wifi issues. 
Uh..then why not walk the order over to the kitchen!?! Why not say something??

I order a pisco sour (not as good as the French).

We finish and ask for the bill. Bill comes to $85ish and we ask to split it 50-50.

We get our cards back and we notice he charged us $96ish. And the itemized receipt isn&#39;t there. We ask him about it, he checks, gets flustered and then just says to give him no tip. Wth? Works In our favor but seriously!?!

Quick recap: decent drinks and food, albeit $$. Service seriously meh. Waiter wasn&#39;t bad on the eyes but lack of talent a huge turnoff."

Nothing wrong with that, and actually it&#39;s still pretty much what I exclusively come here for. The place even though its been open for about 3 years now, it still feels like a soft opening at all times. It&#39;s always full and lively, but doesn&#39;t get over crowded, ungodly loud, and hasn&#39;t lost it&#39;s romantic mystique. 

The cocktails are really delicious and carefully crafted. The Fresh Widow, La Piscine, and French 75 are all winners. Then on top of everything else, this place as an amazing $1 oyster special every day 5-7PM. It&#39;s incredible that it&#39;s even on Saturday and Sunday as well. And, it&#39;s not on a certain oyster, ALL oysters on the menu are all offered for a $1. You can&#39;t beat that! I&#39;ve been there and they&#39;ve had 8-10 varieties on the menu which is awesome and generous to offer a special on so many. Typically $1 oysters will be on 1-2 varieties only, so this is special. 

I love going here. It&#39;s always a win and everyone who comes always walks away impressed as well.

After a few months, I began to notice a name, and did a quick search.  I&#39;m so glad I looked this place up, and finally gave it a try after so long!  

The happy hour is the best!  The happy hour runs from 5pm-7pm on Monday to Thursday and 4pm-7pm on Friday to Sunday.  Happy hour every day of the week is a big plus.  Their happy hour menu is infamous for their $1 oysters!  They have a variety, which is top quality.  Their variety constantly change, so you will get a sample.  As of March 1, 2016, the oysters are: Cornell, Ichabod Flat (Large), Fin De La Baie, Olde Salt (Large), Bareat, and Rappahannock (Large).  I can&#39;t say I&#39;m a connoisseur of oysters, but I can tell you they were all fresh and delicious.  Pick the large ones!  They also have clams, shrimp cocktail, and lobster!

We ordered two rounds of oysters, the brussel sprouts and the fries. Everything was delicious! I ordered their white rose drink and it was very smooth. The waiter was great and we loved everything about the experience.

I came here on a rainy thursday for some $1 oysters and I had the best experience! Not only do they have a wide selection of east coast and west coast oysters, but the best part is they are only $1. It is a small place and does get busy for happy hour. We were on the early side of happy hour so we got a seat at the bar no problem and the bartender was awesome! He was very knowledgeable on the different kinds of oysters and made some great recommendations. The oysters were fresh and presented on large platters of ice. Amazing! We also got the Brussel sprouts which were absolutely delish!

My fav part though was the drinks here! The place has a great 1920s feel to it and the drinks go along with that era. I ordered a champagne drink with a lavendar ice block that was absolutely amazing! 

I also loved the fact that they never made us feel rushed even though the place was fully packed by the time we were ready to leave.

I would describe the interior as kind of an &#34;upscale grungy&#34; with cute string lights over an exposed brick wall. They have an oyster happy hour from 5-7pm. We arrived right around 6:50 for our 7p reservation and they were kind enough to let us squeeze in an order for the oysters under the happy hour price ($1 a pop for the entire oyster menu). Oysters are definitely stellar and I would recommend the happy hour to anyone. 

It gets pretty packed and loud, and the space is really not big to begin with. I&#39;m docking a star for the organization/seating. Seating is cramped - they really crammed the tables and chairs in. If you order oysters and also drinks and also tapas, then you really run out of room on your table and the end result is a claustrophobic mess. Service seemed like a mess - it seemed like we had been assigned two waitstaff who did not communicate with each other because they both would take our order and then confusion would ensue. 

Overall, the drinks are absolutely fantastic. I think this place deserves five stars if it was only the drinks. We sampled quite a few of them and I can say they are all good. Oysters are a great deal, try to catch the happy hour. Tapas are soso and I think they&#39;re overpriced for what you get. 

Great, cute venue. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s great for a friends night out since it&#39;s just so crammed, but this has the ambiance and coziness of an awesome first date spot."

My friends and I stopped by around 10pm on a weeknight.  It&#39;s a little out of the way from the main LES area but lucky for us, they had tables available for our large group.  I really appreciated how they kept their music at a level where we can talk to our immediate neighbors without having to scream.  I would have preferred that it was kept at an even lower volume but compared to other bars, this was nice.  The decor is also unique, with an industrial and rustic ambience reminiscent of France in the early 20th century.  Their bathrooms are clean but the faucet in their sink are a little too close to the edge and prone to splashing water out of the sink bowl. 

Cocktails are $13-14, typical NYC prices.  I had their French 27 cocktail, which had a spicy kick to it and after acquiring a taste to it, fairly easy to drink.  One of my friends had their whiskey cocktails and it too was watered down compared to other cocktail bars.

Service was absent most of the time.  They require a credit card to be kept on hold for late nights, which is reasonable but they forget to return the card.  I had to go up to the bar to ask twice!  

Maybe they provide better service and stronger drinks at Happy Hour?"

She said she &#34;CANT SIT US INSIDE&#34; and when i asked how long the wait would be for the outside seating...she said it would be at least an hour wait. At that point i already had the feeling she didn&#39;t want us there, so we decided to leave.

It wasn&#39;t too loud and the low lighting and candlelight were perfect. The windows are so that you can&#39;t see outside and others can&#39;t see in, which gave it an intimate feeling. The bar itself is pretty long, and I really liked the minimalist feel. Pretty cozy without being suffocating. 

The tables are small and intimate, with one side of seating being banquette style. They can be pushed together for groups though. There is also a small room off the main room that has 3 or 4 small tables next to the kitchen, but that area is bright and has a totally different vibe. It&#39;s also on the way to the bathroom. (Also, the bathrooms were clean and there were 3 of them!)

My friend and I each ordered a cocktail and split the fries. She got the Hunter and I got the French 27. Her&#39;s was spicy and mine was sweet without being too sweet. They were both strong and yummy! The service was also great. As soon as I sat down, the hostess came over to pour my water, and someone else came to check on us.

The staff was super friendly and very helpful.

So seeing the weathered walls, reminiscent of an abandoned lot/construction site, was just plain cool. I find that a lot of eateries/bars go for the &#34;industrial chic&#34; look nowadays, but this is just straight up industrial. 

Sel Rrose is known as much for its cocktails as it is for its oysters/other elevated plates, so we clearly needed to dabble in that. My favorite was the rye/egg white creation. Can&#39;t remember the name, but it was some sort of infused rye - they do their infusions in-house which I always appreciate - some other lovely things, and perfectly frothy egg white sprinkled with nutmeg/something else in that family. It was beautifully balanced - the rye was used tactfully to create a subtle spice while still keeping the overall flavor sweet. Superb. I also tried the &#34;Le Moult&#34;, which is, I believe, their take on an Old Fashioned. In it, a list of ingredients that are completely alien to me: whiskey, combier l&#39;orange, lemon, bonal gentiane-quina, pastis. This has a syrupy-sweet essence to it, but not overpowering - still boozy and wonderful for a winter drink. Finally, I tried the &#34;French&#34; (thyme-infused rum, mesquite-honey syrup, lime, sparkling), which was decent but didn&#39;t wow me like the other two. I was dead set on trying one of the infused liquors despite not being a huge fan of rum. The rum didn&#39;t actually bother me, but I felt like the ratios in this drink were off. Too much sparkling, perhaps? Given the robust first two, this drink just tasted like watered down rum, in comparison. Overall, solid 4 stars for the cocktail program here.

Now for the food. As I mentioned, it was up-and-down. Some pleasant surprises and one big disappointment. Hence the 3.5. 

Oysters: A/A+
I&#39;m not well-versed in oysters. But given that Sel Rrose is known for its oyster selection, my lovely dining companion and I decided to try two types. I choose my dining company wisely - those that run with me gotta eat like me. Cocktail lover? Check. Seafood lover? Double check (yes, Aaron Rodgers, I went there). Sadly, I cannot report what these two types were. One was briny deliciousness. The other was a bit more mild but still yummy. So like past reviewers, would highly recommend opting for oysters, regardless of whatever else you&#39;re thinking of ordering.

Curried Baby Carrots: B+
Nothing really to say here. Simple. Tasty for what they were. Cleaned the plate without much thought. Basically healthy fries. 

Mozzarella, Mushrooms, Basil, Balsamic, Truffle Oil: A.
How wrong could you possibly go with this list of ingredients? Anytime I see truffle oil on the menu, it&#39;s a no-brainer. This dish was a perfect starter - light, fresh and surprisingly flavorful. Mushrooms, in my experience, aren&#39;t too complex in terms of preparation. You can&#39;t go wrong with balsamic and truffle oil. Mushrooms (cooked, not raw, for whatever reason) are one of my favorite foods. These were incredibly flavorful and rich, so paired beautiful with the light/fluffy mozzarella. Yum!

Mussels (served w/ coconut milk, kaffir leaf, chili, basil): B-
Sad to say that the mussels were the low point of the evening. I adore mussels. I grew up eating the absolute freshest mussels you can find at a seafood shack in Menemsha, MV. I&#39;ve been eating these mussels since I was about 2, so you could say I&#39;m a bit of a mussels snob. So if I&#39;m not impressed with mussels, I&#39;m really not impressed. These just fell so short for me. The flavors were off and the broth - often prime for bread-dipping - was just meh. I wanted my experience to be different from past reviewers, but unfortunately I&#39;m going to confirm the suspicion here - despite being a bigger fan of mussels than oysters, given the choice at Sel Rrose, opt for the latter.

Short Rib (served w/ baby carrots, potato puree, bone marrow): A
I&#39;m not a big red meat eater (so I very rarely eat steak), but this plate saved the meal for me. The short rib was straight up delicious. I just wish we had gotten more of it (my company agreed). You get to small/medium-sized hunks of meat, and that&#39;s it. &#34;Potato puree&#34;, as one could probably guess, is a comically refined way of saying &#34;mashed potatoes&#34;. This dish was brilliant in its simplicity. And unlike the mussels, this broth *was* prime for bread-dipping. Phew.

Note: Around 10pm, it got LOUD. Guessing it becomes more of a bar than anything else at that point, given the LES location. So if you value hearing yourself talk/think, not the best place to be at that given time."

Yes, Mermaid Inn also has $1 oysters, but you don&#39;t get to choose what kind. Here it&#39;s $1, AND you can pick whatever oyster that&#39;s on the menu. We got oysters, steamed mussels, deviled eggs, and couple of cocktails. Oysters were top quality, mussels were fresh and the broth was amazingly delicious (yes I drank the broth a little), deviled eggs were not the cheapest, but they were topped with caviar. On the other hand, no drinks are on happy hour. But they do have some very unique cocktails. 

My only complaint is that some waiter put other people&#39;s orders on our bill AFTER  we already closed out and gave them the credit card, that&#39;s some mistake that has never happened to me before at any other restaurants. On top of that, the table next to us were missing 8 oysters while the bill came and showed they had more. I don&#39;t think this place just opened?! But maybe spend a little more time training the employees would be a good idea still given the rookie mistakes they kept making."

Quality was good - meaty oysters and they shuck them well, no shells in your mouth after a big slurp. Rounding down to 4 stars bc there was no umph in that place and I don&#39;t see it worth going to if you&#39;re not into the oyster happy hour (generally pricey for what they serve, but you are in the LES)

-1 star because we came at an awkward time (~4pm, Saturday) when no one else was there but it took ages for us to get water or other small dishes that we ordered like cheese/eggplant/brusselsprouts - all of which were really good

We were a group of 10 people ordering probably at least 100 oysters and they didn&#39;t seem to hate us about shucking all those. They also didn&#39;t rush us out and were very polite"

The bar was pretty spacious, and actually pretty empty when we went since it was new years day, which was awesome. They have bar seats, and a bunch of tables since they serve food as well.

The bartenders were great and served up the drinks rather quickly; we each got a cocktail (all of the ingredients they use sound delicious!):

The Fountain $14 (Gin, lemon, grapefruit, pink peppercorn syrup, hopped grapefruit bitters) - slightly on the sweet side, but pretty interesting with the pink peppercorn.

French 27 $13 (Thyme-infused rum, mesquite-honey syrup, lime, champagne) - I loved how this had a sprig of thyme in it! This was just the right type of sweet - enough to cover the fact that this was a pretty strong cocktail ;)

All drinks are pretty standard NYC cocktail prices ($13~$15). Great date spot with fantastic ambiance. I need to come back during happy hour to get their $1 oysters!!!"

Decor was very rustic. It looked like it was kind of run down but it has the rustic feel with the bare bricks and all.

PROS:

- $1 Happy Hour Oysters 5-7pm (so many options to choose from)
- My favorite oysters are: WILEY POINT PETIT (small and sweet) and BONITAS (very meaty and juicy).
- Moonstone, Rappahannock,Fanny Bay, and Cook&#39;s Cocktail oysters were good too.
- SEAFOOD CEVICHE - really good. Love the mango pieces and the seafood was fresh.
- LAVENDAR PISCINE drink was pretty good. It was the best one I tried the whole night. Light Alcohol content but lavender scent and flavor was prominent in the drink.
- FRIES - we were so hungry waiting for the food that we just attacked the fries. The fries were pretty good. Great appetizer to share among 5 girls.

THE OKAY:

- Mussels were alright. Nothing special. The oysters are much better.

CONS:

- FRENCH 27 (thyme infused rum, mesquite honey syrup, lime, champagne) - had a heavy spicy kick, this was definitely not my drink. 
- FRESH WIDOW (creole spiced rye, coconut syrup, pineapple, lime) - tasted similar to French 27 but it was watered down or a lighter version of it with coconut syrup. It had a spicy kick to it with a hint of soapy coconut creaminess. I didn&#39;t like it. I couldn&#39;t taste any hint of pineapple or lime in this. It was mostly spiced rye and coconut syrup.

- Bathroom: one of the bathroom sinks do not have cold water. It only has piping hot water for you to wash your hand and it almost burned me. Beware of the furthest bathroom stall in the back. It actually looks kind of freaky in there too with a big pipe sticking out."

St Simon, well fleet and island creek were amongst our fave east coast selections. All the west coast oysters were meaty with clean finish. I usually don&#39;t like West coast oysters due to the salinity and creaminess but these weren&#39;t salty but very fresh and clean! $1 oyster happy hour is a definite must go here if you love frequenting the city&#39;s oyster bars. This might replace my old favorite at Mermaid Inn! 

Perfect place for a date or catching up with your besties. A must go for oyster lovers. 

We also had their fresh cut fries with herb butter. The butter was amazing. It&#39;s also served with traditional ketchup. 

Pork belly with mash purée and Brussels sprouts - the mash was so smooth and Brussel sprouts were super flavorful. Even thought we were so full, we still wanted to inhale the pork belly. It was tender and not dry at all!

Chicken liver mousse - we order this every time we see it in the menu. Loved the creaminess to it. It was a tad salty and they only serves it with 3 pieces of bread. We had to ask for more bread

Service was excellent. Waiters were att drive but not overbearing. Definitely planning to visit again!"

I loved the onion sauce thing (?) that came with it. We also tried the fries and the crab dip. All SO good. The fries are crispy and the portion size is great. Goes great with herb mayo that comes with it. I loved it with the oysters together.
The crab dip is creamy and gooey and hot. Comes with bagel chips - you&#39;d think there isn&#39;t enough bagel chips but we actually had one left over after finishing the dip. You can just spoon it and eat it. 

For cocktails, we tried the lavender piscine, belle haleine, and vie en rrose. They ALL taste better after you let it sit for a bit. The lavender piscine doesn&#39;t taste like lavender until you let a significant amount of the lavender ice melt. The vie en rrose gets a sweet grape taste if you let it sit for a bit too. The belle haleine smells like orange zest and it was the strongest.

Sel Rrose definitely does a good one. All of their oysters are $1 each during happy hour M-F 5-7pm! 

Be mindful of this because they do not actually tell you that and will simply hand you their oyster list with regular prices listed. Don&#39;t worry, they just use the same menu during happy hour!

The place is very cute and has a sort of rustic look to it. Our server was a little manic, continually asking us if we were ready to order once every minute (she might have taken our &#34;we need a minute&#34; response literally). We ordered a dozen oysters from the list and cocktails. They have an awesome cocktail menu (no happy hour for that)! I had a Lavender Piscine, which smelled amazing and tasted great. It came with a giant cube of &#34;lavender ice&#34;. 

The cocktails were so enjoyable, we didn&#39;t even realize how long it was taking for our oysters until the server came over, apologizing that our order had gone to another table. Shortly after, a platter of oysters arrived, that had two dozen plus a couple more instead of just the dozen we ordered. The server apologized again for the delay.

So it&#39;s only natural that I also love oyster happy hours, right? Well, you&#39;d be correct. Sel Rrose does a wonderful oyster happy hour. They had a great selection of oysters at $1 apiece (they use the same menu at happy hour, so prices may seem more but don&#39;t be alarmed!).

Anyway, came in a bit early on a Friday, so it was easy to get a table. As the night went on, it did get a bit more crowded (there were some reserved tables as well). Our hostess was a bit standoffish, and seemed really eager. She asked us if we were ready to order drinks 3 times in 3 minutes.

Speaking of drinks, they have a wonderfully inventive cocktail menu. There was a champagne one with a gigantic lavender ice cube that slowly dissipated more floral goodness as it melted (the Lavender Piscine). I had the French 27, which had thyme-infused rum, champagne, and honey; it was super refreshing. Also tried the Maison de Verre (because I like drinking to excess); that one was a fizz with cognac and herbs. I think I liked that one the best.

Anyway, onto the oysters. They had about 10 choices on the menu, which is wonderful. We ordered three types - Wellfleets from MA, Skookums from WA, and Salvation Coves from PEI.

Our order took a bit of time, and we noticed other people getting theirs before us. But it wasn&#39;t really that much of an issue since we were enjoying cocktails. Then one of the waiters/shuckers walked over and told us he was very sorry, but our oysters went to another table. It was totally fine. 5 minutes later, we had a platter with twice as many oysters as we ordered, as they threw in a couple of extra for the inconvenience. I think they were the Beausoleil from New Brunswick. We were taken aback, but also incredibly grateful.

As for the oysters themselves, the PEIs and the Wellfleets were my favorite. Very clean and smooth.

Would definitely come back for happy hour. They also serve food, but their entree selection is pretty limited (a burger, and like 3 seafood dishes).

There&#39;s also a tiny semi-private dining area in the back, which looks super cozy.

The cocktails were fantastic and all individual works of art. Oysters were $1 each, and we loved our first dozen so much that we ordered a second dozen of the same varieties (they let you choose from several different kinds that are sourced from varying places).

Came here with a large group of friends to celebrate after passing the bar. It was a great choice, as I was craving raw oysters for the longest time. They have a variety of raw oysters for $1 each from various parts of the coastal region. Apparently, the oysters taste different from state-to-state, but they all tasted the same to me when drowned in Tabasco.  

I ordered a plate of 20 raw oysters for myself, which came out right away. It was served on top of a bed of ice, and came with a few dipping sauces. I preferred the sour/vinegar based dip, along with Tabasco. The oysters were very fresh (i.e., no fishy smell), did not have any sand or dirt, and best of all - it did not give me the runs after. 

This place is also known for a lavender wine drink, which I ordered with my oysters. Both were excellent.  Overall, I was very pleased with the food and service, and I&#39;ll definitely be revisiting them in the near future.  This will be my new go-to place for raw oysters."

It&#39;s not hard to find in these parts but I opted for Sel Rrose because I was in the mood to wash down my oysters (not that oysters need help in this area) with a well-crafted cocktail.

Sel Rrose isn&#39;t well-marked, and it looks a bit dilapidated, with its chipped and discolored walls inside and out. However, it&#39;s very much intentional and in tune with the rustic, French decor I assume they&#39;re going for. The place was decently busy on a Monday evening while still having plenty of bar and table seating.

But enough of that. On to the oysters. You&#39;re given a card that lists 10 different types of oysters available during happy hour and a pencil for you to write down how many of each you want to order.* Being there with two others, we thought it best to order 3 of each (30 total). It was a fun little oyster tasting that went by far too quickly despite trying to take periodic breaks. We tried our best to distinguish different tastes and textures, but I think all I learned was I in fact do have a &#34;briny&#34; threshold. You can definitely taste the differences though, and it was a delicious experience with fresh, juicy, oceany treats that I would come back for.

As for cocktails, I ordered the Belle Haleine and was very happy with my decision. I was looking for something that wasn&#39;t very sweet with a nice blend of different, subtle flavors, and it delivered. The touch of salted vanilla bean syrup really rounded out the drink. My friends ordered the Lavender Piscine, which is very pretty drink. At first, the drink tasted mainly of champagne, but after the lavender ice slowly melted away, they said it got a lot more flavorful and complex.

*Note: The last oysters on the HH list, which I believe is the Little Neck Clam, is actually $1.67 each or something. I think I also saw a note about there being a limit to how many oysters you can order per person if you&#39;re with a party of 6 or larger but I don&#39;t remember exactly."

The cocktails are always interesting and strong.  They will run you around $13/14, but have quite a bit of bang! 

I love the décor here - a sort of purposefully antiqued look, that is, the walls look like they are water-damaged, the mirrors have these old spots, and the sinks in the bathrooms are made from these heavy rusted iron vats. I find it pretty chic and casual.

They also set out tables outside in the warmer months, though I&#39;m not a fan of sitting by the Bowery traffic.

Could be five stars if they just hired more staff.  Poor waitress gets overwhelmed all by herself with everyone gobbling dollar oysters all ordered 1 minute to 7p (guilty!)."

Five Stars

It was completely empty when we arrived. I ordered the Fresh Widow which had a nice blend of Creole Spiced Rye, Cocnut Syrup, Pineaaple and Lime served in a Highball with Crushed Ice. The bartender was friendly. The bar is cool with distressed wall and dim lighting. 

$1 Oysters for happy hour:
North Bay -
Skookums -
Salvation Cove -
Malpeque -
Daisy Bay -
Island Creek -
Welifleet -
Beausoliel -
Spiny Creek -
Barnstable -
Fanny Bay - 

The Barnstable, Island Creek, and Welifleet were all great and all from Massachusetts. They were buttery, not too salty, and slightly sweet. The oysters were well prepared- no grit, no sand, and none of the brine wasted."

* The decor at Sel Rrose reminds me of Detroit grunge + Prohibition: the walls are purposely left bare with old layers of paint which gives the place a mysterious and antiquated feel. There are tables perfect for large groups which fill up very quickly on weekends so it would be better to make reservations. 
* Recommend the Littleneck Clams, Crab Dib with Crispy Bread, Sel Rrose Burger, Goat Cheese Crostino, Fries, and Maine Lobster Roll. 
* Probably some of the friendliest staff in NYC. The service (especially from the hostesses) our group experienced on hectic and crazy Friday night was stellar. When our group of 11 came in without a reservation during busy hours, the hostess was so accommodating to fit half of us at a table and the rest by the bar nearby. When our friend brought a Momofuku birthday cake and asked if we could eat it at the table after our meal, they immediately put candles on it and provided plates and cutlery for us....all gratis! 

Cons:
* Mussels were hit or miss, some were fresh while others tasted funky. Would not order again."

It seems like many spots do the $1 deal, but only with Bluepoints or otherwise limited options. At Sel Rrose (still wondering about the story behind that extra r) you have TEN varieties, both east and west cost, to choose from. Obviously we all had to try one of each, and we enjoyed tasting the differences. There were salty oysters, meaty oysters, mild ones, and one extremely briny one that I&#39;ve realized, after conducting further research, was probably from Maine.

I also tried the famed Lavender Piscine, a drink with champagne, a big lavender-flavored ice cube, herbes de Provence syrup and grapefruit bitters. The drink was eventually great, but as another reviewer mentioned, it really only tasted like champagne at first. Once I let the ice cubes melt and the flavors meld together, it was much more delicious. They should mention that on the menu. I&#39;ll say that the drink seemed a tad pricey at $14, but the wallet hit was offset by the oyster savings.

The service seemed a bit disinterested, a bit languid, but no matter. This is the type of place that causes monthly oyster clubs to form (happened to us!)."

I tried the special that evening, which was a soft shell crab sandwich - the dish could have used a slice of lemon and maybe a bit more sauce to cut through the crisp dryness, but otherwise the flavor was on point too.

He said &#34;you need all of that?&#34; with unhappy tone while looking at us getting 5 small containers of the sauce. So we said &#34;yeah! Cause these are for 5 people&#34; and my friend added &#34;and we have 5 orders.&#34; He didn&#39;t say much after and just walked away.
I understand everybody is tired, it was Friday everyone can&#39;t wait to go home but come on it&#39;s not like we are pouring out the whole bottle of that special sauce of yours. Honestly I was gonna give 4 stars cause the place is actually cute even though the food wasn&#39;t the greatest but with that kind of attitude!? Yeaa.. no!"

But sometimes you find something that does the trick like El Luchador.

They sure do look the part -- an awesome airstream trailer with a neon sign that emblazoned with &#34;TACOS&#34; outside, luchador decor, and a small selection of burritos and tacos a stone&#39;s throw from the waterfront. Lots of familiar meats (carnitas, pollo asado, carne asada) and a homey feel make this little sliver of a taco shop about as authentic as you&#39;re going to get on the South Street Seaport. 

The employees were very friendly, and after some confusion over which meats they had available, they were nice enough to give me a second taco on the house. Good customer service will keep me coming back time and time again."

The place was definitely really cute, from the interior to the exterior. They have a few tables not that many and a bus that you can also dine in.

The had some pretty good options... i got pollo asado taco and my boyfriend got a steak quesadilla. I&#39;m a big foodie and for a mexican place that serves these dishes, it really lacked flavor. It wasn&#39;t bad, it just wasn&#39;t tasty. Maybe the chef had a bad day, but i always give second chances when it comes to food.

ANY place that makes/serves a &#34;Burrito&#34; is not Authentic.  There is no such thing as a Burrito in Mexico, unless you&#39;re talking about a small or baby donkey.  Sorry, just needed to clear the air there.


As far as my review, I think El Luchador is pretty good, but not necessarily great for the price.  

We Ordered:

- Chips &amp; Guacamole- pretty good, but standard and they definitely skimp on the amount of Guac they give you.  And the chips are not homemade, but packaged.

- Short Rib Taco- was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.

- Carnitas (Pork) Taco- once again, pretty good, but nothing amazing.  I actually prefer the carnitas at Dos Toros a few blocks away better.

- Quesadilla with Carne Asada- ok, but would have preferred if they used a corn tortilla, but then again, this place isn&#39;t authentic.  Was similar to Mad Dog &amp; Beans on Stone Street, fairly Americanized.

- Side of Black Beans- pretty standard.


The Ambiance of the place is the best part, and although sitting in the old school Airstream Travel Trailer is a little kitschy, it&#39;s also kind of fun and makes you feel like a kid again.

All that being said, I&#39;d still pass on this place and just go to Dos Toros a few blocks away, as I think the overall quality is slightly better, the carnitas there is better for sure, they give you more guacamole, their chips are pretty good and it&#39;s cheaper as well.

Just my opinion, as I know some people really like this place.

And just as a side note...if you&#39;re looking for true, Authentic Mexican Tacos, then take a taxi/subway to Los Tacos No. 1 in Chelsea Market as those are the BEST TACOS in NYC.  No Burritos there, no way, only Vampiro&#39;s and homemade corn tortillas, made right in front of you."

You must get the cod fish taco and eat it fresh. The fish was so flakey and and crispy on the outside. I should&#39;ve ordered 2 of those. The short rib taco was very flavorful. I would recommend that as well. The meat on the pork taco was very tough. I would not order that next time. Wasn&#39;t thrilled about the veggie taco either.  I was disappointed on the corn. It was burnt on one side and we didn&#39;t notice it until near the end of our meal. We were too lazy to go back and ask for another one. They purposely flipped the corn so we didn&#39;t see the burnt side. For $4, I would expect them to make a new one and not serve a burnt corn to those customers. Kinda sneaky there. Watch out when you order guoc and chips. They charge $1 additional for chips. 

Overall, I think this place is a bit pricey for a self served spot."

The decor is awesome and it&#39;s right there by the seaport and the shopping area. But it took FOREVER to just order the food. Then it took an extra 30 minutes to get our food!

My coworkers and I wanted to try out El Luchador&#39;s food and bring it to the seaport area to enjoy the beautiful Spring day out. But it so long for us to get our food that we didn&#39;t have time to do that. We all rushed back to eat at our desks. I open my food container and am immediately disappointed at what my $20 paid for due to the small portion. I got a cup of Horchata and a Short Rib Burrito Bowl. Both were tasty but not very filling.

To make matters worse, my stomach was not in agreement with the food and I had to stay by a toilet for the next day and a half. Then two of my co-workers later told me that they were in the same situation.

The only issue is that it&#39;s so popular there&#39;s usually a pretty long wait and a fight for a table.

We ordered the carnitas tacos and chicken quesadilla -- loved both! -- along with guac &amp; chips.  My friend said the salsa was very good, but they happened to run out by the time we got there late Saturday afternoon.

I spotted this place with sweet bright light strands over a camper from a mile away on the corner of South while on an evening stroll by the seaport. It immediately reminded me that feeling you get on a laid back  summer night,on a lounge chair, chilling with a cold beer in your hand. Love that vibe. Could hang here for awhile. 

This place was exactly what we were looking for... fast, inexpensive, tasty, out of the norm and place to warm up on a chilly winter night. Done and done. And done right. 

The place itself has a cool story. The actual building where everything is cooked is a converted old horse stable. An official NYC landmark. The theme is tacos vs burritos and goes with the name which is the name for Mexican wrestlers. You can see their masked faces on the gates out front.  

There are a few seats at the window bar inside. Bistro tables and chairs outside for a nice night and a heated, vintage airstream painted a soothing turquoise inside with white 70&#39;s chic booth seating, worn, chipped painted wood tables and colorful Christmas light strands. This was my favorite part by far. So adorable and cozy! Fab idea! 

The food was all reasonably priced. I was torn between the veg burrito or the taco. And there goes the theme again! I went with the veggie taco (portobello, guac, pico, lettuce, cilantro) for $3.75. It&#39;s already vegan which I love as it doesn&#39;t come with cheese or sour cream and it was not missed at all. Some veg tacos are dry and need something, a sauce. These do not! Generous amounts of guac. Extra corn tortillas are free, just ask! I split the over flowing taco for my little one and myself to share with the extra tortilla I asked for. We loved them so much we went back for another even though it was really plenty of food. My daughter ordered the rice and beans side which had a nice hint of fresh squeezed lime. Yum! The table ordered the veggie nachos with queso, black beans, lettuce, pico and drizzled with sour cream. They were a very decent sized portion. Leftovers in fact. The shredded meat tacos are said to be out of this world but I personally couldn&#39;t tell you. I do know people rave about them. We got two Jarritos to split, mandarin and pineapple. They had all of the classic flavors and also sell a craft bottled beer! Oh, I almost forgot my hubby got the rice pudding with apricots and a hint of cinnamon. It was very cold and he loved it! 

Service was fairly quick and they were all definitely super sweet. We warmed up in the corner of the airstream and waited for them to call us when our food was ready. Cheery Mexican music played in the camper. We had a lot of fun dancing and enjoying the kitschiness. 

We would definitely eat here again while in the neighborhood. As we started to leave, the place filled up quickly and as I have read that&#39;s the norm so get there before &#34;normal&#34; lunch or dinner time. We ate dinner around 5:25pm on a Tuesday. Duh, Taco Tuesday!. 

My only gripe was the no restroom thing. Definitely an inconvenience with little ones in tow. I just don&#39;t get serving food, even drinks, especially beer and not having one. Hmm. They directed us across the way. I believe there are normally public restrooms under the bridge. Perhaps they were closed because of the blizzard. The restaurant across the street let us use theirs, thankfully."

We went to El Luchador on a Wednesday night evening.  Although the place was busy and seating was scarce, the food came out quickly after we ordered (much to my surprise after reading many of the reviews on here).  They were also able to alter our order as I don&#39;t eat onions.

We ended up with three tacos - short rib, carnitas, and vegetable; guacamole; and a chicken burrito.  

I was pleasantly surprised by the guac.  Although it came in a small plastic container, it seemed very fresh.  

The short rib taco was my favorite.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  The carnitas taco was also good, and had an interesting salsa on it.  I didn&#39;t love the veggie taco, which was 95% guac and lettuce with a few strips of portobello mushroom at the bottom.  

The burrito was great.  Whatever cheese they put in there was absolutely perfect.  

The dipping sauces were also good and were of various spice levels.  

I didn&#39;t love the seating area.  We tried to first sit in the little RV vehicle but it was insanely hot in there and very loud.  Then we ended up outside, next to the garbage cans.  Honestly, it didn&#39;t bother us, but I can see why this place might not be perfect for your next date night.

Another plus for me is this place&#39;s proximity to bars and ice cream.  You can make &#34;a night&#34; out of going.  

Pricing was alright - the total bill came to around $25 for 2 people.  

All in all, a good experience.  We will probably be back to try some of the other things on the menu.  If you don&#39;t expect gourmet dining and white tablecloths, you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Absolutely gorgeous.
I am usually not a big fan of Mexican food- too spicy for me. I had a short rib taco and one of those highlighter- colored sodas. It was pretty good ( not that I have any experience with Mexican food, but I really liked it).

The short ribs is alright - the meat itself is good, but the taco is pretty plain.

Also got the Mexican corn and the corn itself is sweet. BUT THEY DONT GIVE YOU ANY SKEWERS FOR IT. Did you WANT me to manhandle the corn in public? Also, I wish it were grilled a bit more, there was barely any of the smoky flavor. The cotja cheese and mayo are standard, but I still like Cafe Habana&#39;s better.

You can sit in the trailer, but there&#39;s nothing special once inside. The music is actually obnoxiously loud, so I&#39;d actually advise to sit away.

The chips are OK, but I felt like I was more full on chips than the burrito post meal, and I even ended up tossing around half the chips.

Sorry. Let&#39;s shoot.

I have very little experience with dining in New York, specifically in the city&#39;s Mexican restaurants or taquerias. Be that as it may, I was really impressed by El Luchador. This is a fairly simple operation, serving burritos, tacos, quesadillas, and a few sides. I ordered the tacos, two short ribs and a carne asada. While both were very good, the short rib was the clear winner. The meat was surprisingly tender and topped with pickled onions and cilantro. There was a nice rich sauce that coated the short rib and offered an additional depth of flavor. I regret not trying any of the sides, because the grilled Mexican corn sounded really awesome. I washed everything down with a pineapple soda and everything was good in the world. Seating is limited and will become increasingly so as the weather turns cold. The staff was very friendly and moved efficiently. Overall, I was quite happy with my experience."

Get one kind of each taco. No, not because they&#39;re all amazing (as they are) or because you&#39;re not going to be able to decide what kind of delicious meat to shove in your mouth (heeeeey-o) but because. Guys. They make each taco to fill up the box. 3 tacos, 1 box; 2 tacos, 1 box; 1 taco, 1 box. If you just get one taco, you are blessed with a quantity of meat beyond the heavens raining men. And hallelujah. 

Other notes: The line can definitely get long at lunch, so plan ahead for this, and their outside seating is minimal if adorable. They STILL don&#39;t have their horchata guy back, but they&#39;ve got plenty of Jarritos. If you&#39;re getting take out, be sure to pick up some of the sauces -- they&#39;re sometimes (but not always) pre-dressed.

It&#39;s a shame because this place is closer to me but it&#39;s apparent they don&#39;t mind losing someones business"

- They forgot our order, so we had to wait about 20 extra minutes. BUT they comped us two drinks!
- Out of short ribs, which a lot of people were upset about.

The tacos here are out of this world. The beer-battered cod was my favorite, but the skirt steak was great as well! If you&#39;re super hungry, the carnitas burrito is the way to go. The carnitas were moist and the burrito was bigger than Chipotle&#39;s.

I actually thought it was a food truck at first glance since they have that airstream trailer outside, but you can actually eat inside of the airstream. There are a few stools inside and outdoor tables as well, but it gets packed."

Right across the street from South Street Seaport, with the most adorable little outdoor seating. It&#39;s like a slice of Cali or Tijuana.

Carnitas (roast pork) was nice and juicy, no dried out hard parts. Asked for double tortillas which they give for free. Avocado salsa didn&#39;t scream avocado - but it&#39;s tasty whatever it is. Thumbs down to the poorly tended extra dressings area it&#39;s too cramped, fill the little sauce cups with covers and offer them with each meal instead of leaving it out for us and our messy selves! By the way green sauce is a nice spicy surprise. Thumbs up for service quick and polite. You can see the cooks and the kitchen everything seems clean and well run.

A warning to vegetarians like myself - there&#39;s some meat in things where you wouldn&#39;t expect it- like the jalapeno poppers. Ask clarifying questions.

They have a very respectable whiskey/bourbon/Scotch selection, all for very reasonable prices. Laphroaig was $12 and Blanton&#39;s was $13. I&#39;ve definitely paid more for both.

The backyard is pretty huge. It&#39;s nicer than 4th Ave Pub and is a lot more open. Great place to be during the spring or summer months.

Sad that it took so long to get my ass over here, but I&#39;ll definitely be returning!"

The kitchen was closed but they served us some of the best guacamole I&#39;ve had in a long time. The bartender gave us some recommendations for dinner while we were in town, including Rucola, which was as promised, AMAZING. Drinks were excellent, as was the conversation. Diverse and friendly crowd. We came back the next night to another set of staff that was equally personable. Thanks for making strangers feel welcome. We&#39;ll be back."

With that being said after a leave a not so good review and the manager or owner of an establishment reaches out to me to rectify the situation I appreciate that. Once that happens I give the establishment the benefit of the doubt and not hold them solely responsible for when their staff may be having a not so good day. This particular owner reached out to me immediately after my experience with his establishment and even gave me his personal cell number. How&#39;s that for excellent customer service? I may or may not be in Brooklyn any time soon because I was a tourist during this visit but if I am I&#39;ll definitely reach out to him and give his establishment another try.

You&#39;ll find Kentucky bourbons like Bulleit, Knobs Creek, &amp; Widows Jane. They also make cocktails like the Brooklyn Sour, the Manhattan, &amp; an Old Fashion. Also, the craft beers on tap rotate frequently &amp; sometimes feature local favorites like Sixpoint. 

The Bacon Burger with Monterey Jack cheese was not amazing but it was good &amp; it hit the spot. If you prefer something lighter, try the flavorful Guacamole &amp; Chips. The kitchen is open late on most nights &amp; depending on where you sit, you may have to place your food/drink order at the bar. 

Hollow Nickel&#39;s back room has intimate booths with candle light setting, perfect for dates or just catching up with friends. On nice days, they open up their beautiful backyard, which is landscaped &amp; romantically lit at night. FYI: This bar is known as an After-Party spot for Barclays events so there may be a longer wait than usual."

Coming here, I thought it was going to be like a typical restaurant, with a waiter/waitress taking you to your seat and coming to your table every 20 minutes refilling water and asking if your food was good. Instead, this place ended up being the most relaxing and freeing place to dine and drink.

When we went into the restaurant, the bartender simply told us to sit anywhere and handed us the menu. We had to go up to the bar, just to order our food and drinks, which was I found surprising.

We ordered nachos, burgers and french toast which all fell in the range of $11-20. The portion of the burger was pretty big with a side of fries. The nachos were one of the best nachos I have ever had, as it came with a container of guacamole, and salsa, which all had a hint of spice to it which gave it a kick of flavor. I particularly loved the french toast I ordered, as it was topped with berries and a side of maple syrup. The french toast was very rich in flavor and had the perfect texture, not too mushy in the middle and not burnt on the outside.

If you are someone who is particularly into fruity drinks, I&#39;d recommend getting the white peach sangria; it has a small kick of alcohol that kind of hit me a bit, but with an overall fruity taste. 

Food: delicious, portion is worth the money
Atmosphere: very relaxed, color scheme of black and red (which I love)
Service: majority of the time self-service, I had to repeat a few times my order of french toast since he did not hear me.

If you are in the area of Barclay Center after watching a game or concert, I would recommend this place as it is spacious and not as crowded as other places in Brooklyn. One more perk, is that there is a beautiful outdoor setting to hang out or go for on a casual date."

Or as hollow as my views on society. On the contrary however, it&#39;s packed. With lots of awesome things like, swell drinks, good people, delicious food, and chairs. Got to love chairs.

I&#39;d been meaning to stop by the Hollow Nickel for awhile but never got around to doing it. Always something came up. I had plans, or an emergency came our of no where, or the feds were onto my illegal wild animal trafficking. Typical things that pop up.

In the past month or so I&#39;ve been there for a few times. in particular for some happy hours. They were quite happy so there was no false advertising. 

$1 off all tap beers. As well as deals on well drinks. They also have a deal going around all the time. $6 beer and shot combo. It&#39;s a Narragansett tall boy, so while it&#39;s not my favorite beer it is a 16oz, and Evan Williams is pretty darn good for a well shot. If you like suffering and hate yourself you can get the deal with a Corona and a well shot of tequila instead. There&#39;s also a margarita special, you may want to inquire about. 

My favorite thing about the place is the food. I don&#39;t care for Jalapeno Poppers, but these are not ordinary poppers. They&#39;re almost more like fritters. Tasty tasty fritters. I also love their guac, fried pickles, and fries. And I don&#39;t normally like overly seasoned fries either, but once again this place just knows how to do it real well. The dipping sauces are fantastic. They got chipolte mayo. Cucumber mayo. Mayo mayo. I like mayo!

There&#39;s lots of different seating, from a several stool tables in the front, a bar with a television, booths, tables in the back, and an outdoor area. Perfect for whatever size your party is. 

My one quarrel is the beer selection. It could be a bit more vast. And I don&#39;t think the price of the drafts are that great, but they&#39;re not awful either. I have to say their personal house brew is pretty good, and is only $5 bucks. They also make a solid Manhattan if you want to get all fancy. 

So if you find yourself strolling down Atlantic, this is a great option for a great time."

It&#39;s a casual place with a variety of beer options and comfort food choices. We enjoyed the massive burger and the sourdough grilled cheese, with the seasoned fries (so good!!) and the salad respectively.   All were well done and portions were very generous. Service was friendly but generally they encourage you to order at the bar as there is only one server that rotates around the restaurant and patio. Prices were very reasonable for the neighborhood. Great place for a bite before or after an event at Barclays (a couple blocks down from it along atlantic). Worth the visit!"

Judging from the reviews and pictures, we decided to give this place a try. 

Once we stepped in, it was CROWDED. The only available seats we saw were by the window and seated ourselves. There were shot glasses and glass cups everywhere. No one came around to cleaning them so we just pushed them aside. There was a huge blackboard with a mini menu and also a small paper menu floating around from table to table. 

Went to the bar and ordered the turkey toastie for myself &amp; the angus burger for my friend and drinks. Asked for a malibu bay breeze and blue hawaiian and the bartender that helped me said they don&#39;t carry malibu and I just settled for a cider. Waited on the blue hawaiian for a bit and she never came back with it. When I finally got her attention again, I asked her where was the blue hawaiian and her response was &#39;what&#39;s in that again?&#39; I&#39;m sorry, but how are you a bartender and not know what&#39;s in a blue hawaiian? When I told her she said they didn&#39;t carry blue curacao. 

Whoever she was, she must be new. I wish I got her name because she was clueless throughout the whole time I was there. I had to repeat my order to her twice and the order number twice. I told her I wanted the burger medium and it came out well done. The turkey toastie was your typical turkey sandwich drenched in butter. The fries that came with it were super salty. When we were finish, I went to close my tab and it took forever to get her attention. She looked over at me a couple of times and totally ignored me when I tried to wave her down and she decided to help others instead. Super annoyed, I just waved down another worker to close the tab for me. 

Overall, the worst experienced ever. The food was mediocre, the service was terrible, the selection was limited and it was disgusting inside. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place. You&#39;ll probably have a better experience at Applebee&#39;s inside Atlantic Terminal."

A lot of people have complained about the kitchen, but I didn&#39;t have a problem at all. I ordered a BLT and my boyfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla, and they both came out correctly and quickly. The drink specials can&#39;t be beat. I got a $5 margarita, which was quite strong, and my boyfriend got a Narragansett and a shot of well whiskey for $6.

I had the ommegang witte beer, which was really good and the wrap. The beer was $6 and the wrap with fries $10. Bill came to $16, taxes were already included I believe.

They have a nice beer selection and plenty of cocktail offerings to choose from.  Their happy hour is long but not exactly cheap.  I certainly took advantage of the $1 off drafts, but with beers being $6 - $7 to start, it didn&#39;t exactly blow my mind having $5/$6 drafts.  Happy hour to me should hover around the $4 mark for drafts - just my opinion.  

The food was really good though!  We tried the french fries, which were delicious, as well as the fried pickles (yum!) and guac/chips, which were tasty and plentiful for sharing.  The jalapeño poppers looked great, but I couldn&#39;t partake due to an allergy.

Grilled cheese is the perfect post beer meal.

- It&#39;s never crowded. Admittedly, I&#39;ve never gone on a Saturday night, but every time I go, it&#39;s practically empty which means I get a seat and good service and I can talk to my companions in peace. I&#39;m sure the owner would prefer it to be full all the time, but this is my perfect vibe right here.

- The drink selection. Not the craziest most obscure craft beers, but you can definitely get something better than Stella or Guinness. Plus they serve this one brand of cider I love that for some reason I can&#39;t really find anywhere else, so good on them. Prices are decent.

- Food. Pretty good for basic &#34;pub&#34; fare, especially their vegetarian options. Prices are fair.

- Happy hour on weekends. Self-explanatory.

- Killer backyard. Lots of seating, quiet, tons of shade, not swarming with mosquitoes. Like, I live 5 minutes away and have my own private yard, and still sometimes I&#39;m like, &#34;I wanna go hang out in Hollow Nickel&#39;s backyard.&#34;

- Service. Friendly, funny, quick, they remember us even though we&#39;re semi-regulars at best. I like these dudes a lot.

One star off because once my veggie burger was kinda dry and the margarita is really nothing to write home about. But really this is more like 4.5 stars, because I&#39;m THAT person on Yelp, and I really do like this place a lot."

Love the tin ceiling, booth seats and shelves with real books (yes, real!). There is also room on the back with more seatings and backyard, but it was reserved the night we were there, so I could not check it out. 

They have TV for all you sport fans!

Good beer selection. Food is simple, but pretty great. Fries were good, and BLT was very, very nicely put together - perfectly toasted bread, thick-cut bacon, fresh tomatoes - delish!!!

We stopped in around 9pm on a Friday looking for a low-key night and a casual bite. It was way more crowded than I was expecting, so there wasn&#39;t really a place to sit. I also hadn&#39;t anticipated such an off-putting crowd. Within minutes of being here, I had a menu swiped off my table and then someone else stole a chair we were using as soon as my boyfriend got up to place our order.

I went with the burger and beer special ($10) which is quite a good deal, even if the beer is Narragansett. The burger comes with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion. Even though it was a little dry, it was still pretty good! It didn&#39;t come with fries, but my boyfriend&#39;s chicken &#39;wich did. I had a few bites and it&#39;s a decent sandwich. The fries were probably my favorite part of the meal. They were crisp and flavored with pepper. Maybe appetizers are the way to go.

The beer selection was unique. Not a large variety of beer to choose from, but they seem to go out of their way to have out-of-the-ordinary brands on tap. Prices were average.

TL; DR: Hollow Nickel is aighttt."

The staff is really friendly and helpful. We had a great chat with one of the bartenders when we were there and he even made us some delicious custom drinks that he made up on the spot. Small beer and wine list, but always a varied offering. For liquor, they definitely focus on whiskey though, so maybe pass this one if that&#39;s not your spirit of choice.

Stand by the bar for a rowdier experience or go to the back where they have a couple tables intimately nested. 
They also have 2 4-seater booths opposite the bar that keep you in the action but let you sit and take a load off.

It was late Thursday night and it was perfectly quiet! The entrance was narrow with white twinkle lights and candles placed throughout the bar.  The dim lighting allowed for a romantic ambiance which I loved!  

We were greeted almost immediately upon finding a nice table in the back.  I continued to marvel at how cozy this place was with their book shelves filled with books (shocking I know, but in a bar??) and a fireplace lit up with candles of different heights.  The wall above it seemed to be chalkboard but the walls in the bathroom were definitely chalkboard! Fun!

My girlfriends and I just wanted a nightcap and ordered a couple drinks.  I ordered a Shirley Temple, because I&#39;m responsible and had important work to do the next morning, while my girlfriends had beer, because they didn&#39;t have urgent work due in the morning. We all decided to share seasoned fries with melted cheese and I&#39;m pretty sure we were disappointed with how it turned out.  I thought it hit the spot but my friend brought up a good point that the cheese should have been flavored and that in lieu of gravy, we should not have been charged for chipotle mayo sauce...Oh and the seasoning on the fries was just dill. Plain ol&#39; dill.

Our server was very attentive if not overly attentive.  He was very patient with us and tried his best to accommodate our requests.  Pretty solid service and experience overall despite the gravy/chipotle mayo and tasteless fries incident.  The location is great since it&#39;s very close to the Atlantic Ave station by the way.  Despite that, willing to try other food they may offer and will definitely visit this place again."

Was with a group of friends &amp; was sold on the backyard patio. Pleasantly spacious with great bench seating on one side to maximize the area. Atmosphere was super relaxing. If weather permits, DO THE BACKYARD! 

Drinks flowed thanks to their $6 beer &amp; shot special. Your choice of a beer &amp; tequila shot or beer &amp; whiskey shot. We went with whiskey &amp; loved it. Best surprise was the food. Looked great, tasted even better. The LGBT (Lettuce, Guac, Bacon, Tomato) sandwich is awesome. Their wings are standard bar fare, but again totally worth it.

It&#39;s conveniently located just a few blocks away so expect a big crowd any time something is going on at the arena. We both had burgers and fries. The burgers were good. The fries were amazing. The draft beers are a little pricey, in my opinion, averaging about $7. 
They have a decent sized backyard which is nice but it was packed when we walked in so we sat inside. A small bar up front and a small eating area in the rear consisting of about 3 tables and a couple of couches for lounging.
The food took over an hour to come out due to the crowd (I assume). They are quick to clean up though, removing dirty glasses etc. The staff was friendly. The crowd was reasonably quiet considering how many people were there.
Id definitely go back next time I&#39;m at the arena."

Probably the best bar of its type in the area (locals are gradually losing out against the wave of corporate-chain bars and commercialization brought by Barclay&#39;s). But this is a pub that still has its &#39;regulars&#39; and is making new ones frequently. VERY clean, neat, and swept. No dust anywhere.  

No jukebox, but there&#39;s a sweet little backyard and there&#39;s also a bookshelf of used books. More bars should have this. Bring in a couple of paperbacks you&#39;ve completed and pick up a few new ones to walk away with. 

Overall, quite a fun interior: magically, the tables and booths are designed and arranged in such a way that allows people to circulate and for diners to &#39;nestle closely together&#39; without feeling cramped. The 4-top tables are also very compact, though still comfy for a group. And the deuce tables have the perfect dimensions. You can talk at normal volume without feeling as if your conversations are intruding on other tables. Other pubs should take note! 

Food: creative/classics. Hearty portions. Extremely well handled. Particularly well done are the fried dill pickles. A crispy, munchy, tart, treat. Draughts: 4-5 mixture of imports and craft brew. 

Prices: very reasonable. No sticker-shocks.

Service: here is where there&#39;s a *slight* letdown. A busboy from the kitchen is the only food runner; not a real waiter and there&#39;s often confusion because the bartender takes the orders at the bar. The resulting confusion means that you can wait a while for your food, and it may get sent to the wrong table.

Crowd: scruffy but convivial. Pseudo-chummy. 

Bathrooms are well-tended to; you can see that someone is on top of germ issues. They&#39;re obviously scrubbed (with good strong bleach) every day. 

There&#39;s coathooks under the bar--now that is a very welcome touch. Its amazing how many bars overlook this touch.

Key fact: this is perhaps some kind of LGBT bar? It may not be apparent at first. It&#39;s a friendly and clubby atmosphere in general--good for everyone, either way--so no reason to give this aspect any concern or regard. Its a mellow and toasty place to get a buzz on."

Saw all the great reviews for this place on Yelp and decided to give it a go.

Oy.

First, we walked in to some staring. No greeting, no menus, no &#34;sit anywhere you like.&#34; Okay. Whatever. It&#39;s a casual pub.

So we seat ourselves at a table. And wait. And wait. Finally, Kyle goes up and asks the guy who&#39;d been staring at us and even walked past us a coupla times for menus.

At this point, we figure we&#39;re gonna have to do everything but cook the food ourselves, so Kyle goes up to the bar to place our order. Meanwhile, guys over at the next table are wondering what&#39;s taking their chips and guac so long. When the server comes around with chips and guac for another table, and they ask where theirs are, he basically berates them for not having a number. Because you&#39;re just supposed to know that you need a number to get your order without anyone offering you one, apparently.

Thirty minutes go by before we remind our server that we placed an order. We&#39;re going to have to scarf at this point. Good thing Kyle paid already, right?

Yyyyyeah, no. Server drops half my sandwich on the floor when the food finally comes out.

No immediate apology. No offer to make another or reduce the charge. We have to initiate that whole thing when the server comes around a while later and asks if we got everything we need. With no sense of irony.

I&#39;m like, &#34;Well, I&#39;m missing half my dinner, but otherwise, all is peaches, I guess.&#34;

It took another fifteen minutes to get the bill adjusted. And I&#39;m still hungry. 

It&#39;s really a shame, too, because the food was really good."

Now that I&#39;ve gotten most of the pros out of the way I can focus on why I&#39;m giving this place 3 stars. The beer selection is ok. Fantastic maybe in the Mid-west, but this is Brooklyn - the supposed land of awesome beer outside of Europe - the beer list is meh. So is their wine list (if I remember correctly...which I&#39;m pretty sure I do), the cocktail list is pretty great, over-priced for where we are, but still pretty damn delicious looking.

I ended up getting a Hoegaarden (a refreshingly crisp beer brewed in Belgium and consumed by me many, many times) and my friend ordered an IPA which she may have not been too crazy about - but at this point we had certainly had enough to drink from a bar hop and a Yelp event - lol.

My other friend raged hard on the Shirley Temples because she was responsibly trying to not get wrecked since she had a job interview in the morning. Smart lady.

We did have the munchies and wanted to try something off the menu so we settled on herb-crusted cheese &amp; gravy fries. Oh surprise, they were out of grave (it&#39;s like barely 9ish mind you, who&#39;s out of gravy????? With this dish being the only thing on the menu that required gravy how could they be out? I take it everyone comes here for the gravy fries and only the gravy fries...

I asked for ranch sauce *in place of the gravy*, a friend asked if they had chipotle mayo and they said they&#39;d make some for her - then I asked for regular mayo and *surprise* they ran out. Ugh.

So the fries come (after a decent waiting period, thank goodness for my beer) and they the top layer (and only the top layer) is covered in some flavorless white cheese. At first my girlfriends liked them, I pointed out the cheese wasn&#39;t good and so they both sampled the cheese without fries and came to the conclusion that I was right.

The fries alone were pretty damn delicious, real win here - but later when we got the check we realized we were charged for our ranch. We explicitly asked if we could get it *in place* of the gravy they ran out of and were told yes, mind you they also ran out of mayo. How does one run out of condiments? 

Our waiter was super attentive though so it&#39;s tough to blame him because his service was spot on. I blame the kitchen folks or whoever does the shopping - buy more mayo, more gravy making ingredients (assuming you&#39;re not buying pre-made gravy, le sigh) and a better quality melty cheese - that white stuff was not good and actually took away from the fries.

I&#39;d come back here if in the neighborhood, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to leave my nooks in Queens or Manhattan to come here if I didn&#39;t have to :-/."

Pros:
- cute rustic decor
- very affordable (had a burger for $12, sangria for $8, they had specials going on like a shot &amp; a beer for $6)
- great food
- you can very well hear each other even on a Saturday night, which not many bars offer
- also on a sat night it was not extremely packed, which made the experience a lot more pleasant
Cons:
- the only thing I wasn&#39;t a fan of is that there&#39;s no waiter service - you have to go to the bar every time you want to order something.

I think I could have loved this place if I had actually gotten the vegetarian sandwich I ordered, instead of a turkey sandwich which I took two bites of before I realized it was meat (we were seated in the garden, and it was so dark we couldn&#39;t see what we were eating). I think I could have loved this place if, when the guy who delivered our food (not our server; she seemed to have some friends seated around us who were occupying alot of her time) had known what he was carrying and, when I pointed clearly to my companion and said &#34;he gets the chicken,&#34; had actually put the chicken sandwich in front of him instead of me. Two bites and all I taste is barbecue sauce, and I did not order a sandwich with barbecue sauce. Not a good sign that I couldn&#39;t even tell it was chicken. As our server makes an appearance about every 30 minutes (which is how long my companion has been waiting to order another beer), I grab my plate and make my first trip to the bar, where I am told that the sandwich is chicken and my companion must have mine. He does not. He has someone else&#39;s turkey sandwich, confirmed on my second trip to the bar. I am the customer. I should not be carrying food around this restaurant, but I am also middle -aged, and couldn&#39;t afford to spend the time I have left waiting for my server&#39;s rare appearances at our table. I think I could have loved this place- a relaxed vibe, comfortable outdoor seating, a typical bar menu, but some of the sandwiches sounded yummy, especially the goat cheese, spinach and tomato sandwich I ordered but never actually got (I had a premonition there was going to be trouble when she took our order without a pad. Write it down, sweetie!) I think I could have loved this place, but I can&#39;t imagine ever going there again without experiencing PTSD flashbacks - that&#39;s how bad it was."

First of all, Nichols is amazing. He made everything easy-- from the planning beforehand and the service during, right down to the processing of the payment at the end.  It all could have been overly complicated and a pain but Nichols made sure it was not.  He and his staff were friendly, efficient, honest and accommodating.  The food and drinks were good too! I had the BLT, which I thoroughly enjoyed-- thick crispy cuts of bacon, fresh slices of juicy tomato and crisp lettuce all on top of two perfectly toasted slices of sour dough bread. The bread had some sort of mayo on it that made it different (in a good way) than any other BLT I&#39;ve had (can&#39;t remember what the flavor of the mayo was, sorry, maybe avocado?).  By all accounts everyone else enjoyed their food too. Oh and the pickle backs! First time I&#39;ve had them but I enjoyed those as well.

All in all, a great experience hosting a birthday brunch at Hollow Nickel. Good times. Highly recommend."

It&#39;s a tight fit, but there&#39;s lots of candles to set the mood and plenty of tasty dishes to share. I ordered the chicken club with chips and had bites of my friend&#39;s meatballs, burrata, and tuna tartare. 

Honestly, I was feeling a little decadent and spread a bit of burrata on my club--it was divine!

The food was really good, but just a tad overpriced in my opinion. My friends and I went for brunch, the bill came out to around $55 after tax. That being said, the food was amazing. I had the scrambled eggs with jamon and a side salad while they both had the burger. The eggs were fluffy and perfectly seasoned while the salad was full of flavor.

I will definitely be coming back!"

It came on a crispy baguette with tender chicken and a huge side of delicious house made chips. 

I would definitely order it again, but would also like to try their other menu items. The poached chicken salad that my friend ordered looked delicious too. 

Definitely the most interesting bathroom sink that I&#39;ve experienced. Kind of hard to explain, but it&#39;s almost like a toilet bowl basin that you pull down to use the water and you put it back up to drain. Very unique. 

It&#39;s very small, but in a cute and quaint way. Very nice ambiance with friendly staff. Would love to go back for wine and a cheese plate - probably Mon-Wed since Thu-Sat night gets really packed."

In the time that has passed, I&#39;ve managed to roam in here several times.  Always at the most vulnerable times, such as when I&#39;ve already had too much to drink at some other favorite food and grog experience.  For some reason, Smith &amp; Mills reaches out like some sexy temptress asking me to enter for just an innocent last fling.  Nothing serious.  No regrets.  Just enjoy the time and move on.

And so, just as it happens with complex pleasures, I don&#39;t just have one.  I have another.  And I wake up feeling that it was more than a fling.  It was serious.  But, there are no regrets.  I did enjoy the experience.

The bartender here is very cool and has a real touch for classic cocktails.  Try a Vesper, Manhattan, Sazerac or Vieux Carre.  These are some of my lifetime favorites and Smith &amp; Mills honors each of them by mixing, garnishing and serving them with simple style.

The room is fantastically simple and complex at the same time.  It&#39;s a box with a not very high ceiling that is decorated in a very creative way.  Just a few tables and a small bar.  I don&#39;t think it can hold more than 30 people without getting uncomfortable.  Come here when the crowd is thin."

Sometimes day drinking is the way to go!  I must say that this was, by far, my favorite spot we visited.

Smith and Mills is a tiny little bar that was once a carriage house and possesses loads of personality! First, the bartender was super friendly and attentive, and engaged with us as we talked about the area. We were staying in Tribeca, having traveled to NYC from FL to spend Christmas. He gave us some pointers on some great spots in the area, and our planned ONE drink ended up turning into three drinks each. My husband and our 2 friends were literally just planning to stay for 1 beer so we could make our way around to a bunch of bars, but we ended up staying at Smith and Mills for at least a couple of hours longer than planned. This was because the bartender was just so friendly and engaging.

The restroom -- this review is not complete without mentioning the restroom. It is a converted elevator!  Very cool with a ton of character.

You MUST use the restroom or you&#39;re missing out on the whole experience here!  Bottoms up!"

No sign outside so just look for the rustic barn doors. Dark and romantic inside. Seating is very limited and you&#39;ll be sitting very close to the people next to you. The menu is very limited as well. Only a few choices. The portions can be small, so that&#39;s why I opted for the burger. Best bang for your buck. 

Very creative drinks - they&#39;ve got some serious punch, so if you&#39;re a lightweight, stay away from the Vieux Carre (rye whiskey, cognac, benedictine, sweet vermouth). Service was satisfactory. Smith and Mills is perfect for a party of two - quiet, casual and a good spot for a bite and a drink."

Yes it&#39;s pricey....it&#39;s in Tribeca and I know I&#39;m just paying for their rent...but how do they make their bread taste so good?!

The White Wine Steamed Mussels are enough to give this place 5 stars (which says a lot, because I don&#39;t even like mussels).

Food isn&#39;t always consistent because of 2/4 burner stove. I don&#39;t blame them for this because they roll out food with incredible skill.

- Chicken Liver Mousse, YES, YES, YES! (Upset they no longer serve during in between hours so you HAVE to get charcuterie plate... but this is life. It is still AMAZING.)
- Burger is a great go to. On the smaller side but totally satisfying. Russian dressing on side.
- Homemade chips are bomb-digs.
- Gravlax Toast is AWESOME and I don&#39;t even like ordering salmon. That creme fraiche, though. // Avo Toast... obviously.
- Mussels are perfect when they nail &#39;em.
- Burrata is reliable, they change the accompaniments frequently.
- Oysters are expensive here, but I tend to order them always.

I don&#39;t order their market salads typically because they&#39;re super raw, but if you&#39;re into that sorta thing - totally refreshing. The one thing I feel like they&#39;ve never gotten down is the fish dish. Fish is always cooked perfectly but the sides have lacked in flavor.

Almost forgot.... COCKTAILS. Just do it. Even the Nathaniel Moore.

Service is always lovely.

Also, ambience + decor is industrial but cozy. Intimate and romantic but vivacious at night. During the day it&#39;s very calm, you can snack and read. Bartenders tend to have great taste in music."

Hence I was surprised by how much the one rude waitress last night ruined my mood completely. I&#39;m sorry, but you can&#39;t act like you&#39;re doing ME a favor by letting me eat there. It is not a massive inconvenience to you for me to order an espresso instead of jumping up and getting the check right away (on a non-crowded night mind you). 

So dear restaurant owner: a staff member is undermining what would have otherwise been an above average meal. It seems inefficient and sub-optimal to have one person manage to reverse the good experiences that you&#39;ve otherwise worked to create. Judging by other similar reviews seen, one of the top three key words popping up on the top of your Yelp page should be: RUDE."

Service is what I&#39;d expect from a hipsteresque joint, slow and &#39;oh, was someone sitting there?&#39;

Ordered a French 75, not bad. The star was the char! Steamed from the bottom, with some sort of sweet onion sauce to swim in, it was very good. Very decent serving size, but essentially ala carte, (with no indication that it was going to be ala carte, unless, again, my non-native status blinded me to this).

Atmosphere was tres cool. It wouldn&#39;t have been out of place if the patrons all started rhythmically snapping their fingers while casually continuing their conversations. (extra points for tail-end alliteration).

All in all, a decent experience, I enjoyed it, but probably a one time thing."

It&#39;s really cozy and has character of it&#39;s own. I would think places like this would exist in williamsburg haha. Stumbled upon this place after an afternoon of kayaking by the river. We came in for some drinks in an early afternoon (note: they don&#39;t serve dinner till 6pm, but raw bad option is available) we weren&#39;t hungry so only got an order of raw scallops (marinated in orange peeps + chile and poppy seeds) real food! Def coming back for their dinner next time. 

What really caught my eyes was how small the kitchen was! It&#39;s right at the bar with a few pans hanging on top which gave this place it&#39;s character. They make use of space really well throughout the whole ressie. I love it! And the bathroom, the sink is foldable! It folds up! How cool is that? Go take a look at it I really like this place.

It&#39;s a bit hidden as the front of the ressie does not have a name on it or something. Great find!"

With a fairly small and standard list of about 8 drinks, with Dark and Stormy, Pimm&#39;s Cup and and Old Fashioned making appearances, it wasn&#39;t anything special - although my drink was poured with a heavy hand, which is definitely a plus :)

The menu is similarly small, which actually makes life easier, with entrees limited to 6 or so dishes, with burgers ($16), octopus ($21), mussels ($18) and meatballs ($18) making the menu, along with a few salads and tartars.

There were about 20 people there on a Friday night and that is near capacity.  The kitchen is a 3x3 corner of the bar.--which I have never seen in this country. We had the burgers which were very good.  This place is so small that my coat hanging on the wall on the opposite side of the bar smelled like their cod dish the next day. Simple is another operative word. With six entrees, you don&#39;t have to worry about choice.  In the days of celebrity chefs, this restaurant hits the other end of the spectrum."

We actually wanted to eat at Laconda Verde for dinner but the wait was 1.5 hours so we decided to walk around and find something else. We saw this place across the street and immediately loved the look of it. As other reviewers have mentioned, it&#39;s tiny and super charming. I felt transported to another time and place. It was also packed but they had one open table and we snagged it before glancing at a menu. We regretted this decision when we sat down.

I read an on-line review for this place after visiting it and the author felt that the restaurant was best suited for appetizers and drinks...I agree. The menu is random. We were starving and we were a bit disappointed to see small dishes like lamb meatballs, buratta and bread, mussels, salmon tartare, swordfish, etc. I ordered the buratta and really enjoyed it. My husband had the mussels and he thought they were okay. For drinks we ordered the Pimm&#39;s Cup and the Spritzer. Not the best Pimm&#39;s Cup I&#39;ve had but it was good. For dessert we ordered the bread pudding and it was mediocre. Service was good. Staff was attentive.

As for the ambiance, it&#39;s dark, crowded, and loud. Since it&#39;s small, we were sitting very very close to our neighbors. We could hear every single thing they were saying. When any of us had to use the restroom, we had to ask each other to move the tables or chairs around. Because of this, it&#39;s not very romantic. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for couples. However, I think this place would be great with a bunch of friends or for single people. It&#39;s a young-ish, hip, and attractive crowd (at least when I was there). I&#39;d probably eat here again with friends."

One of the most unique bars here and I&#39;ve been a lot. But, I went again last night for the first time in about a year and I was really upset to see them make my cocktail with Gordon&#39;s gin. When you&#39;re paying $15 for a drink, it should be made with a much better quality gin than what most places serve as house. Pretty upset to see it go downhill like that as a mixology bar should have better standards.. Which it used to. Tiny cocktail, expensive, and cheap booze: you can really only have two of the three for it to be considered worth it. 

Two stars still because it is SO amazing inside. Definitely the coolest bathroom in New York. But, if you go, stick to wine, beer, or champagne."

You would think that in a tiny restaurant it wouldn&#39;t take that much talent to provide a warm welcome for customers, but apparently any suitable level of service was completely foreign to them. They also added gratuity to our check because we clearly were not intending to tip due to their terrible, unprofessional manner. 

The chairs are also horribly uncomfortable. Go to Laconde Verde across the street - they know service."

It&#39;s hard to find from the outside, but if you make it to the corner of the street, you&#39;ve gone too far. Look for the cottage exterior at the  entrance.  

The food and drinks are above average - the Manhattans are poured a little heavy with the vermouth, but my friend&#39;s Cosmopolitan was better than expected. We had the meatballs and blackened sea bass and both were very good.  I&#39;d definitely go back."

Moore. We were intrigued by how S&amp;M disappears into the landscape when closed; hidden behind another patina-highlighted TriBeCa industrial door. We stopped in early the next evening (last Thursday) to check out the space. We liked the look and feel of the restaurant; a small industrial space with lots of character. The bartenders were affable. The menu was creative and inexpensive. We decided to come back later for dinner. Bad decision. 

Things started out just fine. The hostess was welcoming. There was no hint of the snooty or controlling behaviors other reviewers noted. She gave us our choice of tables and quickly returned with ice water which was very appreciated on a muggy, 90F day in NYC. 

Then our server appeared. I mistook her for someone who wandered in from the street, dressed as she was in dirty jeans, long sleeve sweater (on a 90F day) with only one arm in a sleeve, leaving the other sleeve to dangle, and wearing a Spurs cap sideways. She approached the table without saying a word. She just looked at us as if waiting for a response to some unspoken question - one asked only in her head. We ordered a Pimm&#39;s Cup and Dark &amp; Stormy. Both were $14. The drinks were fine. The D&amp;S had a lot of floating ginger pieces. Using a strong ginger beer instead of common ginger ale would have alleviated the need for chunks in my drink. The Pimm&#39;s Cup could have used more liquid and less mint, especially for the price. 

The server returned to take our order after a long wait. A runner brought our meals 20 minutes later. I had the YELLOW FIN TUNA ESCABECHE ($24) served with Asparagus, Smoked Almond Puree, Minutina, Tomato Confit, Sherry Reduction. It was disgusting. I ordered it rare, which it was, but there was no sear to the steak. Instead, the fish looked like it was cooked briefly over very low heat, giving the flesh a sickly beige pallor. And it was riddled with gristle. The almond puree was a coagulated mass that stuck to the plate. The sauce clearly broke. The asparagus were small, angular slivers of anorexic asparagus. The dish, while a good idea, was poorly composed. My wife had the PAN SEARED BRANZINO ($16) served with Bulgur Wheat Salad, Scallion, Fresh Mint, Dill Oil. It looked and tasted like trout, not branzino. 

Never once did the server check on our meals or ask if we wanted another round of drinks. At least the hostess kept the water glasses filled. The server came back only to literally slap down the check. She never removed our plates and utensils or offered dessert. She made weird faces and noises and flitted off. I actually asked the hostess if the server was new and said I thought that there was something wrong with her. Against my better judgment and at the direction of my wife, I left a 15 percent tip. I really wanted to stiff her. 

If you go to S&amp;M at all, I recommend drinks only. In its current incarnation, Smith &amp; Mills is a waste of very cool, probably very expensive, space. They got the decor right, but the bad food and terrible service make it an empty suit.

I was meeting a friend who suggested this spot and from Yelp photos, I thought it was a dive bar. The photos do not do this space justice. It&#39;s small but quaint, with several outdoor two seaters, and a cute bar area. In fact, I think this is already one of my favorite spots in all of New York now. It isn&#39;t just that the service is spot on. It has a feeling of intimacy that I would recommend for a first day. The menu items feature elaborate and refreshing cocktails, but not so many that you&#39;ll have trouble making a decision. The same applies to the food menu. I enjoyed the salmon tartare, which was fantastic. My one cocktail, called the Billionaire, was appropriate in name for its alcoholic value. Each time
I put my water glass down, it was being filled up again, which I love, because it allows me to stay hydrated while I douse myself in absinthe. I would highly recommend this place and will visit it again soon."

Yes, the drinks were good (I had the Dark and Stormy, which I read positive reviews about on Yelp!)... and the bartender was nice enough and attentive... but the host, well, that&#39;s another story. She was a nightmare! In fact, so much so that we never got seated... so we eventually left!! 

So what exactly happened? Well, after having a drink at the bar, we decided to stay for dinner. There was a 3-top table available, and the hostess indicated that we&#39;d have to wait on a 2-top because the empty table was reserved for bigger parties. So, we waited... and waited... and soon thereafter, the hostess sat another COUPLE at the 3-top table! A couple that, mind you, had arrived after us! Wow! What disrespect!"

Their drinks and atmosphere is great. Friday, was the first time I tried the food. I had oysters and avocado toast. A few oysters had shells, which happens from time to time. My avocado toast had a dead fly in it, mixed in with the black sesame seeds, I almost ate it!

What&#39;s the deal? Prices are above average (for TriBeCa standards) so it&#39;s obvious you can tip your staff to at least be borderline polite.

Did not have trouble getting seats at the bar before 7 pm, but later on the bar fills up. However, it&#39;s all in the timing so if you&#39;re standing and someone leaves you can most likely grab a few barstools (or a table).

We weren&#39;t sure at first if we were going to eat, but we ended up sharing an order of salmon tartare and an order of artichoke crostini. Both were very good. I had a Dark + Stormy and this was my first time ordering that particular cocktail so I can&#39;t really say for sure if Smith &amp; Mills makes it perfectly. I personally favor sweeter, girlier drinks the most, but the Dark + Stormy I had at the bar was strong and I liked it well enough. I was also drinking water and the bartenders were very good about refilling our water glasses without us having to ask.

By the way, I&#39;d recommend sitting at the bar (rather than at a table) if it&#39;s a very warm, humid night, you&#39;ll feel the air-conditioning more.

We were so famished, that we decided to order a late din-din.  I think we ate around 11pm...but it&#39;s New York, everything stays open later.  

The choice:  the fish.  I don&#39;t remember what the fish was called but it was yummy, flaky and crispy, that I literally inhaled my food.

Luckily, lunch was not busy and we were the only people dining there for most of the time.  Sam was both the bartender and the the waiter and seemed to juggle these hats well.  He made a stiff Dark and Stormy and a smooth Old Fashioned.  For food we shared the acorn squash salad which was spectacular.  I had the curry apple chicken and my boyfriend ordered the burger.  Both dishes were fine, but not amazing.  

The place is really so unique and intriguing.  The furniture is different and the decorative pieces seemed recycled and used.  I love it, but I cannot imagine being here on a crowded night- it&#39;s just too tiny.

The place is the size of my first studio apartment, wait okay i admit, probably a bit bigger - but not by much. It has about 4 tables.. you can&#39;t sit down at a table unless you plan on having dinner there, so its either one of the four counter seats, or stand around. Drinks are standard price for TriBeca ($10-$15), appetizers are pretty delicious here (calamari was definitely worth it).

We went for drinks to meet up with some friends and were treating like common criminals. Does the staff there actually realize they are in the hospitality industry and part of their job is to treat their guests with kindness and be accommodating? Dealing with guests is easy, slap on a smile or feign one if you have to and treat them well. Being sarcastic and using a rude tone when dealing with a paying customer is absurd and completely against anything the service industry stands for.

I&#39;ve been in the industry for over 16 years and have managed restaurants all throughout Manhattan and am an avid restaurant goer and have never experienced anything like this place in my life. 

The so- called manager, Lacy, was abhorrent and the hostess was completely obtuse. This place is a complete disgrace to anyone in the service industry...you should be ASHAMED of yourselves. 

Future patrons- do yourselves a favor and skip this bar all together, with all the places in city, this one should just disapppear.

To the owner- you should seriously consider firing or at the very least take the necessary time to train your staff on the art of hospitality and treating customers with respect. Otherwise, why be open at all? 

My advise...Go to Weather Up a couple of blocks south. Better drinks, better ambiance and definitely a much friendlier and educated staff."

I like them (and enjoy making my own), but this one was just a step above the rest (full disclosure: never been to Bermuda).

Cool little spot, emphasis on little. Early on a Friday night probably isn&#39;t the time to enjoy this place -- trying to just get a drink at the bar felt like a 5AM Black Friday mob at Best Buy. I hope to go back at a more relaxing time to try the food (it looked/smelled great) and have a few more of those delicious drinks."

Buuut, despite the crowd, the decor and the ambiance were pretty classy in a good way, the drink I had was delicious and seemed to have never-ending cucumber slices, the bartenders were nice, and the food they were making (in a kitchen that I would generously describe as &#39;cozy&#39;) looked really good."

It&#39;s located in an old carriage house across from Loconda Verde, but the complete opposite vibe from Loconda. 

Space is definitely limited, there are only 6 tables, so I&#39;d recommend coming on a school night. Be prepared to have a drink at the bar first while you wait, however you will not be disappointed in the drink selection. Really good, stiff Old Fashioned. I&#39;ve had their Prosecco too which is lovely. 

Service is a bit slow and not the most attentive, I think it&#39;s part of the whole laid back vibe and fact that the joint and kitchen is so damn small. We split the arugula salad, salmon tartare, tomato brushetta, and the burger. The burger was the highlight of my evening, but everything was quite tasty and reasonably priced. The burger comes with house made chips and russian dressing, both of which were amazing. Yum! 

Great place to catch up with a friend, come on a date, or grab late night drinks. Always a good looking crowd. Smith and Mills, yet another reason to love Tribeca!"

We went to hang up our coats, but the &#34;hostess&#34; actually rushed us to fill the coat hooks that were not filled yet. We let this slide. When one of the many empty tables cleared, I asked if the four people in my party could sit. I didn&#39;t think this would be a problem since most of the establishment was empty. The &#34;hostess&#34; said &#34;once you order a drink at the bar, you can&#39;t sit down at a table.&#34; She turned to a sever who said &#34;these are for people who order dinner.&#34; He did not ask us if we wanted dinner (which we did).

I understand most of the target clientele are more than willing to pay 10+ dollars for everything on the menu but at least you should know this before going. The food and drink here is normal, especially average and I&#39;d say un-deserving of mention.

The salmon tartare was a non-event, overly doused in mayonnaise. The actual salmon was good and tasted pretty fresh.  

All of the drinks on the menu are $13 dollars and are mediocre cocktails! (combine and speed garnish) I say this, only because there are so many great cocktail bars in the vicinity that it&#39;s a shame not to head to a place nearby like B Flat, in case you are going for this reason.

I will say this though. The space itself, although really small, is interesting to sit in. And what a funny bathroom! Definitely the oldest bathroom in NYC I&#39;ve ever seen. The sink pulls down from the wall...too bad all the water swamps the floor!

**2 stars not because it&#39;s a bad place, but because of how mediocre the food and drink (that we had) was.

Molly D. was right on.  The hipster, better than you staff here is awful.  

We came here for my sisters birthday to have a few drinks and taste the menu which I had heard was pretty good.  It&#39;s very small inside with an antique decor and a bar in the back that both the bartender and chef work behind.  I&#39;m convinced that there is someone else helping out and passing things up from the basement as it just doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s enough room back there to stock all the food and clean the dishes.  

The gf and I ordered the mussels, meatballs and sausage and pretzel (comes with two).  The mussels were very good and definitely the best thing we ordered.  The meatballs were average as was the sausage and pretzel.  Not bad by any means but nothing to write home about.  To drink I had a Manhattan which was decent and a GREAT Dark and Stormy.  They put actual ginger in their D&amp;S&#39;s so they have a little bite to them and a nice chew every once in a while.  Definitely the highlight of their offerings.  They asked us a few times if we were ready to order, which rubbed me the wrong way but I brushed it off thinking that they were just eager to feed us.  

It was about the time we finished our meal when I realized that the staff is just incredibly immature and irritable and that everything has to be the way they want it or else they will bitch and moan and let you know that they are unhappy.  The staff here is basically a bunch of whiney 15 year old girls disguised as hipsters.  

There were about 12 of us but a very mild mannered group of people who each had their own conversations going on in different packs.  No one was being loud or obnoxious and we were all ordering drinks.  I was then notified that the pretty boy in capri&#39;s and suade shoes told my sister that he doesn&#39;t like the vibe that we are bringing to the bar and that we should go.   ARE YOU SERIOUS?  I don&#39;t like the vibe you&#39;re bringing to manhood, sissy boy.  What vibe are you going for?  Pretentious trust fund hipsters living in their tribeca apartment that their parents bought them??  You&#39;re going to turn away business because you don&#39;t like how we look?  They followed that by saying that they could suggest other bars in the area for us.  Oh thanks a lot dick.  They certainly know how to kill a crowd because the place was empty after we left.  Next time I come here is going to be to burn the place down.

As there are only a few tables we had to wait about a half-an-hour for a table, but the bar is stocked so this isn&#39;t an issue. Between the five us we split 2 orders of the meatballs as an app and had the burgers around. All of the food was cooked to perfection and the service was fantastic.

Food-wise:  I have only been there once and for lunch.  I had the BLT.  The bacon was crisped to perfection and the sandwich was exactly what you expect.  I enjoyed it.

To drink:  I had the Dark &amp; Stormy (yes, during lunch) because everyone on Yelp recommended it.

Food
Authentic home cooked style food. Hearty and to the point with no frills. Decently priced at 9-14 dollars for arepas with possible modifications of plaintains instead of corn wheat.  The tequeños were small but tasty. 

Service and ambience
This is where they fall short. The place was packed for dinner on Thursday night. It was too dark, you couldn&#39;t even read the menu or see your food. It was very dimly lit with the ceiling lights but the so called ambience with one tea light per table is bad, made me think maybe they are trying to save on electricity! It can be very loud inside, so not good for a date night unless you want to avoid talking to your date. The waitress and waiter, perhaps they were the owners. No service with a smile and she was not really interested in giving recommendations. She took away my partners plate before he was finished with his meal and my dipping sauce for the tequeños before I was finished eating, tequeños in hand she never asked, are you finished or may I clear it? We had to keep asking for the hot sauce or their special green hot sauce a few times when our mains came. When they did bring the sauce bottles she mumbled something which we could hear but we thought we heard that one was spicy. 

The space is tight. Not exaggerating. You might be a little to close to the person on the other table. I saw the waitress push seat to get by while people were sitting in them! If you are a big person and the place is crowded the only place to sit is on a banquette if you are lucky if not the back of your chair will be touching the back of another chair and to squeeze like that isn&#39;t comfortable. 


They accept reservations for 3 people anything less you need to just walk in. I remember going here on a Saturday night. Really packed so it is popular. But bad service makes any great homestyle cooked food taste bad. And the tip I left, if I could I didn&#39;t want to, not about being stingy, but why give extra for a bad experience. 

I recommend trying during the day. Maybe the ambience is better. Good food but not recommended for a quiet romantic dinner or expect good great service."

They have a good size menu that covers the gamete.  They offer appetizers, salads, sandwiches, entrees, cocktails and even desserts.

We were a group of 4 and while the waitress/hostess was friendly she was slower than slow.  We were beyond patient but after having sat for 15 minutes without even being offered a drink we had to stop the gal.  We placed our drink order and guess what???  We waited yet again.  

We ordered 2 &#34;shakes&#34; and glasses of water.  The mango shake was quite good but not blended. It was more of a think juice with ice.  The coconut &#34;shake&#34; too came with ice and not blended.  It tasted like coconut rice pudding minus the rice.  We liked it but it was not a traditional shake.

3 of the 4 of us ordered true entrees witch included a choice of rice with red or black beans and sweet plantains.  Everyone commented on how good the food was. The 4th ordered a traditional arepa with pork.  She loved it but damn, it was tiny for what you pay.  It was more of a snack size.

Overall the food is great but the prices are overly expensive.  Each entree was on average $20 where the arepa (corn tortilla type filled pita pocket) was $10.  I think prices are about 20-25% more than they should be considering what you are getting.

The location is ideal and the inside is nicely decorated.  I would guess that the restaurant seats about 25 people at any given time.  Biggest complaint was how slow the service is.  Biggest compliment is that the food tastes rather good.

Fried yucca- Delicious and perfectly fried. The sauce provided paired perfectly with it. 
La Chiquinquira Arepa- Crispy, fresh and absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend getting this if you have not tried an arepa before.
La Bandeja Dona Barbara- I was extremely disappointed with this dish. This was honestly $23 down the drain. The pork rinds were extremely hard and not crispy. The meat was tough.

Overall, the appetizers were great, but I was very disappointed with the entree. I may return in the future, but will definitely skip ordering the platters."

Don&#39;t be surprised why 18th street becomes the home of some great dating spots. I mean, it&#39;s chelsea, the new interesting area.

The place is very southern American like. Few spots for outdoor seating and the inner decoration made me feel like I was back to Ecuador again. In fact, nah, back to Venezuela again.

Inside, it&#39;s a very tiny place to host a lot of people but they do have a big heart to host tons of people. I guess that&#39;s why they are squeezing every inch of the space to allow so many tiny tables. 

I am lucky enough to arrive early without waiting outside. 

Food: I got the arepa Miss Venezuelan, and empanadas (carne)
Both are delicious, very filling and flavorful. 
They made it fresh for sure because I did take some time to wait for those food. But the waiter is very nice and when I stopped playing my phone, she&#39;s like, the food is coming. I think they are very caring. 

Price: cheap dinner place for sure! I &#39;d like to try something else, their appetizer menu seems awesome!

Overall: gotta take someone with me next time. Very great south american experience."

Thankfully this spot had no one inside when we got in (also a bit of a bad sign).

After getting a seat at the corner, decided to get the Guacamole+chips appetizer first ($7ish), along with a mango milkshake ($6) and a hot toddy ($5). Toddy was advertised as a hot milkshake, which seemed interesting, what I got served was a regular hot chocolate. The mango milkshake wasn&#39;t as thick as I hoped but better than the toddy. Guac came out next and the chips were lightly fried and hardy, but the amount of guacamole served was barely enough for the amount of chips. Though concerned about what we&#39;ve already ordered, pressed on and got the Tuna Arepa ($8) and the La Chiquinquira Arepa ($9). Both arepas really looked promising, as each were overflowing with ingredients. Unfortunately the entire meal is very bland, a lack of seasoning and everything is put together but not blended in any way. 

I really liked the ambiance here and the service is quick and helpful (hence the 2 stars). The food just isn&#39;t very good, so won&#39;t be back."

Decor has a nice homey feel to it - perfect for a low-key night with friends or a date.

I shared a sampling with my boyfriend ($10), which came with 3 bite sized arepas and two mini tequenos (basically fried cheese sticks) - all of which were very yummy, but overpriced in my opinion.

We each ordered a patacon (plantain sandwich - about $12-13) - it was my first time trying this, and it was great! The outside was very crispy and the one I chose in particular was the Pabellon, which had shredded beef, black beans, cheese, and plantains - so yummy! 

We also got a side order of fries ($5) - not impressive and pretty forgettable. 

All in all, this is a solid spot in the city if you&#39;re looking for some really authentic Venezuelan food - I can&#39;t speak for all the menu items, but the patacons are a must-try!"

El Cocotero is small but provides a cozy environment for a group of friends.  A couple negatives, there is no drink menu and it seems like you drink whatever they have that day.

I ordered delivery via Seamless, but an hour later the food hadn&#39;t arrived so I called the restaurant to figure out the problem. A woman told me it came up on their computer as &#34;pick up.&#34; I checked the order ... definitely says delivery. I called Seamless and they were just as confused as I was. Then I got a call from the restaurant saying the Seamless driver never showed up to pick up the food and deliver it to me. So then the order didn&#39;t come through as &#34;pickup&#34;? Which one is it??

The Seamless rep tries calling the driver and in the meantime sends me a code for $10 off my next order. I call the restaurant back to see if their delivery guy can bring me the food instead. They said no because I was too far away, even though I&#39;m only 2 avenues over. Seriously? And I can&#39;t leave work, hence the reason why I&#39;m ordering delivery.

I call Seamless back to see if they found the driver, but he&#39;s not answering their calls. So I  just spent $15 on food that no one wants to deliver. Seamless obviously dropped the ball here BUT the restaurant should&#39;ve called me sooner. And they should&#39;ve tried to be more accommodating. This was completely unacceptable."

I&#39;ll make no pretense of knowing what &#34;good&#34; Venezuelan food is all about; however, the meal I had was delicious and the drinks were exactly what the doctor called for.

The Food/Drink: We ordered the Arepa taster, which was delicious (although a little small,) and then for my meal, I had the Arepa de Pabellón (beef and plantain) and the Patacón de Pernil (pork), and they were both DELICIOUS. And a lot more food than I expected, which was great, because I had lunch for the next day, which made it feel like a great deal, too. For drink, I had a rum and passionfruit punch to start (delicious and fruity...almost TOO drinkable...), followed by a Venezuelan beer, Polar Bear, which was fun to see on the menu! Everyone was thoroughly pleased with their meals, and we rolled out the restaurant very happy and full!

Experience: The restaurant is tucked into a cute block in Chelsea where the smooth latin music and dark, intimate interior transported us out of New York City.

I can&#39;t speak to the authenticity, but I know good food when I taste it. My boyfriend and I split the Pabellon Criollo, after a recommendation from our server. We were having a tough time deciding, so she recommended this Venezuelan national dish - shredded flank steak stew, white rice, plantains and black beans. The beef was super flavorful and went well with everything else on the dish. I wish there was more rice, but that&#39;s just me. (I&#39;m Asian - whatever, lol). I also really enjoyed their drinks! On a hot and humid day like today, their mango milkshake and watermelon slush really hit the spot. The flavors actually tasted like mango and watermelon, no artificial flavoring here! 

This place seems pretty intimate. Monday&#39;s are generally slow days for business, but I was a little surprised to see people doing paperwork in the otherwise empty restaurant. It feels very homey to me. Kinda dark, and the tables are close together. Sitting by the window, there was a nice breeze coming through.

After waiting 30 minutes for a table. We we seated near the open window where it was cold from the wind and the rain coming inside. The table was cramped into the corner and the lighting was very dark. 

We ordered taquenos and arepas con chicharron. They are both very small. There was hardly any chicharron in the arepas that were hard to share with the table. We mentioned the lack of chicharron and our server just ignored it and moved on. 

We ordered a glass of sangria and it was $11. Another alcoholic drink was $12 and it was straight alcohol with no mango. 

The pantacons were okay but they were not authentically Venezuelan. 

Overall the experience was less than thrilling especially for us visiting from Venezuela. The total meal cost $135. Generally I&#39;d say it was just overpriced.

- Miss Venezuela Arepa - Awesome, warm fresh arepa with guacamole, a lot of avacado and tomato. It was big, big enough maybe for lunch for one person. I miss that thing. 

Dinner:
- Lentil Soup - Seemed to have too much cilantro for my liking a possibly a sour tomato. Wouldn&#39;t order that.
- Vegetarian Special - Plate of peppers, onions and tomatoes sauteed to perfection with rice, black beans and some plantains. This dish was delicious, and very large.

The taste was definitely there.

We also ordered a small bowl of soup to share. Again the waiter recommended we should order two bowls of soup. The one bowl was fine and was actually quite tasty.

Finally we ordered two entrees. I guess we should&#39;ve had the arepas like everyone else, but we had the plates. They were below average- very similar to the appetizer we had earlier, but maybe not quite as good.

The real kicker is we ended up spending like $90 after tax and tip. This was definitely not a $90 meal. Combine that with the annoying &#34;upselling&#34; of the waiter and I feel confident that we&#39;ll probably not come back here."

We tried two different types of empanada&#39;s, the Pabellon (which was killer), Carne and sweet plantains. As for our entrees, we got arepas (to share), the La Chiquinquira was my favorite. The La Morillo was good too. There was also a sweet meat version that the server recommended that I didn&#39;t love.

Do NOT skip the rum cocktail drink. It&#39;s made of rum, passion fruit and mango juice (I think) and I have to say, it&#39;s worth just coming here for this drink (alone).

We wanted some filling mid-priced food in the area and this place seemed right because of the variety and price. I split an arepa with chicken and the orange roasted chicken, which came with yucca fries and a salad. All of my friends loved the arepas they got, although they were not very filling for the price of $9-11. I definitely think that they should come with a small side or be less expensive. The chicken that I got was alright, but reminded me of the chicken that I would get at my middle school for free for lunch. That was not the type of quality meal I was looking for. On the other hand, the yucca fries and the salad were delicious, and I was content with the taste of the arepa. 

The service was lacking throughout our whole time there. We were the only table in this small restaurant that was waiting for food, two other tables were just drinking, and we waited for a long time for our meals. We all arrived around 9:30/9:45 and received the meals around 10:30/45. We had to hurry to finish them by 11. Not only did they take long to make, my friend ordered two empanadas and she only received one. Lastly, when the food finally came out the waitress did not know who ordered what. So, my friend and I had to look at the menu again to figure out which arepa was whose. All of the staff seemed a bit unprofessional and not sure of how to deal with a group of our size. 

We also felt like the waiters were pushing us to purchase drinks. The restaurant doesn&#39;t have a drink menu, and we were told the drinks and prices out loud by the waiter. From what I remember, I believe the pitchers of sangria were around $29 and the beers around $6-8. That&#39;s no fun. There are nicer establishments on the east side that have pitchers of sangria for $15, such as San Marzano. In Queens, Las Margaritas in Astoria has pitchers of margarita for $35. 

So, if you&#39;re looking for a place on the budget around all of the night clubs - I would opt for Artichoke Pizza instead. It&#39;ll come out to much cheaper and everyone will leave full."

Unfortunately it did not go as well as planned. The sangria was watery ($12 a glass!), the servers did not send out sharing plates or napkins for our appetizer, the avocado in my &#34;Reina Pepiada&#34; arepa was oxidized (brown) which led me to think my meal wasn&#39;t freshly prepared, and my father&#39;s steak was completely dried out.

This is the THIRD time I have visited to try and give the restaurant another chance. I&#39;m simply not impressed - especially after seeing my $75 bill. This place is totally not worth it - Invest in a better dining option."

My arepa $9 was well done, full of pork chunks, over salty, and seemed overpriced, if authentic.  I pay $5 for the same thing in Dallas.  An order of tostones, flat fried plaintains, also seemed right from venezuala, but didn&#39;t quit satisfy - I should have ordered maduros, although maybe it wasn&#39;t on the menu. 

A $20 lunch after tax and tip seemed a bit much for a budget meal, but after all this is Chelsea.

The food is tasty, but the portions are kinda skimpy. They do an okay job of &#34;fancying up&#34; some Latin food, but it just doesn&#39;t work for me. See below for some of my thoughts.

1) Sampling Platter - $19 - Featuring bite size crispy arepas, yucca fried, tostones, and a sampling of their arepas. Ok, this was the SMALLEST appetizer sampler I&#39;ve ever had! AND for $19 --ugh, not even worth it. Stay away from this one. Sure, it tasted okay, but I felt robbed by this one b/c of the price.

2) Chivo En Coco (stewed young goat in a coconut red &amp; green pepper sauce) - $18 - Tasty enough but super skimpy meat portion. It was mostly bone and full of fat. Sure, I know it&#39;s probably hard to conjure up some goat meat in the big city of NYC, but if you&#39;re gonna have it on your menu, make sure it&#39;s quality and plentiful.

As for the atmosphere and service, both were fine. The place is quaint, dark, and intimate inside, and the servers seem to be attentive and on top of things.

I called ahead to reserve a table at this relatively small restaurant which was a good idea. The table we were waiting for took awhile to wrap up so we ended up awkwardly standing around the entrance of the restaurant. Had it not been raining, we would have waited outside but this place is definitely not suited for comfortable waiting during inclement weather. Unfortunately, they also do not have a bar area that would be a good place to wait.

The servers were all very friendly and on top of their game. While waiting for a table, they were great at keeping us up to date about the status of our table, which I appreciated.

I ordered the Sancocho soup and the La Morrilla arepa. The soup was divine! I didn&#39;t know what to expect from the &#34;Short ribs and vegetables&#34; description, but it came in a clear, extremely flavorful, light broth with a nice chunk of shortrib (on the bone) which was very tender. It also came with a small piece of corn on the cob, carrots, and what I believe was yucca (definitely not potatoes). I could have eaten this soup all night!

My arepa was also delicious, though much richer than the soup. The stewed goat was ridiculously soft and tender, had some fatty bits (I am not complaining!), and good flavor. I didn&#39;t get as much of the &#34;coconut&#34; flavor they say it&#39;s stewed in, but it was still quite good. It would have been nice to see some crisp vegetables or something in the arepa, but not a big deal. I should reread the description the next time I go!

Overall, a great lively atmosphere, delicious food, and good service. Looking forward to eating here many more times."

The tables were pretty cramped indoors where they should have more outdoor seating. 

We ordered our food before the table next to us and how the fuck they got their Yuca Frita before us which was so fucked up then the server brought our food to the table next to us and they sent it back....Hello are you stupid...you don&#39;t know which table order what things!! When we finally got our Arepas and it was delicious. The person who took our order actually came to our table to see if we had ordered anything else. Seriously she completely forgot our Yuca Frita where I specifically stated as an Appetizer then one came out with our Yuca Frita then the other brought us the same thing. Lack of fucking communication between the people on the floor and cheap on napkins. 

Drinks: I ordered a Guarapita and my friend got Mango juice 

Appetizer: Yucca Frita...it was nothing special (the best ones are from Pinche Taqueria on Bleecker St.)

Food:
First round: I got the Arepa Pepito (my favorite) and my friend got the Arepa La Morillo and she loved it

Second round: I got the Arepa Pernil (as I was eating it and all the delicious juices from the slow roasted pork were dripping onto my plate) and my friend got the same thing

The food was tasty but the service was fucking shitty. I won&#39;t recommend spending your money here!!!! 

Why bother...other Arepa spots will treat every customer as equals not by how $$$ are they willing to spend!!!"
el-cocotero-new-york,Chris E.,m1AUK8tI19tUT_N3DMkyIQ,"Brooklyn, NY",1,1,1,380,7,RXlQI9_sAvnsXH0NUf2lNQ,3.0,2014-05-14,"My 1st Venezuelan food experience and not to my surprise IT WAS GOOD! I dropped by on a Friday night after work for dinner at around 6pm and it was almost completely empty inside, with a majority of the customers arriving after 7. The restaurant is pretty small, which DID surprise me, because in the pictures it looked a little bigger. It can probably seat only about 20-30 customers. Despite the sunlight outdoors seeping in thru the windows, I noticed the lack of lighting inside. I was under the assumption they were trying to save on their electricity bill, but when the night finally came, I guess our eyes became adjusted to the darkness and the candles did their jobs. It was definitely nice to be able to see our foods at least :)

As for the menu, it was quite robust, so it can be overwhelming. Both our waiter and waitress did a good job of explaining to us certain items we asked about. The waiter even informed us not to order the Venezuelan national dish! He told us he didn&#39;t like it and that we should order something else. We took his advice and ordered another entrée, but unfortunately he must&#39;ve jotted down that we wanted the Venezuelan national dish because THAT&#39;S WHAT ENDED UP WITH ON OUR TABLE! :( I looked at the dish for a second, took a few bites and realized it wasn&#39;t what I ordered, but instead of alerting them I actually kept it because I thought the dish was pretty good! So it worked out after all, without them even knowing they made that mistake. It probably would&#39;ve been a good idea if I at least informed them, but honestly, I was way too tired to make any deal out of it.

So anyhow, here&#39;s what we ordered:

---- APPETIZER
CARNE MACHADA CACHAPAS - Fresh Sweet Corn Pancake with Stewed Shredded Beef
The pancake was really really good! It was about 10 inches in diameter and very simple looking. The stew of shredded beef stuffing was in the middle of 2 sweet corn pancakes with melted cheese on the beef. The pancakes were very crunchy and the shredded beef was really well cooked. The melted cheese was a perfect compliment and added extra flavoring to each crispy bite.

---- ENTREES
VENEZUELAN NATIONAL DISH - White rice, black beans, sweet plantain &amp; shredded white fish
The waiter recommended that we not order this dish, but I actually was surprised at how good it was. Also, this was not the dish I ordered, but since they brought it to us I didn&#39;t make a big fuss and ate it. I really liked the shredded fish, which was to the side. It wasn&#39;t extremely flavorful, but there was nothing really bad about it. It tasted really fresh. The white rice with black beans and sweet plantains was pretty typical of my experience eating those 3 so I can&#39;t add much to that. It&#39;s not a knock, but instead it&#39;s what I expected it to taste like.

LA BANDEJA DOÑA BARBARA - Shredded beef, crackling pork rind, fried egg, rice, red beans, sweet plantain, chorizo &amp; avocado
This entrée wasn&#39;t mine, but I did get to try the cracking pork rind and chorizo. First, the crackling pork rind was excellent! It came out as a big strip of pork and it was very flavorful and easy to digest. It wasn&#39;t oily, but it was still juicy and I savored each and every bite! As for the chorizo, it was a bit disappointing. Basically it was a crisped piece of sausage, with a strange taste to it. I can&#39;t really describe it 100%, but it tasted burnt. Not charred burnt, but a smoky burnt.

Overall, the dishes were really good and it was a nice change from the monotony of American food. Although the dishes are similar to many different cuisines I&#39;ve tried in the past, there were little nuances that made them unique. The pancake was definitely the highlight of our night."

I decided on the pork lunch special. It included rice, beans and plantains. No complaints. In fact, it reminded me of my grandmother&#39;s cooking in Caracas. So did the dessert I chose, the Quesillo (YUM). Besides my drink having too much ice and the slow service (for an emptyish day), it was a much better visit.

We ordered the chips and black beans as an appetizer and they were great - the chips were thick and somewhat soft which was new to me but worked well. The bean dip was a very small portion, but it worked fine as there were just two of us. 

We both had the Miss Venezuela arepa (avocado and tomato) and the fried plantains as entrees. The arepa was delicious and filling, but a little salty, however, not enough to make it taste bad. The plantains were good as well. 

We left the restaurant full and satisfied, and the best part was that the entire meal was $29.40 (pre-tip)!  My sister and I both couldn&#39;t believe what a good deal the prices are for the quality and tastiness of the food."

I will say that I didn&#39;t have high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised with my arepa!

I chose the &#34;pabellon&#34; - shredded beef, black beans, sweet plantain, and grated white cheese. All the flavors complimented one another and the size of the arepa was a little bigger than I expected, that&#39;s a plus! 

I decided to have a dessert. I originally wanted to try the &#34;bienmesabe&#34; -sponge cake soaked in sweet coconut milk, topped with whipped coconut cream, and toasted coconut flakes, BUT sadly they had run out! :(

So I went with the &#34;3 leches&#34; - or 3 milk cake.. Which I&#39;ve had countless amount of times at different places..however, here it needed some more spongyness and a lot more milk. It was a bit on the dry side which is weird for a 3 leches. Was not my fave.

Food: I got the pabellon criollo for my main course and the portion was really big! I got the vegetarian option, which came with a few slices of tomatoes, avocado, and long strips of cheese (?). I don&#39;t know if $15 is worth a scoop of rice with beans and the &#34;veggies&#34;. My friends and I also got the appetizer sampler, which I thought was much more unique and interesting. Again, don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth $20 though. 

Service: Subpar. Waiter was a little rude when we were ordering food, telling us to make up our minds and then call him back, when we were obviously all ready. We wanted to order the special drink of the night, but then the waiter told us they ran out of rum. Okay, so then I wanted to order a papaya milkshake -- it totally caught my eye. I flagged down the waiter and he said they were out of milk. What? Plus, they never came to refill our waters unless I had to raise my hand and ask for more water.

A beef stew plate with rice and beans and a slice of burnt tasting flan cost me $27. This was a take out meal and I was very unsatisfied! The texture of the flan wasn&#39;t amazing.

For $27, I was pretty disappointed :("

I&#39;ve have better food than I&#39;ve had there, but the problem wasn&#39;t the food; it was the service. 

I&#39;ve been to many place with food was about average, but what I experienced at this establishment was something that should never occur to anyone. I&#39;m not going to mention that fact that I&#39;m Hispanic or play the race card, but other tables that were white or looked like they had money were treated better. 1st the guy didn&#39;t provide menus (I had to ask for one). Other people that got there after us got their menus before us. 

2nd no type of assistance; when attempting to inquire about anything they seemed annoyed. 

3rd Who serves guacamole in a shot glass. You can&#39;t possibly dip chip in a shot glass. Presentation sucks!!!!

4th never during did any one approach to see if we were alright, in fact, I had to ask for a drink 5 minutes after my food was served (none of that concierge treatment). 

5th when asked for a check, waiter brought check and rudely tossed it without any acknowledgement or thanking for business. 

I have never experience such horrible service. If you&#39;re interested in good Venezuelan food; go to Caracas or Aripo Cafe (great service and very interested in your business)."

Food: Good, but nothing super amazing. For my entree I got the Pollo al Horno (orange glazed, slow roasted chicken with fried yucca and salad). Chicken was tasty and well-roasted, and the subtle orange flavor went well with the dish. My friends each got the Pabellon dish and were all satisfied with it.

Service: Subpar. Our waiter was pushy and made things a bit uncomfortable - he kept asking if we wanted appetizers, drinks, specials, etc. after we had already declined. But more importantly, when I ordered I clearly stated the exact name of my dish (Pollo al Horno), and even repeated it, to avoid any miscommunication (since my friends each got the Pabellon dish and I thought he might assume I was getting it as well). Yet he still brought me the Pabellon, and I had to send it back and ask for the one I originally ordered.

Atmosphere: Pretty dimly lit, good Spanish music, and fairly empty that night. My 3 friends and I were at a corner table which was a bit small for the 4 of us, definitely a cozy fit. Between the lighting and the space restrictions, this restaurant is probably best for a date or close friends rather than acquaintances.

Overall impression: Food was decent and the portion was large, but for me the poor service put a damper on the meal (and I don&#39;t usually let poor service detract from my enjoyment of the food, but in this case it did). I&#39;d be willing to give it another try and revise my rating in the future, but I&#39;m not rushing back."

I can enjoy a borderline surly waitress who mocks my bad Spanish accent any day, but waiting an hour for even our appetizer (which ended up accompanying our entrees instead) was a little much. Especially since our arepas showed up a little cold outside the wrappers, as if they&#39;d been sitting for awhile... I&#39;d still go back, though. There are tons of gluten-free options, and variety is all I can really ask for. And truth be told, I like the rips in the booths-- feels like Trenton (home)."

Pros:
-good fast service
-even though it&#39;s a small place, they have a clean restroom 
-their arepas looked pretty good (too bad I didn&#39;t order any...)
-ordered their special cocktail for the night (mango/passion fruit with diff kinds of alcohol) and it was extremely strong! 

Cons:
-their fried cheese appetizer sucked so bad. It was pretty much four mini cheese sticks wrapped in egg roll skin, fried, and there you go $7ish bucks
-I got one of their pancake dishes and the entree had a sweet taste to it (even though it&#39;s with meat). Didn&#39;t like it and portion was tiny
-kind of dark so it was hard to read the menu (good thing they have tiny candles...)
-the food sanitation post says Grade Pending on the outside but I saw a grade C posted on their bulletin board near the kitchen so I&#39;m not sure why that isn&#39;t posted at the front...probably to hide the C :/"

Maybe everyone was getting ready for dinner service or just on break but service was slow and awkward. The servers weren&#39;t really friend or welcoming and actually a bit rude. Lucky for them the food was quite good.

Definitely a fun place to bring a group no more than 3-4 in Chelsea; it&#39;s a tiny place.  Probably the most cramped place I have Ever been to. I came here with two friend and boyfriend. We had a reservation at 8 PM on Friday, it was fairly easy to make one earlier that day by phone. However some of us were really late so we lost her table and had to to wait to be seated around 830.

Our waiter was big on making sure that we got here quickly because he knew that we had a reservation. The service is Friendly, our waiter was really charismatic,&#34; he said that this is Chelsea boys first when it came to ordering haha.&#34;  He definitely missed some things, such as bringing our waters out quickly, and drinking our wine  glasses when  ordered a pitcher of the drink special. The pitcher  had some kind of tequila passionfruit guava juice Concoction- I wasn&#39;t drinking that night, so I didn&#39;t have any but I heard that it was good. It was actually not very expensive either only about $30 for a pitcher that could feed four. 

Now moving onto the food, the appetizers we got were really good. we got the Venezuelan mozzarella stick type things, but they were so much better than mozzarella sticks because they were fried at the right temperature and so they were not overly greasy or oily. The cheese inside was also still pretty firm, Which I really enjoyed.  They came with a really flavorful tomato creamy sauce.  An even better side, is the yucca fries that we got.  They were also not overly fried or greasy which means they were cooked at just the right temperature. He was super flavorful and team is an amazing tahini type sauce and guacamole. 
 
Moving onto the entrées, I got the national Venezuelan dish with chicken, it  super slow cooked chicken breast with black beans. The beans had a lot of flavor,  I think they were cooked with bay leaves. The white rice was flavorful and I especially like the sweet plantains, which are always good. It was the Right amount of food and a good value at $14. 

If you do come here though, I think you should get an arepa, or one of the other specialty stuffed pockets (like an empanada, capacha... I can&#39;t spell). Those seem to be quite the specialty, and quite stuffed as well. That&#39;s what two of my friends got.  I would&#39;ve like to try the patacon, which is a stuffed Sandwich mean with plantains. My boyfriend got the regular pressed sandwich with slow roasted pork, he said it was a little dry. I also thought my chicken was dry so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just how they cook it. The sandwich that he got was sort of similar to a Cuban sandwich. 

All in all this is a really fun place and fun atmosphere, the food is not too expensive, they have Good drinks, and it&#39;s definitely above average though perhaps not the best food I ever had. I would be willing to give it Another Chance. Food and drink in total came to about 20 dollars per person"

The food isn&#39;t actually that bad. It&#39;s more that this place is poorly run and over-priced. When you throw in other establishments like Guayoyo into the mix, it makes things very clear. 

First visit wasn&#39;t bad, but mainly because we were so homesick for Miami that you could have thrown salsa music on pretty much anywhere and we would have been in love. The next couple times we tried to come they were under construction, the next two times we tried (one we left, the other we stayed) they had lost their ability to run cards-cash only. The last visit we were craving Venezuelan and starved which is a really hard scenario to mess up, however mediocre food, blah service and $5 for a Tbs of Guasacaca killed it for us- for good.

Such a shame because it&#39;s walking distance..."

They have happy hour specials, including appetizers for 5 dollars, beer for 4, wine for 5. I had 2 duck buns for 5 bucks; the duck was plentiful, the buns were fluffy, and it went great with the sauce and cucumber slices. 

The creamy tom yum soup was amazing. I grew up in Southeast Asia and Thai places in the States usually have tom yum that is way too sweet with not enough heat, but this tom yum soup is legit.

It&#39;s definitely not your average pad thai spicy - I was sniffling into napkins and coughing within a few bites of the green curry. Eating mouthfuls of brown rice did not help at all. 

However, the massaman curry was transcendent. Instead of the long, chewy pieces of meat that Asian places usually stick into their beef dishes, Malii uses these big beautiful chunks that get soaked into the curry and break apart.

Unfortunately, gobbling most of the massaman curry (combined with the ridiculous spiciness of the green curry) meant chugging a ridiculous amount of water and walking around with a bloated belly for the next day. I think I may try to make my own curries to tamp down on the salt, but I&#39;ll go to Malii if a friend is craving something warm and soupy.

We came by for lunch because they have some great lunch specials. The lunch combos come with a salad, appetizer, and an entree, with a good variety of both appetizers and entrees to choose from. 

I went with the spring rolls and the pad thai, as per usual, and was not disappointed. I really loved the dressing of the salad, the spring rolls were perfectly crunchy and drenched in a nice sweet and sour sauce, and the portion of the pad thai was perfect for lunch. All in all, it was a solid meal for less than $10 (although I forgot to redeem the 10% off Yelp check-in coupon).

I really wanted to love this place due to raving recommendations, but unfortunately, they fell short in terms of service. We were told that the last entree would be coming &#39;soon&#39;, but 15-20 minutes later, after most of us were close to finishing our meals, it still had not arrived. I&#39;m not sure if it was because the kitchen just opened (opens at 11:30AM and we arrived at 12PM) or if they were short on ingredients, but I feel like this should have been explained or at least apologized for.

The menu was pretty standard for what you would expect at a Thai place, and the prices were super reasonable.

After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the red curry which came with rice. While the portion size was pretty large (it lasted me two meals), the flavor was not up to the standards of many other Thai places I have been to. It was almost like the curry had too much oil in it or something because it was already sort of separating even before I took a bite.

the chicken in my pad thai was rubbery. i burn water and even i know how to make chicken. the crispy pork larb was salty (per the man friend). i tried it and it didn&#39;t taste all that salty, perhaps simply because some parts were doused in that lime sauce and some weren&#39;t. we will just blame the man friend for failing to thoroughly mix. 

the saving grace? papaya salad was awesome and the waitress was sweet/accommodating. oh, and man friend got his favorite drink, iced tea with lemon juice? 

maybe it deserves a second chance.

btw, don&#39;t sit underneath the AC, it&#39;ll leak on you."

This is one of THE best I&#39;ve had! I ordered food to go. The staff was friendly and helpful despite coming in at nearly closing. We ordered the Stuffed Chicken Wing and Kao Tung as appetizers, the must-try dishes on the menu of Prik Khing Crispy Pork Belly and the Curry Noodle as well as a side of Coconut Sticky Rice. We loved EVERYTHING we ordered. The only thing I will warn you is the &#34;spicy&#34; is HOT!!! It&#39;s possible they accidentally made my curry noodle &#34;very spicy,&#34; but to be safe I will order it medium next time. Also, the curry noodle dish is quite large and can feed two. So portion size is great! Malii has incredible Thai dishes and I will be coming back here all the way from Flatbush to enjoy it again. Forget kissing the cook, marry him/her!"

It was amazing, and staff is very kind. They listed the duck pineapple curry outside as a special, though, and when the bill came it was $18.95, as it appears on the menu, so I was a little confused.

With all restaurants that deliver, this tends to happen from time to time. What makes this restaurant stand out from the rest is how thoughtful and responsive they were in fixing their mistake. When I spoke with them on the phone, they were extremely apologetic and wanted to know what they could do to resolve the problem quickly.

After telling them that it was ok and that if they just sent the Thai iced tea, everything would be fine. When the delivery man arrived, he apologized for the mistake and presented me with a Thai iced tea AND an order to dumplings with a note from the restaurant apologizing again for the issue.

Needless to say, the pad Thai and green curry that we ordered was delicious and the dumplings superb.

Malii really went above and beyond to satisfy the customer as this type of service is tough to find in NYC.

Will definitely be going back."

It&#39;s almost like the restaurants that deliver to El Barrio contemptuously prepare sub par food figuring the income/taste level is so low it won&#39;t matter. Had hope that Malli, situated at 105th, might have more respect for customers and was not entirely disappointed. The Duck Noodle Soup had generous portion of tender duck slices, the Pork and Shrimp Dumpling not bad, and although Crispy Pork Belly a bit tough it was acceptable.

Known as a Scottish bar, there&#39;s obviously a large selection of whiskeys, but also a cocktail menu and great bears on tap. There are two sides of this place, the larger is the bar area and then on the side is a small dining area. I&#39;ve eaten here once and the food was great. Scottish fare with a gourmet feel. 

But mostly my friends and I come here to end our long nights out with a drink and a conversation with our fellow bargoers. We almost always have a very interesting night at highlands."

First time going here and was with friends for dinner. When you first walk in a hostess greats you, and seats you at a table that&#39;s available. Their drink menu is extensive, not surprising for a place that serves Scottish influenced food and drinks. The décor is incredible, you feel like you&#39;re in a rustic pub complete with wooden tables, and benches.  We had a few starters, such as the mushroom toast with soft boiled egg and the Burrata. Both were delicious, especially the yolk mixing with the mushrooms... freaking incredible. And the green tomatoes of the Burrata.

Then the main course, my friends had the cider braised pork shank, pan seared scallops while I opted for the roasted chicken breast salad. Each of us sharing a lil from each other&#39;s plates. All three dishes were cooked to perfection although  the dressing for the salad was a bit tart, definitely could&#39;ve went with something more savory.

It&#39;s a very cozy atmosphere, with exposed brick, animal heads on the walls, dim lighting and candles.

We never make reservations for dinner. We always just walk in and get seated. The bar area is also great to hang out in before dinner in the west village or just as a casual night out.

BAR/RESTAURANT OVERVIEW:
-Bar in the front room with a few tables, then more tables in the back room
-Great for drinks or food with friends

APPS:
-Blue Crab Spread on Toast: So good! And great to split between 2 people or even 4 if you split the toasts in half. 
-Whisky Bread: Really good with spiced/sweet butter

DINNER:
-Roasted Chicken Breast: So good! Comes with a tasty glaze, brussel sprouts, and potatoes

DRINKS:

I came by as a friend who lives near the place wanted to meetup here before her date. I came by around 6:30 pm to meet with her as we link up every time I come to NYC. She had a seat at the bar and lucky for me the couple sitting next to her were getting up to leave so that opened up a seat for me in which I thanked them for. My friend knew the bartender/bar manager whose name is Andrey (how its spelled on my receipt) and he was a pretty cool guy...very conversational and chill which is cool for me as I knew my friend would be leaving for her date and I would chill for awhile before meeting up with other friends in Hell&#39;s Kitchen later. Andrey made us some pretty good drinks especially the scotch old fashioned in which I had a few of in addition to 12 year Yamazaki  single malt Japanese scotch. I was having a great time! After my friend left, I was sitting alone for maybe 10 minutes and then a gentlemen who also knew the bartender/bar manager showed up and sat in the vacant seat. He and I had a great conversation about a lot of things....again I was having a blast in this joint. The gentleman that was sitting next to me was quite the smoker so he kept going outside to spark a cig every 30 mins. Every time he left someone would come and grab his seat and order and once he came back he would tell them he was sitting there drinking and they would do the right thing and give him the seat back.

I finally had to go to the bathroom and got up for not more than 2 minutes. As I came back to my seat, a girl had taken it. The guy I had been hanging with for about an hour had said to her &#34;hey my friend was sitting there and he just went to the bathroom&#34;...she could care less as she ignored him and continued to talk to her 2 friends. I then decided to ask her for my seat back and she turned around and looked at me like I was crap. I asked again and of course same result. I got tired of asking her so I took the seat from her and of course she then wanted to speak to me and of course not in the most proper manner. We had a back and forth for about 5-10 mins as her friends decided to join in the argument to make comments about the situation. I imagine she could have acknowledged my presence and gave me my seat and possibly had given me the option to give her my seat or patiently wait for me to finish my drink and then give to her as the bar is now crowded and standing space sucks..not to mention I had a pinched nerve at the time and standing for awhile in a crowded space is no fun at that point. What I would have expected to happen was that Andrey (bartender/bar manager) could have told her to give me my seat as he saw me sitting there for well over an hour having drinks. That didnt happen as I found myself being escorted out of the place by the doorman. I assumed the 3 ladies would be leaving out behind me since they were being a$$holes, but no, they&#39;re punishment was that he would not serve them for an hour...WTF???? Again he had the opportunity to defuse the situation when he saw my drink sitting there as I came back and saw her in the seat. I can explain in the next paragraph how and why all of this happened.

As I stood outside conversing with the hostess and the doorman that escorted me out, they told me the main girl (the one that took my seat) gets special treatment from Andrey quite often. They saw the whole thing and agreed that was f&#39;ed up what happened to me. I was told whenever there is a line outside and she shows up, they just call Andrey and get in ahead of everyone. I&#39;m all for treating regulars a little special but sometimes you have to be fair. This is why she felt she could take another patron&#39;s seat as she is used to getting her way in Highlands at the expense of other patrons and Andrey has obviously made her feel &#34;privileged&#34; enough to know she could do whatever she wanted and basically say f me. This is what happens when you give certain regulars the notion that they run the place. I had to assume he was basically sleeping with her for the fact he allowed her to just do what she did. Funny thing is that he wound up having to throw her out as she and her friends got quite upset that they were just sitting at the bar and could not get served for an hour. Other patrons at the bar came out and told me what happened as they saw the whole thing. Afterwards I saw Andrey come outside and I just wanted to shake his hand and say hey man no hard feelings and all he  could do was say &#34;I&#39;m not taking any sides&#34; and avoided shaking my hand. I was not asking for him to take sides but wanted to say hey no big deal. I wanted to tell him I would come back again as I mentioned my friend lives nearby and the drinks were good. After his snub of just showing me a little bit of showmanship, I basically decided this place is off limits to me going forward. My friend will have to meet me elsewhere when I hit NYC."

The drinks are fantastic, delicious, and strong. I haven&#39;t had the food yet, but I&#39;ve been told by picky friends and that it&#39;s really good!

Be careful of what time you go because it gets packed in there. Go early, or expect a big crowd and to have to hover in the middle of the room for a while. If you wait long enough, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get a seat."

The Scotch Egg was the only winner on the share plate.
The Angus Flatiron was cooked a proper medium rare with a bit too much sauce. 
The Haggis (starter size) was a letdown with not enough haggis, or haggis flavor.
The whiskey (e theirs) bread pudding boasted almost no boozy flavor, and looked identical in shape to the chocolate molten cake (which wasn&#39;t molten at all) which came with a very boozy bourbon ice cream to offset the disappointing bread pudding.

Haggis, cranachan, the wallpaper of the man shooting heroin in the bathroom ... Oh.. Scotland. 

Now let&#39;s talk about the whisky menu - I mean whisky book. I could spend a whole day poring through those pages - if you like scotch, you&#39;ll love this. If you&#39;ve never tried scotch, and you&#39;d like to know more, you&#39;d also love this menu. The staff are also so knowledgable and helpful about finding a good pairing for your tastes.

All in all, I&#39;m sold. It brings me back to Edinburgh - somewhere between Grassmarket and the Cowgate with the class of New Town. And on top of that, who can complain about an establishment that has a flight of grilled cheese sandwiches."

Drinks: Kith and Kin cocktail; Appetizer: Whiskey bread, curried humus, Scotch egg, Pearl barley risotto, blue crab and prawns on toast; Mains: beef wellington, whiskey barrel pork chop; Dessert: molten cake, and creme brulee

OK That was really tiring...

Out of the appetizers I tried, I&#39;d recommend the risotto,whiskey bread, and blue crab and prawns on toast (in that order). The risotto was amazing and you could really taste the whiskey in the bread.  The humus and the scotch egg were fine, but nothing special.  For my main, I had the pork chop (delicious) and I tried my sister&#39;s beef wellington.  Both were great but think the pork chop was better. If you&#39;re deciding between the two (their 2 most popular I think), go with the pork chop! I also LOVED the kith and kin cocktail. I tried other people&#39;s cocktails in my party and they all seemed great actually. I really liked the cozy scottish ambiance of the dining area as well.

I think I would have given this place 5 stars, but I was a bit disappointed in the service. The service was fairly attentive, but our waiter seemed a little annoyed with us right from the get-go and said a couple of strange, insulting things.

All in all, I&#39;d recommend."

(FYI, they don&#39;t seat you unless your entire party is there). The dining area is pretty small but even so, it wasn&#39;t completely filled. There always seemed to be that one empty table while we were dining. The bar on the other hand, was packed. It seems like that&#39;s the more popular option. And why wouldn&#39;t it be? They have a book of whiskey, that&#39;s about 50 pages thick, some creative whiskey (and non-whiskey) cocktails, and a good selection of Scottish beers.

For drinks, I had the Skull Splitter (bottle), which tasted kind of caramelly - so you definitely want to be careful with this one. If you don&#39;t feel it immediately, it will hit you later. I also had the Mamie Taylor cocktail, which is Great King St. Artist&#39;s Blend scotch, Pickett&#39;s ginger beer, and lime. I normally don&#39;t drink cocktails because they&#39;re always too sweet. But if I do order one, it will most likely be a cocktail with whiskey in it. This one tasted very refreshing. I love ginger beer, so I really liked this drink.

For food, we started with a Scotch egg. This is the second Scotch egg that I&#39;ve had in life. My first experience wasn&#39;t a great one but I was determined to find one that I liked - and from the pictures that you Yelpers posted, the one at the Highlands looked amazing. And it was just that. The sausage was flavorful, but not overly salty. The yolk was perfect - still runny but not messily so. It came with this A1-like dipping sauce on the side but I would say you&#39;re better off without it. You don&#39;t need it at all. In fact, the sauce kinda ruins it, IMO.

I went with the seared tuna for my entree. The fish went really well with the bed of grains that it was served with. The grains almost remind me of popcorn kernels. (I don&#39;t remember what they were and I can&#39;t find it online either - so if anyone orders this and finds out what these are, let me know!). I wanted something light since I wasn&#39;t very hungry, so this was the perfect choice for me.

For dessert, we all shared the gelato. It comes with three scoops and you have a choice of rhubarb. bourbon. blackberry, pomegranate, and hazelnut. We ordered the bourbon, blackberry and pomegranate. The bourbon only had the slightest hint of whiskey in there. The other two didn&#39;t taste like anything. They all tasted more like sorbet than they did gelato, and it had this gritty texture to it, which I didn&#39;t like. You&#39;re probably better off ordering something else, or skipping dessert altogether. 

It seems as though their menu changes pretty frequently, since the menu I saw online vs. the one at the restaurant were pretty different. I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back for another Scotch egg and maybe a flight (or five) of some whiskey!"

We had: whiskey bread with scotch butter, a homemade sausage plate that wasn&#39;t on the menu but was a special for the evening, beef Wellington for my entree and my friend bad the wild boar gnocchi, and bread pudding for dessert. 

It was all amazing. 

The whiskey bread was warm and the scotch butter was a little sweet. The sausage was spicy and savory. And the beef Wellington. It melted in my mouth and I had to fight to keep from licking the plate. I tried her gnocchi and the wild boar was a buttery consistency and the gnocchi was moist and flavorful. 

We were stuffed by the bread pudding had homemade whipped cream and a banana Carmel overlay with a delicious cream sauce underneath - he warned me that it would take about 15 minutes because they make each one individually. It was worth it. Again. Almost licked the plate. 

It was crowded and seating was a little tight and limited, but all of that was a good sign that these people knew what they&#39;re doing in the kitchen. I would definitely go back again."

I get it, Saturday nights are probably not the most enjoyable time to be working at a bar in the West Village, but I feel like I could have gotten over the packed space and the less-than-ideal clientele if the staff had at least been friendly. But I feel like no matter where I moved, someone was barking at me, and more often than not it was the bartender. I get you can&#39;t control who frequents your bar, but at least be polite to everyone in there.

Drinks were pretty average, and about as pricy as everything else in the area. I feel like this bar could easily morph into almost any other hip bar in the Village and I wouldn&#39;t notice. So sorry Highlands, but I can&#39;t recommend you."

The restaurant wasn&#39;t very packed and they were very accommodating. We were seated in one of the nooks where it&#39;s almost like sitting on a windowsill.  With excellent views for people watching and the shrubbery enclosing on the windows it felt magical.  Our waiter was splendid, he was patient, attentive and very informative. We made note that Lapin had a lactose issue and they were able to swap out a couple of things in his food for him.

We ordered the blue crab and prawn toast ($16), a bit on the pricey side but it came with a generous stuffing of meat on a piece of bread. I do wish they gave one more sliver of bread though.  Lapin ordered the whisky barrel smoked pork chop ($26) and he got mashed potatoes instead of mac and cheese. He said the meat was succulent and tasty. I ordered the crispy red seared grouper ($25) but they ran out and I got the striped sea bass instead. It was still a very delicious entree.  We got the Molten Lava Cake ($8) but instead of Bourbon we asked for Hazelnut gelato instead. Lapin had to take 8 lactose pills but still wanted to eat every single drop of that hazelnut gelato. The food was amazing, the service top-notch, and the ambience magical. It&#39;s definitely worth the trip but go early, the place gets crowded quite quickly."

One note - this isn&#39;t the bar to visit if you&#39;re looking to meet lots of new people and/or singles. Both times I&#39;ve gone, people are congregated in medium-sized groups and everyone seems to know each other. Mingling culture doesn&#39;t really exist here (it&#39;s a little small for that, anyway). Not necessarily a con, just a note. 

Service: Great. Servers and bartenders are knowledgable and friendly. On a Saturday night between 10-12, that earns you major props. Because this place gets CROWDED. The first time I came here, it was around the end of happy hour on a Thursday night - also packed. So clearly, this place is popular. If you want to get a seat here, you&#39;re probably best off making a reservation. I did that this time with my sister - mostly because we wanted to order food as well as drinks - and it was relatively painless. 

Now for the ingestibles:

THE DRINKS. YES. I&#39;m a big speakeasy fan so I&#39;m a sucker for a well-crafted cocktail, and this place doesn&#39;t disappoint. My sister is a bartender, so we only looked at places that could interest her expert palette. My first drink was The Great Western: vanilla infused bourbon, st. george spiced pear, lemon. My sister doesn&#39;t like whiskey, and even she liked it. Absolutely a must-try. My second was The Catholic Guilt - black grouse blended, ginger, lemon, fig &amp; orange bitters, fernet branca float - though I substituted bourbon  for scotch (please don&#39;t judge, I have no control over this preference....or I suppose non-preference). Also delicious. My sister ordered the Sweet Ginger Brown - goslings dark rum, lime, ginger, brown sugar, ginger ale - did I say delicious yet? There are so many glowing adjectives, people. 

To eat:
Highlands Scotch Egg
Drunken Mussels

Now, I grew up on Martha&#39;s Vineyard seafood (literally sea-to-table cuisine) so these muscles weren&#39;t anything to write home about. That said, they weren&#39;t bad, and a nice surprise on a bar menu. The Scotch egg was also decent. I didn&#39;t *love* it but I thought the preparation was fun and unique to this particular establishment. Overall though, I get the sense that we should have opted for different food, but the drinks/experience made the visit more than worthwhile."

My best friend and I stopped by before an event at another whiskey bar/gastropub. I ordered--I know this will surprise everyone--Scotch. Highlands&#39; whisky list isn&#39;t as large as other places, but it is well curated. Maybe more importantly, the waitstaff have a deep knowledge of both list and off-list whiskies. I ordered a Kilchoman madeira-aged Scotch, which was tremendous. 

For food, I had a scotch egg, whist my best friend had a hamburger. Both were lovely. We had a few minutes before we needed to scootch, so we both had sticky toffee pudding, which was also quite lovely.

As noted above, the waitstaff was eminently knowledgeable about the whisky list. Additionally, service was prompt and friendly.

In all, a successful visit, and would happily go back here again.

But why only four stars? That party at another whiskey bar? I wanted to have it at Highlands. I called during opening hours, left a message, and never heard back."

My husband and I used to come here for special occasions when we first moved to NY around 2010. We then moved to Scotland for a few years and just came back to NY and pleasantly surprised to see the quality of this place hasn&#39;t changed. The decor is Scottish/rustic chic and the food is always very good. The last two times, I&#39;ve had the chicken and it was excellent. The whisky list is extensive and quality.  The staff knows the whisky list inside and out and always super welcoming. There&#39;s also a nice bar area for drinks that is great as well. The space is rather intimate and not huge, so ideal for a date night or a group of 4."

The burrata salad, duck breast and pork chops were well treated and presented beautifully.  All of them were packed with freshness and so much juicy flavor. Please leave space for the chocolate lava dessert, which is accompanied by a creamy bourbon ice-cream. I can&#39;t wait to go back again!"

A friend and I went once to get the scotch tasting flight, which was fantastic and reasonably priced, and once to grab cocktails. The bread pudding was excellent and I really enjoyed the grilled cheese appetizer. The grilled cheeses were much better and more innovative than I expected. You can&#39;t beat the scotch selection and the bar is especially cozy in the winter. The second time we went, there was a free vodka cocktail event going on, which seemed odd but was fun.

Great drink selection across the board - if you&#39;re craving something, they&#39;ll have it - if you don&#39;t know what you want, it will jump out at you and you&#39;ll know the universe put you in the perfect spot to get a little tipsy with someone you have a crush on. Staff is super friendly and don&#39;t put that NYC pressure on -- they give you time to enjoy the last bite, stare at your date as she sips her wine and think too hard about what you want for dessert. They won&#39;t get mad when you eventually end up just asking for the bill. 

The real MVP is the food -- wow. As my date said, there&#39;s a fine line between too much salt and not enough salt and they absolutely nailed it. Every bite was a pleasant surprise - each one a pretty little melody in my mouth. Highly recommend the striped bass. 

Will definitely go back and would absolutely recommend. Only wish it wasn&#39;t as loud as it is but that&#39;s easy to ignore when everything else just feels so right."

Highlights of the meal included:
    - Excellent gastropub fare
    - Prawns on Toast and Beef Wellington, in particular, outshined the rest
    - Unmatched whiskey selection and well priced for rare finds (new favorite on recommendation from bar tender)
    - Above and beyond service

Downsides:
    - The bar (separate room from dining) seemed crazy crowded. I probably wouldn&#39;t come for just a drink."

We started off with a few of their unique cocktails which were a bit expensive but similar to other places in the area).  Next we ordered some bar appetizers.  I must say this was some REAL GOOD bar food.  We started with oysters which were SO CREAMY, I have not had oysters like this in a while.  Next up were some lobster sliders which were absolutely delicious, I would come back JUST for these.  Some grilled cheese with different types of cheese was up next, very unique and tasty.

It&#39;s tiny, you might be able to split between 3 people (if you&#39;re not super hungry) but safer for 2 people. 

The scotch egg is seasoned really well, crispy, and overall delicious BUT after having tried other scotch eggs in the city I think it&#39;s overpriced. 

That pretty much summarizes my experience here. The stew was about 30, the pan fried chicken was around 28 and while tasty... just over priced. 

Summary: if you don&#39;t mind throwing down the cash you&#39;ll enjoy it."

The waiter was helpful and thoughtful with helping us choose our scotch/single malt whiskey from a very informative menu. When our drinks arrived, he also provided a little carafe of water and a cup of ice cubes with mini tongs. I thought that was a great touch because I mostly don&#39;t trust that that bartenders put in the right amount of water.

Prices range base on what you order, ($14-$30ish)

Since we already ate a bunch of appetizers before getting here (fatties, I know), we only ordered one appetizer to share, then two entrees.

Whipped ricotta pot: sliced baguette, whipped creamy fluffy ricotta, a tiny dish of honey, and crispy jamon. Putting it together creates a great texture of creamy and crispy. Flavor wise, it&#39;s salty, sweet and buttery. We actually asked for more bread. ($10)

Braised shortrib: crispy creamy horseradish potato croquettes, braised shortrib that was tender juicy and flavorful because of the rich sauce, brussels sprouts leaves, pearl onions, and shaved parsnips.  A well composed dish that was filling and at an affordable price ($25). Since I ate too much earlier, I couldn&#39;t finish and had to ask for it to.be packed. 

My friend got the beef wellington; the steak was well seasoned, and the puff pastry was buttery but slightly more dense than flakey. Overall it&#39;s a very big entree and a lot of food ($32).

Overall, it&#39;s loud inside, so it was hard to hear my friend. I would suggest not coming here for an intimate conversation.   Delicious food, nice long scotch list, and great service."

First off, the menu is simply amazing. Not only is the selection excellent, but the menu is less of a menu and more of a Scotch Bible. Each kind of scotch is described in tremendous detail (pronunciation guide included), from the history to the geography and more. As a budding scotch enthusiast, this was very much appreciated and made for an even more enriching experience.

My friend and I each opted for one of the flights (3 scotches each), he the Smoky Flight and I the Second Flight. Our server went through the trouble of explaining each of the scotches before us, describing the aging of the scotch as well as the flavor profiles we should expect. We expected none of this service, but this again added to our tasting experience. He even brought out the bottles so we could take pictures or observe the labels.

The space itself is beautiful, with bottles lining the walls and plenty of separation between the bar and the tables. I will definitely be back soon, not only for another round of drinks, but also to give their intriguing menu a try."

If that&#39;s any indication on how the full meals are, then it is absolutely DELICIOUS!

Whisky bread and whipped ricotta pot are my standard appetizer choice.  The shepherd&#39;s pie is hearty with delicate sensibilities.  I appreciate the veggie options so I can chow down with my bangers &amp; mash friends.  Dessert rocks.

I&#39;m thankful the dining room wall is thick enough to muffle the west village bar.  Music selection may be the one weak link from my perspective - a French-influenced Scottish establishment could serenade us with a more interesting playlist."

We arrived there a little before 9PM and I could already see that this was a popular place among young white adults, especially for those who want to mingle or impress a date.

When we walked in, the restaurant was really loud. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because the entrance is near the bar that has really loud music or because everyone was trying to talk over one another or not, but it was really loud. I personally don&#39;t like really loud restaurants - it&#39;s distracting to the conversation. Also, the lights were dim and each table had a candle (I suppose for the romantic candle-light dinner date effect), but I&#39;m not a huge fan of that either because I&#39;m clumsy and I&#39;m afraid of causing a catastrophic fire. Plus you can&#39;t really see what your food looks like.

We were led to a table in the back of the restaurant section, near the bathroom. It was a little crowded, but it was right where the servers came in and out of the kitchen - perfect for grabbing someone&#39;s attention. We got the menu (which was only a piece of paper ... what did I say about the catastrophic fire??) and the drink book, but opted to drink water throughout the night. Since my friend had just gotten paid and I had just survived another intense week of graduate school, we decided to go all out on ordering. We ended up ordering the scotch egg, the crab and prawns on toast, and the risotto for appetizers. For the main course, my friend had the skirt steak and I had the chicken breast.

The appetizers came out all at once, which was great. Since our table was small, it was a bit difficult to fit all three appetizers and our sharing plates without worrying about whether or not one of them was going to fall. My friend and I quickly mediated this situation by splitting the crab and prawns on toast and putting the empty plate under one of the other plates. I have to say ... the crabs and prawns on toast was the best thing I have eaten in a LONG time. The flavors of the crabs and prawns, mixed with the deliciousness of garlic bread with a squirt of lime really made my mouth explode in a flavor of amazingness. Wow. I would definitely recommend anyone coming here to get that (unless you&#39;re allergic to seafood, then, don&#39;t).

Next, we split the scotch egg. I was excited to try this because it looked really good in the article. My friend and I split the fried ball shaped scotch egg in two and dug in. After eating the crab and prawns on toast, I have to say, I was underwhelmed with the scotch egg. Maybe it was because I just had a divine appetizer or because I&#39;m not a die-hard egg fan, but I thought the scotch egg was just okay. The crunchy fried coating was great, but the egg itself was kind of eh. Lied to by an internet article, how disappointing.

Lastly, we ate the risotto. All of this time, I thought that risotto was a type of pasta but apparently, it&#39;s a rice/grain product. Wow, I&#39;m so uncultured. But anyway, the risotto had shrimp mixed in and it was delicious. I&#39;m not sure what the flavors were but it was kind of creamy among other things, and I can&#39;t really articulate it in a way that I really want to, but know that it&#39;s delicious. Wouldn&#39;t say its a MUST HAVE, but I definitely liked it better than the scotch egg.

After we finished our appetizers, our main courses came out shortly. My friend&#39;s skirt steak was juicy and delicious, and compared to a lot of skirt steaks I&#39;ve had, this one was pretty great. My chicken breast was tender and juicy, and overall delicious, but it was so salty. My friend and I both grimaced while eating the chicken skin, it was extremely salty. I think it probably would have been more bearable if it came with a side of rice or something, but it didn&#39;t so I had to suck it up. While I was eating, all I could think of was &#34;damn, is this what white people call seasoned chicken?&#34; I&#39;m sure that chicken had more salt than the Red Sea. It was good, but super salty. Probably would not get that again.

Overall, while I was eating, I would have given this place 5/5 stars because the food was really good. What detracted from my experience was the following:

1. water was lukewarm (ew)
2. chicken was salty as fuck
3. waitress forgot about us when we asked for more water"

For my birthday celebration on a Saturday night I was able to call ahead that morning (I procrastinated I know) and reserve a small area in the front of the restaurant, near the bar, for 10 people. The spot was absolutely perfect. We were able to be served quickly and we could easily choose to sit or stand. We ordered the cheese plate and grilled cheese to nosh on and both were delicious.

Drink, you say? You want a drink? A stiff scotch or a fun mixed cocktail? They&#39;ve got BOTH. Even for a cocktail &#34;baby&#34; such as myself (hey, I stick to wine), the drinks were tasty and fun. But if only you had some snacks.

Snacks, you inquire? Snacks galore of the Scot-English inspired variety. The scotch egg, the Scottish meatballs-- nothing was a disappointment. But the service. Really all you need in life is a young enthusiastic server--

This place is dimly lit, romantic, and would be great for a date. 

We tried a bunch of drinks and they were all delicious. Favorites were the Jean Brodie, The Young Pretender, and the Spectator. Definitely want to try every drink on the menu.

The only downside is by the time we were there (past-dinner time), there was zero waiter service. In order to get a drink, you have to go to the bar, which was insanely crowded with people just standing around. It was definitely a challenge to get a drink."

3 of our party of 4 arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation and rather than being offered our table, we were ushered into the bar. This wouldn&#39;t have been so bad if our table wasn&#39;t ready yet, but the place was empty. One of our 3 ordered a cocktail (the French 75 which was very nice) and the other 2 stayed with water only which resulted in an immediate air of indifference on the part of the bartender.

Our 4th arrived and we were seated and met by a server who, while trying to be funny, was actually quite annoying when we all commented on the fact that the menus we were given were missing almost half of what what was listed on their website and here on Yelp. 
&#34;Well, the website is that last thing we update when the seasons change.&#34;
&#34;But that is what the customer looks at when choosing a restaurant to dine at.&#34;
&#34;I think you have some anger issues.&#34;

-Not a good start.

We ordered and the meals arrived as the place started to fill and get louder &amp; louder.

Beef Wellington: nice sized portion, but very bland &amp; lacking in the seasoning department.

Bangers &amp; Mashed: Mild, almost flavorless sausages served over mashed potatoes with a cranberry chutney. The chutney was the most flavorful part of the dish.
 
Haggis with Neeps &amp; Tatties: If you like this, it was fine. If not, don&#39;t bother.

Kale salad with halloumi cheese: Tasy, buy actually too much cheese.

We didn&#39;t ask for it, but even though they kept refilling our water glasses, there was no ice. You&#39;d have thought that ice water would be an automatic offering on a hot June night.

The gelatos for dessert were ok, but melted quickly.

The food, while interesting, was nothing to write home about at all. 

The service was mediocre and the place became extremely crowded and so noisy it was difficult to have a conversation at our table.

Overall, we were not impressed with Highlands NYC. It&#39;s an overcrowded, kitschy, noisy, definitely niche restaurant that has the potential to do a lot better in representing Scottish cuisine."

So that&#39;s the extremely short and simple reason we wound up at Highlands on a Friday night. We decided it was high time to have a girls night, so four of us trekked in the rain to the corner of West 10th and Waverly.

Obviously we grabbed the cocktail menu and went to town. Do you even know me? I ordered The Young Pretender (bourbon, Manuka honey, tarragon, lemon soda) and really loved it. I think I drank four throughout the night. I know you are judging me. But they were really good, you guys. 

I didn&#39;t even realize appetizers were being ordered, so stuff just started arriving at the table. I blame my drink. The Whipped Ricotta Pot came first and my god that was good. The ricotta was really light and fluffy, and had perfect accompaniments. A little honeycomb, crispy jambon and toast and I was sold. I know you will be shocked to find out I was using the toast to clean every last morsel of ricotta off my bread plate. I&#39;ve got class if nothing else. Whiskey Bread also showed up and I&#39;m no stranger to whiskey, so I dove right in. I also used this as a vessel for the ricotta, which proved an excellent choice. Take me back!

As an entree (I ordered this one myself, thank you very much) I had the Braised Short Rib. It&#39;s fairly typical of me to get a braised anything, specifically short rib. I guess I&#39;m a glutton for heavy and hearty meals. It came with potato and horseradish croquette, roasted pearl onions and brussel leaves. The onions were a little undercooked for my liking, and the potatoes were only just okay. You know what was awesome though? The brussel leaves. I was super disappointed there were only 5. Legit, five leaves on the plate. Not five brussels, five LEAVES. Weird, but so tasty. Next time I will ask for ALL the leaves, none of the potatoes or onions. Leave that other ish in the kitchen. 

I&#39;m not necessarily a dessert person, so I tend to be indifferent about ordering a plate of it at the end of a rather large meal. Or any meal for that matter. But the girls wanted something and YOU GUYS: they had Sticky Toffee Bread Pudding on the menu and so I obviously raised my voice the loudest and insisted we get that. Sometimes I am really shocked I still have friends. But I have known these girls since I was...I don&#39;t know...6? So they pretty much know the drill and are very accommodating. PLUS - I didn&#39;t insist on choosing the restaurant, so I guess I&#39;m learning? Doing better?

ANYWAY. The Sticky Toffee Pudding shows up and I was really not lady like at all and similar to the ricotta, licked as much off the plate as I could without getting stares from absolutely every other patron. I love food. I almost can&#39;t help it. 

I would definitely go back. Although it was pretty loud, even for a Friday night and the tables are squeezed in pretty close and feels a bit cramped. And don&#39;t go for the sides...hard pass. But for all the other foodstuffs I mentioned? Worth it. And the drinks? Double worth it. 

It&#39;s worth noting the decor too, what with the tartan upholstered wooden dining chairs, deer heads on the wall and everything is mostly candlelight, which I like a lot. Cozy, especially on a cold rainy night for sure. I was bummed there wasn&#39;t room at the bar to hang a bit before or after dinner. 

Check it out, it&#39;s worth it. Let me know what you think."

I took my husband here to celebrate his first solo-closing. We were both really looking forward to the beef wellington based on all of the glorious reviews. Unfortunately, in looking at the menu, there was no beef wellington. The waiter told us they&#39;ve moved onto the spring/summer menu, which (womp womp) doesn&#39;t include beef wellington. We shared the pearl barley risotto to start. The dish had a nice flavor, but not sure barley is the best grain for a risotto dish. The &#34;prawn&#34; in this dish was actually tiny shrimps that looked like the frozen/thawed ones you find in a shrimp cup-o-noodles or something. Disappointing. I had the braised pork shank for my main and my husband had the braised short-rib gnocchi.  My shank was fall-off-the-bone, but somehow dry at the same time. The gnocchi was well made/cooked. I also ordered the Great Western cocktail, which was just ok and incredibly sweet. I&#39;ll return, but only to try the beef wellington."

The staff was very nice. Our table drank a LOT of water...like I think probably at least 5 jugs worth, and the staff was good about taking away the empty bottles and bringing us new ones so no one went thirsty. Also, parts of our party were missing, but they still sat us down. One person came super late and we ordered a dish for her, and they were kind enough to keep it in the back so it stayed warm for when she arrived.

The risotto appetizer was pretty good, as was the prawns on toast appetizer. And the prawns on toast was a pretty decent size as well and they were generous with the topping.

Now the not so good:
This place doesn&#39;t look tiny, but the way they cramp you in, makes it SUPER tiny. I had a strange corner seat so my chair was basically RIGHT next to the guy at another table, so much that every time he moved his arm, he kept elbowing me. On top of that, a girl at his table had to use the restroom which meant both he and me had to get up and move our chairs because there was no space.

The food itself I would say was mediocre. I got the bangers and mash and I&#39;m not exactly sure what I was expecting, but it just tasted like sausage on top of mashed potatoes with maybe cranberry sauce or some sort of sauce drizzled on top? It  was ok, nothing amazing. My boyfriend got the beef wellington which came out looking like an awesome pie filled with steak, but they used too much mustard on his, so he ended up cutting out the steak part and leaving the breading behind. His potatoes were also burned to a crisp. At one point I asked him what he was eating that was so crunchy and he&#39;s like my potatoes!

Finally, this place is loud and dark! Loud like I could not hear what was going on 3 seats away from me. It is not great for a group gathering when you&#39;re trying to hear everyone talk. It&#39;s also pretty dark in there, which is why I probably couldn&#39;t tell what sort of dressing they put on my sausage!"

Went for the shepherd&#39;s pie... well, they didn&#39;t have it on the menu.  What da... So I chose to order pork chops instead as a consolation pick.  That was by far the best pork chops in the world!  Gave my friend a bite and she told me that was the best pork chop she has had at a restaurant.  Y&#39;all simply must try it!

Then it got better.  Yeah, it got better.  My friend and I had 3 drinks each.  They were all very good - not cheap but the taste and alcohol volume were worth it.  The most memorable drink was Kith &amp; Kin, which was some sort of cucumber cocktail.  The first couple of sips sucked!  It was too fizzy and couldn&#39;t taste anything but soda water.  I decided to give it a stir and it did the trick.  Kith &amp; Kin (after giving an extra stir... I am a genius!) should be the measuring stick for any cucumber cocktail drinks!  

The decor was a little too dim for me but forget that... go for the food... go for the drinks.  Not cheap but worth the price."

I got a beef wellington (I&#39;ve always been intrigued by this dish after watching Chef Gordon Ramsey serve it a hundred times on Hells Kitchen) and he ordered a chicken dish.  Chicken was terrible. Terrible because we both have Indian taste buds that have been singed over time with a multitude of spices. It takes more than simple vegetables with salt and pepper in a broth to satisfy our taste buds.  Did not like the chicken at all.  Very very bland.  However, I absolutely loved the beef wellington. Satisfied my curiosity and it was delicious.  Very juicy and flavorful.  The sauce that is served along side the potatoes were perfect.

We actually ended up sharing the Beef Wellington and cleaning out the plate on that. The chicken was only half eaten by the poor fiance who was just bearing it for a while until he saw I had eaten half of the wellington and was filled up. It&#39;s pretty big and thick so very satisfying!

I would go back again for the ambiance, service, and beef wellington.

Service was excellent, very polite and attentive.  Bar looks great so I&#39;ll probably stop by there sometime as well. 

It was packed on a Saturday so make a reservation ahead of time."

The bartenders are really nice, and make good drinks.  There&#39;s a huge drink list full of quality cocktails, and if you like whiskey, there are tons of those to try as well!

HOWEVER, they don&#39;t really have a neat process for keeping everyone&#39;s credit cards organized behind the bar, it&#39;s really disheveled back there.  All the cards are basically thrown behind the counter, and the place is dimly lit so for the bartender to retrieve your card, they have to parse through them in the light hanging over the ice container (hope they don&#39;t accidentally drop your in while looking for someone else&#39;s).

---------------------
The week prior, I had a bit of a bad experience...

As I sit here, The clock is currently at 15 minutes and the bartenders still can&#39;t find my card... The stars are dwindling as I wait.

And the verdict is they have lost my card.  The place was getting 3 stars until then... Oops.

This was because we made a resevation for 12 for my 30th birthday and showed up to a table set for 8. To be clear this was not some open table error. We spoke extensively to the event planner. Who had no problem spending our money requiring us to preorder and prepay for appetizers for 12 but not provide seating for our whole party.

I was then told my fiancee could not stand by the table where there were not enough seats. Two of my pregnant friends were forced to stand at the bar. The staff was increasingly rude. We waited patiently for 2 hours and still the staff could not find a way to add a table top and seats all the while seating other walk-ins. 

The staff was excessively rude. Lied. And had wonderful quotes like.

&#34;Well your fiancee is a liar.&#34;
&#34;Its not my fault they&#39;re pregnant. If they dont want to stand they can leave&#34;
&#34;Are you going to order. You can have half your friends stand at the bar in the other room and eat&#34;
&#34;The table we said we could give you we cant we took a reservation for it instead&#34;
&#34;I dont care if you had 20 people who are eating and drinking thats not my problem thats your problem&#34;
Too a pregnant friend: &#34;You are in the way, your blocking things,  MOVE&#34;

If you want mediocre food and staff that will treat you like dog shit on the their shoe. Eat here. Otherwise avoid at all costs. The most rude of all was the owner. 
In 12 year of living in NYC and going to 100s of restaurants I have never ever been treated so poorly.

They made an error then treated us like an inconvenient piece of shit in the way. And then kicked us out before we could even get a chance to eat after  patiently waiting for 2 hours. I joined yelp just to warn people about how awful this staff is. I work as a journalist. When I say direct quote I mean it."

We had a deal for 30% off which made our bill about 10% less than what I think the meal was actually worth, so I guess it&#39;s a little over-priced for me.

I particularly enjoy the place except for the fact that I was seated near a bathroom ( to be fair, this place gets very busy - very quick). My friend and I decided to be adventurous and order a few appetizers and 2 entrees.

EVERYONE should order the Parmesan crab meat bread; that thing gave me a miniature trip to heaven. As well as the risotto, whatever that was made with, it was heavenly as well. And the scotch egg, I&#39;ve never egg scotch egg before so I don&#39;t know what a &#34;good&#34; one was suppose to taste like but this one - I didn&#39;t particularly enjoy the egg part but more of the outer meaty shell ( THAT WAS OFF THE CHAINS). 

I might be exaggerating but I just really like eggs.

My entree was skirt steak on a bed of red onions, my steak was overall extremely tasty and not chewy but the bed of onions was extremely salty - like why make it this salty?

The food is always a little unusual, with a slight Scottish flair (or it&#39;s haggis. or the scotch egg.), and perfectly delicious. If you like pork chops, they have a really phenomenal, thick, almost bacony tasting one here that is always moist and flavorful. The sides seem to change seasonally. Last time, there was gravy, apples, spinach and a very serviceable mac and cheese with mustard. 

I have gotten the pork chop the last couple of times, but Boyfriend has branched out for the aforementioned haggis, the bangers and mash, and what they are now calling &#34;mixed mushroom shepherd&#39;s pie&#34; but was previously dubbed &#34;hen of the woods shepherd&#39;s pie,&#34; so he thought he was getting some sort of pheasant or something. I thought it was pretty hilarious that he accidentally ordered a vegetarian mushroom dish, but he mustn&#39;t have been the only one, given that they&#39;ve renamed it. But more importantly, it was still really delicious, even if it didn&#39;t feature any little forest birds, because I have never ordered anything at Highlands that WASN&#39;T delicious. 

Case in point: the appetizers. Do you want some perfectly seared scallops? Or some awesome crab dip on toast? We always have a tough time choosing because everything sounds so good. I should also mention the thoughtful cocktail menu. And if you love whiskey, this is your place. I mean, I don&#39;t really drink it, so I can&#39;t really vouch for the quality, but the list is impressively long, so I imagine it&#39;s good stuff. 

I just love this place. It&#39;s a beautiful space, in a slightly creepy Victorian parlor type of way. It&#39;s very comfortable and not too loud, and in my experience it&#39;s easy to get a table. The staff is totally professional and nice and prompt. So basically, sorry Highlands, for not giving you your well-deserved props sooner."

The menu is interesting. There is a nice array of light and heavy options. I had the bangers and mash. My wife had the kale salad.

The flights of whiskey were a huge win. I ended up sharing two flights (six generously poured glasses of premium scotch) for $20 and $30 each. In the land of $13 cocktails, this is a great deal - and a fun way to celebrate the fact that you are out at a Scottish restaurant."

We got the whipped ricotta pot, pork chop, curried cauliflower and potato bridie, and sticky toffee pudding and rhubarb trifle.

Everything was yummy. The whipped ricotta was light and went perfectly with the cured meat on bread. The pork chop was one of the most moist and tender pork chops I have ever had. I tasted my friend&#39;s bridie and the crust was flaky and light, and I enjoyed the curry flavor. The desserts were less memorable to me than the pork chop but still very good."

My friend had done very little research (probably just googled &#34;shepherd&#39;s pie nyc&#34;) and the prices were higher than he expected, but we decided to just go for it... and oh my gosh I&#39;m so glad we did!

We split the scotch egg to start, which was good but nothing to write home about.  Other than that, everything was amazing!  I had the Beef Wellington (one of my favorites and something I don&#39;t get to have often) and, while I&#39;ve had better, it was really delicious.  The beef was very tender, and the potatoes on the side were nice and crisp and actually came out hot, which so many restaurants seem to struggle with.  Yummy as this was, though, I have to admit I was a little bit  jealous of my friend&#39;s pork chop... literally the BEST pork chop I have ever eaten.  I don&#39;t know how they managed to make it so juicy and flavorful... there just are not enough good things to say about it.  I mean... I just can&#39;t even.  AMAZING.

Oh, and I almost forgot about this because the pork chop just stole the show, but my friend and I tried 5 different cocktails and all of them were delicious.  I am not a scotch drinker, but my favorite was the scotch highlands... perfection in a glass.  Dessert was also yummy, service was great, and the decor was so cozy on a freezing night.  Go there."

Went here for early Sunday supper with two of my nieces, one of whom was a vegetarian.  We had drinks from their amazing drink menu.  One of my nieces and I had the Pimm&#39;s Cup and my other niece had the Royal Mile.  Both were tasty.

We started with the Whipped Ricotta Pot (w/o the ham) with buttered toast and a dozen oysters.  Both were really nice.  The Ricotta was fresh and delightful and I just love Oysters.

I had the cod for my main dish.  It was cooked perfectly.  One niece had the Kale salad and the other had the Pork Chop with the Scottish cheddar and grain mustard Mac &#39;n Cheese.  I did have a taste of the Mac &#34;n Cheese and wouldn&#39;t mind the recipe, it was very good.  I did not try the Kale salad as I have one almost every day but my niece said it was very good.

No, this was actually my first attempt but, still this place is super duper expensive and though everything was good nothing was legendary. To set the mood I came with a friend on a Friday night about 9 PM. We start off with a meat plate and burrata cheese. I once took this cheese course at Murray&#39;s, I know Burrata. This was not a good one. The extra $6 upcharge totally not worth it. Meh.

Onto our main meals, they no longer have pork schnitzel on their menu. UPDATE your menu online please. Pet peeve right there. Second, they were out of their steak. So yes he&#39;ll order your most expensive steak - the beef wellington, and I&#39;ll order your vegetarian Shephard&#39;s pie made with mushrooms. This dish would have been amazing with a glass of red wine in January. The mushrooms were super earthy and mixed with the rich mashed potatoes, it was super rich and heavy and in July heat, I wasn&#39;t feeling it. My friend thoroughly enjoyed his Wellington and my pie. But, he&#39;s a hungry man and I&#39;m pretty sure likes everything.

The drinks were good albeit expensive around $10- 16. A good variety though. Service was spotty. Everyone was extremely nice, but, a few incidents here and there that proved that service wasn&#39;t as polished as it should have been for an expensive meal. Wiping crumbs off the table onto my friend&#39;s lap. Taking my $12 drink away with a sip in the bottom plus the cucumber soaking in the tequila and drink which is the best part, waiting on the check, etc...

I think if haggis and the likes is your thing come check out this place. The decor and location are awesome. I may come back this winter if I&#39;m in the &#39;hood but, I&#39;m going to keep explorin&#39;!"

It has great cocktails, wine selection, unique drafts, and of course an enormous selection of whiskey and scotch. It&#39;s also a really sexy, but relaxed, atmosphere. 

I&#39;ve been there dozens + times for cocktails and about a handful of time for food. While Scotts aren&#39;t generally known for their culinary savant, the chef here really does excellent things for Scottish cuisine&#39;s reputation in NYC. Everyhting that I&#39;ve eaten there has been delicious, I really cannot recall disliking anything. On a recent visit I was particularly wow&#39;ed by the scallops appetizer.

Hands down, one of the best meals we ever had.  I would say the food is more Scottish-influenced.  Scottish food is square sausage, black pudding, smoked fish, haggis, and meat wrapped in some sort of puff pastry.  Our starters were blue crab dip on toast, a Scotch egg and haggis.  The Scotch egg was authentic, the haggis was excellent, but it had been US-ified (due to USDA restrictions, traditional haggis is not allowed in the US) and the blue crab and toast had nothing to do with Scotland.  But who doesn&#39;t like crab dip on buttered bread?
For our mains, I had the sea bass and he had the pork.  Both excellent; the dishes were full of flavor and the fish was SO fresh.  Dessert was the caramel-chocolate-sea salt deliciousness.  He was expecting more of a cake I think, but the dessert was more a tart with a hard chocolate shell on top and a pudding-like filling.  

Definitely go and try Highlands!  You won&#39;t be disappoined."

I had dinner here last night with a friend and we really enjoyed ourselves. The wine list was good and not too overpriced and the food was really good. I had the Salmon, which was good but there wasnt too much &#34;sides&#34; on the plate, just a really big piece of fish. Although it was cooked well for being such a large hunk, I would have really liked some veggies and a carb to accompany it. My friend had the roasted chicken. Her plate was much more fuller then mine and she enjoyed it as well. For appetizer we have the crab and shrimp toastie. It was delicious and packed with seafood. It was almost like a deconstructed crab roll and we really liked that. i might go back just for a glass of white and the appetizer! The service is good, but note that the chicken does take a long time to come out, about 20mins, which the waiter let us know which is why we started with the crab thing.

Forget the yelp check in master for this place, whoever that may be.  My buddy from work is the true Duke of Highlands.   This Scottish lad can be found downing haggis at the bar here a few nights a week and is practically a celebrity amongst the staff.  We had some mutual friends in town and he had the brilliant idea of giving us all a taste of home.  To Highlands we went for a night of neeps, tatties, haggis, sausage rolls, pimms cups and anything else Scottish that we could get our hands on.  What a pleasure it was!

As a fairly consistent rule of thumb, whenever a restaurant has great bread, you can expect the meal to be pretty good.  This held true here.  The parker house esque rolls were soft and buttery and melted in your mouth.  Thank god they put out a human portion for the table or else I would have spoiled my appetite.  On to the meal.

Being that the majority of us had never tried haggis before, our host deemed it necessary that we put a couple of orders in for the table so that everyone could try.  Now I don&#39;t have anything to compare it to, but this was the best haggis I&#39;ve ever had.  It exceeded all of our expectations of what intestines cooked inside a sheep stomach would taste like and I would make it a mandatory appetizer whenever I come back here.  This wasn&#39;t the only great dish.  

If the sausage roll is the Scottish version of a corn dog, I&#39;m ashamed to call corn dogs American.  This sausage roll was phenomenal.  Far better than any sausage roll that I can remember having in Scotland actually.  Meaty sausage wrapped in a buttery flaky crust with a zesty dipping sauce.  DYN-O-MITE!  

We also got an order of the fresh blue crab on toast to mix it up a bit and boy am I glad we did.  Such a simple dish but the ingredients were fresh and it had great flavor.  Another repeat order next time I come.

For our main courses, almost everyone at the table either got the beef wellington or the shepherds pie.  I went with the wellington which I was very happy with.  I tried the shepherds pie too and it was good but I was glad I went with the beef.  Definitely expensive for how little meat you actually get but the dish was rich with flavor and the meat melted in your mouth.  

My only qualm about this place is that it wasn&#39;t cheap.  Haggis, and other Scottish delicacies were invented because people wanted to use all parts of the animal in order to save money.  Highlands definitely overcharges for their food but at least it&#39;s really good.  I will definitely be back...hopefully sooner than later."

Not too bad considering that there are many clothing stores around to pass time in and they call you on your cell when your table&#39;s ready.

The restaurant itself is quite spacious with a good amount of personal space between customers. There is a smaller space upstairs as well where you can watch the the yakitori being grilled. Lots of brown wood.

Homemade tofu salad set- custard like, soft but firm, slight grainy/lumpy consistency (not the silky kind of tofu). The sweet wafu dressing that comes with the tofu and salad is amazing and makes the tofu taste so much better. Bonito flakes are long and smokey.
Kaisen don- fish is fresh and tender. Rice is perfect. Was craving sashimi and this hit the spot. Got the set so it came with miso soup (has lots of sliced veggies in it) and egg custard (light, umami).
Had a piece of my friend&#39;s grilled sliced washu beef and it was juicy, a bit sweet and a bit smokey.
Dessert bento- green tea ice cream was with almond slices was good, nothing outstanding; mochi cubes with soybean powder had really good soft texture for a mochi but I&#39;m not a fan of mochi in general so not a fair judge; yogurt cheesecake with yuzu honey was light, almost gelatin-like, and the yuzu honey was slightly sweet and the citrus refreshing.
 
Service was fast and efficient. There is a no-tipping policy here, and the cost of great food and service is very reasonable."

It was a huge party and they arranged several tables together into one long table. Below is my breakdown of the experience.

Atmosphere: 5
The restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere. The host announces the arrival of a guest that is reminiscent of Japanese traditions. The waiter was knowledgeable and patient as we decided what to order.

Portion: 5
I ordered the buta nabe set and it came with a good portion of the sides and entree.  I did feel that there could have been a little bit more soup though mainly because I love soup. However, with the current amount in it, I was completely full. 

Flavors: 5
The delicate flavors of nabe is all there in the broth. I do feel like there could have been more variety of vegetables such as mushrooms. The tomato could have been cut smaller in my opinion. 

Overall there are really great flavors especially in the appetizers that we ordered. In my opinion, the prices are a bit high, but my family had a good time."

My friend and I were craving Japanese and Ootoya was nearby so we walked in when the opened for lunch and were seated relatively quickly. There were so many good options that I had a hard time picking what I wanted but I finally chose the Kaisen Don Set lunch special and my friend got the same thing.

The bowl of rice with all types of sashimi was amazingly large and generous! The rice was seasoned as sushi rice and all the fish was fresh and flavorful. It also came with a soup and ultra creamy egg custard! I had the best time circling around my bento box sampling everything.

Definitely recommended!"

They have a no tipping policy which is explicitly noted on the menu and on a sign posted outside the restaurant. Price wise, everything was reasonably priced for its quality. 

I came on a Friday night at around 7PM but wasn&#39;t seated till around 7:45PM or later. By 9PM there were still a number of parties waiting outside. They only take reservations for 6PM but anytime after that is a walk-in first come first serve. They have a decent amount of seats but the bar area is still the same wait as everything else. 

Service was actually really quick! I&#39;d suggest starting out with the Yaki-tori instead of ordering an appetizer. The Momo Ninniku and the Wagyu were really delicious and tender. While it is only one skewer per order, the meat they gave is on the thicker side. The sashimi is also cut very thick as well! So if you like that, this is the place to be. I also tried the Tororo Soba (Hot) but the Japanese grated yam was just... strange. It was sticky and cold. In my opinion it didn&#39;t really go well with the soba, but luckily they do offer an option without it. For all the main courses they offer an option of a la carte or a set! It would probably be a better option to get a set as it comes with Chawanmushi, miso soup, pumpkin, and other vegetables.  

The wait can be a little off putting, but the food was still delicious! Definitely worth the wait."

Their menu is essentially the  same as what they serve in Japan in their chain like restaurants so everything you get is assured to be authentic. Also tip is already included in the menu price so you don&#39;t have to tip at the end of the meal, just like in Japan!! 

Must-trys:

Appetizer:
HOMEMADE TOFU $8

CROQUETTE $8 - mashed potato &amp; beef in a deep fried croquette. Don&#39;t forget to pour a little bit of the dark brown croquette sauce over it before eating. 


Entree:
GRILLED FISH TEISHOKU $25-27 - fried fish comes in a set of miso soup, pickle of the day, egg custard, veggie of the day, and rice (brown rice optional). My favorite fish are SANMA, SABA, or SHIMA HOKKE. If you&#39;re feeling bold you can also add the natto (fermented soy beans) as a side to have with your rice. This healthy dish is the primarily reason why Japanese people have longevity and live such long healthy lives (just my thought)! 

TONKATSU SET $24 - deep fried panko breaded pork cutlets. (Not to be confused with TonkOtsu ramen which is a pork stock based ramen - TonkAtsu is a pork cutlet.) 

OYAKO JU SET $21 - chicken thighs and onion simmered in a light omelette like egg served over rice. Also comes in a mini set option for $17. 

KAISEN DON $40 - a medley of sashimi served over rice in a bowl. Also comes in a mini set option for $25. 

*As for the SUSHI &amp; YAKITORI - typically in restaurants like Otoya where they serve homestyle dishes it is better to stick to the set menus instead of the Sushi or Yakitori. For these, you are better off going to a restaurant that specializes in Sushi or Yakitori. 


My only negative comment would be that the servers (most of them non-Japanese) could explain a little bit about tips on how to enjoy the dishes I.e. pour soy sauce over the grated radish and have it on top the friend fish, pour the brown sauce over the croquettes, how to prepare the natto (fermented soy beans)."

Only a 15 minute wait for seats on a Thursday evening. Restaurant is larger than what the front lets on. We were seated at the bar, which I was a bit bummed about since I wanted to be further inside to see the decor. My sister and I were pretty hungry, neither of us wanted to wait longer for actual tables so we settled for bar seating. Good service from the bar tender though we didn&#39;t order drinks he took our food order with care. Our eyes settled instantly on the beef set and the bar/waiter suggested the miso katsu. He said its unique because the pork katsu is poached in a soup like liquid- okay!

My sister and I both enjoyed the katsu dish so much more than the beef. We added $1 extra for the seaweed in rice and so worth it! Makes the rice extra special."

The restaurant is busy and the food ok, but there were several issues that prevented me from giving this place more than 3.5 stars. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d come back. 

First, it was HOT. We were unlucky enough to get a table in their mezzanine, which is 20 degrees hotter than the ground floor. They keep 1 fan on, but it was facing the opposite direction from where we were seated, and was useless. Considering what they charge, you&#39;d expect them to keep the place cooler, or at least buy another fan. 

Second, although I do appreciate the non-tipping policy, when service employees don&#39;t expect a tip they tend to give a lower quality service. It&#39;s natural. They were never rude, but did all they could to get us out of there as soon as possible. I came here on a special occasion, and shared it with the staff both when I made the reservation and when I confirmed it. Nothing was ever mentioned or done. We even had to ask several times to get our glasses filled with water. Nothing horrible, but again, for what you pay you&#39;d expect more. 

Third, the food. We were among the first customers in the restaurant, and they were already out of some of the limited yakitori items. In addition, they were out of sea urchin, which is the key ingredient in some of their dishes, especially the appetizer Maguro yamakake. I didn&#39;t go just for this item, but it was surely a huge incentive. It was disappointing that they were completely out of it. In addition, their yakitori thighs were undercooked, the appetizer mini hokke yuan not flavorful, and the salmon in the mini salmon don kinda tasteless. 

The high mark goes, though, to the grilled salmon set, which was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. Very good indeed. The hot pot Buta yasai nabe was also pretty good - the broth was delicious - although the pork belly thin slices were boiled way too much. 

I can see myself coming back for a grilled salmon - or mackerel - set, because they seem to be the best items on their menu. However, after tasting several of the other dishes I would not come here for much else."

I came here for dinner on a weekday with 2 friends. We got to the restaurant at about 5:30 and were seated within minutes. You can sit downstairs or upstairs, so we asked to sit upstairs. The  ambiance is nice; dark and mellow.
We ordered 1 tonkatsu set, 1 oroshi tonkatsu set, and the chicken cutlet/cold udon (special) set. The food came in about 15 minutes and the cutlets were crispy yet tender, and the egg that comes as a side dish was warm and creamy. The cold udon was great; noodles were perfectly bouncy (probably because the cold broth keeps them from getting soggy).

However, I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come here. It wasn&#39;t mind-blowingly good or exceptionally unique. If you&#39;re in the area, I would recommend for lunch/dinner!"

However, something missing in Georgia was the no tip policy that Ootoya seems to have adopted. In the end, it&#39;s easier and better for both parties and with the amount of food I got, I can&#39;t really complain about the price.  

The restaurant is quaint and decorated with Japanese pieces and touches. It seems homey and inviting. When you walk in, you notice other tables and their trays of foods and you can&#39;t wait to get your oversized bento. 

I got one of the silky pork dishes (Katsu Toji). It was one within a clear, yet hearty broth. The pork was so tender and juicy and paired with the rice it was amazing, though I did burn my tongue since it arrived in a huge shallow pot. The miso soup was also something I wasn&#39;t used to. There were vegetables in it and it took me by surprise. I&#39;m so used to seeing just little cubes of tofu and seaweed, that the chopped up lettuce and veggies seemed to go against everything I knew. The miso wasn&#39;t my favorite but I can&#39;t lie and say it was bad. I&#39;m not a big fan of pickles so the little dish of pickled vegetable slices wasn&#39;t my favorite, but it&#39;s there to cleanse your palette if you need a little acidity. Another piece of the tray was the steamed egg... There&#39;s a little dollop of some kind of salty sauce on top which surprised me since I must&#39;ve had a whole bite of just the sauce. Besides that little bit at the top, the rest of the egg custard was pretty bland and without seasoning, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s bad. The texture itself is an experience. 

Next time I fly up here, I&#39;d like to try some of their other stuff. I did get a chance to taste my friends&#39; dishes and they were all really good as well. Their Tonkatsu was very crispy and flavorful. The sweet and sour chicken (Tori Kurozu-An) was also much different than what my usual sweet and sour tasted like; it was milder, not as sour, and the chicken somehow tasted like it had a sweet and happy life as a free range bird."

I had the Buta Kim-Chee Nabe  which was pork belly slices, Kim Chee, tofu, egg, chives and vegetables in a hot pot. I had ordered it with a set which came with brown rice, and egg custard. The brown rice was more of a purple rice and it was pretty good. The egg custard was nice and soft. The hot pot was delicious. Pork bellies were nice and soft with plenty of chives and a nice over easy egg.

Daughter had the Mini Salmon Don set which was salmon and salmon roe over rice. She felt the salmon was a little fatty. It was fattier than what she&#39;s accustomed to but she loved it. 

Hubs ordered the Sashimi 3 Ten Mori a la carte and was hungry by the end of the meal. He felt that the portion was really small for the price! 

Service was very friendly. Our waiter was very helpful. We told him of our daughter&#39;s peanut allergy and he went to alert the chef on her order.

Started with the miso soup with pork. Delish. 

Then onto the kaisen don ($38) . So much fresh fish including salmon, mackerel, uni, tuna, amberjack, and eel. On top of a bed of rice. Along with cucumbers and ginger and a side of pickled veggies. It was very good and incredibly fresh. Absolutely perfect for lunch.

Finished off our meal with the egg custard. Now this isn&#39;t your average sweet egg custard. This is a savory egg custard with a fish broth base. Soooo unique and so good. I really enjoyed this unexpected twist to the end of my meal.

Now, I have to say, I love Japanese food, and having come off a three-meal sushi bender (a friend and I ordered a party platter, no judgement) - I was a little hesitant to go for Japanese again, but we both decided it would be healthy, and we knew how good Ootoya was. 

If you&#39;re newer to Japanese cuisine and not feeling adventurous (or just really love fish), go for the sets - seriously, you can&#39;t go wrong with salmon or mackerel, rice, egg custard, miso soup, etc. Pretty sure it&#39;s a fan favorite - it&#39;s definitely a favorite of mine.

Also, in true Japanese style, the place is a &#34;no tipping restaurant&#34; - that is, you don&#39;t tip (self-explanatory, I know), but the restaurant is a bit on the pricer side, so it makes up for it."

It is apparently a very authentic Japanese restaurant but the feature here is: soba noodles, bowls of rice with a little bit of sashimi, pork cutlets, chicken yakitori, beef dishes, etc. we both enjoyed the little egg custard that comes with the set lunch. 

One thing to be very cautious of: the prices on the menu shown on Yelp for this restaurant are wrong, by a longshot. For example, the Kaisan Don shows as $28 on the website, while the actual price on the menu at the restaurant is $38. When I inquired about the discrepancy, they told me that they haven&#39;t updated the menu shown on the website for several years."

Our group of 8 didn&#39;t have a reservation and waited around 20 minutes for a table.  We hung out by the tiny bar and ordered some drinks.  They serve Kagua Rouge here - one of my favorite beers (and I don&#39;t even like beer or drink).  It has distinct flavors and is a little on the sweeter side.  Highly recommend.

Our server was a cute little old man.  Poor soul shouldn&#39;t even be working!  Service overall was great and food came out in a reasonable time.

Appetizers:
- homemade tofu w/various salts - not the kind of tofu you&#39;re thinking of.  It&#39;s super soft, but super rich and basically melts in your mouth - yum!
- watercress salad - very simple with cherry tomatoes and a delicious tangy ginger sauce
- edamame - standard
- raw squid with squid liver - definitely an acquired taste and you only get a tiny bit for the price

Yakitori:
- yakitori here is reasonably priced.  my favorite of the bunch we got was the chicken w/garlic and the king oyster mushrooms.

Entree:
I ordered the Kaisen Don set.  It comes with a little side of vegetables, miso soup, and chawanmushi.  I love chawanmushi and the one here was excellent.  This can be compared to a chirashi don... not sure what the difference is.  The fish was quite fresh and the sushi rice was actually so good, I made a comment on it.  The uni was okay, but they left some parts of it that shouldn&#39;t be eaten that I crunched on and tasted terrible.  It&#39;s like chewing on sand.

They give you tea after your meal and before dessert.

Dessert:
I got the matcha anmitsu and it reminded me of the desserts they serve at Cha An in the EV.  I loved that this came with the black sugar (love this stuff) but unfortunately forgot to use it until I was almost done with it.  The green tea ice cream was good and not too sweet.  The agar and mochi have almost no sweetness.  A definite must-get.

If you&#39;re searching for a good Japanese place in the area, I would recommend Ootoya."

Food: B+

The food here was great. We got the miso tonkatsu, the katsu toji, and the rosu katsu ju - apparently we all love katsu. We each got the set, in which the entree comes with a small miso soup, steamed egg, a bit of pickled salad/veggies, and rice. My miso tonkatsu was good - the katsu came in a dark miso sauce that was very rich and gave it a very strong flavor. It was a bit too strong for my taste, not only the dark miso flavor, but also the saltiness and MSG, so I would take small amounts and eat it with my rice. It was still quite tasty with the katsu and rice, so I did enjoy my meal. I also tried my roommates&#39; meals - the katsu toji was really good. The taste was very comfort food-y. It definitely warms your body up in a cozy way. All of us had #foodcoma heading home. 

Service: A

The service was very good, very standard, very Japanese in culture. Our waiter was quiet, but very accommodating and professional, which was also very typical for Japanese culture. Most of the servers when I was in Japan were similar, all about accommodating the customer, but a little more distant and not very talkative, leaving you alone to enjoy your meal with your company. Our waiter here got our food to us very quickly, maybe only a 10-15 minute wait, which we loved since we were super hungry.

Ambiance: B

The feel here was simple, comfortable. Their tables are spread out really well, so you definitely don&#39;t feel like you and other tables are on top of each other, which I liked. It was bit quieter than the average for a restaurant in Manhattan. There was some light chatter, but nothing too loud. That could be a good or bad thing, depending on your preference. In retrospect, I kind of wished they played some music (or if they did, played it a bit louder)."

As far as the appetizers; I don&#39;t really think it is really that delicious and worth that price.  In addition, as far as the pineapple flavor beer; I thought it was just ok.

Thank God that Ootoya was open!  I have been here before and really liked it.

I think they serve really authentic Japanese food and they serve it really fresh.  Even though their sushi dishes are basic and familiar pieces,  they are fresh.

Tonight, I went for the original Ootoya Pork belly set.  I liked the grilled pork. I think it was grilled.  It was tender and juicy and sliced to pieces ready for eating with chopsticks: (I am sure if you don&#39;t know how to use chopsticks, you can always ask for a fork). You don&#39;t need a knife though.

The Oshi Tashi  was a little on the salty side but it had some tiny mushrooms in it. Usually when I order it somewhere else, it&#39;s just spinach with shredded bonito on top.

The appetizer with blue fin tuna and Uni on grated yam tasted good with the yam having the consistency of nato.  But when I asked, my server said it does not contain nato. You need to put a little bit of soy sauce when you eat it.

This place serves homemade soba and other items.  So there is an assortment of things to order from seafood, beef, chicken or pork.  Next time I will try their grilled fish!"

For the rice, I chose the mini salmon don (salmon sashimi, salmon roe on sushi rice).  Needless to say, my hunger was satisfied and I was in carb heaven.

The meals are wholesome, delicious, and satisfying. The prices are on average in the high 20s to low 30s per meal set, but note that they include the cost of gratuity. You can choose from a wide selection of Japanese sets, including sashimi, cooked fish, chicken, mini hot pots, pork, soba noodles, and yakitori (skewers). While I usually go to the Times Square location, the Chelsea location offers the same menu with the same quality food but just more space.

My go-to item is always the kimchi hot pot, which is a delicious sizzling soup with pork, kimchi, cabbage, scallion, and egg (aka the best comfort food!). It comes with a side of rice (+$1 for rice with seaweed), salad, and egg custard. 

The meals are pretty filling in my opinion, but if you have lots of room in your stomach, definitely get a yakitori to start! My favorite is the salted chicken skin, which has a very nicely fried and chewy texture.

Hanabi Don Set - the egg custard is the best and never fails. It was filling while leaving me feeling healthy. The only thing is if you don&#39;t like natto(fermented beans) that particular taste may be overbearing for some. I love it so I enjoyed it. 

Kaasan Ni - doesn&#39;t have the crisp that a regular katsu has. But it was perfect to mix the poached egg and the sauce with the rice and make my own don out of it. 

Demi Burger - my friend ordered this and I got to taste it. I&#39;ll probably order this for myself next time. It&#39;s their own version of Hamburg Steak. Delicious!

Salmon sushi: I especially can&#39;t get over how good the salmon in the salmon sushi was. Salmon is my favorite and all 3 ways they present it were amazing. One is raw like sushi and the other two are slightly grilled with one with a sauce. This meal also comes with miso soup, salad, soba noodles with sauce, and also the egg custard. The egg custard is excellent and so smooth. Bang for your buck!

Kimchi hotpot: this is like kimchi jjigae if you are familiar with the Korean stew but this is a lighter version of it. Comes with rice, salad, and also the egg custard. 

These two were both excellent and highly recommend, especially the salmon sushi. 

The interior is very cute and there is bar seating as well as regular table seating. Would be a cute place to go on a date or a nice lunch with friend."

The concept is great - giving you set plates of food that pair well together so there&#39;s a lot of variety on the plate.

I got the lunch special salmon set. It was salmon with roe and rice, miso soup with noodles, egg custard, and pickled vegetables. I really enjoyed it! The noodles had a great texture, and the whole meal was very good and not too heavy. 

Enjoyed the setting as well! I also appreciate the no tip concept."

I arrived with a friend without reservation and our wait was so little. We were comfortably seated in no time at all.

The décor is minimalist, with a clean and clear feel to it. The staff are graceful and friendly.

We started our dinner with Yakitori (grill dishes) such as Tsukune (chicken meat balls) and Tebasaki (fried chicken) it was succulent and suited perfectly well with our bottle of Asahi.

For the main entree, I selected Shima Atka jack mackerel from the Rice Bowls selections that came with Miso soup with pork and vegetables, homemade pickles, steamed egg custard and white rice served on an oversized Japanese tray! The meal set was sumptuous and delicious.

My entire dining experience was a real treat in itself, from customer service to meal presentation. I am a fan and I will definitely comeback."

Ootoya is a great Japanese place to have a nicer, but casual dinner in the Flatiron/Chelsea area.  I have been here on several occasions with friends visiting from out of town.  Try and come during the week or stop by to put your name on the waiting list, as there usually is at least a 20-30 minute wait!  I usually come here if I&#39;m in the mood for more traditional style Japanese food that is not mainly focused around sushi.  

When we got seated, our server handed us hot towels to clean our hands while we deliberated through the menu.  To describe their food offerings simply, their options can be categorized either as meat or fish.  

Wanting to share a variety of dishes, my friend ordered the Gyu Shio Koji Don Set (washu beef with rice, mashed potato, water cress) and I had the Bara Chirashi Don Set (assorted sashimi containing Blue Fin Tuna, Amberjack, Scallop, Scottish Salmon, Simmered Sea Eel
Simmered Shrimp, Egg and Salmon Roe served atop of Sushi Rice).  The sets are really great (an additional $2) because they give you miso soup, homemade pickles, and steamed egg--my personal favorite!  We also ordered chicken meatball and chicken thigh yakitori as appetizers. 

Everything that we ordered was very fresh, prepared delicately, and delicious.  We devoured yakitori in minutes because we were so hungry and they were very classic and standard.  The washu beef in the Gyu Shio Koji don was very chewy and extremely filling.  The sashimi in the chirashi don set was chopped up and tasted extremely fresh.  

At the end of the meal we were stuffed and they bring out tea before the check came.  Overall we spent in total ~$90 including tip which is decent considering we ate a considerable amount of food."

Luckily, we came 45 minutes before closing allowing us to have a quiet, initmate dinner right in the heart of NYC. 

Asthetically Ootoya is very simplistic, following the Japanese principle of Kanso. It&#39;s everything you&#39;d expect from a trendy NYC Japanese restaurant.

Menu is extensive and features a great selection of yakitori and hot pot/sushi bowls. Food is noteably fresh, divinely prepared, and flavor packs a punch (disclaimer: squid liver is VERY strong, only for the more adventurous diners out there... Take it from the bae who could only eat one bite, oops!)

Service is attentative and before you&#39;re seated the hostesses shout a chant-like phrase in Japanese which is followed by the cooks shouting another Japanese phrase back - very cute."

I could tell right when I walked in, because my friends and I were the only non-asian clients! I ordered the pork katsu dish as a set. Definitely make your entree a set, because it only costs $2 extra and comes with egg custard, miso soup, pickled veggies and rice. The waiter talked me in to ordering seaweed on my rice for $1 extra which is NOT WORTH IT. Literally just a few stray seaweed crumbs... what the heck. I was also expecting more meat, the portion size was kind of small and I wasn&#39;t that full when I left the restaurant. 

The service was all right. They serve green tea at the end of the meal which is good. I kind of felt like the waiter was harrassing us to order more items. For $25-40 an entree, it really shouldnt come as a suprirse when we aren&#39;t jumping to order appetizers and sesserts."

Found this place because we needed somewhere to go as we waited for Raines Law Room nearby to clear out a bit and it was the perfect choice. Besides sushi and sashimi, I&#39;ve never really experienced truly authentic Japanese food. Ootoya is great because it has a bunch of sets, which are essentially large, beautifully presented bento boxes that have a bit of everything and really keeps the dining experience both appetizing and interesting. 

We started with a soba appetizer with grated yam on top and it was mind blowing. Simply put, it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve tasted something so unique. The soba noodles were the perfect texture and they soaked in the sauce and topping. It was light, delicate, and extremely good at awakening my appetite. For my main course, I ordered the grilled fish set off of their specials menu and it was heavenly. I enjoyed everything, especially the mushroom and chicken soup as well as the steamed egg custard. It also came with seaweed, some sort of vegetable soaked in sauce (I thought it was extremely well-done squash that somehow reminded me of sweet potatoes too), shredded/mashed radishes, and a mini salad. What I loved best was that everything came in these adorable little pots and I felt like a little kid presented with a thousand different options in one meal the entire time. 

I also just really like the general environment here. Everything is spotlessly clean and the atmosphere is a mixture of chic and intimate. It&#39;s definitely a great place for a date, as many others have mentioned. Service is very prompt. Love the green tea and hand towels they provide at the beginning (it&#39;s definitely these little things that add a lot!). Can&#39;t wait to come back here and try more sets!"

I had the mackerel set - highly recommend! It was a big fish, fresh and tasty. The egg custard that comes with every set is also super good! Two of the people I came with had the Kaisen don but didn&#39;t enjoy it as much, despite all the great reviews here. They saw it in pictures with the udon but didn&#39;t know you have to add it on. One of them regretted it and would&#39;ve rather tried one of the tonkatsu sets. Our waiter was super busy, but very friendly. The matcha amnitsu was very cute to eat.

Always order a set cuz it comes with a side of rice, which you can customize by adding seaweed, and a small container of steamed egg.  It almost felt like the best comfort food dish I have ever had.  You can finish the meal with the dessert sampler.  You won&#39;t regret it.

They are also one of the first NYC restaurants that do not charge gratuity anymore.  You pay the price you see on the menu pls tax and thatz it.

The goal of Ootoya is to make you feel like you&#39;re some where in a Tokyo izakaya. (An izakaya is a type of Japanese drinking establishment that offers home style comfort food). If you&#39;re going to Ootoya because it&#39;s Japanese and you&#39;re feeling sushi, this is NOT the place for you. This is for traditional  teishoku (udon, soba, don). You&#39;ll be surprised to see just sashimi on the dinner menu. A dinner for two with a bottle of wine will cost about $100, and gratuity is not necessary as its already baked into the cost (it&#39;s noted on the check). Definitely an acquired taste, but the food is authentic and good. The wait staff is also very attentive and friendly, my favorite thing is that they give you her towels before the meal begins."

I came here around dinner time without a reservation and was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar immediately or wait 10 minutes for a table. I chose the latter, and was waiting ten minutes but had very prompt and courteous service guiding me to a table upstairs. My friend ordered the Katsu Toji set for $35 as recommended by other reviewers and it was delicious -- the chicken/egg was perfectly breaded and steamed, with tasty sauce. I ordered the hot soba noodles with yam but do not recommend since it was $17 with very little food and no protein. The bill came to $55 total.

We had black sesame and green tea ice cream for dessert. Loved the black sesame ice cream, it was so creamy and flavorful. 

Tip: Ootoya doesn&#39;t accept gratuity/tips for their waiters. The prices have been inflated to reflect this, so keep it in mind!"

Well I&#39;m glad that I finally came to eat here because 1) I was starving and 2) I was craving some GOOD comfort Japanese food. 

I arrived at 11:30a on a Saturday, I was waiting for my boyfriend to arrive and cannot get seated until your party is there (standard among most restaurants). Luckily, there was a lot of seats open (they have an upstairs, so capacity seems pretty large). We were greeted quickly by our server and handed us some hot towels to clean our hands and cups of green tea. 

The menu is somewhat extensive, so I recommend doing some perusing their menu before going as it took me awhile to decide what to order (or I might just be kinda indecisive :/ ) We both ordered the mini kaisen-don, I got it with cold-soba noodles and my boyfriend got the hot soba noodles (which does not come with miso soup, because they consider the hot soba as the soup? Kinda lame, but that&#39;s ok, he couldn&#39;t finish his meal anyway). This meal comes with a sushi don (yellowtail, shrimp, scallop, tuna, ikura, egg and a couple more types of fish I&#39;m forgetting), chawanmushi (with nothing added, just egg custard, but tasted very smooth. Also comes with tsukemono (pickled vegetables), miso soup. It&#39;s A LOT of food and it&#39;s all really great quality. I&#39;ve had slightly better sushi, but also because I am very harsh Japanese food critic! Still, 4 stars is up there and am glad to have eaten here. I will be back, you will not leave hungry that&#39;s for sure :) 

Note: if you&#39;re familiar with Japanese culture, you do not tip. This restaurant practices this and indicates on their checks that their employees are paid well enough that tips are not necessary. It&#39;s not even about the pay, but at the end of the day, it&#39;s about the service you get - quality service. I appreciate that they do this because I think goes to show that great service is attainable without the desire for tipping."

Put our names down for a table of two, took about 40 minutes to get a table without a reservation. 

This is not a transitional Japanese restaurant, in the sense of sushi rolls or nigiri. A lot of the available foods were traditional entrees, such as tonkatsu and don bowls. They also had appetizers of yakitori.

I ordered a set (set comes with pickled vegetables and a savory egg custard) of the mini salmon don with salmon sashimi and salmon roe, along with a beef yakitori and a chicken breast yakitori. 

Yakitori were absolutely amazing. I believe the chicken had freshly shredded lemon grass atop of the meat, which created such a different flavor in your mouth--lemony, fresh, warmth... Beef was extremely chewy, but the flavor was so fresh. Nothing negative to say about the don bowls--fish was absolutely amazing. The salty roe really complimented the vinegar rice to create bites that didn&#39;t require any soy sauce. Egg custard was very rich and creamy, and was in a way, also a palate cleaner to end the meal. So delicious. So yummy."

I was super hungry when I came (and I have a huge appetite) but wasn&#39;t able to finish all of the hot pot. The egg custard was super tender and prepared with a plum sauce. The pickled veggies were also the perfect complement to the hot pot. Everyone else was very satisfied with their entrees.

It was intimate, but it&#39;s a good place to go to with your friends or with a date.

To my luck, I didn&#39;t have to wait at all. YAY ME!

I got the Beef And Cheese Potato Croquette. It was surprisingly very filling. 
Definitely get the set! The presentation is so cute! It comes with rice, warm egg custard, salad, and miso soup. 
I was pleasantly surprised to see a piece of chicken in my soup. It was like chicken noodle soup - Japanese style.
The meal comes with 2 Croquettes. It was delicious, but I definitely want to try other dishes the next time I go back.

My friend got..one of the donkatsu dishes, but the pork was overcooked. It was too dry.

My other friend got the Katsu Toji. The broth was really good, but I&#39;m not a fan of having my meat infused in broth. It makes the breading really..soggy.

To end it all, I got some sort of green tea dessert - it came with ice cream, red bean, green jelly cubes, and mochi. It was basically a Japanese version of patbingsoo (a Korean dessert that I&#39;m absolutely obsessed with!). It was yummy but not memorable. Next time, I will try the earl grey ice cream.

The bill came out to $26-$28/person. It&#39;s not too bad when you want to treat yourself. Unfortunately, my group went during a time of our own Great Depression - either having no job or losing $$$$$$ in Vegas/Puerto Rico. I&#39;m pretty sure I heard the waiter chuckle when we changed our rice from brown to white after hearing that it would cost $1 more. LOL!"

Came here for &#34;mistress Valentine&#39;s&#34; (a joke by the hubby) because we couldn&#39;t get a table for actual Valentine&#39;s day so we opted for a substitute celebration. Whatever, Valentine&#39;s Schmalentines. Hate to ascribe to it. It had been awhile for us in Manhattan where everything from taste, quality, service synced beautifully together to create that perfect dining experience, but it happened here. Service was phenomenal from the minute we stepped into this place til the moment we left. The set menus, plating and ambiance really made us feel like we were truly dining in Japan. Also, was great seeing a lot of Japanese people dining here as well. To me, that is the true mark of awesome Japanese fare.

We started with the handmade soba noodles with dipping sauces to start and it was just perfect. Sooo good! I forced the hubby-- okay gently directed him-- to order the kaisen don set, which he didn&#39;t really like but that uni, yes it is as sweet and umami-tasting as everyone has described. I would order that separately but that&#39;s just me. My katsu toji (katsu fried pork loin in salty sweet soy broth) was definitely the star of the meal. My hubby couldn&#39;t keep his chopsticks away from it. With the set, it comes with pickled vegetables (ok), pork and vegetable miso broth (hubby really loves this), steamed egg custard (yummy! Unless you&#39;re like my hubs who actually thought he was getting ice cream custard!) and yes, that heaping bowl of rice. There&#39;s also the option of ordering soba and add-ons for an extra price which had we known, would&#39;ve done that instead of getting the soba as a starter. Even though we were both STUFFED midway into our meal, we just had to finish off with dessert. Ordered the strawberry parfait which contained buttermilk (mmmm!!!) and strawberry ice cream with a powdered sugar cone, strawberry sauce and marshmallows (these really kinda took away from it all if you ask me). Paired all this with hot yuzu sake and a pitcher of Sapporo, which we realized was just excessive at this point given how much food they give you! I haven&#39;t been able to stop thinking about this place and can&#39;t wait to come back again. 

All in all, a great traditional Japanese spot with options of getting sashimi/sushi, yakitori, dinner sets or churashi. I highly, highly recommend this place!"

I called in advance to see if they had a table that would accommodate a party of 7 and requested for a highchair as well. The person that picked up the phone said that the table will be ready in ten minutes and to get there right away. We got there in exactly 10 minutes (according to my phone log and the time I arrived), and the girl in the front said she gave the table away. She even said with an attitude that they don&#39;t take names over the phone and that she can put my name on the list again so I can wait. I gave her my name and she told me it&#39;ll be around 15 minute wait. 

I was then seated after less than 5 minutes of waiting (which was awesome), but once I sat down, the same girl from the front came back to me and asked impolitely &#34; your whole party is not here yet?!&#34;. I told her that they are coming inside right now and she just walked away.

Finally, we ordered and the food came. The yakatori there is decent but overpriced ($8/order - each order comes with 1 stick). Their main courses are reasonably priced ($27-33/dinner set - each dinner set comes with miso soup, pickles, and steamed egg custard). My favorite was the Gyu yakatori - yummy! But everything else was just alright.

The waitress was friendly and nice. She recommended items and was very attentive. The food was decent as well but nothing special.

Some of my colleagues (who are from Japan) have told me that for the price point, they&#39;d recommend Ootaya as they have similar offerings when compared to Japan.

We were set on the mini kaisen don lunch set that comes with the soba noodles (served cold) or hot udon noodles. The regular size kaisen don does not include the soba noodles/hot udon noodles but does include uni (the uni isn&#39;t particularly fresh). Each piece of fish was very fresh to taste. 

We were in between the beef and cheese croquette and the Kaasan ni. We decided to go with the Kaasan ni which is panko breaded chicken in a savory soy sauce soupy broth. 

The idea of the chicken and the broth was good in theory. However I felt like the crispy deep fried chicken was defeated in the overflowing of the steaming hot broth. It really defeats the purpose of deep fried crispy chicken. It turned out to be soggy chicken.. But it was good. The broth with onions is delicious topped with rice. 

The miso soup with veggies and picked veggies didn&#39;t particularly wow me. The steam egg custard was smooth and silky. Particularly loved the dipping soba! Add hints of wasabi to your dipping broth and be prepared to have your mind blown away! The soba noodles deserve 5 stars alone."

This place is not for sushi - Ootoya offers more meat (Yakitori), rice, cooked fish, some sashimi and soba options. A friend and Icame here without a reservation at about 7:30pm on Thurs, and the wait was about 35 minutes.

The menu had many options that were available a la carte or as set meals. Our waiter recommended any of the set menus. My friend ordered the mini Kaisen Don set ($21) and I ordered the Tororo Oyaka Don set ($20) which was frilled chicken wrapped in an egg custard over rice. The set was in served in a beautiful presentation: meat, miso soup (interesting with chopped pork), smooth steamed egg, the fresh white radish and seaweed. Brown rice was an additional $2, which was something not pointed out when the choice was offered by our server.  I personally did not like the custard in my set - it made the rice slimy and the meat to rice ratio was off - which is why I gave it an average rating. The food we ordered did not blow me away. However, everything is presented so nicely and service was excellent. 

Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu - such as the grilled fish and yakitori."

A young Chinese couple walks in, I know this because they&#39;re speaking mandarin to each other.
Couple: &#34;Can we put our name down for six people?&#34;
Hostess: &#34;Uh...sure&#34;
Couple: &#34;How long will the wait be?&#34;
Hostess: &#34;Like 45 minutes, give me your name and number and we&#39;ll call you when it&#39;s ready&#34;
Couple: &#34;Thanks&#34; (the couple leaves)
Hostess to another staff member: &#34;I don&#39;t know why these people expect to be seated with large parties. We&#39;re so small. We&#39;re not a dim sum hall. They should be going there instead.&#34;

Takeaway: Don&#39;t come here with parties larger than four. Two is preferable. Single diners even better apparently.

After that my party of two was seated promptly. We got the last table in the restaurant and this was around 12:15pm on a Sunday. I recommend getting before then to make it into the first round of diners so you don&#39;t have to wait very long.

The other diner from my party is from Japan and he commented how Ootoya is a fast-casual chain in Japan and the transformation to a fancy Japanese restaurant is quite the surprise to him. Nonetheless, he still commented the food was very authentic and I found it delicious. I had the miso tonkotsu which I haven&#39;t been able to find anywhere else in the city and the fish is always a good choice for diners who like seafood.

Since the restaurant moved to the no tipping policy on March 28, I was wondering if the service would change. Everyone was all smiles with us and on par. We were never rushed, and we especially felt this when there were a lack of servers on the second floor to flag down and get our bill. It took us almost 20 minutes to get the check. Apologies to the parties waiting for our table that afternoon."

Was here for a dinner for 2 on a saturday night and waited for 30 minutes before being seated at the sushi bar area. Service was great and the waitresses were very attentive. 

I got the tonkatsu set ($20) -set comes with rice, miso soup, pickles, and an egg custard. The pork was nice and tender with the breading perfectly golden brown and crispy. The egg custard was also delicious and a great side dish to complement the meal. My friend got the chirashi bowl set ($32) and I tried one piece of the salmon which was very fresh.

If you&#39;re searching for an exceptional Japanese restaurant, I would highly recommend Ootoya."

I saw about 7-8 names crossed off after us. A wait was expected, so it wasn&#39;t too big of an issue for us, but I didn&#39;t understand why they were just waiting for that specific table when there were a lot of other tables you could put together. 

Food - Good, but not exceptional. 
Fried Chicken was good but a bit salty and with skin (not a skin person)
Pork Belly w/brown rice set was good. 
Grilled Mackerel was just ok. Salty and fishy, which I asked for a fish that wasn&#39;t so fishy.
Mini Oyako don set was delicious. (Over priced but delicious) 
Salmon Sashimi was delicious but but the portions were small.
Tea - Didn&#39;t know they had it as it wasn&#39;t offered.

Overall, long wait, overpriced decent food.. not sure I&#39;d make a trip just to come here. I think I&#39;d rather wait in line for some good ramen."

I came here with my friends tonight (Saturday) around 7:45 PM. We didn&#39;t get a seat until 8:30 PM. So prepare to wait. However, the wait is worth it.

We ordered some yakitoris first. The mune wasabi could be skipped. However, the buta aspara and buta tomato were REALLY good. I would definitely recommend the buta tomato.

We all ordered the kaisen don set, as recommended by a lot of people on Yelp. I would highly recommend this as well. The fish was extreme fresh and the rice was amazing. The set is REALLY great -- the miso soup was flavorful with lots of great vegetables, and the egg custard is extremely smooht. 

We ended the dinner with the crepe. This was okay -- not very big, nor special. Would probably get something else next time. 

Otherwise, had a great time here. Great ambiance, great food!"

The udon had a nice bite to it, with a lot of thinly sliced veggies to add some textural contrast. The broth was delicate. The fish were very fresh and melted in your mouth. The egg custard was so silky and flavorful. Definitely a gem. We were lucky that we were seated right away for lunch, but it definitely got packed when we left. Highly recommended."

Came here for lunch today with 2 others around 12:30. The wait wasn&#39;t too bad- around 20 minutes and we were seated. 

Ordered the Mini Salmon Don with hot Soba. The salmon portion was a bit small for the price, in my opinion... I got maybe 4 pieces of salmon sashimi in my bowl, but it tasted great! The soba portion on the other hand, was very generous. Along with the egg custard, the meal did end up filling me up!"

Treat yourself to the whole set instead of going a la cart because the egg custard is off the hook and rice makes everything taste better.

I joined my friends for a birthday dinner. The birthday girl arrived 40 minutes early so there was no wait once our complete party arrived. 
Otherwise, expect a 2 hour wait if you arrive between 7-9pm. 
It&#39;s amazing how crowded this place is even though there is so much seating! Ootoya Chelsea has upstairs seating, Bar seating and Seats by the chef. Plus small table scattered throughout the first floor.

The food: 
We ordered a ton of yakitori! Roasted beef, Reba (liver), bacon wrapped bites, chicken skin and more. My favorite yakitori was the crispy chicken skin and the roasted Gyu (fatty beef). If you love organ meats, their Reba was tender and perfectly seasoned. 
Definitely get the yakitori sauce. 
If you want a cool citrus drink, you should get the Yuzu sawa sawa. 


Of course by the time the main course arrived, our bellies were filled. Each of us ordered the Kaisen Don. Delicious fresh sashimi with vinegared sushi rice. It&#39;s not the best sashimi in town but for the price, they&#39;re hard to beat. 
I could hardly enjoy the wonderful bowl of fish thanks to all the yakitori consumed previously. 
If I were to come back, I only order the Gyu kushi and a Kaisen don.

Only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table on a Wednesday night (heard larger groups quoted over an hour). Was seated at a two person table in the back near the kitchen bar, so there was some degree of privacy.

Started out with one of my favorite beers Ginga Kogen, which I will order any time I see it.

For food, they have a VERY extensive menu. They have sashimi, soba noodles, yakitori skewers, and even hot pot! I&#39;ve been told Ootaya is a chain in Japan, and I guess the menu reflects that. Usually it&#39;s a bad thing when a menu has too many options, but in Ootoya&#39;s case, it doesn&#39;t hurt them one bit.

Started out with the house made tofu that came with world selected salt. It&#39;s always a rotating salt selection, but we got a ginger salt, an Australian angel flake salt, and a wasabi one. Our original waiter didn&#39;t explain what each was, but we were able to have someone else tell us. The angel flake salt was my favorite, and the wasabi salt was as spicy and sinus-clearing as it sounds. Delicious silky tofu.

For mains, we shared the mini kaisen don, which was all sorts of raw fish sashimi slices over rice.  It included shrimp, salmon, tuna, a few others with roe on top. Wonderful fresh fish, and it could&#39;ve definitely been a whole meal unto itself.

Also had the Gyu Shio Koji set from the Washu Beef section of the menu, which was a LOT of food. There were six pieces of delicious washu beef - super tender and well marinated in a slightly sweet, slightly tangy sauce. And it came with a side of savory egg custard, homemade pickles, and miso soup. Also went with brown rice instead of white. No idea why anyone would opt for the &#34;a la carte&#34; option instead of the &#34;set&#34; because it&#39;s only a $2 difference.

All in all, I would definitely head back to Ootoya. The food is great. Service is fine. And you get a real Japanese vibe from the decor and the staff."

Bar seating isn&#39;t exactly the most comfortable, but I needed to know what the hype was about...possibly overhyped here. We ordered the mini kaisen don set, washu beef set and homemade tofu with salts. 

The tofu wasn&#39;t very smooth, but loved that there was the option of different salt flavors to go with it. The kaisen don set, the fish was very fresh and went perfectly with the rice. I really liked the egg custard as well, was it with a plum sauce? The set was simple, but made with fresh ingredients and was just the right amount for one person. As for the washu beef set, my friend felt that the beef was kinda overcooked, unfortunately.

My coworkers and I have been ordering lunch from this place for the past few months. Mind you, there&#39;s a lot of us so it&#39;s always a decent sized check. Be warned: the pricing is so all over the map as it is. ANYWAY ...

I don&#39;t need to tell you that the guacamole is really tasty ... so much so that we order several of them every time despite the ridiculous $9 price tag. The only thing saving them was that they gave a nice 16 oz. container of the stuff. That is, until today.

When we ordered three guacamoles and received tiny little portions (partially filled 8 oz. containers to be exact), we were all really confused. If you haven&#39;t done the math, that&#39;s less than half of what we normally receive. Thinking it might&#39;ve been a mistake, I gave them a call and you will NOT believe what I was told. After leaving me on hold for an oddly long time, a gentleman comes on the phone and says, &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, miss, but there&#39;s an avocado shortage. This is the new size we have to give everyone.&#34;

Um. What??? I swear, I thought I was on candid camera. Are you freaking kidding me? We were all so appalled and amused by this that we looked it up once I got off the phone. While there WAS an avocado shortage, it already ended. Not that this even matters because there is just so much wrong with this picture!

1) How is their shortage the customer&#39;s problem? Figure it out on your own time. 2) How in the world can you justify $9 for a tiny little serving of guacamole, particularly when it is literally LESS THAN HALF of what you used to serve? What planet are these people from? Maybe scale back and charge $5 for the small size, but you can&#39;t possible expect me to accept the fact that I&#39;m paying the same obscene price while getting less than half of the product. 3) Considering that this is probably what people order the most, you would think there would be something written on the online menu so that long-time customers aren&#39;t shocked when they receive their order. Laziness or deceit? I can&#39;t tell. 4) Knowing that we order all the time, you would think they would offer us some sort of partial refund since we were clearly blind-sighted by this ridiculousness, but no. Not a chance.

So to summarize, while the food is good, the place is grossly overpriced in an area where there are cheap delicious eats aplenty. They lost an entire office of customers today."

First of all, pretty catchy name and store banner outside is bright and bold. You can&#39;t miss it. 

There were a few customers at around 6:30pm. Several were waiting for their to go orders. Only one or two dining in. The place felt empty and dreary. Needs better decor and much more lighting. Would help brighten up the place in terms of atmosphere as well. When I walked in I was greeted very politely by a hostess. She answered my questions about the menu and didn&#39;t try to sell me anything more than just the chips and guac that I came for.

It took about 10 mins to prepare and they only took cash but said this was only temporary since they just opened.

Now on to the actual food. I just ordered the traditional chips and guac. It was $9. Pretty expensive I would say. It does come in a huge portion, like an entree sized chips and guac though. Definitely good to share between 2-4 people. The guac is very fresh and flavorful. Onions weren&#39;t too harsh, not too spicy, fresh bits of tomato, overall great proportions of everything in the guac. Chips were crunchy... Not sure if they&#39;re home made or store bought. 

I&#39;m writing this as I&#39;m eating it and I&#39;ve barely made a dent but there&#39;s still so much left. Worth the $9 but still a little steep so that&#39;s why I&#39;m giving it 3 stars. You can get a burrito on their menu for the same price! 

Definitely coming back to try some of their other items."

I don&#39;t leave reviews very often - pretty much never - you either have to be seriously bad or just that good!  And the chicken tortilla soup from Holy Guacamole is just that good!  Like really good.  Like the best chicken tortilla soup I&#39;ve ever had.  And I love chicken tortilla soup.  

Not only is the portion huge and thus filling but there was also a ton of chicken. This was not a poor excuse for a hearty soup, it is filled with chicken!  Also, if you&#39;re not a veggie person like me (I hate veggies in my soup!) then this is the soup for you.  Chicken, tortillas &amp; avocado, that&#39;s it!!! I can never find a soup like that.

The service was pretty cool. The long-haired male bartender was pretty much on point. Even though he knew the other people in the bar and was chatting  with them, he really took care of us and chatted with us for a little bit.

There&#39;s drinks, and TV&#39;s, and some good food. Beer for $5-$7. Attentive bartenders.

The food will set you back some money so if you start doing that you&#39;re guaranteed to spend some $$$ here. Expensive for bar food, but it&#39;s a step up from tavern fare so that&#39;s a plus.

Everyone on the staff was incredibly friendly and the backyard space wonderful. They have six picnic tables set up and a grill towards the back. There was a DJ set up so they didn&#39;t have the grill going. The space feels very communal and encourages conversation. 

We got the hanger steak and the burger. The burger was pretty good; the cheese really made it stand out. The steak was okay, but not great. I can&#39;t put my finger on it but something was a little off. It didn&#39;t help that the chef seemed prone to overcook the meat as both the steak and burger had no pink when ordered medium (girlfriend likes her streaks well done, I&#39;m still working on changing that). The biggest sign of lack of confidence though was the cardinal sin of bringing out A1 Steak Sauce. 

The fries that came with our meal were great. They were sea salted shoe string style. The kale salad with lemon dressing is also a great pick for summer.

Overall though I would absolutely come back and try the meat again, I&#39;d just ask for it rare or medium rare.

Definitely give this place a shot if you&#39;re in the area!"

Central Station is the quintessential neighborhood joint. Come for the food, stay for the vibez. Good grub&#39;s as common as bullshit in Bushwick 2.0: what&#39;s rarer are friendly staff and welcoming, diverse! not here-to-see-and-be-seen customers. 

And oh, the décor. It&#39;s just so damn original. You won&#39;t find exposed brick or reclaimed church pews in this joint, brother. You&#39;ll find sturdy wooden stools meant to be sat not worshipped in, and a quiet color scheme.

THE FOOD: I can only vouch for the wings, which are all things to all men. The wings should run for POTUS 2016. I&#39;ve caught myself on several occasions trying to make love to the wings, peniswise, forgetting the wings were edibles, mistaking them for the perfect woman. Scrumptious.

The backyard is another highlight. It&#39;s spacious, airy, private and has enough nooks and crannies to do unbiblical things should you actually be with the perfect woman. I digress..

I had the fish sticks even though I haven&#39;t had fish sticks since my mom made them for me from a box. These weren&#39;t the fish sticks from my childhood - they were delicious. The breading was tasty and the sauce on the side was great. They were a little salty but nothing that ruined the flavor. 

Wings are great - they are spicy but not too spicy and have an interesting sauce - not your typical Buffalo sauce. 

The french onion soup is GIANT.

I can&#39;t come here every day as it is a bit pricey (10 dollar hot toddy&#39;s, 16 dollar burgers) but it is worth trying for sure. They do have beer/shot specials so you can come for a cheaper night full of Pork Slap and whiskey."

Our bartender was fantastic, though - very quirky, friendly, and full of energy! When I ordered a rum and coke, she suggested making it even better by substituting the soda with ginger beer and adding crushed lime.

The staff was super friendly and the locals keep things lively and humorous. Chef churns out killer food while the bartenders deliver great cocktails. Only reason I&#39;m dropping just 3 stars is the price. Dinner for 2 at a bar in Bushwick shouldn&#39;t be $70.

 I went with friends and we had the burger, which is made from a combination of short rib, brisket and ground beef with apple smoked bacon on top; the hangar steak, which comes with delicious potato fingerlings and the, totally unassuming, fish sticks, that deserve a better name because they&#39;re better than one would imagine.  They&#39;re seriously on a gourmet level.

  I&#39;ve been here a few times since  the place opened and the staff has always been friendly, attentive and a pleasure to be around, it&#39;s a total neighborhood feel.

And if you missed the 4th-of-July-all-you-can-eat-and -drink pig roast then you were ass out.  Great times.  

Looking forward to the menu expansion in the next few weeks and the addition brunch in the future -says the owners."

It was amazing! The best part was our server Meagan. She was friendly and fun and we basically just let her suggest our food and drinks for the night and i&#39;m so glad we did. 

Hubby and I split an order of the fish tacos and the burger , which Meagan had the kitchen cut in half so we could share. Both were delicious!  As was the wine and beer she suggested to accompany our meal. Our friend had the chicken wings, which were some of the best i&#39;ve had. 

The space is beautiful and clean. I would definitely go back."

Came here for burgers &amp; prosecco with my boyfriend a few months ago, and was so impressed with the people and the space that I asked to have my birthday party in their (awesome and huge) backyard a few weeks ago.

Peter (owner) and Lindsay (chef) were great in helping to plan the party.  We roped off the top level of the patio and Lindsay roasted a whole pig and prepared a variety of summer salads/sides.  I had probably 50-60 guests throughout the night, and everyone was well fed and had a wonderful time - people really loved the food, raved about how great the staff treated us (seriously, A+), and appreciated that it&#39;s a nice place but the drinks are reasonable.

I couldn&#39;t have been happier - while the party was happening I got to relax and hang out with my friends, and they took care of everything.  Huge shout outs to Ryan and Megan who worked the bar - they not only took great care of us, they were awesome additions to the party in their own right.

This is a really special place in Bushwick, definitely my go-to neighborhood bar."

This place is super close to our apartment so we were excited to see it open. Stopped in a week ago to grab a bite before heading out for the night. There were  a few people at the bar and servers were taking care of one or two tables. 

Walked in and sat at the bar. Bartender threw some menus our way and walked to the end of the bar. As he was very loudly telling some other guests some ultra-interesting story (or practicing his stand-up routine) about getting arrested we counted 7 minutes before he came back to ask for our drink order. Seven minutes might not sound like a long time but sitting there, having already decided what you wanted and just watching the bartender talk, and talk, and talk with no one else really in the place save for the recipients of a his adventures in misdemeanors, it felt like an hour. 

As he finally came up and apologized for &#34;telling a crazy story&#34; we ordered our beers, a couple drafts we were excited to try. &#34;oh yeah, we don&#39;t have any draft tonight, gas is fucked up.&#34; He went on to explain exactly what happened to the draft, for probably 3 minutes (again, not a long time, but seems so when you&#39;re waiting for a drink). Settled on a few bottles, one of which they were out of, then finally just went with some Bud tall boys. (HINT: When ALL your draft is down, lead with that)

From then on, the service wasn&#39;t horrible. We ordered the hummus and grilled cheese. The hummus, while not horrible, for the price was simply a small &#34;smear&#34; of hummus on a plate with two huge pieces of bread (the bread was delicious). Could have used some veggies but there wasn&#39;t even enough hummus to dip them in. 

The grilled cheese could have been excellent. Great bread, good cheese but the tomato jam totally ruined it. The tomato jam wasn&#39;t tangy, wasn&#39;t tasty, just overly, disgustingly sweet. It tasted like a grilled cheese with any kind of cheap diner jelly spread on it. The fries were decent but at $12 for a small-ish grilled cheese and fries, it was still kind of a rip-off. 

I&#39;m basing this off the food and service we had. I&#39;ve heard from others the burger is good. Also, I can&#39;t complain at $3 the Bud tallboy is a great deal. However, as a newly opened restaurant, I can certainly expect them to run out of things, not be totally on point with food but as far as service, an experienced bartender, as honestly, this guy seemed to be by his attitude and &#34;swagger&#34; should be 100% on point. Not looking for anyone to S any Ds but brand new restaurants really need to nail down the customer service to establish a group of regulars and make great first impressions. I&#39;ll probably try it again at some point, but it will be awhile."

Walking in, the place had much more of a sports bar feel to it than a farm to table place. Two large TV&#39;s. Granted, it&#39;s a bar AND restaurant, but I was just confused by my first impression, I guess I was expecting something more warm and homey. The place was clean (although since it just opened a week or so ago, it should be). But I found it to be sterile in both cleanliness and personality/atmosphere. Back patio was big and nice. The burger was good, but nothing to write home about. The employees were all very friendly and polite though. They all seem eager for the place to succeed, so I hope it does, just via patrons that like a more generic sports bar type place than myself."

The dining experience was ruined bc of our waitress.  She was rude and not friendly at all, not to mention the overall service was bad.

To start, they serve their wine by the glass out of a decanter instead of the bottle.  This doesn&#39;t allow the patron to see the actual bottle, and my friend said the wine tasted sour... like the bottle has been opened and sitting around a long time.  She did mention as such to the waitress who went back and I suppose spoke to the sommelier (don&#39;t even know if this place has one) and came back to say the wine was fine.  She did offer to replace the glass with another wine, which was nice, but my friend didn&#39;t want to make too much of a fuss so she declined.

We ordered our apps and entree.  While we were waiting, the waitress came out with what looked like bruschetta.  She mumbled something which I couldn&#39;t quite hear b/c the place was quite loud.  On careful inspection, what I thought were tomatoes looked like chopped meat so I inquired.  When she said it was steak tartare, I told her we didn&#39;t order it as I thought she brought it to us by mistake.  She was quite rude and said &#39;I know, it&#39;s on the house&#39;.  Well, first of all, who serves raw beef as complimentary dish to patrons?  Does this place assume everyone enjoys eating raw beef?  A bruschetta would have been more appropriate in my opinion.  Anyways, we did have a tiny bite out of curiosity, but it wasn&#39;t very good so we left most of it uneaten.

For app I had the octopus and i have to say the best part was the duck salami!!  They were to DIE for.  The octopus was alright.  I don&#39;t know if I would have enjoyed the dish as much w/o the salami though.  For the entree, I ordered the steak frites RARE, but the dish came out overcooked-- medium well done.  Now, most steak lovers know that a good piece of meat can be ruined by overcooking.  It was quite a travesty.  The steak was served with a dollop of mustard on the side, and the combo of steak w the grain mustard was quite nice. I didn&#39;t make a fuss as we already made a fuss with the wine but I know I would have enjoyed the dish had it been cooked just the way I wanted it.    The fries were good though-- they were herb fries and there were quite an abundance of them.  On the flip side, my friend said her app (tomato soup) and entree (mushroom risotto) were delicious so at least one of us enjoyed her meal.

I&#39;m just shocked at the yelp rating this place has gotten based on that one experience I had last night.  Maybe my overall impression of the place would have been better had we been served by another waiter but I doubt I&#39;ll be coming here anytime soon."

I&#39;m vegetarian so asked the manager for the only other vegetarian entree on the menu, truffle risotto. She said they don&#39;t have it tonight. So I asked if the chef could make me any kind of vegetarian pasta. Any kind. At all. (Pasta w seafood or meat was on the menu) She looked me in the eye and said &#34;it&#39;s Saturday night, the chef can&#39;t do that, you can have a salad&#34;
I was shocked. Ummm this is NYC 2016, and the pasta on your website was taken off the menu without proper update, and the truffle risotto ON the menu is not available, and you&#39;re telling me there&#39;s nothing else you can do for me???
Such terrible customer service.  I had to press her to ask the chef, and in the end of course they did make me a pasta with ratatouille. Pasta itself was over cooked and ratatouille tasteless but whatever, at least it wasn&#39;t salad.
Will not be returning. I&#39;ve been to many fine dining and Michelin star restaurants on weekend nights and they&#39;ve always made me something delicious if they didn&#39;t have a vegetarian item on the menu. And I didn&#39;t have to fight for it like I did here.
Too many amazing places to eat in New York to bother with this type of bad menu planning and service.
Two friends got the steak frites and couldn&#39;t even eat their steaks, they were cold, tough and tasteless."

Nothing too fancy, but great French country staples in a genial setting. We found it! Last night we made our first visit to Dominique, just off 6th Avenue at Christopher &amp; Gay Streets. High ceilings, brick walls, cool jazz, a great wine selection. Our waiter, Yaz, was a delight. At first all Gallic crabby and feisty, but really a very nice guy underneath. 

Mussels and escargots to start, both tart and briny. Steak frites, risotto dripping with cheese and truffles, choucrute laden with meaty goodies. The wine choices are many; not many bargains, but they won&#39;t ruin the bank, either. Super-scrummy mousse au chocolate and raspberry cake for dessert. 

We&#39;ll be going back here, that&#39;s certain! C&#39;est si bon."

We went with reservations for a group of 5 people and got seated at a table that is really suitable for only 4 people. The tables are on the smaller side and they use huge plates. From their perspective, I could understand why they didn&#39;t want to use an additional table for us in the event that they got another group within the hour and had no place to seat them. But by the end of our meal, nobody sat next to us. And when they tried to fit a group next to us, they realized what a tight squeeze it would have been and so seated them elsewhere. They could tell we were a little bit annoyed, but our waitress was still very pleasant and polite. She could have thrown attitude our way as well, but she instead won me over with her kindness. 

In terms of the food, I was really impressed with what they had to offer and would love to try going again for dinner. Given that it was past noon, I opted for the truffle risotto entree instead of brunch like the rest of my crew. Though a little underwhelmed by the portion size initially, it was the perfect amount and I was stuffed by the end. They also include shavings of the actual truffle in the risotto which was a very nice touch. It was full of flavor and the rice was cooked perfectly to my liking. The truffle fries are also very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My group ordered the steak and eggs, duck hash, baked eggs, and croquette - no complaints about the food at all."

STARTERS:
Baked Camembert (garlic, herbs de Provence, walnuts, raisins) - pretty much a perfect baked cheese. Comes with nice, french country loaf bread. The savory cheese with garlic and herbes is perfect with the raisins and nuts. The herbs de provence is a really nice touch and the lavender comes through.

Foie Gras (waffle, sour cherry reduction, apples) - this was my first time having foie and whereas I expected a more creamy, smooth texture, this was much more gelatinous, like the fat of a well-braised pork belly. The foie tasted maybe a bit over seared in places, the cherry reduction was thin, the plating was messy, the waffle was decent. The sour cherries themselves were really tasty though! Very dense and packed with cherry flavor. 

WINE:
2011 Batasiolo Barolo - delicious aroma of dark berries and currants. The body wasn&#39;t too heavy or creamy, nor was it too light - really nice middle. Definitely some residual sweetness and not very tannic/astringent either. Very nice - would have been perfect with a lighter red meat but I wonder how well it would have stood up to a fatty, heftier steak

ENTREE:
Scallops (lardons, truffle mash) first off, the scallops weren&#39;t very fresh. They weren&#39;t bad to the point that there were off-odors but by chewing it and tasting them, they lacked the sweetness and succulence of truly fresh scallops. The lardons were cooked perfectly - well rendered, crispy on the outside, and chewy inside. The mashed potatoes were decent, with a nice touch of truffle. Really not a special entree in my perspective and quite unbalanced. You&#39;ve got protein and a load of carbs and that&#39;s all."

Dominque Bistro is a charming French restaurant that happens to accept Sunday brunch reservations. All of the windows were open when I dined here and we were lucky to sit next to one and enjoy the autumn breeze. The food here was fresh; I had the Belgian waffle with Salmon and the waffle texture was perfect. Service here was friendly and attentive, until the end of our meal when we were rushed out.

Service: nice but slow. You might get ignored by your waitress. What do you expect,  it&#39;s french? Go if you&#39;re not in a hurry.

After an entire day of eating and enjoying the culinary delights that NYC has to offer, we decided to try a variety of plates at Dominique and share it tapas style.

Everything was delicious, but here&#39;s the breakdown of what we ordered:
- Salmon: perfectly seared on the outside with a lovely, crunchy crust but with a buttery and melt-in-your-mouth texture in the inside. My personal favorite of the night.
- Truffle Risotto: truffles + Risotto? Uh, yes please! Buttery, rich, and delicious - would absolutely recommend.
- Baked Camembert: this wheel of cheese was served with crusty bread and some nuts and raisins, charcuterie style. The gooey cheese was perfect and everyone at the table loved it.
- Scallops: served over a bed of potatoes and bacon chunks. I only had a little so can&#39;t really comment on it, but others at the table loved it.
- Truffle pasta: I can&#39;t remember what it was called on the menu but it was absolutely delicious and served in a rich, decadent sauce.

The food was extremely impressive and definitely a 5/5. Our waiter was nice and friendly but also seemed very distracted that night and took a long time to get our orders and check in on us, which is the only thing stopping me from giving this place a full 5 star rating.

OVERALL: 4/5.  The food is absolutely delicious and the ambience is great - an excellent spot to hang out for casual dinner with friends or bring a date.  Would definitely recommend!"

Service is awesome, decor is as bistro-chic à la Parisienne as can be, corner location in the middle of charming Greenwich Village is perfect for a sunny and cool July afternoon; and the food is delish.  The lunchtime French Week prix fixe can&#39;t be beat (hurry, it ends July 17th).  I was utterly delighted to receive a generous assiette (ben, planche !) of charcuterie and fromage for my first course.  The finocchiona and aged prosciutto were as good as can be, really.  The Préféré de Nos Montagnes (like a Reblochon), truffled semi-hard, and Fourme d&#39;Ambert were &#34; correcte &#34;.  For our mains, the duck confit was nicely crisped (Balthazar&#39;s is juicier and more tender but also overpriced, at $40), the accompanying arugula and tomato salad refreshing, and the roasted fingerlings beautifully golden and deftly seasoned with a generous pinch of fleur de sel.

For dessert, my friends both had the soufflé, which was delicious, and I had the creme brûlée, which was amazing! The top was perfectly done and the custard beneath had an amazing flavor. So creamy.

The only drawbacks to my experience were that we sat by the cooks, who don&#39;t get me wrong, were very nice, but the restaurant itself had a very nice ambiance and I would&#39;ve preferred to sit there, and then it took forever to get our check. The reason I gave them five stars is because they didn&#39;t charge us for dessert! Probably to make up for the reasons I listed above, which really weren&#39;t a huge deal, but minor drawbacks.

The atmosphere with the tall ceilings is great and the big window at the front is a great place to see / be seen. Expect a menu of French bistro classics served with a less fussy downtown style. Our server, Audrey, was super cool and chatted with us about her hometown of Paris and was spot on with her recommendations. While - alas - the much lauded truffle risotto was sold out, we had French onion soup, a pear salad, and and branzino with ratatouille finished with a crepe brûlée...can&#39;t go wrong with the classics, albeit a version that celebrated the fresher, lighter side of French comfort food. Perhaps the best thing we ate though was an amuse-bouche with a chilled grilled octopus and a frisée salad with a citrus dressing. Cheers Dominique Bistro and Audrey!"

It was important to show our support for the French people and culture.  We were seated on a Friday night promptly and was brought water and bread shortly after Yaz our waiter introduced himself with a big smile and friendly demeanor.  

We ordered the dinner special: Foie Gras and Brandade - Truffled Bacalao (salted cod) starters followed by the Chateaubriand for Two, and he asked if we wanted to start with glasses of rose followed by the red (Cote du Rhone) wines.  

The Foie Gras was well grilled and tasted wonderful with the sweet mini cherries and thin sliced apples on a mini waffle.  The salted cod with truffle oil and black truffle shavings were devoured by scoops of flaky, soft breads.  The rose wine was crisp and fruity with just enough acidity to offset the slight fishiness of the cod.

Yaz checked in on us and then came the Chateaubriand with roasted baby carrots, brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes.    Medium rare with peppercorn crust accompanied by jus, tender and cooked right.  Washed down with a fresh glass of red with a pleasant bouquet and medium bodied finish.  

For dessert I had the chocolate mousse and my wife had the creme brulee.  Wished they had chocolate soufflé on that special though.  

Two very well made appetizers, a shared entree, two desserts, and four glasses of wine for $178 plus tax and tip.  A fair deal for a fine meal.  Quality service with quality food is worth the cost in this city, and this is one restaurant that does it right.  We will be back again."

To be fair to DB, it is delightful space. Huge windows, well decorated, superb. 

Food: Rack of Lamb - though technically out of season (NZ lamb is fresh Dec-June), was delicious. I dined in early September so this was probably from frozen stock. Tender enough. Well prepared on the rarer side of medium-rare.

Served with spinach croquets - um, ok. Alone, they were delicious, with the lamb was a question mark. Spinach pucks. These are the food of appetizers and bar snacks. These do not belong on a dinner plate.

Also served with saffron (?) couscous on a smear of goat cheese with figs . . . okay, I love me some goat cheese and figs, but this was not a delightful combination, it was just muddy. So I ignored the goat cheese under the couscous and went about my lamb massacre. The figs didn&#39;t add anything. Dates would have been a better match. The couscous didn&#39;t really marry with the lamb.

Components were individually fine. Together . . . well, it was like potluck night on my plate. 

Wine:
I really enjoyed the attempt to offer better wines by the glass. With wine and food, I want better, not more. Quality beats quantity.

My hesitation about the way they offer wine, if I am buying $30+ glass, bring the bottle to the table so I can see you are pouring what I requested. Good choices on the list.

I&#39;ll definitely be back. Probably regularly/weekly. Space is fab. Wine is fab, food is very good. 

Probably $$$ to $$$$ not $$."

So here&#39;s the low down! 

This used to be a cafe but honestly the space is better for a boutique restaurant since its in a prime location.  They are super nice.  And don&#39;t worry, they don&#39;t forget about you.  They are attentive, and even if they can&#39;t help you right away, they will acknowledge you so that you know they will get to you. 

Trendy, intimate, and smells yummy inside!   The food is good and i would say if you want a chill spot to have some dinner and drinks, this is a good choice on any given night.  
 For appetizer we had the octopus. Well cooked for that slight bit if crispiness on the end tentacles.  Good balance on flavor so that the octopus has just enough flavor and not too much.  Clean, and simple.  

We had the squid ink linguine which was delicious!  It was a slight bit tender but not going to lie, squid ink pasta is reallllllly hard to cook al dente, so I would say that was delicious.  Its slightly creamy but not overbearing.  There was a perfect amount of crab meat to dress the dish.  Not too salty, and again, not too creamy.  

We also had the halibut.  I don&#39;t generally like olive, but the tomatoes, olives, fennel and broth to me was well balanced.  Halibut was seared on one side to give it a bit of crisp, texture, and held well on top of the light broth.  

Overall, i&#39;d say i really like this restaurant and would return for a round 2.  

Customer service definitely 5! 
Food is good but more like a 4, it was made well although wasn&#39;t that much of a departure from usual affair.
Venue is good space, typical new york space.  So about a 4.  

Anyhow, its good.  And price point is very reasonable for nyc.  So if i could do a 4.5, it would be more like that."

Perfect mix of cool and gracious. Lovely service, delicious food and excellent wine selection. I requested a vegetarian pasta that was off the menu and the chef complied. It was superb. The halibut and salad nicoise wowed the other diners. We will have dessert next time.
Thank you for a wonderful evening."

In addition to the great atmosphere in the West Village, the place served authentic French cuisine.  We split a nicoise salad, and we were blown away by the huge portions.  The duck cassoulet was a must and did not disappoint.  The pappardelle pasta was also cooked to perfection.  We will certainly come back again!"

Finally we went for a birthday weekend brunch.

We walked in and were asked if we had a reservation, we did not (there were many open tables by the windows, it was 11am) the waitress acted as if they were packed!
she told us we cant have the tables at the front/window because it was all reserved.. okay we asked if we could sit at the totally empty bar? she paused then said sure.... okay we sat at the bar on very wobbly chairs.

The decor is great. but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t make up for the lacking food quality. 
we tried to order the lavender mist cocktail and were told that the person who knows how to make it was running late so they can only make the most basic drinks... ok lets have coffee then.

we ordered  Madame Croques which was bland, too much bread that was soggy and too much dry ham with one sorry egg that did nothing for the moisture factor 
we also got the duck hash which was good but a bit on the heavy side and overly salty due to the bacon. Also there was less duck in this dish then you&#39;d expect... more fatty pork chunks and soggy potato.

We left without finishing half the food. I mean everything was below expectation.

I went to the restroom and while I waited for someone to come out you can see the &#34;chef&#34;
cooking on some electric heating plates, as i watched him &#34;cook&#34; (more like pull out containers of pre-made pasta in some kind of black sauce and dump them onto the pan and yell to someone to bring him eggs I realized why we had the experience we did.)

Needless to say we were disappointed, in addition the meal came out to about $60+ which I felt was a bit much for the quality."

The ambience &amp; decor is french country chic &amp; just gorgeous! The food &amp; wine were excellent! My only complain was they were seating all the asians in the back of the restaurant. They tried to seat us in the back as well on my birthday but I insisted on a table near the front window. We had to wait for a bit but they finally gave us a table in the front. I did noticed everyone towards the front are white and all the minorities were seated in the back. SHAME! Your restaurant need to address this! This is New York! NOT COOL!

Our waitress was very friendly &amp; attentive. But the tables are super cramped. You&#39;re practically sitting hip to hip next to strangers &amp; be prepared to hear everyone&#39;s conversation next to you. This is typical NYC space but even more cramped! NOT very romantic!

I got the duck confit which I typically expect to have most of the fat rendered off and a nice crispy skin however this was mostly a fatty skin with a light layer of crusting. The meat did get infused with the fat pretty well but overall didn&#39;t have that rich flavor with that bite of saltiness. Besides that accompanied the duck or pretty mediocre nothing to write home about.

I got there at 8 and the hostess said there were no tables, but we could sit in the back in front of the chefs.  I wasn&#39;t crazy about that, but I was really hungry so whatever.  The chef made us a little appetizer of tomato stuffed with tuna and a spinach croquette (free of charge) because one girl in my group was running late. It was delicious! He made one for her too when she arrived.

I had the truffle risotto and it was AMAZING! Soooo creamy and delicious. It was the best risotto I&#39;ve had in years! My friends had the bass and pappardelle and we all devoured our food.  Literally all conversation stopped and we just inhaled it. Delicious all around. 

For dessert, my friends both had the soufflé, which was delicious, and I had the creme brûlée, which was amazing! The top was perfectly done and the custard beneath had an amazing flavor. So creamy.

The only drawbacks to my experience were that we sat by the cooks, who don&#39;t get me wrong, were very nice, but the restaurant itself had a very nice ambiance and I would&#39;ve preferred to sit there, and then it took forever to get our check. The reason I gave them five stars is because they didn&#39;t charge us for dessert! Probably to make up for the reasons I listed above, which really weren&#39;t a huge deal, but minor drawbacks.

I will definitely come back and am dying to try the duck, roasted camembert, and escargot, among others. Definitely check them out! Good meal for a fair price in that area."

Service is awesome, decor is as bistro-chic à la Parisienne as can be, corner location in the middle of charming Greenwich Village is perfect for a sunny and cool July afternoon; and the food is delish.  The lunchtime French Week prix fixe can&#39;t be beat (hurry, it ends July 17th).  I was utterly delighted to receive a generous assiette (ben, planche !) of charcuterie and fromage for my first course.  The finocchiona and aged prosciutto were as good as can be, really.  The Préféré de Nos Montagnes (like a Reblochon), truffled semi-hard, and Fourme d&#39;Ambert were &#34; correcte &#34;.  For our mains, the duck confit was nicely crisped (Balthazar&#39;s is juicier and more tender but also overpriced, at $40), the accompanying arugula and tomato salad refreshing, and the roasted fingerlings beautifully golden and deftly seasoned with a generous pinch of fleur de sel.

The chocolate mousse was light, creamy, and not overly sweet--an udderly (sic) satisfying mouthful.  The crème brûlée was slightly curdled and sealed with too thick a layer of cassonade (it didn&#39;t pass the test of the Amélie spoon tap), but I happily lapped it up.  The Americano, served in a round cup almost as large as a café au lait bowl, was a little dilute for my taste, but just fine for the hubs.

Go early and often.  Service continu guarantees early, long, and late daily brunch and lunch.  Régale-toi !"

Had the bone marrow and mussels for appetizer, mussels are fresh and the texture is ripe, the sauce is not anything amazing but it&#39;s good and savory. The bone marrow is pretty good and leaves a lasting taste, the portion is a little small though. 

We both had pasta for entree, the squid ink and the pappardelle. Squid ink linguine is pretty amazing, you can definitely taste the squid ink in every bite and there&#39;s a little jalapeño kick to it. There&#39;s also tons of crab meat lumps so it&#39;s good! The pappardelle is average, the meat and sauce is good but the pasta is so-so, maybe because this is a French restaurant after all, can&#39;t compare with the texture of the pastas in an authentic good Italian restaurant. 

Overall still a great restaurant at a decent price for a nice weekend date, would come again to try the other things on menu."

However I was quite disappointed when i finally got mine, they had significantly downsized the portion: they used to serve the duck with mashed potatoes, gravy and a salad.

For the entrees, two of us chose the squid ink linguini with chile pepper and crab which, we learned, was a new menu addition tonight! This dish was a surprising blend of seafood -garlic, creamy, pepper mix.

Ooey Gooey with the perfect amount of ripeness and runny. The herbs gave it an amazing flavor. I couldn&#39;t stop eating that and we kept asking for more bread. The foie was seared just right over a waffle with a list berry sauce. The grilled octopus over greens was good but def got trumped by the foie and camembert. For mains, we got the squid ink linguine. Steak au poivre. Scallops with Truffle. Papardelle. The squid ink linguine was out of this world with the perfect spicy kick. Steak au poivre had a great au poivre sauce. Papardelle was good. Scallops were seasoned well and seared to perfection with some truffle. What&#39;s NOT TO LIKE?! Yaz brought over some scoops of gelato for our girls birthday!!! Pistachio, coffee, and chocolate. Yummo! My only gripe was the central air wasn&#39;t cold enough for such a hot day. Def hope to be back there when it&#39;s slightly cooler!!!"

I&#39;ve seen many good reviews for this place and I was really excited to try but the food was sub par and the cost didn&#39;t match the quality of the food. 

For apéritif we had escargots which was very bland, we also had mussels that were super tiny and lacked flavoring as well. We also had to request for bread several times and didn&#39;t get it until our apéritif came out. 

For the entrée we had Coq Au Vin, which tasted like soy sauce chicken from Chinatown. It lacked the aroma of thyme and rosemary and the chicken was super dry and salty, surprisingly because everything else we ate was bland. We also had the Squid Ink Linguine which tasted like regular pasta with Alfredo sauce with sprinkles of crabmeat. 

For dessert we had the crème brûlée, the custard&#39;s texture wasn&#39;t smooth as it should be, it was more like choppy tofu. I also didn&#39;t taste a slight hint of vanilla or see any vanilla bean in the custard. I&#39;ve had many crème brûlée and this by far is the worst one I&#39;ve ever tasted! 

We&#39;ve had a lot of French food before but this didn&#39;t taste authentic to us. 

Overall, the service wasn&#39;t great but the atmosphere was decent, the pianist did a wonderful job setting the mood, but just wished the food was better for the price we paid for. Not a returning customer."

service: non existent. our wait person never checked on us  - not once - &amp; left us twisting while waiting for her to take notice that we were done. eventually, enough was enough &amp; we attempted to get her attention. she was at the little bar area &amp; ignored us. we finally had to ask another woman working there to grab our wait person. we were almost late for our show. 

price: expensive, but you pay for the location.

With time in my favor I rejoiced life with some wine.  Quality wine with knowledgeable bar tender and friendly service.  Happy Hour is only from Monday to Fridays-- no weekends.  The location is very convenient to the A, C train High Street.  A business card is available for grabs.  When scanning their brunch menu the cheese plates and select entrees were appealing for a return.  I was actually carded as my face does not match my age:

Can I See Some Identification?
Ergo all bouncers scrutinize to the tee
To exam my photo, memorize my mailing address
All the while doubting the authenticity of my DOB to match my face
How my luck reeks to be carded
Here, there wherever I go
Stop glaring at me
Yes, we Asians hide our age gracefully

I opt for one glass of red wine with bar tender Pam&#39;s suggestion.
Syrah, Thalvin Syrah (Morocco) 2011 $11.00-  very subtle red wine of a gentle finish with oak and cherry.  I actually did tasted the oak and the sniffed bottom of the oak barrel.  It was fruity."

I stopped in for lunch with a friend.

I had a prawn taco dish and was starving after.  Really scabby portion. It was tasty but not nearly enough food for a man.

My friend had a kale salad which she enjoyed. 

The food was extremely expensive for what you got. That being said it was alright. 

The problem was the lady who was working on the day.  Does she realise she works in the hospitality industry?

She really kept pestering people to leave when they were finished.  Even though the place was mostly empty, as soon as people took their last bite she stood over them and slapped a bill down.

I left 10% because I didn&#39;t want an argument. But she didn&#39;t deserve it. The worst was the poor guy that came in and begged for a glass of water (it was baking outside) and she said no...

This spot is relatively closeby and a bit more inviting than the usual dimly lit wine bars.

Got a half-carafe of Montepulciano ($27) and a side of Home Fries ($4). The dark red was perfect after freezing our asses off outside, especially sitting next to the window and seeing others trying to brave the cold while we got warm. Home fries were nicely seasoned, going well with the red.

Service here is solid. They didn&#39;t try to rush us out despite just having a side and a drink. Although I don&#39;t come around this area often, I&#39;ll make a note if needing a spot to relax."

After an agonizing decision making process, I settled for the special Peppered beef stew w/ egg noodles and a glass of heaven(malbec)!! The stew was mind blowing, dare I say better than my mom&#39;s.

Today&#39;s brunch (Sunday, August 14th) was 1 star for food and service.

Saturday&#39;s food was delicious and the presentation was gourmet. The little bubbly dark-haired server went above and beyond to accommodate our party of 3, plus one small dog. Sitting outside, she moved us and the umbrella out of the sun and in to the shaded area under a large tree. We had such an incredible first experience at this restaurant, tipped our server 25%, and decided to go back for Sunday brunch. Wish we hadn&#39;t.

Sunday&#39;s food (though we all ordered the very same dishes) came out over-cooked, greasy, and one of the dishes contained a small dark hair wrapped around the homefries. The service was incredibly poor. The blond woman acted annoyed at our attempt to recreate the seating area with umbrella so we could again be out of the hot sun. Throughout our dining stay she was a borderline acceptable level of &#34;friendly.&#34; She did not come out to pour our water after the initial pour, and only twice peeked her head out after another gentleman dropped off our brunch selections. She never questioned why 2 of my parties meals were barely touched. I believe, she could have cared less. When it came time to pay we all gave between 12-18%, though felt that this was even too generous for the quality of food and level of service, and lack of attention received. After paying, the blond woman quickly flew out of the door and began to question angrily why we didn&#39;t leave a larger tip.
I have never in my life been questioned in such a harassing manner from leaving an acceptable tip amount. At her age, she should know better than to use intimidating behavior on the clients she is serving.

Such a shame because we really loved this neighborhood spot."

This review is specific to the brunch service.  In general, avoid this place for brunch.  A brunch shift which was previously managed by one server adequately is not horribly mismanaged by 4 people.

The exterior and interior of the restaurant looked nice so we gave it a shot.  The menu seemed fine but the service and the quality of the food was lacking.  

Service - it took a long time for the food to arrive. A couple that ordered AFTER our group had placed the ordered got their food first.  I think the reason for that is THERE&#39;S ONLY ONE CHEF doing everything in the restaurant.  

Quality of the Food - I ordered the pork tacos.  It wasn&#39;t that impressive but it wasn&#39;t bad either.  It&#39;s quite simply just not memorable.  

There&#39;s many other great restaurants in the Brooklyn Heights area - I&#39;d go check those spots out versus this one."

My first visit--for drinks only--was undeniably enjoyable. Our server was attentive and helpful, and my drink was excellent. I had the Brooklyn Beauty, which was a concoction of gin, prosecco, lemon, and St. Germain. Utterly delicious and refreshing, and it had my friend wishing he had gotten the same. 

My second visit, however, was subpar. I had another round of the Brooklyn Beauty, but this time it was decidedly not what I expected. It was still decent, but tasted like it came from Airborne powder. Or Emergen-C. The aftertaste was very, very strange. 

I also had food the second time around. The burger that I ordered was decent. Grass-fed, which was a nice touch. I do wish, however, that they added a tad more seasoning. My friend had the pulled pork sandwich. This, too, was decent, but forgettable. 

In sum: Come for the cocktails and wine--skip the food."

The cheese and wine selections are fantastic - make it a point to get a cheese plate with at least two cheeses! If you don&#39;t know cheese that well, just describe to them what you&#39;re in the mood for and they&#39;ll make the magic happen.

Also have to say that this wild board ragu gnocchi is INSANE. Wild boar doesn&#39;t sound particularly delicious to me, but it IS and this dish is perfectly cooked. So, so, so good. The mac and cheese is also a winner, as are the burgers.

I do not love the brussels sprout salad, but it is not bad either. The brussels sprouts are raw and shredded and overall the dish is very bitter (not really my thing). If you&#39;re a big fan of roasted brussels sprouts and get excited when you see this on the menu, realize it will taste nothing like roasted brussels sprouts.

Likewise, don&#39;t love the chocolate/walnut bread pudding. The actual bread pudding is a perfect consistency and taste, but think the chocolate kind of is too much. Creme brulee is where it&#39;s at.

ATMOSPHERE is on point and the service is amazing/very friendly. If you get there before 7 on a weekday, you can get a ridiculously good deal on house wines and select beers ($5)."

THE STORY: Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar is the type of cozy neighborhood corner perfect for long conversations over a rich bottle of wine and a few small plates ideal for sharing. The music is so hushed and mellow that you&#39;ll only notice it after a lull in conversation highlights Elton John&#39;s &#34;Tiny Dancer&#34; playing happily in the background.

Service is efficient and occasionally helicopter-ish on a slower night, but still knowledgeable on the menu and able to give strong recommendations. At my past visit, we asked for a dry, full-bodied bottle of wine, and were quite pleased with the selection, one of many under $40.

For our accompanying small bites, we split the Shaved Brussel Sprout Salad with pecorino and small morsels of crispy proscuitto tossed throughout. While the lemon dressing suffered from a heavy hand of vinegar that overpowered the meaty bits of ham, the creaminess of the pecorino with the airy green shavings redeemed the dish and made it worthwhile. The Hummus with grilled pita was even fresher, and although the cheese selections weren&#39;t particularly inspiring and missed a bit on temperature, it was one of the largest plates I&#39;ve seen, with 5-6 servings of each cheese, and a choice of 3 available for $15.

For a local, casual dinner where wine and conversation are to be the stars, Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar should not be overlooked."

I was meeting a good friend for happy hour.

Suddenly, our waitress breezes by at 6:40. &#34;Last call for happy hour,&#34; she says. &#34;But doesn&#39;t it end at 7?&#34; I ask. Nope. Apparently all drink orders have to be in 20 minutes before, despite it being a small place and not super busy. when we try to order  another at 6:50, we are charged full price and given a smirk.

We ordered the Mac n Cheese, tomato salad, prosciutto wrapped dates, cheese, and pulled pork sandwich (without slaw). All of it was fantastic! We didn&#39;t order wine, but they seemed to have a good list. 

My friends felt a 4 star rating is due because the bar tender/waitress/maybe owner(?) was on the phone a lot and seemed to be yelling at someone. Probably should be a 4.5. If I lived there, I&#39;d go all the time."

Uggh... 

Ah, to elaborate: how does one mess up slicing a bunch of salami and prosciutto anyway? Leave it to this dining establishment to perfect this trick: for the salami, the pieces (all 3 of them) were too huge to eat uncut. The prosciutto was on the fatty side and anemically pale. 

Our mains came out in a timely manner yet this was the one silver lining. The burgers were okay but nothing to write home about and more cooked than requested. The pasta with shrimp was mostly the latter. Comparatively, I lucked out by asking for my pulled pork to have sauce on the side and somewhat enjoyed this crispy but quite salty dish.

Someone--seemingly the owner--stopped by to check on us but how does a customer relay that the whole menu needs to be scrapped? Kiddos for trying but...sigh... such disappointment from a wine bar. Who would have thought?"

Nice selection of small plates, and other foodie delights like cheeses and salmon, but I opted for the burger, which was very good. Tricky thing on the wine list that gives prices for a 1/2 carafe (2/3s of a bottle) between the price for a glass and a bottle. Easy to get confused and think you&#39;re getting a better bargain than you actually are. Nice to have the 1/2 carafe option; you just have to pay attention.

To start, we had the Marinated Artichoke to share and it was a tasty refreshing dish. My date of the evening had the burger, which he said was delicious, and I had the salt cod fish pie. What I loved about my dish was that it also came with plenty of crusty buttery slices of bread.

The service here is friendly and quick. Our waitress was there for me when my wine glass was nearly empty, ready to refill it.

When my roommate and I moved in a couple of blocks away last month, we were famished and needed a place to chill and enjoy some good food. Luckily, we stumbled upon the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar!

We first went here for brunch with a couple of friends and were seen immediately. I am embarrassed to say that I forgot my waitress&#39;s name, but she was absolutely lovely and catered to all of our needs. When I could not decide between the gumbo (I love gumbo) and Eggs Benedict, she surprised me with a small portion of gumbo so that I could experience the best of both worlds! In case you&#39;re wondering, both the gumbo and Eggs Benedict were outstanding! I have never had a waitress do anything for me like this before...especially not in New York City! Anyway, this just shows how impeccable the service is at Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar.

The next time I went here was for dinner a week ago, and again I experienced fantastic service with a different waitress and bartender. They are very personable and check in on you enough, but not too much, like when you&#39;re taking a messy bite out of your burger with guacamole. The drinks here are very tasty too and reasonably priced. My friend and I had a great time that evening thanks to the food, drinks, and especially the impeccable service by the staff. I see that there have been complaints about the service in the past, but I can attest that both times I&#39;ve been, we were treated like royalty. This has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in my new neighborhood! My only wish is that they would start implementing endless brunch on the weekends so we don&#39;t have to travel into Manhattan!"

The wine selection is fair, but if you were to opt for a cocktail you may be disappointed with the craftsmanship.

Nonetheless, what left a bad taste in my mouth was that we had walked in around 4PM looking for drinks and some bites. They said their kitchen was closed, which is reasonable given the time, and that they would simply give us some almonds and olives on which to nibble.

The almonds and olives came and tasted rather stale and plain. Upon receiving the bill, the almonds cost $7 and the olives another $5. We felt that they misrepresented themselves and gave us the impression that the small bowls of nuts and olives would be complimentary given that we ordered several drinks. The dollar amount isn&#39;t of any concern, as we were in the neighborhood prior to a $400 dinner anyway, but it&#39;s the approach and the possible intentional misinformation that rubbed me the wrong way."

And we weren&#39;t disappointed.  This place isn&#39;t fancy but it&#39;s a solid neighborhood hangout.  This has to be one of the only spots in Brooklyn Heights where you can get a glass of wine for $6.50--and a decent one, at that.  There were higher-quality wine options too, and they also happened to have my date&#39;s favorite kind of beer, plus an intriguing-looking cocktail menu.

I can&#39;t speak for the rest of the food but the lemon-white bean crostini (which we ordered on the recommendation of the bartender) was fantastic.  The bread was perfectly crispy, the bean dip light and flavorful.

The warm pretzel bites are great, probably my favorite thing that I&#39;ve had there. 

I&#39;ve ordered the cheese plate on two separate occasions and thought that it was much smaller the second time. The prices of the cheeses may have changed, which could account for the smaller portions, but I still think the cost was a little steep for the quantity.

The food was a great price point for the area, and I loved what I got which was the burger with gruyere and fried onions.

The salad that came with it was appreciated as I need more green in my diet usually. I tried a new Ommegang brew that I hadn&#39;t tried yet (Rare Vos, a little too syrupy for my taste but I think would be better if I drank it faster/while it was cold). 

My friend was a little disappointed with the warm shaved brussel sprouts salad with pancetta, Parmesan and lemon - it was kind of lacking in some flavors, and instead of being full or bits of brussel sprouts it looked simply like alfafa sprouts with a few measly pieces of pancetta.

When customers come into your near empty restaurant and pleasantly explains they are in a hurry, you should do one of two things: (a) smile and say no worries I&#39;ll take care of you or (b) smile and say you are sorry but your restauarant cannot accomodate a rushed meal.

What you should not do is get defensive and explain how you would never hold up a meal and point out the restaurant is near empty so nothing should take that long.

What the customer is really asking you to do is to tell the chef so he knows ... this table is (unfortunately) in a hurry.

Furthmore, when an unusual amount of time later the appetizer comes out and you are reminded to bring the cold soup and panini sandwich without waiting for the appetizer to be finished, don&#39;t point out they are taking longer because the appetizer is a cold enteree (so is the gazpacho).

Finally, when the customer inquires after 15 minutes where their cold soup and sandwich might be, don&#39;t begin an arguement with the customer that ends with you telling them they have attitude!? And then continue to badger the customer on said topic, pointing out all things you think you did right.

That said, the food here is fresh and delicious and under very specific circumstances I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find myself eating here again, obviously, never if I&#39;m pressed for time.

Final note: I&#39;m giving this place a 3, a part of me wants to give it a 2 and if the waitress had been delightful, I would have given this place a 4. One final note on the waitress, I don&#39;t think she was intentionally being a jerk, I think that perhaps, she isn&#39;t well-suited to customer service of this kind, she takes things too personally and reacts to them too defensively."

The place is small, intimate. The glass window-fronts give you a perfect perch for people-watching. The wine list is quite decent (as you&#39;d suspect at a wine bar) and service was quick. Fresh glasses of Shiraz made it to my table as quickly as I could drink them (... perhaps too quickly, but that&#39;s my fault).

The food menu consists of lighter bites. The beet ravioli was fantastic, but the portion was moderate. I assume you could get more than one dish to satisfy a larger appetite, but I wouldn&#39;t come here looking to leave completely full."

I arrived in between lunch and dinner when I know they shut down the kitchen for an hour or so and that was fine because I hadn&#39;t really planned on eating. I was just waiting for a friend for a drink. When I got there, there was a table of 6, two people at the bar and maybe 2 tables of 2 sitting outside. The 2 people inside w/ me left at the same time leaving just me and the table of 6. After about 10 minutes of sitting there I was finally able to order my drink. After another 10 - 15 minutes, I got my drink. A little bit after that my friend called to say she couldn&#39;t make it. I decided I was a little hungry and asked to see a menu as it was getting somewhat close to when the kitchen would open for dinner so I asked for a menu. I was reminded that the kitchen was closed but a cheese plate was available and then the waitress walked away. OK fine, I decided I would order the cheese plate and despite the fact that I had closed the menu, kept my hand on it to hopefully signify I wanted to order AND tried to get the waitress&#39;s attention, it simply never happened. It was almost as if I had a neon sign over my head saying IGNORE ME, I REALLY JUST CAME IN TO SIT ON YOUR BAR STOOL. 

Anyway, now I&#39;m just annoyed and want to leave so I take out my wallet and managed to signify to the waitress I wanted my bill. After an eternity she brings it to me. Fortunately it took another eternity for her to come back to me because as it turned out, she charged me for the wrong glass of wine. By this time maybe 2 tables of 2 had come in BUT COME ON! 

If the place was packed AND there weren&#39;t other people working there with her I might cut the place some slack but their complete and utter disdain for some of their patrons was sad and i can honestly say I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d go back after that."

Forget that we had burgers and she made us sit there and wait for 10 minutes for condiments, then came over and mumbled &#34;how is everything&#34;, then we told her and we waited another full 5 minutes til the burger was cold. It didn&#39;t matter that much. Really. Everyone makes mistakes and I&#39;ve done it myself. What mattered is that we were there for a full 2 hours tonight and she never smiled. She was so clearly miserable and so full of disdain (for us?) that it was awkward. She was waiting on a table full of restaurant people (20 plus years in NYC) and we were all baffled by her inability to be pleasant (she was cordial at best, but hardly). Our friend who got their first said the bartender was no better (uppity is how she put it). Personally I have opened some of the most expensive restaurants in NY (hired and trained the staff) and the one thing I can&#39;t tolerate is a staff that treats their guests like they are not cool enough or worthy enough to be there. In that regard, this place gets 2 stars. 

To be fair, the food was lovely (4 stars). The dates with blue cheese and prosciutto was rich and luscious as an app. The octopus was tender and plush and perfectly paired with white beans (and that is really hard to accomplish!) The burgers were good (if a little over cooked and cold by the time we got some mayo) but the wine list was nice and affordable.

Over all the place is cute. Nice ambiance, tasteful little space, bright and airy but there are just too many places that make you feel welcome, or at the very least appreciate your business to put up with the flat out ambivalence  we experienced (that said, the busser was super nice! and very gracious!).

I&#39;m gonna say maybe our waitress was having a bad day and leave it at that, but come on people, this is called THE SERVICE INDUSTRY."

FOOOOOOOD POISON-ING.  Yes, this place managed to poison myself and a friend.  I should have known better, oh why does hindsight have to be 20/20.  Came to this place after being told of a two hour wait at Jack the Horse Tavern.  Walking around we smelled this place, looked nice inside, and a decent crowd inside.  So in we walked.  I ordered a burger and a friend who was also poisoned ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  When I ordered the burger, the waitress didn&#39;t ask how I wanted my burger cooked (WARNING SIGN) and I also specially requested manchego cheese on my burger rather than the options they had.  As she walked away, realizing that I didn&#39;t get to request the doneness of my burger, I asked for it to be medium rare.  When I got home, I suddenly felt ill.  Five hours later watching the sun rise on the porcelain throne I was thorough dead inside.  I&#39;ve never had that bad of a food poisoning incident since visiting China, this most definitely takes the number two spot of horrible dining experiences.

Avoid this place at all costs if you value regular bowel movements."

Cocktails range from $10-12 - just OK.  I sampled a few and wasn&#39;t really blown away by any.  Very nice wine selection (obviously) and although it&#39;s a wine bar they do have a beer menu which is a plus.  I might go back if I&#39;m craving a nice glass of wine.

I lived in the neighborhood until last November and this was one of my go-to places.  Their wine selection is fabulous and reasonably priced.  I am very very picky about my wines (to the point where I usually will not order wine except at the best places and settle for beer).  I&#39;ve never had a wine here that I didn&#39;t like.

Their burgers are just great.  Probably the best burger I&#39;ve had at a place that humbly offers burgers and isn&#39;t a steak house or gourmet restaurant that prides itself on its burgers.  The bun is just the right amount of tough/crispy while being soft enough you can bite through it easily and the burger is always cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt for my tastes.  

Their white bean crostini is also super tasty and I&#39;ve never had a small plate there that I was disappointed in.  

If someone offers me a free meal at a &#34;fancy&#34; place nearby or this, I&#39;ll take the fancy place, but if it&#39;s this or a nearby ale house or other pubs, I&#39;ll take the BH Wine Bar hands down."

I used to live two blocks away, and I kid you not, being close to the BK Heights Wine Bar was something that helped make my decision to move there.  (I thought, &#34;It will be my new Ost!&#34;)  And to this day, it&#39;s what I miss the most about living in Brooklyn Heights.  

The place is just so freaking adorable.  Corner windows, quaint sign, candles on the table.... such a good place to bring someone OR to just bring yourself and your New Yorker.

We enjoyed everything except the octopus and that&#39;s probably because they initially brought us CHIPIRONES EN SU TINTA Calamari in its own ink, which we thought was octopus and enjoyed it so much that when they took it away and told us they brought the right order we didn&#39;t care for the octopus.  We also drank the mango sangria which was good seemed like it was missing something but I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on it.  

Overall we enjoyed almost everything and had a great time.  The atmosphere is nice, the staff are very friendly and nice.

If you don&#39;t agree, you&#39;ve probably never seen the dance live. Add blueberry, pomegrante sangria by the pitcher and some delicate small plates to share with your mate, and you&#39;ve got THE perfect date night. 

My hubby surprised me with reservations here on our anniversary trip to NYC as a nod to our honeymoon in Barcelona. It was everything we could&#39;ve asked for on this occasion. It took us right back to those days in Spain where we wandered Las Ramblas, hand in hand as husband and wife for the very first time ever. So perfect. 

We enjoyed every dish we sampled, the croquettes, scallops, bravas patas, to name a few. The sangria was strong and delicious. Service was prompt and prices were what we were used to paying for tapas. 

I would absolutely recommend a meal here especially on a date and definitely not without a flamenco performance!! Check their websites for showtimes! They are fantastic!! A must experience for any romantic!"

Albondigas (meatballs)
PROS
-great flavor: the sauce is not quite barbecue but it&#39;s similar
-good sized meatballs: not so small where you can squish two in your mouth to equal one bite
-not overcooked: the meatball was nice and soft, not hard - it denotes a good combination of meat, stuffing, and binder.

CONS
-not much to it other than meatballs and sauce.

--------

Roasted Brussels Sprouts
PROS
-fantastic quantity for sharing.  It took us awhile to finish this dish actually.
-good flavors, well seasoned and not over seasoned
-not burnt brussels sprouts

CONS
-I had a couple soggy pieces but it wasn&#39;t too bad overall

--------

Crab Crepe Dumplings: I wasn&#39;t expecting this to be in dumpling form because it said &#34;crepes&#34; on the menu but this was ridiculously tasty.
PROS
-great flavors: good amount of crab but not overwhelmingly all-crab
-not too salty

CONS
-too good for such few pieces, wish they had more but I understand this is hard with crab

--------

Duck Breast wrapped in (what I think is) Iberico Ham in balsalmic glaze and roasted pecans
PROS
-amazing flavor, the sweetness of the pecans and the drizzle with the saltiness of the ham went really well with the savory duck breast
-fantastic quantity to share
-not overcooked: duck was really tender

CONS
-can be slightly salty (but there is bread served with olive oil for the table which goes well with this dish)

--------

Gambas/Shrimp in Garlic Oil
PROS
-really easy to share.
-addicting: there is something about bite-size shrimp that got us eating this really quickly, we actually ordered two orders of this.
-shrimp was fresh: it had that crisp bite to it when your teeth sink into it and not the freezer-burned mush texture that sometimes come with frozen shrimp.
-not overwhelming in spice even though it does have some heat

CONS
-too oily: but the garlic oil is great with the bread
-a bit too salty for me.

--------

Oysters in Lemon Foam: this was new for me.  I&#39;ve never had lemon foam but going to assume that it&#39;s to replace the lemon wedges that we squeeze on top.  Also, the Spanish have this with a special type of champagne wine.  I don&#39;t particularly care for the wine, but the foam was quite awesome.

PROS
-sweet oysters, not briny.  This is totally subjective to what kind of oysters you like though.  I can&#39;t stand briny oysters and so this really worked for me.
-the lemon foam was really cool as it reduced the amount of liquids in the oyster shell that could dribble all over your chin

CONS
-a selection of oysters would be great

--------

Patatas Bravas: the standard Spanish homestyle potato &#34;fries&#34; that come in special aioli.  I&#39;ve had multiple versions of this with different kinds of aioli.  While I can&#39;t say I loved this dish, it wasn&#39;t bad at all.  I&#39;m just not a potatoes kind of girl.

PROS
-great quantity to share: I don&#39;t even think we finished this dish (but we did order quite a bit)
-good flavors: not overly salty or over-seasoned
-crispy potatoes and not soaked in oil

CONS
-if you don&#39;t eat this fast enough, the aioli will make the potatoes soggy as it is drizzled on top.

--------

Seared Pork Belly: THIS was ridiculously good.  
PROS
-very hefty portion, good to share between two to three people, but it&#39;s good enough where you&#39;d want to get two orders
-crispy exterior but soft and tender overall
-saltiness of the meat went well with the poached/seared apples and the sweetness of the glazed pecans

CONS
-none

--------

Quail Eggs on Toast
PROS
-shareable for a party of three, otherwise, get a second order
-cute and well plated

CONS
-it&#39;s like a mini egg done over-easy over toast.  Nothing really to write home about except I could probably make a bigger version of it at home for breakfast.

This is a really nice place to grab a few bites if not many bites and try different plates.  The one thing I don&#39;t really like too much is how dark it was on the inside, and we actually had a seat by the window.  It&#39;s hard to see what I&#39;m eating and while it may be a personal preference, I do like SOME kind of light when it gets dark outside.  Definitely will be back though!"

The BF &amp; I are usually hesitant when going out for Spanish tapas in Manhattan, mostly because it can be a huge rip-off.  Las Ramblas in the West Village is my favorite to date, but Nai was pretty good too.

The BF had himself some mango sangria, which he really enjoyed.  With the recommendations of the waitress, we ordered six dishes to share.  All of them were good except for the shrimp in garlic sauce (which is usually a solid choice).  It was served at room temperature when it should be sizzling hot.  The Chilean sea bass, anchovies over toast, and brussel sprouts were my favorites of the night.

Glad we tried Nai, but don&#39;t need to come back."

Also, the various flavors of sangria this establishment will keep you coming! Mango sangria is my favorite :3 

The crab stuffed avocado is delicious! Some may not think it&#39;s worth it, because it&#39;s literally a crab salad in two halves of an avocado, but the flavors and creaminess of it complement each other really well. This is a very fatty dish though, so not recommended if you&#39;re watching your fat intake.

Chorizo a la plancha was good too! It comes in 4 rolls! 

The mussels (Mejillones Avoa) were cooked very well! All of them were open, but not cooked too long where they were too tough to finish eating. Sauce wasn&#39;t overpowering, but definitely gave it a lot of flavoring. 

The skirt steak was good, but nothing about it really stood out to me. 

Overall, a pleasant experience here! Not a big fan of the noise and light level of this place though; I find it a tad bit too dark and noisy here, but it&#39;s not that big of a deal. Might get a little difficult to talk to your companion."

The food is amazing. 2-3 tapas per person is a good amount of food. It can get busy on the weekends, so making a reservation is a good idea. On the weekdays, it is easier to get a table without reservation. Getting a mixture of seafood and meat is a good way to go.

Food:
Churracso Arriero (Shirt steak)  - good choice if you like meat. sliced pieces of steak. 

Tostado de lubina (chilean sea bass wrapped in toast with serrano ham wrapped asparagus spears) - This is my favorite. Its crispy outside, sweet  and moist inside with the sea bass.

Chipirones en su tinta (calamari in its own ink) - this is a ok fish. I like others more.

sardina a la plancha (grilled seasoned sardines over toast) - this is a large sardine over toast. you get a small fish bones and all. I like it.
Good bread wish it was warm/toasted

Boquerones (basque anchovies over toast) - similar to the sardines, but the smaller amount of fish, but very strong taste"

I&#39;ve been to Nai a few times now and would definitely recommend if you&#39;re looking for a spot to do group events since you can make reservations ahead of time. I also like how the tapas are a little more affordable than other tapas places in the city. 

This is more casual but food is still really good! We had 7 large portions of tapas amongst 6 of us and it was plenty! The coconut crepe, fried goat cheese, and cheese plates were really good! 

They also have Flamenco night on Thursday and Saturday nights! I&#39;ve been once and it&#39;s lots of fun."

I highly recommend the pollo al ajillo- garlic potato chicken. Till this day I am thinking about how perfectly flavored it was. Next time I will try all their other hot dishes- as for the tapas on toast, I think it is best to skip those as it is nothing that will blow you away and it was too much bread in my opinion."
nai-tapas-bar-new-york,Molly T.,8R16InoIf-JheYnh9EOR7w,"New York, NY",1,1,1,615,406,43JaWwSOgFNMB7yNVP_KEA,5.0,2016-01-09,"Nai holds a special place in my heart. For no substantial reason, really. When I joined Yelp a year ago, I was a mere plebeian who had no idea how to navigate the endlessly complex waters of the New York food/drink scene. What does one do in this situation? Bookmark. Hyperventilate due to option overload. Bookmark some more. One of the first places I landed on--and forgot about not long after--was Nai Tapas Bar. So when I came here on Thursday night, I worried that my expectations were far too high. But they weren&#39;t. Tabula Rasa Molly has some sense in her. 

First: the space. Basement-level venue (needs to be given the flamenco!), not as much room as you&#39;d initially think. The food, drinks, service and flamenco were all noteworthy--my only real qualm here is the very real potential for claustrophobia. As in, I learned way too much about the lives of the couple sitting next to us. You&#39;d also be wise to make a reservation--at least on Thursdays/Saturdays (flamenco nights). 

Now onto what y&#39;all really care about: ingestibles. To start, we ordered a half pitcher of the Blueberry Pomegranate Champagne Sangria. They were unfortunately out of the mango (our first choice), but this was a damn good second. Almost too good. In other words, be careful. You can hardly taste the alcohol. You may be inclined to drink it quickly. Don&#39;t (but do order it!). 

Quick note about the food before listing the damage: one simple but brilliant feature on the menu here is the small/large option (with corresponding prices, obviously). I&#39;ve been to a number of tapas bars at this point, and I don&#39;t think I had ever seen this before my visit to Nai. If you&#39;re like me and want to try as much as is humanly (and fiscally) possible, opt for the small--this is possible with most plates, just a few exceptions--and order a wider variety. You may be thinking that this is a trap: yet another frightening high tapas bill may ensue. But fear not! Not only was this some of the best Spanish food I&#39;ve had in NYC, but our bill was $70 for a half pitcher of sangria and five plates. For tapas in New York, that is a DEAL. 

Now for that damage I mentioned:
-Aguacates Rellenos (A++)
Holy guacamole. More like a whole(y) avocado. This was easily my favorite dish of the night. Far more flavorful than I ever could have imagined. This is real, delicious lump crab, prepared with corn and a few other minor players. Overall, the texture is more creamy than anything else, but the corn (and something else I couldn&#39;t discern) gave the whole thing a subtle crunch which wasn&#39;t necessary but was certainly appreciated. My only complaint: I wanted more crab meat. And more avocado. Okay, I just wanted this dish x2.

-Croquetas de Jamon (A+)
Again, the flavors were standout. Given that it&#39;s all one big mixture inside of a croquette, it&#39;s hard to go into detail. But it&#39;s one big mixture of yummy goodness and I&#39;m not going to question why and how these unassuming bites became so tasty. Note: this type of thing could easily go waaaay overboard on the salt. Not that case here. Well. Freakin. Done.

-Gambas al Ajillo (A)
Standard for tapas. Sorry for the redundancy here, but again, these were seasoned beautifully. I was wary given a few negative reviews that highlighted excessive salt, but this wasn&#39;t my experience. Six shrimp for the small option. Left me wanting more but that&#39;s the literal price we paid for going with the small option. 

-Albondiguillas Estofadas (combo of pork/beef I think, served in brandy sauce) (A)
I would never seek this kind of thing out on my own. But when I&#39;m out to eat, I like to live a little. The meatballs were--surprise, surprise--cooked perfectly. But the real star of this dish was the brandy sauce. It managed to strike a perfect balance between sweet and savory, which paired wonderfully with the inherent salty quality of the meat (can&#39;t really avoid that when pork is involved). This is the kind of sauce that you&#39;ll want to ladle onto your plate so you can douse every last morsel in it. That good, folks.

-Salted cod w/ chickpea puree (A-/A)
The cod is one of the few dishes here that only comes in one size. But for just $15, you pretty much get an entree-sized plate of fish. No question, other restaurants in the city could easily offer this same portion for twice the price. Pretty simple dish--not much flair to it despite how aesthetically pleasing it is. Between being quite full when it arrived and the fact that all prior dishes had been bursting with flavor, this one didn&#39;t wow me as much. It was still yummy (especially the chickpea puree) but not quite at the level of the others. 

Lastly, the flamenco: Fun, festive, loaded with talent and LOUD. The musician had a soulful, raspy voice and was quite the whiz on the guitar. The dancers were even more passionate--quintessential flamenco. I&#39;ve seen flamenco five or six times in my life, and this seemed pretty authentic to me. Reminded me of Spain (never a bad thing)."

They started us off with some bread and what looked like olive oil.
We ordered some Blueberry Pomegranate Sangria &amp; a pitcher of Champagne Sangria. Both were sweet and refreshing.

Mejillones Avoa - mussels in paprika-wine sauce:
Mussels were cooked well. They weren&#39;t tough and all the shells opened. The sauce was delicious and had just a slight kick.

Pollo al Ajillo - chicken &amp; potatoes in garlic sauce:
The chicken soaked up the thick sauce and tasted juicy. 

Rabo Guisado - braised oxtail:
I wasn&#39;t able to take an appealing picture of the oxtail, but it was also delicious. It was braised to the point where the meat was just falling off the bone. The sauce was amazing as well.

They also have live flamenco shows on the weekends if you&#39;re into that. If you&#39;re coming with a large group, definitely try to make a reservation on Opentable or call ahead, because it is a little cramped in there, but they have a decent sized bar and the food is good."

We came in on a Friday around 8pm and this place was packed. We stood around for about 20 minutes before we were finally seated (will make a reservation next time!). Our server was super helpful with making food and sangria recommendations. To give us an idea of how big each tapas would be, she told us that 3-4 tapas would make a filling meal for one person. 

I love the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. It&#39;s fruity, not overly sweet, and contains a satisfactory amount of alcohol. The champagne sangria is ok but extremely inferior compared to the blueberry pomegranate sangria. I need to come back during Happy Hour for their $20 pitchers of sangria.

Some of my favorite tapas from their menu are:
- Pelotillas de Queso de Cabra (friend goat cheese, serrano ham, tomato, toast). If you&#39;re a fan of goat cheese, you will love this. The ball of goat cheese is crispy on the outside and savory/creamy on the inside. The small plate comes with 3 of these.
- Pulpo a la Gallega (boiled octopus). SO tender and perfectly seasoned. 
- Filloas De Coco Rellenas De Mariscos (coconut crepe, scallops, shrimp, crab meat). Creamy delicious seafood wrapped in a crispy skin. Too bad the small plate only comes with 2 of these :(

I was not a huge fan of the avocado stuffed with crab meat or the calamari in its own ink. I got sick of the avocado dish after a few bites because the excessively creamy texture was nauseating. I love calamari so I had high expectations for the calamari in ink. However, the taste of the calamari was much more &#34;fishy&#34; than other calamari dishes I&#39;ve had (possibly due to the ink?).

Overall I enjoyed the drinks, the food, the service, and the atmosphere at Nai Tapas Bar. I will be coming back!"

Space was tight and cozy, comfortably tucked away on 1st Ave just out of the St. Marks zone. We had the most popular items on the menu - shrimp (Gambas Al Ajillo), skirt steaks (Churrasco Arriero), Patatas Bravas and the cheese plate. Though we missed happy hour, the $30 sangria pitcher is still a solid deal. The two of us finished everything on the table PLUS two servings of bread.

I&#39;m a huge tapas person, and it&#39;s hard to come across a place that knocks it out of the park every. single. time. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that their wine is great and their sangria deal is by far one of the best in NYC. Definitely a regular spot I visit with my boyfriend, and I just recently had a huge birthday dinner with some of my closest friends. Of course, service is impeccable (many thanks to the manager Raul), and everyone there is warm, accommodating, and friendly.

Must Haves:
Pulpo a la Gallega - I literally always get this. What looks like a simple octopus dish, but incredibly tender, juicy, and just the right amount of seasoning. The olive oil and spices are also a perfect condiment to dip your complimentary bread in.

Coles de Bruselas con Lacon - No brainer. Crispy brussel sprouts, full of flavor, and you have bits of pork belly in there too because who doesn&#39;t love some bacon in their veggies?

Ravioli de Calabacin - This is actual heaven, zucchini + goat cheese + bacon-wrapped date neatly served for the perfect bite. The goat cheese just oozes into your mouth when you bite into it... too yummy to describe, sorry.

Caracoles - For the more &#39;adventurous&#39; eater, a.k.a Escargot. You seriously can&#39;t go wrong with that garlic/butter sauce."

The service was amazing - very nice, attentive, and offered great recommendations. 

We ordered
- pitcher of red sangria (4/5). Great deal for a group! Tasty and refreshing. We got about 5 full glasses per pitcher. 
- gambas al ajillo (4/5). Fresh shrimp in a flavorful zesty garlic sauce. Great take on a traditional dish. 
- pelotillas de queso de cabra (5/5). One of my favorites dishes of the night. It was a fried goat cheese ball wrapped in ham served with toast. 
- coles de bruselas con lacon (5/5). I&#39;m a huge fan of Brussel sprouts and this was such a great way to serve it. The sprouts were nice and crispy. The pork belly added a nice saltiness to the dish. The spicy mustard aioli complemented the tangy apply and zesty orange emulsion. A must order! 
- patatas bravas (3/5). Compared to all the other dishes, this one was more bland to me. It was fried potatoes with a spicy tomato sauce. Nothing special in my opinion. There are way to many other great dishes to try! 
- tortilla espanola (3.5/5). A traditional omelettes with onions and potatoes. A very traditional dish done well but overshadowed by the flavors of all the other great items. 
- churrasco arriero (4/5). Cooked perfectly medium.  Marinated well and served with chimichurri sauce. 
- albondiguillas estofadas (4/5). Pork and beef meatballs. Amazing flavor! We were so full at this point I don&#39;t think I could fully appreciate it but it was delicious! 

There were 6 of us and this was more than enough food! Would definitely recommend this place!"

You get your familiar tapas favorites like sangria and bacon wrapped dates. But then you&#39;re intrigued and you order tempura fried short rib, and you&#39;re blown away. You decide to try the zucchini stuffed with goat cheese and you&#39;re euphoric (and it&#39;s not just the sangria talking). 

Service was very professional and I also enjoyed the interior; you feel like you&#39;re at a tapas bar in Spain. Our waiter made sure we ordered just the right amount of food.

- Ham Croquette was flavorful and delicious but very tiny (3 pieces). It&#39;s too tiny that the presentation was quite awkward.
- Meatball was full of flavor, juicy, and super delicious!
- Mussel was good but nothing special, quite a lot for the price though.
- Brussels Sprout and Pork Belly was a nice combination, yummy!
- Patatas Bravas was super delicious! Must get.
- Coconut Crepe stuffed Scallop and Shrimp was interesting, but the stuffing was quite loose, a bit disappointed, flavor-wise was very good!
- Pork Belly, there no fat part I believe.. (I&#39;m not sure) I was a bit confused too that the pork belly is all lean, but still tastes very juicy and fluffy!
- Paella Noodle, the dish was lukewarm; the noodle served was quite dry... was probably the biggest disappointment of the meal. A lot of mussels and clams though... 
- Oxtail was not bad, but a lot of fat parts which I&#39;m not a fan of it.
- Red sangria was quite good but not superb, maybe I&#39;ll try other flavor next time!

Very good dishes: pinxo de chistorra con huevo de codorniz, churrasco arriero, meijillones avoa, caravoles

Average: coles de bruselas con lacon, gambas al ajillo

Just ok: croquetas de pollo and croquetas de jamon,  filloas de coca rellas de mariscos, tabla de jamon queso.

The Gambas al ajillo were garlicky, but not too oily. The patatas bravas were super crispy. The Spanish tortilla was huge and delicious. My friend ordered a steak tapas (can&#39;t remember the name) and the meat was so tender. All very yummy! Definitely my favorite tapas place in the city so far."

Happy hour drink specials are great - we shared a pitcher of mango sangria for $22. It&#39;s good, and just the right amount of strong to get you sorta-kinda tipsy towards the end.

Tapas were also delicious, but on the pricy side, considering the portions. My friend and I got 4 different tapas (I recommend shrimp in garlic sauce!) - all of which were great, but definitely not filling. We also got 2 dessert tapas - the nutella stuffed churros and the flan; again, delicious, but definitely not worth the $7 price tag. All in all, our total bill came out to about $80 - pretty steep considering my hunger wasn&#39;t fully satisfied!

I have to say that I liked this place mostly because the quality of service was on point. Our waiter was super nice, and even the busboys were so gracious and polite! It&#39;s always a nice refresher to see genuinely great service! Would&#39;ve given this place 3 stars if the service was meh."

Churrasco Arriero - skirt steak with garlic and spicy cherry peppers
- The steak was cooked and seasoned well. The sauce that came with this was very flavorful. The peppers on the side had a nice spicy kick, which was nice.

Mejillones Avoa - mussels in a paprika wine sauce
- The mussels tasted very fresh. The paprika wine sauce reminded me of spicy ramen soup lol

Short Rib Tempura 
- I really liked this dish. It came with 3 generous sized portions of short rib. I really like the contrast between the soft tender short rib with the crunchy tempura shell. This came with thin noodles on the side that seemed to resemble vermicelli. The short rib was excellent. The noodles were too salty for my taste.

Pulpo a la Gallega - boiled octopus
- I prefer my octopus grilled because I feel like doing so de-slimes it. This dish was okay. I don&#39;t think I would get this again, but my friends seemed to like it.

I would definitely come back again."

The site said there was no availability for 7 pm but when I walked in, there were only a few tables dining and they seated me immediately, while I waited for my two friends to show up. It started getting packed around 8 or so.

Happy hour is until 7, including Fridays! You can get $20 pitchers of sangria and there are 6 different flavors you can choose from. We tried the mango and the champagne. I liked the champagne better because it wasn&#39;t as fruity. But as a person who isn&#39;t a fan of super fruity drinks, I must say that even the mango was good. It wasn&#39;t too sweet and was very refreshing.

For food, we decided to order a bunch of tapas and share everything. Here&#39;s what we ordered:

Croquetas de Jamon (Serrano ham croquettes) - these were amazing! They came out piping hot. There was more cheese than there was ham, which I liked.

Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce) - the flavor was great, but the &#39;sauce&#39; is really just a garlic oil. It was a little too oily for me.

Pulled pork sliders - good but not anything special.

Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak sautéed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers) - I would definitely recommend NOT ordering this. It was SO salty. All I could taste was salt, and none of the mentioned flavors. 

Albondiguillas Estofadas (stewed meatballs in a brandy sauce) - this was one of my favorites of the night. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the sauce was really good.

Caracoles (escargot in their &#39;house sauce&#39;) - these were just alright. Again, pretty oily. It tasted like some kind of a butter sauce.

Avocado stuffed with lump crabmeat - this was hands down the best one. They take a whole avocado, cut it in half, and fill it with this creamy (but not overly creamy) crabmeat and corn salad and top it with real bits of bacon. And yes, the crabmeat is real and there&#39;s a good amount of stuffing. It was so good that I was already full when this last dish came out, but I finished all of it because I didn&#39;t want to stop eating it. Ever. 

On top of the great food, our waitress was really nice. She was very attentive, and she even let us hoard that second sangria pitcher, since happy hour was about to be over.

I&#39;ll definitely be back to try some of their other tapas (and sangrias) and of course, get my avocado/crabmeat fix!"

My wife, daughter and I wanted to grab a quick dinner in the East Village before heading to a Broadway show. We went to the restaurant about 6 pm on Saturday night and were seated right away. This is a really nice, comfortable tapas bar. It would be a great date spot.

At the waiter&#39;s recommendation, we ordered a half pitcher of blueberry pomegranate sangria. It was enough for each of bus to have two small glasses. It was very good, not too sweet.

We started with some mixed olives and jamon Iberico. The jamon, kind of a Spanish prosciutto, was excellent. The olives were...olives. Nothing special, a nice complement to the ham.

For tapas, we ordered:
- Ravioli de Calabacin - grilled zucchini wrapped goat cheese topped with a bacon wrapped date, the zucchini and cheese were tasty and mild, the smoky, salty bacon wrapped date was the star of the dish
- Filloas de Coco Rellenas De Mariscos - coconut crepes filled with seafood, the crepes are folded up like little cups, it&#39;s very mild and delicious, there&#39;s a very nice sauce on the plate, I think it was puréed pepper, it was delicious
- Albondiguillas - little pork and beef meatballs in a flavorful brandy sauce, yummy!!

Our total meal was about $100 with the tip. The service was excellent throughout. The plates take a little while to come out. They&#39;re worth the wait. Just drink some sangria and relax!"

The shrimp in garlic and olive oil was delicious, just like it is at every tapas restaurant in the world. The chorizo and quail egg on toast was also very good, and something I haven&#39;t seen before!

The churrasco was ok, but the avocado and crab went un-eaten. Sangria is nothing to write home about."

I seriously haven&#39;t been to a place like Nai&#39;s in a long time; where food is so good, and the price points make your eyebrows go up and down. It was one of my best friends birthday, and we nearly ordered everything on the menu. Why not? It was TREAT YOSELF DAY (we were really treating him, but it felt like our day, too!). 

Let&#39;s see what I can remember:
-Sangrias were potently delicious;
-Mussels marinated in some kind witchcraft, tomato sauce that got us weak in the knees;
-Garlicky shrimp; 
-Crispy, seasoned Brussels sprouts;
-Meatball dish --- that brandy tomato sauce is so good!

I can&#39;t wait to come back here again! Only issues I had were that the hostess or whomever was picking up the phone gave us a hard time making reservations for a table of 5. They got us seated on a tiny-ass table, but we made the best with what we had. What really sold us with this place was the food and the charismatic way the waitress worked with us all evening."

Granted we try to get there when it opens at around 5ish so it isn&#39;t very busy yet. The staff is very accommodating and helpful. 

I don&#39;t usually drink alcohol but the sangria here is pretty good. They have a mango sangria which was very refreshing and you can&#39;t really go wrong with mango anything!

They have a large variety of tapas to choose from. The shrimp in garlic sauce is SO GOOD and dipping the bread in the sauce just makes it even better! The fried goat cheese with tomato over toast was also really good. The different textures and flavors really worked well together. The skirt steak was cooked really well and is kind of a large portion if you get the full size. Any of the potato dishes are good but my favorite is the patatas alioli which is fried potatoes with a creamy garlic sauce. We also got this avocado stuff thing that was DELICIOUS! They literally cut the avocado in half and have this creamy yumminess in the center."

Started with the Patatas Bravas...good god they were spicy. My mouth was on fire but I couldn&#39;t stop eating them.
Then the Gambas Al Ajillo in garlic sause...perfect.  
Then the Pollo Al Ajillo which was OK.  Not too garlicy.
But the COSTILLA TEMPURA...OH MY!  Best I&#39;ve ever had.  The braized short ribs were cooked perfectly.  I&#39;ve could have eaten a few dozen more.  
And to wash it all down, I tried the GISBERGA TRIGO, a wheat ale from Spain.  Again..amazing!"

Reservations were made so we didn&#39;t have to experience a crazy wait time. The wait staff did seem a little overbooked though. We came here with a party of 6 so luckily we got to try about 10-12 different tapas. 

The notable ones were the wine sauce mussels, garlic shrimp, and braised oxtail. Definitely felt like the mussels were worth the price for the portion and the large shrimp order was disappointingly small even for tapas. The Brussel sprouts wth pork belly were good as well. 

For drinks, they were out of the mango sangria unfortunately. But the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria was delicious as well. Overall not the greatest tapas place in East Village, but satisfying enough to give it another try."

We made reservations 2 weeks in advanced specifically to see the Flamenco show which is only on Thursdays and Saturdays. With that said, 2 weeks in advanced, and the 8pm reservations were all already taken, 1030 was all they had. We took it. We got there around 930,  but had a drink at another bar, at around 1010 we showed up for our 1015 reservation. The hostess told us it would be a bit before they had people from the 830 show leaving and they could rearrange tables. Not a problem. We were rewarded with a table that was perfect for Flamenco viewing (which is done in the middle of the long and narrow, basement restaurant). 

Flamenco: They are strict about no pictures or videos during the show, but have no fear, they will let you video/snap during their last song/dance of the night. The guitarist will literally say &#34;and now, picture time&#34; and everyone whips their phone out. Don&#39;t think you can sneak a snap, one of the flamenco dancers will catch you and will shame you. Just wait until the end. The show was about 40 mins, short but very entertaining. I can&#39;t wait to go back to see again, or maybe see in Spain (one can only dream). 

As for tapas: We ordered 1) tableta de queso y jamon serrano 2) aguacate relleno 3) churrasco 4) patatas bravas 5) and a fried goat cheese wrapped in bacon 

Every single one of these I would get again - Which was my favorite? I think I would have to say the stuffed avocado - it was stuffed with crab meat and corn (which gave it a surprisingly good sweetness) and topped with pieces of bacon.  The patatas bravas had a nice kick to them. Sometimes you get them at these places and really, it&#39;s just ketchup, but this was great.  We did not have their sangria (we were recovering from a too happy Friday) but they had many varieties of sangria which I would love to taste.  

Over all, our meal, plus 4 beers (Spaniard beer) plus a show came out to about $85 (sans the tip) - when you put it all in perspective, delicious tapas, refreshing beers, great waiter - it was not a bad price. 

We will be returning!"

Everything on the menu is whatevs now. If you want to come here for good sangria, that&#39;s the one good thing they have that&#39;s above average. Maybe their flamenco dancers during the weekend if you manage to get a reservation or wait for a really long time for a table. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll come back here again though.

Cod fritter-light and fluffy with aioli it was a great snack with beer.

Garlic shrimp-extremely good!

Squid cooked in Ink, served in a tin-great snack with wine.

This same diversity is reflected in that you can order each dish in two sizes: a tapas size or a full meal.  

The date stuffed croquetas were a hell of a spin on the traditional dish--almost like Devils on Horseback meets a normal croquette.  Also a really nice, longer shape as opposed to your traditional larger ball. 

Almejas Diablo had a ton of very plump clams in a nice, spicy sauce that&#39;s great for some bread dipping action. 

Pan Tumaca was a little light on the tomato spread, but the ham and manchego were good enough to eat solo.

Albondiguillas Estofadas are, as the name indicates, mini meatballs.  This makes the meat a little tougher than a normal albondiga; however, they worked really well in the brand sauce which had a nice savory and sweet complimentary relationship.

Pintxo de Chistorra con Huevo de Codorniz  seems to be a lesser loved item, but really worth a try.  Great layering of flavors, especially with the quail egg.

My only qualm?  They&#39;re shamelessly pouring jugs of Carlo Rossi into a fruit/juice combination that, I assume contains some alcohol.  The terrible quality wine aside, all of this should be made a day before and work together to get the full effect with a top off of Sprite for bubbles right before serving.  

If you like Spanish beer, they have a few on draft, so you can avoid spoiling the illusion of being in Spain."

Had a really fun night here that I&#39;ll never forget and I&#39;ll definitely be coming back. We stumbled in here expecting to get a quick bite because we were starving and definitely lucked out. The tapas plates were out of the world. Small portions but jam packed with flavor(just as tapas should be). There was live music playing and a cozy atmosphere, everything was pristine. The HIGHLIGHT of the night was out waiter, David. I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU! Greatest waiter I&#39;ve ever had. Gave us a plate on the house because they ran out of caviar, which was just so sweet. He was friendly, helpful, and hilarious. Great guy, Nai is lucky to have him. Couldn&#39;t give it a full 5 stars because the drinks were a little on the weak side. The sangria did absolutely nothing for me before I just switched the wine(which was really good and not too pricey). Overall, this place is perfect for a friend&#39;s night out, date night, or any type of occasion. The food and service gets 5 stars. Highly recommend!"

Our waiter was so nice to us! He was good with making recommendations based on our preferences and also making sure we were good with the portions we were getting. I had a reservation here and they originally put us in a small table next to the window but we requested to be moved to a more spacious area next to the bar. At some point during dinner, it felt more so like a dive bar because the TV was on. But it was good nonetheless. 

They gave us a lot of bread and good olive oil to go with it. The bacalao frito was not bad. My favorite was its grilled shrimp in garlic sauce. So good! I was convinced to try caracoles...and I was right to be skeptical. I didn&#39;t like it. The beef stew was the best though! Must try! I also tried the sangria and it was HH price.  All in all, I had a blast!

By the time we departed around 9pm, there was a line waiting outside. This place is good for couples or small groups. I highly recommend this place!"

We ordered damn near everything on the menu and it wasn&#39;t all amazing but for the most part I thought it was solid. Highlights include the ablondigas, paella, and cheap happy hour booze. At the end, I think we only paid like $24 each and were there for like 4 hours.

Also, somehow three glasses got broken by the staff during those 4 hours. Like that sorta stuff happens but that&#39;s an insane rate of breakage."

We got lucky and nabbed the table outside (not one of the more popular options if you&#39;re coming for the ambience of the interior). The waitress was super friendly and accommodating, finding extra chairs for our 6 person party to fit.

We got the Almejas Diablo (clams), Mejillones Avoa (mussels), Pelotillas de Queso de Cabra (fried goat cheese), Croqeutas de Jamon (ham croquettes), Patatas Bravas, Chorizo a la Plancha, and Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs). They were all really amazing choices. The ones that came with sauce had us dipping all the bread into them. We also got two pitchers of blueberry sangria, which was delicious.

My favorite part of Nai is the staff, though. The host joked around with me a bit, saying that the waiters would forget us since we were the only ones seated outside, but we had really amazing service throughout the night. Our waitress, Jenny, has such a bright personality with the coolest Dominican-Spanish accent and she really took care of us that night. We had a really relaxed night and it&#39;s due completely to the awesome employees at Nai.

I&#39;m definitely planning on coming back to Nai and trying out an indoor seat to get the full entertainment and ambiance experience!"

Normally, when one goes to a tapas bar/restaurant they expect some sangria with some standard Spanish fare; Nai takes this notion and throws it out the window.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the sangria is excellent, but the plates are the real stars here. Starting off with a cheese plate (Quesos Variados) is a must. They have my all time favorite cheese, Cabrales, which I could rave about endlessly but you should just try it for yourself. The raciones themselves are excellent. Each of them came out relatively quickly and took me on  a flavor adventure. I would definitely recommend any of the shrimp options as well as the stuffed avocado. By the end of the meal I was sufficiently sated, but the story doesn&#39;t end here.

Going on a Thursday brings about an unexpected treat so please make reservations or you&#39;ll end up at the bar (not the worst thing believe me). There is a live flamenco ensemble that just adds to the considerable atmosphere of the restaurant. The performance put a great bow on the entire dining experience and I would definitely recommend Nai to New Yorkers and tourists alike. 

Hope you have a great experience like I did!"

They also offer one happy hour red and white wine at $5. The menu is huge and full of different types of tapas, especially lots of seafood and meat options that work very well with a glass of sangria or wine. I&#39;m a fan of the squid in black ink and avocado with tuna salad. I also had the lightly fried cod and this cooked cubed tuna with tomatoes.

There were several larger parties there (5 or more people) and after working all day and leaving the our kid and getting some time to ourselves this place only gave us a bigger headache. 

With all that said if it wasn&#39;t for the loud ambiance the food, drinks and service warrants the fifth star. Great red sangria, oxtail was good and gambas where excellent. The coconut crepes with seafood where also very good."

I believe her name was Amy. I have never met a nicer or more personable server. She made sure our evening was perfect, even with all the flamenco dancing going on and a pretty packed restaurant. She made great suggestions and was very diligent about checking up on us without being overbearing.  If I had a restaurant, I would definitely steal her away :) 
So if the owner is reading this, please let her know we say a big Thank You! 
And if you are going to eat there, ask for her. 

The Food:

I love the concept of Tapas because I love trying as many different types of food as possible and experiencing the different flavor profiles a restaurant can put together and spotlight.

Croquetas de Jamón: Super Cheesy (i love cheese). Balance with the cheese and ham was a bit off, but it worked. Let it cool down before biting in.

Stuffed Avocados: Sliced in half and stuffed with a crabmeat salad. Sooooo good! Bits of bacon and just creamy enough. Wanted to order two more.

Patatas Bravas: Simple potato dish with tomato sauce. Good to start the night with. Recommend ordering this first to prepare for the more complex flavor dishes.  Done well.

Pintxo de Chistorra con Huevo de Codorniz: Everything about this dish is YES!
Chorizo in the dish was great! The melted Manchego cheese over the pepper and toast with the quail egg on top was perfection. All the flavors married together so well, but you could still taste each one separately. Love, love, love.

Mango Sangria: Need I say more?

Will definitely come back when I&#39;m in New York, for the food and for the service."

and braised ox tail = AMAZING, food was hot &amp; fresh. As far as drinks we ordered a pitcher of Blueberry Pomegranate Sangria that was absolutely DELICIOUS * =] Service was AWESOME!!!

Happy hour included well-priced drinks (beer, wine, sangria) although I wish the sangria were stronger. It seems like they dilute the cheap wine with too much juice and club soda. Andres at the bar was super friendly and happy to recommend food options. The patatas aioli were delish as were the brussels- both highly recommended. The pollo al ajillo was just so-so. The complimentary almond cake was a nice ending surprise. At 8:30pm, a Spanish band and 2 dancers put on an entertaining show."

Little did we know that Saturdays are when the live flamenco performance happens. We arrived just after 7pm and sat down at the bar. Within 5 minutes, there was a line out the door. Talk about serendipitous timing!

The food was pretty tasty overall, though I have had better tapas in the city, this is a good alternative. My friend and I shared their spiced mixed olives, crab salad with avocado, boiled octopus, spicy clams, and the boquerones. Hands down the boquerones (Basque anchovies served on toast) were our favorite (we ordered a second batch) followed by the spicy clams - that sauce was amazing (we even asked for some bread to soak it up). The boiled octopus was succulent but a bit heavy and the avocado/crab salad was pretty bland. We washed it all down with some white sangria, which also wasn&#39;t memorable, but we did drink all of it....

Overall I&#39;d say it is a decent spot. It got exceptionally crowded as the night wore on, so if you are thinking of going on a Flamenco night, plan accordingly."

Everything I&#39;ve ever had at Nai Tapas has been out of this world. The gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp) are to die for. We usually get 2 orders of this when we go. The aguacates renellos (avocado with shrimp and pork on top) were also phenomenal. Croquetas de jamon (ham croquettes), pelotillas de queso de cabra (goat cheese with ham over tomato and toast), patatas bravas (spicy potatoes) and patatas alioli (potatoes in creamy garlic sauce) are some more favorites. You really can&#39;t go wrong with anything though. 

Drink wise, try the calimocho. It&#39;s red wine in Coca Cola, which absolutely sounds strange, but just roll with it. It&#39;s very different, and everyone I&#39;ve recommended it to loved it. Their champagne sangria is also wonderful. 

It does get crowded and the place is on the smaller size, so a reservation isn&#39;t a ad idea especially if you&#39;re going with more than 2 people. 

Price wise you can&#39;t go wrong. I was there tonight with 2 friends. We got 8 drinks between us and about 9 small plates of food. It came to $45 a person before tip. We definitely ordered too much food and we were stuffed! 

I&#39;ve been coming here for years and it gets better and better each time. Whether you&#39;re into seafood, pork, chicken, etc. they have something for you. Nai Tapas also offers a good variety of gluten free and vegetarian food.

Definitely give it a try. The place is small so you have to keep an eye out for it, but it&#39;ll be worth it!"

The service was friendly &amp; attentive, and the sangria was good....unfortunately we were left disappointed by the food. 

First, 2 of the dishes we ordered they didn&#39;t have this particular night, so we had to pick something else. I was really looking forward to having the coconut crepes with shrimp, scallops, &amp; crab but this was one of the dishes they didn&#39;t have. We ordered the piquillo peppers stuffed with cod, the Fideua (Catalan style paella &amp; the fried goat cheese with ham &amp; tomato on toast. 

The piquillo peppers themselves were fine but the salted cod stuffing was inedible, as it was so incredibly salty, like they used a whole bottle of salt for this one dish. The paella was a huge disappointment....presentation wasn&#39;t there at all, and neither were the vegetables! All it consisted of was some shellfish put on top of a bed of angel hair pasta.....and that was it!! The pasta was not &#39;toasted&#39; as the menu stated. This would have been a lot better if it had peppers &amp; other vegetables to liven it up. The goat cheese with ham &amp; tomato was the best of the 3 dishes, but lacked any &#39;wow&#39; factor.

 All in all, very disappointed to come away not full &amp; not satisfied &amp; I would only return for the drinks."

We got to avoid the stampede of people mentioned in the reviews, mainly because it was on a raining Tuesday night.  Started off with a pitcher of blueberry pomegranate sangria (which I was a little hesitant about, since I&#39;ve had a bad history with them sangrias), but for once I was glad the bartender watered them down a little bit so I could enjoy it in stride.  So good!  And especially better since it was priced during happy hour.

We ordered a bunch of dishes (garlic shrimp, octopus, patatas bravas) along with their signature paella.  Everything was delicious.  I ordered their coconut crepes stuffed with scallops, shrimps, and crab claw on a whim because it sounded exotic and it was my favorite dish of the meal next to the paella.  Words cannot describe how good it was!  You could even smell the coconut when they set the dish on the table.

I&#39;d definitely come back to try more of their dishes.  It&#39;s not often you walk into a tapas place where everything you sample is so good."

The pictures for Nai Tapas looked amazing and just what i was looking for, a wide combination of different dishes ranging from seafood to beef. 

Went out with a friend and we ordered the skirt steak plate, the brussel sprouts, some seafood dumpling type dish, can&#39;t remember the name and some wine. Everything was absolutely amazing. The skirt steak was cooked to perfection, still pink in the middle with a nice char on the outside. It was also paired with a nice dipping sauce, a sweet chili type. 

If you&#39;re a brussel sprout fan I highly recommend these. My mouth is watering just thinking about them now. Crunchy outside, soft inside, well done and perfectly cooked. There was some sort of remoulade over it as well that set if off great. 

The last plate we had barely got touched cause we were so full from the bread, wine and rest of the food. I was definitely a fan but wish I got the shrimp in garlic which was a signature dish. 

About $86 for 4 glasses of wine and 3 plates.. Felt it was reasonably priced and Ricky our server was awesome. Definitely heading back again"

1. Jamon Iberico : i love this stuff, so oily and tasty
2. Octopus: Not rubbery at all, it was nice and spongy, but it was a little bland taste-wise, but with octopus i assume its hard to get any flavors really to stick to it
3. pork belly: pretty good, nice presentation and flavor was good, nothing spectacular though
4. Skirt steak: This was my favorite dish after the jamon iberico. The steak was cooked perfectly and the onion dipping sauce it came with was great, it was this mildly spicy pickled onion sauce
5. beef empanadas: these were huge! and the meat filling was delicious

The red sangria was really good as well. What I also loved was the entire ambience of the place, darkly lit with old-style spanish paintings on the wall of flamenco dancers. Really good place for a romantic dinner that wont bust your wallet."

Their sangria was great. Their tapas dishes were good but weren&#39;t anything too praise worthy. If I am around the area, I would come back, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come find this restaurant. But I would recommend to others to hang out with friends with some drinks and food.

The food was incredible. There was so much I couldn&#39;t even try it all (never a bad thing). We had a large party so we had an open bar and they did not skimp. The sangria flowed all night and was delicious. We had so much food and drink I have no idea how it was only $45 per person. 

The flamenco show was unlike anything I have ever seen. Completely surpassed my expectations. The dancers and guitarist were phenomenal. So much passion and skill. They even brought the birthday people on stage for a quick lesson! 

The staff was extremely kind and helpful. Loved the atmosphere. I would recommend this place to everyone and definitely plan on going back. Thank you for a wonderful birthday celebration!"

I was shocked at the prices (the full menu listed on this yelp page does not have accurate prices) and discovered that tapas apparently translates to &#34;tiny, expensive food.&#34; Another translation is &#34;leave broke and still hungry.&#34; The small portion of patatas bravas that we got was $5.50 (the price on yelp says $3.50, which is incorrect.) We also got the small portion of the goat cheese &amp; proscuitto on toast. It was delicious, but it was also pretty expensive, considering you only get 3 pieces. And lastly we got the Churrasco Arriero, because of all of the positive reviews on Yelp about it. I must say that it was good (overcooked though), and we liked the sauce that comes with it, but we got the large portion that cost $19.50 and when it came out, and the waiter put it down I thought &#34;That portion is not worth $19.50.&#34; 

I think in order to enjoy tapas you need to be wealthy. I love food, and we go out to eat a lot, but when your bill is $35 before tax and tip, and you leave still hungry, it makes me want to go somewhere else for dinner next time. Go here if you have lots of money. The food is still good."

Everything on the sangria menu is worth a try! I recommend the champagne sangria if you&#39;re looking for something less fruity. For something sugary, I&#39;d go with either the Mango or blueberry pomegranate sangria! 

Try to go during their happy hours! If you&#39;re in a group, I&#39;d try to book a reservation, because the place isn&#39;t spacious so it&#39;ll take longer to get a table on the busier nights like the weekends.

The noise level here definitely reaches the upper limit of tolerable, but the flamenco performance is quite beautiful, but your table also shakes with the rhythm of their stomping. We had more than a handful of tapas, including croquettes, stuffed calamari, patatas bravas, paella, and of course a pitcher of red sangria. 

The stuffed calamari was by far one of the most delicious things I&#39;ve ever had; additionally, it was on the house since we got the butt ends of the calamari, which were consequently smaller than they should have been (so we were told). I really wish we had gotten one more because that could have been the only thing I had to eat that night and I would have been just peachy. The paella was also delicious and one of the few I&#39;ve had here that was similar to what we had in Spain. 

Service here was great as well. Our dishes were cleared promptly, and they quickly refilled our bread basket after I dropped our first one. My sangria glass was always full. This definitely isn&#39;t a place you go to get to know someone, but why sacrifice your relationship with your food for a relationship with another person anyway."

While their tapas are not the best I&#39;ve had, it certainly comes close. Their decor and service is awesome and I love how while the place is not that big, you&#39;re not necessarily sitting on top of everyone else either. 

Service was great! Our server was very friendly and helpful with the tapas selection. I think my friend and I tried 1/2, if not more of the menu. The only dish I didn&#39;t like was the boiled octopus and that was because it was overcooked and bland. Our server was nice enough to not bill is for it which I thought was incredibly kind!

battersby is a tiny place and you are required to make reservations for either the 5 or 7 course tasting dinner, but it is well worth it.  if you&#39;re lucky you could get a spot at the bar by just walking in.  the drinks are also on point.

The madai was fine, nothing special. The Carolina Dirty Rice with squid ink was awesome. God I love squid ink. The duck sausage was good and reminded me of Vietnamese flavors.

We made a reservation weeks in advance and when we came in they gave us the option of a table squeezed in the middle of 2 other tables (no thanks) or a table in the back which still had people at it. We decided to wait for the table in the back and for the inconvenience of the wait they comped our cocktails which I thought was generous. When we sat down they placed a white truffle on the table and told us that we could opt to have a white truffle risotto (special of the night) included in our tasting menu for an additional $18 per person. It&#39;s hard for me to turn down truffle anything so we decided to pay the additional fee to have it included in our tasting. The entire tasting was delicious and one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in a long time. However, I was disappointed by the truffle risotto that we paid extra for and I can&#39;t say that it was even one of the top dishes that we tasted that evening.

Wanted to celebrate my bday somewhere with a tasting menu and decided for a more casual low key ambiance but with the same or even better without going into the city. 

We chose seat next to the window and it was perfect to enjoy our meal. We were offered tap, still, or sparkling. We got Saratoga springs sparkling and our chilled glasses were never empty. Hubby got a glass of wine and I had a personally maid mocktail (lime and ginger) which was a perfect balance as in not too sour or sweet but perfect!

To start we got a shot of cauliflower soup which had a touch of curry flavor which made it truly unique and tasty!  Next came the roasted (&amp; dried) root vegs served over whipped _____ which we almost licked out of the bowl.  Whipped ricotta and bread was amazing!!!  

1. Fluke with clams, apple, jalapeño and lime - refreshing and tasty way to start!
2. Octopus with farro, cauliflower, cucumbers, and hazelnut - complex and delish!  Loved the fish sauce (ode to my Asian-ness).
3. Fettuccine with crab, lemon and breadcrumbs - favorite dish, all the flavors and textures complement each other so well and pasta is awesomely al dente!!!
4. Pollock with bok choy, turnip, carrot curry - sauce delish, fish a little under seasoned for my taste. 
5. King salmon with beluga lentils in chicken and wine jus (minus the bacon from regular menu) 
6. Duck - perfectly seared with delicious sauce
Palate cleanser - lemon 
7. Chocolate cremeaux with cream and crispy quinoa - perfect, not too sweet/bitter/chocolatey and quinoa made all the texture.

Came here on a Wednesday night and was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait (the seating is very limited), but it was on the early side (5:45 PM). Ordered a Thanksgiving cocktail, forgot what was exactly in it but it was great. Plenty of whiskey too.

We stared off with the crispy kale salad, tuna tartare, and the foie gras tortellini dashi. Admittedly, I expected better. The crispy kale salad wasn&#39;t the best, although I may have been spoiled from the wonderful one at Chuko. The tuna tartare was pretty decent. The dashi and foie gras tortellini wasn&#39;t the best combo.

The next few dishes were much better. We had the peekytoe crab fettucine, duck bolognese pappardelle, and the &#39;heritage pork&#39;. The fettucine was delicious, with juicy chunks of crab. The pappardelle&#39;s sauce and duck were great. The pork was cooked PERFECTLY, and had a great lean to fat ratio. The farro, cauliflower, and raisins in the sauce accompanying the pork made it my favorite dish."

Get past the whole mystique of the kale salad, and you&#39;ll find a wonderfully inventive (and ever-evolving) menu that they create in one of the tiniest kitchens I&#39;ve ever seen.

They have bar seating, table seating and a backyard patio. But of course, it&#39;s so popular that it&#39;s still hard to get a table sometimes. Luckily, we swung by right before a long weekend and there wasn&#39;t a wait (literally the first time I&#39;ve ever seen it so empty).

Sat at the bar, ordered a few cocktails (I recommend the Green Monster), and then had the (enviable) task of figuring out which of their dishes to get. Thankfully, we were provided with a delicious, fresh-baked focaccia with smooth, soft-churned butter while we made our choices.

Started out with the veal sweetbreads, served with artichokes and fingerling potatoes. The sauce was creamy without being too rich, and didn&#39;t distract from the wonderful char of the sweetbreads, and there were also olives to add some salty contrast. Followed it up with the seared scallop. I always love scallops, but was hesitant because I hate grapefruit and theirs was served with some. Thankfully, the grapefruit was on the sweeter side, cooked a tiny bit, and added a nice tartness to the perfectly seared scallop. Would definitely order that again.

For our main, we shared the bomba rice, which was basically like a paella. It was made with duck confit, chorizo, and octopus. So many flavors all in one dish, but they didn&#39;t compete with each other and were actually very complementary. The duck and chorizo added some saltiness, while the octopus provided a nice texture. With the addition of the starters, it was definitely enough for a full meal split between two not-starving people.

If you&#39;re able to snag a table at Battersby, I recommend you do so immediately! I could use all sorts of cliches to describe how great the restaurant is, but you should just go see for yourself."

The 3-course menu is absolutely fantastic and excellently prepared: nothing was overly seasoned, everything was tender and juicy, and there are so many options you can sate all of your cravings.

Before we ordered, we were given chilled asparagus soup (y u m) and an amazing rosemary flatbread with slightly salted ricotta. I was like ready to just eat that the whole night - the ricotta was perfectly moist and the flatbread was so warm and savory. 

For the first course, we had the little gem salad. Nice crisp vegetables and a fantastic dressing made this a great jumping off point. For the second course, my friend got the fettuccine with crab and I had the pappardelle. Let me tell you, I&#39;ve had some great pappardelle over the years and this might have been one of the best. The duck was soft and melted in my mouth, it had just the right amount of sauce and cheese, and the portion was just right. Absolutely fantastic. The Crystal Valley chicken finished off our night and wow, that was some excellent chicken and vegetables. I rarely enjoy that many different flavors in one plate (asparagus can be smoky, mushrooms can be pretty intense for the palate, and spinach is usually quite pungent) but the sauce all of those vegetables sat in were perfect for that succulent chicken. 

Only downside to this place was the service was a bit slow but the kitchen&#39;s pretty tiny and we were definitely preoccupied with lots of food during the meal so all&#39;s good. Also: hoping in the future Battersby will allow reservations for non-tasting menu folks! The place is tiny and gets packed quick.

All in all, if you want a classy meal without the Manhattan brouhaha, this is it!"

It was just as spectacular as I&#39;d imagined.

We arrived for 8pm reservations for the 7-course tasting menu and were seated immediately at the bar. At first I wasn&#39;t sure how I liked being put at the bar, given all the adorable little tables and my weeks-in-advance reservation, but it soon made sense. With all of the frequent dishes entailed under the tasting menu, being close to the waitstaff made things more convenient for all. 

The servers were quite doting and knowledgeable. The bartender in particular was awesome to watch. He pumped out some of the most artfully crafted cocktails I&#39;ve ever seen. (I can&#39;t speak to their taste, though, because we decided to go with a bottle of red. Wine is always a good idea).

The decor only added to the impressive ambiance. I&#39;m a sucker for exposed brick walls and decorative ceilings. Cue the candlelight and you&#39;ve got one hell of a romantic date spot. 

Now, onto the food!

Every single thing we put in our mouths was insane. Seriously.

The winner was the slow-cooked salmon. This wasn&#39;t your average salmon. This wasn&#39;t even your above-average salmon. I didn&#39;t know salmon could taste like this. The texture was incredibly light, the flavor was smoky yet delicate, and the savory lentils underneath blew the whole dish out of the water.

The homemade pasta with lobster was also show-stopping. 

I can&#39;t wait to come back. If you appreciate meticulously crafted, inventive, and delicious food, come to Battersby. You won&#39;t be disappointed.

For our main course we all either ordered the pappardelle, fettuccini, or the special (Which is the one that I cannot remember). The pasta was beautifully made and cooked perfectly.

I can only offer a weak defense that the yelp reviews referenced no reservations and long waits.

Speaking of which, we tried our luck around a holiday weekend, and sure enough, they had open seats. This is almost never the case. It&#39;s a small restaurant, so I can see why it gets crowded. 

We were served the complimentary bread, which is awesome and would rightfully be a paid item on menus at other places. Warm, puffy focaccia with a dish of airy, whipped ricotta. It was a struggle not to overeat on that one.

For dishes, we chose the veal sweetbreads, seared scallop with grapefruit, and the bomba rice. The sweetbreads were tender and crisp, and the sauce with the artichokes and fingerling potatoes melded perfectly together. The scallop was cooked nicely and the grapefruit added a sweet citrusy contrast that made the dish very refreshing. The bomba rice was so delicious. With chorizo, duck confit, and octopus, there were so many things I love in this dish. Everything came together really well, flavor and texture-wise. I thought it might end up being salty but it wasn&#39;t at all. The aioli added a nice creaminess to the dish.

I&#39;m so impressed that they can turn around dishes of such high caliber in that tiny, tiny kitchen. It was rather fun to watch the chefs navigate that little space, but you see they have a system down perfectly. I cannot recommend this place enough!"

We were given a teensy cup of squash soup with a creamy swish as a starter. Really nice. Homey but delicious. Rich but small. It was a lovely welcome. 

The housemade rosemary flatbread was light and crisp. It was served with whipped ricotta. Both were damn good. I could have had just that with a bottle of wine and called it a night. 

But we had more. The chicory caesar salad had these thin slices of seasonal radish that were a beautiful watermelon color. The chicory itself was a beautiful speckled pattern like cranberry beans. Then I had the squash agnolotti with crisped sage. Delicious! But it was hard to get my fork into the agnolotti without the squash filling squirting out one end. I guess it&#39;s meant to scooped not poked. I managed.

Overall a great meal and I&#39;m excited to go back."

The chef demonstrated his talent by taking simple ingredients and transforming them into delicacies. As a chef myself it is inspirational to see such talent and technique in Brooklyn. If your going to splurge this is a great place to do it! Highly recommend the tasting menu!

It&#39;s incredible how this place operates in what was just one half of the sorely missed Patois (the originator of the Smith street restaurant scene).  

Despite the tight quarters this restaurant knows how to treat your right.  Down to the hostess the service is incredibly professional yet down to earth and with no attitude (rare for a restaurant as popular and successful as this).

Thankfully Battersby now takes reservations, but in the first few months the wait could be epic.  Our first time years ago, we were quoted a 1.5 hour wait which ultimately became a 4.5 hour wait when other diners wouldn&#39;t move along (they won&#39;t rush you or pressure you to leave here).  For some reason we didn&#39;t mind in the end as the hostess kept us posted via our cellphone every 30mns as we barhopped up and down Smith and once we were seated the meal was truly unforgettable.

It&#39;s hard to add anything to what literally hundreds of other Yelpers have already said about the food.  It is just phenomenal all around.

Unfortunately the same can&#39;t be said about their sister restaurant Dover, which despite having the room that we wished Battersby had (oh how excited we were when it opened), it has none of the charm, sub-par service, and mediocre food. Definitely skip Dover and stick with the original...Battersby is incredible and is one of those rare restaurant that deserves every bit of praise it gets!"

Perry L got us a early dinner reservation for our one year anniversary. Seven dishes! (Perry knows I love tasting menus. I&#39;m spoiled. Don&#39;t tell him!) While the storefront is rather nondescript, the dining room teeny tiny, the kitchen even tinier - the backyard patio is an urban oasis of calm and romantic in a upscale casual Brooklyn way. (Do keep in mind the risk of mosquitoes.) If you enjoy cocktails and wine, the menu is large and varied. The table next to us had several rounds of drinks, so I assume they are top notch. 

From the beginning, service was impeccable. Kind, eloquent, well timed, and frequent. Part of this has to do with the fact that we reserved the seven course tasting menu, which guarantees a certain level of care and constant table refreshing. I didn&#39;t care. They were lovely.

On this mid-August day, the menu consisted of:
-Tomato watermelon gazpacho amuse
-Tuna tartar with shaved foie gras spoons
-Rosemary flatbread with whipped ricotta
Hamachi (yellowtail tuna) with cucumber yuzu dressing
Homemade mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes, basil, and pickled peaches
Potato gnocchi over corn puree
Sweetbreads and polenta
Big eye tuna over tomatillo gazpacho
Lamb over roast eggplant with salsa verde and dandelion 
-Grapefruit sorbet
Banana pudding/pineapple cheesecake
-Coffee cake - to go

Items with the &#34;-&#34; were complimentary, but were still made with a high level of care. The amuse was a mouthful of tart and creamy, rich but fresh. The tuna tartare could be a stand alone appetizer - very fresh, large diced tuna, well seasoned, and liberally coated in shaved foie gras, adding a second layer of umami. I loved the flatbread and whipped ricotta - clean, earthy, comforting food with quality details.

I loved the hamachi, potato gnocchi, and lamb the most. They were clever flavor combinations, prepared with the best quality, and made my tummy very happy. The hamachi was particularly beautiful, with edible flowers, a bright green sauce, and festive flecks of red sea salt. The gnocchi melted in your mouth, super soft yet flavorful. The lamb was cleverly plated and served perfectly medium well. It paired well with the tame eggplant, which added a hint of sweet. 

Dessert was well plated, but didn&#39;t swing home for me. We shared the two dishes and neither one of them packed the banana or pineapple punch I was waiting for. While the deconstructed presentation was clever and I appreciated the use of iced creams, the desserts appeared more of an afterthought, failing to signal to me that the lovely dinner was really over. I was satisfied, so no need to stop by 16 Handles or anything, but I hoped for a little more.

Overall, Battersby is a lovely place, creating a memorable and delicious experience. Service and ambiance are lovely, but due to the high price point (and small servings for non-tasting menu diners), you may want to reserve this one for special occasions."

Everything we ate was scrumptious and the presentation was absolutely amazing. They not only do a very good job with plating, but balance the colors and flavors to perfection. I also really like the ambiance of this place, with its exposed walls and dim lighting - it really is a great place to take a date for a tête-à-tête. I personally preferred to sit at the bar here, because 1) we weren&#39;t doing a tasting menu and 2) I much preferred the seating arrangement and how it gives you an entire view of the restaurant.

To start, I ordered the ginger beer by Fever tree. By far one of the best ginger beers I have ever had. My boyfriend was off alcohol at the time due to health reasons, so ordered an egg white mocktail with bitters - which the bartender was more to make with the flavor profiles that he wanted. To start, they also brought complimentary focaccia bread with butter; unfortunately it was not GF so I didn&#39;t get a chance to try but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it. To start, I ordered the blue prawn with crispy kale, green papaya and peanuts. I got the blue prawns on the side so my bf could eat those. The salad was perfectly balanced, crunchy, and perfectly seasoned. I also ordered the caponata, which was oh so delicious - it was little delectable bites of eggplant (which by the way were cooked oh-so-well), squash (let it be known I am not squash lover, but I was this squash lover), nuts, greens, radishes. The flavors were so perfectly balanced - both in terms of texture and taste. My boyfriend ordered the duck, which he really enjoyed as well.  

We weren&#39;t super hungry, so didn&#39;t really order a dessert but next time I definitely want to do the tasting menu!"

Of the 5 main courses, 1 was nothing special and I think the spinach to 3 or 4 was too salty but overall, very yummy, great presentation and our waitress was great. We comfortably finished on a Thursday night in under 2 hours.

*From their cocktail menu, I tried the &#39;Cenote&#39; $12 (Wheat Grass &amp; Cucumber Infused Tequila, Egg White, Lemon) which was OK. I was a big fan of the &#39;Cropduster&#39; $13 (Bourbon, Scotch, Smoked Corn, Honey) on the rocks. My perfect cocktail.

Loved sitting in the garden on a perfect September evening. A little dark outside but romantic :)

Adventures are not a guarantee of a certain outcome, just the opportunity to experience.

There was a flurry of exceptional dishes, starting with ricotta whipped and soaked in olive oil, that amounted to an overall experience that can only be described as subtly exceptional.   There was the fairytale eggplant which was delicately tiny and magical in taste.  There were the red snapper, the hen egg, lamb - each protein dominating in their own category.   

You might not recall the specifics, but the jolt of a pervasive memory here or there.  The hen egg runs over and soaks tiny cubes of bacon and mushroom -- perfection.  Rich burrata bites accompanied by toasted quinoa.  The smattering of late-summer fruits across a simple slice of angel food cake.

Battersby possesses the obligatory exposed brick wall, charmingly scruffed yet polished wooden tables, and an intimate comfort.  Strangers relax and smile across the table from each other, like old friends."

I say that hands down, with all seriousness and no wavering. It starts with the extensive wine list, and continues with the delectable butternut squash soup amuse bouche that should totally be its own First (hint, hint). It continues amazingly into fresh baked rosemary focaccia bread with whipped savory ricotta (this is their breadbasket folks! Can you believe it?!!). By this time we&#39;re almost giddy, but then comes the INSANE seared foie gras that&#39;s a slightly sweet, savory, buttery decadence. The Chicorie salad is an unexpected original that reminds me of the best caesar salad I&#39;ve ever had, and the display is almost too beautiful to eat. By this time we were almost full, but thankfully had plenty of room for the duck parpadelle with its creamy, cheesy deliciousness and the fresh, lemony, bread crummy insanity that was the crab linguine. We were complete gluttons and also got the stout chocolate cake, which was EVERYTHING a molten chocolate cake should be. 

I am already planning my next trip back. How I missed this gem for so long, I will never know!!"

This place is awesome!  The other raving reviews are spot on; the bread that comes to the table is steaming hot and to-die-for, there were two amuse bouches (?) from the chef, and five great dishes.  There was one raw fish dish, a veggie dish, one cooked fish dish, a lamb dish, and dessert.  The only thing that I didn&#39;t totally love was the veggie dish.  It was carrots, two ways, and there was nothing wrong with it, it was tasty, but I just didn&#39;t need a big bowl of it.  I would have much preferred to be able to try either of the pasta dishes in a tasting portion, which I will definitely go back for now!  The cooked fish dish was pollack in a Thai-style broth that was probably the best Thai I have ever had.  It had all the flavor but was light and fresh, yet still managed to be a bit creamy.

The service was fantastic.  Our server was very helpful and pleasant.  She recommended a bottle of wine that was perfect.  I think it was the grenache that they also serve by the glass.  Get it.

For $75 pp, I feel like it was worth it.  Definitely a good place for those couples that do &#34;date nights&#34; or for the ones who don&#39;t and just go out when they feel like it ;) haha"

I&#39;ve lived around the corner for over a year yet have never dined here because I was never willing to wait 2 hours. Finally we decided to suck it up, so we put our name down on the list and planned to wait at home until we got a call that our table was ready. The hostess quoted us 45 minutes to an hour, which was totally fine with us. An hour and fifteen pass and still no call. We finally walk over to the restaurant and end up waiting there another 20 minutes. If they really meant the wait would be over an hour and a half, they really should have just said that. It&#39;s all about expectations.

We finally sit down and were started with an amuse bouche - a creamy shrimp bisque. It sounded better than it was -  I found it a bit too creamy that it didn&#39;t have much flavor. They brought us fresh baked bread with some homemade olive oil ricotta, which I loved. I ordered a polenta shrimp soup for a starter, and my boyfriend ordered the veal sweetbreads. The soup itself wasn&#39;t that exciting but I liked the chorizo and whole shrimp garnishing it. The sweetbreads were pretty tasty too (spoiler alert: sweetbreads are not bread at all, it&#39;s the thymus gland in a lamb&#39;s neck. Yummy!)

For the mains, I ordered the short rib pastrami and my boyfriend ordered the black bass. My short rib pastrami was good, but honestly it was like glorified corned beef, and for $31. The black bass was a nice delicate dish, but I wasn&#39;t totally blown away either (and that was $30 too).

Not joking, we were done with our mains for 20 minutes before someone came to take it away. We had our forks and knives piled onto the plates to signal we were done, and we literally hadn&#39;t touched the near empty plates for 20 minutes and still the waitstaff didn&#39;t get it. No wonder the wait for a table is so long - they don&#39;t clear tables in a timely manner!

Maybe also why I was pretty disappointed with this place is because it&#39;s a sister restaurant to one of my favorite restaurants Dover, which I think is 10x better (just a few blocks away from Battersby too!). I might come back to see if maybe I just came on an off day and it really could be better, but I&#39;m not in a rush to do it anytime soon."

Like the many reviews below I have heard great things and some of my friends have told me that it is one of the best restaurant they had been. So maybe I was just there that one night everything went wrong. But I would have to say, don&#39;t waste your special night in this restaurant. I decided to have a holiday get together with special friends and made a reservation couple months ahead. The food was Good. But I have to say the service and overall experience was just really disappointing. We ended up spending over 700 dollars with tip and I have to say four of us would have had much better time in most restaurants in NYC area than Battersby.

First, the drinks we ordered came out 48 minutes after first we sat down. I think a friend of owner&#39;s or something were sitting down right next to us in the bar area so they got amazing service but we were really overlooked. When the server brought out the food for the bar customer she really got in our space and hit my friends with her behind and did not even apologize. I know the restaurant is tiny but the whole thing was unprofessional and would not even expect in to go Chinese restaurant. While their second course (they sat after us) we could not even get our first drink. When they brought our drink order, it was a wrong drink. 48 minutes for 3 cocktails and one glass of wine - THAT is just not acceptable.

Second, they totally disappointed us with setting up the wrong expectations. As we sat down they asked us about dietary restrictions. I explained that I am lactose intolerant and the server asked if any other restrictions. We said no. And he said you guys should be excited about veal sweetbread special. The table next to us said it was great too. But when our seven course tasting menu was over, there was no sweetbread served. I am not sure if they ran out or something but we felt for tasting menu service the servers were really unprofessional and awful to be honest. 

Overall, I have to say it was super disappointing."

- you bite into chicken liver and go &#34;oh my god&#34;
- you started thinking about 5 stars by the 2nd course
- you hate pasta but you could eat the pasta dish 3 times a day every day
- you get a &#34;pre-dessert&#34;
- you get home and you refuse to brush your teeth because it&#39;ll make the flavors go away.
- you finally give in to brushing your teeth and notice a bit of food stuck between your teeth... you savor that last delicious mouthful.

Okay maybe that went too far, but this was seriously one of the better fine dining meals I&#39;ve had.  We did the 5 course tasting menu, and it was perfect, from beginning to end.

It started with a polenta soup amuse bouche, followed by a chicken liver pate amuse.  Both were excellent, especially the pate.  When has pate ever been a dish worth mentioning in my life until now.  They brought some great rosemary bread with ricotta cheese to the table as well.  The first course was a squash salad that was light and tangy.  The second was a poached cod that was so soft in texture, I had no idea how they could have possibly prepared it this way.  The third was pasta with mushrooms and broccoli, and like I said above, even though I dislike pasta, I could have eaten this all day.  Then came the lamb with braised chickpeas.  The lamb was perfectly seared on the outside and had great color.  Finally there was a &#34;pre dessert&#34; celery ice cream, followed by actual dessert of some sort of pecan pie... that description hardly does it justice though.

What&#39;s even more amazing is that they are able to do all of this in such a tiny space, with an even tinier kitchen!  The staff are like sweet southern belles!  The drinks are delicious!  The lighting is perfect!  The atmosphere is cozy!  The attention is great!!

Not realizing this stretch of Smith St. Is heavily populated by the urban subculture commonly referred to as &#34;hipsters&#34; 
   The waiter offered us 2 options, the 5 course meal for 75$ or the 7 course for $95. Absolutely famished, we went with the 7 course. 
    In my world (aka big Italian family from Long Island) a course ... Is a meal within itself. In hipster world. a course contains of a single miniature oyster. The proceeding courses were subsequently the same. If you have ever been to Costco and roamed around eating all the free samples, consider that the portion size at Battersby. 

In sum... If you are hungry , don&#39;t go to Battersby.

  If you are not a hipster, don&#39;t go to Battersby.

If you want to spend over 200$ for crumbs, go to Battersby.

I&#39;m not saying the restaurant is ugly, not at all. However, considering the steep price for their tasting menu, THE DECOR IS QUITE BARE. 

As we got in, we were immediately seated. Not much of a choice... the two 2-seat tables inside are uncomfortably squeezed between the walkway and the wall. We were never given the option to sit in the comfortable back patio (and we made the reservation weeks ago). Not a good start.

Our TASTING MENU (unfortunately mandatory for those who wish to make a reservation) was the following:

Tomato gazpacho on the house (the size of a shot): delicious; great balance between creamy and refreshing. 

One small spoon of big eye tuna tartare with shaved foie gras (on the house): phenomenal; I can&#39;t describe how great this was. One of the most heavenly delicate bites I&#39;ve ever had.

1 Rosemary ciabatta bread (to share between us) with whipped ricotta cheese (on the house). Considering how much you pay, they could have brought one ciabatta PER PERSON, instead of making us split it. Wow.

Habachi with avocado and cucumber sauce: mouthwatering; the raw habachi was melting in my mouth, and was beautifully complemented by the citric flavor of the sauce. 

3 House made gnocchi with mushrooms, corn and shaved truffle: super fluffy, and kinda airy...like a dumpling; light and flavorful at the same time. Yes, there were JUST 3 small gnocchi on the dish.

Big eye tuna (again) over polenta: good; however, it was super tiny, even for a tasting entree... the size of half stick of butter. Also, I found it quite redundant to bring big eye tuna, since they brought some at the beginning of the meal. Meh.

Lamb: not up to the level to everything else; the tiny piece of meat (the size of 2 erasers on top of each other) had some tough cartilage and was pretty bland, as compared with the rest of the dish. 

1 tiny dessert with a stripe of frozen chocolate (and some sort of pastry sheet so thin and fragile it crumbled as soon as I touched it), plus another with iced cucumber. Meh... creative and innovative, I will give you that;  but a real disappintment; you can&#39;t go that fancy, and completely LACK SUBSTANCE. I have a sweet tooth, but didn&#39;t feel like even finishing them (despite still being hungry), so you can judge from this how they were.

Overall, I can&#39;t give them more than 3 stars. Until the lamb, everything was outstanding. Nevertheless, PORTIONS WERE BEYOND TINY, and we both got up hungry. I know, it&#39;s a tasting menu, and everything is supposed to be small. But for $75 per person, you can&#39;t let your customers get up HUNGRY. And we did.

In addition, THE SERVICE WAS PAINFULLY SLOW, as the meal lasted 2 1/2 hrs. We got in before 8:30p and left just before 11p. Unreal. We were served literally 1-2 spoonfuls of food every 25 minutes. Beyond annoying. 

And finally, I was asked at the beginning what I didn&#39;t like - which is cumin - so that the chef would be careful not to put any of it on the dishes. We didn&#39;t volunteer any information; it was the waiter who asked, and we told him. One of the desserts had plenty of cumin in a yogurt sauce... so why are you asking me if you clearly don&#39;t care? It was not good for a place that charges you that much. He apologized (with a smile on his face), but never did anything about it. That dessert was wasted for me, and considering the tab, it&#39;s a shame. 

These restaurant has some unforgettable dishes, no doubt about it, but for $75 per person, I would expect 1) not to get up hungry, 2) more careful service, and 3) more consistent quality throughout the meal. 

Needless to say, despite the 3 stars, I will never go back or refer this place to anybody else."

It is a small place but it&#39;s got big flavors (how cheesy is that statement).  The free bread they bring you is no joke, because I had to ask for a second even though my body was nowhere near bikini ready.  The sweet pea salad (super refreshing) and sweetbread (the presentation is beautifully done) appetizers blew my mind.  For entrees, my husband loved his lamb, but I didn&#39;t really like my cod (it was crispy outside, but a little too underdone on the inside).  Really a 4.5 star place!!!"

They were so embarrassed to have suggested it. The food is exactly the kind of outdated pretty but tasteless stuff that makes the nyc scene so hard to navigate. 

After asking other friends, they say this place used to be good, I think this is another scenario of  a restaurant letting go once they have a decent reputation.

The tasting menu they require felt like amateur hour. Poorly thought through menu with no sense of progression and the dishes varied from over salted prawn to under seasoned veggies to overcooked duck. The service was scattered, and because it was an open kitchen, you could hear the server being bullied by the chefs. 

All in all, a complete fail on their part."

First, as other people have mentioned, they do not let you make reservations unless you order one of their extremely expensive tasting menus. So, if you don&#39;t want to pay A LOT of money for one of these, you&#39;ll be waiting for quite a long time and getting attitude from a pretentious host. This sort of reminds me of Samurai Mama&#39;s ridiculous policies. I can&#39;t stand places like this. 

Maybe their arrogance would be better justified if the place didn&#39;t look like a dingy piece of crap and if the food was actually decent. My boyfriend had the duck and I had the cod. The duck was so tough and he was pretty pissed he paid so much for it. This is unusual because he is far from a picky eater. My cod was extremely bland and disappointing. I still can&#39;t believe the prices for food that is this mediocre. 

As I briefly mentioned, the place is dingy. It&#39;s small and kind of looks like it doesn&#39;t get cleaned very often. It amazes me that they try to pass this off as upscale. Please, save yourself the time and money and go to one of the other nice restaurants in the neighborhood."

It&#39;s been about a year and a half since I last visited Battersby, and was thrilled to find out that they now take reservations! Gone are the two hour (totally worthwhile) waits, and instead, you can walk right in and sit down at your table.

The tasting menu was...outrageous. After the amuse bouche (tomato soup), they gave us a couple of small bites. Mine was tuna tartare with shaved fois gras, and it was pretty mind-blowing.

Other highlights: hamachi with ponzu and mint, blue prawn papaya salad, and a pretty incredible berkshire pork dish with snap peas.

Don&#39;t get me started on dessert.

I usually spend most of my time at the nondescript, dumpy ethnic places, but every once in a while I&#39;ll hit up a place like Battersby.

Somehow, I got a last minute reservation on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm.
All the savory food we tried was incredible, beautifully presented and thoughtfully paired.
We had:
amuse bouche (2)
-shot of watermelon gazpacho soup - so refreshing and tasty!
-spoonful of tuna tartare with shaved foi gras - heaven!

Rosemary bread with ricotta - best bread i&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant, the ricotta was creamy and delicious

Course #1 - Prawn with crispy kale and papaya salad - incredible
Course #2 - Lobster Rigatoni Fra Diavola - spicy and delicious
Course #3 - seared tuna with pesto - so good!
Course #4 - Duck breast with peaches and chanterelle mushrooms - yeah...um repeat please!

pre-dessert course - yes, they actually have this!
-Papaya ice cream with sea salt - really tasty but too salty 

Birthday pineapple upside down cake - I had completely forgotten that I&#39;d mentioned it was my friend;s birthday when I made a reservation. I was really impressed that they remembered a few days later when we came in and brought out cake with candle.
Unfortunately, this dessert was way too sweet and just not doing it for me.

2nd dessert - banana cake with milk curdle - honestly, this sort of grossed me out. The banana cake was just too heavy and the curdled milk on top just freaked me out - it reminded me of skimming the top of milk from when I was little.

I&#39;m still giving this place 5 stars because of the value to taste ratio for the savory dishes. The service was incredible and thoughtful and i love free things! They even gave us 2 beautifully wrapper muffins to take home  - that&#39;s some Per Se service right there!

The ambience is a bit too casual for the quality of food and you end up sitting really close to your neighbors, but whatever, it&#39;s got a Brooklyn feel.

Dessert could use some work but everything else was flawless! Go here now!"

ATMOSPHERE:
Showed up on a Thursday night around 8pm and the small narrow space was, as expected, full. The place is a bit crammed, but still charming.

Lucky us, we were able to snag a table in about 10 minutes. Most of the seating is at the counter by the bar.

SERVICE:
Our hostess and waitress were very attentive. Our waitress was prompt in giving us the menu, serving our food, getting the check. And she made herself more than available and encouraged us to ask questions about the menu. 

FOOD:
Goodness gracious, everything was so delicious.

BREAD
After our meal, I may have dreamt about the flatbread that was served with cottage cheese. I&#39;m still reminiscing about it now. The bread was so fresh, perfectly baked with the right balance of crispy and fluffy. The cottage cheese in olive oil was the perfect pairing for it.  To be honest, they had me at the bread.

SOUP
They also gave us a small cup of chilled carrot soup to start the meal off, what a nice gesture. The ginger was very unexpectedly overpowering in my first sip, but then it grew on me.

APPETIZERS

Kale salad - Days after my meal, I am still daydreaming about their kale salad. The kale was perfectly crisp, topped with peanuts, resting on a bed of brussel sprouts and string beans, with some magical delicious dressing. 

When my date heard that I was ordering a kale salad, he instantly dismissed it and said &#34;you&#39;re on your own with that&#34; Why are men programmed to hate vegetables?? Anyway, he took a bite and immediately acknowledged just how delicious it was. I win!

Grilled shrimp in polenta - wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the polenta, but I never am. That shrimp though! It was the most tender shrimp we had ever tasted!! We were in a bit of disbelief.

ENTREES
Pastrami - thanks to the recommendation of our waitress, we tried this amazon dish. The pastrami was so incredibly tender, think... Katz&#39;s pastrami in the shape of a cube. It was mouthwatering.

Overall, this is one of the best meals I have ever had. Since thereby changes seasonally, I will most definitely be back. So impressed!"

Plus, this review shares some extra tidbits I learned from Matt.

I arrived at 9:45PM on a Wednesday night, and was surprised that all the tables were full, and there were only 3 seats at the bar.  Compared to the rest of Brooklyn, this place was hopping!  Trust me, I walked past many empty restaurants to get here.

I tasted an assortment of novel dishes, which included:
-Pita bread with a delicious salted butter.  It tasted like it came out of a brick oven, though I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s actually true.
-Cold carrot soup with a tint of nutmeg, served in a shot glass.
-A much classier version of granola and yogurt - it constantly kept me surprised.  My first bite was sweet.  My second bite was tart.  My third bite was a bit spicy.  I don&#39;t know how this was possible, but it&#39;s true!
-Jersey asparagus - Matt convinced me to order this instead of the gnocchi and he was right (and yes, the asparagus really is from Jersey).  Everything was amazing, including the creamy green sauce, but man, those mushrooms!  I wish I could&#39;ve eaten an entire pound of them.  Matt claims he just cooked them in chicken broth, but I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a lot of steps he omitted.
-Blueberry/carrot something ice cream pie.  Matt gave this really complicated explanation of what was in the pie, and I couldn&#39;t identify the ingredients, but it was both sweet and tart at the same time.  I can thank the pastry chef for this delicious treat!

The mixed drinks are delicious too. I told the bartender I was warm after zooming over from Penn Station (too warm to be drinking alcohol), and he made me the perfect drink.  It was cool, refreshing, and not too sweet and made with exotic fruits I&#39;d never heard of, including yuzu (a Japanese fruit that is similar to a grapefruit) and golchin (a juice made from unripened grapes).  You must try it (and I&#39;m sure you could get it with alcohol if you wanted).

Ultimately, it seems like the team works really well (Matt has worked with 2 other employees at past jobs), and it shows in the quality of the food and the service.  I hope I get another chance to make the trek from DC to NY to eat here!"

I don&#39;t know if something has changed in the kitchen or it&#39;s just the benign neglect of the original co-owners/chefs (who now spend their time in the kitchen of Dover instead), but you just aren&#39;t what you used to be, and haven&#39;t been for many months now. I used to work in the neighborhood, and have been visiting Battersby occasionally since a few months after it opened. Battersby received a lot of hype in 2012--and rightfully so--which led to the inevitable expansion from a cramped, 25+ seat hole-in-the-wall with a kitchen smaller than the one in your apartment to the roomier Dover, where you will not be forced to sit on your neighbor&#39;s folded-up parka as you might on occasion at Battersby. Unfortunately this success is no longer represented in the food. 

Battersby is still ambitious; it&#39;s probably the only restaurant in the neighborhood that relies on a (spontaneous) tasting menu more so than a la carte items (other than Take Root, but those ladies are playing an entirely different game). But such ambition is failed by a wine menu that can most generously be described as lacking. And service is still a little hit or miss, which is not what you want to deal with for five or more courses. We have been met by both a warm, attentive server (who was on the newer side), an agreeable bartender with questionable choice in accessories, and a disinterested, borderline dismissive host.

I don&#39;t mind the tasting-only reservation policy, as I would imagine it has to do more with table turnover than anything else (a seven-course tasting menu is going to take roughly two-three hours to get through, versus a la carte dining, which can be done in much less time). Now that the hype has died down, the wait for dinner most nights isn&#39;t nearly what is used to be anyway.

But the kitchen seems to be riding the coattails of praise earned by others. Entrees still hit you with a sort of winter heaviness, but lack any dash of acidity to cut through richness. There can also, at times, be a lack of textural complexity that turns solid flavors into baby food in my mouth. I really do want greatness for Battersby, but more often than not I am faced with a prawn salad swimming in too much dressing, underseasoned gnocchi or burrata that seems derivative. While occasionally presented with a perfectly cooked hamachi or wonderfully cooked sweetbreads, the misses outnumber the hits these days. (And the dessert is typically an afterthought. The take-home treats they give you to end each meal will make you happier than some bland chocolate cold thing, so let the rosemary focaccia take up that space in your stomach instead.)

I don&#39;t want to give Battersby 2.5 stars, but you were once one of the Ten Best New Restaurants in the country, and now you&#39;re just another Smith Street joint."

Had Geoffrey pair some really interesting wines with the meal. Nearly everything was delicious. I say nearly only because I&#39;m not a fan of ginger. But that&#39;s a me thing.

Getting a reservation at a reasonable time was tough, so I accepted seats at the bar. Honestly, I think that was such a fortunate problem. Got to talk to the bartender and servers a lot more about the courses and peruse the wine list with informed help. It helped to sit next to each other, as well. Made the whole thing a lot more of a social experience.

Would definitely, definitely go again.

The second you walk into Battersby, you&#39;re struck with how adorable the tiny restaurant is. The simple wooden floors, the lights, the fact that you can see the kitchen and the chefs who will be cooking your food gives it an incredibly homey, intimate feeling, which is then reflected in the dishes.

My boyfriend and I made early reservations for the Battersby Seven Course Tasting Menu. We arrived, the first people there, and had the pleasure of sitting in the lovely, small back patio. It was shady and it was breezy, absolutely perfect. 

From the opening cocktails and the lovely Cucumber Soup amuse-bouche to our favorite dish the Grilled Zucchini in a Curry Infused Ricotta to the savory and sweet Pork and Corn Fricassee to the fun play on a Salty Dog to begin the dessert, it was an absolute treat to dine here. I was slightly overwhelmed with how large the portions were, considering it was a 7-course Tasting, but the more food the better!

I rarely make a trip out to Brooklyn from Manhattan (although I would love to visit more often), and therefore used to think of the borough as below Manhattan when it comes to culinary scale. Lately, however, there have been all these new restaurants that have arisen in Brooklyn with great reviews from critics, some of whom have gone as far as to make a bold statement like culinary center is shifting from Manhattan to Brooklyn. While I wouldn&#39;t go that far, I did keep a list of restaurants in Brooklyn I&#39;ve been wanting to go, and Battersby (headed by veteran chefs Joseph Ogrodnek and Walker Stern) was one of them. Tucked in an obscure Cobble Hill neighborhood, with one of the tiniest kicthens and dining rooms I&#39;ve seen, I walked away from the restaurant very satisfied with the level of New American elegance that the restaurant showed. 

The restaurant serves dishes either a la carte or spontaneous five-course tasting menu (at $75 per head), which you can ask for before ordering and which the restaurant will gladly accommodate. You can also ask to include a couple of specific dishes that you like to try in particular in the tasting menu. My meal started out with sea urchin with cucumber. I wished they could&#39;ve used different vegetable as the sour cucumber significantly overwhelmed the flavor of sea urchin. My second course, on the other hand, was absolutely fabulous. I rarely make compliements of salad dishes, but the crisp kale salad completely blew me away. The texture of the vegetables and peanuts was one of the, if not the best one I&#39;ve experienced from a salad dish. The third and fourth courses (scallop with carrot puree and duck with turnip, radish, and miso) were also very flavorful and well-executed. My meal ended with caramelized pear and salted chocolate mousse, another outstanding dish that I wish I could&#39;ve more of thanks to its complexity of texture and flavor without overwhelming me with sweet sensation. 

As I already mentioned, the restaurant is really tiny (and doesn&#39;t take reservations unless you opt for tasting menu options online, but the reservation sopts are still very hard to come by), and by the time I arrived ten minutes before the opening at 5:30 p.m. to avoid waiting, there was already a line forming and I had to sit at the bar. I didn&#39;t mind either, though, as it was nice to interact with a friendly bartender who was making some really good, creative cocktails. More so than anything, Battersby will always be a special place for me for what Brooklyn can offer: a tiny space in an obscure part of neighborhood that delivers high-technique, well-executed food that you normally find at a fancy establishment in Manhattan."

It&#39;s the one holiday you carry around with you organically.  I stopped acknowledging most other holidays years ago, but I&#39;m always down to celebrate my birth with a meal.

But alas, I did work on my birthday, and now I&#39;m rushing to the train, through an idiot&#39;s obstacle course, into and out of the subway, fast-walking the Brooklyn blocks, carrying the stress of the work day into an early reservation at Battersby.

My girl is springing for the tasting menu. So life is good. But we have zero chance of decompressing  by this unfortunate time-slot. Even after a few tasty cocktails.

Enter the sunchoke amuse-bouche, in a small shot glass, brief and delicious, with hints of hazelnut, followed by crispy kale salad with peanuts and brussels sprouts. That crispy kale was on my mind for weeks after this meal.

&#34;This fluke dish,&#34; I say, &#34;is so good, but it&#39;s gonna be hard for me to remember what was so good about it.&#34;
&#34;I think it&#39;s so clean tasting.&#34;
&#34;Yeah, but is that really a thing?&#34;

I dug the homemade pasta with sea urchin more than my girl, surprising considering she loves sea urchin and I don&#39;t even like saying it.  I think I remember an asparagus course, cooked two ways, maybe,  some beautiful beets? I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m forgetting. It was four weeks ago. A lot of water under the bridge. I should write these reviews earlier. I&#39;m so bad at this.

I do remember wishing for the pressed foie sweetbread terrine I&#39;d seen on the menu. Not that there was anything wrong with the chicken and cauliflower dish, It just didn&#39;t seem like a closer. Still, put it in front of me right now and it&#39;s gone in sixty seconds.

I gotta start writing sh-t down. I remember loving all the desserts - a nice mix of flavors and textures from the ice-cream to bite-size Madeleines (soft and amazing). A host of other little cremes, cookies and pastries, and even biscotti for the road.

I shall return, Battersby, and I&#39;ll be making my own choices. On a weekend. In a better mood. And with a pen.

Also, next year I&#39;m taking off on my birthday.

a) not that good food
b) over priced 
c) service was poor

I recall enjoying the starters most, though one of them seemed a little pricy for what it was.  I remember thinking both of the entrees were unremarkable, and one, a lobster dish, was extremely costly for a small portion size.  Dessert was also uninspiring.

We sat at the bar, and the bartender just couldn&#39;t keep up, which was weird, because it was a small bar.  He just didn&#39;t seem to know what he was doing, which was also weird because he was doing things like naming tables for VIPs, which seems like a relatively sophisticated thing to do.

Maybe a lot of the more enthusiastic reviews are for brunch, I don&#39;t know."

Food was very good, definitely enjoyed their sweetbreads and polenta (savory and polenta was creamy) and left not feeling overly full.

We walked in just to see how long it would be without making a prior reservation - which was the worst decision ever for this restaurant. After politely telling the staff that we were a party of 5, the woman responded with, &#34;a table for five?? without a reservation?&#34; and a pretentious look like, &#34;what are you thinking? Have you never heard of Battersby?&#34; Meanwhile we look to our right and there are 3 tables empty next to us. &#34;Let me go back and see what I can do&#34; she said and walked away. Thankfully (or coincidentally) within 5 minutes a reservation for a large party cancelled and those 3 empty tables were fused together for us. It just left me with the impression that there was a discussion in the back about whether to seat us and take our money or turn us away and leave those tables empty.

I had no complaints with the food but from the tone of voice that we received from the waiter throughout the night it didn&#39;t seem like we were welcome. Maybe I&#39;ll come back but not in the near future unfortunately."

After a failed attempt at &#34;floating&#34; at nearby sensory-deprivation spa Lift, we were counting on this highly-regarded restaurant to save our night out in Brooklyn.  We couldn&#39;t have been more disappointed.

Our meal began promisingly with a wonderful cocktail, the Pimms Coupe, and a quite enjoyable serving of bread.  But from there, the night descended quickly into a purgatory of delays, minuscule &#34;courses,&#34; and salt.  LOTS of salt.  Our first course was an ill-conceived venture into the combinatory world of watermelon and raita, which left us confused, at best.  The icy mixture tasted of salted yogurt, salted watermelon, and salt.  It was followed by perhaps the most insubstantial course either I or my girlfriend have experienced (in a city famed for insubstantial courses), the infamous two bli$tered pepper dish.  Ensconced in an enchanting ceramic bowl lay two limp peppers, touted by our waitress as &#39;packing heat&#39;.  Upon ingestion, however, they were found to be impotent in the extreme.  They did, however, contain salt.

This misadventure was followed up by an indifferent course of scallops (two).  While not intolerable, they were easily forgettable.  Next up was perhaps the best dish, the pasta with some sort of crumbly topping.  However, even this dish was imperfect- overcooked to a flagging flaccidity, and drenched in sodium chloride.  After another twenty-minute gap (these had preceded the other courses as well), we were treated to the &#34;main savory course,&#34; a pork loin.  &#34;Heritage,&#34; of course.  While the pork had some flavor, it was about 35% flabbyfat and at least 28% salt.  

Perhaps the longest gap of the evening followed.  I believe it was at this point that I had to chastise my girlfriend for saying &#34;this is one of the worst meals I&#39;ve ever had&#34; at slightly too great a volume.  But while I wouldn&#39;t rate this place quite as harshly, I could hardly disagree too strongly with my love&#39;s analysis of this Cobble Hill culinary coulda-been.  Why so much salt?  From what we gathered from the reviews, the chef(s) here are Culinary Institute graduates- certainly the overuse of salt must play some role in the curriculum there?

By this point, two hours had passed since the halcyon hours of the Pimms Coupe.  The promise the drink had portended had long been replaced with a dreary despondency.  The night was far from young, and we decided to forgo dessert and ask for the check.  Using the babysitter as an excuse, we spent a tortuous 13 1/2 minutes attempting to attract the waitress&#39;s attention from her two other customers.  She was nice enough to bring us an intermezzo of beer-inspired ice cream with lemon, which wasn&#39;t too bad- until we hit the salty spice on the rim of the glass.  Ouch.  She then brought us a parting gift to go.  Wait for it... SALTED caramel.  Was this an ironic reference to the earlier portion of the evening?  We can&#39;t comment on the quality of this dish, as we had already exceeded our yearly quota of sodium and so chose to bypass this gift.

In all, $240 later, we nabbed a green cab and spent our ride commenting on the shocking disparity between our experience and that of other Yelpers.  Was it an off night?  A substitute chef?  Who knows, but our night was worthy of two stars at best.  If you go, hopefully you&#39;ll find them in finer form, and won&#39;t find your taste buds &#39;assalted&#39;."

Small neutral decor, almost underwhelming, like literally nothing on the walls. 

Menu highlights:
-Sea urchin from Maine as a starter. Super fresh and delicious
-Butternut squash with grilled Brussel sprouts. Lovely combination.
-Sea Bass with broccoli in a basil cream. Favorite dish that night. 
-Heart of Rabbit with white beans. Least favorite. Not a fan of white beans plus the rabbit was not tasty.
-Dessert, not memorable.

The standout out of this whole experience is the service. Amazing as if we were dining at a 4 star place. Staff was super  friendly and attentive. Someone was literally wiping our table in between meals. A bit delayed towards the end as we waited a while for our check

Lastly, I feel the price for the tasting menu didn&#39;t really match the food. Some dishes were tasty, but others were disappointing and we didn&#39;t even taste real meat on the table...just rabbit hearts. I know their menu changes seasonally but we was not happy with we were dealt with that week.  We would have better off dining from the regular menu.

If you come early or after 9, it is relatively easy to get in sans reservation. But during the hours of 7-9, it fills up pretty quickly, and the service is not the speediest. If you do come, with out resey, between these times, I believe you can expect a hefty wait."

Standouts of the meal included the freshly-baked bread with homemade ricotta, the squid ink tagliatelle with generous chunks of lobster, and the sublimely tender lamb loin. Oh, and did I mention the white chocolate-lemon biscotti that they sent home with us to enjoy with our coffee the next morning?

Yes, the restaurant was a bit warmer than I would prefer, but not enough to dock it a star (this is high praise from a grumpster who hates being hot and sweaty).

I&#39;ve had this place in my bookmarks forever; reading/hearing very good things about it, I was very excited to try it out tonight. A recent yelper, who was one of the few giving a &#34;not-so-positive&#34; reviews, hit it right on the nose - &#34;Manhattan attitude but not the food to match&#34;.  

Where do I begin - well, let&#39;s see, we came here with another couple and were promptly seated (the garden is actually a nice sitting area aside from the scent of rotten apricots that fall from the tree in the garden and the mosquitoes - the place does offer the OFF spray but no citronella candles). That was about it on the &#34;prompt&#34; aspect of things - aside from when we asked for the check.  It took quite a bit for the waitress to find her way to our table.  We were offered drinks, choosing two beers and two cocktails. While the waitress came back several times for various things, it felt like the drinks were being made from scratch (starting with fermentation of the beer) as they took an excessive amount of time to arrive.  

The food - let me step back for a second. One of the reasons we chose this restaurant tonight was because we checked out their menu on Yelp and saw that they offer Duck &amp; Foie Gras Terrine, Veal Sweetbreads, and Braised Short Rib - super excited. Imagine the disappointment when we arrived and saw that none of these items were offered.  In fact, the menu has changed ... nonetheless, we made our choices, ordering the following: Home made mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pickled apricots, Hamachi in ponzu sauce, Rigatoni Fra Diavolo (a supposedly large portion), Berkshire pork, Whole Wheat Fettuccine (also large), and Lobster.  While the mozzarella was not a complete disappointment, it was not worth the price charged for it.  Hamachi in ponzu sauce - you may as well eat these two separately as they did not compliment each other at all. Hamachi was tasteless, completely lacking any flavor; and while you would think the sauce would fix some of that, it did not - in fact, it did absolutely nothing for it.  Again, completely overpriced dish ( $17 for about 6 slices).  Both pasta dishes were ordered large as the waitress advised that the size of the small order is approximately the size of those little plates that are placed on the table to put your bread on.  The large portion, as it turned out, was not much larger - may be the size of a small salad plate.  Both pastas were entirely too al dente and were lacking in flavor.  There is not much to say about the pork - that does not mean it was good.  There was a pork rib and a pork medallion - flavor? Hm, take a guess.  Finally, the lobster - there was a piece of the claw and what appeared to be half of the tail on the plate with bok choy and enoki mushrooms, all in coconut broth.  I must say - the broth was the most flavorful part of the whole meal. The lobster - the jury is still out on that one ... while some of us guessed that it was frozen lobster, others felt that it may have been undercooked as it was very ... odd, rubbery, chewy, unexplainable; all summing up to $31. We did not bother with dessert as the meal was such a huge disappointment.

Service - oh boy ... we certainly got our water glasses refilled (quite a bit). Our waitress - hm, I&#39;m not particularly sure whether she simply could not be bothered with our table or it was just her (though I didn&#39;t notice the same attitude towards others) but there was just something very odd and discomforting about the interaction with her.  May be we simply did not appear to have sophisticated enough palates ... while she did ask if everything was alright, noting the hesitation in response she did not appear interested in exploring further.  

The evening could not be more of a letdown ... a completely overprice, flavorless dinner, with very poor service.  The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth and desire to find real food.  While spending $200 on a Friday night dinner with friends isn&#39;t completely outrageous - spending that kind of money and receiving a terrible experience is simply upsetting."

There are no precious nor fussy flourishes to distract from the food at hand, with each carefully curated piece included with a very deliberate hand.

Consider the single garnish of bush basil that lay a top the rigatoni - a lush, savoury dish bolstered by the full flavours and textures of pancetta, bread crumbs and corn.  The bush basil seemed almost an afterthought, but yet introduced a subtle bite of aromatic contrast that just cut through the pecariously-balanced savouriness of the rest of the dish.

The dusting of peanuts on the short ribs helped contribute to the Thai-leaning flavour profile of their unbelievably luxurious short ribs, just as the clean, fresh helping of yogurt, cucumber and cliantro helped to accentuate the amazingly well-executed black bass with which it came. 

There was no fanfare, no pretence - just fantastically cooked food that was clean, simple, but brilliantly thought out and executed.  The only dish I was not as much a fan of was their roasted chicken breast with a Mexican flair (tomatillos, Cotija cheese, lima beans) - the chicken could have been much juicier and tender (oh Locanda Verde, how you have ruined chicken for me), and probably because my disdain for beans can creep up and sully my opinion of the even the most perfectly executed dish.

But all in all, a wonderful meal.  We literally had to roll ourselves out the door after the 7-course tasting, which would certainly be my choice if I had the chance to do it again.  But if you are doing a la carte, get the short ribs or the black bass - both are absolutely phenomenal."

I enjoyed the scallops ($28), covered in a red tomato sauce with clams and fresh vegetables. Every bite was heavenly.

Great bartender who served us -- only one complaint: The restaurant needs a decent iced tea option. Please forgive my southernness, but I don&#39;t really want iced Campanile tea (see Greens, San Francisco, for great iced tea with locally grown mint).

This is a tiny place, but no difficulty in getting a seat if you go early. Loved it, and grateful for the beautiful artistry and tender care that accompanied this meal."

My partner and I arrived around 9 PM on Saturday night and were told there would be a 30 minute wait.  We left to get a drink next door, but 10 minutes later we received a text that our table was ready.  We downed our drinks, headed over, and each ordered the 5-course, 65 dollar, tasting menu. 

Surprisingly, there was not much to love about any of the dishes we tried, and many of them were far too seasoned--there was just so much salt in each of the items.  And I love salt--I almost never complain about something like this.  Also, I would argue there was nothing unique about the dishes presented--I didn&#39;t think there was a unifying theme or anything that tied them together to make thing that this is &#34;Battersby&#39;s&#34; food.  The one standout was the flat bread with the ricotta cheese and oil, but that wasn&#39;t really a course, it was just a nice condiment for the bread.  

Outside of the food--the ambiance is nice, and the service between courses was prompt (though light on explanation as to what we were eating).  When we first sat down however, it took well over 10 minutes to be greeted by the bartender or offered water or a cocktail.  The cocktail menu was nice, and it seems that they put a lot of care into the drinks (I had one that was only alright).  

In general, I was disappointed.  For 15 dollars more each, I recommend highly getting the tasting menu at Prospect in Fort Greene.  It was so far superior, that I doubt I will be back at Battersby, though the other reviews are so glowing, it will be hard not to give it a second shot."

We made a reservation for the 5 course tasting and was not disappointed in the food.  Everything was fresh and well made.  Left the place relatively full despite the little tasting plates.  A place like this has a bit of a tough time in Brooklyn though, because as much as I liked the food I did think it was slightly too expensive.  I&#39;m not sure that our tasting was worth $75 a person without drinks or tip.  The interior was tiny, nothing special, so I sort of feel like the place is neither here nor there.  It&#39;s not really a special occasion place, but it&#39;s also not really a place you can pop by on a Wednesday night either.  The staff was knowledgeable and accommodating but then again I was paying a pretty penny for my food.  

In a city like New York and even in Brooklyn, $200 is not a crazy amount of money to pay for a meal but its definitely also not a drop in the bucket either.  I guess I&#39;m just saying that I&#39;ve had better $200 meals."

Even if kale is your nemesis, even if kale is the most annoying food trend since quinoa, even if salads are for people eating lunch in Midtown, you deserve a spanking if you leave Battersby without eating the kale salad. This may sound crazy to those of you who haven&#39;t had it, but the flavors remind me of bun ga nuong (a Vietnamese chicken-and-vermicelli dish that I also love). The mix of tastes and textures is like eating a poem...or a love letter. 

Other things I don&#39;t normally like that Battersby seduced me with: sweetbreads (my husband ordered them and I had a bite to prove I wasn&#39;t a wimp), potato leek soup (which came as a FREE amuse and had the flavor of home, i.e. butter and cream), and ricotta cheese (yet another free touch to the meal, which came whipped, resting in a pool of yummy olive oil, and went amazingly with the free rosemary bread). All these generous and tasty touches really helps lodge this place in my cheapo heart. 

I was also lucky enough to get the short rib pastrami, which was tender and perfectly seasoned, though the extra seasoning on top was a bit thick and overwhelming. It came with potatoes that must have been poached in olive oil (or magic!) because they felt like eating silk (in a good way).

Other things worth mentioning: we got a table immediately (8 p.m. on a Wednesday); the service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing; the beer menu is big and really great and has a few beers I&#39;ve never encountered in NYC; the price was less than our typical fancy-dinner out--even with the 3 courses my husband ate; it&#39;s fancy food without being annoying about it."

And all my pleasures are like yesterday.

One of the first pleasures that would spring to mind would be this meal.

There exists a sort of breathlessness with which seasonality is described in Brooklyn. Trout are labeled as &#39;freshly killed,&#39; distances of supplying farms are listed in feet from the kitchen, and one imagines that at the current pace, we aren&#39;t far from a future in which our produce is embedded with stopwatches, depressed as it is picked and depressed once more when it reaches the pan. Battersby encapsulates all that this affectation strives towards but commoditizes none of it. No bearded salesman flashes a Wall Street grin while &#34;taking you on a tour&#34; of the provenance of the heirloom tomatoes comprising the namesake salad. You are told what you are presented with, nothing more. You know all the details as soon as you begin to eat. 

The burrata quivers under your fork, a basil leaf coasts down the now broken surface, halting only on reaching the pool of olive oil and juice from the tomato. The sourdough croutons remain remarkably rigid, the final element in a perfect composition. One attempted in so many places that you - for the life of you - could never recall while eating the masterstroke in front of you. Battersby is one of a mere handful of restaurants in which I heard none of the trite, grating comparisons of one dish to another that so dominates faux-friendship small talk. While it has become somewhat de rigeur to name drop signature dishes, Battersby forces you to forget what you have eaten, and forces you to contemplate what you are eating. Not out of confusion, though there is an unnerving state of shock afforded by the best plates sent from the kitchen. Shock which stems from the inevitably unanswered wondering as to how such ostensibly simple yet marvelous food has not been replicated elsewhere. The peaks reached are a testament to the ability of the chef and the efficiency of the humblingly tiny kitchen. The offered eggplant and cucumber are two such examples; the former based around a Japanese variety known for the difficulty in emphasizing its natural earthy sweetness achieved only through deceptively exact cooking, the latter a showcase of the range of textural and vinegary nuances of pickling and marinating. Both were stunning.

Lu and I came at the end of August, the closet thing to a culinary golden hour. The final summer harvests end in earnest, and the first fall growths are shipped off for a culinary easing of sorts into the relative bounty of autumn. Though the serving of both tomatoes and eggplants to bookend a dish based on preservation (the cucumbers) made this evident, it was most firmly driven home by the dishes involving protein. Having partaken in the 7 course option, I was hoping to be served a pasta course (as it is often served as one of the courses) as I&#39;d heard them to be extraordinarily well done. Upon my first bite of the chanterelle mushrooms flecked with smoked bacon laced under the trembling sheen of a hen egg, I promptly forgot any and all pinings for the duck pappardelle. I did not, however, forget the equally pervasive praise laid upon Battersby&#39;s fish dishes. It would be impossible to when brought a pan-fried red snapper, piquantly seasoned and meriting every ounce of its zucchini and bok choy purée, the vibrant, cool, minty and yet slightly bitter substance acting the perfect compliment to the spicy, firm fleshed fish, its skin crackling under cutlery strokes. Our final protein, the lamb, was the only misstep, and it was only perceptible in the face of the previously unbroken rhythm of greatness. The lamb itself was ever so slightly tougher than it should have been, and the accompanying chanterelle mushrooms and eggplant purée felt like toss-ins in light of their earlier excellence as principal players. 

Dessert at Battersby predictably merits high praise as well. Few places can render a humble rhubarb into something exciting. Fewer still would do so by pairing it with a pastry made from beets. The strawberry mousse is not the anchor holding these unlikely partners in the realm of dessert, but instead is the mast, binding all but useless without its sails. 

This is all to say little of the service, which is a fair sight better than many restaurants both neighboring and afar. The wait, long though it will be, is unequivocally worth it. If you are impatient, make a reservation for either of the tasting menus (5 or 7 courses) and prepare for glory.

It was freezing cold outside and we contemplated going to any nearby restaurant but after dithering on the street for a few minutes, I decided I needed to use the restroom so went back to Battersby to do so and upon exiting the bathroom, we were told we could have the bar seats since the party still did not answer or show up. :) Boy, was I happy to be out of the cold and I honestly didn&#39;t really want to eat just anywhere nearby since A and I haven&#39;t had a date night in a while. Sitting at the bar there was so nice and cozy! The bartender was super nice and friendly and we ended up splitting the broccoli, duck pasta and cod. The broccoli was delicious! While I actually wasn&#39;t a big fan of the cod, I did enjoy the potato mille feuille it came with and the duck pasta was delicious as well. The complimentary focaccia bread was a bit too hard for our taste but overall, we had a very nice time there. :)"

cow-and-clover-brooklyn-2,Molly T.,8R16InoIf-JheYnh9EOR7w,"New York, NY",1,1,1,615,569,_VuftiSAE49supo8B-cubA,4.0,2016-10-31,"I don&#39;t bookmark Brooklyn venues in the way that I bookmark Manhattan venues because, well, I live in Manhattan and am stuck in my ways. My Brooklyn bookmarks come in sporadic surges and seem, when I look back at them, kind of haphazard (other than the must-visit spots that Eater mentions). So while I&#39;m not sure why I had Cow &amp; Clover bookmarked, it stood out among many other Williamsburg eateries for that very reason. We needed to find a venue in South Williamsburg on Saturday night and so there I was, rediscovering the Cow &amp; Clover menu. It was pretty clear why I had bookmarked it: casual yet inventive food, an intriguing cocktail program and affordability. 

It would be difficult for a space like Cow &amp; Clover to exist in Manhattan. The real estate is fantastic and HUGE. We made an 8:30 reservation here but we would&#39;ve been fine without. Tons of seating for table service in addition to the bar, which takes up one corner of the restaurant. The vibe here, like the food, is on the casual side but still tasteful and refined within that label. It&#39;s industrial in design but still very warm--the massive wood-burning oven helps with that. 

Though it was initially the food that drew us here, the mixologists at C&amp;C know what&#39;s up. Though both cocktails I tried are not on the current online menu, I&#39;ll describe them to the best of my abilities. The first (see picture) was gin-based, spicy and herbaceous. I want to say it was called the &#34;Garden Gin&#34; but I could be totally off. It just happens to be very green. Though the ingredients didn&#39;t appear to be anything exceptional, the drink itself was. Well-balanced, super delicious. My second drink was a vodka-based raspberry lemonade that also had a kick. Both drinks featured pepper, which seems like a theme here. Too many places only pair spicy flavors with tequila, but they *absolutely* work with other liquors. Just requires a bit more effort. Since I don&#39;t drink tequila, I greatly appreciated this at C&amp;C. Don&#39;t worry, tequila fans, they&#39;ve got a great marg for you too. 

Food-wise, the main draw here is the wood-burning oven. In addition to the array of meat dishes offered on the everyday menu, there are typically a couple of additional specials, meant to be split between a few people. Most menu items are easily shareable, so I&#39;d highly recommend that route if all party members are on board. Eats, below:

Asparagus Fries w/ Buttermilk Ranch: A-
Given that C&amp;C is known for meat, we knew we&#39;d had to keep our eyes out for any veggie dishes to balance things out. Though these are fried (cornmeal-battered, to be exact), you still get full asparagus spears here. Pretty simple, but super tasty. The buttermilk ranch was creamy and delightful. That dressing would be good on just about anything. 

BBQ Chicken Flatbread: A
We were torn between this and the roasted veggie flatbread so we ultimately told the waiter to choose and surprise us. He returned quickly to share that he quite literally closed his eyes and pointed to one (now that&#39;s total surrender, folks) so we anxiously awaited what was hopefully going to be the pizza of our dreams. I was secretly hoping for the veggie flatbread but was and still am still fully content with the BBQ Chicken one. We order any traditional meat dishes, so this seemed like the proper choice. Oh, and it was all kinds of tasty. I tend to get food all over my face/hair/clothing/body when I eat--despite my parents&#39; fervent and ultimately futile attempts to teach me proper table manners--so messy dishes are comforting for me. Why? Well, typically they cause even the neatest of eaters to get a little crazy, so I don&#39;t feel so alone, for once. It&#39;s the little things. 

Wood Roasted P.E.I Mussels: A-
I was a bit wary of these. Seafood wouldn&#39;t be my first choice at a place that boasts top-quality meats. But these were fantastic. Simple but flavorful broth that preserved--even highlighted--the natural essences of the mussels. I find that too many mussels preparations feature sauces that are overpowering and the mussels to get a bit lost in the shuffle. Not here!

Mojo Bacon Skewers: A
There&#39;s nothing healthy about these. Thick slabs of bacon, visible fat, plenty of grease. But hey, when you&#39;re at an establishment like this, you gotta live a little. And these were as drop-dread delicious (I mean this both figuratively and literally...think about it) as you&#39;d hope. Bacon in all of its salty, fatty glory. House-cured, so you know it&#39;s well done. Only three skewers served, so you don&#39;t need to worry about too much commitment--just a couple of bites. 

Broccoli &amp; Cheddar Mac: A+
I wish we had asked for a size estimate before deciding on five dishes, because this is a serious bowl of mac and it arrived last (meaning we were right around full already). I don&#39;t eat mac and cheese often, so this was a serious treat. The bread crumbs on top made it next-level. Just concede to the carb cravings and order this. I can&#39;t imagine a world in which you&#39;d regret it."

The drinks were good but the food was pretty subpar. Neither the asparagus fries nor the dipping sauce had much flavor at all but those were much better than the &#34;flat bread&#34; which was one of the most bland yet awful tasting. The &#34;flat bread&#34; itself was barely cooked and the ingredients on top were disappointing."

The place itself has a great vibe - lots of wood, windows and high ceilings. With he dim lighting, it would make a great place for date night as well. The food was good - a little pricey but hey, it&#39;s Williamsburg. Since we had such a large group, we decided to share a bunch of appetizers: kale and butternut squash salad, mushroom and arugula flat bread, mojo bacon skewers, BBQ chicken flatbread, bacon mac and cheese, cheddar broccoli mac and cheese, pulled pork sliders, beef sliders, and loaded fries. I also shared the C&amp;C Classic Burger with fries. Everything was good, but nothing was outstanding. This place IS a good place for large groups because they have so many options, no need to worry about your vegetarian friends! The burgers were decent, and they did have a few options for dessert. The smores desert looked pretty, but ended up being a soupy mess. Try the other ones!

The only thing that dampened the night was service. Oue server was hard to get a hold of (which is impressive, I guess - few people would be able to ignore a table so large). By the end of our meal, we were the only ones left in the restaurant (though they were still open for another 45 minutes), and we felt like we were being rushed out. Server even made a stink about us wanting to split the check. Whatever, at least the birthday girl enjoyed it."

This spot is bright, hip and the food is extremely fresh. We ended up going with the Pre Fixe brunch since it was a large group. The pre-fixe brunch gives you the opportunity to sample a little bit of everything and for an additional $25 you&#39;ll get unlimited mimosas. The menu consisted of the following:
First Course to share:
Pastry Basket
Granola &amp; Yorgurt

Second Course to share:
Berkshire Pork and Potato Hash
Seared Shrimp &amp; Grits
French Toast
Short Rib Burger

Third Course to share:
Assorted Desserts

Everything was good but notably my favorite dishes were the Short Rib Burger and the Seared shrimp and grits. The burger was juicy and the grits were creamy, both dishes were excellent. It was nice to taste a little bit of everything BUT I would have rather been able to choose my OWN entree. I still felt hungry after the brunch and I didn&#39;t think that it was enough food for everyone to go around as I noticed other people were still hungry as well. Good spot that I would certainly come back to but I would not want to do the pre-fixe again."

I wasn&#39;t even able to enjoy the party of 25-30 that we had, or enjoy the food. It was 95 degrees outside that day &amp; they have an open kitchen. Not a single breeze. As we were eating our food, everyone was dripping sweat, wiping their face and taking breaks to fan themselves with napkins. 

Now I can understand if they had an issue with the AC, but wouldn&#39;t you think that a simple apology would do? Sorry for the inconvenience? My apologies our AC unit is out of service right now, can we offer you this this or that? Anything. A simple apology would have made a huge difference. 

Nope, nothing.. 

Now the food, the food was delicious. Can&#39;t knock that.

The decor was great.

We passed by on a Saturday evening and decided to have a small early dinner here. It&#39;s an extremely spacious place with big windows, which was a plus.
Our waiter was just &#34;awkward&#34;, I fell like he was just half awake at the time. 
At first, he just stood next to our table when we were not ready to order yet. 
After we ordered, it took 35 minutes for our food to come, we thought it was ridiculous! 
When he brought our food to the table, we asked for some bread. He was like... Sure. (We: why didn&#39;t you bring it earlier during that 35 minutes?!?!?!) Anyways, the bread was cold and dry.
When we were &#34;nearly&#34; finished our food, the waiter came to our table asking if we were still working on it, we said &#34;yes&#34;. And then he pointed at one of the dish asking &#34;even this??&#34; I let him take it even though there&#39;s still some left.
We were so speechless of this unfriendly service.
We had the Piri Piri chicken and Fried Pork Fat Potato to share. Chicken was quite dry but I needed the protein so whatever.
Thank god the white wine he recommended was great."

There was a bit of a mishap with our poutine order but they resolved that and even gave us a beautiful olive oil cake to share. 

Overall this place is a gem and worth the trip. Everything I ate was wonderful and the staff were super friendly. I personally prefer dinner over brunch.

We were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late (due to traffic). We opted out of the $25 pp unlimited Mimosas/Bloody Mary&#39;s and we are so glad we did (otherwise we would not have made it out haha!). We ordered the pitchers instead ($48 or so per pitcher). The mimosas were delicious and champagne was plentiful. The Bloody Mary&#39;s were spicy to perfection and really strong. Overall, the drinks were delicious, strong and got everyone buzzed. We got a good amount of cups per person out of the 2 pitchers. 

For food, I had the short rib burger and it was AMAZING!! the flavors explode into your mouth. I got mine medium well (more on the medium side) and it was delicious. My friends had the crispy duck eggs benedict - they said it was yummy as well. Boyfriend was not a huge fan of the pork and potato hash combo. He was jealous of my burger lol.

Brunch: $15 add on for bottomless mimosas, which you can begin at the bar if you arrive early. On a Sunday, C&amp;C was near capacity but I doubt you&#39;ll be waiting in a line. Attentive, helpful service. Mimosas were properly balanced champagne//OJ ratio.

Because our dinner was a family dinner, we basically shared the entrees and side dishes that came to our table. The portion size were a little small. I was definitely not full after our dinner. The desserts were adorable, but again size was a little small.

Even if you aren&#39;t a veggie person, order the veggie scramble and be converted. It is fantastic! My hubby and I split the short rib burger, which was amazing too... and the fries that came with? The BEST fries EVER! Definitely coming back for that. We got unlimited mimosas as well and I definitely attempted to get my money&#39;s worth, however either they were really light on the champagne or my tolerance is back with a vengeance because I wasn&#39;t the slightest bit tipsy at the end of my meal. Oh well...

Our service was stellar, especially since we had a huge group of people eating. We attempted to use an app they were promoting to pay the bill, but it wasn&#39;t working properly which was a problem since downloading the app is what comped our unlimited mimosas and the app would have automatically paid for it if it were working properly. We spoke to the manager about it and he was kind, but also wanting not to take a loss. He asked us to pay half of the mimosa bill, but we declined since it was unfair that it wasn&#39;t our fault that the app didn&#39;t work and made the point that he should take it up with the app company. Fortunately, he agreed with us and took it off the bill. I appreciated him opting to resolve the issue the right way with the app company instead of attempting to make it our issue. Much appreciated.

It&#39;s in a cute location with enough street parking if you are driving, so don&#39;t worry about that. You might have to walk a block or two, but not a prob. Great food. Great staff. Great location. Definitely worth a visit."

So much that I raved about Cow &amp; Clover and suggested that we try this place for brunch when my friend, who was visiting from out of town, was here. I already knew what to order, having looked at the menu online - Vegetarian soft scramble.  My friend was excited about what the brunch menu had to offer so she decided to go with French Toast.  

And now we begin with the timeline...

- 12:28pm we are seated
- 12:30ish we get waters for the table 
- 12:40pm we put our order in with the waitress

...time passes....

...time passes...

...crickets...

I begin to look around to see if anyone else who was seated post us, had any food on their tables.  None - except the people who were obviously there 5-10 minutes before we arrived.  We try to stay calm and see if any of the waitresses are around.  They were huddled up around the kitchen area but there were no plates going to any of the diners.

Finally at around 1:18 pm we manage to snag the hostess, who then gets our waitress.  She seems pretty out of it and apologizes - explaining that the chef had a car accident last night (concussion).  The manager was supposedly working the kitchen and it took a while for the rest of the kitchen crew to set up.  I will point out that it seemed like the waitress expected us to leave instead of wait for our meal.  When we told her we would wait...the waitress then said that it will take an additional 10 minutes and they would comp the whole meal.  

We continue to wait... again...

15 minutes pass by...

Another waitress comes by to tell us that the staff is pissed because they don&#39;t believe the chef actually got into an accident.  She says that it will take an additional 20 minutes.  She offers free drinks, but at that point it was already too late - we were extremely annoyed.  She offers us pastries to go and we leave after wasting more than an hour of our time.

Numerous things went wrong with this experience:
- They should have warned the guests that the chef was out and they were short staffed.
- They should have monitored us to make sure we were okay, before we had to get their attention (numerous times!)
- Both waitresses had conflicting attitudes about the missing Chef&#39;s &#34;accident&#34;, so it seemed like a suspect/shady excuse to cover up for piss poor service.

I can&#39;t remember ever having such a bad experience at a restaurant than this past Saturday.  

HORRIBLE!

I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!"

Seeing the restaurant was black owned and had good reviews, I asked all my friends to meet me there. I drove 1 hour and 15 minutes from Long Island only to be sorely disappointed. The waitress was very slow and water went unfilled several times (despite there not being many people in the restaurant - perhaps two other tables.)

I ordered the fish and chips, others ordered the ribs and chicken. 

My fish and chips were terrible at best. The cod was VERY BREADY and lacked seasoning (lemon didn&#39;t even help). The chips were good though. 

When the waitress came back 20 minutes later I told her I didn&#39;t enjoy the food (I had 2 bites of the fish). She rudely told me she came to check on us earlier and why didn&#39;t I tell her, to which I replied that she had not come to the table, or else our waters would have been filled. The attitude wasn&#39;t called for.

My friends didn&#39;t like their ribs but didn&#39;t complain. All 8 of them said they wouldn&#39;t come back. I asked for a manager and told him how nasty the waitress was. It&#39;s my birthday so why should I argue with someone? The manager was nice and apologetic, and said the waitress was by herself...to which I replied the restaurant had no one there so that wasn&#39;t a proper excuse. 

My cod was taken off the check. I will NEVER come back because the service was PISS POOR and the food wasn&#39;t great. Sometimes food isn&#39;t good, but for the service to be deplorable I hate I wasted such a long drive in tying to support an establishment."

Our server Jonna (sp?) was very personable and helpful.  We got the mussels for an app.  For meals, she got the short rib burger and I got the Delmonico roast.  We were both thrilled with our dishes.  The roast had a really flavorful crust as if it was smoked low and slow.  I am not sure how they prepare it but it came out perfectly medium rare. They had a few good local beers on tap (single cut, transmitter) and the cocktail our server recommended to us was very good as well.  Would love to come back the next time we are in the area."

I cannot comment on the food from the regular menu. The appetizer was a cold watermelon soup, which was interesting with a hint of tarragon. It came in a little shot cup. After that, hoping there was more food. Next was a Bibb Salad with Duck. There was one platter which was barely enough for four people. It was tasty, with chipotle dressing and a sprinkling of pork cracklings. Third course was fried mac and cheese which was very hard to cut into and dry inside. The spicy sauce was the best thing on the plate. The fried okra was mediocre. Next came the pork spare ribs, dry rubbed with BBQ sauce on the side. The ribs were burnt and dry. Fell off the bone but chewy. Could not eat most of it. The sauce was underwhelming and bland. The corn with Chile Lime Aioli was tasty as was the Cole Slaw. Best thing I had in the meal. The oatmeal cookie for dessert was disappointing. If I did not come here for a party. Would not recommend it for a party. The service was also not great. Had to repeat drink orders many times.

I love you. 

We met Mike today and had a truly amazing experience. It was our first time at cow and clover. My friends found it on Yelp and it came up under our search for bottomless brunch. 

At first, we thought the mood was a little too calm for our friends. But then we met Mike - he made our glasses truly bottomless. My mimosa was never empty and he recommended the duck Benedict and it was DIVINE.  10/10 would return.

Came here on Friday for a small birthday dinner with some girlfriends. At first, I felt great knowing that it was my first time here; I thought I made a great choice just off of Yelp and Google reviews/pictures. For example, the ambiance was amazing. That&#39;s where the amazing stuff ends. The waitress was nice to us but seemed like she wasn&#39;t all the way there/present. I won&#39;t be too hard on her though but the first thing she asks me is if I wanted a cocktail after she found out it was my birthday. I found that slightly weird but whatever, I went along and ordered one. Then the food took over an hour to come out, even though the restaurant was fairly empty. It was almost as if the waitress didn&#39;t bother to at least tell us that our food is on its way. We finally got the food but my baby back ribs tasted like burnt meat; it was charred all around, luckily there was BBQ sauce on the side to help me out. Lastly, even though it was my birthday, the restaurant did not make me feel special at all. Everywhere I have been on my birthday either had the staff sing happy birthday or at least gave me a little dessert on the house on my way back. These are small things that make a difference.

Cool place, good atmosphere and our server (Megan) was great! but they charge $25 for bottomless drinks on top of your entree. More frustrating because on the menu is says +$10 for mimosa or Bloody Mary, so confusing this isn&#39;t bottomless, but just for one drink. It&#39;s not this expensive in Manhattan!

For our main course, I got their spin on the bacon, egg and cheese.....awesome choice. My husband got the short rib burger which he said was the best he&#39;s had in a long time. It came with this smoky bbq sauce that was incredible.

There are not many vegetarian options on the menu, so I decided to go for the &#39;Chickpea and Autumn Vegetable Stew&#39; which was ok. The portion was pretty small but really flavorful. 
 
Definite winner of this restaurant experience was the &#39;Homemade Cookie Plate&#39;.
The cookies were so fresh and still warm, they just melt in your mouth.. Wow!!!!

We went in with generic expectations, another Brooklyn farm to table new American restaurant. What we got was so much more than expected. These people are customer service professionals.

First the food... We ordered for the table...
Muscles - some of the best I&#39;ve ever had, a must order 
Hush puppies - they were good but not as special as the rest of the meal
Soft Shell Crab - amazing 
The meat specials for the table...
First I love this concept. 8 oz of meat with two sides for the table. Personally I don&#39;t need that much for myself so I loved this concept.
Pork Shoulder - the table was divided on what our favorite was, half said the pork which was perfectly cooked not too fatty and wonderfully seasoned.
Steak - stand out of the night! One of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever had, it came sliced medium rare and every slice was perfectly salted. I will probably order every time I return.

Now let&#39;s talk about the service... Beyond. Our service was knowledgable, attentive, and friendly. When you walk away from a dinner knowing where the food is from, where some of the chefs are from and how that inspired items on the menu and personal things about your waitress it makes it an interactive experience. When we raved about the wine and muscles she made sure to tell us they&#39;re both half price for happy hour on Wednesdays ensuring we will be repeat customers.

Amazing management, sometimes it can be awakes when a manager comes to your table to generically ask how things are not caring about your response that was not the case here. He was so interested in our feedback and ended up sending us out three different desserts compliments of him based on our feedback. If we weren&#39;t already having one of our best Brooklyn dining experiences we were now, it went from what started as a great dinner to a memorable one. 

Will 100% be back, if you&#39;re looking for a great meal in Brooklyn cow &amp; clover is showing up a lot of the area staples."

Maybe it was my fault coming in with high expectations.  Sat with large group, ordered every menu item.  Sadly, the best thing was a hamburger.  Love the concept of wood burning ovens- sides,  beef shoulder,  fall short. With the word Cow in your name, you would think more beef selections-nope."

Came here with the family and figured we&#39;d do the large roast for the table hoping it would be the pig, ham, leg of lamb,  beef Delmonico, etc.

The day we went, I was disappointed to learn it was the whole roast chicken.  I&#39;ve had enough whole roast chicken, at least the rotisserie ones from Costco, Wholefoods, Associated Supermarket, etc.  Roasted chicken just doesn&#39;t seem like something I&#39;d order at a restaurant.  But since we are there already and are a table of 6, we did everything family style and gave the whole roast chicken a try even though I wouldn&#39;t have ordered it myself.  To my surprise the chicken was moist, flavorful and just perfectly done.  Probably one of the best whole roast chicken I&#39;ve ever had.  I mean compared to the $7.99 supermarket ones.  The sides we picked was brussel sprouts and cauliflower  - sides might be a bit on the saltier side but still very tasty.  I&#39;m normally not a huge brussel sprouts person but they did it really well!  Not burnt black.  

We ordered the charcuterie sample of 3.  The meat is a bit fattier than the normal prosciutto/sausage kind of charcuterie because it had beef cheek, lardo and pork belly.

The cocktail menu was decent with just $12 a drink so price is reasonable.

We had a good experience there and would recommend this place for a larger party.  I&#39;d like to check it out for happy hour and brunch sometime."

We do Valentine&#39;s Day dates the day before or after so this was our date. The ambience is lovely - it&#39;s very laid back, beautiful wood tables and the lighting fixture above the entrance is gorgeous. The decor is rustic and cozy. I particularly loved not having a TV in my face as the dining area doesn&#39;t have any TVs (that&#39;s tucked away in a corner at the bar area). The food was fantastic - we had a steak to share and it was just perfectly seasoned and cooked. For sides we had sautéed kale (also delicious), and the best - roasted brussels sprouts. We are big fans of vegetables to begin with, but I think anyone who&#39;s not a fan of veggies should try these brussels sprouts; they were absolutely incredible. There was some lemon, some mint, and I don&#39;t know what kind of crack because we couldn&#39;t stop eating them even after we were full. I highly recommend them.  
I have to give a special thanks to our server, Jonna (hope I spelled it right). She was extremely attentive, sweet, and funny. Our steak was taking longer than anticipated I guess (we were too busy talking and having a good time to even notice!), so she brought me a second glass of Malbec - on her.

We were greeted by a very kind hostess, lead to our tables (AND ASKED if we liked where we were seated. HUGE PLUS). She offered to take our coats (really nice touch). 

We were given a pre-fixe, four course menu. I ordered an oyster, pork sausage over beets, trout with lobster, and a champagne truffle cake. 

My oyster was divine, not a classic sauce that one would expect. Perfect for one that is new to trying an oyster for the first time. Pork sausage was divine. I am not one to eat sausage...but it was so tender, and flavorful. The trout and lobster was my favorite. The sauce was exceptional. My trout was definitely overcooked. The champagne truffle cake is a MUST MUST MUST. I am usually a chocolate person, but this was out of this world. 

Ambiance: I love how you can see the kitchen. Everything about this restaurant is clean, and well managed. The view from the windows=breathtaking. 

service issues that made us really cringe throughout our meal. 
1) my boyfriend declined having an oyster, but I made it known to the waitress that I LOVE oysters. Considering we were paying for the pre-fixe, the extra oyster should have been offered to me. Needless to say, it would be the same price with or without. 
2) my boyfriend changed his mind, and wanted to try the oyster. We asked the waitress, and she replied: &#34;I&#39;ll see what I can do.&#34; I felt that was INAPPROPRIATE. We are customers, are we an inconvenience to you?
3) I finished my glass of wine during my main course. I felt that it complimented my entree very well. I was not offered a refill until after my main course was finished. It became almost impossible to wave down servers. 

Overall, we really enjoyed the food this restaurant offers. The wine selection is superb. We will most definitely be coming back again. We are looking forward to their full dinner menu."

It&#39;s a gorgeous space and still feels cosy despite the industrial look. The greeting was friendly and we were seated even though our party wasn&#39;t all present.

Sadly it wasn&#39;t great from there. I should note that we were a large party, but that the restaurant was also never even half full for our time there.

Service was very very slow, waiting to order, (30 mins) for drink refreshes (glasses were empty for up to 20 minutes at a time) and for food (over an hour after ordering) is just poor especially when it was quiet and what seemed like adequate staff. When it arrived, the food was ok but not great. The burger seemed like the best option amongst our group, others fared less well. The duck Benedict and pork hash were both pretty meager portions, and the latter might as well have been kosher for the amount of pork in there! I don&#39;t believe brunch should be a huge meal, but I also don&#39;t want to have to eat again 15 minutes later, which we did......"

We shared the mussels and highly recommended it.  Large in size and the broth was so yummy that we almost drunk the juice!  Excellent to share or have by yourself.  For mains, we ordered the roast chicken and the cod.  Carb-free heaven!  Love the char on the chicken from the wood-burning oven.  It was a instant hit.  All and all a very enjoyable meal.  Price points for the mains were on a steeper side but we were glad to support locally sourced ingredients. Lastly, the staff and service were all wonderful and very attentive.

We ordered the flatbread it came out plain with some parsley sprinkled on it, it was missing Ricotta and peppers as stated on the menu so we sent it back, they had rushed it because they made a mistake so they didnt cook it properly, instead of cooking it all the way in the oven to get a crispy bottom all the way it came out very pale and soggy, its an open kitchen so we saw that they had cheated and put it under the salamander to try to give it some color on top.  My burger tasted pretty good although they didnt cook it to the temperature I asked for but my wifes Chicken was incredibly salty and the dish was very oily on the bottom. We are both in the food industry and was looking forward to this place but what a big letdown."

When I came across Cow and Clover I knew that I found the place.  I exchanged several emails with Jason Lloyd who is part of the team that runs this restaurant.  He was very responsive, pleasant, and very professional.  I could tell that this restaurant is run very well and my event would go smoothly.

The Food
Our baby shower was during brunch so we had an opportunity of tasting everything on the menu.  Everything tasted amazing but my favorites were the short rib burger, french toast, smoked salmon grits, the chicken, and for dessert, the graham blondie

The Service
The customer service at the restaurant was top notch.  Everyone was super friendly and accomodating"

I&#39;ve been here a number of times since its inception and now it&#39;s time to spread the word.  I know what you may be thinking, well if it&#39;s so good, why have you waited so long to review it?  Well the short answer is that yesterday my life changed in an irreversible way when I stumbled across Shia Leboeuf&#39;s motivational &#34;Just do it&#34; speech.  So I balled up my fists and violently banged out this review.

The cornerstones of this mighty establishment, an establishment that rests firmly in the bedrock of Kent Street, are probably made of some sort of cement and re-bar, I am not sure.  But I am sure of this: the metaphorical cornerstones of the restaurant are its blazing hot wood fired ovens. They&#39;re quite hot.  Mesmerizingly hot.  There&#39;s power in King&#39;s blood, hot.  Fire.  Death by fire is the purest death.  Shit... I mean... I&#39;ll have the short rib burger, please.  Uhh, medium-rare.  Thanks.

The jalapeno lemonade was my favorite drink when it was still on the menu.  When/if it comes back, give it a try.  Outside of the short-rib burger, I would recommend their large meat roasts.  Thanks to the searing effect of the wood fired ovens, all of the meat is bursting with savory flavors and buttery fats.  Pair them with a choice of two great sides, like roasted brussel sprouts and butternut squash gratin, and you can&#39;t go wrong.  In general, they maintain a rotating selection of well-sourced meat that&#39;ll leave you with a clear conscience.  Free-range, grass fed, and wild caught.  One of the sources is Flying Pigs Farm in Sushan, NY.  Check out the website to see some happy and healthy pigs.

Last, but not least, the service has been perfect every time.  I have the most experience with their server, Allie.  She will take great care of you if you happen to have her."

For some reason the managers thought it was wise to schedule only two servers on Mothers Day for Brunch. This made everything SUPER slow. 
I waited 40 minutes for a pastry that was certainly already made. 
I ordered the bottomless mimosas and only got two the entire time I was there due to poor service. 
My main course (Piri Piri Chicken) was good but most people I was dining with did not enjoy their food due to how annoyed they were with the waiting time.
A dining experience will always be ruined if the front of house can&#39;t meet the back of house and serve their patrons.

Sometimes, I make REALLY good decisions. Coming here was one of them.

Cow &amp; Clover greets you with an adorably decorated rustic interior. The space is bright and open during the daytime, with ample light coming from the large windows. As the sun sets, the dining room is cozy and romantic, with dim light emanating from the candle-lit tables. 

The menu is limited, but far from lacking in great options. My friends and I ordered the short rib burger and two of the large roast specials. My friend ate his burger in what seemed like seconds, unable to put it down after it arrived. My other friend and I, who had ordered the large roasts, intentionally took our time with the meats and the two sides. We both agreed the broccoli rabe was &#34;perfect&#34; and I couldn&#39;t get over the flavorful, almost sweet cauliflower I was served. I kept stealing bites of my friends pork roast, obviously also great, while lamenting that I couldn&#39;t enjoy bites of the butternut squash gratin she was raving about ( eff gluten). 

The real star here was the prime rib beef delmonico on my plate. Maybe it&#39;s the years of veggie burgers and tofurkey talking, but I literally cannot recall eating a tastier piece of meat in my life. The thin cuts sitting in front of me were buttery smooth, with a hint of smoke and peppercorn perfection. I paced myself to make the experience last longer, and only with a heavy heart allowed the server to remove the plate. I&#39;ve always believe that if I went back to meat, it could only be of the farm-to-table variety. After this experience,  I know why - you can literally taste the difference of a cow raised on an indigenous diet with a healthy, long life. It was so good that when I overheard a nearby table debating between that dish and getting two burgers, I interjected to demand they order the roast. They laughed then, and thanked me later. (Fo&#39; real).

The meal would not have been complete without the Trediberri wine, a new favorite in my book. While the prices here make it more of a special-occassion-type place for me, I will definitely be bookmarking this place to come back - perhaps with my parents ( but like, lay off me, I&#39;m an adult)."

Plenty of space inside, you can choose from bar seating, regular tables, or elevated group tables that can seat 10-12.

Their short rib burger is fantastic, and all of their starters are very good.  Special props to the tomato/burrata salad.

Also, they have a daily special &#34;roast&#34; that you can share with the table.  When we went it was a pork shoulder roast.  All the roasts come with 2 sides as well.

It&#39;s a new restaurant, so they&#39;re still sorting out logistics, getting bartenders trained, etc.  But the ambiance is great and the food is good, I think they&#39;ll be successful.

The service was nice and sweet.
Although the food was not great.
2 of us got the burgers and they did not like it at all. Bun and meat were dry and the rest tasted like old. My vegetarian friend got the vegetarian hash and did not finish it and I got the smoked duck eggs Benedict and it was a bit too creamy and rich.

The Bloody Mary was left on the table after 2 sips as it tasted like hot-sauce and vinegar only. 

What made up for it was the mimosa.

We might not seek for this place for brunch but we might keep it as a plan B option."

The $5 mussels were excellent, great taste to the broth and not salty! Needed to re order a second serving. Wanting to try something different, I chose the Lamb special. Roasted 5 hours, seasoned up with anchovies paste, mint, and other spices, this tasted amazing. (No anchovies taste, just only one of the seasoning I remember) As for the sides, the Squash Gratin was a BIG hit, and I really enjoyed the Cauliflower. Family ordered the Trout entrees, and really liked it. The Barley served as the side with it could be its own dish, it was that good. Desserts, the homemade ice cream and cookies were the winners here.. Homemade Marshmallows IN the Rocky Road ice Cream? Yes, they are! RR fans, visit just for this..

We were the only table for hours on a Sunday and rarely saw our server. She was sweet, kind of absent minded  and very unattentive....never checked on us after the food was delivered and we had to wait over 30 mins for the check then she disappeared again....not sure if she was preoccupied with her life or what. The service was meh at best. The food....well, goes with the service. The brussel sprouts were undercooked and hard. We asked to have them cooked longer (maybe they would soften up or something?) but they came back just as awful.  The poultry for two was the biggest disappointment ever....$52 for a tiny sized chicken that I could have easily eat by myself?!  It took over an hour to cook as well. Though it was the only delicious food that the table had, the skin had loads and loads of salt on it.  When they cut up the bird for you, they do NOT give you all the meat....just the breast, thighs and legs. Should have asked for the whole bird to be brought to the table so we could actually try and eat more. Overall, it was a huge disappointment. Everyone (table of 8) said the food was meh it was the worst dining experience we&#39;ve had in the area. Williamsburg and Greenpoint have WAY better establishments."

I also don&#39;t usually take reviews seriously when the reviewer hasn&#39;t written much, as is the case for me. So, I&#39;ll understand if you read this and ignore it. Nevertheless, I feel obliged to provide this feedback. 

Went with my wife and waited over an hour for the wood-fired chicken, which I understand is meant to take around 10 minutes to cook given the very high heat of the oven. We noticed two chefs repeatedly moving the chicken in and out of the oven the entire time, studying it like some kind of laboratory specimen to see if it was cooked. 

In hindsight, this should have been enough warning for us to just get up and go, but we gave the kitchen the benefit of the doubt.

When the chicken finally arrived, it was fairly tasty in an oily way, and in the dim light it was hard to see the color of the meat. But, sure enough, we were both food poisoned and violently ill within 2-3 hours of the meal. 

This can and does happen at good places, but it&#39;s certainly not a promising start for a new restaurant. I really hope the kitchen team gets their act together, as the place already seemed pretty empty for a Wednesday night. Service was nice, and they brought us a free scoop of ice-cream for having waited (although sadly it wasn&#39;t with us for long...)

Needless to say we will not be back."

Went there with a friend the other night and left happy and full :) 
I met Morgan (the head chef) while he was cooking in Ft Greene and I&#39;ve followed his cooking at Il Bucco, Isa and Omar&#39;s la Renita and I&#39;ve always been a fan. This food has influences of all of those places but it&#39;s got it&#39;s own thing going on. There were lots of stand out dishes, among them was one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had and a killer good squid dish. 
The cocktails we had were great as was the wine (though the wine selection is quite small). It&#39;s a big spot which I find quite refreshing for change: no wait for a table, no squeezing in and lovely high ceilings. I look forward to going back."

It was really quiet when we arrived--they just opened up and head a choice of where we&#39;d liked to be seated. Our server was a hoot! (Allie--you&#39;re awesome!) She recommended the mussels as well as the burger. The mussels was so creamy and the broth--man the broth! We had to order more bread to mop up the rest of the broth because it was so delicious. 

Our entree was the short rib burger--the ketchup was not your ordinary dip which was very enjoyable. We liked our server so much that we asked for her dessert recommendation as well--we got the whiskey date bread pudding. This actually had whiskey flavor to it--which is rare since it&#39;s usually burnt off during the process.

Overall, loved the firewood concept and the ambiance. Will definitely make my way back there again."

We stopped by on a busy Saturday around 12:30pm and there was a ~45 min wait. They will take down your phone number and text you when a table is ready so we were able to wander around for awhile while we waited - which was much appreciated. 
Once we finally sat down we were starving and ordered a TON of food. I had the chilaquiles which were presented in a &#34;deconstructed&#34; way which I didn&#39;t really care for. However, the flavors were great and once you got a bite together with a little bit of everything on it, the dish was really tasty, My date had the poached eggs which is the Little Owl&#39;s take on an eggs benedict. It was delicious and definitely what I will order if I go back. Interesting to note that the poached eggs and the enchiladas (if that even counts) are really the only breakfast-y items on the menu with any meat in them. We also ordered two of the meatball sliders which were insanely good (must try!) and a side of fries which were also awesome. 
The biggest downside to the meal however was the lack of booze. We were told that they don&#39;t serve liquor so we weren&#39;t able to get a bloody mary which I have to say was definitely a disappointment. They have a michelada on the menu, but it&#39;s just not the same."

Located on a quaint corner in the quaint neighborhood if Greenwich Village is the quaint restaurant of Little Owl. We went for dinner on a Saturday night and the whole experience was very memorable. 

Starting with the atmosphere, the restaurant is definitely small but it gave a cozy feel that we loved. All the staff was so friendly and approachable, which added to the charm. The hostess even remembered our names throughout the night which was much appreciated.

As for the food, it was fantastic. My girlfriend and I split all the dishes and we got the gravy meatball slider, kale and cranberry salad, lobster soup, and skirt steak special. Highlights were the meatball slider and the skirt steak special. The meatball slider had the perfect texture and savory bite. The steak was perfectly cooked and the sauce was straight forward but done so well.

I wanted to try so many things on the menu, but sadly didn&#39;t have the chance. I highly recommend Little Owl if you have a chance. Let me know what you think of all the delicious items I didn&#39;t get a chance to try!"

Don&#39;t get: flap jacks! They&#39;re so dry you have to pour a ton of syrup for it to be good. then you&#39;re just eating sugar. 

When to go: for weekend brunch try to get here early to avoid a long wait. Or just put your name down and go walk and shop around west village. they will text or call you when the table is ready.

Other tips: take a photo of the outside! The building is what they used for the tv show Friends. 

More details: I came for brunch and they&#39;re known for their meatballs which they have on both brunch and dinner menus. It was good but doesn&#39;t taste super unique. It was just cute to see it in a small slider. Nothing too special though. And the onion soup has wayyy too much cheese and bread for my liking - I prefer it with more soup. Overall, not impressed for their brunch menu."

Being that I&#39;m Mexican, I was skeptical but the sauce in addition to the crispy tortilla chips and avocado really made the dish work. For chilaquiles, it&#39;s all about the sauce and Chey Joey gets it.

I make similar sauce for my chilaquiles (a bit spicier with queso cotija y crema) but when I don&#39;t have enough time to invest in the detailed steps required to make the sauce, I&#39;ll head over to Little Owl since I live down the street. They also had a tostada slider today that I didn&#39;t try but sounded great!

I also tried the meatball slider which was the bomb.com. Cute place. Look forward to returning."

The brunch menu was absolutely perfect for what we were looking for: a variety of delicious breakfast and lunch items.  Little Owl serves simple, comforting meals with unique splashes of flavor added to each classic dish.  We began with the Gravy Meatball Sliders as our appetizer. They were amazing!  For my entree, I ordered the Chicken sandwich. The bread, chicken, spring mix and cheese all tasted so fresh!  It was a perfect combination.  I absolutely loved every bite!  I also tried a bite of the Baked Cod over a bed of sweet summer corn and peas succotash.  That was somehow just as delicious, if not better!  I am eager to try their other menu items.  

I would recommend the Chocolate Souffle with the Espresso gelato for dessert, but I know a lot of people like the Beignettes with nutella and raspberry sauce.

The outside of the restaurant is adorable with bright red painted windows and blue awning on the corner of a tall brick building that was used in the filming of the show &#34;FRIENDS.&#34;  The inside of the restaurant is also very charming. It reminded me of an English bed and breakfast- cozy booths, lots of windows and shelves of home decor and plants.  It is a small place, so I would definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time!

Based on the simpler menu items and less formal atmosphere, I would classify the Little Owl as more upscale casual, as opposed to fine dining. However, we definitely enjoyed the same quality of ingredients and recipes at Little Owl that we would at any fancier restaurant.  I have heard that their dinner menu is also wonderful.  I hope to return soon!

If you&#39;re from out of town, be sure to spend some time walking around Greenwich Village before or after your meal.  It&#39;s a beautiful place!"

I have always felt that the Village excels in the number but not quality of its restaurants, and the Little Owl is a rare exception.

The space is cozy.  And the staff is welcoming.  Arrive on a hot summer day when the ten tables are occupied at your time of reservation, and you are offered a warm smile and a glass of cold water as you wait to be called.  The menu is short but has a fair amount of diversity and, if you are here, you might as well have your own selection reflect that.

Start with a healthy salad.  Golden Beets &amp; Seeds comes with sunflower sprouts and parmesan cheese.  Crunchy and delicious, although not that filling.  Complement that with a not-so-healthy choice of asparagus home-fries.  And grilled roasted corn with cheese, in &#34;spicy Mexican style&#34;.  You would then have a satisfying meal.  All of the food here is tasty and the prices are appropriate for the location and level of service.

The Little Owl will be on my rotation of brunch places, with Cafe Cluny, Bubby&#39;s and other casual dining options in the downtown area.  If you don&#39;t give a hoot about formal dining in a quiet setting, then this restaurant will please you."

The ambience is very cozy and intimate mostly because it is a very small space inside. Definitely try to book your rear adjoins earlier especially if it&#39;s a group larger than two. 

We started off with the meatball sliders for appetizer and ordered the pork chop and skate with a side of the brussels sprouts. The meatball slider was very tasty but pretty small so it would be ideal to be portioned one per person and not shared. I really enjoyed my pork chop as it was cooked perfectly and tender and also was a pretty big portion. My boyfriend enjoyed the skate and the bok choy it came with. Neither of us were very impressed by the Brussels sprouts. It was a little on the hard side and we guessed they steamed it instead of roasting it which would have been softer and tastier. I would pass on this dish. Otherwise it was a nice dinner with very friendly staff."

It&#39;s small and simple with a homey and welcoming feel. The staff is extremely friendly and never let us run out of coffee, which is a huge plus on my list. Luckily there was no wait when we went on a late Sunday morning and we were seated and served very promptly. 

We ordered the Mexican scramble special (scrambled eggs with jalapeños, tomato, salsa, avocado with a side of beans and chips) and the flapjacks (wheat pancakes topped with berries). We also shared a side of bacon, which was thick cut and griddled to perfection. If you&#39;re a bacon lover, it&#39;s a must have. The portions aren&#39;t too big for the entrees, but the side of bacon was definitely enough to share. 

A bit pricey, it ended up being about $14 per entree, $9 for bacon and $4 per coffee. $50 total for the two of us to enjoy a decent brunch and start our day off right. Not somewhere I&#39;d go regularly, but for a nice weekend treat it&#39;s worth a little splurge. But I do want to return to try their meatball sliders which seem to be all the rave."

My friend and I stopped by in the morning and it was completely empty, so we were able to grasp the best corner seat, from where you could enjoy a good view of street.

I loved my scrambled egg with mushroom and pea, cooked in a way that I could enjoy both the tenderness of egg and the fresh smell of mushroom. My friend was on a training session yet still could not resist from trying their strawberry toast. I stole a bite - really, no need to add any syrup and it was just at the right level of sweetness!

I guess there was only one complain - we felt a little bit rushed...while my friend was still enjoying her toast, our waitress came multiple times and asked whether she could clean up the plate. Really a bit annoying if you could answer the same question many times with the same answer. But I do recommend this place for some simple tasty food!"

As expected, the restaurant is small and cramped, but it&#39;s not much of an issue sitting down.  Everything we ordered was good - but note that the appetizer portions are very small and pricey. 

We started with the grilled scallops and gravy meatball sliders.  They were kind enough to split each dish for us on individual plates.  I ordered the filleted whole fish which was just okay (nothing special).  The BF ordered the lamb chops which were delicious.  

For dessert, we shared the spiced sugar beignets (always a good choice) and the blueberry graham cracker cheesecake (just okay).  Overall, we had a nice evening.  Glad we went, but don&#39;t need to go back for dinner - maybe brunch one day?"

FOOD
Gravy Meatball Sliders -- Pay $6 per slider.  I just ate the meatball, but it was good.  It wasn&#39;t doused in gravy... it&#39;s as one would expect from the name

Chilaquiles -- Two sunny side eggs (think you can customize the egg prep) with 1/2 an avocado sliced plus tortillas on the side covered in a slightly spicy red sauce.  As someone who is pretty sensitive to spice, this really didn&#39;t have much heat.  This was filling but not as flavorful as it looks

Crunchy Chicken Culet -- Delicious chicken.  My favorite dish

The table next to me ordered the Beignettes, which didn&#39;t look that appealing in person.  Both the beignettes and the nutella had this &#39;hard&#39; look to them as if the former had been slightly overdone while the later had been sitting out in the air for too long.

It was incredibly flavorful and my two shrimps were fried to perfection! My husband&#39;s appetizer of soft shell crab over pasta was tasty but not as creative.   I wish they did more with the pasta and the sauced. It was just marinara sauce so a but disappointing in my book.  The entrees were beautifully cooked by an artist.

Watermelon and Arugula Salad
Peach and Fig Salad
Sauteed Kale
Summer Squash
Spinach Risotto 

I would write something about each to detail the taste but to be honest, each one caused an explosion of happiness and taste bud heaven in my mouth. I may have loved the spinach risotto the most but it is a toss up between the others. For desert, I got the Chocolate Souffle cake with Espresso Ice Cream and my husband got the Nutella Beignet&#39;s.

My Kale and Potato Frittatini was a little on the dry side and not that exciting overall.

The staff are very friendly and try to accommodate you as best they can since this is a small but packed business. 

Their thing to try here are their gravy meatball sliders so of course me and my friend ordered them. Very soft; melt in your mouth bite for sure. But as for taste, it is lacking and a bit on the salty side. We also ordered the lobster gazpacho as an appetizer and it was a bit disappointing. The lobster was deliciously cold and refreshing but the gazpacho I thought tasted a bit too much like it was lime juice and tomato sauce straight out of a can. 

We also decided to order the grilled/roasted corn. OMG. It was so delicious that we devoured that plate. 

As for our entrees, i had a swordfish special and my friend ordered the salmon. My swordfish was perfect. Not overcooked and it came with some greens and rice. It was a pretty overwhelming meal considering swordfish isn&#39;t exactly light and airy. Again, the greens and sauce was very salty. The swordfish made it alright to eat it with but i definitely couldn&#39;t finish this dish. I practically drank the whole bottle of sparkling water alone with this dish.

Finally got to try this place for dinner last night and had high expectations for the food and the food definitely hit it out of park.

ATMOSPHERE: Small cozy intimate restaurant. It was rainy that night so it definitely had an even cozier vibe. A small candle on each table with a tiny bar that sits four. Even though it was a tiny place, I didn&#39;t feel like it was very cramped. Great for catch-ups and dates.

FOOD: Menu is simple and straightforward. Ordered a BASIL GNOCCHI with pork belly to share and it was divine. The sauce was great...has a nice sweetness to it and great for dipping the bread. The gnocchi had a perfect texture. They split the pasta into individual dishes and I love it when restaurants do that! For my entree, I ordered their special of the night which was SCALLOP AND SHRIMP RAVIOLI in a lobster broth. The seafood was cooked perfectly and the broth was so tasty. I loved everything about this dish. My friend ordered their famous PORK CHOP, which was a massive cut of meat. She enjoyed it very much. I was full, and really wanted to try their famous beignets but couldn&#39;t bring myself to eat anything else. I will definitely try it next time!

DRINKS: Prosecco pink lemonade. Very good.

SERVICE: Good attentive service.

Overall this place is pretty good and has a cute atmosphere but is a little pricy. 

I got a coffee to drink which was $4. Usually places charge 2-3$ for an Americano so this was a little more than usual. Also they only have regular milk here. 

I got the kale and potato frittatini which is basically 4 small pieces of frittata with smoked salmon on top. It is quite a small dish for $15 and I wasn&#39;t very full from it. I would maybe order it as an appetizer rather than a main course

I also tried the special that my friend ordered which was vanilla French toast with strawberry compote and it was amazing. The bread was  caramelized but not overly sweet. This was $12 and a much larger portion but personally I do not like sweet entrees.

The potatoes had a flavor that  tasted from burnt oil so I pushed those to the side and enjoyed the spinach risotto we ordered for a table share topped with pine nuts and and was just the right texture for a risotto.Chocolate soufflé cake was more of a molten choc cake style and was not very sweet (which I prefer) but would have liked more of a soufflé quality to it. 
Sorbet trio was excellent fruit flavors. Beignets also not too sweet but a bit more like doughnuts than a true beignet. Service was not rushed and attentive but without hovering. Dinner guest got up to use bathroom and his napkin was refolded... I loved that... It was not a formal dining experience at all ... Very cozy and lively crowd of mixed ages"

I had a dish with clams[1], with a sauce so good I dipped the table bread in it. In fact, I started to drink from the bowl[2]. The staff noticed, and someone came by to offer me a spoon (hilarious since I already had one). Moments later, they came back with a straw. Yes, a straw.

That&#39;s top-notch service, and it was a packed house.

Convivial atmosphere, yet dim enough for a romantic rendezvous. I know I&#39;ll be back with a date, but I&#39;ll try not to drink from my bowl.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Wonderful. I strolled in around 11:00 on a Saturday, so shortly after opening and early as far as NYC brunches go. I was one of maybe three groups there, and the servers were more than happy to seat me anywhere I pleased. I opted for the Gravy Meatball Sliders, and was absolutely blown away when they came out no more than three or so minutes later. Unbelievable. Fast and friendly service within a quaint and beautiful atmosphere? That&#39;s a Star Granted easy breezy. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Sure, The Little Owl can command a bit of a premium, but when it comes to New York City I&#39;m down to pay $15.00 or so for brunch, which is exactly what my three sliders cost. There&#39;s value elsewhere on the little owl menu, but know that you&#39;ll be able to get in and out without having to sell your wares to stockpile enough cash. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Wow. Mom? Mom I&#39;m so sorry, but these meatballs competed with yours, and I honestly never thought I would say that. Piping hot and flavorful, the meatballs were fitted within flavorful rolls that may have even had some sort of cheese gratings on top? I can&#39;t say for certain what it was, but these were some solid sliders. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

The menu is broad and caters to a wide audience, the service and atmosphere are phenomenal, and the prices are reasonable. Yes. Star Granted."

This was where the exterior of where the Friends building was shot!  I was here a few years ago searching for this building along with another Friends TV fanatic.  How exciting it was to be sitting inside this building for dinner!  I was ecstatic!

I came here for dinner on a weeknight and right away could tell that this was a brunch place.  It screams cozy despite the high ceiling windows.  It&#39;s a little claustrophobic from where we sat but I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t have to wait long for a table since we didn&#39;t have a reservation.  This place is popular!  The staff did an incredible and efficient job servicing each table.  Empty plates were immediately taken away and waters were filled before your glass was empty.  The food is high quality and worth the extra splurge.

For appetizers, we shared the gravy meatball sliders ($15).  It&#39;s a small plate of 3 sliders with one meatball squeezed between the bread.  The sauce was amazing and had hints of a variety of fresh herbs.  The bottom layer of bread soaked up the sauce and was the best part!

For vegetable side dish, we shared the kale ($10).  It was crispy but a little tough to enjoy with its overpowering lemon flavor.  The natural flavor of the kale was completely masked.  I didn&#39;t like this dish.

For entrees, we had the Bell &amp; Evans Chicken on asparagus and home fries ($26) and the special Tautog Rockfish with mashed potatoes ($29).  I especially loved the chicken!  Who knew CHICKEN could taste THIS good!!?  The skin was crispy, meat was juicy, and the sauce packed a punch.  

For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Souffle Cake ($9) that came with a scoop of espresso gelato.  They were perfect complements!  Delicious and bold on their own and magical together!  The souffle had a brownie-like exterior with a hot, rich chocolate filling.  Amazing, especially for a chocolate lover like me!"

So this little (and I do mean &#34;little&#34;) West Village favorite was a bit of a turn-off when we first arrived. We were early and since they have no space for patrons to wait inside and apparently no liquor license (only wine) and therefore no real bar by which to lollygag, we were asked to wait outside in the cold. And not asked nicely either. So the night got off to a rough start.

But then the wine started flowing and the meatballs started coming, and things just got better, and better from there. So on to the food:

I really enjoyed my gnocchi but it actually wasn&#39;t my favorite (I prefer my gnocchi to have at least a little &#34;bite&#34; and this was way too soft to me). My friends also enjoyed their truffle risotto, LI duck, and seafood gumbo. 

The highlight of the evening, however, was my pork chop with butter beans and parmesan. Pork is always hit-or-miss, in my opinion, mostly depending on whether it&#39;s cooked perfectly or, more commonly, overcooked. This pork chop was perfection- probably the best I&#39;ve had in over a year. I could come back just for that one dish.

My friend&#39;s various fish dishes were solid but nothing very special. The other real stand-out, believe it or not, was the french fries which we ordered for the table. They were also perfect and special enough for their own shout-out...

We ate too much so we had to skip dessert, but I&#39;m happy the food for once rescued the evening. We&#39;ll definitely be back..."

It was cooked to perfection- it had a beautiful golden buttery brown outer layer that had just the right amount of crispness. The fish was firm but not too firm and melted in my mouth.

It&#39;s a very tight restaurant, I certainly wouldn&#39;t recommend if for more than groups of 4, you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re in the way.

The cocktail and wines by the glass list, is decent - though it doesn&#39;t appear that they stock a full bar. Which is no problem, just a heads up. I had a delicious glass of rose and red though, so I can&#39;t complain.

Their menu is fairly diverse, if small. I guess maybe my biggest complaint is that while the food was tasty and cooked well, it wasn&#39;t really memorable. Nothing stands out as over the top amazing. The chicken and brussels sprouts was cooked well, and the chicken wasn&#39;t dry, but I don&#39;t remember the potatoes. My dad had the meatball sliders and was pretty pleased with them. No one left hungry that&#39;s for sure.

I did order the panna cotta after for dessert and was disappointed it. It was more like a milky jello an less like a melt in your mouth panna cotta. 

All in all, it&#39;s in an adorable nieghborhood and is probably really great for a romantic night of small plates. I wouldn&#39;t go with a group, and that&#39;s my mistake. But I do wish the food had been out of this world."

Things have changed.  The Bank Street heiress that originally poked me into the nooks and crannies of this part of town is long gone (I checked) not ever to be found by me again.  Chumley&#39;s wall fell down and the new neighbors would prefer to not see it resurrected.  There was a television show filmed with the Little Owl building and I was away but people still pay a homage like it&#39;s a mecca or something.

But largely, if I fuzz my eyes and get a little nostalgic - a lot looks like it did when I left it.

So I checked and the NYT article heralding the beginnings of the Little Owl said it opened its doors in 2006.  The wall fell down in Chumley&#39;s in 2007.  I wondered as I researched if it fell from pique, or from sadness.  Plaster, heavy with a bitter history&#39;s tears ...

So they&#39;ve been here for nine years.  Inside, it feels they could have existed from the beginning of time.  Everything fit so perfectly.  I didn&#39;t count, but there are maybe a dozen tables in the cozy dining room (so cozy they were able to light our votive without us even noticing).  Half were filled on the Monday evening, arriving early to account for not having a reservation.  They were all filled with a few waiting upon the departure an hour or so later.  Pleasant murmur of customers and small kitchen sounds made it even warmer.  For me, ambiance perfect.

I wish I could tell you what we had to eat.  Fish dishes, I think.  Two appetizers split, bread.  I really must get better at remembering details such as these, for as that&#39;s the commercial purpose of these reviews, after all, not just a blank page for the memories.

Sorry.  I don&#39;t remember the gastro-details.  I do remember and will remember for a long time that the total experience was truly perfect.  From the traipse through the neighborhood to the front door and its hello, to the inside and then to what was inside me by the end of the evening.  Lovely, lovely, lovely.  I will be absolutely back.  I will bring friends, family and loved ones.

I&#39;ve been meaning to try their brunch, but I figured I&#39;d try it for lunch and see how it goes. I came for lunch with a friend, and split their Gravy Sliders, the cod, the crispy hen and the side of green beans.

Upon ordering the sliders (on the menu, they&#39;re sold for lunch by each slider), we asked for 2, but the server told us they only sold them in orders of 3. So we went with 3, but slightly bothered as we had to split the last one.

The food was overall pretty good - the proteins all cooked well with balanced flavors. The portions were on the smaller size, but filled us up with everything we ordered.  I really liked how soft the cod was. The sliders were good - meatballs were juicy, gravy complemented it well and the bread held it together but was soft as well.

Service was iffy - our server was particularly rude to us, slamming down the dessert menu when she arrived to
 clean our tables. Someone came to refill my water glass while I just picked up my glass. 

The part that got to us was when my friend and I looked around to neighboring tables and saw plates of only 2 sliders. Why were we the only ones forced to order in 3s? My friend asked the manager about this and he said that during lunch, they sell them by singles, and dinner, they&#39;re sold in minimum orders of 3. He apologized to us for the mistake and claimed that our server normally only works dinner shifts. However, our server came to remedy the situation (she took off the sliders off our tab entirely, which was nice), but she seemed to do so begrudingly and even her apology sounded snarky. 

Overall, the food was good, and I&#39;d really like to return as their brunch menu sounds great, but I was pretty upset by their service of that one server."

Depending on when you go, the menu itself might not be too extensive.  For example, I took a friend there on a Saturday afternoon and was told that they have NEITHER their full lunch or brunch menu available.  Instead, we were given a small slapped-together list of some lunch and some brunch items.  While we were contemplating which of the appetizer-sized meals we wanted to stave off our hunger, the hostess appeared to grow impatient and came to take our order herself after we told a waiter we needed a few more minutes.  Look, I get it - the place is tiny and there were a lot of other people waiting.  But we waited our fair share of time to be seated and was simply trying to get over the nasty surprise of a limited menu ..which by the way, is not mentioned on their website or yelp page, for that matter.  

The place gets packed, but does exude warmth and coziness depending on the company of strangers around you.  To be honest, you&#39;re more likely to bump into tourists trying to take pictures of every single corner of the restaurant (inside and out - thanks to Friends) rather than casual diners trying to enjoy low key vibes.  

I went the first time for the experience and went back again to give the place a second chance.  Unfortunately, I doubt I&#39;d be going back again a third time anytime soon."

As a regular here, I&#39;ll start by saying that I&#39;m quite frankly unsure how The Little Owl hasn&#39;t won a Michelin star yet.  The menu (which is seasonal) is loaded with a number of highly revered items, with the meatball sliders, asparagus risotto, and the pork chop the consistent favorites.  The gnocchi (which is usually on their winter menu) will not disappoint either.  The wine list is quite extensive, with a cocktail list that expertly plays of the cuisine and vibe (that said, get the winter sangria).  With that said, the menu is only half of The Little Owl experience.  The space is very intimate and cozy (holding maybe 35 patrons at most), with a usually youthful and upscale crowd.  From the street, the space gives off a picturesque magical, warm, and highly inviting glow that almost makes you forget your&#39;re in Manhattan.

This is also only of the most coveted restaurants in the West Village, so expect to pay for the experience.  With that said, if you&#39;re looking for a spot to impress a special someone or simply need a place to celebrate an occasion, The Little Owl is highly recommended."

We were hungry and ready to eat good food so we came in here. We were lucky because the party that was supposed to be seated did not show. We quickly got seats at the bar.

The place is so small and nicely decorated. The kitchen was right next to the bar so you can smell every thing. We ordered the specials which were the french toast and meatball sliders with espresso and iced tea.

The food came out quick and we were a bit surprised on how little food was on our plates. There was one slice of french toast and 3 meatball sliders. Sliders I can understand, 3, but one little piece of french toast? Bread is not expensive.

French toast tasted good, not too buttery, not too sweet. For me there should be at least 3-4 slices on my plate. Even then it wouldn&#39;t have been enough to make a meal. 

Meatballs were a disappointment. My date could make the same or better. My father definitely makes better tasting meatballs. The sauce was so so but the buns were freshly baked so they were good.

I could eat both of the orders and still not be full or satisfied. Needless to say, we left hungry. Nothing else appealed to us from the menu.

The service was good, prices too high for the amount of food, and we walked out smelling like the food."

This is a must visit restaurant with high quality food. The portions are small but more than enough.  Due to its size it must be hard to get a table so come with a reservation or before common meal times. 

Don&#39;t leave without a cocktail, all so delicious and have fresh muddled fruits and juices"

First time I ordered the Halibut dinner which was EXCELLENT.  I returned and ordered the same thing; smaller portion, fish was not particularly warm and was rather dry.  Simply not as tasty the second time.  As for service, the first time I sat at the four person bar and was treated nicely by the attendant.  On my second visit I came to see that was what the host wants a solo diner to do.  The second time I chose a table and was ignored.   A woman near me, waiting for friends, was asked by the host after only five minutes, if she knew where her friends were BECAUSE the table was reserved for two hours from now.  I am only guessing, but suspect that the host wants two persons at the table where I was only one.  (i.e. he wanted me at the bar?)  So, my recommendation for dinner for a single woman would be sort of a question mark.  I won&#39;t go back for dinner.

On the other hand, the young woman working that same day for breakfast was attentive and marvelous.  I had gone to another nearby place for breakfast, stopped by the Little Owl to check on my reservation.  She was delightful, offered me a complimentary cup of coffee, and could not have been more pleasant."

You can&#39;t go wrong here as the food is cooked perfectly - great flavours with pretty generous portions and a fair price. Only drawback is how tiny the restaurant is - like you literally bump into a server or another diner at least a few times during your meal. I am always amazed at how so many small NYC restaurants pump out so much good food in a tiny space!

The complimentary bread was dry and tough and some items leaned on the more well seasoned side. But that&#39;s it for drawbacks. 

The crab cake special $18 was all real crab and large enough to share. The crab was so sweet and fresh.  I ordered the bell and Evans chicken $26 which is a half chicken deboned and flattened and pan seared till the skin is super crispy and comes with asparagus, potatoes, sherry and Dijon sauce. Omg this is hands down one of he best chicken dishes I&#39;ve ever had. Chicken is boring unless you can make it crispy outside and super juicy and flavourful inside. They have achieved that. I would order this again!

The honey BBQ lamb chops $36 with spinach and fingerling potato salad was another hit. Thought this would be a more traditional BBQ dish but it wasn&#39;t. Not overly saucy but just a twinge of sweetness. 3 large chops that were cooked on the rare to med rare side. 

Food service was pretty fast and everyone was warm and friendly. Just make sure you make reservations ahead of time unless you want to wait outside and watch all the passerby take picture of the building, which apparently was used in exterior shots of &#34;Friends.&#34;"

We were celebrating our one year wedding anniversary! They gave us complimentary prosecco, which was a thoughtful and delightful touch! The staff was very friendly and made you feel like an old friend. We tarted with the meatball sliders which were good! They reminded me of my grandmas meatloaf. I felt it was a little salty, but nothing crazy. We shared the spinach and strawberry risotto for a side. It was Delish!! My husband had the well reviewed pork chop and it did not disappoint. I had the halibut! For dessert we had beignets. They were average, nothing special.Overall great meal and wonderful service and staff!"

If you have never been in the New York City, this will be a good place to hang around with locals. However for me, I would prefer somewhere with a bit more room. We visited without a reservation so we ended up being tucked into the corner. After the meal, we were basically blocked in and couldn&#39;t get out. The owner and the waitress noticed this but rather than getting involved, they decided to look away. Food is good, though."

Overall a great dining experience. We started with the meatball sliders based on the rave reviews. They were good, but I think I had built them up so much they didn&#39;t quite meet my expectations- sauce and bread were great but I thought the meat was a little overdone. I had the halibut for my main and it was very good- nice pesto flavor that fell apart in my mouth. Best part of the meal by far was dessert- we shared the strawberry rhubarb crisp with mascarpone ice cream and it was unreal. Definitely recommend!"

Love love love that show, so of course I had to eat at this iconic location. And I&#39;m happy to say that I was very pleasantly surprised!

We came here for brunch on a Saturday morning - just me and the BF. Our reservation was for 30 minutes after they open, because I fully expected them to be completely overbooked. Surprisingly, they were only half booked up and we were seated right away. With coffee and waters instantly on the table (and I love the fact that they give you sugar cubes in little lidded jars), we gave our meal selections to the friendly waiter. 

I was glad to see a lot of healthy (well, at least healthy-sounding/looking) options on their menu. Beets, chicken breast and brussels sprouts, salads and eggs etc. I opted for the poached organic eggs, sausage, greens, biscuit, and hollandaise - yup, you guessed it - their eggs benedict. Just delicious! a little bit of a thicker biscuit than I liked, but I actually enjoyed the meal without eating the second biscuit and I was still plenty full! The BF opted for their spinach omelet - a special of the day - and was pleasantly surprised at the flavoring of such a healthy dish.

Drawbacks - the extremely tiny bathroom. and just the one bathroom. Also, lots of people stopping outside and across the street taking photos, and with the high vaulted ceilings and windows, it can get quite distracting. And I&#39;m sure that if you dont make a reservation during peak hours, you&#39;ll be waiting quite a while - the whole place looks like it doesn&#39;t seat any more than 30 people! Still you&#39;ll enjoy your brunch here at the Little Owl."

The tables are really packed and there was a long wait for the weekend brunch. While the food was good, it wasn&#39;t stellar in anyway, so the combination of that with the long wait time and cramped environment makes for a 3-star experience"

Get a reservation before you go for sure because it&#39;s small. We had the halibut, chicken &amp; grilled fish special which was amazing! Flavoring was excellent. My family that came with me had the pork &amp; steak. The pork was delicious &amp; the steak was good but a little tough. When we mention it to our waiter, he rudely assumed we wanted it taken off our bill. My sister in law had eaten it anyway, but as a courtesy felt it necessary to share because everything else was fabulous. The waiter was very condescending in his tone even going back to the kitchen to tell the staff only to have them stare &amp; laugh at us (you are able to see in through the kitchen because of a large window that separates the kitchen from the dining area). I can tell you that while the food was delicious, i wouldn&#39;t return because of the poor customer service. There are too many good restaurants out there to waste out time with unprofessionalism.

Cutest little restaurant close to the beautifully quaint soho area.

Don&#39;t skip the little owl red--bottled exclusively for them in Sicily.  Very spicy, with a mild tang at the end.

Don&#39;t regret your life decisions by not getting the crispy chicken.  I don&#39;t like chicken skin.  I ate every follicle-inch.

Don&#39;t try something new and glass over the gravy meatball sliders, please...I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve had such a perfect meatball that hits all of my criteria for a good meatball: size, texture, fall-apartness, and the creme de la creme meatball packed flavors.

They have a nice wine list - bottles or by the glass. We went with the Tempranillo for $64. It poured 8 glasses.  I highly recommend the meatball sliders starter and eggplant parm side.   Also really enjoyed the green beans which had a little spicy kick to them.  We each ate different entrees which all looked and smelled and tasted delicious: crispy cod, halibut, chicken and strip steak.  Worth a visit!  Or try their sister restaurants Market Table and Clam"

We were searching for brunch places in NYC all morning and finally came across this and decided to try it. We were not disappointed!! 

As we got off the subway, we walked past many brunch places with huge lines outside of people waiting but there was not a wait outside of the Little Owl. One of my favorite parts of the place is just how cute it is. There is limited seating but that makes it cozy and the absolute perfect place for a cute brunch. 

We got delicious brioche pancakes to share with strawberries and I ordered the special of the day which was scrambled eggs with smoked salmon. It came with a piece of toast that was perfect to put the eggs on top of. My friend got the bacon cheeseburger that he raved about. 

Most of all, I really loved this place because of how perfect it was for brunch on a Sunday morning. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a brunch place in NYC - I also LOVE the west village so it was so fun to walk around the area."

Well, it definitely did not disappoint!  The space is very minimal, but almost feels like a greenhouse the way the massive windows flood the floor with light.  It is a wonderful place for a nice spring evening meal.

The food and service were both top notch.  Yes, the food is expensive and the portions are not massive, but the quality of the food is second to none.

My sister was in town visiting so I wanted to take her to a great place in the west village. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have reservations so I was worried getting a table at this popular restaurant would be down right impossible. I decided we should try our luck anyway. We came in around 915 and were seated within five minutes. The place was very full but we got lucky with a canceled reservation. 

We ordered the risotto and brussel sprouts to start followed by the chefs cheese plate. The risotto was the single best thing I&#39;ve put in my mouth in a while. It came with an egg yolk cracked in top of it which added a subtle richness to the dish. The brussel sports were good but nothing super fantastic. But that cheese plate man.. Wow. Great portions of delicious and interesting cheese. Color me impressed. 

I ordered the halibut with chive mashed potatoes for my entree and my sister ordered the New York steak with parpadelle. Both were cooked to perfection and extremely flavorful. This is what good food tastes like. It&#39;s amazing the quality of food the chefs turn out of such a small kitchen. 

The restaurant has a small intimate feel that would be perfect for a romantic date. Keep in mind that this restaurant is literally the size of my living room so you are definitely up close and person with your neighbors. The Little Owl is such a gem in the over saturated sea of manhattan fine dining. I will definitely be back!"

Such a cute little French place, dim lit tucked away in a little side alley street of West Village. I didn&#39;t even review the menu (surprise surprise) and am so pleased I didn&#39;t! The staff was so sweet to us as soon as we got there and let my boyfriend and I switch tables because we were cold and wanted a booth. We ended up having the coziest little booth in the corner overlooking the whole restaurant. It&#39;s so small and quaint, the food is so beyond delicious. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about my meal all day.

We got the meatball sliders (amazing)
CHIVE mashed potatoes - delicious but it was GREEN, so odd.. but still great
then I got the steak with mushroom papparadelle and my boyfriend got the crispy chicken with Brussels
both were so so good, we ended up sharing quite a lot of it. Along with the cauliflower, red peppers and Brussels sprouts appetizer.

The only thing that was slightly annoying was that our reservation was at 10:15 and we didn&#39;t get seated in the booth (that I requested) until 10:45 or so. Then after we started eating our entrees we realized that everyone slowly started clearing out the restaurant. My boyfriend felt anxious that we were going to get kicked out because they were literally taking down all the candles and moving the chairs to the side... (how awkward).

I was pretty much finished anyway but just annoying they booked us into a table so late and then began closing the restaurant down while we were still eating. Isn&#39;t this New York? Since when do restaurants close that early or isn&#39;t it a rule to close only after everyone is well finished eating?

The cozy and charming space set an intimate environment in which to enjoy the deservedly-praised meatball sliders, the tender lamb chops and the flavorful pork chop. We were worried about the wine selection because of the lack of a wine list on the website, but we had many options from which to choose and ended up with a wonderful Southern Rhone with the help of the wonderful sommelier.

Although it wasn&#39;t anything mind-blowing, brunch was definitely excellent. Friend and I split: Nutella and Raspberry Beignettes, Avocado Chilaquiles, Bibb &amp; Beets squash with pumpkin seeds and parmesan cheese, Brussel Sprout Home Fries with curry leeks, pear puree bellini, and pink prosecco lemonade. The cocktails, were some of the best brunch cocktails I&#39;ve ever had--classic and refreshing and just slightly unique. Of course, the beignettes are a must-have. It is their signature appetizer and there is no surprise why. Doughnut is SO soft and so evenly fried. The outside is just ever so slightly crispy and the sugar bits are very fine. The raspberry filling inside is devine: sweet but not chemical-y at all. I would advise against the chilaquiles as it was nothing special but recommend the two sides. Unlike some other new american places, The Little Owl definitely stays on the healthier side so dishes are not drowning in oil, in fact even brussel sprouts seemed more sauteed or steamed than anything. I would definitely recommend checking out The Little Owl is you haven&#39;t already. Seating is limited and tight but there is great natural lighting and tall floor to ceiling windows."

First of all, it was freezing inside. Despite having 3 barriers between the inside and the outside, there was a constant draft and I had to keep my winter parka on through the entire meal.

We ordered the risotto and french fries to start. The risotto was a bitter disappointment. The flavor was good, but the texture was completely off. The rice was cooked to an al dente and the dish was on the watery side. The french fries and dipping sauce were good, but not worth the $11.

For our entrees, we ordered the pork chop and the sea bass (special). The sea bass was quite delicious and cooked perfectly, but the pork chop was overcooked and dry.

Despite the inconsistencies in the meal, the service was great and everybody who checked on us were very kind and helpful.

THE STORY: The Little Owl is little. But the compact, 30-seat space is by no means wanting for flavor, hospitality, or style. For appetizers, the Eggplant Parm with herb marinated tomato salad hits the perfect balance of light, yet sumptuously warm flavor, while the Ricotta Cavatelli with kale pesto are rich, creamy and melty bites of comfort. My date and I told our waitress that we were splitting the appetizers, and the kitchen even split the portions for us on two plates, a special touch truly reflective of the thoughtfulness inherent in the restaurant.

The entrees themselves were nearly perfectly cooked, particularly the dense Broiled Halibut resting on a bed of corn, peas, and sprouts, served with a warm pesto vinaigrette. Yet the Pork Chop with butter beans is undoubtedly the star of the menu, cut into massive, juicy portions and seasoned with a rich balance of spices that include cayenne and cumin.

We finished our meal with a local cheese plate that our waitress lovingly guided us through, making sure we didn&#39;t miss out on any bite. We left full and passionately invested in the nicety of the space, because somehow between the large windows and smiling, earnest demeanor of the service, a dinner at The Little Owl feels like coming home."

Their floor to ceiling windows are a perfect way to create a really nice bright dining experience with lots of natural light inside. I am a fan of their meatball sliders and whole wheat pancakes. I also got to try the poached eggs.

I had the whole wheat pancakes and it is the best whole wheat pancake I&#39;ve ever had. I wouldn&#39;t consider it the best pancake overall, but this place makes a good whole wheat one if that&#39;s what you&#39;re in the mood for. Fluffy, moist, airy where the syrup soaks right through - where it makes you happy cutting through the pancake with your fork and seeing the syrup ooze between the layers (in your mind, you go &#39;yes!&#39;). You notice the grainy texture of whole wheat but that doesn&#39;t take away from the flavor or experience at all. You might actually appreciate it if you wanted to try something different than a regular pancake. The fresh berries and syrup added just the right touch. The corners of the pancakes had more of a bite, which I appreciated because it just meant another difference in the texture. A bigger party in my mouth.  

My bf had the poached eggs. The poached eggs were cooked well and sat on top of a tastey sausage pattie and a buttery rich biscuit. I wasn&#39;t in the mood for a rich dish, but it was good!

Meatball sliders are delicious! Just get it. Perfect saltiness and tenderness to the meat. Neither the meat or the sauce outshined each other - it was a perfect pair/portion. The bread also had a perfect saltiness to it because they sprinkle parmesan cheese on top before baking it. The mini buns hold well to the saucy meatballs. Why does that sentence sound so wrong? Lol

Make reservations to avoid a long wait. Quaint village neighborhood."

The standout of the meal was honestly probably the beignettes, which surprised me. I was reluctant to order them since they seemed so simple at first glance, but they turned out to be unlike anything I&#39;ve tried before. these balls of fried dough were light, not greasy, piping hot, and fluffy. The raspberry jam was fragrant, and the Nutella underneath was the perfect compliment. Recommend!

Another thing to note is that the &#34;gravy&#34; on the sliders isn&#39;t heavy brown goop, but instead more like a tomato sauce. I was slightly disappointed because the sliders came cold and the &#34;gravy&#34; was dry and pasty, but the flavors were undeniably amazing and I cant imagine what it would have been like hot. 

One problem with this place is that it&#39;s little-- like really little. My friend and I ended up brunching elbow-to-elbow with another couple, and it was a bit uncomfortable that both of us could heard every word of eachother&#39;s conversations."

Beware, you&#39;ll have mobs of fans snapping photos of you through the windows. Nonetheless, this little restaurant packs a punch for being a place that seats under 30 people. Here&#39;s a tip though, get here RIGHT when it opens if you don&#39;t have a reservation. It&#39;s a good place!"

If I were to rate the food all by itself, I&#39;d give this place five stars. It&#39;s unfortunately the service that really put me off. 

When we got our coffee, I had asked if there was a chance I could get a pinch of cinnamon. To which I was told that there&#39;s absolutely no cinnamon in the kitchen. Ok. Then I overheard someone asking for almond milk and she received a similar response. 

It was tough to get a servers attention. In fact, we kept trying to flag someone down to order a second round of mimosa&#39;s and coffee, with no luck. instead, a server stopped by to give us the check -- that&#39;s when we finally had the chance to order. It&#39;s worth noting that we never even signaled for the check to begin with. 

The food itself was spectacular. Pancakes are amazing, beignets are fantastic and the mimosa&#39;s are killer. 

Come for the food, just don&#39;t expect attentive service."

I was visiting NYC fort boyfriends graduation and had several &#34;Must Try&#34; places. Little Owl was the first on my list so we decided to eat lunch here on the first day.

When we arrived we had reservations made so we were quickly seated. The seating arrangement was difficult- literally everyone on the side of the bar was a couple of inches away from each other. Any person attempting to sit there hit the two small round tables behind them and the window seat look awkwardly close as well. It&#39;s Manhattan so i didn&#39;t care too much about the tight space though.

I ordered the Artic Char while my boyfriend ordered the Bacon Burger which was greatly recommended by our waiter. The Char was cooked incredibly; the chef truly mastered it - but although it was soft and tender the taste was mediocre. Nothing stood out to me. If anything I felt that the fish should have been separated from the vegetables. The bacon burger also fell short of our expectations. My boyfriend enjoyed the meal but felt that it didn&#39;t blow his mind and the proportion was adequate. 

The dining experience was good with attentive service but when I return to NYC, I won&#39;t be returning to little owl."

This spot has been on our wish list forever, and somehow serendipity granted us a very early table on a fall-like Friday night.  It took us awhile to understand why shutter-happy tourists shuffled to and fro along the sidewalk across from Little Owl, taking quick shots and selfies in our direction...we had nearly convinced ourselves that either I or my wife was a spitting image of a hot celebrity when we learned that the restaurant was featured in a long ago episode of Friends.  

Every dish here was an A+, and virtually every dish we didn&#39;t try piqued our interest for a future visit.  As a starter, we devoured the silky, subtly-flavored, bright green basil gnocchi.  The light tomato sauce with slow-cooked pork belly made this a real masterpiece.   Alongside the gnocchi we enjoyed an arugula and strawberry salad, a thin toast with melted robiola cheese perched on top.  The strawberries and the balsamic fig dressing were well-matched to the spicy arugula and the pungent cheese.  

For our entree, we shared the broiled halibut with corn, peas, and pesto vinaigrette.  It&#39;s hard to imagine a fresher or more perfectly cooked piece of fish, and the Parmesan in the pesto browned and solidified in the broiler, creating a lovely, semi-crisp crown for the moist white fish.  We chose two vegetable sides (out of a uniformly delectable roster of options).  The grilled roasted corn, doused with spicy mayo and flecked with chili peppers and other robust spices, was the hands-down winner.  The blistered green beans - finished with sesame seeds, cilantro, and a piquant oyster sauce - were also fabulous.   

We somehow passed on the array of homemade desserts on offer, but we aren&#39;t too concerned - I have a feeling we&#39;ll be back to Little Owl before too long."

When we ordered the famed meatball sliders, they asked if we wanted to order extra sliders.  Odd question, right? I&#39;ve never heard &#39;Would you like a side of your brunch entree, in addition to your main entree?&#39;.  When we were served, it became clear why they asked - I am no crazed hunger monster, but the entrees are more like appetizers for sharing. The taste was not bad, but eh rather dull and certainly did not live up to the hype."

Also you get to sit on a platform towering above all the other patrons while you wait so you can see what everyone is eating. Pretty cool. You can peer into the rustic kitchen through windows. Decor is very cute in here with many owl-related objects. 

For an appetizer we ordered the mini kale and potato frittati. Honestly the best part of the meal, and they had a bit of salmon on top. I could&#39;ve ordered two of those. 

For main, I had the fish tacos and seasoned fries. The fish tacos were amazing. Just a shame that the portions were small (only two tiny ones) and the tacos were too thin so everything fell through. I was relegated to eating tacos with a fork. It was a sad day indeed. I&#39;m glad the fries filled me up; the sauce had just the right amount of kick to it. 

We ordered beignets for dessert. I don&#39;t see how anyone can finish a whole one by themselves. They&#39;re super sweet. So I recommend eating just half of one unless you have a real sweet tooth."

Started with the meatball sliders and scallop risotto. Meatballs were so flavorful and served up on soft little slider buns. I could have ate an entire bowl of the scallop risotto. When we told the waitress that we wanted to share the apps and entrees, I liked that they split them out on the two separate plates to make it easier. Didn&#39;t love the steak, for medium rare, it was certainly over cooked, the parpardelle pasta it was served with was under seasoned, not much flavor. The black cod special was the highlight for me, served in a tomato like broth with other shellfish. 

I would go back to try the brunch."

The hot plates are a great deal at ~ $10 per plate that comes with a creative array of carbs, proteins and vegetables. Each dish has some thought and care put into its preparation. The salmon plate specifically is pretty good if you have an extra 5 minutes to wait for them to grill it fresh. The Moroccan-style couscous and the short ribs are also solid choices.

Value-wise, the place is a tad more expensive than a halal cart lunch/dinner but the quality of the ingredients, the variety of the plates, and the freshly prepared dishes make the couple extra dollars worth it. 

The ambience and feel of the place is a discordant with the quality of the food as the decor and layout reflects a more bodega-like quality. 

The service is quick but still friendly, nailing that combination that&#39;s hard to come by in NYC.

Great place to grab a quick bite to either stand and eat or to grab-and-go."

It might look like &#34;just another deli&#34; from the small storefront, but what deli has workers that will knead dough and throw it into the tandoori oven to make you fresh fluffy naan (pita?) on-the-spot to go with your entree? Whip out freshly marinated salmon and throw it onto the grill? Has delicious melt-in-your-mouth short ribs to go with your roasted brussels sprouts? And for only $10?!

Personally, I think the hot plate entrees are the best deal since you get generous portions of your protein/sides, while still getting the fresh naan on the side. The sandwiches are similarly priced, but come with a drink and a bag of chips. Admittedly, I haven&#39;t had a chance to try the salads, but the toppings in the salad bar always look very fresh and would be something I&#39;d like to try next time.

The service is warm and friendly. You can tell that they&#39;ve poured a lot of heart into this endeavor. They&#39;re a local joint and use names of nearby places and streets for the different creative sandwiches on the menu (i.e. the &#34;Long Island City&#34; sandwich, which has juicy tomatillo chicken thigh meat, goat cheese, brussels sprouts). The rustic ciabatta bread is pretty darned good and crusty, but oh that fresh naan is so delicious! 

What I appreciate most is that while they&#39;ve clearly spent a great deal of time and effort to make the place look neat and professional, it bears no semblance to that ubiquitous sterile veneer of corporate efficiency that has become so prevalent. These people go out of their way to make sure you&#39;re satisfied in a way that I&#39;m not used to, but thoroughly enjoy.

I&#39;m lucky enough to live around the corner and I hope that they succeed. I&#39;ve seen several restaurants come and go, and these guys really deserve to stay. Give them a shot, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll walk away pleasantly surprised by the little place, just like me."

It has brick walls on one side with a full bar and a semi-open kitchen behind it. The wait staff were friendly and chilled. Now the food... 

- clam chowder: it was ok. It&#39;s more watery and less complex than I expected. It does have nice fresh clams. 
- lobster and clam slider: this is the best dish of the restaurant. The lobster was done perfectly -- fresh, not drowned with mayonnaise, not too chewy and buttery. The crunchy fried clams were delicious and goes well with the lobster. The break was toasted with nice thin layer of crunchiness. 
- stuffed clams: they were ok. It destroyed the clam taste for me. 
- Sriracha roasted Brussel sprouts with bacon: everything goes well with bacon and Sriracha :) 
- clam spaghetti: homemade pasta with bits of clams in the sauce. My second favorite dish
- clam pizza: a bit dried for me

This place has weird music though. They were playing 80s love songs, Jason Mraz, and then some jazz.

We had:

- Clam Dip with Chips- very tasty, the highlight of our meal

- Parker House Rolls - Average, they were a bit too firm 

- Clam Pizza - very bland, I had to ask for extra salt because I used up all that was on the table

- Swordfish - very bland, no punch

- Brussel Sprouts - very tasty

Onto the food: Lobster raviolo filling was bland. Long island steamers were a mixed bag of good and gritty - at least melted butter makes everything taste better! Burrata was average.

Came here on a friend&#39;s birthday dinner, and were seated promptly at a four-top by the door.  I appreciate the fact that most tables were set at a good distance apart so that you are not sitting on top of each other.  The drinks were delicious, particularly their special of the day, which was a banana pina colada.  I normally hate sweet drinks, but this one had the perfect amount of sweetness and creaminess.  The food were hit or miss depending on the dish, see below for details:

Angus Beef Carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes of the night, the ramps and dijion truly complemented the carpaccio well.  The flavor of this dish was robust, and the beef was just thin enough to provide a good texture, but not too thick that it is too chewy

Brooklyn Burrata &amp; Local Grapes - another good dish, the grapes provided a hint of sweetness that paired well with the onions.  The burrata was great, although, I&#39;ve never met a burrata that I didn&#39;t like.

Dozen Oysters - I can&#39;t remember the mixture of oysters we had, none really stood out.  

Fried clam &amp; Lobster sliders - an average dish, the fried clam was bland, and  I could barely taste the lobster, which were cut into really small pieces.  The only taste that stood out were the bun and the breading of the clam. 

Soft Shell Crabs - a below average dish, similar issue with the clam, the breading was way too thick and lacked in flavor.  The only redeeming quality of this dish was the accompanied asparagus, which had a really delicious sauce on top.

Ginger Bread IC Sandwich - this was the table&#39;s favorite, but I personally thought the ginger cookie was too sweet, and I couldn&#39;t really discern the mascarpone flavor in the gelato.

86 Proof Chocolate Icebox Cake - ironically I was the only one at the table who liked this dessert.  My friends didn&#39;t appreciate the strong taste of bourbon, but I liked it.  I also love the richness of the chocolate and the creaminess of the espresso chantilly (which sounded really fancy).

Service was impeccable, our water never dipped below the half way point.  They didn&#39;t try to rush us even though it was a Sat night, and divided our entrees into equal portion when we informed them that we were sharing.  The ambiance is extremely romantic, definitely a great place to go for a date night."

The clam dip, the lobster and fried clam sliders and the spaghetti. Oh my god, the spaghetti. The food here is fan-freaking-tastic.

You can walk in w/o reservation.

Was hoping to try their wonderful grilled fish from last time, but wasn&#39;t available today.
I think they change their menu for main courses often; Didn&#39;t recognize most of them from last time.

Tried:
1/2 dozen oysters (East &amp; West)- Very fresh
Chilled 1/2 lobster- Excellent. Comes with a nice, spicy sauce.
Fluke crudo- Excellent
Baked clams- Yum. Highly recommend. 
Also, tried their signature ginger bread/buttermilk gelato sandwich- Loved it.

So many dishes that I wanted to try (ie. clam pizza, clam pasta, etc.) = will be back soon.

Excellent service, as before.

Highly recommend.

I can&#39;t deny that the Clam definitely had an enticing menu and offered some great selections, it&#39;s just that the service left us pretty disappointed and some of the things we ordered were okay. 

Saturday night I came with a group of friends. This was our first time dining here so we had questions about the menu; food portions, what&#39;s best to share, recommendations on what entrees to chose from, etc. When we were originally seated there was a sweet girl who took our drink orders and was super enthusiastic! However, our waitor who was to take our dinner order was much the opposite. Anytime we asked him a question it seemed like he was just giving us blank stares and delayed responses with a bare minimum response. Answering us with phrases like &#34;I think so&#34; is not sufficient. 

Aside from the mediocre service, the food was decent. Nothing I would write home about, but I did enjoy it. We ordered the east side and west side oysters along with clam dip for starters. Both of which were good. The chips that came with the clam dip were a little too salty for my liking however. We also ordered the clam chowder which was super underwhelming. Living in the northeast you expect clam chowder to be thick, creamy, and loaded with potatoes. The clam chowder here was on the watery side. Being the foodie I am I don&#39;t mind spending $, but $15 for watery clam chowder? No thanks! 

Also my final bone to pick with the clam is who the hell chargers for their bread/ bread rolls? Apparently it&#39;s a new policy they&#39;ve implemented. 

My favorite thing here was the clam spaghetti. It&#39;s under &#34;house specials&#34; on the menu and it was delicious. I wish I could give this place 4 stars just because of the spaghetti, but given the overall picture I&#39;ll stick to 3."

But I decided today was the day I would take it out of the friend zone. Turns out, it&#39;s a pretty decent meal. 

The clam pizza, risotto balls, and lobster raviolo were the table&#39;s favorite appetizers. I did not think the clam dip lived up to the hype, but rather tasted like a cold, tasteless mush of clams. After deciding that I&#39;ve had enough of ordering salmon everywhere I went, I tried the Sautéed Skate wing. It was a beautiful and fresh filet of a generous size. The fish was lightly floured to create a slight crisp, and the texture of the fish was perfectly tender. For the side dishes, I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t not mention the carrots. If carrots were this tasty when I was a kid, I probably wouldn&#39;t have secretly slid them onto other people&#39;s plate to avoid eating them so much. I also thoroughly enjoyed the green beans, dressed with feta and almonds. The kale was simple and sautéed, but still held its own. 

Despite being overwhelmingly full, it doesn&#39;t feel like a complete meal until you&#39;ve ordered all the desserts (that&#39;s normal, right?) Out of the peach and blueberry crostata, the bourbon ice box, and ginger ice cream sandwich, we liked the homemade marscapone gelato the most. The buttermilk ice cream tastes exactly how it sounded--which was bland. (though the ginger ice cream was my favorite, no one else in the table shared that sentiment)."

We ordered a bunch of apps.  I personally am not a fan of their clam dip, but their rolls are warm and hearty and their raw oysters and clams are fresh! 

We ordered the clam pizza to share, the clam pasta, and lobster rolls.  The brilliant thing they did was make each of us a plate of a lobster roll and pasta so we didn&#39;t have to pass it around. They also hooked us up with sides of green beans, which were actually delicious. 

Their homemade ice cream was creamy and their sorbets were super refreshing. They also precut the ice cream sandwich for us too.  

An extra star for great service for our big group."

Came here on a Saturday night with a girlfriend and no reservations, but were seated within 15 minutes!  Great place for a date - there were tons of couples here and the vibe was romantic with white table cloths, candles and dim lighting.  Only about 6 spots at the bar but if you score one, the seats look very comfortable!

Once you are seated they come by with some bread and salt served warm and tasted great when dipped in the little bowl of salt !!!  We started with 6 oysters ($3.50 ea) and the ceviche with tortilla chips.  Loved the oysters and the ceviche was a pretty good portion with big chunks of avocado and shrimp in there.  

Next, we ordered the stuffed clams (since there were lots of reviews), the salmon, and the asparagus.  The stuffed clams were SUPER fresh and not overwhelmed with breadding, they were SO tasty.  The salmon was cooked perfectly with cauliflour and onions, the restaurant even split the dish in two for us which was amazing, not many restaurants will do this for you.  

For desert we tried the ICEBOX cake - omg SO delicious it had a shot of bourbon in it with chocolate cake yummm.  Recommended by the waiter and it did not disappoint.  

I would 100% recommend the clam, especially for a date night.  A little expensive but nothing more than the usual prices in Manhattan.  Next time I am ordering the sliders because they looked outstanding !!"

Service was good, ambiance was good except for the noise level of one table having drinks--it was refreshingly quiet after they left.
The rice balls were crunchy and good, with an onion sauce. The corn appetizer was packed with flavor--one of the best corn dishes I&#39;ve ever had! The clam chowder had clams in the shells as well as chunks in the broth, which was very flavorful and not overly creamy.
The clam pizza was very good but a little rich; probably better for dinner than lunch."

I made reservations actually to go to EN Brasserie right across the street for a 2:15pm lunch. I arrived at 2:38 and were told that they closed at 2:30 so we were not able to be seated. It was a very frustrating start to my lunch. We went outside sure that there were no other restaurants in the close proximity that were open for lunch or any good.

We stumbled into The Clam and were immediately seated which was awesome. The floor to ceiling windows surrounding the restaurant make for a great ambiance.

The waiter was great as he was very animated and made great suggestions. 

I had the spicy pasta with clams and arugula which was AMAZING. I also tried the sweet pea risotto balls which were out of this world and a must-order. Also, make sure to try the bread. Yes they actually charge for it, but it&#39;s damn good!

I wanted so much to love this place based on Colameco&#39;s great review and all the nice yelp reviews.....but this wasn&#39;t the case.

It&#39;s sad how service can ruin your experience.  Period.
Empty Rosh Hashanah restaurant Sunday night.   Place only 25% full.

Server could care less about anyone.  He was miserable.  Such a grump, so unfriendly and so inattentive.    How about taking a drink order?   Too busy chatting with his friend.   
Hostess was pleasant but just stood there looking into space.

Food:  The burrata w/ grapes was great, as were the pea risotto fritters......but the clam pizza was awful.  Heavy, tasted like sausage and terrible crust (I love Franny&#39;s or New Haven style clam pizza, thin and garlicky with clams and parsley!).

Sad to say we could have had a lovely Sunday evening, but this guy with his mood ruined ours.

Won&#39;t be going back anytime soon....too many nice places in the West Village to eat with great people and great food.

Jokes aside, my dining experience was fantastic. I came here with my family, and it was a wonderful treat for us all. The restaurant is very dimly lit with candles on each table. The tables are draped with white tablecloths, and you can immediately feel the more upscale vibe when you walk in.

We started with a bottle of white wine recommended by the sommelier to accompany our seafood meal and were each served warm housemade parker house rolls, which had generous amounts of butter and were light and fluffy. We ordered the house special clam chowder to start. The clam chowder was not your average cup of soup. It was presented with a few large clams in the shell swimming in the pool of soup, toppling with oyster crackers, bacon, and leeks. This proved to be a much more impressive display, and the taste was equally pleasing. The soup was not overwhelmed with potatoes and lumpy from globs of cream, as you might find in a diner, but rather was light but flavorful. 

Next, we had the stuffed clams with pancetta, trinity, lemon, and buttered crumbs. This was also a hit, as the pancetta and butter crumbs provided a nice textural contrast to the chewy clam. They were adorably served five to an order in the shell around a small salad of arugula and lemon. This was one of many highlights of the night.

My family and I all ordered different fish dishes. After all, if you come to a seafood restaurant, you&#39;re not going to gravitate towards the chicken or steak. We ordered the roasted cauliflower with dried cranberries and sauteed kale with lemon, chili, &amp; garlic as well. Everyone was raving about their respective entrees, and not a crumb was left.

To end the meal on a sweet note, I ordered the ginger bread ic sandwich with mascarpone gelato &amp; brown butter caramel. I&#39;m a huge fan of gingerbread and ice cream in general, so this was right up my alley. They cut the ice cream sandwich in half, so it was perfect for my mom &amp; I to share. The zing from the gingerbread complemented the creaminess of the gelato. It was a perfect ending to a great meal.

Having said all that and adding everything up, this meal cost a pretty penny. Luckily, I had a gift certificate that covered it all, but it was all worth it. The food was delicious, and the service was wonderful. Despite The Clam being rather far from where I live, I would definitely return for a special occasion or a fancy date night and would highly recommend it to anyone."

I was thinking more of a Mermaid Oyster Bar, Cull &amp; Pistol, John Dory, or Aquagrill vibe - casual, lively, etc.. The Clam has more of an upscale setting. Not the place I would have met up with a couple buddies I hadn&#39;t seen in a while. 

All that being said, I was impressed with the Fluke Crudo, Spaghetti &amp; Clams, and Raviolo. Clam sliders were ridiculous. Steamers were a miss and Burrata was above average."

You can actually taste the bourbon in the dessert, and it is so smooth... I miss it already. And how could I forget about the fried clam and lobster slider! That was one of the most delicious dishes I had there!

Saying that, my big problem is with their service. Our waiter hardly exchange any word with us, he just showed up with his pen and pad ready to take the order, no suggestions or telling us about the specials of the day. When we said we&#39;re not ready yet, he disappeared and it took him a while to come back. We (my wife and I ) felt kind of patronized by his behavior, it felt like he doesn&#39;t want to be bothered. The dishes didn&#39;t come in the order we expected. We had the ravioli first and 20 minutes later the clam dip. We also noticed when we got the bill that we&#39;ve been charged for the bread and butter.

The meal unfortunately was uneven. Daily oysters were perfectly shucked and delicious. Brussels sprouts are a must. The dishes with this namesake&#39;s ingredient however were disappointing. The baked clams were chewy and overly breaded. In South Philly you can get a dozen baked clams for a third of the price and they&#39;ll knock your socks off. The clam pizza also disappointed. It hardly tasted of clams and what few there were were also chewy.

Ambiance: 5.0-stars


Here&#39;s my individual food ratings:

5.0-stars: Parker House Rolls - excellent and complimentary, I kept requesting more 
3.5-stars: Campechana Shrimp Cocktail - sauce was a little too sweet 
4.5-stars: Butter Lettuce &amp; Asparagus Salad - diversity of flavors, was exceptional 
4.5-stars: Scallop Crudo - very delicate and tasty 
3.0-stars: Lobster &amp; Clam Sliders - too fried and greasy, couldn&#39;t even taste the lobster
1.0-star: Broccoli - didn&#39;t finish,was so badly burnt 
5.0-stars:  Panna Cotta w/rhubarb compote - was amazing, might have been the best thing I had

The food: Delicious across the board. My personal favorite is the steamers, which have a natural broth that is so good you don&#39;t even need to touch the butter. The clam pizza is truly unique and my entire family of picky eaters are fans. The sliders are good as well, though the lobster is better than the fried clams (might be better to try to get it with just the lobster if possible). The free butter rolls are sinful. I also love the ice cream sandwich dessert; I haven&#39;t tried the others but they all look good.
The service: Accommodating, prompt, and friendly.

it is able to maintain a purity of its bistro class without feeling exploitative. 

Staying simple, with plates in the $15-$30 range, and bottles starting around $45, you can capture a cafe experience appropriate for a long lunch with a good friend.  

We came around 3:30, when the place was half full, and snagged a spot on the sidewalk, ordered a bottle of rose from Provence $45, and the 
clam dip with house made potato chips.  The clam dip was fresh with sour cream and well seasoned.  
We also shared a side of escarole and lobster roll sliders and the chocolate ice box cake.  

Everything was very good for around $100, it was the kind of meal old friends in their 40&#39;s might exactly want.

If you appreciate seafood and don&#39;t mind paying for the good stuff, this is your place. But if you don&#39;t really, truly LOVE seafood, as was the case for a few in my party, The Clam may not be so suitable.

We arrived for a 5:15 reservation and were seated immediately. It took a little while for bread and drinks to come out, hence the 0.5 star deduction. Though the rolls were warm and delicious when they did arrive!

Our seafood dishes were insanely good. We ordered the stuffed clams, clam dip, seafood raviolo, linguine in red clam sauce, duck breast salad, and crispy chicken.

The clam dip was the best I&#39;ve ever had. Even if you don&#39;t think you like clam dip, order it! The lobster raviolo was also incredible, though keep in mind this dish is a singular (albeit large) raviolo. So if you want to make that your entree, order a few sides as well.

The linguine in clam sauce was fresh and delicious -- You could tell the pasta was homemade. And the baked clams were perfectly breaded and tender.

I can&#39;t vouch for the chicken or duck salad, which my non-seafood-fanatic friends ordered, but I heard it was good. The duck salad was a very tiny portion though, so be warned. (Tiny portions are a theme. If you&#39;re the kind of person who likes massive plates to bring home for later, this is not your place.)

Overall, The Clam is a delicious, fancy treat and a must for all shellfish lovers. I definitely recommend!"

After, we ordered the lobster raviolo to share. Very delicious and nice size chunks of lobster inside. 

For our main course, my friend got the swordfish. (Grilled perfectly,with a light vinaigrette). I got the stuffed clams. The stuffing was seasoned nicely and delicately with little tomatoes. My only issue was that the clams were overcooked and rubbery. (What a shame.)

This will definitely be on my list every time I&#39;m in new york. Can&#39;t wait to come back and try some other things."

The service was very good. Our server always came by to make sure we were ok and refill our water. The clams here are huge! Very fresh! We really liked the spaghetti and clams. Portions are not that big. It was very nice of them to split the dishes up for us since we were sharing everything. The clam chowder was not that heavy either. It had a lot of leeks. The baked clams were good too. They included red pepper in the breadcrumbs. Tasted very refreshing. We were so full we couldn&#39;t get dessert. Need to go back and try the rest of the dishes! The place is not that big so make sure you make rezzy early! Also a good date place!

I&#39;m NOT a seafood or shellfish eater, but was invited to a birthday brunch and decided to go with the flow. SO glad I did. Every single item we ordered and demolished was superb!!!

We ordered multiple appetizers, an entree and then dessert. 1st things 1st, quality of food, freshness and preparation were top notch. You could taste it in every bite.

Appetizers were: baked clams, iced clams, West coast &amp; east coast oysters and the chips and clam dip. Not a bad bite to be had. Each were phenomenal and brought out with perfect timing. Also the Parker house bread was a beautiful pre entree treat. Loved it.

Entree: gf had the bass and I had the Pat LaFreida burger (I know, but it was extremely tasty!). The bass was grilled to perfection and gorgeously presented. 

Dessert: coffee and 86 proof bourbon chocolate ice cake. One word... WOW. 2 of my favorite things in a single, beautiful dessert. Simply heaven.

Great service, I HIGHLY recommend! Thumbs up from our entire party and we let the restaurant team know in the great little book you get to sign in at the end"

There were simply too many delicious sounding options on the menu and we were only two people so we sadly didn&#39;t get to try too many things. We first shared the steamed little neck clams as an appetizer (juicy clams in a salty, savory broth with grilled herbed bread). They were memorable. 

So were our entrees, though! I had the fried clam belly and lobster sliders on grilled brioche buns. They look small but that is deceiving...I was quite full by the time I had devoured them. The other entree dish we tried was our favorite of the whole meal - the lobster, leek, tarragon raviolo (singular as oppose to the plural ravioli) was one of the best things I&#39;ve eaten...maybe ever. The raviolo was perfectly al dente and the seafood broth it came in, as well as the lobster filling, was superb.

I had to have more veggies - so I tried something different in combination: fennel and escarole with raisins and roasted garlic.

To complete my sampling I ordered the clam pizza with a super thin crunchy crust.  I will heat up some tomorrow with an egg for breakfast.

First, let me say - I am more than a little picky and I research plans to death when we travel! Plus, I am an accomplished home cook and love well prepared meals.  

I selected the clam for the first dinner in NYC (thank you fellow yelpers!) and it did not disappoint. The ambiance, the service, the food - everything was on point. As starters we ordered the clam dip and chips, the fried soft shell crab (it is seasonal and not on the online menu) and the lobster sliders. 

My husband LOVED the crab and I thought the lobster sliders were really good. A little dry, but overall, but I still loved them. I am from the Deep South and I thought a little extra mayo on the bread might have solved the problem. :-) but, maybe, that&#39;s just me! 

Even though I read lots of reviews where people loved the clam dip and chips, it just wasn&#39;t our cup of tea. The dip tasted a little like vinegar and after 2-3 bites, I could not get beyond the flavor. We finished off the chips, but did not eat all the dip. 

But, the atmosphere ( although a little loud depending on the crowd - we stayed a long time) was fabulous and the service was great - attentive but not intrusive, it was some of the best we&#39;ve had anywhere. Too, I had a cucumber and gin cocktail, it was really tasty. Cool and refreshing, loved it. 

For entrees, we both had clams and spaghetti based on yelp reviews - OMG!!!! It was a great dish, pasta was well done but with a bite, the clams and the sauce a little spicy, the crunch and texture of fresh arugula - if you like seafood or pasta - please order this dish. We both loved it. I could have done with just the spaghetti and clams and the free Parker house rolls - it was that wonderful. Of all the restaurants I&#39;ve ever been to, this one dish was extra special in my opinion! 

The clam was so wonderful, we both agreed to cancel our reservations at another place and opted to return to this restaurant. We loved it that much. The second go round, we did not have the same beautiful female wait person, but the male server we had was equally good.

Dinner two, my husband ordered the scallop crudo (another dish highly rated on yelp) and I ordered the chilled lobster louie style. The scallops were wonderful, cool and flavorful. The lobster was a little pricey for the amount, but I really liked the rumoulade sauce. Another round of fabulous crispy on the outside and light/fluffy on the inside Parker house rolls and butter - yum. 

For entrees, I ordered the steak that came with sides of potato casserole and broccoli. It was wonderful. The meat was cooked just as it was ordered and the sauce it was topped with was a savory delight. The broccoli was done well, but still crunchy and the potato casserole was equally tasty. My husband ordered the lobster louie for and entree along with escarole and carrots. As he ate mouthfuls of both veggies, I heard only - this is really good over and over from his side of the table. So, the veggies were a big hit!

Cocktails: I started with the cucumber gin drink and moved on to the aviation. They were both well crafted. 

Smarter the second time around, we actually saved a little room for dessert. We shared the 86 proof chocolate icebox cake. It was cool, just the right size and had a hint of bourbon flavor without overpowering the dish. My husband topped it off with a brandy that he proclaimed to be a perfect end to a perfect meal. Highly recommend!"

     From the moment we walked in the staff made us feel at home.Our server,Brinley,was a true sweetheart. Her service was impeccable. 
     I am a sucker for oysters, and the Clam has both east and west coast mollusks to choose from.Brinley even thought my joke about east coast oysters rolling up on west coast oysters was slightly amusing. Bonus points awarded!
    The menu is so amazing,we opted for a bunch of appetizers instead of the usual app,entree route,and I am happy we went that route.

Yuzu marinated fluke crudo was out of this world.Super fresh,and the flavors were spot on.

Fried clam and lobster sliders.Another hit.I actually ate my slider in six bites!Go ahead and laugh,but I wanted to enjoy each tiny bite to prolong the pleasure.

Clam Chowder was the best I ever had.Not too creamy,yet delicious.

Oysters.We enjoyed 6 east coast and 6 west coast,and enjoyed both.I had never eaten West coast oysters before,and enjoyed their flavor profile very much.

The drink menu is very interesting,and we had a few of their signature cocktails.The drinks were refreshing and potent!

For dessert we had the 86 proof chocalate icebox cake which might be the best dessert I have ever eaten.If you like chocolate,or even think you like chocalate,try this dessert.Brinley explained it was some kind of cookie soaked in liquor,but all I remember is bliss.

I really really liked the Clam and will be returning soon.Apologies to my west coast oyster friends!"
the-clam-new-york,Ed U.,m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,"San Francisco, CA",1,1,1,3924,33,o1FObKB4ItKu_M1NU02awQ,3.0,2014-08-16,"I didn&#39;t know nuthin&#39; &#39;bout the Clam before I went, but I have heard of Little Owl, one of Joey Campanaro&#39;s other places in the same &#39;hood. In fact, had I known it was in the same &#39;hood, I probably would have gone because y&#39;see, the Clam was a spontaneous decision for me as a late night dining experience. I had just gotten out of the Carole King musical, &#34;Beautiful&#34;, and thought I could head to the West Village and try the famous Japanese-style Korean BBQ spot, Takashi. Much to my dismay, they shoo&#39;ed me away since they were in their exclusive ramen-serving hour. So I just walked up a block and found the Clam. It struck me as fancier than I had in mind.

However, as I was about to turn around, the young manager sat me at a table without hesitation. With the white tablecloths and dark, candle-lit ambiance, believe me, I was the one who was hesitating (photo: http://bit.ly/1oZtgoe). When I saw the menu, no small feat with the lack of lighting, I was surprised it was a rather concise collection of dishes presented by chef Mike Price. Mostly shellfish-focused, of course, except for a steak and a chicken option to accommodate presumably Aunt Rose who&#39;s allergic to seafood and the check. Nothing struck me as overly fancy except the prices. They even serve spaghetti and clams and a clam fried rice. I supposed I could have gone in that direction, but I felt a need to try something different.

I got it with the $14 Scallops Crudo. It was a quartet topped with strawberries, hazelnuts, chives and lime juice (photo: http://bit.ly/1uFJoyw). They were quite fresh-tasting and gone rather quickly. No matter as I kept my stomach company with one of their piping-hot, &#34;complementary&#34; Parker House Rolls - buttery, yeasty with a sprinkle of sea salt on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1t84ly6)- and a flute of the Prosecco Cuvée Beatrice (photo: http://bit.ly/1mUKNZY), a nice sparkler though frankly it was starting to put me to sleep. For my entree, I was almost tempted by the Fried Belly Clam &amp; Lobster Sandwich, but it just seemed a bit too stiff in there to gorge on something like that near midnight.

Besides I was watching a romantic couple at the next table serving oysters to each other in an obvious act of seafood foreplay, so I assume looking at the fried crumbs on my face would dissipate the moment for them. Instead, I ordered the $31 Black Sea Bass, which must have attended the finest schools in the ocean to achieve that price tag. It came on top of a creamy pistachio pesto sauce with carrots and grilled gem lettuce (photo: http://bit.ly/1pSPlUw). It was flaky-tender with the crispy skin left intact, good but not entirely memorable. I must admit to myself I am one of those red-checkerboard-plastic-tablecloth-and-nutcracker kind of a seafood diner because this track was running a little fast for this culinary plow horse.

FOOD - 3.5 stars...nice seafood for sure albeit at a higher price point than I think it may warrant
AMBIANCE - 3 stars...awfully dark at night, perhaps flashlights could be an option
SERVICE - 4 stars...fine waiter, no complaints here
TOTAL - 3 stars...the idea of an upmarket clam house just seems contradictory to me"
the-clam-new-york,Judy C.,Cujuj3lkFu2bKku-yoT3PA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,30,12,vyfLWKI_1sDfjdTkoIOyAw,3.0,2016-01-09,"3.25 stars.  We arrived as a party of 4 for a 6:15pm reservation as 2 couples. Service was good and I&#39;d give it 4 stars.  My boyfriend and I arrived early and grabbed a drink at the bar. Mid-drink, the hostess asked if we would be okay being seated at our table as there was a couple wanting to dine at the bar, sans reservation. We said fine and got seated nicely as a spacious 4-top in the back with the couch on one side and our remaining party of 2 joined.

We ordered everything at once (we had a tight schedule as I knew in advance that the restaurant had an 8:15pm reservation after). This included a bottle of wine, 2 starters, 4 entrees, 2 vegetables and the house Parker rolls. I&#39;d rate the food anywhere from 2.5 - 4 stars depending on what you order.

Starters included 4 east coast (Wellfleet from MA) and 4 west coast (Royal Miyagi from BC) oysters as well as the popular clam dip.  The oysters were great. I&#39;ve had both types at other oyster bars and  probably slightly favored the Royal Miyagi. The clam dip (2.5-3 stars) was served with the house chips, which were a bit too salty for me.  The dip itself was fine but not something I would order or rave about. It has a bit of a pickle taste in there and just seemed more creamy than clam-like to me. Let&#39;s just say there was still dip left after 4 of us took a bit, and I was not having seconds.

Then came the house Parker Rolls which were nice and fluffy. I didn&#39;t even need to butter than and they were still very tasty.  For entrees, I ordered the whole fish which was a sea bream,  and this was probably my favorite of the entrees (4 stars) and our whole meal along with the oysters. My date ordered the monkfish over a butternut squash risotto (3 stars) and the other couple ordered the clam pizza (2 stars) and spaghetti with clams (3 stars). The vegetables to go on the side were the Brussels sprouts (2 stars) and the Cauliflower (3 stars).  The restaurant is nice for a date and I&#39;d give the ambiance a 4, but lacked for me on food and value. The monkfish and sea bream were in the $30s range, oysters were $3.50 each, clam dip was $13 and the pasta/pizzas were around the $20s. I&#39;d overall give the food 2.75 - 3 stars. I just wasn&#39;t wowed enough by anything for the cost. Would I come back? Not too quickly."

The service was exceptional and despite our large order, we received our food remarkably quickly for a Saturday evening in a jam packed restaurant. My only complaint is that the server never refilled our water, but that might be because we were seated outside.  Nevertheless, the food and service beyond the water situation were awesome and still worthy of a 5 star rating. We ordered the clam dip, Angus beef carpaccio, fluke crudo (that was in the best watermelon gazpacho I have ever tasted), the clam chowder &amp; the Maine lobster &amp; leek raviolo to start.  Every single appetizer was more delicious than the next. Following that mini feast, we dined on Long Island Steamers, fried clam &amp; lobster sliders, &amp; the spaghetti and clams. The sautéed kale and the Old Bay fries were the perfect sides for our meal.  We were too full to order to dessert, but I will definitely visit the Clam again in the future!"

The Clam just nailed it tonight.  There was a great vibe--the music, lighting, and environment were spot on--and the food was outstanding.  In particular I would recommend the fluke crudo, as well as the special autumn salad.  The restaurant is top notch, but unassuming at the same time.

Most important, however, was the service.  I have been to countless west village and NYC hotspots, but rarely do I have the pleasure of such an easygoing server.

the-clam-new-york,Lori L.,DaV7jKNC9VuBM-0XTT2IgQ,"New York, NY",1,1,1,1952,124,3oci7MZZBFEb7-HFuoQmmg,4.0,2014-05-29,"With a long-held following for their two established restaurants (The Little Owl and Market Table), Chef Mike Price and Joey Campanaro opened up The Clam in a well-traversed corner in West Village. As the name suggests, much of the menu is devoted to this bivalve, although it&#39;s not exclusively a shellfish or seafood restaurant. Even early on, making reservations required at least three weeks advance notice, although I was able to get our group of five a table at a prime dinner hour one Wednesday evening.

Located a few steps from a relatively new addition from the prior year (Piora), The Clam boasts one of the more eclectic interiors in the area. Capable of holding 40-50 guests at a time, the restaurant features an even distribution of rustic brick walls against lengthy (almost floor-to-ceiling) windows, smooth, dark flooring, and a ceiling dotted with a mosaic of mother-of-pearl tiles. The design is intended to mimic the experience of being enclosed within a clam shell, a goal that&#39;s perhaps only partially successful. Nonetheless, we were efficiently seated after confirming our reservation, and our server was able to clarify a few questions and note a few adjustments to the dishes we ordered.

Our group started off with an order of the Clam Dip. The dip is uniquely composed, made of sour cream, Worcestershire, and cayenne pepper, as well as a few surprising, chewy bites of top neck clams. Served with zesty potato chips, which are generously seasoned with Old Bay, it was a promising start to the meal. Thankfully, the small portion (especially when shared amongst five people) left enough room for the Spaghetti &amp; Clams, which my friend and I split as an appetizer. The dish, comprised of spaghetti in red sauce, is complemented with a few clams, a small salad, and a spicy gravy. The spaghetti has a noticeable texture and chew, the red sauce lightly acidic and aromatic, and the spice from the gravy a subtle contrast in flavor. While it treads on the pricier side for a spaghetti ($21), it&#39;s one of the signature dishes for good reason.

My friends opted for more seafood-based mains, but I went with the Roasted Half Bell &amp; Evans Chicken. While it might be seen as a pedestrian dish, I was pleased with how tempting it was; the chicken had a crisp and well-seasoned skin, but was able to maintain a piping hot and tender interior. With a side of hot lettuce, hen of the woods mushrooms, and sliced radish, it made for a filling main and a solid option for those who are looking for non-seafood options at the restaurant.

In hindsight, The Clam is one of the more successful openings for this year. A compact and well-executed menu, professional service, and a cozy dining ambiance almost guarantees a satisfactory meal. The restaurant has recently expanded its hours to encompass lunch and brunch as well, which gives diners an even better chance of securing a table in the upcoming months."

My favorites so far are the crudos (most recently, the diver scallop crudo), the fried calm &amp; lobster sliders, and the spaghetti &amp; clams. We washed it all down with a delicious  bottle of rosé. The servers were very helpful and friendly, and the bartender made sure I had a beverage that I really liked while I waited for my friends.

That&#39;s not the case here because all spotlights and drooling taste buds are on The Clam. 

As with any dining experience, it&#39;s essential to have a starter to warm up the foodies&#39; palates. Even more so, the starter has to be good since it usually sets the tone and pace for everything else that follows. Chef &amp; owner, Mike Price, executed on this concept flawlessly. We were served with the freshest and softest rolls (all freshly made in-house). These rolls were so flavorful with just a light spread of soft creamy butter and a touch of sea salt. (I could easily eat a dozen or more!)

Once our taste buds started to drool, we couldn&#39;t wait to try the rest. Most dishes on the menu consist of clam as either the main or supporting ingredient. My favorites -- the Fried Belly Clam &amp; Lobster Sliders. For two sliders, it will run you $24, a bit pricey, but worth it. I really enjoyed the crispiness of fried belly and the tenderness of fresh lobster combined-- an interesting combination of textures and flavors. Then on with the Clam Chowder, which is the real deal-- light and creamy with fresh clams. Another delicious one is the Grilled White Clam Pizza --comes with thin crust, great for sharing.

What started as a curiosity to try something I&#39;ve always considered boring and bland, actually turned out to be quite fascinating and delicious. I commend the chef for taking on the clam challenge with such creativity and passion. Bravo!"

Service is top notch, ambiance is great - nice place for a cozy romantic dinner. 

Must Gets: 
Spaghetti with Clams: The noodles are cooked perfectly. There is a bit of bite and bounce to the noodles and there is a hint of spice to the seasoning. There is also a generous amount of clam in shells and clam bits in the dish. I could eat this all day. 

Sliders: These are so very tasty, and all the right textures.

Steamers, 16: excellent broth and a delightful presentation
Clam pizza, 19: the little kick from peppers was welcome and the entire pizza was delicious and filling. You might consider this as a second entree for a table of two or an appetizer for a table of four.
Whole fish grilled, sea bream, 33: Exactly what you want a whole grilled fish to be. Paired with sicilian escarole that was tasty.
Ice cream sandwich, 9: marscapone gelato between two fresh ginger cookies with a little brown butter caramel on the plate. Good!

Let me first say that if you are a particular lover of bivalves this will be a cold 5 star spot for you. For instance, anyone who digs Flex Mussels will probably faint when they step into this place. Clams, clams, and more clams. Heck, we even got a fish dish just to try.

Let me first say that the Parker House roll here is nothing compared to the one they give you at Butter in midtown. Butter doesn&#39;t do too much else well so just give them that at least. It is their only really good item. 

Dry Parker House rolls aside, this place definitely stunned. The clam chowder was one of the better versions of this dish in the entire city, as it is both restrained while being satisfyingly creamy. The Cherrystone Stuffies were awesome, much like Oyster Rockefeller but with cherrystone clams instead, chopped up and mixed with a hearty almost vegetal pepper and breadcrumb stuffing. 

The Spaghetti and Clams is also a very good, if not somewhat overly oily dish. Speaking of overly oily I have to say that my bass entree, while breathtakingly beautiful (peep the pic!), could have had a little more flavor and a little less butter. Honestly, even while I said &#34;the bass&#34; to the waiter I knew I should have been ordering the Clam Fried Rice. Well, I will definitely be back and I won&#39;t make the same mistake twice.

So, in summary, this restaurant rocks. It is new and will iron out some of their ever-changing fish preparations, but when it comes to the House Specialties section of the menu at least, they really have it on lock."

We came here Friday night without reservations and we put our name and number down and had drinks across the street. We were called within the hour and seated upon arrival.

The service was pretty great and the ambiance is very cute. It&#39;s definitely a great place to come on a date. 

We ordered the beausoleil oysters and the king crab. Both were divine. Even more delicious was the clam dip, which comes with chips. As for the main dishes, I ordered the fish with kale and my friends ordered the clam fried rice and the clam spaghetti. I could have enjoyed my dish a lot more except it was really salty. I also tried the clam friend rice and that was pretty salty as well. The only dish that wasn&#39;t salty was the pasta, which was delicious. Also devoured was the brussels sprouts with panchetta and that was defintely a hit witht he table.

I think this is a great new addition to west village, but next time I dine here I will ask then to ease up on the salt for the entrees."

There was a piece of glass in the duck breast appetizer. My mom bit on something as she was chewing the duck salad. She thought it may have been a small pebble...so we were horrified when she spit a piece of glass out of her mouth. It was about 1/4 size of a pinky nail.

We just started the dish and that really put a damper to say the least on my birthday meal.  The oysters were fantastic. The ravioli was delicious.  The signature spaghetti dish and the sides were spot on. The staff and service were impeccable... Which is why it is hard to leave the 1 star. But a piece of glass??? That is scary stuff! What if she swallowed it or it cut the inside of her mouth? My mom was insisting that I forget about it and try to enjoy the meal.. But I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about how offensive the situation was..

Granted one of the waitstaff came and apologized twice. They comped the duck dish as well as 2 veggie side dishes (which I thought wasn&#39;t much of a compensation given the gravity of the situation) ... but the gnawing feeling wouldn&#39;t go away. Im writing this review not to deter any diners from experiencing The Clam. In fact, the food was fresh and delicious.  I&#39;m simply hoping the restaurant&#39;s kitchen staff will be mindful with preparations so as to prevent diners from experiencing a similar situation.

Cocktails were delicious too. Our waitress was incredibly attentive, kind and sweet, a west transplant that joked with us about her experience living in NYC. She even gave us a card at the end of the night to call and make reservations for local residents since the place can get packed.

We started with the raw oysters and raw clams, which were incredibly fresh and tasty. The oysters rockefeller were a lightened, modern interpretation of the classic dish, and were perfectly savory without being overly salty. Scallop crudo was great, but the oysters rockefeller won the appetizer round for me.

They have a lobster and fried belly clam roll that I wanted to try, but I couldn&#39;t pass up the fried softshell crab special they had that day. Luckily, another person in our group wanted both as well, so the kitchen accommodated us and gave us a half portion of each. The food was beautifully presented and the first bite of the lobster and clam roll had me wishing I had a whole roll for myself. Then, I took a bite of the softshell crab and found myself content with our decision to split the two dishes, since I couldn&#39;t decide which entree I liked better. 

Overall, highly recommend this place if you&#39;re looking for an elegant seafood meal that isn&#39;t overly fussy."

This is another charming (and in my opinion, superior) spot from Mike Price of the Little Owl.  It&#39;s easier to get a reservation, not as cramped, and has more variety of food than it&#39;s long-standing sister.  

The bread rolls here are fantastic, and served warm with butter on the side.  I also like to start off the meal with their clam dip, which is so creamy and delicious although be warned - it IS heavy.  Given the restaurant name, you can expect their clams and oysters to be very fresh, although the long island duck breast starter was good in its own right as well.  I am also a fan of the Spaghetti and clams, although on my most recent visit it wasn&#39;t as good as I remembered... Other items I like are the Clam fried rice, roasted chicken, and swordfish.  They also get extra points for splitting up items when you are sharing dishes.

If you can&#39;t get a reservation for dinner, they do a great brunch as well with a lot of their classic dishes on the menu.  But for me, the peekytoe crab benedict is a personal brunch favorite.

I think their desserts are average (not sure if they have a pastry chef), but I am usually so stuffed by the end of my meal that I just skip it.  If you&#39;re looking for a new restaurant to try in the West Village, definitely give this place a look!"

Mee-kiew-hang is a vinaigrette based egg noodle dish. They put their house-made pork belly (marinated) on top coupled with ground peanuts. It&#39;s a heavenly combination which has compelled me to return every sunday evening.

I probably wouldn&#39;t trek to LIC specifically to come here, as I think there are many Thai restaurants in NYC with similarly competent, delicious food, but it&#39;s still better than some of the restaurants around the Vernon-Jackson 7 train stop that haven&#39;t quite figured out their direction/identity yet.

You can get all the reliable Thai restaurant staples at Tuk Tuk; the execution is solid, the flavors are balanced, and the ingredients are fresh. I like the street food menu items as they&#39;re a little less conventional. The one thing you should definitely order? The Pineapple Duck Curry is a great bet, because the duck is tender, with a crispy skin and not too much toughness. 

Service is attentive and polite, and the prices are in line with the neighborhood. Overall, I don&#39;t crave the food from here as I do from places like SriPraPhai or the Zabbs, but it&#39;s solid."

Don&#39;t be fooled by the outside. The restaurant does not have the greatest curb side appeal, but they sure make up for it in the inside. The decor is contemporary and clean. The staff are friendly and attentive.

The breakdown of the food.

Soup of the day- They all are cream based soup. Soup is on a rotation and they claim they have no idea what is being served the next day. They might, but they won&#39;t tell me. Example of soup: Corn, Broccoli, and etc.

Fried Chicken Wontons- It comes with a sauce that taste like duck sauce with chili peppers. It&#39;s a nice contrast in flavor. 
Roti pancakes with Massaman curry- Very flavorful and aromatic. The curry is a little spicy but also sweat. You can eat the potato, peanuts and other ingredients in the dipping curry sauce. 

Pad Thai- Pretty standard
Pad See Ew- Solid choice. IMO, It has more flavor than the pad thai.

I broke this down by how many glasses of water you will need. Everybody is just curious how hot curry is anyways. 

Green Curry- You will need to have your glass refilled at least once. 
Red Curry- Still brings the heat, but you will be taking a sip every couple of bites. 
Panang Curry- 3 or 4 sips total at most during the meal. 
Massaman Curry- A sip or two throughout the meal. It&#39;s a sweet curry.

Warm Chocolate Cake- It is the most balance of the dessert. Nothing too cold, sweet or overwhelming in taste. 
Fried Ice Cream - Big portion for dessert. Can&#39;t go wrong with fried ice cream. 
Apple banana roll with coconut ice cream- This is big enough portion for 2. The apple and banana is minimal in terms of fillings in the roll"

Came here with a girlfriend and we had a great time. We had two orders of their spring rolls (it was that good), basil fried rice, tom yum soup, duck curry and the fried green tea ice cream.

We loved everything! Please note the duck curry is really spicy and we were a sweaty mess! My friend had the house wine and I had a Thai tea. Great choices for the both of us. Our water glasses were never empty for more than 2 minutes

Our favorite dishes were the green tea ice cream and the spring rolls. My tom yum soup was excellent and had 3 giant shrimps!

They have a selection of authentic Thai dishes that are so spicy that there is a disclaimer and warning label. My fiancé already is ready to try those and test the spicy levels for himself"

I ordered the Mee-Kiew Hang dish, which is Thai street food with egg noodles, wontons, roasted pork slices, bok choy and ground peanuts. The tart flavor of the noodles (from the lime vinaigrette) went well with the subtler, sweeter taste of the roasted pork. I like that this dish has so many textures from the different ingredients it contains. 

I ordered two dessert dishes: the fried green tea ice cream dish and the chocolate cake. Both dishes were beautifully presented and small (each is great for one person, or for two people to share). The fried ice cream dish came with a mint sprig and chocolate drizzle. It was tough to eat, though-- both the fried layer and the ice cream scoop were hard to slice through with my spoon, because both were so thick and dense, though delicious. 

The chocolate cake (which was more like a lava cake with its chocolate-sauce center) also came with a mint sprig and a light vanilla sauce. This dish was rich and velvety and not too heavy on the stomach.

The interior of this restaurant is colorful and fun without looking overwhelming-- its walls are white and lime green, with some wooden pieces and parts."

Much to my disappointment, I will not be coming back here again. The Pad See Yew and Mee-Kiew-Hang were so incredibly bland I had to drench my poor noodles in sriracha and lime to even finish the meal. The dishes were decent after I squeezed in like 3 lime wedges and doused sriracha all over my noodles. 

The interior was nice but the restaurant had the funkiest playlist EVER from like &#34;Since You&#39;ve Been Gone&#34; by Kelly Clarkson to this epic movie soundtrack OST to Taylor Swift and back again to epic orchestral music with a couple EDM songs sprinkled in here and there.

I woke up yesterday to, as they say in Thailand, &#34;the Big POOP&#34;. That&#39;s right, the big one - all day too!! Anyway, the people are friendly there, I guess they didn&#39;t mean to poison me so they served me with a smile, after all I always leave a good tip, %15. 

I cannot say if the cook was having a bad day (maybe him and one of the gay servers had a fight) or maybe the chicken he used in the fried rice was not fully cooked, only they know. Like I said, I am just posting from Sunday&#39;s experience, I&#39;ve gotten food at Tuk Tuk in the past and it&#39;s been very delicious - no tummy ache, however today they get only 2 stars.

Update: 4 days of a bad stomach, lots of alka seltzer and I finally got over the BIG POOP, I won&#39;t be going to Tuk Tuk again, it&#39;s not worth it."

Just a small sign that says &#34;Tuk Tuk&#34; with a stylized graphic of the iconic Thai micro transit alternative. The storefront admirably preserves the word &#34;paints&#34; in stained glass from a former tenant.  Otherwise, the sleek environment evokes a Thai sense of place without resorting to stereotypes. We only stopped in for a bite of soup and appetizers, Tom Ka Gai, Roti-Massaman, Pork Pot Stickers, Sticky Rice, Jasmine Rice and Thai Tea.  But it was all very rich and satisfying. The Tom Ka Gai soup was tangy and a little sweete.  The Roti-Massaman was so delicious, we kept finding more things to dip in the Massaman sauce when the flat bread was done.  If it weren&#39;t for the rice, we probably would have dipped pieces of the tablecloth to finish it off.  I&#39;m not in LIC/Hunters Point often, but I will have to make a point of getting back."

The restaurant itself is really cute, but the only thing I liked was the spring rolls. We ordered dumplings and the wrapper was rice paper. My friends liked it, but I didn&#39;t. If I order dumplings, I don&#39;t think they should be in rice paper...

My udon chicken dish was also not good. Presentation wise, it looked delicious but the chicken was a bit fishy and the noodles weren&#39;t udon!! It was a soggy pile of some other noodle I couldn&#39;t identify. My friend&#39;s tofu dish was bland and not impressive either. Seemed like just the dish I would make at home if I had leftover vegetables lying around the fridge. The pork belly in the explore section of the menu wasn&#39;t that good either! It was just a few pieces of meat with rice. I just don&#39;t think I should be paying $12-$15 for a dish that I could probably cook up really fast. 

All in all, a huge disappointment in all aspects.

They only take max 3 cards btw."

The Papaya salad was no good and  didn&#39;t taste right. The flavor profile was completely off, it&#39;s like they had to adjust it for American taste buds or some BS. 

The grilled squid was good, surprisingly

The Moo ping was decent, but nothing to ring home about

The pad gra pow gai was not authentic, uses sliced chicken not ground chicken, and there wasn&#39;t enough flavor, too toned down. 

The Seafood stir fry (forgot the name) was not bad, but again, just average

The Mango rice was good, but the rice was a bit mushy.

Overall I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;ll come back here again, but maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve tasted a whole different level of Thai food."

The inside of the restaurant is pretty modern. We were seated immediately after entering. After looking through the menu, which had standard pricing, we decided to order and share the beef drunken noodles and the chicken masssaman curry. Both dishes came out pretty fast and were both excellent. 

Service was somewhat standard, water was refilled pretty quickly. I did feel, that we were slightly rushed, even though the restaurant wasn&#39;t that busy. Idk if that feeling was based on the fact that we were in fact rushed or that the servers were simply checking on us.

I come here often and so far I&#39;ve tried almost everything on their menu. 

My absolute favorite dishes here are the massaman curry and drunken noodles. 
The basil fried rice is packed with flavor as well. They really know how to utilize heat in their dishes when you ask them to make it spicy, which is something I love. So many Thai restaurants fail to add a proper amount of spice and seasoning. 

Tuk Tuk is my go to place when I&#39;m craving the richness and warmth of their massaman curry!

I also got the roti and massaman (my favorite). For the entree I got the pineapple and duck curry.  It was crispy portions of duck (a breast and two legs from what I can see), well seasoned, swimming in a pond of a curry made out of delicious herbs and spices mixed in coconut milk with pineapples,  and baby tomatoes.

3 things we tried:

1. Mango Cashew Chicken. This was served with rice. It was excellent.
2. Grilled Chicken Breast Kanom &amp; Jeen. I think this is what it was, except that there was salmon instead of the chicken breast. So good.
3. Charred Beef Salad. This wasn&#39;t even the main course, but probably my favorite of the three. The flavors are like burst of flavor kicking you in the mouth.

The first time I came here, our table ordered the vegetarian spring rolls with spicy sweet chili sauce, and my two friends ordered chicken pad thai, and tofu/ vegetarian pad kee mao.

The chicken satay was flavorful and the sauce was delicious, the stuffed curry puff was a tad bland, but aromatic.

One suggestion would be to check out their &#34;Explore&#34; dishes - a number of thai dishes that are staples in Thailand. Everything I have tried from that area of the menu was a new, and great foodie experience for me.

We usually order delivery, and the standard wait is about 30 minutes. I have not had a single problem with delivery here. The food is well packaged, hot, and fresh each time we order.

Staff was also a good part of the atmosphere. Always gentle and they never rushed us when we spent more time talking at the table.

We will be back."

When people say it&#39;s a hidden gem, this is really a &#34;hidden gem&#34; because it hides right in the middle of the busy street (Vernon Boulevard). It&#39;s hard to find the place because the Tuk Tuk sign was so small hanging sideways and the front banner didn&#39;t have the name Tuk Tuk. I told the waiter to make sure they can be easily seen. Anyway, a lunch with my friend went very well. She and I ordered the same green curry with tofu and vegetable. Woohoo! It was so green that I started to envy the color of green. It&#39;s the color of the lottery winners of 1.6 billion from the 3 states! So the curry came with soup and rice. The soup was unbelievably tasteful and unbelievably excellent! I forgot to ask what type of soup that is because I was busy talking, of course. They serve us a lunch portion just the right size to hold the tummy till dinner time. The curry they served was truly rich with a pure coconut taste and spicy as per our instructions. I&#39;m not sure what else went into that bowl but I was astounded. I&#39;d definitely recommend the place and hopefully readers can find the restaurant easily, it&#39;s next to the bike shop right after you get off the train on Vernon Boulevard. If you&#39;re in Manhattan, coming to LIC is not a problem at all, it&#39;s the first stop in Queens via the 7 train if you take 7 at Grand Central that&#39;s even better because it&#39;s only 1 stop, which is less than 5 minutes. You want the best green curry Thai style? This is it! We asked for spicy and that&#39;s what we got. A very good listener! I plan to come back here with hubby!"

Get the Pineapple Duck Curry! The duck is incredibly flavorful with a bit of a tiny bit of spicy kick to it. Texture of the meat was really crispy and I just love hearing that crunchy sound when I am chewing - excuse my lack of lady-manners! Curry dishes are flavorful and goes well with their jasmine rice. 

Pad See Ew with Shrimp. This is my favorite thing to order at any Thai restaurant. The smell was pleasant - the lovely spice aroma and slightly charred stir-fry flat noodles. It was not dry but not overly oily - this is a plus! Shrimp was jumbo and the amount they give was very generous!

Last but not least, the Thai Iced Tea. Just get it! It&#39;s simply that good!"

I absolutely loved everything at Tuk Tuk. We arrived without reservations on a Friday night and waited only about 20 minutes before being seated at a cozy spot. Not to mention that they have really friendly service and a comfy sofa that guests are welcome to wait for a table at and review the menu. This is a feature that many places need to incorporate because it just makes people way more willinging to wait.

The menu also grabbed our attention with so many spicy options and duck menu items which is sometimes a rarity.
My guy order the &#34;duckalicious&#34; which was recommended by our server over the pineapple duck curry. It&#39;s crispy baked duck served with jasmine rice and vegetables I. A delicous sauce. The duck was cooked perfectly and he loved it.

The Pad kee Mao that I ordered was also one of the best noodle dishes I&#39;ve had in a long time. I asked for it to be made extra spicy and they delivered! I love flat noodles and The flavors were all really vibrant. I also really appreciate when vegetables in a dish taste fresh instead of the frozen variety that some resturants cheap out on.

Tuk Tuk has really reseonable prices aswell and would make for a perfect date night when you don&#39;t want to spend a fortune. You can impress your date while ordering some more traditional thai dishes  from their &#34;explore&#34; section of the menu. That is what I&#39;m going to do next time because so many of those dishes were screaming out at me to eat them!"

We live in the neighborhood and we were coming here at least once a week. Every single time we had dinner here the food was pretty good, but we were rushed through our meal. The service is all about getting you to be done and out the door, to the point of being rude.
It&#39;s unfortunate. The food is decent and I liked that it was close to home. But after being treated so rudely and being pushed out the door as soon as possible every single meal, it become a turn off.
If you do eat here, only order one thing at a time, because thy will bring all the food at once and rush you to eat and get out.

And the last night was the final straw. We had our appetizer, our soup AND our Main Course on the table at the same time when they asked if we were Done!!!

I said, how about we take the check and one last glass of wine. Their answer was NO, we are closed! Mind you it was 10 minutes after closing time.

Seriously? 
I can&#39;t wait to tell every friend I have to avoid this rude restaurant. They clearly have no interest in friendly neighborhood service.

Definitely avoid this place unless you like to be rushed even if it&#39;s an hour before closing time."

I love Thai restaurants because they have great vegetarian options. I got the pineapple fried rice with veggies and tofu and the different variety of Veggies made the dish very hearty. My boyfriend got the green curry. On the menu, it was listed as &#34;very spicy&#34; and he enjoys spicy foods. However the curry barely tickled his tongue. And rice portion was also substantially less than the curry portion but I think the restaurant does that on purpose to make you buy another order of rice. 

The service was attentive and fast. We were never left waiting for a waiter to come around to get our order, refill our water and we didn&#39;t even wait long to get our food served.  This place would have gotten 5 stars but one of the waiters mocked me in a very rude way. I guess he wanted us to order extra drinks so when I said, &#34;no thank you, water is fine&#34;, with a smile, he walks away, mocks my exact words in a whiny voice to his coworker, they start laughing and talking in another language.

Food was ready as expected and the people were incredibly polite. I was also happy to see that they have a small beer and wine menu. 

Having lived Central NJ for some time and having had the opportunity to try a LOT of thai food, I had fairly high expectations and this place more than met them. The red curry is very flavorful with lots of chicken and veggies. The prices are extremely reasonable AND this place takes credit card which is a huge plus. Note: their version of mild and my version of mild are very different! However, the menu clearly says that the red curry is spicy so I can&#39;t imagine what the legit version of this dish tastes like but we&#39;ll leave that up to my imagination. 

Bottomline: good flavors, very reasonable prices, and extremely polite staff. If you&#39;re working in the LIC area, this is a must add to your list of good lunch places."

My meal of choice is the chicken pad thai (boring I know, but delicious). It&#39;s very well-done, and I&#39;ve been consistently pleased. The fact that I&#39;m here almost every week should be a testament to the quality.

The restaurant name had me thinking about my recent trip to Thailand and I was feeling nostalgic, so I couldn&#39;t resist. 

We were wandering around the LIC waterfront and stumbled in. The whole place was empty for a Saturday at 1:30pm and service was on point. Pleasantly greeted by the staff and I am assuming this place is family run. 

We both had the Tom Yum with chicken which was very good. Decent size portion and not overly filling like typical Thai you get outside of Thailand. It was on the milder side in terms of spiceness but still good flavor.

We decided to be adventurous and order off of the &#34;Thai Specialties&#34; menu, where they include their highly authentic Thai dishes (no substitutions or variability with spice). My husband had the spicy beef dish which had him sweating! We haven&#39;t had that kind of spice since our trip and it was nice to feel it again. I had the spicy shrimp dish and was very impressed. The flavor was a great but alas it was too spicy for me to finish. Glad I was adventurous though! 

They had plenty of steamed veggies on the side and a good serving of rice which helped with the spice. I would definitely be back if it is convenient!"

Tuk Tuk was one of the first options that showed up on our Yelp apps and happened to only be a few blocks away; as we didn&#39;t have many other alternatives in LIC and the reviews appeared to be fairly promising, we quickly headed over to the other side of Vernon Boulevard.

The interior of this restaurant is modest and bright, even during the evening; the white walls appear out of place, at first glance, but offer a nice contrast to the darkened floors and the &#34;traditional&#34; dining ambiance. When we arrived, there were only a few other diners present, so we were quickly seated and given menus and glasses of water for the night. We each decided on our own entrees, but decided to share one of their more popular mains as an appetizer of sorts, just to sate our curiosities.

First, the Kau Gling, which we shared as an appetizer. As one of the few options labeled &#34;Majorly Spicy&#34;, it was almost impossible for me to avoid ordering, and I somehow managed to persuade my friends to also join in the order. It&#39;s a dish comprised of stir-fried beef served with a variety of vegetables (cucumbers, broccoli, and string beans) and a scoop of white rice. While I didn&#39;t find it particularly spicy, the beef is tender and flavorful, with spice and acidity contributed by the lemongrass, tumeric, and Thai chilies added to the mix. The vegetables are simply steamed before plating, but were a nice contrast in between bites, and seemed to bring some relief to my friends.

And being a creature of habit, I decided on the Chicken Pad Thai (extra spicy, please) as my main. Our server had no problem noting the adjustment in spice levels, and in due time, a compact plate of steaming rice noodles was placed in front of me. There&#39;s all the typical ingredients that you&#39;d expect - diced tofu, crushed peanuts, egg, and crisp bean sprouts on the side - all in a compact, yet surprisingly hearty serving. I was delighted to find that my request had been taken seriously, and the additional dose of chili peppers was significantly present. From what I tried of the other dishes, they were all solid across the board; the roast duck was well-cooked with a crisp skin, and the steak was also surprisingly tasty, even though it was served with a nontraditional side of mashed potatoes.

While LIC doesn&#39;t have a dining scene that can compare to most areas of downtown Manhattan, it does have a few scattered gems throughout its neighborhood. Tuk Tuk is definitely one of these, serving quality Thai food at reasonable prices. It&#39;s a viable option when in the area, and might even be worth a separate trek even if you reside in another borough."

Do not, however, get their lunch specials. Just for a couple more dollars you get the full size instead of the smaller supposedly cheaper but not worth it size. 

Roti Pancake with Massamam dipping curry was average. Nothing special but completely edible. As well as the Hot Pot dumpling.

Massaman Curry with beef is a pretty good size with lots of vegetables and decent amount of meat in it. Spicy, yes. Filling, yes. Satisfying, maybe. Serves with white rice.

I have great memories of Shrimp fried rice from my trips to Bangkok and I guess nothing can beat authentic sidewalk Thai food. Theirs was pretty decent but I&#39;m always looking for that distinct taste. Maybe the water they used to boil the rice? Lol I&#39;m making this up. Lol

Yet every time I am in Long Island City and contemplating what to eat around here, Tuk Tuk is always the first to come to mind and I usually do end up here whether it is dining in or ordering out. 

My favorite dish? DUCK TAMARIND! Love everything about it. Delicious baked duck served with broccoli and cherry tomatoes with tamarind sauce. You are given half a duck that is boneless except for the drumstick and wing drummette. Put that sauce over some rice and you are in food heaven. I don&#39;t know why this Thai restaurant does not have sticky rice, but I suppose jasmine rice will do.

I had also ordered the lunch special (served Mon-Fri from 11:30am-3:00pm) which costs only $7 for an entree with the soup of the day. I have no idea what the soup was that came with my order but it tasted like Chinese herbs with a mix of Bengay! Not a fan! It was the color of butternut squash soup so I was secretly hoping it&#39;ll be that, but nope. The chicken pad thai did not come with peanuts on the side and was a bit more tamarind-y that most pad thais I have had, but it was still quite tasty and my niece and nephew enjoyed it very much.

I&#39;ve tried different curries from here as well including Massaman curry and green curry and it had always been satisfying.

PROS
1. Right next to the subway stop
2. When they offer you a veggie dish, they load it up with tons of fresh vegetables. 
3. The dishes were spicy, but also flavorful. They didn&#39;t overdo the oil or the peanut. We didn&#39;t order the super spicy dishes, but I have a feeling those would also have been excellent.
4. We got the mock duck salad as a started - it was amazing! The mock duck was crispy and incredibly tasty. This dish was probably the highlight of the meal."

I ordered the Roti Pancake with Massaman Curry for an appetizer, which was tasty, though a little sweeter than some of the other places I&#39;ve been to.  Ordered the Pad Cha Talay, which is a seafood dish and it was delicious. 

I like the food and the service was ok, though I was hoping the appetizer would come out before my entree.  Other than that, this is a good restaurant."

I&#39;ve dined-in and gotten take out from here several times now and most times, I&#39;ve been happy with my food choices.  I&#39;d give it overall 4.5 but must round down because only 1 visit grants it a full 5 stars.

4 star food:

Kau gling - EXTREMELY SUPER SPICY stir-fried beef with a side of steamed veggies.  If you like to sweat and not taste your food, this is for you.  It still tasted good and was well-seasoned, but I would not get this again as it was quite painful and my spice tolerance is quite high.

Special spicy seafood noodle soup - red, tangy broth.  I&#39;ve had much better at Pure Thai Cookhouse in Hell&#39;s Kitchen, but I&#39;ll give them credit for trying.

5 star food:

ANY OF THE DUCK DISHES!  My absolute favorite dish here is the pineapple duck curry.  It&#39;s got a spicy pineapple curry with vegetables with crispy duck on top - this is some good stuff if you like duck.  Similarly, their other duck dishes are very good as well.

Thai tea is affordable and you get a large serving - a little bit too thick and sweet, but still good with a spicy meal.

Tuk Tuk is always a staple LIC choice for me."

I didn&#39;t have a chance to give the menu a particularly thorough read because I had a case of noodle vision so everything else might as well not have existed. The noodle section wasn&#39;t too extensive, and I already knew I wasn&#39;t going to be ordering the pad thai (what has essentially become the California roll of Thai food) or pad see ew (your standard Chinese-inspired stir fry...snore) so with my sights set on something new, I came across their &#34;Explore&#34; section in the back. Perfect! I ultimately went with the Mee-Kiew-Hang, which according to the menu, is served just the way it is in Thailand. The flavors weren&#39;t particularly new but it was a good, solid noodle dish. Came with egg noodles, pork, wontons, and bok choy with some sort of soy-based sauce (?), lots of crushed peanuts, and a lime. Would order again.

The service was also great. Our waiter was *majorly nice, checking to see if we had everything we needed and constantly topping off our water. Overall, a good find!

I said nothing and swore off ordering from here again. I never complained because it was too much work. 

Today I was really craving falafel and tried one last time. I even wrote a note asking nicely please don&#39;t forget the tomatoes, thanks so much. 

Guess what they forgot- the tomatoes. I called they admitted they all saw the note and discussed it yet didn&#39;t put it on the food. They offered to bring me the tomatoes but the meal would have been cold and gross by then so they will give me half off - $4. Then they called and refunded my whole order which was nice of them and appropriate. 

It&#39;s a shame the food is delicious and fresh tasting but I would never order from here again unless you love when your order is wrong or you&#39;re a vegetarian who wants meat put in their food.  If I give them another chance hopefully I am proven wrong about their service."

We were a group of 4 and ate around 12:30-1pm (or so) and we managed to snag a corner of a table together.

The food was really delicious; I had a wrap with the spicy meat, veggies, hummus, sauce, I don&#39;t even know exactly what, they kept asking if I wanted things and I kept saying yes. Non-picky-eater-problems. The the end result was fantastic! My little sister got the falafel as she is a vegetarian and she said it was great. My mom didn&#39;t love her lamb, but I tried it and I loved the flavor. It definitely doesn&#39;t just taste like beef, that&#39;s for sure. My older sister loved her meal as well, until she had some digestive issues later. Not sure if the food is what caused it, but maybe just a warning. Don&#39;t eat on a sensitive stomach.

My go-tos are the hummus, onion parsley sumac mix, a bit of the garlic whip, and of course lots of spicy green sauce, which is the star of the show.

I tried to get the rice bowl (made with vermicelli rice) but for some reason they were out of rice so
I got the pita, which was huge and probably a million calories. Pita options are whole wheat or white. For protein I had the sujuk which is ground beef seasoned and formed into a log. I swear, it tastes better than it looks. The meat was a little bit dry, but everything else in the sandwich tasted fresh and yummy. After creating my sandwich they put on a panini press looking thing to warm it, which is a good idea but the line got backed up.

They have various types of meat and they have great seasonings for their pita wraps or rice bowls (you choose.) The rice bowl is not super interesting to me, as the rice is not seasoned beyond the sauces you put on it, but I do enjoy the pita bread, garlic whip, and onions and sumac. The price is right, you are out the door for about $9 for a fairly filling lunch. They have packaged side dishes for sale, but warning: they all cost about $5 apiece for a fairly small box. I don&#39;t think they can have a good turnover here at these prices, they should perhaps change their selection and pricing so they can be bundled with the set meals and it would become more interesting for everyone."

It&#39;s a special occasion for me to drop $10 on lunch, but it&#39;s worth it here. Generous portions of very fresh ingredients. Friendly service helped walk me through the selections. Meat was tender and flavorful and asking for extra jalapeños actually lead to extra jalapeños. He even asked &#34;is this a good amount?&#34;

I go heavy on the hommus (2 scoops) and the tahini. I generally skip the red and green sauces because I load up on tahini, though the sauces also are good."

-- Food is excellent overall. I had the frittata, which was delicious and filling. Others in our group of 6 had the burger, the waffles, and the haloumi eggs. The orange juice was delicious and fresh. Everyone was quite pleased with their food.

-- Servers are friendly.

-- Prices are reasonable.

-- Ambiance is nice although a bit noisy.

-- This places loses one star for telling us the wait would be 30 minutes when in reality we waited for more than an hour. 

Cafe Mogador is good but not wait-an-hour good. We might return during a less busy time."

My entree, the Lamb Tagine.. gosh, sooo good! It was a huge portion of meat, falling off the bone, perfectly seasoned! The sauce was a tad sweet at first bite but went really well with the buttery couscous.. Polished it all off! Others in the group had pancakes, Mediterranean eggs and Bloody Marys.. all good! We were then joined by more friends and moved to the garden lounge area in the back - couches under a nice green house sort of canopy, some gooey chocolate cake, cocktails and a hot chocolate... decadent! 
Service was pleasant and efficient throughout and the decor was pretty.. so all in all, 5 stars if I ignore the wait for a table!"

I was expecting a longer wait for a table, but we were seated in about 10 minutes. Loved the atmosphere here, and even though it looks nicer in the back, there&#39;s no wrong seat in the house.

We started with the garlic shrimp and they were awesome. We also had the fried corn cake which I couldn&#39;t get enough of. 

I was really looking forward to eating the hangar steak, but unfortunately, they were out of it, so I was very disappointed. In the end, I ended up ordering the Salmon which had a ton of great flavor (and I&#39;m not even a fish eater!). It was served with a carrot puree and lemon yogurt. I would definitely recommend that dish.

For dessert, I had the chocolate cake with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice-cream, and it was delicious!

I&#39;m not in Williamsburg too often, but I will definitely keep this place in mind next time I&#39;m in the area."

When we came here we sat in the back garden. The food is amazing, really fresh and tasty Mediterranean food! We didn&#39;t have reservations and were lucky to grab a table immediately. I would though call next time because they get really busy. When we left they had an hour wait! 

The staff is super nice and help picked out some of our dinner.

We ordered a bunch of great food. For apps
2 dips: hummus, babbaganouh with fresh hot flat bread it was so yummy. The dips were fresh flavored authentic I wish there was a bigger portion. the bread was addicting! 

We also ordered falafel it was fried crispy goodness moist in the middle and perfect with the tahini. 

We also order a special a Halloumi app with grilled bread an fennel pollen it was good but not what we expected but def delicious

For entree 

We had the lamb with chickpeas and rice. What a great dish. The meat fell off the bone and the sauce was rich and delicious. I couldn&#39;t stop eating it. The portion was good for two. Not knowing how big the lamb was we also ordered another entree.

Duck confit with salad and French fries. I love duck and this was so amazing. It was done right! Again, the meat was falling off the bone and seasoned perfectly. The salad was a bit over seasoned but a minor detail to this wonderful dish. I would have loved another veg instead of fries with this. But they were exacuted perfectly. 
 
Overall this restaurant is elegant from the ambience to the food. The staff again is nice, accommodating and not overly on top of you. I would def check this place out. Btw parking is a tad difficult!(255)"

i was immediately sat down and the waitress was very nice and polite. They have an outdoor garden area which is very lovely, and I&#39;d recommend going there if it&#39;s available. There was no line, and the outdoor bar recommended to try the Rose from their wine selection.

I absolutely loved the decor the moment I walked in. They were rather busy at lunch service but a waitress came over and had us seated right away. We did request if they had outdoor seating but the back was full so we took indoor seats. 

Once we were seated a bus boy came over with two glasses of water and that&#39;s where the good service ended. We sat for about 10 minutes while waitstaff kept passing by but no one thought to bring us menus. After 10 minutes and me being a little frustrated I flagged down a waiter who graciously brought us some menus. 

Not even 5 seconds of our menus being on our tables a waitress comes over and asks if we&#39;re ready to order. I found that quite comical even though it wasn&#39;t actually funny. 

Finally, we go through the menu and YAY! They have the couscous that I love. When our waitress came back, we ordered a bunch of apps. Hummus, Babganush, Falafel, Pita, Pickles &amp; Olives. We then ordered the vegetarian couscous, a glass of red and one Rośe. 

The only reason I cannot give this place 5 stars is for service. The food was absolutely delicious. I, who is not a fan of hummus and Babganush really really enjoyed it. The taste and textures were all very pleasing. The falafel was just as tasty. 

I used to get the vegetarian couscous at a different Cafe but they stopped selling it. Now that I found it here at Mogador, aside for service, I am completely sold! They cook the couscous in butter which gives it a soft and airy texture as well as delicious tastes from the cooked veggies piled on top. A definite must get. 

I really do like this place. I just wish service would be that bit better."

The layout is modern, clean and refined. They clearly did away with all Moroccan decor and leaned toward the style of their emigrants... France. The backyard is the highlight - windowed walls with greenery and heaters. It&#39;s a unique and beautiful space. 

One thing though before I discuss the food (because I got triggered reading many other reviews)

It&#39;s Moroccan *fusion* food - not &#34;middle eastern&#34; and **certainly** not down home &#34;authentic&#34;. Moroccan food is spicier than other cuisines from the &#34;Middle East&#34;. Morocco is in Africa remember. 

Does one go around wanting &#34;European food&#34;? Or instead- Italian food, Greek food, French food, etc...?

Ok so now that we we have unpacked Global North hegemony as it relates to food - onto the food. 

It was TASTY! 

The mixed platter was divine and beautiful to look at (I especially loved the eggplant). But the best part was the spicy sauce (harrissa?) that was served on the side. I had to ask for more - because it just took each flavor up a notch. 

I also enjoyed my grilled calamari special. It was light - *definitely* a fusion item, nonetheless still tasty. 

The key lime pie dessert was a fail - that&#39;s why I took off a star. The crust was lackluster and reminded me of a French tarte and the filling was way too creamy with very little tart lime taste. We were disappointed about that and wished that there were more Moroccan fusion desserts. 

I&#39;ll be back though - and will load up on the savory so as to avoid the sweet."

They didn&#39;t officially have &#34;shakshouka&#34; on the menu, but the waitress suggested a makeshift one with: Poached eggs (substitute pita) with a side of Moroccan sauce ($13.50 total). I had wanted to try this staple Northern African dish, and was deliciously satisfied with the meal. 

The place we were seated was also great. It was a small, roofed outdoor enclosure that had plenty of light yet was cool enough with fans/AC to stay comfortable."

First it has a Moroccan/Lebanese/Isreali influences so there are food items like hummus, labna, shakshooka, halloumi and fresh olives and a bunch more stuff.  

We had the halloumi with poached eggs and shakshooka ( they call it eggs in red sauce or something but it&#39;s basically shakshooka). With a side if lebna, pita bread and cappuccinos.

We waited with some falafel, humus and baba ghanoush which were all fantastic. I could just keep going with these all night. 

We were then seated at a large round table for 6 but there were only 4 of us so it was nice to have that space. Since I was somewhat full I ordered a mixed grill to share and taste. Once again, fantastic. Perfectly cooked.

The drinks menu is also very good with something for everyone and on a very elevated level. Whether you like cocktails, fine wine, or craft beer, they have it all.

Our waitress was very nice, offering to refill our bread. She interacted minimally but was extremely polite, which I always prefer. Glass of wine was solid. Will go back again and again. Will tell everyone that will listen to me about this place."

Lovely ambiance and clean flavors that are not over umami&#39;d. The Williamsburg location is a bit more elevated than its St Marks predecessor...  really enjoyed their tagine (lamb and vegetable) but most notable are the dips and sauces. An array of French-Moroccan spices create succulent and savory braised meats and broths juxtaposed cool creamy cucumber yogurt. The menu has been battle tested and the ambiance doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s forced or &#34;trying too hard&#34;, as many restaurants with extremely underwhelming menus do.

No!  They were not helpful, or patient with helping me choose from the menu...      we finally decided to go for the lamb tangine and couscous, and a hot cider,  

The couscous was dry, we had to ask for a broth to pour on top,  the lamb lacked a lot in flavour, and was kinda dry,  for sure had better lamb in my life,  and the cider was one of the worst I have ever had....  (don&#39;t know how you can mess up ciders so bad!!!)

Recommendations:
Moroccan iced tea - if you like mint, definitely try this
Babaghanoush - smokey eggplant dip with soft fresh pita
Duck confit - super crisp skin and tender meat served with balsamic reduction and excellent French fries
Bastilla - a unique sweet and savory dish of chicken, egg and nuts wrapped in filo dough and dusted with cinnamon and sugar
Lamb tagine - obviously
Orange and almond cake - lightly sweet and very refreshing

Everything is overall well executed and makes for a memorable meal. This place and Smorgasburg are pretty much the only reasons I would venture into the terrifyingly hip land that is Williamsburg. Seriously, I saw a guy with light up roller skates on my way out."

We got lucky with Cafe Mogador. 

It&#39;s beautiful Moroccan design was comfortable and romantic. The dining area towards the back was a tropical green house secured by giant wooden beams, decorated with colorful pillows/textiles, and magnificent plants throughout. I felt completely transported. 

We ordered a round of drinks-all delicious. I had the tequila-based &#34;El Guapo Diablo&#34; which had an excellent cayenne pepper kick to it and finished the night with a glass of red wine. 

Our table ordered literally every appetizer off the menu because we couldn&#39;t decide on any one item and so we decided to order a ton of food to share. I still dream of those mussels and shrimp! For entrees, we ordered the lamb tangine (of course!) and a dinner special that I can&#39;t recall, but everything was absolutely amazing. I have never been to a place where the entire table can equally agree that everything brought out had been incredible. 

I was only visiting New York at the time and only upon leaving realized that I never took down the name of the restaurant we happened upon that night. So began my search. I literally researched for weeks until I found this heavenly place online so that I could 1) come back when I visit again 2) make sure everyone knows how fantastic this place is. Go in and you wont regret it!

The music is nice. The interiors were nicer. Try sitting in the large enclosed patio seating area in the rear of the restaurant. 

Peter ordered the hummus to start. Delicious hummus, but be warned. They only give you one small pita with this. A little scant in my opinion.

He followed up the hummus with the Chicken Grill. This dish smelled exceptional. The two chicken skewers were politely tucked into a bed of basmati rice. This smelled nice. The side salad also smelled nice. I say smell because I didn&#39;t try Peter&#39;s meal. Didn&#39;t want to lie to you. You know? 

I chose the Middle Eastern Eggs. Poached. This may not be the best time to bring this up, but you should ALWAYS ask for poached eggs regardless of where you&#39;re eating. Remember this. The more eggs we poach, the less animals are poached in Africa. There&#39;s a direct correlation...or something. Mogador saves wildlife. I digress. The eggs were poached well. The salad, tabouli, and zahatar pita/hummus, all of which accompany the eggs: yummo. 

Great, fresh food served quickly and kindly.

Enjoy good company (hopefully).
Save wildlife.

I met up with a friend here at 11:45am for your standard Saturday brunch. I told her if she got there early to request a table with an abundance of natural light (because I like to take photos and incandescent yellow light is horrendous). The hostess was incredibly helpful, giving us two options and letting us know with repeated updates when our table would be ready.

The vibe is lively. I can&#39;t place the decor, it&#39;s friendly meets homey meets antiquey in the front meets Hell&#39;s Kitchen Hotel Lounge in the back. The oversized large fronds from the Bird of Paradise plant (at least I think that&#39;s what it is) doesn&#39;t help. 

I order Moroccan Benedict pre-fixe with the orange juice and cappuccino. My friend orders the   Middle Eastern Eggs. The dishes come out and it&#39;s a hefty portion size, you&#39;re not going to leave hungry. They also come out pretty promptly, thank gaaaawd. 

My friend regales me for about 40 minutes with her friend drama and we never felt rushed out the door even though the wait to get in was clearly getting longer as the doorway and front of the restaurant were slowly filling with people. This is also why I recommend brunching before noon. That way you&#39;re not waiting 90 minutes because there are tables like mine that spend their time leisurely eating their food while going into lengthy detail to color context on drama.

The potato homefries were surprisingly my favorite part of my dish... and my friend&#39;s zahatar pita with hummus I couldn&#39;t get enough of. If only carbs were good for you."

What to get: Lamb or Chicken Tagine with traditional sauce and Couscous
And: There&#39;s a Manhattan location of this place too
What else: Don&#39;t get confused and order a &#34;Tangerine with Couscous.&#34; You can buy those at the grocery store nearby, and it&#39;s a lot cheaper.

Cafe Smogador is the Los Angeles equivalent of this place. It has much better air conditioning, is full of models and Mexicans (and Mexican models) and the advantage is that at any time of year, you can hit the beach after a meal, with a belly full of couscous.

This is basically good, slightly gentrified Morroccan food at New York City prices (specifically Williamsburg prices). I&#39;ve eaten here twice (although one was the Manhattan location), and I can say that both the Lamb and the Chicken Tagine are:

(a) delicious
(b) have a lovely sauce (traditional style)
(c) portions are too small
(d) overpriced
(e) couscous is cooked perfectly

Cafe Logad, OR is the Portland Oregon version of this place. It&#39;s full of Lumbersexuals and people named Jacks, doing Jack-like things such as felling trees, felling each other up, and Jack-ing the way only Jacks can.

That&#39;s about all there is to it really. You&#39;re going to be paying 15-25 here for food, and I wish it were under 10 for something because then I&#39;d eat here more often. The prices are comparable to the amazing North African food in Paris, but thankfully, so is the taste. Unfortunately, the portions are not.

Cafe Fogador is the San Francisco version of this place. It&#39;s on Alcatraz Island, and once you dine there, you can never leave, unless you&#39;re Sean Connery and even then you have to swim the f***ing channel so you&#39;re f***ed either way.

You have a choice of 3 or 4 different sauces with the Tagine. I highly recommend the traditional, which is a little sweet featuring Sultanas and such, but is authentic and delicious. The other options seem to me modern &#34;inventions&#34; to try and please the Americans, and that never floats my boat. I may try the Cilantro sauce at some point (I think that was one of the options). Note that by Sultanas I do not mean Sultans, 

Cafe Smaug-ador is not very popular. In fact it&#39;s desolate. Mogador on the other hand is much more popular.

For someone that doesn&#39;t even like Hobbit/Lord Of Rings stuff, and has never seen a single movie or read a single book connected with it... there were an awful lot of Dildo jokes in this review. Oh crap, I meant Bilbo. See? I totally am a Tolkein amateur. I&#39;m also a toking amateur too because I&#39;ve never done drugs in my life. But you don&#39;t need to know that. You just need to know that you should come here and order a Tagine."

Took us 2hrs from we were seated to finish eating and that&#39;s not because we were talking a lot. Other than long wait, service was good."

This one looks a little bit bigger than the one in Manhattan. They gave us a 25 minutes waiting time but we actually waited 10min. We transfered our drinks to our table and ordered very quickly:couscous merguez and the tajine prune and apricot. I came with my father as he is a big fan of Mediterranean cuisine. He can&#39;t find anything good in Chicago were he lives but was so happy to taste something close enough to what you can find in Tunisia or Algeria... my cocktail was pretty good. His was ok. Very salty. (I dont remember the name i think it was something like &#34;stormy.something..&#34; ). The service was good.  the waitress was very nice and professional. The music was the 80/90s classic. Arabic music would have been better. We started with the eggplant and tahini appetizer which was small but good for 1 or 2 stomach. The pitas were soft and warm.  The dishes were amazingly delicious. Flavored merguez and lamb. I just wished they could put more couscous with the tajine and more harissa on the side as i like hot harissa with the meat. Not sure but i think they forgot the broth. I think i got the broth on the side at the cafe mogador east village.  On the desert part: we had the orange cake which i like because not too sweet and the rhubarb crumble with the ice cream. 
My bill for 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 deserts was at $89 + tips."

A Moroccan and Mediterranean restaurant that started in East Village, now has an outpost in Williamsburg.
Perfect place for a date, double date, dinner with friends or family. They have a wonderful greenhouse seating in the back. Amazingly popular.

Tip: Come early to beat the crowd, around 5-6pm. 

The food: 
Amazing lamb chops, tender juicy chicken, tender bowlful of PEI mussels where you want to sop up all sauce with bread.
The only item that I wished I didn&#39;t order was the lamb meatballs. $10 for 3 quarter sized meatballs. Yes they were tender, but over salted and unsatisfying. 

Had an amazing time with my hubby and great friend.
Wish I could eat here every other day."

As far as food goes, we had the beets and eggplant tahini as starters. Beets  were great. But the eggplant tahini was just so so. Eggplant with tahini on top should compliment each other but not in this case. The tahini definitely overpowered the eggplants. As for the main we shared the lamb tangine with apricot and prune sauce. Was definetely looking forward to eating the dish. In the end it was just so so. The lamb was dry and the sauce didn&#39;t really do it for me."

The food (with the exception of the dessert dish we&#39;ve tried) was great but the service was extremely disappointing. My date was excited to be there and so was I , after hearing all the great things I was hearing from him. From the moment, the hostess was seating us to the moment we had a dessert (which was overly sweet, and after sharing one bite, we shared our disapproval and was offered the fact that she wasnt going to take it off the bill anyhow), service here was disappointing. 

Service is what ruined the thought of my return."

I got a smoked salmon bagel that tasted okay, but was very poorly prepared. It looked like they just threw a bunch of ingredients on the plate and served it. 

They do not offer any substitutions (even switching between different drinks on the prix fixe menu despite the fact that the drinks are the same price). 

The service was absolutely awful. The waitress came over to take our order, my friend asked a question, then we discussed for a couple seconds and the waitress walked away. She came back 5-10 min later, took our order and walked away. We didn&#39;t see her again until she dropped the check on our table. 

The drinks were overpriced and incredibly small. 8 oz soda. 4-5 oz orange juice.

i enjoyed the overall ambiance of this place, it was full of natural light with a crisp cozy feel.

we started out with the hummus and mixed platters along with 2 orders of falafel for the table to share. we did have to ask for some more pita as the first round of pita didnt have enough to give everyone their own piece. the hummus was very tasty along with the tabouli salad. 

for entrees people got a mix of the stews and grill options. i found the basmati rice and cous-cous to be cooked perfectly and very flavorful. for the lamb grill they asked for temps, but everything seemed to come out medium. overall the protein was flavored nicely. the grill entrees leaned toward the pricier side when you consider how basic it really is. 

service here could use some improvement. our waitress was unattentive and missed out on the opportunity to jack up her auto gratuity by failing to keep the alcohol flowing, oh well her loss."

It looks small from the outside, but it&#39;s a pretty large restaurant with a big back area that is like an enclosed garden. I recommend trying to sit back there if you can.

Many people below said that the portions are huge, but I thought they were just right. Each person can have one entree to himself. I recommend the grill chicken most highly - the chicken is perfectly grilled and mixes really well with the vegetables (especially grilled onion) and rice they give you, plus you get a small salad on the side. I would also recommend the chicken cous cous, which is basically a couple chicken legs with cous cous and several large pieces of vegetables (potato, sweet potato, zucchini, etc.) All of the vegetables were so delicious and fresh tasting. Finally, I would recommend the mango martini, which tastes just like you&#39;re eating mango sorbet.

This place does not take reservations for small parties, but we were able to get a table for 2 around 7:30/8 on a Tuesday immediately. Service was very quick too, even though the place was packed."

The eggplant was well cooked, not burnt like a lot of other roasted eggplant dishes from other restaurants. The hummus was good; I wouldn&#39;t say great.

The back atrium/greenhouse is a warm, wannabe botanical garden where you have no choice but to sit comfortably and enjoy bold middle eastern-inspired dishes as you brush against palm fronds and other flora and fauna. Everyone else is happy; it&#39;ll rub off on you too. Brunch is ridiculously easy with a convenient combo option for $17 that gives you a glass of fresh OJ, a tasty egg dish (in my case, a Moroccan Benedict) and a much needed espresso.

The food is as good as the one in East Village. I order the salad nicoise which came with grilled salmon (ordered it rare!) and it was aaaaamazing. The babaganoush is superb and comes with warm pita bread. 
The soup of the day was a total finding: butternut squash and turnip. Wow! Delicious.

All options are $6 or less and all options come with a ton of food for the price. I grew up eating Chinese bbq as much as I ate cereal so I love me some seared meats. The holy trinity of Chinese bbq is roasted pork, cha siu, and roasted duck. Wah Fung has all those plus a soy sauce chicken option. You can mix and match the different types of protein that is topped on white rice and boiled cabbage.

I got the holy trinity. The quality is definitely not top shelf, but it sure did get the job done. I would get the cha siu first, pork second, and skip out on the duck. It brought me back to my childhood and had me feeling well fed at a crazy price point.

Looking for NYC&#39;s best cheap eats? You need to get some Wah Fung."

This shop have been around for years. Students and old timers love to come here for the $3.75 special of BBQ roast pork/chicken with rice and veggies. This is all day special. I just order the small box for lunch. The guy that works here is fast and efficient. He chops the BBQ roast pork and chicken so fast. I know his arm is strong but all the years of cutting may hurt his arm. The lines are long everyday. Yesterday when I went the line moved quickly. The owner hired another guy to help him with the orders. In the past it was the owner and wife. This place is still popular and affordable for everyone in chinatown. Good place to get comfort food. Been here a few times and will come back for the Mai fun. They ran out of it yesterday.

For only $5-$6 you can get a heaping box of  roast duck, pork, and/or chicken with rice and boiled cabbage. It is an insane amount of food for the price. I could only finish half of one and was absolutely stuffed after.

The duck is extremely delicious, with crispy skin on the outside and tender juicy meat on the inside. They also pour some of the broth atop the meat and rice, so the everything is infused with the deep aroma of duck. I even enjoyed the cabbage a lot - it was soft and cooked and soaked up the duck broth well. 

My second favorite meat was actually the chicken, and last was the pork. The pork was basically char siu, which is always yummy but you can really find that anywhere. 

If you&#39;re in Chinatown and feeling hungry, I definitely recommend checking out wah fung. Heck, even if you&#39;re from uptown or outside the city I think it&#39;s worth the trip! I know I will be making the trek back in the not-so-far future."

Didn&#39;t realize how well received this tiny little stall was until I looked up on Yelp and decided to come back later in the afternoon to try out their delicious BBQs

At around 5pm the line was only maybe 5-10 min wait, hardly worthy the name of &#34;Fast Food&#34; but the food is definitely well worth waiting for. While watching the butchers chopping up our order the meat simply looked mouth watering as it was marinated one last time in the sauces.

The price alone is enough to warrant it a try. A small box of bbq pork + rice for only $3.75? Even in Chinatown that&#39;s a pretty ridiculous deal. We ended up getting the full size combo box at $5.50 plus two pounds of BBQ pork ($8.50/lb) and the food is absolutely amazing, especially the sauce on the side they were very generous about it.

This place is cash only but you only need 3.75$ for a platter which comes with rice and a side.

$3.75 for small roast pork over rice or a chicken over rice. You can opt for noodles as a substitute. They give you a ton of meat over the rice. They pack it in real good inside the small container. Mine you also get vegetables with that. It&#39;s a perfect balance meal. 

I had to feast on both the roast pork and the chicken. 
The chicken was juicy and tender. The real star was the roast pork. That roast pork was so succulent, flavorful, juicy, tender, and melts in your mouth. Love the rice because it absorbs the sauces that they put into the dish. 

The place is really small, so there will be lines forming outside the restaurant. They are fast in making the dishes.

How can you beat $3.75 for a dish that can be your lunch and dinner. 

Yes I did eat all of the chicken and roast pork. Food coma!"

One of my friends told me that the place started out as a street cart and the owner increases the price by a quarter depending on gas/oil market prices. 

For $3.75, you can choose Roast Pork or Chicken w/ Cabbage over choice of Rice/Noodles. You can choose to have no cabbage. The food comes in a small aluminum take out box(there&#39;s no seats here), but the portion size is a lot! I usually get Roast Pork(Char Siu) w/ Cabbage over Rice. The roast pork tastes not too sweet and is really flavorful. I&#39;ve also tried the Roast Chicken, but it was too salty for me. The rice is fresh from the rice cooker. It&#39;s texture is moist and cohesive, and not fall-apart grainy. The cabbage helps to wash down the heaviness from all the meat. You really get your money&#39;s worth!"

I&#39;ve actually been back 2x recently since I&#39;ve watched a couple of YouTube videos.. The latest from the Fung Bros making it seem like they really have some of the best char siu over rice. I didn&#39;t believe Mike Chen and seriously Fung Bros...best in class?

I went back a 2nd time since my older brother said how great it was and I needed to prove him wrong. Also I haven&#39;t had char siu for almost a year. It was definitely better than my first visit. I went in and I ordered in Chinese...The younger dude working there kinda creeped me out a lil staring at me. Even L noticed. Ordered a large and it was enough for 3 meals for me. Wasn&#39;t sliced as thin and wasn&#39;t as saucy/sweet as the first time which I prefer. However the quality of the pork is on the lower end. Fatty and pieces of gristle. Good quality char siu should not have gristle.. I should&#39;ve asked for leaner pieces.

My most recent visit and maybe my last, I wanted to try their soy sauce chicken. I was served by the older gentleman.. The younger guy just went on a lunch break. Ordered a small char siu over rice with veggies as well as one with soy sauce chicken. 

I like that they wear gloves while handling the food. They take the glove off when they handle money and change to a new glove after it gets really greasy. One piece of chicken fell on the table while he was slicing and I appreciate that he did not put it in my box. It was quickly brushed away. 

It&#39;s $3.75 for a small box. $5.50? for a large... It&#39;s cheap, but no it&#39;s not the best char siu. It&#39;s just okay. I don&#39;t really like the sauce they put on top of the meat. It&#39;s too greasy. Again the meat quality is an issue for me. I&#39;d rather pay a lil more and not have to deal with gristle. Like the Fung Bros said..this is not your traditional char siu.. It&#39;s a sweeter version. Also I did not like the soy sauce chicken at all. I&#39;ve had much better. 

Lastly the line hasn&#39;t been that bad.. Prob less than a 10 min wait around 6pm? If you&#39;re on a budget, a small is enough for 2 meals. 

I grew up in Chinatown, my father was in the restaurant business so this is just okay for me... My mom would rather go next door for authentic Chinese bbq even though I&#39;ve never been there myself since it&#39;s a B.. 

I most likely wouldn&#39;t come back until at least another year later..."

It reminds me of really great southern barbecue thrown into a Chinese barbecue joint.

The place says it closes at 6pm but they kept serving past them. There was a long line the entire time we were there but the two guys worked hard to move it as fast as they could.

Wah Fung sells a variety of meats. Pork, chicken, and duck. The biggest sellers are the pork and chicken. 

The big draw here is that for $3.75, you get a small tin of rice, cabbage, and your choice of meat. You can also do half and half of two meats. The small is actually pretty big and is a good size meal. They pack those small containers with alot of food. As a sidenote, ask for the green sauce on top of your meal.

The quality of the meat is decent and it tastes pretty good.

There&#39;s usually a line in front of the store that takes anywhere from 15 mins to 30 mins, but its worth the wait.

There&#39;s seating and tables in the park across the street to eat at on a nice day. If that isn&#39;t an option or isn&#39;t appealing, you can take your order to go, as this place is takeout only."

Both were delicious but I liked the former a bit more than the latter. The chicken is very juicy and tender. The pork is just a tiny bit on the sweeter side.

Once you get inside, the space is cramped. Be prepared to order once you enter inside. They have various meats you can choose from: roast pig, char siu, chicken, and duck. I got to try the roast pig and char siu this time. The portions are mighty hefty for the price. $4 for the roast pig and $3.75 for the char siu.

What makes this place stand out to me is how thinly they slice the meats. Most roast meats places tend to chop in chunks; wah fung slices them. Now the food. The roast pig was by far my favorite! I didn&#39;t realize what a difference it makes when you slice the meat in comparison to eating it thicker. The fat really stands out (in a good way I promise) and pairs really nicely with the rice.

The chicken thighs were falling apart, savoury and sweet with a teriyaki style sauce. It was oh so greasy good. As the sauce worked its way down, the yellow lomein noodles happily soaked up this sauce. It beautifully combined with the oil inherent in the lomein. 

This was enough for two lunches. 

I really enjoyed this meal. It&#39;s a great choice for lunch in Chinatown.

My recommendation is to order the pork large with rice for lunch and save any leftovers for dinner! It&#39;s delicious enough that you can also probably finish it all in one go regardless. 

For people looking to just buy the meat/buy in larger quantities without rice, you can get roughly two boxes of pork or duck for ~$15. Actual prices depend on the type of meat, as pork is cheaper.

Not only is the food ridiculously delicious, but it&#39;s also RIDICULOUSLY cheap. PRAISE PRAISE PRAISE. For just 5 buckaroos, you get enough roast pork to last you for days (okay, okay, just 2 meals for me because I&#39;m a fatass, but I&#39;m sure most normal people can portion that out to more meals for sure), cabbage and rice.

I would love to get more of nappa. The portion was large based on the price. 
Service was not bad. The staff was nice. 
I have tried other restaurants in Chinatown, but this place was better than going to sit down restaurants in my opinion. If you want roasted pork/chicken, I would recommend this place!"

It&#39;s the cheapest, most delicious meal you&#39;re going to get. Blows Halal Guys out of the park.

For $3.75, you get a healthy portion of BBQ pork on top of white rice and cabbage. And it&#39;s the tender, juicy, ultra flavorful BBQ pork, not your lame-ass too fatty or too skinny kind. The napa cabbage perfectly matches that greasy, oily, oh-so-delicious pork, too, so you cut that richness with some more staid flavors.

Who needs an eating area, too? Grab your takeout, and your utensils and napkins, and wander over to the park where you can watch he next up-and-comers ball their way to their own hoop dreams. Beats overpriced hot dogs and the Knicks, right?"

We were met with a line up on a weekend day around 1pm, composed of people from young to old, locals and out-of-towners, so we knew right away it was going to be good.  

All menu items were cheap, but each had abundance of food to fill you up...they do not shy away from topping up your take-out box with meat...frankly, I don&#39;t know how they maintain profitable with this amount of meat!!!  To balance out the richness of meat, you are given lightly seasoned vegetable and puffy steamed rice for each menu item.  Because I could not commit to any particular meat (pork, chicken, duck) and didn&#39;t have room to eat three meals, I got the 3-in-1 option (you pay $1-$1.5 more), and was left satisfied and full for the rest of the day.  Having tried few Chinatown BBQ places in NYC and other cities, I&#39;d say the meat here has a hint of (just the right amount) of honey sweetness to it. 

Would 100% come back again the next time. 

Remember, this place is famous for its cheap take-out, it got its high rating because tastiness of food, so keep your expectation on service low.

For visitors of NYC, if you are trying out this place, I&#39;d recommend eating your take-out across the street on one of the benches facing the basketball courts for some people watching while you eat. This take-out is a staple of Chinatown NYC, if not the broader NYC."

There&#39;s also a separate cart inside that serves lo mein, rice noodles, fishballs, etc. So many options and you can order any one for under $5!!

Decent bbq meats across from the park on Chrystie Street.  Unfortunately, that the meats are done well is probably driving a minority of the 4.5 Yelp* rating as of July 2016, with the rest being this conception that Wah Fung is fantastically cheap.  In fact, the value is good but actually not out of this world -- I would actually call the pricing slightly above the average around NYC and only somewhat cheap in the context of Manhattan Chinatown.  You can debunk this perception after having been to enough places by consider their pricing on the whole duck, chicken, and bbq pork (per pound) options.  In fact, what&#39;s really got everyone in a tizzy is the ability to avoid paying for form factor -- you can walk away with only a few cuts of meat over a bed of basic cabbage and rice in a scaled down format without getting charged a big percentage premium for it.  It&#39;s also not super clean, as more than once I&#39;ve pulled out lint from the food.  

There aren&#39;t many $3.75 (chicken/pork)-4.25 (duck) meal options around, but there are enough $5-7 large pork/duck plates that lead me to like Wah Fung but not find it mind blowing."

Got the $3.75 roast pork special, without the rice and just vegetables because I love the flavor they get in the cabbage. I opted out of the sauce that they usually drizzle over the top because I could see that it was getting a little too greasy.  The bbq roast pork was yummy though and there was plenty of it to go around. Just when you think that there&#39;s enough pork on there, he starts chopping up more and fitting it in the box. 

The line moves a little slow so if you&#39;re in a rush this place might not be ideal. I was there at about 230pm and waited for about 10 minutes. Worth the wait considering the amount of food you get for the price you&#39;re paying. Yum!"

I&#39;m talking about both the food containers AND the hole in the wall; amazing cheap food in chinatown :D definitely not what you call a nice or clean restaurant, but who cares, the food is amazing.

I&#39;ve always wanted to come here, but it was always so out of the way. But today, after a nearby orthodontist appointment, I swung by this place around noon and I was so glad I did! There is basically no line if you go early, but during peak lunch times, I hear the wait is probably around 10-15 minutes. The storefront is really, really small, not much space inside to stand around. There were only 2 people behind the counter when I went, that&#39;s probably why the wait is so long.

They have a couple of menu selections, ALL TAKE-OUT ONLY. They have an all day special, which I got today: choice of roast pork or chicken over rice/noodles with napa cabbage - all for $3.75!!! The container may look small, but trust me, they pack it so tight and definitely pile it up until the heap is much higher than the container will fit. I thought he was done after he cut some up the first time and put it over the rice...he then quickly proceeds to cut up some more and stack it on top of the already big pile of meat!!! 

After packing on the roast pork, they drizzle over what I&#39;m guessing is freakin&#39; awesome pork oil, and probably the sweet sauce that is used to marinate the roast pork. THE BESTTTTTTTTTTT. This makes it so that I can even eat the rice on its own without any of the meat ;) I almost ordered some of their bigger items, which can include up to 3 different meats (pork, duck, chicken), but thank god I decided against it, because I couldn&#39;t even finish this small $3.75 container lol!!! The napa cabbage that it comes with helps a lot with cutting the fattyness of the roast pork, wish it came with more. After stuffing myself with as much of it as my stomach will possibly fit, I still had about 1/4 container of the roast pork (I finished all the rice hehe).

Such good value/food, how can you pass this up?!"

If you can find this tiny establishment, don&#39;t be scared off by the non English speaking staff or large butcher knives or animal carcasses hanging in the window. 

Order a small, choose a meat and voila, you have the perfect meal. The meat selection includes chicken, pork, duck and pig. The roasted pork is char siu--that red marinated stuff that we call &#34;bbq pork&#34; in Chinese restaurants in Hawaii. The roasted pig is what we call &#34;roast pork&#34; in Hawaii--it&#39;s the fatty pork with crispy skin. I chose the duck, however, and it was great. I like that the boxes come with vegetables and sauce over the rice. I also love that they are open early and that you can take your food over to the park across the street to enjoy on a park bench. I don&#39;t really recommend the park thing if you&#39;re put off by Chinese people talking very loudly (as always) to one another or hacking up spit to spit on the side walk. Lol.

Definitely a must try in New York Chinatown, and definitely get a boba milk tea at Yaya to accompany your duck with rice! Yum!"

I love coming here any time I&#39;m in the area. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything better in Chinatown. I usually only get the roast pork, but the chicken is delicious too. They drizzle the juice from the meat over everything and that just adds so much more flavor and deliciousness to the meal! The rice and cabbage soaks it up really nicely.

This place only does takeout and is cash only, but there is a park across the street with a bunch of benches. There&#39;s usually a line out of the door, but it won&#39;t take you more than 20-30 minutes to get your food! The wait is worth it!"

We both got the small $3.75 char siu rice bowl and carried them back home with us. We arrived at home about an hour later and the bowl was still warm.  The bowl was packed full of white rice, steamed cabbage, thinly sliced char siu, and drizzled with sauce. It was one of the most comforting things that I have eaten in a while. The pork had a nice balance of sweet and savory with the right amount of fat. The drizzle of sauce was just a perfect way to tie out the dish as it seeps into the rice and flavors it. I will definitely be back! Next time, I may get a larger size with multiple meats and save it for a few meals ;)"

Why? Just look at the long line of locals/tourists lining up for this spot and you know right off the bat that the food is cheap and good. :)

At the cost of ONLY $3.75, you can order the roast (BBQ like) pork over rice. And let me tell you, that thing is hugeeeee. The meat is packed to the brim that when you open up your tasty little box, you might have to be careful as to not drop a single precious piece of the cha xiu onto the dirty cold ground. The meat is quite exquisite. Not too greasy, has enough fat and meat, and the sauce! The sauce on the meat was savory and flavorful. The meal also includes rice and steamed veggies and is big enough to share with another person if you&#39;re not super hungry. 

There are also other options on the menu (like duck and such) and if you want to order a la carte, it will be slightly more expensive but you get more MEAT that makes it worth it without the rice / veggies. Do note that this is a grab and go place, no seats inside the store. It&#39;s CASH ONLY, and wait time will vary depending on the line and how fast the workers are chopping the meat away.

They got the san bao fan game locked down! I come home from work last night to a great surprise. Little did I know it was just a awesome takeout meal. My wife got me a combination of roast pork and duck over rice and by golly it was the best san bao fan I&#39;ve ever had. Not only did it hit the spot, it knocked me out! Wah Fung&#39;s put every other san bao fan joint to pure shame.

Wah Fung gives you loads of roast pork and good parts of the duck. It&#39;s not like places in Queens where they give you the less meaty sections of the duck so they can save the better pieces for themselves for their regulars. At Wah Fung&#39;s, there&#39;s none of that, they give you the best cuts. They topple roast pork and duck over rice. I kept digging and digging through the meats to get to my rice and with all that fat and soy sauces seeping down to the rice, by the time you take a big bite of rice, you&#39;ve realized you got something real special brewing in your mouth. Their takeout order doesn&#39;t require any duck sauce or extra soy sauce. It&#39;s damn good the way it is! 

When it comes to price and portion, I think I&#39;ve found a new cheap food spot. I rather have this over halal food any day of the week. They even cut you the good fatty slices from the roast pork. It&#39;s been less than a day since I&#39;ve had it and I&#39;m still thinking about their food today. It&#39;s not salty nor is it filled with msg.

It&#39;s greasy, oily, salty, fried and rather good. I stopped by two weeks ago to try their duck...and it was rather good. 

Now duck is a hit or miss. It&#39;s a fatty type of poultry. The skin is very fatty and if it&#39;s not cooked right, it can be very dry. The Peking duck was a little dry but good nonetheless. The pork and chicken were delish! Chicken is my favorite type of Poultry. It&#39;s tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. The pork was very good as well although I have cut back on my pork intake tremendously. It&#39;s not a meat I eat often but I had to try it.

The nappa cabbage was very good as well but it was a little bit too greasy. I&#39;m not necessarily the biggest fan of greasy vegetables but it was pretty good along with the noodles. 

The noodles were very good. Usually, Lo Mein is very greasy, oily and the oil leaks which makes it a major turn off if you do want to eat it. I actually recommend it. The white rice was cooked perfectly. Adding the sauce from the cooked pork makes it very tasty to eat. 

The line is VERY long. I mean it&#39;s long. You&#39;ll be waiting at least 15 to 30 minutes until you&#39;re able to order. The small container is $3.75 and the chicken, duck, and pork is $6 which is very affordable.

They separate the better cuts of pork for the Chinese clients and serve up the cartilage and greasy parts for non Asians. Watch when the proprietor cuts the meat how he stacks it up high for the &#34;preferred&#34; client and look at the serving the child makes for you, huge distinction same cost.

Pros:
- $3.75 (as of March 2016) for 2 meats over rice and cabbage! YES PLEASE. The BBQ pork is easily my favorite. I was a bit disappointed by the pork belly since it was dry, but the crispy skin is delicious. The duck was solid as well, but being as lazy as I am, I prefer the options with no bones.
- They manage to pack a lot of food into that foil container. My friend was really hungry and thought he&#39;d be able to finish a large (3 meats), but was utterly defeated. 

Tips:
- Cash only. 
- I wanted more veggies (in a futile attempt to eat healthier), so I asked for all cabbage and no rice once. I still prefer it with rice, since they drizzle the jus from the meat over it, but next time I go, I&#39;ll ask for less rice and more cabbage!

The lunch $3.75 deal with one item seems to be the most popular order, but I went with the two-item (pork and duck) for a still ridiculously cheap $5.50.

The menu is short with just a couple items, but all the Cantonese meats are extremely tasty. Choice of rice or noodles, and also comes with a side of stir-fried cabbage. 

This place is super tiny, so no place to eat in. The line wasn&#39;t too long when I went despite being prime weekday lunch time; about a ten-minute wait. 

Due to a Mandarin-Cantonese misunderstanding, I ended up ordering TWO 2-item lunches, so I gave the other container to my friend for dinner that night. Portions are very generous, particularly given the price.

I believe it is cash only. If you are in the area, I HIGHLY recommend for a tasty and inexpensive lunch, although it&#39;s the same menu and prices all day, so come whenever really!"

The food is delicious, fresh and cheap!  There are only a couple of these finds in Chinatown that can genuinely get all three right.

Went there for the second time (I was already hooked on my first visit).  I ordered the roast pig along with the roast chicken special.  The roast pig was just right, not overly seasoned like a lot of eateries in Chinatown. Tastes just like the way my father does it; just a little salt.  That&#39;s all you need really, you want to have the pork belly to shine on its own.  Juicy meat with its crispy skin....mmmmm. And for $9/lb that&#39;s a good price. 
And of course, the roast chicken was so yummy, seasoned nicely.  They ease up on the salt here which I like.  Haven&#39;t tried the roast pork yet, which always looks delicious. Judging from the other choices, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just right on flavor.

You can choose from roast chicken, roast duck, roast pork and roast pig.  Either order the special (comes with rice and cabbage), or just the meat per pound.

Just wait in line, order and carry out. It&#39;s really small place, just grab and go.  There&#39;s a park across the street where you can eat.

It seems like family owned; usually the same two nice guys.  They understand enough English to get your order right. But then again it&#39;s only 4 choices so it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult. 

Highly recommended and definitely on my top 10 list of &#39;cheap eats&#39;."

High quality roast meats have been their main allure for years and few establishments serve it better. Whether it&#39;s a roast duck, chicken, or pork this Siu Mei (燒味) is no doubt one of the gems of the neighborhood.

Probably the most popular choice is their infamous small lunch box, which comes with a choice of a meat over rice, cabbage, or noodle. This is no skimpy meal, but a tightly packed metal container that makes for a hell of a meal. Currently at $3.75, it is still a good deal (I still remember when it was $2.00 flat!).

There are no chairs or tables, so it&#39;s take out or nothing. Whenever I am attending a party or getting food for a pot luck, Wah Fung is my spot for a full roast duck and 1/2 pound of roast pork. It ends up being the most popular option at some point; I&#39;ve never had leftovers to take home because it all ends up getting gobbled up.

Every meat is fantastic in its own right. The roast pork is succulent and sweet, with wonderfully charred bits that give added texture with every bite. Whenever I&#39;m doing the rice + meat bit, the roast chicken gets my vote for its tender meat, fantastic silky skin, and almost buttery like flavor. Finally, the roast duck may not be as plump as other meat-eries, the juicy meat and crispy skin would make any carnivore go for seconds. In fact, I do almost every time.

The guys behind the counter are fun, spirited bunch of people. Calling in ahead of time is never a bad idea, but beware non-Canto speakers: the English skills are not always up to par. Come hungry and remember this place is like the rest of Chinatown: cash only."

It&#39;s one of those places you don&#39;t even want to tell people about because you want to keep it all to yourself.

This tiny, unassuming storefront has what is hands-down the best deal I&#39;ve seen in the city. There is generally a line outside (as there is no seating room and just enough room to stand and order), but it moves pretty fast.

ROAST PORK DEAL ($3.75):
All you need to know about is the roast pork (charsiu). $3.75, served over rice and cabbage, all day, every day. And they really don&#39;t skimp on the portions. They start off with plenty of rice, over which they layer some cabbage and then add freshly chopped roast meat. You see them cutting up the meat and think, &#34;ooh that&#39;s a good amount,&#34; and THEN they go back and add even more. The finishing touch is a healthy ladle of the sweet soy-based sauce that the roast meat was sitting in. You get your choice of chicken or pork for the deal, but I highly recommend the pork.

For that measly $3.75, you get an absolutely not-measly portion of perfectly roasted, sweet, fatty pork goodness. That size will either leave you stuffed or make for a satisfying lunch with leftovers. The pork itself is juicy and not at all dried out, and the roast skin is just perfection. There isn&#39;t a ton of cabbage, but that just means more room for meat. The rice ends up flavorful and moist from the fat on the meat and the extra sauce, and the whole combination is just everything you want in a comfort meal. 

They have a couple other options, including combos of multiple meats starting at $5, and those are even bigger and more filling than the standard $3.75 charsiu option. I took one home today and it&#39;s gonna be lasting me 2 meals at least. The roast duck is solid, but nothing can stand up to the charsiu.

Overall, just an absolute gem in Chinatown."

At that time i was the only african american person in the place and i was wondering and hoping the guys spoke english and they did. I ordered a large portion of Roast Pork over rice, and a large portion of Roast Pig over rice. Yes they are two different things. The Roast Pig was so delicious, juicy just enough fat and skin and meat to satisfy my craving. The Roast Pork was also pretty good only thing i had an issue with is that they chop up the meats on the same wooden slab so it seemed like the Roast pork picked up alot of the residual of the BBQ Pork so it was slightly sweeter then i wanted. I wanted to give this place 4.5 stars. These dishes can be had over rice or over noodles with some cabbage on the side. I had it over rice. You can also buy the meats by weight. A large portion is around $5.00 and a small portion starts at $3.75. They dont skimp on the meat portions.

It&#39;s your rare, rare, rare blend of both quality and quantity for a cheap price. Granted my mother doesn&#39;t like pork, so for a portion of chicken it isn&#39;t really as amazing I guess. There&#39;s duck too though. Anyways ...

Small business located in Chinatown that serves up good, cheap food. No seating available - busy place, but lines move quickly.  Portion size is great.  Did I mention it was cheap??  Cheap to the point where I wonder how they make a profit!

What my family ordered:

Roast pork over small rice - $3.75
   The roast pork was full of flavor - perfect sweet/savory combination. Depending on the piece they give you, it could be a little fatty.  They douse the container with sauce, so no worries on the dish being dry. 

Large duck over rice - $5.00 
  I don&#39;t eat duck, but my mom said it was a pretty good. Not as much flavor as the pork, but good nonetheless.  Also a steal at only $5 (you get about half a duck)

For the actual food, I was disappointed. They ran out of noodles when I got there- no biggie. The cabbage it came with was delicious. The rice itself was a little mushy, and I&#39;m a stickler when it comes to &#39;al dente&#39; firm rice. The pork I got was very, very dry... I was expecting some nice juicy roast pork from all the hype. I asked for the green sauce on top- it was good, but extremely salty.

So what is this little hole in the wall?  CHINESE BBQ THAT&#39;S WHAT!!  Honestly it&#39;s a whole lot of nice and juicy Char Sieu (Roast Pork), or thinly sliced Faw Yuk (suckling pig) or Si Yao Gai (soy sauce chicken) or Roast Duck and Roast Chicken!

Get 1, 2 or 3 over rice with a stewed cabbage, or get a small version of just one item over rice and tada!  It&#39;s a HUGE meal.  Rice or Noodles (mai fun or lo mein) and they drizzle some of the juices over the whole platter keeping it moist!  

There are other things you can order from there and the cuts of meat aren&#39;t the best.  I&#39;ve had better Char Sieu from other places - but for it&#39;s price, you won&#39;t get any place better!"

I got everything on the menu Chicken, Pork, Duck and Pig(i&#39;ll get to the difference between Pork and Pig in a bit)
First off ALL the meats were moist juicy and really tasty, a bit sweeter for my palette its that sweet soy sauce glaze which I am not particularly fond of. 
The home run for me was the Roast PIG (not pork) so the roast pig is a dry rubbed pork belly with the crispy skin, YUUUP I am salivating right now just writing this post its that dam good, for rest of the meats they are good but I have had roast meats with similar taste/quality if not better. 
The real kicker and the reason this place deserves a 5 star is the prices, the meal special for $3.95 fill you right to the brim and should you go for the $6 meal well I bet you&#39;ll have leftovers. 
Will I come back Hell Ya.. Should you go there, do yourselves the favor.
Is it worth the wait anywhere between 30-35 min during lunch ehhhhh.... Well that were it looses points on and the reason for the delays is there just one guy working the counter and he DOES NOT rush. Mind you its a strictly Take-Out joint with Cash Only.
If I were you, I&#39;d skip them for lunch instead grab a dinner on the way home or be there by 11 or after 2."

You won&#39;t find General Tso&#39;s chicken or beef with broccoli, just either noodles, rice, boiled cabbage, and roast meats (and perhaps some fish balls). For $6 or less, you can load up on huge portions of roasted duck, chicken, or pork, in a small dingy, &#34;B&#34; health-rated hole-in-the-wall. Yes, you might be taking a bit a risk with cleanliness, but such is life in the fish-garbage neighborhood that is New York Chinatown. They&#39;re cash only, and they don&#39;t even have a cash register. It&#39;s just a cardboard box with slots in it. Talk about lack of overhead. Forget about seating too. You&#39;ll likely have to find one of the benches on Chrystie St. or the park where all of the Cantonese people loiter between Chrystie and Forsyth.

My usual go-to is the roast cha siu pork or roast pig (there is a difference). The duck is actually delicious, but often doesn&#39;t come with much meat and is mostly bone and skin. The only &#34;vegetable&#34; you&#39;ll find here is the boiled cabbage, which is 50 cents extra, unless you order the $3.75 small roast pork over rice, which comes with a small portion of cabbage. You can ask for either the slightly overcooked lo mein type noodles or white rice. The great thing with the white rice is that it soaks up most of the pork/duck fat, soy sauce and other good stuff, rendering the concoction a delicious, greasy mess of a meal. The quality is decent, although not the best, and you&#39;ll definitely leave full to bursting.

If they were open late nights, they would probably be unstoppable. Just saying. In that case, head over to Great NY Noodle Town for late night roast pork/duck. In all, if you&#39;re looking for low-cost roasted meats during the day (except when it&#39;s closed on Mondays), look no further than Wah Fung #1."

We went with the spicy and tingly beef noodles, oxtail noodle stew, and the cucumbers. The noodles are fresh knife cut noodles. It&#39;s delicious! The flavors and texture are on point. It&#39;s not too spicy but has a lingering kick that&#39;s addicting. The oxtail is very tender and I really want to eat this again! Next time on my list is the lamb cumin noodles and the Liang Pi.

Well, as is always the case at Xi&#39;an&#39;s, I had no reason to worry. Service was extremely fast and prompt, and by the time my food was ready, a couple of seats had opened up. The location is small, but spacious, with a large window overlooking Kenmare St. 

The food continues to amaze me - a regular who has ordered nearly every menu item - everytime. I ordered my favorite meal on this occassion - Ns1, Spicy cumin lamb noodle soup.

The lamb cumin noodles without soup was really good ($9); I loved the long and chewy flat noodles and the lamb!
The sweet and sour spinach dumplings were great as well because it was drowned in chili oil. This place sells not so spicy stuff so don&#39;t be alarmed like I was for several months while contemplating if this place was right for me...it is and I&#39;d come back for the lamb burger!"

But months later, I was craving it and after numerous times of telling myself &#34;you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t go&#34; I went any way. 

This time, I tried the pork Zha Jiang noodles and gave the lamb burger another shot. Holy cow, these noodles were perfect. I ordered the standard spicy, which isn&#39;t actually spicy but gives you a little kick without masking flavors. And boy, were there flavors. The pork was well seasoned and plentiful. The noodles didn&#39;t lose texture, even in the 10 minute walk back to my office. This is definitely my new favorite thing. 

The lamb burger was still meh. 
But, have you tried the pork burger? It&#39;s such a tidy, neat little package. Much less mess than the lamb. But each bite is well balanced -- not too bready, not too meaty. Be warned of juices. 

Actually, let&#39;s talk about the juices as a whole. This place serves juicey dishes. Wear a bib. You&#39;re gonna get some noodle splash. I ruined a dress. Noodle juice everywhere. Had to reschedule an interview. It&#39;s okay, I like the Zha Biang noodles more than the dress anyway."

It is a small shop, so take out is recommended.

From the giant menu on the wall, you&#39;ve got an array of options to choose from. The classic I recommend are the Lamb Soup Noodles. The soup is spicy, full of flavor, and will stain any white shirt you&#39;re wearing- so be ready with those bibs. I would pass on the Lamb Dumplings as you can get your bao fix elsewhere in Chinatown since you are so close.

When you take them home, the containers make it so that the food will still be at its very best within ten minutes. Be prepared to eat when you sit down and feel the burn!

There is also a lot of newspaper clippings and articles posted about this restaurant.  

We got our food very quickly and we finished... very quickly.  The noodles were perfectly thick and saucey.  It was a tad spicy for me, but not overwhelmingly so.  I haven other words to explain how good these noodles were.  I was craving some really good Chinese food and here we had found it.  It was exploding with flavor and the meat was also tender.  The noodles were a bit oily, but it was expected.  I don&#39;t know how the soup noodles would be, but maybe a tad less oily but also excellent.  There is a matching soup order to each stirfry order of noodles which I thought was clever.

Ordered the two buns: stewed pork ($4) and spicy cumin lamb burger ($5) and there&#39;s tax (of course). Man, this is a terrible first date idea because if you get the spicy cumin burger, the spices/oil will drip everywhere (i.e. your shirt, your elbows, uh huh) so be advised! 

I loved the flavors of both, though I would prefer the pork more because it was juicy without being oily, and the seasoning was just right. Loved the lamb too, what a kick! But again, what a mess haha. 

My only complaint is the bread. Maybe I was expecting a mantou, fluffier type of bread? It was a bit denser than expected. Might be the batch I had, might be typical of this place. But I wanted a softer bun. In my bun, I could see the actual areas where it was more dense instead of even.

I used to live right next to the old one under the Manhattan Bridge in Chinatown so I&#39;ve had almost everything on the menu. 

Liang Pi Cold Skin Noodles are a must have! Their tofu is also amazing! Can&#39;t go wrong with their dumplings...lamb or spinach. Such an awesome mix of sour and spicy! Not a huge fan of the lamb or pork burgers though, too dry for me and not as flavorful as I expected. The Mount Qi Noodle Soups, pork or veggie, are my favorite of the soup noodles."

The interior felt very familiar. Typical of what you would find at the other locations-- minimal space and seating, with the menu, pictures included, pasted on the wall. 

Like the other locations, there is no wait staff, so customers dining in are expected not to linger and clean up after themselves. 

I ordered N2 $8.25 (payment was waived for the opening) and it tasted standard, in that there was no difference in terms of taste from its other Manhattan shops. 

Congrats to XFF and its continued success. Thank you for the promo and wish you much success in the future."

The pork noodle soup was something of a wonder; the more I think about it the better I remember it tasting. I shared it with a friend and it was enough for both of us to fill up, though I probably could&#39;ve eaten it on my own too. It was $9.50, which isn&#39;t that cheap but I thought it was worth it. The pork was so tender it shredded instantly when I grazed it with my fork. The noodles were a really nice shape, large and flat and incredibly long. I almost thought the whole bowl was one noodle! The soup itself was a little sour (tangy maybe?) and salty. It was very spicy at first but a perfect level after a few bites. Also, the cilantro was a nice touch. This shop was pretty tiny but very clean and pleasant. If you do manage to get a seat, it&#39;s really nice to look out of the large glass window. 

I am eager to go back and plan on doing so soon, maybe to a different location!"

I got the Stewed pork burger and spicy lamb burger. Both were so delicious. The wait wasn&#39;t that bad, less than 5 minutes and when I got them they were super hot. I couldn&#39;t even hold them. I would definitely eat these hot though. I don&#39;t think they would taste good if they got a little cold, or even warm. I ate the pork burger second and towards the end it wasn&#39;t as tasty because it was starting to cool down too much.

I can&#39;t say which I liked better because they were both bomb. I want to go back and try some other dishes.

The only thing to be aware of is this place is super small. It only seats about 6 people. And they suggest you eat your food while it&#39;s hot or it won&#39;t be as enjoyable, so you&#39;ll have to go somewhere close to eat if there&#39;s no room inside.

Ordered the recommended spicy lamb noodles and while the flavor was good, they were WAYYY too oily! and that&#39;s coming from someone who likes oil... it made me feel gross after.

Additionally, I thought the texture of the noodles could be better (a little to thick and chewy, possibly slightly undercoated, but I was hoping for homemade noodle that kinda melt in your mouth). Also the meat had a couple of fatty pieces that were not bites I wanted to swallow.

The best part of my meal was the chrysanthemum tea. Super refreshing and unique (I&#39;ve never had before) and not overly floral-y. Much needed to wash down all that oil, yikes."

Our fave things to get:
- Pad See Ew
- Drunken Noodles
- Crab Rangoon
- Panang Curry w/ Soft Tofu
- Thai Iced Tea
- Chicken Curry Puff

Panang is my go-to at Thai restaurants but, to be honest, Dannee&#39;s Panang isn&#39;t consistent. It&#39;s different depending on who makes it in the back. It&#39;s never bad but sometimes it just doesn&#39;t taste like Panang. But since everything else is so awesome there, I really can forgive it. In any case, I&#39;d recommend their noodles or rice dishes. They do those real good and it&#39;s always spot-on!

Also, the Thai Iced Tea is enormous and made with fresh tea so I definitely recommend that! I know it seems weird but this place has the best Crab Rangoon I&#39;ve ever had. So much so that my boyfriend and I are tempted to just one day order like 5 orders of it and chow down on an enormous pile of some Crab Rangoon as a meal haha. Not kidding. 

They deliver and do carry out orders through their website. But dining in is great too cus it&#39;s nice inside and they&#39;re super attentive.

If you live in the area, this place will def become a go-to when you&#39;re not in a cooking mood! We definitely eat here at least once every two weeks."

Three and Half Stars
Update

I ordered a seamless order from here in August and it was okay. I wanted to try the actual restaurant. They have an amazing Lunch Special: $10 for a choice of Appetizer, Entree, and Drink. Tiff had veggie dumplings, drunken noodles, and a Thai Ice Tea. I had Tom Yum, Pad Thai and a Thai Ice Tea.  The four dumplings were fresh but tied too tightly and thick at the top. but had a decent flavor profile. The Soup was great on this rainy day. It heat, salt, and sour.  The bowl was a good portion filled with a variety of veggies.  The Noodles were okay. The Pad Thai was a light brown color, no heat, little citrus, and on the sweeter side. The beef tasted old/tough. The Drunken Noodle were better.  The Service was good.  The place had a great value but not the best food."

So the order came earlier than expected, by about 20 minutes. So its gets some stars for that. 

The pad sew ewe was AMAZING. Definitely would order from here again. 

Also got the thai tea which was awesome. Didn&#39;t even spill too much on transport. It was wrapped up nicely.  

However, one thing I would never order from here is the crab rangoon. It tasted good. However, $6 for 5, maybe 6 tiny pieces of crab rangoon is not worth it. Its just too expensive and not worth that kind of money. And, why are the crab rangoons so small? They were like cute baby sized. Also, why wasn&#39;t my sauce for the crab rangoons full? It was barely half full when I received it. No spillage in sight, just not even filled. I got a lot of lettuce with my crab rangoon, which I think is supposed to be aesthetically pleasing but I want more crab rangoon. Not tiny baby fried things with half the sauce and a bunch of lettuce.

Overall, I would definitely order from here again. Probably only the main entree stuff though."

The portions were pretty big and I thought I would have to take some home, but it was so good I couldn&#39;t stop eating. Hence, another thai place for lunch today due to endless craving. I tried to come here for lunch when the restaurant was still new, but oddly, the place wasn&#39;t open at noon, even though it technically should have been according to their official hours.

One of my most favorite thai spot in NYC, I hope it stays consistent because right now it&#39;s dirt cheap + awesome service + plenty &amp; tasty food. Tried like 8 items and none of them fail so far! 
MUST GET: fried watercress salad w/ shrimps &amp; calamari + lime juice. Whole red snapper with mango + avo is also insanely great deal. And really, we were fans of their mock duck - we tried it on everything, pad thai, pad kee mao and fried rice, everything was well executed!

Also, their Thai Iced Tea is served on a jumbo glass - for like $2.50 it&#39;s very worth it although it&#39;s not exactly the best I&#39;ve had. For this item it&#39;s more of quantity vs quality (BUT I&#39;d still recommend this place!!)

This is REAL DEAL Thai. Perfect flavor profiles, really fresh food, and incredibly attentive service. The food is amazing and, most importantly, authentic. This area is full of Chinese- or Japanese-run Thai places that make the food wrong, add different ingredients and spice blends, and overall create dishes that are rather different from those you&#39;d typically find in a real Thai restaurant. Dannee is a real Thai restaurant, and all my favorite dishes taste exactly like they should. 

I&#39;ve ordered delivery twice in the last week! The food is flavorful and made to order, the ingredients are high quality, and it&#39;s surprisingly affordable. 

The owners are really nice people, and called me to ask how I was enjoying my food. The delivery guy was 7 minutes late the second time--I didn&#39;t complain about it, they just knew-- and they offered me free items in my next delivery. I won&#39;t be taking advantage of this, because I really like the restaurant and didn&#39;t think it was necessary, but the fact that it was even offered goes to show how much they care.

These guys are really great, and I love supporting local businesses that both do a good job and care about their customers. I&#39;ll probably order again tonight."

On my first visit, I ordered a salmon noodle special, which was fantastic. My second visit, which was a take-out order of pad see ew, was a little more run of the mill; the noodles tasted slightly overcooked and gooey.

Decor was inviting yet industrial- only thing I would change is have them dim the ceiling lights a bit more so the accent lighting could work it&#39;s romantic charm. Thai iced teas are strong and come in a delicate large glass that makes a pleasurable sound to stir. Tried fresh rolls and spring rolls, both excellent. Penang curry was 7.95 and was a huge bowl of the classic Penang beauty of veggies and spiced coconut flavors. The green beans had a satisfying fresh crunch when biting into them. Thai fried rice had a delicate smoky flavor that seems to be a theme in many dishes. Will be retuning again for the chill relaxing dining experience, and definitely placing delivery orders."

I couldn&#39;t find a Thai place that looked decent on Seamless so I checked Yelp for something nearby that might deliver. Delivery took about half an hour; everything was piping hot even though it&#39;s very cold out. I got yellow curry with chicken, boyfriend had pad thai with chicken, and we shared tom yum with tofu. Lots of the big, triangular fried hunks of tofu in the soup and a complex, spicy broth. My yellow curry was also flavorful and spicy and the portion was huge. The pad thai I can&#39;t speak for - my boyfriend polished that off before I could try any! For a little over $10 each, I&#39;m stuffed and very happy (and have leftovers).

Overall - really flavorful, great prices, big portions. So glad this place exists!"

Of course this place was just as busy as the others and the food it just as amazing! I get a feel from all the locations that their dishes truly try to incorporate taste, texture and color into their dishes. 

Service: attentive and friendly staff. 
Ambiance: Love the wooden everything, just a little loud and tight in space.

Starters:
1) Calamari and nuts $9
-This was nothing special, like any other calamari you would get at an American restaurant, but what I liked was that it didn&#39;t have too much batter and was fried perfectly with a crunch and the calamari wasn&#39;t chewy

2) Truffle Fries $5 - Happy hour
-These was definitely one of my favorite choices in any location!
-Crunch fries and 2 sauces to dip from  

3) Scallion Pancake $13
-Delicious!
-You can&#39;t really mess this dish up, but I like that you can taste the scallion immersed in the dough, which sometimes maybe a hit or miss at other places, and it wasn&#39;t too oily  

Tacos: 
-2 BIG portions, not worth the price, but worth trying
1) Bulgogi $13
-Flavorful and well balanced with the lime sour cream, however it was a little cold when I ate it, probably due to either letting it sit too long, or the other toppings cooling the meat down too fast.
2) Chicken $12
-I am not normally a chicken fan, but the meat was actually juicy
-The down side was that I couldn&#39;t taste the chicken too much, the garnishes may have been too over powering for this dish
-I would prefer the Bulgogi still over the chicken, but still good

Bulgogi bibimbap hot stone $14
-This dish was smaller that I expected, however, we had so many other dishes that it didn&#39;t matter.
-I had let it sit for a good 5-10 min before even digging into it, but the rich didn&#39;t have that semi-burnt crunch to it...very sad and disappointing....
-Nevertheless, it was still delicious and flavorful!

Makgeoli Cheesecake #13
-The cheesecake was more subtle of a cheese taste, wasn&#39;t as thick and creamy as I would like it. 
-I did like the enormous amount of fruits and the scope of ice cream.

Came with a group of 4 on a Friday night and were seated after only a brief wait. I hear the wait can get pretty long but this was about 9 pm so it seemed to have died down. 

We ordered a few items - the bulgogi, the spicy pork, chap chae and the fried chicken. The chap chae was amazing and a healthy portion, but the star of the meal for me was the spicy pork. At this point I&#39;ve gotten this at quite a few places both in K-town and elsewhere, but this was perhaps the best I&#39;ve had. It was cooked perfectly as well. The bulgogi was also very good. The fried chicken was mediocre and would recommend skipping it.

Overall, this was a great experience and was very reasonably priced. I think it was around 35/person including a bottle of sake for the table. Would absolutely come back. 

While I do enjoy places that cook the food on the table, here they didn&#39;t so you don&#39;t walk away smelling like Korean food the rest of the day...."

we  ordered the spicy cold noodle, soy garlic chicken wings and uni bibimbop.

spicy cold noodle with sashimi- i would rate it 3.5 stars. The flavors of the spicy sauce were pretty good and had alot of different things in it. However, the pieces of fish were way too cold, almost like it was just taken out of a fridge/freezer. The fish wasn&#39;t frozen, but it felt like it was about to be.  

soy garlic wings- They had a lot of flavor in it. I enjoyed it as an appetizer. But doesn&#39;t taste as good if you leave it on the table too long. eat it while it&#39;s hot.

Uni Bibimbob- 3.5 stars. it was ok. A lot of different components mixed in and different flavors combining together, but I was expecting more uni :( It tasted ok but it&#39;s not something I would rave about.

I also got a free shot for checking in on yelp. Not sure what they gave me but it was somewhat sweet, and tasted pretty good.

Service was nice and polite. 

Overall, it was a decent meal. In reality, I&#39;d rate it 3.5 stars. The meal wasnt amazing but i think maybe the tapas would taste better?  i would probably come back to try more of their tapas and see how they turn out"

While all of the dishes looked amazingly delicious, the flavors and textures just didn&#39;t hit the mark. Korean &amp; Asian fusion, in general, is known for offering  a tantalizing blend of balance and adventure. With a little fine tuning, the small plate offerings could be great.

The ambiance is definitely what you would expect from a Midtown night spot. Perfectly located, this makes for a good option to prefunk before an event at MSG or for an after work treat with friends or colleagues.

For food, we shared the scallion pancake, truffle fries, and the soy garlic wings. Everything came relatively quick. The scallion pancake was okay - I wish the sauce had a little more taste. Since scallions and flour are tasteless, it would&#39;ve been perfect if the sauce was a little more salty. As for the fries, good enough to satisfy my fries craving. It came with ketchup and spicy mayo, yum. Now, the wings! Crispy, tasty, juicy, and amazing. I really need to learn how to make it. Get it, you won&#39;t regret it.

I convinced some friends that were visiting me that we should try it and everyone was thrilled with the meal. I was eating with very picky and usually not adventurous eaters, so I was actually surprised at how successful the dinner was. It got very crowded very fast and you can tell it&#39;s a popular place (they don&#39;t accept reservations for small parties). This also means that it&#39;s loud, which doesn&#39;t bother me, but did bother others. 

And now, onto the food! I shared some plates with the table and was exceptionally happy with all of them. I ate as much as I could, but didn&#39;t feel overly stuffed.

Crunchy Tofu - It&#39;s fried tofu served with caramelized kimchi. This was the best of the few dishes we tried. The tofu was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was covered in some spicy, sweet and sour-like sauce and came with the most incredible kimchi on the side. I would buy a jar of that stuff if they started to sell it (hint hint).

Scallion Pancake - Scallion pancakes are hard to go wrong with. What I really liked about this version was that it was almost entirely scallion and very little dough. It was pretty greasy and I had to blot it a bit before eating. It came with a great dipping sauce, which I ended up using for other things as well.

Hot stone Bowl with Tofu and Mushroom - The bowl had a very seaweed-y flavor, combined with an almost smokey flavor. It was a very unique combination and it tasted great. I love the hotstone bowls. It also comes with a bowl of broth that&#39;s really nice to sip between bites of heavier food. I wasn&#39;t sure what to do with the broth at first, but a waiter was very kind and explained it to me without making me feel ignorant about it.

I also had a glass of the Midtown Forsythia Soju Cocktail with the food. It&#39;s very reasonably priced and comes with their signature &#34;candy rocks&#34; which are really just round ice cubes on a stick with a flower or berry frozen inside. They&#39;re very pretty and since the drink is served at room temperature, it&#39;s a necessity.

I checked in on Yelp to get a free shot of some cocktail and the waiter was kind enough to bring a round of shots for the whole table! I&#39;m pretty sure it was one of the sangrias and it was delicious. I&#39;m even more curious about their wide range of interesting cocktails now.

There&#39;s absolutely no doubt that I&#39;ll be back here and hopefully I&#39;ll also try their original location too. This is definitely the place to take people if you&#39;re looking for a great and different dining experience."

It might be a little bit mo&#39; bettah. We knew the jap chae was going to be excellent because it&#39;s excellent at the other version as well. But that kimchi pancake with bacon was just like mom used to make (my imaginary Korean mom I mean). And the spicy pork was prolly the best we&#39;ve ever had (and we&#39;ve had a lot).

We ordered delivery so can&#39;t say much about anything else. But all-in-all, pretty happy about the food here. If we&#39;re ever hungry and in that area we&#39;ll make a point to stop by. You should too..."

They don&#39;t take reservations, first come, first serve. There are happy hour items until 7pm, with appetizer and drinks. 

To start we got the Galbi buns and the Korean escargot. The buns were delicious, super soft and generous portion of the beef per bun. The escargot was also very well seasoned and prepared, it does have a chewy rubbery texture associated with mollusks nothing wrong on the preparation side. The main courses are definitely a little small considering the price. We got the table BBQ, the wagyu beef and the USDA prime. The meat are excellent, careful not to overcook it though. It also came with some sides of veggies, but overall portions are tiny, after the apps and the two BBQ portions, I was still hungry. 

But all in all, great dinner spot, yummy food, just be prepare to dish out a few extra bucks in order to walk out completely full. Regardless, I will be back to try some of the other items on the menu."

Arrived on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Not crowded or busy at all. Service was prompt. atmosphere and decor feels like being in a cafe or coffee shop.

Food!
- Spicy pork bimbimbap in a small yet deep stone bowl. Comes with miso soup. Very filling and delicious.
- Sparkling yuzu infused soda. Disappointed. It didn&#39;t taste like yuzu or any citrus flavour. Tasted bubbly and sweet like soda.
- Truffle fries! 
- Dessert: on the menu it says Churros with red ginseng ice cream. Instead received green tea cream. Not complaining because the Churros were fresh! Soft on the inside yet crispy cinnamon-y on the outside.

Overall experience : Pretty good  My lunch companion loved it and would return. So would I."
barn-joo-35-new-york,Monica F.,r3bQNAv4YGZZKTAm7qIiEg,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,1,96,14,JiIsG5lIpD__rYDTTZLNfw,5.0,2016-09-06,"WOW. This place was amazing. I normally swear against any place that has pictures on their menu (because it RARELY looks like what it does in the pictures, and how many times has it tasted as good as it looks too?), but this can be my one exception! 

I&#39;ll start with the decor - The ambiance was pretty quiet (and bright, although at one point they did dim the lights) consider how crowded it was. I had stopped by the Barn Joo in Flatiron and it was significantly louder and darker, but we were not disappointed. It was a Monday evening at around 8 (long weekend, so not really a regular Monday) and although we were seated immediately, it was pretty packed and people were coming in and out the entire time. The decor was an interesting mix of wood pieces (including some of the tables that looked like finished slabs of tree trunks), alcohol bottles and pickles vegetables on shelves. 

Now, on to the food. We started with a bunch of plates to split. First we got the Tuna Mayo, which was raw tuna with a mayo-based sauce on bruschetta. The portion was small (three, slightly bigger than bite-sized pieces), but the taste was unbelievable. This one is pictured on their menu, so you can kind of get an idea of what it looks like, although the size did seem bigger!

The next thing we tried was the Corn Cheese, which, as you can see, was another not-so-creative name on their part, but was really good an unexpected for this type of cuisine! It came in a mini-cast iron pan, with corn and bacon and some jalapeño, topped with melted cheese. It was different for sure and didn&#39;t really fit with the rest of the menu and flavors, but I&#39;d get this one again too! We did have to ask for forks because corn doesn&#39;t lend itself well to eat with chop sticks, especially if it&#39;s also topped with gooey cheese,

Then we got the buns - both the crispy chicken and the Galbi (pork). To be quite honest, these tasted and looked almost exactly the same, so I&#39;m not sure if they accidentally brought us two of the same or if they&#39;re just not that different, but either way they tasted great. The buns were not too thick but the meat itself was, so you weren&#39;t filled up with fluff. Extremely flavorful, but definitely a messy dish!

The fried tiger roll was our next dish, which was an extremely flavorful roll. The one thing I felt about this one is that you could probably get it at any sushi place, so I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again and try something different next time! But it was great and was a big portion size as well (as they tend to be). 

The next thing we got was the shrimp ceviche, which was personally my least favorite, but everyone else loved it. The shrimp was served whole, which is uncommon for ceviche, and personally I felt like the shrimp hadn&#39;t marinated enough to really absorb the flavors of the sauce, but I guess if I didn&#39;t think about it as a ceviche, it was good as a unique dish. Served with a few rice balls! Also, this did not looked like the picture, because the shrimp were pictured with their heads which was not the case! I was definitely not upset about that menu change.

The last thing(s) we ordered (because we were still hungry!) were the tacos - we got chicken and Bulgogi, which came with 2 tacos each. The chicken ones fell apart completely, so maybe smaller soft shells instead of big ones and just more mini tacos instead of two big ones would be the way to go for these. However, both of the tacos were amazing and topped with guacamole and pico de gallo - another unexpected but interesting find at a Korean place!

I also ordered the Cucumber Sojutini without the bitters and it was amazing!


Not a single thing we ordered was short of amazing. Would definitely come back!"

Soy garlic wings were great; hot and spicy even better! 

Octopus was a disappointment; one of those things that looks better than it taste. 

My friend and I each checked in to receive a glass of free Soju cocktail. The grape flavored one did not have much of a taste in my opinion but the lychee was tasty!  The round ice of fruit on the stick was a lovely surprise. 

By 6 pm this place was packed. I would come again to try their other dishes and have more soju."

It was more different than I expected from the other Barn Joo, this one was a lot smaller and they did not take reservation compared to the Flatiron one. The Flatiron one also had a wheel that you could spin and potentially win something where this one did not. But the décor in this one was super pretty, they had a full moon design in the restaurant as well as in the girl&#39;s bathroom. I loved the ambiance of this place, it was super calming and nice. The waiters were super considerate and nice, we got a surprise cake for the birthday boy, and the waiter actually put in mad effort to try to ensure that he did not see the cake which I thought was super thoughtful. 

The menu was pretty similar to the one at Flatiron but some options were different. This one also had one free shot if you checked-in; the shot was super yummy but def. not strong in alcohol content but super tasty. We ordered a bunch of things to try and here are my thoughts on them:
*Bulgogi Japchae: This did not disappoint again, I loved it the last time I got it at the Flat Iron one so I got it again and it was as delicious as I remember it to be. For this is a def. a must order item here. 
*Bulgogi Hot Stone Pot: This was smaller than the one at Flat Iron and the bulgogi was delicious but the rice was multi-grain which I was not feeling (I pretty much only like white rice) but everyone else who got it liked it 
*Truffle Fries: SUPER DELICIOUS, amazing truffle flavor and the fries were super crispy; another must order item in my books as well 

Overall, Barn Joo did not disappoint the food was pretty tasty and the service is super good!!"

The food was out of this world. Every bite filled with scrumptious tastes. It was exactly what we needed after a walk in midtown. Best part was the delightful Churros. It was a surprise to find it on the menu but scrumptious Indeed!

The staff were warm and welcoming and the ambiance is great!

I highly recommend it!"

Slightly offended that THIS location calls themselves a &#34;Gastropub&#34;; unlike their flagship Barn Joo in Flatiron/Gramercy, Barn Joo 35 only has 2 draughts, Sapporo and Bluemoon, and a measly 6 bottled beers..

HAPPY HOUR FOOD 
-Truffle Fries: Absolutely delicious, dip them in spicy mayo, addicting!!! 
-Tuna Mayo: Conflicted, lot of mayo but tuna tasted fresh, good acid
-Wings: Didn&#39;t try them but a person next to me had them and said they were amazing

We came by my cousins recommendation (he had visited the one in flatiron) and were interested in trying something different - this was our first Korean BBQ experience so we don&#39;t have much to compare it to, but we loved it!

Your check-in gets you a free shot&#39;s-worth of their signature cocktail, which was a nice way to give it a try. My boyfriend opted for a glass of it (only $6) while I had the sauv blanc, they have a decent alcohol selection to choose from and HH specials daily 4-7!

For dinner we decided to get a bunch of dishes to share, so here is what we got: hot &amp; spicy wings, steamed pork dumplings, fried tiger roll (pretty big), crispy chicken buns, and the USDA prime table BBQ. It sounds like a lot of food and it definitely was a good variety, but it was the perfect amount for two people - we weren&#39;t stuffed and we got to try a lot! Highlights were the wings, buns, and the tiger roll was pretty huge. The dumplings were so-so, this isn&#39;t really a dumpling spot so I&#39;d probably recommend something else. We didn&#39;t get the calamari but saw it at a number of other tables and it looked great!

They do have a few desserts that looked interesting, but I felt like I would have rather just ordered more food than waste tummy space on those. Overall we loved it though!! 

My only downside is that we didn&#39;t really have a waiter, everyone sort of pitched in but as a result it was hard to find someone to get another drink from (nobody ever came and asked us if we even wanted our first, much less any after that), and it took almost a half hour to get our check at the end of the meal. They never even asked us if we wanted dessert (luckily we didn&#39;t). They were very eager to get our dinner order and then it seemed no one ever returned except to bring food and scurry away quickly. I&#39;d still come back, but I don&#39;t know if this waiter scenario is a good idea to keep going, they definitely lost money because we weren&#39;t able to order more drinks!"

First, the dinner menu seems far more extensive and appealing. I wish we had gone for dinner if only to have a few more of the more traditional choices by which to judge this restaurant. We eat ALOT of Korean food, and while I appreciate a restaurant that tries to do something different, this fell flat on most of those dishes.

The tuna mayo appetizer was lovely and the truffle fries were a hit.  The fried tofu was also very tasty, but we&#39;d asked about spice factor, and they indicated only that the kimchi was on the side (we were with kids).  When it arrived, on first bite, it was also clearly coated in gochujang. It wasn&#39;t terribly spicy but when a family with young children asks if something is spicy, tell the truth! Mark one against the service, which frankly, was pretty terrible all around.  They never offered us plates, which is totally required when you are sharing small plates! We had to get up to ask for cutlery for our kids too.  They also whiffed on the check - we had to hunt them down to get it and then they never returned to pick it up.  We were one of two tables there so it wasn&#39;t as if they were busy!  

Next, the main dishes:

The bulgogi hotstone both was, well, yucky.  The meat was poorly cooked and stringy and they mixed some very odd ingredients in with what should have been rice. Was it quinoa? Some odd greens that tasted slimy in the mix? Frankly, if you are going to riff on a standard dish, TELL people. If it was quinoa, I suspect they didn&#39;t rinse it properly because it had an odd soapy taste to it that was really unappealing.

The sushi burrito was even worse.  The avocado was brown and slimy and there was something that had a very gritty texture in it.  

The dumplings were overfried and we just left feeling icky and unsatisfied, even with all that food. Even the kimchi wasn&#39;t very good.

Very disappointed. I hope for those who visit during dinner, they have a better experience. I could not recommend going for lunch."

We started with a soju cocktail which was lightly sweet. I love the ice with fruit frozen inside. Nice touch.

We also shared:

Tuna Mayo on toast (the garnish had a weird flavor)
Nacho belly (a little too fatty)
Soy and garlic wings (additional cost)-Super crispy but definitely needed a sauce.
Truffle fries (additional cost )-really good, the best part of the meal
Steak BBQ (small portion)

Overall wasn&#39;t impressed by the Korean/BBQ portion, but would come back only for the bar food."

Luckily, there was barely a wait on a Friday around 7PM (which normally K-town is atrocious). It&#39;s a bit off of K-town but close enough. It has that americanized, farm to table feel for korean food.

For appetizers:
- Corn cheese dip - This was actually very tasty, with perfectly cooked tortilla chips and SUPER cheesy corn dip. Wish they gave more chips though because it wasn&#39;t enough to dip, but they charge for additional chips ( I guess intentional).
- Korean escargot - Tasted like regular escargot as it was a bit buttery, except had spicy radish flavor on the side

For entrees:
- My fiance got the uni bi bim bop, which he said was standard or OKAY. No wow factor.
- I got the NY Bites, which was basically short ribs. It was a small portion, and the beef was cooked well but ... nothing that blew my mind, either. Also, it took a pretty long time to come out, so we waited and waited and no one checked in on us.

Cocktails:
- They have a yelp check-in offer for a mixed cocktail shot
- We ordered another round of drinks and it never came... back to the service.

Overall, decent but not a place that I need to go back to."

Okay, so maybe it&#39;s been around and we just haven&#39;t experienced it up north, but it was certainly a perfectly executed new experience for us.
The uni bibimbop and sushi burrito had well-balanced and bold flavors paired with very fresh seafood--I especially love all the textures in both, offset by the crunchy roe. The bibimbop is a large meal, accompanied by salad, soup, and kimchi.
We added the dumplings, which had a nice American twist--deep fried? Anyways, thick, flavorful crunchy shell.
We ended with the churros, made in house, which were reminiscent of homemade frybread.
And the service was so lovely. Thanks guys! We&#39;ll be back."

We made plans with a friend and her bf to grab dinner here. The morning we were suppose to meet up, I saw that Barn Joo is offering a Travelzoo deal for $29 that consisted of two appetizers, one BBQ and a pitcher of drinks.  Score!  What a great deal and how fortuitous is the timing!  We purchased two deals for the four of us to use during dinner and anxiously awaited dinner time. Perhaps our expectations were too high (how can it not be with SUCH high Yelp rating), but our meal was such a let down!  I was actually debating between 2 and 3 stars for this review but decided to bump it up due to the beautiful decor, and the good Travelzoo deal. 

For appetizers, we&#39;ve decided to order the Korean Escargot, Tuna Mayo, Fish Pancake and Nacho Pork. None of the four dishes actually stood out, if I had to pick, it would probably be the Korean Escargot.  All four dishes were mediocre, the pork was not very flavorful and the bruschetta with the tuna was so hard that I couldn&#39;t bite through.

For the BBQ course, we picked Wagyu and USDA prime.  They were both very tasty and the best part of the meal, although the portion was tiny.  

We were still starving after the appetizers and BBQ, so decided to add an order of fried chicken.   For $25, I was expecting a bigger portion.  Ultimately it didn&#39;t really matter as the chicken was not flavorful and the breading was thick, we ended up not finishing the dish. 

A quick note on the two pitchers of drinks we received with the Travelzoo voucher.  Instead of just plain ice, they give you this &#34;ice popsicle&#34; that with fruits embedded in them. It was a nice touch. We tried Peachtree and Pomberry, I personally thought both were extremely sweet, but the rest of the table liked them. 

Regarding the service, the servers were all very nice but seemed disorganized. We were there for an early dinner, so the place was half empty, but started to fill up as the dinner went on. The servers were extremely busy with the different table BBQs that we had trouble flagging one down to place the chicken order.  Once the order was in, we waited 15 min before checking on the order. I think our server forgot to put in the order as a number of other servers stopped by to confirm the order.  They kept telling us that it was coming and a manager (I think) stopped by to apologize after another 10 min.  We eventually got the chicken approximately 40 min after our order. I understand that it is still a relatively new restaurant and they are working out the kinks, but they should&#39;ve just been honest about the wait time. 

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and I liked how it is away from the hustle and bustle of central ktown in 32nd st.  However, I was not impressed with the food, and that should be the most important criteria when judging a restaurant."

Normally I really don&#39;t care for it much, but I really enjoyed it at Barn Joo. The portion was perfect for lunch (knowing that I had dinner plans later that night), but for an additional $3, you could get dumplings and soup with your meal. The best thing about this place is that if you check-in for the first time here, you get a free soju shot. Free liquor? Count me in!"

I was rather shocked that I&#39;ve never notice this restaurant in the area - given the fact that I am always hanging around k-town or Herald Square area. I learned that this is the 2nd location of the original Barn Joo in Flatiron district, just with slightly less selection and different dishes in comparison to the original restaurant. 

My boyfriend and I walked in starving around 10pm-ish, were seated immediately by our hostess on the first floor (unfortunately the 2nd floor was closed for the evening) and were given menus to decide on what we wanted to eat. The atmosphere is dimly lit with a very eye-catching moon wall decor located in the middle of the gastro pub. Our table was right next to the moon decor and I find it to be super soothing sitting close to it. 

The menus are easy to elaborate: featuring lots of mouth-watering food and delicious looking cocktail photos. My boyfriend then decided to order a draft of Sapporo, and I checked in on YELP for the free soju cocktail shot. Our waiter brought out our drinks very quickly - my bf&#39;s beer and also not just one, but 2 shots of soju cocktail for both of us with different flavors - Midtown Forsythia and Pomberry. I shared both shots with my bf and I liked the Midtown Forsythia better - then proceed to order a glass size of the drink as my cocktail. It wasn&#39;t until after we finished ordering, we realize Barn Joo 35 plays really good music! The meaning behind Barn Joo in Korean means musical or drink accompaniment with your meal. It features good jazz and some other pop/house music - it relaxes and definitely makes your meal more enjoyable!

Now for the main course - we both had such a hard time deciding on what to get. All the tapas and entrees looks and &#39;sounds&#39; delicious! After a long deliberation, we decided to go with the uni and octopus bimbimbap. Lately, uni (sea urchin) is such a popular trendy food among many social media users (see lots of trending post on Instagram, Facebook and also Pinterest etc.) and as a first timer, I decided to give it a try and see how &#39;hyped&#39; uni is! 

Our food arrived shortly after and we began to dig in - WOWZA! Uni was so soft with hints of its original seafood saltiness, mixed with the still warm rice and various ingredients. To me, uni acted like cheese when I was mixing up the bimbimbap...! It was slowing &#39;melting away&#39; in my bowl and the flavor is so powering when I scooped a spoonful into my mouth. (Makes me drool just thinking about it now!)

Only down side of the entire meal experience - wasabi tobiko from the bimbimbap and our waiter forgot my Midtown Forsythia. I am not a fan of wasabi so tasting that wasabi flavor was not a pleasant experience. However, the entire presentation of the uni bimbimbap to its flavor is amazing - I personally prefer it without the wasabi tobiko. As for the drink, I had to wave down another waiter near the end of the meal to receive my glass of soju cocktail. 

Speaking of the glass size Midtown Forsythia - it was delicious and the cutest part is that it features a signature candy rock, AKA a ball-shaped ice cube with raspberry frozen inside. Did I mention the drink is only $6!? Such a perfect portion for a small drink with an adorable presentation!

I have yet to discover the rest of the tapas and drink selections from the menu this time. Guess I will do so next time when I am back for more! Please give this cute and cozy gastropub a try and... A thumbs up? (LOL)"

Pleasant space with my modern Korean lunch special was satisfying. 

Bulgogi Hotstone Bibimbap Platter ($15)
American Korean deliciousness; the crisp, tawny pleasures of pork dumplings that I opted pork over veggie was filling and packed of flavors. It reminded of that thick gooey deliciousness of Bonchon wings but it&#39;s a dumpling. 
Small side Kimchi had a good crunch texture with a slight kick of heat but nothing overpowering. It was a office worker friendly side, less or nothing of garlic in this Kimchi. 
The salad dressing was something that I often make at home, lightly seasoned with fish sauce. It is one of my secret ingredients to make my quick-easy salad dressing. I make mine a bit sweeter than Barn Joo but none the less, I finished the salad first on my tray.
Another good surprise was the soup. Looked like a regular sweeter white miso soup that we get at most Japanese restaurants. BJ&#39;s miso soup was made from Korean miso and had a wonderful kick off heat. That was my first and definitely I stored it as one of my exciting memories in my life.  
The main that I chose, beef Bulgogi over brown rice(?), was seasoned well and did not need any sauce. But I asked for Gochujang sauce only because my table next to me asked for and my heightened curiosity. It turned out to be a surprise. This Barn Joo&#39;s Gochujang sauce was luscious and I tasted something familiar behind the usual Gochujang sauce, Mexican mole sauce? I am not sure BJ&#39;s Gochujang had chocolate mixing in their sauce? It must coming back to find out about it."

We ordered the soy garlic wings and it was delicious! They were plump, crispy and piping hot. Much better than bon chon in my opinion!

The truffle fries were nothing special. They tasted exactly how they are supposed to taste but I guess it&#39;s a good finger food/side dish to have.

We also ordered the Wagyu beef, which comes with a tiny bbq grill at the table. The portion is small but the quality is good. 

Of course we couldn&#39;t leave without ordering their uni bibimbop! The bowl was a bit smaller than I thought it would be. However, the uni was pretty fresh but the rest of the dish lacked a bit of flavor. 

Before we left, the chef gave us a complimentary dessert. Coincidentally, it was their homemade churros, which I was actually eyeing on the menu earlier but was too full to order it."

The atmosphere of the first floor is lively and well-lit, but sadly I could not say the same for what I sat through on the second floor of Barn Joo. It was so dark that my friends and I had difficulty reading the menu, or seeing what dishes were placed in front of us without being inches away from the plates, which were quite small. 

What I ordered:
Tuna Mayo
Nacho Belly
Kimchi Pancake
Spicy Pork
Bulgogi 

Although rated as a $$ establishment, $$$ is a better representation of the cost you will incur if you don&#39;t want to leave hungry because the portions are so small, and while I understand that this is a place to order many small dishes to accompany drinks, I just did not find the flavors of the spicy pork, bulgogi, or tuna to be as appealing and unique as others have made them out to be to justify the cost. 

The brightest star for Barn Joo comes in the form of very accommodating waitstaff, tastefully designed interior, and a well-functioning and informative website. The food at Barn Joo 35 was by no means bad, but nothing was particularly outstanding."

Uni bibimbap: my favorite of the night. The uni itself was just alright - not the freshest that I&#39;ve had, but not the worst. I liked this dish because of the mix of all the other ingredients, and there was a good balance of both texture (crunchy and soft) and flavors.

Hot stone bulgogi: this was also good, but I&#39;ve had better dolsot bibimbap. The bulgogi was a bit too sweet for my taste.

Galbi dumplings: nothing hugely special, but again, I liked it.

Kimchi pancake: I really didn&#39;t like this one. It was covered and practically dripping in grease, and fell apart super easily.

Bulgogi tacos: again, bulgogi was a bit too sweet for me (and I know bulgogi is supposed to be sweet). The guacamole and salsa that came with it were both refreshing.

Lychee soju cocktail: free with check in, with a super cute ice sphere! I enjoyed this drink.

Service was also very friendly, from the hostess to the various servers. I would go back to try more things if friends wanted to go, but there are other good places in Ktown."

Since it was still before 7:00, a friend and I caught the tail end of Happy Hour, and ordered the truffle fries and glasses of wine. The fries came out quickly, and were hot and tasty. The wine pour was light, though, and didn&#39;t even appear to be a full glass.

As a main we ordered the udon seafood stew for two, which was delicious! Brimming with shrimp, mussels, clams, and squid, the sauce had a flavorful kick, and the udon was cooked al dente.

Furthermore, the service was both fast and friendly, and the ambiance was hip.

We were seated right away but I think if you have a party larger than two, you&#39;ll probably have to wait for a table. My boyfriend and I were actually passing by and were on our way to a different spot, but then I saw Barn Joo 35 on the menu board outside and remembered I had this place on my bookmarks list. So we decided to get in there and take advantage of the last 20 minutes of happy hour. 

Happy hour is 4-7. Kirin is $3, house wine is $5, and this rice wine is $4. The rice wine tasted like a mix of soju, beer, and yogurt milk. I&#39;m not sure how I felt about this. It&#39;s odd, but it didn&#39;t taste bad.

For food, we ordered a few of their happy hour apps. The tuna crostini and the wings. I liked the crostini but it&#39;s pretty small so each person probably needs their own, even though it comes with 4 pieces. The wings had a great flavor to them but they seem to have over fried them. It was a little dry. 

Their other menu items sound good and are at a very reasonable price for this area so I&#39;ll definitely come back to try some of their other food."

- Lunch Special: Uni Bibimbap ($9) with optional (+$3) Nutty Salad and Vegetable Dumplings
-Kalbi Dumplings 
-Tofu and Kimchi 

Uni Bibimbap
I&#39;m incredibly in love w/ UNI. 
There&#39;s a lot of different textures going on in your mouth: 
The soft buttery-ness of uni, the crunchiness of the quinoa, three different types of sweet and salty masago (fish eggs) that pop in your mouth, comes all over a bed of white rice. It also includes a side of chopped up kimchi, Korean-style pickled cucumber, lettuce and spring greens. 
It&#39;s recommended to mix it all up, I like to keep it a little separated so you can experience the flavors of the ingredients individually and your mouth doesn&#39;t get too bored. But it&#39;s far far from boring!

It came with a side of slightly spicy miso soup w/ green onions, Nutty mixed green salad, kimchi, and 2 Vegetable Dumplings.

Vegetable Dumplings
I didn&#39;t even realized there was no meat in there. It&#39;s lightly fried, sprinkled with sesame seeds and seasoning and 100% YUM. 

Kalbi Dumplings 
According to my friend, the Kalbi Dumplings, tasted like real Kalbi, but now instead of get big serving size you can get it in dumpling form! Comes with 3 pieces. 

Tofu and Kimchi 
The tofu were little fried nuggets of deliciousness with a side of wilted kimchi. The kimchi was aged perfectly and had the right texture that complimented the bite size tofu! 

All my plates were clean and empty! A sign of a good meal! 

SERVICE: 
It&#39;s so awesome when restaurants leave a bottle of water at your leisure whenever your glass get empty. When our vintage &#34;milk&#34; water bottle was empty, it was quickly replaced by the server. 
The staff didn&#39;t rush us at the end! I love that! 

DECOR:
LOVE IT! Feels upscale, Hipster-esque, Metal Chairs, wooden tables, wooden trays, Wooden Walls, Wood everything! Very sustainable! My friend and I joked about how the big moon in the middle is actually representative of a big radish.

My friend suggested going to Barn Joo 35, since he had a Travel Zoo voucher. The Yelp reviews looked promising enough, so we gave it a try. Barn Joo doesn&#39;t take reservations, but when we arrived around 6:45 pm, we were seated almost immediately, which is awesome cause most Ktown restaurants can get pretty packed around the dinner hour. 

We spotted the happy hour menu and promptly ordered all of the food items and and several drinks. From the Travel Zoo voucher, we also ordered two apps and a BBQ platter to share. For six people, we ordered: the Fried Tiger Roll, Crunchy Tofu, Truffle Fries, Fried Asparagus, Korean Escargot, Tuna Mayo, Nacho Belly, Soy Garlic Wings, Hot &amp; Spicy Wings, Uni Bibimbap, Lychee Soju and various drinks. We wanted to order the cheesy corn, but the waiter informed us that the menu price of $8 was incorrect and it was actually $14 (wtf?!), so we nixed that.  

The only items that really stood out was the korean escargot, the truffle fries, and the lychee soju. The escargot packed a punch of flavor in a tiny bite, the truffle fries were perfectly seasoned and had a beautiful crunch. The lychee soju was whimsical with the fruit ice. 

The Uni Bibimbap was disappointing, as it didn&#39;t have much flavor beyond the uni While the rest of the meal was alright - I do want to call out the BBQ platter in particular as it was quite literally the smallest portion I&#39;ve ever seen for korean bbq. The grill was smaller than my hand, which makes sense given the tiny portions. While it seems like we ordered a lot of food, the portions were definitely tapas-sized, including the BBQ. 

After 1.5 hours into the meal, we all came to the consensus that we would not get full at Barn Joo without spending at least $300+ on dinner, so we asked for the check to go to another restaurant. While the service had been decent throughout the night, things soured when we noticed that we were charged full price for one of the drinks ordered during the happy hour. We flagged down our server, who literally fought us about it and claimed we ordered the drink after happy hour ended. In reality, what had happened was that we ordered the drink right at the beginning of the meal (during happy hour), but the waiter forgot one person&#39;s drink and we had to remind him to bring the drink. Ultimately, the waiter begrudgingly adjusted the prices but it left such a sour note on the experience."

My style of Korean comes from eating banchan out of Tupperware bowls and delivery service jjajjangmyun. Korean food for me is more home style and about taste less presentation. That&#39;s exactly how the food at barn joo is, fancy Korean without maximizing the taste potential.

The other problem with my meal was it was catered to a vegetarian which makes options limited. We had japchae, steamed dumplings, scallion pancake, and crispy tofu. The crispy tofu was the most tasty thing complete with gochuchang taste and a side of what seemed to be fried and diced kimchee. Everything else felt like it could use an extra dash of sesame and red pepper flakes flavor.

This place is very popular despite my meh experience so I&#39;m assuming a meat filled meal will knock my socks off. Also I was happy I didn&#39;t have to pay for the soju cocktail. I think there was more water than soju in it at at 18 per cocktail it&#39;s underwhelming for sure. Until then I scrutinize like only a Korean is capable."

The dining hall was already 80% filled.  The inside of the restaurant was loud with music playing and various groups talking.  So the vibe of this restaurant is more so for gatherings rather than a date night.  There&#39;s a second floor that had a few more tables.  We were told that the second floor&#39;s for bigger groups, it&#39;s so much quieter on the second floor. 

After we got our table, we saw people pouring in non-stop.  This shows how popular this restaurant is.

You get a free soju cocktail when you check in on Yelp.  It&#39;s a lychee flavored soju cocktail that is super delicious!

Their menu looks like a scrapbook as they inserted Polaroids of food items to show you what the items look like.  Prices for food are very reasonable, most dishes are under $15.  We ordered the spicy pork with a side of rice ($2 extra) and bulgogi beef with a side of rice ($2 extra).  They do serve the multi-grain rice, so make sure you specify if you wanted a healthier version of rice.  

Our food came in smaller portion (you get what you pay for, as most dishes would be going for $7-$8 more at other Korean restaurants, and this place is more so for small plates style), with a miso soup.  However, it was quiet filling for me! 

The spicy pork and bulgogi beef were so delicious, they both had a smoky barbecue flavor to it and came with some onions and peppers.   My friend and I devoured everything in 15 minutes :) 

The only downside is that they only have 2 items on the dessert menu, and our server recommended the cheesecake decorated with fruits, she said it&#39;s a beautiful presentation.  For desserts, honestly, I would suggest going to Spot desserts couple blocks down on 32nd street instead.  

Our bill came, with the free soju cocktails, it was only around $30 for 2 people. 

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant, the food is great and their service is impeccable, several people stopped by to pour water into our cups from the carafe they put on the table.  And the manager checked on us to see if everything&#39;s ok.  When we left the restaurant, someone at the restaurant would hold the door for us and thank us for our business. 

I can&#39;t wait to come back with my friends to try more dishes here!!!  P.S. On my way out, I noticed that they have a happy hour menu with $3 beers and some bar bites.  I would totally check that out one day."

We ordered two bulgogi plates which were very tender, the truffle fries were very tasty.  We also ordered hot stone bowels of bulgogi and spicy pork, both were excellent.  We tried the New bibimbap which was sashimi over pickled mixed vegetables. Also, we tried the tuna mayo and nacho belly both are good. 
The service was excellent and the servers very attentive yet unobtrusive.  We enjoyed the meal and would highly recommend the restaurant."

There&#39;s so much more opportunity to disappoint with a tapas-style menu, but Barn Joo wowed me with every dish I ordered. We got a happy hour drink each - it was a sake and Sprite mix - surprisingly delicious!

We also ordered:

1. Shrimp Ceviche ($12): Three whole soy-sauce marinated shrimp came with three rice balls - it was like deconstructed sushi, almost. I was surprised to see the shrimp come whole - I was expected a more typical chopped up ceviche, but the whole shrimp definitely was visually impactful. It tasted great too, with the sweet raw shrimp flesh complementing the soy sauce marinade nicely.
2. Nacho Belly ($9): If I had to pick my least favorite dish, it would probably be the Nacho Belly, but even then this was like a decent 3.5 out of 5. It was a slice of pork belly served on a tortilla chip, and my gripe with it was that it was a bite-sized portion that was a little bit too big, but the meat was not tender enough for me to turn it into a two-biter. It tasted great though. There were four portions.
3. Fish Pancake ($9): This fish pancake wowed me with its simplicity. I am familiar with fried fish cake, but this has an amazingly tender texture with a slight QQ bounce. They got the fish paste to filler ratio just right, as too much fish can result in a crumbly texture and too much filler can feel dense. This had three pancakes.
4. Buns Galbi ($14): This was served in Chinese-style flap buns with marinated beef. The beef was so tender and the bulgogi sauce was truly a flavor explosion. A must have, in my opinion!

I am coming back!"

The food is fairly good and the decor, though inexplicable, is nice. The happy hour prices are a pretty good bang for your buck so i&#39;d definitely recommend getting in early. The wings you can get on hh discount make them a solid deal and I&#39;d recommend getting both flavors, with the spicy being relatively mild. The bulgogi buns were fairly good, and the meat was interestingly more like a giant meatball than the normal small slices of beef."

Went on a Friday night as a group of 4 and the wait was only about 25 mins. Everything on the menu was absolutely delicious. I started with the raspberry mojito which was very refreshing and tasty. The tapas style is convenient and fun. We just kept ordering till we were full. Some of my favorites were: Tuna Mayo appetizer, Buns Galbi, and Vegetable Japchae. It&#39;s a nice switch up from the usual pub scene in Midtown. Good for small groups or a date night."

Get the whole fried chicken and ask for the garlic soy sauce on the side. Then ask for more. Best tasting bonchon style chicken I&#39;ve ever had! And it&#39;s a whole chicken!!! A little pricey but good atmosphere, great drinks, and did I mention how good their chicken was?!???"

Most of the wait staff is young, attractive and attentive. The free soju shot is a nice check in offer and it looks like the drinks are decently priced. My biggest issue with barnjoo is the portion size, the price and the washing out of that authentic Korean food feel that I&#39;m used to. I ordered a dolsot bulgogi bibimbap. When I told this to the waiter, he , I guess corrected me and said &#34;so you mean the hot stone beef bowl&#34;. LOOK. The waiter was Korean. He KNEW what I meant. I didn&#39;t throw together those words and not know what I was ordering. It was just so strange to me. Like as if I had no clue what I was ordering and it had to be confirmed in English words that I never use when ordering Korean food. The bibimbap was the smallest I&#39;ve ever had. A small but deep bowl made it exceptionally difficult to stir any ingredients together. I had to ask for gochujang on the side, since they don&#39;t serve it with bibimbap???? There was a small miso soup that came with it as well. The bibimbap, again, was difficult to eat because of how narrow the bowl was. But it only had bulgogi, some green leaves and the egg. Missing the total plethora of ingredients that usually go in bibimbap. And all of this was.. 17$ I believe? Was I full? Yes. But I wasn&#39;t &#34;satisfied&#34; with my meal. My friend ordered a kimchi pajun. It looked kind of gooey or doughy. He was not too thrilled and said his parents would be disappointed at him for ordering pajun when they eat it at home all the time. 
AGAIN, barnjoo has a totally cute atmosphere, good service, attractive people working there. But if you&#39;re looking for some down home Korean food, there are plenty of other places near by to go to."

Wonderful service even when the place is packed. My husband and I each had the hot rice bowls. It&#39;s filled with brown rice and quinoa along with veggies and your choice of protein. The bowl is seriously hot so I recommend not touching. With that said it&#39;s great for keeping your food warm the entire time so you don&#39;t end up with cold food half way through the meal. 

We also enjoyed the calamari which was perfect. It was fried perfectly without being over cooked and definitely not chewy. Great dinner place that also has good happy hour options."

Brought my vegan girlfriend and my bear of a friend Zach. 

They have a wide range of incredibly tasty vegan offerings such as the fried tofu, vegetable dumplings, and mushroom tofu sizzling bowl. 

I also ordered a fried sushi volcano roll, short rib, truffle fries, uni rice bowl thing, fluke ceviche, and a sizzling wagyu cook it yourself dish. 

The short rib was to die for, truffle fries were on point, uni was good but Zach ate that, and the wagyu cooked at the table was a fantastic experience. 

The fluke ceviche was disappointing because despite the generous amount of fluke, I couldn&#39;t taste it at all because of the overpowering spicy broth sauce it was in. Shame. Not my taste I suppose. 

Soju great as always. 

The rose by the glass was actually a Pet Nat that night so that was a very pleasant surprise. 

Zach and I finished off our meal with two glasses of Suntory Hibiki Japanese whisky which I love and was very happy that they had.  

While I wasn&#39;t intending to spend 288 on dinner (decided to treat Zach) I&#39;ll say that it was immensely enjoyable and someplace I would return again and again. 

By the way the service is AMAZING. Especially the little lady zinging around. I would just catch her eye for a second and she&#39;d immidietly come over to ask what I need. NOW THATS SERVICE!!

Happy eating!"

I must say the customer service is amazing !!! They greeted us with gratitude. The ambience of this place makes me feel very welcomed. 

The food was amazing as well. Although the hey only had one sushi roll in the whole menu (tiger roll) but it was delicious! While my friends and I were eating, a waiter came around and gave everyone a free lychee soju shot!!! How nice of them ? 

While we were almost done with our shaved ice dessert, a waiter came in with a free cheesecake dessert which took me by surprise. He said it was on the house :). How freaking awesome is that ?? I also looked around to see if others got it as well and we were the only table that got the free free for some reason :).

We intended to go to Herald Square for dinner, but I had been whining about my Korean food cravings for so long that when we realized how close Koreantown was, we came straight here. The restaurant was nicely decorated and packed with people. Not one of those places that was so packed to the roof that there&#39;s not enough oxygen to breath, but just enough for it to be fun and animated.

The Yelp complimentary soju cocktails were delicious and beautiful. The tuna mayo was light and satisfying, and hot stone bulgogi was sizzling and mouth-watering. The meal was just what we needed after a long day at the office.

I came for happy hour around 5:30pm on a Thursday with a friend, and only a few tables were occupied. They have a $5 happy hour that includes house wines and makgeoli (unfiltered rice wine). I started with a glass of white wine while I waited for my friend to arrive and ordered some small plates. I read a lot of reviews praising the NY bites (marinated short ribs topped with sesame seeds and microgreens), so I ordered that and the fried asparagus (sesame battered asparagus with kimchi mayo) per the recommendation of the waitress. 

The NY bites marinade was extremely flavorful, but DO NOT order this is you are not very comfortable with your company. This is extremely chewy, and you will need to use your hands and teeth to get the meat off the bone. You will also likely need a toothpick or floss to get the food out of your teeth. I looked like a caveman trying to eat it, but it was oh so delicious. The asparagus was actually my favorite. That is saying a lot coming from me because I&#39;m actually not a big fan of asparagus and was hesitant to order it at all. However, the sesame batter provides great crunch, and the battered asparagus pairs well with the kimchi mayo.

When my friend finally arrived, she caught up with a glass of wine herself, and we each were able to get a soju cocktail by checking in on Yelp. They brought out a bong bong (soju, st. germaine elderflower liqueur, white grape juice, skinless whole grapes) &amp; pomberry (soju, chambord black raspberry liqueur, pomegranate juice). I loved the fresh white grape flavor, and both came with Barn Joo&#39;s &#34;signature candy rocks,&#34; which are sphered ice cubes with pieces of fruit frozen in them. Each of the ice spheres are on a wooden rod, so you can eat it like a lollipop once you have finished the cocktail. I loved these!

Around 6-6:30pm is when it really started getting busy. Every table was occupied, and while the service did slow down a bit, the waiters were still very accommodating and friendly. As we continued our girl talk, we fit in 2 glasses of makgeoli each, and then suddenly, a waiter gave us 2 more soju cocktails! Not sure what we did to deserve these, but we were extremely grateful! This time, we both tried the midtown forsythia (soju, st. germaine elderflower liqueur, lychee juice, orange juice, whole lychee). You can never go wrong with lychee :) 

When happy hour finally ended, we were well liquored up and ready to hop to our next spot in Ktown. My friend paid $17 and got her 5 drinks, while I paid $29 for my 5 drinks and 2 plates of food. One of the best happy hour deals I have ever experienced. Unfortunately, this location doesn&#39;t take reservations, but if you go to the Flatiron location, make sure you do!

There were a ton of other items on the menu that sounds delicious as well. Uni bibimbap, I&#39;m comin&#39; back for ya!"

We sat down and showed our waitress the Yelp check-in for a free Soju cocktail and they brought it right away, it was light and delicious. 

The space was decent, two floors and the tables were not put too closely together. Service ended up being quite quick given that the entire second floor had just been seated at the same time. The standout dishes were the crunchy tofu on a bed of kimchi as well as the crisp scallion pancake. While we were waiting for our dessert they even brought a second round of complimentary Soju cocktails which was an unexpected delight. 

The staff was also exceedingly kind and professional. Ultimately Barn Joo 35 is a great choice for a happy hour easy dinner in Midtown West area and I would definitely go again."

We ordered the following for two people:
-Korean meatballs
-Steamed pork dumplings
-Spicy chicken wings
-Wagyu table bbq
-Truffle fries
-Mocha bingsu

For beverages, we ordered a carafe of the Midtown Forsythia, which was light and refreshing -- a perfect drink for a ninety-plus degree day. The carafe came out to about 2.5 drinks per person.

With the exceptions of the truffle fries (the truffle oil tasted a little off to me) and the shaved ice in the bingsu (which had an odd texture), everything was amazing!

I especially recommend the table bbq, which is awesome because you get to cook it yourself at the table."

restaurant was pretty empty today during lunch. i suppose the best time to go is happy hour, of which i will have to try soon! !!"

Think of fusion, Korean-styled tapas: that&#39;s what the food at Barn Joo is like. The portions are all quite small (tacos come in 3&#39;s, dumplings come in 2&#39;s, the scallion pancake was also very small for a $13 dish), and quite pricey. Even the bibimbap, which costs anywhere from $13 to $16, comes in a small rice bowl, so be ready to spend about $20 a person for a semi-filling meal.

The entire place was crowded, but our party of 5 was seated immediately in a temporary four-person table. After we ordered our food, they kindly moved us over to a more appropriate space. We each ordered one item and split the scallion pancakes, but throughout the meal, we were offered their classic soju cocktail AND an order of chicken wings on the house! I guess they made too any orders, so they brought it over to us. So, so, so kind of them! Regardless of the free food, the wait staff was extremely cordial from start to finish and always asked if we needed anything else. A+!"

Though it&#39;s actually located a few blocks north of ktown, the food and drinks are awesome and prices are really great. It&#39;s not traditional korean food, it&#39;s more &#39;upscale&#39; / &#39;gourmet&#39; / japanese/korean &#39;fusion&#39; but in a way that remains faithful to the traditional. As a result the portions are smaller (and they have Korean-inspired tapas dishes which are AWESOME), but in my opinion you definitely get way more bang for your buck here than at any of the restaurants on 32nd st. However, you might have to wait a bit for a table - our party of 3 had to wait about 10-15 minutes at 9pm on Friday.

Also the Yelp check-in offer for a free glass of the soju cocktail is dope!! I got the lychee one and my friend got the white grape one, both were really yummy &amp; come with a really cool lollipop-resembling ice cube

As for the food, here&#39;s what I tried:

TAPAS/SHARED:
+Tuna mayo - really great. Like.. bruschetta with tuna sashimi &amp; mayo instead of tomato. Delicious!!
+Bulgogi tacos - OMG so good. comes with guac, salsa &amp; 3 tortillas. There&#39;s a lot more meat in this than we expected, so I recommend you add on the extra 3 tortilla&#39;s
+Kimchi/bacon pancake - this was my fave because it&#39;s a combo I would&#39;ve never thought of that worked so well.

I also got to try my friend&#39;s spicy pork dish, which is really delicious too. They cook their meat really well, both the bulgogi and pork were very tender &amp; flavorful!

The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the uni bibimbap, which is the reason why I wanted to try Barn Joo. As a whole, it was good &amp; a decent portion, but the uni wasn&#39;t the freshest, unfortunately. Maybe it was just an off day.

By the end of the meal we were all stuffed and satisfied, and only paid about $30 a person! I definitely want to explore more of the menu in the future - like the table-side wagyu beef BBQ and the seafood dishes!"

For tapas, I tried the escargot which was super tough to eat. They were like escargot on steroids. I also tried the pork belly bites and it was also very tough to chew. I had expected to be fattier since it was supposed to be pork belly. The flavor was also lacking. For my entree, I ordered the spicy pork hot stone bowl which came with miso soup. The soup was over salted and you could barely taste the miso and all I could taste was the hot sauce for the spicy pork bowl. My friend ordered the bulgogi hot stone bowl and was also unsatisfied with her dish. Sadly, the best part of the meal were the truffle fries. If I come back it would be for their happy hour $1 oysters and their chicken wings since Koreans are known for their fried chicken (BonChon!)"

Seattle, but it&#39;s New F&#39;in York, and there&#39;s lots of competition and I feel people need to step up their game. 

I had the spicy pork hot bowl and the korean meatballs. 

The meatballs were definitely 4 stars worthy, but the hot bowl is bleh. The bowl is so hot that it&#39;s still untouchable at the end of the meal, and the rice at the bottom didn&#39;t just get crispy, it&#39;s burnt to a blackened crisp. 

The decor was lovely though, but that didn&#39;t earn them extra points because I yelp based mostly on food deliciousness. The service was also quite good, but again, didn&#39;t earn them extra points... it did, however, earned them a big tip. 

I might go back, but given how many amazing restaurants there are in the city, I&#39;d be hard press to return."

This is the 2nd location as the 1st location is around union square/flatiron area. 

The service is friendly and can speak Korean and English perfectly. The food is just mehhhh

I think my fave dish was the dooboo kimchi or &#34;crunchy tofu&#34;. 

The beef ball or fried meatball was just whatever. 

The tong dak or fried chicken (1/2 size) was just whatever. I was expecting badenbaden style, but that was not the case. The fried chicken was fried perfectly; it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, but i think they forgot the seasoning. It was bland (where was the salt?) 

As a caveat, and don&#39;t be a sucker and buy the 1st US brand of soju. Tokki soju does not taste like soju. Instead it tastes like moonshine.

I had high expectations of this place and was thoroughly disappointed. There are other places around Ktown that serve better gastropub foods."

The Beef Dumplings though were outstanding.  Perfectly fried with a thin crispy wrapping, but loaded with beef!  They were also coated with a layer of hot sauce, I&#39;d really recommend getting these.  For the drinks, we had a couple of the soju&#39;s.

Service: It was a mixed bag. The waiters were genuinely warm. One of the waiters asked us if we ordered the Uni Bibimbap and then proceeded to ask others around us. Utensils were also dropped on other patrons but they quickly apologized.

Food: One of us was hungry and ordered the half fried chicken. My friend thought the chicken was bland and lacked seasoning and spices. I had a bite and I thought it could use a bit more. I wasn&#39;t hungry so I got the calamari sausage under the entree selections. For $15 one would expect a lot more than what showed up. It was three tiny calamari stuffed with finely diced vegetables and grain under a small bed of soy sauce. If it&#39;s an appetizer, please list it as an appetizer. Also the stuffing was under seasoned and tasted mealy. 

Atmosphere: Loud because of the hard surfaces. We sat really close to the table next to ours."

We waited around 20 min for a table for two, and fortunately there was space at the bar in the meantime. The place was so crowded we didn&#39;t even realize there was an upper floor until a waitress politely told us our seats were ready. 

Drinks in hand, we were navigated to our table. In contrast to the lively lower level, the upper level was a bit barren. We ordered two beers, and it took FOREVER to arrive...

Anyway, I ordered the bulgogi and my friend ordered the octopus bibimbap. 

Around 20 minutes elapsed, and the waiter accidentally delivered our food to the wrong table...the waiter so graciously apologized, assured us that the food &#34;wasn&#39;t touched&#34;, and offered us a free cocktail. I mean, I&#39;m always down for a free drink. No harm no foul, right? 


So strictly based on the food, I was a tad disappointed in the lack of flavor, and the ridiculously small portion of the bulgogi. The meat was so bland, nothing really out of the ordinary. And for the price? Completely unacceptable. 

As for my friend&#39;s meal, there was BARELY any octopus. She sifted through her rice in hopes to find generous pieces of octopus, and they were simply microscopic. But the biggest tragedy of all, was that her bibimbap wasn&#39;t even accompanied by an egg. Tsk tsk.

Bottom line: lovely decor, a cool atmosphere (mainly the lower level), awesome customer service, but really overpriced food."

The best thing was the NY bites ($18). Steak was super tender and tasty. I would definitely get this again next time. Second best was the korean escargot. Chewy, meaty and delicious! Yum yum yum. I love snails.

Had a great time with my family and will come back again. Remember to bring a sweater because it was a bit chilly inside. The bathrooms are on the basement floor. Dining rooms are at street level and on a second floor. Cozy, loud, chill atmosphere.

On the other hand, service was spectacular. The recommendations were on point, and even though we were there for hours, we didn&#39;t feel pressured to leave (we were still very conscientious of the door and table turnover).

Josie, our server, made a few menu recommendations and to our delight her recommendations were spot on!  The short ribs were flavorful without being too fatty. I actually tasted more meat than fat, which is not always the case when indulging in a plate or Korean short ribs. The Korean chicken tacos also yummy. For a girl with small stomach who hates to waste food, the dish was the perfect portion size - not too much, not too little. And then there was the spicy pork, which was our favorite. The dish was spicy enough to get the &#34;spice-high&#34; but not too spicy where you can&#39;t taste the food.

If you check-in you get a Free glass of soju cocktail which wasn&#39;t bad. We ordered the bibimbap - octopus ($14) and Bulgogi ($12). Their entrees were super small and flavorless. The bibimbap is not like the regular bibimbap you would get at a Korean restaurant. We wanted to order the soju cocktail just for the lollipop but was told by a waiter that their freezer broke therefore they were out of the lollipop. But moments after we realized the table across from us received a soju cocktail with the lollipop. We asked another waiter and was told that they only had a limited amount left. The waiter kindly offered us one on the house. The lollipop was nothing special just water frozen with fruits. We probably will not return. If i wanted good Korean food there is plenty near by.

Thoughts of an enhanced pedigree for this spot couldn&#39;t be helped... after all, the original location located on the border of Union Square and the Flatiron District has treated your&#39;s truly very well over the past few years (despite the Korean fare being offered at that establishment being a bit of a head-scratcher, in as far as the typical food offerings that can be found in that part of town).  With all of these aforementioned thoughts brewing in the brain pan, the mental calculus that took place in the mind of one (mine) could only generate one such conclusion upon hearing about the opening of Barn Joo 35... &#34;duh.&#34; 

The proximity to K-town is all too appropriate in this instance.  The classy (though rustic... somewhat) trappings that could be found at the OG location are beautifully replicated at this establishment.  I must say, I did miss the &#34;free food/booze/high five&#34; wheel of fortune... hopefully this place gets something along those lines... although the free soju cocktail (w/ yelp check in) offer was greatly appreciated.

I came here on Cinco de Mayo with my trio of Dora Milaje; this was stop number 3 after happy hour... so needless to say, at least half of our forces were well imbibed at that point.  Luckily, the food offerings dished out by this place were a tasty decision, and were effective at padding my stomach so the night&#39;s festivities could continue.  The Korean fried wings were tasty and not overly sauced... something I appreciated tremendously, as I was able to enjoy the crispy exterior uninhibited.  The truffle fries did a fine job of being the carby and faithful soldier, stalwart in it&#39;s abilities to fight intoxication and promote sobriety.  The seafood and kimchi pancakes were stylishly portioned, and allowed for a more &#34;hands on&#34; method of delivery from plate to mouth.  And lastly, the dumplings (mandoo? DUMPRINGS?!?!) were large deep fried pieces of juicy deliciousness that were good enough to almost make me forget that they come at a pricetag of $12 for 3 (large) pieces.

Overall, as good as the original (sans secret whiskey bar/basement and wheel of fortune)."
