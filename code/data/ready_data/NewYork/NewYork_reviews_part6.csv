I came here and did not regret my choice. 

Appetizer 

I ordered the prosciutto and melon and it was absolutely amazing. The honeydew was so sweet and the prosciutto was perfect. I honestly have not had better. My friends ordered the yogurt and granola and I had some and it was also amazing. I wish I would have ordered that as well, but that would be greedy. 

Food

I ordered the french toast and it was pretty good. It doesn&#39;t come with a side but it is definitely filling enough. My friend ordered the pesto pasta and it was also delicious. 

Price 

18.95 for an appetizer, entree, and unlimited mimosas/bloody marys. That is some of the best prices Ive seen. Completely worth it."

We arrived at around 1:30pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. While the restaurant wasn&#39;t too busy, there was a good number of groups coming in and out during our meal. 

Let me start by saying that $18.95 for an app, entree, and bottomless mimosas/bloody marys is AMAZING. Usually in Manhattan, you are paying $20+ just for the bottomless drinks portion of brunch! I ordered the spinach salad with gorgonzola and pear as my appetizer and the  smoked salmon eggs benedict as my entree. The food itself was decent. The salad was lightly dressed although the pears had a slightly strange texture. The eggs were poached well, and the smoked salmon was good but the toast was very dry. 

Overall, I&#39;d come back to Giovanni&#39;s for the drinks alone! Our waitress was very nice, service was great. Would like to see some tweaks to elevate the food a bit but honestly for the price, Giovanni&#39;s provides excellent value."

A friend and I went here for a nice summer Sunday brunch. The bottomless brunch was $19 for the appetizer, entree, mimosas, and bloody marrys. There were several decedent options to choose from that were all mouth watering. I opted for the baked eggs with polenta, which was out of this world!
Service was phenomenal- my glass was never empty! 
The place was so charming and the atmosphere was cozy and laid back. Definitely my new favorite brunch spot!"

Giovanni came over to us and talked to us - it was a very friendly feel. We tasted their two wine specials of the day and got a bottle of each. Very good.

For an appetizer, we got the calamari/zucchini fritti. It was pretty good, but it needed a little more seasoning.

For dinner, I had the pasta special, which was pappardelle in a champagne cream sauce with sundried tomatoes and scallops. Definitely some of the best pasta I&#39;ve ever had. I can&#39;t wait to come back here!"

The brunch menu is amazing. They have anything from French toast to pasta with sausage. And their mimosas were delicious. 

The only thing I had a problem with was that my French toast was a bit burnt on the bottom but not enough to like send it back. It was still pretty good. My friends had eggs Benedict with lox and home fries. We all took a small taste of each other&#39;s food and I&#39;m not a big fan of lox but apart of me wishes that I had ordered that. 

PSA: They will STOP serving you (unlimited mimosas or bloody Mary&#39;s) the minute they see you are about to finish your food so I would suggest you eat very slow. 

Other than all of that the inside was like being in someone&#39;s living room. It just had a good vibe and I definitely want to come back and try their meatballs at dinner!"

The expanded space is lovely. The service is good. There should be a place for your coats. 
However we both ordered the Insulata Italiano and both got old brown lettuce. My salad had one red pepper that wasn&#39;t cut up.
The salmon was lukewarm and dry and not well-spiced.
We would have sent the salads back but didn&#39;t want to make a scene.

This is my first time ordering food from Giovanni&#39;s and I was pretty excited because the two usual place where I got shrimp Parmesan were closed and I always wanted to try Giovanni&#39;s. Delivery was quick, much faster then what seamless suggested. When I opened up my bag and saw five pieces of shrimp for $13 I was pretty angry. On Seamless if you want the shrimp Parmesan you also have to pay extra for pasta, and additional four or six dollars, I thought I would get the large shrimp Parmesan but what I got was five pieces of shrimp and two pieces of stale bread that were wrapped in a paper towel. I thought to myself that this must be good because it received great reviews on Seamless but it&#39;s pretty basic. I love when my shrimp is overcooked (it&#39;s one of my guilty pleasures) but this shrimp that I got was way to overcooked where I couldn&#39;t even enjoy it. Tomato sauce, basic. When I called to ask &#34;is the shrimp Parmesan really only have five shrimp?&#34; The response was simply &#34;yes&#34;."

Giovanni&#39;s helped restore our faith (although it&#39;s a block off PPW). It&#39;s the little neighborhood Italian place that serves well made food and in a handsome environment run by warm and friendly people.
Great versions of many Italian staples. There&#39;s your burrata. There&#39;s pasta with broccoli rabe and sausage. Fish. Steak. 
Good prices. Good location. Adorable corner spot.

The place is small and around the 5:00 mark it filled up pretty quickly. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive and not long after being seated we had placed our order. The food arrived in a timely manner and everything was perfect, even for my picky family. My girlfriend and I enjoyed it so much that we ordered from them instead of cooking yesterday.

Bread is served cold and sliced thin with bland olive oil. Lots of specials listed off by the server. 

Overall portions are small, you can tell by the plate sizes. 3 Asparagus and 3 scallops appetizer in a sweet (honey?) glaze. Mussels in a tasty white wine sauce.  Grilled pork chop served with string beans had good portion and look well cooked. Eggplant parm had good sauce and was tender. Cavatelli with crab meat and lemon cream sauce lacked flavor unless eaten with the sundried tomatoes which there weren&#39;t many. Chocolate bread pudding was small and dry but the mascarpone I could eat by the spoonful. 

May come back to try tagliatelle.  I think the parms with pasta ($4) seem to be the specialty."

Was pleased by the architecture and brick walls, liked the vibe looking forward to it.  Ordered the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes, was very fresh and was anticipating a great main course. The entree was a big let down, the mushrooms came from a can? The meal seemed to be pre-made and just heated up when ordered, chicken was dry. It may have been it was late lunch and to early for dinner and was only one of two tables in the restaurant.
It is the staff that dropped the score, the server would go out and smoke on the sidewalk and then clear a plate or water a table, another server sat at the bar and talked loud with the bartender. Understand you are slow, but do not need to hear about your wild night. I was really hopping to give a great score."

ATMOSPHERE: I get that it&#39;s small, but it wasn&#39;t that busy and we were a party of 3, waiting on the 4th, and had to BEG them to let us sit down! We were going to order wine and an appetizer, and actually had to ask permission to order an appetizer since our 4th person wasn&#39;t there. Not the best restaurant etiquette. 

FOOD: Meh. I saw pics on here of the chicken parm and it looked good, so I ordered it, and mine was not yelp picture worthy. I could make a much better chicken parm, and I don&#39;t have 1% Italian in my bloodline. Maybe I should&#39;ve went with my gut and ordered the penne ala vodka. My friend got the steak, and it was so so, and my SO ordered the grilled chicken dish, and he said it was dry. 

DRINKS: Got a bottle of red, and it was good. Maybe not $32 good, but not bad. Probably the best part of the night. 

OVERALL: Honestly, I was so stressed out by the way we were handled in the beginning, that I barely got to enjoy my meal. Our server was sweet, but the blonde lady (maybe manager?) was the one who kept staring at us while we were waiting for the other person. I get that tardiness is looked down upon, but I didn&#39;t need to be squirming in my seat in a restaurant that I am dropping $100 on and am a paying customer. Not cool, Giovanni."

This place is very clean, to which they get one star, and our waitress was lovely, which got the second star, but that&#39;s as far as it goes for me. We had the arugula salad and baked clams to start.... The salad had very minimal dressing and a few shavings of cheese on top.  The clams.... We couldn&#39;t even finish. The breading was mushy and the clams in general had a very funny taste. They were not fresh at all and actually made me and my date feel queasy after eating one each.  Terrible first impression.
Then the main courses: lemon shrimp risotto and the short rib special. The short rib was probably the most decent part of the dining experience, the shrimp risotto had very little flavor, it was even missing the lemon which was surprising.
Overall very disappointing dining experience and I will not be returning."

Recently a few months back checked out their unlimited boozey brunch again with a friend. It&#39;s definitely a good bang for your buck. Only $18.95 for an appetizer, entree and unlimited mimosas or bloody marys. Waaaaaay back in the day this place used to be owned by the same people that owned Sette on 7th avenue, which is now closed. I thought their dinner was superb along with their wine selection. Fast forward a few years and came with my boyfriend at the time once or twice. Think whatever we had ordered wasn&#39;t great. The bread was big and bulky, the eggs were over done. The mimosas and bloody marrys not note-worthy, slow service. Fast forward a few years later and I think they finally have it right. The brunch I had was great. 

My friend had the Penne alla Fiorentina (spinach cream sauce with fresh ricotta cheese). It was really outstanding and a huge portion size. While I had had the double baked eggplant parmesan with fried eggs. A tasty and simple hearty meal. All served with chunks of crusty bread and a wonderful rosemary infused olive oil. What shone through for me was honestly their appetizers. We both ordered the same thing and no regrets. Get the honey drizzled Melon with prosciutto and pecorino cheese. The portion is enormous and the prosciutto is to die for. I&#39;ve also had the ricotta fritters years ago and remember those being very warm and decadent. If I were to come back again though I would definitely go with one of their pasta dishes. The service this time around was also spot on. The older woman working, not sure if she was one of the owners, but she was very funny and jovial and poured us an enormous amount of mimosas which were all on the stronger side and appreciated."

Came here for my birthday for a quiet dinner with my family and the bf/fiance (it&#39;s easier to write bf =P) and had a nice time! The waitress was super nice and there were regular patrons there who were equally nice. We were a party of 6 and 2 people (with entrees just brought to their table) were so nice and moved tables so we could sit down. So nice!!

We ordered one of the special appetizers, the artichoke and 2 of the entree specials: a lamb dish with pasta (*drooool i ate it so fast that I can&#39;t remember what was in it.. just that it was fantastic!) and a crab creamy pasta dish with sun dried tomatoes (too heavy and creamy for my taste). The bros and bf got chicken parm and a creamy pasta sauce with spinach pasta and chicken and one substituted with shrimp. I think the chicken parm was only ok for one bro, but everyone else enjoyed their dinners. We also got the garlic bread and that was yummy. For dessert, I knew there was a birthday cake waiting at home, but I had to try the homemade tiramisu and it was NOT a mistake! It was delicious and both parents got their regular coffee and enjoyed it.

Overall a great dinner, I don&#39;t know the total cost as it was kept from me, but the dishes are all very reasonable. The entree specials were $17.95 each (I believe all specials are that price) which was a bit much, but I thought my dish was worth it because it was so good. That price for the crab dish was not so great because there weren&#39;t lumps of crap, it was more that it was sprinkled and mixed throughout with sun dried tomatoes and the pasta was thicker like gnocci with rich creamy sauce - my mom enjoyed it though.

Would definitely come back here for like a date night :)

Even the flavor of the food was not up to par.  Pretty pedestrian.  A new chef, perhaps?  It was a Tuesday night in case the owner reads this and was wondering who was on.

Finally, the prices seemed higher than I had recalled.  Appetizer (bruschetta) and entree (eggplant parm) for me, salad and entree (penne vodka with chicken) for my girlfriend and we each had one glass of chianti.  The bill was almost $80.

Well our final bill for just two entrees came out to a little under $50, a tad overpriced given all other menu items were under $15. We might have been naive in not asking prices for the specials, make sure you do!"

I&#39;m sorry to say that I will not be returning. My fianc√© ordered one of the specials on the menu, pork chop. Notice I write pork chop cause there was only one. Nothing special, in fact half way to the center he had to send it back as it was undercooked. Okay that happens. But the broccoli rabe that was underneath had no flavor it was just steamed. For $24.99, this was clearly nothing to write home about. I had a risotto and shrimp dish that was just okay. A mound of risotto with 4 average shrimp placed around it. I love to give my business to local restaurants but this was an expensive dinner for two that left us very unsatisfied."

Never been a fan of red sauce joints, but was intrigued by their dirt cheap lunch special, which is two courses for $11.95.  Started out with two meatballs, with tomato sauce and ricotta, then followed it with an eggplant parm sandwich, which came with a salad.  I&#39;ll be honest:  it&#39;s a great deal.  I got more than my dollar&#39;s worth.  The restaurant and service is old school Brooklyn neighborhood in style, and probably a good place to take your kids.  No drinks were offered,so I drank tap water through the meal.  The woman serving the tables did ask if I wanted coffee or dessert, but by that point I was full.  Totally for people who want massive portions of cheaply prepared food. I&#39;m sure this place has tons of fans."

I also love somewhat bossy italian women who are all business when the place is packed. Had a great arugula salad with shaved parmesan, the outstanding pumpkin gnocchi special in sage butter with mascarpone, and a dry white that was on special. My friend had the scallop linguini special and loved it too. They turn tables over pretty quickly without rushing anyone.

After spending 20 minutes on seamless figuring out what to eat, going back and fourth looking at yelp &amp; the reviews, seamless said they weren&#39;t in our zone. I called the restaurant and literally begged the lady to please deliver to use, considering it is only two blocks! She finally agreed. 

We ordered the mozzarella with roasted peppers, which was delicious, the meatballs were ok....

My husband ordered the chicken parm with pasta, only one piece of chicken...which is weird considering when we order from la villa or get food for Vinnys we always get a huge portion. 

I ordered the hanger steak with garlic mash potatoes since the reviews were so great. The mash was good, very creamy, the steak was extremely chewy, and nothing to race about, it needed more flavor. 

Delivery time was very fast! About 25 minutes, kudos to them for that, and the great customer service to have the delivery person come two extra blocks...the seven dollar tip made up for going out of the delivery zone."

We walked into a small, cozy, loud with old Italian music playing atmosphere. We were greeted by Janet who was the waitress/hostess and told that we had a 10 minute wait, which it was exactly 10 minutes. 
We sat and were immediately given menus and waters. Janet came and took our drink order and told us the specials that they had for the night. We got the artichoke special and the burrata with zucchini &amp; a light basil pesto sauce. The artichoke was the best artichoke I ever ate in my life, it was so flavorful and the you could actually eat the leaf. 
For my entree I ordered the spinach tagliatelle with chicken and mushrooms, it was suppose to come in a creamy Parmesan sauce, but I asked for it in garlic and oil. It was delicious. The other people I was with LOVED their entrees. The food is delicious.
For dessert aw ordered an affogato, house made Italian cheese cake, and a house made almond cake. The Italian cheese cake was outrageous. 
Everything was great, their was not one thing I could say we ate that wasn&#39;t good. The staff, atmosphere, and service was incredible. The prices were also extremely reasonable. This will definitely become a regular place for me."

I was there with my family and we all felt a bit rushed through eating ...what I mean is that there was no one else waiting to be seated. It was at capacity but no one was told to come back or that there was a delay for seating. What shocked me was the bill for a family of four.

Drinks were a little watered down as expected but the waiters were eager to refill your glass. I had poached eggs for the first time with smoked salmon and it had this creamy hollandaise sauce.

Reserved a table for Mother&#39;s Day Brunch and with 2 Course prefixed menu for $26 a person, bland was the word.

Mom had the fritters and it was too doughy and undercooked. The Spinach salad with blue cheese and pears was good but how can one screw that up. The other appetizer was mozzarella with roasted peppers which was tough and rubbery. Missing any taste, olive oil or even a nice balsamic vinegar may have helped this dish limp along. 

Main course: three eggs with home fries which was very plain. I had the rigatoni with 4 cheeses which was just a step above Kraft macaroni and cheese. The baked ziti with sausage had a slap of basic cheese of some sort melted on top with little meat. Needless to say...more than half of each dish was left back. 

The absolute kicker was that when the cards were charged, they wrote in the tip. No where when I made the reservations did they say that gratuity was automatic - nor was it stated on the menu. 

Maybe on a regular Sunday,  brunch would be average at best...but if you are a real foodie, this will be a huge disappointment. Won&#39;t be back to give them a second try."

The special salad was nice. A bit of care would be nice (the end of the Avocado was in my plate)

But what makes or breaks a restaurant experience is sometimes not the food but the service.  The energetic and kind woman who took care of us -- let her name be recorded in capitals -- JANET -- acted as if our pleasure, in the smallest detail, was very important to her.

I have never been treated so rudely. My husband and his elderly father drove over (bc he can&#39;t walk far) while I walked over with my daughter. When my husband arrived, the restaurant had one table full and was told that they needed to wait for us. Not a huge deal, but it was apparent that my father in law needed assistance, and an exception could have been made. When I walked in, they immediately told me to take the stroller outside, but before we had a table and before she had a place to sit. The whole ordeal was silly. To boot, we called ahead of time so they should have been on the lookout. 

Perhaps I&#39;m the most annoyed bc they had a major attitude, disappeared often we needed things and overall staff was not friendly. I would have changed restaurants in a heart beat had it not been for my FIL, and despite the fact their food is excellent, I&#39;m not too likely to come back. I&#39;m almost wondering if this attitude and poor service is why they charge all tables a mandatory 20% gratuity on brunch?"

First of all, we were a group of 7 and half of us were late but the staff was so courteous! I must mention JANET who took care of us and was a breath of fresh air. She made us feel so welcome and served all our needs with an ease and expertise that customers crave. 

The food was phenomenal. We chose form the lunch special and my friends and I tasted each other&#39;s plates so I got a taste of so many dishes. I must recommend the white bean and spinach soup, fried calamari, and the fresh mozerella with peppers for the first course. The second course I tried the penne ala vodka (for religious reasons I asked to hold the alcohol) and it was the creamiest, most flavorful cream sauce ever! My friends got the mushroom risotto (so smooth and rich) and spinach pesto(filling and bright). The others in our group got paninis which they enjoyed. But that leaves the last course: desserts! Their Italian cheesecake is simply divine. I&#39;ve had my fair share of cheesecakes and this surpassed all my previous experiences. It&#39;s made inhouse so it&#39;s fresh and they use ricotta cheese-you taste the richness of a cheesecake but are left with an airy texture of a mousse. Their almond cake was also good, and their chocolate cake satisfies any chocolate lovers taste buds. All in all- the food was spectacular. 

We were there for about two hours and in that time, there were so many people filling up the place (popular spot). But never once did they rush us or make us feel like we overstayed our visit. I cannot wait to visit again. We&#39;ve definitely found a new spot."

The day before we moved out of the neighborhood this past February, I went in to have our final meal be the same as our first. I had ordered over the phone to pick up. Giovanni happened to come out from the back as I was paying. I told him we were moving and he refused to let me pay. And this was not a small bill.

The food...
Order the meatball appetizer.  Its delicious.  It feels a little pricey at first for 3 meatballs (and a little annoying when you are sharing with your significant other), but it truly is some of the most delicious meatballs out there.

I&#39;m not a huge fan of their pasta dishes.  I think they need more flavor. 

However, their non-pasta dishes have yet to disappoint me.

Highlights:
Gamberi al limone: is one of my favorites.  If you are a fan of rissotto, shrimp, garlic and lemon...this dish will make you smile

Vitello Salti in bocca: this is the veal scalopini...the side of potatoes alone are worth the money, let alone the actual veal."

We also got a stuffed artichoke which was okay but would have been a little more zesty...it was a little bland.

For entrees, she had salmon and spinach which was out of this world.  Perfectly cooked and delicious.

I had a gnocchi special.  It had sweet sausage and eggplant.  It was good, but the eggplant was mushier than I would have liked...the sausage was great but there were only four tiny pieces of it.  For $15.99 I would have liked it a little meatier!

The service is great. The place is so small, they&#39;re on top of everything when you need it.

The sweet lady that served us on a weekday was fantastic. I would come back just to see her again. Apparently, there&#39;s a game every Tuesday where you draw a number 1 through 100 and if you guess correctly, you get a free dinner. Fun times.

But it can be very loud when placing an order over the phone, which I&#39;ve done a few times. I literally had to scream because the hostess could not hear me over the crowd in the restaurant. They could easily fix that by giving the hostess and earpiece or headset to receive calls on.

We started with an appetizer special of spinach and ricotta cheese stuffed mushrooms with a parmesan cream sauce. So mind blowing we order another straight after! The red wine (a bottle) that we ordered (a Riserva from Italy) was spectacular! BF had an entree special, which was breaded pork topped with onions, peppers, sausage, and potato - served with broccoli rabe. I tried the fusilli pasta with a tomato cream sauce and sweet and hot sausage crumble.  Although this dish was good, I found it to be a little to salty/overly seasoned for my taste. I wouldn&#39;t order it again, but I would ABSOLUTELY try one of their many other dishes they have on their menu.  We got a chance to meet Giovanni himself and he was pleasantly charming. BF mentioned that it was our first time their and that I had picked it for my birthday dinner.  He and his staff later put a candle into the tiramisu that I ordered (INSANELY GOOD!) and sang happy birthday to me.  I couldn&#39;t have been any happier!

So began our trek to 95th because why not? We were in need of calories and brunch. We are not the best of morning people befuddled by the drippity drop of rain today has left us in a groggy state. He muttered about coffee and lox. Walking two miles for the journey to The Coop might seem not too shabby, but today was not ordinary as our umbrellas clashed with each other and occasional wind pushed us against our will to walk. 

We walked past The Coop by accident and we backtraced a bit to remember it was on 95th and 4th. The best part was it was filled with little kids screaming and running around with their parents ordering upfront. There was a charity fundraiser on the side and seats were not so much available. Also I did see some paintings for sale for $30/ea. It was pretty cool to see, but indeed it was cramped.

So Jerry ordered upfront because I was stuck between the table and the wall-bench seating. Jerry wanted to play UNO with the toddlers and children, but I had to remind him he&#39;d look like a pedo. I kid you not this fully shaved previously bearded adult in a hipster suit attempting to play with kids that were not near their parents did not look pedo. Hmm. Sus if I didn&#39;t ward him off the area. 

Anyway food came quickly and even though they didn&#39;t have what we ordered because it was out of stock, substitutions were very nice. They let us know too and no extra charge. Anyway, I ordered a Greek Yogurt Parfait + Deviled Eggs Smash. It was presented beautifully. It won me over easily. As for Jerry, he ordered a bagel with Lox and cream cheese. It was nicely presented too.

For taste, my sandwich was toasted and the bread was nice and chewy. Crispy outside, chewy on the bread whites. The eggs were scrambled and even though I expected deviled eggs as in the halves, but this will do. It also came with diced tomatoes that were sweet. As for the Greek yogurt parfait with blackberries, they were tart. The jam in the mix was good because it negated the sour tangy blackberries to mildly sweet yogurt. It wasn&#39;t too bad, but they didn&#39;t have a spoon so I used my fork.

Jerry&#39;s lox bagel was nice. It had a nice toasted layer outside and a little down from most of his salmon being burnt. He didn&#39;t mind it so much. They had cucumber water also, but there is no hint of it. It&#39;s alright because it came free, but it didn&#39;t leave him full. He was going to order something else. His plate came with onions/tomatoes/olives/cucumber on the side for $10,  he liked my plate better for $6.50 and it was light, but more flavorful. 

We probably will come here again, but it is a bit out of our way to travel. Staff is friendly which is a plus for us."

I ordered the jalape√±o cornbread waffle, avocado smash toast, cheddar biscuit and two lattes!

The waffle was my favorite thing! Honestly it&#39;s a waffle shaped cornbread with jalape√±o inside - ie absolutely tasty if you like cornbread with a little hint of spicy (so very little).

The avocado smash toast was really delicious, ripe, and fresh. 

The cheese biscuit thing was just okay - I think it got cold quickly since it was a little stale.

Lattes were great as well.

Price point is on the higher end.

My friend and I, who visit the coop with our 5 month old infants on a regular basis, were sitting, catching up, and feeding our babies. This is totally normal, as this is the coop and they welcome moms to feed their babies anytime, and however they choose.

An old, sour faced couple two tables over felt the need to complain and raise a stink about the fact that we were feeding our children and thought that we should have the &#34;decency to cover ourselves&#34;. It is the first time that i&#39;ve ever had anyone do that, i&#39;m sure it wont be the last, but they picked the wrong coop to pick on the chickens.

The amazing staff, Ryan in particular, shut them down RIGHT quick. They don&#39;t allow for shaming of any kind in the coop. It is the most mom-friendly place in Bay Ridge and they intend to keep it that way.

The Coop has a little playroom (indoor and outdoor) all the way towards the back, and tables by the front for ones who needs some quiet time.

I had the lox platter, love the fact that all the veggies: olives, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and diced onions were nicely plated around the bagel w cream cheese and thinly sliced smoked salmon.

My bf had the rancheros which he said was okay, sis and son both enjoyed their dishes. Sis had the burrito w yukon potato and eggs. My son had the croissant sandwich with eggs, cheddar and vegetables. He finished it all!

I liked their pumpkin spice latte, very nicely made and didnt need additional sugar/syrup. Sis had the viet coffee and bf had the draft latte and they both enjoyed their drinks. It was upgraded to larger size becos we waited awhile! Really appreciated that!

During my neighborhood stroll, I pulled out my CUPS app to look for an unique mom and pop type of coffee shop to try. This is how I found the Coop! La Colombe coffee is served here, which is a major plus! 

Upon arrival, this place was lively even at 9:00 am on a Sunday. Since this place is self-serve; find a free table, order with the cashier at the counter, and pick up your food when it&#39;s ready. For those who know me would&#39;ve probably guessed that I went straight for the Vietnamese Cold Brew and Avocado Smash Toast with Smoked Salmon. Yup, that&#39;s what I got (LOL)! 

Vietnamese Cold Brew. I love this! Condensed milk is such a magical item. No need to leave room for milk or add any sugar. Just make sure you shake or stir the condensed milk until it mixes in with the coffee. Refreshing! 

Avocado Smash Toast with Smoked Salmon. Their take on the avocado toast is probably the most colorful I have seen! A sour rye toast with smashed avocado spread topped with baby sprouts, chopped tomatoes, chopped onions, and red pepper flakes. Super tasty, healthy, and picture worthy. So good!

Per the recommendation of my friend, I got the avocado smash with a fried egg on top which was only ~$8! I couldn&#39;t believe how tasty and filling of a meal I was getting for under 10 bucks; seriously the avocado toast here is even better than the ones I&#39;ve had at raved-about brunch places in Manhattan. There is a lot of avocado smeared on the bread, and it tastes more authentic because it isn&#39;t mixed with other seasonings. My friends got grilled cheese sandwiches, which weren&#39;t that big at all but seemed good as well.

The space is large with plenty of seating. It&#39;s decorated with rustic hardwood for an organic/natural feel. The staff are friendly, energetic, and excited about the new business. They are open to suggestions from locals to make sure the community has input in the place. 

Coffee: only decaf is espresso, but i was pleased with my decaf iced almond milk latte. The hot latte was smooth, though the soy milk made it a little too sweet for my liking. And only in Bay Ridge... Cold coffee on tap, brewed using nitrous oxide for an airy, smooth, and light taste. They offer black, latte (milk, unsweetened) or &#34;black and tan,&#34; which is my preference as it is a darker, richer flavor. Ask for a free sample. 

Food: there is a beautiful pasty display and adorable &#34;Madeline&#34; bears. If you want something more substantial, try a toast topped with avocado or eggs. Lighter? Grab a piece of fruit. I hope they offer gluten-free bread and dessert options soon; I&#39;m looking forward to trying the toasts if they do."

I had the Shashuka, eggs poached in a spicy tomato stew, and it was just about perfect.   Looking forward to coming back and trying the Huevos  Rancheros. 

The staff is really friendly. There was a steady stream of people coming in to get their morning caffeine, always a good sign. They have a play area at the back, which I think is great, so it&#39;s a friendly place for everyone.  Oh, and while there is music playing it&#39;s not BLASTING, so wonderful.  Finally, someplace I can have breakfast or just coffee and read or write or think. 

Welcome to the neighborhood!"

Came here on a Sunday, Father&#39;s Day to be exact and was surprised by this little gem on the deeper side of bay ridge! Cute interior with a play area for kids in the back. They serve La Columbe and also a short-but-sweet menu for brunch/lunch. I ordered the Avocado Toast and my friend ordered the Kale Salad. I also ordered a Black and Tan which is basically half cold brew on-tap and half latte-on-tap. Delicious! Service was awesome and not only that, they have board games in the back for you to play with! We snatched Connect Four and Chutes and Ladders and it occupied our adult brains for a couple of hours. Def will be back sometime soon for more great food, great service and fun times!"

They also had really high-end brand drip coffee.  The customer service was excellent. Staff was very accommodating very informative and friendly. Ryan was very helpful in helping us choose our meal being that this was our first visit.

However, sadly the service was strange and the layout of the cafe was dang annoying. You have so many people going back and forth on the line and crazy children running around in the back with the little fenced area. The chairs opposite the benches were most annoying because you&#39;d have people bumping into you while eating. We came in looking for a menu - it&#39;s not on the wall - it&#39;s not on the counter next to the cashier... Where are all the menus?!?!?! We asked the staff and they didn&#39;t know I had to ask a 3 other people and they ignored me. One guy said he would get me one but he went to the back after like 10 minutes he comes find me...but I already took one from the other table. It turns out that guy went to print out more copies. Whaaatt!! Lol .. line got so long and we were getting impatient. Finally ordered food .. sat down... And then waited another 30+ min wait. Omg we were all starving. We got one dish and the other dishes didn&#39;t come until later. Got the food and it was only ok. Ugh. We were more annoyed that it took so long. Really they should do numbers to call out instead of names. Easier and clearer that way."

Everything was hot which gets brownie points from me. I hate cold food. The waiter came and asked us if we needed anything. The service was great. Will definitely be going back again. My daughter enjoyed the play area but it was a lot of kids and I was afraid my daughter would hit someone and vice versa. Other than that I was very happy with visit.

What I think they could do better is with the portion size. I&#39;m not a huge guy but I killed the huevos rancheros ($12) in 5 minutes. Supposedly it&#39;s one of their biggest dishes but it&#39;s really just two tacos. Would have been better had it been 3-4.

The ventilation isn&#39;t that good and there wasn&#39;t much airflow anywhere so you kind of smelled like food after your meal. That&#39;s also one of the areas they could improve in.

Would def come back again if they improve on those two areas."

But equally as important as good coffee, they have a great space for kids to play AND it&#39;s fenced in so mama&#39;s don&#39;t have to worry about their little ones running all over the place. They also keep all the toys very clean. Bonus.

The ambiance is very nice and casual and is a good hangout spot. All of the food is made fresh and 90% is organic. I usually get the bagel with egg and cheese, roasted potatoes, and a small OJ. The OJ, straight form the juicer, rivaling even the likes of Pegasus. The cheese in the bagel is not some individual wrapped dairy, but aged, from a block, cheddar. Finally, the roasted potatoes just defy expectations and... you just have to order and see to describe it. However, there are 2 FLAWS that could SERIOUSLY bring this business down. Hope you guys listen. One, the coffee is COLD, or at least not as warm as it should be. Second, the prices are a bit too expensive, but I can live with that, In conclusion, I wish the cafe a best of luck and cheers on their fresh start."

The food was great except for the shashuka where the eggs were floating around raw. 

I was really upset for having to actually place your own order at the register, then you actually have to clean your own and put clean away your plates after your done.  So why exactly did I have to put in a tip when I paid for my food.

Do NOT TIP-  gratuity should be given for work that&#39;s done for you.  Not because they&#39;re cooking your food which is their profession to begin with."

Yes, it seriously is $6!!! It is such a steal compared to prices from other places in the city/williamsburg. Avocado is smeared on a big yet thin slice of bread and is topped with tomatoes, onion &amp; alfalfa (?). I added an egg ($1.25) since it wasn&#39;t that expensive to begin with and it was so tasty! I also got an iced jasmine green tea ($2.25 ish - dont count me on that). The workers are all really sweet, friendly and smiley. I overheard the convo with the table next to me and one of the workers apologized for the delay service due to bad timing and offered them a pasty on the house. Thus, service here is 10/10!!! The coop also serves la columbe coffee if you like that and offer the draft latte, pure black and tan and pure black as well. Another cool thing is that theres a little playground for children in the back hence the name &#34;the coop.&#34; Only reason a star was knocked off was because it was a bit smokey in the cafe (not much ventilation) and the smell stuck a bit in my hair but everything else is solid!!"

The salad has the best dressing EVER! It&#39;s like watery honey mustard salad dressing--very sweet. Yum. The dish also comes with warm rye bread with melted butter on top which was ok. The price was not terrible being at $9. But the price of the French toast was not worth it at $7. They toast two slices of regular sized bread with egg and with some syrup on top they call that French toast. C&#39;mon now. My hubby who ate that was still hungry afterwards. It wouldn&#39;t hurt to give two more slices of bread.

I live nearby and have been a number of times with my daughter. She LOVES this place - chocolate milk, baked goods, and a play area?? Score! I *want* to love this place. So badly! Better than average food and coffee and now also beer and wine! All of that AND a play area to occupy my daughter?? Seems like a recipe for a really perfect family place. Alas... it&#39;s just not. 

I forgive them the really trashed bathroom - that&#39;s to be expected with so many young kids. I also forgive the poor railroad style layout because although they could&#39;ve foreseen the clogs that develop from families trying to all have prime seating to keep an eye on the play area in the back, you work with what you got. And the play space is super cute and creative! I love that there&#39;s outside space. 

But the service. Oy. The service is just atrocious. I gave a lot of leeway when they first opened because hiccups are to be expected. But we&#39;re passed that now. And literally *every* time I place an order, it takes an extraordinarily long time to receive it. In fact, I usually have to go back to the counter and remind them of it. And it&#39;s not just when I&#39;m ordering their avocado toast. Even ordering a simple coffee or one of their croissants or cheddar biscuits seems like an overwhelming task for the staff. Yesterday, there were four people working behind the counter and two tables of people in the actual restaurant (mine included)... and I STILL had to get back up and ask after waiting for 20 minutes for my warmed cheddar biscuit. It was the only food we&#39;d ordered. They had forgotten about it. So they said they&#39;d get it right out. I got it about 10 minutes later, and it was partially cold. My mom ordered us two glasses of wine, and they gave her one glass. She reminded them she&#39;d ordered two (she placed the order less than a minute earlier), and the staff couldn&#39;t seem to find a second glass for the wine despite their having shelves literally packed with empty wine glasses. What is that about?? I just don&#39;t understand. 

If it were up to my daughter, this place would get 5 stars. But unfortunately for her, it&#39;s my money that I&#39;m spending, and I really can&#39;t justify becoming regular patrons. It&#39;s such a bummer to see the promise in this place and yet consistently be disappointed. The Coop will last mostly because it serves a very needed function for young families - especially in this part of the neighborhood. But that&#39;s about it."

Avocado toast will never go out of style in my eyes and neither will this breakfast spot. Simple yet delicious menu for bfast, and a huge selection of pastries on the side. I got the field of greens and my bf got the avocado toast. We tried samples of the lattes and I really enjoyed one of them; cant wait to come back and order it to get the full experience!!! My plate I could have made at home, now the flavor made it amazing. They put something special on it...all i know is that it was totally making me drool all over my dish. They did in fact forget to put avocado on my dish so we told them and they peeped over, and offered us a free pastry in return for mixing up my order. That was great customer service skillzzz. My partners dish was awesome. Probably the best avo toast ive evaaaa had. We couldnt stay in there too long bc it was almost a sauna, thats the only bad thing we disliked. There was also a little kiddy section for the babies which was a thoughtful addition for the cute bay ridge hipster babies. So we finished up our first meal of the day, paid the bill and the guy offered us 2 free pastries!!! He also told us if we are by the place around 7/8 pm he always walks out with bags of pastries which hell give to us free! The next morning we enjoyed our cinnamon sugar donut and waffle!

Service was great and our food was good.  The play area for kids was a real boon to any adult wanting to enjoy a quiet cup of coffee.  Liking the place I returned with a friend on Tuesday morning June 21st.  The weekday service is certainly different.  First off the woman behind the counter was not friendly. I ordered an iced coffee and was told there was only enough for a half cup. This  at 11:00 AM on an 80+ degree day.  My friend and I then ordered hot coffee only to find the milk was spoiled. The woman behind the counter, after seeing the curdled milk, argued that the container was good until the 24th and that she had just put it out.  With that, she began removing the clumps of spoiled milk from the coffee with the intention of giving the remainder back to my friend; she had to be asked to provide a new cup of coffee with fresh milk.  When I asked about an entree she nodded toward the cook and said - &#34;it&#39;s what he&#39;s explaining to her.&#34;  All this was done with an air of irritation and boredom.   The Coop could be a great place, something new for Bay Ridge; but service like this can ruin a business."

The falafels were not warm or crispy on the outside so that was disappointing because the flavor was on point. The chicken kebabs were very flavorful and juicy (right off the grill) so they were more appealing and tasty. The sides were all meh - nothing to rave about but not bad either. 

Overall if I&#39;m in the area again and need a quick bite, I would stop in!"

The problem with FiDi is there are number of good, basic 3-star options for all the people who work down here during the day, and a ton of crappy 1- and 2-star places, but very little 4-star and basically no 5-star places down here.

I really think Roti is a 3.5-star place, but as there are so few good quality places in FiDi, I&#39;m inclined to round up.  I give Roti a 4-star rating, mainly comparing it to other spots in FiDi.  If I compare it to a place like Omar&#39;s Kitchen in Midtown East or Papa Kebab in Chelsea, there&#39;s basically no comparison and Omar&#39;s &amp; Papa Kebab blows Roti out of the water.  But for being only a few blocks from my work and being fast and cheap, it&#39;s pretty good.

I usually get the Roti Rice Plate with the Roti Chicken (Shawarma basically) with tahini sauce or dill/yogurt/cucumber sauce, Hummus, Red Cabbage Slaw, Tomato &amp; Cucumber, Feta Cheese on top and a pita.  All of this for like $9...and it&#39;s healthy.  I tell my co-workers all the time: &#34;it almost tastes too good to be healthy&#34;.  It&#39;s very good. 

So if you&#39;re looking for something good, healthy and cheap, this is the perfect spot.  I have no clue what it would be like at night or on weekends, but as there&#39;s very little traffic (mainly tourists) and as it&#39;s dead in FiDi at those times, I&#39;d proceed with caution.  During the week, you&#39;re good to go!"

It strikes the right balance between fast casual and healthy-enough food to fill you up but not so much that you&#39;re in a food coma the rest of the afternoon. I ordered online via their website and walked over to pick it up. Turns out this was an unnecessary step because they just made the plate (which honestly took 30 seconds) on the spot when I got there. Might be a good precaution for peak lunch time hours though. 

I got the &#34;Best Plate Ever&#34;-chicken roti with garlic sauce, rice, assorted vegetables, hummus, and a pita. I really liked the chicken roti-it was extremely flavorful but not overwhelming and was definitely the highlight of the dish. The hummus was good quality but I thought the pita was soft/closer to true pita than most places offer. The other items didn&#39;t really stand out but overall it was a nice-sized platter that satisfied me."

Your order is customized; you choose between a plate, sandwich or salad and pick your own protein, three sides, one topping, and one sauce. 

We came during the lunch rush, which was too fast paced for a first timer. I couldn&#39;t even see the menu anywhere until I was next in line, which made me panic as there were SO many people behind us and no time to read how it worked and the menu options. I had to step aside and let people pass, so I could figure out my order.

They definitely need another menu that&#39;s more in plain sight and further back in the line when you enter. Since by the time I read the menu, my fiance was already through the line and ready to pay, so I decided not to order from here. I went to Sam&#39;s Falafel, and we took our food back to our co-working space and shared our dishes.

Takeways: The portions are definitely on the small size for the price, but the plate was very tasty, especially the couscous. 

If you&#39;ve been before, then this is a decent quick lunch, albeit a bit pricey. However, don&#39;t come in the lunch rush if you&#39;ve never been before. 

Also, their pricing is stingy! There&#39;s small portions and you can only get one sauce included. They charge extra for everything here. Most counter service places like Chipotle or taquerias, don&#39;t charge extra for sauces. I really didn&#39;t care for that aspect. I&#39;m a big fan of sauces and I don&#39;t want to be nickel and dimed just for drizzling some sauces on top.

It&#39;s a toss up between a 2 and 3 stars for me, but the food actually did taste good, so they&#39;ll get the 3 from me."

It&#39;s ironic how Roti is open up the block from Chipotle and serve the same way (choose salad, rice plate, or sandwich--choose protein--choose sides).

Chicken Roti Rice Plate $8.45 (+tax = $9.20) - I love the chicken Roti here. The chicken was flavorful and had just the right amount of spices. Vegetables &amp; pita tasted fresh. My plate consisted of brown rice, chicken Roti, tahini sauce, hummus, tomatoes and cucumber, red cabbage slaw, and pita bread. Portions are very generous. 

Roti can get packed during weekdays at lunch. If you see a line that extends to the entrance doors, expect to wait 10-15 minutes before you get to the register. There are small tables in the restaurant, making it hard to accommodate a party larger than 4. 

If you&#39;re looking for something new with variety, you should definitely give it a try."

The chicken Kebob was a bit dry. The veggies were meh but the hummus was decent. And the price was under $10! (With no drink..) 

Here&#39;s the thing : the workers don&#39;t know what they are serving. I asked if the rice was pilaf or more curry etc and they looked at me like &#34;white or dark rice&#34;. I asked again and they looked at each other like I was nuts. The type of rice is an important thing to know when serving Mediterranean food!

The product is decent. Quick lunch of the same vein as Chipotle, Dos Toros, etc. However, there are inexcusable demand management issues at this location. First, there have been numerous times that I&#39;ve had to shout, quite literally, over the counter for the person to hear/understand the ingredient I want. This place is no busier than Chipotle, etc, and this problem exists nowhere else. I shouldn&#39;t have to shout &#39;Mixed Greens&#39; at you 5 times only to have you put something completely different on. Second, you should always ask for the receipt, and look over the charge to make sure you were not overcharged for a component of your dish incorrectly. This has happened to me numerous times, and is inexcusable. Third (and the real kicker in all of this), is their inability to carry even their most basic ingredients during peak lunch hours. At a place where rice plates are indisputably their most popular dish, it is outrageous that on numerous occasions, have had no rice prepared, often for over 20 minutes. Rice is the lifeblood of this restaurant&#39;s cuisine, and this lack of preparation is, again, inexcusable...but also incredibly audacious, given that you can hock a loogie and hit 5 other comparable restaurants in the area. 
I want to clearly state that the product (when you get what you order, at the right price, with the right ingredients) is very tasty (and would likely have warranted a 3-4 star review), but the above behavior in unacceptable and deserves to be called out. I won&#39;t be returning."

It&#39;s a Mediterranean/Indian chipotle- fast casual, quasi healthy, pick what you want style eatery. I ordered the steak rice plate with an extra roti chicken. For sauce: tahini and spicy.

Been here only for lunch; not sure if this would be considered a dinner place. Tried the chicken platters and salmon platters as well. They were both good but definitely not traditional Mediterranean flavors.

The side orders are pretty good I enjoy the rice and olives. The veggies is a good option too. I do not like the eggplant though few like it&#39;s lacking in flavor. Overall good lunch spot; try to come early because by 12:30 line is out the door."

I&#39;ve had a 10% off coupon with my debit card for Roti so I&#39;ve eaten here like... four days in a row, and with that clarity (and more energy as compared to my usual carby lunches at Yip&#39;s or Underground Pizza) I can tell you that every day is a good, but mixed bag. 

Some days, they give you a ton of salad, little meat, and tons of toppings. Other days, all meat, some salad, ton of sauce, few toppings. Really the combinations of more/less are endless and unpredictable. That&#39;s probably because the only people who I&#39;ve seen consistently are the guy at the beginning who makes the plates, and the cashier ... both of whom are great but look careworn. 

Other issue, when it gets reeeally busy, they haven&#39;t got it figured it all out. One afternoon, the steak that was spinning on the kebab wheel got ordered so much it was down to the totally rare middle. Not a little pink, but legitimately bloody and squishy status. Afraid to eat territory. Other note, the eggplant is totally flavorless. Overall, this is really my favorite &#34;healthy&#34; (but probably not healthy at all and potentially a salt mine) lunch choice in lower Manhattan."

SERVICE: Quick
VENUE: Spacious with limited seats (around lunchtime at least)
FOOD: Very tasty with generous servings - and under $10
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The entrance is actually on Cedar St and Pearl St.

VERDICT: Yummy! Yes, this is a good spot to go to!

---------Experience/Venue/Service
My friend got here around 1:30pm on a Wednesday and was lucky to get us a table. While the place itself is spacious, there&#39;re limited seats: only about 20 people can sit comfortably with a table (2 - 4 people per table) while 4 additional patrons can sit on the counter. However, around 1:45 - 2:15pm, the place cleared out; you had your choice of seats. And then boom, just as quickly, it filled up once again. 

---------Food:
- Rice Plate with Chicken Roti, Roasted Red Pepper sauce and Tomato &amp; Cucumber: Chicken was tender and juicy; the &#34;medium&#34; roaster red pepper sauce was not even &#34;mild&#34;; Tomato &amp; Cucumber were pretty fresh and so good.
- Rice Plate with Chicken Kabob with Tahini sauce: The Chicken Kabob was a bit dry. I prefer the Chicken Roti. The sauce was slightly sweet and enhanced the meat."

Most other places are very heavy on meat and bread. Sandwiches are very common. Meat over rice is very common. Not enough places serve cooked vegetables.

Simple concept- pick an item ( laffa wraps which are basically Mediterranean burritos, pita bread, rice, or salad), pick a protein (they have 2 types of chicken, steak, salmon, falafel or just vegetables) and then choose a sauce and/or sides and toppings. 

I had the chicken kebab which is made with chicken breast and really tasty. It was cooked nicely and  I would definitely order it again. The garlic sauce was good although I didn&#39;t taste a lot of garlic flavor. It was still a nice addition to the chicken. I loved their hummus- not only did it have great flavor but the texture was also perfect. I have had a lot of weird hummus from places (you would think it would be a simple thing but apparently not) but the hummus here was delicious. I liked the eggplant side although I think the tomato flavor overpowered the eggplant a bit and it was a little too mushy. Finally, I tried the red cabbage slaw which was pretty good but not as great as the other stuff I tried. I was not a fan of the rice because I found the cardamom flavor to be overpowering but enjoyed everything else. 

Prices are comparable to most of their competition in the area and they give you a pretty decent amount of food- I was super full and didn&#39;t even finish everything. I definitely am a fan and hope they open more locations (right now they only have 2 in New York plus a few in Illinois and the Washington DC area)."

Yes, I know: first world problems to the extreme. This place is surprisingly pretty good, though. I guess if one&#39;s expectations are low to begin with, though, then it&#39;s not too hard to be pleased.

With that being said, this place is still pretty darn good. I came here for lunch the other week and I had their Mediterranean plate with falafel. I can&#39;t remember all of the sides that I had gotten, but I remember being very, very pleased with my meal. The falafels themselves were pretty good. I don&#39;t recall seeing any roti breads, though. I got a pita with my meal, instead.

At the particular time I had come, also (around 1:15 PM on a weekday), it wasn&#39;t too crowded, so I was able to actually sit down and enjoy my meal, instead of scarfing my food down like a savage.

Disclosure: I&#39;m not a humongous fan of Mediterranean food, but my boyfriend is, so I eat it pretty regularly. The reason I usually don&#39;t enjoy it as much is because most dishes are inundated with such strong flavors that are too overwhelming for my palate. 

This is why I appreciate Roti. Here, you&#39;re in control of which flavors (sauces, vegetables, or other sides) get mixed into your sandwich, rice plate, or salad. For once, I enjoyed a Mediterranean dish not drowned in tzatziki sauce and strong garlic or onion flavors. I chose chicken with a roasted red pepper sauce on a rice plate with mild vegetables; I asked for some hummus on the side to enjoy with my complimentary pita. Simple and fresh! I only wish the plate came with more rice.

Roti is a good place for others who are apprehensive about Mediterranean food and those looking for an affordable and healthy lunch."

Reason for this review is because of an unusual, yet exceptional experience from the store manager. Got off work early, came in around 3:30pm pm on (6//12/15). Not much customers, since lunch time is over and it was a Friday. 

I normally get the salmon plate for lunch and today there were none out on the counter. The manager said I had to wait 5 minutes for them to make it. I was totally cool with it, stood aside, and waited while on my phone. The manager comes over and apologizes for the wait, and wanted to inform me that Roti care about the quality of food, and wanted to ensure freshness, not leaving it hanging out all the time. I replied, yeah no problem, don&#39;t mind waiting. He then indicated that some customers have complained about the wait and wanted to ensure that I&#39;m not irritated. He then offered me a free foundation drink while I wait. 

I walked out with my plate of food, went home, and ate it. While eating it, I was thinking to myself, this salmon is pretty good! Perfectly cooked. Normally the salmons are a bit overcooked for my taste. But the manager really did do a good job cooking it for me. 

Therefore, BRAVO to the store manager and thanks for a perfectly cooked smooth salmon. Well deserved 5 star review because of the exceptional service.

Aside from the service I had today, food is pretty standard, and great for a healthy alternative to a salad. Not somewhere I&#39;ll recommend someone to definitely try but good enough for me to come back at least once a week or other week. BUT If you like hummus, this is definitely a place to take a pita bread and dip! I like the garlic sauce also."

They have the same set up as Chipotle&#39;s, but personally I like this place better because of their choices of fresh veggie sides. But Chipotle&#39;s has guacamole...hmmm...it&#39;s a tough call come to think of it. ;)

So, I ordered the rice plate of chicken roti with roasted red pepper sauce (medium spicy, ie not very spicy at all but with a slight kick to it) and the following sides/topping: couscous, fresh veggies, tomatoes and cucumber and olives. The meal comes with house-made pita and totals to $9.20 with tax. Overall, a very filling meal and a good balance btw meat and veggies. The chicken roti was a bit on the dry end, but the sauce helped a lot, making it more flavorful as well. The veggies were fresh and not too salty on the olives, which I loved. 

I will definitely be coming back here to try the hummus, eggplant and falafels next  time, maybe in a couple of days. 

PS: If you download their Roti Rewards app, you get a free side order of falafels or hummus after first purchase. And if you know you are going to be regular here, might as well pile up those points and get yourself some freebies. But remember to save your receipts, because you would have to upload those images to the app in order to get the points.

It&#39;s the same Roti I&#39;ve grown to love during my travels to DC, but they&#39;ve made some menu changes (additions) for the NYC location that makes it rock even more! 

Roti is not your typical Mediterranean fast food... it&#39;s a little more classy (think of Chipotle as opposed to Taco Bell). And, just about everything they have is bursting with flavor. My favorite thing on the menu is the Roti sandwich (I get the Laffa wrap and not the pita b/c it&#39;s bigger and I like to eat a lot). I typically get chicken on mine but the Roti chicken (dark meat) and not the Kebob chicken (white meat). It&#39;s super tender and melts in your mouth.

I like the veggies  (this is new for the NYC store), hummus, cucumber sauce and hot sauce, cous-cous, tomato &amp; cucumber salad, olive mix, and feta cheese!

It kind of felt like being in a cafeteria at a public school. I know it may sound bougie, but when your paying 11 bucks for a salad, wouldn&#39;t you expect a salad that&#39;s assembled somewhat decently?

The salad plate itself was okay. The eggplant tasted alright but it was a little too cold for me. The falafel was warm and decent. I&#39;m debating on coming back and trying the  rice plate or sandwich."

Consider it the more corporate and trendy version of the chain Hummus and Pita Co. The plates here are fairly plentiful but a bit overpriced. Seating isn&#39;t the best but if you wait 5 minutes max you&#39;ll be able to snag at least something by the window. The line can appear daunting but it moves fairly fast during the mid-day rush. Another well oiled machine to add to the list of solid afternoon eateries downtown.

Although I am not the biggest fan of Mediterranean food I decided to go one day to check out what all the fuss was about. I got a platter with the chicken and I can&#39;t say I felt too strongly about it. Everything on the platter was fine, but the meat was a little dry and the salad unimpressive. It wasn&#39;t the worst lunch option by any means, but I am baffled as to why people wait in such a long line for this food. 

My advice? Go to Pita Press down the street on Cedar. It&#39;s not the &#34;chipotle for Mediterranean food&#34; experience, but they have a nice selection of pitas, salads, and pastries that, in my opinion, taste much better."

The quality is still magnificent but the portions are not. I think it has alot to do with the young staff that is dishing out the portions they seem very unsure of themselves behind the counter like if the boss was going to kick them if they give to much.

The Falafals here are probably the best thing on the menu  - albeit a bit different than what you&#39;ll find elsewhere. They are big and soft, not too crispy. I also tend to get the chicken roti which I wish was a bit more spicy. The hot sauce usually does the trick to make it more flavorful. The sides offered are all pretty good. My favorites are the eggplant, the mixed veggies and the hummus. The pita bread is just ok - nothing to write home about. 

My one complaint is that the sides are all cold (intentionally). By the time you start eating (especially if you walk back to the office), the chicken/falafal is already room temp and the sides have warmed up to room temp. This is particularly more noticeable if you get the wrap. I wish everything was served hot - but it is what it is. overall the food is tasty enough to look past it. Also, sometimes the portion of protein given is pretty small.

Prices are not outrageous, but not cheap either - entrees will run between $8-$9. They prices also seem sorta arbitrary. I don&#39;t understand why a bed of lettuce costs more than a wrap or rice...I guess people are willing to pay more for salad. They do have an iphone app where you can accumulate points for each meal you buy - and eventually get a free meal. It seems with this program every 10th visit will be a free entree.   At the end of the day, its hard for this restaurant to stand out amongst the plethora of fast casual &#34;assembly line&#34; type places on the same block."

I thought Roti was one of the places that accepted our meal plan cards - I was mistaken. But I was in desperate need of falafel so I decided to try it out. 
The idea of ordering food here is pretty basic - one might say...&#34;subway&#34; style. I got falafel rice bowl with the 3 free toppings, a sauce, and hummus. (Oh, and the pita) 
Straight from here I can say that it was going to be a lukewarm meal...neither the rice or falafel were hot, or even warm... That kind of broke the deal for me here. Although the flavors and options are nice, I probably won&#39;t be returning here again. (Had it been on my meal plan it would be a different story, but you know, free food always tastes better)
Also, another issue was seating. I got here at 2 pm and all the tables were taken, so I had to sit next to the drinks station. Though in 15 minutes it cleared up significantly.

You go in, you choose either a salad, a sandwich (pita), or a plate.  Then you choose your meat and/or veggies.  Last stop is toppings (hummus, sauce, etc.) and sides.  They have three pre-made options on the &#34;OMG&#34; menu.  It&#39;s relatively healthy and it&#39;s tasty, as well as very filling.  I had the chicken kabob salad.  The chicken was incredibly tender and covered in what I think was some sort of curry powder mix.  Top that all off with some homemade hummus and you&#39;re all set.  It can be a bit pricey (a salad, without a drink, came to $9) but it&#39;s worth it if you&#39;re in the mood for something that will fill you up without clogging your arteries.

Like every other lunch place in the city they have adopted the Chipolte style menu and ordering system, where you have 3 different meal styles (sandwich, salad, or plate) using the same ingredients.  I&#39;m over this model, but I won&#39;t hold it against RMG.  I went with a salad with grilled vegetables, olives, red onion, cucumber/tomato salad and the cucumber dill yogurt dressing.  It was very good, despite the vegetables being warm, which I usual wouldn&#39;t like on mixed greens.  All the flavours went very well together and the pita bread on the side was tasty.

I have noticed that fast-casual restaurants are striving for competitive advantage; customers love customization, and more of these places are going the way of Chipotle: pick your base, pick your protein, and pick your extras. Roti really has done a great job going this route and I love their offerings! There is plenty to make it as healthy or as decadent as you please, with simple salad bases and extras to full on steak or lamb cut straight from the spit. There is enough to please the carnivores and the herbavores. 

For a base price of $8.75, I was able to get a rice bowl with hummus, cucumber and tomato salad, falafel, yogurt sauce, feta, grilled vegetables, and a side of pita bread. It was perfectly filling and I was not overstuffed. The hummus was creamy and the fresh-baked pita was a lovely touch. The feta cheese was tangy and salty, everything I love about feta! The cucumber and tomato salad was refreshing.The grilled vegetables were tasty and smoky if not a bit too slippery for my plastic fork to perfectly latch onto. The yogurt sauce was fantastic; I&#39;d certainly splurge for an extra side of it next time. The falafel could have been better, but I&#39;ll give it the benefit of the doubt as I&#39;m sure it had been sitting in its metel serving container for a short while. It was a little spicy towards the end, but the yogurt sauce cooled it off nicely. And in terms of autheticity, there were legit large chunks of chickpeas in the falafel...hell, there were whole chickpeas in a couple of pieces! 

That 1 p.m. rush of Wall Street titans was evident, but the place cleared out by 1:30 with a slight resurrgence around 2. Still, they get you though those lines fast!

It&#39;s one of those build your own meal concept places but it seems to work as the line was outside the door.
I decided on the salad with chicken kebob. Depending on how you customize your meal, there are many flavors going on. All meals are $8.45. 
The salad was more like toppings with some greens rather than a salad. Vegetables and hummus were  included and you then have the option to choose cous cous, tomato/onion, red cabbage or eggplant. Next, choose your dressing and another option of one out of the 3 toppings--olives, feta cheese or red onions.
I really enjoyed my salad as it was quite flavorful but for the money, the portion size was a bit skimpy--hence the removal of a half star. I was hungry not long after I finished it.

Once I dropped my rice plate on the floor literally seconds after holding it in my hands and they made me a new one without batting an eye! So, so nice.
The food is delicious... you really can&#39;t go wrong -- all the side add-ons are good (although I&#39;m partial to the cucumber-tomato salad and the cabbage) and the olives are particularly delish. Good serving size, too. If you like spicy make sure to get the S&#39;Hug sauce - it has a real kick to it! And surprisingly, there&#39;s never a crazy line here like you&#39;ll find at Chop&#39;t across the street. Like others have said, speedy like Chipotle and IMO just as delicious.

Would recommend anyone looking for something different and good to eat. I bring all my friend here. The place only fits roughly 15 people so it might be hard finding seats sometimes. One of the hidden gems in NYC.

I have been coming here since it opened. Probably one of the most unique fast food places in the city. The service is great and the food is even better. They are also known for their spicy options so if you are sick of places that offer &#34;spicy food&#34; and it isn&#39;t spicy at all this place will not disappoint you in the spice levels."

They have a great lunch special ($10) that comes with your choice of small kottu (a small was more than enough food), a small side, and a drink. I opted for the tofu kottu and the fish patties. They were empty as they had just opened for business at noon and so my order was made quickly and I was in and out in about 5 mins. The restaurant is cute and small but comfortable. I would go back to eat in.

The food itself was great but SPICY. I love spicy food, I really do, but next time I&#39;d order the mild instead of the medium. The server warned me that the spice heat was high and I should&#39;ve listened. By the end of my lunch I couldnt taste much due to the tingling and numbness in my mouth. The fish patties also came with a red sauce that was equally fiery. I wish it had come with the coconut mint sauce instead.

I&#39;d be back to try some of the other menu items but I&#39;d reduce my choice of spice level!"

We got the small chicken kottu roti with a fried egg and the small prawn kottu roti with the crispy prawns. Since we ordered in, the prawns weren&#39;t all that crispy and both the kottu rotis tasted pretty similar. Also the yolk of the fried egg wasn&#39;t runny. They tasted really good nevertheless.
We also got one of the sambols with shredded coconut , don&#39;t remember the name, but it paired perfectly with the kottu roti.
One critique which I would give is the pricing which I feel is a little steep. The kottu roti needs something on the side because it can pretty dry by itself and for the price that it is, they could easily include a sambol in that price($10 to $12 for a small chicken kottu roti) which otherwise is a little expensive for $1 extra for a really small portion of sambol. Overall it s great to order in for a lazy comfort meal but it will definitely taste better and more fresh if ordered and eaten on the spot."

i wasn&#39;t sure what i was getting frankly, is it a curry, is it a what? Idk, but the reviews are high so I ordered it on UberEats (which shits all over Seamless btw). And lol, I open it and I&#39;m like, oh, this is pulao. It&#39;s fucking hipster pulao. 

It was delicious. It was spicy. It was meaty. It was veggie. It was everything my tastebuds were craving. But I&#39;m probably not going to order it again.

Why? 

I could be totally washed but, how exactly is this Sri Lankan food again? All those delicious ingredients I described above are mixed together so intensely that you can&#39;t appreciate them on their own. In other words, I think in an attempt to make this sort of food accessible to a wider population, they compromised on the authenticity of the cuisine. 

Then again, I could be totally fucking wrong. How the fuck do I know, right? Yes, I&#39;m tamil, but I&#39;m indian. And only a fraction of Sri Lankan&#39;s are tamil. So I don&#39;t really fucking know. But that&#39;s the feeling I got out of this food. That they Americanized it into oblivion. 

And maybe the owner/manager will comment under this all like &#34;Thank you blahblahblah but you&#39;re fucking wrong.&#34; Haha. Let&#39;s find out.

Post review note: Yeah, I was right. They were really upset by this review. And the food upset my stomach anyways, so that knocks it down. They&#39;ll probably try and get this review pulled from the site. They&#39;ll probably call my mom and tell her she didn&#39;t raise me right. Haha.

I&#39;m a fan of spicy food and this place have hit the spot! It&#39;s very street food -like with small eats and some good bottled beers. They specialize in making Kottu (duh, the name gives it away), Kottu is basically stir fried roti. The roti is chopped into small tiny pieces, they get some veggies seasoning and spices. Go big and add a sunny side egg to mix it altogether! I promise you won&#39;t regret it. 

If you like seafood, try their fried prawns. It is tasty and comes with a sort of spicy aioli dip. Skip the south asian fries and try something else. Its basically french fries with Sri Lankan chili spices. It came with a side of sriracha for dipping. The Sri Lankan Fish Cutlets were pretty good. Their fried tuna fish fritters with curry and some vegetables.

I&#39;ve tried their classic chicken and sneaky pineapple Kottu and both are really tasty. There are 4 spice levels from mild, medium, spicy and Sri Lankan spicy. I was a bit of a wuss and went for regular spicy, which was one level before Sri Lankan spicy. Do take advantage of the many sambols they offer to add into your kottu. Sambols are like little spices and with crunchy bits of sides to give it an extra kick for the kottus. I&#39;ve asked which Sambol they recommend and they said the pol sambol. The pol sambol is basically Sri Lankan chili powder mixed with fresh grated coconut, lime, black pepper and salt. I was curious about the cashew sour cream, its crushed cashew blended into a cream with apple cider vinegar, lime and salt. The cashew sour cream gives the kottus a nice mix, it does cool down the spiciness.

If you&#39;re feeling adventurous, you can try about everything with a group of 3-4 friends. I would definitely come back this place to fill my spicy food cravings."

But hey, the very nice waiter will bring you lots of water without making fun of you (at least not openly), so you&#39;ll probably survive! 

Apart from that spicy surprise, the kottus are really good - it was my first time eating one, and the flavors are quite complex. For $13, you have a large kottu to share (huge) and if you add $1, you&#39;ll have an extra egg (be careful, it is on the super-runny side)."

I enjoyed my shrimp kottu, which was incredibly filling (I think the roti expands a lot in your stomach) and the spice was right. This dish would be everything if I were starving on a cold fall day, but it was pretty delicious on a sweltering summer day as well :)

(I&#39;m not an expert in the cuisine by any means)!

Ate it here: The dish was redeemed for me and I&#39;m glad there&#39;s a place dedicated to it!

Ordered the lunch special, which is one of the best lunch deals this city has. $10 for a small box of Kothu with a side and drink.

Food was packaged in boxes with mock newspaper wax - very amusing presentation, especially for takeout!

Side of fries with (a lot of) paprika tasted like Herr&#39;s Red Hot Chips in french fry form - that&#39;s a good thing.

Classic Chicken Kothu was very dense and flavorful! It was rotiserrie chicken savory and spicy with a kick but can be tolerated (Level 3). They don&#39;t short you on the meat. Could&#39;ve used a crunchy texture but you have the option to add a lentil crunch to it (I messed up on that part).

Very friendly and patient staff. Ambiance is cozy; has drinks. A bit more casual and less sit-downy than Sigiri (but more inexpensive and accepts card) but would definitely come here again! Not sure if I know what&#39;s authentic or not but I can tell you that I liked the Kothu here much better than that place in Lanka!"

A Sri Lankan friend of ours wanted us to come try the foods of his nation and so we decided to try Kottu House. 

I&#39;m super psyched that they have many vegetarian options. Puts the store up there on my list of vegetarian friendly restaurants. 
We ordered a couple of kottu dishes and damn! So many flavors blended into one small little box and of course that egg on top makes everything triple times better.

As one of the only two places to get underrated Sri Lankan food in Manhattan (to my knowledge), Kottu House lives up to their name. They do kottu and they do it well. 

I got a small prawn kottu ($9) and it was delicious. Everything about it was on point: the spice level (medium for me), the shatteringly crisp fried prawns on top that I popped into my mouth whole, the pleasantly chewy pieces of roti, and the big chunks of prawn mixed in with all the vegetables. I got an order of pol sambol ($1) which added some extra spice and texture. It was thoroughly addicting to eat as a spicy food fan. Also, I consider my appetite hearty (to put it flatteringly...more like fatteringly) but I could only finish half of the small order. This carb loaded dish is DENSE. I gladly took the rest home and it reheated up wonderfully. 

I also think the service was worth mentioning. The guy working the counter when I went was very helpful and welcoming, and went out of his way to explain the menu and pour you water. Mind you, this is a casual self service place...but his attitude was better than most of the sit down restaurants I&#39;ve been to. They clearly care about their business.

The staff was very friendly and helpful when ordering.  I had high hopes for my first Sri Lankan feast, but am sorry to report that I left feeling full, but not so satisfied.  I mean the food was fine, but I was hoping for really delicious.  The classic chicken (ordered mild) was just hot enough.  Despite having many interesting ingredients and the perfect amount of heat, the dish lacked flavor (I told my gf I thought it would be better with a little more salt and a pinch of MSG). I love the street food concept, and overall the prices were reasonable, but $4 for a cup of tea seems a bit much.

Great packaging: sustainable, compostable, and attractive.  Good spice level (spicy gave off enough heat without being oppressively fiery). The shrimp was seasoned nicely.  The stir-fried mushy starch mixture wasn&#39;t all that compelling for me.  A bit one note, but maybe that&#39;s what the dish is supposed to be like.

Seawater fish kottu was flavorful and delicious (prefer spicy!). I can&#39;t really tell what&#39;s the ingredient.. looks like a lot of stuff fried together.

A small portion ranges between $7-$9, while a larger portion of the kottu is north of that starting at around $12. 

Do not be duped by the portions. I ordered takeout twice and the containers looked small, but inside they contained a lot of food. It&#39;s also nice to have a sample of Sri Lankan cuisine, something that is not usually found in NYC despite its cosmopolitan range of food. Kottu as I learned is chopped roti bread that is mixed in with curry, some vegetables, egg, and your choice of protein or eggplant (garden). 

Twice did I get the garden. And I would say they were commendable. There&#39;s definitely the flavor from the eggplant itself, the texture from the roti, and the spice of the curry. It&#39;s a very vivid combination of flavors and textures that would make someone come back for more. 

And for more? Their $10 lunch special is worth looking out for. You can get a small kottu and an appetizer. I got the South Asian Fries, which were a clever deviation from their fast food counterparts. Each fry has spice and kick to it. 

For the uninitiated, do NOT ask them for &#34;extra spicy&#34; on your food."

The Classic Chicken was really good too, but not as flavorful then the shrimp one in my opinion, still an amazing dish. The Beef Rolls were crispy and delightful! I also ordered the House Iced Coffee which was pretty good, had a hint of chai in it!

Both the standard pratha/roti version and mung bean (gluten free) version are super tasty - I&#39;ve had the chicken, tofu, and lamb options. The lentil fritters are ah-maze. Don&#39;t skip the grated coconut/lime/chili accompaniment. Spicy fries are addicting and will set your mouth on fire. Kale salad: not your average and I love it.

I decided to opt for a large order of the Classic Chicken Kottu because all my friends know how much I can eat and told me that there was no way in hell a small would fill me up. Thanks for looking out for my fat ass, guys! I also ordered both the Lentil Patties AND the Beef Rolls as per everyone&#39;s recommendation because well I&#39;m a fatass. 

Once my order came (read: my Sri Lankan feast for one), I immediately devoured every single thing. Yes, I did in fact finish everything by myself and I enjoyed each bite right down to the last bit of Beef Roll. 

The Classic Chicken Kottu was honestly amazing and like nothing I&#39;ve ever had before. Jam packed with flavor in every forkful, the chicken was tender and delicious. If you&#39;ve never had kottu before, it&#39;s a street-style Sri Lankan dish made with a combination of chopped up godamba roti, your choice of protein, curry, eggs and vegetables. It was fan-freaking-tastic. 

The Lentil Patties and Beef Rolls were pretty damn good too. I was probably slightly partial to the Beef Rolls but that&#39;s only because this girl loves her meat. The beef was already tasty on its own, but when stuffed in that crispy shell, it somehow became even better. And don&#39;t even get me started on that spicy red sauce you get on the side with the beef rolls...

It&#39;s a tight space with only a few small tables and some stools along a bar, so it&#39;s probably best to order out. Although I guess since it&#39;s technically street food, it&#39;s meant to be quickly eaten on your way out?

I split the deviled beef and the spicy fries. Perfect combo. We ordered the beef spicy , which is the 2nd spiciest level with the first being Sri Lankan spicy. It definitely accumulates but it&#39;s nothing most can&#39;t handle in my opinion.

it&#39;s one of many ways to describe the home/street-cooking of Kottu House&#39;s Sri Lankan (or Singhalese) eats. &#39;Sides Bollywood is an indicator of those Injun folks north of my familia&#39;s homeland. 

the main fare or entree is Kottu--which is chopped roti fried in curry, spices, and some crunchy veggies. i would say this is probably comfort eating in my rents homeland--it&#39;s not an everyday meal, so it&#39;s amazing that Kottu House has taken this singular dish and broken it out in so many delicious ways.

the Kottu&#39;s come in two sizes small and large. 

Pro Tip #1: if you&#39;re eating with a few folks, ordering several different &#34;smalls&#34; is a good call for variety&#39;s sake and so you don&#39;t OD on one version of the dish. the &#34;large&#34; is a healthy portion for one.

Pro Tip #2: the folks who work here will usually ask you for your spice tolerance in terms of American (non-brown person) and Sri Lankan (brown person). i opt for medium Sri Lankan--which is still pretty spicy, but enjoyable for &#34;hotheads&#34; such as myself. #seewhatididthere. do not opt for the maximum spiciness unless you can actually enjoy the food. i never understand when people do because all they are doing is inhaling their food and gulping water while tasting nothing. don&#39;t be those people--enjoy the journey of your meal unless you enjoy stinging reminders in the morning. ha.

you can opt to sit down if there are seats available. the space probably sits about 14-16 total via stools at the bar which is where you order and some seating options on the left and right of the restaurant. if you sit, they will bring the food to your table. there are some beer, wine, and non alcoholic options that they do table service for...and they carry the Sri Lankan brew LION! dooooo eeeeeet. 

you can also order for takeout at the counter, call it for pickup or use SEAMLESS for pickup as well. there&#39;s a seamless discount code for your first takeout order i believe. it will take about 15-20 minutes after you order, so bounce and come back. this place gets crowded as a mofo in the evening hours. late night or lunch works better--most times.

the space is very low-lit with some decor items of Singhalese origins like a Buddha statue and some other accent pieces. otherwise the small space is not overly decorated and keeps the space fairly organized and yet homey/comfy/cozy. the left wall has a cool amount of photos which i assume are tied to the owners. and the right side is brickface. simple. not busy. aesthetically even and pleasing. fyi: the bathroom is downstairs. 

Pro Tip #3: Kottu&#39;s to order: Really like the classic chicken; the crispy prawn; and deviled beef. the other choices are pretty good but the first three really nail it especially with the bite of spicy hotness. they also serve a Tofu Kottu--and as i always say the best way to serve TOFU is to throw it in the garbage and order something else. LOL. #seewhatididthere. don&#39;t order tofu. ugh. man up.

Pro Tip #4: you can add egg to the top of any Kottu. i like adding it to the chick&#39;n. it seems unnecessary on other Kottus. 

there are &#34;short eats&#34; aka appetizers. of those i&#39;d recommend the salmon cutlets, beef rolls, calamari dusted with Sri Lankan spices/chilis. i hear they have Sri Lankan inspired french fries...but i think that might be too much fry-carb heaviness for me with the Kottu. to each his or her own as the fries do look interesting. 

there are some coconut sambols and a onion/chiles based sambol that are tasty side items to up and round out the hot spiciness with different flavor combos. i don&#39;t typically associated sambols with kottus bc they are more a staple of eating with traditional rice and curry. however introducing the sambols via the comfiness of the kottus is a cool way of educating folks new to Sri Lankan edibles.

there are some dessert options, but i&#39;ve never been a fan of Sri Lankan dessert as they venture towards the saccharine sweet boundaries of my tastebuds&#39; threshold.

the staff is friendly. it&#39;s a tiny kitchen and orders in the restaurant and takeout seem to back up pretty quickly. the young lady working the counter had her back to customers for like 10-15 minutes while figuring out how to stack orders from in the restaurant and outside of the restaurant. it was weird. she was pleasant enough, but no staffer should ever have his/her back to customers that long. the tiny restaurant&#39;s popularity seems to be creating some stress-ure and growing pains. look forward to seeing how they can get everything synched up in a less stitched-and-duct-taped way, so things roll more smoothly. a bigger space with a bigger kitchen might be the answer. idk.

Kottu House is definitely a place you can call home for faraway eats from the tiny island nation of Sri Lanka. high hopes for this joint as its popularity continues to grow,

drops mic, so i can cut this insane spicy Kottu with some beer!
i out.

So Sri-lankan may not be mainstream, but it totally should be! The food here is so fresh and authentic. They serve kottu here which is basically a form of fried rice but instead of rice they use roti which is a thin bread. Plus you get an egg on top. I always say- &#34;an egg on top makes everything taste better&#34;. The lunch specials here are actually a really good deal. You get a small app, kottu and a drink for around $10. They even have passion fruit cider, which is super tough to find in the US. If you love Asian inspired street food with a nice kick, this is the place to go!"

The curry battered prawns are small fried shrimp, almost similar to popcorn shrimp. Five small shrimp for $7, with little curry flavor to speak of. I hate to be so harsh, but they are not worth the money. 

The beef rolls (2 for $6) are the better choice, and come with a solidly spicy sauce. They&#39;re delicately flavored with curry and the sauce itself is pretty good.

The lunu sombol is slightly spicy but seemed to get it&#39;s flavor primarily from chili flakes. There were supposed to be red onions and lime in there, but none of that came through flavor wise. The consistency is sort of paste like. 

The place is very small, and can seat about 15 people when every seat is taken. Don&#39;t bring your groups, pets, or children. They do have a bathroom located downstairs which is nice. The service was super sweet and polite, but I really wasn&#39;t too into the food. I gave three stars because it&#39;s not really fair to judge a place on two appetizers, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be coming back."

Do not get anything less than spicy and highly recommend adding the egg as kotthu is normally a pretty dry dish.

We had both never tried Sri Lankan cuisine and decided to just go across the street and check this place out. We came here around noon and it wasn&#39;t that crowded; there were only three other customers eating inside. The inside is pretty small and can only seat a handful of people but the decor is pleasing to the eye. 

When we sat down and received the menu, we were confused af. Thankfully, the guy at the cashier was really kind and friendly and took us through the whole menu! We decided to each go with the lunch special (I forgot the exact name, but it was cute). We each got the Classic Chicken kottu and I got the spicy fries while my friend got the Sri Lankan fish cutlets. 

When we received our order, we thought the presentation was super cute. My friend especially liked the cute fork, haha. When we took our first bite of the kottu, we were both really happy that it was really good! I probably should have made it a little spicy instead of very mild but I wanted to be on the safe side because I have a pretty low tolerance for spicy food. I really liked my spicy fries but the Sri Lankan fish cutlets were pretty bomb as well. I&#39;m kind of wondering why I didn&#39;t try Sri Lankan food sooner!

The restaurant inside was quite small, cozy you might say. Maybe at most, 10-12 seats? Cool LED sign on the wall. Server/cashier was super friendly and informative, I wished I could&#39;ve remembered his name for this review. 

Food was the bomb. I loved everything I ordered. I had the tofu blast kottu and the lentil patties. I noticed that they use a lot of coconut and spices, no complaints there! I also really liked the fact that I can choose the level of spice and size. (People love choices!!)

I settled on a coconut flour (??) crepe filled with cheese and an egg (add a spicy sambol), and then had a Kottu but with the mung bean noodles and pineapple (gluten free).

Food wasn&#39;t bad but on the expensive side for street food. Fizzy mango: not mango enough. But I appreciate that it was not too sweet. They were out of the mango mousse, which was disappointing, and don&#39;t seem to have coffee flan anymore, which was also disappointing. Ordered a small classic chicken (mild) and beef rolls: I guess Sri Lankans eat cow (forgive my ignorance but that was a mild surprise). Even though the place was not very full, it took a long time to get our food, which I don&#39;t mind because it usually means things are being made to order, but I was surprised that the food was not very hot (temperature hot), even the deep fried beef roll, which was nice and crunchy and tasted a lot like a samosa (or I guess an Ethiopian sambussa because beef), shaped like an egg roll, though the breading was more like a mozzarella stick in texture. My biggest complaint was that the filling was not hot (temperature) enough - it was surprisingly lukewarm considering how fresh and crispy the outside was. The chicken was pretty good but the mild was too hot even for the DH, who said it kicked his ass. I could only manage a few bites before I had to stop (but I&#39;m a spice weenie). Apparently what you want to get is very mild.

I like how the receipts tell you everything in detail. Great for AR people like me who like to keep track of everything they eat/buy.

I guess people like the gimmicky projected moving sign on the wall, but we sat there for a long time without even noticing it. I feel like it&#39;s wasteful to even have it. Hopefully it&#39;s at least an LED lamp."

This quote from Ligaya Mishan&#34;s New York Times review is written in chalk on the blackboard outside the restaurant. Ligaya got that right (as she usually does, but for her errors of judgment regarding the West Bengal restaurant, Haldi in Curry Hill).

Kottu House does a phenomenal job at Kottu. Pictures can&#39;t do the dish justice as it is not only difficult to photograph it in the restaurant (given the casual containers enclosing the dish) but also what visual Picasso can one expect from chopped roti, chopped meat and fried thinly sliced vegetables?? 

&#34;It&#39;s like fried rice without the rice&#34;, was how an adventurous Caucasian diner described the dish to her companion. Technically correct, but a comparably descriptive insult would be to hear a Chicago native describe New York pizza as thinner pizza with the cheese on top of the sauce... :)

Kothu might not be the national dish of Sri Lanka, but its popularity transcends geography and income demographics. It&#39;s so popular that the Tamils in the north inspired a comparative interpretation in South India called Kothu Parotta.

The sound of metal on metal as the dish is cooked creates awareness that the dish is being prepared. Its sound similar to a rhythmic tabla on metal, but perhaps to comply with restaurant regulations, the sound inside the restaurant isn&#39;t as loud as it normally is, particularly at roadside restaurants in Sri Lanka.

The version at the restaurant is as delightful as any exceptional execution: meaning it will tantalize your taste buds and the spice levels will gut your insides. You&#39;d better finish the meal with the Sri Lankan flan: Wattalappam (made of Jaggery) so that you&#39;re shouting Wattalappam the next morning ;)

A meal should set you back less than $25 with tip, and for spice hounds it is completely worth it.  The key difference for me from my many meals at other Sri Lankan restaurants within the city is that they use fresher spices and don&#39;t hold back on using both powdered spices as well as green peppers.

(Rounding up from 4.5 stars, that half star deduction driven by the fact that the beef has often been fried to a drier texture than normal, I wouldn&#39;t have been critical till the chewy texture almost reminded me of Beef Jerky)"

Food 5 stars

I&#39;ve had most of the things on the menu and have never been disappointed. Even when I&#39;m stuffed, I&#39;ll come here and eat knowing that I won&#39;t regret it. The food here is super flavorful - definitely can pack a punch in the spice arena too (be careful!). The place/avail seating is pretty small (~6 people at tables, ~6 people at bar-like seating) but they&#39;re super accommodating. One time I ordered a kottu and beef rolls (v good btw) and they semi-forgot about my beef rolls (the group I was with was like 15 people!) and they didn&#39;t charge me and were so so nice about everything - they even threw in free flan for everyone for being slow in getting everyone&#39;s orders done.

Although none of their kottus have disappointed, my favorites are seawater fush and deviled beef. The fish is done pretty fish sauce-y and I love it. Must order at least one kottu.

House iced coffee is like a legit vietnamese coffee with some chai flavors YUM

South Asian Fries are kinda like normal fries (I might be biased because I don&#39;t like potatoes) but I&#39;d opt for their beef rolls or lentil patties instead.

The place is super small with seating for only about 6 people and most of the patrons take the food to go.Menu is pretty simple and short, different types of kottu and appetizers.We ordered the prawn based kottu with fish cake appetizers along with lunu sumbhal which is a spicy red chilli based chutney.
First few observations, they use these cardboard size boxes for serving kottu and give out forks. It is very uncomfortable to eat kottu with forks ( use spoons if possible) , one should roll back the four sides of cardboard box otherwise it is very user unfriendly. Kottu by itself wasn&#39;t what we were expecting to be , a lot of Chilli though otherwise no flavor with mix of roti, veggies and spices. 3 small prawn were put on top of kottu and they were almost burnt with the shell on.One would expect a good portion for $15 but the portion size was considerably very small. We were left hungry after our meal. Fish cakes don&#39;t come with a side sauce , without the sauce they taste very dry.
Overall a nice concept but not very well executed."

Kottu House is a pretty small and cozy establishment with only a handful of tables so I wouldn&#39;t bring a large party. The menu is pretty compact, highlighting kottus but they also have a handful of appetizers and two dessert options. 

Kottu is apparently a super popular street food consisting of chopped roti stir fried with a protein of your choice, egg, veggies and a ton of spices. I decided on the seawater fish, to go.

My order took about 10 minutes to make and was packaged nicely. Love the cute wooden forks. I could smell the fragrant spices seeping out with every step I took on the way home and definitely quickened my pace.

The kottu was absolutely delicious and packed so much heat even though I only ordered mild. The flavor profile of all the spices definitely made my mouth water, eyes tear and stomach churn. So good though. The small was enough.

Our party also tried the classic chicken and kale salad. Everyone raved about the flavors.

We also split the beef app and fries. Both were good, but nothing special.

The star is the kottu. It comes in five heat levels from 1, which has a small bit of a bite to 5 that was described as &#34;the surface of the sun&#34; by our excellent and attentive server. I like spicy food a lot, so I went with a 3. My dinner partner who is not as spice tolerant as I am went with a 3 as well. He was literally sweating and I was at my spice limit as well.

It was literally iced tea with fresh ginger poured in which might&#39;ve been better if the ginger was added in advance and left to, er marinate?, longer. Some sips were gingery, some weren&#39;t.

I write that in all seriousness. This was my first experience at a Sri Lankan restaurant. I had a past roommate who was from Sri Lanka and  occasionally she would cook dishes she grew up with, and the one thing that always stuck out to me was the level of spice. My nose always ran and I would be sobbing as I chewed. The same thing happened at Kottu House, but the waitress showed more concern for my well being than my roomie, but I never wanted to stop eating. The texture of the food was my favorite part: slightly crispy but tender, oily but not dripping. Mmmm.

Menu of the night:
Lentil patties
Beef rolls
Garden Kottu
Deviled Beef Kouttu

They specialize in one thing: kottu, a Sri Lankan street food made of shredded roti, then given the fried rice treatment - i.e. stir-fried with egg and a slew of other things.

&#34;Small&#34; portions start at a happy $7 and are enough for a small meal, because it&#39;s all starch and heaviness.

The black tofu kottu and black chicken kottu tasted similar, as expected: thoroughly satisfying, fresh but with the fury of spices that have been forced to mingle for awhile (not actually spicy, though). The spiced fries were very ordinary.

The only other Sri Lankan restaurant I remember ever visiting (Sigiri) was not nearly as interesting or approachable. Our waitress was very friendly and gracefully tolerated Karry L&#39;s &#34;brusque asshole&#34; persona. 

The cherry on top was that they have Rekorderlig strawberry and lime cider! O nostalgia!"

We got small portions of the seawater fish (tilapia when we went), deviled beef, and the classic chicken. We also got a side of the minchi sambol, lentil patties, and fries. The fries might have been overkill since we couldn&#39;t even finish our meal. 

I would suggest, if you can&#39;t take the heat, to request for a lower level bc their default is very spicy. I didn&#39;t know that and teared through my meal. Good thing there is a huge jug of water for a constant supply of hydration. The ginger tea helped as well (it&#39;s lightly sweetened btw). 

Even if you ask for less heat in your dish, you will still sweat. When I went, it was a 90 degree humid evening. There was no AC on but there was a ceiling fan. Sitting by the window helped mildly.  Maybe don&#39;t go here on a first date, or do, to see how your date handles tough situations. 

Service is really fast considering there is only one guy behind the counter &amp; one cook in the kitchen. Can&#39;t imagine how hot that guy might be! 

You can sit in the restaurant but there are two tables and maybe 4 stools at the bar. There was no wait when I was there for a table but it was 9p on a Mon evening. There was brisk business though."

The kottu was so delicious. There was an abundance of chicken (no skimping here!) and plenty of flavor- not totally sure what the whole thing is composed of though.

What a great friend I am!

I spent 10 days on the island in April, tracking through the tea plantations and winding rail track of the highlands and the beaches, historical forts and classic hotels that dot the long coastline. It&#39;s a wonderful place, pleasantly located on the nexus between the familiar and the unfamiliar.

The food wasn&#39;t always great. In some towns, we found a community basically without restaurants, with the vast majority of the population eating at home. There were only snack bars that served just a fraction of the food pictured or listed on menus. That left us at the mercy of hotels, where sometimes there were banquets and other time just a tasteless plate of noodles. Eventually, we wound up with some excellent food - crab in Colombo, fresh-killed snapper on the beach, continental fare at the port of Galle, but many traditional Sri Lankan dishes I&#39;d sampled on Staten Island alluded our party.

Kotthu was one of them. I&#39;ve had this in the humble hilltop surroundings of Tompkinsville, but that requires a ferry ride and steep climb to reach. With Kottu House, this is not available in comfortable surroundings. Songs from Jamie xx&#39;s still-unreleased debut album came through the speakers. The space is small, but it&#39;s been artfully arranged to contain several distinct tables. 

I was here for the kotthu, so we ordered every one of the four on happy hour special. The cheap beers and discounted food is a pretty incredible bargain. We could have escaped with three kotthu for our eventual party of five (one came late). With a round of PBRs, they are offering one of the best dinner and a drink deals in the city.

The Italian kotthu, as others have noted, is a miscalculation, but otherwise traditional and more exotic flavors mix well. Swapping rice for another grain gives the dish an unfamiliarity that a stir-fry or pasta can&#39;t match. The short eats section of the menu (not sampled on this visit) seems largely to placate fussier eaters. If this allows more diverse parties to sample the cuisine, I&#39;m all for it.

I guess I really am a great friend."

Their main dishes (kottus) come in both small and large sizes, which is great because it gives a little more control to the customer in deciding how their meal will be like.  Me and my friend tried the classic chicken and sneaky pineapple dishes.  From the short eats, we ordered Sri Lankan fish cutlets and South Asian fries.  I do not recommend getting the short eats unless you&#39;re rich, because as the name suggests, they take only half a minute to eat, leaving a very short-lived good impression of the food.  I thought that the sneaky pineapple was well made and reasonably portioned... although I don&#39;t know how the pineapple is sneaky.  Regardless, the setting looked very unique.

He runs his own comic book (apparel?) company on the side and I could talk to this place for hours. But back to the food. I had the sneaky pineapple kottu in coconut curry and the &#34;from the lab&#34; special kottu of the day, which was lamb. The pineapple was really sneaky. The lamb was gamey, which I liked. And for those who aren&#39;t familiar with Sri Lankan food, it is not at all like thai pineapple fried rice. Portions are huge! Even a small would more than satiate a hungry person--you&#39;ve been warned. I also had the lentil patties (4 pieces for $5) with a side of minchi sambol, which is made of mint, coconut, green chilly, garlic, and lime.

Also nothing tasted oily - rather I found the proteins cooked perfectly in every case. 

Favorites so far were:
CRISPY PRAWN + egg - the shrimp was cooked perfectly tender
SPICY CALIMARI - again, perfectly cooked!
LENTIL PATTIES
FRIED FISH

And opt for the fried egg if they ask. Like others have mentioned, even the mild is pretty spicy so definitely keep yourself refreshed with one of their drinks. The fizzy mango was excellent and they also have cocktails.

So when I heard of this place, I made sure to check it out. It was a little shop located in a great little neighbourhood with great and talkative staff. Being a kinda expert on kottu roti, I was sadly let down by this place. Firstly because they had no mutton kottu roti, which is my books is the 8th cardinal sin. Secondly the food was slightly charred, missing some key ingredients, and didn&#39;t live up to my spicy expectations.

I got the classic chicken kottu with an added egg on top. The flavor profile was excellent. The other reviewers on here are pretty accurate regarding the spice level. I got &#34;medium&#34; which was more like a solid &#34;10&#34; on the 1-10 scale that most Asian restaurants use in the city so be careful. The staff and owner were on hand when I went in and they were happy to explain the ins and outs of their unique menu.

I&#39;m really surprised that kottu bowls haven&#39;t taken off globally yet or that this place was not more crowded (probably because its tucked away on a pretty nondescript street in LES).
I just wish they had another location in Midtown so I could grab kottu bowls for lunch at work."

FOOD
We&#39;ve been here about 4 times now, ordering different items each time (as well as a few &#34;standbys&#34;) It&#39;s hard to describe the food, but overall, it&#39;s simply fantastic. 

The cocktails and sangria-on-tap are also truly amazing. 

ATMOSPHERE
Nice atmosphere. Building is on a corner, so there&#39;s a lot of light all over. It also has a small bar upstairs. Very nice. 

SERVICE
Good service."

Their site is awful but the service inside and the food made up for it. The beef tenderloin stir fry (renamed on the menu from the Peruvian &#39;Lomo Saltado&#39;) was excellent, and certainly a nice profit for them @$56 but in our opinion satisfying and filling enough for 2 to split that it seemed worth it. The addition of rice near the end is a great touch, as was a cook checking how we liked it. Complimentary sparkling water (refilled often) helped wash it down throughout.

Every single thing I ordered was flavorful and unique.  My roommate and I shared a pitcher of the Llama Del Rey which was a good size serving and got us buzzed :)  It was a little on the sweet side but the frozen grapes on the side made it a unique twist.  We also ordered the Pork Belly which was really good but a small serving. I wish we ordered multiples.  We then got the quinoa and ceviche which had such unique flavors! I just couldn&#39;t get enough.  Lastly, we ended with the Beef Tenderloin &#34;Stir-Fry&#34; which was BOMB! But also huge! You can share with with 3/4 people! 

Lastly, we ended with some chocolate ice cream cookie crunch thing! I dont know what it was but I know it was DELICIOUS! 

Love this place!"

Super delicious with tender, medium rare pieces of tenderloin, onions, scallions (some of them were pretty harsh though!), tomato, and topped with fries. LOVED the scallion pancake lomo saltado hybrid--every bite was salty, meaty, potato-ey, and creamy with the avocado and crema. For $56, it&#39;s a high price to pay, though, but worth a try. And definitely filling! Our waiter also came by at the end and placed some rice into the leftover sauce...I thought it&#39;d be amazing but somehow tasted saltier? Hm.

Also, the quinoa with banana, cashews, bacon is way more delicious than it sounds. Crunchy red quinoa mixed with regular quinoa, cubes of bacon (yum!), and the crunch of cashews--the textures were so great. I wasn&#39;t in love with the sweetness of the bananas but that was okay and didn&#39;t take away much from my enjoyment of the meal. I can honestly say I&#39;ve never had another dish quite like this. $15 or $16 (can&#39;t quite remember.)

Service was okay but the restaurant was louder than I like. I loved the atmosphere with the plants hanging over the counters and the fact that three of the restaurant&#39;s walls are basically all windows. Wish the view were a bit better though! Maybe they could transform that big sidewalk space into a cute garden :)

Anyway, the food is delicious but the prices are high. Go if you&#39;ve got deep pockets and take me with you."

We ordered the pork belly (GET IT, please just try it) to start and made our way through the quinoa/banana dish and the beets and goat cheese with gooseberry. So many flavors I have literally never even considered together tasted fucking amazing. Quinoa, banana, avocado, and bacon? YES. Give me all of it. We had some sort of tuna ceviche with bananas that was unreal and ended with the rock shrimp, calamari, and clams dish, which had sooo much flavor.

I can&#39;t recommend this place enough, not only for the food but the drinks and service as well. We ended the night with delicious picarones and coffee/tea. I walked into work this morning already blabbing about this place and I can&#39;t wait to come back and eat again!

I thought it was unpleasant and served bad food masquerading as clever variations of more familiar dishes.

To begin with, the place operates as much as a bar as a restaurant.  The one room is dominated by a large square bar which is packed.  The millennials seem to love this place and favor the bar as much as the restaurant food.  The noise level is deafening.  I could not hear my wife unless she turned to me to speak, making the dining experience less than comfortable.  But then comes the food.

I liked the salads, which were a bit skimpy, but fresh and flavorful.  Everything else was annoying and badly conceived.  If this is what expensive food is in Peru, it is no wonder there are so many Peruvians in the States.  The main dishes are &#34;large Plates, which are dominated by french fried potatoes with seared meat and onions and peppers on top.  I could make this strange dish for about $5 or $6, but they charge $58.  The sea food mix was equally strange with a mix of seafood in a red sauce of undistinguished flavoring that looked like a gloppy mess.  The small plates were skimpy, as in 2 bites for $6 or $7 each.  To ease our meal, we each had a drink from the bar.  They have many mixed drinks which all seem a bit strange, but, what the heck, let&#39;s see what they drink in Peru.

Well they drink a lot of rubbish, if these drinks are an example.  The bartenders again try to be clever and &#34;different&#34;, in mix alcohols that do not blend properly.  Every drink was off tasting, so I do not know why the bar does such a good business.  Millennials seem to like the scene more than the ambiance, the food or the drinks.  This might have its rewards, but at $80 a person, including tip, this restaurant is a bad value, and, more importantly, a bad product.  But, Hey!  It&#39;s Brooklyn!

On one good note, I should comment on the excellent service by the host and waiters.  These are seriously nice and warm fellows who really want you to be comfortable and have the service you deserve.  I left a good tip to reward their excellent service, despite the poor product they serve."

I came here for a girls night with the gals. I made sure to go to a hard spin class before so that I could come ready to indulge in anything and everything that sounded amazing on the menu. 

For three gals, we got the following: 3 anticucho (beef, chicken and pork belly), ceviche, burrata, and the tenderloin stir fry. I also managed to trick my friends into getting the donuts for dessert since donuts seem to be trendy right now. This was the perfect amount of food for us. 

Highlights were definitely the tenderloin stir fry and the pork belly anticucho. I think the tenderloin is really the way to go - the meat was cooked perfectly, with an amazing sauce, and awesome fries - what&#39;s not to love?!

Purple potatoes are definitely a thing here, so we jumped on that bandwagon. I personally got the purple potato pisco sour. Honestly just did it to say I did it and it wasn&#39;t the best pisco sour i&#39;ve ever had, but whatever still enjoyable. 

We had a reservation, but still waited for half hour for our table (typical Brooklyn). I didn&#39;t care at all because we got to enjoy some drinks at their fabulous rooftop bar. 

There were still a bunch of things on the menu that I would love to try, so I plan on coming back, and would certainly recommend!"

When I heard that a &#34;new-Peruvian&#34; restaurant would be opening in Williamsburg, I immediately made plans with one of my travel buddies, and we checked it out this past Sunday night. (Pro-tip: they&#39;re on opentable!).

When I entered the restaurant, it had that upscale Lima vibe to it, between the high ceilings, abundance of greenery, and Andean artwork. Great setting. My friend and I chose to eat at the bar, since it&#39;s often most comfortable. The menu was interesting, but I thought it was a little limited. There are a variety of veg, fish, and meat entrees, and then a small anticucho menu of dressed grilled meats (beef heart, chicken thigh, pork belly, head-on shrimp). They could definitely benefit from another section on the menu dedicated to small vegetable sides (&#34;And I&#39;d like a side of the yams&#34;).

We started with pisco sours, which were expertly made and splashed with that perfect thin line of bitters. I then moved on to the grilled pork belly anticucho, and ordered the duck sausage with farro for my main. I liked the skewer of grilled pork belly, but I loved the tiny spicy pickled chilis that sat on top of it. It was a few really satisfying bites. My duck sausage entree came out shortly after that, and it was delicious too. The combination of all the ingredients: sausage, butternut squash, greens, and farro felt really balanced. My only complaint was that a few areas of the dish skewed towards over-salted.

I usually don&#39;t visit restaurants within the first 2 weeks of their opening because they need time to find their footing and get comfortable. The service last night, while all very polite, definitely felt like the service in a brand new restaurant. If they can get their act together (which eventually I think they will), I think the concept, space, and food at the Llama Inn could really be a valued and unique addition to the New York food scene."

I&#39;ve dined here a couple times now, for dinner and for brunch, and have loved everything. Not one dish has let me down. 

Upon entering the oddly shaped restaurant decorated with lots of greenery at the walls, the first thing you&#39;ll see is a center bar and an open kitchen. It&#39;s a beautiful space--bright and airy in the daytime, and dim and romantic in the evenings. It&#39;s not an absolutely tiny restaurant, but it isn&#39;t too big either and we had to make our reservation about 2 weeks in advance. There&#39;s a stairway too, which leads to the rooftop that will open in the summer.   

When we came for dinner, we were a group of 4. We ordered 4 skewers, the beet salad, ceviche, mussels, and the whole chicken entree. We finished everything and were very happy with the portions. I wasn&#39;t expecting to be impressed with the skewers, but they turned out fabulous. The mussels were delicious with mini croutons tossed in the sauce. And we continued to fall in love with the meal when the whole roasted chicken entree arrived. It was a pretty big plate that took up the middle of the table. The serving size said it was for 2 people, but along with the rest of our plates, it fed 4 people comfortably! The chicken was delicious. It was smokey and juicy and the skin was rubbed with blackened chile. As a side there was also a heap of fried potato wedges, along with 3 dipping sauces. I cannot wait to come back for dinner again! And prices seemed fair. With this meal and each of us having at least 2-3 cocktails, it was about $80pp. 

I learned that Llama Inn also does brunch, so my husband and I went today. We ordered the ceviche, chicken thigh sandwich, and what was essentially a breakfast lomo saltado--beef tenderloin stir fry, french fries, plantain and fried eggs. Again! Everything was a hit. The ceviche was fresh, tangy and spicy, and the sweet potato worked perfectly along with the handful of toasted corn kernels. The chicken thigh sandwich was reminiscent of the delicious chicken served during dinner--juicy and flavorful. In the sandwich was also a plantain, which added a perfect sweet balance to the savoriness of the chicken and salsa. And the lomo saltado... beautifully done! Just looking at it, you can tell the beef tenderloin was a good quality cut and cooked to perfection. The french fries were rich with beef-soaked flavor, yet remained crispy even to the last fry. The plantain was so soft and decadent--it was almost like a custard! The runny fried eggs just topped everything off to give it the &#34;brunch&#34; vibe ;)  

I was expecting good as Chef Ramirez does have Eleven Madison on his pedigree, but I wasn&#39;t expecting Llama Inn to become such a quick favorite for me in the neighborhood. I&#39;m an absolute fan!"

It&#39;s succulent, juicy, perfectly crispy (sorry but only the most creepy adjectives are fit to describe just how good this chicken is).

In addition, the service at Llama Inn is consistently friendly and attentive. In the ultra-hip restaurant scene of Williamsburg, such pretension-free (aka: NOT &#34;too-cool-to-care&#34;) service is hard to come by.

The quinoa was my favorite as it was so different. Who knew bananas would be good in a savory dish? The skewers come 3 on a stick so plus up for more ppl. The heart wasn&#39;t bad, but the idea of heart was too much for me. I did learn a lot about heart that night.

I have a friend that moonlights for the Infatuation and after turning down a half-dozen suggestions she tells me about this new joint that&#39;s only been open for a couple months that serves a Peruvian-inspired brunch. I&#39;m sold. If I wanted avocado toast or an eggs benedict, I&#39;d make that shit at home or go to some bougie SoHo spot but I want a flavor packed brunch that does some cool shit with breakfast (which is why I like places like Cafe Mogador, Onomea, and Manila Social Club). 

I met up with a colleague so we could discuss personal projects and how her boyfriend never wants to come to Brooklyn. I ordered a coffee (French Press) for $4 and the Swiss Chard Empanada for $7. The bake on the empanada was great, the coloring looked a bit underbaked but it definitely wasn&#39;t. Like if I were going to &#39;gram it, I&#39;d bump up the contrast and saturate the colors a bit more if you know what I&#39;m talking about (or they could put a quick egg wash on it before baking).

For the main brunch dish, my friend ordered the Andean Potato which was fried eggs on top of a delicious chunky stew-like base topped with red onions and avocado for $15. Myself, I ordered the beef tenderloin stir-fry placed on a bed of fries and shallots topped with fried eggs.

For dessert, there was only one dish, the bread pudding for $8. When I go to a new place I like to have the full experience so of course it was ordered even though I detest raisins (which were in the dish), but surprisingly I liked it alot. It had toffee, almond, golden raisins and topped with whipped cream. I would put that on par with the Ube bread pudding at Manila Social Club and the sweet bread pudding at Bakeri. 

The space is large, two levels (rooftop bar which will open when it&#39;s warmer), a large central bar so the flow of the room is great. Surrounded by windows with tables flanking one wall, wrap around counters against another, and booths back by the kitchen with a couple odd bistro tables peppering the space. It&#39;s very light, bright, airy, and modern. 

This place is definitely one of my new favorites. The service was a smidge off in the sense that I had to a couple times crane my neck and try to peer into the back of my waiter&#39;s head to get her attention but other than that, it&#39;s great... which means Gothamist is going to pick it up and it&#39;ll turn into Manila Social Club where by 11:15am, brunch is booked for the whole day. I&#39;m just glad I got to eat here before it was cool.

I will be back for dinner."

I went to visit Peru last year and explored the full range of Peruvian cuisine, from the acclaimed eco-friendly fine dining establishment Central restaurant to sanguche (Peruvian sandwich) joint. I learned that my taste bud is perhaps more American/European than South American as I had some mixed experiences with the Peruvian food, which draws influence from a variety of sources such as Latin American, Japanese and Andean. The flavor and texture of food that I had during my stay didn&#39;t necessarily agree with my taste, although I could never forget the sanguche that I had at La Lucha chain in Lima. Despite its growing influence in the global culinary world, Peruvian cuisine hasn&#39;t been a big part of New York dining scene (in general, South American cuisine other than perhaps Brazilian is still very underrepresented in Big Apple). I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of good things about Llama Inn that opened recently under the helm of chef Erik Ramirez, and I wanted to see how the kitchen presents the Peruvian flavor and texture as I remembered from my time there last year. Overall, I was very pleased with the versatility of modern interpretation of Peruvian food that the kitchen displayed. 

I wouldn&#39;t call the food at Llama Inn authentic Peruvian food, although the inspiration and ingredients are definitely from Peru. Any meal at this place should start with at least one or two anticuchos (skewered snacks); I ordered all four on the menu and particularly enjoyed pork belly (with pickled chilis and spicy mayo on top) and head on shrimp (with adobo and garlic seasoning and lime on the side). There were other pleasant surprises. Quinoa is a staple of Latin American food, but I didn&#39;t expect the kitchen to mix it up with banana, avocado, bacon and cashew to create a very delightful but not heavy flavor. This could be the type of salad that would make die-hard vegetarians (minus the bacon) or locavores swoon over. Peruvian food is also well-known for its raw fish (ceviche or tiradito), and I really enjoyed the mix of persimmon and yuzu that accompanied red snapper tiradito that was silky smooth. The highlight of the night, however, belonged to the modern take of Peruvian-Chinese classics, lomo saltado. which is basically a stir fry that includes beef steak with onions and other vegetables, typically served with potato fries and rice. The one at Llama Inn replaced rice with scallion pancake to eat like you normally do for tacos. I absolutely loved this mix of beef tenderloin, red onion, tomato, avocado (served on the side), cilantro and pickled chilis. Each bite was pure decadence and how matter how full I was, my dining companion and I almost finished the entire thing (which seems more apt for sharing by three or more people)! Beef was cooked very nicely and the combination of vegetables worked very well as well, while fries were also delicious. This is the food I would absolutely come back to Llama Inn for, perhaps with more people this time because I was beyond full for several hours before I went to bed. I still mustered willpower to order at least one dessert, and the chocolate and lucuma dessert was quite delightful without being overly sweet.

Llama Inn has an absolutely charming d√©cor, with a mix of sophistication and Williamsburg casualness. The restaurant has a full bar, and I highly recommend trying their Llama del Rey, which is sort of like sangria but way better than the run-of-the-mill sangrias elsewhere in the city. Getting a reservation wasn&#39;t particularly challenging, and although the dining room was nearly packed throughout the course of my meal, it doesn&#39;t feel too cramped as the spatial design was quite nicely done, with a bar at the center with tables on the periphery. I&#39;m hopeful that Llama Inn can help pave the way for Peruvian food to gain more popularity in NYC. Not sure I would call it a pioneer, but it certainly deserves its recognition."

Most wealthy people who want to pay $150++ for a little scrap of food in Williamsburg should love it.  The food really tasted delightful.  Service was wonderful.  But this place not for me.  I like red lobster and hate booze.  A cocktail is $14!!!!   WTF?!?!

This was not my time.  Not my place.  And we go to a Peruvian place in MONTCLAIR NJ that we adore but this is nothing like it.  

I will say that my wife made a reservation and we ended up on the bar.  That&#39;s a little ridiculous.  

Worse yet barely anything for vegetarians.  I

We asked to sit on the rooftop and they said the menu was limited up there.  I thought the menu was limited downstairs too.  

Look this restaurant has great food.  But it&#39;s a trendy place that requires waiting and some personal sacrifice for people who aren&#39;t into meat.  

I recommend for some but not for me.  It&#39;s in the middle. Three stars."

Every dish hit the spot. The plates are a bit on the small side and we&#39;re not massive eaters. I would&#39;ve given it 5 stars if the portion size was a bit bigger....

Really good food in a nice chilled setting. It&#39;s not so hipster in terms of the crowd but more relaxing and laid back in a modern kind a way."

4:50pm, a second party of two arrives without reservations hoping to score a walk-in table (they were successful)

5:00pm, a line of at least 12 people form on the sidewalk waiting to enter

5:10pm, the restaurant finally unlocks its doors and grants us entry

I had no idea this place was so popular. Despite being the first party to be seated and order our drinks, we were the last ones served. It could be an oversight on when the waiter entered our order or perhaps the bartender had to redo our drink and put us at the back of the line again. Nonetheless it was noticeable given we had a full view of the bar and other seated parties from our table. Apart from that mishap at the start, the service ramped up well from there. Our silverware was replaced and customized before each meal, and each dish placed on our table was explained in detail.

When ordering, keep in mind that the portions are light. Our party of two with an average appetite ended up consuming two appetizers (ceviche and tiradito), two skewers which come with three cubes of meat each (cow heart and pork belly), and two entrees (goat neck and duck sausage). We actually had to add the goat neck entree later on so we wouldn&#39;t walk out hungry after spending $120 because how sad would that be?

The tiradito came in a refreshing yuzu broth that also had a slight jalape√±o kick to it. The broth is too spicy by itself but it calms the raw fish down nicely when paired together. The ceviche was fresh and the cooked plantain and plantain chips were a nice surprise to find with the dish. 

The skewers on the other hand were passable. The beef heart unfortunately came out cold. I was hoping to have the cool salsa contrast the warm beef, but alas I was to be disappointed. The pork belly tasted very much like a Chinese chasiu (pork) at three times the cost especially with the soy sauce smothered over it but the raw jalape√±os laying over each cube was too much of meat killed my taste buds for future bites. 

Both the duck sausage and goat neck entrees were winners. The duck sausage was juicy and the raw greens over it with the rice made it into a complete meal filled with meat, vegetables, and carbs. The goat was strong in flavor and if you aren&#39;t a fan of lamb or goat perhaps this is not the dish for you. I on the other hand am and devoured this without hesitation.

With a limited menu currently and Brooklyn location I don&#39;t see myself returning in the near future until the menu is expanded or rotated. The cuisine is surprisingly spicy for Peruvian style and I hope in the future they can create more flavor with the dishes without having to rely on the jalape√±os. 3.5 stars rounded to 4."

Having taken a quick glance on yelp and the restaurant&#39;s webpage we ventured into Brooklyn last Saturday for a bite to eat with another couple. Got the point that this was a tapas/small plates place so didn&#39;t expect huge portions, so came only moderately hungry after a late lunch. However didn&#39;t take a look at prices beforehand so was still a bit shocked when the dishes came.  

That being said the flavors of all the dishes were generally fantastic, inventive and flavorful. Service was friendly though there was some time lag 15-20 minutes in between the courses being served. Ambiance was hip and trendy and the restaurant looked well kept. 

Beets ($13): beautiful presentation. Goat cheese sprinkled among individual beet chunks, gooseberry pieces, cancha, muna, red onions, (leaves of arugula?). Tasty but the fact that it&#39;s a beet dish with literally 6 pieces of beets, (not 6 whole beets), was a bit lacking. 

Fluke ceviche ($18): The lime flavor with the dashi, plantains and red onions created a delicious blend of savory with slightly sweet flavor. However there were literally 10 tiny morsels of fish that were less than bite size, like 1/2 inch by 3/4 inch pieces. And about 5-6 pieces of thin, small plantains. When I think of ceviche I think of an appetizer that&#39;s slightly more robust than what we got. 

Antichucho pork belly, chicken thigh, beef heart ($4-5 per skewer, ordered multiple skewers): all had interesting, impactful flavors, didn&#39;t personally try the beef heart but my friend said it was tasty. Pork belly seasoning had a nice spicy heat but was a little much for me, the chicken thigh was delicious and loved the sauce and the potato chips on it for the crunch. 
We did not get the shrimp skewer since it was $6 for ONE shrimp. 

Duck sausage ($18): Thoughtful presentation--the raw greens form a tent over the warm ingredients. The spinach paired wonderfully with the sausage, rice, butternut squash. Added a nice crunch. No complaints here. Loved it. 

Goat&#39;s neck ($19): Pools of potato puree and grilled turnips interspersed elegantly between the chunks of meat. Meat itself was very tender. Wish they gave one more piece of meat since it came with three salt-shaker-diameter-size pieces.

Piccarones &amp; Chancaca ($8): the flavor of the donuts was different and delicious, warm out of the fryer with this gorgeous syrup. Really tasty. 

Bread pudding ($8 or 9?): was a sliver of bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream on top. Not sure if they were trying to balance the aesthetic presentation of the dessert but when the server said that this dessert would be the most substantial, I expected a regular piece--a somewhat rectangular slice or chunk like most restaurants serve--instead of a literally a sliver. The entire sliver was enough for maybe 6 teaspoon size mouthfuls. This was a pretty sad bread pudding. 

Cocktails: I didn&#39;t personally try the cocktails but the menu looked creative and our friends seemed to enjoy them and ordered another round, so I will assume their drinks were good.

We left hungry and picked up some meat skewers from a street food cart on the way home. And I&#39;m someone with a relatively small-medium appetite. 

Conclusion: come here if you want to tantalize your tastebuds but unless you&#39;re planning to order a lot of dishes, then don&#39;t expect to leave full."

Table inventory is tight - the place was filling up on a weeknight at 7pm, but if you can eat later it was almost empty by 9p. Definitely call ahead to see if there&#39;s room. Unfortunately, this place does hold the best tables (booths) for friends/regulars, even if they don&#39;t show up for hours. So, be prepared to sit at an uncomfortable hightop for your romantic night out despite there being multiple empty booths that will remain unseated for the duration of your visit. 
In short: This place has an air of unearned pretension: if they don&#39;t know you, be prepared for the least favorable seating. 

After we were seated, it took over 30 minutes for us to get a server to take our first drink and food order. On a busy saturday night I would sort of expect this, but the place was only moderately full and seemed to have a full complement of waitstaff. The servers seemed to be disorganized - there was confusion about who was covering which tables and there seemed to be several servers covering our table, which in practice meant nobody was. 
In short: very poor service. 

The food was very good - plate scraping indeed. However, the portions are very small in relation to the price - if you are out for a proper dinner with three people and a drink each expect to spend at least $60-75 per person after tip. That&#39;s with one drink - cocktails average $14 each.
In short: food is good but poor value - cost does not compensate for small portions and poor service. 

Based on this experience I certainly won&#39;t be bringing a group to Llama again. I MIGHT grab a drink at the bar and order a small bite, but that&#39;s it. 

If reasonably-priced peruvian without the pretense is your thing, I strongly recommend the neighborhood standby across the street: Chimu. It will take half the time and your wallet (and stomach) will thank you."

And their is a huge BUT... The service is lacking. I&#39;ve been here 3 times now and really trying to love it because I live close by however it&#39;s been the same type of service every time. You will wait 20 min for your first drink and have to beg for a menu. This is not dirty French... Feed the people.

the kicker is that they don&#39;t accept CASH.  No money. And while they don&#39;t tell you this until the bill comes, they say this with a straight face.  Suddenly they lose all the dramatics and prose.  No cash.  

Do Peruvians only pay with credit cards?  I&#39;ve told my neighbors, born and raised in WB, about this latest addition. Lots of shaking heads... Take it back to Lima.

We had a 10:30 pm reservation. We arrived a bit early. Your gracious hostess/Maitre&#39;d informed us that we could sit at a kitchen counter or wait a few minutes for our table. We opted to wait at the bar. We ordered our drinks and almost immediately the hostess informed us that our table was ready. 
A corner table. Banqet and all. Sweet. We had the best view in the restaurant. Rene was our server. He was great. He explained the menu, went over the specials and guided us in the right direction. 
Getting to the point: My mother is a chef. She had a restaurant for 25 years called La Furia Chalaca in Jersey. Comida Criolla. Authentic Peruvian cuisine. I&#39;m consistently dissapointed in Peruvian restaurants in the U.S. on a regular basis. Maybe I&#39;m just biased but honestly nobody cooks like mom. Well, I was fantastically surprised, amazed, astounded and genuinely overwhelmed at how good your food was. Not only did it match moms food but the Ceviche, the Anticuchos, Umitas and the heaven sent Picarones were actually better then hers. Wow. I genuinely felt like I was in Callao, in La Avenida De La Marina, in el Mercado eating food that I would&#39;ve eaten as a child. It was breathtaking. Sublime. Authentic but elevated. Way way elevated.
THANK YOU. It was a marvelous experience. Thank you to your kind and generous staff, your eloquent and passionate Sous Chef who took time out to talk to us and your beautifully I&#39;m appointed dining room for inspiring a warm and inviting atmosphere. Most of all thank you for an amazing dining experience.

They opened up 2 blocks down from my apartment last month or so and let me say - this is the BEST restaurant around here. I&#39;m obsessed. I&#39;ve been here 5 times already, have tried everything on the menu, and STILL keep coming back. The chef is fantastic - every dish is exceptional.

Best cocktail: Tia Julia. (And Some Like It Hot from their brunch menu). Best desserts: Picarones and Chocolate Lucuma.

The servers are so knowledgeable and make excellent recommendations. The service is excellent as well.

They also just opened up for brunch and it does NOT disappoint! The mussels and their take on lomo saltado are out of this world. And if you&#39;re thinking about skipping dessert, DONT!!!! It&#39;s so delicious and completely worth it - so make sure you save some room. You won&#39;t be disappointed.

However, we didn&#39;t have reservations, so we had to sit at the bar. The set-up inside is a bit odd in that there aren&#39;t many tables, and the ones that do exist are mostly for larger parties. The rest of the seating is either at the main bar or long bar tables against the windows. I have no problem sitting at bars to eat, so this was fine for me, but could potentially be awkward for a larger group.

We started with cocktails. I got the La Chunga (white rum, chicha morada, ginger, lime, saline), and my boyfriend got the Cumbia Cocktail (blanco tequila, quinoa-almond orgeat, lime, grilled pineapple, chuncho bitters, cinnamon). They were strong, but pretty tasty--not overly sweet. They also provide the Peruvian version of corn nuts to munch on while you wait for your main meal.

For food, I got the duck sausage (farro, butternut squash, cumin, beer, spinach), which was really delicious and had a bit of a spicy kick to it. My boyfriend got the Arctic char (Andean potatoes, cacao, peanuts, mustard greens). He said the fish was superb and was perfectly cooked. He also got the chicken thigh (fermented soybean, aji verde, potato chip), which was four bite-sized pieces of chicken on a skewer. He said this was excellent as well. Finally, we got the picarones and chancaca for dessert, which is basically fried dough with a syrupy sauce. Pretty good--hard to mess up fried dough, after all.

The menu doesn&#39;t state that it&#39;s a small plates concept, but I would say it&#39;s close to that. The size of the duck sausage dish was fine for me, but I wasn&#39;t overly hungry to begin with. My boyfriend ordered the chicken thigh after he finished his Arctic char because he was still hungry.

We both enjoyed the food quite a bit and would definitely go back."

Wow.
Food:
Talk scraping plates clean. Talk the most amazing small bites.
This is the type A kind of menu where if you don&#39;t know what something is on the menu, don&#39;t bother googling it, don&#39;t bother asking your server, because it will without a shadow of a doubt taste amazingly in your mouth.
The one key to this menu is understanding the portions - the menu is built around sharing small bites across your table, and take my word, I am not one to share, but I found myself feeding my companions shortly after having quivered and cried a little over the yum I just swallowed. Some smaller plates are a little hardier, others a little lighter, I recommend going through AT LEAST a combination of 4/5 small plates or you will experience some serious FOMO. The food has the two most important things down (in my humble opinion) balance &amp; texture.
For perspective, my two friends &amp; I shared the following:
Quinoa - if you were ever told you should toast/roast/saut√©e your quinoa before cooking it, these folks took it to heart, and the crunch, paired with the creaminess and acidity of the dish - let&#39;s just say I see the quinoa in my pantry very differently now.
Tuna tiradito - described as a sashimi japanese style ceviche. True to its description, it is beautiful, lucious, melt in your mouth raw tuna that is &#34;cooking&#34; in a bright acidic jus, with little bits of veggie crunch and more little creamy avocado cream bits. Once the tuna was gone, we poured the leftover ceviche jus over the quinoa. That&#39;s how good it all was.
Rock shrimp - don&#39;t be underwhelmed when you mostly see rice on this dish landing on the table. It has a subtle kick to it, which as a person who does not handle spice well, I very much appreciated, and you TASTE sooooo much seafood in every bite. This was a hardier course (as with the quinoa) but we scooped up every last grain. Yu. Mmy.
Pork shoulder - I am a meat girl. That is the way I grew up. I love fat. I loved seared fat. I love marinades. When it comes to all the things listed below - I fell in to a real &#34;I don&#39;t care what it is, I&#39;m just sad that it&#39;s going to be over.&#34; mode.
Lamb belly
Pork belly Anticucho
Beef heart Anticucho
Octopus Anticucho

I was so sad it was all coming to an end, that while I was considering dessert, and was still feeling peckish, I rallied one of my table friends to go in to two more savory plates with me.

And then came:
Corvina Ceviche - the ceviche which came recommended to me over the tuna (although the sashimi influence sold me on the first round) I love a true ceviche and come onnn this is a Peruvian restaurant, you have to be a little left side of what&#39;s-wrong-with-you to not parttake in ceviche here. It was classic, but the true cherry to this cake, were the plantain chips, delivering a lovely crispy sweet note to counter the glory of the acidic, lush fish dish.
Burrata - do you know cheese? Do you know mozzarella? Do you know buffalo milk? It doesn&#39;t matter. This is what you wish for every &#34;salad&#34; to be. It is a creamy, who knows what those toasted greens are, deeeeeelight.

Then we had dessert. Because GUESS WHAT we still had room.
And then followed:
Picarones - fritter style donut. You wish you had one of these with coffee every morning, believe me everyone would be a happier person if they did. They&#39;d be fat (perhaps), but happy.
Chocolate lucuma - its like a mousse au chocolat and a smashed oreo and corn flakes had a really beautiful triracial delicious lovechild. I don&#39;t care if that sounds racist, foodist(?). Have it.

Ok, now on to drinks.
I had a couple different ones. I&#39;ll be honest, I can&#39;t recall them on the menu anymore.
The first involved pineapple, it was crisp and delicious and a great way to open the meal with. The second, was rainbow colored, and even though it was gay pride and I am obnoxiously queer - it was nothing to write home about.
They have a beautifully stocked full bar, so in case of doubt, lean on the bottle name that is tried and true to you.

Venue. Whomever designed this place was smart af. It&#39;s large open corner street space, with a gorgeous open kitchen as a result. We sat at a table in front of the kitchen. If you&#39;re coming as 2 people, I recommend you sit directly in front of the kitchen because it is a sight for food hungry eyes. If I must point something out that ticked me off entirely, because I&#39;m that kind of restaurant OCD, the toilet paper rolls slip off the holders, so hold the roll in place! 

Service. You&#39;ll end up with someone different any time. So my small grain of salt is, you will NOT be ignored, however, you may find it lightly overbearing. We were asked how we found each course, one too many times (or more) but more as result of there being more than one person checking in.

I&#39;ll leave it at that. Eat in front of the kitchen, eat as much as you can spend on. Be delighted."

I had some errands to run in around Bedford station area and walked to the restaurant, that&#39;s only few minutes too but on a chilly day the distance is kinda harsh but the food makes up for it. 
I went with a friend, between the 2 we ordered 1 appetizer(lentil salad), 2 pork belly skewers and the beef entree. 
Everything was on point, super flavorful and filling. 
The drinks were great, the pisco sour was super frothy, creamy and strong. 

Although our server was great, he was a little preoccupied with a party in the corner so I had a little hard time finding him but  one of the hostess/server was super charming and helpful that all was good. She made the night even more giggly and fun.

First off, the restaurant doesn&#39;t really belong in Williamsburg it&#39;s more of a Tribeca vibe... but I guess that&#39;s the thing now in wburg (aka Lilia, MP, Antica Pesa). The service was good enough, but they didn&#39;t really give any additional information on the menu unless I asked. I think they&#39;re kind of missing an opportunity, especially with the piscos and the skewers. It wasn&#39;t really evident how much food we should be ordering for 2 people the way the menu is set up. 

The food was good - had the ceviche, quinoa, beet salad and duck sausage (4 dishes total for 2 people). The Duck sausage was pretty bland, this is the only dish i was disappointed in. But my biggest gripe about this place is the prices. Each &#34;small plate&#34; was between $15-20 for a less than sizeable portion. I just don&#39;t think we got our bang for our buck when we can go to a Michelin starred Meadowsweet down the road and spend the same amount and have delicious, fresh, decently portioned food. 

Sorry Llama! But I&#39;ll come back for rooftop cocktails in the summer."

The staff are above and beyond attentive and all seem passionate about the food and your experience. The d√©cor is very Brooklyn small trendy etc. The food was delicious and different. For starter we had the quinoa which was interesting the combo of banana and bacon giving a creamy and crunchy texture , the cashews were nice texture change while the avocado was lost completely. Next we had the anticucho pork belly a little salty, you definitely get the spicy on them,chicken thigh very flavorful and tender, and the octopus delicious well cooked and seasoned very much enjoyed would order again for sure. Next was the duck sausage which was good different for me but a welcomed surprise,spicy and fresh tasting the English peas were a welcomed veggie with the dish.  Last we had the beef tenderloin meat was tender and delicious the fries were fries and the scallion pancakes were very good more like crepes to make a taco of the tenderloin...the sauce it came in was on the salty side (like drink a glass of water salty) they even came and put rice over our sauce which was a welcomed surprise the cut the salty a bit. We did also get dessert the chanvaca which was nothing crazy, they were doughnuts in a molasses sauce,I wouldn&#39;t recommend them honestly. Over all there were 3 of us and this filled us but we weren&#39;t stuffed. The plates are extremely small for the price. We also ordered drinks all were tasty not very strong though.The sharing aspect was really nice and fun and the knowledge our waitress had was very helpful. There is a roof top it was raining but I&#39;d expect it to be nice. Overall great experience I&#39;d go back but I&#39;d probably go just for snacking."

The quinoa was incredible. A perfect blend of flavors that you never would think go together but were fantastic.
Scallops were perfectly cooked and you want a Bowl of the sauce to drink.
Special of day salt cod and king crab croquettes were nicely done but too salty in my opinion.
Lastly the pork shoulder came highly recommended by our well informed wait person Emily. Her choice was spot on! Again an eclectic grouping of flavors that you don&#39;t think go together, but you are pleasantly delighted by how wonderful it all tasted together.
We walked away completely satisfied but not feeling like we over ate.

Most of the staff seems like this is their first job in the restaurant industry. The hostess was friendly but there were multiple empty tables and she said it was a 45 minute to hour wait. We got on the list and left and about 15 minutes later we got a text for our table. We show up and one of the two hostesses gives our table to someone else, then they realize it and try to play it off - one of the hostesses then decides to forcibly move two patrons from one end of the bar to the other (no clue why, the women were basically laughing at her) then after another 20 minutes we finally get sat AT THE EMPTY TABLE WE POINTED OUT 45 minutes earlier. So yes it did take them 45 minutes to figure out how to sit us at an empty table.

The server was kind but forgot to ask us if we wanted drinks, then forgot to bring them for 20 minutes (it was NOT that busy). He just seemed frantic.

The food menu is WAY too small (so was the portion). There are lots of booze options but all wine options are slightly too expensive for this sort of place. It&#39;s not fancy enough for the liquor prices - especially with a soundtrack of smashing pumpkins and joy division playing. Also those artists just don&#39;t say &#34;Peruvian comfort food&#34; to me. 

Finally - above all. They only sell a whole chicken for $40!!! So you better go really hungry. Peruvians are sort of known for their chicken and I doubt this gets ordered much as it&#39;s not a restaurant set up for groups with most of the seating being bar style. Poor choice. You might want to add a $20 half chicken really fast, guys. 

Basically feels like a place that thinks a bit more highly of itself than it really should."

You can&#39;t really taste any lucuma, but th ice cream itself is great?
Th strawberry one has this really good syrupy jus.... I could eat two of these and ten picarones.
Th roast chicken is fantastic. Th chicken itself is moist and perfect, Th potatoes are wedged and crispy golden brown. There are three sauces. Th green one is th way to go. 
Pork shoulder was ok.... Maybe too acidic
Anticuchos are good, if u had to choose go for th chicken and octopus. Th belly is meh and th beef heart is ok. Not ur true street vendor limean anticucho flave. 
Tiradito was my favourite in comparison to th corvina ceviche. Ceviche is good too. But between th two - tuna tiradito is better...also this yuzu addition- is that a new kick amongst all ceviche recipes!?! It&#39;s great. Good work."

It&#39;s got a hip, fun atmosphere and the food is creative in theory though ultimately missed the mark. 

Drinks: Stick to cocktails, as the wine list is mediocre and our bottle was served in short, old-fashioned-esque glasses without stems, a huge peeve of mine!

Food: I recommend ordering tons of small plates instead of going for the entrees. We found the quinoa and ceviche dishes too acidic. The stir fry beef with scallion pancakes was OK - beef was tender but the fries on top were compete mush. Honestly, the favorite part of our meal was the coconut sorbet with grapefruit.

If you have a problem with any of the 4 things I listed, then you&#39;ll come out of the restaurant thinking, &#34;The food was good, yea, but honestly it was pricey and I don&#39;t know...

I promise you, and this comes without a grain of unnecessary hyperbole, that Llama Inn brought me the worst dining experience I&#39;ve ever known in NYC.

*First off: Wait TIme*
We showed up for our reservation on time. We were told it might be a few minutes before our table was ready, and that we should go and wait by the bar. &#34;A few minutes&#34; ended up being about an hour and twenty. While we were waiting, water began to leak from the ceiling on us. I told the hostess and she said &#34;these are just the kinds of problems that you find in new restaurants.&#34; We should have left then, but alas: we made the mistake of exercising patience.

*The Ambience*
LOUD. REALLY REALLY LOUD.

*The Food*
After our hour-plus wait, we were seated and given menus. We made our selections but, when the waitress came by, we were told that almost every item we&#39;d chosen was sold out. Nobody had thought to tell us that any sooner.

We found other food and ordered it. It was fine. The ceviche is great, the salads are okay. The drinks are okay, but expensive for what they are.

*The Conclusion*
After we left, one of my dining companions said &#34;you couldn&#39;t pay me to go back there.&#34; I agree. When all was said and done, this was waste of money and a waste of time. They&#39;ve got some stuff to figure out, for sure."

I came here recently with two friends who were biking something crazy like 50 miles and this was their halfway point. Obviously I did no exercise that day except walking from Llama Inn to the Brooklyn Barge after, but because they were starving I got to enjoy lots of the menu. Llama Inn recommends that you get a bunch of things to split, so we went with the ceviche (amazing), beef tenderloin stir-fry (ditto) with an egg, the omelet with spicy sausage (really good) and a side of hash browns. For three people, two athletes and one fan of eating, this was a perfect amount of food. I never really like cocktails (strong preference for wine) but I was curious about the Coffee Buzz (montenegro, cold brew coffee, orange wheel) so went with it. It was pretty good but I found myself wishing I&#39;d just went with sparking ros√© instead - lesson to remember for the future. If you&#39;re craving pancakes, bacon and/or eggs skip Llama Inn for brunch, but if sharing Peruvian food with some great breakfast cocktails sounds up your ally, you&#39;ll have a great time. Bonus - they have an awesome roof. It was too hot to try out on this visit but seems like it&#39;d be a great spot to enjoy happy hour (and a view of the BQE)."

Food is amazing (exceeded our expectations!); textures, flavors, innovation, and execution is top notch.  Service is on point - attentive, helpful, not pushy; they even left a note and comments to wish us a happy anniversary.  Pricing is to be expected for the area.  The only thing that could have been better is that it gets noisy (and this is more of a biased preference) quickly (but do note that it was fairly empty at 630 on a Weds night).

The food was fantastic and service was very efficient. We arrived 30 minutes early and were seated right away, at the chef&#39;s counter. If you like to watch your food being made, it is a fun experience and you get to hear all the orders being called out. It is a little warm since you are in the kitchen so don&#39;t sit hear if you are prone to getting hot. 

That said, the food was innovative and exciting, each dish with its own unique and flavorful sauce. I highly recommend the lamb belly (the meat was like butter), the pork belly anticucho, the heirloom tomato salad (sounds boring but it was fresh, with a nice balance of sweet, salty, and crunchy), and the sea bream tiradito (swimming in the most delicious sweet/sour fruit sauce). We lapped up all the sauce once the fish was gone.

The only dish that I was not crazy about was the duck sausage with rice. The rice had more flavor than the sausage so if you are looking for just a good bowl of rice for $20+, this is the dish for you.

Overall, this was an amazing dinner with new and interesting flavors. Definitely worth checking out."

My boyfriend and I showed up 45 minutes early for our reservation, hoping we could get seated earlier but also happy to have some drinks at the bar.  He checked in for us when he got there, and when I arrived a few minutes later, I checked in again. The hostess seemed spacey and overwhelmed (because her boss came to talk to her while I was checking in) so my boyfriend checked in with the hostess for a 3rd time about 20 minutes before our reservation. About half an hour later, I checked in for the 4th time to ask when we would be seated, and the hostess pointed to a counter by the window (which had been empty the entire time we had been waiting for a table) and told me that they had us sitting at the counter. I&#39;m not sure why she didn&#39;t tell us either during our 3 prior attempts to check in or after our reservation time had passed that we could be seated at the counter, but either way, I told her we wanted a table, and she offered to talk to her manager. About 10 minutes later, the manager (who had been talking to the hostess when I first checked in upon arrival) told us that she had only become aware that we had arrived about 10 minutes ago, because &#34;understandably, the hostess was overwhelmed&#34; and had not realized that we were checking in when we checked in 3 times. She offered to give us a table that was on dessert in 25 minutes. No offer to comp anything, no offer for free appetizers while we waited. Barely an apology. She acted like it was the most obvious thing in the world that a restaurant patron should have to check in 4 times in order for the hostess to realize that the diners have arrived.  We asked to sit at the bar facing the kitchen and we had to ask for our drinks to be comped (in the end, they only comped one round).

Once we were seated, the experience improved. Our waitress was nice and attentive, the bus boys were friendly and on top of filling our water glasses and constantly changing out our plates and flatware (beautiful plates), and the food was delicious.   

The pork belly and head on shrimp were straightforward and great. The black lentils with mushrooms, kale and poached egg were delicious - the kale was seasoned perfectly, the mushrooms were flavorful, but the egg was overcooked and (tragically) didn&#39;t run.  The red snapper tiradito was one of my favorite first bites, and the corvino ceviche was actually heartier than most ceviche dishes I have had (I&#39;m not sure why other complain about it being too small).  The arctic char was also great but the accompaniments were the stars of that dish, the goat neck was my other favorite bite (a lot of flavors that fit perfectly together) and the pork shoulder was also a delight. 

If not for the front of the house experience, I would have raved about this restaurant. It&#39;s normal that restaurants have trouble in their first few months and right after a New York Times review attracts many more diners than they had been having in previous weeks, but every part of the restaurant was working perfectly aside from the front of the house, and I have seen other reviews echoing this sentiment. I hope someone listens and makes a change."

The food went from innovative to pretentious. We ordered beef heart, octopus, beer salad, and scallops as the main to share. First up was the beef heart, two pieces, drowned in mayo and spicy sauce and unrecognizable in taste. The beet salad was divine. When we asked for the octopus dish we learned that the mayo piece on the same (!) plate as the beef heart was it. The waiter turned around and made a face, not only bad dish but also bad attitude. Two (!) scallops were offered as main dish, cooked to perfection but with another creamy sauce. Boring and over priced. Time to move on."

I have been to Peruvian restaurants all over the city (and in Peru) so this is based on the fact that this is -contemporary- Peruvian food with a Brooklyn flair and I will not compare this to traditional Peruvian cooking.

Food: We ordered the ceviche corvina and all 4 anticuchos to start (pork belly, chicken thigh, beef heart, and octopus). The leche de tigre (tigers milk) for the ceviche was excellent and I enjoyed the plantains and bananas added in, the fish was marinaded perfectly. Out of the skewers, I enjoyed the beef heart and pork belly the most. For dinner, we ordered the lomo saltado (&#34;beef tenderloin stir fry&#34; on the menu) to share. The fries, tomatoes, onions were all perfectly marinaded in the soy sauce/vinegar sauce. The beef was very tender. On top they had a rocoto crema which was very tasty and even gave a small bottle in case you wanted to add more... which of course I did. :) The plate came with scallion pancakes which were DELICIOUS and we used those to wrap the food in. A waitress came by with white rice to put on our plate when we were about halfway done to sop up the rest of the juices in the lomo saltado. AMAZING. 

Drinks: Inca Kola shouldn&#39;t be $4 but it&#39;s NY so I&#39;ll let that slide. I ordered the Flying Purple Pisco drink... it was DELICIOUS. It was a twist on the traditional pisco sour, and I really enjoyed it.

Dessert: We ordered the lucuma ice cream dessert. Very good!

Service: I wish I got the name of our server but I know he was Dominican. Nice, funny guy and prompt service. Thank you!

Only reason I give this place 4 stars is because we were burning up and it was uncomfortably hot... makes it hard to fully enjoy the meal. However, it was one of the hottest days of summer but the AC definitely could have been turned up more? Other than that, the food/drinks/service were all 5 stars."

We sat at the front bar because we didn&#39;t have reservations but that was definitely ok with us.  We weren&#39;t too hungry so we decided to share the black lentils and the pork belly anticucho.  Wanted 1 more dish and looked to yelp to help us pick.  We saw pictures of what looked like French fries so when we asked our waiter about it he mentioned that it was the beef tenderloin dish which we ordered too.

When the pork belly came out, we loved it so much we ordered the beef heart, and after the beef heart came out, we loved that so much, we ordered the shrimp and chicken thigh anticuchos.  So much for not being too hungry.  They were all delicious but my fave was the pork belly.  

The black lentils were a great starter although next time WHEN I go back, I&#39;ll try one of the other dishes.  

The beef tenderloin.. wow... that was amazing!  It comes with scallion pancakes that you can make mini tacos with and they give you fresh cut avocado, peppers, and a little thing of sauce.  Delicious!  I&#39;ll definitely be coming back for you!

I went almost a month ago when they had just opened so I think they were still in the process of figuring out how much inventory they needed as they were out of a lot of dishes. There was also only one server who worked the entire dining room so service was a little slow. Lastly would definitely not order the wine even if they are running a special because the market value of most of their bottles are less than $20. Overall an enjoyable meal, I would definitely come back once they have everything up and running seamlessly."

Yeah, I&#39;m that trashy guy that asked for my food to go, but only because this food was the absolute bomb. My wife and I had heard rumors but tonight we decided we would go all the way. Sweet Jesus was it incredible. The service was terrific. Both server and bartenders were great. Especially Dan, Spencer, and Kasia. The food was to die for. If they had offered me a choice of my favorite entree and leaving my wife, I would have had to leave my wife and I know she would have done the same to me. I feel bad but not as bad as passing up a dish of perfection. Some standouts were the beef heart and the ceviche and banana dish (such an odd sounding pairing but so good). All of the food is incredible. And I cannot wait to come back. But for now, at 6:30am, I will settle for my leftovers and dream of a night where I can revisit the Llama Inn."

This past Saturday we were finally able to sneak in and go! It was certainly packed around 10pm but we were able to grab a nice cozy table in the corner. Our waitress was extremely sweet and helpful with giving recommendations and quickly serving both our drinks and food. Here&#39;s the rundown of what we ordered:

Around the world (ANTICUCHO): Shrimp, beef heart, chicken thighs and pork belly - shrimp and chicken thighs for the win. Cooked extremely well, tender and tasteful. The beef heart was good, but not a taste and chewiness that we have an acquired taste for. The pork belly was sadly a little overcooked but still tasted yummy.

We also had the quinoa and pork shoulder - both were absolutely delish, fresh, well cooked and flavorful.

We hear that the fish there is supposed to be really good too, so we will certainly be returning to try the whole menu!"

We went on a rainy night and it seemed sort of empty. I was worried. How good could this place be? We started with cocktails, I had a Tia Julia and he had a Cumbia cocktail. Then we shared the beet salad. It was terrific with lovely crunchy Peruvian corn. It caused food envy in the people seated next to us. Then we had  chicken and beef anticuchos. The food was beautifully prepared and showed evidence of some amazing knife skills. We  had the duck sausage with spinach, rice and butternut squash and pork with yoghurt sauce. Amazing flavors and textures. I got some red wine by the glass that complimented the food beautifully. We shared the chocolate dessert. The flavors  of the food are unusual and difficult to describe but oh so satisfying. There were some rough edges in the service but the food more than made up for it."

Because of the size of the group, they required that we do a prix fixe menu with the dishes served family style. I was a little concerned about this--my friends are restaurant owners themselves (of places you&#39;ve heard of) and thought they might want to order a la carte. In the event, it was a fantastic arrangement--the cocktail (a kind of mulled sangria with a garnish of  frozen grapes on toothpicks) and each of the courses were all superb. Particular standouts were the skewers; the Arctic char; the quinoa; and the Lomo Saltado (disco fries)--wow. Not having to order was actually awesome--more time and attention to just hanging out. Service was friendly and competent. Vibe is strong. Actual art on the walls--loved the gnarled multi-colored rope sculpture. Everyone else loved the place too.

One final point, Llama Inn, ignore that silly douchebag JJ who just left a 1 star review. What a new Williamsburg clown.

My parents, boyfriend and I arrived on time for our reservation and were seated at one of the awkward high tables with stools, in spite of the empty booth by the window, directly behind us.  When my mother asked the hostess if we could be seated there instead, she was told there was a 5 top being seated there. Ok, understandable. 30 minutes later, a group of FOUR were seated at the booth. And we had to stare at them throughout our meal. Are my parents too old to be seated where some passersby might see them? My dad brought this up with the hostess after our meal and she was defensive and dismissive. We won&#39;t be back (DUH)"

I sat at the kitchen counter and loved watching the chefs work.

Ceviche - get both of them. The house ceviche is perfectly acidic and citrusy. Great morsels and fish with perfectly shaved onions. Persimmon tiradito was great too - juicy, slightly sweet, and soothing.

Skewers - get them all. Pork belly had an Asian twist, pr deft fat to meat ratio. Beef heart was steaky and topped with a sweat tomato relish. Jumbo prawn was like a small lobster covered in a great cajuny rub

Beet salad - extremely fresh. Great pairing with goat cheese

Pork shoulder - not what I expected. More like small pork chunks in sauce

Chicken - if you are not alone, get it!! Juicy, great skin, awesome sauces

Seated at the bar with delightful cocktails - the La Chunga is touted as their version of a Dark and Stormy, but it&#39;s head and shoulders above such routine fare. Highly recommended.

First, I&#39;d like to say that the food was amazing! I ordered the crispy pork shoulder sandwich and my friend ordered the chicken thigh sandwich. We also got a Pisco sour each and the yuca bread.
As a Peruvian native I was impressed with how well put together the food was and how the chef put a modern twist to the Peruvian cuisine.

Bad:
My friend and I were there for brunch, we arrived at 1 and the hostess gave us the option to sit at the bar since there were  no tables available, which was fine with us... However it took the bartender a good 12 minutes to give us a menu, she didn&#39;t even look at us to at least say that it would be a few minutes, I actually had to say something to her first for her to tell us to give her time. No matter how busy you are, the first thing you should do as a server/bartender is greet the customer and hand us the menu at least... In that amount of time we could&#39;ve read through the menu well enough and been able to place our order. Thankfully after we placed our order the food didn&#39;t take too long. Another thing is that while we were eating, a woman sat next to us at the bar and the same thing happened to her, except she walked off after not being acknowledged the entire time she was there, to be honest I would&#39;ve done the same but i drove over an hour for this place since I had read such good reviews. 

Overall I will give this place a second chance and come back because the food truly is that good. I do recommend having more attentive staff or maybe more bartenders at the bar, because that bartender looked overwhelmed the entire time.... Had it not been for the lack of attentiveness I would&#39;ve given this place 5 stars."

We moved into the neighborhood a few months ago and a friend had recommended Le Paddock for my birthday. We got right in, no wait, and had a great table near a window. Every person who waited on us was friendly, helpful and informative, and I liked that there were several of them who would stop by to check on us - didn&#39;t seem like anyone had &#34;their&#34; section, but that the whole restaurant was everyone&#39;s section. 

And the food! The bread is amazing. Every course, and we had them all, was amazing. The beer and wine were both terrific and I was really happy with the depth and breadth of the drinks list - I&#39;d love to try some cocktails there. We had the buffalo cauliflower and baked manchego - both really lovely twists on some restaurant standards, and I would happily order both again. I&#39;d seen the mussels on the menu online before I got there, had my heart set on them, and was not disappointed. The white wine and garlic sauce and the delicious fries really made the meal. My boyfriend had a gruyere, bacon and leek pizza that was perfectly balanced flavor-wise. For dessert we had a strawberry rhubarb crumble. I&#39;m picky about desserts because I don&#39;t have much of a sweet tooth, but this was so tart and really made the most of the seasonal fruits. 

And this is the part where I praise the service again, because everyone was just so nice and helpful. 

Thanks for making a special night even more special, Le Paddock. You&#39;ve earned yourself two new customers for as long as we&#39;re all here."

Kale was so overcooked It had the consistency of frozen spinach.  The lentils were in a very acidic type dressing similar to what capers out of the jar taste like.  The salmon did not have a crust, more like a dusting of bread crumbs.  It was mushy.  I was expected a crust.  This meal was just ok and not worth $21 in a local neighborhood restaurant.

The desert, however, unlike the meal was superb.

First, the service is perfunctory.  Not necessarily slow or outright rude, but barely there -- like a not-so-terrible diner.  No one asked how the meal was or whether we needed anything.  Considering the entree prices ($25 tuna special), someone should have. 

Second, the din is unpleasant.  It&#39;s one thing to foster a convivial bistro atmosphere, but why blast pop music?  Seems like it was Super Hits From The 70s night, so I got to hear Theme from Shaft and two Melanie songs... loud.

Third, maybe they&#39;re rushed or need a little help.  The soup du jour was quite good, but it came with a little piece of plastic floating in it.  

If the environment,  service and attention to detail were better,  we might have stayed for dessert or another drink or considered returning sometime soon."

I was here for a birthday in October, and got a pizza margherita, and it was terrible. The thin pizza crust was soft as soaked pita bread and the cheese wasn&#39;t great; you know there&#39;s a problem when the best part of a pizza is the sauce.
Fast forward to another friend&#39;s birthday party this past Saturday - a completely different experience. I usually use the pizza margherita as my standard to assess a place&#39;s pizza quality, but there are so many good reviews for their pizzas that I decided to ignore my reservations and try the Mediterranean pizza; some places do a much better job on pizzas with toppings than without. And happily, Le Paddock is one of them! This pizza was much better than that of my first visit; the roasted tomatoes and goat cheese were delicious and they didn&#39;t go too heavy on the caramelized onions. The crust was still softer than it should have been, and the olives were the canned, pitted kind, but it was still very tasty overall. Also, this time I got to try a few of the appetizers, and the standout was definitely the Flash-Fried Brussels Sprouts. The Smoked Eggplant puree was all right, though a bit bland, and the Salmorejo dip and the La Padduck were both popular with the rest of the party, though I didn&#39;t try it myself. On the wine, I got their house Cote du Rhone; I&#39;ve never seen one as a house wine, so I figured it might not be a great one, but a Cote du Rhone is a Cote du Rhone, right? It actually tasted a lot more like a jammy Merlot. 
Though the food can be a little hit or miss (more hit than miss it seems), I really gave Le Paddock the fourth star for the service. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating for both birthday parties, and both were on Saturday nights too, so I have to give them props for that. If you&#39;re having a party for 10-14 and are looking for a nice but casual restaurant with good food, reasonable prices and a candle-lit ambiance, this is a great option."

They have recently added music which makes it all the more intense. It&#39;s a great place to bring kids and they are always very helpful. I just wish you could press mute. You have to scream to hear each other at times. Makes for a not so lovely meal... But, it is local and the food is consistently good."

I tried a bite of my friends eggs Benedict and I can&#39;t believe how flavorful and perfect it is. My pizza is dope. Like the drug dope because I&#39;m addicted. This place is magic.

Our waiter did not once look anyone at our table in the eye.  NONE of the staff thanked us once or was polite in any way while we went out of our way to thank them for taking our order, bring us our food or drinks and when I paid.
I guess they are too busy stroking their beards and posing with their thick rimmed glasses (most likely not prescription) to be attentive and polite.  

Food was nice.  The burger I ate was cooked really well, which is for some reason hard to do for most places and my wife and friends really liked their food. 

Pretty darn pricey to be treated so poorly by lame cookie cutter hipsters.
I will never go back."

We strolled in without a reservation at 6:30PM and were promptly seated at the bar, and it was a fantastic experience beginning to end. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Modern Cocktail, which was delicious; we split the crabcake as an app. His pork loin was tender and delicious, and my roast free-range chicken was to DIE for - the portions were quite large, and the accompanying vegetables (brussels sprouts for me and cauliflower for him) were cooked to perfection.

Service at the bar was excellent and the bartender was attentive and on the ball, even on such a crazy night for food service. Props to him.

We&#39;ll definitely be back, considering that we&#39;re right in the neighborhood."

It is not just a place I like because it is close to home; all of their food is great, and I feel so at home when I am there.

First of all, they have a small bar that always seems to have at least one seat, and I am always made to feel welcome by either of the bartenders or owners.  I also sit outside often, because I often walk my dog in the area - where, in the summer months, someone comes out with water for Rosie, my dog, as well.

Every week, on Tuesday, they have a &#34;muscle&#34; night.  In actuality, they have specials on Mondays through Thursdays, where they charge only $15.00 for a dinner, glass of wine and salad.  I particularly like the muscles, though, because it comes with either a cream sauce, red wince sauce, another sauce with chorizo - and even another sauce that I can&#39;t even remember.

I have also had several different dinners.  When I want to be healthy, and order a salad, they give lots of veggies with either their &#34;Le Pddock&#34; salad (which is served with duck confit), and otherwise, which is served with some type of goat cheese, almonds, or some other ingredients that might combine both.  

They have great dinners - including their crusted salmon, lamb dishes, chicken, and other.  They have great brunches - including, this morning, a quiche with salmon.  I have had Eggs Benedict, with lamb sausage - but also so many other great dishes.

my law office held its Christmas party here - as one of the partners, I wanted to show off both Brooklyn and my neighborhood generally.  Many of my guests ate their oysters (which I have had often), as well as escargot, .pizza, and several other items which were particularly French.  They too were enamored both by the ambiance, and the way the food was prepared.

I strongly recommend this place, and suggest that it will be referred to ffavorably for years to come by critics!"

Today will be my last day coming here. The service was pure shit! I asked for a coffee and ordered my meal. Coffee never came.. Waited 15 minutes. I had to actually get up and remind the server that we are still waiting for our coffee. That was one..... Next I ordered my eggs over easy, when they arrived they were poached. Another fuck up. My wife was half way done with her meal which they also screwed up. She asked for her eggs over hard and got them over easy. I finally get my food, potatoes were cold and ive been sitting here again with an empty cup of coffee.... Where is my refill or an attempt to ask if everything is ok? This was the last straw. I was ready to walk out before I even took a bit of my food. Soo done with this place. If I want shit service ill go to Mc donalds. This place charges an average of $15/meal.

I don&#39;t eat shellfish, but a lot of people there seem to love the oysters, which are a good price. Nice atmosphere as well. Some reviews said the waiters were rude, we&#39;ve been there several times and never had a bad experience. They are French, so it adds to the charm.  The prices are a little high, but it&#39;s worth it for the quality of the experience. People going on and on about cash only.

The mussels were excellent, fresh plump and nicely seasoned with white wine and shallots.  The flammekueche was generously adorned with leeks, bacon and Gruyere.  I would have requested it stay in the oven another minute or so to caramelize the bacon and other toppings.  We would eat there again if in the area."

Since it&#39;s not on or near  the main street,  you gotta really want to come here to dine which many folks do (It&#39;s always packed). 

The place is very casual but with a homey feel. Their brunch menu features great specials. They have  a good wood burning oven presenting with great pizza dishes. We&#39;ve ordered the Harvest  pizza made with kale, bacon, feta, red onions, chili flakes. Eggs Benedict was also a good dish. 

For dinner, I&#39;ve had the steamed mussels in garlic sauce and fries. The mussels were very fresh and came in a good portion.  My husband had the baby spinach salad with chorizo and the tomato soup special. We were satisfied from both of our dishes. And most of the meals we saw on other tables looked equally delicious.

Dinner and brunch. Both extreme disappointments. Lamb burger for dinner was so bland and boring that I could not even fathom how something so flavorful like lamb can be turned out to this. 

Brunch bacon and eggs was dismal. Honestly. I got one burnt strip of bacon. Not even kidding or exaggerating. One charred strip. 

Iced coffee was hilarious too. Poured a tiny big of milk to it and it turned out white. Cause there was no coffee in it. 

Service is not the best if its busy. Forgot my milk for the coffee. Took ages to get it. Check was slammed on the table mid meal. 

Just do not understand how they are so busy. Sure there&#39;s not much options in the immediate neighborhood but the quality of le paddock is unacceptably poor to me.

EDIT: walked past these guys and saw the sanitary B that I&#39;ve missed previously. NOT a pleasant read on the restaurant inspection dot nyc dot gov site. LIVE ROACHES PRESENT. Ouch. EVIDENCE OF MICE. Double ouch."

Having just moved to the neighborhood, the hubby and I wanted to celebrate my new job at a night out in the middle of the week. Unfortunately, after a few hours after the meal the celebration ended abruptly with food poisoning. I reached out to 311 but they closed the case since they say anything could have caused my food poisoning from the morning of or even two days prior to my incident. I will never know but between the pizza and mussels, I must say the mussels were probably the culprit. It was the day before the mussels night special so I could have eaten the older, last batch."

I dont really eat French much so when i heard of this place i was super excited to come down to try it. I called and said they dont take reservations so I was hoping there wasnt a long wait. It was super packed when we arrived but Luckily we only waited about 10 minutes for a seat.  The place is some what small. Its a corner restaurant with a small bar to the back. Big beautiful rounded windows, wood floors, the ambience transports you to a different place. Its just amazing. 

We checked out the menu and decided on the tapas we ordered the grilled artichokes, hummus, and deviled eggs all were delicious. Artichoke perfectly prepared not chewy very tender. Hummus was tasty and the bread was nice and warm. Deviled eggs were great nice and creamy and delicious.!Except i think they should have had one more on each plate. 

For dinner i had the skirt steak and he had the scallops with risotto. The steak was delicious perfectly prepared the potatoes were unbelievable, creamy like a scalloped potato, string beans very tender. The scallops were cooked perfectly and risotto was seasoned and cooked great but the big complaint there was practically nothing on the dish. There was four small scallops and a small portion of risotto no bueno!! Not for the price your charging..  Very disappointing!! 

We ordered a banana tartin with whip cream which was the best dessert i have eaten in a while just delicious.   No overly sweet or mushy just perfect it was wrapped in Filo dough. 

This place is just amazing but It needs to give out bigger portions on certain plates for the price they are charging."

The space itself is pretty nice, and the staff weren&#39;t trying to rush us, though it was 9:30 on a Monday night so it was pretty empty. My boy said he thought the waiter who greeted us was unfriendly, but the waitress was friendly and helpful. It seemed like she was pretty new, as she didn&#39;t know the menu that well, and made a few rookie mistakes, like forgetting to give us cutlery, but it wasn&#39;t anything serious. 

The food wasn&#39;t that good. I had the arugula and roasted apple salad to start, which was the best part of the meal. The onion soup looked gross, but he said it was good. The skirt steak was cooked as I asked, medium, but despite being still bloody, was really tough. The beans were delicious and fresh and cooked perfectly. The gratin dauphinois was awful. The pork chop was tough and under-seasoned but the sides were good. If they bought better meat it would improve this place 100%.

The dessert was a lemon pot de creme. This is gunna sound weird, but it was too big. It also wasn&#39;t very lemony. It said it came with fruit compote, but it was more like a swirl of raspberry jam. It should be smaller with a more intense flavour. 

The house wine is cheap and nasty. Don&#39;t get it. 

Other people were having pizza, which looked good. If I lived in that part of Brooklyn I&#39;d go back here, but I&#39;d avoid the meat and anything trying to be French, which is a shame, because it&#39;s meant to be a French restaurant."

Almost everything we had seemed to be thrown together without much thought or effort. We were there last night, which is $1 oyster night. The two sauces served with the oysters were both lacking and kind of ruined the oyster experience. The cocktail sauce didn&#39;t have enough horseradish or lemon and tasted way too much like ketchup. The mignonette seemed to be just vinegar with a few pieces of shallot thrown in.

My entree was the mussels special: spicy coconut milk and cilantro. This was so watery and flavorless, it was almost unbelievable. 

My boyfriend had the pork chop with asparagus, which were both overcooked and disappointing.

For dessert, I tried the lemon pot de creme. Wow. It tasted like lemon flavored cool whip. Horrible. 

To be fair, there were a few highlights: the french fries, the bread and butter and the almond peach cake. All really excellent.

I guess it&#39;s busy and popular because there aren&#39;t many options in that hood, but if I were those people I&#39;d spend my money at Brooklyn Commune which has infinitely better food."

But I was more impressed with the decor than the cuisine. Granted I tried the steak rather than the duck special, my faux pas. The steak was decent, but just that. Something I could concoct in my own kitchen for less money. This year it&#39;s about the need to dine out experience. So I&#39;ll cook more, and frequent places that can do it better. 

I did get a taste of the duck. Yeah, go for that if you get a chance. But it&#39;s the old world transportation that really draws you in, especially at night. Very romantic. Also considering the establishment isn&#39;t large enough for the varied conversation levels to get obnoxious. Maybe a 3.5."

I was searching last minute for a relaxed environment where I could gather a group of 15, friends and their SO, to quietly ring in hitting the big 30. Most places require a contract, rental fee, and pre fixe menus. When I called Le Paddock they were very open and welcoming. I spoke with Sylvie on the phone several times but was still worried about how things would go day-of. My worries were unfounded. On a rainy night Le Paddock was a cozy place to gather, friends tell me my table was clear and reserved at least a half hour before I arrived. Although two separate tables were set up we decided to be ambitious and cram 15 of us into the 11 seater. 
I forgot to warn the restaurant that I would be bringing cake and it was refrigerated and then presented with no questions asked. A few hours prior to our 9pm dinner I called and ordered appetizers for the table, they came out as soon as about half of us arrived; La Padduck salad, grilled manchego, eggplant dip, and Brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious. A server was always available to take drinks orders from us and answer any questions. They were really very gracious. It was not a long wait at all for main dishes to be ordered and come out, furthermore everything came out well timed so we all ate together. I had the chicken, and just had the rest of the leftovers for a dinner for 2 (BIG). My SO had the lamb burger which he was very happy with. I noticed a few other orders included the mussels and a pizza (which they make in a wood fired oven). Everyone cleaned their plates. 
I was really happy with my time at Le Paddock, I&#39;ll be happy to return for a casual date night."

Ordered the Shishito peppers, Escargot, Fries with Parmesan to start. Dishes were perfectly sized and all were very good. Shishito peppers had a kind of red, but not hot sauce on them. They don&#39;t need it, but were tasty nonetheless. I haven&#39;t had escargot in some time and this was one of the more well prepared dishes I&#39;ve had. Not too oily or over garlicky, just right. Fries with Parmesan were perfect, delicious, crispy and tasty. 
Shared the Flammenkeuch bacon &amp; leek pizza. Crust was great, crispy but soft, toppings were abundant and an excellent combination. Will definitely try again."

It delivered a friendly, comfy bistro experience. The decor was warm and rustic (check out the antler chandelier in the center of the room). Since the weather had been cold (it snowed two days earlier) and my California bones were getting frozen, the potato leek soup was perfect for me--no cream or milk, but smooth and deliciously balanced flavors. Followed it with the Le Padduck salad, which was an adventurous combination of roasted duck, nuts, blue chees, fresh greens and I-can&#39;t-remember but again a good choice. My daughter&#39;s choice--mussels--came with pommes frites which were EXCELLET.

As others have noted, the downside is that it is a cash only establishment, and has been said before, who carries cash anymore?

But for friendly bistro dining--I&#39;m looking forward to visiting again when I&#39;m in New York."

I had lunch here while on a getaway to NYC on a beautiful, sunny weekday. The outdoor dining area was pleasant and my server, Gregory, was attentive. I asked him to help me decide between the croque monsieur and the roast chicken (which was part of the prix fixe lunch menu) and he seemed a bit torn, then suggested the chicken. 

For $10.95 you get an appetizer and choice of entree from the special lunch menu; bread and butter is also served with your meal (yes!). I opted for the deviled eggs, which arrived as an order of 3 egg halves on a bed of baby greens. Then came my main dish: 1/4 roast chicken with mashed potatoes and spinach, with a delicious gravy circumnavigating the plate. The chicken was amazing, with evidence of fresh spices: rosemary leaves, parsley, even a lemon seed. I&#39;m delighted to say it fell off the bone, and I savored every bite. I also enjoyed a glass of cotes du rhone.

I was hoping to also enjoy a creme brulee, but was stuffed, so I&#39;ll have to save dessert for my next visit. If I lived in Windsor Terrace, this would be my date-night go-to for sure.

A lot of reviews complain about it being cash only, but... That happens a lot in New York. Keep an emergency c-note in your wallet, folks."

First of all, the cash only thing is terrible. The principle of that really bugs me. At best it&#39;s pennywise and pound foolish to save on the few percent it costs to give customers the convenience of paying by card, at worst they&#39;re fersure avoiding paying income taxes. Even worse, though, is that these guys aren&#39;t good enough to dictate from on high how their customers shall pay. If they were in a more competitive neighborhood, they would not be nearly as busy. 

The service was super slow, and performed with classic French indolence. At one point, a busboy plonked an eaten plate of oysters on our table when he was picking up our appetizer dishes. Gross. The French onion soup was smelly, and my skirt steak was really under seasoned and tough. Overall the food was substandard, especially for the price. 

I&#39;d give it 3 but I am so so fed up with cash only. Unless you&#39;re a dive bar it should be illegal."

The food here is great and the custom cocktails are amazing. I recommend the drink called the Canuck. The pork chop is great and the oysters on a half shell are very fresh.

Does every new restaurant have a wood fired oven these days?  There is much to love about Le Paddock starting with the menu.........it is extensive, and has alot of value........a winner!..

For dinner..start off with house baked bread and butter.......I was looking at the dark spots on the bread and inquired if the hearth oven bakes the bread indeed it does.  Chewey with a liitle salt- it is phenomenal.

Ate:
Wood fired salmon with ratttatoule $16
Potatoes Daphinois- $5

The presentation of food here is plain and unremarkable, but the food speaks volumes.  The salmon comes skin side up.....so tender from the wood oven and the rattatouile is sooooo authentically flavored.  Potatoes are classic, thin sliced and cheesey.  My one mistake was an overdose of delicious bread so no room for dessert."

You can tell the owners really took some real care in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the handcrafted lights made out of metal steamers to the carefully selected meats and cheeses in the charcuterie section (you have to try the Chicken Liver Mousse and the Pipe Dream Buche Ash!).

The restaurant used to be an Italian restaurant and has a wood burning oven.  They take good advantage of this by offering a variety of pizzas.  In addition to the pizza, they make fresh baked bread that made me pity those people on low-carb diets -- crusty and a little salty on the outside and oh-so-fluffy and sweet on the inside.  This bread in addition to the Moules Frites (mouclade style -- owner&#39;s recipe with curry, cream, white wine...and do I detect some saffron?) is nomnomnom-enducing.

Dessert was the Tarte Tatin which was also baked in the oven and had a lovely caramely smokey taste.  Eaten a la mode and even my already exploding insides couldn&#39;t complain.

Service: We were seated fairly quickly, but that was the only time anything happened quickly. After we were given menus, the waiter completely ignored our table for at least 20 minutes, catering mostly to the tables outside. To be fair, he was one of two waiters and the other one was new and really slow. After a significant amount of stare downs, the owner came up to us and took our order. We were not informed of the specials, just that they were out of scones. 

Drinks: the coffee was just OK, slightly burnt, the mimosas and orange juice were pretty good. 

Food: I ordered the Ranchero Pizza and the bf ordered baked eggs. My pizza was visually very appealing but super bland and dry. There were more mushrooms than chorizo and it lacked any kind of salt or sauce. I had to bathe it in hot sauce to make it enjoyable. The baked eggs were also bland, I kind of liked the sauce but the Feta was nowhere to be found. If you me promise cheese it better be there. 

Price: At about 14 bucks a person it wasn&#39;t very pricy, but I wouldn&#39;t mind paying a little more to get better food.

My wife and I always enjoy the terrific rustic French cuisine as well as the friendly service. However, 2 things troubled me on our last few visits. First of all, they only accept cash, which would be fine, but their ATM will only dispense $120 at a time. Which is not enough for a nice dinner for two. So before we sat down we paid $10 in bank fees. Second, and more importantly, I have witnessed the waiters and busboys countless times clearing dirty glasses off tables by sticking their fingers inside them. I&#39;m going to have to assume that they didn&#39;t wash their hands each time before handling my bread and clean silver. It&#39;s really quite disgusting.

he had the Norwegian (eggs benedict with salmon), i had some eggs on the side of a kale salad, and we split an order of the french toast. amazing. all of it. 

the portions were perfect size, potatoes and salad on the side were cooked and seasoned well, the salad was perfectly massaged (a big deal for kale..) and seasoned with a bit of a spicy anchovy style dressing...and the shredded egg they add to the salad was also very genius in taste. coffee was fresh and tasty.

if you can grab a seat outside on a nice day it&#39;s very enjoyable because the street isn&#39;t too busy - slow enough for you to enjoy your company, but busy enough to people watch

will be back for dinner for sure! especially for their $1 oyster happy hour on Thursdays!

the only minor complaint would be the service (a bit slow, although fully attentive once they came over) - but i give slow brunch service a break because it&#39;s the weekend and well, it&#39;s brunch - everyone deserves a break.

I had fresh juicy oysters with a nice hot sauce and bright vinegar- delicious and fresh..followed by the perfectly seasoned Monkfish over butternut squash risotto. The Risotto was swimming in butter, and I was just fine with that. It had a nice little crunch in there too. The texture, flavor and presentation of the main course were all spot on. I finished with a ginger cr√®me brulee which was glorious and not too sweet, with a gentle ginger flavor and subtle fresh coconut! The staff was charming as ever- hitting a rare balance of charm and authenticity that lacks in pretense you&#39;d normally fear in places like this, the environment just as sexy as the first time I went in for the incredible Mussels/Wine and fry for $15. Stepping into Le Paddock you feel transported. This is officially one of my favorite restaurants."

We came in a little past 11 and there were no tables, but we decided to sit at the bar to eat after being offered the suggestion. I started out with some coffee, which was pretty good. I ordered french toast and was definitely happy with my choice; I LOVE french toast made with brioche and it was cooked to perfection. It was served with powdered sugar, blueberries, and strawberries on top (syrup was served on the side.) It was absolutely delicious and I would definitely order it again. One of my friends got the goat cheese sandwiches which looked delicious (and she definitely enjoyed.) I didn&#39;t get to try the scone this time, but it looked great and is definitely something I&#39;d want to try if I come back!"

Toasty warm, great for families with small kids, solid menu for a neighborhood spot. I had the eggs florentine, which came with tossed greens and seasoned roasted potatoes. Cleaned my plate. My husband had the burger, medium rare, which was thick, juicy, cooked perfectly to order and appointed with pickles, bacon, cheese and some crisp fries. Orange juice was freshly squeezed. Bloody Mary was on point. Stuck around for dessert, and the chocolate mousse was fluffy and not too sweet; the slice of almond cake was immense -- definitely sharable -- and came slathered in apricot compote, a dusting of sugar, and a generous dollop of fresh cream. We were very happy with our meal and will definitely be back to this cozy neighborhood staple."

As a local, this place had the potential to be a lovely, neighbourhood restaurant with a great vibe - if only it was consistent. Been there a number of times now and enjoyed myself. Alas the last two or three times were less than ordinary. The last time was terrible. Baked eggs were hard and dry and when sent back, returned undercooked and watery. Ordered another dish which was ok - eggs were, again, watery. Service is however, always good. What happened Paddock??"

-fennel &amp; figs salad
-the cabbage that comes with the pork shoulders

First, don&#39;t come here if you want to actually have a conversation with the people you are with. The music is pointless, doesn&#39;t set any kind of mood, but it is LOUD LOUD LOUD. I&#39;m not one to usually comment about the volume of a restaurant, but we could barely hear the people we were with and I am hoarse today from having to shout to just have a basic conversation with old friends. Not an auspicious entry.

Started out with the slowest, most lackadaisical service I&#39;ve ever encountered. 20 minutes before we could flag someone down to take a drink order, another 20 minutes before the drinks arrived...We had to leap at waitstaff throughout the meal to get any service whatsoever. The cocktails were icky - the rum quality was questionable, the options were limited. Oh, it&#39;s a wine bar, you say, so why are you ordering cocktails? Well, when we moved to wine, we were steered towards a particular bottle by the waitress. Holy crap, it was absolutely undrinkable! It tasted like a cough drop and a package of nails were melted down and served to us. Is there someone actually in charge of ordering at this place or are they just taking whatever is available on steep discount?

And to the food. The short rib that CLEARLY wasn&#39;t actually a short rib and couldn&#39;t have looked less appealing upon arrival. The grainy, plain ricotta dish. The fish with teeny tiny bones throughout (though some had been removed, so it was a surprise when you got a mouthful), the poorly cooked brussels sprouts, the merguez and squid with the white beans that were undercooked, and last but not least, the only highlight, the chicken liver pate, which I doubt they even prepared.  

I have never, ever been steered so wrong by a yelp review. This place is AWFUL in every respect."

My friend and I ordered a bunch of small plates to share and by the end of the night, we were happily full! 
She had 2 glasses of the orange wine, it is a wine bar after all! Adrian was our server, and he was phenomenal! He brought her samples of the wine before she committed to drink an entire glasses! He also was very good at recommending plates for us to share. 

We tried: 
- the cucumber with whipped feta. That was delicious and refreshing! 
- the bread and eggplant dip. That was a babaganoush style roasted eggplant dip. It was simple and delicious. The bread was rustic and perfect for the rest of the small plates! 
- the grilled octopus was phenomenal! The toppings and the spicy sauce that was in the plate were perfect compliments to the fish. 
- the dried ham was perfectly aged (is that a thing to say to compliment a dried ham?!) 
- the lamb carpaccio. That was, to my opinion, a really different dish. Tasted just like a beef carpaccio, with the exact same texture, with a strong lamb tone. Very different, never had that before and I enjoyed it very much! 

For dessert we shared a decadent chocolate ganache/cream/awesomely rich thing with cookie crumbs. It was perfect! 

I loved this place and would happily return when in the neighborhood!"

June is a sexy little spot that takes you to a different world as soon as you walk in.  The inside was calm and cool with a soft buzz from all the patrons sitting at the bar.

The lighting was bright since it was day time, but all the booths lined up on the side gave the whole place a classic and relaxed feeling.  I would love to come see this spot again at night.

&#34;Me and My Arrow&#34; seemed like a nice fitting cocktail to start with, and also ordered the duck rice and crostini.  The cocktail was really well made; refreshing with strong citrus notes.  

The duck rice had a deep flavor.  I would definitely order this again.  The salmon crostini was well balanced.  The smoked salmon and cream cheese with thick cut toast gave every bite a smooth and luscious texture.

And this place is an excellent reason. I came here for drinks with a friend on a Friday night back in early September, and we were able to sit at the last open table in the back garden, which was gorgeous. I love bars that have back gardens, so when the weather is nice, I always insist on sitting outside. There were lots of trees, string lights, and cute patio tables. We each got a glass of rose and shared the bread and dip. Everything was great! Our waitress was very friendly as well. 

The vibe at June was really friendly and laid back. It&#39;s such a nice break from places where the music is too loud to talk over or where it&#39;s so packed it&#39;s uncomfortable. It was a beautiful summer night, but it wasn&#39;t overly crowded at all. It&#39;s the perfect date spot or place to meet up with girlfriends. There is also a nice variety of seating to accommodate different types of groups. The lighting is dim and muted, and the dark wood and curve of the ceiling really makes the space feel intimate and warm."

We ordered a scallop appetizer and shared an entr√®e as we weren&#39;t really hungry and simply wanted some tapas and a few drinks.  The entr√®e we chose was a pork shoulder with a side of corn (which was w.e. really didn&#39;t compliment the meat as it should&#39;ve, I think something more like polenta or roasted tricolor potatoes might have been best,  but that&#39;s just me)  The description read it was slow roasting for 24hrs,  but to be honest it was more like pork chops sliced into pieces. It was tasty don&#39;t get me wrong,  but definitely not what you expect 1. for pork being slow roasted for 24hrs and 2. for $26. 

For drinks,  we had a few glasses of wines, they do have a large list and you can ask to sample a few but do keep in mind that the sample taste they give you in literally a bit more than a drop,  I have tasted many many wines in different places and they have always given us enough for half a sip each,  after all if we both like it,  we usually order the bottle. Wasn&#39;t the case here.  You ask for a taste,  you will literally get 1/2 a taste lol.  

Again,  I can see why so many people love this place ( as it was full) as for us,  not so much."

I don&#39;t care, still gonna do it (but I&#39;ll be honest about the good):

Place is cute and not too crowded on a Sunday afternoon. Laid back vibe and great ambience, think shabby dark 20s French bistro.  Brunch. Menu is limited but doesn&#39;t feel that way. We got a couple drinks and food, all of which was delicious.  Can&#39;t deny that French toast.

But. The alpha dude on duty took an instant and persistent dislike to me and his constant shade basically ruined the whole thing.

If it even matters, the story: He had a bit of a mixup bringing the food out, bringing our order to a confused other table nearby. Not a big deal in any way at all. Except when I tried to let him know we were the table he went into ultra shade mode. After some curt &#39;tude we got the silent treatment and hostile body language of someone who hates your guts but has to clear your plates anyway.

Ruined it for me, hence my low rating, but I am sure you&#39;ll have a better time. Especially if you&#39;re a white woman rolling deep in a crew of your besties."

It&#39;s in the old Van Horn space, and they did a wonderful job renovating the place. Love the lighting, the mirrors, and the bar. Very old school vibe. Kind of like a miniature train station.

Their wine menu is impressive. Very thorough, with lots of wine types I&#39;d never even heard of before.

But I came here for the cocktails. At first I was skeptical because they only had 6 cocktails on the menu. But after tasting a few of them, I could tell that they put thought into crafting each one.

The Infinitely Late at Night was a brandy cocktail with rosemary and genepy. Very well balanced, and you could taste all of the ingredients. Strong but not overpowering. A bit on the sweeter side.

Also tried the Things Behind The Sun, which had gin, vermouth, besk, apricot and sour orange. Decidedly more tart than the Late at Night, but also very good.

The second best part of the cocktails is that each one has at least one ingredient I haven&#39;t had before. The first best part is that the cocktails are reasonably priced at $10-12 apiece.

Bartenders are great (and good looking, if you *must* objectify them). But most of all, they mix a mean cocktail. It seemed like they had 5 or 6 people behind the bar at once to fill all the orders, which made service super quick on a Friday night.

Great date spot too! Maybe cozy up to an indie movie at Cobble Hill Cinemas, grab some wine/small bites at June, and finish off the night at Chocolate Room? That would definitely get me into bed."

It didn&#39;t disappoint. Came around 7pm and had no trouble getting a table for 2 (though it did fill up pretty soon after). 

This wine bar is simply adorable. As many have noted, it&#39;s doing rustic decor right, from the wood window bar and tables to the candlelit ambiance. And the outdoor patio is super romantic. 

We ordered several glasses of red wine I&#39;d never tried before and can&#39;t quite pronounce. All were awesome.

Don&#39;t worry if your wine savvy is rusty- the wait staff is knowledgable and quite friendly.

In case you were wondering, we shared the slow baked carrots (solid, but the accompanying Roman gnocchi are stunning), the cassoulet (rich and delicious), the kale salad (it is Brooklyn, after all), the acorn squash flatbread (yes), and the brioche (fuck yes). And it was more than enough for dinner for two.

June may be new to the neighborhood, but as far as I can tell the only shortcomings seem to be that it should be at least four to five blocks closer to my apartment, and it&#39;s going to be tough to get a seat."

There is a lot to like about June but a couple critiques too.  
Let&#39;s start with the pros!
- Beautiful decor.  I just love the design of June.  The art deco styling is really well-done and charming but very refined.  It&#39;s also unique and not the same rustic, old-timey charm that most places seem to go for.
- Well trained, professional and great staff.  Our waitress was lovely.  She was attentive but not annoying and when I asked about 2 different Cab Francs from the Finger Lakes, she sent over someone (sommelier?) who was able to really verbalize the differences and describe the flavor profiles of each.   
- Food.  I&#39;m partial to small plates since if you get to try more things so that is a big plus for me.  Every time we&#39;ve come, there have been truly incredible standout dishes.  Last night the tomato dish with homemade ricotta and plums was incredible!  However, there is usually at least 1 dish that we think is just &#34;fine&#34; but not incredible.  We had the Lamb rice last night and that was a little boring/lacking in flavor.  
- Great Cocktails and Wine List.  We both had a great mezcal based cocktail and then a nice bottle of wine.  The bottles are reasonably priced with the red bottles mostly seeming to range from $40-$50 (possibly some even less).  


Cons:
-The biggest annoyance for me is that this is a restaurant that serves multiple small plates but they didn&#39;t spread out the timing very well so between 2 of us, we ordered 5 dishes (upon the waitress&#39; recommendation) but then the plates came out so quickly that by the time the last dish came out there was no room on the tiny table and I felt pressured to somehow, quickly clear a plate so they could make more room.  Next time for sure I will ask to make sure they are spread out better as this was a little annoying.
-Maybe it&#39;s silly but I find their bar stools incredibly uncomfortable!  I actually love sitting at the bar in restaurants much of the time but these stools have a rim around them and kind of dig into your leg if you don&#39;t use the foot rest.  I was wearing a dress yesterday so insisted on sitting at a table because of the discomfort of the stool (and I felt like a princess saying so...but hey, I like to be comfortable)
-The tables along the wall are quite close to one another so you don&#39;t really get any privacy and last night until our lovely waitress asked if the music was too loud, it was blaring and we had to shout to hear one another!  I&#39;ll take that as a fluke and I appreciated that she realized that herself and asked if it was an issue without us saying a word.

All in all, this is a great restaurant and I&#39;ll be back for sure.  Maybe I&#39;ll wear pants next time and sit at the bar!  I&#39;ve also never sat outside which looks beautiful!  When the weather is comfortable, I&#39;d be excited to try that too."

Highly recommend choosing June on a quiet weeknight for third, fourth, fifth, or regular date night with your special someone. Or, and this is an even better idea, remember that you are your special someone and take yourself out to June whenever you need an escape. We all look for that quintessential place where you feel like you are leaving the city behind the moment you step foot in the door. Many places try, few achieve it, June more than achieves it and does so seemingly effortlessly. Not only in ambience but in service as well. Recommendations were spot on, the menu was diverse yet felt small when our waitress was reviewing it with us. I love a place that knows their menu forwards and backwards. June seems to bring out the best in everyone. Simply divine."

Great selection of wine.  They serve mostly small plates and a couple larger items.  Food was pretty delicious - ingredients tasted fresh.

We ordered:
Brussels Sprouts - I thought this was pretty standard, but my friend LOVED that ish. 
Crostini - Bread was perfectly toasted and I loved the winter squash on top.  Nice balance of texture &amp; flavor.
Little Gems - Loved this salad.  A great starter - super simple
Whole Roasted Trout - YUM! YUM!

This will def be a chill go-to spot for when my friends from Cali come to visit.  =)"

What everyone else says is true. All that stuff. Great decor and staff and the wine list is great. Easily the best wine list by miles compared to anything else in the neighborhood (Buttermilk and French Louie and the Stinky wine bar would be the exceptions). 
I&#39;ve only drank wine and eaten dessert here at the bar. I&#39;d recommend that as a fine evening.

Beware! It does not have your standard quality beers like  Bud, Coors Light, etc!!!

- interesting, well curated wine list, consisting mostly of natural wines
- friendly services, super chill vibe and decor
- reasonably priced; some wines are sold by quantino 
- food is good; I especially love the slowed cook lamb breast and grilled spring onions in chili puree

All above deserve 4 stars on my book. The extra star goes to the patio at the back. Perfect fist date spot or small group of friends gathering. 

The only complain, or I should have said wish, is that, there are more wine by the glass choices. 

Took me $20 cab wide to get here but it is def worth the hike. If they open a sister wine bar in lower Manhattan, I guarantee I will come back every week."

Love what you&#39;ve done with the place, June! The arched ceiling, the lit bulbs, the mirrors and big roomy booths. It&#39;s reminiscent of an old-timey train station (I bet it photographs gorgeously in black and white). 

We only stopped in for drinks at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and the service was quick. Extremely limited cocktail menu, but the cocktails are put together very well. I had the Things Behind The Sun, which was sweet and tart but balanced. No complaints on that.

Inside, there is a long bar that stretches all the way down the narrow but long room.  Against the left wall are booth style seating.  Very spacious.
Interior is dimmed by very tasteful, reminded me of a rustic Eastern-European train station.

Unique wine offering - expect &#34;New&#34; country wine. (Sorry no Bordeaux)  They also refer to their wine as &#34;Natural wine&#34;. I ordered a glass of the HARDD√àCHE: JEAN-MARC BRIGNOT. ($10/glass)  My waiter explained to me the harvest of the grape for this wine was done by following the moon cycle.  Whatever that means, I affiliated it with some kind of bohemian practices.  Perhaps this is what they mean by &#34;Natural Wine&#34;?

Service was a let down -- sat at the bar and the bartender was checking her watch while she talked to us. Perfunctory service at best. 

The crowd was young and some were pretty crass that night: drunk twenty-something&#39;s pulling up their shirts, shouting and drawing on their bellies with markers at the tables, women from same group loudly discussing their genitals with their male friends while on line at the bathroom.

And she got kind of awkward and laughed at me, saying she &#34;hadn&#39;t smelled that in years.&#34; Well ok sorry I am not wearing the latest perfume, but you don&#39;t have to make me feel old for wearing a classic! I&#39;m in my early 30s for pete&#39;s sakes..

I came here once before and didn&#39;t think we&#39;d get a table, 30 min wait for a table for two. But they have the option of waiting in the back heated patio where you can order anything you can order inside. It was so pleasant and lovely back there, we ended up just having dinner in the back! Actually nicer there- quieter, darker and still decent service (though TINY tables).

Small menu but everything was tasty. Especially the trevisano salad- very fresh and satisfying with crunchy hazlenuts. And the hake was SO good. Yum yum. I&#39;ll be back!"

The portions were painfully tiny, the smallest I&#39;ve seen in the neighborhood. The wine list was extensive, but I ended up not being impressed at all by any one in particular. The French reds we tried I would say were even downright bad. Service is extremely hit or miss, mostly miss. The first time I tried to dine at June, no one even gave me a menu for about 10 minutes and there were maybe 2 other patrons inside so I walked out. The second time, again, perhaps 4 other patrons and the service was needlessly slow. Yet it&#39;s extraordinarily expensive. I won&#39;t ever be going back."

I went to June Wine Bar which just opened this week and was thoroughly impressed.  Excellent natural wine selection by the bottle and while more minimal selection by the glass, each of them were thoughtfully picked to make the cut.  

The vibrancy of the wine pairs well with each of the savory dishes that are good to share that ranged in both lighter to heartier foods.  I strongly recommend the Beef Tongue Pastrami and Slow-Baked Carrot, those were anything but disappointing. 

If you have room for something sweet, the Apple-Miso Cobbler was also a recognizable standout on any dessert menu.  Needless to say, I will be coming here again soon.  Enjoy!"

Literally no seats in the house. It opened up a few weeks ago and it&#39;s super cute and intimate on the inside so it might just be that everyone is super excited to try this place out (as was I). They serve a pretty wide selection of &#34;natural wines&#34;. Not entirely sure what that means but the bartender described them as &#34;barn yardy&#34;. The few that I sampled were either too acidic or had a weird, bitter after-taste. With the help of the bartender, I settled on an unlabeled wine that they make in house which was pretty good. I also tried the Giant oyster mushroom plate with potato puree. It was delicious. These plates are perfect if you want just a small snack.

The service isn&#39;t top notch, but I think this mainly has to do with the volume of ppl. I&#39;d be interested to see what this place is like in a few months."

We tried three dishes, roasted carrot, crostini and olive oil cake and it was delicious. Ambience is also very very good together with an attentive service. Next time, I will visit solely for dinner as food here is top-notch and unforgettable. So please leave some room for food before coming to June as it is too good to miss."

Delicious wines and small plates plus a beautiful, dark and moody space with a fantastic garden. The food is creative, fresh, and flavorful. The gnocchi might be from heaven and the flatbread with chili butter - omg it&#39;s seriously magic bread.. For two people we shared five plates but they were all so good I could have had five more just for myself. Servers were laid back but attentive - perfect. It&#39;s got a bit of a Gatsby vibe, without the party party shizzle. Relaxed and classy. I think this might be the new perfect spot."

We went in for the wine, hearing that it was a great biodynamic list, ordered a few plates- pretty disappointing all around.

Very pretty room- but you can&#39;t eat the ambiance, or most of the menu. On Saturday, some items are sold out, okay, but what isn&#39;t, isn&#39;t memorable: a turnip dish with turmeric and yogurt was uncomfortably raw, and the duck and rice was reminiscent of Uncle Bens, instant, with cranberries thrown in for laughs.



Service was pretty stressed- All of our food hit the table well before the bottle of wine we had ordered even appeared. Management sent some Amaro as a comp, but for $140 dollars, you can have a better experience in the neighborhood."

Really good ambience inside.  The place was packed for a Monday night, grabbed two seats at the bar.  The stools are very comfy.   Bartender brought over wine and food menu.   Asked about a bottle of red from Loire Valley, bartender has no clue walks away and comes back and doesn&#39;t use any words that are comprehensive to describe the wine.  End up ordering a bottle of Barbera, takes 10+ minutes to bring over to bring it to temperature, brings over wine which is very good however a little on the chilled side.  Asked the bartender if the portions were big she said no (no you should get 2 per person, or 3 or 1-2).   Ordered the meatballs, flat bread, and duck rice.  Meatballs were very tasty, while the polenta with them was very bland.  Flatbread was good, had a nice kick to it.   Duck rice- the rice was very good, loved the raisins and textures, duck was meh.   Service was really spotty- didn&#39;t even bring over small plates to split food.  Menu was extensie but why does it say dinner?  Should say snacks, small plates or food, nothing could be considered dinner.

Like the ambience, had a good selection of wine but definitely needs some tweaks."

Tons of restaurants and bars in this area, but this spot is a hidden gem. Came here on a Tuesday and the place filled up quickly around 7. 

Food: YES. We got the salsa trio and the salsas were all fantastic, authentic. Verde, mole, and hot. Friend got the mole enchiladas which were BOMB. I had the fish tacos, and wasn&#39;t crazy about them, but will definitely be coming back for the mole enchiladas. May even venture off and try the verde. 

Drinks: SO many different margarita options. They also offer sangria and mojitos as well we beer selections. I had the jalapeno marg, I believe, which was tasty and not too spicy. I wanted to try the mango habanero but was told by the waitress that it was extremely hot, so I decided against it. I will give it a try when I&#39;m back for sure."

I live around the corner from this place and decided to finally give it a try. After the first 20 minutes of sitting in the restaurant, I decided I will never be going back there. This place is CRAMPED. Expect your back to be touching the back of the person sitting behind you. You might even be elbowed in the gut by your neighboring table. 
   The staff was unfriendly. As we sat down at the bar (because there were no available tables), the bartender placed cups of water in front of us while rolling her eyes for no reason -- Not a good first impression of your establishment. Then, she asked us for our order by rudely/abruptly saying, &#34;Whatcha gettin&#34;. Please train your staff some basic professionalism and hospitality.
   We ordered 2 enchilada verdes, which were overpriced at $18 each, and waited a long time for them (at least 30 minutes) even though the entire time, we didn&#39;t see food leave the kitchen except for guacomole and chips that everyone around us seemed to only be ordering. Their enchilada verdes was the worst we&#39;ve ever eaten, something as I could imagine Gordon Ramsey would only compare to as &#34;eating a wet diaper&#34;. We could tell the enchiladas were frozen, not fresh, the tortillas were a soggy mush that disentegrated from the touch of my fork, the chicken was dry, and the whole dish was bland. A pile of green mush slopped onto a plate. Not to mention after eating the food, we got stomach problems...aka diarrahea. Our stomach pain is lasting into the next day. Since I live so closeby, I was hoping to find another place to add to my list of regular spots, but no thanks, I learned my lesson and will never be returning here again. Eat here at your own risk."

Food is nothing special. I got ab enchilada and it was kinda sweet which I didn&#39;t like. The tacos were good though. 

Drinks are strong but kinda pricey. Drinks are about $11. They have good music cause they play old and new popular songs. Service was good. Food is average prices for Mexican but it was nothing special. 

Chips salsa and sauce is really good though."

Hard to find in the crowd of restaurants, but once inside there was plenty of seating available in a nice intimate atmosphere.

Didn&#39;t waste any time to start - split the Dark Rum Mojito ($10), Red Sangria ($8), and Guacamole ($10). Drinks are certainly strong and refreshing. Guacamole is chunky with a good amount of flavor, served with regular salted tortilla chips and a wicked hot sauce. For the meals got the Enchiladas Verdes ($15) and Barbacoa ($18). Enchiladas were made with sauteed zucchini and mushrooms and a sweet white sauce on top (good). The barbacoa is fantastic - a giant pot of marinated shredded pork with brown rice and veggies. Hearty and served with fresh/warm tortillas. Capped off the night with a Elderberry Margarita ($11) which has an interesting taste to go with a strong punch and a sugar rim.

Definitely a pricey spot for Mexican food (and for the LES). Service is quick and friendly without being overbearing. A nice late night sitdown option."

The Enchiladas Verde was packed with chicken and a hefty size, a definite plus for the price. My friend and I ordered the Arrachera tacos. The skirt steak was very tender so we were happy campers! The restaurant itself is quite small but luckily, we only had to wait a few minutes at 6:30pm on a Wednesday.

Side note: order the Chips and Salsa as an app because that only costs $4 and you get three different salsas to dip with! Such a steal compared to the price of all the other dishes."

We started off with the coconut mojito and jalapeno margarita. The drinks are strong and really good. We ordered the guacamole (so flavorful) and chips(so fresh). We got the chicken tacos, where I felt the grilled chicken was so well done to perfection and tasted amazing! Then we got the enchiladas verdes -- again super flavorful and delicious.

Got here before it was a long wait and were seated at the end of the long communal table. Definite cool, slight hipster vibe, but I like that relaxed, laid back ambiance compared to other places we could&#39;ve visited. Our server was super friendly and helpful. 

Chips and guacamole are exactly as other Yelpers have described, delicious. The chips are served hot, perfectly salted and thicker than what you usually get at most Mexican restaurants. These are the ones I look for when I go out for Mexican food! The guacamole was chunky and delicious. Perfect. The salsa they serve on the side is also good. 

As per Elton&#39;s suggestions, I went with the enchiladas verdes. My mouth is drooling right now because I wish I was eating it as I&#39;m typing this review. See picture of the dish! Also had the steak tacos and the al pastor tacos. You order one type of taco and get two to an order so we placed two taco orders. The tacos were so good. The steak, outstanding!! Very flavorful.

Hands down the best mole sauce I have had and a it was a very generous portion. My friend had vegetarian enchilada verde and she loved it. The margaritas were okay.

I walked in for dinner on a Monday night with my boyfriend and we were greeted as soon as we walked in. Our server was incredibly helpful with questions we had about the food and drinks. Service: 10/10

For an appetizer, we ordered the chips and guac. Honestly best guac I&#39;ve had. Chip portion is a little small but you can ask for a refill for only $3.

Which is all fine.

The guacamole was really good, which should be a given in a nice mexican restaurant, the hand made tortilla chips were a great added touch. 

Unfortunately I was really underwhelmed by everything else. The pork tacos were cubes of meat rather than juicy slow cooked shredded pork like normal, and were pretty dry and not tasty. I had the barbeccoa slow cooked duck which was ok but over salted and not amazing. 

The prices are pretty good, not excessive. 

I would go back on the strength of my friends recommendations to see if maybe they were having an off day but so far not so good.

Update: I went back and tried it again and was equally underwhelmed."

There was eight of us and they don&#39;t take reservations on weekends so I showed up at 6:45 for an 8pm time and it worked out well. The only reason this place isn&#39;t a 5 is for the seating arrangement. We had to sit at the communal picnic table and they made people wait outside to wait for others to move. It was a sloppy setup for our big group but well worth it we found out later. We all started with different flavors of margaritas. Everyone seemed to like the flavors and such. We ordered a few orders of guacamole and chips for the table. The guacamole was top notch and so were the crispy chips. For appetizers we ordered a bunch of tacos for the table like the pescado, al pastor, steak, and tongue. They come two per order so we need almost two of each. Tacos were very good and full with flavor. The agreement was that the steak taco was the favorite. My entree was the raved about enchiladas verdes. Stuffed with chicken, melted Oaxacan cheese, and topped with slices of avocados. A nice Mexican crema drizzled on top, this was the star. This was authentic and so tasty. I really ate mine and then anyone who didn&#39;t finish there&#39;s. I&#39;m already ready to go back and order the same thing it was so good."

BUT they were very understaffed, causing the server/bartender (one person serving everyone) to be agitated by any request. This is not an efficient way to run a business given you have customers who choose to come in and spend money at your restaurant instead of others around, they deserve your time and attention and not to feel as if they are a bother. The bus boy (I believe he was Mexican, just to be specific as to who) was not polite, requested a straw and 10min later when I reminded him he gave a face and was irritated to grab it then when we tried to get his attention for a question he told the server/bartender (reminder there was only ONE) to go answer us, as if he couldn&#39;t be bothered to grab us napkins meanwhile the server was already completely tied up. The food and drinks were pretty good here, but the service was horrible therefore 2 stars it is because nowadays with all the competition out there in NYC customer service matters a lot"

Barrio Chino is easy to find in the LES. The food is amazing and the staff is friendly and attentive.

It may be tiny in size, but it sure does pack a punch with it&#39;s food! My friend and I each had the chicken tacos 3 per order, and an appetizer order of chips and salsa and a side of guacamole. They do charge you for the chips and guacamole but everything is reasonably priced. We did not order drinks and everything came out to just under $36 for the two of us total. 

The tacos were pretty good but the guacamole was to die for!! I literally fell in love. My friend and I could not get enough. Seriously! Definitely a must when coming here. That alone was good enough to make me come back here!

The staff was so friendly and really treated us like valued customers. The dining area and bar are a bit tight but it is manageable. I would certainly not hesitate to come back here and try the other items on their menu. I definitely recommend this place."

This is THE BEST Mexican place I have ever been to. It was packed and busy and there are only 6 or so tables...but hostess is very nice and calls your phone when a table is ready so you can walk around and find a bar. The drinks were excellent, and the margaritas were super fresh (loved that I was scoffed at in a nice way when I questioned if they use a mix or fresh juices), and food was beyond amazing (made in a smallish kitchen to-order). We had the enchiladas verdes and the enchiladas mole....both were unbelievable. Everything was awesome.

I love their elder flower margarita to start and their homemade guac with fresh chips!!!!!!

I&#39;m happy that it was a vegetarian friendly restaurant. The guacamole was good. The salsa was great and tortilla chips were different from what you get at most places - in a good way! They made the enchilada verde vegetarian for us. The verde sauce was really good. Liked their drinks too."

It&#39;s really good, and consider it one of the best for Mexican in the city, thus, my 5-star rating.  I&#39;m picky when it comes to Mexican as my mom is from Mexico and I grew up there as well as in Texas and lived in California.  

I really like their enchiladas verdes, chorizo con huevo, and carne asada tacos with sliced avocado, as well as their chips (which are real, handmade) &amp; guacamole.  Plus I think their salsas are very good as well, almost exactly like my aunt&#39;s in Mexico, and like that they only serve corn tortillas, no gringo-flour ones.

And even though I don&#39;t think this is the best Mexican I&#39;ve ever had in my life, I do think that it&#39;s one of the Top 5 Mexican spots in Manhattan, maybe #2 or tied with Ofrenda as the best.  And, as with anything in Manhattan, good Mexican is going to be expensive, remember, you&#39;re not in Texas or California where most dishes are under $10 for excellent food.  So, if you want good Mexican along with a good scene, you&#39;re going to have to pay for it.

Other places I think are the best in the city are La Esquina, Ofrenda and Toloache.  I also like Tehuitzingo, but that&#39;s a different ball game, as its not a nice, sit-down place like these are."

I had to review this though because it was too good not to!  This place had been on my list to try for some time, but because I&#39;m not in the LES too often for dinner, I hadn&#39;t had the opportunity to try it.  After having been here though, I&#39;d make a special trip back to the neighborhood just to eat here again.

This place is a small, casual Mexican spot in the LES that has a cool atmosphere and delicious food.  I came here with a friend early in the evening, and we were seated quickly.  When I say this place is small though, I mean it is small.  There were only a few tables (with additional bar seating), and when we left, a line was forming.  They take reservations though, so I&#39;d suggest making them.  The physical space has a nice mix of Mexican and urban elements...perfect for a Mexican spot in the LES.

The drinks here are great.  They have more than ten different types of margaritas, and if they are all as good as what I ordered, I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t go wrong.  They have some unique flavors and of course, more traditional flavors too.  The food was also excellent.  Almost everything on the menu is less than $20, and I definitely would have paid more for food this delicious.  I started with the guacamole, which was perfect, and I also had the fish tacos.  I wouldn&#39;t have changed anything about the meal.

With friendly staff, a casual environment, and delicious food and drinks, I can guarantee that I&#39;ll be coming back here soon."

Gets crammed though so get in early or prepare to wait for an hour+

Their jalape√±o infused margaritas are legendary.

Their hot sauces are real (ask for the actually spicy one).

Only place I&#39;ve seen molletes in the USA ever. Sounds like a great place for breakfast/brunch.

I&#39;d give &#39;em 4 stars but I&#39;m very picky with Mexican food and also it&#39;s not cheap (not too expensive either) plus it&#39;s so hip now the crowds really annoy me. It&#39;s NY though, I shouldn&#39;t don&#39;t them for that -- still doesn&#39;t help."

They have a list of unique margaritas. I got a vanilla strawberry margarita that was served with sugar on the rim. I can&#39;t wait to return to try more of them. 

We started with chips and a salsa assortment (which costs a couple of dollars) but totally worth it. There were 3 different ones- a green one, a tomato one, and a roasty one. 

I order their mol√© enchiladas ($15) that were absolutely fantastic. It was a decently sized portion served with cabbage on top, and refrigerate black beans. I was so full afterwards!

There are very few things I&#39;m proud of but chief amongst them is my positive disposition, patience and understanding. Being born in NY and having travelled to over 50 countries, unintentionally specialising in dining - I have never come across a baser, hollow shell of a human being revelling in her meagre power without regard for decency and civility. 

We arrived rather hungry and asked rather politely how long till we may be seated since reservations are not allowed. Julie, the hollow shell, informed us 20 to a maximum of 30 minutes. 

Long story short, as i would like to get back to the evening and seek another location to quench said hunger, after 1.5 hours of dealing with her void soul - we left. 

Seeking benefit of the doubt, Julie is obviously moonlighting as she must be on the verge of winning her first academy award and I commend her acting skills - for they must be vast- in somehow getting this job. Hiring mistakes happen but no institution can be so blind.

For lunch, I had the enchiladas verdes - on the bartender&#39;s recommendation (although she said it was a toss up between that and the Al Pastor tacos). So good - the chicken was flavorful and the verde sauce and cheese were a perfect, gooey mess. 

Love the space too - very chill and unassuming. The bartender was super nice - she asked what was on my agenda for the day. Obviously, she was being very considerate since I was dining alone.

The drinks had more ice than drink which wouldn&#39;t normally bother me but it cost $12 which is about $4 per sip. What really turned me off though was how the Chloe Sevigny-look alike (hostess) packed me and my boyfriend into the middle of a community table after I specifically said I didn&#39;t want to be placed in the middle. (We had waited 45 minutes for a two table and finally surrendered to the community table because we were starving to death.) here&#39;&#39;s an idea: why don&#39;t you rent the vacant laundry mat next door?

For the appetizer, we shared the &#34;Cazuela De Mariscos,&#34; tilapia and shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce served with bread. Although the dish was delicious, we could count the tiny chunks of fish and shrimp on two hands. Additional bread to eat with all of the remaining sauce was not free. It wasn&#39;t special bread, but the type of bread typically provided to tables at no charge.

I ordered the &#34;Enchiladas de Mole&#34; as my entree. It tasted great, but I really expected more chicken enchilada as it was mostly rice and black beans. The Margarita and Caipirinha that I had were decent. The interior of the restaurant was dim - very dim - being lit almost entirely by candles. The restaurant&#39;s faux-Chinese motif (i.e., wall art, plates) was interesting to say the least but I&#39;m not sure how it enhanced the overall experience.

The main thing that bothered us was how people waiting for tables spilled into the already congested dining area. There were people standing literally spitting distance away from us and other seated customers. Imagine trying to enjoy a meal with friends while hungry and increasingly impatient people gawk at your food and listen in on your conversations. Not cool. Our dinner felt hurried and it detracted from the restaurant&#39;s top asset, which is undoubtedly its low-key and romantic dining ambiance.

All I can say is the Chilequiles Rojos - essentially marinated tortilla chips covered in this delicious tomato salsa, topped with an egg and black beans. It was amazing. 

I had the Avocado Torta -¬†easily the best torta i&#39;ve ever had. They definitely give La Esquina a run for their money. Somehow they got the Queso Fresco to stay in a square on the sandwich and figured out how to toast the bread so perfectly that no bites saw any avocado slip out...its &#39;wichcraft I tell you (pun intended).

As for the tacos - I like to consider myself a fish taco connoisseur. I literally ate every bite. They were perfectly seasoned and not doused in sauce. 

The vibe of this restaurant/bar is phenomenal. Definitely a good first date spot or a place to bring friends. The restaurant is very unassuming in nature.

Do they really taste like home, or has it just been too long for me to remember what I&#39;m missing?  Either way, I whole heartedly approve!

The wait was long, but luckily there are literally countless bars around to waste away the time before you get to chow down.  Chips are not free and endless, much to my dismay, but they are worth it, especially with a nice heaping side of guac.  Beware the salsa, however. It starts out wonderfully, but rest assured it will destroy your taste buds and then seek revenge in the worst ways.  But that&#39;s ok, because that&#39;s what real salsa is supposed to do.

I came here around 5:30pm on a Saturday night and there was only one other table that was occupied. The restaurant itself is really tiny, and I think people come to the bar more than for the food. They had a few Chinese inspired decor and plating, but thats about as Chinese this place gets. Their menu is 100% Mexican. My friend and I started out with the guacamole and chips, and I got the calamari tacos while he got the arrachera. The guacamole tasted so fresh and homemade. You can taste the ingredients in it. My calamari tacos were a little on the salty side, but they were still good. Its the first time I had a squid in my tacos and I&#39;d say its a great combo! I sadly did not get to try the arrachera tacos. The pics on yelp look so misleading though. For $10 you get 3 tacos, but the tacos were super small! I&#39;m from Texas so I&#39;m used to tacos being a lot bigger. But maybe thats how tacos are in New York.

So post-lunch at Barrio Chino yesterday, I can officially announce that I have, for the first time ever, after twenty-four long hours, experienced my first craving for Mexican food. It was those Enchiladas Verdes that finally did me in (as one of the best things that I have ever eaten). 

Barrio Chino has it all: both red and green fire-roasted salsa, real corn tortilla chips and fresh texturized guacamole with a nice bite of lime. Ultimately, I preferred the salsa verde over the salsa roja since it has heat that proceeds the taste of the salsa versus the salsa roja which is immediately spicier, but that is simply a matter of personal preference considering how they were both phenomenal. The Enchiladas Verdes were nothing short of orgasmic; I&#39;m getting all hot and bothered just thinking about them, and no, it wasn&#39;t because of the salsa verde. The combination of salsa verde, oaxacan cheese, queso fresco topped with a few slices of avocado was perfection as it added a subtle cooling factor to the salsa. Not to mention, the delicious accompaniment of black beans. 

The authentic Mexican cuisine at Barrio Chino was an epiphany of what I have been missing out on for so long. I currently live within walking distance of Barrio Chino (seriously dangerous), and I am convinced that I will be back countless times to devour the rest of their menu.. As well as a few of their margaritas, chips and salsa."

I was expecting some amazing food from my friends&#39; approbations. Much to my surprise, I was left highly dissatisfied.  The guacamole was not very flavorful, it tasted like something I threw together with nearly rotten ingredients that have been sitting in my fridge for weeks.  We also tried the chorizo quesadilla things, super salty and added nothing to the meal.  Lastly, the fish tacos and steak tacos were also overly salty.  I could not enjoy any of the food we ordered.  Every dish felt like something was missing, perhaps some cruciferous veggies or crema, something to offset the salty fishy taste!

I would recommend coming for the margaritas! Strong and spicy!!"

Everyone around us was ordering the guac which also looked amazing.  

For main courses, I got the first soup ($10)  and it honestly tasted like someone&#39;s mexican grandmother made it with some secret family recipe ... it was SO so good.  The enchiladas verdes ($14 or $16) were also some of the best i&#39;ve ever tasted.

For drinks ($11-13) we tried: Grapefruit, Jalapeno Grapefruit, Japapeno Lime, and Habenero Lime margaritas.  I would definitely return!!!!!!"

I had to look at the number and the menu on the window to see the name. It looked like an abandoned store on the outside. It is very small and cramped inside. People sitting at the bar are literally right behind the people at the tables. No space for walking through or pass them. My friend and I got seated pretty quickly but at the bar because the tables were either reserved or already taken. We were ok with the bar, just wanted to eat and chat. It was too loud to chat. I got tacos and I don&#39;t even remember what my friend got (that&#39;s how memorable the food was). I did like their margarita, I got one with some weird fruit name flavor.

Margaritas are also fantastic and there is an ok selection of bottled beers (mostly Mexican standards like corona, tecate, etc but also at least one ipa).

Only real problem is the wait. Always at least 45 minutes when we try to go in Fridays and Saturdays and they don&#39;t take reservations for parties of less than 8 people. It&#39;d be nice if they&#39;d take reservations but it&#39;s well worth the wait."

I ordered a hibiscus margarita, it was super strong. So strong I didn&#39;t have another drink while I was in New York because if all drinks are made like that, I can&#39;t hang. I&#39;m not a big drinker and had to sip this slowly over the course of an hour, lol. If I had like 3 drinks here I would have probably been flat on my face by the end of my meal. That being said the drink was delicious. My server was a nice lady who let me take my time in deciding my meal. The menu comes written on a piece of cardboard which is kind of quirky. I had an Enchiladas de Mole. It was my first time trying enchiladas and BRUH. SO GOOD. There&#39;s a sauce that it sits in which is bursting with flavour. I also had tacos al pastor because why not? It was delicious. The best tacos I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Though they were pretty small and come in sets of three. So enough if you just wanted something light. My bill was like $34 or something like that. If I lived in New York I would probably come here all the time. Everything was perfect. The only issue I had was finding it.

We came in around midnight while visiting a friend and we were able to be seated fairly quickly in this packed tiny spot.  We sampled the carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, and one other I forgot.  Probably because they were gone so fast we had no time to ponder or photograph.

At the end of our 10 day trip, our last day was our 5 year anniversary.  He asks where I want to go... Of course barrio chino!  How can people not be loving this authentic inspired find?  We ate at several upscale relocations in manhattan but barrio just feels like a best friend with fresh limes &amp; a quadrant of spicy taco sauces.

When we returned for a lunch, there was only 2 or 3 other people dining so we got to enjoy the quiet neighborhood.  We tried some enchiladas verde (yumtastic) and more tacos.  I&#39;m a taco addict!  All I cared was I had something to sample and interchange the delicious salsas."

I came here on a Tuesday night with a group of five and the wait was relatively short! 

Drinks:

- Jalapeno *Grapefruit*: So technically the drink was Jalapeno Lime, but you can swap out Grapefruit instead. I just have to say that I am eternally grateful to our waitress for casually guiding me away from the Habanero version of this drink. Not to say that I was not eager for something spicy, but she probably knew right away that this little suburban girl stood no match for the inferno that was the Habanero. 


Food:

- Cazuela de Mariscos: This was a fragrant tomato-based stew with large, gamey chunks of white fish and shrimp. It came with bread!! (yes - I&#39;m probably one of the few people who gets excited about bread at a Mexican restaurant). 

- Ceviche de pescado: Not exactly what I expected and I&#39;m not even talking about the sundae glass that it comes in. I thought that the dish was a little too soupy - the fish chunks were so tender, that I wish I could have had a little more to savor. I also think that the chip to ceviche ratio was a little off!

Literally 10 minutes later, we got a call saying we could eat at the bar. AWESOME.

First up. I love that the drink menu is drawn on a piece of cardboard. It gives it a cool crafty sort of feel to the restaurant. The drinks are on point. I literally would just come here to get drunk. I started out with the coconut mojito. The coconut flavor is incredibly rich and creamy. I am obsessed with this. The drink prices are pretty average for NYC at 10-11 per drink. Definitely worth it because they are strong and taste delicious. The second thing I had was a strawberry mojito. It was good, but dang that coconut one was just TOO good. The only sad thing is that the happy hour is 12 am-close, which I may just have to venture to after a night at the bars lol that is how much I love their drinks.

For food, we shared the guacamole. It was nothing that we would write home about. Not sure why people say they licked the bowl because it isn&#39;t THAT amazing. I&#39;m from Texas, so I know legit guac. We decided on splitting the tacos and enchiladas. The tacos are made for a toddler. Not that they were bad, we had al pastor and the tacos were pretty delicious topped with pineapple and onion. The enchiladas were the money bag dish though. They were the verde ones and on point. Covered in a delicious verde salsa with tons of creamy cheese and black beans. Noms."

1) We went as a large group (AKA more than two people). 
2) I was starving. 

For a 9:30PM reservation, we didn&#39;t think we would have had to wait another 25 minutes to be seated. This place was packed and there isn&#39;t much of a waiting space for our group of 9 to stand it, so we were blocking both the bathroom door and the front entrance. 

The lime margaritas were good, maybe a little watered down. I&#39;ve had better for the price we paid. 

After being seated, we ravenously ordered chips and guacamole. The chips were reminiscent of deep fried wonton wrappers and the guacamole was absolutely delicious. They were devoured almost instantaneously. 

I ordered the enchiladas verde, which were good but the cheese ended up being huge globs. The portions were alright. I had more sauce, cheese, and beans than actual enchilada. I had a bite of the bistek and it was delicious but a little salty. My significant other said he wished there was something to offset the salty steak, like rice or...anything basically. 

But at this point, we were starving after waiting for our food so everything was eaten in a matter of minutes regardless of how it tasted. Literally, I think I ate my meal in about six bites. 

The prices are alright and so is the food. I&#39;m sure if I came with only one other person and had a couple of drinks first, I would&#39;ve had a better experience."

Though there&#39;s nothing resembling Chinese on the menu. It&#39;s just fantastic Mexican food. Authentic with a unique spin. Drinks are great as well. 

Don&#39;t expect a fancy environment. The surroundings are very industrial and divey, with one rough bathroom for use. That said, the appearance gives it a certain personality, and it&#39;s positioned well for the start of a LES crawl. 

Special props for the bartender service, and the mole - the latter of which is some of the best I&#39;ve had. Table service can be a bit inattentive, but the food makes up for it."

I know what you&#39;re thinking - &#34;But Jenn, all delivery sushi places are the same.  They&#39;re overpriced (or extremely cheap and the sushi is sketchy at best), the food is subpar, and they probably didn&#39;t exactly nail your order&#34;.  NOT HAN, THOUGH.  Not Han!

I discovered Han Sushi one day on Seamless when I accidentally searched for sushi instead of using their cuisine type feature.  Pricing was extremely reasonable, reviews were great, and I hadn&#39;t tried it before.  Why not?  I placed an order.  Estimated wait time was 40 minutes or so.  

Not 20 minutes later, my doorbell rings.  That can&#39;t be the sushi, right?  WRONG.  The delivery man RUNS up four flights of stairs to my apartment and hands me the bag.  What?

Not only that, but the food was outstanding as far as delivery goes.  &#34;This must be a fluke&#34; I tell myself as I stuff my face with a tuna roll.  &#34;This was a one time thing&#34;.

I now have ordered from this place 30+ times and only ONCE did anything deviate from the exact situation described above (sushi guy running up the stairs and all- that guys is awesome and you will love him).  One time, my food was late.  And by late I mean MAYBE 15 minutes late.  I am not exaggerating, the delivery man apologized to me three times.  The same guy who never judges me for ordering enough food for 5 people even though he clearly sees it&#39;s just for me.  

Fast, fresh, and NEVER forgets my extra side of ginger dressing.  &#34;A&#34; for Han Sushi... And A+ for awesome delivery man."

The service could have been better. There was one person working alone, with roughly 4 occupied tables. We waited a while for the order of sushi, and at the end to get our payment card back.

Also their rolls wrapped in thinly sliced cucumber that come in salmon or tuna were delicious. The staff were unassuming and somewhat distant, but capable.

Han Sushi has an amazing lunch roll special where you can get either a soup or a salad and two rolls for less than $10. I think my entire bill came to 8 and change. 

For my lovely lunch I got a Philadelphia roll and a spice tuna crunch. Typically, when I get lunch rolls in queens, they&#39;re tiny and not very filling. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find nice chunks of salmon with a proportionate amount of rice. 

All and all, if you&#39;re a hungry college student looking to avoid &#34;cafeteria&#34; sushi, I would definitely come here. After all, you get better quality rolls for less money!"

It was well worth it, I ended up ordering the chicken teriyaki with salad for $14. Initially I thought it didn&#39;t come with rice, so I got a side of brown rice for $2 extra. After I picked up the food well lol I did get a cup of rice but let me get to the chicken. Omg in fact it was a lot of chicken, freshly done, cooked, tendered and the teriyaki sauce complimented the taste. It went well with the brown rice which was Hot (literally) but it wasn&#39;t burnt or rough as I experienced with other Asian restaurants. Next time I&#39;ll dine in instead of eating my meal at the park at this chilly weather."

Also, sushi yasaka was too far away from our workplace so we had to settle for takeout from this place. First off, this is the kind of restaurant that would charge you over miscellaneous things such as extra eel sauce/spicy mayo. They gave the extra sauces to us for free because it&#39;s our first time visiting the restaurant. However, with the waitress constantly nagging us that they would charge extra for the sauces next time, it definitely gave off bad vibes for our first experience. 

I am slightly disappointed by their maki rolls. I ordered crunchy spicy salmon, eel and avocado, and yellowtail scallion. My favorite roll was probably the spicy salmon, the salmon was fresh and the sauce compliments it very well. The rest of the rolls were sub-par. The eel was rather hard and chewy. The yellowtail roll, on the other hand, was not grounded with scallions (most traditional places serve it grounded), which made it less flavorful. 

The quality of the raw fish (salmon and yellowtail) is overall good, which would have otherwise earned a 3-4 star review for this restaurant. However I am giving this restaurant 2 stars mainly because of their rice, which was not cooked properly. It was on the hard and dry side, which was unpleasant to chew on. 

While $12 dollars for 3 rolls is a very standard price across most sushi restaurants, there are definitely places that serve higher quality sushi for the same price. If you insist on visiting this place, I would recommend you to order their raw fish rolls such as tuna avocado, salmon, etc."

The restaurant hasn&#39;t been opened for very long, so it&#39;s clearly very clean for now. The staff were very nice and refilled our water glasses quickly. 
Lunch specials come with a soup or salad. We decided on soup instead. It was a bit lighter in color than usual, probably used less miso since it wasn&#39;t as salty as others tend to be. We ordered the 2 special rolls each since they&#39;re always better than a regular roll...The deal sounded great until we received the actual rolls. Special rolls are usually pretty big and even one can be somewhat filling. We ordered a Dancing Eel, Godzilla, Red Hot Dragon Roll and something else. They all tasted quite similar. Dancing Eel is supposed to have spicy crunchy king crab... It was not spicy nor crunchy and it didn&#39;t taste like king crab. Regardless, I ate both of my rolls and I wouldn&#39;t exactly say I was full and I&#39;ve been eating very small portions lately (nor was L, I could tell he was still quite hungry.) Perhaps I should&#39;ve just ordered the regular ones. Portions aside, the sushi was just okay. I&#39;ve had much better. Taste wise, I&#39;d compare it to any Chinese owned sushi restaurant in Queens. Given the location, prices are decent. It is what it is. I should&#39;ve just gotten ramen at Ippudo instead. Would&#39;ve cost the same, but I would&#39;ve been quite full at least.
I doubt I&#39;ll return, there are better sushi restaurants in the area."

A friend of mine took us to El Mate last night. I don&#39;t drink alcohol, and couldn&#39;t seem to explain to the waitress that I just wanted a hot mate tea, so I wound up with an iced mate tea (with simple syrup), I liked it. I did ask for no ice second time as the flavor of mate is so much more potent that way. 

We ordered calamari and empanadas for starters. The empanadas were so very good, very close to what I remember falling in love with in Argentina.

My friends all ordered steaks (medium), and I had the tilapia. The steaks were delicious, perfectly tender and red in the middle. I would say they came out more medium-rare than medium, but that didn&#39;t bother anyone. Personal opinion--better than Peter Luger&#39;s. My fish though, that was the cherry on top. Perfectly flavored (just the right amount of capers), supremely buttery, but with a browned crust. I inhaled every bite. The spinach it came with was delicious, but the caramelized mashed sweet potatoes, well I&#39;ll be duplicating that recipe at home. 

At the end of the evening they even gave us a piece of flan on the house. We were so full that we couldn&#39;t finish it, but the bites we took were great. Not too sweet, as I always fear flan will be, but with a great smokey dulce de leche flavor. 

Thanks for a great meal!"

The meat was  literally falling off the bone and melted in your mouth like butter. The risotto was cooked perfectly and the empanadas had a homemade taste to them. I would of sworn someone&#39;s grandma was back there cooking the food. Lol

I had the Milanesa Clasica with chimichurri ontop and lemon. Wow wow wow wow what a filling meal... and maybe people will be turned off by the breading, but if you pour lemon juice and chimichurri it becomes easier to cut and adds a kick to the meal.

But the guava and cream cheese mousse ... dat mousse. It took me back to my childhood. Just so creamy and the fruit flavor just right. 

My entourage and I sat in the back outside, which is great for the evenings. 

Service was awesome - and attractive !"

Ive been on the search for an Argentinean restaurant in Brooklyn for awhile. I visited the country last year and i really loved their empanadas and steak.. Oh and totally fell in love with their blood sausage.

When i called, the staff told to just come in, no need for rsvps. It was Sunday evening. I thought thas odd since there were so many good reviews on Yelp i thought the place would be packed.

I must say from the minute we stepped in the service was impeccable. The staff was very welcoming, patient and just overall super nice.

We ordered a bunch of items, iced mate (totally did not know they have that!!! Without alcohol cos my mom do not drink. I had a sip and it was SO refreshing!!!), the platter with blood sausage, chorizo and some other fried meat (sorry i dont know the actual names of the dishes we ordered), beef empanadas and chicken empanadas, rib eye steak, skirt steak, tilapia dish, and chicken milanese!

We loved the fact that they gave us chimichurri sauce to dip, asked for hot sauce (yum) and some other brownish texture sauce but mixed them all together and everything went so well w it!

Loved the empanadas! My bf and sis said they liked the blood sausage here better than Balvanera (another Argentina restaurant but in LES, Manhattan). Im jus happy i found blood sausage

We all enjoyed our food. My gf who&#39;s Argentinean told me that they only cook their meats w salt and i love the simplicity of that becos it truly brings out the flavor of the meat. Well, with that said, loved our steaks, filled with flavor, cooked perfectly and juicy

Restaurant decor is simple, clean and their bathroom even have Listerine mouthwash w cups for u to rinse after ur meal.

Lovely, lovely place. Will definitely be back."

I was actually headed somewhere totally different near by until I saw the perfect 5 star rating. I knew I had to stop. The ratings are certainly accurate. This place is top notch. The food is FRESH made with pure ingredients and the menu is one of a kind. You can actually taste the flavors in everything you are eating. We sat in the backyard area which was very calm. It was very crowded inside. The backyard was full as well but the tables were more spaced out. Now onto the food!!

For the table:
Bread with house made chimichurri sauce and a light tomato sauce. Both were excellent. 

Apps:
Eggplant &amp; Goat cheese empanada: Really good! This was fresh eggplant chopped up in the back with warm goat cheese. So unique and delicious.

Beef empanada: The beef was seasoned VERY well. Definitely enjoyed this.

Entrees:
Skirt Steak with Yucca mash: The steak was delicious but unfortunately I hated the yuca mash. The flavor was off and it was whipped too much. That was the only thing we had that I actually did not like but again the steak was delicious.

Cheeseburger: So good! The burger was so juicy and tender!

Veggie Risotto: My favorite dish of the night! This risotto is amazing. I love meat and I didn&#39;t care that there was none in it, this was so fantastic!!! The rice was cooked just right it was perfect!! I would absolutely recommend this dish

Overall the service was very friendly. This is a REALLY nice spot in Brooklyn, cant wait to go back!"

Being Argentinean I am so glad I don&#39;t have to trek to Queens to find a wonderful Argentine restaurant. My mother was in town and we wanted to try a place local in Brooklyn. I was highly pleased, it also got mi mama&#39;s approval so that means a lot! 

Wonder why this place has 5 stars! We tried the entra√±a with the chimichurri sauce and it was delicious! The empanadas as well were great as an appetizer. There was also $7 house wines of malbec ---- yes please! 

The ambiance is decorated with art local to Argentina, and of course photos of mate everywhere. The service was the best I have had in a long time. I even think it was even the owner that personally came to our table and greeted us as well. Such friendly people and if it wasn&#39;t so hot, I would have sat in the backyard. I saw that they had a beautiful backyard patio that I want try out next time I come. 

Perfect for a date, your friends, or family. The portions are big enough to split if you get some appetizers as well. Strongly recommend this place! El Mate got 5 strong stars in my book."

Easy walk from the train - about 2 blocks from the station.  I&#39;m not sure about parking though aside from it&#39;s all street parking - typical for NY though.  

The place itself has low light, and while there&#39;s a decent amount of seating, the tables themselves are teeny tiny and pretty close together.  Keep those elbows in!

Service... eh.  This was lacking in some ways, but pretty good in others.  They weren&#39;t incredibly attentive with much at all.  Apparently there was no one to take our order at first (but then there were two - lack of communication perhaps), water glasses were more often empty than filled, food came way out of order if at all, and it was just interesting bc the restaurant was not packed by any means.  I sort of understand when there&#39;s a full house, but when there are only a handful of parties, this really shouldn&#39;t have been an issue we had to face.  The entrees&#39; sides came out first, then the main part of the entrees a bit later.  We asked for the appetizer ordered, and they had forgotten.  At least they were nice enough to take one of the apps off the bill.

Beef Empanadas : Alright... these were pretty bomb.  By far the best empanada I&#39;ve ever had.  The filling was wonderful, and the dough was pretty out of this world.  Just be careful of any oil from the meat that might be pooled inside... it might squeeze out on one of your bites if it hasn&#39;t already drained out.
Ribeye with Sweet Potato Fries : Fries, fantastic.  Lots of sweet potato inside and good variety of crispy and ...not crispy ones (soggy nor steaky work here...O.o)  Steak... eh.  Pretty sad that I spent as much money as I did on it.  I&#39;ve definitely had much better, and I was pretty disappointed that the steak itself was flavorless and tough to chew.  You&#39;ll definitely need the chimichurri sauce to get you through.  However, my friend seemed to like it; at least enough that he ate the rest of my dish lol
Flan : This was pretty good and pretty dense lol I do wish it had a bit more flavor between both the custardy egginess and the caramel sugary sweetness, but again, still good.

I&#39;d say that if you&#39;re craving a good steak, this probably isn&#39;t the place to come, but perhaps some of the other food would be more worth trying."

The beef empanada was good. The pastry was nicely fried but the filling could have been better. We also shared a mixed grill and actually most of their meats are on the lower-quality side. At least it&#39;s not overpriced for what you get. The smaller pieces of sweetbreads were good, but the larger ones were too chewy to eat.

We sat outside in the lovely garden and ordered quickly although they did not rush us. They  brought out bread and chimichuri and salsa. The sauces were amazing best I&#39;ve had in a long time. 

For dinner we 
Had the empanadas - tried everything but the pork. Chicken was ok so was the other meat but the veggie ones were great especially the spinach omg.

Then 2 skirt steaks as per the yelp consensus that they are awesome and they were in fact quite good.

The yucca mash was a bit bland...the rice and beans has pork so could not comment but hubby seemed to enjoy it. 

For dessert I was torn btwn the passion fruit and finally went with the mate molten lava cake  hard decision but certainly the right one.

Enjoyed the sangria as well its freshly made when you order none of the pre mixed stuff which is a nice touch.

Re-read the responses to anyone who has been critical of your restaurant. 

We live in NYC, there are thousands of great restaurants to choose from. Instead of learning from the feedback customers give you and moving on, you&#39;re maturity is lacking.

Don&#39;t take it personally my friend, just work harder to make it better. Not everyone will like it, and you won&#39;t please everyone. Are you new in the food and service industry?

Again, the food was bland. And no need for the history lesson. If you really want to be guachos style, then stop having an identity crisis and become a churasscaria and update the menu to that. It is definitely NOT authentic Brazilian.

The student program is a great! But train them! Don&#39;t just throw thrm to them on the deep end of the pool and have them figure it out on their own. You took the risk to put him in front of your customers, and it resulted in a poor experience. A passionate restauranteur would own it."

The hubby and I decided to give this place a try after seeing it had 5 solid stars (which is difficult now a days to be honest) but we can now see why.. 

What we ordered:

Chorizo and beef empanadas - soooo good and don&#39;t get me started on their sauces, their chimichuri and I believe was an eggplant based one.. OMG!! 
Brazilian soup (which was their soup special) but can&#39;t remember the actual name  it was potato puree based with kale and small pieces of ham - also very good!
For entr√©e we shared the skirt steak which came with a side, rice and beans (delish) and we had to order the mashed yucca as everyone mentioned it was a must, and it sure is!! 

The portions are pretty large, we actually had left overs and even though we didn&#39;t it to dessert, the manager treated us to a passion fruit mouse on the house, which was very tasty, light and very nice on their behalf.

All in all I can see why this place has such great reviews, their drinks are great and mixed well, the staff is friendly, the place is cute with an outdoor garden area, and let&#39;s not leave out their amazing flavorful food!

All plates were wiped clean or taken to go.

They accommodated our large party outside on their beautiful outdoor patio and treated us to complimentary pina colada shots, which were amazing as well! 

Out of everything we tried my favorites were the empanadas, the steak, pureed sweet potato, gnocchi, and the pina colada shots! But I&#39;m honestly not sure you could go wrong on this menu! Everything tasted so authentic! A few notes I will make are that the sweet potato tasted so fresh. Not exactly like mashed sweet potato, because it retained more of the original consistency. The gnocchi had a sweetness to it that I absolutely loved. The risotto did a bit as well. I tried so many different dishes and they all complimented each other so well.

The Answer to this review, Would we come back Yes in a heartbeat, the service was extremely attentive and we had the Argentinian waitress which was wonderful. So come can give them a try you will not be disappointed."

I love steak. I went with my dad and we were not sure what to order since it was our first time and just found the place on yelp. The server was very helpful and funny. You could tell that he really wanted us to enjoy our meal and have a great experience.

 We went with the blood sausage and a rib eye steak as well as some chicken empanadas. It was all great. Although there are so many restaurants to choose from in New York, we would come back to this one!"

They have the most delicious Argentinean-Brazilian food. Their empanadas are classic with different stuffings you can choose from. If you&#39;re a meat lover, I highly recommend Parillada. It has a great variation of tasteful meats. As for the sides, I have no words to describe how amazing Mashed Yucca is!!!!! You can pair this side with mostly any of the entrees in their menu. Their food is not the only best thing here but also the drinks and dessert. They have such an intricate detailing in the way they prepare their foods. 

In conclusion, Everything is great starting when you walk in with customer service and ending with a dessert. This restaurant is a definition of perfection. They go above above beyond with everything they do."

First of all, my boyfriend is the pickiest eater. Like a 5 year old stuck in a grown man&#39;s body. And 2 days later he&#39;s still telling people about the date night we had:)

Now....on to the food. We had the empanadas to start (chicken, beef, and spinach). You have to try the spinach. HAVE TO. Then, the entra√±a. Cooked by the steak god himself to perfection. Sides were rice and beans and saut√©ed kale. I polished off the whole plate of kale as it landed on the table. Everything was fresh and made perfectly.

The drinks were good but too small for me so if you&#39;re a lush, order the sangria or a glass of wine. The ambiance is perfect for dates and they definitely played authentic music all night!

And finally the staff. This place must be really good to their staff because they were absolutely wonderful! I didn&#39;t get her name but our waitress was so sweet and answered every question without a hint of an attitude  (and trust me, we asked plenty of questions). And she has really great skin so that place can&#39;t be stressing her out lol

P.S.-The mate is very....interesting. I stayed up till 3am."

We had the chicken and picadillo empanadas, delicious! After that we shared the parrillada because we wanted to try different meats. All of them were cooked to perfection, tender and juicy.

The empanadas I had were stuffed with eggplant and goat cheese- which I usually don&#39;t enjoy on its own, but I was intrigued by the combination. The short rib was tender and cooked to perfection. Finally, my tiramisu and my brothers dulce de lece crepes were the perfect end.

We were in the neighborhood at Other Half and starving. We yelped this place and it sounded amazing. 
I&#39;m originally from Paraguay, so I&#39;m very picky with my South American food, especially food from Argentina. The Empanadas were incredibly authentic! The dough is amazing and made in house (i asked). We had the ham and cheese, chicken, and beef. Not one disappointed.
The boy and I shared the Milanesa a caballo for our entree. Noms! 
It was just the right portion for sure. He also decided to order mashed yucca. I&#39;m so glad he did. It was the most delicious way to eat yucca ever!
For dessert we had the dulce de leche crepes. It was the right amount of sweet after the yummy meal we had.
The ambiance is cozy but not crowded and super clean. The staff is super friendly, inviting, and attentive. People love it so much that they had at least ten regulars walk in there while we were there. So glad we stumbled in here."

Everything was delicious. Fernando the waiter was extremely pleasant, I didn&#39;t get the name of the female who was also very nice and gave us dessert on the house. The only reason I&#39;m giving four stars and not five is because the portions could be a little bigger.

To offset the meat, get the house salad, which has lots of ingredients and is big enough for probably 2-3 people. The service was also on point!

Empanadas, Skirt Steak, Chimichurri, Polenta, Milanesa with the Fried Eggs, Yucca Mash, and then the Flan for dessert, not to mention the drinks! From the moment we walked in, Fernando greeted us with cocktail recommendations and wine samplings: Malbecs and Syrahs along with the traditional acai cocktail. 

A special thank you to Fernando and staff for such a great night out. I can honestly say I&#39;ve never experienced such wonderful, personable service before.  Fernando really cares about your time at the restaurant and takes great pride in his culture. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  Already thinking about who we should bring with us the next time we go.  Wow!

This place is new and a true find if you like Brazilian and Argentinian cuisine.  As traditional with both cuisines, there are lots of steak options which are prepared and cooked to perfection.   Everything here is home made, from the chimichurri sauce to the wide variety of empanadas to the delicious desserts.  There are vegetarian options as well (I highly recommend the cannelloni, sweet potato fries and kale salad, yum!)

They also have a very nice selection of south american wines, which are very reasonably priced.  

Great ambiance in the restaurant itself, and there&#39;s lots of room outside on the patio as well if you prefer to dine al fresca.  

Very friendly staff from the waiters to the bartender to the owners, who are always around ensuring their customers are happy.

Having sampled 100+ street food vendors/kiosks, I can confidently say that Coney Shack is the BEST street food in NYC. I still fail to grasp how this gem exists in a remote corner of Coney Island,  but again maybe that&#39;s what gems are all about.

The food is a wonderful fusion of Vietnamese food prepared in Mexican/American methods.

The lemongrass chicken burrito and holy phuc stood out of all others for me.

Only one caveat to my review is that the hours on Yelp may be unreliable so just send them a text. I&#39;m fortunate enough to travel to Coney Island weekly for work and I try to text the owner to see if they are open that day. 

So, skip the &#34;famous&#34; boardwalk spots without hesitation and stuff yourself with Coney Shack&#39;s delicious food instead."

Very happy that I did! Coney Shack is not just delicious-- it&#39;s fun and creative. So often, &#34;fusion,&#34; is weighed down by being pretentious, when it has the opportunity to be fun and irreverent. This is a punk take on korean tacos, which for better and for worse, are kinda their own genre now. These tacos are much, much better than what you&#39;ll get at, for example, Korilla, The taco fillings are a cut above-- the pork belly just a little bit crisper, the battered fish just a little lighter and more flavorful, but the composition really sells the whole thing.

I also very much enjoyed a hot dog there, the legendary Holy Phuc. It is a little bit of a stunt, with the hot dog and the battered fish and the many toppings, but man, the whole thing really comes together. Highly recommend."

HOLY PHUC, is what it&#39;s called, and that&#39;s what you will be screamin&#39; after the first bite. 

#foodgasm, #mouth-watering, #addictive, #foodporn, #perfection-personified, #life-changing, #best I have ever had, #to die for, #out of this world. Those are just a few of the hashtags floating around social media when describing Coney Shack&#39;s fish / hotdog concoction. 

You want to know why? Just listen to the ingredients, and you will understand:
     It starts out with a beef frankfurter, and a beer battered crunchy fish - basa from the catfish family - in a hot dog bun (yes, you heard right, fish in a hot dog!). Then it gets Sprinkled with some pickled red onions, and drizzled with three types of sauces: tomato basil creole sauce, scallion oil, &amp; lemongrass aioli. To put &#34;the cherry on the cake&#34; they top it with a four cheese blend. By then, the Brulee torch will come out, and finish the job by melting the cheese, adding the burnt texture that makes their hotdog creation so irresistible. 

In simple words, despite the HOLY PHUC having a wide range of bold, and contrasting flavors, the flavors, somehow, balanced each other out perfectly. The individual flavor notes still came through, adding an extra dimension of heartiness and satisfaction to the dish. 

_________

I know what some of you might think. Here we go again with yet another gimmicky combo! (Burgers in Rice buns, etc.) I mean c&#39;mon, how on planet earth is this not a recipe for disaster?!? With all the contrasting and conflicting flavors in it... Truth be told, I was skeptical as well. Till I took the first bite. 

The flavor of the burnt crispy cheese on top, 
the fatty flaky fish taste, 
the freshness of the soft bun, 
the rich umami flavor of the frank. 
      Include in all this, the exotic flavors, that the three sauces bring to the table, and it&#39;s a full on Orchestra. Though playing to different flavor notes, come together in harmonic rhythm to orchestrate a truly unique and expansive flavor profile. 

What&#39;s ironic, is that this unique gastronomic masterpiece is sold, out of a food truck, in an unassuming spot, not far from the Coney island boardwalk. So go grab some before the lines become bigger, and prices higher.

~ Cash only
~ Food truck
~ Holy phuc, &amp; fish tacos are a must try
~ It&#39;s adjacent to the DMV building

OK, so I didn&#39;t get to try their most popular items, like the burritos or bowls, because they were out of rice, but I did help myself to a Chicka Dog for $6. 

First, you might ask, how do they run out of rice? Yes, there were logistic and man power problems on full display when I visited their cart the day I went. Unfortunately, they had to turn away many customers because of their lack of ingredients and, to make matters worse, they were short on people so the wait for food just grew and grew and grew. 

Second, $6 for a hot dog? Yes, I paid $6 for a hot dog from them and it was freaking awesome! The Chicka Dog was an all beef dog topped with garlic lemongrass chicken, pickle, diakon, cilantro, long pepper, lemongrass aioli, sweet chili spicy mayo, onions, toasted sesame. That&#39;s a lot of ingredients, but it mixed so well and it was a very delicious dog! Even though there were so many ingredients, the dog was normal sized. I wish they had cooked a jumbo dog because it would have been so much more worth it then.

I&#39;m hoping the truck visits the FiDi again sometime soon because I&#39;m still dying to try one of their burritos as their menu made my mouth water."

(!) WHAT WE GOT: The three taco special: Lemongrass chicken; Vietnamese shortrib; Crunchy fish, and the Holy Phuc hot dog

(!) HOW IT DID: The tacos (3 for $9)... oh my goodness, they were amazing! My honeybunny, who&#39;s Vietnamese herself, was skeptical and wondered how these Vietnamese ingredients would do on a taco. She, like me, was very impressed by all of them but was pleasantly surprised by the lemongrass chicken. She said she&#39;d never been down for a chicken taco but I was like, &#34;Bebz, have you never tried DelTaco&#39;s chicken tacos?? Come on...&#34; The Holy Phuc ($5), I don&#39;t know if it was that we were kind of full already but I thought it was too much.... would&#39;ve traded that one for another order of tacos haha.

(!) WHERE IT&#39;S AT: It&#39;s not a flashy stand. Honestly I was worried we passed it or it was closed but it&#39;s past the police and fire station. It&#39;s located at the end of a parking lot past another food stand.

(!) TIDBITS: $9 card minimum, but I presume you could get cash at this store next door but I&#39;m not sure. Or better yet, if you don&#39;t meet the minimum, order more tacos. You won&#39;t have any regrets!"

But I really wanted some hot food that would hit the spot, and Im glad I found Coney Shack. This place has awesome food, the 3 tacos for $9 is definitely a good deal for the variety of flavors you get. I got the calamari taco, viet short rib taco, and the Holy Phuc hot dog. Calamari taco was my favorite, since it had the perfect amount of five spice in it. The short rib taco was tender and flavorful. The holy phuc hot dog was an explosion of different tastes and textures. The fried fish on top worked well with the torched cheese on top. 

There are many other items on the menu that I wouldve definitely tried in the same sitting if i wasnt limited by my stomach size and wallet. They got  Hainan chicken, which I love but rarely see outside of restaurants. Its cool to see them have this as most asian fusion taco places generally have the same food combos. Next time I must try more. 

Seating is limited to two picnic tables as it is outside, but its not uncommon to see customers eat standing in front of the cart. Thankfully this place is practically next to the beach, so taking your food to go eat on the beach would not be a bad idea."

So I finally made my way over during the Mermaid Parade. After all, who can turn down Asian fusion tacos?

It&#39;s one guy inside a cart parked in an alley next to a convenience store. He was supposed to open at noon, but he was running late and was super apologetic about it. Ended up waiting 20 minutes for him to open, but once he started going, food was coming out quick and it was totally worth it.

They have all sorts of tacos available, at $3.50 each or three for $9. I&#39;m a sucker for a good deal (against my stomach&#39;s better judgment), so of course I housed three tacos.

I went with the beer battered fish, Vietnamese beef cube shortrib, and the garlic lemongrass chicken. That was the order I ate them in, and also the order of my prference. The fish taco was probably the best fish taco I&#39;ve ever had. It was fried Asian style, so with tempura for extra crispiness. The lemongrass aioli on top was just wonderful. All the flavors went together really well.

The shortrib taco was good, but was way overshadowed by the fish. The beef was marinated well and the spicy mayo gave it a kick. Would do that one again.

The lemongrass chicken taco was kind of boring, but was a solid taco.

Love that they have a ton of hot sauces available for you to use. There&#39;s also a picnic bench in the parking lot so you don&#39;t have to stand around and eat like a loser.

I have found the one place in all of South Brooklyn to bestow my first 5 star review.  This is quality eats for cheap.  A tiny food cart tucked away at the corner of a parking lot(and to the right of the DMV bldg), easily missed, but definitely NOT to be missed, has answered my prayers.

This is a one man show- he answered the phone to give me directions when I got lost(what&#39;s new?), he fried me up some fresh fish, and he accepted my offerings of cash &amp; blood.

About 5-8 minutes later, I was given a heavenly looking delight, the Holy Phuc.  A hot dog topped with beer battered fish, sprinkled with onions, cheddar and layered with tomato basil creole &amp; lemongrass aioli sauces.  My best advice: open your mouth wide.  You need to experience all these ingredients together.  It will deliver a nice roundhouse kick to your face.  The only kind acceptable outside of a Karate Kid movie.

As I was pressed for time, and I mean I was en route to dinner- ha!- I did not get to experience the tacos.  Since they offer the flaky fish covered with crunchy batter in taco form, I&#39;d recommend getting that.

You can sit your bum down on one of the few picnic tables and have your day&#39;s worth of meals here, or grab and go.  Coney Shack is the reason for the long lines at the DMV.  Did you accidentally shred your license?  Time for a replacement."

I confess I&#39;m more a traditional Mexican taco type of guy, and was searching for those, but short on time, in the neighborhood, so went out on a limb here.. And do glad I did!! 

Consider theses tacos the creme de la creme of the taco world. Gourmet style ingredients and combinations that would be entrees at a traditional resturant, portioned out to fill fresh soft tortias. I did an order of the short ribs, garlic pork, calamari, and the crunchy fish.. My favorites were the crunchy fish, which was awesome due to the textures and flavor contrasts of it, I see more of these in my future. The fish was perfect, fresh &amp; crunchy.. The garlic pork being a close second, very flavorful, easily eaten without worry of any tender morsels escaping, a problem I had with the calamari and short ribs.. The calamari themselves were awesome and should be sold by alone, unadulterated.. Maybe with a little dipping sauce.. It&#39;s that good. 

Even though I ate four tacos, I don&#39;t feel as if I&#39;m weighted down or binged on junk food, as some taco experiences have in the past. The tacos are topped with all the freshest ingredients, many veggies, so I guess they provide balance to the bolder ingredients, and make me feel I made a heathy choice.

let the artist do his work, tell him you&#39;re hungry and let him pick. don&#39;t be a whiner, no greens, no onions, no this, no that. just take it like a man (or woman) and get what you get! $14.95 and I&#39;m floating on cloud nine. 

the food is fantastic. service is fantastic. they take credit cards! fantastic! and it was almost 70 degrees out today. 

life does not get better. 

try this place.

you&#39;ll thank me."

Shortrib is great, chicken is okay, fish is great but watch out for your breath


I got a trio of tacos for $11 - Viet shortrib, lemongrass chicken, and fried fish.

Shortrib - on the sweet side, very tender and beefy though!
Lemongrass Chicken - definitely a bit too sweet and too salty on this one, but very juicy
Fish - fried well and the crisp slaw on top is great. However, the fish lingered on my breath all day despite me having the other tacos as well. Watch out.

If I had one complaint, it would be that the proteins are all a little over-seasoned and each taco has a rich, mayo-based sauce. It&#39;s a bit heavy and strongly flavored all over the board and if they cut back a bit, I think everything would be a bit more balanced and perfect for lunch."

I get the 4.5 star rating because the food is absolutely bombdotcom from the good fellas over at Coney Shack.  I didn&#39;t catch his name, but the person taking our order was incredibly personable too. Totes wouldn&#39;t mind being friends with these awesome chefs.

Anyhow, hubby and I ordered 2 of the 3 for $9 taco specials: 
1 short rib
1 chicken
1 pork
2 calamari
1 fish

I didn&#39;t have any of the rib, chicken, or pork, but hubby said they were all delicious.  Only thing is, they kind of tasted the same.  Not a terrible thing by any means.  We both found the calamari tacos to be tender and chewy, but not as flavorful as the others.  The fish taco for me was absolutely ROCKIN&#39;.  I mean, this was battered to CMagic perfection.  The slaw + sauce toppings were perfect too.  I wouldn&#39;t mind eating 3 of these on its own.

So yes, we will be back --- many many many a times over."

I had met up with a few friends and they eagerly waited for tacos as we arrived. Clearly we needed to have a few of our own. The tacos are all specialty and prepared when you order them so expect a wait if there is a line of people before you. Thankfully, he was ready to take our order as he finished up my friends.  We ordered three: fish, chicken and beef. After a few minutes we grabbed our tacos to walk and eat while heading to the parade. I don&#39;t like fish much but the fish taco had a great flavor and the fish was very nicely breaded and fried. The chicken was made with dark meat so it was a bit fatty which played nicely with the kimichi/vinegar flavors of the toppings. The beef was a bit tough but the toppings made it more enjoyable.  

I think I would have enjoyed it more if I enjoyed fish more in general.  That taco seemed to be the best of the three we got. So If you are not into seafood, either suck it up and get it anyway, or just find other tacos to enjoy!"

I came here because I was craving fish tacos. They do it justice and with a southeast Asian twist, eg basa fish, lemongrass aioli. Crunchy and sufficiently meaty bites. The guy working the stand told me that they intentionally single layer the flour tortilla. It definitely puts the focus on the fillings which is great. The short rib is also really tasty.

If I could marry a taco, this is the taco I&#39;d marry. 

Drenched in sauces, the meats are tender and fully flavored. You will feel like you got slapped by the Flavor Goddess. Crunchy and cold cabbage contrasted by sizzling savory meats. Crackling crispy tofu partnered with warm soft tortilla. And all the hot sauces you need are near the cart. 

Do yourself a favor, unless you&#39;re a tourist, skip Nathan&#39;s, walk a few blocks and gorge yourself on the true taste of Brooklyn--a strange, amazing meld of all the food culture of New York IN ONE DAMN HOT DOG. Seriously.

And btw some tips: if you go at the end of the day and throw hissy fit cause they are out of the mushroom or pork..you&#39;re an idiot. This is a food truck not a restaurant. Order more than you think you want. This place goes against the laws of food nature--whereby one orders more food than they&#39;ll actually eat.

I think it can make or break a business, and I must say this is by far the WORST attitude I ever encountered in NYC. I sincerely hope the owner does something about this. 
I went there on Sunday, August 21, 2016, and the vendor was a fat, tattooed Asian guy who was plain rude to every customer when we were there, including ourselves. I am surprised he hasn&#39;t been punched in the face yet. He was dripping with sarcasm to the customer before us, and when it was our turn, when my card was charged, he asked if I wanted to give a tip on the card. We said we will give the tip by cash, and he went on to ramble about how he hates liars and that he encountered a woman who said the same thing about giving the tip in cash and ended up not doing it. Even if he didn&#39;t deserve it, we still gave him a tip in cash anyway. While we were waiting for our order, the next customer was a father and daughter tandem, and the father just wanted a plain hotdog in a bun for his daughter. He asked the vendor if it was possible, and the guy said it was, then told off the father for being &#34;stupid&#34; the way he requested his order.
What the actual f*ck.

We get that it is a food truck, it is NOT a restaurant and we are not expecting a five-star service whatsoever, but being RUDE is NOT an EXCUSE. I buy from food trucks, too, and I do not get such NASTY, despicable attitude from them.

And after quietly stalking them on Twitter, I have discovered they are in the Fidi area on select Tuesdays. Or at least that&#39;s what the pattern seemed to conclude. Analyst life. 

After a failed Sunday attempt to visit the infamous coney shack, I was frantically stalking them on Twitter Tuesday morning in high hopes they will be around the financial district for lunch.. Thank goodness they were. Yay for my taco fix! I made my way down old slip and water street in search of the black food truck. 

I discovered a discombobulated line and a cute girl taking the food orders. I ordered the combo deal of 3 tacos - Vietnamese beef short rib, five spice calamari and beer battered fish tacos.

~ 3 tacos for $11 and $4 per individual taco whereas compared to Brooklyn, it is 3 tacos for $9 or $3.50 per individual taco.  The pricing makes sense considering the location in prime downtown Manhattan. 

~ Vietnamese beef short rib taco 5/5 stars - this is my favorite taco of the trio that I ordered. The short rib was extremely tender and full of flavor. 
The pickled daikon and spicy mayo really put the Asian twist together. 

~ Five spice Calarami &amp; Beer battered crunchy fish tacos 3.8/5 - interesting combination of flavors on both and I like it. But the Calarami and fish were barely warm. 

My coworkers were definitely drooling over my delicious lunch. 
 
.*_.**_.*_*._**._.**._.**._.**.*.*_.**.**_***_*._**._**._*.

- My boyfriend &amp; I stopped by for some quick bites this afternoon at the Coney Island location. Ordered the same trio of tacos and the porky pork burrito ($9). 

~ Thit Ko porky pork burrito 4.2/5 stars - I really liked the Malay hainan rice and all the filings incorporated inside the burrito. Kind of reminds me of fried rice stuffed into a burrito :) 

One thing to note is the fidi location added in 2 wedges of lime in my order but no limes at the CI location. I strongly believe limes highly help enhance the flavor and can make it or break it.

All in all, these tacos &amp; burritos are super delicious and I&#39;m loving the Asian meets Mexican fusion. I love all the fresh ingredients and garnishes. Awesome twist and combination of spices and flavors."

I ordered 2 lemon grass tacos and 1 beef short rib taco. I was disappointed with the beef short rib because of a bad after taste it had. The beef didn&#39;t taste fresh so I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. But the lemon grass chicken was really good. The chicka hot dog was my favorite, it had so much flavor.

I have only visited the truck, so I cannot comment on atmosphere or wait times, because I walked right up and did not wait at all to place my order. I had my food less than five minutes later, and was drooling a few minutes after that.
Tasty and surprisingly complex flavors in all three tacos. Trust me, get them with everything on them."

For all my Foodies and Yelpers... You should definitely give this small taco truck a try. It&#39;s not very hard to find but its confusing for first timers. It should be next to the precinct but inside a parking lot. It is right next to the shops that follow up from the precinct (I hope this helps). My boyfriend and I enjoyed the chicken more than that short rib and the fish. It was so tasty. But I recommend trying all three (3 for $9).

Time for some borscht, caviar, and tacos. However, this isn&#39;t your usual taco joint. There&#39;s no indoor seating, no Hispanic staff (as far as I saw), and no Jarritos soda. 

Order literally any taco on the menu. I&#39;m not big on meat so I get the Oyster mushroom, tofu, and fish tacos but I imagine the pork and beef ones taste great. My stars, these things melt in your mouth while providing the perfect crunch to start. They&#39;re smothered in sauce, they&#39;re delicious, they&#39;re made fresh every single time. 

The beverage selection is great- San Pellegrino sodas on deck. There&#39;s some wooden tables behind the stand, or you can eat on the little metal counter if there&#39;s space. I have yet to try the rice ball, I imagine it&#39;s delicious.

They have interesting tacos like beer battered fish and calamari. Not that I got either because they were sold out already...

So instead, we got the Vietnamese pork and short rib tacos and the hot dog is covered in the same pork I believe. The pork is much tastier (but oily) than the beef in my opinion. You have to be careful though because the fish sauce smelled up the office and everyone came over to comment (a lot of people do not like the smell of fish sauce). I liked the pickled radishes on top which reminded me of bahn mi but with way less bread (only one flour tortilla). Its IMPOSSIBLE to eat this without having everything fall out.

The hot dog was your typical snappy casing hot dog (aka great) and topped with pork. They even have one that&#39;s land and sea, meat plus fried fish! I love love love the smell of the cheese they blowtorch melted on top. A bit pricey for a normal sized hot dog though. I was expecting a thicker polish beef dog with more bite."

Though the location of it is small, the food inside was OMG GOOD

We ordered the top 3 favorite tacos which are the Calamari, Beef and Fish. The Calamari was a little chewy but still really good. It was also very different from how I normally have it. The Beef was just omgosh. I wanted more. I was also very lucky cuz usually they run out of beef during the day. My favorite one was surprisingly the Fish. It was SO crispy on the outside and the inside was just soft like mashed potatoes. Okay maybe not that soft but the combination of hard and soft was amazing.

My son also got the beef grilled cheese. You have to keep in mind that he is a picky eater but he demanded a second one right after. We also tried the Holy Dog as a bonus and thats a hot dog with a fried fish on top. I was stuffed but really wanted to finish it.

Overall this place surprised me. I loved every thing they put into the taco. Just the right amount and really makes you want to go back for more.

This food is the reason why Trump can never become president; it is Mexican/Vietnamese fusion, a blending of cultures that only happens like this in America. 

But seriously tho, it&#39;s that good. The crispy fish is just the right balance of crunch and meat, slathered in a white sauce that has a slight tingle. The lemongrass chicken is tender, juicy, lemony without being overbearing. And the short ribs. Oh god, the short ribs. Sweet, savory, juicy, all is right in the world when you bite into this. 

If you&#39;re in Coney Island, forget Nathan&#39;s. Come here. It&#39;s the silver shack right past the 8th street station. Hell, if you&#39;re in New York City, go to Coney Island just to go here. It&#39;s that good."

For all three tacos, there was a nice balance of protein and the veggies, although the fish taco was just slightly too heavy on the shredded cabbage.

The first time I tried:
1. Five spice squid (Fried Squid with 5 spice, pickled red onion, cilantro-Lemongrass Aioli, tomato basil creole sauce, scallion, and toasted sesame)

2. Glazed Pork (Pork caramelized in Vietnamese marinade, pickled daikon, cilantro, pickled peppers, sweet chili spicy mayo, and toasted sesame)

3. Short rib taco&#39;s (Beef short ribs in  Vietnamese marinade, pickled daikon, cilantro, pickled peppers, sweet chili spicy mayo, and toasted sesame). 

As others said it was an amazing trio !!!!  

The second time i went there i tried a few of the hotdog combinations: 
1. Mach Dog - Hotdog with Garlic glazed pork, onion rings, melted cheese, sweet chili mayo, sriracha, and toasted sesame. 

2. Holy Phuc - Hotdog with beer battered fish, pickled red onion, melted cheese, tomato basil creole sauce, and lemon grass aioli.

My inner food snob had a tantrum that could rival a two year olds.... how could anything of quality or culinary value be turned out from the least likely little corner of brooklyn, nestled between a dmv and a parking lot. This is not a foodie section of town... but oh was I wrong. So, so wrong. And now, now I have anxiety knowing this place is here, in my stomping grounds, too close for comfort. 

Dramatics aside, do yourself a favor...
Get the tacos. Get three. Get the pork, the succulent, delicious, garlic pork. It reminded me of the best roast pork buns I&#39;ve ever had. It was fall apart. 
The Vietnamese short rib was excellent. 
The calamari was battered, crispy, delicious... but I committed to loving the pork. 

The grilled cheese with chicken was like the yummiest hang over food you could want. As was the Mach Dog. Loved the caramelized pork in it.

Only give it four stars because I have so much more to try!!!"

I went with my friend and split a carafe of sake &amp; then we ordered pressed sushi with salmon cucumber &amp; avocado as well as blackened cod and an egg custard with shrimp &amp; scallops. Everything tasted AMAZING. The flavors were great but didn&#39;t overpower. I really enjoyed the custard with its buttery flavor - it was something else!

The waitstaff was incredibly nice, attentive and kind. Plus they also suggested some food and sake for us to try. 

Overall this is an amazing restaurant for dinner - though I hear lunch specials are pretty great too! It&#39;s a great date spot and conveniently located in downtown Brooklyn. 

I cannot wait to go back and try something else on the menu!!"

I order two rolls for lunch. It took them over 30mins to make it. On top of that, they gave me the wrong roll!

It is perfect for a date night which you can actually have a conversation. The service was good. We got the five chef selection, braised pork, salmon fried rice and salmon avocado roll. The five was delicious. It was fresh. I love the salmon avocado roll. I like how they put mint leaf on it which gave it a refreshing kick. The braised pork is a must get. The soup base was delicious. The pork was fat and juicy. The salmon fried rice was different than what I had in mind. It was special of the day. When I took a bit, it reminded me of rice cake. The rice is fried in a square and top w salmon. This dish was ok. Overall, I enjoyed every last bite in this restaurant. 

I came here a second time. This time I got the poke and yuzu shrimps. The yuzu shrimps were very crispy and rich in yuzu flavor. The poke was very fresh. It would&#39;ve been better if the poke was marinated for a little longer to allow the flavor to soak in."

Given how many great Japanese restaurants there are in New York, I found the food here to be very average in comparison.

My friend and I started with the chef&#39;s selection of 3 sashimi ($13). We received 3 pieces each of yellowtail, salmon, and tuna. The sashimi came in thick cuts but lacked the melt-in-your-mouth quality of truly outstanding sashimi.

Then we got two large plates, black miso cod ($15) and grilled spicy shrimp ($17), along with the special seafood rice ($6). Our favorite was definitely the grilled spicy shrimp, which was flavorful and came with an equally flavorful bed of cooked veggies. The shrimps didn&#39;t come with shell so they were easy to eat. The black miso cod was cooked with a sauce that was quite forgettable, and the seafood rice was just fried rice with shrimp and squid so nothing too special. 

Overall, the food here is very reasonably priced and the service was very friendly, but i thought the flavors were average, and I didn&#39;t leave with the impression that this is worth making the trek for unless you&#39;re already in the area."

The waiters were pleasant and friendly, and the atmosphere is really lovely. 

I ordered two veggie rolls (quite small portions), the tofu and avocado salad, and the soy pudding with ginger sauce. Everything tasted amazing. It was such a perfect, well-balanced meal. 

They offer hot tea, which gets re-filled every so often and the staff are really attentive. I highly recommend this place."

I live across the street, so I obviously had to stop by for dinner at some point. We now have four restaurants in my part of the &#39;hood since I first moved here two years ago. (Starbucks just opened this year, so you know that hints at what&#39;s happening... rent increase for me, ugh lordy).

Anyway, we ordered--
Futomaki roll: ended up ordering two bc we were still hungry and it was good. *recommend

Salmon Hakozushi (pressed sushi): aka a roll pressed into a rectangular box aka great for your Instagram, but not impressive in flavor or uniqueness. We preferred the good ole roll.

Chirashi Don: normal chirashi dish

Miso Glazed Wings: I thought it was too salty for my taste, but everyone adored them. It is seriously crispy, reminiscent of the style of Korean chicken wings I love so much. *recommend

It&#39;s a small, cozy space that I think deserves its hype for this area. That being said, it&#39;s A-OK because there are other areas with better food/prices. I recognize this was just for one dinner service when they first opened, so don&#39;t take it too seriously. I think I would go back/will update if I do, but it&#39;s been over two months since I first visited."

Since this place is new, I got a bunch of my coworkers to visit tonight. This is a small cozy place. The staff greeted us warmly and was patient in answering any questions we had. We got a variety of things from fried shrimp to soups to fish cakes to a variety of rolls to bigger plates to desserts. I will highlight a few that stood out. 

Kimchi Salmon Roll was surprisingly not that spicy. This is the closest to &#34;spicy salmon roll&#34; that I would get from a low end Japanese place. I was concerned that kimchi would be too spicy, but this was just the right kick. I would totally order this again. 

Spicy Scallop Roll was not as spicy as I had thought and the scallop pieces were soft and tender. This is a must get if you also want to come for their lunch roll special. 

Grilled Miso Black Cod was the single thing that I was looking forward to. It was buttery tender and generally made well. I wish it was marinated in miso a little bit more so that the miso flavor would be stronger, but this is definitely not bad at all. There are a quite a bit of bones in the two pieces of filet so you should be careful in eating it. Even though I didn&#39;t try it, the grilled miso salmon looked equally as appetizing as the black cod. 

Matcha Mousse was simple but a nice end to a great meal. It caught my eye as soon as I looked at the menu and this didn&#39;t disappoint. It&#39;s on the sweeter side, so if you don&#39;t like your dessert overly sweet, then don&#39;t get this one. 

I&#39;m looking forward to coming here for lunch and trying their chirashi don! This is a solid hidden gem that I hope it is here to stay!"

They have changed chef who was amazing and now is not real Japanese comfort food at all. 
It&#39;s still great location and all but I was so excited about home style Japanese food when they open. 
I think they have become just usual American - Japanese ( or more like Asian ) restaurant."
jun-shokudo-brooklyn,Suanne L.,dMbMRfmX5AApq-9ZvWjdrA,"Brooklyn, NY",1,1,1,156,535,SiloX6TmuLHl76hsSk3iYQ,4.0,2016-05-03,"Jun Shokudo is the new restaurant on the block that I&#39;ve been meaning to try. Located in a quiet side street the straddles the Downtown Brooklyn and Fort Greene neighborhoods, it&#39;s a little lonely and the area doesn&#39;t have a ton of retail... yet. It neighbors a wine store and Pollo De Oro (which is also delish). For a Saturday noon time meal, my friend and I decided to stop in and have Japanese rather than a full scale Western brunch. We were the first people in the restaurant! The space is casual Japanese moderne, with lots of black wood, a tall sushi bar with the curtains, and wonderful ambient light from the windows. I love that their chairs have a built in cubby for you to put your stuff in! The restaurant is on the small side, seating maybe 40? The staff were quick to welcome us in and give us a run down of the menu and fill water glasses. 

The menu has a good mix of cooked foods (donburi rice bowls and the fish in the daily specials), sushi rolls, sashimi, and some salads. They do offer a chicken yaki udon, but otherwise no noodles on the lunch menu. The dinner menu is a bit fancier, with sashimi plates (vs a la carte), hakozushi (pressed), tempuras and katsus, and appetizers. My friend opted for the three sushi roll combo (soup and salad included) and I ordered the daily Teishoku lunch special, which was a braised octopus! OCTOPUS! FOR $15! Prices are affordable, in line with a lot of the ubiquitous sushi takeout joints. Our food was good - the rolls were filling and well rolled, the rice was warm and well seasoned. The rice to fish ratio was par. The lunch special was phenomenal from a value and variety perspective. I had miso soup, a side of kimpira potatoes and carrots, the octopus with bok choy, a bowl of rice, and a few tsukemono pickles. It was really well done. If this restaurant was in Tribeca, it easily could upcharge an additional 50% in pricing because the quality is totally there. 

Over the course of the meal, our server came over the check on us several times, refilled water (even though we could do it ourselves), and ensured we liked everything we had. We also sat at the bar, which enabled us to look over what the sushi chef was making and be nosy if we wanted to. They were all very kind and good at what they do. There was a large family that came in after us, but it seems like Jun Shokudo subsists on a lot of take out orders. Go check this place out and let&#39;s keep them in business, especially if you like cooked Japanese foods and not just Americanized sushi!"

Came here for lunch with my boyfriend- we had the salmon Ikura don and chicken Yaki udon. They were both great! The salmon melts in your mouth and compliments so well with the ikura. The yaki udon was a good portion- filled with bell peppers! They also have a 5% off deal on yelp if you check in. 
The reason why I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had to flag our waitress down to get a menu, place our order, and get a check. They were very busy when we entered the restaurant which was why they probably forgot to check on us and give us menus, but this was the only downside to our visit- even though I see a lot of yelp reviews that rave on their service."

The space is small but inviting and cozy, and the waitstaff and sushi chef were all friendly and attentive. Above all, though, it is the food that makes this new restaurant really shine. Highlights of the evening:

Niku jaga: braised root vegetables and beef. At 6 dollars, this hearty bowl of comfort food was filling and inexpensive and the taste was superb. 

Chawan mushi: this steamed egg custard was the perfect texture and had a wonderful savory flavor.

Sushi rolls: both the salmon kimchi roll and the spicy scallop roll were out-of-this-world. The flavors were unique and the plump pieces of scallop were so fresh and soft that it melted in your mouth. Highly recommend both!

I will most certainly be making Jun Shokudo my new neighborhood Japanese joint and I am happy that they also deliver and have lunch specials!"

But at least there was too much of it.. :( The rice also lacked any seasoning. Tiny pieces of salmon in the salmon avocado roll, and the rolls themselves were not rolled well. They all fell apart, large gaps between nori and filling. The specialty roll was the worst, had it only been moderately overpriced that would be one thing, but it was absurdly overpriced. Unflavorful kimchee that had a kind of old refrigerator taste, sour but not in the delicious way that kimchee should be. I don&#39;t understand what was on top on the roll, I think there was a pickled form of hot pepper and fake salmon roe. Needless to say I won&#39;t be back."

Really good food and love the interior design of this place. Came here with my family and we tried a little bit of everything. Their appetizers really good. Had the marinated mackerel, braised pork belly, steamed egg custard, pickled vegetables, shrimp tempura roll, tempura appetizer, miso black cod and some of &#34;Today&#39;s smaller plates and little things&#34; which is really good.  

-Shrimp tempura is really good here. I don&#39;t usually order shrimp tempura roll when I go to a Japanese restaurant, but since my brother did I tasted a piece of it. It was really good, it didn&#39;t taste heavy or oily at all. It tasted fluffy and light. 
-Tempura appetizer: ordered it because the shrimp tempura was good. It was just as good, fluffy and light. The tempura sauce was really good and it went perfect with the tempura appetizer. 
-Pickles vegetables good to eat as you eat through out your meal.
-Steamed egg custards tasted very light and silky, perfect for a light appetizer. It also comes in a really cute cup and baby spoon.  
-Braised Pork Belly is my favorite! I love pork belly, but not a lot of places can make the perfect sauce for pork belly. The sauce that they have also have goji berries in them and it goes perfect with the pork belly. It&#39;s a must try! 
-Marinated mackerel, I love eating mackerel raw and never had it cooked before so I decided to give it a try and it was good! It&#39;s a little sour, but not over dressed. Opens up your appetite a little! 
-Miso black cod was also one of my favorite dish, they cooked it perfectly and it tasted amazing. It doesn&#39;t have any sauce to go with it, but you don&#39;t even need any sauces and it&#39;s tastes really good. 
 -Today&#39;s smaller plates and little things: one of the little things we had was tofu with different types of mushroom and soup in it. The soup was really good and it went perfectly with the mushroom and tofu.
I will def come back with family and friends to try out other things on the menu."

It is a new Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn. They have a nice sushi and a la carte menu. I had California rolls, dragon rolls and a tempura set which had veggies and shrimp. I also had the tuna and branzzino sashimi. The butakakuni was sooo delicious. 

I really liked the cute design, which reminds me of Japan. Our waitress was really nice. She paid a lot of attention to us, and kept the drinks flowing. Definitely check it out."

Service is good, they are trying.

One of the keys to determinate how good/bad of a sushi restaurant is how they prepare the rice.  The sushi rice here is too hard and too sweet.

However, for the price and location, since there is not too much choices in the hood, it is still an OK place to go."

It wasn&#39;t like typical sushi places and Wally gave you quality portions of the fish. I feel confident here that I am getting quality food so that is always a plus when it comes to raw fish.

Downtown Brooklyn just scored a great sushi spot, something it was definitely missing. Caught a lunch special here the other day. We arrived at maybe 1pm and were greeted promptly and seated immediately. The young lady that served us was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to suggest some items for us. I ordered a very reasonably priced 2-roll combo. The rolls were pretty simple, which allowed me to really taste the fish, which was super fresh and tasty. My colleague enjoyed a hot lunch special, which I was super jealous of because it was the best crispy skinned salmon I&#39;ve tasted in a while. 

Anyway, if you live or work in Downtown Brooklyn, Jun Shokudo is the lunch spot you have been waiting for. Great decor, clean restaurant, excellent service, and delicious food. Will definitely be back."

I&#39;m offered s seat at the sushi bar but I want a table. It&#39;s a thing for me. Hostess says I can wait 15 min for a table that&#39;s about to clear. Ok. I wait. In the mean time she seats 4 at the two tables. I wait. It clears. 2 more people come in and she seats them at the table I&#39;m waiting for. She tells me it&#39;s the bar or nothing.

Lunch was a total of about 10 dollars. That included miso soup, salad and the main dish. This kind of food could easily be a lot more!

It reminds me of my favorite Japanese drama shinya shyokudo. The ambiance is good, like a traditional family izakaya. But the food is just not so good. I&#39;ve tried the gyo don (beef over rice), too plain, not even as good as the pre-cooked ajinomoto Gyodon. The chicken wings, too much flavor.

The lunch special is out of this world- you get Jun Shokudo quality for a fraction of the price. The food is inventive and delicious. The service is great- warm, friendly, not intrusive. The place is cozy and also very clean. Love the idea of the pressed sushi- though I found it had a bit too much rice, not enough fish/sauce. I am comparing to Miku in Vancouver, though, which is the be-all -end-all for Aburi style flame torched sushi. Love the spicy scallop roll (I get it as a handroll). I love the salmon collar and the miso cod- both amazing small plates to share. The homemade tofu w/ avocado is excellent. The restaurant is def a bit on the pricy side overall, but quality is great. If you stick with rolls it is affordable, the sashimi platters and other food can get expensive. I wish they had brown rice. Would love to try their poke but I don&#39;t eat tuna (mercury) so salmon poke would be a good special. Good selection of Sake. I hope they start to do Omakase soon- last time I was at sushi bar I got a taste of some of the omakase type dishes and they were amazing. Overall a top notch place and highly recommended."

Service was excellent. The staff was friendly and I never really had to wave anyone down. 

I had a few pieces of sashimi and the fish was very fresh. The reason for the four stars instead of five is that I felt the miso black cod could of had a bit more flavor, although it was still very good. The miso salmon was super yummy. 

Dessert wise the matcha mousse was super good.

Definitely worth another visit next time I&#39;m in the area.

However there are somethings I didn&#39;t care for:

1. For dinner, big plate item dish, it didn&#39;t come with rice. $2 extra

2. Really loved spicy scallop rolls last time. I ordered it again  this time and had too much mayo.

The service was excellent and my cup of green tea was constantly being refilled by the waiter. 

My friend and I enjoyed their lunch specials which are a great deal at around $12 for a set that includes a protein, miso soup, a heaping bowl of rice and cold/pickled veggies. I think they only offer two lunch specials a day which varies day by day. I had the salted mackerel, which was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and my friend had the pork katsu, which was also very good and had a hint of jalapeno. If you&#39;re craving sushi, you can also get three rolls off their a la carte menu for only $13. I will definitely come back here if I&#39;m ever in the area!"

Certain items here is beyond describable. Their NUTA salad is showing example how refine Japanese food is. every item in there is such simple ingredients but Chef Jyun, she orchestrated and give harmony within. Simple MISO soup &amp; homemade pickle is far away from what you have those in Sunrise market.

So if you are looking for your americanized dragon or ninja rolls, you can probably randomly pick from a list of other places and be happy.

Jun Shokudo serves what can best be categorized as obanzai, which are a mix of home style (much more refined the way they do it) Japanese dishes, a format that is rather rarely done at this level here in NYC.  For our first visit we deliberately stayed away from the sushi menu and are happy to report that EVERY dish was excellent - from the simple fermented rice bran cured pickled cucumber, to the &#39;nanban&#39; mackerel, raw tuna cubes served in this sweetish floral sauce that I was tempted to lick the bowl to finish, to the delectable desserts, there was not a single thing or detail that was not thought through in each dish.  All well constructed, perfectly balanced, nothing that was not supposed to be on the plate, nothing that could be subtracted.   The menu is concise and very well designed.  It looks like they might change the menu with the seasons which I prefer with kitchens of this level of quality.

Finally, a proper proper Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn, and so close to home, what a blessing.  This is quite possibly the best Japanese restaurant I&#39;ve been to in Brooklyn (w&#39;burg included), and even when you expand the scope to Manhattan this place is pretty high up there.  Strongly recommended!  Try everything on the Obanzai menu.  Will definitely be back again (and again)."

The salad is dressed with a rich balsamic glaze.  The manager told us they are waiting for a liquor license and have plans to add menu items for later in the day. The service was excellent.

It&#39;s a chain and this location does not disappoint. The buttery roll with the fresh crunch of the lobster are so perfectly seasoned and just melt in your mouth with every bite. It&#39;s not mushy, it&#39;s got a nice bite to it and there&#39;s some good acid from the pickle. If you make it a meal, you can get slaw or chips, but I always get the slaw. The slaw isn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had, but it&#39;s not the worst either, not much else to say about it. As far as drinks go, I always get the spicy ginger ale and my boyfriend once had the blueberry root beer (I think it was root beer) and both drinks were really good. Anytime a drink comes in a cold bottle it just amplifies the taste to me. But the ginger ale is not like your regular Seagrams or Canada Dry, it&#39;s much stronger in flavor and will bite you back if you don&#39;t expect it. 
This place is a bit on the pricier side so I can&#39;t come here regularly even though the lobster is tempting.  The meal was almost $20! Definitely one of those places that you come to when you feel like treating yourself or are having a long day and want a nice lunch."

I came on a Sunday early evening with 2 of my friends. The small shop has a cute, nautical atmosphere but it&#39;s nothing to stick around for so we took ours to go. All 3 of us ordered a lobster roll combo with slaw and a pale ale. We decided to go with the beer since that day it happened to be the same price as soda which was a major win. My total came out to around $20 which is pretty standard for a New York lobster roll. 

The lobster rolls were good but not the best I&#39;ve ever had. The roll was buttered and the lobster had good seasoning. The slaw was crunchy and spiced with I think the same seasoning that was on the lobster. The beer was a nice thing to wash everything down with.

I was hesitant to dine here since my past experiences with lobster rolls haven&#39;t been fantastic. I kind of needed a fantastic meal given after doing miles of walking in NYC. Yet the reviews looked great, so I gave it a shot. 

I had the lobster roll plus the soup combo. The roll size is smaller than other rolls I had in CA. The first bite is amazing; the bread is toasted right with a slight crunch on the outside, the bread is nicely buttered on the inside and the lobster is cooked just right, not too tough/rubbery. A great seafood taste with subtle seasoning that didn&#39;t overpower the lobster meat. The rest of bites are as amazing as the first. The clam chowder soup is delicious as well despite slightly salty for my preference. The clams are plenty in every spoonful and they are plump and juicy. The meal came with a pickled cucumber, which has a good crunch and taste that goes along with the roll. 

Though the roll is $17 for its size, it&#39;s totally worth it in my perspective. I haven&#39;t been to Boston but have tasted many rolls in CA. This is the best lobster roll I had. I&#39;ll try the trio rolls next time if I&#39;m in NYC!"

Oh! And lets not forget the 1/4 of the pickle! And the fact that the food wasn&#39;t entirely filling (yes, gluttony is real!). 

The lobster roll was tasty and I love that when I bit into it I could taste solely the lobster and a hint of butter and seasoning.  I have to say that I was sad to see it go once I had the fourth and final bite. 

Luke&#39;s Lobster is good if you have either already eaten and/or just have a craving for shrimp, crab or lobster rolls.  Don&#39;t plan on getting filled up on lobster, unless you have deep pockets!  This place I highly recommend for appeasing your seafood craving or getting a tasty lunch."

The soup was yummy and chock full of crabby goodness. The crab roll was smaller than I wanted it to be, but I&#39;m a glutton. It was so good, I could&#39;ve eaten three. 

The lobster roll was equally delicious. The cole slaw didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor and just seemed to be cabbage salad, but it was an extra I didn&#39;t order so it didn&#39;t matter.

The seafood is clearly very fresh. The rolls are crispy on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. Perfect texture and flavor. Damn, now I want one.

Dropped in and tried &#34;a taste of Maine&#34; - half each of lobster, crab and shrimp rolls with two crab claws.  The claws were chilled a bit too much which killed their flavor, but oh boy...that crab roll was buttery wonderful and so good it stole the show.  They should name this place Luke&#39;s Crab Rolls.

Not that the lobster and shrimp rolls were bad.  Lobster came in a close second, with some big meaty chunks nested in that fluffy buttery bread.  It&#39;s quite flavorful and exactly what you&#39;d expect (unless you are a snobby new englander).  And finally the shrimp - the fishiest of the 3, it&#39;s those little cocktail shrimp that have the really intense flavor and I generally associate with stomach aches and bad Chinese food.  Seriously though, it&#39;s good if you dig that kind of shrimp :)

Finally, I don&#39;t normally discuss soda but they had some tasty craft choices in their fridge.  Definitely recommend the blueberry soda -  where else are you gonna get one?

My husband and I luckily got a seat in the restaurant.    

We both had a lobster roll. It is made with a generous portion of perfectly cooked Maine lobster meat, covered with a light seasoning and drawn butter. I also had a cup of the New England clam chowder. The clams were big and tender with tons of flavor. The entire meal was off the charts!!! Simply fresh and delicious just the way I like it.

It was a hot, sticky uncomfortable Monday that I couldn&#39;t really go to lunch because of all the boxes and stuff going on.

Down I went to the tiny &#34;shack&#34; that is Luke&#39;s Lobster to finally experience the most talked about lobster roll in New York, possibly. 

It was epic. The bread: buttery, soft inside and toasty outside. The lobster: buttery, soft and perfectly cooked. The roll: with a bit of spice and subscribing to the website&#39;s description, a swipe of mayo. 

Since that first visit, I&#39;ve learned the smartest way, especially if you&#39;re not getting the taste of Maine, to enjoy Luke&#39;s lobster roll is to get the combo. Always chips and always a blueberry soda--bound to take anyone who isn&#39;t allergic to blueberries to a happy place."

The obvious choice is lobster, let&#39;s be real, but of course it&#39;s the priciest of the three (worth it). You can also get a bag of chips, a pickle, and soup.

The shrimp and crab rolls, I personally, can go without. If you order the meal, it comes with a soda, chips or cole slaw.  Go with the chips, the slaw has no flavor and just tastes like bland shredded cabbage.

My husband ordered the special that includes one of everything, and I ordered a lobster roll. Both meals were delicious. I loved the orange soda I got but my husband was not a fan of his ginger beer.

Yes, it is a bit pricey considering you can just go grab a sub sandwich for a few bucks... but if I were you, I would go into this place expecting to spend $15-$20 per person and just enjoy the food.

The ambiance is as if you entered a lobster shanty. It&#39;s quite small and so I don&#39;t suggest dining with a large group. Fortunately there is a park across the street, so you can dine al fresco, if the weather is cooperative.

The food was priced fairly for what you are eating. I preface that there is a difference between value in quantity and value in quality. I&#39;ve spent similar prices for a lobster roll that was about 1.5 times the size of Luke&#39;s, but it was a not a memorable lobster roll, in the least. Luke&#39;s uses just enough dressing so it stays put on the buttery toasted roll. When you bite in, it is a balance of the sweet lobster and smooth buttery dressed roll. Even the texture is a nice balance between lobster and roll is pleasant. I purchased it as a meal so I tried the slaw and the clam chowder. The slaw was super fresh and strangely stole the show for me. Again, not over dressed and just a really crisp fresh flavor. The clam chowder was ok. Definitely better than out of a can, but living at the Jersey Shore, I have access to some really great chowders.

The staff is great and as unique as the locations. While $25 is a little steep for lunch, I highly recommend Luke&#39;s if you are craving a seafood roll."

My lobster roll came without butter or mayo. I took two bites then realized it the lobster and bread was completely dry. I realize people make mistakes, so brought it back to be replaced with one that does have all the ingredients. Andrew (the manager on duty) refused to fix it or replace it with another one since I had taken a bite - and even ventured to argue with me that it probably did have mayo, even before taking a look. I&#39;ve been here 20+ times so I know their standards, and it also looked completely different than my wife&#39;s.

I had a few spoons of my friends clam chowder and it was bomb. We come from San Francisco and in my opinion we have the best clam chowder but I was pretty impressed. 

Def one of my favorite meals I had in New York. I can&#39;t wait to come back!!!"

Luke&#39;s lobster is one of my favorite places to grab one of the freshest lobster rolls in own. I truly love the vibe of the FiDi location with it relaxed crab/lobster shack vibes and playful decor. Downside of this location is that there is limited seating so try not to come during peak hours. Otherwise, definitely a NYC staple that you should visit. Try the lobster combo which comes with a beverage, a pickle, and your choice of chips or cole slaw. I love that the lobster filling here are not made with too much mayo and the bread rolls are perfectly buttered and toasted. Also don&#39;t forget to try the crab or shrimp rolls as well.

I also really enjoyed the coleslaw because it was not made with mayonnaise but rather a light vinaigrette. I would highly recommend this awesome little spot to anyone in the area &amp; who is not necessarily concerned about a budget conscious lunch. The price of the lobster roll is $16. Add in the beer, coleslaw, &amp; a pickle for $3 more &amp; you will quickly have about a $30 lunch.

The brioche bun was toasted to perfection. It was literally overflowing with great quality fresh lobster meat. It wasn&#39;t covered in greasy sauces like a lot of places do - it didn&#39;t need it.

I also had the shrimp and crab rolls. Personally, I would rate them as follows:

2. Shrimp
3. Crab"

I chose the Lobster Roll, and their clam chowder. I can not even start to explain the heaven in my mouth. The lobster pieces were huge and fresh, with the perfect amount of butter-i-ness that makes it just melt in your mouth. 
The clam chowder is the best I have ever had, so much clam meat in every bite.

I tried the $24 special that&#39;s sort of like a sampler- you get 1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 crab roll, and 1/2 shrimp roll in addition to 2 crab claws.  Comes with a soda and you can choose chips (Cape Cod brand) or their coleslaw.  Let me just say that Lukes has the best lobster roll I&#39;ve ever eaten - it&#39;s not too mayonaissey, the lobster meat is fresh, and it&#39;s seasoned to perfection.  In fact, the crab and shrimp rolls were delicious and prepared in the same manner.  Oh and that buttery roll they serve it on?  *bites finger and rolls eyes in delight*

Highly recommend.  I was gonna give four stars and complain about the prices, but hey, it&#39;s in the financial district of new york city, and it&#39;s FRESH seafood.  The portions are enough to satisfy if you include all the side stuff like the soda, chips and pickle.  I wont complain.  I will definitely be visiting again in the near future."

The people that work there genuinely seem to care about what they do.  The food is good, authentic, and fresh.  The music they play while you wait is great.  They have some fun sodas in the fridge.

Think the anti-Subway $5 foot long.  You don&#39;t get a million choices, and the food wasn&#39;t prepared in a warehouse in Texas.  You will pay three times $5 or more.  Some days they just might be out of one thing or another.  They don&#39;t wear little green uniforms.

Now, some reviewers will critique the celery to lobster ratio, the thickness of the mayo, the style of coleslaw, the size of the crab claw, the fact that soda bottle tops aren&#39;t twist offs.  You know those kind of reviews.

But it all depends upon your outlook.  I mean, c&#39;mon, a lobster shack in downtown Manhattan staffed by cool people who play great music.  Makes me hungry for it right now.

In fact, I&#39;m going to swing by tonight and get a pile of stuff to go.  I&#39;m going to hustle it back to my apartment, crack open a beer, put my feet up, watch something on the DVR, and be glad for simple pleasures.

When I walked in, I scanned the menu (written on a black board on the wall). Seemed like a good variety-rolls, grilled cheese, yum. After ordering, my food was ready in less than a minute (I ordered the lobster roll combo-comes with chips or slaw and a drink). The roll looked pretty good. The bread was nice and toasted, lobster was cold and had some type of seasoning sprinkled on top.

First bite was okay; lobster was a little bland. When I started to go in for my second bite, I noticed there were some weird milky-colored chunks of something...at first I thought it was a vegetable but after taking a bite of one it had a consistence like a super over-cooked vegetable. I shrugged it off and picked those pieces out of the roll. Next two bites had big pieces of lobster shell...not so fun to have to pick those out of my mouth. Another bite had sand! Totally turned me off and I couldn&#39;t continue eating the roll. I was so bummed because I heard such great things, and saw great reviews here on Yelp.

The slaw was okay...had a nice vinegary flavor. They have a great selection of soda-I tried the blueberry honey lemonade, which I really enjoyed.

I am not the type to be super picky about casual food, but the sand, shell, and mysterious milky white chunks were just not acceptable.

despite this, I have to say it was well worth it because it was the freakin bomb dot com!! they are efficient with the small space they have and are systematic behind the counter because it made the line seem not too bad. the decor is super cute and really makes you feel like you may see the docks if you looked out their windows. 

now onto the food. the lobster roll. amazing. though the roll itself is on the smaller side, they do not skimp out on the lobster. I repeat, they do not skimp out on the lobster. my favorite was when the pieces of lobster would fall out so I can enjoy the pure taste of the lobster on its own. whatever they did or did not do, they draw out the flavors of the lobsters really well and it&#39;s extremely flavorful and juicy. the only thing I would say it was missing is the warmth of the toast. at first glance, seeing that the toast is butter toasted, I expected it to be warm and wanted it to be warm. that&#39;s one drawback but a small one at best.

the coleslaw wasn&#39;t my favorite. but everyone has a different idea of what the best kind of slaw should be so they can&#39;t appease everyone with it!

craft soda. i got the ginger flavor and it was super gingery... and I loved it!

I&#39;m definitely happy with the overall experience! wish they would come to good ol St. Louis!"

On the other hand, on this visit, it did not live up to its reputation or price.  I had the lobster roll. It had lots of delicious lobster. The drawbacks: There was only butter in the crease of the roll, the lobster was ice cold, and it left a funny &#34;stale lobster&#34; taste when I finished eating it. 

It wasn&#39;t worth the trip out of my way or the price.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back when I need a quick fix though."

The lobster roll is delicious, they give you a large portion of lobster meat without much mayo or other filling which I see a lot at other places. The roll was also super buttery and delicious, and the whole waiting process for the roll took probably less than five minutes. The tables were all full when we came, but there was also a lot of public seating outside on the next block!"

The minute you walk in you are able to decipher the name; all their items are super fresh made with high quality delicious ingredients and it is right on Hell&#39;s Kitchen, they nailed it!!! I had their delicious tomato cheddar soup and half of a fresh mozzarella sandwich and I kid you not it is the best darn tomato soup I&#39;ve had (and I&#39;ve had quite a bit of soups) now as basic as cheese and mozzarella sandwich may this is everything but basic, it honestly doesn&#39;t get more delicious and this one and it is all about their ingredients. I mean you can eat them alone and they would still make your day so the way they are put together and dressed brings it all together in an amazing delicious harmony their, recipients and combinations truly blew my mind!!! 

To my point that their ingredients are exceptionally good and fresh while I was there, this lady (whom seem like a regular) just came in to get a baguette mind you this is not a bakery lol it is a juice/sandwich/soup and treats kind of joint. By the way the owner gave her the baguette at no charge, it is that kind of place with a cool vibrant atmosphere that&#39;s both very friendly and inviting. I will defiantly suggest anyone to stop by because it is unlike any other health bar in the city I wouldn&#39;t be surprise if it gets featured on Triple Ds with Guy Fieri it is that cool."

I placed an order for two turkey, tomato, and avocado sandwiches - super straightforward, no changes, just exactly how they make it.

I received both with no tomato.  No big deal right?  So I just gave them a quick call - and was told by the girl on the phone: &#34;Well, when we made it, we had no tomato.  Now we have tomato.  Do you want tomato?&#34;

Are you kidding me?  I asked her why she didn&#39;t call me when she realized she had no tomato and all she said again, was,  &#34;So you want tomato?&#34;

Never ordering from this place again.  Not to mention the crappy sandwiches I received - two slices of turkey with brown avocado."

My intestinal instincts were right. It&#39;s a cute little soup/salad/sammich/smoothie spot that doesn&#39;t break the bank. Everything is priced under $10 but you&#39;ll be spending closer to $20 if you want more than one thing. 

I order a large mixed salad and a smoothie. 

The salad wasn&#39;t what I was expecting in that I&#39;m used to places like Chopt where I tell them what I want and they add it. Here, you have pre-made &#34;salad&#34; toppings such as tuna salad, bean salad, greek salad, etc. that go on top of your greens. With a large, you&#39;re allowed to pick 3 options. The salad was filling and I really enjoyed it.

I opted for the Boo Berry smoothie and thought it was pretty good. Filling (Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, banana, vanilla almond milk, vanilla whey protein) and flavorful. 

Given the proximity to my office, this is a place I&#39;d come to again. I wish the menu was a *bit* larger, but this also does me the favor of not being overwhelmed with options."

And I really, really want to like it more than 2 stars, but it just doesn&#39;t do it for me. I have been 3 times and tried 3 different things and I think I am finally ready to admit that this just isn&#39;t a place for my taste.

The items I have tried:

Turkey sandwich - it was an OK sandwich. It was not bad, but it was not great and honestly, I make better at home. And it&#39;s $9, for a basic, make at home, turkey sandwich...

A smoothie - I do not remember which one, probably because I only remember the price... $9! For a 16oz cup of not bad but not great smoothie. I am willing to pay for a good protein shake, but this place has nothing on liquiteria and it&#39;s more expensive - like ???

Chicken Salad Sandwich - I thought for sure this would be it. This would be the item to win me over. But it wasn&#39;t that good, two big watery hunks of tomato, very large pieces of roasted red pepper and chewy chicken pieces. My cafeteria at work makes a better chicken salad sandwich and it&#39;s a work cafeteria.

Notice I didn&#39;t say anything was bad. It&#39;s not bad, but then you look at the price and your like - Hey! This is not a good deal. This is a bad deal for me.

The sandwich selection isnt huge, but they are all really tasty.  My favorite is the chicken salad, which comes with red pepper and sprouts (on a good day).  You can really taste that all the ingredients are really fresh.

I think perhaps because they are new, the smoothie recipes sometimes taste funny, but if you stick with a more basic tried and true recipe, its sure to be good. I like the &#34;what the hell&#34;  smoothie with avocado.

The salads is probably the most plentiful option.  You choose a base and then have a bunch of really good toppings to choose from.   If you are a salad fanatic, this is definitely your place.

For a date or a small group, I highly recommend enjoying relaxed conversation over a delicious meal, served by the kindest waitstaff, surrounded by warm Parisian decor. 

Ambiance: Very cute! The space is incredibly small, with one row of tables each lining the right and left side as you walk through. The decor is cute and homey without being over-the-top, adding to the warm, cozy feeling overall. Soft music plays overhead, adding charm but not inconvenience. 

Food: We ordered the Rainbow Trout (with french beans, crushed potatoes, bacon, and yogurt chili dressing) as well as the Pan Roasted Half Chicken (with wild mushrooms, potato puree, and tarragon pan jus) - both were to die for. I wiped my plate clean, and still craved more not because there was too little food but because the flavors were so well put together. The portion sizes are appropriate, European portions, leaving diners full but not overstuffed. 

Service: Everyone was so kind! I was a bit under the weather, so the staff constantly refilled my glass with warm water, per request, without any fuss. They were patient, never rushing us to order or pack up and leave. The meal was truly in a European dining style - a stark contrast to the rush we&#39;re accustomed to in New York. 

Prices: Extremely reasonable for the quality of the meal and experience.

We were seated quickly and ordered the croque monsieur with ham and gruy√®re cheese on brioche toast and the wild mushroom omelet with asiago cheese. Brunch comes with your choice of coffee/tea/orange juice/sangria. We ordered coffee and orange juice. The croque monsieur was very good, all cheesy, salty goodness. The wild mushroom omelet was on the small side but tasty with an earthy bite from the mushrooms. Both dishes came with a side salad that was good. The mushroom omelet also came with string fries that seemed overcooked. They were crispy, crunchy like potato chips and some were really, really hard. The coffee was good but should have been hotter. The orange juice was out of a carton. Overall, the food was quite good but probably a bit overpriced at $16.75.

I had the pork belly special which was ok. The skin was slightly crisp but was hard to chew. The lean part of the meat was pretty tough. It came with a rhubarb puree and braised rhubarb. I also had some of the escargot which came with the standard garlic herb sauce.

Two of my girlfriends and I met up for dinner one weekday evening. Since it was really warm outside, we decided to take the outdoor seats. Due to a limited time before one of my girls have to get back to work, we went straight to the dinner menu.

One of the girls and I both got the Salmon Risotto and the other got a Steak with Frites. 

Our waiter asked how I wanted my salmon. It kind of shocked me a little bit since I was never asked how rare I want my salmon before. I went with medium well. Salmon Risotto came with a huge piece of salmon on top of the yellow risotto. Risotto tasted creamy and like tomato, perhaps that&#39;s the base of it. Salmon was nicely cooked throughout and really tender. My friend told me that this dish is on their special menu and it is not always available.

Steak with Frites. Steak was marinated and cooked in red wine sauce. Meat was tender and chewy, just how I like it. Frites tasted like chips - they were thinly sliced and crunchy. It was not like regular french fries at all. 

Overall, a very friendly environment for a meal to stay."

To start we had the escargot and the endive salad. The escargot was delicious-- save some of your bread for this. The endive salad was great as well- blue cheese, candies walnuts, pear. 

For our entrees we got the duck confit and the steak frites. The duck confit was excellent- it comes on a bed of fris√©e and mushroom with a light mustard sauce. The steak frites was great as well.

Came here with a couple friends at noon on a Saturday (right when it opened). It already got crowded within a few minutes! It is a small space, very European-cafe-looking, great for a date or catching up friends in a quieter atmosphere.

They had a wide selection of brunch items, where you add either a mimosa for sangria for $15.95. My sangria was just okay, but with the huge entree it was still a great deal. I had the eggs florentine, which I loved. They put some sort of tangy cream sauce in it that made it incredibly addicting! The fries that came with I were also very good and crispy. I finished almost everything, and it kept me full (a little too full) for a long time. 

My friends got the poached eggs with lox, as well as another eggs florentine, with mimosas and reported that their dishes were great as well.

The service was ok, but we got things we wanted when we wanted. Coffee was free slowing and good. 

I would highly recommend their brunch special which comes with a choice of coffee, juice, or mimosa. I got the mimosa which was delicious, but also got the coffee because who can have brunch without coffee right?

1. Croque Monsieur: So I came with a Frenchman and he was blown away by how good this was. He&#39;s not a foodie but he knows good French food when he tastes it. This was phenomenal. The Gruyere was so good. The side salad was also quite a nice complement. 

2. French toast: crispy and soft simultaneously, this came with banana slices. One of the best French toast I&#39;ve had. Only issue is that it could have been larger. 

We thought fries were included in the special but were told that they only came with the egg dishes. Bummer because they looked good.

1) Duck Confit:
-Perfect crispy skin and the duck was juicy and sweet in flavor.
-Very close to my experience in France. 
-The best part is that they give you the leg of the duck (extra dark meat, my favorite!) and the portions were huge!

2) Escargot 
-I highly recommend that you ask for extra bread to dip into this delicious basil, garlic pesto sauce that the snails are drizzled on!
-My friend had initially ordered this dish and I was hesitant to get it because usually snails are a hit or miss, but this place is a HIT HIT HIT.
-I couldn&#39;t even tell it was snails.

3) Steak
-Med-rare, perfectly brimmed and smoky skin.
-The pieces are already cut for you and you can tell by the pink inside that they truly make it how you want it.
-I absolutely loved the caramelized onions and cilantro smeared on top. 
-The fries that it came with were crispy and a perfect match with the escargot sauce!

4) Creme br√ªl√©e
-Generous size and surprisingly enough to share for 5 people! Especially after having a big meal, a couple bites of dessert touches the spot.

Food 3.75/5: Value decent: $16.95 brunch entree with mimosa/coffee/OJ/sangria.
- Grilled chicken sandwich: 4.5/5 so good, but it doesn&#39;t come with fries and greens, sadly (sad about the fries, to be clear). Despite this, it is surprisingly filling!
- Frittata with chorizo, roasted peppers and swiss cheese: 3/5. This looked very promising, and should&#39;ve been given the LONG wait (see below) but sadly the presentation was superior to the taste. Tasted sad. Very eggy kind of sadness. Definitely need a lot more chorizo and cheese. And some seasoning wouldn&#39;t hurt either. Fries were good, salad OK.

Service: 3/5: Owner/manager-human was very nice and homely. He sat us immediately upon entry. However, server-human was not so. She was very snotty, did not look like she knew how to smile, and acted like she was doing us a favor by serving us. The food took a very long time, such that those seated after us received their food before us, (my supposition is that the Frittata is the culprit behind this), such that we were probably the last to receive our food of the customers seated. But I couldn&#39;t even catch her attention to inquire. Finally caught the buser, who vaguely relayed &#34;it&#39;s coming.&#34;

Decor/Space: cute, but slightly shabby. It has small tables, but can be pushed together. Definitely tiny, but instead of giving me the cozy feel, actually gave me slight claustrophobia. 

Overall: I probably would not go again soon. There are just so many other brunch options. Like La Tarte Flambee next door. They for one actually seem to know how to smile."

This french themed cafe is brunch at its best.

This cafe has a few tables out in the front of the restaurant and a dozen or so tables inside which is great for a couple or small group. The interior decour is filled with something you would expect to see on the streets of france. 

I have been wanting to come here for brunch for a while now but there is usually a line out side but I was lucky when I went there and got a table right away with no line. The waitress and was extremely friendly and we ordered the brunch special which includes 1 entree and 1 (Mimosa, Sangria, or Coffee). We both got Mimosas with it and splurged to get the coffee too. The mimosa was really good and the coffee was strong and was refilled 3 times without me even having to ask that what i cal great service! For the entree we got the Egg white omlette with salmon gravlax and fresh herbs which comes with fries and salad. This was cooked perfectly and they do not cheap out here on the salmon by giving you cut up pieces they good solid slices. The meal tasted incredibly fresh and delicious. For the other entree it was the fritata with goat cheese,roasted pepers, black olive, and basil pesto. For any pesto lover you will love this dish! It was cooked perfectly fluffy in the middle with a crispy outside and flavor burst of pesto in every bite.

We both started off with the french onion soup. Not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but absolutely up there. Includes a generous portion of bread and cheese, which is always a plus. For the main course, I had the pork piccata. I thought it was delicious, however I also think it could have used a little more garlic.

Now the food, I&#39;ve had the escargot here and it was absolutely delicious. Flavorful and buttery and melts in your mouth! Just absolutely amazing I can just eat this dish all day. The chicken dish i had was seasoned just right and cooked nicely. The chicken was not dry but juicy with lots of flavor.

The interior decor is cute and homey. The only thing that bothered me was since the restaurant was so small, I did feel a little cramped while in the restaurant.

As for food, I got the rainbow trout, french beans, fingerling potato salad, bacon, chili yogurt sauce. The trout was delicious! It was perfectly crusted and tasted very fresh. The rest of the sides had a perfect balance of sweetness and saltiness to it and complemented the fish really well. For dessert, we had the soft meringue over vanilla custard. WOW, I was pleasantly surprised. I did not realize what soft meringue was (I expected a soft or chewy cookie) and thought the texture was very interesting and fun to eat. I love sweet things and the dish had a good amount of sweetness. The caramel on top blended in perfectly with the meringue and custard.

Elegantly prepared classic French dishes in a relaxed atmosphere for a great price. I began with the French onion soup and they knocked it out of the park.  The broth was savoy with a gain sweetness at the end, the cheese was done to perfection and not at all chewy.  The escargots was equally as well done. They were full of fresh garlic and herbs and so tender.  My steak was no disappointment either and at this point my expectations were pretty high.  My server was great but didn&#39;t hover.  She answered all my questions and was also pleasant.  
  I would recommend this place to anyone, French cuisine enthusiast or not.  Definitely one of my best finds on this trip to the city."

Great choice for either brunch or dinner. The ubiquitous wife and husband are delightful and the atmosphere is romantic. 

I find French food rather daunting maybe because of the perceived refined culture that goes hand in hand with Francia. What I like most about Le Parisien though is the menu doesn&#39;t overwhelm you but still provides enough options. You aren&#39;t inundated when you open up the wine menu. I saw a cute teal green bicycle parked outside the window last week- if only they used it to deliver too."

This little spot might not be able to seat you without a reservation, and it might not be able to seat large parties very well because small is not a descriptor here, there is not enough room to put the word into the menu.

What they DO put in the menu and on our table was one of the best prepared meals we have ever had.  This bears repeating- our 3 course meal here was not just great, not just varied and amazing ingredient choices, not just perfect presentation - the culinary harmony this gifted chef prepared for all 3 courses was a marriage of timing, temperature, blending, and taste.  You may think this is too much to add, but this was a Hope Diamond - quintessential text book Master ChefExpectations that lead to one amazing night. 

The friendly french staff was right about their recommendations, the wine choices are not the main treat here but of course you can expect some decent French choices on the list.

We started with Es cargo and a toasted artichoke salad. The garlic will hit you the moment the dish hits the table (beware its very hot). She loved her first dish.  My salad was a normal list of ingredients but  what seemed routine was dressed with a lemon tarragon vinaigrette, perfection on the taste buds.

Dinner was a Duck choice for her, and a Grilled Salmon dish that was a very thick cut but cooked to within seconds of perfection, which for such a thick cut could not be anything but perfect planning and timing, no guess work going on there. Add the Herb Quinoa and mint cucumber dressing, and the flavors came together better than I would have ever thought.

Her Duck Confit came with wild mushrooms and very crisp potatoes- again cooked to perfection is an understatement.

The evening finished with the most awesomely prepared creme brulee and an amazing Apple Tart.  You can make these many ways, and add many things to enhance the flavors of trusted and well used choices in today&#39;s&#39; restaurant world, believe me when i say you will leave wanting more.

Thinking over our choices, I would eat a second portion of anything in our choices, as would she.  The sizes were not overly Americanized so come hungry but dont expect to be treated to anything like an American dinner, Bienvenu √† Paris and some of its finer cooking right here in NYC."

Located on a side street, this small, intimate place is a welcoming place from the cold weather.  There aren&#39;t many tables, but that&#39;s what makes it cozy.

We had the special salad with mixed greens and a fried egg, and the French onion soup. The salad was light, with the egg yolk adding a silky texture. The soup was gooey, flavorful, and had just the right amount of onions.

For dinner, we had the steak and the mussels with fries. Crispy, salty potatoes were fried perfectly, and the steak was juicy and tender. 

While the meal was fantastic, the dessert was the highlight. Flaky and light profiteroles drenched in chocolate sauce. Did I get your attention? 

I can&#39;t wait to go back and lick the plates."

Not many vegetarian options for dinner -- butter sauce pappardelle pasta was pretty good.  Portion was ginormous beyond belief -- at least 3 meals.  

They have a decent brunch set which includes a mimosa or other breakfast drink.  Monte Cristo is super cheesy and unhealthly deliciousness.  Mushroom omelet and spinach benedict were both decent -- nothing spectacular, but both are standard fare breakfast items.  Don&#39;t get your hopes up on the pomme frites here because they are mediocre.  Sad when a French bistro doesn&#39;t get the pomme frites right.  

Brunch starts at noon and not a minute sooner.  But this place fills up fast, so worth coming a few minutes early and squatting across the street at the juice bar.

Really cute, tiny bistro ambiance.  Tables are really close together, so don&#39;t plan on getting up or having a super private conversation.  It still feels intimate though in it&#39;s own way -- must be that European thing.  Service is really laid back and nothing is rushed, even if they have a line -- this can be a good or bad thing I suppose.  Chill."

That&#39;s my favorite part about it. If I was rich, I&#39;d hang out here every day. The restaurant was full when I went but it was such a calm respite from the city. The food was pretty good. Not blow your socks off, but a decent meal.  Everything tasted a little under seasoned. I&#39;m not a connoisseur of french cuisine and have an American palette. So take that with a grain of salt. Which I felt there wasn&#39;t enough of in any of the dishes. The wine was nice, but pricey. However, I don&#39;t mind paying a buck or two extra to have a glass in that environment. I&#39;ll definitely be back. I&#39;m hoping they had an off night in the kitchen and that next time the food will be better seasoned. If not, I&#39;ll just go there for drinks with friends."

I also am in Paris about twice a year, and this place makes me feel like i&#39;m back there. Will be back several times over and over again. A rezo is easy to make, and worth it as there can&#39;t be more then 10 tables in the entire restaurant so its nice to get right in. To top it off, its a cheap meal for NY standards and some of the most delicious food i&#39;ve had in a while! The best roasted chicken and escargot I&#39;ve ever had, hands down."

I noticed that the restaurant had a great reputation on Yelp and also noticed that a few of my Yelp friends have actually been here. A friend and I walked in and didn&#39;t have a reservation. It wasn&#39;t an issue getting a table as they did have a few available. It was the night before Christmas so maybe it was a little quieter than normal, but maybe a reservation would be best on any other night. The restaurant isn&#39;t very large. 

To start we both ordered french onion soup. The soup was excellent! Really enjoyed the soup and the way it was made. A little different than some french onion soup&#39;s I&#39;ve had. As a main course we decided to have an order of mussels to share. We went with the Marinieres, which was pretty good! The fries that came with the mussels were also very delicious. 

The brunch special they offer for $15.95 a person looked awesome! I would love to come back again and try it out."

As far as I can recall (it&#39;s been many moons since I was in Paris), this place is pretty authentic.  It&#39;s a small bistro and their street-side seating is limited, but the menu as well as the execution of the food are spot on.  I&#39;ve only been for midweek lunches, so can&#39;t comment on other times or weekends, but I&#39;ve only had great experiences here.  It&#39;s never particularly crowded, service is attentive but not overly jovial (again, authentic), and the food is always delicious.  The prices are moderate, not a &#34;cheap eats&#34; destination, but also not a place that&#39;s going to break the bank.

Highlights for me have been the mussels and fries, the croque monsieur/madame, the French onion soup (excellent), and their salads.  I would guess this is a great brunch spot too, but also a popular one, so be prepared.  Si vous voulez une authentique cuisine fran√ßaise dans un endroit mignon, vous devriez venir ici tout de suite!"

I&#39;ve been dying to go and see what all the fuss was about at this place because I typically see the brunch line go out the door.  

Last Saturday, I ate at Le Parisien and had an amazing meal. We wanted to go to a nearby brunch spot to have a nice simple meal.  Luckily, it was Easter weekend so there was no wait and we also went right when it opened which was nice. The restaurant is really small, can maybe only sit 30 people but it had such a cute rustic french charm to it  - I absolutely loved the vintage decor. 

Le Parisien has a $16.95 brunch special which includes one entree and one drink (coffee, mimosa, or sangria).  I had the croque monsieur and a mimosa. The croque monsieur was amazing - very cheesy, had a good amount of meat, and they used a nice bread on the bottom.  It also came with a side salad.  My husband had the eggs benedict and he said it was they best he had in a while - and better than Sarabeth&#39;s, which is our typical go-to brunch spot.

The mimosa was pretty good and tasted like it was made with fresh orange juice.  I also tried the sangria and I thought it was delicious - I really like the wine base they used.

Overall - great spot for brunch if you are in the area.  I wouldnt recommend for large groups unless you can secure a reservation given the small space setting - but great for a casual date.  Looking forward to coming in for dinner sometime soon!"

The food was great although my moms paperadelle was warm not hot. She enjoyed it. I had French onion soup which was really hot and a little sweet but still good.

The issue I had was the service. The gentleman who does all the seating and order taking was a bit rude. He did not provide us with the specials (but did so for everyone else who came in). He made it seem like we are bothering him. He was way more friendly to the other tables 

It also smelled like sewer back up"

Please note, I&#39;m a small person but my boyfriend is not, he&#39;s 6&#39;2 and can EAT, and we both agreed the portions size is perfect).

Ambience: Very small place,  simple with French pictures on the wall.

Service: My friends couldn&#39;t go earlier so I called to verify if we would still be seated if we got there at 2:30pm. The guy on the phone indicated that as long as we were there by 2:45pm we were good. So we got there at 2:30 and he seemed a bit disappointed  we were there (they close at 3pm to get ready for dinner). His customer service skills were very French aka rude; took me back to the time I went to Paris.

Food: The French toast was heavenly. The croque Monseiur was pretty good but they burnt one of the sides of the bread. My other friends loved their dishes as well.

The sangria was just ok.

Price for brunch was pretty sweet.

She got there first and told me she had a table outside. OK, there&#39;s outside seating available. When I arrived it was still a bit chilly so we decided to have eat inside. Anyway, not that outside seating is very small, not a place you want to sit outside for too long. Prior to our lunch, I called to find out whether there&#39;s a table for 2 but the lady, also happened to be our server said the place was kind of full but in half hour they&#39;ll be able to accommodate. So yes, we got our table because we listened and decided to meet half hour later. I suggest you do that before coming to this small restaurant. We had a great lunch. My friend had mussels in coconut sauce and french fries. I had salmon with vegetable risotto. My dish was absolutely delicious. My friend&#39;s dish was pretty big, it&#39;s like they brought out the entire pot right in front of her and asked her to &#34;chow down&#34; and don&#39;t look back. Mine was served in a smaller portion just the way I like it. One thing I would suggest is to cut the salt a bit during making a risotto because I found it a bit salty. Other than that was good. Her dish was delicious but she couldn&#39;t finish them because it&#39;s a lot. French fries was very good here. I&#39;m not a fan of french fries but I tried a bit. I can tell you that if you like french fries, just come and order from this place and have it to go. Our server was very good, she could handle this small place by herself.

The place is pretty small so in order to avoid the crowd, you probably want to go right when it opens, or after 2. That being said, it&#39;s probably easiest to nab a table if you&#39;re a party of 2. (no reservations for brunch)

A friend and I came in on a Sunday around 2:15 and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. The prix fixe is $15.95 for a coffee, tea, orange juice, mimosa, or sangria, and your choice of one of the entrees. All egg dishes come with a small side salad and some fries. I went with the salmon gravlax Benedict, which is cured salmon. The hollandaise sauce was a little too buttery for my taste but the fries and salad it came with definitely helped balance it out a little.

I&#39;ve never had a bad entree here. You can&#39;t go wrong with the mussels here. This night, we opted for the more traditional entrees.

I had received an offer for the brunch at 15.95 for checking in on Yelp, and it turned out this was the offer they have at the restaurant anyway. I got poached eggs with smoked salmon and it came with a small French style side salad and fries, which were both delicious!! My boyfriend got the croque Monsieur and that was also very good. You get one drink such as a mimosa or sangria included with the brunch, and they&#39;re only $5 each after! We were seated right away despite the small space, and we loved how the restaurant was decorated."

Was lucky enough to get last-second dinner seats in a restaurant so small/right that tables need to be shifted to allow seating. 

Got the steak frites and mussel bowl. Both excellent. Expertly grilled medium-rare steak was a hanger (vs skirt?) and was served sliced with a generous helping of red wine-based sauce. Important given the also generous helping of crunchy thin fries, allowing for a thorough soaking into a steak-y de facto French poutine. 

Mussels were also perfectly boiled, with plump bivalves swimming in a deep pool of rich broth. So rich that it&#39;s a bit too much to just drink straight from the bowl, but concentrated enough to impart an explosion of flavor to each bite. Fries were truffle(oil)d, but to be honest, this was unnecessary; dumped them into the steak sauce."

The bus boys/men were the only saving grace for this not being one star. They hustled to make sure your water glasses were always filled, cleared the plates promptly and courteously and were very nice. Wish the hostess (the one with the long dark brown hair) could learn from them.

SERVICE: I came here for brunch on a Sunday around noon. The restaurant is only open from 12 until 230 on Saturday and Sunday for brunch, and they don&#39;t take reservations. Around 10 to noon, a line starts forming outside the restaurant. We had a party of six, including my newborn baby, and so I was a little hesitant as to whether they would even let us sit inside their tiny little restaurant and take up so much space. However, the restaurant owner was extremely accommodating and gracious. The service overall was efficient but not overbearing. Although the restaurant is small, and there is a line to get a table, they never made us feel pressured to leave. 

BRUNCH: The special is the $15.95 brunch which includes an entree and a beverage (coffee, OJ, or mimosa). All the entrees come with potatoes and a small salad. The Frittata with goat cheese, olives, pesto, and peppers was HUGE and totally awesome. My MIL said the Traditional Eggs Benedict was one of the best she&#39;s had and my father-in-law loved the French toast. My husband and brother-in-law got the eggs and omelettes and both thought they were great. Absolutely no complaints about the size or quality of the food. 

Overall, we will definitely be back for brunch again. The only downside of this place is that it&#39;s so tiny and you can&#39;t make a reservation. You are guaranteed to wait at least a little bit for a table. However, the charm, service, and great food make the wait worth it."

Then I came across Le Parisien on Yelp. We arrived by noon and beat most of the crowds, getting a table straight away for two.  The place is either very much French owned or at least French operated and felt quite authentic right down to the service (ie: we didn&#39;t feel completely hassled to leave once we finished our meal!). With a set brunch price of $15, it was by far the best value we probably would have found in the area - I had salmon and eggs and my partner had a gruyere and ham omelette - both served with coffee, side salad and fries.  Definitely recommended if you are in the area!"

Tables are very tight and seating is limited.  It was a Friday night and the place was packed with many locals which is always a good sign.  Started out with escargot (snails) which were prepared perfectly in a garlic parsley butter sauce that I soaked up in the crusty french bread that they served.  Then onto the P.E.I. mussels that came in a fennel garlic and white wine sauce. Mussels came in a large black pot and tasted delicious.  This was more of a main course helping by the number of mussels I received. Lastly the duck confit.  Small in size but it was a tasty dish accompanied by sliced potatoes.  They served it when the mussels came so it was a bit cold by the time I got to it.  If the service was better I would have given this place a 5 Excellent rating. Prices were very reasonable on both the menu items and the wine list.

I had the duck confit for my main dish and, oh boy, it was the best duck confit I have ever had. I usually never finish my meals when I dine out due to my very small portions, but I finished every last bit of my duck! I was such a happy camper, you don&#39;t even know.

Food is really what you pay for so just keep your expectations bit low and you will walk away happy. As usual the waiter and person at the counter have a grumpy face and attitude. I guess it&#39;s now a default for most restaurants to have waiters who have grin on their faces. I didn&#39;t stay for desert as they were rushing everyone out pretty much the moment you end your main course and manager just immediate ask then to throw the bill at the table.

The escargot is by far NOT the best I&#39;ve had and would suggest that it be passed up. The steak and fries are to die for! By far, the very, very best I have had outside of France. 

Having been there four times now, they are always very stingy with the bread. The place is not very comfortable, is very loud as everyone is really sitting right on top of each other. The chairs are simple wooden chairs, with no comfort and if you need to exit the table and are sitting against the wall, you are forced to disturb your neighbors. 

The owners are not friendly at all and rather brash. I asked a question about the soup of the day and her reply was &#34;I&#39;ll tell you when the other person returns (from the rest room). That goes over in Paris but not in NYC. I would have given them five stars if this only happened to me once there, but it has happened at least twice. 

So go for the fantastic steak and fries. It is the only reason I go there as the French people are much nicer in France than the owners of this place! Enjoy!!"

Definitely a gem in the typically douchey Murray Hill area. Sometimes restaurants up here can lack a good vibe, but this place was charming and had an inside reminiscent of a hole-in-the-wall you&#39;d find somewhere like the Lower East Side.

Service was great, food was delicious. My friend and I split a moderately priced bottle of red wine and started with the mussels and fries app (typical French starter). The last time I ate mussels was in Nice so they had big shoes to fill, but were pretty delicious! I ordered the half chicken which was seasoned well and the skin was perfectly crispy. My friend got the salmon which was a little undercooked but also delish. We were there until close but our waiter was really patient with us. For example, when the busser accidentally cleared my wine glass when our bottle wasn&#39;t finished, the waiter gave me a complimentary glass of wine!

The bread was kind of burnt and hard and the butter was too cold. The endive salad is literally the best thing I&#39;ve had in awhile; roasted pears, Roquefort cheese, walnut, port vinaigrette... I almost ordered another one.The Escargots with herbs and garlic butter was good as well. I got the atlantic salmon with baby vegetable risotto and saffron sauce upon recommendation over the steak. The salmon was cooked perfectly as was the rice, however the vegetables were overdone and the sauce very nearly ruined the dish. It had this strange thick orange component, I couldn&#39;t really taste the saffron at all, I tried to scrap most of it off. Wish I&#39;d gotten a different entree.

The food was phenomenal. There was a lot of salmon. The poached eggs were just the right amount of runny. I really enjoyed my dish. Plus it comes with fries and salad (both average, but average is good!) Very pleased with the entree, and extremely filling.

escargot - deliciously pesto and buttery, and large! worth it, not over cooked in the least
mussels espagnole - (with chorizo and tomato confit) delicious mussel pot served with frites, perfectly sized mussels and just the right amount of frites
steak tartare - quite the portion size in the best way, the meat was fresh and the flavors were great...can taste the garlic, but not overwhelming, also served with frites
creme brulee - the sugar crack topping could&#39;ve been a little &#34;crispier&#34;. it was good though. i only say this because i didn&#39;t hear the &#34;crack&#34; when my spoon broke through the sugar layer, great use of vanilla bean

The interior is adorable, but it does get very cozy. There&#39;s not a lot of room here, and it would be difficult to get more than a group of 4 in here. It gets reasonably busy on the weekend, but not so much that there&#39;s a long line. The interior is decorated with vintage French posters and ceiling fans that give off a nice vibe. On nice days they open up the front so it&#39;s almost like dining in a patio, but be warned there is no air conditioning.

They have a really nice brunch menu - most of the options are fixed price, and come with a entree and your choice of mimosa, OJ, sangria, or coffee (if I remember correctly additional glasses were 5$). The eggs benedict I had was delicious, and everyone else&#39;s dishes looked delicious too - the omelettes were plump but the salmon benedict really stole the show.

The beef  carpaacio was amazing. Simple food where the ingredients speak instead of trying to manipulate something simple to a flavor abomination. The second item that I must rave about is the Coq au Vin which is the completely antithesis of simple. The big flavors of this dish make a great change in palate from the carpacio. The truffle mash potatoes were simple and not overpowering to the main course of chicken in a red wine reduction so perfectly cooked with shallots and baby bellas that it just fell off the bone. With a slight hint of bacon the chemistry of the flavors shown through. Would definitely come back.  Not if but when. Bon Chance!

The food, the price and the charm. It is not overly crowded, but the tables are close enough to listen to other folks conversation, I guess thats part of the Parisian experience as well. We ordered escargot which was nice garlicy and seemed to be overflowing with juices. That paired well with when you dip the bread in the escargot oil. We also got to try the special of the day, steak which was perfectly cooked to medium rare and served with a side of mashed potatoes. Also a bucked of mussels. It was a little hard to eat and could have been a little saucey. Mussels came with a side of french fries which seemed to be hand cut.

A bunch of reviews on here were complaining about it being pricey for the portion sizes. I personally eat a lot, and I left there satisfied. It&#39;s a decently sized quality meal. Problem is some people forget this isn&#39;t the Olive Garden."

Every year around this time, my wife and I have this craving for typical french bistro food from our honeymoon. We have been looking for a whole in the wall, straight to the point, no frill french bistro food.

Food was excellent!! It was as good as the one that we had during our honeymoon.

So here&#39;s what we order:
Escargot-on point, and excellent. I just wish for more french bread to soak up all the buttery, garlicky deliciousness...hahahahh (sorry...i&#39;m a fatty who appreciates food!)

Beef tartare- was amazing!! Seasoned on point! 

Steak frites-was so awesome, sauce was good. I asked for rare and guess what..i recieve my rare steak...

Duck confit-was super crispy, a bit salty but thats okay you have the salad that counters it.

After all the food that We ordered plus a bottle of 2011 bordeaux, the damage was less than $150 (tax&amp;tip included)..

Overall, when you&#39;re in NYC...give this place a try...my recommendation go during weekday and make reservation, like a said they&#39;re small...

Bon app√©tit!"

Our party of 3 arrived for brunch with no reservation and with an apology were asked to wait 10 minutes for a table. While we waited we were brought mimosas on the house. Our table was ready soon after and we had the set brunch menu. The service was perfect. Friendly, knowledgeable and helpful without being overbearing. The food itself was divine and will make me go back again and again.

This place was awesome! Imagine a busy, bustling, underground speakeasy type vibe with candle light coolness. It is very loud, and you have to yell across the table, but it&#39;s part of the charm.

 I haven&#39;t had an affordable cheese plate that was as delightful as The Cellar&#39;s, and the service was great. I asked for a wine recommendation from the server and he was spot-on.

Ordered a 3 Cheese Beecher&#39;s platter and here is how it went:
Blue Cheese - Not amazing, but still good.
The Brie was possibly the creamiest I&#39;ve ever had and the last cheese (can&#39;t remember which) had a smoky flavor with a hint of delicious.
There was a fig and cherry jam which paired really well with the rest of the plate.

Lastly, even on a Friday, I was able to get a communal table for two in about 20 minutes (which is good!). Overall, really nice time, good vibe, good food, and good wine. Can&#39;t really ask much more!"

Anyway, I came here with two friends last Friday around 7pm. I was told that the estimated waiting time is one hour and I put my name and number down. The host told me they would text me when the table is ready and I received a confirmation text shortly that my group is on the waiting list. I looked around Beecher&#39;s sandwich bar portion of the place and thankfully we got a table after 40 minutes. 

I got two draft beers (the entire draft beer selection) $8 and it was good but not fantastic. We got Cheesemonger&#39;s three cheese plate ($16) with baguette and jams &amp; chocolate that are paired with each cheese. They were really good and I wish I got red wine instead to ho with the cheese plate. We each got tomato soup ($7) and it was the best creamy cheese tomato soup I ever had, but the size of the bowl was tiny. Lastly, the famous mac &amp; cheese - the squash one we ordered ran out of ingredients so we got kale one instead and yes, it was the best mac &amp; cheese I had in a long time and I loved the little spicy kicks it had. 

Overall, the service and foods are excellent but I still think that everything in Cellar is overpriced. Next time when I visit, I&#39;ll probably stay with Beecher&#39;s."

Go on in on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. It&#39;s the least crowded brunch spot in Manhattan I&#39;ve been to with food you&#39;ll be craving on a daily. 

Between three girls we opted for the mac trio a few tomato soups and a salad. 

The mac trio is NOT on the menu but includes ramekin sized mac &amp; cheese that will fill up an average Joe. It&#39;s priced at $20. We opted for The Best, Mushroom and Pork and I was surely impressed with the cheesy texture and taste. Not too salty and melt in your mouth worthy bites of mac &amp; cheese will surely make you want to finish all three ramekins by yourself. 

The tomato soup was also equally as good. It tasted like cheese was melted in the soup giving a texture I wasn&#39;t opposed to but it surely caught me by surprise. 

Overall, the servers are helpful and and the food is delicious.

I do think it&#39;s a better place on weekends when it&#39;s not as crowded but god forbid you try and come on a weekday at 6-ish, they rush you on a drink order, won&#39;t let you sit until your &#34;entire party&#34; is there (even when there are open tables), and come by several times asking for you to pay up and get out. (which is not the experience at all when you come on weekends)

They even have a designated seating area for drinks where you are asked to get up at 7pm. In the past, I have not felt rushed or felt as though I was inconveniencing the wait staff when I have come in and ordered drinks.

What made it worse is that the last time I was there, I had extra charges added to my bill. They corrected the mistake but the waiter was incredibly defensive when I merely mentioned the inconsistency.

To their credit, they do have great wines, cheese, and meals. Their &#34;world&#39;s best&#34; mac and cheese is truly incredible. Props to the Beecher&#39;s cheese that goes into it. Great cheese plate and their bartender&#39;s cocktail is always superb. And when I stroll in on weekends, the experience is lovely. So I am resolved to giving them 3 stars."

As we were walked down to the bar they told us that the seats were for dining and if you only wanted to drink you could sit at the bar. Which would&#39;ve been fine except for the bar was full. Do we saw a little couch and thought maybe this is part of the bar? It&#39;s not actually a dining space.  So we sat and then we&#39;re asked to move because we weren&#39;t eating. Let me get this right you want me to pay $15.00 for a cocktail but I can&#39;t sit down at a table? Also let me say there were probably 8 other tables open that people could sit at. So we left. If you don&#39;t want my money I will find a place that does. We went across the street to the grain and found a whiskey bar with live music.

I called  the day before and the man on the phone said that I didn&#39;t need a reservation. However, when we got there we had to wait 30-40 minutes. 

THE FOOD:

We ordered the French onion soup which was the best I have had in a long time and not over cheesey!, the deviled eggs, the &#34;worlds best&#34; Mac and cheese and the meat balls.

The French onion soup gets 5 stars. The worlds best Mac and cheese gets 4 stars- I feel like it was missing an element to make it thicker, maybe cream or another type of cheese? And the meatballs were delicious, however the main course dish only had 2 meatballs. With 3 drinks and tip, the meal amounted to $95 for two people.

Before trying some out some of the cheeses at cellar&#39;s, I&#39;ve always like my cheese in melted form - pizza, grilled cheese, mac &amp; cheese etc. I would eat a cheese plate now and then but never truly enjoy it. However, the house cheeses at Beecher&#39;s are SO good and so well-paired that it truly opened my cheese-eating world. The exact cheese that changed my life - the No Woman - it almost tastes like potato chips (in the best way possible), but it&#39;s actually spiced with Jamaican jerk spices. The 2nd cheese that changed my life - the smoked aka Beecher&#39;s version of a gouda. 

This place is also known for their &#34;World&#39;s Best&#34; mac and cheese. Is it the best ever? Probably not, but it&#39;s pretty darn good. Made with penne instead of mac, it&#39;s ooey gooey and creamy. 

What to avoid here - the salads can be pretty hit or miss.

Also good to know - the wait can be long at dinner time. And the restaurant is 21+ only."

We went for lunch right at 12pm, which was kind of funny because that&#39;s when it opens and we were the only ones seated for probably the first 20 minutes (private dining!). I hear this place is more of a dinner place anyway, so that may be why it was initially empty also. The vibe is dimly lit, cool couches and loungey vibe. Its located in the basement of Beechers Handmade Cheese (where you can buy cheeses and sandwiches to-go), so since its in the basement, we were pretty sure we heard the subway next door which shook the whole place a bit Lol. 

Our waiter was great, often checking it on us and refilling our waters, and answered any questions we had. We came here for the mac and cheese, but since they have about 7 options, we were torn with which ones to choose. I asked the waiter if we can do a sampler, and apparently even though its not on the menu he said he could! For $20 we got 3 different macs - the pulled pork, mushroom, and buffalo mac. My favorite shockingly was the one I thought I&#39;d like the least - the mushroom mac, because the cheese was amazing in that one. The pulled pork was a close second, and the buffalo was least fave only because it was slightly spicy but still pretty good.  The only thing I was slightly disappointed in is that they didn&#39;t have any grilled cheeses on their Cellar menu (only upstairs at Beechers to-go)- my sister asked if they had the grilled cheese mac and cheese that she must have seen on instagram but the waiter said they only had that like once, hmm. I definitely recommend you ask for the off-the-menu mac sampler if you go!!! The check came on a mini cheese board which was adorable also, nice little touch."

1. Worlds best (Mac and cheese) - really good especially at the top with the 

1. Caesar salad with croutons and flagship - really solid. Friend ordered it but I ended up eating a lot. Croutons were super crunchy and tasty. Flagship cheese is their cheddar cheese, very tasty as well 

3. Kale / pepper mac and cheese - kale was pretty flavorless and overall had a strange taste. Would not order again

To start, we went with an order of the deviled eggs. Though I really enjoyed the flavor that was imparted in this dish, I thought that the cut of the green onion made it hard to eat as it was a bit fibrous.

For the next portion of the meal we split an order of the mac and cheese trio and the steak. 

The mac and cheese trio came with three choices (curried cauliflower/sweet onion, crab/old bay aioli/breadcrumbs, pork belly/pickled fennel). I thought that all were alright, with the crab probably being my favorite of the bunch. However, the onion in the first one was a bit too crunchy for me and the pork belly ended up being very burnt in the last one.

The steak was also very lackluster for me as it was a tiny portion and did not have that memorable flavor you might expect to have from a small cut of steak.

In addition, I had a couple of drinks including the Teddy&#39;s tea and the one-seven-five and was not particularly impressed with those either.

Overall, this restaurant is located in a great space underneath the Beechers Cheeseshop and really is the perfect spot for a date or catchup with a friend, however the food and drinks were not up to par and slightly underwhelming.

The menu has a great variety of food. Of course we had to do a cheese and charcuterie plate along with the Mac and cheese sampler. We got the 3 cheese monger which was Gouda, goat and bleu cheese. It was also served with French bread, almonds, chocolate and delicious jams. There were many other appetizing options for food.

We had a group come in around 6 without a reservation, but the helpful waitstaff at The Cellar gave us free reign over the lounge area, which has an assortment of sofas, seats, and tables. It was perfect for us, and we spent the next hour-plus taking advantage of the happy hour menu (daily until 7).

Happy hour options are kind of limited - there&#39;s one &#34;bartender&#39;s choice&#34; cocktail, which that night was a solid lemon/ginger/apple/seltzer vodka, a couple wines/beers, and a few dishes, including a couple of salads, a cheese board, and a mac-and-cheese.  We ended up getting pretty much everything, and were totally happy with what came out. The mac-and-cheese was our favorite: baked penne with Beecher&#39;s flagship cheese. We may or may not have gotten several orders by the time we finished.

Considering how much I&#39;ve read on how busy The Cellar gets, it never filled up while we were there. I&#39;m not complaining since we were able to spread out comfortably, but I don&#39;t know if you can chalk it up completely to the absolutely nasty weather outside that day.

Happy hour is from 3-7pm, with a nice selection of food/drink for cheap (relatively). Got a $6 house cocktail to start - a mango infused concoction that wasn&#39;t too strong. For the meal, shared the famous mac and cheese ($8), cheese plate ($8), and a couple glasses of the house red ($6 each). I don&#39;t remember exactly which cheeses I got for the plate, but they were fantastic. One was rich and creamy, while the other was harder with a small kick to the end. Mac (penne) and cheese was well done, crisped edges and flavorful. Slightly on the greasy side so wasn&#39;t able to finish.

I really liked Beecher&#39;s flagship cheese-it&#39;s fairly soft and intensely creamy with the right level of salt. I also got a bartender&#39;s special cocktail (bartender decides what to make) and it was delicious.

Service was very good and the place was pretty empty right when I got there at 5 pm on a Thursday, but started filling up by 6 pm.

Dim light, relaxing atmosphere (depending on what time you come), and ideal for small groups, but not the best place to take for a first date. My boyfriend and I came here for our friend&#39;s birthday lunch and it was the perfect place for a friend that respects and loves wine, cheese, and good food.

Service was on point and food was phenomenal! We did two cheese plates and one meat plate (don&#39;t remember the names, sorry). It was an interesting and different way of enjoying food, something that my boyfriend &amp; I don&#39;t typically do. Some of our friends had a bottle of wine, but the boyfriend and I just kept it casual and had: Original Sin &amp; Pumpkin Ale. The Pumpkin Ale was different, tasted more wheat than pumpkin. We also ordered a few different entrees/appetizers to share and try:

Crab, old bay aioli, bread crumbs (Mac &amp; Cheese) - a friend ordered this to share and oh boy, was it full of crab and cheese deliciousness! Every bite was like crab and cheese heaven! Possibly one of the best mac &amp; cheeses that I&#39;ve had so far.

Pork belly, pickled fennel stem (Mac &amp; Cheese) - another friend ordered this and it tasted yummy, but not as good as the crab mac &amp; cheese.

Mushroom Tart (shitake, crimini, and portabella) - I ordered this and it was mushroom creamy heaven! The tart tasted buttery and it was very crunchy and tasted really good with the creamy mushroom sauce. It was on the saltier side, but overall I liked it.

Mussels - My boyfriend ordered the mussels. These definitely weren&#39;t the best mussels we&#39;ve had because they were very tiny and there wasn&#39;t that much mussels. The sauce/broth felt a little bland.

Overall, I really liked the atmosphere at The Cellar. It was a different dining experience compared to what I am used to.

As the name predicts, this place is located in a basement (conveniently placed below a cheese shop), so the lighting is dim.

Since we weren&#39;t going to really be eating a whole meal, my friends and I decided to sit off to the side on a cow print couch which was really cool. It was just the type of laid back atmosphere we were looking for. 

They have a decent selection of wines, and we decided to split a bottle of the dry reisiling. I split a happy hour order of the &#34;worlds best&#34; mac &amp; cheese and it was certainly yummy. It was deliciously cheesy but slightly a little too peppery for my tastes. We also ordered a cheese plate which was also a nice little snack!

I&#39;d definitely be back to try some of their other meals which all looked and sounded awesome as they passed by!"

One of the unique things about The Cellar is that Beecher&#39;s is upstairs. So you know that the cheese are going to be great and pair well with the wine. I highly recommend the chessemonger&#39;s plate.Basically any dish that has cheese for it, you should go for it.

The vibes are dope. it is a cellar but when you walk it, it has this candlelit, trendy vibe. Kicking it with your friends on one of the large couches with wine, cheese, and snacks is probably one of the greatest things. When I went, the service was a little slow. It took us about 20 minutes to get the check.

Overall, if you&#39;re in the area, it&#39;s definitely one of the better wine bars in the area. The Cellar focuses on things that it does well and has a wonderful vibe to match it. Hopefully, I will be able to make it in time for happy hour one day."

...but it was worth the wait. 

I recommend the kale salad, meatballs, and of course the Mac and cheese.

The scallops were good but too salty. The burrata was incredible but I had to scrape the sauces and garnish it comes with off because it was way too over powering. Ask for that on the side if you can.

The portions are smaller so I recommend getting a bunch of different items and sharing!"

This was the first ever ginger cocktail that wasn&#39;t overpoweringly ginger so I highly recommend it for those who want to try new things but also want to enjoy and finish their drink. If you&#39;re not starving, I&#39;d suggest the beecher&#39;s three cheese plate. Couldn&#39;t remember exactly what we got but the gouda and the black peppered (something else) cheeses were so good.

Atmosphere / ambiance are wonderful. Had to hunt a little to find the cellar was an actual cellar/  basement of the Beechers cheese location but that made it more interesting... 

Service from the host upstairs and downstairs to the servers - very friendly.

The combination cheese platter - delicious . As was the prosciutto. And our Shiraz/ wine was great.

I was so impressed by the portable at table phone chargers. Wow . I constantly need to charge my phone, and when I asked if I could charge behind the bar, voila ... A circular charger to keep at our table in exchange for an ID... I think this may have impressed me more and made me as happy as the cheese !"

It&#39;s a nice rustic place and not very bright. I can imagine it becomes harder to chat when full, but when it&#39;s not it&#39;s quite pleasant. The music isn&#39;t too loud, the serving is good and the menu is short but interesting. Even though their speciality is mac &amp; cheese, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a children friendly place - I got asked for my ID before sitting down (don&#39;t know if this is common in the U.S., but I was surprised).

The cocktails are definitely not watered down. I had the &#34;published&#34; cocktail and it felt quite strong. In my books, that&#39;s a good thing! The &#34;worlds best&#34; mac and cheese is served boiling hot, so some patience is needed until it cools down properly. It is quite good if you&#39;re looking for something cheese-y, but I don&#39;t think it actually is the &#34;worlds best&#34;.

Granted, I&#39;m not a huge fan of cheese, but the menu appeared diverse enough to assure me that I wouldn&#39;t be stuck ordering a block of cheese as my meal. Plus, the atmosphere didn&#39;t seem to be that of a typical wine bar; rather, it reminded me of a casual, intimate clubhouse tucked away from the rest of the city. 

My friend and I arrived after six on a weeknight a couple months ago, and unsurprisingly, the tavern was packed full of customers who, like us, had stopped by after work. The Cellar isn&#39;t spacious by any means, but it takes full advantage of the room it does have to offer - there are several places to sit, from standard tables and chairs, to lounge areas with couches; of course, there&#39;s the bar too. Despite how busy she was that night, Marissa, our server, was very friendly and attentive the entire time.

The sweet pea soup was creamy, but hearty as well. If only the bowl was bigger! I noticed that it&#39;s been replaced by tomato soup on the menu, so it&#39;s probably a seasonal option. Still, it&#39;s worth the price, even if it&#39;s just a tiny bowl. My friend tried the &#34;world&#39;s best&#34; mac &amp; cheese, and subsequently joined the ranks of those who agree that the dish lives up to its famous title. She shared the same disappointment over cost vs. portion size though.

For dessert, we ordered the caramel-apple bread pudding, expecting it to be on the smaller side like the other dishes we&#39;d tasted. Instead, my friend and I received a huge serving that we could barely finish! In the end, we both left the Cellar satisfied and ready to return for one of their flatbreads or signature cocktails."

We visited at 6p on Saturday, and it was only halfway filled, so early weekends is definitely the way to go.

- The house cabernet is delicious, which is all I can say as a person who knows nothing about wine. All I can tell you is that it&#39;s slightly fruity, oh so smooth and easy to drink several glasses, if your face doesn&#39;t burn like the August moon after drinking alcohol (oh, the sad plight of the Asian). We ordered both $8 HH plates and too much more:

- the world&#39;s best mac and cheese - I was surprised to see the HH mac and cheese was a huge portion - plenty for three to four people to share, nod their heads as their tongues and teeth make way through the thick cheese to all agree: &#39;not sure if it&#39;s the world&#39;s best, but it&#39;s good.&#39; It is good. Not too rich and full of tangy cheese flavor.

- the HH cheesemonger plate comes with four slices of cheese, two of their house specialty which is a Gruyere blend of sorts, paired with pickled cornichons and red pepper, and two of a milder cheese which is steeped in Asian red wine, paired with dried figs. A small crusty baguette centers the slate slab. This plate is fine - it&#39;s a cheese plate. You kinda know what you&#39;re going to get here.

- the tomato soup is delicious...unexpectedly cheesy (okay! we know we&#39;re at a cheese factory, but seriously! so cheesy!). It&#39;s best enjoyed with the grilled bread that is served with the 

- meatballs, which were a nice blend of beef, pork and veal. Two large honkers come on a plate with a couple pieces of grilled bread. They&#39;re good, flavorful, not too dry, but probably not worth the $19 pricetag. Yes, that makes it $9.50 per meatball which is a lot for one ball of...anything.

- the pesto flatbread is a crazy mess of an arugula salad on crisp flatbread, drizzled with olive oil, topped with pomegranate, walnut, and chunks of soft, crumbly cheese. So fun. Very tasty.

- the hot chicken comes as four chicken legs that have been fancily cleaned at the legs so you can hold it proudly with your pinkies up. The thin batter comes away easily with every bite, as your teeth sink into the incredibly tender chicken. The chicken itself is pretty bland, but the spicy sauce on the plate is delectably spicy. Each butter-soaked crouton in the plate is a spicy punch in the face - I ate every single one of them. So yummy!

If I come again, I&#39;d probably get all new stuff, because there&#39;s nothing that I absolutely loved, but nothing that I hated, and so I&#39;d probably just get to try new stuff that I wouldn&#39;t hate, which is not too bad!"

It was un(der)seasoned short ribs sitting on top of a tasteless white sauce served with bland jus. Do not order the short ribs. Seriously. Bad food breaks my heart and this just tore my heart to shreds.

We also got a caesar salad and their famous mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was good, but nothing to write home about. Their salad had an unusual twist and was served with a spicy oil drizzled over the top- I didn&#39;t hate it. 

Their happy hour cocktail was boring, but their wine list was pretty comprehensive. If you are going for just wine and cheese- go for it. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be happy. If you&#39;re looking to grab dinner or if you&#39;re looking for an interesting happy hour spot, look elsewhere."

This is why I love coming to the Cellar - it has all these things that I absolutely love!  The Cellar is right below Beecher&#39;s Handmade Cheese and is an actual cheese cellar underneath a cheese shop in this cozy space perfect for dining. 

I absolutely love their happy hour every day from 4-7pm (yes including weekends). They offer $6 house wine, $6 infused cocktail (bartender&#39;s choice), $8 mac and cheese, and $7 cheese plates. Beechers often advertise as having &#39;the best mac &amp; cheese&#39; in the world. It&#39;s certainly not the best mac and cheese I&#39;ve ever had - but it is pretty delicious.  Rich and creamy - $7 for a large plate of mac and cheese is a steal! 

The cheese plate offered is a bit small - not enough cheese on them, but it is happy hour so I don&#39;t expect too much. You will get your cheese fix just from the mac and cheese. Their tomato soup ($7) is fantastic, but a bit over priced. 

Service was great as well. This is a great trendy place for date night or with a small group of friends to catch up. They also accept reservations for a party of 6 or more."

Been here a couple of times and have done take out. This time we did happy hour and crossed into dinner. The happy hour specials seem decent. We ordered a cheese plate with our cocktails. You can get salad, worlds best mac and cheese or a cheese plate during happy hour. For dinner - mac and cheese! This time I had the curried cauliflower and onion - that was really tasty. Previously I&#39;ve had worlds best and the crab. I would have to say the crab and cauliflower are tied as my favorites so far. Truffle is next on my list when that comes back on the menu. 

I do wish they&#39;d bring the grilled cheese martini back. I had wanted to try it, but they no longer make it.

We also ordered the mac, which was very much how I like it - not too saucy, mostly cheesy.  Again, not a monstrous portion, but a reasonable price and good for a taste.

They have a happy hour infused cocktail - I&#39;m not typically into vodka drinks, but this was a pear and clove vodka concoction that was perfectly seasonal - I could&#39;ve had several more, but since the bites were small best to keep the drinks in check.

The space is quite atmospheric: romantically dark, candle lit, comfy seats with an assortment of table arrangements and a large bar along one wall. The menu offered an interesting array of tapas items. We chose the 3 signature cheeses with prosciutto, burrata with tomatoes, tomato soup with croutons, and meat balls. Everything was extremely delicious right down to the bread. The service was top notch as well.

Copious amounts of alcohol have never been quite my thing (being an Asian female of rather small stature), so I&#39;m always happy to see a place that offers a good selection of edibles in addition to their drink specials. It was the main draw for my friend and I, and we were quick to set a date to meet after work one evening.

The Cellar is, as the name would suggest, located underneath Beecher&#39;s Handmade Cheese. It&#39;s an ingenious strategy that encouraged plenty of impulse (or slightly drunken) purchases, I&#39;m sure, and makes full use of the space in Flatiron. The room is surprisingly spacious, however, with a decent amount of room against the bar as well as a good number of tables spaced across the room. We&#39;d thankfully arrived on the earlier end of the evening, so had our choice of seating and were efficiently given the drink and food specials for the night.

The House Cocktail for the evening clocked in at a mere $5, and was a blend of Vodka, Blood Orange and Apple Juice, and a dash of Club Soda for added lightness. It was refreshing, sweet, and thankfully not too alcoholic (although this is usually not a good thing, depending on who you ask). Thankfully, we had a few cheese-centric bites to pair with it..

First, Beecher&#39;s &#34;World&#39;s Best Mac and Cheese&#34; may not truly be the best in the world, but it is a tasty dish. The penne pasta was al dente with just the right amount of crispness at the edges and doused in a generous mixture of melted cheese. It&#39;s a dish best consumed once it arrives on the table, as the cooler it gets, the more flavor gets lost. The Cheese Plate is also an easy order, as a selection of cheeses decided on by the cheesemonger is served with sliced bread, pickles, and a sweet jam. Our plate that night included both firm and softer cheeses, which satisfied both of our palates. Also worth an order is the Caesar Salad, a simple but pleasantly fresh plate with chopped romaine, croutons, their Flagship Caesar dressing, and a dash of chili oil.

Given the strong menu selection and the location in Flatiron, The Cellar unsurprisingly gets crowded during the workweek. As they don&#39;t take reservations, it&#39;s best to come early to secure your spot; otherwise, you&#39;ll be tempted to wander through the aisles of Beecher&#39;s where you might just pick up your latest culinary splurge..."

The atmosphere here is amazing and really enjoyed some of the unique lighting they used. We started off with a couple clocktowers which were pretty good to start, then we ordered some baked curd which could of just been out meal for the night...it was seriously the best part and a must have! 

Then for the main course we tried the Worlds Best Mac &amp; Cheese and the Mac &amp; Cheese with crab. Both were amazing and definitely made sure we didn&#39;t leave hungry.

Perhaps it was kind of awkward for me to order fetucchini &amp; a place known for mac &amp; cheese. Whatever it was, I just wasn&#39;t impressed (and it&#39;s not so hard to impress me). I won&#39;t be back. 

We&#39;ll start with the food. The Mac &amp; Cheese was AMAZING. If I was writing the reviews solely on this, it would be four stars. Still, it is kind of pricey and I&#39;m sure I can get mac &amp; cheese just as good elsewhere. The fetucchini was super salty and because of this tough to even finish. Maybe someone in the kitchen had a hand cramp that night, or forgot they had already salted our dish? Who knows. Unfortunately, this just wasn&#39;t a good dish and would be a &#34;miss.&#34; I would not recommend it. 

The worst part of this restaurant is the atmosphere and cleanliness. The bathrooms were dirty. My mom always told me growing up you can judge the cleanliness of the kitchen by the cleanliness of the bathrooms in a restaurant and I can&#39;t get that out of my head. I would recommend the restaurant stay on top of this. Towels and soap should be stocked so patrons, and more importably waiters and kitchen staff can wash their hands. The restaurant itself was super loud. I wanted to have a nice night with my husband, but we were crammed at a long table between multiple twenty-somethings with all of us yelling at our partners just to hear one another. It was terrible. I would recommend the restaurant installing rugs, or some sort of acoustic sound absorbing devices to help with this problem. 

I do love the concept of the restaurant, with a few small tweaks I think it could be a really great place."

Shared the beechers cheese plater with three types of cheddar cheese. It tasted amazing and came with nice side pairings of sauce and berries.

We popped in here for after dinner drinks because of the yelp rating. The only reason it gets 2 stars is from the host who was very friendly.

We sat at the bar. To say it simple the bartender was a dick. He definitely thought he was too good to serve us (I am wearing a button down and khakis, the wife dressed up for dinner at Gramercy Tavern, so we weren&#39;t dressed like slobs). I asked for a rum and diet, his response was &#34;We don&#39;t do artificial sugar&#34; and in that snobby tone, you know what I&#39;m talking about. My wife got a vodka cranberry and they used Ocean Spray...yeah Ocean Spray doesn&#39;t use any artificial sweeteners at all. The lady&#39;s drink went empty, no offer of a refill. He slammed our tab down before we took our first sip, no one else at the bar had a check in front of them. He wanted us out for some reason, maybe we aren&#39;t cool enough? I used to put checks out as people ordered drinks when I bartended, but we were definitely the only ones. 

I ordered a second drink, he threw it together like he was at a college party. For a $13 cocktail you should put some effort at least stir or shake the drink. It was kind of terrible. 

The best part was a server came back to talk to the bartender (right in front of us and 2 other bar patrons) Loudly she says to her fellow employee &#34;I hate when first dates come here, because it&#39;s awkward when they figure out who is going to pay because neither of them can afford to be here&#34;. I think that sentence defines the shit attitude of the service staff here. 

After I threw down my drink we couldn&#39;t wait to get out. I regret the 2nd drink and walking in this place in the first place."

The menu features a variety of small plates that are sure to please all (vegetarians and meat lovers)!
You can never go wrong with the burrata salad or flatbreads, but don&#39;t miss out on the baked cheese curds, short rib, and octopus. 

And now they are featuring BRUNCH on the weekends! Be prepared for a well-crafted brunch menu. You will find yourself torn between the salmon, french toast, and hash. The cider aioli on the salmon is divine. And the duck fat home fries...bliss.

It&#39;s a cool spot, with bar and table seating. Our host told us that you have to order food to sit at a table, but he was pretty clueless when I asked him what constituted food (i.e. could we just get a cheese plate? Short answer is yes).

Their menu has a happy hour section, with $5 cocktails, $6 wine/food, and $8 mac and cheese or a cheese plate.

The cheeseplate is dealer&#39;s choice. We ended up with their Flagship cheddar gruyere and a nice gouda from Wisconsin. Served with bread, walnuts and some pickled veggies. All very good.

The cocktails, however, were really meh. Their $5 HH cocktail was a pineapple jalapeno vodka. I assume the vodka was infused with jalapeno because it was plenty spicy. However, the pineapple part of it just tasted like they soaked pineapple in water and served that to you (rather than using actual pineapple juice).

I also ordered one of their regularly priced cocktails (regular price is pretty up there). The Bedrock was made with gin, creme de violette, combier, red wine, and a fizz on top. It actually was pretty bad. Very off-balanced.

Other than that, I had a fine time here. Come for the cheese and not the drinks, I guess."

It is a great pay day, Tax refund, or Student loan reimbursement spot. It&#39;s really all about the food though, scrumptious, tasty, juicy, tender, rich, and flavorful are great ways to describe them.

When you walk into Beecher&#39;s New York, there are stairs to the left where you can go downstairs and enter the world of The Cellar. It is dimlit, so it can be somewhat romantic. It has a speakeasy type of ambiance to it. 

If you want to sit at a table, then you have to order food. My group just finished eating dinner, so we were kind of full, but we forced ourselves to order food with drinks. We actually kept it light and ordered a cheese &amp; charcuterie plate. We also got a side of olives. 

We got the Beecher&#39;s 3 cheese plate, and then took the recommendations of our waiter on 3 meats for the charcuterie. To be honest, i forget which cheeses and meats we actually had. I didn&#39;t even try them because I was full from dinner. However, everyone seemed to enjoy them. I liked how they paired the meats and cheeses with a spread to complement the taste of the respective meat/cheese. The castelvetrano olives i did try, and they were really tasty. They have pits, but they were nice and bright green and they were pretty mild in flavor. They weren&#39;t too salty, which I really appreciated. 

For a cocktail, I recommend the Player&#39;s Club if you like your bourbon and egg whites. I like 4 Roses, so when I saw it paired up with egg white, I had to try it. It was silky and not too strong. It really was a tasty drink. Def want to come back here for the food and to try out their other cocktails."

I had the steak (served medium rare without variance), which was great - though I found the amount of onions to be overwhelming.  More steak would have been ideal.  

I was going for something to take the edge off after a hellish journey across town in snow, ice, slush and chaos.  Rather than scotch, I opted for the Players Club cocktail.  As a member of the Players just down the street in Gramercy Park, I was curious.  Once I saw the use of egg whites and Bourbon, I was sold.  It provided the taste and feel I was in search of, so I ordered another.  I&#39;d recommend the same to any gentleman of our own class and standing.

Lastly, there was dessert.  I was more interested in a cappuccino, but the scoop of ice cream was surrounded by the most delectable and clearly home baked gourmet bits of chocolate cookie.  I was pleasantly surprised and left a healthy tip for the lovely person in coat check.  They&#39;re not always so nice are they?  But when they are, I feel moved to show my appreciation.

We both had the mac and cheese and soup &amp; salad.  Unfortunately the mac and cheese was nowhere near as good as we hoped given all the hype.  Sorry, but I felt like what am I missing?  this is not great as the name implies; I had high hopes but it was pretty mediocre.

Downstairs is the bar and table seating. The set up is more like a restaurant than bar. The bar is all the way in the back and looks kind of small and unimportant. We asked the host if we could sit at a table, since the bar was full, and he couldn&#39;t give us a straight answer. He seemed kind of confused in general about the place.

The happy hour menu has specials for cocktails, wine, and food. We ordered a cheese plate and 2 cocktail specials. The cocktails were very mediocre. It was supposed to be a pineapple jalapeno vodka, which sounds good, but it ended tasting very watered down. The cheese plate is surprisingly quite simple for a specialty cheese shop (I&#39;ve had fancier cheese plates in random bars), with two kinds of cheese, bread, nuts, and pickles. The cheeses that day were their Flagship and a Wisconsin gouda. However, both of the cheeses were quite excellent.

The $5 happy hour cocktail is a bartender&#39;s choice, and last night happened to be an Arnold Palmer. Would not recommend: the drink was highly watered down and didn&#39;t taste of any of the supposed components. I would get the $6 glass of wine next time!

However, the &#34;world&#39;s best mac &amp; cheese&#34; was a hit. The cheese was pleasantly sharp &amp; breadcrumbs gave the dish a nice texture. If I had to nitpick, I would have preferred the penne al dente - it was very soft. All in all a solid dish that more than made up for the drink."

It had an unusual taste which I could not finish. I usually don&#39;t waste food but the taste was just not good.. I also ordered the bartender&#39;s choice of an infused cocktail drink (containing rum and soda) and was disappointed on how watered down the drink was. It tasted like water with a tiny bit of sizzle. I would not recommend these two items I ordered. The atmosphere of the restaurant was a little dark but had a nice relaxing feel. I was with a party of 13 which was good that they had enough space for us."

The Mac and cheese is a must, obviously as it is a cheese factory. Customer service is pretty good but they obviously have a lot to manage as this place gets packed after work. The only issue I had were the acoustics- it was SO loud we basically had to yell across the table to hear one another, which is why I can&#39;t give a 5. I would go back-definitely make a reservation though as this place is rather popular."

Like, $5-7 for select items cheap.  That&#39;s stellar for anywhere nice, let alone a wine bar in the basement of a cheese shop.  It&#39;s not exactly hidden, but the Cellar still has the vibe down.  Lots of tables with cow hide booths, moody lighting, random weird pictures of animals on the walls.  Service was friendly without hovering which was good.  I was surprised we were 1 of only 4-5 tables (place isn&#39;t tiny) whereas other brunch places nearby were packed.

We got the &#34;world&#39;s best&#34; mac and cheese.  That&#39;s a hell of a thing to put on a menu, but if anyone could do it a cheese shop would.  It was definitely great!  The cheese selection was high quality as expected, the cheese was browned on top, and the flavor profile was layered with both sharp and subtle cheeses.  I&#39;m not a huge mac and cheese fan but I have to say this is the best one I&#39;ve had in recent memory.  The wine I got was great, and my friend&#39;s drink (off the regular menu) was very good as well.  We wanted to catch up on a Sunday with minimal BS, and that&#39;s exactly what we got.  I&#39;d recommend the Cellar regardless of the happy hour, but ESPECIALLY for the happy hour."

Went to Barnes Joo on the other side of Broadway and in 5 minutes the found a place for us, and had some great food and cocktails.

There is also a great selection of food on the happy hour menu that includes a meat and cheese plate! Yes, that&#39;s right.  In addition to the meat and cheese plate my friend and I shared, I got the Mac and cheese and a caesar salad. All delicious and promptly served.  Server was very delightful.

The food was delicious and just as I ordered. I will definitely be back to dine in. Thank you HS

...Finally tried HS again last night, this time eating at the actual place. Amanda was my waitress and she was awesome. Very attentive, polite and did not rush us at all. She also did not disappear when it came time to ask for the check which seems to happen far too often on Staten Island. Amanda was genuine and just such a sweetheart. The other servers brought us our food as soon as it came out so the staff really do seem to make sure everyone gets their food as fresh as it can be. I really enjoyed my experience. The place looks great and it has a very welcoming vibe. The Hugo burger, buffalo cauliflower and Mexican fries were delicious."

The reason why I gave it 3/5 stars was because their entreees wasn&#39;t as good as the appetizers. Don&#39;t get me wrong the burgers were cooked well and the pull pork sand which was a little bland. The French fries are mushy and lack flavor.

Nice place to go for a beer/lunch. But don&#39;t go if you are starving looking for a fantastic meal."

Mac and cheese with goldfish cracker topping - eh not great. Not creamy enough. 
Fried pickles - tasted better. Batter wasn&#39;t the best. Was a bit mushy 
Chicken wings - regular. Also not great. Not very tasty.
Mixed platter consisting of a Bavarian pretzel which was delicious. Mini rice balls were good. Some kind of a fried dumpling with corned beef and sauerkraut inside which was interesting. Like a fried up Ruben thing.

Unfinished brick walls and random wood planks wall give it a cool and funky vibe. Go for happy hour and try some of their apps for $5 (usually $8). Definitely have the wings- Buffalo flavor. Their is something different about the sauce, but in the best way possible. Also give the General Tso&#39;s Cauliflower a try.

We were greeted immediately upon arrival. The location itself is decorated really rustic and cute. Definitely divey. 

If I was rating just their customer service I would rate this place a perfect 5 stars as the waitress/bartender assisting us all night was so sweet and attentive! Really made the whole experience worth it.

We order the fried pickles and Thai Sweet Chili wings. The fried pickles were good, and the chipotle sauce actually had a chipotle kick to it. The Thai Sweet Chili wings had a good sauce but I felt the chicken could have been cooked a little better, a little more crispy. The skin was very soft. I had the Mac n cheese with pulled pork. This was amazing! I absolutely enjoyed it and can&#39;t wait to have the rest tomorrow for lunch!

This place also has a skee ball machine and a more restaurant area all the way in the back for those who just want to eat or are bringing kids. I would definitely suggest this location for a night out.

I bought my review down to 4 star because of how uncomfortable I was, temperature wise. Either the Ac doesn&#39;t work or is barely working and it was extremely hot the whole time!"

On a Friday night in the summer the place was hoppin.  That says a lot. The crowd was various ages.  This place is just cool.  

The food.  I like the thai chili wings.  The wings don&#39;t come with any dipping sauce.  I asked for blue cheese but wanted ranch (they don&#39;t have ranch). They were crispy with just the right amount of sweetness. The pretzel is delicious.  Three dipping sauces-nailed it! The cheese is the best.  It had a beer flavor. 

Drinks? What&#39;s your fancy? They have it all.  The bartenders are friendly.  Laura helped us and was great! They use fresh ingredients like basil, raspberries, etc.  Try the basil smash or tappen park.  They have an endless list of beers on tap.  

The decor is fun.  The taps have all different familiar characters. Two Skeeball machines are in the back for $1 per game.

The owner is chill and he runs the place that way.  His employees seem happy.  I absolutely recommend you stop by if you&#39;re a local or take a $7 Uber ride from the ferry."

We sat by the bar and we noticed the drafts were super hero figures which were pretty cool. I love the fact that they had a board which had staff picks on drafts. In the back room they have 2 skee ball machines and a bunch of tables of course. Pretty cool. 

Food: ordered roasted garlic old bay wings, Mac and cheese, tator tots and fried potato chip crusted marinated chicken sandwhich. I&#39;d have to say probably best bar food I&#39;ve had. All downfall was the Mac and cheese. I&#39;m a huge Mac and cheese lover and it was pretty bland in flavor. 

Drinks: Robin, our waitress had suggested to try the two road jam draft. Wow. I loved it. My bf ordered the two road expressway which was a dark draft and he also ordered the neuburg IPA I believe. He loved it as well. 

Staff: super super cool. Super super friendly. Very attentive and always walking around.

We did fried pickles and wings to start and they were amazing and we dominated them ! 
Then we each got the same burger I think it was their signature burger and it was good but just was missing something and I feel bad saying it being they are a burger place. I will be back to give another burger a try because it&#39;s worth it.

I highly recommend the specialty HUGO burger and the general Tsos cauliflower. I ordered my burger medium rare and usually places take that as just cooking it well done (ugh) but this place served it so perfectly (hooray!) The fries are nice and service is welcoming.

Timmy is a huge asset to the bar. My boyfriend and I went to the bar for a drink one night and Timmy was nothing but accommodating and very knowledgeable on the beer selection. He was extremely interested in our beer preference and made suggestions which were on point with our likes. Our first experience at the hop shoppe was very nice. 

A week later we returned on a Saturday night, which explains the two stars. It was a hot, humid evening. The bar&#39;s air conditioning was either not on or unable to handle cooling the place down. It was very hot inside. Our waitress was okay, we often had to ask a few times for a drink or condiments as she was forgetful. The menu selection is creative, the food options are intriguing. For an appetizer we got fried pickles (which were over cooked) and empanadas, which were mediocre. My boyfriend ordered a burger, which we were expecting to be off the charts based on word of mouth. The burger was mediocre at best. The presentation was also very disappointing. 

In addition we ordered 4 baby beer shots for us and two of our friends. We didn&#39;t realize we would be charged manhattan prices for these shots. 

When it came time for our bill. I was appalled especially since I did not order a dinner. 

I walked out feeling taken advantage of and very disappointed. I wouldn&#39;t request this to friends and I really wanted to like this place. I heard great things, but my experience says otherwise. 

If you want a good bartender who is knowledgable and personable go see Timmy. If you want food, sat somewhere else on Bay Street and grab a drink here. Very disappointing."

They were helpful in their wide variety of craft beer with selections. Unexpectedly, I learned that they served food. I was thoroughly impressed. I started off with the Genera Tso&#39;s Cauliflower, which I found to be a great alternative to chicken, even being a meat eater. The food came quickly, I ordered the French Fry Crusted Marinated Chicken sandwich, which was also very good. The food quality here is of home made restaurant quality, you wouldn&#39;t expect it from a small bar location that specializes in craft beer. I feel as though they should accentuate their food menu more, seeing as the food is delicious and it also reasonably priced for the quality. They offer a wide variety of vegetarian and vegan options, while still catering to the idea of comfort and bar food. Overall I would definitely recommend it here. The space is nice also, they have an open table area for open mic&#39;s and karaoke, which also caters to the artistic feel of the neighborhood."

On our second time, we couldn&#39;t have had a better experience.  Our waitress, Amanda, is excellent at her job.  She has a great personality and passion for what she does-- it truly shows.  She was able to offer my boyfriend and myself excellent drink selections based on what we said we liked. She was spot on.  Same goes for the food. Her recommendations were definitely taken into consideration.  On thus occasion, we even had a chance to speak with the chef who created the menu.  The way he speaks of the menu and the food he creates demonstrates his passion.  This passion is reflected in the quality of the food as well.

The spicy chorizo empanadas, meatballs, bacon cheddar tator tots were all excellent. However, if you come here and cannot indulge in everything---you cannot miss out on the general Tsos cauliflower and Reuben dumplings.   They are outstanding!!! 

I cannot wait to go back again and make this a usual spot on places to dine around the island!

Well ok ok. Let&#39;s be fair. Hop Shoppe has only been open for two weeks... I&#39;ve only been here one time. But in the one time I was there I thought...this is a pretty awesome place.

Service?: Top notch. The entire staff is top of their game. Friendly and attentive. What more could you ask for? Just perfect service. 

Bar? Beyond top notch..great beer obviously. But also a nice selection of top shelf liquor. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re there for beer or mixed drinks the staff has you covered with great drinks and great service and they know how to make any amazing mixed drink you&#39;re after. 

Food? I got the &#34;hugo burger&#34;. It was nice. Pretty typical. Very tasty. A throw back burger to the previous occupants of that location. A very good burger though. I plan to try other food items in the future. Based on other customer experiences and recommendations there is a lot of great menu items to try.  Which I definitely plan on trying. 

Good luck to Hop Shoppe in the future! I love this place!!"

The Barmaid Amanda knew her stuff and made a us a great Bourbon Cocktail and the Hugo Burger was very good,
as a suggestion, home-made french fries would have made it better.

Food was amazing, very creative menu choices prepared perfectly. We came for Father&#39;s Day, and got the sampler pretzel app and General Tso&#39;s cauliflower... Amazing.

We all got a variety of burgers, and the pulled pork. All were awesome.

Fun atmosphere! When we went, there were a lotta sports fans by the bar, but a skeeball machine in the back, so everyone can be entertained. Also, super friendly staff and great service. I&#39;ll definitely go back the next time in the area."

The food is eh...hoping they work out the kinks
Went a few times to eat between 815 and 9pm and they &#39;closed the kitchen&#39;
Really?!? After calling to make sure they were serving?!?
Anyway
Food mediocre...the Ruben dumplings are actually empanadas but whatever!
The beer is amazing-great beer on tap and bottle but confusing to order as its not all listed
Again...worth the 4 stars but cmon guys work out these links!!!
Create an actual FULL beer list...
Keep the kitchen open...
Late night menu-sucks...sorry...add a burger and fries!!!
Service-mostly amazing
Four staff can be rude, rough and gruff at times
Overall-we love you"

We asked for Bloody Mary&#39;s to start. Let me just say that we have had many a Bloody Mary over time, and these were by far the worst- so bad that we couldn&#39;t finish them. Next we tried the food. The sampler was gross. The reuben dumplings were gross, they were an unidentifiable mash up of goo inside the shell. The taste was awful, nothing like a reuben. The wings were sub-par, stringy, soft, very very standard. The bacon tots were okay at best. You can&#39;t really mess up bacon tots. 

I&#39;m sure that the beer is great, and the atmosphere is cool. But as a restaurant, no go."

Myself and two of my friends went on a Friday night . There was a good amount of people at the bar and we were seated at our table after 15 minutes . Upon arrival I ordered two drinks off the drink menu . A fancy type of margarita. The bar tender was taking other patrons orders and having personal conversations prior to making my drink. Needless to say it was not serves before I was seated in the 15 minute time period . Then we were seated at the table . Service was terrible . Our waitress could not be any nicer . I just think they over worked her with way to many tables . She was moving non stop just never got a chance to ask us if we needed anything or to get us refills on our drinks .

Burger was very good, but ask for it rarer than you prefer. Cocktails are amazing. I only tried two, but the Basil Smash is really, really good. Really. I also had the Fig Smoke, which was also good and has a bit of a kick, but not as spicy as I was promised. Perhaps ask for an extra jalape√±o slice if you like it hot. 

Beer selection looks very promising, but I&#39;ll wait until next week for more accurate judgement. I wanted girlie drinks tonight."

Normally you wouldn&#39;t think pickles and celery would taste good in your cocktail but it was very tasty! I would suggest getting the General Tso cauliflower ( thanks John for making me get these) and the disco tots you will not be disappointed! 

I also really like the action figures that they used for the bar taps. Thought it was a cute idea.

I had been waiting for this place to open from the day I first saw the outside sign (I had a feeling it was going to be something great) and then one day happen to notice it opened! Basically, let&#39;s say I was there 3 times that week. And I work in the city. Anyway, let&#39;s start with the drinks! They are all delicious but my personal fav is  the Basil Smash. Jimmy the bartender also makes it the BEST. They have an awesome selection of beers, my server recommended this orange chocolatey Guinness type of beer (I&#39;m not a big beer person so I don&#39;t remember the name but it was fabulous). I like when a place offers so much that&#39;s not the norm so you as the guest get to challenge yourself and excite your taste buds by trying something new! To eat? the General Tso&#39;s Cauliflower is a MUST. Also the mini riceballs, empanadas, mac and cheese with pulled pork - list goes on and on. I&#39;m dying to try the Rueben Dumplings &amp; a Burger next! They take a simple meal and put an awesome new twist on it! If you are looking to eat at a SI establishments that is no different from another SI place than this is NOT the place for you. It&#39;s not divey, not frou frou but its PERFECT. I love the decor and vibe when you walk in - it just feels like NYC. This place could easily be on the LES or Soho/Village areas. You come here because it&#39;s cool and GOOD!."

I wish I could say it was what we expected but it was a big let down. I doubt we will be back or recommending the place to anyone.
We arrived and had the option of sitting in the bar area or going up to the dining area. The bar may have been an option for us but it was very, very warm on this summer&#39;s day. The dining room was much cooler and looked nice. The tables were old doors that have been converted so they seat 6. The other tables were tables for 2. No tables for 4...odd. We were 4 so we were seated at a table for 6. After about 5-10 minutes there, we were asked if we would give up our table for a group of 5 and move to the bar area. We said it was too warm but suggested we put together two tables for 2. Having worked in the restaurant business for years, I can say that no one wants to be asked to move but if they agree to move without any complaint, you do SOMETHING for them for the inconvenience. Maybe a round of drinks, maybe pick up an appetizer or two for them....something. Needles to say, they did nothing. 
The other issue is there is Skee Ball machine in the dining room. I&#39;m sure after dinner hours it&#39;s a lot of fun to be back there having a drink and playing Skee ball but not so much fun when trying to enjoy dinner. The family we gave up our table for had to children who had to play Skee Ball. The problem is you have to actually supervise your kids. This granola/hipster couple decided to stare at their phones while these kids were throwing heavy wooden Skee balls instead of rolling them. The startling noise is not conducive for a dinner. We were going out on a Saturday evening for dinner and there is a reason we aren&#39;t in Chuck E Cheez. Children not being supervised at dinner is the fault of the parents, not the restaurant so I can&#39;t blame them for the disruption, but maybe turn the Skee ball off.
The server was very nice and the food was pretty good. Another annoyance was looking through this huge beer menu and after a lot of reading, you select a a nice craft beer only to be told 10 minutes later they are out of it. BIG mistake. You simply CAN&#39;T be out of something that you are trying to be known for. It&#39;s like McDonalds telling you they are out of fries. 
Our apps came out quickly and were tasty. We ordered burgers and they were tasty as well. 
You can tell it is a new place that needs to work out some kinks. If they do, the place will do well. If they don&#39;t, they&#39;ll be closed before the summer is over."

First, their beer selection is as good as you can get in Staten Island and would give most places in the city a run for their money. I love the craft selection, their knowledge of the beers, and the fact that they&#39;ll let you sample the beers on tap. Second, I think the food is good and getting better. Since my first visit they added a steak frites entree that I thought was perfect. The buffalo cauliflower, the pierogis, and the disco fries are also fantastic. Finally, the decor is great. Although it&#39;s essentially a bar and grill, it&#39;s a nice spot for a date night.  I will definitely be returning for another visit soon!"

But the bar is great the bartenders are very knowledgeable, friendly and most important make great drinks.

The waiters are all very friendly and are always looking to help. We didn&#39;t wait for anything too long, the food came out at a great pace and so did the drink refills.

The food was awesome, the vegetarian spring rolls were delicious, the sauce for the fried chicken wings was great and the papaya salad was also very good and light.

I&#39;ve been to Slanted Door on multiple occasions and I have to admit, Bricolage is definitely superior here. Yes, you can get more authentic Vietnamese food for cheaper but Bricolage is great for what it is - a trendy Brooklyn restaurant.

Here is what you need to know:
1. The back patio is one of the greatest places to have a meal. Highly recommended.
2. Share everything with your friends/crew. Especially the banh xeo. It&#39;s one of the better one that I&#39;ve had in NYC.
3, Order a cocktail. They are so well made.
4. Service is all right. Pretty standard for New York.
5. Vibes are great.
6. I would stick to parties of four or less. This is not the ideal spot for large groups.
7. If you&#39;re looking for 100% authentic Vietnamese food, this is not the spot. If you&#39;re looking for good food, come here.

I thoroughly enjoy Bricolage (maybe it&#39;s the good company, maybe it&#39;s the vibe). It&#39;s definitely worth checking out at least once. And the prices are reasonable enough for the area. Give it a try, you might be surprised by how much you enjoy it."

Needed a reservation on a Sunday night around 7 and by 8 every table was filled. Tables are a bit close together, so don&#39;t talk about anything too weird, or do so at your own risk. 

Food: I had the branzino. Fish was cooked perfectly, but you will be picking out a whole lot of bones. Rookie move for a 2nd date dinner. Date had the noodle dish - came with white rice. He said the dish itself was a bit salty but the rice cut it down a bit. 

Drinks: The showstopper was hands down the Touro Ouro. First time I had cachaca and it was delicious. Strong, but very flavorful. Also had the au pear, too sweet for dinner, more of a dessert cocktail. 

Service: Service was spot on, and we had complimentary appetizer tasting of something delicious which i cannot recall the name of. 

Overall: A bit pricey, I would say for the quality of the food, but I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re paying in part for the oh so trendy atmosphere."

Tonight I tried the beef on beef.  It was visually stunning.  The beef looked liked a design on the plate! I had to ask &#39;where&#39;s the beef&#39;?!!  Everything about how this dish looked was amazing.  However looks only take you so far.  It lacked flavor.  I asked for spicy sauce to try and jazz it up.  Not good. I was very disappointed.  

The Malbec however was good.  Where was the spoon surprise?

So I have made my way through the appetizers and the food here lacks a flavor punch one would expect from Vietnamese food.

2nd visit....
Didn&#39;t take me long to come back!
Had to try more of the food and a cocktail.  Making my way through the appetizers.  The bartender is very friendly and said he loved the crepe so I had to go with that.  Everyone on Yelp seems to love the drinks so going with something new.

First up is the &#34;spoon surprise&#34;!  This time it&#39;s Anchiovy on a cracker.  Love the idea of the spoon surprise!  It&#39;s good but lived the icy spoon surprise on the previous visit.



Vietnamese crepe , banh xeo - this dish is big!!! Easily share between 2 people.  It is meant to be wrapped in lettuce but the dish should come with more lettuce given the size of the dish.
It&#39;s tasty.  I took half home and bought more lettuce to wrap it in.

Matcha tea cocktail- looks beautiful but I did trebly like it."

The decor and ambience is beautiful and I would expect nothing less of a trendy park slope restaurant. Regardless, the best part was the outdoor seating area, complete with refurbished wooden tables, plants, mason jars galore, and an air of mystery that comes with eating outside at night. 

On top of everything, the food was delicious. I ordered 4 appetizers and 2 desserts to share and my personal favorites were the crispy chicken wings (CANNOT EXPRESS HOW AMAZING THESE WERE WITHOUT CAPITALIZATION), crispy imperial rolls (Vietnamese spring rolls), and a molten chocolate cake (it has cheese inside, I think it&#39;s a kind of blue cheese. Don&#39;t let it turn you off, it&#39;s incredible). If you&#39;ve never eaten Vietnamese food, and don&#39;t know how to navigate it, don&#39;t worry because the staff will explain the meal to you and how you can enjoy it to its fullest potential.

The owner and chef of this incredible restaurant openly speaks about her work and loves to discuss her latest experiences in food, conferences, learning from other chefs and fun, foodie interests. 

I ordered the fresh summer rolls and they were fresh with the veggies, noodles and wraps. The Vietnamese coffee was very sweet, as expected with the condensed milk-- I would use a larger cup and add more coffee to lessen the sweetness, but I kind of expect Vietnamese coffee to be overly sweet. The folks I was with also loved their dishes. 

More than anything, it was a great vibe in the restaurant. All the servers and the chef were super friendly and welcoming-- great conversations occurred with our servers and I would definitely come back because one of my main concerns as a patron is service. 

In addition, the food presentation was on point, colorful and super fun to look at.

The highlights were:

matcha tea service - a frothy cocktail with a hefty amount of matcha and egg whites! Tangy and smooth and not too sweet. 

Sriracha butter chicken wings - need I say more? The chicken wings were crispy and seasoned, reminded me of Taiwanese chicken bites. That Sriracha butter... I would dip anything in that deliciousness!! 

Beef on beef - super fun! They give you beef skewers, lettuce, rice paper and pickled turnips and carrots. You dip the rice paper in the warm water, and you make the roll to your liking. Need more beef though! Maybe some crushed peanuts? 

Whole frilled branzino - so fresh, topped with fish sauce and crispy garlic. Ask them to filet it for you! 

The shaken beef was also delicious, nicely seasoned with Asian spices and perfectly cooked piece of meat.

I would skip the Claypot shrimp, and the crepes. The shrimp was uninspired, shrimp with some onions in a brown sauce. The crepes were overcooked and also uninspired."

Just let those two descriptors settle in your brain for a second.  Let them mingle a bit.  Say hello.  Maybe sit down for a coffee or something.  Because these two words are going to be best friends.

I&#39;m a bit bias in that Vietnamese food is like my kryptonite, in that the mere glimpse of a bahn mi makes me weak at the knees.  Though, from what I could tell, Bricolage tries to branch out from the usual, offering some interesting dishes I hadn&#39;t seen before (but no pho, un...phortunately).  

We tried summer rolls, because we&#39;re still hesitant white people, which were absolutely superb, fresh-tasting clumps of happiness.  And the Banh Canh noodles, which I think I might have called bankai noodles (sorry, Bricolage).  It was some kind of intoxicating mixture of peanut, bean sprouts and tofu that just disappeared down my face.

What really added flair to the place was a really interesting cocktail called the Red Boat which had gin, chili and, get this, fish sauce.  This is the kind of stuff that differentiates a cocktail bar that serves food from country X from a country X cocktail bar.  Trying interesting things with some of the country X&#39;s ingredients.  The drink was really excellent, spicy and with an interesting salty tang that just mixed really well.

Vietnamese gastropub.  Get on that."

We progressed on to our two appetizers that we shared which were vegetarian la lot leaf wraps and Niman pork ribs each had a distinct unique twist that were delightful. It complimented each other quite well.

The crispy roll appetizer was good. The lettuce wrap helped balance the salty, fried heaviness.
My entree was the unshaking beef, and it was just okay. It could&#39;ve used a tad more salt and was slightly overcooked. I was underwhelmed. The portions are also on the small side for the prices. Given the lackluster entree, I decided to skip dessert.

Overall, the experience at Bricolage was disappointing, or maybe my expectations were too high. Bummer."

Came here with 8pm reservations and arrived 5-10 mins late and they seated us immediately. Partly because they have a sufficient amount of tables empty anyway. The layout of the restaurant is very inviting and can even be seen as romantic. We weren&#39;t lucky enough to sit outside in the back (which is very nice by the way) but we sat a few tables from their open kitchen which was equally nice. We started off with two drinks, my friend ordered the thai gimlit (I didn&#39;t get a chance to taste it but he seemed fond of it and the presentation of the drink was a thumbs up). We started with 3 dishes: shrimp clay pot, chicken wings and imperial rolls. Let me declare that I am 50% Viet, so coming to this place I knew I would be critical. First, the rolls were very well made. The wrap and filling they used was very well fried and crispy. They are very expensive (2 rolls for $11) but if you don&#39;t think about the price, the rolls are tasty. Next, the chicken wings: they looked very boring because they were not dressed (the sauce comes on the side) but don&#39;t be fooled by the cover of a book. Those wings were BANGING. They were so good!!! I&#39;m actually glad the sauce was on the side because you can control how much sauce you want. They were so nicely made. The coating on the chicken was so flavorful! If I could only order one app from their menu, it would definitely be the chicken wings. The last app we shared was the clay pot (originally an entree). The flavor in the pot was pretty good. Not too salty, spicy and saucy. There were probably about 8-9 pcs of shrimp ($26) and it also came with a side of white rice. So far so good right? We knew those three dishes were not going to be enough and I HAD to try their crepe. Not many Viet places around me even offer the crepe so the second I saw it I knew I had to have it! Their crepe normally comes with shrimp and pork but my friend does not eat pork so we had to sub it with more veggies and just shrimp. My concern with the crepes are never the filling but actually the consistency of the crepe itself. Drum roll please:  Bricolage nailed the crepe! The crepe was so crispy and even with the crispiness while cutting into the crepe it didn&#39;t break apart! Winner winner! It was perfect. Now we&#39;re talking full bellies. Finally, we ordered their pudding dessert. It arrived in a small mason jar. It was prepared in layers: bottom layer was grass jelly, middle was coconut tapioca and then topped with fresh mango bits. Good idea and not overwhelmingly sweet. 

Here is why I deducted 1 star: we received our bill, paid in cash completely and was due back change ($4 - not much but still!) and the waiter never came back and never asked if we wanted change. He assumed it was all his. I don&#39;t mind but please don&#39;t assume. I definitely calculated for them to receive a 20% tip so there&#39;s no reason for the confusion. 

Anyway, overall a very solid (somewhat overpriced) viet restaurant that executes in areas necessary."

Cocktails are $14 and good but the bartender and servers are very lax and amateurish for the serious prices.  The reason I go to a bar and have a bartender make me a drink is because I do not want to make one.  I want to be in a lovely environment and I want to be pampered.  So, I expect service not excuses from the service staff.
We waited a very long time for our drinks because the bartender was chatting with staff and regulars.  While he apologized for the wait, it set a bad tone for the evening.

In addition to the service,  the food was disappointing as well.  The Vietnamese crepe, while executed well had barely any shrimp or pork inside.  It was filled with bean sprouts.  This is one of my favorite dishes but please don&#39;t be cheap with shrimp !  It costs $18 after all.  

The real kicker was the unshaken beef.  It came out medium well.  When the server took our order, he did not ask how we want the beef.  So, I assumed med rare.  But no, medium well is how it was served.  A beautiful rib eye ruined.  We still ate it and enjoyed the flavors but it was not what I had wanted.

My friend and I ordered:

1) shrimp and pork belly summer rolls: the dipping sauce is good, I didn&#39;t really like the flavor of the pork belly in the rolls. The skin of the summer roll was very chewy which j liked. 

2) lemongrass pork chop: they cook the porkchop to be slightly rare. However it is seasoned very well and pairs nicely with the rice. The arugula salad was slightly too bitter for my taste. 

3) Unshaking beef: this didn&#39;t really have any Vietnamese flavors in my opinion but it was nevertheless marinated very well and cooked to a medium rare. The watercress salad was the best part about this dish. It had a sort of sweet and fruity dressing that just went really well with the vegetables. I&#39;m still craving and thinking about it. 

The cocktails here are good although the one I ordered was overpowered by the flavor of the IPA. I was expecting more citrusy flavors. My friend had this grapefruit cocktail that contained sparkling wine. She seems to enjoy it.

I would use every word in the dictionary that defines delicious, tasty, scrumptious, etc. If that happened, this review would last two pages, but I&#39;ll try to keep it simple and short. First and foremost, the staff is very friendly and will take you through the menu on how some dishes are prepared. Its a great way to get the customers/diners engaged especially for those of you that are really into food. Second, the ingredients are extremely fresh and organic, which I will pay top dollar for. Nothing beats fresh ingredients because that will make every dish that much more flavorful. Everything here is homemade ... even the decor !!

Duck Prosciutto Salad: Thinly sliced duck on top of arugula with crispy taro sticks. The vinaigrette pairs nicely with the arugula, which has a peppery and somewhat bitter bite. Rather than putting croutons on top of the salad, the chefs go outside the box and add crispy taro sticks.

Fresh Summer Rolls: I&#39;ve eaten a lot of spring rolls from many different Vietnamese restaurants, but there is no comparison when it comes to Bricolage. The way the chefs prepare the pork is what separates them from all the other places. The marinade on that pork is gosh darn good and I wish I asked the chefs how its prepared. Another kicker for the dish is the peanut dipping sauce. Unlike all the peanut sauces I&#39;ve dipped my spring roll in, this one had a spicy taste to it. I think I dipped my spring roll so many times, I actually ran out of peanut sauce... 

Beef on Beef: I don&#39;t even have words to describe how good this dish is. I love beef and decided to give this dish a try. The waiter was telling us that the beef is sliced thinly, carpaccio style. What comes next out of the waiter&#39;s mouth blows my mind. He told us that the chefs take beef tendon and boil it. The beef tendon is then chilled, sliced thinly, and finally put into the salamander to puff up. I was really intrigued what that would taste like and when I took a bite, it reminded me of biting into a chicharron. If you take the beef and wrap everything around the puffed beef tendon, all the flavors of the dish completely explodes in your mouth. Writing this review makes me wanna go back and order a dish for myself. 

Unshaking Beef: You can&#39;t leave this restaurant without ordering this as well. I believe the beef is organic. Requested my steak to be cooked mid-rare and it comes out sliced into pieces, which makes sharing convenient. When I took my first bite into that beef, I think i fainted and had to be resuscitated (figuratively speaking). The beef was so tender and almost melted in my mouth. It comes with lime-pepper sauce and when I poured some of that on top of the steak, my taste buds were taken to another level of flavortown. 

Desserts: Just ordering everything because it is that good. Flavors are out of this world and it hurts me that I live all the way in California and not New York. I rather finish this review of the desserts if I could just sit at the restaurant with the desserts besides me. My mouth is watering and it won&#39;t stop salivating."

We had been wanting to come here ever since we heard it was coming to the neighborhood. You know how sometimes you get so excited to go somewhere and you build it up a lot in your head and then it lets you down? This was not the case with Bricolage. 

The decor inside is industrial steam punk with little rustic touches. Every chair in the whole restaurant is different, which I thought was a fun rustic touch. The menu is definitely not exhaustive but has a pretty good variety of items. As a vegetarian, i&#39;m usually stuck with one choice, but this menu had a few options for me. 

I ordered the vegetarian summer rolls which were delicious and refreshing. Lots of fresh ingredients were used and the peanut dipping sauce was a perfect compliment and not too overpowering. I also ordered the Bahn Cahn Noodles which were freaking amazing. This was filled with ingredients in your typical noodle bowl but was covered in an incredible sauce that complimented the noddles and vegetables perfectly. I couldn&#39;t get enough of it. It was simply amazing. My husband got the steak and ate every last thing on his plate. He loved it. My mom got one of the Vietnamese crepes and really enjoyed hers as well. My father actually wasn&#39;t feeling well that night and ended up not being able to eat his vegetarian crepe he ordered. Which was great for my husband and me because we gained his leftovers! It was quite good the next day! 

When my Dad asked to have his order wrapped up (untouched), he explained he was suffering from severe heart burn and couldn&#39;t eat. The server asked if he wanted milk and brought him some! So nice! The prices are pretty reasonable as well. I loved this place and can&#39;t wait to come back."

Yes, you can also get a pork belly hash (garlic/soy braised, fried egg, arugula, lime), croissant French toast (coffee whip, condensed milk creme angelaise, bluebs), or a side of yogurt/granola - and while those who went with the more traditional brunch items were not disappointed, if you&#39;re here, you might as well go out Saigon-style.

Admittedly, the summer rolls (cuc, bean sprouts, herbs, vermicelli) were nothing extraordinary, but the green pap salad (cuc, celery, rau ram, shallots, peanuts) was crisp and tangy in all the right ways - and my goodness, my breakie crepe with king oyster/maitake shrooms, bean sprouts, fried eggs - ummmm, yes - I&#39;ll take a billion, pls - rich without being heavy, satiating in the best of ways. Many neighboring tables were hitting the fried chicken and waffles (5 spice, fennel slaw, sriracha butter, maple) and the pho ga (chicken, rice noodle, bean sprouts, shallots, herbs) and exactly zero faces looked sad abt it. 

At noonish on a Saturday, wasn&#39;t slammed, though it was madly cold out, hard to tell if thin crowd was indicative of lack of popularity or ppl&#39;s full-on terror at the prospect of facing nearly sub-zero temps -  vibe is reclaimed wood, old school mismatched lighting, succulents - part Secret Garden, part Park Slope hip-family chic - though be warned, if your toddler is feeling fussy or you&#39;re a hangry adult, service isn&#39;t lightening quick. Be prepared to linger. 

Starters $8-12, soups $12ish, entrees $13-18, cocktails $9-11. Vietnamese coffee and tea were both randomly $7 per pot, which seemed excessive, though they were tasty.

We&#39;ve been going here since they opened and the food is amazing because it&#39;s from a place that reminds me things you&#39;d eat at home but with a dash of fun. There is a sense of tradition mixed with the right amount of modern in all of to their meals. The kitchen is flexible and the wait staff is very well versed in the menu and pairings. 

You have your choice of meat or non-meat options, along with fish and soups. The drink menu is fun and creative plus, I challenge you to make one of Tristan&#39;s drinks at home. If you can not make dinner stop by for brunch or lunch for new items that don&#39;t appear on the dinner menu. 

My favorites are the Green Papaya Salad, Vegetarian Summer Rolls, Whole Fish, and the Vietnamese Crepe which are just splendid. If you have allergies they will guide you through alternatives, and do their best to adjust. I&#39;ve gotten the Crepe without pork and just shrimp since I don&#39;t eat meat. Every time we&#39;ve come, they have a sample of something new to try. Overall we just feel at home and you&#39;re being taken care of.

In a practically empty restaurant the hostess insisted to seat us at the worst table. Even after I pointed out we are here to celebrate a birthday. We were right by the door to the garden where staff was passing through every 2 minutes and cold air was blowing at me. We had a very nice waiter so I tried again with him and finally we were able to move to a different table. They gave us a free chocolate ganache cake with a candle at the end.

I ordered the shrimp claypot, unshaking beef for dad and the artic char for mom. Unshaking beef was great. The shrimp claypot and artic char on the other hand were really salty.

I remember the first time I walked by this place after it had just opened... I looked at the menu and thought &#34;Wow, this is ACTUAL Vietnamese&#34;.  So keep in mind, this is not a &#34;banh mi / grilled chicken on vermicelli noodle&#34; joint.  This is the real deal.  You&#39;ll find interesting and delicate dishes that are true to form representations of central and northern Vietnam.  They&#39;ll only difference is that in Vietnam you&#39;ll pay $5 for it versus the $120 you&#39;ll easily spend here... such is the price of exportation.

The interior is beautiful... brick walls, dim lighting.  The framed rusted metal on the walls are apparently things they pulled from the Gowanus (and hopefully disinfected).  They are all about local, from the decor to the ingredients.  It&#39;s intimate enough for a date night, yet spacious enough for a group outing.

Everything here is served family style, so it&#39;s best to make a reservation, go with a group of friends and try many things.  Clay pot chicken, get it... branzino, ditto, cha ca la vong, yes! The rolls, the papaya salad, the wings, the banh xeo... oh the banh xeo.  You honestly can&#39;t go wrong.

And, in the end, as you roll your stuffed self out of your seat and out the door, I&#39;m willing to wager good money that it&#39;ll still be the healthiest meal you&#39;ve eaten all week."

That being said, while late night dining may not be for everybody, they certainly provide a nice experience for those who have no qualms about going to bed on a massively full stomach. 

The space is very nice and the service is even better. We started off with cocktails, I had a basil gimlet which was very enjoyable. We ordered the papaya salad, spring rolls, Unshaking Beef, and Banh Canh noodles. 

Of the two starters, the spring rolls were definitely the best. Great ingredients in the filling and fried perfectly crispy. The papaya salad was confusing to me. I honestly couldn&#39;t find the papaya or even taste it. Lots of cucumber, some nice flavors with the anchovy and veggies, but I honestly wouldn&#39;t have known it was papaya salad if I hadn&#39;t ordered it. 

For entrees, the Unshaking Beef was definitely superior to the noodles. The strips of beef ranged from being rare (absolutely delicious) to medium well (mostly tasty). There was also a side of lemon sauce, which was not only unnecessary, but I actually disliked. The vegetables (ramps and onions) were a nice accompaniment to the meat. The Banh Canh noodles sounded delicious on the menu, but weren&#39;t executed so well. The coconut milk was plentiful in the dish, and much too rich and heavy. The flavor was nice, but just too overpowering. 

Even with its misses, it&#39;s a nice place worth checking out, if you don&#39;t mind finishing your dinner shortly before midnight."

I only wished that I had visited before it got cold so that I could take advantage of the outdoor space (which looks pretty dope).

I came to Bricolage with my family and boyfriend the Friday after thanksgiving. My parents love trying new cuisines but they also are tough to please (sometimes).  

Food:
- Vegetarian Summer Rolls - the rolls were simple but so fresh and complemented perfectly with the spicy peanut sauce. It does have a kick but not enough to render your mouth useless. 
- Pork Ribs: according to my parents, the ribs basically melted in their mouths and had neat carmelized char lines are around 
- Unshaking Beef - I didn&#39;t try the beef but the watercress salad was dressed really nicely. My dad mentioned that the beef is very fatty (which is fantastic for some but not all). He just happens to be a bit of a fitness nut so it didn&#39;t strike quite the right chord with him.
- Bahn Cahn Noodle - I&#39;ve never had coconut milk sauce on noodles. I love that they were homemade and the flavors were really subtle which was great because I mixed them in with the watercress salad from my parent&#39;s shaking beef dish.

It does tend to get packed later in the night, though we had not too much trouble snagging a table around 7:30pm. Also Andre was the man! Thanks for great service all around :)"

If you look at my reviews on Yelp, the fanciest I get is a nice cocktail every once in awhile. But sometimes you just need to treat yourself to something fancy*, right?

Enter Bricolage, heaven in a small-ish Vietnamese restaurant. They have a small but well curated beer and wine list, and their servers are very knowledgeable about the full list and what goes well with each dish. We started with some summer rolls and a delicious peanut sauce (I&#39;d take a bath in peanut sauce if that was both sanitary and a proven way to clean oneself). As a vegetarian, there was only one option on the entree menu that I could order, but thankfully it was amazing: the house made banh canh noodle is savory, fresh and really filling. The fella said that his pork belly clay pot was also wonderful. This was one of those times I was really jealous I couldn&#39;t lean over and grab some of his dinner like he can with my meal.

Go, eat, enjoy. 

*YMMV on how fancy this is. If your level of fancy is ABC Kitchen, then Bricolage is probably takeout food for you. That&#39;s okay: it&#39;s really good takeout food, if that&#39;s the case."

The food, combined with the ambiance occasionally brings me back. The most consistently negative element of the place is the service! Everything is slow - getting someone to pay attention to putting in an order for food or drinks, getting the food, and then trying to leave. Also, consistent errors (make sure you repeat 2-3x!).

I liked that it was a smaller restaurant and had a more intimate and friendly feel to it than other places. The decor was fun, and it great how they left the kitchen semi open so we can see the chefs working. 

Even though we didn&#39;t get to the restaurant until after 10 pm and less an hour before closing (I hate doing that!), the hostess and our waiter were both extremely gracious and didn&#39;t seem rushed or annoyed at all. We ordered the following:

-Vietnamese crepe with shrimp and pork
-lemongrass grilled pork chop
-unshaking beef

I know the unshaking beef is supposed to be the star of the restaurant, but I really loved the crepe and my pork chop! The crepe was stuffed with meat and had a ton of flavor. It was also a good sized portion. My pork chop was perfectly grilled and had the most wonderful, subtle flavor. It came with a delicious salad as well. The portion sizes were perfect and every bite was absolutely wonderful. My only drawback is that it is pretty pricey.

I went for a late dinner and wasn&#39;t too hungry so I ordered the Vietnamese omelette (appetizer but could easily be a full meal) and my dad ordered the pork. We both ate in silence appreciating the food.

My dad has a gluten allergy so before we even ordered our waiter asked if anyone had allergies, which was nice because it&#39;s always uncomfortable bringing up the &#34;gluten&#34; thing because it now has that stereotype...I digress. Yet it seems it&#39;s because he brought a free bite of tofu caprese before we had our meal. 

The place itself is great for dinner or having a date (option to sit at the bar, actually sit down for a meal or grab food at the bar.) The front of the restaurant looks like it&#39;s all bar but it leads to a dining room and adorable industrial but earthy garden with small tables and 1 communal picnic table. The vibe is A+.

This casual Vietnamese Gastropub has great food &amp; amazing cocktails. The chefs Lien &amp; Edward have brought amazing Vietnamese with a touch of Chinese flavors all the way from San Francisco to Brooklyn. 

Bricolage&#39;s cocktail menu caught my eye based on the Vietnamese inspired ingredients they use. Here are the two cocktails I have explored &amp; recommend:

The Thai Basil Gimlet, a refreshing &amp; delicious drink which consists of gin, pineapple gum, lime, &amp; thai basil. The pineapple gum added a slightly creamy sweetness to the drink which balanced out the tart lime flavor &amp; the juniper berry essence of the gin. 

Then there is the Japanese Cocktail, a bourbon based drink which includes calvados, orgeat, &amp; bitters. The calvados added a soft fruity taste, the orgeat provided a little sweetness, &amp; the bitters created a nice balance between all ingredients. 

After having a few cocktails, it was time to try some appetizers. The Vietnamese Crepe, filled with fresh Georgia white shrimp, pork, onions, &amp; bean sprouts &amp; the Crispy Imperial Rolls, stuffed with pork, shrimp, glass noodle, &amp; wood ear mushrooms were both crispy &amp; freaking delicious. Wrap them up in the greens &amp; dip it into the fish sauce. 

And the winner of the evening was the Lemongrass Grilled Pork Chop, which was cooked perfectly as you will see by the beautiful grill char lines on both sides of the meat. This thick &amp; juicy Niman Ranch pork was served with an apple, fennel, &amp; arugula salad.

Drinks were good but it took so long to get! We placed an order right after we sat down (outside, nonetheless) and it took almost 30min to arrive. We also ordered a bottle of wine that they left off the final receipt, and even after we paid came back and asked us to pay for the wine.

We booked a reservation but at 6:30pm, but would have been just fine without one on a Wednesday. They did ask if it was a special occasion and it was my wife and I&#39;s anniversary which led to a very nice touch of a comp&#39;ed glass of champagne. We sat outside and their back garden is really nice.

We started with the Sriracha Butter Wings and the Ribs. The Wings were tasty, nice and crispy with the sauce on the side to determine how much you wanted. The ribs were good, but weren&#39;t fall off the bone and were actually a little on the chewy side.

It was our mains where we were left wanting. I ordered the Unshaking Beef after hearing it&#39;s praises. Sadly it was a bit lacking in seasoning, a bit overcooked and just kind of meh. My wife ordered the Cha Ca La Vong, (Atlantic cod, dill, scallion, rice noodle, watercress, peanuts, anchovy pineapple sauce). She didn&#39;t really get any bite from the anchovy pineapple sauce, just sweetness and said her dish was just a little bland.

Our drinks were both ok, nothing special (especially comparing them to what we had at Blueprint before dinner).

The homemade noodles were super tasty.

It&#39;s a lovely space, and we really appreciated the ease of ordering gluten-free and the free tapioca pudding the server sent out when he learned it was out anniversary. I&#39;m definitely coming back, and can&#39;t wait to try the lunch too.

I&#39;d recommend this to a party of any number, but I bet it&#39;s awesome with 4 or more, you could order a bunch of stuff and share everything."

In exchange for this fanciness, your portion will be smaller and more expensive.  This won&#39;t bother you, because you&#39;re in a fancy place.  My advice is don&#39;t order an entree that reminds you of the non-fancy version because the meal you get might leave you wistful for the down and dirty scrumptiousness of the dish it was based on.   That made sense, right?"

I loved the decor and how every light fixture was different and unique. The place was inviting and cozy. The open kitchen gave us a sneak peak of operations and of the food that was coming out. 

We had the beet salad and vegetarian summer rolls to start. The beet salad was packed with flavor and oh-so delicious. The kind of delicious that made you close your eyes on the first bite. The summer rolls were fresh and the spicy peanut sauce was well-balanced. Next, we had the vegetarian banh xeo (crepe) which was a little tricky to eat but worth the work. My dad used to make these for us growing up so I&#39;m accustomed to a more traditional Vietnamese banh xeo with pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts where the batter isn&#39;t as crispy. Bricolage&#39;s vegetarian version is different in a good way and is still reminiscent of it&#39;s more traditional counterpart. 

After the crepe, we had the clay pot shrimp...OMG! It reminded me so much of my dad&#39;s clay pot fish. The carmelized brown sauce was the perfect consistency, not too thick and not too thin or loose. The flavor was an incredible dance party on my tongue. It was definitely my favorite of all the dishes so far. 

Next up was the Branzino, whole fish from head to tail. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The white flesh fell off the bone and the sauce was a perfect pairing - not too oily and just the right consistency. 

For dessert, we had the bleu cheese chocolate cake topped with toasted sliced almonds and a smear of what I believe was quints preserve and the 5-spice tapioca rice pudding topped with small dices of fresh mango. The cake was very moist and tasty. The bleu cheese worked well to offset the sweetness of the chocolate. The tapioca rice pudding was not too sweet and surprisingly refreshing on the palate - I was a big fan of this dessert since I don&#39;t prefer overly sweet or sugary treats. 

I&#39;m looking forward to coming back and trying the banh canh. This dish was one of my favorites growing up. My mom makes a mean banh canh and I&#39;m excited to try Bricolage&#39;s version on our next visit. 

Keep up the great work, Bricolage!"

It was a cold Friday night and it nice and cozy. It had the typical &#34;Brooklyn&#34; feel which I liked. There was the open kitchen but I sat with my back to it. The service was really good and timely. Our waiter gave a full breakdown of every dish we received, which was a nice touch. Seemed like he knew all the dishes by heart whenever we asked about anything. Don&#39;t always see that.

Food:
Ok, so to what everyone *mostly* cares about. Everything we had was tasty. No complaints. (Disclaimer: I&#39;m far away from an taste expert ;) )

We shared Beet salad to start. It was fresh and crunchy. There were pieces of grapefruit in it that I really liked. A bit pricey though... for a salad.

For our main course I had the popular unshaking beef.(medium rare) It was not over hyped. It was on the fatty side, which I like. It was tender and full of flavor. Watercress was good sidekick to it.
My friend had the lemongrass pork chop. It cam sliced up and was grilled perfectly. I snuck a couple bites of it and it  was delicious. She enjoyed it as well. 
Could not complain about the portion size of either.

Desert:
We felt like sharing a desert so we indulged in a chocolate cake, with a touch of cream. I keep my cake eating to minimum but this made me want to have more. It was a perfect mix of richness and sweet flavor.

Drinks:
I had a the Thai Basil Gimlet cocktail. No complaints on that either. I love Gin and Pineapple and this did not disappoint. It was a perfect blend, that was a nice start to the night. 
Before we left we got some white tea to warm us up before we left. Was served in a charming Kettle and cup. Nice touch. 

Overall I enjoyed myself here. Only thing I&#39;d say it&#39;s on the pricey side but given the neighborhood, that&#39;s to be expected.  Flavor is great and service is excellent. Just be prepared to spend a bit more than you&#39;d expect at a Vietnamese spot."

(Bricolage is fancy enough that they don&#39;t list prices on the website, a pet peeve.)

The vegetarian version of those eggs are basically tubes of salad, pleasant enough but barely more than a bite or two each. The banh xeo, visible on several tables, is rather traditional. I&#39;d expect more innovation for what they want. The more unusual the dish, the better it generally tastes. The sriracha wings come in a surprisingly large portion, with nearly eight wings on the platter. The frying is plain but the dipping sauce should be should in a takeaway container. (Nominally this is sriracha based, but there&#39;s more going on here.)

Best of all is an eggplant appetizer that is rich and smooth. It&#39;s too small, and I wonder if we should just ahead and order it again. Perhaps if I&#39;d been more prepared for the splurge, I would have more enjoyed my experience here, but as it is it seemed hard to justify the premium price point."

The food here is some of the best I&#39;ve had in the neighborhood. I was a little worried being a vegetarian that their meatcentric menu would be limiting but it was not.

Vietnamese Gin &amp; Tonic- Refreshing and flavorful. I loved it! 
Fresh Summer Rolls- I love summer rolls. These were good, my only complaint is the pork belly component was barely present.
Papaya Salad- Fresh and delicious! Great dressing. 
Glass Noodles with Crab- This was very salty. I was happy with the quality of crab meat, but I think it could have used an extra ingredient beside the crab, noodles, and oyster sauce.
Flan Br√ªl√©e- We were so excited to see this on the dessert menu. Two of my favorites, combined!  The problem was, the top was completely burned. We had to remove that top layer because it was not edible, literally black.
The service was good. For my second drink, I had a Croatian rose that they suggested, which was such a perfect summer wine. I&#39;m seeking out where to buy a bottle. I would like to come back here to try some other menu items. Some of the food we saw around us looked really good, especially the crepe. 
There was an older couple sitting at the table next to us, they didn&#39;t seem to know the staff, but we noticed that they were given three dishes &#34;on the house.&#34; We didn&#39;t get anything on the house. Maybe they were famous, or something."

I ordered the thai basil gimlet (even though the super friendly waitress recommended wine) which was a refreshing start. It was recommended that for 2 people we should order 3 appetizers and 1 entree to share, so we got papaya salad, bahn xeo, chicken wings with sriracha butter and unshaking beef. It was a lot for 2 people so if you aren&#39;t that hungry 2 appetizers and 1 entree would do. I liked the anchovy sauce in the papaya salad, the texture of the crepe, and the watercress in the beef but couldn&#39;t find any other redeeming qualities among the dishes. The fillings of the bahn xeo consisted disproportionately of a large amount of bean sprout and too little of everything else. The dipping sauce was flavorful and the chef should have incorporated that into the crepe itself. Same goes with the chicken wings. The breading was pretty much unseasoned and all flavors were in the sriracha butter, which tasted more like buffalo sauce than sriracha. The beef was very chewy and plain. 

Service is very good and I am sure they will expand their menu soon so I might visit again but certainly not in the near future."

I didn&#39;t want to believe the review here that said to save your $$ and spend it at one of the usual good, cheap Vietnamese restaurants.  That Yelper was right on.

Very nice back patio and service was fine, place was empty 5:30 on an August Saturday.  That&#39;s where the good ends.   Maybe the real chef went on vacation?
Papaya salad looked incredible but was the worst I&#39;ve ever had.  ZERO flavor.  I have no idea how this could have turned out so tasteless.  It was like making yourself eat raw, tasteless white radishes. 
$20 chicken claypot- I&#39;ve had much better for half the price.  Chicken quality needed to be better- more tender.  Sauce had next to no flavor.    Only got some flavor with the one sprig of cilantro.   
You get rice if you ask for it and it is a half filled bowl and blah. 
Grilled lemongrass pork chops- looked incredible.  Large portion but served with way too much arugula.   Pork was DRY, chewy and FLAVORLESS.
Sorry for the caps but at $27.00 for this dish, it really is wrong that you are charged triple the price of so many other Viet. places where you could have delicious, tender pork with real lemongrass flavor.
Chocolate lava cake with blue cheese--- interesting/different - was decent.  Have had much better lava cakes.  I could melt a little blue cheese in the center of a Trader Joe lava cake and it would taste the same. 

100 bucks later (with tip and one beer)-  I completely give up on over-hyped Park Slope area restaurants"

Cool interior, down to the bathroom. Could definitely take a date here. 

Overall, we loved it! But both of my dining companions complained that it was a little loud. Also the music selection seemed incongruous with the setting. And one last little complaint - while our original waiter, a guy, was awesome, there was one female server who kept on coming over and kind of looming over us in a strange way. She was just kind of imposing somehow. I think she meant well, but it was a little weird. But service was very attentive!

All of their food is tasty and feels like home cooked food, not to mention it&#39;s healthy (for the most part anyway- not sure about the fries on your shawarma is all that healthy but its one of hubby&#39;s favs).  The owner and staff are friendly and make you feel like your family as they always great us by name when we walk in.  They quit doing delivery, which I&#39;m sad about, but their food is so good my husband has rode his bike to pick up food in the dead of winter.

Give them a try, you won&#39;t be disappointed."

We were very pleased with everything - food was not only on point and delicious, but also beautifully presented.  

We each had a sha-lafel platter (chicken &amp; falafel served over yellow rice with salad).  I&#39;ve definitely had better falafel and shawarma, but overall the platter was good.  We also shared an order of their hummus and an order of their tabbouleh (which was some of the best tabbouleh we&#39;ve ever had).  I ended the meal with a cup of their Turkish coffee which was made just right!

Would definitely come back when in the area."

It&#39;s set up is like a buffet - order, they make it from the salad bar, no table service and you pick up your food. 

The hummus is incredible. Tahini good too. 

The falafel is semi-dry.

Kofta lacked flavor.  So did the rice. 

We got one piece of pita bread with our meal.  Sorry but I&#39;m Arab and we scoop rice with bread and dip it low n hummus.  Seriously you give one pita? lol Their not the only ones stingy with pita, although the one piece tasted good.  

Not rememberable."

Being a ghost is one thing, but that would just be creepy. This is &#34;Ghoul-etiquette.&#34; But this restaurant is not that. This restaurant is &#34;Goulette.&#34; And it&#39;s Tunisian Shawarma and Falafel so good, you&#39;ll think you&#39;ve seen a ghost. At least I hope you&#39;ll love it as much as I do, otherwise I&#39;ll falafel about it.

WHAT TO GET: Shalafel.
WHY: It&#39;s amazing shawarma with delicious falafel stuffed in a pita with all sorts of other delights.
WHAT ELSE: If you call me Collect, I&#39;ll tell you about Goulette.

One of the best things to eat in all of Brooklyn. And unlike most places in these newly hipsterized parts, it won&#39;t leave you Brokelyn. Despite having a near five-star rating, this place is underrated at 4.5 stars because anyone who gave it less than 5 is missing how much better their pitas are than basically every other falafel and shawarma place in NYC.

Because they&#39;re Tunisian, it&#39;s a little different to what you&#39;re used to, but in a good way. The service is wonderful too. One of the many times I was here, I listened to the young server talk about how he was on course to be a professional soccer player in Tunisia, before a horrible injury. Now, instead, he works in Brooklyn. Well, there are much, much worse places to be.

Their date drink is also delicious, but only if you like dates. And I don&#39;t mean dates as in, what Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler had 50 of in that movie. I mean, what killed the monkey (but critically not Indy) in Raiders Of The Lost Shalafel. Speaking of Shalafel, if you do it the other way round, does it become Falama? Fawarma? Fatwa? I&#39;m not sure. Hold on, let me ask Salman Rushdie he might know."

2. The hummus and pita bread are so good that I have  eaten this many times as a snack. I had some of  warm pita bread from La Goulette today and it went well with my Chicken Shawarma over rice lunch dish...

3. The Falafels.....oh my goodness! Some of the tastiest Falafels that I have ever had in my life....

I ordered the falafel plate and it came with rice and salad all for $12. It was so beautiful and REALLY FILLING. I could only eat half of it! If you&#39;re not that hungry, I think you can share this with someone and order a side of fries or something else. 

My friend ordered the cauliflower and artichoke plate and it looked awesome. Also really large portion. 

We shared mint tea, which was only $4. It came in a pot with two glasses to share and was enough for two servings each.

This is a Tunisian Mediterranean place, and it serves up some really good Middle Eastern food. So yes, think of falafels, hummus, tabbouleh, shwarma, baba ganoush, baklava, etc. 

After a vigorous hot yoga class at the newly opened Modo Yoga in Billyburg, we were all pretty hungry and a friend suggested this place. What a great suggestion!

The interior is casual, there is no table service here, you order your food, pick it up and then choose a place to sit and enjoy! I really loved all the pics of Tunisia on the wall and enjoyed the Arabic music playing overhead. It brings me back to a time and place that I am so fond of...

I ordered the veggie mix ($12) which comes with falafel, tabbouleh, hummus, baba ganoush and a side of pita. Falafels were big in size, crisp and so delicious. Hummus was solid. Tabbouleh was very fresh and excellent. My friend&#39;s ordered a falafel sandwich, grilled chicken platter and the kale avocado salad. Everything here was fresh, tasty and pretty healthy. Portions are also pretty big, so good enough to share or to have the next day also as a second meal. We all also shared some baklava, which is heavenly. I would be interested to try to the kunafa on my next visit. 

Staff here were very helpful and attentive. The woman at the register tried to offer me cutlery, a lid for my food to take home and a plastic bag. There is a water jug at the front. Bathroom and dining area very clean. 

Great place for casual dining that served up great Middle Eastern food. I&#39;ll be sure to come back next time I am in the hood!"

We ordered the Mixed grilled plate served over hummus, and a side of babaganoush. They were both served with baskets of warm pita bread.
Everything was really flavorful. My only complaint would be that I wish there was more meat, considering the plate was $16. I feel like I ate more hummus than anything. (Maybe I felt like that because my sister was greedy with the meat...)

This place is great for casual lunch/dinner. I love interactive food so it would be a great place for a first date imo. I didn&#39;t get the baklava there but definitely want to try it next time."

I&#39;m always looking for places that offer healthy options that I can pickup on the way home. 

 I wanted a healthy salad but I have a slight guilty pleasure for falafels so I decided to go with the kale and avocado salad + a side of falafels w/tahini.

I had to wait a rather long time for what I thought was a basic to-go order, but I wasn&#39;t in any rush and the falafels were definitely worth it. I was, however, a little disappointed with the kale salad. There was no warning on the menu that it was going to be drenched in dressing or else I would have asked for it on the side. I should have asked but nonetheless a to-go salad should always have dressing on the side in my opinion to keep the salad fresh and crisp, instead of wet and and soggy.

I will definitely be returning for the falafels, but I did learn my lesson - always ask for dressing on the side and maybe stick with the typical Mediterranean salads."

the cauliflower and artichoke is great, flavorful yet lightened up with the yogurt.
the only thing was the baklava was way too sweet and salty, like way...too.
after all a great experience and would go again sometime."

The staff is amazing, the food was wonderful and it was a perfect low key type of place. Downside? They close at ten pm. Came here last night with a bunch of friends, one was very drunk so I apologize to the staff for him being an idiot. The sandwiches were AMAZING, huge and require a fork to eat. We got the La Goulette special which was any sandwich with fries, got 3 Sha-lafel (falafel and shawarma together) specials, 1 falafel sandwich and 1 cauliflower and artichoke sandwich. Out of seven people, two are vegan and they LOVED it. The rest of us who are fell in love too. Will definitely be back!"

We ordered the Mixed Grill plate to share between two people as well as Tunisian Hand Cut Fries, just in case the plate wasn&#39;t enough.

So when I walk into a new Mediterranean joint, I feel like I should get the falafel...but really I want the shawarma. La Goulette has anticipated this dilemma, and as a result, slapped the Shalafel on their menu. 

It&#39;s exactly what you think it is.

This pita full of basically everything was carefully constructed by the friendly guy behind the counter, hugely flavorful, and smashed the spot. I&#39;ll do it again next time I&#39;m walking by in need of a massive nearly vegetarian snack.

This place is hands-down one of my favorite delivery spots (and restaurants, period) in Williamsburg. The price is very fair, the food is really consistent, the delivery is fast (and I live 10+ blocks away) and the quality is spot-on. My only complaint is the early closing time, but hey, get home and be with your family. Can&#39;t be mad at that.

I always order the chicken kebab or chicken shawarma plate, which is a huge plate of food for $14. The chunks or shavings of well-seasoned (not shy on the salt/seasoning, but that&#39;s a good thing) chicken are always super quality (no gristle, fat, etc. - I&#39;m particular) and the portion is not lacking. Laid over a bed of seriously tasty basmati rice, this all goes side-by-side with a generous portion of Mediterranean salad (which I don&#39;t honestly eat besides the cucumber and onion, but my girlfriend says it&#39;s really good so I trust it is). 

It&#39;s worth it to get an extra side of harissa (not too hot, but has some spice) and tahini sauce (50 cents each, no biggie) -- they are excellent, too.  I always get tabbouleh (which is really good, always fresh, never a day old or soaked in lemon to disguise the age) on the side, which runs a little expensive ($5 for small, $8 for large) but it&#39;s kinda a must. Hummus is good as well, but again runs a little expensive ($4

TIP: The portion is enough for a dinner and a lunch if you are a portioner. I&#39;m not, but I sometimes order extra chicken (shwarma or kebob chunks, you choose) for an extra $4 and save a meal for the next day."

My husband is half Tunisian, so I am always on the looks out for Tunisian restaurants.

First off the owners Karim and Millie were unbelievably nice and hospitable. As soon as Karim found out my husband was Tunisian, he stopped what he was doing in the kitchen to come out and talk to us. We spoke about the food, history - anything Tunisian related! Millie even made several recommendations of other Tunisian places we could try, I thought that was super nice.

Onto the food!

We had the falafels and they were literally the best falafels I have ever had. Some other places I have tried them, they have been flavorless, dry, or oily. These were perfectly flavored, crispy on the outside and moist inside. We should have had 2 orders.

I had the merguez sausage, and they were so good. They were filled with so many spices, and were perfectly chewy. I really could&#39;ve eaten a whole plate of just the sausage! It was served with rice and salad - the dressing on the salad was really good too.

My husband had the mixed grill (?) plate. It came with merguez sausage, beef kefta, and chicken kabob with rice and salad. He said every meat was delicious, but the beef was his favorite.

Karim was nice enough to offer us some complimentary mint tea and baklava - also delicious!

We will definitely be back - I&#39;m dying to try new dishes, the portions are huge for the price, all the food was fresh, and of course the owners are amazing :-)"

Having never been there before I was torn with what to try for my first lunch. I decided to get the mixed grill platter - that way I could try out three things at once. 

It was a brilliant idea, and a ton of food! The platter comes with Tunisian merguez, kefta and chicken kabob served over rice with some side salad. I had mine topped with the usual sauce plus some hot sauce - that is definitely the way to go. The meats were excellent - perfectly cooked and still somewhat moist. The rice and salad were nice accompaniments to help cut the richness of the meat heavy dish. 

I will definitely be back to try out some of their pitas now that I know the quality of their food."

Thank you Karim!! They know how to do it right. Great Tunisian food is hard to find. You can find Mediterranean just about anywhere but to have it done right in a fast but upscale casual setting without seeming cheap?  Very slim.  I ordered lamb merguez. The salad, the lamb sausage and the yellow rice... Amazingly aromatic and flavorful. I finishes the whole plate, and this was after stopping at Crif Dogs barely 10mins earlier! Is that not a testament to just how good it is?

I also ordered Turkish Coffee.  A thick amazing coffee that&#39;ll sure give you a jolt any time of the day.  The equipment is all behind the counter... You can see them work their magic the whole time. They do a good service to the neighborhood, seriously.  Look them up on Seamless if you&#39;re lazy, but do yourself a favor and walk right in.

My mom is very picky about eating out and so she has very high standards. This is one of the places that she likes going to, so that in itself says a lot. My dad is a bit of a falafel connoisseur and he says that the falafel here is the best he&#39;s had in Williamsburg. Another thing to consider is that I have digestive problems and this is one of the places where I can eat the food with no problem.

I couldn&#39;t pick up what was in the dressing but it was leaning more on the sweet/tart side. The chicken shawarma was flavorful as well but I wish I got it as a sandwich rather than a plate simply because the pita bread looked good and the plate was too big of a serving for me. The baklava was delicious - not saturated with honey so it still has a crunch. Their baklava is also pretty large so you get a good amount for your money.

Service was amazing and the people who work there were kind and funny. They really take the effort to help you out when you need it.

Interior was well done. Instead of sitting in front of the counter I recommend walking to the back where they have more seating - you can see the cool interior there."

The portion was decent but it was slightly small for $10. or maybe i was just really hungry that night. 

That was actually the bf&#39;s dish and I liked it. 

I got the Babaganoush over Chicken Shawarma $9, but it really should be chicken over babaganoush. With this dish, you get 4 quarters of pita bread which IMHO was too little for the dish. I needed more pita bread to use up the babaganoush. The chicken was also a bit dry. I hate dry chicken breast meat :( 

We also got the mint tea but we failed to realize that it was only served hot. We tried to ask for some ice cubes to cool it down since we were in a rush to see a show nearby (Streb) and we were told the ice cubes would dilute it too much and that&#39;s not how it is served traditionally. I think they just didn&#39;t have ice cubes. It was very fresh and had lots of mint leaves in the teapot though. It was good but just not good for a hot summer day.

La Goulette was next in my long list so off we went on a rainy Friday evening. E and I walk in and Nancy Ajram was playing on the speakers- I like this place already.

I surveyed the cafeteria style layout of the food and chose the chicken shawarma platter and my bf got the bbq chicken platter. I preferred his order as my chicken was too vinegar-y. I&#39;ve noticed that Egyptian and Tunisian places are usually very heavy-handed on the acetic acid (La Goulette is Tunisian) and this place was no exception. 

1 star for the music selection (Amr Diab, Najwa Karam, and Nancy Ajram are prominent standouts), 1 star for the wonderful grandma-type cashier, and 1 star for the nice guys behind the counter. Food had a homey feel but didn&#39;t live up to my (very) high expectations as per usual when it comes to middle eastern food. Do come by and give this place a shot- you&#39;ll definitely keep coming back. 

Btw, they have water pitchers by the tables near the entrance- don&#39;t buy bottled water if you can help it."

Behold, La Goulette. The marriage of my two loves - Middle Eastern Cuisine and salad. The owners have no idea how amazing their food is and were so humbly gracious with the compliments we threw at them. I ordered myself a Kale and Avocado salad with a side of hummus and pita. The hummus was swimming in lemon juice and sumac, but I&#39;m a huge fan of acidity and citrus so my palette was super pleased. My friend had the vegetable platter, which included 4 decently sized falafel balls. Unlike other falafel I have had, their recipe was a little nuttier and sweeter tasting. To cap our meal, we had some traditional mint tea served in proper kettle and silver tray. 

The whole ride home I kept rubbing my belly and singing the praises of Tunisian cuisine. Next time I will bring more of an appetite and get adventurous with the animal protein choices on their menu. Too bad I live too far for take away..."

They will knock off the first pair. I found myself in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with a friend on a family errand. We expected to get there earlier, but because of traffic, we were there about 1:30 and neither of us had eaten lunch. We walked into this place expecting to have a legitimate falafel on pita and not much more.  Boy, were we surprised!  When we saw what the more sumptuous dishes looked like, we were seduced. I had a falafel salad with some mint tea. The place is Tunisian by cuisine, but could be more generally characterized as Mediterranean and just BEAU COUP DELISH. Sorry about the spelling.
I am very embarrassed. We ate there more than a week ago and I planned to review it shortly thereafter, but I misplaced the card. My friend had merguez (Tunisian sausage)  with a nice salad and rice. She had to fight me off her plate once I tasted it. There is no wait service, but please don&#39;t let that stop you. We also had some Tajine ( some kind of hot pot-pot pourri. Everything very fresh, very delicious.  

Very positive attitude by the staff and very clean place. If this kind of quality and presentation keeps up, I predict a solid future for this restaurant and its owner, despite the hideous NYC competition that exists. It may be immoral to get this excited about food with all the starving people in the world! This place may bring me back to Williamsburg for an encore. And I don&#39;t live close. Prices quite reasonable."

The place itself is clean, modern, yet comfortable. 

I tried the falafel which was very good. Freshly made, loaded with falafel balls, fresh veggies and white sauce, I enjoyed it very much. The best part- it only cost $4.00. I also got to try their hummus and babaganosh and both were great as well. The hummus especially! 

While I usually go to Oasis for their falafel, the fact that I don&#39;t need to walk all the way up there and still have great falafel works for me. I am a convert. Can&#39;t wait to try their other dishes!"

Pros
1. The price to food ratio is really in your favor. They give you plenty to eat.

2. It isn&#39;t just cheap, it&#39;s consistently good as well, surprising for a WillyB spot that have to compensate with trendy food to mark up margin to make rent.

3. Did I mention the HUMMUS or BABAGANOUSH? Yes! They make it quite different from other middle eastern/mediterranean stops. They are much more thick (which is to my liking) and the tunisian spices make it it&#39;s own.(I think its sumac, not sure)

Cons
1. You have to pick up the food yourself, but OH WELL. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re tipping anyone!

2. It&#39;s not close enough for me! I live on the other side of BK and its quite hard for me to get to.

The fianc√© had an order of chicken little with a side of mac and cheese while I had the chicken sandwich with a side of coleslaw. Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned. The service was also great!

For dessert we had both the banana pudding and pecan maple pudding. The banana pudding was very good but I would have appreciated bits of real banana in it. The pecan maple pudding was also good but a little too sweet for myself. The fianc√©, however, devoured it.

As for the main star (chicken), it was kind of a let down. It wasn&#39;t the worse I&#39;ve had but not the best either. The good thing about the chicken was that it was cooked really well. Meat fell right off the bone. But I wish there was more breading and crispness to it. It was lacking. Coleslaw was good and fresh. Biscuit is one of the best I&#39;ve had. Really simple tasting. Sourdough and buttery flavor. Really fluffy and soft. Amazing! Onion rings lacked flavor and breading was falling off. I saw someone order the buffalo chicken sandwich and it looked really good.

Came here on a Friday night around 9pm. Lucked out and didn&#39;t have to wait as a spot had just opened up. But after us came a few parties that had to wait 10-15 minutes. It&#39;s a relatively small place that looks like it seats 15-20 people max. But food comes out quick and is well worth the wait. 

We shared the friend chicken supper (3 pieces with biscuit and cole slaw), mac n cheese (thick and creamy), and onion rings (which was a ginormous plate). Everything was SO TASTY. Like my mouth is watering as I&#39;m writing this a remembering it. The best part? All of that food only cost us $23!

It is not stressed enough how damn good their fried chicken is. It&#39;s so good, I&#39;m practically drooling right now just thinking about it. And the last time I had this was in February.

For a party of three people, we all decided to get the Fried for 4, best decision of the night. It came with 3 sides, slaw, 4 biscuits, and 12 pieces of heavenly fried chicken. 

The skin was crunchy and seasoned, the meat itself is juicy and flavorful, all in all, amazing fried chicken. Add some of that honey tabasco and it&#39;s even better.

Their biscuits are also worth mentioning, it was the favorite part of the meal for my friend actually.

Rather than try to get descriptive about my fried chicken experience, i feel for fried chicken fans this need to be in your list. What I will say is the sides really stand well with their chicken. Often times it will be great chicken and mediocre sides which leaves you with kind of a muddled experience. The coleslaw and Mac and cheese are definite must-haves.

We had six glasses and three plates in front of us, and as soon as any one of them was empty they would run over and first pick it up and then second ask if they could take it away, which interrupted our conversations repeatedly and made us feel rushed and made us feel unwelcome even though the restaurant was completely empty, and then when we still had two full glasses of beer left they threw the check down like they were trying to make us leave even though we were quietly and discreetly enjoying ourselves, and then when we were obviously upset by all their rushing the woman behind the bar decided that we needed to be lectured about how everything she did was correct and how hospitality works, as if we had never been to a restaurant before, as if we both hadn&#39;t spent all of our lives in customer service and hospitality, so it just made bad matters worse by not letting an issue be resolved by beating a dead horse and making us feel even more pressured and uncomfortable."

I wouldn&#39;t mind if it were spicier, but what I really liked was that it wasn&#39;t overly vinegary, like Tabasco.

They have a small, simple menu of comfort food with all winners and no fillers. You basically select the fried chicken platter (or the catfish platter and more on this later) and choose one of the sides.  You&#39;ll get a biscuit too.  All are top notch and prepared just when you order, except for the side (and let it be clear, there is no benefit to such sides being prepared per order anyway).  

The chicken isn&#39;t brined in black tea for 14 hours or over-embellished in any way. It is finely breaded and always tasty and juicy.  They use a slightly smaller chicken, which may disappoint some.  I think it&#39;s a masterstroke as the smaller chicken pieces cook faster and more evenly; every bite is tasty and juicy.  Also, three pieces of chicken of that size align more with the portion of protein what we should be eating in a meal, and it&#39;s balanced well with a side of collard greens and the amazingly light yet decadent biscuit. We are just used to &#34;supersize&#34; dimensions. The chicken and breading are well seasoned. There is no breast piece, which I am totally in agreement with as that piece should be grilled and dropped in a caesar salad elsewhere.  The breading level may also disappoint some but to me, the purpose of fried chicken breading is to keep the meat juicy and tender and complement the texture and taste. All that extra breading is actually what makes fast food fried chicken so calorific. 

The prices are also on point. I don&#39;t think I need to make a point in this review about the ridiculously high food prices in manhattan, driven by fads and an inflation of perceived values for ordinary meals like ramen (which costs 2.5-3X more than in Tokyo despite the intense competition).  Providing a quality product at a fair price makes Bobwhite a place you can visit regularly and appreciate. 

After at least a dozen meals of the chicken platter, I figured it was &#39;now or never&#39; that I try the catfish.  Let&#39;s just say that I didn&#39;t miss the chicken one bit. That&#39;s always the fear when you stray from your &#34;go to&#34; but I conclude that in this test, that the catfish is an equal to the chicken and deserving of its place on the menu.  I have yet to try the chicken tenders or any of the sandwiches but I&#39;m now eager to explore the menu further. Also, all the sides are very good."

They also say they close at 10PM, but they take customers up until then because I arrived at 9:30 and did not leave until after they closed as did a few other tables, so I liked that I wasn&#39;t rushed. The only thing is that it&#39;s so out-of-the-way on Ave C. I&#39;m so happy they&#39;ve opened a West Village location!"

Bobwhite about 70-80 times over the last 6 months. There have been some weeks where I&#39;ve ordered 3-4x within that week. I&#39;ve always been happy about the food and delivery time can be a pain sometimes but nothing crazy. 

Yesterday however is when I&#39;ve had major issues which wouldn&#39;t be fixed. I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches w fries and a pecan bread pudding. 

The bread pudding was fine. 

One of the chicken sandwiches was burnt to the point where the areas were dark black and all you can taste was char and oil. 

The other chicken sandwich was completely fine but inside of the box, I found 2 hairs under the fries.

I religiously only order the Chicken Little (thigh, wing, drumstick, biscuit, slaw), drizzled with honey and hot sauce. SO GOOD. I did stray once and order the fried chicken sandwich with a side of pimento cheese (also very good, but I much prefer straight up fried chicken on the bone). Mac and cheese is also a solid choice. Friends of mine swear by the Farmhouse Salad and add buffalo chicken, but I have yet to try that due to my Chicken Little addiction. 

By far one of the most consistent restaurants in NYC.

I wasn&#39;t that hungry, so I ordered  the fried chicken on a biscuit, basically a small chicken sandwich.  WOW...  The chicken was wonderfully juicy, and the biscuit was tasty too.  The biscuit broke up while I was eating it, but I didn&#39;t care.  The taste was just so great.  This was just the pick me up that I needed before continuing with my walk.

The guy next to me had the fried chicken supper (which they serve for lunch too!).  If it tastes half as good as it smelled, it would be wonderful.  I have to try it the next time I go there.

The place is small, but it isn&#39;t cramped.  The d√©cor was nice, and I enjoyed the tunes that they were playing (interesting country-style covers of rock songs).

I should add the waitress working there (I forget if her name was Sondra or Sandra) was super-nice and helpful.  

I don&#39;t walk into this neighborhood too often, but after visiting Bobwhite Counter, that will change.  I will definitely go back there in the future!!!"

I said it had that same bullshit minimal garbage look that every place around LES has now a days (gentrification.) I said this is probably some white boy cooking the food.

Well, I was right about two things, it has that annoying minimal font and interior that I am sick of seeing around the neighborhood, it does look like a yuppie place... But it is some real southern food, and it&#39;s fucking fantastic.

I ordered the standard dish which consisted of 3 pieces of chickie (thigh, wing, boned breast) which also included a biscuit and coleslaw. I also ordered the collard greens.

The collard greens, they were fucking amazing, yo. Where the fuck you even get collard greens anymore let alone mad tasty? Don&#39;t say Pies and Thighs, that place is bullshit. The collard greens were cooked to perfection, almost had a meaty texture alone and had some amazing flavor that I somewhat could pin point but wasn&#39;t sure. Anything that makes me curious in a way where I really want to know what&#39;s in it food wise, is always something that I don&#39;t forget. I wish they put more than one piece of sausage in it though, it looked like it was a mistake, but it&#39;s all good. (Throw some more pieces in there though, yo!)

The dish, I can&#39;t honestly say I&#39;ve had a chicken dish that each and every piece had a perfectly cooked breading, flavorful but not too greasy, but had so much fucking juice, I felt like I was in a Tropicana factory that served chicken! Especially the breast, that was unlike anything I&#39;ve eaten in NYC since I travel around every now and then and don&#39;t even fuck with my own cities food no more like that. This shit was legit.

Wasn&#39;t really feeling the coleslaw, but you never hear someone say &#34;that joint got some good ass coleslaw, homey.&#34; Was a bit on the light side, but it wasn&#39;t not tasty, just a bit on the blan side. All good.

The fucking biscuit though, threw some honey on it by the way... That fucking biscuit. That biscuit. Who cooked that biscuit, mother fucking Teresa?! I never seen a biscuit that looked like it was from an anime, perfectly colored all ways around, and the taste and the amount of butter default was out of sight. It looked like a genetically modified biscuit from heaven (it&#39;s not genetically modified for all you vegan/gluten free pusses.)

I fucking love this spot, and I will be back A LOT more and recommend it highly. I don&#39;t give 5&#39;s because there&#39;s no such thing as perfection, but this place is damn fucking near perfection, wherever it is. Peace."

Probably my favorite spot, even though I wasn&#39;t as hungry after eating before.  The catfish, chicken for four, with biscuit and collard greens/ Mac and Cheese.  Everything was really spot on as always.  This is probably my 3-4 time going.  We lucked out and managed to get a table for 6, seating went by fast after we got ours.  Sweet tea was a nice touch to help with the chicken.  We asked for dark meat, and it was well worth the flavor.  I did try a little bit of the syrup and hot sauce on my last piece.  Will have to do more, since I normally only do it for white meat, when its a tad bit dry.  

Service is excellent, very friendly and responsive.  It is a bit far from everything else, so be aware.  Nice coozy spot, a bit small for large groups more than 4-5.

We ordered the onion rings, a side of Mac and cheese and the fried chicken dinner to share between the two of us. The chicken was delicious, juicy and crispy. It came with three pieces of chicken. (Two legs and a breast) We also had a biscuit as well. My boyfriends loved the biscuit!

I really enjoyed their Mac and cheese. And the onion rings were really good. We enjoyed the restaurant. Everything we had was good and well priced! Basically everything you could want out of a chicken joint. 

My only complaint was that only after we had been seated, eaten and left did the restaurant call us to tell us our table was ready. Essentially, if we didn&#39;t come back to check in, another group would have walked in and been seated before us. Oh well, it all worked out in the the end!"

Seems like many spots are opening up across NYC nowadays touting their famous fried chicken. I have tried many of them but still keep coming back to Bobwhite to get my fried chicken fix. Bobwhite is the shady street corner pusher feeding my fried chicken addiction.

And why not? Their chicken kicks ass! 

It&#39;s a small spot so sometimes there is a wait. No biggie as it seems most will come here to chow down then leave and not linger. I really hate those people who will hang around and talk and talk after they are finished and just sip their drinks or ask for more water taking forever to give up the table. Get done and get the heck out!  How dare you make us wait in starving drooling anticipation! Leave!

The times I have been here with friends we order the fried chicken supper for four. It&#39;s a terrific value as it comes with a lot of delicious chicken, awesome biscuits with honey to pour on them, tasty cole slaw, and a choice of three sides. Mac &amp; cheese, collard greens, and more yumminess. Yes, I said yummy! Don&#39;t hate on me!

At other times when I have been here alone I&#39;ve sauntered up to a spot at their small bar/counter and taken a seat for a cold Shiner Bock beer on tap and a fried chicken supper for one. Three pieces of chicken with a biscuit and slaw - oh my! 

Get in mah bellah!

Great staff, cozy ambiance, and fairly priced delectable fried chicken and sides. It&#39;s a nice little joint - clean, comfortable, almost has a wine bar feel, simple menu, and sparkling bathroom too. 

Oh, and if you can fit it in as my fat-assery can normally do, there&#39;s always a little room left for dessert. Go ahead and check out the banana pudding and pecan pie. Then roll out the door with a brand new food baby in foodgasmic bliss."

A few people asked to substitute Mac and cheese for Cole slaw and were turned down. I don&#39;t get why they don&#39;t let you do that for a small fee. Seems like it would be a popular option. Also odd they don&#39;t seem the biscuits a la carte."

I came on a Saturday night and was able to get a table. Seating is on high bar stools and the place is dimly light for ~ambiance~. I thought overall the place was very cute and to be honest there isn&#39;t many sit-down restaurants for fried chicken in the area so I think it is well worth the visit. 

The food was plenty and affordable. For 5 people, we got a Fried Chicken Sandwich &amp; the Fried for Four that comes with 12 pieces of chicken total, four biscuits, coleslaw, and 3 sides. We got the Mac &amp; Cheese, Fries, and Onion Rings. Talk about indulgence. This was such a good meal though because it was great company enjoying some not-so-good-for-you food, but we had a blast and the atmosphere was so cozy and comforting.

however Bob White&#39;s Lunch and Supper Counter serves up some mean-tasting chicken that&#39;s all friendly from first chew to last bite. crispy crunchy skin with that right amount of savor and light spice to juicy chi&#39;k&#39;n meat! though there always seem to be some fried chicken wars in NYC...if you are looking for tasty home-style fried chicken, but Bob&#39;s delivers on that promise. Is it the best? idk. it doesn&#39;t really matter to me bc it&#39;s more than tasty...it hits all the necessary requirements for me: it&#39;s fried, no dried, seasoned perfectly, lots of crunch, and the always important succulent meat factor. the chicken is always consistent in quality--i&#39;ve eaten there a bunch. i do wish the pieces were bigger. they kinda crack skinny at times. however maybe it&#39;s becauce i--and many others-- are used to the steroided up chicken we see at other restaurants as well as supermarkets. idk. anyway the birds pieces can be lean-ish here but the taste is never compromised. the entree of fried chicken is ample for one person: 3 pieces, biscuit, &amp; slaw.  the biscuit. big. buttery. flaky/crumbly perfection. not greasy, yet has that fatty carb-ness we all love. yum.

the mac-n-cheese is on point. Bob&#39;s DOES NOT phone it in on the mac attack like many other places do nowadays. it tastes freshly made and smooth sillky and cheesy til the last bite. there other sides like fries, onion rings, and slaw. slaw comes with most entrees, so unless you&#39;re a slaw fanatic...no need to order it. i am curious about the onion rings which i have not had. regardless, order the mac-n-cheese!

the only sandwich here i&#39;d order is the fried catfish sandwich--that remoulade SAUCE! saucy crunchy carb-ness! the fried chicken (patty) sandwich is fine as  i&#39;m not a huge fan of fried chicken sandwiches. and why eat a fried chicken breaded patty when you can have the real deal and it taste much much much better imo. 

the beer here rotates (can and draft). they have Shiner Bock on tap which i love as well as canned brands like 21st amendment. there&#39;s a host of other brews to sample--all fit with the taste profile of the eats, so no bad choices there. AAAAAND for you non-alkies, the SWEET TEA is pretty good. i like.

the layout is pretty straightforward as the Bob&#39;s is pretty small. there&#39;s seating at the counter. and the right-side window. there&#39;s also 5-6 high tables that seat 2 each--they are often pushed together for larger groups. seating is tight, but turnover is quick once people get served. Bob&#39;s isn&#39;t a place you linger at. Bob&#39;s makes for a great casual date/dinner, catch-up with amigos/as over eats, and nice weekend lunch spot in the ABC. 

the staff is pleasant and works well within the tight confines of the eatery. when tables fill up and everyone is ordering multiple chicken orders expect a lil bit of a wait for your food. it&#39;s not KFC, so wait&#39;s on food are part of the game of better tasting quality. 

PRO TIP: Take a group of three to BOB&#39;s. ORDER THE DINNER for 4 fried chicken. 
Well worth it! You&#39;ll all get 4 pieces each as well as 4 biscuits (total) and 3 sides (total) to share! HURRAY for GLUTTONY!

drops mic, so i handle the chicken in one hand and the biscuit inn the other!
i out.

We had to wait a few minutes, as the space is relatively small and all the tables were taken, but the staff was attentive and we ordered drinks in the meanwhile. Relaxed little nook, pretty discreet unless you know it&#39;s there.

I ordered the catfish dinner and hubby ordered the fried chicken dinner, plus a side of onion rings and sweet tea (they automatically refill fo&#39; free). Catfish was delish, the batter had a slight kick, and the sauce (blackened tartar/ranch?) was YUM and hubby enjoyed his chicken thoroughly, although not the coleslaw as much. The massive portion of onion rings were good too. Despite knowing that it was all deep fried, it was oilier than I would have preferred. 

We experienced heartbreak though: hubby dropped his delicious biscuit on the floor after only two bites. He seriously lamented this biscuit for a good few minutes, so yeah, it was that good.

The Mac n cheese was clearly baked in a pan because it still have a portion of the crust on top like a serving from Thanksgiving. The biscuit was soft and buttery.

At close to 1:30pm Sunday, there was no wait for a table of two.  However, we did see the place start to get packed and a group soon formed outside around 2, 2:15pm.  There is both counter/bar seating as well some tables.

Service was lackluster.  Our waitressed seemed to have some sort of attitude or just plain didn&#39;t like her job.  I watched her make &#34;ugh&#34; behind the counter multiple times.  We wanted to use our AmazonLocal deal and she said &#34;I don&#39;t know if we take that&#34; and had to ask her manager.  Said manager said they were new at this, so I understand.  Said manager guy also said I could substitute my cole slaw for my fried chicken platter with mac and cheese for an additional cost.  Then waitress said we don&#39;t do that, then saw her explaining to same &#34;manager&#34; that they don&#39;t do this.  Okay... so who&#39;s the manager exactly?  Our bill came at the end and still no $20 taken off... and apparently you are supposed to pay for your bill at the bar.  Weird.  Someone at the table next to us was complaining about their order being wrong, and then their food never coming.  Figures.

As for the food, it was also just mediocre for me.  I&#39;ve had better fried chicken.  For the price, though, you get what you pay for.  I had 2 breast pieces and one drumstick.  The breast pieces were cooked nicely and the outside crispy.  However, my drumstick was dry and I had to yank at it with my teeth.  Bleh.  The biscuit was probably the best - soft, warm, not too crazily buttered and went really well with the complimentary clover honey they provide at your table.  Cole slaw was just cole slaw... nothing special about it, but I liked that it wasn&#39;t oversaturated with sauce.  Didn&#39;t get to try any of the sides, but based on the people next to us smacking away and expressing their pleasure, I&#39;d say it was good.

Okay food, lackluster service."

What separates Bobwhite&#39;s chicken from other places like say, Peaches, is that the meat is so very very moist. The fried breading is light - it tastes about as healthy as you can get fried chicken to taste while remaining flavorful with a crispy skin.

Maybe you need to eat in the restaurant to be able to write these rave reviews, but speaking from a delivery standpoint, I was thoroughly unimpressed. 

This food was average, at best and I guess I would have to say that the french fries were probably the best part. They&#39;re well-seasoned and relatively crispy upon arrival, despite having traveled in a take out container. 

Now, I&#39;m a little annoyed that this chicken sandwich was so unbelievably plain. They give me some bread, a chicken cutlet, and a several pickles. The pickles were a nice touch, but come on, even Mickey D&#39;s would throw a little mayo or ketchup or some other condiment onto the sandwich (which doesn&#39;t come with any lettuce or tomato, but is topped with their house coleslaw). The chicken was aight, but not so delicious that it could be so plainly served to any person for TEN DOLLARS!!!! No, ma&#39;am.

Coleslaw:
Recently, I&#39;ve been on a little bit of a coleslaw kick. Don&#39;t ask how or why because I used to despise coleslaw more than anything and donate it immediately to the nearest trash can, but lately it&#39;s grown on me. I ordered an extra side after reading everyone&#39;s reviews about this being the best fried chicken and blah blah. It&#39;s not. This coleslaw was pretty awful and bland and just overly mayonnaised (coming from a mayo lover). I can&#39;t believe I paid an additional $3.50 only to hate every bite of this cabbage salad! Nah, it&#39;s not the coleslaw&#39;s fault...

Bobwhite, I wanted to like you. I wanted to love you like others did before me, but you overcharged me for subpar food. Thanks for the fries and pickles."

The skin is fried just to the right amount of crispiness and it wasn&#39;t drenched in oil.

So I was surprised to arrive a little hipster chicken place. What makes it hipster chicken? The use of the word supper, of course. And the sassy young guys working the bar, too.

But millennial mustaches aside, they are serving up some darn good chicken supper! My boyfriend and I both ordered the full chicken supper - fried chicken, coleslaw and a biscuit. We also added a side of mac &amp; cheese to share.

I kid you not I am still thinking about that coleslaw. I&#39;m not usually a coleslaw person but this was like coleslaw crack. - I would become a coleslaw addict for sure if it always tasted this good. So creamy, so flavorful, so perfect with the hot chicken. If anyone has the recipe to share I would love you forever.

Okay, on to the rest of the food. It was just as good as the coleslaw! Fantastic chicken - definitely finger-lickin&#39; good, a yummy, fluffy biscuit and awesome mac &amp; cheese. A very satisfying meal for sure. We walked out a little fuller, a little greaser, and a lot happier.

The meal of the day was Chicken Little w/ Biscuit and side of cole slaw.  The chicken little includes a thigh, leg and wing.  This is pretty good portion if they used a bigger chicken.  But I guess the bigger the chicken the tougher the meat.  Maybe that&#39;s their secret on how they make their chicken CRAZY juicy!  I did wish the skin was bit more crispier though. 

The biscuit was really fluffy and when you add honey to it it was VERY good. 

The cole slaw was just ok.  Nothing to write home about.  While waiting for my food, I noticed some of the dine-in customers was having mac &amp; cheese.  It sure looked good, almost wished Bobwhite would have offered mac &amp; cheese instead of cole slaw as a side.

I&#39;m genuinely enthusiastic about this place, and legitimately cannot wait to go back. We went around 7 on a Friday (I hate waiting and had heard this place was small) and only a few tables were taken, but by the time we left, it was really filled up. I&#39;m conducting an unofficial friend chicken tour of the city, and this is definitely at the top (tied with a few other awesome places). 

We ordered the Fried Chicken Supper, which comes with cole slaw and a biscuit, and also an order of mac &amp; cheese, all to split. After we ordered, my boyfriend went to wash his hands, and all the food had arrived by the time he came back. As I mentioned, I hate waiting, so that was a wonderful surprise. The Fried Chicken Supper was HUGE, the 3 pieces they give you are easily split, and they give you honey to eat with it - HUGE plus at any of my fried chicken spots. The biscuit was crazy delicious and tasted mostly of butter. I thought the mac &amp; cheese was good, but not the best thing on the table by far, although I&#39;m admittedly picky about mac &amp; cheese. My boyfriend and I ate a crazy delicious and filling meal, and the bill was like $18.

We ordered the fried chicken supper for four which came with biscuits, cole slaw, and your choice of 3 sides. it was an okay hipster deal. 

I didn&#39;t love some of the sides. The fried okra was forgettable because it had no flavor. The potato salad is probably my favorite, in comparison. I always love cole slaw and the collards was only ok.  I smeared honey on the biscuit. Anything with honey smeared all over is yummy. 

The chicken was tasty, crunchy, hot and juicy. That&#39;s all I ask for from fried chicken. So far, wins best fried chicken in the hipster category.

Forget about bringing a large group because it&#39;s tiny in Bobwhite. There is a counter if you want to sit there and a few counter height tables. Maybe you can fit 15-20 people in this restaurant......maybe.

-Bit disappointed by the collard greens. Honestly bumped this down to a 4 from a 5. This is not what collard greens should taste like! No flavor and where was the bacon?? instead there were carrots. Skip on these, really just order two chicken sandwiches, thats what I wish I would have done."

I&#39;m usually never this deep in Alphabet City, but the Halloween Dog Parade was apparently great for the nearby businesses and we found ourselves walking further and further away to find a restaurant that wasn&#39;t packed full of people (and costumed dogs). 

Our timing at Bobwhite was perfect, the calm before the storm. There were just a few customers when we arrived, but got crowded very quickly after we ordered and by the time we finished, people were waiting. We hopped up on our window counter seats and ordered a fried chicken sandwich, fried catfish dinner, and side of mac n&#39; cheese. Simple good comfort food! 

The fried chicken sandwich was minimally dressed, just  a big ol&#39; filet with pickles and sandwiched between a buttered toasted bun, but oh man, it was sooo good! Perfectly seasoned, fried crispy and juicy! The slaw was a nice accompaniment. The catfish dinner came with grits that were rich and just a hit cheesy. The catfish itself was lightly battered and fried very crisp. It was a proper fried catfish and we both enjoyed it. The remoulade was very good as well. The mac n&#39; cheese was good, although not memorable for me (Dining companion enjoyed it more than I did)."

It&#39;s a very tiny place with a really cool vibe. Loved the oldies playing in the background. We sat at the bar since the handful of tables were already full. I ordered the chicken supper which came with three pieces of fried chicken, one biscuit and some coleslaw. My fianc√© ordered a fried chicken sandwich. We also got a side of onion rings. The chicken was out of this world -- so light, flaky, flavorful and surprisingly juicy on the inside. Phenomenal! The onion rings were also amazing. Super crispy and very well-seasoned. I&#39;m not a fan of coleslaw, so I didn&#39;t taste it, but my fianc√© said it had no flavor. I&#39;ll take it word for it. Overall, we had a fantastic meal and left very satisfied.

The only reason I knocked off a star is because the menu didn&#39;t include everything that they serve, which was kind of annoying. We only knew about the onion rings because we saw it on other people&#39;s dishes. Similarly, we were bummed to see a dish with mashed potatoes come out, as that was another item not on the menu.

Condiments - we asked for all of them and they obliged though the high top tables were less accommodating about that plate situation.

I sort of knew when I was telling him that it was going to go in one ear and out the other, even though he verbally acknowledged my order.

The Fried Chicken was so good - soft and tender on the inside, crispy on the outside. The soft and flaky biscuits with a tad of honey pretty much completes the dish. My favorite main dish out of the 4 we ordered was actually the Fried Catfish. Squeeze a little lemon on the catfish, add some sauce and eat it with Grits ... So good! The sandwiches were pretty tasty as well, but I prefer the fried chicken and fried catfish. Oh and the Mac &amp; Cheese was amazing, I love it.

Got the supper plate and was pleasantly pleased with the portions (I didn&#39;t think I would be able to finish but it was so delicious, ended up finishing every little fried crispy crumb).  The coleslaw was crunchy and not too sweet or mayo-y and served as a good contrast to cut the fried chicken greasiness.  The biscuit was flaky and light but still carried the heavy goodness of a home cooked biscuit; drizzle some honey and savor the amazing doughy goodness. 

The chicken...what can I say?  Crispy, moist, and piping hot...it was such a hot day but with the fried chicken plate set in front of me, I was eager to dive in.  Dive in I did. Those pieces of fried chicken stood no chance and my dining partner and I grew silent as we devoured our plates. Chicken was the star and salivating just thinking about it again.

The herbed grits were really good too and seemed the flavors became stronger as it cooled.  Weird, I know but hey, my dining companion agreed.

When I checked the menu online, I knew I either wanted to try the fried chicken sandwich or pimento cheese sandwich. The fried chicken is the specialty here; it is all free range and very fresh  I&#39;m not a big fan of regular fried chicken but the sandwich form sounded a lot more appealing. When I looked at the menu in the restaurant, I noticed they actually had a sandwich with both pimento cheese and chicken and knew I had to get that. I also decided to try the Mac and cheese. They have a pretty cool beer and wine selection; I had the Kelso Brown Ale since it is local and I&#39;ve liked the other Kelso beers I&#39;ve tried. 

The sandwich was quite good. The pimento cheese isn&#39;t as tangy or distinctive as I&#39;ve had in other places. With the chicken, it was good but I kind of wished I could taste it more. The bun was perfect and complimented both nicely; overall the sandwich was much better together as one then each component separately (as a sandwich should be). Mac and cheese was pretty good, a little unusual in texture but pretty good. This is a fairly dry mac and cheese so if you prefer yours to have more sauce, you may not be a fan. 

I did like what I ate here and my friend liked her buffalo chicken sandwich as well. I think my one criticism is that everything (Mac and cheese, chicken, coleslaw, pimento cheese) could maybe just use a tad bit more seasoning or flavor. But the food is still pretty good and the quality is great as well. It&#39;s not a huge shop but the service was really good and it wasn&#39;t very crowded when we were there"

The wait staff is also super friendly and attentive. I&#39;ve had to wait a little longer than usual for food on occasion, but the fried chicken is well worth the wait.

The chicken here literally melts in your mouth. The skin is crunchy and perfectly seasoned. The meat is juicy and tender. Their biscuit is delicious and buttery, and their mac n cheese is on another level. My boyfriend, who usually doesn&#39;t eat mac n cheese, will happily steal a couple of bites from mine when we&#39;re here.

The ramen was super yummy, and the service was extremely good. All waitresses were friendly and helpful. 

I had my 6 years old son with me and was ordering two separate ramen and kind of sad that I needed to pay so much, 32 dollars in exact price, just for ramen bowls but instead doing so, the waitress suggested me to have additional noodle in separate bowl and share soup and toppings with him. That worked out and payed only 18 dollars for both of us. 

My son wanted to have coke and it was 3 dollars and I was thinking it was kind of pricy but understood it was for &#34;Manhattan Price&#34;. However the old fashioned coke bottle came instead of boring coke in a glass or cup. That was very cute idea and we really liked it. 

I strongly recommend anyone who love ramen to visit this place.

Regular ramen: I liked their thin noodles (compared to other curly/wavy noodles) but I didn&#39;t really get wowed by their ramen in general. The broth wasn&#39;t as flavorful as the other ramen places (Ippudo, Totto)  in nyc.  The pork slices were OK.

Because the food was good, but not the greatest value


1 ramen, 1 fried rice, 4 pieces of chicken wings will run you $45. I didn&#39;t leave hungry, but seemed a little expensive.


Fried rice was good, and unique because they sprinkled fresh basil

The 4 pieces of chicken wing, punch of pepper.. and drenched in liquid sweet BBQ pepper like sauce. 

Ramen included half a boiled egg. Egg was perfect. Wished they gave both halves, it was delicious 

Service was good (and a little intense). When we sat down, within first few minutes the guy came back 3x - I needed more time w the menu. Good was water glass was always full, and came by w extra napkins like magic

You can get away with stuff like that in New York.

The 30 odd patrons that joined me in the small cramped space were all smiles, mainly in their 20s, and unphased by the blindingly white stark walls, and blaring club music. 

I, on the other hand, could have used a tranquilizer.

I was sat at a communal table, with hardly any elbow room, damned to endure conversations about Sarah&#39;s destination wedding in the Bahamas, the fact that someone assuages Instagram as a means to be productive to the danger of less self promotion.  

I could have gouged my eyes out with my chopsticks, as the music never seemed to break, having tried to enjoy my lovely bowl of ramen, with its silky soup, and fatty pork.  

Noodles seemed fresh, but as I waited to go, 15 minutes for my check standing up in fight or flight mode, the use of a spray butane can by the line cooks to &#34;smoke&#34; the pork belly, seemed a little less than wonderful. 

I had to eventually flag one of the impossibly busy servers to pay.

With 30 chairs, I know it&#39;s hard to make a profit with Chelsea rent, but the painfully loud nightclub soundtrack begs for me to run away. 

Atmosphere - uncomfortably crammed, unpleasantly loud, stark white modern fast food chic.
Food - decent ramen at about $15 bucks a bowl, $20 after tax and tip, isn&#39;t the best value in the city.

Don&#39;t get: unless you love love love truffle (more like truffle oil) don&#39;t get the uni mushroom. It tastes more like an Italian pasta than Asian. but if you do love truffle &amp; uni then definitely order this! My friend loved it. 

When to go: they don&#39;t take reservations for 6 people or less so go on the early side for lunch and dinner to avoid waiting. They don&#39;t have many seats but they serve quickly so turnover is fast. We went on a Saturday around 12:30pm and waited for only 25 minutes.

Other tips: For quite a few of their seats, they don&#39;t have anywhere that you can put your coats and in the wintertime we probably wear quite a bit...so might be a tad uncomfortable while eating and sitting on your big fat coat or holding on to it in your lap.

The broth is solid and the flavors work so well. They offer a variety of ramen from the luscious tonkotsu broth, to the more korean-tinged Kimchi. Their Uni Mazemen is out of this world decadent! Creamy with a thick mouthfeel, this has umami written all over it. And oh the uni, sooo much uni... Toppings are standard and the pork belly charshu has a good even quality of fat and meat. The marinated half egg and menma along with wood ear mushrooms are typical and done nicely.

Using MealPal, I normally pick up their Tonkotsu Ramen, Spicy Miso Ramen, or their Kimchi Ramen offerings which changes daily. The noodles and toppings are packed separately from the broth. The portion comes out to being quite large. Sometimes I have some broth leftover that I reheat for a later afternoon treat and you will notice how good the broth is by the fact that it congeals to a solid gelatin goodness and melts like butter in the microwave. Depending on the mealplan, this is probably the best value for the money here.

The broth was light and flavorful with the chili on the side to control how much heat you want. I of course dumped the whole thing in.

Try the Pork Bone Ramen and taste the broth. What&#39;s different? It&#39;s clean and refreshing. Not oily and greasy like other broths used at various ramen shops. 

I particularly appreciated the soft boiled egg and the noodles that reminded me of thin Kalgooksu. 

Although I didn&#39;t try their dessert, the cheesecake looked quite similar to the one they sell at DomoDomo. They even topped it with red bean, just like DomoDomo. WOMP. I mean, it&#39;s not a dessert restaurant so I won&#39;t deduct a star.

We ordered the Tuna Pok√© appetizer to share, debated on the fried rice (but ultimately did not get it), and each got our own heaping bowl of steaming Ramen (Pork Bone x2, and Spicy Pork Bone).

My favorite is the plain pork broth ramen because it&#39;s very delicious and tasty. I&#39;ve had this ramen a couple of times though and it can be a little salty. 

The standout dish here imo is the uni ramen. It&#39;s done so well and tastes just like pasta with a twist. The flavor is quite rich so definitely heavier and more Americanized than the typical ramen dish. The textures also mesh so well together. 

Last but not last definitely try the kimchi rice. Its seriously amazing. Most kimchi rice just tastes like kimchi, but this one has some extra depth in flavor and the sausage adds a nice touch too.

We also tried the green tea creme brulee. Let me just say, you have to try it! It&#39;s worth getting every bit of it out of the cup! I had to fight my boyfriend to eat more of it haha~

Unfortunately, they forgot to give me my extra egg I wanted, but our waiter was nice and gave us a complimentary beverage."

Not so little actually...have like 50 seats I would say. The decor was trendy and chic. It is open kitchen ramen bar, so you can see what the chef is doing with your food if you sit at the bar. 

The menu was one page, very simple. But everything sounds delicious. 

Tried the famous uni mushroom ramen! Beyond expectation. It&#39;s more like pasta to me since it was creamy. (Btw I not a big fan of cream pasta, but this one was awesome. ) The uni was fresh, you can taste that sweetness and a subtle bitterness. ($18)

Greentea br√ªl√©e: love green tea flavor. But the sugar coat was a little bit over burnt and a little bit too thick. I saw how they sprinkle sugar on the green tea custard and seared it. Then put it in the fridge. They took it out a few minutes later and brought it to me. The pot was still a little hot. Love the feeling of food made fresh. 

Will definitely come back. There are so many other things that I want to try as I was watching how they make it from the bar. Kimchi fried rice looked amazing. It was a full bowl of kimchi and then mixed with sauce. The friend chicken looks nice too."

Smartly located in the middle of Chelsea, it opened in fall of 2015 to no small fanfare, thanks to the experience of Chef Jun Park (who honed his skills at Zutto and Catch) and the photo-worthy signature Uni Mazemen.

Typical of most ramen-yas. the location doesn&#39;t take reservations (so come prepared to wait, especially during peak hours) and offers a handful of kitchen counter seats in addition to a number of two tops; it&#39;s not the best place to come with a large groups, so parties of 2-4 are ideal. On the night we visited, we were able to snag two seats in front of the kitchen and had the chance to watch a number of dishes being made throughout the service.

To start off with: the Jun-Men Fried Rice was the most unique appetizer on the menu for us, and it&#39;s a tasty, albeit predictable, take on kimchi fried rice. The portion is more than enough to share between two people, and the slightly toothsome rice is rounded out by sweet Chinese Sausage, the acidic and crunchy kimchi, and tobiko. With a slightly runny fried egg on top, how could you go wrong?

As for the ramen, I went with my default Spicy Miso. Here, the base begins with a Tonkotsu broth and is topped with several slices of chashu, kikurage mushrooms, bamboo, scallions, a soft-boiled egg, and a spoonful of miso paste. The foundation of the bowl, the broth, failed to impress; it wasn&#39;t as robust and rounded as a well-developed broth should have been, and lacked the extra dimension of umami that we were hoping for. The promised spice was also nowhere to be found, although the spoonful of miso blended well into the broth base. As for the noodles, a thin, wavy type sourced from (who else but) Sun Noodles - they had the requisite bite and texture, which was complemented well by the various toppings, but couldn&#39;t save the bowl from the somewhat disappointing broth.

While I can&#39;t speak to the signature Uni Mazemen that has been Jun Men&#39;s trademark dish, I can at least vouch for the fact that at least when it comes to the traditional preparations, Jun Men didn&#39;t entirely hit the mark. While it is refreshing to note that areas like Chelsea, which aren&#39;t particularly well known for their culinary diversity, are seeing places like Jun Men pop up, it won&#39;t be one of the places at the top of my list to go to when I&#39;m craving a bowl of ramen."

Sure, it&#39;s not the most traditional, but that just makes things more fun. I had the place bookmarked for a while because it was on one of those hundred best ramen lists that get put out every year.

Stopped by on a random Tuesday night after an event at the McKittrick and sat at the front bar. That&#39;s where you can place takeout orders and where you can sit to wait for your food, but I sat there because the lighting was good (once a photographer, always a photographer).

To start, I had the tuna tataki poke. Poke is definitely having its 15 minutes of fame, and Jun-Men&#39;s is up there as one of my favorite versions. Mostly because it had caviar in it. It was served over brown rice. Wasn&#39;t too heavy, but wasn&#39;t exactly light, so the perfect complement for ramen.

For my main, I just couldn&#39;t resist ordering the Uni Mushroom mazemen (broth-less ramen). It also had truffles, roasted pancetta, and parmesan cheese. &#34;Rich&#34; doesn&#39;t even begin to describe it. I needed a cigarette afterwards, and I don&#39;t even smoke anymore.

If you like any (or all) of those flavor combinations, this is a must-have dish. Definitely one of the most unique ramens I&#39;ve had.

Service was quick, and I was in and out in about 25 minutes.

Would definitely come back to try their regular ramen, weather permitting. But I had a good time. I did indulge a bit, as the tuna poke was the most expensive appetizer, and the Uni mushroom mazemen was the most expensive ramen. But if you don&#39;t treat yourself, who will?"

We came on a Saturday just before the 3 p.m. closing, and snagged a small two top. It works for now, but I hope they have a plan for winter coat season. 

First up was an order of bbq pork buns. I&#39;d suggest the plain variety next time. Although the buns were aesthetically pleasing, the bbq flavor was more Kansas City than Beijing. The spouse selected the pork bone broth ramen and I the spicy. The waitress eyed me quizzically when I tried to order tonkatsu.  I liked the fact that there was no upcharge for spicy, since it was just an application of chili oil as far as I could tell. The broth was unctuous, the toppings superb, the noodles the straight thin sort. The two pieces of pork were unremarkable. As other have remarked, the price is on the high side at $15.00. Compare this with the $15.50 Mega at Totto, where you get six pieces of chashu. I suppose Jun-Men is a bit more stylish.

We finished with green tea cheesecake, two small triangles of cheesy macha enjoyment. 

On the whole, a refined experience, and a nice addition to the area."

It&#39;s small, but they make great use of their space. It wasn&#39;t crowded at all at 1pm on a weekday, but I can definitely imagine it fills up during dinner. Love that there&#39;s an open kitchen, like at most ramen shops, because it was really cool to get to sit by the counter and watch the chefs cook and plate the ingredients. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and service was attentive. The shop gets lots of natural light and the decor is clean, minimal, and modern, which really sets it apart from other ramen spots in the city.

I ordered the spicy pork bone ramen ($14) and my boyfriend ordered the kimchi ramen ($15). Can we first take a moment to appreciate the fact that the spicy and regular flavor are both the same price for once?? I love spicy food and it&#39;s always so frustrating to go to ramen shops and see that it costs more to make it spicy. And even better, this was easily one of the most memorable bowls of ramens I&#39;ve ever had. The bone broth was so rich and flavorful and the chili oil really enhanced all the flavors in the bowl. It wasn&#39;t heavy and greasy at all, unlike many other ramens in NYC. All the ingredients in the bowl were excellent as well, but I think the black oil stood out the most. The fragrant black oil elevates the flavor of the entire bowl and you can definitely taste it. The kimchi ramen packed a good amount of heat with tender pork shoulder and generous kimchi, but my boyfriend and I both agreed the spicy pork bone was the favorite! 

Overall, I&#39;m super impressed with Jun-Men and would definitely recommend this to any ramen lover. I&#39;m excited to come back for more!"

I like this place way better than Ippudo or Toto Ramen.

Came last friday night at 930pm, no lines, no wait, glad they are still open.
Simple and neat decor, modern and neat, there are seats where you can look at the open kitchen, the other side faces the bar
Both the wait and the ambiance are way better than the competitors

Food we ordered:

1. BBQ pork bun ($9) - comes in 3, and it was really really good, the pork was super tender and some part was fatty and it was really good. I hope it has less mayo inside though, will request for it next time

2. Kimchi ramen ($15) - spicy! but the right amount of spiciness, yummy

3. Pork Bone Ramen ($14) - broth is amazing, it is nothing compared to the greasy and heavy pork bone broth in other ramen places, it is the right amount of heaviest. The ramen are thinner ramen, i love it. The pork is tender as well. The portion was awesome, i really like it.

DESSERT was the best part:

They have Green tea cheesecake on the menu, but they had Green tea creme brulee as special the day i went, so i tried the creme brulee

Green Tea Creme Brulee - HEAVEN: MUST TRY, and i would definitely come back for more! Dense taste of green tea, very very yums. 
I literally told the server this item must get on the menu as a regular item!
and less than a week later THEY DID! it&#39;s on the regular menu now!(http://www.junmenramen.com/menu/#menu-1) 

I would recommend this place to everyone and I would for sure come back mulitple times, this is probably the most satisfactory ramen experience i&#39;ve had in the city!"

So my first impression when my friend suggested me Jun-Men was...hmm...is it really that good?? 

So I opted for their signature mushroom uni ramen (no broth) while my friend got the pork ramen. I guess everything just worked out perfectly - uni fresh, ramen chewy, mushroom tasty, the butter and oil made it even more flavorful. Even though we had little room for dessert, we could never say no to the delicately prepared green tea cheese cake! The best way to end our dinner.

I guess I found the best ramen spot in the city so far! Liked the way they combine classic and exotic."

I got there a little around 6pm and I was seated immediately, so that&#39;s already a plus in my eyes. we started with the Kim Chi fried rice as our appetizer.  It was a great portion for an appetizer, could honestly order it as an entree because it was a generous amount and totally worth it for the price (10$ - if I remember right)

my friend and I both got the spicy pork bone soup, and had the spicy oil on the side. the initial taste of the soup, tasted a bit herbally - which is kind of interesting because I did not expect for it to taste this way. However with the addition of their chili oil, which was a mix of roasted garlic, sesame and chili oil, the soup was pretty good. The noodles were cooked al dente, and the cha siew was tender. Not the best I&#39;ve ever tried. I would most definitely come back to try their spicy miso ramen. they seem to have a variety of different things on their menu, so it seems like a solid place. it doesn&#39;t compare to some of my favorite ramen places, but if I&#39;m ever in the meat packing district, I would come again.  they take card also a plus."

Onto the meat of the review (literally)

Service: 
Top notch.  Friendly and attentive. My water glass was never half empty or half full, it was just full.

Pork buns:
The pork was dry like the Sahara tending closer toward jerky than melt-in-yo-mowf fatty pig. The flavor of the sauce was good, but doesn&#39;t look like the buns themselves are homemade. Could I do better? Actually I could lol and that&#39;s unfortunate.

Spicy pork bone:
I am a huge ramen fan and just fan of food in general. This is exemplified by my triple chin and love handles. This soup should be called chili oil soup topped with ramen, because that&#39;s all I could really taste. However when I could actually get down to the soup base it was quite tasty.  Noodles were great, and ironically the pork here was better.

Dry Ramen:
This was just basically pasta with ramen noodles. A cream based sauce, cheese, uni -- reminiscent of all&#39;onda except they used ramen noodles and a little bit of lettuce.

Side note: 
No clue why people are buying the romaine with garlic and cheese."

This space is modernly designed and with a cozy atmosphere. There several different seating options include bar seating, shared table seating, and smaller table seating. This time I dine alone so I had the fun of seating at the bar facing the kitchen. I always love watching the cooks prepare the dishes as I slurp on my ramen. 

First thing I did notice was that there is no place to hang your jacket on since the seats were backless so you will have to either sit on your jackets or hold them in your lap. My recommendation for Jum-Men would be to incorporate a coat rack or coat hanger. The service was exceptionally friendly and it didn&#39;t hurt that the waitresses were super cute.

I ordered the chicken buns with jalapeno mayo (2 for $8) and the spicy pork bone soup ($14). The chicken buns were quite tasty and there was only a hint of spice from the jalapeno. The ramen broth was good however on the lighter side. So if you like a lighter, milkier broth, you will enjoy this ramen. If you are more accustomed to a thicker and richer Tonkotsu style broth, you may find this one underwhelming. The noodles were of the thin straight style and worked well with the lighter broth. I personally prefer the thick wavy noodles so I hope they can incorporate additional noodle options in the future. At $14 a bowl I expected that they would include at least a couple pieces of char siu but none was to be found. That was a disappointment.

Overall, I would recommend Jun-Men Ramen if you are in Chelsea and can&#39;t make it to one of what I consider the top tier ramen places such as Totto Ramen, Ippudo, Minca, and Kambi Ramen. Also, considering this is in Chelsea the prices are considerably higher however at least they take credit card. Slurp on, my friends!"

It&#39;s a ramen bar; While their ramen is of a good/normal standard, I would say you really should be coming here to try their sweet potato fries.

Their fries was out of this world, they covered the fries with a thin maple syrup butter sauce, and the result was an amazing complimentary flavours; the maple syrup added to the slight sticky gooeyness, while the butter worked to added a hint of caramel to the overall dish.

The dipping sauce combined Japanese Mayo with a unique sweet soy (Japanese style BBQ)  - and it was one of the best Mayo combo I have tried. Worked perfectly wth there fries as a dip.

The combination was soooo unique I would totally recommend coming here to try it out!

For the dine-in experience, my husband enjoyed the BBQ pork bun, and we both really liked the ramen.  I typically like the thicker noodles, but the thinner ramen noodles at Jun-Men worked for me as well.  We also ordered the greentea cheesecake, which I really think they should just take this off the menu.  I seared in my mind that it was a waste of money, it lacked matcha flavor and was plain boring; I rather save my money for a Lady M cake.

For my take-out experience, I ordered pork ramen with no green onions and requested that the egg be cooked all the way through because I can&#39;t have eggs with runny yolks.  I ordered online, walked over, waited 5 minutes and walked 5 minutes back to my place.  I have no idea how take-out is for other customers who order ramen, but my noodles were stuck together like a brick.  I couldn&#39;t get them to separate.  I actually had to reboil the broth and dump the noodles in and really work with my chopsticks to get them to separate.  So lesson learnt - not exactly take-out friendly.  Also my egg was cooked mostly through, but not all the way through --- just a note, not a big deal.  Overall, the ramen still hit the spot after I worked some magic."

The wait at 7:30pm was about 30 minutes (Thursday evening) - it was freezing outside, so I&#39;m sure many people stayed home.  They take your name, # in your party, and phone number and are very prompt about calling you when your table is ready.  There&#39;s not really much space for you to wait, especially if it&#39;s cold outside, so they recommend going next door to Pushcart Coffee (doesn&#39;t seem like they mind, but I would at least look at the menu).

The space is modern, but there really isn&#39;t that much seating space.  Theres about 3 spaces near the register, a few that face the kitchen, some double tables along the window, and a large shared table in the middle.  

My visitor from the UK and I shared the yellowtail ceviche to start.  The sauce that comes with it is definitely a strong, pungent, sour, sauce.  I didn&#39;t fancy it by itself, but it goes well with the thick piece of raw yellowtail (4 pieces total).  There&#39;s some diced mango and crunchiness that comes with it.   Good stuff.

I almost always go for a spicy tonkotsu at every ramen place if they serve it and this was no exception.  I got the spicy pork bone ramen.  It was delicious!  Jun-Men Ramen Bar has got to be one of the top 3 places I&#39;ve had ramen in NYC.  It wasn&#39;t too salty or too thick, yet the broth was very creamy and flavorful.  There was a mild heat to the spiciness that didn&#39;t take over the flavor of the broth.  I wish it was a tad bit spicy, though.  The meat was thick and not too fatty.  Egg comes standard, which was a surprise since I feel like most places charge up the behind for an egg nowadays.  The noodles were thin and al dente - perfect consistency.

Nothing beats a rich broth of ramen on a snowy day. It was heavily snowing when I visited Jun-Men Ramen Bar, and a friend of mine wanted to have a ramen to cure hangover from last night. Jun-Men has been on my radar for a while now, and I finally made a visit for a late lunch.

The menu consists of small bites and ramen dishes. I usually eat pork when it comes to meat bun (ever since I fell in love with Momofuku&#39;s pork buns), but Jun-Men also offered one with chicken kara-age. It came with lettuce and jalapeno mayo and was a very good bite. Fried sweet potatoes with umami mayo were also nice starter without too much sweetness going on. The ramen at Jun-Men that everyone seems to be talking about is the one with spicy pork bone broth. It was indeed an excellent ramen with rich and aromatic flavor of the broth that was just melting my heart on a cold day. The noodles had the right amount of firmness in texture as well. I really do think this ramen deserves a bit more attention in this ramen-crazed city, right up there with long-standing institutions like Toto and Ippudo.

The restaurant doesn&#39;t take any reservations and the dining space is relatively small, so show up early or at odd hours like late afternoon (the restaurant does close at 3 until re-opening at 5). There were some sake and beer selections to complement your meal. There are more and more ramen shop openings in the city these days, and Jun-Men is definitely a place you&#39;d want to visit for that rich, decadent broth of pork bone ramen."

Uni mushroom mazemen (dry &#34;ramen&#34;): truly memorable. I know... $18 is pricey, but you won&#39;t believe how good this is.

First off I do not eat pork. All the other ramens had clear signs of pork either in the title or in the ingredient but only in my spicy miso it was written as Chasu or some Japanese word, there was no way I could see if there was pork. (Of course unless they claim any ramen eaters should learn Japanese before eating ramen).

Despite this, she&#39;s not the type to crave ramen, even during the winter, so I was shocked when she told me that we were going to have ramen for dinner. 

Not surprisingly, she said that she really came here for the chicken buns and for the dry ramen. We did indeed order those 2 items, along with the spicy miso ramen. The spicy miso ramen is good, but after having Ichiran in Japan, no other soup ramen compares, although she did say that she preferred this soup over both Totto Ramen and Ippudo. It had the right amount of spice as she kept slurping away. The egg was also perfectly cooked with the runny yolk - an epitome of how all eggs should be served. However, we weren&#39;t fans of the pork since there wasn&#39;t much meat but rather it was all fat, making it unappetizing to eat (although admittingly, most pork are fatty).

On the other hand, I wasn&#39;t expecting to like the dry ramen as it sounded and smelled so cheesy (I&#39;m not a cheese fan at all), but surprisingly, I loved this dish. It wasn&#39;t too cheesy or creamy and had a great flavor dimension. I would order this the next time for myself instead along with the chicken bun. The chicken bun was so good and juicy that it actually a bit messy to eat. The bun was soft as well!

I enjoyed my kimchi ramen.  My vegetarian friend was surprised that there were no vegetarian ramen options, which seems unusual in NY and particularly in Chelsea!  She got the uni mushroom (without pancetta) instead of ramen.  Honestly, I think it was the more unique and special dish than the ramen itself!"

Naw, too lazy. 

Let&#39;s be real, we all came for one dish:

- UNI MUSHROOM Uni, roasted pancetta, porcini butter, truffle oil, fried shallots, scallion, Parmesan cheese $18

I&#39;m all for bold flavors, but at some point too much is too much when strong flavors start to work against each other. After a few bites the dish starts to taste like a bowl of heavy cream (which it pretty much is). I&#39;d take out the Parmesan to give the uni more of a clean taste. I&#39;d also suggest that porcini butter be removed as to let the mushrooms themselves shine through. 

Was it good? Sure, but I can&#39;t come back again and again if I feel like I just ate a huge bowl of heartattack."

OMG! I typically would wait, try 2-3 of the ramen dishes and then decide to review, but this dish is SO good I can&#39;t wait. 

Ive only had this one dish and it is SO worth the $18, do not let that dissuade you! Ive been to the oh so popular Momofuku in NYC and to far too many ramen bars to count/name, but this truly was an unexpected surprise!! Walked in expecting basic ramen, and left tempted to return the following day! 

I will def. return and try the Spicy Miso Ramen (my usual go-to) but till then, I say take a chance on the broth-less UNI MUSHROOM. DO IT. JUST STOP READING AND ORDER IT. 

You are very welcome.

TL; DR: Did they beat my eight-years running favorite ramen joint in the city?  No.  Would I call it a destination spot?  If no longer than a 20-minute train ride....possibly.  Would I haul multiple avenues/streets on foot if I was with someone who had a hankering for ramen?  In a heartbeat.

Nice welcome from the bartender when I arrived.  Seating wasn&#39;t the most comfortable, but also less cramped than it first appeared to be.  Very clean, modern design to the place, allowing it to function and flow well.  

Servers were super nice (and cute, to boot!), nailing when we wanted something asap, while knowing when to let us relax.  Very soft, respectable upsells with drink refills and dessert offering, while humbly accepting our &#34;no, thanks&#34;.

The herbal beer is very interesting.......

The Ginger Lime Saki drink was quite refreshing.

I could make a meal out of 2-3 orders of those chicken buns alone!  Ad I&#39;m - generally - not the hugest fan of this type of dish.  DAMN, Y&#39;ALL! SOOOO GOOOD!!!!

The Tuna Poke was nice, light, filling enough, and such a clean dish across the entire palate.  We were big fans!

Spicy Porn Ramen was awesome, mostly because of the broth.  SUCH good broth!  No real spice (to my palate)...and really prefer thicker, wavy noodle...but understand why they went for the thin, straight variety, as the broth is quick delicate, though complex.  It did get a bit salty the more you sipped the broth....though never when paired with the ingredients.  So I&#39;d definitely recommend getting your kaedama ON!

The Uni and mushroom was a visual and ole factory feast from the minute it hit the table.  Tried everything without the uni....then tasted the uni to ensure freshness (it was GAWGEOUS), then mixed it all together.  THAT was the kicker!  This dish is created to have all ingredients marry.  True perfection!

I will be back!"

Upon arriving around 8:00 PM on a Friday, there was about a 20 minute wait, but note it is small so the wait is outside! 

FOOD: I got the chicken wings and the spicy pork bone ramen with extra chashu. I liked the wings as I could tell they were fried pretty well. The sauce has rice wine and soy, which is always a win. Next came the ramen, the star, but I guess I was slightly disappointed. The pork was a bit over cooked, so the meat came out a little dry. I&#39;m also a stickler for my egg since I love me a soft boiled egg, but upon eating it, it was more of a hard boiled egg. The noodles were good, but again, a little on the over side so it did not have that right texture I am always looking for. And finally the broth. I read other people&#39;s reviews here about the salt and I would concur. I sadly did not end up finishing the broth due to the salt content. 

SERVICE: I&#39;m usually not a stickler for service, but this time I felt it was a big miss. The man next to me ordered at the same time yet my food showed up 15 minutes after him and we ordered pretty much the same thing. Sitting at the bar, I saw my wings sitting there not plated. Unfortunately, when brought to me were not as warm as I&#39;d hope. Also, the ramen came quickly after the wings. So by the time I finished the wings, my ramen was already a little cold and contributed to the overcooked food. Sad. 

Overall, I found this place to cater to more of a fusion cuisine, with sweet potato fries to ramen to chicken wings. It&#39;s not bad, but maybe my service experience is what led me to my unfortunate disappointing review."

Dessert!  That Green Tea Creme Brulee was so smooth and creamy.  The green tea flavor was so deliciously strong and present.

Service was simply the best.  Our waters were always full.  The server always made sure we had extra plates or napkins or anything we needed."

Topped with roasted pancetta, fried shallots, scallions and UNI!!!! I love the chewy wavy thick noodles. The best thing on the menu. 

Also liked the pork bone ramen (this comes with thin noodles, which is just ok to me) but Mu Ramen still wins in this case. You DO get 3 pieces of that pork though. MMMMMM delicious fat. 

The BBQ pork buns were great, although at $9 for 2 it seems a bit overpriced. I did, however, preferred them over the chicken buns which were a bit on the dry side. 

Didn&#39;t like the gelato trio, it was just too ordinary. 

Will definitely come back again! 

Tips: 
- Sit at the bar
- Expect a wait (or come by yourself!) because this joint is tiny (but homey) 
- There&#39;s one waiting bench outside, no waiting space inside 
- Bring your own bag hook cause there isn&#39;t any at the bar"

It is above average as the broth is rich and not too salty. However, it isn&#39;t really spicy and misses on the depth part. The char chu that comes isn&#39;t really charred/grilled like ippudo, which I prefer. It is just plain white (literally) braised. The noodles also did not stand out. The portion is good for $14 but I would probably not come back for it. (I don&#39;t like uni, so their other option doesn&#39;t appeal to me either)

The kimchi fried rice, on the other hand, did stand out as an appetizer for a ramen restaurant. At $9, the portion and value is defintely better than the pork/chicken bun. My friends and  I thorough enjoyed this one."

The restaurant is fairly small, so plan ahead if you have a large party. Overall, we were stuffed after finishing almost all of the dishes mentioned below and enjoyed the intimate, hipster vibe of the restaurant.

Pork buns (2 buns per order) - fairly standard, the pork had a mild flavor and oddly had a bit of a gamy taste. 

Fried chicken bun (2 buns per order) - crispy chicken, not greasy, and tasted as you would expect. 

Pork bone ramen - noodles were thinner than typical ramen noodles (not sure if that was 
supposed to happen or it was just the batch of noodles we received), flavorful broth but the pork belly had very limited meat.

Spicy pork bone ramen - mild spiciness with the standard &#39;wavy&#39; noodles - confirmed with the waitress that these noodles are not made in-house but rather purchased &#39;fresh&#39; not dried from  a producer. Similar to the pork bone ramen, the pork belly was fairly fatty and gelatinous, but I think that&#39;s part of the allure of this cut of meat.

Extra noodles - $2, healthy portion that two people can easily share

Green tea cheesecake (2 mini slice per order) - hard pass.. very chalky and not appetizing. 

Cucumber ginger soju - comes in a cute retro glass mini-milk bottle, very heavy on the cucumber with lots of little bits that sink to the bottom of the glass"

As I was seated at one of the three bar seats looked over by the bartender, I made sure not to let him see I was checking in on Yelp just to make sure I didn&#39;t get any boogers or other unwanted stuff in my ramen (super topical South Park reference!).

Since I was by myself, I kept it pretty tame and just got two starters and one bowl of ramen:

- Chicken Buns ($8 for 2)
These were excellent. Served in the familiar bao bread that most ramen joints normally have for pork buns, the thin, crispy pieces of chicken were delicious in the soft bread that was slathered in jalape√±o mayo. Definitely start with some buns, also available with Pork or BBQ Pork.

- Jun-Men Fried Rice ($10)
Another incredibly satisfying starter, this large portion of fried rice consisted of Chinese sausage, kimchi, tobiko, and a fried egg on top. It was definitely on the spicier side, perhaps from the kimchi, and was easy to get through the whole bowl before realizing how much I inhaled since it was so good.

- Uni Mushroom Mazemen ($18)
This is the bowl everybody is talking about and getting here, and it&#39;s with good reason. As it is a Mazemen, there is no broth, and it instead consists of some super chewy wavy noodles in a porcini butter and truffle oil sauce, topped with roasted pancetta, fried shallots, scallions and a good portion of Uni (if you aren&#39;t a fan of Uni, I overheard the guy happily offering to make the bowl without it). With or without Uni, this bowl is incredible and definitely worth a try for some of the best noodles I&#39;ve had at a ramen joint in awhile.

- Green Tea Cheesecake ($8)
This was the only misfire. Served in two little slices topped with what seemed to be red bean paste, which is usually way too mild and lacking in flavor for me, the consistency of the matcha cheesecake was super chalky. It crumbled apart as I dug into it, which is pretty much the opposite consistency you would expect. If you want something sweet, perhaps go with the gelato instead which is likely better.

There is a larger communal table in the center, along with a few two tops along the side of the restaurant, but it&#39;s still a pretty small place, and I can imagine will start getting more crowded very soon once word gets out about how good the ramen is and more and more people post that beautiful Uni Mushroom Mazemen on Instagram (guilty). I definitely need to come back for more buns, some fried sweet potatoes, and a bowl of the actual ramen to try some broth with the excellent noodles."

It doesn&#39;t have the traditional soup broth, which I would argue is usually the best part, but this dish is what makes Jun-Men stand out from other ramen joints. The truffle oil and uni add a nice creamy and rich texture to the noodles! Make sure you mix well though, otherwise the bottom of the bowl will be disproportionally salty.

I tried the BBQ pork buns, the spicy pork bone ramen, and the green tea cheesecake. While the pork buns and ramen were really tasty and authentic, at the end of the day, I can&#39;t help but think that they just tasted like a less awesome version of Ippudo. The green tea cheesecake was definitely more cheesy than matcha-y. I love cheesecake, so I didn&#39;t mind too much, but if you order it, just make sure you&#39;re not expecting a Lady M cake. 

The service was a bit messy at times. Our server literally forgot that she was our server and blamed another server for forgetting to put down our dessert order...

Tldr: come here for the Uni ramen, you can get better versions of other items on the menu elsewhere."

-Yellowtail ceviche- 5 pieces of yellowtail. Pickled mango was pretty good. Sauce was okay. Felt like the dish wasn&#39;t very composed. I ended up eating all the ingredients separately 

-Uni mazeman- ugh so sad. This should be renamed mushroom mazeman with one piece of tiny uni. The uni wasn&#39;t fresh and the dish was very greasy. There was a lot of mushroom in the dish. The pancetta was super fried. So disappointed. 

-Pork bone ramen with the spicy sauce on the side- the soup was very good. It had a strong pork bone taste but wasn&#39;t as salty as other ramen places. However, the pork wasn&#39;t juicy and was even a little dry. 

We left the restaurant pretty full but was disappointed in the quality and taste of the dishes."

Four Stars

A great addition to the Ramen community, jun men is small noodle shop on 9th and 25th. There was 20-25 minute wait for two of us. So we headed to Pushcart Coffee next door and waited with a cold brew. We sat in the corner. The Caucasian waitresses were nice and knowledgeable. We split the Pork Bao ($9) and Chicken Bao ($8). The two pieces of pork belly were fatty with a light blowtorch sear. The rice flour bun was fluffy, doughy, and delicious. The Hoisin sauce was sweet and salty. The cucumber added a much needed freshness. It needed another element like rock sugar, peanuts, or somethings else crunchy. The chicken was unevenly distributed. One bao had a big piece and other had a small one. This Chinese Chic-Fil-A taco was delicious. The crunchy, tender chicken combined with a spicy creamy mayo and lettuce was perfect. 

The tonkotsu ramen with extra noodles ($16 Total) was good. The broth was fatty, unctuous, with a mild level of salt. The noodles were a bit overcooked. The two thick slices of pork were the same as the buns. The bamboo shoots were house cured. They were salty and chewy but in a good way. The woodear mushrooms and scallions were simple yet complementary addition. The soft boiled egg was a homerun. The creamy yolk was exactly the way it should be. 

The service was a bit slow since the place was packed. They only have sriracha as hot sauce. They also ran out of soup spoons. I am sure they will get better with time."

Fried sweet potatoes with umami mayo $6
The dollop of miso adds flavor and creaminess. Add in cabbage mushrooms egg &amp; pork belly.  It&#39;s  the first time i enjoyed the egg in my ramen. Food is shot out of the open kitchen at lightening speed. They want the food to table ASAP!
The sweet fries with maple bourbon butter were dissapointing only because the menu says sweet potato and I thought they would be thick cut numbers ultimately, though the fries were delish!"

Jun-Men is a pretty small shop with limited seatings so I bet this place is packed during rush hours. The menu had a few variety of ramen to choose from so I am sure you can find something.

I ordered the spicy pork ramen while my friend had the spicy miso ramen. My ramen had the thin noodles with thin slices of pork in the broth. I love thin noodles so this was perfect. In addition, the broth was so good and not super salty like many ramen places. I was happily full at the end of the meal. The spicy miso ramen is another spicy broth if you are looking for another spicy option. The noodle in that bowl was thicker and looked similar to most ramen noodles. My friend enjoyed the meal which he also left happily afterwards. The staff was so nice here which made the experience enjoyable. Come check out this place if you&#39;re in the area!"

I think it was probably a mistake not trying the uni ramen, but what I can do-need broth with my noodles. I was really excited about this place but unfortunately it didn&#39;t really measure up. I ordered the spicy pork bone. The first couple of bites were refreshing: I appreciated the classic mixture of pork, noodles, bamboo shoots, and seaweed. Towards the end of my bowl though, I found it very hard to finish and the whole became overwhelming rather than light. I think the main problem can be attributed to the pork: it was just a tad bit too fatty and there was just too much of it. Normally you probably don&#39;t hear anyone complaining about too much meat, but I just felt like the protein vs. other ingredients balance was off and therefore became completely overwhelming. I also didn&#39;t like how there was a raw dollop of spicy sauce on top of everything-I prefer it mixed in. 

Other than the food, service was quick and efficient. The space is very small (prepare to sit right next to your fellow customers) but there wasn&#39;t really a line (went for lunch around 1 pm on a Saturday). I think I would come back if in the area just to try the uni ramen, but personally don&#39;t think this is the place for a good, classic bowl of ramen."

I was drinking with some friends at the Tippler and not interested in traveling a huge distance...  A quick yelp search led me to Jun-Men.   A quick walk up 9th and we found Jun-Men.  Interestingly I have walked by here a bunch of times without noticing it before. 

A buddy and I walked in and we were immediately seated at the bar.  We were able to watch the preparation of all of food.  The cook was preparing some pork buns.  We immediately decided we needed to order a chicken and pork bun.  We also ordered the pork ramen and spicy miso ramen.  (we wanted the uni mushroom but they were out of it!!)  We also each got an Orion.  

The pork bun was delicious.  Fatty pork, hoisin sauce, and pickled cucumber.  Pretty standard but well balanced.  The chicken bun was also tasty.  Spicy mayo, fried chicken, lettuce.  It could have used a bit more salt.

Both ramen were also quite tasty.  The spicy miso had just a hint of spice. (IMHO it needed much more spice to be considered &#34;spicy&#34;)  Deep umami flavor, perfectly cooked egg, huge chunks of tender pork, al dente noodles.  A very solid showing.  I wouldn&#39;t say this is Ippudo level ramen, but solid nevertheless.  I actually preferred the pork ramen.  It was ramen done right.  

The restaurant is bright and clean and they played an awesome eclectic mix of music.  The waitstaff were friendly and efficient.  

Price per person for 1 beer, 1 order of buns, and 1 ramen with tax and tip was about $40.  A bit pricey for what you get (even in Manhattan).  If it was about $10 cheaper it was be on point.  Overall I would recommend this place and I will certainly be back!"

Food:
Chicken Wings - A ton of flavor and was fried to perfection. 
Spicy Pork Bone Ramen - By far the best ramen Ive had in NY, better than ippudo and totto ramen. The broth is what made this the best. Out of all the other ramen, I actually finished drinking the broth. It includes an egg and chashu which other places charge you extra for. Price is about average for a city ramen joint.

Drinks:
Orion beer - A bit pricy for what tastes like the bud light of japanese beers.

Atmosphere:
A small trendy ramen bar that you can take a date to or swing by with friends. Reminds me of another ramen shop in LIC called Mu Ramen (best ramen in Queens). Very casual atmosphere.

Service:
The waitress was very attentive, no abnormally long wait for ordering. She kept our water filled at all times. 

Conclusion:
Will definitely come again, only downside is that its in Chelsea which we rarely make it out there as we usually stay on the east side (closer to queens)."

I came across Jun-Men Ramen randomly on Yelp one day and was intrigued in their uni mushroom. After my vacation to Japan, I fell in love with uni and often find myself longing for more. After reading how ridiculous the wait can be here (1 hour +), I knew Jun-Men Ramen had to be an early weekend spot. So, my boyfriend and I arrived 5-10 minutes past 5 and were shocked at how empty the restaurant was. Don&#39;t be fooled though - by the time it hit 5:30, the entire restaurant was filled and there were plenty of people waiting outside for a table. That&#39;s also due to the venue being extremely small, so come with a small party of 4 or less! 

Hearing great things about their buns, especially their chicken, my boyfriend and I started with these as an appetizer. Aside from serving the standard pork bun that almost all ramen shops serve, Jun-Men Ramen gets extra brownie points for having other buns such as the chicken bun, BBQ pork bun, and a shiitake bun. But OMG, the chicken bun was SO good. Seriously one of the best fried chicken pieces I&#39;ve had! A fellow Yelper compared the chicken bun to Chik-a-fila, in which I can see the connection with that sauce. The chicken was so juicy and the spicy jalape√±o mayo sauce complimented it so well. It could have used a little less sauce as the sauce was dipping out of the bun. Beware, the spicy jalape√±o mayo is pretty spicy, so ask for less of it if you can&#39;t handle spicy. The lettuce provided a great crunch to the bun as well, but honestly it could have done well without the lettuce. I overheard the table next to us wanting to order the pork bun, but after the woman saw our chicken bun, she immediately changed her mind and ordered this instead. 

For our ramen entrees, we shared the spicy miso and the uni mushroom. The broth in the spicy miso was really good as I kept drinking spoonful after spoonful. Loved how it wasn&#39;t too salty as well. I would say that their broth is better than Totto Ramen and Ippudo. Jun-Men Ramen also distinguishes itself from the other ramen spots by providing an ample amount of bamboo and wood ear mushrooms. Where this dish falls for me though is their chashu - it was WAY too fatty for me and my boyfriend&#39;s liking. It was legitimately all fat, so if you enjoy your pork that fatty, you won&#39;t have a problem here. The uni mushroom was really good and definitely met my expectations. First off, it&#39;s totally photographable and just stunning to look at. With its description of uni, roasted pancetta, porcini butter, truffle oil, fried shallots, scallion, and Parmesan cheese, this dish sounds super heavy and cheesy; even when it arrived it looked and smelled heavy and cheesy. However, I was pleasantly surprised after taking a bite and it wasn&#39;t overwhelming! Each bite was amazing as there was plenty of mushrooms and pancetta to go around. The pancetta was fried to perfection and provided the texture that this dish needed. Also love that there were plenty of pieces of uni! At $18, you would hope you get a decent amount. I just wish the uni was fresher as it wasn&#39;t one of the better uni I&#39;ve had. 

Jun-Men Ramen is good and all, but it&#39;s not worth waiting over an hour for. Come early to experience challenging the status quo ramen! And ORDER THE CHICKEN BUN! That&#39;s the real star dish of the place. You&#39;ll thank me after."

I entered the chic establishment but felt more comfortable being seated at the bar. The area is tiny, but it is set up so that it feels spacious. I was really hungry, and despite this was still overwhelmed by the portion of the ramen. I ended up slowing down 2/3 of the way through. The broth is sweet and spicy, although I prefer to have more veggies in mine the ramen itself hit the spot. Not many beyond Totto Ramen can satisfy my fix for the creamy broth, but this joint served it up quite nicely. Was half full at 9pm on a weekday and the waitstaff is very accommodating. I would definitely return, but would request the broth to be extra spicy. Glad to know that a delicious ramen joint is in the lower Manhattan area."

In short: it was great all around...food,service,pricing,decor.

We were so hungry and ordered the following:

Yellowtail Ceviche-really great starter. It was a nice twist from the traditional ceviche.

Chicken Kara-Age: very crispy and delicious

Sweet Potato Fries w/ Bourbon Maple Butter: OMG...we sat on the counter and could not help but notice that people were ordering this thing to go because they were sooo good!!

Pork Bone Ramen: very comforting, nice broth, great portion.

Uni Mazemen: Wow!! This was like if you put Italy, Great Uni, Japanese and Korea..served in a bowl! It was amazing!

The mazeman looks so pretty, how can I not order it? Was it worth the 18 bucks I shelled out for that sweet sweet uni and truffle oil? I finished it and try to inconspicuously lick the bowl so it must be! It is definitely an indulgence though so wait for a special day or split it with someone and order some appetizers to share. It is very savory with the butter so don&#39;t overdo it by ordering too much other things (like I did!)

The fried sweet potatoes is very decadent and I wish I save that for dessert but it is equally good for an appetizer. 

The fried chicken buns have very crispy but tender chicken but bit heavy handed on the sauce. Ask for it on the side as I saw someone smartly do after I already devoured mine and looked like a toddler who haven&#39;t figured out how to use utensils. 

So as you can see, my theme of ordering fried all the thing worked. just not for my overstuffed but happy stomach."

Not bad, but felt off kilter.  Was also not a fan of the bad EDM blasting out of the speakers, but since I was more than ready to sample a new ramen joint promising a 4 star Yelp experience, I was ready to ignore it, and just get to the food.

Once inside (yes, there&#39;s a wait, as with every other ramen place, and while we should have been seated 15 minutes before we actually were - long story, but a single guest should not have been seated at the equivalent of a 2 top where a single seat was available at the bar), we quickly ordered up an order of fried wings, a spicy pork ramen for my friend,  as well as a dry ramen featuring uni, pancetta, mushrooms, and parm for me. 

The $18 dry ramen, which seems to be one of the stars of this place, was good but not amazing. Thu uni felt like a gimmick more than anything. Honestly, there was a bit too much going on with my ramen.   A bit like carbonara, with a creamy consistency, the pancetta, truffle, mushroom, and buttered pasta overwhelmed what was there of the uni.  In my mind, uni is a sacred ingredient which is best prepared in simple combinations.  The best iterations in my mind, is Alex Raij&#39;s deceptively delicious uni Panini, or the egg on egg on egg dish at Sakamai.  The fried chicken was good but expensive. It was very close to a Bonchon Korean style wing, but really not that unique.  Also, $9.95 at Bonchon buys you 8 wings, and $9 at Jun men buys you only 4.  

All in all, not a bad experience, but a bit of a letdown, and probably will not return."

Mediocre ramen. The price is equal to Ippudo on the west side. The taste not so much.

I ordered the pork bone ramen. The chasu was too dry and not really tender, a bit chewy. Not too much flavor in the pork bone broth either. Typical ramen noodles. The black oil was interesting but it didn&#39;t really boost the flavor of the broth. I didn&#39;t even bother with the broth after I finished the noodles. There&#39;s only half an egg. For $14 a bowl, we should get an entire egg.

I had the BBQ pork buns as an appetizer. Again, the pork belly was too dry and not as tender as it can be. The BBQ and the mayo was too over powering, didn&#39;t really taste the pork.

And finally matcha cheese cake as desert. I probably enjoyed this the most. It was good flavor and not too sweet. It&#39;s was a bit crumbly but not overly dry. 

You&#39;re not missing a whole lot. I might try their other stuff eventually but I&#39;m not in a hurry to go back any time soon."

Been there 2x now, close to work and if you get there before the lunch crowd, guarantee a seat.  Very small location, simple decor, solo dining - at the bar area - great option. 

1st visit - Pork belly buns with pickle, not a good combo - pork belly were WAAAY too fatty! The beige coloring didn&#39;t help the thick chunk of pure fat glaring at me.  I prefer the traditional pork belly bun - either torched (like TOTTO) or braised to perfection (like Ippudo).  The pickle added no value whatsoever.  I took mine out. 

Kimchi Ramen - this was good, mildly spicy, with braised pork shoulder meat pieces and minced-like Kim Chi (which I did not like... I rather have big chunks of kimchi, added texture to the ramen).  The broth was good - nothing exceptional. 

2nd visit - Chicken buns (a little over-fried but good when you&#39;re craving a McChicken..), Sweet Potato Fries - these were awesome, it was slightly glazed with simple sugar syrup and served mighty hot with some japanese mayo.  

Wanted to try the uni mazemen, but they were out of uni... yes.. they were out of uni... their most frequently ordered dry ramen... at 11:40am.. they were out of uni.  It is the reason why I&#39;m here so early... Seriously?!?!  Let&#39;s just call it poor &#39;logistics ordering&#39; or planning...  so I opted for the Spicy Miso...  it was bland.. not spicy at all... no miso taste.. the pork belly were not edible.. again, mighty THICK chunk of PURE FAT floating on top of my ramen...  I ate around it.   

Overall, a decent ramen joint...  I would not wait in line for this... but would eat a quick meal here."

One of my biggest complaints about the menu is that there are no non-pork alternatives for Rahman. Not even Chicken. I ordered the spicy pork Ramen and found the flavor profile to be quite rich. However spicy it was not. It also contained a lot of very fatty cuts of pork which I did not find appetizing. The noodles themselves were OK but not fantastic.

Had never heard about Jun-Men Ramen Bar prior to going, but went with a friend per her recommendation. It&#39;s a great place for a casual lunch or dinner with a friend or date. The first thing that I noticed about the Pork Buns were how soft and airy they were and how much meat was stuffed within. Each bite felt light yet incredibly flavorful at the same time.

The Spicy Miso Ramen was SO GOOD. I loved how al dente the noodles were and the broth was perfect. I asked for the spicy paste on the side as I&#39;m a bit of a wuss when it comes to hot flavors. 

Finally, the green tea cheesecake... beautifully light with just the right amount of matcha. It was so delicious, I had to ask the waitress about it. It&#39;s not made in-house, but she wasn&#39;t sure where they sourced it from. :( I&#39;m going to keep going and asking, because I need to know!"

The hubs and I came here for an early lunch, and we tried the following: Pork Bun (filled with super juicy/tender/fatty pork belly, pickled cucumber, and hoisin sauce - these were super juicy and tasty, and really focused on the pork belly themselves - very lightly seasoned and not overdone); the Chicken Wings (4 pieces, double-fried, and glazed with Jun-Men sauce; these were finger-licking good!  It was a perfect glaze with a hint of pepper, causing a thin crispy exterior of the juicy wings - these were super tasty!); Jun-Men Fried Rice (fried rice with Chinese sausage chunks, kimchi, a sunny-side up egg, tobiko, and micro basil, this was a yummy fried rice dish - not too salty and filled with well-fermented bits of kimchi; the runny egg was a nice touch, and the Chinese sausage didn&#39;t really freak me out that much :P and, an order of the Uni Mushroom ramen (this is actually a no-broth ramen, with roasted pancetta, porcini butter, truffle oil, fried shallots, scallion, and Parmesan cheese, all topped with a generous portion of uni - this literally tasted like a Japanese version of pasta, as the ramen noodles were cooked perfectly al dente and coated with a creamy cheesy sauce.

I was glad I took my sister here when she visited New York one day recently. She&#39;s pretty picky when it comes to ramen, and said it was good. 

It&#39;s a pretty small shop with some counter seats facing the kitchen, a communal table, a couple of tables, and another counter that faces the side. 

The teriyaki pork buns we shared were wrapped in fluffy buns and had nice flavor, but the pork pieces were a little too dry for my liking. I&#39;d maybe pass on these.

My sister ordered the spicy miso ramen. It was a little one-note, but the noodles were cooked to a toothsome and there was a lot of ramen. She actually enjoyed it quite a bit. The spiciness was there for us, and was great for a cold day. 

I ordered the popular uni mushroom mazemen, and it was everything I had been hoping for. The wavy ramen noodles in dashi coupled with umami components like uni, cheese, mushroom, and bacon made for a really, really creative dish that was very, very delicious. It was similar to a carbonara, but not as heavy. The uni pieces were fresh and bright, and the entire mazemen portion was just right. I&#39;ve had creamy carbonara-like mazemen dishes at other places, and this one was my favorite by far.

I&#39;d love to try their uni mushroom mazemen again. It&#39;d be nice if they could introduce other mazemen combinations as well."

The broth is wholesome without being oily, and with a medium amount of spice. The chashu is some of the best I&#39;ve had with ramen, with multiple delicately soft slices that also include strips of fat. Memna and cabbage offer a crunch and contrasting texture to the soft noodles.

It&#39;s $18, so a little more on the pricy side, but truth be told I think it&#39;s very well worth. The noodles are slightly thicker than normal noodles, which is probably why I liked it more.

I&#39;m really looking forward to coming back for the uni mushroom ramen because it sounds indulgent in all the right ways.

When you walk in you almost assume it&#39;s going to be a fast-casual type place, but it&#39;s not.  That being said, all of our servers were super attentive and very warm, which helped to make the experience really pleasant."

I absolutely love their Uni Mushroom that is not the traditional ramen that we used to see in other restaurant. It&#39;s their only dry ramen and they cook it with roasted pancetta, porcini butter, truffle oil, fried shallot scallion and parmesan cheese... all kind of ingredients we usually find for good Italian pasta! So they can&#39;t go wrong in terms of flavor!

I also recommend their fried sweet potatoes that comes with a mayonnaise. Their pork buns and chicken wings are really delicious too! 

The restaurant is really small but the service is great.

Jun-Men is one of my top ramen restaurant."

Tiny little place but very friendly and efficient . Put your names down and wait outside or they call you , Ramen lovers you know the routine .

Luckily we got to sit by the chefs hard at work which makes me salivate every time !

The spicy miso isn&#39;t actually that spicy so had to ask for extra to give it some zing .

The regular pork ramen is a winner in my books , the pork and depth of the broth really do jump out and bite you . Love it .

Pork buns need some work  if you want to compete with Ippudo or have they just set the bar too high .

We came for their lunch specials, where the personal pizza (12&#39;&#39;) ranged from $10 - $16 and their entree dishes were $9. I ordered the eggplant parm with penne and it did not disappoint. I also tasted a slice of the vodka pizza and it was delicious. The crust was nice and crispy too!

He was a charming guy telling us about how the neighborhood in this area is changing and how they want to offer the best of the best to the people - even sharing about what upcoming events they have soon.  The food was awesome as well.  I had the Bucatini mushroom sauce for only $7 for lunch- it was really creamy and it looked small but super filling!  Yum.  It actually tasted like a creamy mushroom udon from an asian restaurant.  I understand why there&#39;s so many high ratings here.  Great experience, great food, great price!.

The room is warm, with a modern, yet familiar vibe. There&#39;s a bar with my favorite cider, Original Sin along with the normal brews - but try Staten Island draught, Flagship&#39;s Summer Past Time Ale. 
The pizzas are amazing. We had the white pie (It was my first ever and didn&#39;t disappoint), supreme (which was loaded with toppings) and a clam pie which had Grande Mozzarella - a creamy cheese that my favorite locals use too. 

All in all, if this place is any indication of the gentrification and new offerings coming to Staten, rents are going to be going up very soon."

The pasta was aldente and the pizza was very thin. Everything tasted fresh. It&#39;s not too busy like most places in Staten Island on a Friday night. The only thing this place falls short on is organizations. The waiters seem to get confused when it comes to who ordered what. They also have a small shortage of waiters. It&#39;s seems that they only have 2 waiters. Overall this place is good.

Between the 4 of us we had 2 appetizers (the Blistered Peppers were a light and tasty treat and the Burrata with Confetti Tomatoes will blow your diet... But is so worth it), Chicken Parmesan which was probably the tenderest we&#39;ve found, Rigatoni Parmesan Tomato Cream (exactly what I&#39;d hoped for), Bucatini with Wild Mushrooms... Delicious... And just when I was congratulating myself for leaving a few tubes of pasta in my bowl... Out came the little mini Zeppoles and I was undone! Best I have ever had!

We went to the newly opened Errigos last weekend for Mother&#39;s Day-
The food was amazing!
For starters we had burrata with tomato, a fresh raw kale salad with ricotta salata and calamari-all were perfection!
My dining companion had the chicken with artichoke, the mother had pasta with broccoli rabe and sausage and I the basic chicken parm. What can I say...I love me some chicken parm!!!
All were fresh and delicious-and bountiful portions!
The bar-
The strawberry mojitos were absolutely amazing and beautifully presented and dessert---though basic was scrumptious!
Even though packed, service (the one server and bartender) was very attentive, overly friendly and made the meal memorable. The owner stopped out and was gracious and equally wonderful. He was cooking that day as the chef was out I&#39;ll so lucky for us we had the owner doing the cooking!
From what I heard they will have an outdoor area with a private fire pit our back-awesome.
We are in love!

And damn we were really looking forward to this steak on the strength a few excellent past experiences (awe, they regrammed one of us once, yay!) and it was just bad, sad, not cooked as requested and drowned (as served, not by us) in stale lard.

I&#39;m not a frequent Williamsburg diner but my husband said this is the usual vibe for the area. They had booths and regular seating in the back.

Our waiter was very nice. No complaints at all. I had ordered an ice tea thinking it was sweetened already...but it wasn&#39;t.  Not to worry because the waiter brought out sugar, sugar syrup and even honey. It&#39;s tye little things that make me smile.

We ordered the scallops for appetizers. Although the sauce was amazing enough that you would want to lick the bowl, the scallops were small in size. Did I mention that there were only 3 small size scallops in the big bowl. the carrots and shallots were tasty. If you are going just for taste I would say it was worth the $20  but if you are the type to expect a bigger portion for the amount you paid for, then you might be upset.

We ordered the fried steak which was perfectly crispy. The mash potatoes that it came with was so good with the gravy. The portion was big.

The corn bread was moist, warm and the portion was good.

I normally have dessert because i have a hidden compartment in my belly reserved for sweets. But i was just too full to eat anymore. 

The biscuts were my favorite. It had a hint of sweetness to it. Moist and were a good size.

The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly. 

The meatloaf sandwich was great. Paired with a light bread.

Next we had the Spicy fried duck wings which I had read about previously and omg THEY WERE SO GOOD, the meat fell right off the bone and the sauce made with ground chili, honey, Coca Cola, fried garlic.

They give you both. There is nothing you will want more after having this meal. Aside from the great fried chicken, there is Mac n cheese, mash potatoes and gravy, collard greens, black beans, cole slaw... It is endless. You think you have that extra stomach to pull you through this meal, but it&#39;s almost impossible. It&#39;s too much food but happily accept the challenge. 

Eat here. Period."

Creamy and bubbling, the dish comes to your table in a cast iron pan. I also ordered an entree (which was delicious), but I couldnt get enough of the Mac and cheese. 

Also, the drinks were surprisingly delicious. I had a boozy coffee drink that gave me the perfect buzz. Would definitely recommend coming here. Be prepared to wait, but know that it&#39;s worth it."

My favorite has always been Blue Smoke so i wanted to try some place new. We get there at around 6, before the evening crowd. We stand around waiting 5 minutes, everyone was running around, but being our first time there, we had no idea we had to walk pass the bar to get to the dining area....only until I flagged someone down, that they mentioned that. 

We get seated and ordered:
- corn bread
- meat loaf sandwich
- fried steak
- mac and cheese with bacon

The corn bread was not as buttery as I thought it&#39;ll be, it was bland. 

Meat loaf was just okay, I actually didn&#39;t like the taste of the meat. The chips were really good though

Fried steak, it was my friends dish, he said he enjoyed it

Mac and cheese was a bit bland too, the bits of bacon was hard to find...but bacon tastes good in general

Overall, I would not come back as it is far too get to and Blue Smoke tastes better and true to southern food in my opinion."

Since everyone seems to agree with me here, I&#39;ll just offer up some suggestions: The flapjacks are sinful, and the chicken n waffles are the holy grail of bread + bird. And the cinnamon roll is an absolute must, it&#39;s so sugary and delicious that I walked out with a childlike grin on my face.

Now I just need to go for dinner, where I&#39;m sure everything is just as good."

Thank you for letting me find this place on a random Saturday night. I was in the mood for the best eats in town and this place exceeding my palate&#39;s expectations. Amen!

Suggestions: Everyone at the table order these things and share amongst each other. Portions are generous.

-The Mac and cheese-- probably the best I&#39;ve ever had! baked to perfection, cheesy, and flavorful. You can definitely share this with 2-3 people 
-Spicy Duck wings-- Duck really tasted like a more tender chicken, 7 drumsticks pieces which are huge, the sauce on the wings were mind-blowing (like maybe sweet and sour plus hot sauce?!)
-The biscuits-- 3 in each basket, I usually love Red Lobster&#39;s biscuits (laced with crack), BUT THIS ONE will put Red Lobster&#39;s biscuits to shame. The butter melted on top of the hot biscuits added to the savory taste.
-Meatloaf sandwich--COLOSSIAL in size, had multiple ingredients in the sammich, taste was on point.
-Cornbread with jalape√±os and bacon bits- nice size, amazing when hot and freshly brought to the table.

-The MAC AND CHEESE--oh I&#39;ve already mentioned it already right?? Well worth mentioning again. You can&#39;t go wrong with this and spicy duck wings!

-The kool-aid is also legit! It&#39;s like authentic kool-aid, made by what appears to me by a southern woman named Mabel (or at least it should be because it&#39;s so damn good). We all ordered two, some of us brought shots of bacardi and mixed it!

Bill for 6 people which also included cocktails, the spicy chili (which wasn&#39;t that good so I don&#39;t recommend it), came up to $170!

Follow my suggestions and you can&#39;t go wrong..this place blows minds!"
brooklyn-star-brooklyn,Jordan K.,GkxYeBae9NbGcFnkzu6YoA,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,16,38,TNQfN45N7lyith7NSUgL8w,2.0,2016-09-01,"Two stars is low in my normal standards for a restaurant that I have frequented enough to consider in my top ten of NYC. Why?

Unfortunately, after a couple of recent experiences here, I have a strong criticism after a reasonably bad experience tonight.

We went tonight for happy hour oysters and drinks and it turned into a full-blown dinner; this isn&#39;t unwelcome, but doesn&#39;t happen every day.

So we went as big as we felt necessary for three reasonably frail, hipsterly folks. We ordered the mac and cheese side, the romaine salad and the 33oz T-bone steak, with, as it turned out, the same starters that we ordered to begin with.

That&#39;s not usually a problem, but I really would expect a head&#39;s up from the server that you might be duplicating your order. It was really a poor showing because we waited, then ate, then waited, then ate and by the time the food arrived, we were too full to actually finish the meal, which left everyone in party wary because we were not really made aware of how this would actually go down.

Is it too much to have a server who is able to tell you that you have doubled up on your order? Is it too much to expect a server who is able to give you relatively consistent play-by-plays of how things will be served and not just expect you to know?

So, we felt chagrined and annoyed by the time the actual piece de resistance arrived. We ate, to note, the rare aged steak, which was advised and ordered medium rare. It was delicious, but not to order and, again, badly timed. The balance of the food, including the oysters, was cooked perfectly and really at a good standard of quality for a competitive Brooklyn restaurant scene.

I don&#39;t normally take food to go, but I did tonight because there was so much remaining. Unfortunately, no one asked whether to leave the meat filled T-bone, likely 8 or so ounces of the 33 oz. steak, and because of that, it is now two hours later, I am hungry again, and I do not have the piece of meat that I expected to be saved when we asked them to pack the meal.

I love you guys, but really, these loose ends were too much tonight -- you really do a solid job most all of the time, but this felt wrong and I hope we can continue what has been a good relationship so far."

I was super hungry on a Saturday morning at 1:00 AM and wanted good quality food. I yelped Brooklyn Star at the last minute and decided to give it a try.

Brooklyn Star is located in Williamsburg so the vibe is very hipster, with a rustic ambiance. The lights were dim and we were able to grab a table within 5 minutes. The late night menu consisted of oysters, 6 for $18.00, Country fried steak with mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and various other eats that would make your mouth water! I wanted to try the biscuits first, which were soft, fluffy and absolutely delicious. The mac and cheese was cooked to perfection with a tasty crust on the top...just the way I like it! What I love about this place is that the meals are of large proportions. The country fried steak came with TWO pieces of fried steak and drenched in mashed potatoes. It was absolutely amazing...I also had enough for left overs lol. If you are an oyster fan like myself, you will love the oysters because they are fresh, not overly salty, and delicious. I also wanted to mention that Brooklyn Star serves cherry kool-aide for $1.00!!! I haven&#39;t had kool-aide in such a long time, but I couldn&#39;t resist.

Brooklyn Star is such a great restaurant and I would highly recommend anyone to give them a try, especially if you are in the mood for great food!"

The fried pigtails, bone marrow, Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, collard greens, cornbread, fried duck wings, Brussels sprouts, and was all super delicious. They offered a family style fried chicken dish with 5 options of sides. It was perfect for a group, the chicken and side dishes were phenomenal. Kudos to the chefs!!

The menu is a bit heavy. The only light item is the kale salad, but if you&#39;re looking for something that&#39;s not quite THAT healthy, but also not a heart attack on a plate, you&#39;re out of luck. As someone who doesn&#39;t enjoy things that are that fatty in the morning, this is not necessarily my kind of spot. 

That being said, the biscuits are GREAT. Ex georgia resident here speaking. The flapjacks are really sweet. The roasted grapefruit is really tasty. The sausage is good. I found the little hash brown that came with my order to be repulsively oily."

Little birdies have told me takes of glorious meat loaf sandwiches on fields of house made chips. One the side, lakes of molten mac and cheese are broken up by texas toast islands. I had to finally see for myself.

This is not far from the truth. The truth is this is some really, really good food. I went here for dinner on a Monday whim - as ya do - with my girlfriend in tow. I immediately zeroed in on the hot meatloaf sandwich. She ordered the mac n&#39; cheese and we got a texas toast to split. The toast came out first, and was two perfectly seasoned and crispy slices of bread that served it&#39;s purposed (namely to soak up the day drinking done prior to this)  perfectly. 

A few minutes later we got hit with the entrees. The hot meat loaf was amazing, mixed with a hot slaw between two perfectly fresh piece of bread. But what really shocked me was how damn good their chips were. Super salty and well flavored. The GF&#39;s mac n cheese was less transcendent but still a great example of mac, with a awesome crispy crust on top. 

Other than the food the bartender was cheery, and the atmosphere was that old timey wood feel that a lot of bars seem to be going for these days. They pull it off, and it made for a cozy bar to step up to on a cold day and eat some very well done comfort food. 

Coming back again, no doubt about it."

I&#39;ve had it! 

With that being said, my husband ordered the brick cooked chicken and loved it. It finished everything on his plate. He said the chicken was cooked perfectly.

So instead of getting all our food and then getting a spot on the beach, we got a spot first which was a long, tiring walk in the sand to go back and forth to. When we went, the lines for every eatery was super long except for The Brooklyn Star. Their fried chicken and waffle cone did smell good, so it was pretty worth it. The staff behind the counter were also nice. Price is a wee bit much for just a waffle cone with coleslaw and chicken nuggets drizzled with Sri Racha sauce and honey. The cone was a unique addition. It tasted like it was made with some cheddar cheese in it. It was pretty good though. The whole row of restaurants felt like a smaller version of Smorgasburg - the high prices, and the long lines! Might as well bring your own food next time."

We started with Mac and cheese - delish. The meatloaf sandwich is NOT your mommas meatloaf!  The brick chicken will make you wanna beat your momma!  

I would categorize the resturant as a comfort food spot - not soul food, but there is a lot of heart and soul in the dishes."

Got a table right away, which was surprising because usally I hate brunch line ridiculousness. Me and my friend ordered michaelades, a kale salad, and shrimp and grits.

 The michaeladas were disgusting. The salt rim had no seasoning and the mixture itself lacked spice and taste besides tomato. I couldn&#39;t finish it, for 10$.

The kale salad was teeny tiny, which is appropriate since it&#39;s salad. I&#39;m glad they used baby kale so it was easy to chew, but again, lacked proper spicing. The raisons and nuts were a nice touch, but the small piece of crisp cheddar was tiny. For $11 it was overpriced. 

Finally, the shrimp and grits was, like the michaelada, unedible. The grits were lumpy like oatmeal that had been cooked on the stove too long, then reheated in the microwave. For $17, we just ate the 5 pieces of shrimp that came with it. The &#34;sauce&#34; was, like everything else, indistinguishable. 

The server was nice, however. I will definitely not return here."

The chicken was very good, crispy skin and moist but cooked inside. The sides made the meal. Their mac &amp; cheese seems like more cheese than mac and tastes great. Their coleslaw is more of a pickled variety than a creamy variety but is really good. Their black beans could be a meal on their own.

Real good.Real friendly.Real chill. Real laid back.I felt the down south atmosphere here at Brooklyn Star. I had the family combo deal ($20 bucks). It came with southern style fried chicken, a whole bunch of sides.  Cole slaw,grits,mash potatoes,collard greens,bacon cornbread,that so delish mac and cheese,oh gwad. I absolutely love Brooklyn Star.  The chicken was good,a tad bit dry,but passable, especially when drizzled or doused in ranch dressing. The bacon cornbread was good,wished it had more bacony crunchiness, the collard greens were real good,and I didn&#39;t get that straight outta of a Green Giant can taste,fresh and actually pretty darn good. The cole slaw was not that impressive and the grits were more of an afterthought, but great the next day for breakfast.  Brooklyn Star, I heart you and the Chuck Norris posters."

Yes, it is quite expensive, but the inventive Southern-influenced dishes more than make up for it. The restaurant is spacious and dimly lit, with wooden tables and (occasionally overly) attentive staff. Both the &#34;small&#34; and &#34;big&#34; dishes are quite large, so I suggest ordering a variety of dishes and sharing everything. To start, we began with the fried brussel sprouts, duck wings, and mac n cheese. The fried brussel sprouts were delightful: crispy, nicely marinated, and paired well with the cooked hams. Not to go too NYTimes on this, but the duck wings were a REVELATION. I had no idea you could cook duck as a wing and still preserve the textures (i.e., crispy skin, juicy meat). Also exceptional was the mac n cheese. Yes, I was skeptical too - like burgers, every restaurant claims their mac and cheese is great. But the gooey mix of quesos, crunchy breading on top, and last but not least, crispy diced bacon made this a standout. Most joints put thick, limp bacon in their mac - not Brooklyn Star!

Now to the main: sweet tea braised chicken with dirty rice and Chinese broccoli. Already the juiciness of the chicken made this A+, but on top of that was the distinctive sweet, but savory marinade. The dirty rice with sausage and chicken liver was also quite good, and made for a meaty accompaniment. And the Chinese broccoli certainly served its vegetable purpose.

However, do be warned that a meal - appetizer, main, and drink - will easily run you $30-40, so this is not for the faint of financial heart. But if you&#39;re down for a lovely Southern-influenced dinner in Williamsburg, then game on."

It&#39;s definitely not fancy &amp; had an old feel but it was cool. I went on a Sunday for brunch &amp; the food was good  The only thing that I disliked was the fact that they don&#39;t offer bottomless mimosas. Their mimosas are $10 per glass &amp; $38 for a pitcher. 

Food: Was good. I had the chicken &amp; waffles. The chicken could&#39;ve had a little more flavor but it wasn&#39;t something that hot sauce couldn&#39;t fix. The waffle was on point &amp; they serve it w/ grapefruit on the side. I also had a side of eggs over easy &amp; ordered the bacon mac &amp; cheese to go which was also good but tasted a little burnt.

Drinks: Just the typical mimosa, nothing special.

Customer Service: The host was nice &amp; friendly. The waitress however clearly doesn&#39;t know what it is to smile. Didn&#39;t get her name, however she has short brown hair &amp; wore it half up in a bun &amp; half down. She wasn&#39;t nearly as inviting as the host. Never came to check up on us either.

A quick Yelp search returned this establishment, so we walked over and checked it out.  We were grateful to nab a spot, the only open table for two at the time, and decided to dig in.

The brunch menu was different than most.  I don&#39;t know if it was appetite at the time, but I wasn&#39;t looking at the menu and thinking, &#34;I can eat all of this&#34;.  Rather, I found myself looking things over a few times and felt somewhat undecided.  Then I spotted the Blueberry Johnny Cakes which became the instant favorite.  Got them and was not disappointed.  They were as good as the &#34;Johnny Cakes&#34; Sopranos episode where Vito finds a short order cook at a diner in New Hampshire and gets into some atypical mafia love making.

Great find and happy to have stumbled in.  This place also has a floor just for bathrooms, which is a huge deal for me.  Love the idea of bathrooms being separate from the kitchen and tables.  I&#39;ll try to point this feature out for each review I make."

[1] Spicy Fried Duck Wings
The main feature here is the sauce. The sweet and spicy glaze over the tender duck makes this an above average appetizer.
[2] Mussels &amp; Crawfish Sausage
The grilled sourdough went well with the sauce in this dish. But otherwise, an average dish that wasn&#39;t anything special.
[3] Country Fried Steak
I understand now why this dish is the dish to get here. The gravy is amazing and completes the wonderfully fried and cooked steak.
[4] Chocolate Bread Pudding
I was too tempted by not to try their dessert. Made fresh from scratch, the bread pudding was soft and succulent (and perhaps a little too sweet), yet nonetheless a worthy addition.

Overall, while this restaurant didn&#39;t make any personal lists of mine, I would return eager to anticipate other dishes (along with that country fried steak!)."

We came in right when it opened on Father&#39;s Day, and had no issue getting a table without a reservation. Though, we must have timed it right, because shortly after, there was a 30 minute wait.  

-Texas toast ($4): good. They give you two pieces of lightly buttered, garlic toast with a side of butter. The waitress also gave us honey to spread on the toast, but we didn&#39;t try it. Seemedr odd. 

-Mac and cheese with bacon ($9): good. The mac and cheese didn&#39;t look like much, but it&#39;s plenty considering how rich it is. This mac and cheese is baked creating a nice crust, and they were very generous with the bacon. I wish the bacon used was a combination of soft and crispy vs just crispy, but I know that&#39;s a matter of preference. Also, I wish this dish was slightly creamier. I like my baked mac and cheese to have a nice cheesy crust, but to have a slight wet, creamy center. 

-Scottish salmon ($14): pretty good. The fresh salmon over arugula, with creamed eggs, salmon roe, and toast. I thought this dish was really good for the most part. I wish they would have used a little more salmon roe, or salted the eggs some, because the dish was a little bland if I made a bite without the roe. Also, I wish the toast was slightly more toasted or given to me on a separate plate. Because the toast came on the plate, some of the pieces got soggy. 

-Kool-aid ($1): great, because it&#39;s kool-aid! It&#39;s punch flavored with the right amount of sweet. 

Overall, we liked this place. The place is really bright, clean, and inviting. The employees were also really friendly and nice. And the prices are great for the amount and quality of food you get. 

What we liked most about this place, is the size. They have two entrances: one for the restaurant, and one for the bar. The one for the bar has a ramp which is awesome if you have to deal with a stroller and/or wheelchair. Once inside, the tables are nicely spaced apart, so you won&#39;t have to worry about bumping into people. And the booths are huge. This is a great place to come in larger groups, or with your family. Nice noise level. 

They accept credit cards."

It would be all good news, but of course this time my boyfriend didn&#39;t like the twist and would have rathered the plain, or raisins, or coconut versions. Personally, I am unphased and more than happy to enjoy the rest I brought home by myself. Forgot no flour diet! haha

They also have the family style fried chicken dinner (two person minimum) that gives each person two pieces of chicken and a choice of one side for $20 per person. The sides were actually pretty large and the chicken pieces are average sized so the price kinda works out?

The best is sitting at the bar right about the time they open. The bartenders are awesome. They lack the pretension that other places like Extra Fancy has. The whiskey cocktails are great. Wasn&#39;t impressed with the spicy margarita very much, but the food is what you come here for! The Brussels are too die for. I&#39;m so tired of all the same kinds of dishes in Brooklyn, but this dish is just yummy. The sauce is tart and juicy (a light barbecue sauce) then peppered with ham hock. It&#39;s savory delicious and awesome. The Bone Marrow is lovely. Between the jam and the smokiness and the toast with it, I&#39;m hooked! The main dining room is very clean with beautiful decor that is simple and allows you to feel like you are in your own home with your main squeeze. I always get the romaine salad and meatloaf sandwich. They never disappoint and the meatloaf sandwich is even better when I eat the leftovers out of the fridge at 3 AM.

I miss the McCall Vineyard wine on their BTG list, but they have great wines that support the food.

Brunch is fun too, even though I hate going because of all the people, it is really a solid yummy menu.

BRUNCH: Very crowded, the second time I&#39;ve been there, there was a line of people down the block, waiting before it opened to be seated. That&#39;s some dedication! But it was a very quick turnaround, and I was impressed with the attentiveness of the waiters and the quality of the food. They really know what they&#39;re doing! The brunch cocktails are very good and I always go for the Texas toast. Yum!

DINNER: I went this past Sunday for dinner with my boyfriend and was seated, when we wanted to switch seats, they were very accommodating! However, the first thing we noticed was that the inside of the restaurant was not that much cooler than the outside summer heat. Yikes. 

Soon after, I stated to cool off with some water and the promise of food. We ordered the Bone Marrow and Texas Toast as appetizers, my boyfriend got the Country Fried Steak, and I got the Sweet Tea Glazed Brick-Pressed Chicken. 

The Bone Marrow was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be more of a venturous eater but is still wary of what they eat. It&#39;s two halves of a huge bone (don&#39;t know what bone it was), but the inside is perfectly grilled or charred or something, and it&#39;s buttery--it comes with 8 pieces of toast (I think we accidentally ordered too much toast, whoops! But yay to more carbs.), some jellied radish thing(?), salt, and two marrow scooper-spoon things for easier access and highly efficient marrow scooping! It was delicious, savory and a really cool experience. I&#39;d say you should order this if you&#39;re out with friends or a date who isn&#39;t vegetarian or vegan, or gluten free, and you can easily impress them.

The Texas toast, as per usual, was amazing and crispy. I couldn&#39;t stop myself from eating more slices, even though I&#39;d just had marrow-toast-jelly. (My mouth is watering just thinking about this now.)

The chicken was piping hot when it came out, incredibly juicy and fall-off-the-bone. I&#39;d never had chicken so good! (Not kidding.) Chicken at restaurants is usually dry and hard to do well, but this glaze was also incredible. It was like teriyaki but way more wholesome, and the summer squash that came with it was also delicious! So yummy. I really recommend this to anyone who wants to get a lighter dish (I use the word &#39;lighter&#39; very generally, because there weren&#39;t that many carbs in this specific dish, compared to the slew of toast I&#39;d just chowed down on). 

I didn&#39;t try the country fried steak, but it looked really scrumptious, and my boyfriend pretty much finished the entire plate, so he had a good time with it! 

The only thing that concerned me and kept me from giving this place the full 5 star treatment, was the fact that I was sweating through my entire meal. Both my boyfriend and I. It was incredibly hot, and very little ventilation. For a few moments, I thought that I was almost in the subway--you know when you&#39;re waiting on the platform for your train, and a different train passes by but you don&#39;t even care that it&#39;s not your train because it was so humid and hot and the movement of the train made a slightly-cooler breeze pass around you? It was like that, but every time a waiter or busboy passed by. I was sweating so much that I actually used more napkins for my face than the food. Ew, I know. Why isn&#39;t there more air conditioning?! 

TL;DR: come here for the awesome food, but wear as little and airy clothing as possible so you don&#39;t have a simultaneous shower."

My roommate farewell dinner was in this restaurant and it was surprisingly good.  Well, it is not the most healthy food (bc it is southern) but the duck was very tasty. I did not try the chocolate pudding but it looks very heavy and according to some of the group , the bacon mac and cheese was the opposite of light. I believe this is a good address for me ONLY FOR WINTER."

We&#39;ve been wanting a southern brunch meal for a while now. During my research of restaurants, I came across this restaurant. It has a contemporary, rustic ambience. Very well kept as well. We were able to be seated right away and actually had the option of picking our table. The staff was so inviting and seemed to enjoy their jobs.

The meal itself is simple, self-explanatory. So I ordered the fried pork chop and he originally ordered the blueberry Johnny cakes. 

We split the mac and cheese, which was cheesy and made to perfection. It came in a cute little skillet and the bacon inside was the perfect touch. ( perfect for sharing ). My fried pork was so delicious and tasted so fresh, perfect crispness and not fatty. I opted for scrambled as instead of the fried eggs. FYI, they&#39;ll accommodate food request like that as long as it&#39;s not busy which is totally understandable.  

Unfortunately for my boyfriend, the Johnny cakes wasn&#39;t his cup of tea because it&#39;s made out of a wheat flour/cornmeal like base and he&#39;s not a fan of that. So he opted for the fried pork chop.

Why may ask why I gave 5 stars. That is because when my boyfriend expressed to our waitress his dissatisfaction of his meal. She proceeded to not only agree to opt his meal for another but also ask if he could just give her feedback on why exactly he wasn&#39;t satisfied with his meal so that management can be aware of what the customers like and don&#39;t like. I really wish I got her name because those gestures are the epitome of great customer service. 

So that alone made my experience that much better and we will definitely be back to try their dinner meal, which our waitress expressed was what they are known for.

So in conclusion, if you&#39;re in the area, please give this restaurant a try. You definitely will not regret it at all!!"

We got biscuits and gravy and the chicken and waffles with that biscuit side. Like I said carb heaven. Our food came out very quickly and we were more than satisfied. My boyfriend&#39;s chicken n waffles came with grapefruit which I thought was weird but he loved it. It was grilled with a little bit of sugar on it we also got the Bloody Bull, good, not great.

We found this place, and oh my god, I can&#39;t tell you how in love I am with the Brooklyn Star.

BEAUTIFUL DECOR. CUTE SEATING. DRINKS IN MASON JARS. Soooooo cute!
Coke in the glass bottles! AMAZING LEMONADE!
My boyfriend got the duck wings as an appetizer and ate them all. He loved them. I can&#39;t tell you if they were good, but since he didn&#39;t share, I&#39;m guessing they were ;) haha! It&#39;s okay, because I ordered the buttermilk biscuits and didn&#39;t share either. You have to get them. BUTTERMILK BISCUITS. GET THEM. THEY MELT IN YO MOUTH. ugh so good, that was probably my favorite part.
 
I had the country fried steak. Soooooo DELISH! The mashed potatoes were 10 out of 10. My boyfriend had the pork chop... It was huge. Could&#39;ve easily served 2 more people.

But you can bet it will be one of the first places I go, especially after looking at that menu. Their classic chicken fried steak with potatoes is the bomb, it&#39;s tender and juicy and a bit heavenly in your mouth. We also tried a watermelon feta salad that they had at that time and it was as flavorful as it was refreshing.

The texas toast and muffins are the best!! If it&#39;s too much bread for the table and you don&#39;t want to stuff yourself with carbs before your actual meal comes out then I recommend getting just the toast. It came out warm and tasty! Oh and I love their butter. We also had the Cinnamon bun which was good too. The mac and cheese was okay, I&#39;ve definitely had better. I think it could be cheesier. There&#39;s really no cons. My bf and I had the chicken and waffles and meatloaf sandwich. It was just okay. We agreed that we have had our good shares of chicken and waffles. The meatloaf Sandwich didn&#39;t blow me away. I had all the bread/carbs and was only able to take 2-3 bites of my sandwich and couldn&#39;t finish anymore.

Oh and we came across an experience that made me dislike the business practice. We made reservations for 8 on Sunday and most of our parties had already arrive (7 out of 8) instead of letting us sit. The lady said we have to wait till everyone is here. The place is not big and to have 7 people stand around waiting is stupid. She even tells us to move aside at one point so the servers can pass by with the food. Uh? Hello, if u had sat us. This whole situation could have been avoided. Would have given 3 stars and then after typing this unpleasant experience, i decided to take away a star."

I had the macaroni and cheese with bacon and breadcrumbs and my cousin had the chicken fried steak. Both dishes were very generously portioned and lip-smacking good. We debated getting a side of the Texas toast, but the impending carb-coma seemed too real so we skipped it. Next time, and with a side of those biscuits, too.

I do not care for Tuna Tartare, so I can&#39;t say that I loved it, but it was decent. For my entree, I had the Chicken Pot Pie and my mother had the Roasted Chicken. The Pot Pie was the perfect, petite size: chicken, potatoes, peas, corn, and squash in a creamy sauce, served in a ceramic bowl and topped with a flaky biscuit. It was very nice, and definitely different than any chicken pot pies that I&#39;ve had. My mother&#39;s chicken was good as well, and the Rainbow Carrots and Onions served with it were perhaps the best part.

Going inside the bar was like entering into a 19-century Victorian church, dim in light yet chilled in vibe. There were ancient paintings hanging on the wall everywhere, making it more distanced from the contemporary environment - considering the fact that we were physically in time-sq, one of the most matured and modern neighborhood in the city.

Based on the location, I expected over-sized strollers, M&amp;M bags and thick Reebok sneakers to liter the restaurant. But, boy- I was wrong.

Who: The couples of Hell&#39;s Kitchen, a few theater people and some Barclays bankers (throwing them back at the bar)

What: Drinks- Extensive drink menu, wine and tequila selections are endless- overwhelming variety of cocktails just waiting to be instagrammed.

Food- Food is on the lighter side. You are not coming to this restaurant to eat until you hurt (as I do at places like The Palm, Hillstone, Nanni&#39;s etc.) Our table ordered calamari, variety of toast and steak fret. 

Atmosphere- The restaurant has this &#39;Vintage&#39; old time theme. (which is difficult to explain without making it sound like a Cracker Barrel). Beautifully decorated.  

When: I came here before a show around 5:45. We asked for them to speed up the order to make a show and they brought everything out very quickly. 

Where: Smack center of where Broadway shows are playing. The outside of this building is disguised as a vintage antique store, covered in vines. Very easy to miss. 

Why: Lets face it- New Yorkers will do anything they can to avoid this area and being around aggressive street performers and burnt out tourist families. However, when we entertain out-of-towners we are always roped into a Time Square Olive Garden. This restaurant is an amazing alternative to a traditional stressful pre-theater dinner."

I was honestly was expecting an uppity feel to this place but that wasn&#39;t the case at all!

Running dangerously low on phone battery life, we asked our hostess if we could get a table near an outlet. She happily sat us at the bar and informed us the underside of the bar had outlets running along it (and I didn&#39;t feel so weird asking once I saw other people had their various devices plugged in as well).

They have an awesome lunch special on - $14 for an entree and your choice of a glass of house wine or a half pint of a few selections from their beers on tap.

The description of the Tempura chicken sandwich intrigued me so I ordered that and a Hoegaarden. My GF got the Lillie&#39;s salad (with added chicken) and a Hoegaarden as well.

The super friendly bartender chatted with us while we sipped our beers and waited for our food. He told us about how the place came together (renos and decor pieces gathered from estate sales or shipped in from Europe). In case you&#39;re wondering, the old timey cash register is not a functioning one . . . however super fun since it has A LOT of buttons to press lol

OMG the tempura sandwich was sooooooooooooo good. The cabbage slaw and spicy aioli were a perfect match to the juicy deep fried chicken. The chips were meh, not crispy and kinda chewy which was a bit disappointing. 

My GF&#39;s salad looked amazing! It wasn&#39;t the typical sad &#34;spring salad&#34; . There was mix of different greens/lettuces, shaved root veggies and a hearty helping of chicken.

My favorite place in New York City by far. And the other 2 girls I traveled with had the same enthusiasm. Lillie&#39;s is beautiful, charming, authentic, and convenient. 

Beautiful, authentic and Charming: The theme is Victorian Irish Pub. All of the decor are artifacts from estate sales in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Lillie, the bar&#39;s namesake, was a broadway actress during the Victorian Era in NYC. A stunning portrait of this woman looms above the mantle. The bar itself is probably the most ornate, beautiful bar facade I have ever seen- marble pillars, stocked with every liquor you could imagine. The decor is certainly eclectic and interesting- something is always catching your eye. 

Convenient: Located just a few blocks away from Times Square and Broadway, but without tourist prices and fare! I had a meal and drinks here prior to seeing a theater performance. 

Fare: Heavenly food. Vegetarians will not be disappointed. Friendly pricing- you could get a soup for $8 or an entree from $12-25. Plenty of light-bite options. AWESOME Belgian beer selection. Beers will run you about $6-9. 

Bottom Line: Worth a visit for a drink and an immersive, beautiful experience."

The down side to this place was their service. I fully understand that the place might get pretty crowded before a show, but all the bartenders treated us as though we were peasants at her majesty&#39;s castle. Isn&#39;t my sterling just as good as anyone else&#39;s?

If I were you I&#39;d go to Dutch Fred&#39;s instead. I don&#39;t have any Dutch jokes, but apparently their cocktails are better and their bartenders are nicer (and ironically Irish... Tod was amazing!)"

Those expectations are typically even higher when it comes to Times Square. I&#39;m not talking about shitty chain restaurants. I&#39;m talking about restaurants that present themselves as upscale places that expect you to pay $20 for a hamburger. 

I arrived at Lilly&#39;s at 5pm on a Tuesday with my gf and another couple. Everyone commented on the decor. It&#39;s funky and homey. After looking around, my gf and I realized that we had been to their other location since both places are decorated exactly the same. This made us happy since we remembered that our meal at the other location was good. Sadly, we found out that it was not the case at this place. 

After my gf and the other couple got drinks...holy shit did you see the prices of the mixed drinks? $18 for 1/2 cup of alcohol? We didn&#39;t get them, but based on that price, I hope they&#39;re made with gold flakes!

We ordered the nachos. If you didn&#39;t already know, I love nachos!  I did not love these nachos. A few were stale and most were soggy. I&#39;m not sure what type of cheese they used. It was similar to movie theater liquid cheese with some type of spices in it. Not great. 

My gf and I shared a burger. The size of the burger didn&#39;t even come close to covering the surface of the bottom bun. Not sharing friendly at all. The sad burger came with a even sadder side of not so crispy fries. 

The other couple ordered 2 appetizers. One was the fried chicken burger and the other was something else that I can&#39;t remember. I do remember that it came with a side of potato chips (which I assume were from a 25 cent bag of chips). The fried chicken burger was 3/4 fried coating and 1/4 chicken. 

So overall we got 3 beers, 1 main dish and 3 appetizers for about $120. Not worth even half of that. Nope, never again."

I was completely caught off guard by how big and nice this bar was, especially with it being in Times Square. I came here for some after work drinks and we reserved a table for about 10+ people. Super easy to reserve and we were quickly seated. It was great!

Service was super attentive. Our waitress was constantly checking up on us, ordering and providing us drinks in a timely fashion. The drinks themselves were really delicious. I got the man-eater cocktail twice! It was made with some fruity juice and smoky mezcal. It wasn&#39;t overly sweet, a good balance with the smoky aroma the mezcal gave up. Really delicious. Their variations of old-fashioned were also very impressive. My co-workers were chugging them down like water as it went down so smooth.

As for food, we got nachos, truffle fries, boneless buffalo chicken wings and  fried mac and cheese egg rolls. Everything was excellent. There was plenty to share amongst the group. The mac and cheese egg rolls were a hit for drunk munchies as were their truffle fries. Appetizers were definitely great for bar food.

There was zero disappointment in food, service and drinks. I would be more than happy to come back again, whether it be for work, a group friends or a simple date!"

When I first looked at it from the exterior I thought it was a high end antique shop. I came on a Saturday for brunch with 3 other people. To be sure we had a table, I made reservations one day prior which was basically pointless because we were the only ones there besides the staff at 2PM.

The food: Brunch comes with a drink and entree for $18. Drinks include sodas, tea, coffee (you get one comp refill for this), mimosa, bloody Mary (additional charge), and various beers. Certain options on the menu also have additional up-charges.

What we got:
- Crab-cake eggs Benedict: the Crab-cake Benedict was fantastic. The home fries that accompanied them were inedible and completely burnt, bitter and dry.

- Omelet with ham, bacon and cheddar: This was a pretty basic dish but again the home fries were inedible.

- 2 orders of Lillie&#39;s breakfast burger: Bacon was an additional $2. Overall a decent burger but for $20 I&#39;d rather go to Burger &amp; Lobster for better meat quality. Also wanted to mention that the pickle sliver that is served with the burger is RANCID. Do not eat it. It tastes like a mix between sweaty socks, hot steamy garbage with a hint of sewage. Not sure if it was just a bad batch we got but it was disgusting.

Me and my friend tried to ask the waitress if we could exchange or replace the burnt/dry home fries. She said she would see what she could do and returned 5 minutes later to ask us what we had. She told us she had to re-ring our orders in order to get the fries. I thought that was weird but it was fine. After 15 minutes we got our fries. After getting our checks we found out that she had charged us a substitution fee for the fries which was never divulged in the first place. It wasn&#39;t a lot but it&#39;s the principal. You served us inedible home fries so we have to pay more for something edible?"

The hostess tells us that she can squeeze us in but we have to be gone in an hour. That&#39;s fine. We hang up our coats, start looking at the drink menu while the table is prepared, and then another hostess comes over and looks over what the first hostess was doing. Turns out the table is only available for another 25 minutes, which obviously isn&#39;t enough time.

Neither do I ... or Troy McClure ... because this review is brought to you by the good folks behind Gin &amp; Tonic ... and the bar at Lillie&#39;s. I&#39;ve been drinking. No other explanation needed, right? RIGHT!? Well, at Lillie&#39;s there is no need to justify yourself to her, your liver, or the bartender. 

&#34;I do not regret one moment of my life.&#34;
- Lillie Langtry

The Notorious Lillie Smalls (Langtry) was a British rapper and socialite from the late 1800s who challenged Victorian society straight outta the Isle of Jersey (in the U.K.). She was equally legendary as the mistress of kings and princes as she was as a stage actress. Long before Kim Kardashian and Marilyn Monroe, the world had Lillie. Can you imagine how huge she&#39;d be on social media today?

Her spirit and your need for another drink live on at Lillie&#39;s Victorian Bar &amp; Restaurant near Times Square. The ostentatious blend of antique marble bar, ornate wooden carvings, and antiques from a late 19th century Irish ballroom are as memorable as the lady Lillie herself.

Reminiscing the night away with Bombay Sapphire &amp; Tonic while Olivia sipped Lillie&#39;s signature cocktail called Bidi Bidi Bom Bom and then a Long Island Iced Tea left both of us under the Lillie Langtry spell. I have a crush. xoxo

TL/DR: I&#39;m drunk. Go to Lillie&#39;s."

The first point of interest I have to discuss is the d√©cor. If you want Victorian era d√©cor then this is your place. Forget visiting Europe or a museum, because I believe that Lillie&#39;s has clean then all out to stock the walls, ceiling and everywhere else with this mid 1800&#39;s style. Not to mention this restaurant has one of the highest ceiling in any establishment I&#39;ve ever dined in.

There is a solid collection of wines, cocktails and beers to choose from, especially the draught beers.

The food at Lillie&#39;s is interesting. Some combinations that are a bit baffling to the mind and taste buds. The calamari for example comes with pickled onions &amp; (chili&#39;s) jalapenos, a fig balsamic reduction, chipotle aioli and grilled lemon. Before you ask, yes the lemon is noticeably grilled (that or it&#39;s the balsamic). The calamari itself were good well and had a nice taste, but the balsamic gives it a peculiar flavor. It&#39;s isn&#39;t bad but in my opinion the flavors don&#39;t work too well together. There is a bitterness to it.

The mozzarella bites and burger were very good.

The lemon loaf is a dessert with a very yin/yang relationship. The lemon loaf itself is dry without a strong flavor while the ice cream/sorbet on top is the complete opposite. One of the sweetest flavors I&#39;ve ever eaten. My pallet didn&#39;t know what to do in the situation. Eating both at the same time didn&#39;t blend them together. Both items fought the entire time while in my mouth. The dish itself is good and the items works together (to a point), but it&#39;s still peculiar to me.

Overall: 3.5 Stars
This is one of the few places where I am completely uncertain how to rate it. 
Many dishes are modern with what I would define as Victorian flare, which works for many of the dishes, but not all. The food is interesting to say the least.
The service is friendly and tries their hardest to get everything to you as quickly as possible during the after work booze rush and pre-Broadway show crowd.
Mildly on the higher end of the price scale with a drink and 3-course meal adding to approximately $60 with tax and tip.
Lillie&#39;s is worth a try, but I highly recommend a reservation for any visit past 6pm as it is very crowded during the rush hours. If you don&#39;t like making reservations, best show up early to beat the crowds."

There had been some sort of problem with the keg of the beer my husband ordered, then the next beer he ordered had a problem as well.

The decor is definitely Victorian, like you&#39;re stopping in a bar inside an old European castle.  Drinks are very good; pricey, but this is an upscale bar in NY, and by comparison, not more expensive than similar upscale places.

I got a smoked old fashioned, and it was very good.  They use a torch to get a plank of something - I assume cedar - super hot and smokey and they place the glass over the burnt plank so it fills with smoke.  Added a great smokey flavor, though points come off from the glass of small ice cubes. I&#39;m not an old fashioned snob - I go to a bar or restaurant and order one, I don&#39;t care if its one large ice cube or a glass full of smaller ones - but if you&#39;re an upscale joint trying to do something fancy with your drink, like add smoke to it, you should at least have all of the basics perfect, too.

So, star off for that, and for the fact that this is a huge place and it seems like they only have a single unisex bathroom, though we may have missed another one.  Also, service wasn&#39;t great.  It was a Saturday night and not too busy, but the bar is really really long, and they had 2 bartenders, one of which was spending too much time talking to a manager or something over at a table, so it was difficult getting served.  We also found it very strange that they had a large inflatable soccer ball outside.  I get it - its a european bar and there&#39;s a soccer tournament going on, but they had 2 TVs in the whole place - one at each end of the bar.  Not really very sporty.  I would think a crowded bar of soccer houligans...sorry...soccer fans would want to be able to watch the game, which would be difficult here if you weren&#39;t lucky enough to get a seat in front of 1 of the 2 TVs.

Still, I really liked it here and would definitely come back."

The tables are more suited for a bar that does not serve food. We had a variety of menu options around the table and none were good. I had the chicken pot pie and it was a joke.

The spot has a very cool vibe with lots of specialty cocktails on the menu.  You could just sit and enjoy the decor and ambiance without drinking too because of the unique experience at Lillie&#39;s.  The bartender was good and friendly... making sure we got our drinks in a timely manner.  Relatively easy for us to get a few stools at the bar and hang out.

Interior looks amazing and chocolate pudding was slaying it. however that&#39;s about the end of it.
waitress ignored us for a good half an hr...  I mean we were a big party but we did make reservation so I imagine they should dedicate at lease one person even if they are super busy, but a way one hour into it we final got the orders in. 
the lady pear sandwich is greasy AF after the first bite I didn&#39;t want to touch it anymore, it was literally dripping oil. and the chips were just soft and soaked in greasy as well. 
anyway, probably a good place for drink and chat but just don&#39;t order their food, totally not worth it."

There was a minor mistake on our dinner receipt and Clive told us to come back after the show for dessert. Dessert and our 2 rounds of drinks were comped.

The ambience is lovely. It&#39;s themed so the art, furniture and even the staff give you actual Victorian era vibes. We loved it! You can avoid the crowd between 3 and 5 to really get a good feel of the place

The tall ceilings and dark wood remind me of a bar you would find in Europe. Being a few blocks off of both Times Square and Rockefeller Center, the food was overpriced but that could be expected at any restaurant in the area.

I noticed that they have a lunch special that for $13 you get a sandwich and beer, which I thought was a pretty good value.  However, once I received my food, I thought the value wasn&#39;t even worth it.  I ordered the reuben sandwich which was just subpar.  I couldn&#39;t even finish the whole sandwich because it was just so low-quality.  

I do love the ambiance of this place - high ceilings, ceiling to couch picture frames and such, but the food was just awful I would not come back here for more than a beer!"

When I first walked in, I was a little lost because I didn&#39;t know where we could sit. My friends and I just kind of walked all over the restaurant and sat at a random table before someone actually came to ask us how many people we have. Most of the tables had a reserved sign ... I&#39;m almost so sure they&#39;re not really reserved, so that was annoying. 

After I had sat down and settled with the menu, things got better. Everyone in my party arrived and we ordered some food and drinks because some of us were hungry. I like to drink Gin so when I saw the Bulldog gin and tonic with muddled raspberries, I knew I had to try it. It was made perfectly and I loved this place because of this drink. Unfortunately I forgot the name of the drink. 

I would probably be back but with a smaller crowd because this place just seems so intimate and kind of romantic. The red velvet couch seating looks comfy. The ceilings are really high and it makes the whole place seem classy and fun."

Once you step inside you would think this place has been here since the Victorian Age. Funny enough, it&#39;s pretty recent. There was an italian restaurant here before and then they added all the victorian era furniture and art.

It&#39;s an amazing spot to take a date if you&#39;re in the theater district. Probably best after a broadway show. It wasn&#39;t too crowded around 11pm and they even had live music.

I was a bit apprehensive about coming here for brunch considering that most of the reviews were for dinner, but ended up here anyway. 

First off, the interior design of the restaurant is beautiful! I can see how this place would make for a great evening dinner or pre-dinner cocktail get-together. The brunch menu was nothing special. One of my friends ordered the Irish breakfast and the other ordered the steak and eggs. They were not impressed by their dishes. I ordered the pulled-pork sandwich and substituted home fries for truffle french fries for an additional +$4. I paid $27 (that&#39;s including tax and tip) for a sandwich and an iced-coffee. I have to say that this was not the best sandwich I&#39;ve ever had nor did it come close to it. I didn&#39;t see this dining experience as anything special, and I would not come here again."

It does fill up, mostly at the bar. We got there a little after 5pm on a Friday and it was packed, but there were a few tables, although we made a reservation so we didn&#39;t have to wait.

The place is absolutely gorgeous with super high ceilings and Victorian(?) Era decor. The jazzy/Afro-Caribbean music was also a great contrast. It got a good amount of people dancing their hearts out on a Sunday night. The bar was also playing the olympics on a few tv screens, which provided for an eclectic experience. Everyone seemed to be in high spirits while talking over food/drink, dancing, or watching the olympics. 

Although I didn&#39;t try the food, the drinks were strong and well-mixed. The bartender was so kind and even came over with free shots of Jameson after he heard we were there for a birthday. That was totally unexpected as Lillie&#39;s is situated in midtown and rather high-end.

The bathrooms, the walls, and walking around is a MUST. our drinks were very tasty. They have a variety of beer options if you like to dabble. 

As we were sitting around I started to look all around. I felt like I was in Chelsea or W4 at a local antique shop. They have all kinds of old photos of people, antique lamps, chairs, household items. Honestly when we first walked passed it I was look in the window as if I was looking for the next piece to add to my collection. I had to second look to realize it was a bar.

Ordered some apps (spicy calamari, so good, with pulled pork nachos, also good but I didn&#39;t appreciate the cold shredded cheese that seemed to be blowtorched and unevenly burnt/heated) and a burger and sandwich. He loved his Lillie&#39;s burger. My Lady Pear sandwich was such a yummy marriage of ingredients without meat but the bread could have been a teeny bit less oily. I had half and packed half. It seemed to be oiler two days later.

They offered gluten free options for sandwich bread but I forgot to inquire about it.

Would I come back? Sure! 

Husband loved the decor. He never says stuff like that... So it was a nice, causal and quick date before hitting the theater."

We had just been to an Irish bar on Times Square that eventually turned into extremely loud rap music, so we set off to find an alternative. 

From the outside it looks like a tiny antique store, you&#39;d never know what&#39;s behind those closed doors.  My friend scouted the place out since they are open late. Upon walking in I fell in love with the Victorian decor, the somewhat modern atmosphere and the towering ceilings with cascading mirrors. 

We did not eat as I mentioned it was extremely late but the drink prices were exactly as expected in NYC especially near the tourist trap that is Times Square. Upon my next trip, I will definitely recommend friends and colleagues to try it out and I will make a commitment to try the food.

Decor is nice. Very green... And the service is good. 

The food is good. Had the wild boar radiator pasta. Very heavy dense dish. And they give you a decent size portion. So much pasta. And a good bit of meat. Maybe some veg could have balanced this dish out. Felt like I should have fun a marathon before eating this... Also tried a little bit of the Icelandic cod. Is good. And the steak.

How they were able to have hot food despite no gas is a mystery I don&#39;t care to unravel.

Like I said, Atrium is relatively upmarket (at least in price), so it&#39;s best for business lunches. The place itself is big (there&#39;s an upstairs for events), but when everyone in the neighborhood is coming for lunch, your best bet is to be a small-ish group and sit at the bar (or the communal table by the front).

Pursuant to Elsie W. and Jade J.&#39;s reviews, we drove to DUMBO on a cloudy Saturday morning to visit this venue. The area around it is absolutely beautiful. I spent a lot of time in the 1990s near York Street and remember this being, shall we say, not a place where anyone wanted to be, especially at night. My how things have changed. West Elm is across the street, not a warehouse or factory. There are casual joggers, not people running from a gun battle. Not bad!

Food: the chicken and waffles were the real disappointment here. The chicken was too dry, and the waffles seemed too soggy. The steak and eggs meal more than made up for my disappointment though. Our appetizer biscuits were amazing! I also really enjoyed my side of corn with melted cheese on top. 

Service: it&#39;s kind of a hit or miss. Some servers were extremely responsive, but others were like &#34;meh&#34;. The greeter was definitely not as welcoming as he could be, but this is DUMBO. If you want exceptional service, they probably want you to go elsewhere. 

Decor: the wall plants were interesting. The open kitchen concept is a good idea, especially because the steam and heat did not bother us in the dining room at all.

I hope to be back for dinner someday."

Very cute spot, small, and close to the water and bridge so it was the perfect location in dumbo by the water! It was very Brooklyn - plants growing on the wall, a little trendy, and reservations are highly recommended.

We didn&#39;t have a reservation but came early enough to get the long table at the bar to seat the 6 of us. We started with the bacon deviled eggs, which comes with 6 halves and were wonderfully salty and delicious. I had the Cobb salad with chicken, which was the perfect size and I loved the dressing - creamy and not too heavy for brunch! They also gave you the option to add shrimp or lobster to it which looked great. My sister ordered the chicken &amp; waffles (comes with a poached egg, she got scrambled) which was great, not oily and especially yummy with the extra syrup on the side. I had a few of the potato wedges we got to share, which were just okay. Pretty thick and unevenly crunchy vs soft, I think they&#39;d do better with a truffle fry or something but everything else was lovely so it was nbd.

Unless you snag a spot at the bar, this little spot is not very walk-in friendly so I definitely recommend a reservation! Or you can call ahead to see what the bar situation is like. They also have outdoor seating for the warmer months. Thanks for a fab brunch!"

A decently tasty meal but just not one worth the wait or the price tag. Came in for a late Sunday meal. The host was very professional. He got me a seat outside within 15 minutes even though the place was super crowded. It was a bit chilly outside and it&#39;s very dimly lit. Since they have outdoor seating I do wish they&#39;d put some heaters or at least some more lighting. It&#39;s basically some tables out front and there&#39;s no &#34;atmosphere&#34; to the area especially compared to the gorgeous interior. My actual server was polite but also uncomfortably robotic. I&#39;m not sure how else to describe the experience. Talking to him was almost surreal. Either way, he did his job and made sure all my needs were taken care of so I was happy enough.

For my meal I ordered the crudo and the lamb loin. The crudo was plated simply but beautifully and had a soft succulent texture but it was also bordering slimy. This wouldn&#39;t be too big of an issue except the strong fishiness from the anchovy oil made it a bit...iffy. It was still delicious but the warning centers in my brain kept saying to stop. In the end, I didn&#39;t get sick, and I enjoyed it overall....so.... I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth getting if you can get over the fish oil taste. (4/5)

The lamb loin was the main disappointment. While it was a nice medium rare and the yogurt went well with it, it was just kind of bland overall. It was sort of tender and the earthy taste was nice but as a whole, it kind of just tasted like a block of meat. For $36, I would definitely not get this again. (3/5)

Overall, parts of my meal were enjoyable but between the price and how uncomfortable the atmosphere was, I probably wouldn&#39;t dine here again, at least not alone (and just to note, I was eating alone my entire trip, I&#39;m ok with it for the most part)."

Service is attentive and incredibly friendly.
Highly recommend if you&#39;re in the area for the experience alone!!
The food was solid, but 3 stars.

FOOD
Smoked Salmon Crostini - Delicious, high quality smoked salmon.  I just had really terrible smoked salmon a few days before in Fort Lauderdale, so I really appreciated this dish

Ricotta Crostini - Yum!  If I had to choose between the two, I recommend this one.  Ricotta + speck + balsamic vinegar + honey... flavor explosion

* the crostinis were the highlight of the meal

Fried Chicken &amp; Waffle - Solid. I love fried chicken so I&#39;m biased towards feeling positive... but the chicken wasn&#39;t particularly spicy or flavorful which I&#39;ve come to expect after being spoiled by eating way too many fried chicken sandwiches at Fuku+ (Midtown Manhattan).  Omg why are those sandwiches so addicting?  So bad for my waistline... Anyway back to Atrium Dumbo. The waffle could have been a bit firmer.  The dish came with a poached egg which was a nice addition.

Croque Monsieur - (I didn&#39;t try this only because I don&#39;t like this dish in general, so this is all from my friend.)  The bread was way too hard to eat so she just scrapped off the top portion of cheese + ham portion.  That was good/satisfying

DRINK
Blood Orange Mimosa - I didn&#39;t realize this wasn&#39;t freshly squeezed blood orange.  I don&#39;t mind orange juice + sparkly for a normal mimosa, but there was something odd about this Blood Orange Mimosa.  I read in other reviews that they might add a blood orange syrup, which would make sense.  Don&#39;t get this drink"

We came for lunch and we didn&#39;t have a reservation so we had to sit in the bar area. This was ok though as it wasn&#39;t loud at all and we got to look out the window. 

I ordered the avocado crostini (toast). I didn&#39;t really know what to expect but the dish was basically a large piece of toast smothered in avocado, some type of aoli, crushed red pepper and a hard boiled egg. Im not an egg person by any means but this egg was the freshest thing I&#39;ve ever tasted. So was the avocado. It was actually a very filling meal and all the ingredients mixed flawlessly. 

The reason I can&#39;t give five stars is because of the service. Our server was so short with us and took forever to bring our check. We almost felt ignored the whole time.

We had the bread and 1/2 dozen oysters for appetizers. Bread was interesting. Some kind of potato bread. It&#39;s crispy on the outside, soft and moist in the inside. It had an interesting but good taste to it. It also comes with butter, which did not really taste like butter. It was somewhat salted with a light butter taste....almost like diet butter...if there was such a thing. Menu says it&#39;s cultured butter...not sure what that means. It glided on the bread smoothly and it was actually pretty good. The oysters were fresh.

For entree, we ordered the pork chops and the icelandic cod. The pork chops were yummyyy. It was cooked and flavored well. I would recommend getting this if you come. Every bite I took bought a smile to my face. The apple slices bought a nice sweet and tart flavor to the dish.
For the Icelandic cod, instead of garbanzo beans, they replaced it with peas that night. Fish was soft. The sauce tasted pretty good, with olives. There were little slices of chorizo on the plate which were pretty hard. I didn&#39;t really like them. Overall, the dish was ok. Unless you drenched it with the sauce, the fish itself didn&#39;t have much flavor.

For dessert, we ordered the chocolate s&#39;more. The combination of the sorbet and the Chocolate smore was pretty weird at first but eventually I got used to eating the slightly sour sorbet with the chocolate, and it was actually pretty good.

The only way to describe our Saturday is this:

&#34;Well, um, actually a pretty nice little Saturday, we&#39;re going to Home Depot. Yeah, buy some wallpaper, maybe get some flooring, stuff like that. Maybe Bed, Bath, and Beyond, I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll have enough time&#34;

Old married people problems that had us end up at West Elm, a new bed set and onward we went to Atrium DUMBO.

Upon walking in, we noticed there was a small wait for large groups but we were seated immediately at the chef&#39;s table, which was weird at first but totally cool toward the end.

The restaurant itself it super attractive inside including the living wall which just pops of color the moment you walk in. 

We were seated and given the run of the mill water and received the our menus, it was brunch (since brunch lasts forever in this town on the weekends).

My husband and I both ordered the Croque Monsieur with an egg and my husband a coffee.

It was very interesting to watch the staff cook and like I said ended up being informative and entertaining. Smart, it was smart too. It made you watch them cook different dishes and by the end vow to come back to try at least 5-6 of them.

The dish itself was DELICIOUS! The bread was super crispy, with a creamy bechamel sauce, salty ham, and a massive amount of cheese. To be personally, I think the bechamel needed more salt but I don&#39;t hold this to the restaurant since I&#39;m a salt-o-phile and they most likely assume that the ham and cheese salt will be enough. It came with a well dressed and seasoned field green side salad. My husbands coffee was served with the meal and for the bargain price of $3.50, I thought was amazingly expensive but when in NY, right?

We came here in a group of 8 to celebrate one of our best friends birthday and with all the good reviews on yelp we were super excited, I give them the fact that the interior decor was just as described other than that the food was horrible.

It tastes like a fusion of Italian and Asian gone very wrong. I got the chitarra pasta while the pasta was cooked al dente the sauce and pork sausage with cooked scallions did not sit well. I ended up throwing out all the pork sausage and making my way to eat some of the noodles. I also tried the Rigatoni which had the lobster and it was just soft and mushy. Really did not enjoy the meal whatsoever. The menu is one page very small with not many options. That did not bother me as much as the fact that it didn&#39;t taste good. I will never come back.

Wine was reasonable at the standard range of 10-14 dollars a glass but it wasn&#39;t a good full bodied red that I wanted,,,. The service was horrible... Waiter was awkwardly antisocial, he also managed to hit my head with a plate when he bent over my head while holding dishes in his left hand to grab another dish, oddly I don&#39;t think he knew he hit me in the head. 

The desert selection was very small, and nothing that appealed to the eye after a horrible dinner. They rushed us out and handed is the check before we even finished eating. How rude? Before he even asked if we wanted desert. Hands down with the prices they charge(outrageous) they should bring the standard of food to the next level.

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE NEVER AGAIN."

There&#39;s always that place where you will always have the greatest time just talking and having conversations with your friends and this was just not one of them. 

The waiter continued to fill our cups of water over our head to the point where it was just annoying. He even hit one of my friends on the head with a plate while thinking he was this big awesome guy trying to carry more than one plate. He also brought out CHECKS BEFORE WE WERE DONE WITH OUR FOOD!! On top of that he offered to take a picture of the group and deliberately took them blurry. Very rude man. 

The rigatoni with lobster, tomato, and basil was OKAY. Definitely not worth the price. (Nothing there was worth the price.) This is just an overpriced place because of where it is located. The wine wasn&#39;t even as special as they presented it when I asked what was good. 

I would personally never go back there or recommend it to anyone. Unless you&#39;re okay with overpriced bland food and rude wait staff. Not memorable at all."

We were looking for a casual yet polished spot with dog-friendly outdoor seating and Atrium fit the bill!

I was psyched from the minute I saw the menu; this restaurant clearly cares about fresh, well-crafted food. 

We ordered the branzino, cod, homemade bread (you have to pay for it but it&#39;s worth it) and several glasses of ros√© (don&#39;t judge me). Both the branzino and cod were light and flavorful. I preferred the cod because you just can&#39;t beat that chorizo flavor. 

Our server was extremely doting and kind -- even when our typically well-behaved dog decided to bark at some other dogs walking by. Sorry!

Four Stars

This is where you want to eat on a sunny afternoon in DUMBO. There is seating outside, decent cocktails, and healthy-ish food. We sat outside out of the direct sunlight. I had the Cobb Salad ($12) and Tiffany had Arugula Salad ($12+ $6 Shrimp). The waiter was personable.   The Lemon and Lavender soda ($4.5) was quite goodThe plating was nice. The food was good but lackluster. The Cobb was expensive for what you get. The romaine was fresh but roughly cut. The avocado came in one big quarter piece. The bacon came in big spiraling pieces. The two half pieces of hard boiled was done very well. The tomatoes were halved and tasted great. There was no chicken because it was add-on. There was no cheese, no corn, and the dressing was dill flavored. The arugula salad had Ricotta Salata, Cucumber, Tomato, and bunch of Lemon Vinaigrette.  The Butterflied Shrimp were big plump and tasty. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and experience."

Decor and ambiance is really nice and the kitchen is open so you can see what&#39;s going on. The menu had a good variety of meat &amp; vegetarian dishes so it was perfect for our Sunday brunch. 

We got the smoked salmon and speck crostinis...delicious! The salmon was buttery and I loved that the capers were fried...so different and tasty. The speck was also really good, some fatty pieces but overall tasty. The gazpacho was perfect and refreshing and had a nice spice to it. And finally we got the french toast which is pretty much dessert...it came with sour cream which sounds odd but tastes great and a blueberry compote type of thing.

The only downside was the non-alcoholic drink. We got the lemonade and for the price it wasn&#39;t anything great and it seemed watered down a bit too much."

Before you even enter the restaurant, feast your eyes on the massive, imposing super structure of the Manhattan Bridge. (Do it for the snap maybe?).  The main floor is pretty wide and has a cutaway view to the kitchen. It&#39;s also got this awesome looking greenery along one wall and some elevated table seating.  

We arrived on time and were seated on the upper level overlooking the main floor and its beautiful vertical garden. Just behind our table was a wall full of cases of wine bottles which perfectly complemented the wood aesthetic elements.  We didn&#39;t sample the lunch fare but instead went with brunch.  I had the steak with scrambled eggs (I can&#39;t do eggs Benedict or sunny side up. Don&#39;t ask me why). Everything was awesome!

There was about 12 chips. Really??? I eat more than that in one handful. The food was tasty but not worth the price.

My friends ordered the muscles and they smelled amazing...they said they tasted amazing too!

I ordered the Bronzino served with zucchini and  squash...the first bite of fish tasted over salted. But then I cut up the veggies and mixed a piece of fish onto my fork and it was PERFECT!  The dish is definitely intended to be eaten mixed together.  If you eat just the fish alone it would be salty, and if the veggies alone they would be bland,..but mixed together My palette was pleasantly delighted! 

The desert donuts were ok...I hated the caramel dipping sauce.  Would recommend getting something else if you want desert.

I made reservations for two over the phone and informed the hostess that I was proposing prior to my arrival and asked him if I can be seated upstairs because I heard it was a more romantic setting. He was upfront with me and told me he couldn&#39;t promise it would be available but he will try. 
            After celebrating my new engagement I actually arrived 25 minutes late of my reservation time AND informed the hostess i had another couple with us that obviously wasn&#39;t planned and asked if it would be a problem seeing that my reservation was only for two. The hostess handled it quickly and very professionally. He said it wasn&#39;t a problem and the four of us can be seated in 10 minutes and in my desired upstairs section. That dude saved the day for me. 
             Once we got seated the manager was notified of our special occasion and gave us a bottle of champagne on the house.

Beef Tartare was quite good, not the usual where they mix it table side, but it was yummy. 

Icelandic Cod was wonderful! Although I thought the mushrooms and the Consomme were a tad too salty. The scallion looks pretty as a whole stalk but makes it kind of annoying to eat. Just saying.

Go to ATrium Dumbo and have a great experience. Period. Don&#39;t get me started on the 1 star review that is obviously a mistake when she says everything is great. 

I came for dinner last night and figured I should write a review.
I&#39;ve been coming here off and on, since they opened. The Chef&#39;s food is exquisitely prepared, lunch or dinner. The service is wonderful and not too intrusive, but attentive and knowledgeable. 

We drank Wine...alot. Simply put Alex the Master Sommelier has put together one of the most well thought out, and expertly crafted wine lists...anywhere. A college kid can go and have an amazing glass of wine for $13 with his girlfriend, and a Wall Streeter who knows nothing about wine but wants to impress someone can order a delicious vintage bottle at $240 and up. Everyone and anyone can enjoy wine here.

What we ate (4PPL):
Starters for the table: Oysters , 3 Cheeses and 3 Meats

Mains: NY STRIP (2) one of the finest cuts I&#39;ve ever had, seared and cooked to a beautiful Med-rare w/ Charred Romaine that was absolutely devine. It came with thick cut Pomme Frites that were light and fluffy as well. The au poivre sauce, piping hot, was served over the meat as it was placed on the table.

Smoked Duck with tons of flavor and crispy skin, again, cooked to perfection. Served with veggies and a spring roll made of duck meat.

Lobster Rigatoni. I don&#39;t think I need to explain how wonderful this was. My son had the App version and it was perfect for him.

As a side to our Mains we ordered Lobster Mac &amp; Cheese, and Roasted Cauliflower. I have to admit the cauliflower was so delicious we all stopped eating our mains and ate the cauliflower first. It was that good. The M&amp;C was great too. 

For dessert we had expertly made espressos and we couldn&#39;t pass up the pumpkin tart which dissolved in your mouth and made you scream for more.

The technique and execution of the cooking, and plating are so exquisite that the chef deserves a nod and a wave before you leave. You won&#39;t soon forget a trip to Atrium, and you&#39;ll want to come back. 

If you come Thursday thru Saturday for dinner you&#39;ll need a reservation.

PS: Brunch is crazy, always packed. Make a reservation. Service is spotty but usually you&#39;re not in a rush for brunch anyway.
 &amp; Happy Hour - Great Specials.   Basically, just go and make up your own mind."

Everyone went out of their way to make sure, as a single diner, that I had a wonderful experience. I was seated at the chef&#39;s counter with a full view of the kitchen.

I ordered a glass of Sicilian red and Brady the Som poured me a sample of the white from the same vineyard as a treat. Oysters from RI started me off, super clean, cold and fresh. The sea bass main was great. I finished off with the, &#34;not to be missed&#34; S&#39;more dessert. The whole time I was able to watch a well oiled kitchen ply their craft with a highly dedicated and talented chef leading the brigade. 

Atrium is on a cobblestone side street that transforms you from glass and concret NY to old brick and stone."

This place was beautifully decorated, great for a girls night or a date. Both indoor and outdoor seating. Cocktails average $13 and for the quality and portions of food, prices were definitely reasonable. Everything below was shared between two people and was definitely sufficient to fill our bellies.

Appetizer - Hand-cut Beef Tartare - Perfectly cut with a nice kick from what seemed like a mustard dressing but don&#39;t quote me on the that! Good portion to share, accompanied by two crispy baguette slices.

Pasta - Rigatoni (MC) -  delicious, fresh. Good portion of lobster and the sauce was just perfectly made

Side- Corn &amp; Jalapeno Gratin - Sweet corn was on point with a nice subtle spice from the jalapeno. Two thumbs up.

Main - Smoked L.I. Duck - I won&#39;t lie that I was at first apprehensive about the duck as duck is usually accompanied/slathered with something ridiculously sweet that completely annihilates the taste of the duck. This dish was the complete opposite. IT WAS AMAZING. Beautifully smoked, coated with charred skin. Cooked to the perfect temperature with a light sweet fresh sauce. Loved it. Satisfies both the sweet and savory components I would say.

Overall: Go"

Starter- The oysters were not properly cleaned and I could feel relatively large bits of the shell in the meat. 

Main- While the sear of the steak was on point, there was no flavor in the meat and it tasted like a cut of beef that perhaps needed to be cleaned better. Due to the lack of seasoning, that taste of excrement was pretty noticeable and definitely not palatable. The only redeemable part of this dish were the potatoes which unfortunately only had seasoning on half of them. 

The dessert and drinks weren&#39;t terrible, but the technical issues with the meat overall ruined my perception of the Atrium."

The restaurant had not too long ago open and was quickly filling up. We were seated upstairs and had a nice view of the open kitchen and the downstairs dining area. The ambience and decor is very lovely, romantic and perfect for a date night or special occasion it seems. 

Food: 
Overall the food was delicious! Nice mix of American and French flare. We ordered the bread and muscles for starters and both were great. The muscles served well for two and the creamy sauce was to die for. We actually asked for more toast to enjoy some more of the sauce after the muscles were finished and this was no issue to do. 

For main course, we shared the chicken pot pie (though we usually shy away from chicken dinners when out) and it was delicious. The dish is served in two parts - the two breast halved and the remainder of the chicken parts cooked with veggies in the actual pot pie. The chicken was cooked perfectly tender (even with a crispy skin!) and very well seasoned. I could have done with the side wedges as they were a bit too crispy and didn&#39;t compliment the meal that well for me. 

Service: 
Our waiter and other staff were very warm, friendly and attentive. Our water glasses were always filled and if we needed something a staff member was not too far away. 

Overall great experience and would definitely return."

I wanted this to be delicious and amazing - but the service and attitude of the staff really put a damper on what otherwise would have been a good place for brunch (although a little overpriced/over-hyped).  The location/view is lovely though.  

My sister and noticed it was crowded - numerous folks waiting for a table - so we said we&#39;d be happy to sit at the bar, or outside, or a table - whichever was easiest (generally - we&#39;re easy to please).  So they sat us outside - great!  We ordered and then it started to rain - a lot.  So we pulled our table under the awning (about a foot difference).  Our waiter - with barely disguised contempt explained to us like we were small children that we needed to move our table back out into the rain so that they could have at least three feet between tables - fire code.  Okay - I can respect that - but even after moving the table there was still about 4 feet in between them. He stated he could &#34;try&#34; and get us a table inside if we wanted and then proceeded to turn on his heel and leave before we could ever answer the question.  

So - I thought, okay dude is having a bad day - I&#39;ll just go ask myself.  So I patiently waited for the host to be free and explained the situation - to which he said &#34;I&#39;ll see what I can do, but when people ask to be outside on a rainy day and it starts to rain I can&#39;t guarantee it.&#34;  Seriously???  I didn&#39;t&#39; &#34;ask&#34; to be there - I offered to make his life easier.  Best part - there were at LEAST 10 open tables (upstairs - you couldn&#39;t see them from the desk when you walked in).  Ten.  To top it off - when they did find us a table inside our first waiter accused my sister of stealing the lid to the sugar (seriously  - who wants a lid to a container!!!).  He asked my sister if she knew where the lid to the sugar went (they brought sugar for her coffee without a lid on the container).  And when she responded that none was initially brought he looked at her and rolled his eyes.  So making the customer feel bad seems to be their M.O.  One redeeming note on the service - the waiter upstairs was quite nice, and responsive (although he didn&#39;t come by the table more than once after the food was served to check on things - would have been useful, but we were pretty pleased with his work overall!)

So the food.  I ordered the brussels sprouts and the homemade biscuits.  Both were good.  The sprouts had an apple bacon flavor which was good.  The biscuits I really wanted to love, but I&#39;d give them a 7 of about 10 - solidly good, not great.  They serve it with a homemade blueberry &#34;jam&#34; - more like sauce.  it was tasty, but needed a bit more body, or a spoon to serve it with (honey would have been amazing with the biscuits - I would have asked for a spoon or honey - but no one case back during the meal, except to check on it right after it was delivered and I hadn&#39;t yet tasted the biscuits).  My sister ordered the crostini w/ ricotta and prosciutto - probably the best of the things we ordered - it was really delicious, if not a bit pricy for one slice of bread with cheese, honey and a slice of prosciutto on it ($10).  She also had the deviled eggs - again, good, not great. 

All in all - I wanted to like it - I really I did. (we spent hours hunting online for a great brunch spot near the bridge) But the abysmal/conceited service along with food that was good, not great - I won&#39;t be back."

Aesthetics is lovely, any minimalist would appreciate it. Open kitchen, thank you I have a view of the cute chef. Service- amazing, my waiter was super friendly. 

Food. NY Strip (aged)- Cooked perfectly, probably not the best quality (I&#39;ve been spoiled dating someone who owned a steakhouse) but I ate all of it, including the fat... I&#39;m so excited there&#39;s a place to grab a steak now in Dumbo. The pomme lyonnaise and bone marrow and swiss chard were perfect compliments.

Escargot- Serve in bowl with sliced mushrooms and butte garlic sauce; I like my in shells; didnt need the other stuff. (Didn&#39;t serve it with croutons or bread so we asked and they happily obliged)

Beef tartare - not the melt in your mouth I prefer, meat was firm and wanted to taste more shallot and feel the texture of yolk - it&#39;s a clean tartare i guess, I want a dirty one- gooey, lots of flavor, etc

Brussel sprouts with bacon- tasted heavily of butter (but I&#39;m a fan of butter), bacon is cubed itty bitty, so it more like bacon bits but soft... when i eat bacon, i like it in larger portions so it can play in my mouth.

Management- runs a tight ship, dressed to the nine.

I will definitely be coming here more often though."

Deviled Eggs: There were about 5 of them.  They were good. About par.
Smoked Salmon Crostini: I liked this dish. Most places, the smoked flavor overtakes the taste buds, this had a hint of it. I enjoyed this one a lot.
Buttermilk Biscuits: I enjoyed this with the butter and jam and my coffee. The coffee there was strong and I enjoyed it with these biscuits. Another point for the biscuits.
soup of the day: tomato gazpacho? I can&#39;t remember the exact name. It was a chilled soup.  It was different at first, but then you keep on eating it and it grows on you.  It had a punch to it, like the dressing on a cold cut sandwich?!?! I liked it.

Overall Impression:
The atmosphere was nice. It was a beautiful place. The food was probably some of the best I&#39;ve had in NYC so far.  Every dish was good, which is difficult. It was a chilly morning and the AC was blasting. We happened to sit under the draft (they said they lowered the AC, but it kept on running).  Other than this minor hiccup, the place is nice.

Maybe it was quieter than usual due to the holiday, but DUMBO was calm and serene that morning and Atrium was a beautiful and welcoming place to sit outside and enjoy the amazing weather we were having.

I arrived early and had my pick of stools by the bar inside. As others have mentioned the interior is lush and gorgeous, very clean and modern. However the weather that day was too nice to sit indoors. The bartender offered me a glass of water while I waited, which was a nice touch. You might think this is a given, but I have waited at many other bars inside restaurants where the staff didn&#39;t so much as take a second look at me.

My friend and I kept it simple by both ordering egg dishes (she the scrambled eggs with charred kale, tomato, and sausage, and I the omelette with ham, mushroom, and gruyere) and were not disappointed. My omelette was fluffy, cooked perfectly, and came with a side of simple greens and toasted baguette. The salad was very generic, but light and tasty. Although my friend&#39;s eggs did not come with any toast, our waitress gladly brought some out for her as well.

We ordered the Steak and Eggs and Chicken and Waffles with coffee and fresh squeezed OJ. EVERYTHING was delicious and pleasing to the eye. The steak comes with cheddar polenta and a sunny side up egg. The waffles come with tender, well-seasoned chicken. The OJ tasted fresh squeezed and the coffee was strong.

Since we have few choices in DUMBO, I TRIED to like Atrium. But repeated wrong orders, poorly-prepared orders (e.g., a burnt tiny slab of cold, greasy fish) and overall indifference and/or rudeness of staff became so intolerable that I&#39;d rather stay home or order take-out than drop $200+ for dinner (or drinks) at this place. 
The last time I went--last weekend--one of the staff opening the door for customers shouted &#34;YOU&#39;RE WELCOME&#34; bc apparently customers didn&#39;t kiss his ass enough while he held the door.
If it weren&#39;t for the captive audience upstairs and across the street in restaurant-less DUMBO, this place surely wouldn&#39;t survive. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s SOMEthing good here (some good servers and bartenders, for example), but for a supposed fine-dining restaurant, these things (YOU&#39;RE WELCOME!) should never be happening.
To be avoided."

Walk the Brooklyn bridge &amp; watch the sunset?  check.  

Take a bunch of pictures, be really cute and hang a lock on the bridge.  check

Trust yelp to find you a great restaurant in Dumbo?  CHECK.

Great staff....every one was super friendly as soon as we walked in.  Not as big of a place as I thought it looked in pictures, but adorable.  

We ordered 2 drinks  - cucumber &amp; agave - tasty...and something else with Pimm&#39;s &amp; cucumber which was equally as good.  

Started with a meat &amp; cheese board.  My GF is all about that and I literally couldn&#39;t even get the cheese pronunciation correct.  She took the lead and ordered 3 of each with the help of our server.  We also got the warm smoked bread which is totally worth the $3. 

I&#39;m no meat/cheese connoisseur, so I don&#39;t have much to compare it to, but I loved mixing combos with little pickles, jam, seedy mustard...it was off to a great start!

The mussels?! OMG.  SO GOOD.  The sauce was almost a little creamy - but SO light.  And the mussels were big, which usually makes them chewy, but LITERALLY melted in your mouth.  How did they do it?  TEACH ME.  

For an entr√©e we split the pasta with rock shrimp &amp; jalapeno with a side of kale.  Mixed that kale right into the pasta &amp; it was freakin&#39; delicious.  My GF isn&#39;t even a fan of pasta, and she loved it.  

When we were walking out the sweet gentlemen at the front desk told us that there was an awesome view of the city just steps away.   You would never guess it - kind of a hidden gem.  There were rocks and a small beach with the view of city lights.
HELLO ROMANCE.  

So basically, I ate a great meal, impressed my GF, and you should too."

the food was just OK.  i expected a lot more.  the seafood plate was fine, but the shrimp were tiny and kind of shriveled.  the scallops were yummy, but overpriced for the size of the plate.  honestly, the best part of the meal was the cauliflower and that is kind of sad.  the lobster pasta was so oily and had about two pieces of lobster.  

the place IS lovely and in a great spot in dumbo right near the water front...food and service whateves.

As far as cocktails,  one time they had a last word that was featured as drink of the day. They have an excellent drink that has pepper on the rim. It gives the drink a good spice.

If you go to DUMBO, you gotta go here. 

I came with 2 friends with no reservations and got to sit at &#34;the bar&#34;, which was even better because I got to see first hand what the chef did. 

SALMON CRUDO: apple, cucumber, parsley, salmon roe. Such a simple dish, yet complex in flavors. Loved it. 

SMOKED L.I. DUCK: radish, plum, orange, wild flower honey. SOOOOOO GOOOOOD! Perfect duck. 

My friend had the pork chop which was also amazing. 

I also got a non-alcoholic drink, honey &amp; passionfruit soda, and that was really good.

It&#39;s a one time visit kind of a place. Great for a meal and a stroll in the Brooklyn Bridge Park. PS happy hour oysters are by the bar only. I was told they only accept cash?

However I think that eating at a restaurant is an experience and simply having good food isn&#39;t enough. 
The food was okay, nothing great, slightly over priced but it&#39;s New York so whatever. 
The thing that bothered me the most was the service. The server that me and my boyfriend had gotten was so horrible and SOOOOO impolite that he totally killed our mood. We wanted to get wine and enjoy our food but the server made us so feel so uncomfortable that we just wanted to eat our food and leave as fast as we could. 
We also felt that the waiter was nice to people around us, like answering questions about the menu and such to the people sitting around us but to us he barely spoke 2 words. I felt very discriminated for some reason and i never feel like this. His attitude was so bad that the only time he was polite and said &#34;thank you&#34; was when he brought our check.. like really? Idk maybe he was just having a bad day but his bad day translated into a waste of time and money for us. 
Bad experience. Hopefully it was just us that the waiter had a problem with. 
I can say for sure that I will never be coming back or recommending this place to anyone I know and that is all thanks to one lousy waiter."

In such a cute nice park of Brooklyn right by the water. Defoe is so beautiful and open yet intimate. Staff was super friendly and down to earth in only the way Brooklyn people can be. Food was fantastic - even simple things like their bread and butter and salad took it to the next level. It was $20+ main course but very much worth it and their huge wine selection allowed us to find a $30 bottle! Almost got five stars... In fact it could be a five...It was just a little slow our night. Such such a lovely find.

The ambience is very charming and unique (especially compared to other French-American restaurants that have way overdone the bistro or fake rustic thing).  Plus, the open plan kitchen was also very nice - and Chef Laurent is quite the hottie, hehe ;) We came here on a Friday night with an OpenTable reservation, but you really could walk off the street and get a table as well.

Service: Overall, they nailed the concept of gourmet food with a beautiful setting and casual vibe. The staff was very warm and friendly, from start to finish - although the server we had seemed to be new and our appetizers arrived before our drinks (which he apologized for). Otherwise, the pace of service was perfect. 

Drinks: I absolutely loved the DUMBO Daisy - a really fresh, classic pale pink cocktail that was definitely worthy of Daisy Buchanan. The Maple &amp; Rye had a wonderful touch of citrus to balance the maple sweetness - a fine drink, but not as good as the Daisy.

Appetizers: The duarde crudo was probably one of the most memorable appetizers I&#39;ve ever had! The fish was perfectly seasoned and prepared, and the way the celery was presented as little wisps - well, I will never look at that vegetable the same way again! I really could eat a whole bowl of this and be completely satisfied. We also ordered the homemade potato bread and cultured butter, but were unimpressed by the size of the bread (we wanted potato bread, not bread the size of an actual potato)! The butter was VERY delicious, but this appetizer was barely enough for two people - more than two people and you will each basically have one bite of bread.  

Entrees: My husband had the rock shrimp/jalape√±o tagliatelle and absolutely loved it. I had the smoked duck, and it was probably one of the best duck dishes I&#39;ve had in my life (and I pretty much order duck every chance I get)! The only thing is that some of the string beans were not that great (kind of chewy), but this was very minor compared to the amazingly rendered duck skin and fat :)

Desserts: Desserts were probably the weakest part of the meal. The brioche donuts were meh. I was curious because of the &#34;sour&#34; cinnamon sugar, but it just reminded me of the sour sanding used on packaged candies (i.e. Sour Patch Kids, etc.). The cheesecake was good, but more like canoli cream inside a chocolate shell (not in a bad way, just unexpected).

Overall, this is a great spot, but there were definitely both hits and misses. I would definitely come back for brunch or in a different season to try other dishes."

Pros: Great atmosphere, similar to that of a speak easy with old glamorous mirrors, large chandeliers, fireplace,etc.

I like the way the space is designed.  However, when it is crowded, the layout is not conducive to flow.  If you are not at a table (meaning you&#39;re at the bar) there&#39;s not a really good place to stand without having to constantly move to let servers by or let people get to the restroom.

The beer selection is small but decent with some solid craft favorites.  Cocktails looked good.  

It was crowded the night I went and in general, it would take me about 15 minutes to get a beer.  The bartenders do an exceptional job of avoiding eye contact so you can pretty much feel ignored while you&#39;re waiting.  But you can&#39;t talk to your friends because then you might miss the split second they look up.  

That said, the bartender I dealt with was nice, he was just slammed.  If you are going to offer craft cocktails, you need to staff accordingly.  They did a good job on those drinks but they are time consuming to make and meanwhile your are losing money on your beer drinking customers who you could serve in 30 seconds."

I met up with a friend one weeknight after work here. It looked SUPER crowded, but it turned out there was a group celebrating a birthday who were front &#39;n&#39; center, but just past them there was ample space. We grabbed a table, headed to the bar to get drinks and a menu, and chatted while we waited for my hubby to arrive.

They have a respectable, though certainly not huge, selection of bottled/canned/tap beers and cocktails. The menu is pretty limited, but I had A Cheese Delight (as did my meat-lover of a husband, actually) and was super content with that. The sandwiches were $12 a pop. Draft beers were $7-$8 each.

We were there for about 2 1/12 hours and spent around $60. We ordered everything, food included, at the bar and had it put on our card, which we left with the bartender. Drinks were served quickly at the bar and we brought them back to our table. Food was brought to our table within about 15 minutes of ordering.

One of my first forays into the LIC bar scene, and I mistakenly try to go for one of the more popular establishments here in LIC through yelp.

I leave and make my way to the Beast next door, and was instantly drawn to this place as it was sparsely populated, small and quaint/picturesque, and just looked super casual and cool. I was instantly impressed with the vibe and was even more impressed with the prices as they were definitely a lot lower than what I&#39;m used to. 

The cheese plate at 6 dollars was extremely generous and delicious as they paired it really nicely with venison charcuterie and apples. The drinks were extremely strong and undiluted, as I had two and I was already feeling buzzed.

Nestled amidst the new construction of Queensboro Plaza, The Beast Next Door has a cool, rustic, semi-upscale vibe. I would recommend this place for pre-dinner drinks, but definitely not a place I&#39;d want to stay into the morning. At a hefty price-tag of $12 for a specialty cocktail, I hoped that the bartender (a female bartender serving on 6/14/16 around 7:30pm) knew how to make an Old-Fashioned cocktail- nothing fancy. First off, she served me an Old-Fashioned without a cherry. And, when I asked for a cherry, she dipped her fingers into a refrigerated jar of black cherries. Who drinks an Old-Fashioned with a black cherry? Maraschino cherry, get it right!

Because an Old-Fashioned was clearly too complex to make, I decided to try one of their specialty cocktails hoping at least they would get their own drinks right. For my second drink, I ordered the &#34;Gold Crush&#34; cocktail which is bourbon, honey, lemon, and fresh mint. I should have known from the ingredients that this was going to taste like a home remedy for the cold/flu. This was not good. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to tell if the same bartender had made this one correctly, but if she did then it is something I would not order again. So, why did I start my review saying that this would be a decent place for pre-dinner drinks? If you&#39;re sticking around the neighborhood, I think the ambiance is nice and if you usually order very simple drinks (e.g. vodka soda, whiskey coke, gin and tonic, etc.) then I&#39;m 90% confident that your drink order won&#39;t get messed up. Just remember, an Old-Fashioned is not considered a simple drink to make, at least for The Beast Next Door."

They brought the cocktails out and hurriedly left them on the table next to us without explaining which was which, so we had to try and guess. The cocktails were just a bit strange. None of us really felt that the cocktails tasted how we expected them to taste based on the menu descriptions (we ordered Winter Rose, Gold Crush, and a pineapple rye drink). We still hadn&#39;t figured out who should get which drink after tasting all three!

The charcuterie plate took maybe 30-45 minutes to come out, and it was just some pieces of sliced cheese, three grapes, three olives, and a small serving of prosciutto. 

The company was great, but I really don&#39;t think I would be coming back here. Come on, Beast, find your beauty."

The decor is nice and I get that there isn&#39;t a whole lot else in the area. Nevertheless, our experience was kind of crazy, so I wouldn&#39;t encourage anyone to go there."

For the kitchen being so limited, they did a great job and the food was solid.  Cheese was delicious and we got WAY more than I would have ever hoped.  If that is what they can do with limited resources, I would love to see what they pull out with a full kitchen sometime.

Really cool-looking place tucked away in a corner of Long Island City -- makes you feel like you&#39;ve discovered a treasure because the area is otherwise pretty seedy. The menu is very limited but we really liked the cheese platter. The funny thing is, I thought my drink was weird -- tasted like straight bourbon despite the fact that the menu described something much more complex. The bartender was very nice and let me trade it in for a glass of wine (no way was I going to drink it) so the only reason I mention this is because I see another reviewer (Rose K.) had the same reaction -- the bar drinks  are a little disappointing, all things considered.

If you&#39;re going to advertise in nearby apartment buildings that you will be showing Sunday NFL games, you should probably do something to cater to football fans. Dimming the lights, lighting candles, playing Bob Dylan, and having ONE TV in the whole bar/restaurant, doesn&#39;t really cut it.  You need real food, more beers on tap, and a clientele that actually wants to watch football. You suckered me in with your ad, but I drank one beer and bolted.

- Crab claws:  This was ok.  It came with 4 claws - each claw was about a mouthful.  For the price (8), i would skip it next time!

I had the lobster roll with a cup of New England clam chowder and a side of Cape Cod potato chips. My friend had the same but with the crab roll and we ended up splitting both sandwiches. I had never had a crab roll before, but I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was. If this is your first time here though, definitely get the classic lobster roll though.

Tried their $24 Taste of Maine which was 1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 crab roll, 1/2 shrimp roll, two crab claws with cocktail sauce, pickle, coleslaw and a drink.   

I enjoyed all 3 rolls, but the lobster roll definitely stood out.   Now I&#39;m not a fan of mayo based lobster roll, but this definitely wasn&#39;t.     The slaw was just so so though, I should&#39;ve gotten the bag of chips...but I thought I would be &#34;healthy&#34; and get some veggies in....yeah...a mistake.  :-P  

Now next time, I&#39;m definitely going for the Lobster roll and nothing else.   They have friendly staff, and when your order is ready they will go out and find you.   Unfortunately by the time we got our food we couldn&#39;t sit down to eat it because of torrential storms...but that&#39;s not Luke&#39;s Lobster&#39;s fault.

However, like other Yelpers, I&#39;ve noticed that they stopped including the Jonah crab claws with these so that&#39;s why they lose a star. Bring back the crab claws!

While the lobster, crab, and shrimp rolls get the most attention from fans of this place, I got to tell you that if you haven&#39;t tried their clam chowder, you are missing out! I figured it was going to be like most chowders that are mostly potato with chewy pieces of clam...Their chowder is chock full of tender pieces of clam and the tiny size of the diced potatoes really lets the other flavors shine. At $6 for the small, it&#39;s not the cheapest cup of chowder you&#39;ll ever have, but it may very well be one of the best."

What we liked: 
- We are share-ers. We LOVED that they had the option to purchase a trio of 1/2 rolls.

Their new menu now lists that you can get a 1/2 shrimp roll, 1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 crab roll and 2 crab claws, drinks, chips and pickle or slaw for 24 bucks. Not a bad deal. Just into a single Lobster roll? It&#39;ll run you $17. 

The only complaint is that they are a bit small, but for fresh seafood you get what you pay for. My advice is to stop at this spot, split the trio, and then move onto something else. There is always more food to eat in NYC!"

The special SEASONING IS AMAZING, ugh I&#39;m gonna ask for double of that next time. Love that there&#39;s very little mayo - let&#39;s the fresh seafood shine. Finally, I never imagined WHITE BREAD could taste SO GOOD - perfectly toasted, a light crunch as you bite into soft buttery lobster with ultra seasoning, it&#39;s love. 

Portions are small and prices are expensive $$, normal people could eat 2 rolls, some of us (cough cough... me) could eat 3!!! Haha :)

We got the combination that gives you a crab roll, shrimp roll and lobster roll. I thought the price was fair. Seafood is never cheap, so it is what it is. 

All three rolls tasted overwhelmingly of Old Bay and not much else. My wife said that the quality is all right, but it seemed like not much care had been taken in preparation. She found a large piece of shell in her sandwich and mentioned that it hadn&#39;t been de-veined. I&#39;m not really familiar with that, but, um, gross.

Everything is really good.  I&#39;ve had the lobster roll, shrimp roll, and crab roll. I think lobster is always going to be my favorite, but it&#39;s nice to have other options. I&#39;ve also had the lobster grilled cheese in the winter, and on my most recent visit I had the Kale and Tail bowl. It was really good, and nice to have a little bit healthier option! I also like how they offer the Taste of Maine and Noah&#39;s Ark, so you can sample more than one thing. 

As far as pricing, I think it&#39;s pretty reasonable for a lobster roll in NYC. Like I said it&#39;s not somewhere I&#39;m going to go for lunch every day, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s crazy expensive for what it is.  Their lobster rolls are also really good.  They aren&#39;t drowned in mayo, so you can really taste the lobster, and you get big chunks of it!  The roll isn&#39;t huge, but it&#39;s filled well. The space here is nice too.  Lots of seating inside, and they did have seating outside, but when I was here last they were doing construction, so hopefully that&#39;ll be done by summer time!   

Overall I think Luke&#39;s is def one of my favorite places to go for lobster rolls, and this location is really perfect for me!  They also have happy hour, which sounds great, so one day I hope to make it over there for that."

Luke&#39;s Lobster also focuses on sustainability and updates their signs to let you know where the lobster came from.  You can go to different locations in one weekend and see that the lobsters they have in each store is different than the other. Yes, I went there two consecutive days.. but different locations.

They also have a great deal for happy hour.  I believe it&#39;s from 4-7pm every day and it&#39;s 50% off drinks or something.

If you don&#39;t drink alcohol, try the lemonades, ginger ales, etc drinks they have available! Very tasty!

As a side, I got a small clam chowder which was also to my liking, not in the least lacking in meat.

I went back to Luke&#39;s Lobster (earlier this time!) to sit down &amp; give it another try while fresh.....and it was AMAZING! It tasted SO much better when the bread was crispy and toasty! The taste of the lobster meat came through so much better when it&#39;s light on the seasoning... and this time I added Sriracha for a little kick. I didn&#39;t want the lobster roll to end! I&#39;m so happy I gave them another chance because now whenever I&#39;m in the neighborhood I have a great, affordable lobster joint to satisfy my cravings! I appreciate their staff being so friendly too. Sarah and Ali are both really nice! If you&#39;re craving a lobster roll while in Midtown..come here! You won&#39;t regret it! 5 Stars!!!!!


I saw a picture posted on Instagram of Luke&#39;s Lobster rolls and I had to go and try it. They close at 9 and I got there at 8:55, so I had to order take out. I ordered the Lobster Roll Combo (1 Lobster Roll, 1 Pickle, 1 Soda, 1 side of Chips or Cole slaw). I chose the cold slaw but they didn&#39;t have any, so the nice girl gave me a free Clam Chowder (WHICH WAS TO DIE FOR!) &amp; and chips. The entire 20 minutes on my train ride home I was practically salivating thinking about my dinner. Turns out the lobster roll was only okay. It seriously just tasted like bread and heavily seasoned lobster...something I could&#39;ve made at home. The sandwich is made cold, which was different since I have only eaten lobster warm. I would go back and order the Clam Chowder, but I would be quite okay never spending $20 on their Lobser Roll ever again. I&#39;m giving them 4 Stars for having delicious clam chowder."

It was a good choice. We ordered the Lobster, Shrimp, and Crab Rolls to try all three. We also got the New England Clam Chowder, Cape Cod Chips, and some Maine Root Soda to get the full experience Maine (get it?).

I loved all three of the rolls we tried: The Lobster Roll was my favorite, followed by the Shrimp Roll and then the Crab roll. I&#39;m not sure exactly what they have in their &#34;secret spices&#34;, but whatever it is, it totally worked with the seafood/lemon butter/mayo. The New England Clam Chowder only added to the meal, and it also had some generous amounts of clam in there.

The interior design and knickknacks hung up on the wall were a joy to look at, felt like I was really in Maine (Can a local from Maine confirm if this is how everyone decorates their interior up north?). I think the food you get is well worth the price. Looking at the menu again, I might get one of the combo deals next time.

You should come to this Luke&#39;s Lobster or one of its other locations in the city (or just go to Maine!) and try the rolls at least once, I know that I most likely will be back in the near future when my craving has its way with my student loan payments.

Also be aware that the 43rd st entrance is rather small, while the 44th st entrance  has outdoor seating and is pretty hard to miss.

TL;DR What are you waiting for, Maine?! Come eat all the rolls!"

1) great chunky delicious overflowing rolls 
2) deliciousness
3) toasty warm buns
4) the lobster is just so fresh, meaty, &amp; succulent.
5) great service
6) happy hour - yes, they have alcohol!
7) great atmosphere to sit and savor every bite of your rolls. 

I usually get the taste of Maine (shrimp, crab, &amp; lobster rolls w/ 2 lobster claws). The rolls are kinda small, but that seems to be the norm with lobster rolls in NYC. 

I&#39;m never disappointed at Luke&#39;s."

I figured the lobster would be overpriced and lack in taste, in comparison to the cheap, straight from the ocean, awesome tasting lobster. 

However, a friend and I have now met at Luke&#39;s Lobster several times. The lobster is a bit over priced, but I must admit their lobster rolls are delicious, and I love the assortment of made in New England drinks and Cape Cod chips. They have a nice casual seating area that is great for a low-key business lunch or lunch with friends. Definitely worth checking out if you work in Midtown or work near one of their other locations."

Perfectly buttered, toasted roll...and all that succulent seafood just laying there dressed with butter and some seasoning. Perfection, albeit pricy!

You might have a hard time finding this exact location, since it&#39;s nestled in between two buildings - but with a keen eye you&#39;ll find it no problem. (You will probably notice all the people  in the outside sitting area munching away. 

I ordered the Taste of Maine (1/2 Lobster Roll, 1/2 Shrimp Roll, 1/2 Crab Roll, 2 Crab Claws, drink, cole slaw &amp; pickle). The day I went lobster&#39;s from Maine, crab is snow crab from Nova Scotia, and the shrimp is from Quebec. The snow crab was good and fluffy, though was the least tasty of the three. The shrimp was uber excellent too - nice bite with the sweetness of the ocean. Now if you think the shrimp is good, wait till you have the lobster! Generous amounts of claw and knuckle meat too. No frills or celery and random vegetables on the roll. 

Sure, it may be a little pricy - but if you feel like splurging a little on some good grub, Luke&#39;s ain&#39;t a bad choice at all!"

Two men sat and utilized the restaurant as a Starbucks computer locale, neither ordered food off the limited menu only drinks. I however ordered Luke&#39;s Trio &amp; Jonah Crab Claws.

After only about 15 minutes, the food was delivered and there was a brownie included.  It was very unnecessary, but very thoughtful and my coworker was very appreciative for that extra effort!

I&#39;ve been sporadically visiting this spot over the months, but they never actually end up &#34;wowing&#34; me. But hey, I wanted a lobster roll...and that&#39;s what I got. 

Unfortunately for a meal that cost roughly $20, it really didn&#39;t satisfy me. It took me around five minutes to finish the roll. Yes, I know my hunger helped me down the lobster roll...but the small size of it helped too! 

The lobster is fresh and tasty, but definitely not seasoned well enough. I had to put SO much pepper and salt in order to actually...fully like what I was eating. It was pretty unfortunate. The lobster was put inside a crispy, buttered roll that gave a great textured bite. 

Since I got the meal, it came with chips and a drink. Nothing much to say on them, the chips they carry are always tasty. I opt to go for the original bag of chips. I also got the Mexican Cola. It&#39;s good, but I&#39;m also not the biggest fan of soda. I definitely prefer it over typical Coke though. The drink wasn&#39;t overly sweet like typical soda. 

I don&#39;t hate this place...but I&#39;m not in love with it either. I&#39;m just &#34;meh&#34; towards it. I&#39;d much rather buy something else for $20 where I&#39;d fell more satisfied and less horrible for spending that amount."

Their menu is not not large but that is quite alright. From the small selection of beer ( about 6 which were all from Maine) to most of their sodas.  I had the Simcoe Spring Ale from the Peak Organic Brewing Company.  The better half had the Downeast Cider. 

For our dinner we split the Noah&#39;s Ark. Which is chock full of seafood.  2 half rolls each of lobster, crab and shrimp, 4 crab claws with a pickle and Cape Cod Chips.  

As it was a beautiful night we sat in their spacious courtyard which had about 15 tables with a water wall and probably later this month what will be a full wall of ivy.  

If you close your eyes and taste the food you will swear you are in Maine, the seafood is very fresh, the rolls were lightly toasted and buttered. They don&#39;t overload with mayonnaise so you really taste the seafood.

Unfortunately for me the new England clan chowder was more on the salty side and more chewy than I&#39;d like it to be. The coleslaw was okay, but it was that or a bag of chips.
(This was a week ago) I&#39;d rate this a 3.5

2 days after the first visit I went again to try the lobster roll with the soup combo. This time I tried the lobster bisque, bag of chips and rootbeer. 

Soup again was too salty, the bag of chips and root beer is as you would expect. The lobster roll honestly should have a larger roll. For 16 dollars I would expect a decent amount of lobsters, problem is 1/3 of them would keep falling out. I&#39;m not advocating for really big rolls, but I&#39;d atleast expect myself to be able to leisurely hold onto the roll and eat without the contents falling everywhere. (Rating -3?)

Not sure if it&#39;s just me I wanted some type of sauce for my roll, when I ordered the taste of Maine I was using the sauce for the crab claws to enhance the rolls flavor. The price for the lobster roll was 16 I believe and a soup combo would be 8 on top of that."

THAT I FOUND YELPING ALL THE WAY FROM CALIFORNIA!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Forget Maine, been there, done that, and guess what, they send almost all

their best lobster everywhere but Maine, to get the highest price.  I last tried

staying about a week in Maine, trying Lobster at many a place, never finding 

great Maine Lobster, until I came back to CA (&amp; had a Chinese fish-tank Maine Lobster)

or took a trip to NYC.....

&amp; take a long flight, a shuttle, and a long Taxi ride to Luke&#39;s.


Was it one of the best, if not the best, Lobster Roll that I had in decades...

ABSOLUTELY!!!


Was it worth seeking out despite 2014-15 NYC Blizzards &amp; me helping save my dying

mom at NYU Medical Center?  

Yes, I need a break from both the freezing cold &amp;

the stress of fighting with the moronic idiots at the Medical Center.  

Besides, I needed

great tasty high OCTANE LOBSTER fuel in order to fight the good fight for saving my mom,

from the clutches of the &#34;evil&#34; ones, who where quite ready to let her die in suffering Delirium

in a Hospice.  It was ironic that I, as a former NYU Brain Researcher &amp; current medical 

professional, had to us the biased patient advocate, to fight continuous against horrid nursing

&amp; medical care, at one of the top rated places in NYC.  I naively thought that NYU was as good 

as I remembered it from decades ago...when in fact, they were not much better than the 

even more crappy, Coney Island Hospital (a NY City Hospital filled with malpractice ) in good 

ole shitty Brooklyn.


In addition to the AMAZING lobster, 

THE BISQUE was also amazing, hot, &amp; super savory ....especially when the 

WIND CHILL FACTOR was below ZERO


&amp; you had to avoid falling on your butt

on the glacial ice (with a coating of ever present snow) that then covered 

Manhattan, the whole several weeks I was there, suffering like hell froze over most

of the time.


As many have pointed out,

 the ROLL is packed with TONS of fresh succulent 

high grade LOBSTER,

 with a very conservative touch of well appointed fix-ins &amp; Mayo.


While the ambience was simple, the two young service guys there were cool, not because of  

the cold outside, but because of their friendly non-typical NYC attitude.  Since I was almost

their only customer due to the extreme weather, we had a great conversation, while they

 served up a huge filling meal for me.  

Even the simple wine that they kindly let me sample was good...

even if it was just in a plastic cup.


While again in Manhattan, this was by far the best meal that I had there, for the money...or

maybe regardless of that.   I did get ripped off by so-called &#34;real&#34; Kobe Beef for over $200,

at the &#34;only&#34; certified Kobe Beef place in NYC....where since I was a newbie &amp; not a celebrity,

they obviously did a &#34;bait-and-switch&#34; on me, and instead gave me tough non-Kobe American 

meat

(which of course they lyingly denied in a Yelp response....yea right...hey, I grew up in BAD 

-ASSED BS LYING GANGSTER BROOKLYN...so WATCH OUT YOU F-in BSers )


Anyway, even though you can get ripped off in most places in NYC (boy, do I miss that, while

I grew up in NYC...NOT!!!!!),


YOU DO NOT GET RIPPED OFF AT LUKE&#39;s

THEY DID NOT DO THE OLD 

&#34;BAIT-WITH-LOBSTER &amp; SWITCH WITH CRAB OR TOO MUCH MAYO&#34;....

YOU GET THE REAL DEAL HERE!!! (see pics)


Luke&#39;s was well worth

a 3,000 MILE TRIP FROM SUNNY CALIFORNIA!!


I was beyond OVERJOYED that I found this place with Yelp!

It way exceeded even the often over-hyped claims of many Yelp reviewers

 &amp; was NO HYPE.

THE FANTASTIC QUALITY OF THE LOBSTER ROLL WAS A

COLD HARD FACT....

especially if you walked out with it...where it would likely freeze solid to your

hungry lips!


My advise, if the wind chill is below ZERO &amp; you can easily slip on the rock hard ice &amp; break 

your dumb ass, so just park your dumb ass inside, as you engorge &amp; delight

in LOBSTER INDUCED ORGANISMS

I can&#39;t deny, the lobster roll was delicious. I forgot to ask if they can do one without mayonnaise, since I dislike that stuff. Thankfully, they only put it at the bottom of the bun, so easily avoidable. They really do put a lot of lobster meat in the sandwich, but that being said it is still a very small sandwich. I guess there&#39;s only so much meat in a lobster. It&#39;s an expensive sandwich at $15 and I had to get a second dinner afterwards, but still worth trying at least once. You&#39;ll be done in three bites, but the butter, bread, lobster combo will guarantee those bites will be delicious. The lobster rolls are apparently cheaper than the ones sold at the Lobster Place at Chelsea.

I haven&#39;t tried the shrimp roll or crab roll, but heard from two of my friends that they are not worth getting. Just stick to the lobster roll. Again from a friend, apparently the New England Clam Chowder is really good."

Anyway, as advertised by prior Yelpers, the lunch line was formidable but I was determined to kick back and have a lobster roll after a long morning. The line actually went relatively quickly despite having only one cashier. I had the lobster roll with slaw and a drink for just north of $20. Seating was plentiful and clean, as I had no issue securing a table during the rush. I did have to wait about 15 orders or so to finally get my order.

First impression, I thought the roll itself was somewhat small. After taking a bite however, it is obvious how fresh the lobster is. By the end of it all, I was stuffed and thought my earlier self foolish for doubting Luke&#39;s. I will admit though, that while very good and worth the wait, my favorite New York lobster roll is the one from Burger and Lobster. I will definitely return here however."

The last time I had Luke&#39;s Lobster was over two years ago and haven&#39;t really been craving it since.  I passed by this place on the way to the nail salon, passed it again on my way back, then came back AGAIN when I realized I had a sudden lobster craving and didn&#39;t want to go home without fulfilling it.

Yeah, I have an eating problem.

I loved the outdoor patio-like seating with the walled water fountain.  It definitely gave the place its summertime appeal and whoever was the interior designer did it beautifully with its understated minimalistic setting.  I love architecture that is simplistic because that&#39;s elegance in its purest form.

Scarfed down their lobster roll and took in the beauty as much as I could while sipping on my bottle of Maine Root Mexican cola.

I highly doubt, being so close to new england and literally on the water, that NYC dining establishments should be charging an average $15-22 per lobster roll the size of my tiny fists... anyways......)

i gave luke&#39;s top stars because of the extremely friendly and joyful customer service!!! now i dont know a lot of fancy foodie lobster vernacular (you should see me ordering a starbucks... i only remember tall because it rhymes with small)... so i walk up to the order dude and i was like... hey i&#39;m going to describe the lobster of my dreams and see if this is one of the options you offer. and order dude was so fun and witty that i complimented him as a lobster god and gave him a tip for just making me smile!

speaking of which, no table service here but really great spot for big groups or families looking to share everything. lobster rolls make for nice finger food. the coleslaw is without sweetness or mayo but tastes very fresh, and maybe with some nice celery salt seasoning (i think?) the spicy crab bisque wasnt spicy hot but was spicy flavorful! 

now for the main attraction: lemon butter spice lobster roll... fresh and dainty. not as crazy intensely lemony as i like but still worth the chomps! after some google research, the internet voices (or the voices in my head, same diff) claim luke&#39;s to be the best price for the best taste in nyc. 

i dont know about the price vs taste... but i do know this place is at the top of my list! especially because there is some many inviting seating options outsides and a very clean interior with natural light happily flooding in every where! :)

ps: they sell beers!

pps: and they take credit cards!

ppss: but they are hidden... you need to walk down 44th (past 3rd, going towards 2nd) or down 42nd... it is nestled inside

Luke&#39;s Lobster is a chain. They have around 15 locations. With 15 locations, I wondered if their quality would be diluted. Well, I don&#39;t know if it has, but this location was pretty good. 

They have a decent sized menu with all the shellfish goodness. I tried their Taste of Maine. It comes with 1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 shrimp roll, and 1/2 crab roll. They even throw in some crab claws, a pickle, chips, and a soda. It&#39;s a great deal.

Well, ignore those. Out of all the rolls, the lobster roll was the best among. I did like the shrimp roll, but the lobster roll is where it&#39;s at. I didn&#39;t like the crab roll as much. It didn&#39;t have the chunks of meat the other rolls had. 

The Lobster Roll had huge chunks of lobster, and it was on some good bread. The flavor was slightly on the sweet side. I think I could eat like 2 of these. Actually, thinking about it, I wanna fly to NY right now to get this roll. 

I also loved the non-pretentious, down to earth, casual feel of the place. The space is large too. You can bring a lot of people. It&#39;s a great place for a quick meal. I highly recommend it."

The lobster roll was so good! The seasoning was a tad bit salty but everything else was perfect! Not an overkill on the mayo and the bread was overflowing with chilled lobster meat!

The lobster roll is true to what a Maine lobster roll really is; chunks of fresh lobster meat on a potato roll, glossy, buttered, and NO nonsense (i.e; celery, etc) stealing the show. 

Their slaw is a great accompaniment to the roll (any of their rolls, in fact).

The rolls were pretty bland. Used a significant amount of the cocktail sauce mixed with a little sriracha (LOOOVE sriracha).

Sustainable and traceable seafood.  Quick.  However, the lobster didn&#39;t taste as fresh as it should have and it was over seasoned.  There was plenty of lobster and it wasn&#39;t drowned in mayo but it just wasn&#39;t executed as well as it should have been.  Compared to the Burger and Lobster roll I had the other day, it doesn&#39;t come close.  I just left Boston, where I&#39;d been living for two years.

We had this 3 days in a row throughout our stay in NYC we even came back our last day to have some more it was so good we got hooked. The portions are a bit small and a little pricey but it fills you up and so worth it. We had the taste of Maine 3 days in a row. They make their bread so delicious!! Everything were delicious too bad they don&#39;t have a location in California otherwise we will be eat this everyday. Highly recommend this place for those looking for a seafood place in NYC.

I am a big fan of crab and the crab roll is definitely drool-worthy, the best I&#39;ve ever had, life-changing. It&#39;s a lot of meat, they don&#39;t skimp on that. Whatever they mix in with the crab is just everything nice. It tastes amazing and perfect. Flavor is spot on. The bread is toasted just right with a good amount of butter. Everything just comes together wonderfully, and each bite just leaves you in awe and wanting more. I can&#39;t get enough. I only wish for the price that we pay, the portions are bigger. It&#39;s more like a snack then a meal. I understand that large numbers of crab/lobsters are needed to make just one roll, but it&#39;s just so unsatisfying.

This location, while it seems spacious, actually has only a few tables. It&#39;s more like a long hallway to accommodate a long line. Service is quick and staff is friendly."

I discovered this place when I went to pick up my sister after her work in Brooklyn. We were looking for a nearby place to eat with high yelp scores and we decided to check this quaint little place out on Varet St. We were pleasantly surprised at how nice the industrial vibe of the place was. But the best part to any restaurant is the food! 

The cocktails were strong, tasted great so we ordered more than one. We had the pork buns and eel avocado sushi roll as appetizers and they were so good. We ended up having another order of pork buns. We tried the shoyu pork ramen and OMG. The flavors were so explosive and the noodles were cooked just right. The ramen is GOAT."

The decor is lovely and trasportational, whisking you into the forest cabin in Japan. The staff was pleasant and attentive and the food was very good. We had the Brussels Sprout appetizer, two ramens.. soooo good and a Salmon Avocado roll. The Sushi was delicious! And the ramen had better noodles than the spot in Astoria that has 1 michelin star. 
We had the unfiltered bottle of Sake and it was exceptional. Tasty, nutty, and creamy with a good kick. The price for everything was around the $50 mark so for us it was definitely a spurge but worth every penny!

My boyfriend and have been wanting to try this place for a while but every time we&#39;ve try to come the wait was too long and now we understand why! 

We decided to come on around 7 on a Saturday night and we didn&#39;t have to wait. 

FOOD: 

Delicious! Best ramen I&#39;ve had this far. We shared the vegan ramen, the broth and noodles were perfect and had such great flavor. 

For apps we had the Japanese pickles which was equally as delicious, a little kick which was nice. We also had the veggie gyoza also so awesome my boyfriend even said it was his favorite veggie gyoza he&#39;s had so far. I had the tuna avocado salad and it was fantastic, just enough dressing and was light and delicious. For dessert we had a scoop of the green tea ice cream and the panna cotta and that just rounded out a fantastic meal. The panna cotta was simple but still packed in yummy flavor with the berries on top! 

SERVICE: 

We sat at the bar and really enjoyed our bartender/server. He was super chill and friendly and answered our questions happily. 

AMBIENCE: 

Small but still super cute, we want to come back with a larger group cause it would be such a fun place to come to and sit at the family table. I really enjoyed the concrete decor, simple but had character. 

Overall this place certainly does not disappoint and we will be back!!"

Grabbed a seat by the window and its pretty neat that u can put ur bags and thangs underneath the table. It would be awesome if they had a hook too for coats/etc.

Anyways, we ordered a bunch of things to try. The uni ikura shot (very small so its not meant for sharing), salmon w avocado roll, veggie gyoza, pork buns. The uni ikura shot was pretty good it has rice and ikura w uni slices. Its expensive for a small shot tho. The roll and veggie gyoza was good. The gyoza looks super cool.. see pics!! The pork buns however, bun was dried and hard.. pork was dried and tough. Didnt like it.

We each had a bowl of pork cloudy soup ramen (top 3 on the menu). Like the fact that it comes w extra soup on the side so u can thin out the soup to ur liking or if ure slurrrping slow and the noodles starts soakin up the soup u can add more! I thought the ramen was decent, the noodle texture definitely did not take like the ramen im used to.. tasted and looked very much like instant ramen (wriggly). But it was pretty okay.

Service was definitely impeccable. The staff was attentive and came to check on us many times. Also refilled our water!!"

Tan tan noodles were good, I enjoy the thick soup; it wasn&#39;t spicy to me so that&#39;s odd but still tasted great nonetheless! Champong was decent, cannot give my full input on that one since I didn&#39;t sample the food but the soup was delicious. Gyoza was actually a pleasant surprise; I&#39;d order it again but can pass on the sauce since it was kind of salty. 

I ordered the ikura and uni shot, which sadly, did not satisfy me due to portion to price ratio.  It was $9 for just a bite served in a glass, cmon yo! 

If caught between 3 and 4 stars, I rely on thoughts of the reason why I visited the establishment in the first place aka ramen. Ergo, 4 stars due to the hearty ramen!"

This place has pretty good ramen, especially for the area. It definitely has a cozy, semi- hip vibe. I like the lighting and the wooden tables. Yeah, I instagrammed that. #noshame 

Now let&#39;s get to food - 
I ordered the lunch special, which comes with ramen, salad and an appetizer. All for about $10! I opted for the shio ramen, which comes with pork belly, some green onions, mushrooms, a half cooked egg &amp; eggplant(?). What&#39;s unique was that they served it with a small bowl of dashi, which is a stock that you can use to adjust the flavor of the ramen. Very cool. Everything was also served in a cool bowl, so I&#39;m a fan. The ramen was pretty good, the pork belly was tender. I added corn in for an extra dollar, and it was well spent! (LUV CORN) It came with a good amount, and I was still eating corn at the end of my meal. 

The salad was actually a great start to my meal, and I appreciate that it was a salad of mixed greens instead of the usual iceberg salads at Japanese restaurants. The gyoza was alright. Very gyoza, nothing too special about it. 

I should also mention that serve was great. The server gave me all my food at the appropriate times, so I never had to look for my food. Whenever I was finished with one dish, the next one came soon after. Want to know what really solidified it though? I was unaware that it was cash only, so I had to find an ATM nearby. I asked her if I could go find one, and she said yes. That&#39;s a huge amount of trust! I could&#39;ve totally been a criminal and dine and dashed! But I AM A GOOD PERSON. And came back after walking around a little.  (Btw there&#39;s a deli 2 blocks away that had an ATM that lets you take out in increments of $10)."

The restaurant is basically 2 big rectangular tables with a bar, some pictures make the place look bigger then it is but It is quite small in reality. Don&#39;t come here expecting a private table, most of the time you will either share the big table space with other groups or you can sit at the bar for more seclusion. Their bathroom is cleverly hidden on a sliding wall that almost everytime I go, I would see someone walking past it.

Their food is for sure their star, it hasn&#39;t failed me yet on the few occasions I go but I&#39;ll dock them 1 star cause their service seems a bit slow. A majority of the time it&#39;s just 1 waiter and depending on traffic flow, he/she can end up struggling to get to everyone on time. This is all based on a night time dining experience so maybe it&#39;s different during the day. luckily however their food is very  tasty and well balanced and for sure worth trying."

Also, before someone else decides to freak out about Bukkake being on the menu: Bukkake is a cooking term that was adopted by the porn industry.

The server was pleasant and positive. (Always appreciated!) Possibly the best fried chicken and takoyaki in the boroughs outside of Flushing. The portion size within the ramen bowls is ideal between contents and broth. We are huge fans of Ippudo and we agree this beats it on all accounts except for the size of the dining room. The dining area is narrow but nicely layed out with a long table and fixed concrete seating. We will definitely come out of our way to return. Don&#39;t miss this.

The good thing about this place is they give you a little soup thing to water down your ramen base because they know it might be too thick for people&#39;s liking. I thought my soup was definitely too thick and the ramen reminded me of instant noodles but overall it was better than naruto ramen but not as good as totto? I prefer their sister restaurant samurai mama better. If you are in the area and a fan of ramen i would recommend giving it a try"

It was not at my behest and it eventually drove me absolutely mad; I vowed to never touch another bowl of ramen for an undetermined amount of time.

Arriving back in the States, I kept receiving suggestions to have ramen at the new hip places that just opened.  I refused since I was still in recovery, and not a fan of waiting outside of any establishment in the frigidity of NY.  

Months passed, and in my search for a place to reconnect with a dear friend of mine, I came upon Samurai Papa.  Located in East Williamsburg, it&#39;s still far enough from the more popular neighborhoods that we ended up not having to wait.

The interior has a very minimalist and industrial feel; grey-themed with two communal tables, the middle being the largest, and seating at the bar as well.  The unmarked bathroom is hidden behind sliding doors on the left wall.

My yuzu and ginger iced tea had a hint of yuzu flavor, but totally missed the mark on the ginger.  None of that good spiciness was present, whatsoever- only sweetness.

We both ordered the sushi shots to start; I got the hamachi(yellowtail) toro shot.  The shots were accompanied by three types of soy: regular, wasabi mixed, and extra spicy.  The tiny spoons were deceiving; I would suggest two spoonfuls- 3 was too overpowering.  

The fish itself was divinely fresh.  However, I thought it was priced too high($6) for what it was: a deconstructed roll in a shot glass.  Slicing the fish into small pieces only served to make it seem like there was more than you were being served.  

For the highlight of the evening, I settled on the aori miso ramen.  The menu listed a description of the type of broth and ingredients used.  My particular one read as such: &#34;stock: chicken, lobster, bonito, mussel, garlic, miso paste, sesame oil. topping: sliced pork, soy sauce egg, mixed vegetables, kikurage mushroom.&#34;

The broth was absolutely spot on.  It was not too heavy or greasy.  I usually go with tonkotsu(pork based broth), but this miso broth had a depth of flavor that could rival any of those found in Japan."

My first evening in Brooklyn was very chilly and wet from the rain. I knew I wanted something warm for my tired soul, exhausted from moving in, and looked for places around the neighborhood that would serve warm, comforting food. I found Samurai Papa on Yelp and thought ramen would be a solid choice. Only a couple minutes from home, pops and I walked over for dinner and were lucky to arrive just on time to take the last two seats.

I loved the d√©cor of this place. The dim lighting and simple, wooden interior were even better for the chilly weather. It was a little weird to sit at a huge table and share the area with strangers but we didn&#39;t feel crammed at all. I ordered the shoya ramen and pops got the vegan ramen and we both enjoyed our dishes. I added some extra spiciness to my ramen which made it perfect for my liking. Broths of both ramen were deep and smooth but I&#39;ve definitely had better before. However, I really liked the noodles. A little different from the traditional ramen noodles as they were &#34;chewier&#34; but they felt very fresh. 

The ramen we had were not really to die for but I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back once a while for some hot broth and noodles on a chilly day as it is so close to my home."

I texted my friend almost immediately. &#34;There&#39;s a ramen-themed Samurai Mama spin-off coming to our neighborhood!&#34;  I wanted to set a date for our first visit. 

&#34;Oh I know,&#34; came the reply. &#34;[My wife] and I went there yesterday. It&#39;s just OK. The broth was weird.&#34; 

I trust this person - we are, after all, friends - but was skeptical at the news. Wasn&#39;t Samurai Mama one of the best places in all of Williamsburg, with its succulent udon preparations and bevy of small plates, all served around a gigantic communal table? Hoe hard is it to transition from one type of Japanese noodle to another?

Of course, he was right. Samurai Papa is either a minor failure or major disappointment, depending on how much baggage you bring from previous ventures from the same owners. And that broth is at the core of the problem. Whether is the cloudy-white, ill-advised &#34;vegan broth&#34; or a spin on the more traditional shoyu sauce, these creations taste unbalanced. The hearty, slow-simmering flavor isn&#39;t here, replaced with a mishmash of flavor. The stringy, unimpressive pieces of char siu in my bowl didn&#39;t help. They&#39;re usually aren&#39;t too many bites of meat in a ramen dish - and each one should be wonderful. That wasn&#39;t the case here.

Even if the signature product is a bust, everything else is successful. Many of the small plates have come over unchanged from Samurai Mama, and they&#39;re all worth trying. The space is rawer, more industrial than the sister, appropriate considering this is a much more up-and-coming neighborhood. It would pare with a better designed bowl of hearty noodles.

My favorite addition are the &#34;sushi shots,&#34; which resemble temaki served in small glasses rather than wrapped in nori are two or three pieces of raw seafood. Each one is a concentrated flavor bomb, especially when paired with the patented Samurai trio of soy sauces. 

You really can have an excellent meal at Samurai Papa, but you&#39;ll just need to avoid their signature dish."

Having been to Mama many times and loving their food, I expected similar. First off, the gyoza was super greasy with a pool of oil at the bottom of the skillet. The skin stuck to the skillet and tasted mushy. Their sister restaurant Mama&#39;s gyoza is cooked way better not as greasy and without the pool of oil at the bottom of the skillet. Next..we ordered some rolls. The rice was hard and not cooked properly making the rolls very mushy. FINALLY...the ramen. A complete disaster. We ordered two shoyu and one papa ramen. All were either overcooked or there was something wrong with the noodle. The noodle texture was too doughy. I&#39;ve eaten ramen all over the world and ramen even the instant stuff had a better texture. Staff was a bit  slow and not very perceptive or responsive."

Being in Bedstuy there isn&#39;t anything in my immediate vicinity, so I would always make the short bike ride over to Chuko. I think I can safely say that Samurai Papa has become my new go-to. 

No pretension and communal seating (like the Mama location in Wiliamsburg) greet you as you walk in. The seating isn&#39;t exactly comfortable, but the service makes you feel at home with smiles and attentive, laid back interactions as you mull over a fairly extensive sake list (only a couple 300 ML bottle options (around $23), but at least 10 720ML options (starting at $46)).

However, the star here and the real reason this place is getting 5 stars is the ramen. The aori miso ramen was a savory blend of earthy mushrooms and salty pork and a broth that had the richness of a shoyu broth but not the heaviness in my stomach after. I actually slurped and sipped the bowl dry, which I usually can never do with ramen. The sliced pork was melt in your mouth delicious, although the 5 pieces were rather small, I&#39;d say they were about an inch wide square.

One of my dinner mates ordered a couple sushi rolls and I would have to say that the shrimp was rather bland and the rice didn&#39;t taste like sushi rice at all and was actually a bit crunchy. Then again, this place doesn&#39;t come off as a destination for sushi to me. 

I look forward to returning to have some MORE aori miso ramen and some veggie and pork dumplings!"

For 12 bucks you get a light but flavorful salad to start. Then gyoza, clearly made with great technique. Then the best part... The ramen. Flavorful, fresh, nicely seasoned, with a beautiful depth and diversity of flavor. Fantastic deal for 12 dollars. Left very content and satisfied. Food was nicely timed and spaced out.

Just walked in and sat ourselves down. There were a few other patrons in the restaurant. So not too crowded and not too empty. 

We ordered the Yuzu ginger ice tea, the papa ramen and aori miso ramen. The Yuzu ginger tea was okay, more Yuzu flavor then ginger. As a matter of fact, I barley tasted any ginger at all in the ice tea.

Now for the two ramen dish, they were overall okay, not really living up to the hype. The papa ramen broth was very thick but had a nice flavor to it. The minced pork was also good but the ramen noodle was a bit overcooked for my taste. 

As for the aori Miso ramen, the broth was lighter but was a bit on the salty side. The pork belly that came with the ramen was only okay, I have had better. The ramen also came with a basket of crunchy fried garlic (which was really good), pickled chili pepper and spicy chili oil. 

I Would probably come back to give it a second chance and order the ramen In spicy broth. But I m more excited to go try their other restaurant, samurai mama instead, which serve udon. I love udon more than ramen and have heard great stuff about samurai mama. Another important fact, bring cash! As they only accept cash and no credit cards"

It was really really sticky and gummy, like it had been way way over cooked. I&#39;ve eaten a lot of ramen, even throughout Japan, and never had anything that tasted like this, though we were told it might be the preference of the chef here.

   This a tiny place with limited seating not like Samurai mama, approximately around 20. So come here early!! 
   We had two different types of sushi shot, yellowtail and chirashi. It&#39;s a great idea that all the sashimi were all cut up in cubes and placed in a shot glass. All the fish tasted fresh and good quality. I want more! Had the fried chicken too. It didn&#39;t have those crispy fried coating. However, the chicken were marinated and not greasy. Love the sauce especially. It&#39;s sweet and tangy with a salad base, sweet tomato, slices of cucumber, shredded radish and shredded shiso leave. A must-have!
   The 3-starred review was actually due to the ramen quality. Two stars off for the noodle itself. We had papa ramen and aori miso ramen. The papa ramen was slight spicy and the ramen noodle was overcooked! Seriously overcooked! Tasted like instant noodle. The broth was good though. The miso ramen noodle was much much better. The style of these ramen taste like a fusion of sapporo and tokyo. I like it but I would expet better noodle quality next time. By the way, they have those little baskets with fried garlic bits, pickles pepper and layou for ramen. 
   Don&#39;t remember to call for a drink and dessert here. We had a lychee-rambutan sake cocktail. It was super delicious. The dessert we had was fruit consumme panna cotta. Super yummy."

The cashiers know how to treat their customers kindly even with a heavy work volume. Kudos to that.

I&#39;m a big fan of the grab and go, as opposed to the buffet table where the line takes place. There&#39;s a selection of hot foods, like some of the fried rices, japchae, and small dishes. There&#39;s also a cold section where they sometimes have the kimbap, kimchi, bibimbap, right under the beverages. There&#39;s also the pancakes stored at room temperature. The grab and go is by a rule the cheapest stuff you&#39;ll find here and may actually be better than the buffet table. Can&#39;t recall an item above $10. 

With the pancakes and the hot food, if you bring it back home and heat it up they taste even better. That&#39;s especially true with the kimchi pancakes."

Got their buffet and bought it To go and when I ate the food most of them are lack of flavor even when it is spicy. Rice cake is so hard to chew. Jap chae doesn&#39;t have much flavor to it as it used to be. The only part that was good that I got was the bulgogi and kimchi pancake. They added SOOO MUCH MSG on their soup that I was SUPER thirsty when I was at work, I found myself drinking so much water throughout my working shift. 

Came back at the same day but for late night dinner/supper around 1130pm and they don&#39;t HAVE ANYTHING AT ALL. It seem like they are preparing to close when I see that their close time is 2AM.

Note that this is also a viable option to pregame if you&#39;re looking for cheaper soju than the restaurant pricing. And they even have the flavored soju everyone in ktown seems to really like!

First meal in New York and I was with people who wanted to give this place a try so I obliged.
Not your typical Korean restaurant where people come and serve you, but maybe that&#39;s because I arrived super late.
Not sure how the service is when you&#39;re here earlier, but this was just based on my experience.

What you need to know when arriving late like me:
This place is cafeteria style where you grab what you want from the right side of the establishment and you pay at the front when you&#39;re ready to drop a few bills.
The selection of Korean food is very vast so I was impressed. It looks like they have little selection, but if you dig through the piles and piles of food, you will see that they have much to offer.
They had kimbap, tonkatsu, rolled omelettes, soup, chicken, kimchi, more side dishes, noodles, desserts, drinks, and etc.
Some food are laid under a heat lamp while others stay cold. With that being said, they have a microwave for your nuking needs.

When it came to paying the bill, to me it seemed like the cashier had a bad attitude. Probably because it was late and he needed sleep. He did seem nonchalant about life and his current situation, but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s because this place harbors a lot of drunk people and he&#39;s had it with their shit. To me that&#39;s understandable, you probably need a mean front to deal with people of the like. Or...maybe because I was being dumb with the paying situation because it was my first time there so I was all jet lagged, frazzled, and confused. He probably thought I was drunk.

Some food items come with a free side of soup or a small water bottle. Because I was thirsty I got the water bottle but it was gone in 2 seconds.
I hate to say it, but the food was just okay and I&#39;ve had better.
When I sampled the bulgogi kimbap, it was very dry and not juicy like how my friend can make it.
The spicy boneless chicken was nicely marinated and sweet so that one was pleasant although again still a bit dry.
The tonkatsu was decent. Alongside the tonkatsu, that plate had a lot of kimchi on the side so it was a bit too much for me to handle. #deathbykimchi

TL;DR
The food was still edible and probably produced for hungover humans.
Would probably come here during the day next time to see how it was like.
Don&#39;t make a fool of yourself and come here drunk. It&#39;s embarrassing. I saw some Korean girl throwing up on the side and I offered her a moist towelette so she could wipe herself.
Oh yeah and this place got towelettes on deck. Take a few and use it sparingly throughout your visit in New York."

Found out about Woorijip through Yelp. With over 2k reviews and 4.5 stars, I figured that it must be good. 

What I loved about it is that they have different areas, the front part is their buffet and the back has prepackaged foods. 

The buffet is not your traditional ayce buffet, but a pay per pound buffet. It was around $8 per pound and they had a large variety of items. I enjoyed the glass noodles, sweet potatoes, pancakes...I definitely wasn&#39;t able to try everything, but everything looked delicious! Their kimbap on the buffet is also delicious. 

The back area has a good variety of kimbap, soups, cold foods, and other lunch boxes. Got the rice cakes and they were chewy and not too sweet. 

Location is just about a block away from the Empire State Building and is open pretty late! 

Come here for cheap, quick, and delicious Korean food!"

It&#39;s cheaper to buy the pre-packaged food in the back instead of from the buffet. I recommend the kimbap, or getting one of the stews with a pack of rice. I like how easy it is to mix and match your meals here. 

There is also a wide variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks here. The interesting thing about this place is that at night, it can get rowdy because a lot of people come here to pregame. Again, if you&#39;re on a budget, this is a good place to go if you want to get turnt without emptying your wallet."

They have lots of veggie options which are clearly marked with a green VEG sticker. The veggie japchae here is really tasty good and you can get a big container for pretty cheap. If you happen to come late at night a lot of the leftover things are sold for half price too! There are also sides/ banchan, kimbap, soup etc.

I love getting the hot bar items. You can eat a little bit of everything. there is always a good selection of vegetables and noodles/ rice and also meats (for the Omnis). It is weighed per pound so it does add up so be careful.

Besides just a place for a quick casual dinner, many people also come here to drink sake and just have a good time with friends. It gets kinda loud in here on weekend nights however.

They have a rewards card where you get stamps and you can collect stamps to redeem free stuff later on. 

Overall a great place for &#34;take out&#34; Korean food that is fresh &amp; reasonably priced (the packaged food)."

Even though I&#39;m a huge fan of K-Town, Woorijip has never been somewhere I&#39;ve actively wanted to visit. Nonexistent service, cafeteria-style vibe, and mass produced food just didn&#39;t seem as appealing as the &#34;fancier&#34; options elsewhere. But now that I have transitioned from a student with plenty of time to wine and dine to a working adult with a variable 60+ hour work schedule, Woorijip has become a godsend. Quick, easy, cheap, and solid Korean food is exactly what I need when I&#39;m way too tired to cook or just need to grab a bite to sustain myself. Don&#39;t expect top-notch, quality Korean food here, because that&#39;s not what Woorijip&#39;s designed for. But if you&#39;re looking for a spot to just grab-and-go or you&#39;re craving a bunch of Korean dishes and don&#39;t want to commit to one main dish, then this is the place for you!"

Be warned, while it is buffet style, they charge by the pound so that means the more food you get, the more expensive it can become. 

The one negative thing I have to say is that the cashier was extremely rude and super unfriendly. We were obviously new comers to the restaurant and she was so rude. Kind of a turn off from coming back. 

But overall it was decent."

Self-serve Korean food, either pre-packaged to go or you can buffet-line it and eat it fresh and hot inside. A nice array of dishes, lots of different savory pancakes, rices, noodles, etc. Basically the kind of food you&#39;d expect at a Korean restaurant. The beef bulgogi was and always will be my favorite. 

The cooler of drinks is a great touch, all the soju you could want, and more. I could totally see this place as a pre-game event before the bars or a last call after the bars roundup place. But even just as a quick dinner spot it works. 

It&#39;s well organized with clearly marked lines and lots of staff. This place does get crowded, especially on the weekends, so finding a seat can sometimes be a struggle, but people tend to move in and out quickly and are willing to scoot over and share space.

This is a staple in K-Town and continues to be one of the more popular places among all people that come here. For me? I&#39;m Korean so this food is basic. I come here for the beverages.

I can talk about the food but again as I mentioned, pretty basic. They have buffet throughout the day and close it after dinner time. They have a huge variety to choose from, and for the normal non-Korean, it tastes fantastic. I&#39;d say that most Korean if you ask them will probably not think much of this place in regards to food. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been impressed with anything, though it does the job for sure when needed. As I mentioned, the beverages is where it&#39;s at. Soju is about 20-30% cheaper here than at any restaurant in K-Town. Talk about pre-game, post-game, any game. They have a great selection of juices as well, and just have a melange of beverages that could do anybody in. I come here frequently with friends and it&#39;s a great time. Disclaimer, it&#39;s a different ambience than you would get at a restaurant, bar or lounge of course. It&#39;s not even really a restaurant. This place is more of a pick up and go joint, or get food (usually a quick bite) to sit down and eat, and leave. However, there&#39;s quite the crowd at night and it gets rather rowdy at times. The staff do a good job making sure to only serve &#39;beverages&#39; to 18+ and do an okay job with crowd control.

Definitely come here as I hear it&#39;s popular among the non-Korean folk. And definitely come here if you&#39;re looking to just kick back a few with friends for a discounted price."

My friend and j got kimchi fried rice, japchae and chicken for less than $10. The japchae wasn&#39;t the best but I loved the kimchi fried rice. I had some soju with it which was lit.

Woorijip is a buffet style spot that offers a variety of korean food ranging from gimpap to ddeokbokki, all of which are delicious! They have hot food and cold food, along with drinks and desserts. You can either buy the pre-packaged food in the back or you can fill up your tray and they will charge you based on the weight. Whenever I fill my tray up with lots of food, it never surpasses $10, which is definitely a steal. 

The place is a bit small and crowded, so I don&#39;t recommend coming here with a large group. What my friends and I did one time was we walked up a block and found picnic tables to eat at.

It isn&#39;t the fanciest Korean food you can get in K-town. There are trendier options that have great food where you can sit and enjoy your meal leisurely rather than at this buffet style setting where you more often than not are sharing a table with people you don&#39;t know. Still, there&#39;s something about this place that keeps bringing me back. It&#39;s fast, it&#39;s cheap, I can select what I want and ignore the things I don&#39;t.

The buffet is pretty hit or miss. Sometimes they&#39;ll have what you want, sometimes not. Usually there is a wide enough variety of options to find something though. The kimchi is surprisingly great for a fast food/buffet style restaurant.

When I was younger this was the place to go at night before going to a club to grab some cheap food and/or soju. No idea if it still has that reputation.

There&#39;s also a large section of prepackaged meals, from bentos to rice bowls and larger versions of what is on the buffet. Signs inform diners that the food is strictly regulated about the time it can spend outside. 

Even after 9 p.m. (or during the middle of the day) this place is always crowded, so the food turns over quickly and is very dependable. Bonus points to the sides of rice that are available at the counter for just over a $1 -¬†there&#39;s no reason to waste buffet money on this heavy staple.

Being in the city just for the summer as a summer intern, I&#39;ve gone here way too many times for lunch, dinner, and &#34;pregaming&#34;. I love you Woorijip!!!

This place is essentially a large Korean deli with a good amount of seating. It features a hot food bar that is charged per pound (~$8 per pound). The hot food bar changes daily but I think there are foods that stay every day. It has a ton of options--different kimbaps (classic, bulgogi), ddukbokki, different protein (tofu, chicken, beef, pork), different rices (kimchi fried rice, veg fried rice), different noodles (japchae, black bean), different pancakes (eggless kimchi, seafood), and a lot of veggies. In addition to the hot food bar, there are a lot of hot and cold grab-and-go dishes. Basically everything in the hot food bar also have grab-and-go packages. 

ANY Korean dish you might want can be found here. Everything is very homemade tasting and authentic AND super flavorful. Honestly, I think it has better than many Korean restaurants.

The best part is it&#39;s pretty cheap, especially by city standards. This is definitely the cheapest place for Korean food on Manhattan island. For example, most grab-and-go protein over rices are ~$6.50 and come with a free soup, salad, or kimchi...the quarts of ddukbokki are $4...the quarts of soondubu are $3.50. If you come late, some things are in the 1/2 off basket near the cash register so make sure to check that out. 

A pro tip: if you plan to go out in Ktown and don&#39;t want to spend $$$ at the bar, go to Woorijip beforehand and drink soju with friends. It&#39;s less than $10 for a bottle and they have a ton of flavored soju in addition to the original. Conversely, if you want some late night food after going out, Woorijip is open until 3AM and still has grab-and-go food out at that time.

Highly recommend this place for casual eating! I wouldn&#39;t come if you&#39;re looking for a dine-in experience or only in the city for a few days, but a very solid choice if you live in the city."

However I gotta admit that there is some downside. If you don&#39;t want to see drunk and loud drinkers hanging around, not recommended to go there on the weekend evening. There&#39;s no more 1/2 off on the buffet deal, and they cut back store hours, they closed early now.

Both times I&#39;ve bought lunch here, I&#39;ve accidentally grabbed a sample item and gotten in line, only to be told that I needed to grab a different one.  So I lost my place in line, went back to the case, and then came back.  I&#39;m not sure why a display-only example item is necessary for each dish they sell when the selection is so well-stocked and I can just see the real thing.

Other than that this place is great.  I&#39;ve never sat down but there appears to be plenty of seating.  And the buffet looks and smells delicious."

Good selection of typical Korean foods. Hot food bar being charged by the weight is great, but their packaged foods is where it shines. So many choices to choose from and most of them are combos so you can choose a side too. 

Plenty of drink selections, opens late, but the seats are usually crowded. Definitely recommend."

It just seems like they don&#39;t care about their food anymore. The last time I took to-go a chicken and kimbap combo plus more, I found out too late that the kimbap had gone bad and so had their fried tofu curd sushi! I used to love collecting those stamps to claim the prices, but I do not think I&#39;ll be returning to this place anymore... loosing trust in food&#39;s freshness is game over."

Coming it, I didn&#39;t really know what to expect because people didn&#39;t really touch on that, so I was surprised to see it is a buffet-style restaurant, where you fill up a Styrofoam container and you pay-by-weight. But that methodology works out so well here! I fill up on a bunch of different foods, and it was reasonably priced. The glass noodles were fantastic, and so was the kimchi friend rice. Of course I also got some kimbap and other things I can&#39;t remember off the top of my head. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of any of the egg-based dishes I tried, which were a bit bland, but everything else was really good.

We also tried something weird that was in a corner of the shop, it was tasteless, but supposed to taste like pumpkin. We asked one of the cashiers what it was supposed to be, and he told us, and when he found out we didn&#39;t like it (at all.. bleh) he let us try some sweet rice balls for free! I thought that was a really nice gesture. Then again, maybe it was just because my friend was wearing her lucky dress?

THE VERDICT:
At any rate, it&#39;s a quick service place where you fill up a container and pay right there. But there were also a lot of pre-packaged things for on-the-go takeaway, both hot and cold. And there&#39;s also a bunch of flavored soju here! So, if you&#39;re starving and looking for a quick, tasty meal that won&#39;t kill your wallet, this place is an excellent option."

I had the buffet which had a nice assortment of tasty Korean dishes that I like/grew up with and it ended up costing me less than 10$. You can&#39;t beat that lunch price, especially for a quality lunch that&#39;s not a food cart/pop up lunch shop.

Every single thing I tried was just great. Buffet style weigh by the pound for $7.99 or portioned take out containers starting at just $3.50 up to about $6 of cold salads, hot soups, dumplings and kimchi everything. Small selection (but greatly appreciated) of Chinese, Japanese and Korean beer in singles or six packs. Barefoot Bubbly too. Neat soy and rice milks, Asian juices and soft drinks. Gather then pay. They will give you chopsticks and then grab a table. Simple. No frills but must try authentic Korean-town noms. 

We opted for the buffet in order to try lots of different goodies before fully committing to one meal plus, it&#39;s more fun this way anyhow. This was definitely the way to go for first timers which we were. There were plenty of vegetarian and vegan options! All foods clearly labeled. Jasmine rice with scallions, clear noodles with veggies, spicy tofu, string beans with mushrooms, tasty broccoli, saut√©ed kale, red pepper pancakes, spicy bean sprouts, veggie sushi, kimchi noodles, roasted pumpkin, crab pancake and incredible eggplant were what filled our to go boxes. I loved everything! Stand outs were the eggplant, the red pepper pancakes, even the kale which was actual very simple with some garlic, but truly delicious. I want to know exactly how they make it so I can recreate at home. 

The place was packed. We didn&#39;t have an issue finding a seat in the back but I can see how that may be a problem at busier times. 

**Plus, they played my favorite band Rusted Root and not just a radio song, a live version. So random. They definitely earned points for that sweet treat."

Food: 
a buffet with good meat selection - beef/pork bulgolgi (stir-fried marinated beef/pork), fish, egg omelette, seafood pancake (small size); veggies, salad; kimchi fried rice, egg and meat fried rice, Japchae (stir-fried cellophane noodle) and etc. 

individual items:
stir-fried pork or chicken over rice (~ $7); good soup selection: ox bone soup, seafood tofu soup, seaweed soup, fish cake soup etc (~ $3.5 each); porridges: red bean flavor, pumpkin flavor etc; individual rice packs (~ $1 each); other Korean dishes like bibimbap, stir-fried spicy rice sticks.
small appetizers: marinated eggs, seaweed salad, fishcake, etc.

Drinks:
Soup (see above section);
Soft drinks: Korean ones like ale drink, Calpicos and teas etc;
Alchol: they offers Korean rice wine and other light alchol drinks too but only for dine in.

Small Korean snacks:
Shrimp sticks, sticky rice, etc

Overall experience:
Flavor and quality is so-so, but cheap and fast ($7-20 per meal with large portion). My friend and I got fried chicken with chili soy sauce, ox bone soup, seafood tofu soup, and some buffet items this time. The fried chicken is well flavored but sadly too dry..

We went with the buffet option because there were a lot of different things we could try. I will say: the major pros of this place is the price (about $8/lb) and the great variety of hot and cold options. The cons is that, like any buffet, it&#39;s hard to make the food consistently good and fresh. I liked the sushi and the seaweed salad (made in the Korean style as opposed to Japanese), as well as the japchae. The meat, however, was not that well done and was thick and dry (the stewed chicken and vegetables wrapped in beef). Overall I thought the quality was about average, but the value in the price is probably what makes this place popular. Of all the excellent options in ktown, however, not sure I would come again."

This place is great if you&#39;re on the go or want something cheap to eat, especially in the Herald Square/Koreatown area. They have a wide selection of food and drinks, such as kimchi fried rice, kimbap, soju, milkis and juice. You just go and get whatever you like and then line up to pay. I believe you need to have a minimum of $10 worth of food, in order to use your credit card. So, bring cash in case! 

It&#39;s no surprise if you come in and the place is packed/busy because of its pricing and great quality food. There is limited seating in the front and the back. But, you can still get seating after waiting for a bit. 

I believe the buffet is there at a certain time because in the few times I went there, the buffet wasn&#39;t open.

Recently, I came here with some friends for drinks. The soju is pretty cheap and we bought that along with two cans of milkis (carbonated yogurt drink) to make our own drinks. If you do not like carbonated drinks, milkis is probably not for you. 

Definitely come here if you want to sample a wide variety of food in one place, which is always great!"

It is self-service with plenty of seating. There are plenty of options to choose from - hot buffet ($7.99/lb), noodle bar, prepackaged meals, snacks, drinks. 
I picked up Bulgogi over Wild Rice with Clear Noodle, $7, to go. 
I didn&#39;t clearly read the sticker on the box. I thought it was just bulgogi &amp; noodles, so I assumed the container was more than 50% bulgogi. Once I dug into it, I realized that underneath the bulgogi is mostly purple wild rice. So that was my mistake for not paying attention, haha. It also comes with a soup, salad, kimchi, or mini bottle of water in the $1 section of the fridge.
This was more than enough food for me. I was too full to finish the wild rice. The rice didn&#39;t have much flavor anyway. The noodles were delicious, but a little oily.

Minimum for credit card is $10, but there is no minimum for debit card. I&#39;m glad I had my debit card at the time. Otherwise, that would have been a hassle.

But for the location, price, variety and taste it&#39;s a great gourmet fast take-out box lunch/Korean buffet. I love coming here everytime when I&#39;m starving and not trying to take the whole time to sit down at a restaurant and splurge at least $20-$30/pp. It&#39;s an awesome grab if you&#39;re in a rush to a club nearby or when you get the munchies while drinking in K-town since it&#39;s open so late... I get really full for no more than $10 ever on myself here.

Most of their prepared hot take-out lunch boxes are under 7 bucks, averagely $5... Buffet is $8.99/lb which consist of mostly things they already have in a prepared quart/box to buy... I tend to opt for the buffet just to eat a little bit of everything. The spicy spare pork rib stew is delicious from the buffet, and I also always grab jap chae (clear noodles), bulgogi, steamed eggs, pan fried crab pancake, etc.. The fish is usually a hit or miss.. Dry or tasty. For pre-set lunch boxes; I like getting the kim chee fried rice with eggs and spicy beef w/ cheese kimbob roll.

But really... Explore... There&#39;s almost everything of Japanese-Korean style food packed in the boxes. Lots of soju, beer, and plenty non-alcoholic beverage.

I&#39;ve been to a karaoke spot but that&#39;s about it. Sooooo here&#39;s to knocking down my first meal. 

So upon arrival I was pretty taken by how busy it was but there were plenty of seats. I&#39;ve never been here before so all I can do is walk around first. There&#39;s so many options to choose from. I just took a little of everything hot and grabbed some of the chilled broccoli and kale that was very refreshing and crisp with a savory garlic flavor. I would literally need to go back 7 more times to try more food but for the most part it was really freaking tasty. 

They weight their buffet foods and the pricing wasn&#39;t anything to complain about. The fact that their is such a wide variety of alcohol choices to choose from and I never had Korean alcohol before, I couldn&#39;t help but to drink before work lol. Luckily I don&#39;t operate machinery lmao. There is a microwave in the back if you decide to take the foods that are prepared off the shelves. I&#39;d say I&#39;m skeptical of any sushi not kept in the fridge though. I also grabbed the fried squid off of the shelf and I was just like, mmm nah too oily but I love that sweet and salty sauce it comes with. It had a flowery taste to it lol. Those clear noodles are amazing especially with the crabmeat pancakes, goonie goo goo it was so good. Honestly I spent like $28 for my weighted food, the fried squid and a pineapple soju. 

Oh yeah, so I also found out this place is mostly known for pre-gaming before moving to your next night activity. I can easily see myself getting pretty liquored up here easy and not breaking my bank. Hopefully the food is still around late at night as well.

As long as u see the spicy red look, u will know, ok that is Korean spicy sauce flavor. Tho I still like it. ;)

This food court has many options, from cold dishes, hot food, salads, soup to porridge etc. They have pretty fair price among all deli, restaurants in k town. That&#39;s why u have to expect the line if u go there at peak time. 

They even have many choices of alcohol , from soju, sake, beer or even wine. But only for stay!

They open 7/24, so if u wanna comfort your empty stomach in mid night after karaoke, go there."

Woorijip is cross the street from the food court in Korean town. It is huge inside. When you stepped into the store, you will see a food counter, which is food buffet druing 11-3pm, 5pm - 8pm. You basically can eat whatever you want for most of the time. Also, they have setted food as well. Sushi, soup, blah blah blah.

Food: I had lunch buffet, including fried chicken, egg roll, some kimchi, and kimchi cucumber. All of them are declicious, especially their sweet tofu! I cannot get enough of it.

Service: everytime during the lunch time, there is a long line but it does go fast. Just be patient for the greatest korean food.

Overall: This is my go-to place during the weekday. YAY"

Was especially looking for something korean so I tried the beef kimbap and it was very good. It could have used a bit more sesame oil on the beef, but the rice was excellent  and so were the veggies. Very fresh and crunchy.

The other reviewers seem to have nailed all the other highlights so I won&#39;t bother to rehash them aside to say it was a great meal that I took and enjoyed in a nearby park, so everything turned out awesome. One of the many things to like about NYC."

It seems a little unfair that a block teeming with incredible Korean eats also just happens to have this buffet/grocer/sit-down canteen open at late hours. 

I will say, though, that the food here is best eaten immediately or (if you&#39;re taking it to go) within a few hours. I once got the beef kimbap for lunch the next day and my excitement crumbled as soon as I popped the first one into my mouth: sad wilted daikon and tough chewy rice. Maybe the dishes with sauce fare a little better. I liked the seafood tofu stew (especially paired with their wild rice), and I can&#39;t wait to try the chicken porridge. 

All in all, Woorijip is perfect on those Friday or weekend nights when you can&#39;t get a table at Pocha or Miss Korea BBQ. Here&#39;s a quite non-exhaustive list of their offerings: 

- Banchan (the times I&#39;m there, I&#39;ve seen kimchi, bean sprouts, picked chives, seaweed)
- Bimbap (beef, squid, wild tuna)
- Congee or porridge (chicken and pumpkin)
- Prepared bento boxes
- Meats over rice (chicken and eel)
- Tofu stew 
- Chicken in various forms (sesame chicken, fried chicken)
- Soups 
- Various pancakes (scallion, kimchi)
- Ddukboki
- Alcohol (soju and at least five different kinds of beer)
- Fried rice (veggie, kimchi with egg)

See? Something for everyone."

This place is laid out like a mini korean supermarket full of premade, delicious food. Ordered japchae, kimchi, seaweed, seafood pancake, tofu soup, curry. You name it they had it.

The food was so cheap and there were plenty of seats for our group of 10. The atmosphere is very festive late at night especially when the drunk crowd shows up. Our entire group loved this place and returned subsequent nights since it is open so late."

They have a selection of about 25 items to choose from. The quality of items was fairly unpredictable. 

The beef and chicken dishes were very good. Cooked slowly and with careful attention to maintaining tenderness. The vegetable roll was also pleasantly savoury and fresh in flavor.

 The pork and seafood items were terrible. The fried pork was tough to chew through. I gave up trying after the first piece took 30 seconds to scarf down. They &#34;crab cakes&#34; are fake crab meat and some type of glutenous filler. Not appealing. 

If you stick to the items I&#39;ve outlined above, I think you can have a 4 star experience at Woorijip."

I&#39;ve gone several times for the buffet during lunch.  Very simple pay-by-the-pound scheme, at very reasonable prices.  The quality is not going to be as high as in one of the good sit-down restaurants nearby.  

But the quality is reasonably good.  The benefit is the quick in-and-out nature of the buffet - get your food fast, get exactly what you want in whatever portions/ratios you want, pay a fair by-the-pound rate, and out the door.  It&#39;s very hard to beat for convenience.

They also have pre-made selections if you prefer those."

The kimbap (Korean style sushi) is filling and worth your money, since it&#39;s $5 or less. I appreciate their soymilk variety: they come in the regular, chocolate, and banana flavors, if you want to swig your meal down with something sweet, like I do.

I&#39;m giving this spot 3 stars (instead of the pre-planned 4) because the cashier service can be quite unfriendly. It&#39;s clear that they&#39;re prioritizing efficiency, but some courtesy would be nice instead of merely seeing each customer interaction as just a transaction.

The female cashier was pretty rude in particular-- when I handed her my credit card with my right hand (supported by my left) with the standard Korean courtesy, she slammed it onto the tray in front of her instead of handing it back directly to me, which I didn&#39;t expect."

Their hot buffet foods are pretty much all mediocre, cooked with little to no effort. I will usually come here if I&#39;m just looking for a quick meal without having to wait for the food to be made. What I usually go for is the already packaged foods, which are much more affordable than buffet. If you&#39;re only looking for something simple and cheap to eat, I suggest checking out this section first before you go to the buffet. Also, if you&#39;re going to get the buffet, do not DO NOT add the rice to the container (unless you&#39;re hell bent on getting kimchi fried rice, which is not that good by the way). They have regular white rice or the wild purple rice in an already packaged container near the cash register for only $1. Also make sure you get your customer loyalty card stamp! They don&#39;t really wave these in front of you anymore, but when I&#39;m there I always make it worth my money. You get one stamp for every $5 you spend....and it&#39;s going to take forever to get to 20 stamps but hey if it&#39;s going to save you some money on a particular meal, then why not. 

As for the seating, they have ample space for customers, but when it&#39;s lunch/dinner it can get pretty crowded in there. They also have sake and such so people go there to get cheap foods and then get drunk at the same time, so some people will stay there for a long long time. Even though the lines get pretty crazy during rush hours, the cashiers get it clean pretty efficiently so you don&#39;t have to worry about being stuck in line for 30 minutes. The staff also constantly check the buffet section so you don&#39;t have to worry about them running out of food or not restocking the food either."

So Woorijip is here to keep fill the void in your stomach. The food here may not be authentic Korean mamma quality, despite the name, but if you don&#39;t know one, and want fast, convenient food you can eat in or take out, you can avail yourself of the wide range of food here. There are prepackaged foods, from cold pickles, to soups, to rice to entrees to choose from. The salad and hot food buffet serves many of the same food in the packages, though you can pick and choose what you want and have fun trying foods you&#39;ve never tasted. Arshi K. was indeed correct in stating there are many vegetarian options, a bonus. Everything usually looks fresh, and mostly is, probably due in part to the high turnover. I been here numerous times and have never had a bad meal here. My fish the other day was actually tender and moist, which if you know grilled mackerel  isn&#39;t always an easy feat. Eat in paper containers are free, take out plastic ones will cost you. Water is free. There are tables for eat in, though at busy hours they might enforce the time limit they state. It&#39;s not a place for lingering anyway, too much traffic, too much noise. My favorite here is the fresh squid salad in chili sauce, with enough garlic to scare Dracula into converting to Christianity. I also like the jap chae, the futomaki, and the tofu stew over the kimchi fried rice. This place was a staple when I went to school close by. It&#39;s a fun place to eat, because of all the variety here. And depending on what you choose, the food can be quite good."

Rice dishes, kimbap, chicken, squid, etc. Are all there and constantly rotate with new options so it never gets old. They&#39;ll usually ask you to pay with debit instead of credit but prefer cash of course.

The food here is good, and for a quick food court-like place, very good. They have all sorts of options from kimbap to tofu soup, from seafood pancakes to pork belly. Some things are better than others, but I&#39;ve gone here a couple times and they&#39;re pretty consistent. For such a small place, they have so many different options, so if you like variety and to eat a lot of different flavors in one sitting, or if you&#39;re with a friend and you&#39;re in the mood for different Korean foods, this is the place for you.

BTW - they sell containers (pint-size) of seafood tofu soup for $3.50 here - SUCH a great price for what you&#39;re getting. There isn&#39;t a huge amount of seafood in it, but as a spicy tofu soup lover, I&#39;d say it definitely did the trick and I was very happy with what I got.

They also have beer here also :)

Service: B

The service is standard - there is staff at the registers, re-filling the food trays at the buffet station, etc. who keep the lines moving quickly. You grab a tray and get your own food either from the buffet (pay per pound) or from the shelves/racks/tables/fridges which have pre-prepared food both hot and cold. Then you get in line to pay at one of the two registers. It&#39;s a do-it-yourself kind of place - don&#39;t expect to be cleaned up after. After you&#39;re done eating, you bring your tray to the garbage and throw away your own trash. The staff are really only there to keep the place running quickly and smoothly, which they do really well. 

Ambiance: Not really applicable to the rating just because it&#39;s more of a food court type of place. But just so you know...

SUPER casual -food court/canteen-like. Not ideal for a date. It&#39;s got a kind of eat-and-run vibe. The food is readily available for you to grab from the buffet or pre-prepared on the shelves/racks, so you just get your food, pay, and pray you can find a seat to eat real quick. You feel kind of bad staying too long too, because you know other people are waiting/looking for a seat. 

Tldr; Great if you&#39;re having a Korean food craving and you need a quick fix, or if you&#39;re in a rush and don&#39;t have too much time for dinner. Very cheap for Korean food in Manhattan. I&#39;d come back, often :)

Back when I was just a recent college grad, I used to come here with my friends to drink $3 beers and $7 soju bottles to pre-game the night&#39;s actual shenanigans. Not only that, I&#39;ve witnessed many drunken patrons making fools of themselves (including myself) here, to a degree of great hilarity. Good times, good times.

That being said, the food quality ain&#39;t the greatest here, although it is cheaper than most anywhere you&#39;ll find in K-town, and there&#39;s something to be said in Manhattan. The good thing though, is that the food is tasty, in any state, and you&#39;ll definitely feel better about not paying that much. Most boxes don&#39;t go for over $7, and the buffet, while not the freshest, is only about $8 a pound. I usually go for the pre-packaged bulgogi and rice, spicy boneless chicken, or japchae (potato noodles). You can also get the boxes of fried rice for about $4. Perfect for a cheap quick lunch, if you work in the area.

The service is pretty efficient here, especially with the cleaning. And given that they&#39;re open until 2am and serve alcohol, food scraps usually aren&#39;t the only thing they&#39;re cleaning up (yuck). That being said, with any place that has a load of pre-made dishes and lunchboxes, I always recommend re-heating if you plan on taking stuff home, so as to make sure the food is properly cooked through.

I actually haven&#39;t stepped foot in Woorijip in a while, but have had it brought back to me by my friends/neighbors who work nearby. The sight of the Woorijip plastic boxes actually moves me to tears, thinking of growing up a poor young professional in New York City. Okay, maybe not moved to tears, but even though my memory may be playing tricks on me, I&#39;ll always have a soft spot for Woorijip. I will be back sometime soon, most likely to re-live my golden days. If you&#39;re looking for cheap, tasty eats and don&#39;t want to pay $30+ for Korean BBQ, Woorijip should be your first stop in K-town."

Woorijip has a wide selection of Korean food to choose from. There&#39;s a buffet near the cash register which offers $7.99 per pound. If you don&#39;t like anything you see, head to the back and there will be lunch/dinner boxes and soups to select from.Frequently, they come up with a new selection for customers to try.  The prices ranges from $6 to $9. 
Tip: if you look closely at some of the sets, you get either a free soda, water, or soup. 

The reason why I gave 3 stars is for the food quality. Since it&#39;s pre-made food it&#39;s not as fresh as other restaurants. The miso soup is okay, pretty average. I tried the beef rice box with vegetables, kimchi, rice, beef with rice cake. The beef was dry and hard to chew on. The rice cake was extremely chewy which I didn&#39;t like. Everything else was cold. I also tried the new chicken mayo rice bowl. The food was definitely getting cold. It didn&#39;t taste too bad but I was a little disappointed because it looked very appetizing. Overall, the food tastes pretty average, if not maybe a little worse than other restaurants.

I will come back here when it&#39;s late at night and I need some food in my stomach. But I would go to the food court during the day for fresh food."

They charge $7.99 per pound of food and offer a large variety of different pickles, kimchi, and hot Korean food. The buffet style is nice because you&#39;re able to pick exactly what and how much you want. There is plenty of seating within the restaurant, and the bathrooms are clean. 

I&#39;ve come here twice so far, and each time the buffet selection is similar with some variations. The second time I came, I had some kimbap (Korean sushi), bok choy, bean sprouts, braised tofu, chapjie, kimchi fried rice, bulgolgi, and crab pajun. 
My one complaint is that the bok choy was not washed thoroughly and I tasted grains of sand when eating it. Besides that, everything was as good as I remembered it to be."

I hit it for a weekday breakfast and was treated to a nice window seat. Went with the croissant scramble with avo: eggs delish and pouring out of the croissant. Middle east salad was different but good. Bonus points b/c they switched out my fries for fruit for free (don&#39;t tell them I told you). And no filler fruit crap but yummy strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. 

One annoying negative was the lack of wifi, even though they said they did but it didn&#39;t work. Not cool!

Still going with 5 stars for the food, nice server and ambiance. And cool motorcycle pics from like the 60s."

We were a group of 6 with a baby, and they were really nice about accommodating the baby even though they did not have booster seats (?). So they get major props for that. 

Ambience - Very airy and bright with big windows. Not sure how it translates at night. 

Drinks - They serve Verve coffee, that I didn&#39;t care much for. Maybe it was sitting out for too long or this coffee is just a bit acidic, not my favorite. We also had a couple of cocktails. The Bloody Marys we ordered were too weak, so we had to ask them to spike it. They gave us their vodka bottle and asked us to do it ourselves. One of my friends also tried the cider they had, it wasn&#39;t too bad. They were serving freshly squeezed orange juice that looked good. 

Food - The food is middle eastern mostly. They had loads of options for brunch. Lots of egg dishes. Plenty of vegetarian options. We started off with the Platter for the whole table and everyone loved the hummus and the pickled veggies. It&#39;s a great platter to share if you have a large group. The star of the table for me was the Shakshuka, really well made and served with some pita and harissa, it was lovely. There were the usual scrambles and omlettes, which were all ok. Have to also mention the sweet potato fries which were pretty fantastic. We also tried their pancakes, they were nice and fluffy. 

Overall I think this is a great place to grab brunch with friends. The service is unhurried and friendly and getting a reservation wasn&#39;t too hard."

From the moment we arrived until leaving everything was basically sub par. We were told it would be only about a 15 minute wait for 6 of us, which, because of the space size, was a pleasant surprise. However, after more than 15 minutes, we were offered to eat at the bar, which we agreed to (even though had we known that when we put our name down we wouldn&#39;t have - 6 people sitting side by side at a bar is not ideal for conversation and not what we were looking for) and as we walked over we were told &#34;most of us&#34; could fit. What? Why would you seat us at the bar when we can&#39;t all even sit there and it&#39;s already not what we wanted anyway?

So half of us are standing half are sitting, we order drinks to get started and complain about the seating situation so they tell us once the table behind us leaves, we can have it. The table that literally JUST got their food. Ok. About another 20 minutes later and they move one of the two tables that group had put together to accommodate another group. WHAT? Now there&#39;s the same amount of room at our future table that there is at a bar. Couldn&#39;t even squeeze another chair in because the half of our table that they gave away is inches from the original table. Obviously getting frustrated now. 

We decide to look at menus and start ordering in the hopes that we&#39;ll be seated and get our food right away. I finally had to complain again and ask where they planned on seating us since they had just split our original table and the host reassured me that it would be fine. They ended up moving the group down a table and when it finally opened up they sat us there. While I did appreciate them eventually accommodating us, it seems like they don&#39;t have a problem asking people to get up and move their stuff and food to sit somewhere else, which I&#39;d be pretty annoyed about and seems unprofessional. 

Once we were seated, it still took another 30-45 minutes to get our food, which was really frustrating considering how much earlier we had ordered it and that the entire point had been to have our food closer to when we were seated. Once it did arrive, I was less than impressed I got the croissant scramble, which was literally just that - a croissant with scrambled eggs inside. There was one slice of avocado on it that was barely noticeable and I ended up drenching the entire thing in hot sauce because it had NO flavor. It did come with fries though, which I have to say, after tasting everyone else&#39;s dishes were the best part of the meal. 

Once we were seated and eating, it took a lot to flag the waitress down for even simple requests like more water or the check. Really frustrating. 

Pretty bummed because I&#39;ve heard such great things, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d come back. There was nothing truly terrible about eating here, but nothing that made me think it will be worth giving another chance!"

The restaurant was empty save for a very loud group of frat boys and a pair of middle aged women. The space was nicely decorated and open but our experience was very average. 

The menu looked great and a very interesting mix of european and Middle Eastern. We ordered the Tunisian sandwich with fries and the tilapia. While the fries and sandwich were great, the tilapia was a bit disappointing. The dish came with a generous filet of tilapia that was well cooked and tender but the accompaniments were lackluster. The tomato-olive relish was bitter and sour and the mashed potatoes were watery and bland. Normally I would write off as a bad choice on my part but the service was also disappointing. There were only about eight people in the restaurant and more than one server but it took very long to get our order and no one to ask about our order. When we asked for our check, I had to prompt the server to look up from her phone to give us the check, only to be met with a very sour expression.

Spiegel overs breakfast with a middle eastern flavor to it. I went here on a beautiful day and thought the outside seating here overs some great people watching to have with my breakfast. This cafe style restaurant is very casual and relaxed. It would be a great place to grab a quick bite.

When my group got there we grabbed an outside table right on 1st avenue and ordered coffee right away. The coffee was very good it did not even need any milk or sugar. For my main dish I ordered the Three eggs any style platter - which is 3 organic eggs, fries, Israeli salad, Labane, Zaatar and a choice of bread. The dish was exactly what I expected but it did not wow me and i thought the israeli salad was pretty bland. The labane with the bread dipped in though was delicious. 

In regards to service they did mess up a few things but were quick to fix it. I will be back here for breakfast/brunch in the future because of how easy it is to get a table and the prices were very fair.

Our go to beverages are usually the fresh juice which you can choose any combination of things to add or their iced coffee. 

For brunch we usually go with the shakshuka and the egg croissant - both such happy comfort foods we have trouble switching. I&#39;ve also had friends order the schnitzel sandwich and rave about it.

I came here on Saturday around 9:45AM and there were a couple of customers inside, but still plenty of tables. You get to choose where to sit - inside or outside and which table. Nice.

My friend and I were looking at the breakfast menu, and (the obsessive Yelper that I am) I didn&#39;t see an entree on the menu that I had seen a photo of on Yelp. I showed the waitress the picture, and she explained that they offered brunch specialities, however, that specific one was not available that day. Then she asked us if we wanted to order from the brunch menu instead, to which we responded, &#34;Duh.&#34; (Yes)

Unfortunately I didn&#39;t like anything from the brunch menu. I was a bit hungover and feeling it, so I thought to avoid too much meat. Non-hangover me would have lost it at the brunch menu, though! Instead, I ordered the Croissant Sandwich (eggs &amp; avocado spread) with fries and salad ($9). And it was delicious, but I had thought/still wish the sandwich had meat in it. My friend ordered the Veggie Omelette ($9) and it looked delicious! Case in point, you can&#39;t go wrong here.

Bonus: THIS PLACE SERVES HOT CIDER.

The service was amazing! Our waitress was so nice, and although she handed us the check pretty quick, she told us, &#34;No rush.&#34;

We stayed there for 2 full hours chatting away, but not because she said don&#39;t rush and we were taking advantage of this opportunity! No one gave us side eyes or glared at us. The waiters and busboys continued to pour our water as if we just sat down! It was refreshing not being kicked out of the restaurant, especially during prime brunch hours.

And last but not least, the price!! Holy cow, my total came up to $14.30 for my meal and hot cider! Amazing price for brunch. I can&#39;t wait for the next time I come back!

Cailin&#39;s Recommendations:
- Omelette: onion, mushroom, spinach, and tomato, mixed greens, and toast - $12
- Chilaquiles*: eggs over corn tortilla chips, cotija cheese and green salad (+$3 for portobello, +$5 for chicken) - $11
- Hot Cider - $3.75

* I haven&#39;t tried this yet, but as I&#39;m writing this review it sounds delicious!"

Found it by chance when I was looking for a place to sit outside and have a nice glass of wine and sandwich after a three hour odyssey from JFK to Manhattan.
The sweet and attentive waitress was such a welcome difference to the grumpy shared car driver earlier. And what she brought me at this moment tasted like the most delicious meal I have ever had. I had a vegetarian sandwich, which turned out to be more of a burger, with a side of quinoa salad. As I said both extremely delicious. And accompanied by a nice glass of white wine.
The prices weren&#39;t the cheapest ones, but I think that&#39;s just fair for a beautiful place like this.
If I could I would add a bonus star for the service.

And if I lived here, this would definitely be one of my most favourite places."

I ordered the shakshuka and my guy ordered the waffles. The shakshuka was amazing - poached egg in a tomato-based sauce with pepper and eggplant. The sauce was tasty and flavorful. It was served with warm pita on the side and a small spoonful of Greek yogurt. I made the mistake of ordering the eggs cooked all the way through - next time I will have them poached. In this dish, a runny yolk would have been better :). 

The waffles were delicious! The dulce de leche sauce was sweet but not overpowering, and combined with mixed berries it was a game changer.  the waffles were nice and fluffy. Ask for extra sauce on the side. Trust me on this. 

The mimosa and hibiscus wine we ordered were good as well. The prices are extremely reasonable. This is a very small joint, but a good cozy place to meet friends. Good ambiance indoors, and outdoor seating in warmer months. However, service is quite slow. This is definitely a place to go when you are not under any rush or strict timeline.

Friendly and welcoming service attended to me; I experienced none of the issues several reviewers had, but it was a quiet Tuesday morning.

(in case management is reading this: I&#39;d suggest investing in some simple tin teapots, it improves the brew). My fears were allayed by the delicious dish I&#39;d ordered, 3 scrambled eggs with fries and a very tasty middle eastern-type salad.  (see photo) **It is worth coming here just for the fries:  they are amazingly crispy, having been double fried** Screw the fat content and gimme more of those fries.

Nice guy running the counter in this corner location took a while to produce a menu (they keep it near the retired menu sandwich board near the restrooms advertising foregone lunch specials, as they have a different out outside near a bench) but took my order for the Tunisian sandwich with Moroccan carrots. Dined in by the window as power tools blared in their under-construction vestibule. Sandwich was enjoyed once it finally emerged, but I went to pay and realized there was another $10+ that needed to be spent.
The salad was substantial but naturally skewed to the cheaper items so the poor proportion of avocado (overripe) to cauliflower (unevenly chopped) was particularly pronounced. They do have a nice selection of beers on tap and some great floor-to-ceiling windows, frequented by an East Village/Alphabet City crowd whenever they&#39;re open.

The thing that threw me off about this place was the service.  We were starving and my boyfriend ordered the french toast which our server neglected to tell us would take a while.  We sat waiting for about 30 minutes and we were getting really hangry.  After we asked a couple times where our food was, they informed us french toast takes longer.  Our original server disappeared, one server couldn&#39;t care less about our wait, and the third server was a very sweet girl who was apologetic and brought us free juices and offered us pastries.  She is the only reason this place isn&#39;t getting 2 stars!

The french toast wasn&#39;t too stand out, but it came with eggs which was nice.  I had the breakfast burrito and I asked them to add egg whites (they made a mistake and gave me whole eggs but at that point I didn&#39;t care).  I was confused that the breakfast burrito only had veggies (it doesn&#39;t come with eggs), so I recommended adding if you actually want a substantial breakfast.

The cold brew coffee is great, and prices aren&#39;t too bad. This is definitely a fun place to chill and get some work done, or to enjoy a bite with friends at a hip but not not-too-trendy neighborhood joint. Would definitely go back to check out the lunch/dinner menu."

Our server was attentive, friendly, and brought us our menus and waters pretty much immediately. The menu had a medium sized selection, but decent variety. I asked for the fresh pressed juice, but the server told either told me the juicer wasn&#39;t working or they didn&#39;t have the produce necessary to make the juice, I don&#39;t remember! Bottom line: no juice. 

I ordered the grilled portobello sandwich (with an added egg, over medium), which comes with a side, for which I chose sweet potato fries. The food came out relatively quickly, within 10-15 minutes. 

The serving of fries was pretty large, enough to comfortably share with a friend (I was pretty hungry) and the sandwich was not bad either, sizewise. However, the mushroom and eggplant inside the sandwich seemed a bit over-blackened, so I couldn&#39;t really taste a ton. Neither was it very flavorful; most of the flavor seemed to come from the halloumi cheese, so I ended up eating a large portion of the sandwich with ketchup. More of the herb aioli would have been ideal! The fries were yum, though. Some of the people I was with lamented the smallness of their portions, but I thought mine was totally fine. 

Overall, not crazy, but would probably come here again if I were in the area."

This was a bit surprising and embarrassing after I had just mentioned that I was hesitant. 
I would say that this curb side friendliness convinced us to give it a try.. The food is an eclectic Mediterranean mixed concept using only the most fresh ingredients.  The owner welcomed us to our table and asked us what we would like. We were debating like girls do. He then said don&#39;t worry the meal is on the house and he would pick our dishes. 
Wow what great service. That definitely made our day!
First he brought us two cappuccinos which was really good coffee.
Then to start he brought the spiegel chopped. My friend and I shared It was delicious. Then he brought tunisian sandwich. Yum It was so good..

On a very windy and rainy Friday night, I found myself here exploring a place I probably would&#39;ve not known about except that I do have some Middle Eastern ties. 

A like-minded special friend was visiting and we decided to meet up here to catch up. I arrived close to 11pm and found my friends sitting at the bar. My first feeling of this place was that it was romantic and quiet. Candles strategically placed on the bar created a sexy but mature vibe. 

We moved to a high top table so we could squeeze in more people. I&#39;ve never had Israeli wine, and this was my first time trying it and well, it won&#39;t be my last time. The wine just kept flowing and as we drank more, the conversations got better and better. 

My friends know the owner and he just hung around and chatted with us. At one point, we were outside and I asked him, &#34;so...how long have you been open?&#34; And he replies, &#34;Well, I have been open for business all my life.&#34; And with that response, he got laughter out of all of us. But jokes aside, this place has been open for about 3 weeks. Nice addition to the East Village. 

As sobriety became a pipe dream, topics touched upon included Israeli men being more hot than Syrian men, and depending on the beauty of the woman, she could be worth 70 camels or 70 Bentleys. Hahaha. 

Great place to just catch up with friends and drink the night away. This place does close early (around 11pm or so), but if you know the right people, you won&#39;t be kicked out until close to 2am. Don&#39;t expect food, just keep drinking.  

I&#39;ll definitely be back to try the food and to indulge in more Middle Eastern wine and ahem,  Middle Eastern men..."

Think of this as the Chipotle of Mediterranean food (sans E. coli, of course!) I would choose eating here over Chipotle any day, of course.

Try the Touka Chicken bowl. And the olive hummus is one of their standout sides if you are an olive person. 

This is the perfect place to pick up a quick healthy lunch, and I&#39;ll be returning here a lot, living in East Village. Five stars, great to have an option like this in the neighborhood."

But if you&#39;re looking for something quick with no long lines, you&#39;ll be able to get in and out of Semsom in a flash. A custom bowl comes with a base (rice, lettuce, or half and half), a main, two toppings, and complimentary fixings (tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, basil, sauces). 

I tried the taouk chicken my first time and the wild-thyme cauliflower my second time here. The taouk chicken did not taste good at all. It was really flavorless and dry. I only ate a few pieces of the chicken and just could not force down the rest. The cauliflower was more flavorful, but the scoop I got was all broken down pieces of cauliflower. Kind of expected more cauliflower or at least larger pieces of cauliflower. I guess if you want a larger portion go for the meat mains.

For the two toppings, I tried the pickled mushrooms and sweet and sour eggplant. Both are on the vinegary side. They are also really stingy with the complimentary toppings. I literally only got 3 grape tomato halves and 3 slices of cucumber. I was supposed to get 4 grape tomato halves, but one fell off as the person was putting it in my bowl.

What they do have going for them is their amazing hummus and turmeric rice. The hummus is a lot better than the hummus at The Hummus and Pita Co. and way better than any packaged kind. It has an unbelievably smooth texture and tastes delicious and fresh. You can really taste the olive oil in it. I love the turmeric rice just as much. I thought it had a lot more flavor than the chicken at least. If it&#39;s possible, I think I would only get a side of their hummus and a side of their turmeric rice."

Just like Chipotle, you start with a base. I picked turmeric brown rice, topped it with sweet and sour eggplant (which was a really amazing add-on), roasted cauliflower, cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach, and topped it off with yogurt.

I came here for the first time today, and everything about this spot was on point: my server welcomed me warmly and accommodated my dairy restrictions (I&#39;m lactose intolerant and didn&#39;t have my lactaid pills with me today), and there are couches / loveseats as options if you eat in. 

Food wise, I got the Touka Chicken bowl, with sweet and sour eggplant being the most distinctive add-on. I mostly enjoyed this dish, and the chicken was tasty since it was well seasoned on the outside, but it was rather dry on the inside. The eggplant was uniquely prepared (I&#39;ve never seen it in a sweet and sour style before), and it was definitely to my taste, since I enjoy sweets.

The mini grocery store / goods shelves add something interesting to this eatery: there are cookbooks, small jars of several spices/seasonings, tea leaves, and other items on the shelves to your right as you walk in the door: definitely nice to check out if you&#39;re ever waiting in line at this place."

The Taouk chicken, which was the star of the dish, wasn&#39;t that good since I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the seasoning and because it was a little too dry. I&#39;ll probably choose something else like the cauliflower next time. Everything else was delicious though! The hummus had just the right amount of saltiness to it and was very smooth. Some people might say the pickled mushrooms are too sour but I like sour food so I found them to be very tasty. Tomatoes were great as well but they did give a small portion of the lettuce.

I have long tried to emulate hummus in my own kitchen but to no avail. Quite simply, it&#39;s nowhere near as good as Semson&#39;s. Semson&#39;s is creamy and smooth, with just the right amount of flavor. Plain is great, but if you want something different try other flavors like sriracha. An order costs about $4 and comes with a bag of Brooklyn Baked Pita chips. 

Note that when I visited in March 2016, Semson gave out a complementary hummus after checking in with the Yelp app. Check it out to see if it&#39;s still active! 

Roasted veggies are all the rage these days, because they mellow out the flavor of vegetables and make them slightly sweet and crispy while preserving their nutritional value. Semson actually marinates their cauliflower with spices like sumac for lemon-like and splashes on pomegranate molasses for a deep, tart finish. Roasted cauliflower is a basic dish, and I make it often, but like my hummus, it pales in comparison to Semson&#39;s.

There are two things I wasn&#39;t sold with at Semson. 

The beef shawarma is very different from traditional shawarma I&#39;ve had. The flavor profile is different and the meat was not as juicy. It was still enjoyable in its own right, but I would have much prefered the cauliflower. Unlike Chipotle, Semson doesn&#39;t do half and half, meaning you have to commit to just one protein selection. With so many different options, I wish that they offered this (I could have gotten the cauliflower if I selected the &#34;double meat&#34; option and paid $2.75 extra).

The to-go containers are flimsy. The cardboard top doesn&#39;t really lock in tight, meaning you have to be careful when doing take-out. I wish they&#39;d have another option, because given its proximity to NYU and the 6 Astor Place subway I anticipate on stopping by a lot. 

I&#39;m glad that Semson brings in authentic flavors without at all sacrificing health benefits."

I ordered a bowl with the Taouk Chicken with rice and chose the eggplant and hummus as my sides (you get two). And, you can add cucumber, tomato, and spinach for free. I thought the chicken was kinda dry and weirdly chewy. The eggplant had an interesting flavor: not the biggest fan. The best part was definitely the hummus. 

I also ordered a mulberry lemonade and that was very bitter and set me back 3 bucks. By the end of the bottle I got used to it though.

Plus, check in on Yelp and get a giant serving of hummus (I got the Sriracha variety) with your choice of sea salt or multigrain chips. 

The servers were beyond sweet, letting us try the main options (chicken, cauliflower, beans, etc.), reminding us about the student deal, and being so patient all around.

I came here one night for dinner by myself. I was starving, and this place seemed promising. It has a Chipotle-like feel to it, where you go down the row and choose your toppings. They seemed to have a lot of savory, Mediterranean options to choose. You get a lot for the price, which is always nice.

The food was alright. Great for fast-food type service, but not the best Mediterranean meal I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s a pretty large portion, too, which is nice, but almost too much. I do wish hummus wasn&#39;t extra, because I would have really wanted to try their hummus. Interesting concept. Good place for lunch. Just not the best Mediterranean food I&#39;ve ever had."

I have been standing in the counter for a while without knowing what to order, one of the waitresses came to me and briefly explained how it works and what are her favorites. Very helpful! So I went with her suggestion and ordered the romaine with taouk chicken, with hummus and cabbage as toppings. Also would like to try out their specialty rose water. Really love their chicken, flavorful chewy yet only a little bit dry...the water, on the other hand, was disappointing.

Would for sure returning. This place beat chipotle (as everyone seems to compare it with that) with no doubt."

The Astor Place casual Mediterranean stop is spotless and brightly-lit. They even have a little couch corner - perfect place to get cozy on a windy, cold day. AND a Winnie-the-Pooh quote. Which is, obviously, as good as it gets in this world. 

The options all sounded incredible, and we were lucky enough to meet Carine (one of the founders) and chat with her for a while about everything under the sun - from strategy consulting to spreadsheets to travel to world events to coffee, and of course, food. 

We were able to taste all of the amazing entree options. I settled on the wild-thyme cauliflower, and Kat had the chicken. The hummus side and tabbouleh was an incredible combination. A lot of great vegetarian- and vegan-friendly options. They even have breakfast options.

Everything was fresh, healthy, and delicious. We loved the display of various Mediterranean spices and other goodies on the right side of the store. 

I can&#39;t wait to come back again. Especially to try dessert. 

It was semsomdipitious, to say the least."

I wanted to try this place for touting Mediterranean food served chipotle style.

The only sauces they offer are tehini.

All of the ingredients taste super fresh and healthy. The cauliflower is definitely a must try! I normally hate cauliflower but they add some special spice to it that makes it bomb.com. I could eat their cauliflower for the rest of my life and probably be very content. The rice is also bombomb.com.

The &#34;Make Your Own Hummus&#34; was also a plus that made this place so easy to fall in love with. This place seemed so perfect at the time.

I&#39;ve been meaning to return and finally give this place my business. I was prepared to turn the cries of my rumbling stomach into a bloated one of these days. Cue last Thursday night, when I figured Semson would be the best cure to my immense hours-long hunger, I rushed my way to this conveniently located eatery. About 30 minutes left until closing, they sure were ready to wrap containers of food up, but there was still plenty of food left. I got the Taouk Chicken Bowl with salad, yogurt, and cabbage salad. Very skimpy portions of everything (roughly about a fifth- to a sixth cup-sized portions) that left for plenty of views of the bottom of the bowl. Maybe because I was a bothered with my portions but I wasn&#39;t blown away with this meal this time around. The chicken was good, the cabbage salad was average and the mint yogurt was standard, but paying over $10 for the amount of food that I got didn&#39;t help how I felt.

Granted it was near closing but plenty of food was left and I&#39;m sure they toss out leftovers, so why they were so skimpy on portions, I don&#39;t know. I guess it&#39;ll pass for a Mediterranean Diet of small portions."

Semsom is stylized like a Mediterranean Chipotle. You choose wrap or bowl, choose your protein, your carbs, and then go through with different veggies and then top it off with the sauce of your choice. Service was great during this event. The owners are super outgoing, knowledgable, and enthusiastic. 

Feel free to ask for samples- they&#39;re very generous. It&#39;s also helpful to try out their various unique flavored before committing to something you may not be expecting. The ingredients are all so fresh, and they apparently prepare everything the day of. The Lebanese meatballs and -- are delicious. I didn&#39;t get a chance to try their cauliflower, but according to one of the executives of the restaurant, it&#39;s as if they sprinkled crack on the cauliflower- it&#39;s that good! I&#39;ll have to go back and try the cauliflower. The eggplant is very interesting, marinated in a special Lebanese sauce that I think comprises of some fruit and vinegar? I can&#39;t remember the details. For around $10/bowl of healthy, wholesome food, they can&#39;t be beat! If you like your food bland, though, Semsom is not for you. Prepare to be introduced to a variety of spices!

They also have some delicious drinks here, from iced hibiscus tea to rose lemonade. 

The joint is not large, but is decorated in a modern but quaint way. Very homey! And they&#39;re conveniently located right off the Astor place stop off the 6 train. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back to try more of their menu. Keep it up, Semsom!"

Inside, is super gorgeous and has comfy seating. It&#39;s so perfect for NYU students to meet up in groups with friends cause there is enough space (most of the time). When they 1st opened up, they gave out hummus cups in the street which was really good but of course its a dollar extra. 

The food was OK but for the portion, I did not feel I got the best bang for my buck. I ordered the chicken taouk which had an excellent flavor but really oily. They give you some options for sides like sweet &amp; sour eggplant and taboule, which I ordered and the scoop I got was so microscopic the guy&#39;s hand was shaking so hard giving me that tiny portion. I was kinda disheartened that I even forgot to ask for the student discount. 

However, the most important part is that the seating here is really nice and I was able to find a spot to sit with some friends and chat and have a nice time which is more important to me. 

I plan to give Semsom another chance in the future, but for now I prefer Maoz closeby for my Mediterranean crave."

The story of how the restaurant came to be is interesting (I won&#39;t spoil it for you, it&#39;s painted on the walls). I also chatted with both owners who were there and they were extremely friendly.

I like that they keep the menu simple and skip having an overwhelming amount of combinations. Being vegan, I get the cauliflower over turmeric rice and add a few toppings including hummus to keep me satiated. There&#39;s a pumpkin patty too but i found it dry so I choose the veggies. They even have a fridge with some popular packaged to-go items. 

The vibe inside is very much like a coffee shop, which makes it enjoyable to stick around as opposed to eating at my desk. If you come every so often, definitely ask for the rewards card too which they stash at the register in a little box.

The only improvement I could see is a tofu option marinated in something similar to the chicken. Then I&#39;d probably go a bit more frequently."

The meal itself was fine, just fine!

I had a romaine base with Taouk chicken (which was dry), hummus (a glob the size of a baseball mit), coleslaw salad (actually pretty decent), grape tomatoes, and cucumbers (which included about a half a bite of cucumber and two grape tomatoes as they were out and apparently couldn&#39;t be disturbed to get more) all topped with a spicy sauce. 

Overall, it was kind of a lackluster experience! I guess I just wanted more.

I will say off the bat, what makes them different is their overlooked front section where they sell cute cards with vegetables (yeah, this sounds weird, but I swear the veggies look cute and happy... I&#39;ll take a pic next time), cool spices like sumac + tumeric, loose leaf teas, bottled rose water, etc. 
It&#39;s like a mini kitchen/spice store with cute gift ideas and things you really don&#39;t need, but want and are probably going to buy. 

Food-
Wild Thyme Cauliflower: 
Soooo delicious. The cauliflower is cooked perfectly: still holds its structure so you can bite into it, but soft enough that it&#39;s easy to chew. The flavor, spot on, is bold and brings out the creamy goodness the vegetable deserves. 

Chicken Taouk:
Best meat protein choice. It&#39;s moist and packed with flavor- smokey, slight spice, and savory in a way that increases your saliva production. Yeah, I got scientific on ya.

Meatball- Skip
Bland, dare I say? Almost on the... dry side :( ugh. Nobody likes a dryish, bland meatball. However, paired with the eggplant, it balances out the eggplant&#39;s intensity. Do you really want to get a meat so that it can calm down a vegetable though? Probs not.

Eggplant: 
When I had my first (tiny) bite, I thought, &#34;wow! It&#39;s so good...it kicks you with an acidic/sour heat you like.&#34; Then, I had more bites... overwhelming. Definitely had to enjoy it in small amounts and as an accompaniment to a mildly flavored protein. 

Tzatziki: Always top a mediterranean bowl with tzatziki. Trust me- it&#39;s a cool, refreshing cucumber-yogurt mix 

Rose Lemonade: Really interesting. It&#39;s a delicate mix of rose water and lemonade, and tastes just like it sounds. If you don&#39;t think you&#39;d like the taste of a rose petal, don&#39;t order it.

Despite trying all of this at a Yelp event, I would come again if I&#39;m in the area. It would be a great post-workout meal or basically... whenever I&#39;m starving because it&#39;s filling."

The mushroom side was a bit sour for my taste, I was hoping it would be a bit sweeter. Eggplant side is a better choice. I was not too fond of the steak, as it seemed to be sort of &#34;boiled&#34; versus grilled or even slow braised, thus resulting in a rather non-memorable taste &amp; a bit chewy as well.

Hummus was ok but tahini heavy

I find Lebanese food to be extremely unique in their flavors, as they use things *americans* don&#39;t normally get to taste like mint... and other un-identifable herbs that I cannot name lol.  When I think of mediterranean food I think of Greek food with gyros and greek salad, but really this Lebanese food is the BOMB!! I seriously cannot describe their flavors, but if youre feeling a bit adventurous, this is definitely the place to try.

I had a half salad and half rice bowl with tauok chicken, hummus, eggplant, yogurt, and cucumbers.  Their veggie toppings were unlimited. I wish I took advantage of that but foolish me did not.  Their humus is DELICIOUS.  Still drooling thinking about all that flavor.  At first I thought I didn&#39;t get much for the price paid (~$13) but I was so full and satisfied.  Seriously, so tasty.

I ordered the chicken on a bed of rice and everything was fragrant, and the presentation beautiful.

Their hummus is unique and absolutely delicious. I topped it off with some tomatoes and cucumbers.

In fact, this place should belong on my list of &#34;Most Disappointing Mediterranean Fast-Food Spots in NYC&#34;.

I came here at about 7PM to grab a quick bite with my boyfriend.I got a wrap and asked for the Taouk Chicken, since it seems that their protein options are pretty limited (how can you advertise yourself as a Mediterranean cuisine if you don&#39;t have the Mediterranean staples like shwarma and kabob?). The chicken had a sour taste to it, which wasn&#39;t very pleasant.

I also asked for the bulgur pilaf (which is one of the sides), but unfortunately they ran out, so I opted for the eggplant and yogurt dip instead. They were also almost out of hummus so I barely got a smear of it on my wrap. Overall, the flavors really didn&#39;t go well together because I had a very weird tasting wrap at the end of it. The chicken was just funky.

My boyfriend got a wrap with meatballs, but of course, they only had a couple meatballs left, so they gave him that and a combination of the other beef. Poor guy didn&#39;t even get hummus because they were all out!

Taking a few stars off just for not having adequate supply of food to serve its customers, which limits our options by a lot. We came 3 hours before closing time so this should certainly be a concern for the business to improve on."

By the time I got to my bowl, it was already cold (boo at night time classes..), and unfortunately, the meatballs are not all that tasty when they are cold.

What&#39;s great about this place is they have more than just the typical falael condiments. I&#39;m not sure if the menu rotates, but when I was there (for a fantastic elite event - thanks Ruggy!), they had a cauliflower sauteed thing that had so many good things about it, I lost track when the owner started telling me about it. The workers there were all so friendly, and the food was all so good!!! They also have other cute things in the shop for sale (soaps, spices, etc), and we were given a little gift basket of tea and za&#39;taar (my absolutely favorite).

But, I wasn&#39;t impressed the first time I tried their sample of tumeric chicken and rice on the street, which is why I&#39;ve by-passed this place in the months since it&#39;s opening. This past Tuesday though, I decided it was high time I gave the place a solid try. 

The servers were very friendly and accommodating: explaining the proteins, getting me the price of the prepackaged salad ($3.80), and even giving me a small sample of all of the drizzle flavors since it was my first time. But I wasn&#39;t so impressed. I found the tumeric rice as bland as when I first tried it on the street. The taouk chicken, I was told, is their best selling protein and it didn&#39;t fail: stewed in a tomato-vinegar broth, the chicken was moist and flavorful- but that&#39;s the only high point. I found all the other drizzles good, but unremarkable. Stay away from the sweet and sour eggplant unless you like the taste of jolly ranchers with your savories. The hummus was indeed light. So light I really had to concentrate to pick up on the slight smokiness, but I&#39;m not sure if it stands up to Hummas &amp; Pita co which is just a few blocks north on Broadway.   

I&#39;m glad that this place has a following; I&#39;m glad that they&#39;re providing relatively healthy food options, and that their store is large with lots of seating, but even though this place replaced the sleepy Financier Patisserie, the customer flow doesn&#39;t seem any higher than its predecessor."

But now it&#39;s happened at every recent visit and I&#39;m wondering if they changed the way their proteins are prepared. I see that a review below complains about how &#34;oily&#34; the chicken is- maybe they changed it in response to him. I beg you guys, change it back!

The atmosphere is very fresh, bright, and inviting. It had cozy looking wooden bar tables, bright fabric comfy chairs, and a dark purple sofa seating for groups. The floor tiles were black and white pattern that gave it a very mediterranean feel. The wall in the main seating area has an enlarged picture of a girl with yellow balloons in an open sunny field. The staff was really warm and immediately offered for me to try things on the menu. 

The menu consists of 3 parts. You first pick whether you want a bowl or a wrap. You can pick romaine lettuce, rice, or hummus for the bowl. A bowl with hummus, however, is a dollar extra. There are also two selections for the wrap. Whichever way you go, you will then pick the main. They have two chicken, a meatball, beef, and two vegetarian choices. After that, there are 4 sauces you pick from and you can add optional cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, tahini sauce, etc. And that wraps up your order. 

I sampled the toauk chicken and instantly fell in love with it. The hummus is a bit salty, but with the combo of the other items, it balances out quite well. So far, I had tried the toauk chicken with hummus, lettuce, cucumbers and yogurt sauce wrap and the hummus toauk bowl. Obviously, I just can&#39;t get enough of the toauk chicken! I&#39;ve sampled the meatball and tumeric rice, but I keep going back to the hummus and toauk chicken. 

I&#39;m so glad, I found this place as the food is fresh and I feel super healthy having my veggies. Another awesome thing is that they offer iced water also with the meal free of charge. Having water definitely made me feel even healthier. This place is an incredible addition to the area!"

unfortunately, the food was nothing to really write to home about. i&#39;m a sucker for turmeric so i chose the turmeric chicken with half rice/salad, and chose the eggplant and mint yogurt as my toppings, with the cucumbers and tomatoes to top it off. i opted out of tahini, and perhaps that may have been why my bowl missed the mark. the chicken was decently seasoned, but man was it dry. the rice was too similar to the chicken and made each bite a bit too salty. i really did like the mint yogurt--it helped curb the salt with that fresh mint tang you&#39;d seek in a yogurt sauce.

on the other hand, that eggplant was great! a great amount of spice, super refreshing, and sat well with that dollop of mint yogurt.

i also used the check-in thing for the hummus and pita chips. you get to choose from the three they have available: original, sriracha and olive. i chose the original, and i think it was a good hummus! i think ultimately i much prefer mamoun&#39;s, though.

probably won&#39;t be back because the bowl in its entirety was pretty underwhelming, but thanks for the nice experience!"

The patties were awful - dry, bland, not a hint of pumpkin flavor or color, I wish I had tried the other protein choices instead. The eggplant was very strange and sour, I only ate it to counteract the spiciness of the sauce that was drizzled a little too generously onto my rice.

He explained to us the initial concept of the restaurant, the stages at which it grew, the inspirations of its cuisine, and his own personal role and relationship with the franchise. The servers explained to us the various dishes and we got to building our Mediterranean bowls right away. I had a scoop of rice with the Lebanese meatballs, sweet and sour eggplant, roasted cauliflower, hummus, mint, yogurt, carrot slaw, and lettuce. My girlfriend had a similar blend except with the taouk chicken as her main protein.

These bowls looked amazing! Pipping hot and filled to the brim, I could see the heat rising from the surface. The gf spent several minutes cataloguing the food with her camera. Then we jumped into the food. It was Mediterranean perfection! I remember a year or so ago there was a similar restaurant near Columbus Circle that closed. I was sad about its disappearance, but glad that Semsom has sprouted in New York to take its place. While a bit pricier compared to other fast food locations, what you may lose in a few coins is made up by the quality and freshness of the ingredients. I thought that the meatballs were a tad dry, but that may be because we were photographing it for 5 minutes. The taouk chicken my gf ordered was perfectly juicy and seasoned. The various sides that the bowl came with had very authentic (maybe not, I&#39;m Asian. I have no idea what authentic Med food is, but it was delicious) tastes and complimented the proteins provided. The hummus was a nice addition to give the food a grounded flavor. I loved experimenting with the different tastes that the various sides offered. 

We loved our experience here and we are definitely going to return. I have been told that the pumpkin falafel patty and the Lebanese meatball options are going to be switched out. I can&#39;t wait to see what the new surprises will be!"

Just finished my second meal here, and it is most certainly my last. I&#39;m getting nervous about this unstoppable proliferation of &#34;wrap and bowl&#34; fast-casual restaurants. Some do it well (e.g., Indikitch, Naya), some are so-so (e.g., Korilla), but Semsom just completely misses the boat. Looking at the online pictures of Semsom&#39;s beautiful menu items they feature in their Middle East locations (in Kuwait and Lebanon, and apparently not fast food), I can safely say we were duped with some dumbed-down version of what could otherwise be delicious cuisine aimed at a non-discriminating, faux-health-conscious American consumer that probably dines at Energy Kitchen and Dig Inn.

The first visit, I ordered the Chicken Taouk bowl, and the second time the Sumac Chicken bowl. In both cases, the boneless, skinless white meat chicken pieces were extremely dry, stringy, and low on flavor. The rice consists of large, swollen grains with some saffron flavor, but no other discernible spice and a lack of texture. You get two free sides, so I opted for the eggplant salad, which was inexplicably sweet and gooey in texture, like something I would imagine coming from a can with &#34;high fructose corn syrup&#34; on the label. The hummus and yogurt/dill salads were just ok, very generic and not particularly fresh tasting. Aside from that, I got a few small pieces of unseasoned cucumber and tomato and some tahini, none of which added much flavor to the bowl. Their hot sauce option is Sriracha, which although a great match for many East Asian foods, is not a great match for Middle Eastern (why not instead provide some harissa, or something akin to the chunky, pungent hot sauces found at falafel joints??)

Want much more authentic, satisfying Lebanese fast food? Get one of the delicious Lebanese flatbreads at Manousheh. Want healthy, fast casual Middle Eastern, but still care about flavor? Try Naya Express or Maoz."

I would say that I would eat it again, though probably won&#39;t go out of my way. I had the 1/2 romaine and 1/2 turmeric rice with the cauliflower and veggies. I have to say that I enjoyed my food, and that the hummus and cauliflower were the stars. The turmeric rice was surprisingly oily, and the marinated mushrooms had a spice I wasn&#39;t used to. These weren&#39;t bad, I just couldn&#39;t pinpoint what I was tasting lol. I have dietary restrictions and I appreciate that everything is gluten free minus the wraps. The staff were also relatively knowledgeable except...

any time I have ever dealt with tahini in a recipe, or bought it in the store, it is always, 100% ground sesame seeds, and a little oil. However, here, their &#34;tahini&#34; has yogurt mixed into it, so it isn&#39;t actually true tahini. (Unless lebanese tahini has dairy? I don&#39;t know about this.) Anyway,  the first time they made my food, I had mentioned that I don&#39;t eat dairy to one employee, but then I got a different employee further down. I at first chose the tahini and carrots and the tahini sauce at the end. Until I noticed that the sauce resembled tzatziki. I will get really sick if I eat dairy, like REALLY sick, they were kind enough to make me a new one, which I appreciate. Sorry, but I just really don&#39;t think you should call that stuff tahini if it has dairy in it, someone else who has an allergy, dietary restriction, or w/e could hear &#34;tahini&#34; and think &#34;non-dairy, I&#39;m safe,&#34; when surprise! My other criticism is that it is hard to hear the staff when you are ordering. I think the process would be helped if they had little placards showing A.) what the toppings were and B.) what the ingredients were. I know that not every business has to do it, but a lot do and in this day and age when everyone is allergic or watching something in their diet it is useful.

I got the cauliflower bowl over lettuce with eggplant and mushrooms.  Also got it topped with all the vegetables which included pickles, cucumber, tomatoes and mint.  Then I used Yelp for the hummus offer and got the sriracha hummus with multigrain pita chips.  It came up to under ten dollars which was not bad.  I think if I did not get the hummus I would have thought it was expensive.

Overall the food was good quality but it did not amaze me.  The cauliflower had a nice smoky flavor that paired well with the tangy sumac.  The eggplant did not do anything for me but it was not bad.  The mushrooms were nice.  I think the star of the day was the hummus.  It had a nice kick to it which is exactly what I was looking for.

The restaurant itself is nice to eat in.  They have water that you can drink with your meal.  Definitely nice to have when you get something spicy!  I would not make a trip out to Semsom from the city but if I was already there I might go back."

This genre of fast food seems to be plagued with endless similar tasting sides that are either soaking in buckets of luke warm water, luke warm vinegar, or luke warm oil.   As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised with Semsom&#39;s offerings.  I had the carrots, mushrooms, yogurt sauce, and hummus on rice (more on my main course in a moment).  It is surprisingly difficult to get high quality fresh hummus in NYC, and Semsom delivers.  The mushrooms were okay - nice and earthy, but overpowered by something.  Over seasoned maybe?  The yogurt sauce was light and aromatic, much higher quality than the &#34;white sauce&#34; you get from street carts.  The carrots were perfectly crisp with a really nice strong mint flavor that helped them stand out against the other flavors in the bowl.  The rice was very good - not overcooked.  There is always a hazard that a rice bowl - covered in wet sides and sauce - will become a slop pail, and Semsom&#39;s well cooked rice adequately prevented this.

Lacking from my rice and sides, however, was an adequate source of protein, and this is where Semsom loses two stars from my review: the veggie main dish options are just terrible.  As a vegetarian, I can&#39;t speak for the meat dishes (though I must confess some of them looked good!) but the meatless options were downright pathetic.  After sampling a grim puck of what looked and tasted like three month old falafel, but was described as &#34;pumpkin patty&#34;, I opted for the cauliflower.  The cauliflower is good, but not particularly special and certainly not a replacement (financially, nutritionally, or culinarily) for chicken or beef.  The only vegetarian protein available during my visit was the hummus, which was good, but as most vegetarians will tell you, trying to fill up on hummus will get you fat and sick of chick peas really really quickly if it&#39;s your only option.  Hummus is a side.  So is cauliflower.  Give me something with tofu, or even gluten meat.  

On a final positive note, Semsom has great service.  Everyone behind the counter was very helpful explaining the menu, and I was served and rung up quickly without feeling rushed."

Good friendly service, really great playlist with a ton of 90s and 00s throwback music to make me super nostalgic and happy (I walked in and they were playing The Format, and right now they&#39;re going back even farther and playing the original Dire Straits version of &#34;Romeo + Juliet&#34;, so that&#39;s pretty great!), free wifi, and comfortable seating.  Only complaint is I wish that they charged a little less for the cauliflower than for the meats since it&#39;s not as filling.  But what if you load it up with hummus it&#39;s pretty great.

I was surprised that the former Financier bakery has now turned into a hummus place since Financier was opened not too long ago. This is right next to the David Barton gym (great place to grab some healthy delicious food after a workout!). Anyway, Semsom is like the Mediterranean version of Roast. Although this place prides itself on hummus, there are plenty of other options if you just want more of the exotic Mediterranean food than hummus. For my first meal here, I opted for a bowl with Romaine, cauliflower, meatballs, eggplants (distinct but great taste), tomatoes, cabbage, and yogurt sauce. Let me tell you, this was delicious! The flavors just melt into your mouth. I wasn&#39;t able to finish this in one sitting so I had it for lunch the next day...it&#39;s still delicious as leftovers! Definitely come here and check this place out if you are in the area. They also have a lot of cool organic teas and spices (very Urban Outfitters like). I will be back."

He doesn&#39;t succeed. The movie celebrates the nobility of his effort with a wonderful final scene, where Fitzcarraldo stands on the deck of his now ruined boat, serenading the town with what will be just one shipboard performance. 

This elegant parable stuck with me long after the first I saw it at a Harvard Square movie house. I even journeyed to Iquitos and sailed down the Amazon myself, visiting places from the actual production of the movie. 

A couple times I&#39;ve asked the waiters and managers of Fitzcarraldo what this northern Italian restaurant has to do with a tale of ambition and failure in the jungle, but none seems to have much of an answer. Certainly this restaurant is no failure. It operated straight through the disaster at the co-working/studio space attached. The pastas, small plates and drinks are simply top notch.

I&#39;ve come for drinks, I&#39;ve come for a snack, I&#39;ve come for full meals and always been satisfied. I suspect the out of the way location - it&#39;s hidden between a couple of warehouses are the only reason this isn&#39;t more known. 

I&#39;m fine with walking a little bit for this cuisine. It certainly beats dragging a boat over a mountain, a reference, of course Mr. Herzog&#39;s wonderful movie."

Unfortunately for us I chose to come here instead. Hours of closing time stated 12am so I thought by arriving at 1030pm we would have plenty of time. We dined in an empty room and were greeted by an unenthused man who wasn&#39;t very attentive. From working in the hospitality industry, not the best signs already.

We ordered, cod for me and chicken for him. Fish was fine. Fianc√© cut a piece of chicken and fed me. As I chewed I realized it wasn&#39;t cooked well. I had undercooked chicken in my mouth. We examined the chicken by candlelight and sure enough there was blood by the bone. Our server didn&#39;t bother to ask how everything was so we had to call for him to take the chicken away. When he returned, he informed us that the chicken would be taken off the bill but the chef would not fire up a new one because the kitchen was closing. 

It was 1130pm at this point. If you close at midnight and there is 30 mins left Til closing and you serve undercooked chicken to a guest endangering them with food poison, and all you can offer is to take it off the check...

The pistachio dusting also seemed unnecessary (and I later turned down dessert when 1 of the 2 options also had pistachios in it). I would have preferred a more classic scallop dish, but it&#39;s good to try new things. The other dish we ordered was monkfish that came in a stew dominated by fennel and red peppers.

The place is carefully decorated with sustainable, but gorgeous pieces all over, which I personally appreciate. 
We started out with the antipasti, which included 2 cheeses, 2 meats, honey, tiny olives and of course, bread. Really good. Don&#39;t really remember the name of ANYTHING we had, but I&#39;ll use my great descriptive skills to guide anyone who needs guidance. I ordered an apple jack drink with aperol, it was yummy. For the entrees, I ordered the hanger steak which came with a really good and creamy polenta and shreds of mushroom. (I think there was also some truffle oil on it.) My boyfriend ordered the branzino with clams, and that was also pretty good. The skin of the branzino was nice and crispy even with the broth underneath it. Portions weren&#39;t huge, they were actually a great size. Perfect enough to leave you full, but not dying of fullness (you know what I mean.) And yes, after all the goodness we decided to be crazy and get dessert. We ordered the caramelized white pudding and it was the bomb.com. It came with salted walnuts on top and tasted like arequipe, a Colombian soft caramel. Our server was very pleasant and we enjoyed our experience.

We started with the rosemary sea salt Farinata. I had no idea what a Fairnata was but its now a favorite thing to eat. Served in a skillet hot, tasty, fresh. Seriously, it was delicious.

They have beautiful giant windows at the front, looks like the space was maybe an old factory once.

Getting in is a bit odd, there&#39;s no door off the street to the restaurant, you have to go into this weird apparently semi-vacant building and go through unmarked doors to the right. It&#39;s hard to tell if you&#39;re using the right door, and if it weren&#39;t for the massive picture windows out front you wouldn&#39;t know it was there.

In any event, it&#39;s a great intimate space. We only had cocktails, which are average Manhattan prices, about $12- $15/each, but expertly crafted. They have a nice by the glass wine selection, not too large, but given the menu it seems pretty good for their food options. The bartenders are friendly without being overbearing which is a great thing to have.

Overall, we really liked the space. Not sure we&#39;d make the trek all the way out there again from Queens, but if we lived closer I&#39;m sure we&#39;d visit more often. It&#39;s a nice out of the way spot that has a great intimate, quiet vibe. Not always easy to find in NY."

I won&#39;t do that though for fear that you might miss out on the other dishes which I&#39;m sure are just as delicious.
The courtyard was beautiful, quiet and comfortable.
The service was as good as it could get.
And the prices were phenomenal (especially when you consider the quality of the meal).
I am left looking for reasons to go back and looking for friends to share this gem with!"

His dinner tasting menu last week was phenomenal. I can honestly say it was the first tasting menu that made me feel like I was on an exciting journey--each course so different from the next, incorporating ingredients like thistles that made me taste scallops in a whole way. Even dessert which I can usually do without could not be missed. 

The menu apparently changes every night so I&#39;ll be back again and again."

The space is small and quaint and has the typical dark wood low-light, Brooklyn feel. There is a small bar and probably around 15 to 20 seats in the restaurant. The menu is even smaller, but if you go just plan on getting the awesome pre-fixe. 

The staff were especially accommodating and one in particular, named Carissa, made sure we were taken care of the whole time. 

 First we tried some kind of amazing anchovy cheese bread. I&#39;m normally not anchovy person at all but this was really tasty. Then we had a ridiculously awesome risotto with a chickpea cheese pizza bread type thing. The description does not do it justice, you just need to try it. 

In my two friends&#39; minds, the star of the night was the raw scallop with smoked peppers, olive oil and lemon. 

Next we had a braised rabbit pasta dish which was creamy and delicious. That was followed by a seafood pasta dish that was delish as well. 

We ended the night with a chocolate mousse and something called Foccatta. I&#39;m not sure what it was but I&#39;d go back just for this desert. 

Even though there&#39;s not a lot close by this place, it definitely deserves a shot by any discerning foodie."

For my entree, I had the Trofie which was amazingly fresh. The pesto and pinenuts on it were delectable. 

The atmosphere was very nice, although a little hot and the service was a smidge slower than expected.

fitzcarraldo-brooklyn,Tom K.,Kchj2U3yTo1hOZoiOkcErA,"Forest Hills, NY",1,1,1,304,16,qBV8JBTiz0g1vOV7XWsibQ,5.0,2014-02-09,"I have to confess that I was partially drawn to &#34;Fitzcarraldo&#34; as a fan of German film giant Werner Herzog and his 1982 production of the same name. And perhaps like the eponymous film, Fitzcarraldo the restaurant represents a powerful vision of defiance, to set up shop where warehouses and factories are abundant and still functional, pioneers in a land ripe for development. Settling and thriving in his section of industrial Williamsburg may be as bold an idea as moving a steamboat over a hill in pursuit of rubber.

The search for Fitzcarraldo had us exploring the concrete jungle turned frozen tundra thanks to the well packed and unshoveled snow of the nearby sidewalks. Having parked a block away, we made it to Morgan and saw no sign of this establishment until I spotted a spray-painted sign with an arrow. (In retrospect, if you are approaching from south of 195 Morgan you&#39;ll see a much better and clearer sign)

But where would this arrow lead? Through an alleyway to the back of a building with two doors, one that read 3rd Ward, site of the former arts center. You&#39;ll want to choose the door on the left, past the curtains and greeted by high windows and an elevated view of the avenue. (The same height as a steamboat?)

Enter Fitzcarraldo, a space that immediately welcomes, rich in wood, open and airy, with plants nestled atop the windows defying the harshness of winter.

There are five choices for brunch, including yogurt, savory chickpea pancake, soft scrambled eggs, french toast and a country breakfast. Prices range from $6 to $11.

The country breakfast was the kind of dish that has me trying my best to eliminate every last morsel on the plate. Two fried eggs, once punctured, sensually oozed out onto the plate, meeting up with the spicy potatoes and reaching the barrier of thick country bread. All three elements joined together, my fork breaking off a piece of spicy potato to dip into the runny yolk, with a morsel of bread serving as a base. Did I mention that resting atop the bread was salumi, several slices of salami vastly superior to the typical sausage link or bacon?

Here was a breakfast plate that tasted homemade, made with love and artfully crafted for friends and family. Modest in size yet bold in flavor, this country breakfast should issue passports so full citizenship is within reach.

My wife&#39;s french toast was equally delicious as I stole a few bites. Once again, the use of a sturdy, hearty bread makes all the difference. 

For about $12 per person, inclusive of warm beverage, we had a brunch that exceeded in all categories and only reinforced my opinion that other establishments are tired, pedestrian and flatly too expensive for average quality eats. Fitzcarraldo is a triumph, one that I hope people discover and visit as often as possible.

Now if only they played some Caruso..."

We had brunch there last Sunday and recently followed it up with dinner and there staff couldn&#39;t have been sweeter.

No wait whatsoever at around 8:30 on a Friday night which was a pleasant surprise. 
Restaurant is small but not tiny, the decoration is lovely and the atmosphere was great, loved the open kitchen.
Now onto the food. We started with the anchovie crostini, it was a bit small but it was really good, worth trying. i had the pesto trufie and it was good as well, nothing super amazing, but a very solid pasta dish cooked perfectly and beautifully seasoned. I tried my boyfriend&#39;s steak and it was really good, he really seemed to enjoy his dish so I would recommend this as well. 
My only overall complaint would be that their wine glass portions are TINY, I&#39;ve honestly never had so little wine when ordering a wine by the glass.

Their restaurant is a hidden little gem, so you have to go through a side corridor - don&#39;t be alarmed. They have hanging plants and repurposed wood and a beautiful open bar and kitchen... and they only have 5 things on their brunch menu. As a self proclaimed anti-foodie (or whatever, I eat, apparently I&#39;m just not as good at it as other people...) that means that those 5 things are gonna be super dank. And they were. I had the chickpea pancake with roasted tomatoes and pesto... YUM. Friends got the fluffy scramble with mushrooms and fresh ass bread. All was delicious. Oh wait. They do unlimited mimosas.

And actually quite important things: the chef is doing a really good job at cooking. Foodwise, all things were globally very good, subtle, delicate. We had the prix fix. We had burata, raw scallops, tuna, sea bass and a rice desert. The wine was also really interesting. Kudos for that.

Now the things why only 3 stars:

1st of, there is something about italian food that is very important when you want to do it right: it has to be fulfilling your stomach. I can say that as a good half of my family was raised there. And I don&#39;t mean it has to be to the extreme of loving grand mothers who are literally killing you with food OD. But it is clear that italian food, to be right, needs to at the very least give you this feeling that you don&#39;t need anything else in your stomach... and truth to be said, we went for a last byte somewhere else after Fitzcaraldo. Please add more side pasta or rizotto, or just go a bit crazy with Focacia, or may be bring some Cantuci...

2nd thing is, and this is very personal, about the soundtrack. In case you are allergic to post 70s reggae inspired music, you might want to be careful. We had 2 hours of a soundtrack that was really not our taste... and it did not help to make us happy (though it did make us laugh at some points... and god knows that we love many things, but focusing on this 90s reggae was not to please us...). If you don&#39;t want to piss some customers, either introduce more diversity or chose for things which are more likely to please a broad spectrum of customers.

3rd thing and this is not at all to blame any one during the service. The outdoor which is actually looking and feeling great at first is also apparently the basecamp of a very tenacious mosquito tribe. My unkles and caff muscles will remember this for a few weeks... no idea if it is because of the proximity of the Newton creek water but this was tough. Honestly not helping to be totally happy about the experience.

I surely will go back, may be in the inside, and not taking the prix fixe..."

You won&#39;t have to worry about a wait on a Saturday night (at least for a while) and the service is thoughtful and gracious.

I love the way the cocktail menu is organized by type (sour, bubbly, etc) and the Greenpoint was a nice complement to the apps. I do think it would be fair to disclose on the chalkboard menu that the beers on draft aren&#39;t full pints.

We ordered from the a la carte menu, and had the farinata and pecorino romano to start. So much cheese value! Normally you get the tiniest of slabs but theirs was abundant. The farinata was great but perhaps it was unwise pairing it with the salty cheese since it was topped by anchovies. 

My boyfriend was &#34;lulled into a butter coma&#34; with the cheese orchiette, also made with the best cooked pasta we&#39;ve had in a while. I got the peekytoe crab salad with egg... it was immaculate, but I wish the menu had been a bit broader since crab isn&#39;t really my jam (please add one more entree under $20)!.

The space has gorgeous tiled floors and a unique take on the exposed wood motif. Really, my only complaint is the limited menu, which can pose problems to near vegetarians like us. I&#39;m sure it changes often since it is so small and seasonal, so I&#39;ll just wait another month before our next try...or maybe we&#39;ll do brunch."

The latest hot area comprises  comprises Bushwick and the highly industrialized area around Morgan Avenue. We were invited to an art opening in that area. The artist recommended this restaurant very close by to the gallery. At one time I represented most of these businesses around Morgan Avenue and was I surprised to find that now there are a number of art galleries, studios, restaurants, and young people moving there. Now onto this restaurant. It is hidden away on Morgan Avenue. The atmosphere  is fine and what one would expect. I asked the manager where does he get his customers and he told me people come from Manhattan and surrounding areas.
Well - you have to be crazy to come here from Manhattan and if I was from the surrounding areas I&#39;d find another restaurant.
It has an extremely limited menu. My starter - Salumi  was good. The faro and  bibb  salads-  bad/Trofie  with pesto sauce was to Ala Dente  and the sauce was strange and too sweet. Seared scallops- overdone(I  Specifically asked them not to be overcome) and the accompanied lentils, cauliflower and pickled raisins were very strange. The Orechiette   were just okay. We did not stay for the  desert and were happy to leave.
Alas - all was not lost on the way home I stopped at Katz&#39;s delicatessen on Houston Street for a fabulous hot dog."

Although the restaurant is a well kept secret - it deserves to become a neighborhood staple as well as a destination restaurant.

The menu appears limited - but don&#39;t let that fool you.  I am a vegetarian and the chef is so talented and flexible, I have seriously had two of the best meals ever at Fitzcarraldo.  After eating there twice - once with a large group for the tasting menu and the second time with a smaller group for their a la carte dinner- it is no exaggeration to say that the family style tasting menu was amazing and for the price - a steal.  Both the tasting menu and a la carte dinners were individualized to accommodate all dietary requests.

The service is attentive and wonderful.  Other reviews cover all of the amazing aspects of this restaurant so no need for redundancy.  I really can&#39;t say enough about Fitzcarraldo.  Just thinking about the food is inspiring another visit."

The pesto was fresh and the pecorino was excellent quality. For my entree, I had the roasted lamb with farik (greenwheat freekeh), yogurt sauce, and radishes. My farik had just the right bite to it and was pleasantly nutty tasting. It was a great accompaniment to the beautifully seasoned and tender lamb. A yogurt sauce and some parsley added brightness to what could&#39;ve been a heavy meal. My boyfriend had the bar steak with parsnips, pickled onions, and salsa verde. His steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. He ate all the vegetables before I could try them, so I am pretty sure they were excellent. The food is soulful and comforting; I felt like I was in someone&#39;s home. The decor was charming, and I love the wood barrel ceiling. The music was great too.

A little off the beaten path but easily found inside 3rd Ward. This place is very newly opened and the usual kinks need to be ironed out but I can&#39;t wait to return."

Besides obvious Herzogian bonus points, the space is rather lovely (although the view is more or less industrial wasteland). Attentive server, the slow scrambled eggs and spicy potatoes were delicious. Red Snapper was perfectly spiced, and the taste of a friend&#39;s polenta with ricotta, leeks and a poached egg was divine. Curiously, our table of 5 were the only patrons.

UP.

Oysters of the day were Beausoleil&#39;s which I love, enough to eat a dozen of them by myself (before eating a fried chicken dinner). And yes, you want to go for the fried chicken dinner because it comes with deliciously creamy mac and cheese and some slaw.

Not going to lie. I was pretty drunk when we came here (Yelp event afterparty, duh). But I remember having a good sour beer. Twice.

The service is pretty standard for Williamsburg.  Not overly friendly, but also not bad.  They have a nice cocktail menu as well as a decent selection of wine and beer.

Their liquor list is a binder that is organized based on the spirit you prefer. I applaud you OTB for little details such as that. Now I came here during happy hour and ordered their wings and a beer. Wings are 1/2 off and draft beers are a 1$ off which is a great steal.

You can order your wings in a multitude of ways. Either grilled or fried preparation and either spicy or plain flavor. I opted for the classic spicy fried wings. The wings were indeed spicy but had a good flavor. My problem was they had way too much breading and sauce for my liking. Literally dripping sauce as I ate my wing. I think next time I come here I would ask for the grilled ones spicy with the sauce on the side. But they were good none the less.

This is a very date-like place. I don&#39;t think I would ever go back here alone. I would love to check it out on a Monday when they do movie night. Definitely will come back to OTB."

When you walk in you are hit with a beautiful bar and general decor. It all works together and makes for a warm, inviting place to sit and have a drink. 

The menu is huge with a gargantuan list of whiskeys and other spirits. The first thing I noticed is that some of the prices were completely out of whack. Everything was super overpriced. I settled on a perfect Manhattan for $11 - It was very good.

For dinner I was told the OTB burger and fries is a must have. I ordered it medium rare. It came back a little undercooked for ground beef (really rare) but it was well seasoned and very tasty. The toppings were not listed but it was some sort of mild cheese and what seemed like a spicy relish. The fries were above average. The GF got a French onion soup that was above average as well. We were still hungry to we finished it off with a apple compote - it was ok. 

So - why 3 stars? The prices. The service was great, the food was above average and the cocktails were on point. But $18 for a burger and fries? Get outta here. It wasn&#39;t that large and frankly, was just an above average burger that was slightly undercooked. French onion soup was $12. 3 drinks 3 food items tax and tip came out to be almost $90. That&#39;s crazy pants for upscale bar food.

I looked at it and asked &#34;is that soy sauce? I could get very sick. I can&#39;t have gluten.&#34; She checked and said yes and took it away.

I&#39;m giving them 4 stars for the drinks and for the overall ambience and for the decent food, but if for some inexplicable reason if someone told me that I was not allowed to ever return here again...I would be A-OK with that.

OTB is a kinda-sorta-but-not-really fancypants cocktail bar &amp; restaurant with a slightly pretentious, Williamsburg feel. I feel like they try to be fancier than they actually are, but whatever - dim lighting, candles on the tables - lots of dark wood furniture - yeah, we get it, you&#39;re OH SO POSH. SO POSH.

The cocktail list here is pretty darn fantastic. I will give them that. Was going to stick with a classic Old Fashioned (made here with demeara sugar, old overholt rye whiskey, angostura bitters, stirred, on the rocks), but decided to go rogue and order a drink called a &#34;Staycation&#34; which was Del Maguey Mezcal, Old Overholt Rye, Fresh Orange Juice, Rasberry Syrup, Angostura and Bittermans Tiki Bitters. 

I didn&#39;t even know what two of those ingredients were, but decided that after tons of Moscow Mules earlier I wanted something decidedly sweeter as my nightcap and sweet it was...without being disgustingly so...but definitely interesting. I do appreciate that it didn&#39;t taste syrupy and think that using Rasberry Puree would have given this drink a nicer texture - I did like that it was garnished with fresh mint because that always smells nice and adds an air of aromatic pleasantness and automatically makes anything refreshing so that was a nice addition.

The other two gals I was with also got cocktails. One ordered a Hemingway Daiquiri (goslings rum, fresh lime juice, fresh grapefruit juice, luxardo maraschino, shaken, served up) and if I remember correctly, described it as &#34;this tastes like sex in a glass!&#34; and my other friend ordered a Oaxacan Wino (Del Maguey Mezcal, Red Wine Reduction, Antica, Carpano Vermouth) which was also interesting and I wasn&#39;t crazy about it upon sampling it, but I think she liked it.

Being hungry, but not *too* hungry we also ordered a cheese burger with fries to share amongst the 3 of us. We ordered it well-done (since 1 out of the three of us doesn&#39;t like any sort of rare-ness to her burger) and it was surprisingly juicy. 

I&#39;m more of a medium-rare kinda gal, yet the meat wasn&#39;t dry or burnt so I was pleased with the small piece of burger I got to consume. The fries were ok. Not the best, not the worst. Overly seasoned and my bestie commented on finding them salty and that was definitely true. 

They&#39;re a little thicker than shoestring fries and they left the potato skin on them which in my book is a plus, but if they can learn to lay a little off the seasoning and salt then they would be significantly better. Here&#39;s a good motto I just created: &#34;Be heavy handed with booze, not salt&#34;. Yeah, I&#39;m a marketing genius.

Service here wasn&#39;t all sunshine and lollipops, our waiter was slow in asking us for drink orders, slow in bringing us our check...no refills on water...dunno man, I know it was late, but that&#39;s not how to build a fanbase or repeat patrons. There goes my marketing prowess again, heh.

We came here upon a suggestion of some fellow Yelp-Eliters as a great place for a night cap post yelp-eliting. Oh god. That sounded so corny. Bear with me. 

I apparently had a Hemingway Daiquiri that my friend noted I loudly exclaimed that &#34;this tastes like sex in a cup&#34;. I honestly don&#39;t remember at all how it tasted. But I like and have had Hemingways before so I imagine it was quite tasty as they should be. It was made with Goslins Rum (There was an obligatory Ryan Gosling joke thrown in here somewhere), fresh lime juice, grapefruit juice, and luxardo maraschino. We also split three-ways a cheeseburger. Which was as complicated as it sounds. I don&#39;t remember how it tasted. I do remember there being French fries. Those are tasty.

I like fancy cocktails. I kind of hate Williamsburg. So I&#39;m very on the fence with how to rate this place. The yelpers seemed very enthusiastic about it. My friends seemed indifferent.  I seemed indifferent and that&#39;s why I&#39;m going with 3 gold stars! I probably wouldn&#39;t go back just out of mere sake of not knowing how to get home when I walked out of the bar."

I came up from Philly to visit the BF, and I had randomly chosen to go to OTB from what I saw/read on Yelp. I was definitely not disappointed!! I got a burger and he got the steak frites. His steak was cooked perfectly and my burger was juicy and had great flavor. We also split some oysters which tasted really fresh! We asked our waitress if she could bring us 2 shots of vodka (with a little room at the top) to go with our oysters, so that we could make oyster shooters (i know i know, but trust me, they are amazing!) and I definitely appreciated that the waitress did NOT look at us like we had 3 heads! They had an extensive booze list, especially for whiskey lovers. My favorite part was that they kept playing hits from the 90&#39;s, yesss! Oh, and they were also playing a silent film in B&amp;W above the door on a projector, which was also really cool. I&#39;m a new fan, and I will definitely be back! Nice job, Brooklyn!"

One of the best Caesar salads prepped in a restaurant. It&#39;s HUGE and really, really tasty. 

The grilled wings were delicious and served with sliced fennel (instead of celery). Great change up that worked really well. Wings had a ton of flavor. 

Salmon ceviche came with a smoked jalapeno mayo. Very surprising and enjoyable. Fried pickles were also very good, very lightly breaded and thinly sliced. Served with ranch and BBQ sauce. 

The server and bartender were very friendly and accommodating. Prices are reasonable for the area and are a great value considering portion size and quality of food. 

Good fresh selection of oysters ... and they were playing Contact on the movie screen. Very nice touch. 

We will definitely be coming back here a lot... especially for the Caesar."

We dream about places like this.

Laid back vibe. Unpretentious. Hip decor. Inviting booths. Helpful and friendly waitstaff. I couldn&#39;t stop admiring how well thought out and uniquely decorated the bathroom was. 

We had the carrots with fried capers and the special vegetable (asparagus with fried egg on top and sauce made of heaven).

My wife and I don&#39;t, but we were invited here by friends so we went with the flow. Their cocktail list is decidedly better than their beer or wine list, with very esoteric selections compared to the vary pedestrian beer list. The food we ordered was fine, just some fries and other small plates. Service was excellent for Wburg- no pretentious waitstaff here, very down to earth helpful people.

Came here to close out the night and grab a few drinks. This place is the sister bar to one of my favorite in Williamsburg, The Post Office. Sat down and of course, I must try their Old Fashioned first. It was good, not one of the best but still good, however strong as fuck! I ordered a beer next but everything started to get fuzzy after that Old Fashioned. The burger was amazing and it wasn&#39;t just because I was drunk. I did not like their cheese fries that much but that cheeseburger was no joke. As I stated, I apparently had sex with this thing and people were starring. People got hot and bothered.  

Apparently several more funny things happened before we left though I don&#39;t recall them, which is unfortunate seeing how they all involved me. Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t recall them why they are so funny."

You can get them any way you like: grilled, fried, saucey...not saucy. I went the healthier route and got grilled + no sauce, and they were delicious. OPTIONS! The best part of the wings though were the often forgotten side kick, the fennel...YES FENNEL. Very refreshing alternative to celery, my journey to find the best wings may have just gotten shorter. 

While Im not a big drinker, I will always try one cocktail before I move onto beer. It is obvious that a lot of thought has been put into each and every drink, from the tradition manhattan to my favorite the Mary Fizz -  Hacienda Reposado Tequila, fresh lime juice, honey and sparkling wine. This will be a great drink for the summer with the weather finally clearing up.

The same dudes behind the Post Office whiskey bar have opened this glorious space whose name stands for &#39;Off Track Betting&#39;, hence all the horse themed novelties, and a very impressive cocktail and spirit list. Their cocktails are separated into 2 categories: Classic and Modern. Be sure to try the &#39;Bees-Knees&#39; off the Classic List. It&#39;s made with Dorothy Parker Gin, fresh lemon juice and honey. Another standout: the &#39;Ruby Rum&#39; off their Modern list, made with El Dorado Rum, fresh grapefruit juice, aperol and homemade mint syrup, shaken and served over crushed ice. They also make a solid Old Fashioned and Margarita. All cocktails are well-priced too, for just 10 bucks.

Kyle wasn&#39;t in an oyster mood, so I got oysters for 1. They were tiny but mighty and oh so delicious, and I WILL be back on a Monday for their $1 oysters served all night. Their wings are by far and away the best I have ever had. You can get them grilled or fried (fried, duh) and the spicy sauce will change your life.

Next time: I would skip the French Onion Soup and Mussels (both were decent, but the soup a tad too sweet, and the mussels were tiny and I didn&#39;t care for their Thai Basil broth, which I&#39;m usually a fan of). Their burger, however, was amazing. And did I mention the wings?

The service was friendly and attentive, and I appreciated how every dish we ordered from appetizers to mains was perfectly staggered and not rushed. OTB is the kind of place I want to keep a secret, but you South-siders will discover it soon enough. Cheers!

The only thing I don&#39;t like about this place is that they serve their wings in 5s, making it quite hard for 2 people sharing. You can&#39;t serve wings in odd numbers (especially when they are as bangin&#39; as they are here)!!"

This spacious eatery has a limited but very tasty menu, and a wonderful cocktail list. We went on a Thursday evening and were seated in a cozy booth after a 10 minute wait. The ambience was relaxed and our server was friendly. Drinks and food were slow to come out initially, but were then served at a good pace. Here&#39;s the breakdown:

Try:
Cheeseburger - with foie gras, of course! Who knew they would complement so well - mindblowing good!
Snap peas with house-made sausage, if it&#39;s on the specials menu - topped with horseradish cream. Great texture, flavor, YUM!
Oysters were really quite heavenly, I was very impressed - we had some from Rhode Island
Escargot! Very well done. And we&#39;re not usually big bread eaters, yet we sopped up every last bit of that buttery goodness.
Cocktail:  Oaxacan Wino - Mezcal, red wine reduction, sweet vermouth - If that sounds good to you, then you will love it.

Maybe pass:
Grilled asparagus had good intentions but didn&#39;t end up being that great. It needed more balsamic flavor.
Cocktail: Queens Parks Swizzle - it&#39;s a beautiful drink, but it ended up tasting very simple and mostly boring."

(I lament not being able to remember her name). She was a hilarious spit-fire of a dame, and she took great care of us. If you happen to not have our same girl serve you, the atmosphere, food, and drink can still pull their weight.

We came over to grab a pre-pizza drink since Motorino, next door, doesn&#39;t have a liquor license yet. (It&#39;s a crime, I know) Wednesday night around 9 the place wasn&#39;t packed, but it had enough people to create a healthy atmosphere. There&#39;s an extensive selection of spirits and a solid list of cocktails to choose from.

We couldn&#39;t resist the home-made chicken nuggets. &#34;All white meat, crisped to perfection, with a spicy bourbon BBQ sauce.&#34; Our waitress lights up while describing it. Her dedication to it, mentioning she&#39;d put it on ice cream if given a chance, convinced us to try it. They were beyond perfect. The chicken was light and moist, perfectly steamy inside it&#39;s crispy packet of fried breading. And don&#39;t get me started on the sauce, I wanted to smother myself in it.

All in all, great place. Drinks were lovely (I huffed down a margarita in record time), I would marry the waitress, and the small amount of food we tasted should win an award."

And while you may think a caeser is a caeser, this one is exceptional.  I couldn&#39;t believe how excited I was for this salad.  Also tried my friends grilled spicy wings.

the second time i went back was a saturday night and when we didn&#39;t order another round quickly enough, the waitress kicked us out. she said they needed to &#34;clear the space&#34; for more customers. i get it, it&#39;s saturday night, but that&#39;s still kinda bitchy. we then stood outside for about 10 minutes talking before we left-- during which time not a single person entered the bar or sat in the table we&#39;d been kicked out of.

the food is meh. the escargot was fishy and dare i say, grainy. i will definitely try a few more things on the menu, but i was just not impressed

the cocktails are actually pretty great, but i&#39;m not sure they&#39;re good enough to make up for the shitty service or mediocre food. i&#39;ll probably try it one more time before i write it off completely."

The restaurant is quite small with bar seats and a long communal table. The interior is dim and the walls are covered with shelves of wine. The restaurant could feel cramped when it&#39;s full, so I would recommend going with a small party.

I am a fan of small plates because that means I get to try more items on the menu. They gave us complimentary bread and it was really nice, we asked for more. The menu features a good selection of pasta and appetizers. In the end we decided on six items:

Gamberoni e Carciofi - a nice appetizer to share. The shrimp scampi was fresh and you can taste the herbs and garlic in the sauce. The sauce was really tasty. I didn&#39;t want to waste it so I used it as a dip for my bread!

Sardine in &#34;Saor&#34; - The sardine is filled with onions, pine nuts and raisins. It was nice but the sardine itself was too mushy. It also came with a side of polenta, which was light and balance the taste of the sardines.

Tortino Granchio e Funghi - the crab cakes were nice and light. Not too heavy like others I&#39;ve tasted but it was a bit dry. The mushrooms were really nice as well but together they seemed like a weird pair. 

Lasagne Bolognese - very nicely done for a classic Italian pasta. The lasagne was served with traditional bolognese sauce. It was very meaty. I really like cheese so I wish it was more cheesy.

Gnocchi Sorrentina - this gnocchi was served with mozzarella cubes. Really nice, not as heavy as I thought it would be.

Lobster Risotto (special) - probably the least impressive of all the small plates we tried. The flavor was a bit one dimensional as the sauce was too tomatoey. The serving of lobster was also very tiny, so the sauce overpowered the taste of the lobster. 

I would recommend coming here if you&#39;re with a few close friends who like to share."

Food:
The must try and signature entree is octopus salad! The octopus are slightly grilled and the edge of each piece turning brown and crispy..but they&#39;re sooo smooth and fresh in the middle I just can&#39;t stop eating them. With mild seasoning of balsamic vinegar, the veggies and octopus could full release the flavor.
Ask them if they have daily special and try truffle risotto!!(also saw reviews about truffle gnocchi also wanna try next time!) the mushroom and truffle slices are so rich in flavor they literally bomb in your mouth...the only con is the portion are always not enough. But since the overall price are around $12-14 per dish so I&#39;m totally fine with it. Got the chance to try more dishes isn&#39;t it? lol
Lamb chops are also perfectly cooked in medium(might try to ask for medium rare next time), with balsamic drizzle. The pinkish color in the middle of the meat when you cut your lamb chop really makes you drool...and 2 chops plus 2 halves of potato costs only $9.
As for other appetizers, try the sliced pork on bread(forgot the Italian name...), garlic shrimp and prosciutto wrapped mozzarella!
Gnocchi sorrentina wiz fresh cut mozzarella are also good for vegetarian.

As for dessert, creme br√ªl√©e was quite basic, and you&#39;ll never go wrong with tiramisu..the mascarpone they use are really rich and smooth.

--
Service: I always tip around 20% so I didn&#39;t encounter any tipping problems that other reviewers experienced, but if this really is a problem, then I would be super disappointed...but as for the three times I&#39;ve had dinner there, hostess is quite friendly tho.

The Briciola only has communal table but the restaurant with similar deco across the street has the same menu and taste just like the same, but they have wine bar and tables. (I heard the one across the street used to be a French one but the owner married the owner of Briciola so they became into one haha, fun fact!)
In general these two places are good for group less than 5. 
Btw, they don&#39;t take reservation so might wait outside for like 10-20mins to sit."

- The wine selection is good at all price points
- The desserts are decent, again nothing extraordinary
- The communal table vibe lends well to making some new friends over wine and I love it
- The ambience is really cute, warm and inviting
- The lines have been getting longer by the day and I am not a big fan of that. If starting my evening around 5.30pm, I&#39;d come here. Otherwise go to someplace that takes a reservation.
- The horror stories about tipping are true. We lived one block down and frequented this place every few weeks. We learned from harsh experience that anything but 20% sets you up for public shaming at this restaurant even if you are a regular who always leaves a generous tip!

So itching to give 3.5 stars overall but yelp wouldn&#39;t allow me."

Appetizers are $10 and pastas are $12 listed on the menu. I had the Papardelle Cinghiale and it was amazing. I highly recommend - you can really taste the freshness of the ingredients and noodles. The beef was tender and the pasta was so flavorful. Portions were not too filling, so I recommend also getting appetizers to share. We went for the burata (special of the day for $16) for the appetizer and it was delicious. It&#39;s small tapa style plates so you can try various dishes at reasonable prices.  

The only downside was that the hostess was not friendly. There was absolutely no place to stand when we were waiting to get seated because the restaurant is tiny, but the hostess rudely told us to get out of the way. Did not feel like it was a friendly environment but the homemade pasta made up for it."

I love Italian Food and was initially a bit disappointed that the only entree options were pasta since I try to avoid eating it for diet reasons. In the case of Briciola, ignoring my diet was 1000% worth it.

We got here at about 6:15pm and the place was already really crowded. We were lucky and got sat at the bar but the parties behind us had to wait. We each ordered a glass of the Pinot Nero (which is Pinot Noir, they just try to be Italian about it) and set to the task of picking out what to get from the menu. We ordered:

-Pappardelle Ossobuco-This was mine and it was DIVINE. The meat was cooked really well and it was a real comfort meal. I would kill to eat this dish again.

-Tagliatelle Bolognese-This was my friend&#39;s and it was equally delicious.

The bread they also serve with their meals is definitely above average and perfect to dip sauce in.

Do note that the portions are SMALL. You *REALLY* should order an appetizer either for yourself or to split along with the Pasta. I was pretty hungry within an hour of eating which does not usually happen to me. I should have known better since the pastas were $12, but hey, a girl can dream of cheap, high quality and large portions of food, right?

If I were ever in the area, I would love to go back. The dishes were comforting and well made and the wine was great. The service was quick and the setting was beautiful. Definitely a gem."

we came here on a Wimb as most things were closed when we were ready to eat. The first impression of this place is that the entire restaurant is a hallway lol. Aside from that gold moly food was amazing. Setting was very cozy and romantic and I was amazed they could make such gourmet plates in such a tiny kitchen. These are small plates (think large tapas) my husband and I ordered 3 but would&#39;ve been perfect had we ordered 4 or 5 (by the time we realized we wanted more kitchen was closed) We had the skirt steak special ($21) cooked to perfection. The lobster ravioli ($14) and the prosciutto tortellini ($14) service was OK not the best. Bathroom is smaller than an airplane bathroom but has its charm!

I discovered it from the recommendation of a coworker, and I&#39;ve been many times since. Unfortunately, they don&#39;t take reservations and because it&#39;s such a tiny restaurant with one long communal table and very limited bar seating, expect a long wait to be seated. I&#39;ve been for dinner several times and it was about a 30 minute wait. More recently, I came for a lunch on a Sunday at around 3pm, and there was no wait at all. Below are the dishes I always get and highly recommend:

1.  $1 oysters during happy hour. It&#39;s all day until they run out on the weekends and during happy hour on weeknights.

2.  Grilled Octopus Salad. This is seriously amazing and I can&#39;t get enough! The octopus is so tender and flavored so well with balsamic vinegar, pesto, and olive oil and potatoes.

3. Truffle Gnocchi Special. Not sure that they always have this, but every time I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve gotten this. It&#39;s a little pricey at $23, but I mean truffles and gnocchi together makes it soo worth it.

If you&#39;re with one other person, this should be plenty of food and you will leave so satisfied! Don&#39;t forget to wash it all down with a bottle of white wine!

Wish I could give this place 5 stars, but with the inability to make reservations and the super cramped seating, I think 4 stars is best."

Although seating might not be suitable for large groups, as most guests were seated at the bar or the commuter table, Briciola is a great spot to bring a date or a few friends. We had the special octopus salad ($15), which included delicious grilled octopus, capers, tomatoes and slice potatoes. This also came with some fresh toasted bread. We also ordered some blue point oysters as appetizer, which were just $1 each (all day, I believe). 

The food came out pretty quickly and it was always hot and fresh. I was pleased with the texture of the pasta, as well as the portion. For $12, you can pick any pasta from their extensive list, which included options with meat to mushrooms to seafood. The pastas were definitely some of the better ones I&#39;ve had in the city.

Overall, we were really pleased with our experience at Briciola and would definitely recommend others to try it if they are in the area. I will definitely be back to try their other appetizers, crostini and pastas!"

However, the seating arrangement is awkward and uncomfortable since everyone is basically sharing one communal table. The hostess is also unfriendly and very strict with the seating. I knew about the seating arrangements before I arrived but I didn&#39;t realize the extent of how tight the space was. I was literally touching elbows with the people next to me.  

Appetizers
The waiter verbally recited the specials for the day to me, which were both items that I already planned to order:
1) Octopus Salad ($15)- Delicious!!!!!! You NEED to order this! The flavors of the balsamic and pesto blends perfectly together. They give generous portions of the grilled octopus unlike other restaurants I&#39;ve been to. There were bigger chunks of grilled octopus in the dish than the amount of greens in the &#34;salad&#34;. This is my kind of salad! 
2) Burrata ($16) This dish consisted of a big ball of fresh mozzarella on top of a bed of prosciutto. This was a very enjoyable dish, which I ate with the crunchy bread that they give you. Great dish to share, although I felt like it was a lot of prosciutto for two people but if we had more people with us, it would be a perfect appetizer. 

Pasta
The portion of the pasta was quite small but perfect for us since we were a bit full from our appetizers already:
1) Fettuccine Funghi ($12)- I would totally order this pasta again. It was creamy, came with a lot of mushrooms and you can taste the delicious truffle oil and garlic in the sauce. The fettucine was perfectly cooked.
2) Rigatoni Gamberi ($12)- I liked the spicy tomato sauce and grilled shrimp for this dish. However, I felt that the pasta was a bit undercooked.

The food is definitely worth coming here for if you can look past the extremely crammed space."

I&#39;d definitely recommend this place for happy hour. They have $1 oysters- huge blue point oysters when we went. Dinner was also delicious, with $12 for a plate of pasta that tastes well worth it. I ordered the pesto dish and was very pleased with my choice. My friend ordered the gnocchi and parmesan special which was so rich and creamy with a nice truffle flavor. Just be careful to ask for the prices before ordering the specials, because we didn&#39;t realize until the bill came that the gnocchi special was twice the cost of the regular pasta dishes. We also each got a glass of wine for $8, which the bar tenders will let you taste before ordering. 

Although the food was great, the space was not. It was such a tight squeeze, even for a NYC bar/restaurant. The only dining area has one table where they seat multiple parties. It&#39;s a cute family style seating, but you will be in your neighbor&#39;s business for sure. The bar area was so narrow and packed that the waitress had trouble walking over with food or the bill to those sitting on the outer bar. Your best bet is to sit at the main bar, that way you don&#39;t have to get up and the waitress can reach you more easily. Otherwise you may not get the best service, since the waitresses tend to hang near the bar which provides the only open space for staff.

I&#39;d definitely come back for happy hour, those oysters are well worth it!"

It&#39;s just a long wooden table with stools. I also encountered a very rude, bratty hostess. I can only assume it was someone&#39;s niece who was forced to come in and help out. 

Now on to the food. I went for the octopus salad, while my friends went with the pasta. It wasn&#39;t a particularly large portion, but it was just right. The oil they used to to flavor the octopus salad was delicious. 

Not sure if I&#39;d return, but it would be related to the lack of regular tables. It&#39;s best suited for wine tastings and events like that."

While we were waiting, a man (perhaps the manager or the owner) blocked the entrance with the sandwich board. Ok? The hostess motioned for us to come in. We had to sidestep/hop around the sandwich board to enter the restaurant. The aforementioned man took our orders and promptly ignored us for the rest of the evening. A bus boy brought our bread, appetizer, and entrees. I wouldn&#39;t be so offended if I hadn&#39;t watched the man (who seemed to be the owner or manager) socializing heavily with the two groups next to us, all the while completely ignoring us. 

I ordered the pesto risotto, which sounded interesting as I&#39;d never seen the two combined before. Although the dish was a strong shade of green, I did not detect much pesto flavor. Still, the risotto was fine. It was difficult for me to draw the attention of our supposed waiter (whom I suspect is the owner or manager) because he was so busy chatting with the people next to us. For the same reason, it was also difficult for us to get our check. As we left, we again had to sidestep/hop around the sandwich board, which I think is ridiculous. Fine, I get it, you&#39;re closed, but at least let people leave! Incredibly unprofessional and rude to allow customers to dance around a sandwich board to exit!"

There were no tables available but we agreed to sit at the bar which is usually better IMO. You get to get in tight with bartenders and we could see the food being made in the kitchen. We each ordered a half bottle of wine (they didn&#39;t serve full bottles of what we wanted), and got three small plates to share- the perfect amount of food for two.

For some reason this place is reluctant to use their AC to its full extent - they not only left the door open, but they also had 20+ tiny CANDLES as decor. CANDLES. IN 92 DEGREE WEATHER. Who decided that was a good idea?

Only when multiple people, who were already crammed into a space so tight and right next to 20 candles and a kitchen which - surprise, surprise - uses heat to cook food, complained, the waitstaff made a grand gesture to close the doors. But remember, the AC was barely on, so it didn&#39;t help much with the kitchen action and being in a tiny space with 10+ people.

Honesty, I couldn&#39;t enjoy the food because we were fighting the heat for our lives and swatting mosquito away.

The menu is not much but absolutely enough for you to pick from. I know this place offers a variety kinds of spaghetti. Definitely order some if you are s fan. Seafood here is also nice. I tried squid, mussel, and lobster-all were yummy. 

This place is tiny but with a good size bar. So you should order some alcohol too of you are not in a rush. Service is so so-they are always busy and don&#39;t care customers much. But I&#39;m ok with it, which leaves me more privacy.

FOOD: I ordered the lobster ravioli and octupus salad with my friend. The ravioli was a bit overcooked for me, not as al dente, as I would have hoped. People here rave about the cheap prices (~$10 per entree), but honestly, portion sizes are small! The octupus salad was the best though. Perfectly grilled and seasoned and not overcooked because we all know overcooked octupus tastes like rubber. 

SERVICE: This is where the three stars comes in. I was rushed to order, but when we were ready to order, we were promptly skipped. The wine did come quickly, but the food was a little slow. At the end of the meal, upon signing the check, a not so gentle nudge to leave the communal table was given. I mean, that&#39;s the New York City way, no? I wish though the service was a bit better, but with so many people in such a small space, no wonder the service lacks. 

I would try this again if I was in the area again, but squeezing in through the bar area, sitting at a really tight communal table is not really my jam. I would look for another Italian place in this great city."

We got seated right away. Since it&#39;s such a small restaurant we had to share a rectangular shaped communal table. It has stools that can seat 8 people on each side. Shelves of wine bottles line both side of the walls. 

Our waiter was friendly, you can tell he was a &#34;real Italian&#34; as he had a very thick Italian accent. I could barely understand him as he explained the Specials. 
Although he was very nice and always checked on us. 

I ordered the Fettuccine Funghi. It was delicious! The sauce, the mushrooms, the chunks of garlic &amp; the aldent√® pasta were all cooked to perfection. They also served complimentary bread which we had to ask for. It was very crusty and went well with Olive oil and balsamic vinegar. 

My boyfriend ordered the Linguine pasta with Clams, white wine and garlic sauce. I had a taste of it and it too was just as delicious and full of flavor! 

Overall, great restaurant &amp; decent price! If you don&#39;t mind sharing a communal table, are not claustrophobic and want delicious authentic Italian food then this place is for you! You won&#39;t be disappointed."

Squeezing in thru the bar area into the dining room was struggle city. Once seated at the long communal table, I could finally sit back and appreciate the rustic decor. It has a wine cellar vibe with dimly lit lights; its a cute romantic spot. You have to hang your coat up on the wall and pretty much hold onto your bags underneath the table (annoying), but the food was so good that I forgot all about my discomfort. 

We started with the Crostini di Pulpo which was just perfect. The octopus was so tender and it paired really well with the salsa verde. I&#39;d like to say I enjoyed the crostini but it scraped the roof of my mouth (we all know that feel). We tried 4 pastas but I can only recall 2 of them: Tagliatelle Bolognese &amp; Garganelli Osso Bucco. They were both yummy but the bolognese reallyyy blew us away... WOW. Pretty sure they were heavy handed with the heavy cream in that dish but I ain&#39;t complaining! My friend &amp; I also split a bottle of cabernet so its safe to say that we walked out of there pleasantly full &amp; buzzed. Service was pleasant, no complaints.

1st of all - while there is AC in the back of the kitchen, the temperature in the restaurant yesterday was like a sauna.  If I were them, I would run out and buy some fans at least.  I couldn&#39;t even cross my legs yesterday as when I did, sweat was dripping down my legs.  A couple of smart people came in and left straight away cause they said they couldn&#39;t eat with the temperature so warm

Unfortunately we had ordered a bottle, so we finished the bottle in the sauna like temperature and then high tailed it out of there.

Wait staff was RUDE.  Asked for ice, and got a look like I had 2 heads.  One of the waitresses / servers / staff was drinking some coffee concoction by the door.  Really? How many places allow the staff to be eating in the middle of the restaurant???

And lastly, at one point, there were 4 of them all huddled in the back, and we couldn&#39;t flag anyone to come over and get us the bill.

While the pasta smelled amazing, do yourself a favor and go downtown to Terra on Franklin street.  This place is a smaller, non AC, rude version of their sister restaurant.

I really hope management reads my review.  There&#39;s a lot left to be desired here."

I was actually torn between voting 3 stars or 4 stars. I would love to give this a 3 and a half stars if it were possible. I&#39;ll explain why below.


I normally avoid Times Square like the plague, because any native New Yorker knows that this area is just one big overpriced Disneyland for tourists who don&#39;t know any better. If you want authentic food, you need to head to lower Manhattan, the Lower East Side, or Brooklyn. But I saw that Briciola was rated 4 stars and me naturally being a pasta fiend I had to check it out. The restaurant is a very tiny, cramped space. There is literally just a narrow space for just one person to walk thro the aisle. The restaurant has two narrow strips that function as two continuous tables, one by the bar in the front and the other strip in the back. It was a very busy night, so I waited for about 25 minutes before one couple finished eating and the spot became available. 

I sat down promptly and began reading the menu as fast as I could so that I could order my food quickly. I saw from the plates of my neighboring patrons that the portion sizes here are small, so I knew I had to order two pastas. I started first with the Gnocchi Sorrentina. Honestly, I wasn&#39;t too impressed. The gnocchi was cooked just right, but there was barely any sauce on the dish!! A great pasta dish should be bathing in sauce in my opinion. So what I did was I ordered a side of meatballs, because I knew the meatballs would come with a generous helping of sauce. I used the sauce from the meatballs to supplement the skimpy amount of sauce on the gnocchi. 

For my second plate of pasta, I actually looked to the guy sitting right next to me and asked him what he ordered, because it both looked &amp; smelled amazing. It was the Fettuccine ai Funghi. I ordered that as well and thankfully this dish was a winner. The fettuccine cooked al dente, and this particular mushroom sauce was creamy and rich, unlike at other restaurants which often create bland, mediocre mushroom sauces. Now that I think about it, I should have just ordered two Ai Funghis LOL. That would have pushed my rating all the way to a 4. I finished the night with 3 scoops of vanilla gelato drizzled with warm chocolate."

This is a typical New York very narrow restaurant that has a long table and you&#39;re sitting shoulder to shoulder with the people next directly next to you. Super cute space with a great wine selection as well. I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here with too many people since it&#39;s pretty tiny- we came with a group of 4 and luckily didn&#39;t have a ridiculous wait. 

The food is incredible - for $12/pasta, I cannot say enough good things about it. My personal favorite is the tagliatelle with wild boar. The sauce is flavorful and the boar is delicious and goes so well with the pasta. I&#39;ve also had the ravioli which is also incredible but you may need another dish with that. The lamp chop appetizer is fantastic as well. Overall, I would try a bunch of things and share them with whoever you go with because nothing is disappointing. I&#39;m moving out of NY soon and am bummed I won&#39;t get the same level of pasta anywhere else. Briciola is a hidden gem and I&#39;d go back here weekly if I could to try every kind of pasta.

My experience: On Tuesday, October 11 2016 from 6pm to 8:30pm; My girlfriend, and a my cousin&#39;s wife decided to grab some drinks and dinner here. We ordered ricotta ravioli, and 2 squid salads + 3 glasses of wine, and by the way, wanted to have more wine, but the bill was brought to us without asking for it. Anyway, the food was good, the wine was good, but the service was simple out of this world terrible! How in such a great city is such shit service acceptable is beyond me. To make a long story short, the main issue is that the manager (a tall, bald, skinny, and arrogant french guy... looked like he was in his early 40s), came over and had the balls to ask our table: &#34;Excuse me, was there anything wrong?&#34;, to which my girlfriend replied: &#34;why?&#34;... At that point, we were all looking at each other while this messieurs highjacks our evening dinner, and kills the vibe, So, basically, this guy says: &#34;well, you only left 10% tip so...&#34; Inside of me I&#39;m thinking &#34;is this guy for real?&#34;, nonetheless, I answered him and said: &#34;well, I decided to leave that tip to you, because I thought that the service was terrible, and that I did not appreciate his service in particular&#34;.. guy responds all agitated in a rude and loud tone of voice: &#34;well, if it&#39;s terrible there are plenty of other places you can go to have dinner and drinks on the block&#34;! Meanwhile, two girls next to us asked: &#34;What happened?&#34; We told them, and then they also shared their bad experience venting out over wine for a few minutes, terrible. Can you believe paying money for this experience? Well, it happens. Before I left, I went and told this guy that I WILL take his advice, meaning, my friends and I WILL go to other places on the block instead of here next time, and that we&#39;re never coming back again.

&#34;...Signed my bill, and finished drinking my last glass. A few minutes later the bartender came over to me and said &#34;excuse me, you made a mistake on the receipt.&#34; I asked where. He said &#34;you only left 10% tip.&#34; I said, &#34;well, I usually leave $1 for every drink at a bar (which I think is totally normal and I&#39;d welcome any private messages telling me I&#39;m wrong because...am I?)- I actually left 25% more than I would typically.&#34; He said &#34;this is not that kind of bar,&#34; and then walked away....&#34;

&#34;...After a 15% tip he came up to us (in front of my date) fronting me for the low tip he got and asking what was the problem..

&#34;...Until we were accosted at the door on our way out, by a manager who wrongly assumed that we had shorted our server/bartender on a tip. In fact his words were: &#34;Was there a problem with the service? Because you only tipped 10% and the standard is 20%....&#34;

&#34;...As we were leaving the manager stopped us, partially blocking the door, and asked very confrontationally if we had experienced a problem with our service because we had only tipped 10%. Honestly, if we had wanted to tip 10%, that (while shitty) was certainly within our discretion....&#34;

Great meal.  Started with the Buratta special followed by Ceasar and paparadell.  The ceasar was the weakest dish - little too heavy on the dressing which made the salad a bit soggy.  Paparadell was perfect.

The lunch special includes a pasta dish and a glass of wine for $15. The portions are perfectly sized -- large enough to fulfill a wicked carb craving, but not so huge that you drop into a food coma. The pasta itself is delicious and fresh and the sauces are hearty.

Briciola used to be the smaller restaurant on the south side of 51st, with a communal table. It was always packed, there was always a wait. This place clearly does well because they expanded to have their overflow customers go across the street. The darkly lit ambience is great. I love the lights around the storefront. 

I love that their pastas are all around $12. I thought their appetizers were cutely prepared.

What I cannot get over is the sheer number of large houseflies in the restaurant. It&#39;s the summertime, and the door lets a lot of them in. But I lost my appetite after I saw all of the flies intermittently snacking/squatting on the breadbaskets sitting behind the bar. Then I would see these breadbaskets being served to tables. I stopped eating my bread and really hoped that my already ordered pasta never encountered a fly.

We dined at the bar in the back by the kitchen. Place seems like a hidden gem. Very narrow place but towards the back there is also more seatings.

I have to admit I was kind of annoyed. Seating at the end of the bar where service area would go back and forth. I&#39;m a lefty so every now and then service kept swooshing my arm and its like what the freak. I&#39;m about to put food in my mouth and if I missed it it would have been all over my white top -_- but whatever. 

I thought the food was ok nothing really to rave about...

Ordered: 

- Blue Point Oysters (it was sandy because they did not wash the shell thoroughly) I wouldn&#39;t recommend ordering them. There was two pea crabs in two oysters. I found that to be kind of unappealing... 
- Vongole Origante (Baked Clams)
- Cozze Marinate (Steamed Mussels)
- Ravioli Ricotta 
- Bucatini Amiriciana (Pork Cheek Sauce, Grill Onions, Tomato Pasta)

Ambience was really chilled and relax. This would be a to go bar for a drink and maybe some dessert other than that ehh. 

Tips:
Avoid the Sandy Blue Point Oysters &amp; do not sit at the end of the bar by the kitchen if you are a left handed eater. 

I wonder how are the cooks able to see in that dark small cornered kitchen. Their guide was candle lighting. I saw because I peaked and they use the same candle light setting at the bar in their little kitchen."

Its tiny and crowded but makes very tasty small plates of authentic Italian dishes... nothing over $17 or so.... 3 of us ate for under $50 and were perfectly full (no alcohol) 

They have a wonderful selection of wine by the bottle and the glass- a nice crowd that all intermingle at either the bar or the one long communal table...

If you are looking for quiet or privacy- this is not the place. If you have a big group it will be impossible since it seats about 12-14 at the one big table.....and it is popular. But for fun and a real NY experience- this is the place if you are 2-4 people.

They usually have burrata as a special which is fantastic- macaroni and cheese with truffle- linguini with clams- gnocchi....garlic shrimp- are some of my favorites. Never got a bad dish.

And again- the prices are great- its also nice to share some dishes.

Found this place on yelp and after reading such great reviews I decided to have lunch with a friend here. I arrived early and was disappointed by the size of the restaurant - it&#39;s small with high chairs only. We decided to dine here anyway and I&#39;m so happy we did. The food? Amazing!!!! Prepared in a small open kitchen, everything was flavorful. I had rigatoni with shrimp, garlic and spinach for my entree. Dates with Gorgonzola cheese for an appetizer as well as a small cheese plate (we shared). I can&#39;t remember the name of the wine that I had but it was good - not sweet how I usually like it but they found something suitable. Cheesecake for dessert. Not huge portions which is why I was able to eat so much :-)

The staff? Awesome. Our waiter was attentive, provided great recommendations and made a bit of conversation with us. Most waitstaff forget about connecting with the customer but he did not.

It ended up being a very cool experience. The wait was minimal. But I can imagine it being. Dry hard to get in later in the evening or with a larger party. We went at 5:30 and there were only 3 of us. The table was full. The hostess and waiter were all very attentive and prompt. The minute is in Italian, but it included English descriptions of the dishes. We ordered the meatball in marinara and mozzarella caprese with crusty bread as appetizers. Both of these were amazing. The marinara sauce on the meatballs was the best I&#39;ve ever had. For our entries we ordered 4 cheese ravioli, shrimp risotto with pesto sauce and artichoke penne also with pesto sauce. They were all perfect. I love sauces and every sauce we tried was nursing with flavor, not just salt (like most American food).

So if you&#39;re insane like me, you may also notice the wine menu at Briciola resembles the one at Aria in the West Village. 

That&#39;s because Briciola is owned by chef Roberto Passon, who also owns the Perry St. Aria, a second Aria, AND Cotenna.

Anyone who runs that many successful wine bars/restaurants in this city must be doing something right. And it&#39;s not difficult to see just how Passon is making it happen. 

Like Aria on Perry St., Briciola is rustic, romantic, and delightful. The wine selection is strong and well-priced, the servers are kind, and while I can&#39;t vouch for the food here, I&#39;m hopeful any wine bar with meat hanging from the ceiling serves good tapas. 

I still prefer the Perry St. Aria because of that unbeatable West Village ambiance. But for a wine bar in the Theater District, Briciola is wonderful -- and clearly a strong member of this Passon restaurant empire."

I got the Fettuccini Funghi and was shocked at how good it was. The sauce is absolutely perfect. We got Tiramisu for desert which was perfection in every bite.

Order the mushroom bruschetta, goat cheese and tomato sauce, or the meatballs to start. Out of the pastas, spicy shrimp and papardelle ossobuco are both really good and filling.

Two appetizers and a pasta would be perfect for two. All the wines are pretty reasonable between 30-60 a bottle. Come here because you&#39;re not in a rush and just want to enjoy the company you are with. You&#39;ll also walk away with new friends at Briciola since the service is friendly and helpful."

I love the atmosphere, the decor with the mix of brick and wood and glass and the choice of sitting at the bar or the communal table!
My date and I started with the burata appetizer and it was delicious.  He also had the sardines which are not my thing but I tasted them and they were almost not bad.. He assured me they were delicious..
We had a wonderful feta and peperoni salad and then had roasted cauliflower and a spicy shrimp and pasta that was perfectly cooked in an amazing sauce.
Very simply delicious food done to perfection!  Our service was great and for a busy Saturday night our wait was only 10 minutes!
Definitely on our list of neighborhood favorites."

Finally, when I spotted a hand-crank pasta roller on sale, I bought it, made my very first batch, and swore off all boxed pasta.

That&#39;s how good fresh pasta is, my friends.  Once you have it (and realize how stupidly easy it is to make), you&#39;ll never want the stuff from the supermarket ever again.

Briciola has some darn amazing pasta.  It&#39;s quite a tiny spot, but we were able to snag two seats at the long bar on a weekday around lunch time to enjoy the food.  I ordered the pappardelle with the wild boar ragu, and HELLO CARBS I LOVE YOU.  For those of you who only eat spaghetti and meatballs, trust me, try this rendition and it&#39;ll be all over for you.

Cute place, good food, decent prices.  Definitely a must for whenever I want an Italian fix!"

It&#39;s the perfect restaurant to go for a date. Let me start with my favorite dish the octopus salad. This dish is phenomenal, it&#39;s the perfect balance of acidity which is a great start to a perfect meal. For entrees we ordered the skirt steak and fettuccine ai funghi. Both dishes were delicious and cooked to perfection. The steak is a special dish not on the menu but they always have it. I love how every dish is perfect to share and the price is very reasonable, not expensive at all. Definitely bring your date here and trust me they will not be disappointed. If you have a large party and you really want to try out the dishes, you should go to their sister restaurant Aria in west village. The menu is exactly the same maybe on some occasions they won&#39;t have some special dishes but the food is equally as good. I&#39;ll definitely be back when I&#39;m around the area!"

We were too hungry to wait and briciola looked nice so we decided to give it a try. Place is small and cute. Nicely decorated with lots of wine. We sat at a long table with lots of different parties. It&#39;s cozy but can get really loud since you&#39;re surrounded by many people at the table. Not recommended for intimate/romantic date night. But overall, it has a very nice atmosphere. 

Menu looked reasonably priced. Small plates priced around $10-15 and pastas around $12. But we wanted to try today&#39;s special which were octopus salad, skirt steak ($21), and creamy gnocchi with truffle ($23). Special menu were a bit highly priced then whats on the menu. We also had two glasses of wine - one merlot and one pinot grigio - which were $9 and $8 respectively. 

Foods were good in general but not fantastic. I&#39;m from boston and I&#39;ve had better italian food in boston&#39;s north end. I&#39;m a sucker for gnocchi and anything with truffle oil or truffle flavor but briciola&#39;s gnocchi didnt really live up to my hype. Octopus salad was good but not what i was expecting. I was expecting something cold with more fresh taste and with lots of greens. Skirt steak was pretty good as well."

The texture was heaven.. the morsels were so large and inside was so fresh that one might mistake it for pork belly fat. The &#34;salad&#34; was served with sparse bits of greens and potato, which allowed the octopus to overpower its accouterments (as it should!).

Prices are very reasonable for the high-quality food they offer, and the staff made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I came by myself, so I ended up chatting with them. Very friendly and nice people. 
The interior is nothing like I&#39;ve seen before - the tiny space is split up in two with a bar on one side, and a long table on the other. Wood everywhere, big windows, good music. 
I was craving gnocchi, as I told the guy who was taking my order - that day they had a truffle gnocchi special, so that&#39;s what I went for, paired with a glass of dry, fresh white wine. The dish came with bread and olive oil dip - this little detail made me absolutely ecstatic."

They ran out of oysters but we still decided to stay. This was only a block away from our hotel. I already expected this place was really small. They had a small dining area and bar. It was busy at the bar though. 

They seated us right away at the bar as the dining area was full. Another couple sat right next to us at the bar but they were helped right away. I am not sure if we looked like we were not ready but we did came first to the bar. They could have waited just a sec for us to tell what we wanted. I expected this guy to be helpful to us first. I am not sure if he was the manager or not as he did not have the uniform. 

I do not usually mention this but I have to say it. I felt he brushed us off as he was helping all the white folks or French speaking folks more (no discrimination here but observation only). We had to ask for assistance often instead of him asking us if we needed anything. That was rude! This is why I felt we were not priority. We were the only Asians in the restaurant at the time and that was my speculation only.  This would not happen in SF.

We ordered the Bruschetta, lamb and lobster risotto. All were so good! Thanks Yelpers! Everything was really cooked perfectly. The lamb was cooked medium and flavor blended well. I was surprised it only cost $10 for two pieces. I should have have ordered two servings. The lobster risotto had big chunks of lobster and had full of flavors. The risotto was cooked well; not bad for $20! The bruschetta was filled with wild mushrooms and cheese on toasted bread. It was good, too. The house Merlot was good as well. For some reason, I got tipsy fast from their wine! ;-p All they had was wine....

If it weren&#39;t for the food, I would have rated it no stars but decided to rate two. I rated heavily for the experience. I would have come back but after this experience, I will have to think about it. Too bad!"

I came with 3 friends on a Thursday evening around 7PM. There was no wait but we weren&#39;t allowed to sit until the whole party arrived. The restaurant is comprised on 2 main sections: bar seating and a shared long table. Shelves of wine with a few tall chairs separate the two..this is also where people sit to wait. It&#39;s extremely inconvenient to wait there because the seating arrangement makes it impossible for more than 2 people to talk to each other and every time someone walks by, they brush your shoulder or back. The food is amazing though! I tried:

**Burrata with prosciutto and bread
**Side of brussel sprouts - semi sweet
**Lobster ravioli - 5 or 6 large raviolis with asparagus
**Fettuccine with mushroom
**$1 oysters - very plump!

The burrata and oysters were specials but they don&#39;t seem to change the specials often. The pasta portions are not very big so sides or appetizers are definitely needed for a full meal. All the food was so tasty that I want to come back to try more! The bathroom is a small room in the corner that has a window directly facing pipes and another building. The sink is above the toilet (can you even imagine this). By the time we left around 9PM, there were quite a few people waiting and since people sitting at bars don&#39;t all sit parallel to the bar (they turn sideways to face each other), I had to bump into 10 people on my out. Overall, come here for GREAT Italian food but the small venue may cause some issues."

If I had to think of a one word to describe to describe this place it would be value particularly in the neighborhood its in. Spot is not good for large groups but definitely a good place for a date. 

Swung by for a quick bite tonight before catching a show. Had the grilled octopus salad, octopus was great as always, potatoes were very under cook though its normally not. Maybe because it was a Monday night, mistakes happen and the other 3 times it was good so not going to knock the place on it. 

Gnocchi&#39;s were above average though I would prefer if they were smaller in size as I find many places server huge oversized gnocchi&#39;s. Lobster ravioli was bland, disappointing and I would not order again. Desserts are okay but not outstanding. Total bill for 2 people, 2 apps, 2 pastas, 2 glasses of wine and 1 dessert was around 90 before tip.

I&#39;ve had the octopus salad here twice and it was consistently good both times. Thinking about eating it again makes my mouth water. So does the burrata special. Then I remember the hostess and would rather just skip all the fuss. She stares you down, pushes you around, seemed absolutely clueless, and was unapologetic for all of this. We understand that it&#39;s a small space - and in Hells Kitchen - but there isn&#39;t really a need to rudely, squish everyone together.

Being an ave away from my apartment makes it really easy to frequent and I am happy to have stumbled in and squeezed myself into the cramped bar space back in July because I have been a regular here ever since.  Whether taking advantage of the dollar oysters (these run out often so try to arrive early before they do), splitting a bottle of wine with friends, or indulging in tapas, Briciola is a great venue to start your night at. No reservations though, sorry. 

Do not come with a large group.  I say 3-4 people should be your max.  Be advised that if you are in a group of more than two people you will likely be at a community table so you might need to hold back on talk of your Saturday night underground sex ring excursions (unless of course you think your neighbor may be into some weird shit too). Just kidding guys, not in an underground sex ring, so cool your excitement.  

Anyway, my go to here is the sangiovese by the glass. I have gotten a few bottles here too but blanking on the types at the moment.  The french bartender here seems to know his shit so go to him for a solid Q&amp;A on the wines.  You will see the wine list is actually on a tiny wooden slab written in chalk and can be difficult to read at times so again refer to the french dude.

Excellent food options here (I just get tapas) include:
1. Tuna Tartare
2. Lamb Chops
3. Grilled Octopus
4. Burrata

And to no surprise, you can&#39;t go wrong with a fine selection of cheeses either. Yum Yum."

I usually love this place and have been more than 5 times but Sunday night I was abhorred by how horrible the service was. A tall, European, waiter who seemed like he was the owner was rude to us and rolled his eyes whenever we asked for something. We waited patiently for everything but when the bill took 20 minutes in a place that only had 4 other parties, it was unacceptable. We asked again and he gave us attitude again.

HAIR IN FOOD. I found a piece of hair in my delicious meatball pasta. I decided to not complain and just set it aside. I told the lady waitress about the hair and she just looked at the other young man and they both left looking confused. I wasn&#39;t expecting a replacement. UT at least an apology or acknowledgement?

The other staff were friendly but completely lost. They looked at the tall man with a scared look everytime we asked for something. 

I was very very disappointed with this dinner given I&#39;ve been a loyal fan for 2 years."

Everything was worth the price and it was under $15.  I wish the place was a little bit bigger because it was hard to reach the waitress sometimes since it was pretty crowded.

This place is quaint with one side of the restaurant being having a bar table and the other a high countertop-like communal table. Wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here with more than 4 ppl.

Everything was amazing here!!! We had the wild boar pasta, gnocchi, buratta (sooooo creamy) and the beet salad!

I had been here for a quick glass of wine with a friend before this but, this time I got to taste the food. I got the wild boar parpadelle and also tried the octopus salad and the lamb chop.. Everything was delicious!! We sat at the bar/counter and the service was great as well.

Cant wait to go back again for more wine and the food that took me back to Italy!"

Briciola stood out with it&#39;s library shelves of wine bottles and dark crowded communal seating.  A friendly inquiry to the kind waitress and in moments I was enjoying a half glass of primitivo $20 and in another moment cutting on a lovely plate of lambchops $10 - a good cut seasoned well with deep flavor and a wonderful sweet sauce but perhaps a little fattier than I like.

The menu (a paper placemat looking thing) is reasonable $9 small plates $14 pasta dishes, and $5 meats and cheeses.
A woman next to me recommended the octopus special - which was wonderfully prepared - meaty - smoky not chewy.  
I passed the plate around to my new found buddies at the bar which scored me a free glass of wine.  

&#34;I had the $250 price fix at eleven madison park for lunch last week - but this place is more fun.  Atmosphere goes a long way.&#34;  My architect dining comrade noted.  

Wine helps - and glasses are reasonable - starting at $9 - so a European bistro experience can be achieved easily for around $40 - half that if your careful. 

Briciola balances good European bistro food with being approachable and comfortable in this very busy and touristy area not far from Times Square.  

I wanted to eat more which is always a good sign."

The ambiance is very cozy and romantic. This really would have been a great date place had the food been better. The lighting is dim and it&#39;s rather small, which is what I&#39;ve come to find out about NYC restaurants. 

We came around 9 pm and were quickly seated along this long island table with other people from different parties. Ordered the pappardelle ossobuco and was rather disappointed with it. It tasted fairly bland and I just wish that there was salt around so I could season it some more. The veal shanks didn&#39;t seem all that tender and honestly, my friend&#39;s mac and cheese looked more and more appealing. Also ordered a few oysters and they weren&#39;t too bad. I may just not like blue point oysters all that much. I had oysters at Mermaid oyster bar the night before and those were just fantastic. I think I also like the smaller oysters compared to the larger ones. 

When I asked for the check and whether we could split it into three separate checks, I was met with a dismissive attitude. He outright said that the check was already printed out and handed us the check without another thought. That was a bit rude and left me with an unpleasant experience. Hopefully it was just an off day for them, but I sadly will not be going back here the next time I&#39;m in NYC."

We saw various parties clustered around the community table in the wine room/back room area, and although we kept walking down the street, we had seen enough to be intrigued. Thankfully we turned around and went back. 

Our charming server looked like she was waiting on the entire place, and with a pretty italian accent she made a few helpful suggestions. We had noticed the octopus salad on the blackboard outside, and this was one of the best I have ever had. Substantial quantity of octopus that seemed to have been grilled and then sauteed with celery, some tomatoes, tiny potatoes, a bit of garlic, and with pesto, olive oil and some balsamic vinegar drizzled around it. It was sublime. We used the loaf of warm grilled crusty bread to clean up the sauce like we were squeegee-ing a windshield!

The pasta course that followed was relatively light and fresh: decent gnocchi simply prepared with tomato and basil and some mozzarella. The linguine with fresh clams was delicious. My only qualm would be that I could eat double the portions of the pastas.

In all, an enchanting space with an efficient kitchen. I would love to return when the candles flicker and shadows flit around the small area and wine flows to start a magical night."

Loved the burrata! We also got a dozen oysters, and two pasta dishes. In the times we went, the food was consistently good!

My first time to Briciola was lunch  with my boss.  I was expecting the usual rushed lunch time meal.  But no, this place was amazing.  Home style Italian food, amazing ambience and the friendliest of staff.  

I have been back many times now  and have tried just about everything on the menu and it never fails to disappoint.  This includes the wine list, Super Tucan red ( cant remember the name) for under $40. What, that can&#39;t be true??  Yes it can and boy was it good.  A great pairing with our Baby Roasted Artichokes in herb sauce with black olives,  grilled lamb chops, grilled calamari, Gnocchi al Pesto and the Tagiatelle Alla Bolognese.

A special date night place, go to the theatre and then dinner afterwards.  Romantic, great food and best of all, great prices.  The space is a little small /cozy but just adds to the vibe as does the authentic Italian / European servers and manager.

I know, there are so many great places to eat at when in NYC but really, trust me when I say, this is a place not to be missed."

Was so lucky that we didn&#39;t have to experience a wait.  When we sat down we were the only ones in line and there were still plenty of tables available.  We sat there for 45 minutes before our food came...  They brought us cornbread, which was delicious, but no real checking in besides that.  I ordered a coffee with milk and sugar and had to wait about 5 minutes for the sugar.  I was afraid to order another since it took so long.  But then the food came and my dreams came true.  That is the reason this place still gets 4 stars.  The service leaves something to be desired, but the food is SO GOOD!  Plus it&#39;s a little pricey, but you don&#39;t really feel the cost because they give you a massive portion.  We had sweet potato pancakes and the California omelet (I think that was the name).  Both were outstanding!

I will definitely be back when I don&#39;t have anything to do immediately afterward so I can take my time and try not to get cranky."

I was in the Fort Greene and decided to check out this place given the generally positive review.

The place is beautifully decorated with leather seats and a cute outdoor seating area.

We shared a smoked vegetable flat bread as a starter. The veggies were tasty but I didn&#39;t taste any smoky flavor if there&#39;s any. The flat bread was pretty hard and dry. I suspect they froze the flat bread and just throw it on a grill or oven without thawing it.

For the entree, wife and I got a bqe Salmon burger and their best seller chicken and waffle. 

The salmon burger came with a hefty amount of crunchy fries covered in parmesan - they were really good. The salmon burger was ok. Something was off in their salmon seasoning. I think they put way to much oregano or something similar and it was over powering.

Something with the fried chicken. The herb dominated the chicken flavor which made it taste a little weird. Otherwise the chicken was juicy and nicely fried. The waffle was really good. Moist and a little crispy on the outside. The waffle was probably the best thing of the entire meal.

Overall it&#39;s a beautiful place to eat in but the food fell short of my expectation. Will only come back again if I am in the area."

Coming here was a great decision because the food was dynamite, the vibe was right and I&#39;m totally in love! The only reason why I didn&#39;t give this place 5 stars was because my boyfriend and I had to sit at the bar to eat because we were told there weren&#39;t any tables open, when we arrived (11pm). I kept my eye on an empty table for the entire time we sat, ate and payed the bill. We asked the hostess to let us know if a table was available but we were again told there were no open tables. Smh

So now, months later what can I say about this place other than it&#39;s amazing? Well that&#39;s if you count the drinks out or perhaps that&#39;s just the drink that I bought then returned and had them make another then had to return again until I think I just settled with a fountain drink! 

The food is amaziiiiiiiing! So, I&#39;m all for waffles and I&#39;m all for fried chicken and after frequently visiting LA I mean realistically does anything even come close to Roscoe&#39;s!? I don&#39;t know but if there was some sort of contest SoCo isn&#39;t too far behind. I would say in a race Roscoe&#39;s is probably Usain Bolt and SoCo is a second runner up and that&#39;s definitely NOT TOO SHABBY if I do say so myself. I mean, these red velvet waffles are great and once they come together with the hot tender fried chicken it&#39;s really a masterpiece right in your mouth. I mean even the side of Mac was like delicious. So cheesy in all the right places. 

While reminiscing and writing this review I think I might have to make another visit because it&#39;s worth the money and drive. 

Oh, and how could I forget about the wonderful ambiance. I mean any place that plays jazz while I&#39;m eating is surely a winner in my book. Romantic enough for a date and definitely trendy enough for a girls night out."

I had the pleasure of having dinner here last week after having this bookmarked for so long and I can&#39;t believe it took me so long to check this place out. 

Three of us came in on a weekday night and it was packed in here! We had no reservations and let the hostess know that. She said she&#39;ll check on a table for us and let us know but we can wait at the bar, so we did. A drink and 10-15 mins go by and still no table. We kept seeing her walking back and forth but hadn&#39;t approached us yet. Then we saw a party of three who walked in after us almost get seated before us by another host! So I quickly intercepted and informed the host we were waiting for a table. He sat us right away!! So what exactly were we waiting for that WHOLE time? She didn&#39;t forget about us because we made eye contact with her several times. 

Whatever, that was weird but the second we sat down that was totally redeemed by our waiter Tyler. He was amazing! He was super funny, down to earth, knew his menu and was prompt about everything we ordered and needed. His recommendations were on point. 

I had the lobster, shrimp and grits and my goodness it was heavenly. Their drinks are pricey, but very good. The mac and cheese was the bomb, appetizer ribs were perfectly flavored and tender. I mean, no dish was disappointing. Ambiance was totally chill, everyone around you is just having great food and drinks and enjoying themselves. 

I have to come back and try their brunch everyone raves about."

Never had anything I didn&#39;t like. I also go for the chicken and waffle. You will not regret getting it! The chicken is so juicy and full of flavor. Sometimes I don&#39;t even make it to the waffle because the chicken is so delicious. I&#39;ve also tried the sweet potato pancakes which are also amazing. For drink I recommend the Mardi Gras, it&#39;s their version of a rum punch. Pretty good! One thing I didn&#39;t like about this place.

I have had a lot of friends mention this spot for brunch and how popular it was.  At first we wanted to sit at a table and then we noticed the bar was wide open.  We opted for the bar and we were greeted by the bartender (Daniel).  The menu has a little of something for everyone in your party from Shrimp &amp; Lobster grits to Steak and Eggs. 

My friend opted for the Red Velvet Waffles and Chicken and I selected the Strawberry Shortcake French Toast.  We decided to share the Mac N Cheese and an order of cornbread (since it is free with your Yelp Check In).  The Mac N Cheese is beyond amazing and the perfect size for 2 people to share.  The cornbread was decent but nothing to write home to momma about.  The Strawberry Shortcake French Toast was really good and it had this strawberry cream in between the 2 pieces of French Toast.  I ordered a beverage from their signature cocktail menu, and the hibiscus margarita was everything.  I just wish it was a larger drink :( .  It is by far the smallest margarita I have ever had!

I loved the setup of Soco!  It has a very large inviting bar and personable bartender (Shoutout to Daniel for being awesome).  They also have outdoor and indoor seating as well and it appears to be a great place for large parties. 

All in all Soco was a great spot to hang with the girls for brunch, grab a drink, and even go on a chill date.  I will be back back Soco because I am still dreaming about the Mac N Cheese."

My friends and I were lucky to be seated right away when we got here maybe around 1 without any resis. The crowd soon piled in after us.

Everything on the menu sounded really good so we all ended up getting different orders to try each other&#39;s food. What we ordered:

Bourbon St Egg Benedict with crab cakes with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce on a toasted mini bagel with a side of a greens salad. The eggs were nicely poached and the crab cakes were tasty with a little kick of spiciness to it. The mini bagels were a nice change up to the standard biscuit. I think it would&#39;ve added a good crispy texture if the crab cakes were fried.

Buttermilk fried chicken with red velvet waffles: this was an interesting twist on the traditional chicken and waffles, but left us a little underwhelmed. The outside of the chicken was crispy but the white meat was for the most part dry. Also while the red velvet waffle was tasty, the texture of it was more like a sponge cake. It&#39;d be more tasty if it was more crisp

Lobster shrimp and grits: spicy tomato broth, country creamy white grits. My friend ordered this and enjoyed it. I&#39;m not a huge fan on grits, but they all liked the texture of it. It also looked like it came with a good amount of shrimp and topped with a decent size of a baby lobster on top

Fish n chips: they&#39;re buttermilk fried catfish with a side of fries. The catfish was tasty and it came with a huge amount of fries!

We also got side order of their mac and cheese which was really good, not too cheesy and also their cornbread which was free with a check-in. It was a lot of hearty food but all for the most part pretty flavorful. I would consider coming again when craving some comforting cajun food!"

So the only choice was to stalk the people at the bar until they left so you could swoop in like a vulture and take their spot before someone else who was waiting tried to. Horrible! This place is tiny! Like everything else in New York. *rolls eyes*

Soco is super cute from the brick interior to the bumping music playing(r&amp;b/soul) it&#39;s dope.

I had the chicken and red velvet waffles and a side of mac n cheese. My cousin got the wings. Now let me tell you about this mac n cheese. Sooooo goood!! Whoever made it, put their whole foot and elbow in it! Bomb! And the red velvet waffles best I&#39;ve ever had! Now to the super dry chicken...y&#39;all need to do better with that.

We arrived before the restaurant opened, which I suggest you do as well as this place gets PACKED. We had a reservation so we were seated immediately(note* your whole party needs to be there to be seated) which was great, especially with the number of people waiting to get in. 

We started with a round of the unlimited mimosas which were very refreshing. They kept our glasses filled consistently. To start our meal, we ordered the mac and cheese. Being from the south, I have a high standard for mac and cheese, and I&#39;m happy to say it was really good here. I&#39;d definitely order it again. For my meal, of course I had to go with the red velvet chicken and waffles. Oh man, oh man, this was good! The waffle had the perfect hint of red velvet flavor without overdoing it. The chicken was also prepared really well. Our waiter and service was awesome as well. I definitely must visit again while in New York!"

I ordered the chicken and waffles and a side order of the okra and tomatoes.  Chicken and waffles were okay.  Nothing to scream about- but good.  The okra was good; barely seasoned but tasty.   We shared the mac &amp; cheese,  the flavorful cheeses popped in your mouth.

The waiter did a wonderful job considering the tips are added to the bill.

I would definitely return to try something different or their menu."

We ordered a number of entr√©e dishes and everything was great although my hashbrowns and toast or room temperature my eggs however was warm and hot. My friend had the strawberry shortcake French toast which to be honest is so good to look at and tasted just as great it was sweet it was savory it was fresh. We also have a hibiscus agave margarita and Asoka sangria which were all great the hibiscus margarita took us to that point really quick so we ended up ordering two more rounds.all in all everything was great service could&#39;ve been a little bit more faster but it&#39;s a Sunday in Brooklyn and everyone is going to brunch so I could understand why service was a little bit slow.

Although it&#39;s on the pricey side, that homemade maple butter that accompanies the corn bread is alone worth the trip. Not to mention the mac &amp; cheese - the best I have had in Brooklyn, hands down. 

I ordered the lobster and shrimp grits dish. I wish the my dish had more spice. I asked for hot sauce - and it was never brought to our table; however, once I noticed that their hot sauce is Frank&#39;s Red Hot, I decided not to remind our server. I need a REAL kick in my food - and that&#39;s the only reason I took off a star. 

A major stand-out was the bbq chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. Spouse ordered this and the sides were excellent - they have a unique Asian flavor and the potatoes were *light* - no inundated butter/cream feel. 

I can&#39;t wait to come back for brunch to have the maple butter - and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll order some food to eat it with."

The waitress was very nice, attentive and prompt. She ensure that our water glasses remained filled and quickly cleared away used plates. Yup, very important to me.  Now the folks who brought out the good, ehhhh not so pleasant. Not sure if it was because it was busy though. 

I had the SoCo sangria which was refreshing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with a red velvet waffle. This was good but did not amaze me. This could be because they were out of everything I wanted, like the pancakes or French toast(that&#39;s why the lost a star from me).  However, the food was fresh and presented well. 

The greatest part of this experience, thanks to Yelp , was my free corn bread on check in ! It was warm, tasty and the honey butter complemented it well.

Now here&#39;s where the gates of heaven opened up on this Friday afternoon! The FOOD!!! I can honestly say I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be as spectacular as it was! It definitely blew my expectations out of the water. First I had the quinoa salad with fried green tomato slices on top! 

This was thee most delicious salad I have ever had! It was perfectly balanced and the tomatoes were not greasy at all! This was the perfect appetizer and got me super excited for the next part of the meal and Soco did not disappoint.   

The chicken and red velvet waffle was literally the most amazing thing I&#39;ve had in a while! The waffle wasn&#39;t overly sweet, it was the perfect companion for the chicken. Now this chicken is fried chicken done right! Seasoned through out, crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside! Did I mention it&#39;s organic?!! I know right! As if it couldn&#39;t get any better!!!

My date found it, and we went in. it wasn&#39;t busy at all, so we were seated right away. The ambiance is great in here.

MUSIC!!! I LOVE IT! whatever playlist they have playing, kudos to who ever compiled it. They had some great R&amp;B song playing. the staff was attentive.

The menu isn&#39;t huge. But the food is good, and very filling.

I had the blackened salmon with sweet potato mash, and cornbread. the cornbread was VERY good. Also the butter that comes with them is sweet, and delicious. I like the fact that they give you an option for tap or bottled water. The macaroni and cheese was very... I think on the dry side. It didn&#39;t taste bad, but I felt it was missing SOMETHING. It was very clear to me that they used parmesan cheese. After adding hot sauce, it tasted better to me.

My date ordered the red velvet chicken and waffles. Let me tell you, This waffle was Delicious! seriously, I could have just eaten that. The chicken, I have tasted better friend chicken, but it was still good. Me personally, I would have appreciated the dish more if the chicken was boneless. 

Our server was very attentive, and helpful. They were happy to see I used yelp to check into their establishment, and I even used a deal and got my cornbread for free (yelping perks, YES!)

My date and I sat for a long time, and didn&#39;t feel rushed to leave. we were left alone after the bill was taken care of.

Emphasis on how much I loved the music! 

I couldn&#39;t even look at the dessert menu because I was sooo full."

I took my mother here for her birthday last night and the experience was okay. but I most likely won&#39;t be coming back. 

we made a reservation for 13 at 7 pm. we arrived at 650 and the table still wasn&#39;t set up. so probably at about 730 the tables were finally finished. but the good thing about that was the hostess( I&#39;m not sure if she was the manager or the owner) kept coming back to check on us. so I thought that was nice of her. the guy who was the greeter at the door was nice and made us feel welcomed. 

then our waiter came (can&#39;t remember his name) he was nice. introduced himself took our orders and never saw him again. bc the party was of 13 he received 20% gratuity. so for a 373 dollars bill he received 74 dollar tip. never came to check on us, refill our water, asked if our food was okay nothing. he came back to give us the check and that was it. he was running past us and to get his attention we had to catch him. the hostess came to check up on us mostly. she should have received our tip. 

okay so let&#39;s talk about the food. I ordered the BBQ chicken that came with mashed potatoes and green beans and a side of Mac and cheese. I enjoyed my food. chicken was juicy, and the food was filled with filled with flavor. the Mac and cheese was good as well. but some one in my party ordered pork chops and they weren&#39;t cook fully through and I was told the mashed sweet potatoes tasted like baby food lol. the collard greens were crunchy which they aren&#39;t supposed to be, the ribs were too tendered that they were chewy. the cornbread was fantastic. it seemed like all the people who ordered the BBQ chicken enjoyed there food. 

so overall it wasn&#39;t the greatest experience. neither was it the worst. but I won&#39;t be coming back."

Our waiter, Bryan, was cool, knowledgable about the menu and composed (he was slammed with tables). He was helpful and added to the atmosphere. I recommend the Madi Gras if you visit the bar. All in all, this was a nice spot, but our experience was ruined when we were rushed out.

After spending a significant amount on food and drinks, my husband and I were told we were only allowed 1 hour for the unlimited mimosas and that we needed to leave immediately  to cater for other customers. 

This information was not shared to us when we originally sat down AND was not advertised on the menu. At bit confused and put off by the delivery, we got up and left reluctantly - before we could finish our last mimosas. 

Dear management if this is in fact your policy -fine, but moving forward you should make this known to ALL customers prior to sitting down.  When questioned about the policy, all management would say was, &#34; We need to make room. &#34; It didn&#39;t matter that our waiter was slammed with a table of more than 10 ppl cutting into our &#34;time&#34;. It didn&#39;t matter that we ordered our last mimosas and had to wait over 15 mins for the drinks to come.

To cut down on miscommunication and turning off potentially regular customers this should be noted on the menu!!! Who ever heard of mimosas only being served for an hour?!?"

When we sat down we ordered Soco Island and the Mardi Gras ( Sooo Good).  We didn&#39;t order appetizers but everything sounded good. For entrees we ordered the chicken &amp; waffles but since I&#39;m not such a red velvet fan I was able to substitute the waffles for mash and collard greens which were amazing and my other friend had the salmon burger which was so good too.

When we got there at 145ish I went straight to the hostess to let her know I had a 2pm reservation for 8, and they told me that I made the reservation for 12pm and it was a no show.  I did call the night before to confirm my reservation, so I DOUBT I made the mistake when I made the reservation AND when I confirmed it, but who knows, right? However; the way she handled the situation was extremely rude.  She gave me attitude and I had to ask her 3 times how long the wait would be because she kept telling me she didn&#39;t know.  As a hostess, you should have an idea how long a wait would be.  I always say, not everyone is cut out for customer service.

Anyway...once we sat down (thankfully we only waited about 25 minutes, the place was PACKED) we were pleased.  The server could have been more attentive, but he was very nice and helpful.  The drinks were tasty and the food was AMAZING!  The mac and cheese was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;m a total mac &amp; cheese girl!

Because they have cancer or maybe a cancer survivor.

Unlimited mimosa is Saturday only! Don&#39;t make the mistake I did by going on a Sunday!

First off- Mac and Cheese is amazing. Everything else was good but didn&#39;t wow me. I ordered the Chicken and waffle, I thought the syrup was too sweet but the chicken was well seasoned and super filling.  Wings were great- I don&#39;t believe they are fried. My date got the crab benedict and it was super salty- wouldn&#39;t recommend that but everything else was pretty tasty.
Drinks were either too strong or too weak- not impressed by them and they were approx. $14 each.
Fun atmosphere for anyone. You can bring a date, friends, parents/family.
Make a reservation. The wait is really long, especially for brunch on the weekends.

We started with the Mac n cheese. It was the best Mac n cheese that I&#39;ve ever had. The top was super crispy. I know how difficult it is to bake a perfect crisp on Mac n cheese, so I must commend SoCo for that. Under the crisp, the interior had a perfect balance of cheesy and gooeyness. The cheese was delicious. I think the cheese was a blend, but I can say for sure; nevertheless, it was delicious and turned out creamy. The macaroni itself was the real deal - not some dingy elbows. The Mac n cheese is very filling; I would have been content simply sharing it without ordering anything else.

For my main course, I had the sausage and grits. I guarantee these grits will convert anyone into a grits lover. They are so rich and creamy. They&#39;re made with a lobster broth which adds a lot of flavor. These were by far the best grits I&#39;ve had. The grits were topped with andouille sausage, eggs, and some micro leaves (I believe cilantro). I had my eggs sunny side up so that the yolk could spill onto the grits. Altogether, it was a wonderfully savory dish.

The service was outstanding. The bartenders here are some of the best I&#39;ve seen. Soco is truly one of Brooklyn&#39;s best restaurants."

Last I came here for my birthday, I just made it by the skin of my teeth, for the final service call for brunch, just before closing mid day and reopening for dinner. I normally went for dinner but boy oh boy, brunch was just as good.

First, I must start off with the macaroni &amp; cheese which might be like the best macaroni &amp; cheese I&#39;ve ever had. It was so cheesy but not a bad cheesy because it wasnt salty or clumpy &amp; it was just smooth and flavorful. And it came out piping hot which I loved. Probably the best dish I ordered that night. I also ordered the salmon &amp; it came with greens and mashed potatoes which was good but I enjoyed the other two dishes that everyone else had. My sister ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with the red velvet waffle, she loved it! The chicken was fried really well and did not lack in flavor. Her friend ordered the smoked BBQ chicken which looked and tasted really good as well. The chicken was tender and juicy and the BBQ sauce was delicious. Last but not least, the cornbread! Oh, I should have ordered some to go home. It was so good. The muffins were warm and yummy and then the butter with it just made everything better. LOVE! 

I definitely enjoyed myself at SoCo, would wanna come back another time and order something else on menu &amp; like 2 orders of cornbread lol &amp; the macaroni &amp; cheese of course."

My sister and I took my mom out to dinner yesterday and so naturally we were splitting the bill only to be told the restaurant does not take cards without the chip. My thing is how can you force someone to have something beyond his/her control? Unfortunately, I am with a well known NYC credit union that has not conformed as yet and it is not right for businesses to discriminate because my card does not have a chip. 

All I ask is that if you are going to be the type of business to reject cards, display your policies clearly. I or anyone for that matter should not have to guess if a card will be accepted all because of a chip."

The atmosphere is amazing, definitely for an younger adult crowd. Music was great, lighting was even better. The restaurant isn&#39;t too small but it isn&#39;t all that big neither. It&#39;s nicely decorated, it looks like you&#39;re somewhere of quality. I liked it.

Everyone was very nice here I loved the greeter at the door and the bartender. Actually I loved all of the staff especially my waiter. Seems like all of the men in there are tall dark and HANDSOME! The women are beautiful too.

I also loved the fact that it seems to be a black owned business which made my heart happy as soon as I found out.

Now let&#39;s get to why I gave this seemingly wonderful place 3 stars.

The menu is pretty small and restricted. They have about 15 different dishes, a few sides, and a few appetizers. There&#39;s really not much of a choice. I chose the chicken and waffles, I didn&#39;t want red velvet waffles but that was the only waffles they made for that meal, RESTRICTED! 

I ordered the red lemonade drink (This one is kind of my fault) the red lemonade had freaking GINGER in it. Yes! I said GINGER! I could&#39;ve definitely done without the ginger in my damn drink. I HATED it. So that was $11 wasted! 

When the waiter took our order he asked if we&#39;d like to split the Mac &amp; cheese of course, I&#39;m black I love Mac &amp; cheese. 

Biggest let down ever! The Mac tasted like it was a microwaved dish. Really bad. 

I didn&#39;t really like the red velvet waffle I think I would&#39;ve been extremely satisfied with a regular waffle. The chicken was ON POINT! 

I definitely won&#39;t be back here again. But I do recommend it to other people because the service is great and I&#39;m pretty there&#39;s other things on the menu that&#39;s good.

If you do go try the Caramel drink. It&#39;s really good!"

It was so packed that they actually had to close the waitlist. We were hungry so we waited 40 mins for someone to leave the bar. When we sat the bartender was so amazing his name was Daniel. He was just very nice and accommodating to us even though it was super busy. I ordered the F-Que wings with the baked Mac n Cheese and it was worth the wait!! I advise splitting the Mac n Cheese because the portion is huge. My cousin ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles but her chicken was dry (so upsetting ). Oh and if you check in on Yelp you get free cornbread so definitely do that ! All in all if it wasn&#39;t for the bartender being so cool and cute the experience wouldn&#39;t have been overrated. I&#39;m from Boston but I&#39;ll definitely be back !

Although it was late in the evening, once we were sat, the service was exquisite. Brian, our waiter handled the floor with finesse. I had the opportunity to indulge in the Branzino, which was an awesome choice! I also nibbled on my some Mac &amp; Cheese that my friend ordered and it really is the best Mac and cheese in Brooklyn. Very cute set up inside. Next time I Will try to come visit for brunch so I can view the courtyard. 

Two thumbs up!"

We arrived on Sunday 6ish and had to wait about 40 mins for a table--the place was packed to the rafters.  Once seated our server was very prompt with taking our orders. We tried the blackened salmon and F-QUE wings and the Mac &amp; cheese.  With a Yelp check in we got a free order of cornbread.  The salmon was fresh and broiled perfectly.  The blend of Cajun spices was nicely balanced and complimented the fish well.  

Portion sizes were healthy especially the Mac &amp; cheese portion.  It came baked into its own mini skillet. One portion could easily serve 2-3 people as a side.  The roux used for the Mac and cheese was flavored with a hint of bay leaf and garlic--nice touch.  The consistency of the sauce was slightly loose which let you enjoy the gooey cheese sauce. Cavatappi pasta is used for the Mac &amp; cheese which is an excellent choice as it holds the sauce much better than regular elbow macaroni. 

The wings were meaty and coated in a peppery sauce.  We were given dipping sauces for the wings but they were so well seasoned we didn&#39;t need them.  For our drinks we tried the hibiscus margarita which was very a refreshing an summery drink.  As mentioned every table was occupied during our visit yet our server was pretty prompt and our wait time for food was not too bad given the wait times.  We did notice the crowd started to thin out around 7:30 so next time we will probably plan to dine later."

The cornbread was nice. The red velvet waffles were stranded and uninspired and the mac and cheese was tasty--but Brooklyn is a long way to go just for good mac and cheese.

Came here for Brunch and enjoyed it. I arrived around noon and the place was already full. By the time I left this place was packed. I did not have to wait for a table but had I arrived 30 minutes later I&#39;m sure that I would have had to wait. I did not have a reservation but having one during those prime hours would be helpful.

I ordered the Red Velvet Waffle with the Buttermilk Chicken. The dish was delicious!!! I like waffles but that is not something that I ever really order at a restaurant. This was the best waffle that I have ever had in my life, definitely memorable. The chicken was delicious as well. I was very impressed with this dish. Since I&#39;m greedy I decided to also order the Mac&#39;n cheese which was very good as well. The mac n&#39; cheese is a big portion and its very very rich so you can share this. Although it was delicious I couldn&#39;t eat too much of it because it was so cheesy and extremely  filling. I also ordered the home fries. The home fries were seasoned well but I would definitely pass on that next time. Last but not least I received the free corn bread for checking in. The corn bread was good as well. We definitely ordered a lot for just 2 people but it was nice to try a few different things. I would highly recommend coming here! I can&#39;t wait to come back!"

I noticed other reviewers were not a fan of the red velvet waffle that comes with the fried chicken because it is &#34;too cakey&#34;; however, I beg to differ. It was the perfect consistency to match the fried chicken that was crispy enough to add texture but not overly fried (like in a deep fryer). The chicken was very juicy and a nice mixture of white &amp; dark meat.

My date had the baked bbq chicken, mashed potatoes and substituted green beans for collard greens. The chicken was SO moist (although that is a weird sounding adjective) and bursting with flavor, while the collard greens reminded me of home-cooked ones (A++). The mashed were standard, nothing to rave or complain about. 

We both enjoyed the hibiscus sweet tea, and my date also had the &#34;BROOKLYN BROWN&#34; drink which contains Hennesey, Cranberry, and Amaretto... TIP: they do not skimp on the liquor, I&#39;m not even sure I tasted any other ingredient. 

The atmosphere was pretty chill, great place to casually dress up! The music was soothing/relaxing and added great ambiance. We sat &#34;out back&#34; which has a glass roof, so it gives you the feel of being outside while being totally covered (thankfully, since it was raining when we went). 

I&#39;d say this is a good place to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, etc. OR - if you just like good old comfort food."

Soco&#39;s portions are huge! Although the chicken &amp; waffles were good, I would recommend sharing this dish as the waffle is heavy, making it difficult to finish by yourself. The chicken wasn&#39;t the best fried chicken I&#39;ve had (it was kind of soggy), but the uniqueness of the waffle made up for the chicken. My friends and I also split the mac &amp; cheese, which was by far the best mac &amp; cheese I&#39;ve had! I&#39;m not even a mac &amp; cheese fan, but I couldn&#39;t stop eating this dish. Crunchy on top, but soft gooey pasta inside. This also looks like a small portion, but even with 3 people, we were struggling to finish this dish as well. 

Make sure you check in for free cornbread - it says 1 piece per entree, but the waiter actually gave us an entire plate of corn bread for our whole table!"

Would have given 5 stars, but my last visit was off-putting. I was seated under an A/C vent and it was ridiculously cold. I normally wouldn&#39;t complain, but it was becoming unbearable. I asked to move, but they couldn&#39;t accommodate due to the size of our party. I was also told that they couldn&#39;t turn the unit down because it gets too hot for the cooks in the kitchen (at least they&#39;re employee-focused). I would have just canceled my order and left, but I had out-of-town guest that with me and I was excited about introducing them to this restaurant. So I stayed and tried to tuff it out. The final straw was when I got ready to leave. The owner/manager who was greeting people at the door, didn&#39;t even bother to tell me to have a nice day or open the door when I exited. Normally, this wouldn&#39;t have been a problem, but he did it for the next 6-7 groups that exited after me. I got the feeling he was upset because I complained about the A/C vent blowing directly on me and he could visible see I was miserable during my entire meal (didn&#39;t finish it and steeped out-side several times to warm up). I spent way too much money in this place to be uncomfortable and not appreciated for my patronage. I really try to support certain businesses, but the customer service aspect has got to be a point of focus. As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve just upset myself while typing this. I&#39;m taking away another star"

But this time (4pm) we were able to be seated as soon as we entered. Could it be the time I arrived? I believe so! 

My server (Aaron) polite and attentive. We ordered our food and waited maybe 30 minutes for it. Everything tasted very good and it was cooked with all the right seasonings. The Salmon tasted amazing, It melted in my mouth! The string beans tasted very good actually, it wasn&#39;t overlooked at all. I&#39;m not a fan of sweet potato so i pushed it to the side but I kinda tasted it a little because it touched my string beans and it wasn&#39;t too bad. I enjoyed the Mac and Cheese but no one can beat Cafeteria when it comes to that. I had no complaints about the food or my experience. 

I sat indoors and it was very cold so I moved to the outdoor seating and it was a little better. I liked the amount of space back there, it wasn&#39;t cramped at all. My server came back there often to check on me and that is a plus for me. I do not like to look for anyone that is suppose to provide a service to me.

Overall I will return and try something different. Who knows what because I love to order the same thing. 

The space is beautiful and clean! The restroom was clean as well."

I&#39;ve always wanted to try chicken and waffles together as everyone seems to love it so what better place than to go to than Soco, which not only has chicken and waffles but has chicken and REDVELVET waffles??!!?! However, my excitement for the red velvet waffles ends now. The presentation was beautiful but honestly the waffles was very meh. It isnt that flavorful and was toooo soft. The chicken was goood but if I&#39;m trying to get chicken and waffle, I would like the waffle to be up to par.

My excitement now returns for the mac and cheese because it was DELICIOUS. I am honestly not the biggest mac and cheese fan (don&#39;t kill me) but I read in the reviews that the mac &amp; cheese is a must have so I decided to try that. Soooo glad I got it or else I would have left Soco pretty unsatisfied. Idk what they put in it but each bite is delicious. If I ever return, I&#39;ll skip the waffle and just go for the mac &amp; cheese!

Our waiter was very attentive and memorized our entire order when we placed it. The food came out in good timing (not long at all, maybe 15-20 minutes). We ordered the pecan crusted pork chops, red velvet waffles with fried chicken and their famous mac &amp; cheese. We also tried the hibiscus agave margarita, ginger root beer and blueberry lemonade.

We did the Yelp check-in and was given a plate of three pieces of complimentary corn bread with butter! :)

Everything was delicious, well-made and very filling. We are glad that we were able to bring back leftovers because we craved it again later that night.

We made reservations for a party of 6 @ 8pm. When we first arrived we checked in with the host and  we let him know that our party was here and asked to be seated. His response was- &#34;You can&#39;t be seated until a majority of your party is here&#34; My response... &#34;It&#39;s a surprise &amp; we are 4 out of 6.....&#34; (Let the awkward stares commence)

So after of few moments of him doing 4th grade math in his head... He then seated us at our table. 

Our dining experience was nothing over the top and not the worst... But the staff is touch &amp; go and do not expect them to be able to attend your need, when it arises. 

Where did the 5 stars come from you ask?!? Well, the food was phenomenal! Everyone in our party had a different entree: jambalaya, BBQ chicken dinner, skirt steak, ny steak, red velvet waffle &amp; fried chicken, and grilled salmon. We also had three sides at the table: mac&amp;ache else, garlic green beans, and dirty rice. YUMMMMMMERS!!! Everyone also enjoyed very potent long islands (sans moi, soda &amp; cran).

The red velvet waffles was not sweet which was a plus. The chicken was crispy, a hint of spicy and didn&#39;t even taste oily like how fried food usually would be.
The F-Que wings came with tzatiki dip but it tastes fine without it.
Mac and cheese!!! I am not even a fan of Mac &amp; cheese but I had to try it. I love the top part and ate most of it.  Since we had leftover, I took it home and my brother ate it the next day. He said &#34;it was good!&#34;

My sister made reservations for last Saturday&#39;s birthday dinner for 8 pm and was told that if all 9 people do not show up by 8..we would lose our spot, be on a waiting list and might be sitting by 10:30 pm. So make sure you get there on time. Everyone had arrived by 7:30 pm and we still had to wait 30 minutes in the front area where few seats were available. The waiting area should have been bigger and we felt bad standing next to two couples sitting and eating up a storm. 

Not bad for having one bad moment, right?

As for the highlights..some of us had the Mardi Gras cocktail with was really good. Why not drink while waiting for a seat, right? In terms of appetizers..we had short rib pizza and the Carolina Shrimp rolls (I&#39;m not a sushi person, but I did enjoy the rolls than the short rib pizza). I had ordered the molasses braised short ribs with broccoli (meat was very tender), wifey had the fried chicken with red velvet waffle (the waffle was sweet enough that she didn&#39;t need to add the syrup and the chicken was well fried  and full of flavor), pops had blackened salmon and a relative had the Herb Marinated Skirt Steak with Saut√©ed Collards, Roasted Potatoes, Chimichurri.

The food is a bit pricey. Good thing that we had ordered appetizers since we would have been hungry after the entrees. Oh yeah..the mac n cheese amount is massive and the cornbread was &#34;ok&#34;. I had better cornbread at another Southern/Creole restaurant. 

All in all..is the food worth the visit....yes. 
Would I go back and try more cocktails...hellz yeah!"

I understand that for a Sunday brunch, everyone is scrambling, but if having a high volume of customers compromises the quality of the food and service, maybe they need to rethink the amount of hands they have in the restaurant.

We were sat at the bar where the bartender was clearly in the weeds. It took awhile to even receive menus.

We ordered the dragonfly shrimp, chicken and waffles, and the short rib hash. The dragonfly shrimp came very quickly after ordered, almost too quickly, indicating to me that the order wasn&#39;t cooked for us and that it was a leftover dish in the kitchen that was accidentally fired and that they were just waiting for someone to order it so they could send it out instead of having to waste it. The dish itself was a fried battered shrimp coated in some sort of mayonnaise based sauce and served on a bed of arugula. The shrimp came and they were very over cooked, just from looking at them. It was a dark brown, verging on burnt. The shrimp inside was also overcooked and tough. Whatever spices or seasoning they could have possibly done right was overshadowed by a residual burnt flavor that lingered long after you had eaten a piece.

The chicken and waffles I was excited about because I had heard quite a few rave reviews, but the chicken was bland, dry, and tasted as if it was not as fresh as it could have been. The waffle itself was undercooked. A very weak waffle with a raw batter center and it mostly tasted of leavening agent. The waffle couldn&#39;t even stand up to the weight of the chicken sitting on it because when the fried chicken was picked up, it left deflated soggy craters where the chicken had been.

Lastly we had the short rib hash which was fine, but just not a good dish. The short rib hash itself didn&#39;t taste fresh. The eggs on top were overcooked. 

When the bartender came to ask us how out food was a second time, I was honest with her and then instead of apologizing, she immediately asked me why I didn&#39;t say something earlier. I understand people get defensive when their own restaurant is criticized, but I felt a little uneasy being scolded for this. It wasn&#39;t my fault or my responsibility to control quality at this restaurant. But per recommendation of the bartender, if something is wrong, I suppose I should say something sooner, so here I am. 

She did take the short hash off the bill, and I do thank for that. 

I wouldn&#39;t go back. Food was underwhelming, nothing tasted fresh, service suffered because of a Sunday brunch rush, on top of that, everything was very overpriced. Also how is the price chicken and waffles $20 and short ribs at $16? The hype about the chicken and waffle dish must have boosted the price, but if you&#39;re going to charge me $20 for one waffle, a drumstick, and two thighs, make sure you&#39;re hitting a home run. Also the soda are priced at $5, which is just ridiculous. I&#39;d rather go to Clinton Hill Cafe  around the corner which offers simple but delicious diner style breakfast options at a price worth the food."

 In terms of food: the lobster shrimp and cheese grits lawwwwwwwwwwd yes! The cornbread was too sweet and not hot enough to melt the pad of butter. The red velvet waffle was yummy. I hope the managers consider a fried fish version of this chicken and waffles dish. Mac and cheese was still legit. And my mom approved of the quality of the maple syrup.

Downside is we had a 30 min estimated wait that was really more like an hour but i think that&#39;s good for a Friday night before valentine&#39;s day. More time to drink :D"

The red velvet waffles contained too much cocoa power, were extremely thick and have the consistency of a dry baked cake. The fried chicken was salty and somewhat undercooked. The service was pretty good because the server was very attentive. And the security at the door was very polite. However, next time, I&#39;ll stay home and cooked."

My friends and I came here to celebrate 2 birthdays in 1 dinner, which meant double the cake... Not only did they deliver the wrong cake, but they also charge a pretty expensive cake fee of $20! 

We ordered probably the most popular dishes here - the red velvet waffle &amp; fried chicken, mac n&#39; cheese, complimentary biscuits when you check in. 
+ The biscuits and mac n&#39; cheese were DELICIOUS and flavorful. Don&#39;t worry about not having enough biscuits because the complimentary is enough for one.
- The red velvet waffle was nothing exceptional

I think I would pass on going to restaurant for when I&#39;m craving soul food.

The food wasn&#39;t mind blowing or even out of the ordinary for me but it was overly expensive at the same time. For those that may be wondering, the chicken in the chicken and waffles dish is not boneless. There is also no sauce except for maybe A1 or BBQ sauce that you can use for the blackened chicken dish. When we had it it was extremely dry and bland. At the same time, this place is a little on the pricey side. I do not recommend this place as you can find other restaurants that serve better quality of food for cheaper. The d√©cor and ambience were nice though..."

I came here for my friends bday brunch (never been here for brunch before). Our waiter&#39;s name was Lawrence (amazing service and he knows his shit!). I ordered the sausage and grits, which I was hesitant about because everyone doesn&#39;t know how to make grits. Lawrence said the grits were amazing and gave his honest opinion on a lot of the options on the menu. The grits were THE BEST GRITS EVER! (Don&#39;t tell my mom she might kill me). The food was delicious and Lawrence kept the mimosas flowing.

I came in for lunch one day on a whim and ordered the fried chicken sandwich. It was divine. They give you a helping on honey on the side if you are into that (which I am) and it really bolsters the flavor to another level. The side salad was also surprisingly flavorful. I&#39;m not entirely sure what was in it, but I was expecting something that was thrown together as an afterthought, but I found myself devouring the entire thing.

The hostes actually came over and said hey I need this table can you guys move to the bar? 0 room at the bar by the way. This is while we were still finishing our drinks after spending $500!

As busy as he was, he did a great job serving us. Service with a smile is what he gave us and we kept busting his chops about his white bright smile lol 

Food:  everything was amazing.
Appetizers- Wings- ehh was ok wouldn&#39;t order it again. A bit dry and wasn&#39;t my fav. 
Mac &amp; Cheese- To die for!!! Must try!!! Don&#39;t leave without trying this!!! Enough to share with 4. Cheese was toasty on top and then you stick your fork &amp; creamy cheesy piece of heaven inside.
*Organic fried chicken w/ red velvet waffles was amazing.  Chicken was sweet and crunchy and savory.  Waffles were good and not too sweet.  The syrup just made it more amazing. 
*Creamy grits- ohhhh creamy it was
*Strawberry shortcake French toast- a bit sweet for me but good.  Nice whipped cream filling inside.

My friends and I arrived at SoCo around 2:15pm on a Saturday and they were pretty packed; understandable (the kitchen closes at 3:30 and reopens at 6 for dinner). The hostess told us the wait will be around 45 min. We asked if that will be enough time to order food or if they will be closing the kitchen, the hostess said it will be fine and that they&#39;ll text us when our table is ready. We went to eat at Pillow Caf√© next door and came back at 3pm. We waited an additional 30 min and didn&#39;t actually sit down until 3:30/3:40. Our table was being set up but we just took a seat at the bar. The host apologized for the wait, thanked us for our patience, and was trying to get us in. Once we sat down at the bar, the bartender told us the kitchen was closed. We were quite upset so we spoke with the host and he said it was fine to put in our orders. They were just going back and forth, the host and the bartender. She was not very happy that she had to serve us. We also DID NOT get our corn bread when we checked in, as promised by this deal on Yelp. 

On to the food. 

It was pretty darn good. 

Creole Gumbo: one of the best gumbos I&#39;ve had. I&#39;m no gumbo expert but this was very flavorful and light. 

Pulled pork hoagie: the pulled pork was not as tender and soft as I thought it would be but the smoky BBQ sauce and pickled vegetables were delicious; complementing flavors. It sort of reminded me of an Americanized Banh Mi. 

Mac &amp; Cheese: personally, it was delicious because it wasn&#39;t ridiculously cheesy. It came in a skillet, crunchy top and rich insides. 

Short Rib Hash: delicious. Very flavorful, sweet and savory flavors all in one. Definitely a heavy meal and will fill you up. 

Service: 1/5. Maybe it was just a hectic day and they usually have good service, but we did have a good experience with those that helped us."

First and foremost its a normal sized resturant so overcrowding is not an issue. But the tables are placed pretty close to each other but I personally do not have a problem with that some might. 

The good about SOCO:

The menu is simple. Southern cuisine and very tasty named drinks ( caramel martini ). 

I had the steak strips. It comes with collard greens and potatoes. A friend order muscles and mac and cheese.( these 2 things are not sold together they are actually from the appetizer side). 

I enjoyed my steak. I dont normally order steak but im glad i did. It was well seasoned and the onions and greens peppers the steak was cooked with was neatly placed on top of the steak. Funny thing i could not find my collard greens (thanks caramel martini) as it was under the steak. 

The mac and cheese was good. I enjoyed it better than what i expected. I think i ate more than my friend did. 

They enjoyed their muscles. It was sitting in a clam sauce which they especially loved. 

Now the bad:

A friend of mine told me to make a reservation but i was already in the place. So it is best to make a reservation as it is a frequent visited place. And the wait time can take upwards to an hour and a half. 

What i also did notice thats not good to me, is after you place your order most places bring bread to the table or breadsticks. Anything to tide you over until the food comes. Soco does not do that. So we had to wait for our food either sipping soda, water or from any alcoholic beverage we may have had. 

Overall my satisfaction was good. And i would recommend them to any friend. And i will come back. With a reservation also."

My book club met there this past Saturday.  The first thing we noticed is that it is a VERY busy restaurant - but I made a reservation and we were seated promptly after checking in - which I liked.

While the restaurant isn&#39;t overly big it is a nice size and it&#39;s very airy which I also liked.  I also enjoyed the music that&#39;s played in the background although one of my book club members thought that the restaurant in general is very loud.

Now onto the food......

First let me say that I am soooooo over brunch.  Most restaurants now only offer a brunch menu on the weekends and it&#39;s pretty much the same menu options at every restaurant.  Can we please bring back the regular menu people?  Ok I&#39;m off my soap box.....I ordered the Skirt Steak and Eggs as did one of my book club members.  We both ordered our steak medium - I asked for eggs over easy and she asked for scrambled hard.  While I have to say the portion size was good, my ENTIRE meal was overcooked!  My steak was very well done, the eggs were closer to fried (no runny yolk), even the home fries were well done.  My girlfriend&#39;s steak was well done as well but at least her eggs were cooked to her liking.  Needless to say I didn&#39;t finish my plate as I was thoroughly disappointed.  One book club member ordered the fried chicken and red velvet waffles and she said that it was ok - nothing more, nothing less.  Another member ordered the sweet potato pancakes and she said that they were very good (even though she had to ask and wait for syrup, shouldn&#39;t that be automatic when ordering pancakes??)  We also saw these delicious pans of mac and cheese coming from the kitchen and decided to order it.  Our waiter told us that one order would only feed two people and since three of us wanted it we ordered two orders which was a mistake because one order is big enough for three people.  Anyway, out comes this delicious looking mac and cheese, the crust is nicely browned and our mouths were watering.  Upon taking the first bite we realized that it had absolutely NO flavor!  It was cheesy to say the least but it didn&#39;t taste like cheese - it didn&#39;t taste like anything.  We couldn&#39;t believe it.  The waiter boxed up both orders and we proceeded to leave it there because none of us liked it.  The bill came out to $35 each (none of us ordered alcoholic drinks) which I felt was a bit pricey for brunch and especially a brunch where I didn&#39;t enjoy my meal.

I&#39;m glad I made the trek to Brooklyn to this restaurant as I rarely go to Brooklyn, but I have to say that I would not visit SoCo again and my book club members felt the same way."

4- Food and Drink 
2-Service

My friend and I came to meet another friend for brunch (but didn&#39;t have a reservation). We arrived put our name in sat at the bar. It was a bit of struggle - the bartender was not the nicest person; we asked for water and she got mad when we didn&#39;t originally think we&#39;d sit there. We had to wait a lot longer for our friend than we planned so we did finally order food from the bar with a big sigh from the bartender. While the chicken and red velvet waffles along with the mimosas I had, the service was enough to make me not want to come. We got quick service with the mimosas but my friend who was only drinking water had to ask multiple times to get more water.

I get we waited at the bar for longer than we thought but we were paying customers - the attitude was a bit much."

My fianc√© brought me here for my birthday and the staff went above and beyond. I have never been treated so amazingly at a restaurant no matter what the occasion. 
It all begin with a special menu printed just for me with Happy Birthday Jessica in the middle. Our waiter was very nice and and attentive. We both started with drinks, I ordered the down east cider (my new favorite) and my fianc√© ordered a beer. For our appetizer we ordered the rolls with duck fat and sea salt. When they put the rolls down on our table you could smell them instantly. I&#39;ve never had duck fat before let alone on rolls and I have clearly been missing out. The rolls tastes just as great as they smelled. Not only did we get rolls but since it was my birthday they brought out a trio of appetizer samples for me and a sample for my fianc√©. On my plate was an unbelievable potato chip, fried oyster and the pork taco. I don&#39;t eat oysters so I gave that to my fianc√© but the potato chip was out of this world and the taco was delicious! For our meal I ordered cacio e pepe and my fianc√© got the ultimate udon. Just like the appetizers the meals were fabulous. I was really excited to try the red pepper fettuccine, and now I am hooked. I wish I could buy those noodles they were so good and unique. My fianc√© was in heaven with his udon and was so happy with his choice. Between dinner and dessert they brought out a little taste of a watermelon raspberry drink that I wish I could buy it was so refreshing. For dessert we ordered the chocolate torte. This was probably our least favorite thing because it was just so rich and thick, yet delicious. They also sent out the dulce de leche cheesecake for my birthday and that was fantastic. I usually don&#39;t like dulce de leche but this was outstanding. To top it off after the meal they brought us a little goodie bag with some cookies with personalized stickers that said happy birthday Jessica. 

In my opinion, everyone needs to come here. I have never felt so special and appreciated at a restaurant before. This is definitely the best place to have a celebratory dinner. They truly go above and beyond here, thank you!"

We arrived for a 9:30 reservation and the place was quite empty, a bit of a warning sign for NYC. Since it was a bit late, the wife and I decided to order apps and share. 

The first 2 to come out were the veal meatballs and the poached pear salad. The meatballs were good, but a bit cold. Very saucy and would have been better with bread, which we ordered, but it didn&#39;t arrive. The salad was missing some acidity for balance, just tasted a bit bland. Other than that it was good.  

Next we got the burrata and mushrooms, the steak tartare, and the broccoli rabe.  The burrata was an awkward overly salty dish that needed bread. Honestly I&#39;ve never seen a burrata dish without bread. It was more like a mushroom and burrata stew. To quote my wife &#34;they ruined burrata for me&#34;. 

The steak tartare was mixed with beets and served with parmesan crisps. Ratios were way off, not nearly enough crisps. It was ok otherwise.  The broccoli was over seasoned - way too salty, we didn&#39;t eat it. 

Then finally the duck fat rolls arrived. What do I eat this with now?

We skipped dessert with disappointment. The service was a bit awkward too. We left feeling the price was off the mark for the experience. Honestly wouldn&#39;t go back, or recommend it to friends."

My wife &#34;won&#34; some plane tickets, and the catch was that we had to sit through a two-hour sales pitch about some awful scam. I warned her that this was not a victory in any way, but after it was clear she wasn&#39;t giving it up, I insisted we at least go to Vitae for dinner afterward (since it was nearby) to salvage what was sure to be an awful evening. Please believe me when I tell you that dinner at Vitae is the only good thing that has ever come out of a timeshare presentation. 

A Short List Of Things That Are Great After Timeshare Presentations:

1. Alcohol. I got a Vesper, because liquor mixed with more liquor was necessary.
2. Vitae&#39;s beet-heavy steak tartare.
3. Vitae&#39;s light and balanced hamachi crudo.
4. Vitae&#39;s hearty pulled pork tacos.
5. Vitae&#39;s impeccable service. Not only was everyone swift and accommodating in all things, but they also shower you with gifts from the kitchen (and you know I love the lagniappe). We started with an amuse bouche of a nice crisp, we were given a pastry and a delightfully palate cleansing drink in a tiny glass bottle with our check, and then we were literally chased down the street with complimentary cookies...after we had already been given complimentary cookies by two other staff members.

I must admit that I was a bit disappointed in the cacio e pepe. Although the red pepper-infusion gave the pasta a gorgeous color, the dish was lacking (especially at this price point). I realize the beauty of cacio e pepe is in its simplicity, but the flavor wasn&#39;t there and $28 is too much to pay for bland noodles. If they hadn&#39;t been out of the chestnut agnolotti it might&#39;ve been a different story, but we probably should&#39;ve rolled with the summer risotto. 

Ah well, there&#39;s always next time."

I was correct. Have horned his skills at Gramercy Tavern, and later the French Laundry, Edwin must have possessed some unique cooking techniques.

I cannot wait but to bring my co-worker from Hong Kong here, and we opted for the tasting menu. Though claimed as four courses, we were more than stuffed even after the pasta part. Of course, my favorite out of all dishes was the Long Island duck, the sour cranberry sauce was perfectly marinated inside the duck meat that balanced out the savory; not to mention the grilled brussel sprouts. Another highlight of the night was the palate cleanser - made from ginger juice yet not at all overwhelming, kind of like drinking soda.

Hmm how should I summarize my meal? The whole tasting experience was fine with no doubt; nevertheless I felt like this place was a bit lack of characteristic. Sure I have tried many decent courses, yet how to make each single one of them stand out remain a challenge."

They offer great food and drinks with a very trendy ambiance and yet because they&#39;re still not quite as famous yet, you can easily score a table or a seat at the bar when many other Italian establishments in the city are fully booked to capacity.

I started off with their burruta. It was very fresh, and milky creamy, surrounded by diced cherry tomatoes in a green sauce. it was light and refreshing, perfect for summer.

I then ordered the full plate version of their Cacio E Pepe. They offer both a small plate for $18 and the full plate for $28, and while I normally save, tonight I was starving so I had the full plate. If you&#39;ve never had cacio e pepe, its essentially similar to a Carbonara pasta except they usually don&#39;t include an egg yolk in the cacio e pepe, its a very simple but delicious pasta with just pepper, pecorino and parmesan cheeses emusified in olive oil to create a really creamy sauce. The version they offer here at Vitae was just superb. 

For dessert I ordered the white chocolate ricotta cheesecake a la mode. The cheesecake was decorated with chocolate pearls, whipped cream and seasonal fresh cherries. What sets this place apart is that they lightly warm up the cheesecake in the oven to give it an even more intense flavor. For the gelato, I had a trio of 2 vanilla scoops and 1 chocolate chip scoop. Very creamy and decadent.

To end the night I ordered a warm frothy cup of Cappuccino."

Being the &#34;Beets. Bears. Battlestar Galactica&#34; person that I am, I had to order the roasted beet appetizer. It came with giant chunks of red, yellow, and pink beets - combined with the generous dollops of goat cheese and pistachio, it actually stuffed me quite good.

I had read great reviews on Yelp and loved the modern decor of the restaurant, as well as the eclectic menu.

Our meal began with a sampling of a potato chip with a sour cream and chive sauce. It was a great presentation and had even better flavor! We ordered the duck fat rolls, fried oysters, veal meatballs and the pork steamed buns for appetizers. I do not have a bad review about any of these choices! My favorite were the pork buns. They had a spicy and tangy sauce that truly made them delicious.

For dinner, I selected the lamb loin. It came with a sweet potato pur√©e and heirloom tomato reduction. The lamb was cooked perfectly and so tender. Two other members of our party chose the ground lamb pasta, while two others chose the duck confit. The lamb pasta was the favorite of all! It was truly delicious. Everyone greatly enjoyed their meals!

Two points to those that get the Latin reference there.

Anywhoo. After Tommy Bahama was packed to the seams, came here with a work colleague to catch up. There aren&#39;t tons of options in central midtown, but I remembered coming here for lunch and it was nice. It was busy here too for a Wednesday night, or maybe Wednesday is the unspoken &#34;hang out with work peeps&#34; night and I missed the memo.

The hostesses were pretty nice. Despite the fact that we didn&#39;t have a reservation, they assured us that the two businessmen at the bar would be leaving soon and we could take their seats. 15 min later we were still waiting even though there was one empty chair and one chair full of coats from a group of girls who were waiting to be seated. Rather than ask the group if they would like their coats checked and giving us the seats, the hostess asked us to wait. Ten more minutes go by and we are seated. She apologized and we kept it moving.

From there things were splendid. Our bartender/server had all the Cs: cute, courteous and chop-chop service (totally just made that up but it works). He remembered my allergy from the one time I had come here months ago! We ordered sparkling rose, two appetizers, two entr√©es.

My dishes were great. Tuna crudo was cut very thin and the hijiki provided a nice contrast to the mellow flavors. I got the lamb sausage cavatelli which was creamy goodness with a hint of spice. My friend enjoyed her pulled pork tacos and agnolotti. We scarfed down those naughty duck fat rolls too. 

And to top it off, they gave us the cutest lil coke-bottle palate cleansers!

For entrees, we split the cavatelli, scallops, and duck breast. The scallops were extremely fresh and the tasty (although a fairly pricey entree), and the cavatelli was also pretty tasty and freshly made as well.

The entire staff whom we encountered were all fantastic; front of the house, the bartenders, Molly and her manager Liz (Elizabeth) were friendly, courteous, polite and warm, while providing attentive service. A+

We chose the chef&#39;s tasting option, which was a wise choice (please see my camera phone pictures). We were not sorry, except that it proved TOO MUCH food for us. I put my ego aside and waived the white flag. That homemade bread with duck fat? You had me at hello. That duck dish. Oh lord. Foodgasm in mah mouth. Some of the amuse bouche were &#34;redonkulous&#34;: rich bites of umami heaven. Too much to recollect now, but our chef&#39;s tasting was topped off with decadent desserts. 

Molly and Liz were our servers and they answered all of our questions and made sure the wine kept flowing... IN VINO VERITAS? Indeed. Let&#39;s wine, dine, laugh and create new beautiful memories for the rest of our lives.

Thank you ladies for a great time. Molly, we can continue our debate on which Justin Bieber song is best suited for dancing. Also, if I miss you, good luck to you and your husband on your future endeavors. Something tells me Vitae will lose one of its MVP employees very soon. *groan*

Dearest &#34;Lizzie&#34; if you continue to sweet talk me (even with my wife right beside me) with your Korean vocabulary the next time I return, I will have no choice but to kidnap you and introduce you to my family. You have been warned.

We decided to start implementing date nights into our busy schedules, and we thought Vitae would be a good place to start. Service was good as everyone else mentioned. Waiter was very attentive and even fixed the positioning of our plates. Decor was also very nice.

My bf was a tad bit late finding parking in the area. I saw the hostess in the front giving out cookies as patrons left the restaurant. So naturally.. i expected a cookie after dining at Vitae.. but did not get one. Bummer :(

Also, everyone mentioned the complimentary palate cleansers at the end of the meal. Nope..once again disappointed. They are now on the menu for $8 :(

Waiter did give us a shot of watermelon gazpacho - on the house. Nothing special...but was nice to be offered something complimentary. Ordered the burrata ($18) and pulled pork tacos ($18). Burrata was very good but my bf didnt care for it and basically let me lick the plate clean. The pulled pork tacos were very cute and tiny and was the only thing that we ordered that night that had flavor.

For entrees - I got the lamb sausage cavatelli ($28). Im all for al dente pasta..but the cavatelli was not cooked. In retrospect, i should have sent it back to the kitchen. It was so hard and kinda hard to swallow (Woah that sounds so wrong. :] ). On top of the pasta not being cooked properly, there were no burst of flavors..just meh and bland.I made my bf finish the plate. Def not worth the $28.

Bf got the duck ($36)... usually duck is aggressively seasoned at other restaurants but it was under-seasoned at Vitae. It&#39;s so strange because i normally complain about restaurants foods being too salty. First time in a while where i thought something was truly under-seasoned. Maybe the kitchen was having a really off day. Maybe next time...if there is a next time.. Most probably not... we&#39;ll just order appetizers..

Got the nutella chocolate cake for dessert, hoping that something sweet would mask the disappointment of flavors we&#39;ve experienced throughout dinner. Wah.

The food was good for what it is, but seemed a bit overpriced. Apps ~18 (very tiny), and entrees around ~$40. While the food tasted great, I just did not feel like the value was great for the experience.

In addition, our table was attached to the wall, and inside of it something was vibrating - perhaps the AC unit. All of our food and drinks were vibrating throughout the entire experience. If I may suggest, a table that can be pushed away from the wall might be a better solution here.

Food: the chef certainly knows what he is doing and he has built a pretty interesting menu. There were a few of us there. Appetizers included the beef in sticky buns which were awesome, the tacos which were also awesome, the veal meatballs which were fine, but not even in the same ballpark as the veal meatballs from Osteria via di stato in Chicago, and the raw octopus which was surprisingly refreshing, delicate and tasty. Entrees included the seasonal risotto, the scallops and the salmon. No complaints anywhere. I had the risotto which was served with shrimp. It was good. I might even get it again, but it didn&#39;t blow me away.

Service: pretty good, but could have been more crisp. Had to wait a little for water refills and one of the apps was very late. But our server was polite and appeared clean.

Atmosphere: kind of hip, but professional, clean, pretty open, comfortable, maybe a little loud, but it worked fine for me.

Misc: pretty good menu. They had some crazy udon dish that I would have like to try or see. The apps were legit. Plenty more I would try.

We ordered the four course tasting menu and right off the bat, the waiter asked if I had anything particular in mind that I&#39;d like to try. I mentioned pasta and throughout my four courses, I always got a little something extra that was pasta-related. The food was very tasty and well-done.

We were a group of 7 adults and one small child. The staff was incredibly accommodating to everyone&#39;s needs throughout the meal. And yes, the classy interior impresses. 

To start, I had an old fashioned, which was sweeter than most but still very good, and made with high-quality ingredients. We also ordered a number of appetizers, two of which I tried:

-Rolls brushed with duck fat: Good, and the duck fat was a nice alternative to your usual butter or oil, but I don&#39;t know that it did all that much for me.

-Pulled pork tacos (polenta tuille, tomato marmalade, avocado mousse, lime creme fraiche): Good but smallish. 

My favorite part of the meal was my main dish, the chestnut agnolotti. From the cheesy chestnut filling to the prosciutto parmesan broth, each bite was a gift.  The crispy prosciutto on top added a nice umami flavor contrast to each agnolotto.

Once seated.. the waiter gave us some time to look over the menu, but once he came over to take what we assumed would be our drink orders, he asked us right away about our entree orders. When one of us asked if there were any daily specials (the menu was much different from what we previewed on the website), the waiter replied with a &#34;everything on the menu is good, just pick something.&#34;  

After our meal, we asked for the check. The waiter leaves the check on the table then comes back not even 30 seconds later assuming we already left cash/credit card... god forbid we had the audacity to finish our conversation and let our food digest somewhat.

All these are part of a plethora of clumsily designed menu items.

As far as service, their rough around the edges, abrupt &#34;burger joint&#34; waitress on their upper level &#34;dining  room&#34; was a little bit overwhelmed, oozing out nervousness to her surroundings. 
Thru the evening, her lack of grace and poise with a slight sarcastic rude attitude and  manners, were unfortunately in full display to notice. 

At the price point they charge, you are bound to expect the waitstaff to be more polished and fluent in dining room etiquette and well versed in service protocol, but sadly it wasn&#39;t her case.

Decor and ambience are Austin Powers inspired, with some blasting 60&#39;s / 70&#39;s tolerable music, a bar with a very narrow passage, main crowded noisy ground floor and a smaller claustrophobic mezzanine upstairs furnished with well designed wooden armchairs and matching tables, but the latters topped with questionable greasy place-mats.

Burrata ($16): Wild mushrooms, polenta, garlic chips, parmesan. The burrata itself was creamy and delicious, but I loved the combination with polenta. Although both are creamy, the polenta added a different texture. Plus, it was nice with the crispy garlic chips and mushrooms.

Tuna and Hamachi Crudo ($20): Hijiki seaweed, Holland chile, sea beans, and Sriracha vinaigrette. This was definitely one of the best crudo dishes I&#39;ve had. Besides the fact that it&#39;s really, really beautiful, I was blown away by the flavors. The fish were fantastic, too.

Our waitress, though, then took 15 min (no exaggeration) to take our drink orders, at which time we felt it necessary to put in our entire order lest we lose her attention for another 15.  Got 1 of our apps before our drinks.  Every other request felt like a battle from there, from additional drinks to desert to the check.  She seemed completely overwhelmed. 

That all said, food was excellent.  In fact the scallop and lamb entrees were outstanding.  Octopus appetizer solid, but not as impressive.  Bread good too.  Wish we could have tried more apps!

Perfect for a business lunch or dinner, maybe having dinner with parents if they&#39;re okay with a buzzing, loud NYC scene.  Maybe a special occasion dinner if you&#39;re looking to stay in the mid town area."

Started with Appetizers:
Tuna and hamachi crudo was basically 3 ultra thin slices of still partly frozen and watery fish. Since it was watery and frozen, Not allowing the flavored to come through, if there was flavor.  This was disappointing. 
The Buratta was a little grainy, Costcos is better! We would have appreciated some crusty fresh bread to accompany the cheese.
Dinner was so very disappointing, as was dessert. 
Upside: The wine was good!
Maybe they lost their chef, I don&#39;t know, but we won&#39;t be back.

Service - perfect. There when you needed him and not when you didn&#39;t. Water glasses always full. We shared that we were going to a show and he made sure we were right on schedule.

Burrata and salad to start were both great. The salad was perfectly dressed and the burrata was perfectly creamy.

We had the crab and Arctic char for your entrees. Both were flavorful and cooked to perfection.

On the way out our server handed us chocolate chip cookies for the show.

The menu here is nice and it&#39;s not overwhelming by any means.  Overall the food left a bit to be desired, though the presentation was stunning.  One of our friends was a vegetarian and they promised to make her something &#34;special&#39;, but she ultimately ended up getting a massive plate of warm vegetables (not even kidding when I say massive).

Of course our meals, cocktails, and wine were all delicious. The cod was light and fluffy and the scallops were cooked in a delicious curry sauce.

The food was 4/5 stars, but the service put this experience over the top. 

Not only did 5 different people wish us a happy anniversary but they customized our menus and had a private table reserved with our names on it. It was a fantastic touch.

Then they started us out with a mini trio of appetizers on the house including a superb pork braised taco that cleaned the palate just right. 

Following our meal as we expected to depart, we were surprised with two glowing glasses of high quality prosecco and a stunning berry cobbler dessert on the house.

Many things that I wanted to try by the previous posts were no longer on the menu. But that means they are constantly changing menus, creating new dishes, and that&#39;s a good thing ( drinks and food). I asked about a strawberry cocktail that someone posted a few months ago and the server told me that the strawberry is not in season so they have raspberry drinks instead.

I had Crystal Green (a gin cocktail) and I loved it! 

For appetizer, we had the pork belly and the borrata. Wonderful! But I was full after them. So I would recom ordering only one appetizer to share if two girls are going for dinner. Plus they gave you a small sample taste( a little spoon for each person) and I loved it!
I had small portion risotto for entree but I was already full so I took home the rest. But it was really good and creamy. I think the duck was a little overcooked, not in the way that it&#39;s dry, but rather too soft, so it lost the chewy part of duck meat.

Ambiance: very new contemporary low lighting place. I like it although I&#39;ve only ever sat at the booth area at the front. Be warned the booth area at the front has 3 booths that are big and cute that can Fir 4 people however it is manned by the bartender meaning service is much slower cause your bartender is busy serving drinks for the bar AND the dining area at the back. A lot of my beef is with the slow service because they seem to forget the booth people cause our only waiter is the bartender 

Service: twice I came here, twice the hostess was missing. It was like a game of where&#39;s Waldo when it came to finding the hostess. We just stood there with annoyed looks on our faces until someone came. No Bueno. and on service like I said above if you sat at the booths your waiter is the bartender and it is slow. However, they are good with their service. They apologize and give you your drink free if they forget it... Which they almost always do, a few times we had to walk up to the bar and ask where our drinks were. They are extremely nice though, so I have to give them that. Also the first time we went we got cookies... The second time we went we got no cookies..so I have to say service is a hit or miss here, it&#39;s consistent I&#39;m having non consistent service if you know what I mean? Bad service for 10 mins good service for another 10 mins, bad good bad good... 

Food: now here is why although service sometimes lack, they get high high marks for their food. Their food is A+++.
Duck fat rolls you get before you start will already start playing games with your pants waist line. It&#39;s literally bread rolls washed in duck fat. Yes. Try not to eat all of it even though it&#39;s tempting because they actually have good food.


- Their fried/pan seared foie gras changes every time we come but it&#39;s still good. Whether it comes in a croquette or a whole pan seared pate it is DELICIOUS. I came here the first time and they had the pan seared foie gras and I came the second time looking for it but it wasn&#39;t there And they had the fried croquettes instead, I liked both but preferred the pan seared one. If I craze foie gras this is my go to place 

- their take on ramen is delicious, it has a HUGE poached egg with pork belly, dumplings and some sort of steak meat. Delicious, tons of flavor 

- the cacio e Pepe is TO DIE FOR. It&#39;s not the traditional cacio e Pepe so don&#39;t come here looking for that... But TRUST me when I say try this comfort so bad it&#39;s good for you creamy goodness. It tastes like it was washed in egg yolk and cream and tons of pepper. Delicious 

- cod with seafood broth -- soft flaky cod with seafood broth at the bottom, hard to fault this one. A seafood lover will agree 

-- duck dish , the duck is cooked perfectly with a crisp skin. It comes with bacon... Mmmm it&#39;s delicious 

--polenta side dish. Yummy creamy goodness if you are looking for a heavy side, this is it. I love polenta so this is a plus

Overall great great food. Would be 5* if it weren&#39;t for their inconsistent consistent service. Stick your hostess at the front like most restaurants do, don&#39;t let your guests look for them, and make sure the waiters are attentive to your guests.. Don&#39;t make them LOOK for the waiter either and make them forget you. If your guests have a where the heck is my waiter look... Make sure to find their waiter or bartender (in our case) and get them to check on you.

If it weren&#39;t for your meddling delicious food Vitae I could&#39;ve gotten away less than 4 stars but I just can&#39;t cause your food is amazinggggg!!!"

The service was excellent. Jason was so friendly and they were very accommodating to our special requests.

We also ordered the pork belly ($18) that everyone raved about but we felt it was just ok. It doesn&#39;t compare to the pork belly we had in Chicago at &#34;Two&#34; which now sets the gold standard. 

My hubby wanted to try the trout ($30) and since he is not a potato guy, we were able to sub the Yukon gold potato with the brussels sprouts and bacon. This dish was amazing!! I ordered a half serving of the butternut squash risotto ($16) which was rich and delicious. I also ordered a nice glass of red wine to go with my meal.

The food: Everything was phenomenal and creative. We had the octopus and burratta to start, and I had the shrimp risotto, others had a few of the other pastas and scallops. The food was fantastic. The dinner portions were pretty good and the appetizers were small. The bread with the duck confit was amazing.

The dessert: Meh. It was not even close to the best dessert I&#39;ve ever had. We had the pana cotta, the cookie peanut butter bar and the affogatto. All pretty good, but not amazing at all. I&#39;d expect more in that department from a place like this. 

Also, my boyfriend called a few days before our reservation to give his payment info so that they could run his card to pay for dinner before they brought the check, since we were with a large group and he wanted to arrange to pay for dinner prior to the check coming, he gave the hostess or manager his CC info and was told it would be taken care of and they&#39;d just bring the transaction receipt for him to sign after dinner. Well, they brought the check and he told the waiter that he&#39;d already called to give his info to pay, etc. and no one could seem to find it, which was frustrating and worrisome because it might be sitting around somewhere and it kind of ruined the plan to not have everyone trying to pay when we wanted to take care of dinner.

Upon checking in with the hostess, I was immediately presented with a white rose.  Who doesnt like to get flowers???

So I thought this would be a great spot for dinner with my gf. 

We arrived and were seated immediately. They brought is out some delicious duck fat rolls while we waited. Buttery and delicious. Those things were amazing. We ordered a burrata appetizer, pork belly, and lamb meatball slider for our apps. I wish I would have known the portions were so huge bc we were stuffed before our entrees hit the table. The pork belly and burrata were our favorites. The burrata was soooo delicious and the pork belly was crispy and perfectly cooked. 

Next were the entrees. We ordered the tagliatelle and the duck breast entree. Both were out of this world delicious. The duck was perfectly cooked and some of the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. And the pasta was perfect. Couldn&#39;t have asked for better food. 

So all this sounds great but my hold up was the service. I didn&#39;t feel like the service matched up with the quality of the food. Our server was very nice but by no means was the staff super professional. I saw them (not our server) with their phones out on multiple occasions. It&#39;s like cmon dude at least go in the back where nobody can see you. The vibe of the restaurant didn&#39;t match the food. Although the food was very very good I don&#39;t think I would come back based on that type of service. Sorry but I&#39;m giving it four stars bc the food blew me away!"

Both of us were dressed reasonably casually and had no reservation, so to a degree I understand, but I think this may have had something to do with us being sat at what looked like a spare table. No need because the place was only a bit more than half full when we were leaving. Decent enough service, nice wine, food good but not amazing. The buratta, which is a favorite if mine, could have had more flavor. Check dropped to table, without being asked for. I work in the same industry, total no-no to me personally."

The food was all great and so was the service, the emptiness was so disproportionate to the quality of the restaurant. I guess the location might be tricky? Anyway, we started with the tuna and hamachi crudo, and the pork belly. These were both amazing in presentation and in taste. The pork belly was paired with apples, and the acidity cut the fat perfectly. I gotta be honest I don&#39;t remember what we got as entrees but I&#39;m pretty sure they were both pastas.

We ordered the bread, which I wouldn&#39;t do again, because it is too rich with the duck fat.  We enjoyed the meatballs and the pork schnitzel was average.  We also ordered the squash pasta which was so bad we each had only one bite yet they left it on the bill for $26.

We started with the pulled pork tacos (5 in an appetizer serving) and tuna and hamachi crudo. Both were excellent - and had been recommended by our waiter. My daughter had the pork schnitzel, which looked to be battered and deep-fried and was delicious; I had the red pepper fettucini (made in-house) with a carbonara-like sauce, also delicious.

Before our initial course arrived, we were treated to an amuse-bouche of a potato chip with cr√®me fraiche and crispy prosciutto. It was basically an upscale potato chip but tasty nonetheless. We then both started with the roasted baby beets which came served over a bed of arugula and were served with goat cheese and pistachios. The dish was beautifully presented and we both happily cleaned our plates. For our second courses, I ordered the steak salad and my friend ordered the seafood crepe. The steak salad consisted of a delicious medium rare steak served on a bed of greens, avocado, tomatoes, parmesan and crispy frizzled onions. It looked small at first but was very compact and I barely finished it. The seafood crepe was a tight parcel filled with seafood and topped with a lightly creamy sauce and my friend cleaned his plate, so I can only assume it was delicious. We both finished our meal with the rhubarb crumble, having being convinced by our server that because it was in season it was the natural choice. It was served with a scoop of mouthwatering scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top and even being a disliker of fruit, such as I am, was absolute perfection. Our server was right.

The service was not at all what I expected for the price, reputation and Yelp score. Our server was a lunk; zero personality, energy and did very little to make us feel at home. He did a horrible job of walking us through the menu, answering questions, etc. 

We both got the Chefs Tasting Menu and I must admit, the food was very good. Everything was cooked wonderfully, seasoned beautifully and plated to the level you&#39;d expect. 

That said, you&#39;re paying for the service and atmosphere as well and that&#39;s what Vitae was lacking during our visit. I think the check was around $350, not crazy but you can do much better for the price in NY.

My wife and went here for dinner on Sunday evening after getting a drink at the Campbell Apartment after reading the positive reviews. We went inside and were immediately greeted and coat checked. Then, we were taken to a table upstairs and seated. Soon after, we met our server and were asked if we would like any drinks and what type of water we preferred. After that, we were left to peruse the menu and figure out what to order.

This is where our server started to show his...lack of expediency. The rest of the staff that did the busing and delivery of the food were quick and attentive, but our server seemed focused on the table next to us with three girls dressed for a night out. Thus, it took a while for us to have our order taken. It took a while for us to get our check. And so on.  Here is what we ordered, though:

Burrata - Creamy and rich with a great taste of wild mushrooms. This was a great starter.

Brussels Sprouts - Awesome. Very savory and toasty. Excellently prepared with a wonderful texture.

Foie Gras - This was tricky. There were so many extreme flavors and textures on the plate that it took finding the right combination to appreciate the dish. The sweet flavors tended to overwhelm, but the crispy kale was a nice touch.

Beef Tenderloin - Not amazing, but good. Asked for medium-rare and got more rare than desired. Also, the beef itself was not super flavorful, but the accompanying veggies and sauce helped.

The decor was trendy and modern; the atmosphere was vibrant and energized. Honestly, it was a nice meal even though we didn&#39;t enjoy every dish or our server. It is a bit pricey, too."

For the entrees, we ordered the cod, beef tenderloin, duck, and lamb. We enjoyed our meal immensely. However, I.thought the duck was a bit too salty. Lamb however, was perfect. Food was very fresh and the fusion of flavors made for an interesting meal.

A little on the pricey side and I honestly had higher expectations based on reviews. The ambience and decor is creative and modern. The space is a little narrow and tight giving a lounge feel which i was fine with.

We tried the octopus and foie gras as appetizers. Foie gras was very flavorful and tender and the octopus was presented very nicely. The mango salsa added a nice taste on your palette but beware that this is a COLD dish (we thought it was going to be hot).

As for the food we ordered the lamb loin and only received 4 little pieces of lamb for ~$45!! I think that this was overpriced and if I had known the portion was so small, I would&#39;ve swapped it out for the duck breast. I have to say it was well cooked but lukewarm and quality meat. But not for the price.

Scallops were reasonable. The curry sauce they came in was light and not too overbearing and they were cooked and seared perfectly.

Service was excellent and attentive but towards the end of our meal the attentiveness kind of trailed off as we waited over ten minutes for our check. Very slow for a Saturday night. Food was above average but not exceptional, don&#39;t think I would give it another go."

Great steak and pulled pork tacos.

The restaurant filled up quickly so I would recommend a reservation.

The servers and bartender are doing a great job of making everyone feel welcome. Environment is great place for date, mingle, hangouts and celebrations. Five stars for those...

For the foods, we got the pork belly, duck breast, whole trout, fries, brussel sprouts, and chocolate cheesecake for dessert. Everything was good but the trout was the problem...it was over cooked and lost it freshness flavor...I am very picky when eat fishes, it is my favorite food of all...I didn&#39;t send it back because I dislike wasting food...and another thing is the brussel sprouts order was missing til we finished the entrees... other than that this is a great spot for gathering!"

Another worker even told the bartender i was there and he still didnt turn around. I asked the host a question again, and he directed me to the bartender, where i waited for several more minutes with zero service so i left. 

The ambiance is trendy but they clearly give zero f&#39;s about paying patrons. Menu looked average and over priced anyways."

Yup, my arteries are crying, but I ignore their silent pleas because these rolls are just that damn good. Cooked in duck fat, seasoned with the perfect amount of salt, soft to the point they melt in your mouth. Never a disappointment.

This place is great for lunch or dinner. A good coworker of mine introduced me to Vitae and we frequent the place for lunch. I&#39;ve been dying to bring my boyfriend here for a meal on the weekend as well and even wanted to come here for Valentine&#39;s Day this year! But alas, due to having my wisdom teeth removed, I couldn&#39;t justify such a nice meal where I could only half chew and mostly swallow my food.

The entire decor of the restaurant is beautiful. It&#39;s classy, but I&#39;ve never felt judged walking in wearing Toms and some simple t-shirt. The place has extremely high ceilings and is very well-lit. The bar is to the right when you walk in and the bartenders are all extremely friendly. The staff in general are all just superb.

For lunch appetizers, I&#39;ve tried the crispy pork belly and the pulled pork tacos. I could rave about the crispy pork belly all day. I never thought a non-Asian restaurant could make pork belly so well. It melts in your mouth. It&#39;s so flavorful. It&#39;s perfection. The tacos were also very good!

I&#39;ve had the grilled chicken entree (dellicious, succulent chicken with awesome vinaigrette) and the maltagliati. I&#39;m not normally a fan of lamb, but the lamb sausage is quite tasty.

This is a place where I literally just want to try every item on the menu. They put a lot of effort into the presentation of the dishes and honestly everything is just so superb. Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots in Manhattan when I&#39;m feeling like a nice meal."

Sadly its getting well known now and is harder to get into because it is so good! The bread alone is enough for 5 stars as its covered in salt and duck fat, fresh out the oven. I could have it for appetizer, entree and desert!

I usually get a table full of apps to share as the main meal because you can&#39;t go wrong with any of them and its hard to choose! My favorites are the veal ricotta sliders and the crispy pork belly. If there was a weakness on the menu I&#39;d say its the pasta&#39;s but the menu changes seasonally so there&#39;s plenty to choose from.

It doesn&#39;t get better than this, go there ASAP!"

I had the ramen with the duck breast (first one on the menu) and the lava bao as dessert. I cannot even describe them.... Just do yourself a favor and check this place out!

Noted and bookmarked for lunch later that day. I walk in and they&#39;re really just opening for the day, perfect I think to myself, I had a choice where I wanted to sit and didn&#39;t realize they had outdoor seating available to mid way through my lunch. (more on this later).

Baoburg is very small and seating can get tight when at capacity, artfully decorated, serving cocktails and nice potential for a random night out with a friend or two for their outdoor dining area. 

The Staff here and management you really need to pay attention to this, is bordering on can barely speak loud enough for the customer to understand, can barely understand a customer&#39;s inquiry and lacks good customer service / waitress skills. 

1. I walk in and ask if Baoburg is serving Ramen Soup? Waitress Yes we are, what do you want? I would like to have a seat for starters. The girl behind the counter is talking to another staff member now and completely ignores me. 3 minutes later the same girl turns to me and asks again how can I help you? OK, I say can I be seated, oh you want to order she says. Come on already!!!!  So after this charade I&#39;m seated wherever and wasn&#39;t advised that they had outside dining or giving the option. So staff and I were both clueless apparently.

2. I ordered a deliciously cold and refreshing Coconut Juice to start and could&#39;nt find any Ramen Soup on the menu, so I called over the same lady and I say where&#39;s the Ramen soup on the menu, she says we don&#39;t have Ramen soup and I&#39;m sitting there trying to figure out where the breakdown in communication came in at. OK, so I decide to order the Seared Duck Breast Noodles which was the closest I could get to what I came in there for.

3. The Servers are not only complete clue birds but they&#39;re also rude and got a bit too pushy at the end of the meal. They appeared anxious to clear my table and I understand the need to seat as many people as possible, but it was off-putting after being asked twice if I was done with my meal, which I was not but clearly they wanted me out of my seat as quick as possible so the next 3 minutes went by and the waitstaff came back to my table this time with my check in hand and her hand outreached to remove the bowl. Come on already, Baoburg seems to want to offer a chill environment but having cluebird waitstaff on hand that chases out the customers before they can finish swallowing their meal is an absolute disgrace and really set me against coming back here.

What I ordered - see below  

* Seared Duck Breast Noodles - 4.5
This was a small dish for the asking Price of $12 and the broth you see in the bowl (photo here - https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baoburg-brooklyn-2?select=YpTbVGHSsNFXs61HRMfz-Q) tasted a tad too sugary and salty however the overall dish was very good.

* Pork Bao Buns - 2.5 stars - photo here - https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baoburg-brooklyn-2?select=VV86ujmCwTRZdH8BT72jpA &amp; here - https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baoburg-brooklyn-2?select=WWFZlbnL6ascdPIbPAokXA
I was surprised with this order - for some reason the pork came stewed down in a thick sugary salty type of gravy base along with two super fresh steamed buns and some fresh veggies that you had to put together yourself wasn&#39;t bad but I got nervous thinking about the the level of MSG that might be in this small appetizer and wasn&#39;t good enough for me to reorder again.

I left Baoburg not feeling that great because of the high levels of sodium / sugar content in such small servings and very annoyed that I spent my money here after being rushed out of the door by cluebird&#39;s."

Slightly bigger but with that same intimate feel that the Williamsburg location had- but with a killer backyard. 

When you walk in you&#39;re immediately greeted with the scent of pork buns, short ribs, and fried shrimp. There is a glass wall separating you from the magic. 

We walked in and were immediately seated and greeted by a nice waitress- who we recognized from our last visit in Williamsburg. Everything was incredible. We started out meal with the Korean steak Bao. Un. Real. Still salivating over it. Could have ordered two more but we knew we had the truffle fries coming... Slightly different than they used to be but still out of this world. And then.. the ramen. We went with short rib ramen (which NEVER disappoints) and the khoi soi-an outstanding curried egg noodle ramen with a duck leg confit that we hadn&#39;t seen before. Mind blown.  Both were spicy- so much so that we finished the two bottles of water that were placed ever so suggestively on our table. 

Baoburg has always been our number one and you can be sure that we will be back... Soon. In fact, tomorrow&#39;s brunch sounds great."

Three Stars

The menu and concept look really intriguing but most of the food were base hits rather than home runs. The inside was pretty empty except for the staff having family meal. We sat on the back patio on wooden chairs underneath a cute makeshift awning.  The nice laminated menu were greatly cheapened by the numerous whiteout corrections. I had a draft sapporo which wasn&#39;t close to a full pint. The liquid portion was 2&#34; from the top and inch of foam didn&#39;t reach the top. 

The Papaya Salad was delicious. The combination of green beans, cherry tomatoes, peanuts, bits of hard boiled egg, and lime hit the three flavors I was looking for: heat, citrus, and salt. 

They did not have the hamachi uni toast so don&#39;t get your hopes up.  

The Chicken Wings were also pretty good.  An order comes with 2 complete wings. The meat was tender. The sauce was sticky, sweet, and salty plus the peanuts gave it another textural dimension.    

The Bacon Wrapped Dates and Prunes Takoyaki had way too much going on.  You get 2 skewers: one stick had three dates and other three prunes. The bacon has a takoyaki sauce, then the whole thing is covered in Mayo and Bonito flakes. There were so many flavors, sauces, and seasonings it was hard to tell what was going on.  

The Grandma&#39;s Chicken Over Rice ($12) was tasty but very traditional.  For an asian fusion restaurant I was looking for something more unique. I definitely recommend ordering this over the baos.

The Baos were hot trash. The Pork Bao was described as a &#34;do it yourself&#34; project where they give you two rice flour buns which looked like something straight out of the walking dead. Note to the kitchen, you should probably play the Offspring&#39;s Song &#34;keep them separated&#34; so the buns don&#39;t stick together.  The filling came in a single bowl instead of a little plates making it harder to assemble. The braised pork had a 5 Spice Mole was thick and very Mexican-like. The fennel, green apple, and raisins were a weird combination.  I didn&#39;t like assembling it because it was hard to figure out how much of each ingredient should go into the bao.  As you were building it, the bao bun got cold making it much less appealing.  After finishing the two buns, there was plenty of filling left for another. So I asked the waitress for another bun and she said they come 2 buns per order. It cost $6, which is about twice as much as the bun costs at your local Chinese grocery store.   

The Steak Bao had &#34;Korean Style Bulgogi.&#34; The two Baos were served in a circular bamboo steam basket which made it difficult to remove without dropping the filling. The beef was a cheap flank with absolutely no fat and didn&#39;t really remind me of Bulgogi. The seasoning was there but the lettuce was exploding out of the bun, the onions were a mess, and it was overall way too soggy. 

Baos in my opinion should be small snack size bites ready to be eaten immediately. If you name your restaurant Baoburg, your baos should be the best thing on the menu."

I came here with 5 friends from out of town. We all agree that each dish was on point! 

- The violet dumplings are wrapped in a purple skin (soft, chewy texture) and stuffed with caramelized pineapple and peanuts. YUM

- The Khoa Soi is a must try. It&#39;s a curry like none of us had ever tasted before and comes with a very large Duck Leg Confit. Hello!

FULL BAR: With drinks like the &#34;Farang Dong&#34; (Whiskey and Coke) &amp; &#34;Absinthe minded&#34; using actual Absinthe. 

- I also recommend the Lychee ice tea if you like sweet drinks. It has about three whole pieces of Lychee in it.

- The Bao Buns... Try them all. It&#39;s not your average bun. (Lunch Special)

I could go on and on about the food and the drinks but I gotta mention a little something about the atmosphere. As soon as we walked in we couldn&#39;t help but notice all the flames coming from the open kitchen. Chef Bao is keeping it Hot in the Kitchen! She has already won some prestigious awards and continues to invent new fusion cuisine that is presented the right way.

We were immediately greeted with warm smiles and had no issues getting a table. Our servers were attentive and friendly. They have cool art on the walls and a large patio in the back (perfect for parties). This is my favorite new restaurant in Greenpoint, BK!"

Great ambience, yummy food, friendly staff, and reasonable prices. Kudos to a talented and pretty Chef Bao Bao who has assembled a solid and good-looking team. I used to go to original Baoburg in Williamsburg, now this place is in my neighborhood and I come here often by myself or with friends and depending on a day I go for their dim sum or full-sized dishes.

I&#39;ve pretty much tried and enjoyed everything on the menu. My favorites include buns (especially pork bao and shrimp bao), spring rolls, nachos dumplings, rib eye pho, seafood spaghetti, kra pow. The dishes are rich and flavorful and will test and expand your palate. Pour some spicy sauce for extra kick or ask for hot spices to be added to your dish if you&#39;re not faint of heart (they will challenge you!). Wine selection is limited but I like their Cabernet or Malbec. And their cocktails are decent too (nothing like that fusion of mojito and caipirinha on a hot summer day!).

The inside of the restaurant is relatively small yet cozy. The ambience reminds me of some places I visited in Thailand. There&#39;s also a nice patio area which is quite spacious and can accommodate larger groups. As far as I know, they do not take reservations so if it&#39;s a rainy day it may get crowded inside very quickly. And if it gets busy (especially on weekends) be prepared for some extra wait time.

Overall, very cool place in the very cool neighborhood! Loving it!"

I loved the Thai Milk Iced Tea and Pork Bao. Both had great taste and flavor. The pork Bao came with two Bao and there was enough pork for three Bao which I liked. I would definitely come back for these two. 

The Seared Duck Breast Noodles had great flavor and plenty of seasoning. I would prefer the fat rendered off more on the duck breast. I also wouldn&#39;t mind a larger portion size given that it is a main dish. They do have a menu for sides (extra noodles, not duck). 

Side note: The flower tablecloth looked out of place. The wait staff were friendly as I walked in and left and also asked how the food were.

They were all pretty interesting and I didn&#39;t regret the meal - but it wasn&#39;t as good as I had hoped. This is one of those places where the fusion tastes like fusion instead of just a really great meal that has no classification, if that makes any sense.

The meat was rubbery and hard to chew, and the noodles tasted like they&#39;d been washed with an old sponge. Baoburg also didn&#39;t send over hoisin sauce!

We decided to go to Baoburg a week ago while looking for a good ramen. And boy, did we find it. We started with a pork buns which came out very unique but in a nice way. It came with 2 steamed buns with the pork and such in a cup in the middle so you kind of made your own. Again, not what we expected, we were expecting something more like classic pork bun. But this was very good and different. Love the rich chocolte mole sauce sauce. The short rib ramen was served in a veal stcj which was EVERYTHING!! Had a kick to it for sure but just enough to be SO delicious. Huge portion which came accompanied with hard boiled egg, shiitake mushroom and bok choy, we gone back since and also ordered shirmp dumplings which were also great. Definitely soicy, but great!"

The ambiance was nice and cozy, with 90&#39;s hip hop playing in the background. They have additional seating outside on their back porch, but we didn&#39;t check it out.

For starters we attempted to order the duck salad, but they were out for the night and the waitress recommended the mussels scallion pancake. The pancake was cooked nicely with a generous portion of whole mussels.

I ordered the lamb and rice for my meal, and my boyfriend ordered the khoa soi. The lamb was cooked perfectly and the saltiness of the meat was offset with the sweetness of the rice, it was very good. The khoa so was the standout dish, however. Sweet, spicy and creamy with three duck legs- it was fantastic. I would recommend this place for a date night, and we will be returning!"

I thought we should dine in first before ordering delivery but we needed some quick food tonight so I decided to give Baoburg a whirl.

My husband and I ordered ribeye pho and the duck salad. Both were incredibly flavorful and great as delivery. We had no issues with the pho as delivery item although it was not quite as spicy as we were hoping - nothing a few more jalape√±os couldn&#39;t have fixed. Duck salad was refreshing with crisp duck, mint, green apple, lime dressing all awesome. Awesome flavor combo unexpected ! 
We will definitely try dining in. Hoping its kid friendly!!"

We also shared a khao soi which i thought was pretty good, but my bestie (whos half malaysia so she knows whats up) said it wasnt spicy enough &amp; shes had better. Lastly we got the salted egg custard buns which were also really good! We were considering being fat and getting more buns to go  ...we didnt but it was just that yummy!

After awhile, we were ready to place the food order and even though they got our order right away, it took 70 minutes before our meals came out.

we got some noodle dishes and a few baos- the noodles were way too salty, and the baos were a mess. You would think for a place to have &#34;Bao&#34; in the name it would be good.

We were there for over 2 hours due to the bad service...they had waiters that just stood around and didn&#39;t help service anyone for awhile unless you&#39;re trying to call them over. 

I definitely do not recommend this place, for a better Asian food experience, I would recommend to just head over to xi&#39;an for amazing dishes and fast service"

The staff took care of it though. They refunded and replaced my meal and also threw in a free fried rice. The replacement meal was really delicious so I think I will chalk the first experience up to it still being pretty new. I&#39;ll probably try it again and hopefully the good streak will continue.

the awesome Khoa Soi is yummy with curried thick egg noodle, duck leg, caper &amp; sour cream and pickled condiments.  great all around and a crowd pleaser.  kra pow very spicy, thai style.  and grandma&#39;s chicken over rice was decent.  less poached style and light on chicken rice.  apache pig with grilled marinated pork shoulder also quite spicy with dramatic flavor.  can&#39;t go wrong here.  pork bao also done differently with braised pork belly 5 spice mole with queso fresco, shaved fennel, and raisins in a cup to be spread on the two buns -- nice to have a different take from the usual regular pork belly buns.  overall a thai focus but boat noodle taken off menu.

Wow.  Very professional.  Well, you want to be smug or try to drag me?  Okay, I&#39;ll leave a more detailed review in case something I said didn&#39;t register.

&#34;Your GrubHub order included pho noodles, 2 shrimp baos, and 3 chicken samosas. You demanded a full refund claiming &#34;small size&#34; and that buns lost heat. We believe our menu items are sized right and priced right and we deliver same regular sized portions to our GrubHub customers as what we offer to our &#34;in house&#34; customers. Though we try to deliver food as fast as we can, some items lose temperature faster than others. We&#39;ll continuously look on how to improve this aspect of the delivery.&#34; 
You&#39;re right, I sure did demand a full refund because I spent $40 dollars on food that went in the garbage and made me feel sick.  You offered me a 3 dollar refund...less than what I tipped.  Also, you listed half of my complaint, but conveniently left out the most important part of my complaint.  I didn&#39;t just say the buns lost heat.  I understand that food loses heat when it&#39;s being delivered.  This isn&#39;t my first time ordering food.  Also, yeah your portions were tiny.  However, had it been a small portion but DELICIOUS, there would&#39;ve been no complaint.  I&#39;ve eaten at plenty of restaurants that serve small and delicious portions, and it was not an issue.  My point was the food tasted badly.  There&#39;s no need to get defensive, just accept what I&#39;ve said. You left out the part where I also said that the lettuce and tomato in the baos were NOT fresh.  The lettuce had a weird taste and the tomato was discolored and puckered.  You can say you use fresh ingredients, that&#39;s fine.  Most places intend to.  I&#39;m trying to tell you that nothing about the ingredients used in the baos tasted fresh.  The baos went in the trash.  The only edible thing WAS the samosas.   

&#34;Regarding your reference to MSG, there&#39;s a fairly common misconception about it. It&#39;s a naturally occurring amino acid and designated as safe by the US Food and Drug Administration. We use soy sauce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and other vegetables that contain it.

Here are some excerpts from Wikipedia:&#34;

I know how to look things up on Wikipedia.  I don&#39;t need to be told about misconceptions about MSG.  Too much salt = too much salt.  My hands were swelling.  This has never happened to me when consuming pho before.  Why are you explaining MSG to me?  I didn&#39;t ask you to give me a rundown of what MSG is.  I said my food was way too salty well...because it was.

&#34;It has been suggested that a fear of MSG may reflect anti-Asian racism, with MSG being seen as an &#39;Oriental&#39;, alien arrival in Western cooking, likely to be dangerous. Food critic Jeffrey Steingarten argued that fear of MSG should be seen as a Western-centric mindset, lacking awareness of its common use in Far Eastern cooking without apparent problems: &#34;If MSG is a problem, why doesn&#39;t everyone in China have a headache?&#34; &#34;

No need to throw the &#34;anti-Asian&#34; card at me.  I&#39;m not even from this country, I&#39;m an immigrant who has experienced plenty of racism.  I was an alien when I arrived here.  Why are you quoting a food critic?  How is he relevant?  Has food critic Jeffrey Steingarten eaten at Baoburg?  If he did, where is his review of your restaurant?  I can&#39;t help but wonder what he&#39;d say if he had the food I had yesterday.  

Really...no need to be aggressive.  You&#39;re a business.  Just like a musician or actor, you&#39;re going to get good reviews and bad reviews.  But I see I&#39;m not the only one you&#39;ve gotten smug with when the review wasn&#39;t to your liking.  Well, lesson learned.  If you&#39;re thinking of going to this place, avoid it.  Like I said in my initial review, Lil Mo is a much better place for pho and bao.  I stand by that, especially now."

I initially thought that Baoburg was an extension of Baohaus, Eddy Huang&#39;s restaurant on 14th St, but it is not. 

 Both happen to serve delicious Asian/Chinese fusion food, have &#34;bao&#34; in their name, have an exposed kitchen, and a narrow hallway entrance with a window in front. Baoburg is owned by Chef Bao Bao. Definitely check out this interview done by the Chef&#39;s Connection to get a better sense of her style, her swag:

Now, onto the food!

I ordered the Seared Duck Breast Noodle &amp; the Lamb Dumplings.
After eating both, I now know that there is indeed a God and this God eats well.

Thinking I knew thing or two about dumplings and noodles, I sat down expecting my food to be presented and to taste a certain way. I could feel my snobbery wafting out from under my armpits and so I forced myself to keep my scowl in a book. I unsheathed a new pair of wooden chopsticks from the utensil bouquet on my table and folded up it&#39;s wrapper into a little bench for them to rest on. The waitress handed me a napkin and a fork to which I said, &#34;I don&#39;t need a fork.&#34; The other waiter, who took my order, gave me a plate and a fork to which I said, &#34;I don&#39;t need a fork.&#34; In my mind I was thinking the following:

 Pot stickers are pot stickers; they are deep fried and stuck together on the edges but contain a mixture of meat, cabbage and scallions. The noodles would come in a tasty broth and have a smattering of condiments sprinkled on top. Noodles. I was pleasantly taken aback by the number of flavors, tones and textures in these two dishes I ordered. 

The Lamb Dumplings came in a dark wooden bowl, covered in a green and red onion salad, tossed with red chili. They were lightly topped with (what tasted like) a soy vinaigrette dressing with sesame and what I thought was cranberry juice. I thought I was going mad, &#34;Did I taste cranberries in this sauce or is it lemon grass? Is it lime?&#34; It had the perfect mixture of tartness, sweetness and heat, as if all the flavors were engaged in a delicate dance with the fresh ground lamb in the dumplings. They were steamed first and then charred on the bottom. The crunchiness mirrored that of the onions and was a welcomed contrast to the softness of the dumpling&#39;s skin and filling. Such a joy to eat.

The Seared Duck Breast Noodle came in a bowl that was architecturally tilted on one side. I initially thought the bowl was broken but it turned out to just be the aesthetic of the bowl, forcing me to engage with the noodles at one specific side of the bowl. It was like in those old cartoons when a character is trying to extract a pearl from an open clam shell. The clam shell was the bowl and the pearl was the noodles. This description is getting weirdly extraneous and disorienting. 
In any case, tangent aside, the noodles were fantastic:
Thick ramen noodles nestled in a dark, peppery, clouded, toasty-garlic broth garnished with bok choi. A single umbrella shiitake mushroom, floating sleepily by a bed of sliced fatty duck breast, coated in sesame seed. I was so eager to eat and taste the broth, I nearly burned my tongue on the metal spoon that accompanied the dish. The duck breast is seared so the center of each slice is raw which I thought was strange, panicked customer was triggered; I thought you could only eat fish and beef raw, not birds. You can&#39;t eat raw birds. It didn&#39;t matter though. It was so delicious, the contrast between the seared skin and fat and the raw parts of the duck, it could only be enjoyed as such. 

Suffice to say, I gulped down that soup, looking each waiter dead in the eye. I couldn&#39;t contain my excitement in regards to the food. Got the check, gave each one the &#34;O.K.&#34; symbol with my left hand, which is weird but I did it anyway, and said, &#34;Amazing. Fantastic. The food is amazing.&#34; I shook Chef Bao&#39;s hand, told her my feelings, and that was the last time I was in contact with the divine. I will be back! I will definitely go back to this restaurant, I&#39;m bringing my friends, my family, the deceased, those overseas in places I am not near to. Truly an amazing Bao of a time."

I wasn&#39;t hungry but came along for a drink. Well that changed once the food came out , she ordered the pork and steak bao, and whole shrimp dumplings. Wow the pork was delicious it was slightly sweet as there was apples and raisins in there. I&#39;m not crazy about fruit and food but this really worked with the meat. Now the steak, that is something I would return again and again for. Friend is not a big eater so we shared 1 of the steak boas and She gave me the other to take home she liked the pork better  what amazing flavor there was a lot of onions which can sometimes be off putting but not here. My husband ate it that night and said it was amazing and he&#39;s picky af. They pack a lot of meat into these things which is appreciated in this hood where prices are going up and portion size WAY down. Dumplings were very good I like the whole shrimp as opposed to a shrimp paste type consistency, very strong garlic taste which I don&#39;t mind but be warned: don&#39;t order these if your on a first date. There might not be a second lol the place is small I can see it being a little uncomfortable of its crowded but it was kind of empty so it was fine for us. They do have a nice spacious outdoor area though. I&#39;m really looking forward to returning to try other things on the menu which I&#39;ll be doing soon cause Hubs is pestering me, he wants those steak baos. Oh and the Bellini for $5 was so good, it had a lot of chopped fruit in it so not sure if they maybe gave me sangria by accident but whatever it was was great."

We started off with Pork Bao Buns, which as advertised, turned out to be sinfully good. For main course I ordered Short Rib Ramen that was excellent (broth was on the spicy side which is the way I like it and the meat was very tender). My girlfriend went for Lamb &amp; Rice. At first I was skeptical about her choice as I&#39;m not a huge lamb eater, but I had few bites and the dish was insanely good. Needless to say she loved it too but wished I didn&#39;t eat half of her dish  Just like with my short ribs the lamb was tender and delicious and the coconut flavor made the taste original. We were absolutely satisfied with both of our choices. Throughout the whole stay the staff was very attentive and friendly. The inside of the restaurant has a nice cozy feel to it but the restaurant also has a huge backyard where you can dine when the weather is nice. We also tried couple of cocktails that were top notch. Can&#39;t wait to go back to Baoburg for more fine cuisine but this time we will leave some room for Bao desserts"

In fact it was lacking in any carbohydrate. Might be what some select few might like but I like a complete meal. 
The steak was spiced really well.

An interesting drink for a few pics with a decent amount of alcohol, okay taste.  For food, had the skirt steak ($15), a small portion of tender beef with chimichurri on top.

Their Churros are a good dessert snack as well.  The menu states crusted in almonds, but I asked the waitress if they could not crust mine, and they accommodated. 

The weather was on our side, and they had the back patio opened, which I didnt even know they had.  And, it was open to small children.

However, since it was comfortably busy when I was there on a Thursday night I guess the secret is out and it wouldn&#39;t do any good any way. 

So....in the interest of being honest and forthright let me tell you the following:

1. Every dam thing is delicious
2. It doesn&#39;t make a big deal of it but the menu has fantastic vegetarian options
3. The drinks are ERRTHING (I&#39;m personally a fan of the Feeling Catcher but you should do you, can&#39;t go wrong)
4. I just left and I&#39;m ready to turn this cab around and go back to lick my plate. 

My sister and I had guacamole (delish), tamal (unctuously creamy and amazing), papusas (two words: pickled slaw. Also, whatever that tomato relish is underneath I&#39;d like a jar), empanadas (more please) and  Bibb salad with cashews and hearts of palm (speaks for itself). 

Basically the environment is just right for friends or lovers; the menu offers truly well crafted and yummy food for carnivores and vegetarians; the cocktails are appropriately complex yet easy to enjoy; and finally, don&#39;t come here cause you&#39;ll tell your friends and they&#39;ll tell their friends and it will be ruined for us all.

Words can&#39;t describe how much I enjoyed my meal, and the overall ambiance of the place.

Chill crowd, laid back staff and an intriguing food and cocktail menu were just the tip of the iceberg.

My date and I ordered the Churrasco Skirt Steak, Ceviche, Grandma Torres&#39;s Pernil &amp; Mofongo and some chips and guac and everything ranged from very good to downright amazing.

Chips and guac were good, nothing outrageous, although the salsa was excellent with a noticeable citrusy kick you don&#39;t find in most other salsas.

The Pernil and Mofogo was also very good, especially the Mofongo. I&#39;ve never been the biggest fan of Mofongo, as it&#39;s typically too dry for my liking, but Leyenda&#39;s take on it was moist, flavorful, and the perfect accompaniment for the Pernil.

The two standouts were the Churrasco Skirt Steak and the Ceviche.

Easily one of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever eaten. Seasoned and cooked perfectly, it was melt in your mouth good, and still has me craving another piece two days later.

The Ceviche was a much different twist than I&#39;m used to, what with apple, ginger and pomegranate added to the mix, but it surprisingly all worked together to create a fresh, vibrant and flavorful dish. 

Good stuff.

My only complaint was that I did not enjoy my drink (Shadow Boxer) all that much, but a minor complaint on an otherwise majorly good evening of food and drink.

Will absolutely be back!"

Well, that was a somewhat prophetic typo because that evening, and all other subsequent Smith Street evenings at this fine establishment, have combined &#39;Leyenda&#39; with &#39;Yay!&#39; Because this joint kicks ass. 

To elaborate on that, here is a short list of Things I&#39;ve Never Had At Leyenda:

1. A bad cocktail. From the nearly always appropriate Sonambula to the very boozy Cabezaso or the mezcal-based Lil&#39; Smokey (perhaps my favorite so far), the cocteles are impeccable. The &#39;Dem Apples is a nice seasonal one, if you&#39;re into that. Try a mezcal flight if nothing appeals to you, and expand your mind, man.

2. Bad service. The bartenders (including Ivy Mix, somewhat of a celebrity in the world of alcohol) don&#39;t just know their biz, they offer up genuinely friendly smiles that are only outdone by the adorable sweetheart who was running food this past Tuesday evening. She was more excited than I was about the tinga tacos I was getting, which is quite frankly, incredible.

3. My appendix out. I don&#39;t think they offer that service here. 

4. Anything half-assed. Thought and care has gone into every aspect of this place, and I appreciate it. The effect of the candlelight reflecting off the gorgeous golden ceiling makes me want to sit in my seat and sip mezcal forever. Not even the garnishes are afterthoughts, but rather careful additions (candied ginger, dried apples, cooked pineapple) that add a little more complexity to already deliciously complex drinks.

5. Bad food. The plates are beautiful and for the most part, very tasty, Pupusas, flautas, arepas, empanadas...all damn good accompaniment to the booze, which is the star of the show in this particular establishment. I imagine the croquetas are good as well, as it seems that I like anything that ends in &#34;as.&#34; I have yet to make a decision about the panuchos or the rellenos. 

It&#39;s safe to say that I will be back, soon and often."

I first became acquainted with Leyenda at Cocktail Magic (http://www.cocktailmagic.com/#/newyork) earlier this spring. My friends and I had the opportunity to sample a plethora of different cocktails from some of the biggest names around town, and one of Leyenda&#39;s drinks, La Son√°mbula, was our hands down favorite of the night. After my experience there, I had it on my to-do list to visit the actual location.

I&#39;ve now been multiple times, and could not be more impressed. Absolutely love the space - the place is always abuzz, yet still feels intimate no matter whether you&#39;re seated at the bar, along the window, or at the tables. I could definitely see the place as a cute date spot. The cocktails here are all winners. My favorite as mentioned above, La Son√°mbula, is excellent - comprised of &#34;Jalape√±o infused blanco tequila, lemon, chamomile, mole &amp; Peychaud&#39;s bitters.&#34; It is just the perfect amount of spicy and sweet, and I always get at least one each time I come. The Tia Mia is also another favorite of mine. Food is surprisingly good - I always get the chips, salsa, and guacamole. The chips are crisp and thick which I love, the salsa fresh, and I dig the guacamole that&#39;s served in an emptied out avocado shell. I usually get the pork tacos - each comes stuffed with meat, and are delicious. Service is attentive and prompt, which is impressive considering how busy the place gets. During my times there, have never felt rushed either.

Julie Reiner and Ivy Mix have a real winner on their hands here, and I am so glad they&#39;ve opened Leyenda in the neighborhood - if you love cocktails, you definitely need to check this place out; you won&#39;t be disappointed :)"

Dammit, I thought I was completely happy with what I thought were stellar cocktails at Maison Premiere and June, yet somehow, after discovering you (and having to see you 5 times in one week) I figured I could still go back to my old standbys for impressive drinks and would still be satisfied.  Oh, hell no.  June seriously tasted like I had gone from Pliny the Younger to Keystone Light, and Maison Premiere was just plain terrible. I used to be fooled by Maison Premieres Disneyland theatrics but last week I went and after Leyenda and my wife and I both felt like we were drinking crappy liquor smothered with fancy flowers. 

Leyenda on otherhand just focuses on the craft of the cocktail and uses some crazy good ingredients. No attitude, no judgement, no fake theatrics....just insanely good cocktails.  Yes, I will admit being a 6&#39;-5 guy it can feel a bit strange ordering a drink that is topped with flowers and other less than manly decorations, but dammit are these drinks strong,and unlike other places, all these toppings are just pretty decorations but play into the flavor of the drink. Everything is just perfectly balanced. 

Yes, I realize this is a spinoff of Clover Club, but it is so many levels better than Clover.  I have lived in this hood for 14 years and while I love Clover club for the drinks (although sadly their best drink, the triboro, is long gone), the fake new Irish pub plasticy woodwork is just distracting. It just doesn&#39;t work and then pair with the weird fake handlebar mustached 1920s actor/bouncer at the door and I just gave up on them (despite greatly respecting their cocktails). 

Leyenda is different.  This spot had a series of failed restaurants and rather than gutting the place they kept the facade and then added in a few knickknacks to give character yet not feel pretentious. 

Okay so I realize I am not listing specific drinks, even though I have had them all, but I have to say you can&#39;t go wrong. Just talk to the bartender and go with what you like. Surprisingly, I found the rum based drinks my least favorite. The tequila ones really rock. Their signature Tia Mia is phenomenal. 

The bartenders are really great. We have spent the most time with Amanda but Brian rocked it tonight. We finally made it to the happy hour and plowed through whole menu (hard to resist $6 cocktails of this caliber).  The Chilcano was my favorite although I never made it to the Michelado which looks insanely good. 

So the food is really solid but it is mostly small plates. We enjoyed everything we have had, but it is not like we would plan for dinner here...it is more that the cocktails are so strong and delicious that you can&#39;t help but order the whole menu. 

So yeh, this place is the bomb. And dare I say the best cocktails in NYC (which I guess isn&#39;t that daring since Ivy Mix won best bartender in America...of course in the dozen of times we have been here we have never seen her)."

I started with La Sonambula, which is a spicy jalapeno-infused drink, and then switched to Lil Smokey, which was a delicious infusion of smoke and sweetness. My friend and I split an order of guacamole and I ordered the Fautas. The guac was fantastic (and a pretty generous portion) but unfortunately the Fautas were only average - they sort of reminded me of microwaved taquitos.

Venue - Dimly lit wooden bar area in the front, garden patio in the back.

Food - Everything I ordered was wonderfully flavorful and came out fast. For tapas, the portions are quite decent. 

The dish that stood out to me most was the mofongo. All the ones I had before were dense and dry and needed gravy in every spoonful. The monfongo here was moist and flavorful - so good!

Drinks - The cocktails are good and they also have wine and beer.

Service - Friendly"

I liked that there are tons of items to choose from on both the cocktail and food menus without it feeling all over the place. This is the type of place you need to visit a few times to find your favorites because there&#39;s a lot of tough decisions to make on both the cocktail and food menus.

The four food items my girlfriend and I chose to share were all amazing. Sorry for not listing specific items, my visit to Leyenda was about two months ago. I can recall the tequila-flamed shrimp arepa and tamal flaco though, because I took pictures. I think the shrimp arepa was my favorite dish of the night, but I could have predicted that based on my taste, just from reading the description on the menu.

 I know this is a cocktail bar first, and restaurant second, but we felt a little crammed eating a full dinner at the little high table with bar stools. We had to improvise a place to set aside our jackets and my girlfriends purse, which can be difficult since this place can get crowded. Overall though we loved our meal and had a nice buzz from our two cocktails. The service was good too, our waiter was helpful when we were deciding on our dinner order."

It&#39;s so overpriced and not authentic. Starters are amuse bouche sizes and entrees are appetizer sizes. It&#39;s so not worth it - I would understand if the food was excellent - it&#39;s just ok and again not the real deal by a long shot. The pupusas are a joke. Got swordfish skewers (&#34;deconstructed&#34; tacos) for $15 and it came with 3 thumb size chunks of swordfish, tortillas and veggies and guac - meh on the taste. Service is slow. Drinks take a little longer than expected (dinner time on a week night). It&#39;s not good, don&#39;t be fooled.

The place looks nice and is packed but it&#39;s got awful acoustics (super loud) and it&#39;s kinda tight inside.

I don&#39;t mind spending on GOOD food but this is not right in so many levels. Skip this spot.

Conclusion: it&#39;s a hip spot waiting to rip you off with fancy cocktails and &#34;exotic&#34; latin food.

1 star - Witching Hour cocktail (it was amazing) (and honestly cocktails are good - but that is expected)
2 star - hip looking"

We came here on an early Sunday night after drinks at Clover Club across the street. It wasn&#39;t busy when we walked in, but filled up nicely when we left. 

Excuse my lack of use of Spanish words, we got guacamole, goat and chicken tacos, some appetizer that&#39;s fried potatoes filled with ground beef, and pulled pork shoulders as entree. 
- Guacamole was nicely flavored, and my husband cannot stopped raving about their chips, which were crispy and freshly fried. Definitely not stale like our past few Mexican restaurants. 
- Both goat and chicken tacos were great. Flavors were well balanced, meat were juicy and tender. Absolutely no complaints. 
- Colombian papas rellenas, aka fried potatoes filled with ground beef was my second favorite of the night. It was not heavy like normal fried potatoes, instead, it was airy but full of flavors. I think it&#39;s their play on coquette, only better. 
- My favorite of the night, pulled pork shoulders, were simple but AMAZING. There&#39;s nothing fancy to this plate, just some old fashioned pulled pork shoulders, filled with flavors. We licked every bit of it from the plate. 

Ok, in addition to the food here, you have to try their drinks. The one drink I absolutely loved was Maiden Name, it literally tasted like a smoothie, with coconut, vanilla, cinnamon, and came with a flaming half lime on top that made the presentation on par with any other fancy speakeasy places I&#39;ve been to.  

Needless to say, I will be back."

Every drink we tried was exactly what it needed to be...delicious, balanced, and fun. You won&#39;t find yourself looking at the menu perplexed by ingredients that you&#39;ve never heard of, that&#39;s not what this bar is about. 

The food was delicious! we ordered several items and even ordered the pork shoulder twice!

We were lucky enough to catch Ivy behind the bar. She was a wonderful host and along with the rest of her staff, absolutely made the experience for us. 

A common theme of our trip to NYC/BK was having to wait outside of bars, being told where to sit, being told we can&#39;t come in, being told that we&#39;d be called back later...Leyenda was a breath of fresh air and hospitality that is missing at a lot of New York bars.

Da Hora was really nice though a little fruity for me.  They sweetened my mojito no sugar order with muddled strawberries, excellent addition!!! And the shadow boxer was a great close, which might have grown a hair on my chest! Awesome combination of flavors, all making for a very enjoyable experience and an even better time ;)

Food- really fresh and tasty! Guacamole and salsa, could have been spicier, but still very good. Ceviche was really excellent and the highest quality of tuna! Really fresh!!!

Normally I might go to Bar Tabac or Los Lobos when I&#39;m in Cobble Hill, but the other night it felt right to try Leyenda. Now it&#39;s potentially my new favorite spot.

Walking into Leyenda, I knew I made the right choice in the moment. The place feels warm and inviting. A beautiful wooden bar on the left, complementary wood tables and benches on the right and in the back, overhead lighting mixed with votives on the tables and religious candles on an exposed brick wall...it all works together to say &#34;Welcome. Have a seat. You&#39;re going to like it here.&#34;

So I had a seat at the bar. The restaurant on a Thursday night was at the enjoyable equilibrium of being busy but not crowded. The bartender was the perfect mix of professional, friendly, and talented and made an excellent cocktail. (Rereading that last sentence, you&#39;ll have to forgive the &#34;perfect mix&#34; pun, because it turns out that the bartender was actually a co-owner and her name is Ivy Mix.) I sipped on my glass of deliciousness, relaxed, and waited for one of my best friends, who had decided to join me for a drink.

I was hungry, so I ordered the Churrasco Skirt Steak. My friend showed up, sat down, was greeted by the bartender in that &#34;perfect mix&#34; kind of way, and then was served her own glass of deliciousness. (As an aside, if you sit at the bar, it becomes very clear very quickly why Ivy Mix is an award winning bartender.)  My steak came out fast, hot, and was presented simply. I&#39;ll admit my first thought was &#34;oh no, this is going to be the weak link&#34;, but that thought was kicked to the curb because the steak was excellent, and a new thought entered my head: &#34;exactly what I wanted.&#34; I offered a piece to my friend (who had said she wasn&#39;t hungry); &#34;ooh that IS good&#34; was followed by &#34;another piece please&#34;.

We stayed for a second drink and Ivy engaged us with fun and interesting conversation. My friend left before me, slightly and happily intoxicated. I lingered and chatted and finished my drink. I thanked Ivy and as I left I&#39;m pretty sure I gave her and Leyenda one of my highest compliments: &#34;I&#39;ll be back&#34;."

It was quite crowded and you have to wait a bit to get your drinks, but frankly it&#39;s NYC and any good establishment should be packed even on a Tuesday night, in the summer. The drinks were well worth the wait! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were courteous and attentive the whole time despite being seemingly slammed with orders. 

Even though we had already eaten, the menu enticed us to order a night cap, the Goat Picadillo Tacos. They were so delicious, my fianc√©e at two of the three tacos and she doesn&#39;t usually eat meat. They have a host of small plates that look very good as well, but we were already pretty full from dinner. I definitely want to come back and try a lot of the food options.

The food programma is also dope. Get the churros and the pupusas.

Poor value. The portions are very small and quite pricy. The ceviche, which was mostly fruit with a dash of ahi, was $13. The two-bite panuchos were $16 (compare with tacos at OMG) and the wee bit o&#39; snapper was $22 (compare with a whole fish at any Chinese restaurant).

Poor service. They were pretty understaffed (there appeared to be one waitress on Friday at 9pm), and it took a long time to get her attention. And more time to get water and napkins. When we got the check, she had turned around and left before we could hand her our credit cards.

Yes your staff knows everything there is to know about everything that has ever happened in the bar world, but you&#39;re just NOT friendly.  I don&#39;t want to be made to feel bad about not knowing what something is when I&#39;m spending $15 a drink. Yes the cocktail was good, but it wasn&#39;t good enough to make up for the fact that I had to wait almost 25 minutes for it and was only given sporadic attention by my server who had a chip on her shoulder.  I hate leaving a place feeling like I&#39;ve been scolded and ignored.....and then asked to pay for it. 

Also, the food was HORRIBLE.  There&#39;s no flavor to what is supposed to be &#34;South American&#34; food.  Our rellenos were mushy and soggy (I&#39;m used to rellnos having a crisp outter shell but once again maybe I just don&#39;t know anything).  I will say that the guac in 1/2 and avocado shell was a super cute presentation but spilled everywhere as soon as I tried to take a scoop with a chip.  

I gave two stars because the decor is nice albeit very fresh looking with little character, but I assume that will ware in as the place gets older."

- The pierogis are made to order, so it takes a little while, but you can definitely taste the love. 
- They accept credit cards, serve a small selection of beer and have an adorable seating area. 

What I ordered:
- bacon cheddar (pan fried):  the bacon flavor is amazingly robust! After trying many of their flavors, this is my favorite!  
- potato &amp; cheese (boiled) and added a side of saut√©ed mushrooms:  the skin is soft and the filling has bits of course potato, making for amazing texture. Along with bacon cheddar, this is my go-to flavor."

Baba&#39;s did not disappoint.  My small order of (5) fried potato and cheese pierogies topped with caramelized onions was perfection.  My husband said the kielbasy was delicious.  The only reason that I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because 2 of the 3 salads on the menu were unavailable.

My cousin, who lives in the area, was ecstatic when I told him about our visit to Baba&#39;s.  He said that he would have recommended the place had we not found it ourselves.  I am sad that our stay was so short because I would have definitely returned."

There are easily half a dozen variations from various eastern European countries but Baba&#39;s...they have really done something great with them!  The recipe comes from grandma and you can see photos of grandma making them on the website.  

Sit in the restaurant and you&#39;re treated to the warm smells of homey comfort food in a clean and bright space.  The pierogies are made to order - you can choose the filling, then the preparation method, and add toppings (for a couple cents extra, usually).  

I really liked the boiled potato and cheese and the fried bacon cheddar.  Both were flavorful and super addictive.  I suggest getting the large order of 9 (vs small order of 5) which will leave you wishing for more if only your tummy could hold them.  I suggest top(ping) less because I like them in their simple, naked splendor but I&#39;ve had the sauerkraut and that&#39;s an amazing choice as well - the tanginess really cuts that rich potato-y filling.

I also love that they have delivery. Pierogies travel surprisingly well and reheat pretty well too.

So if you&#39;re ever in dire need of come comfort food, check out Baba&#39;s!"

Being from Russian decent I have had fresh, homemade potato pierogies before so I certainly had high expectations.

The place is set up so that you walk in and there are tables on the left with a counter behind it where the employees and registers are. Behind them is the partially open kitchen itself. The design feels pretty homey with a lot of wood elements: from tables and chairs to the counter and some of the walls, combined with a modern clean look. 

The menu fits the design by incorporating classics such as the potato and cheese pierogies with more daring flavors such as bacon cheddar or spinach and feta. They also give you a choice of them being boiled or pan fried. I stuck with the traditional boiled potato pierogies and ordered five of those while my cousin placed a few orders, which included the jalapeno one. I have also added a side of sour cream and chives because it&#39;s hard for me to imagine consuming them any other way.

I prefer to eat them boiled so as to experience the flavor to its fullest, and the pierogies here definitely did not disappoint. However, after eating all five pierogies, I found myself still feeling hungry, which is pretty sad considering I already found them to be overpriced. I would recommend ordering 9 pierogies of your favorite flavor and another 5 of something you&#39;d like to try.

The girl at the counter was sweet, but they did forget to give my cousin one of items she purchased, and since she was very pregnant at the time, I went back to pick it up. Not a big deal but definitely something I didn&#39;t forget. However, if I am ever in the area once again, I will definitely come back and follow my own recommendation for ordering"

On a Saturday afternoon around 1pm, the restaurant was pretty full. We decided to order three types to try: jalapeno (boiled), spinach &amp; feta (boiled), and mac &amp; cheese (pan fried). All three of them were delicious! The pierogies did take a while to come out of the kitchen, but we could tell they were all freshly made. Later that afternoon when we came back around 3:30pm, it was still (surprisingly) pretty full. This time we ordered potato cheese (boiled), bacon cheddar (pan fried), and mac &amp; cheese (pan fried). We also decided to get some of the homemade applesauce and Helen&#39;s dips, which are toppings that you can add for an additional amount. Helen&#39;s dip was a blend of sriracha, lime juice, and sour cream, and it added a nice kick to the savory pierogies. 

The service here was also wonderful. Our water was always refilled promptly and they apologized repeatedly for the table wait, even though we didn&#39;t even mind. One of the guys working there was so incredibly nice - even after we had left the shop and were standing around outside, he came to the door to say thanks for coming.

I suppose slavic people aren&#39;t as bad as they are portrayed in the movies, nor the food as boring as its reputation would suggest. 

Proof:
Baba pierogies, from their friendly and helpful service, to their version of the National dish in many slavic countries, pierogies. I was impressed. 

Before I try to explain my blissful bite here, a quick note first. 
       For me, a dish made to perfection is the hardest to describe, it is one of my withdrawal symptoms of a euphoric experience in a restaurant. So when I took the time later that day to write a review, I was obviously still under the influence, and couldn&#39;t find the right words. 

From a peasant food in the olden times to a national dish in Poland, slovakia, and Ukraine, the pierogi made it&#39;s way through thick and thin only to end up in a freezer near you, not bad for its legacy, Ha? But Hey, it even has a race, the great pierogi mascot race. Not to mention a monument in Alberta Canada. So does that mean that it&#39;s easy to find a juicy, freshly made on the spot, pierogi? The answer would have been no, If it wasn&#39;t for &#34;Baba pierogies&#34;. 

The benefits of walking in to an empty restaurant with a empty stomach was three fold. Not only was the service really fast - it really comes in handy when you are in the state of hangriness, and picture taking of the place, easy and fun (nice lighting for pictures btw), but I also had the opportunity to talk to one of the family members about their Baba&#39;s recipe, and even get some tips on Local eateries. 

In less than five minutes after ordering my pan fried jalape√±o pierogies, the basket came out with nine pieces ($11) a side of bacon bits ($1.25), warm sauerkraut ($1), and Helen&#39;s dip ($0.50). The combination was just pure joy, it hit all the right spots, both in texture and in taste. I was happy that I decided to go with the pan fried over Boiled. That extra crisp added so much to the filling of potato, cheddar, and jalape√±o that I had an epiphany of sorts when it comes to the latest sophistication of street food around the world. Especially when the fillings of the pierogi worked so well together, when it&#39;s not even the traditional version of it. 

But let&#39;s not forget the star of the night, the one that worked tirelessly to put all of these flavors under a shining light, and highlight the harmonious flavor profile of the pierogi, the one and only: Helen&#39;s dip! Yes, the ingredients of this dip are simple, it&#39;s Sriracha, lime juice, and mayo. But that only adds to the mystery of how perfect a dip / condiment can be. 


Go, and go again.

Ps. The Helen&#39;s dip by itself is so addictive   and awesome, I think they should sell them alone, unadulterated.. I&#39;ll buy a few jars... It&#39;s that good."

It&#39;s super cute, with a reasonable amount of seating, and they have a ton of pierogies available.

I went with the bacon/cheddar (because it was bacon and cheddar) and the jalapeno. Got both orders pan fried. The pierogies range from $8 to $9.50 for small order of 5, or $10.50 to $12 for a large order of 9. I did two of the small orders just for myself because I&#39;m a fat ass. So that added up quickly.

But hey, nothing like potatoes to line your stomach full of alcohol. The dumplings were pretty substantially sized, the skin was just the right thickness to be fried to a crisp without being too doughy. Perfect for dipping into the sour cream that came with the orders.

I took mine to go, but I basically destroyed one box of them on my walk home because I just couldn&#39;t resist. Again, I&#39;m fat."

I was quite full from lunch so I only sampled three types of pierogie, two savory and one sweet, from my boyfriend&#39;s plate. The savory ones were mac &amp; cheese and bacon cheddar. Made fresh and panfried to perfection, these pierogies are tiny little pillows of joy. The Helen&#39;s dip we got on the side was a great addition to the pierogies. 

After we devoured the savory pierogies, We had no choice but to order another serving of the crunchy chocolate pierogies. And we are so happy. Topped with whipped cream, each bite oozes out with yummy hazelnut chocolate fillings.   

Another note. Get the green tea lemonade! Loved the hint of jasmine."

Tried the pan fried mac &amp; cheese pierogi and it was really good. The dumpling shell is very thin and isn&#39;t dripping in oil even though it was fried. The Mac and cheese filling is creamy and delicious, just the right texture. We ordered the small which comes in an order of 5 pieces for $8.50 and a side of cream cheese which went surprisingly well with the pierogi. Bit pricey for the size of the dumplings and just 5 pieces but I guess that&#39;s the price you pay for being in gowanus."

These pierogee sate the best I&#39;ve had since my childhood. We had a neighbor who would invite me to help her prepare the dough, then share her beautiful dumplings with us. I was fascinated by how much care went into making the dough, as well as the precision involved in stuffing, sealing and boiling them. Helena&#39;s team makes the dough daily and fillings at least once a day. Everything is fresh, never frozen. I encourage you to go quickly. Baba&#39;s is a rare and special treat.

Really it can&#39;t, and they&#39;re making some pretty great Pierogies, though the prices are be a bit surprising for a typically inexpensive comfort food. I&#39;ll just leave it at that. More importantly, they&#39;re filling. So in the end it balances out your wallet and your pleasure.

Each dumpling is handmade to order, so it takes a bit of time, but they are tasty and worth the wait. If you&#39;re looking for a Polish snack, stop by and get some to go - unless the 3 tables are empty and you can stay.

Actually that&#39;s one thing to consider before going, the seating is limited and I have walked by and noticed it was full, so be prepared for that if it&#39;s a popular dining hour and you need your pierogie injection ASAP."

Okay - so pierogies aren&#39;t so into visual appeal, but you can&#39;t argue the carbs in carbs thing is legit. And these guys put it on another level. I grew up in a Ukrainian/Polish quarter, so I will say these ones are what you&#39;d call authentic and the dough is way lighter than I&#39;m used to, but still super yum. 

Go for the mac and cheese ones, if for nothing but novelty (I&#39;m not entirely sure it wasn&#39;t Velvetta KD in there, but if it was it was the right choice). Jalapeno ones also yum times. They&#39;re not as filling as the heavy guys I&#39;m used to, so don&#39;t fear ordering enough to try a few kinds and sharesies!"

A new friend recommended I come by and try the pierogies. I had the bacon cheddar potato and also the jalapeno cheddar and potato. I couldn&#39;t decide which was my favorite, so I choose both ! Also enjoyed the beer on tap. Czechvar I think it was. 

There were two sisters working there and they were both super friendly. I really liked the way one of them told an interesting story to a group of customers about the different types of dumplings/pierogies from country to country in Eastern Europe. 

The bowling alley wood counter and tables and pallet wood decor is not only stylish but environmentally friendly. Extra points for being green. This restaurant is spotless, beautiful and there was a very relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. I would have stayed longer since I was having a great time but it was nearing closing time. I ordered a large order of the bacon cheddar pierogies and also the crunchy chocolate desert pierogies to go. I went back to my workplace and shared this goodness with my friends. The pierogies never had a chance ! Gone in 60 seconds :)

They offer several different pierogie fillings and they are all cooked to perfection.  I came with 3 friends and shared the mac n cheese, jalepeno, and bacon and cheese pierogies.  I also had a few bites of the carrot salad. The pierogies are all made in house and can either be fried or boiled. I can&#39;t even tell you how delicious these dumplings are. 

The restaurant is a small, family run business that seats about 10 people total. The tables are small, so not the best place to come with a large group. I would say to definitely eat in the restaurant because the presentation of each dish is quite adorable. 

So why the -1 star you say? You have to order 5-8 of the same pierogies. The restaurant does not let you mix and match, which I think is a problem. When I come to a restaurant that sells dumplings, I want to be able to mix and match what I buy, especially if I dine by myself.  At a place that acts as more of a takeout join, I should be able to order 1 mac-n-cheese, 1 jalepeno, and 3 bacon and cheese pierogies (or whatever tickles my fancy on that day)."

You put your order at the counter and the restaurant makes it fresh. I would highly suggest the extra toppings of caramelized onions and mushrooms &amp; trying some of the dips. We ended up getting a large and small order of different pierogies. This was definitely enough for two if not too much. 

After you put your order, snag a table! When we were there on a Friday night, it was a bit difficult to get seating. This is because it does take time to make the pierogies so the customers are usually just sitting at the table and waiting for their order. 

Lastly, bus your own table. 

I believe when we went about a month or so ago, the restaurant was still working on getting their beer and wine license."

Baba&#39;s fit the bill.. Growing up on polish food, I&#39;m familiar with the fare. Babas takes the classic pierogi and goes a step further, offering them a bit of a gourmet twist. They offer pierogi boiled or pan fried, in various flavors. I went with the bacon cheddar potato pan fried, and a keibassa platter. It consisted of a nice link of keibassa, some krout, a horseradish dip, and some bread. The pierogi was excellent.  Pan fried, akin to a good chinese dumpling should be, yet stayed soft, tender. Very flavorful. The keibassa was equally tasty, but the accompanying dip and krout were not as bold tasting as I would have liked.. Hearty sausages need big flavor to balance against IMHO. I&#39;ll definitely be back, the thought of those dessert blueberry pierogi are lingering in my mind..."

And it&#39;s clean and smells nice.

I was lucky to get there and find a table immediately, even if it was around 12pm, I am sure it gets busy then.
The service is super nice and helpful, they have free water for everybody which is I appreciate when I find it.

I ordered the boiled bacon and ceddar 5pcs pierogi ($8.50) with additional saute&#39; mushrooms ($0.75). Both delicious, very fresh, mouth melting and tasty.
As I told the kind Lady at the counter, next time I will ask for double saute&#39; mushrooms because the quantity of pierogi vs the mushrooms is not balanced (too few mushrooms).

I&#39;ll be back for sure and try other versions, but I hope they will introduce a &#34;tasting platter&#34; because personally, being curious but often having lunch on my own, I would be happy to taste different styles without needing to order 5ps of each of these delicious (but filling) pierogi.

Tip 1) Baba&#39;s is very close to Runner &amp; Stone, I suggest you stop there to buy your bread before going back home! And if you wish to get an excellent lobster roll after the pierogi, just to go from meat/cheese/potatoes to seafood... in front of R&amp;S you&#39;ll see Littleneck (open from 5pm - weekends also brunch-time)

Tip 2) If you are by car and you don&#39;t find street parking, look around.... you&#39;ll see a big free parking close by, you just need to do your food shopping there, as it is for customers only."

While this is not the perfect pierogie for me (Brighton still rules) I did appreciate their modern take and the variety of fillings on the menu. The space is bright and clean and the family (?) that runs it are very nice. You can see them making the pierogies in the back. I went with the classic potato filled ones with fried onions on top and sour cream on the side. My kids enjoyed them immensely. What&#39;s not to like about mashed potatoes inside dough? What blew me away were the chocolate hazelnut filled ones. Thank god the serving comes with 5 pieces because I would have kept going. Will definitely be back for more.

Don&#39;t leave without trying the potato pierogies (get a side of the bacon) and the crunchy chocolate pierogies."

The decor inside is really wonderful (make sure to read the plaque which explains the origin of the cushions and the wood). 

We had fried mac and cheese, fried bacon and cheddar, and boiled spinach and feta pierogis. The spinach and feta were definitely our favorites but all three were great. They also came out within a few minutes of ordering.

The staff were really pleasant and we can&#39;t wait to go back. The only minor dings I can think of are:
- lack of air conditioning
- would be nice if there were more pre-curated combos on the menu (staff shared a good recommendation for a combo, feels like that should be right on the menu)"

At baba&#39;s pierogies  the joy is found in the crunchy pierogie edges, the crispy bacon bits I got as a side, and last but not least, the Helen&#39;s dip. A mixture of sriracha, lime juice, and mayonnaise, the combination is one comparable only to crack (not that I would know). The stuff is addictive and I cannot think of anything that would be inappropriate to pair it with. That being said, I recommend the jalepeno/cheddar pierogi, it retains the flavor of the jalapeno yet is still mild enough for those afraid of spice to dive in. The creamy mixture of potatoe and cheddar is damn near perfection. The pan frying in lieu of deep frying ensures that. The pierogies do not become over saturated with oil, and soggy, nore is the dough dry like the microwaved frozen version, my introduction to pierogies. To drink I had a wonderful jasmine-lemonade-green tea type drink. All in all this was a successful visit to a wonderful specialty shop.

They have closed down. We kept trying all sorts of packaged products but none was satisfactory. Then a wonderful friend recommended Baba&#39;s. We were sort of (but not really) in the neighborhood so in we went. It&#39;s a lovely, sleek yet inviting little place. It is SPOTLESS! It could easily put many operating rooms to shame. On the wall is a big map of America and Europe and lots of intriguing photos of the old world. 

We had the basic potato pierogies, and a delightful carrot salad. My wife had her pierogies boiled and mine were pan fried. We both had grilled onions. 

We found the pierogies we had been looking for! Perfection! The dough was tender and tasty with just a little bit of tooth to them. The filling was perfect-- moist, flavorful, full of that wonderful, down home (regardless of where your home is) potato essence. The onions were the ideal garnish. 

We took some home with us. We packed them with ice and brought them all the way to Connecticut where we ate them today. These were the potato and farmer cheese versions. They were also terrific. They were lighter and more delicately flavored but lacked the intense potato flavor-- different but neither better nor worse. Just another taste experience. 

If you can walk here or take a train or bus, do so. Waste no time. If you have to drive, be prepared to struggle a bit with parking. You can do it but you may wind up walking a distance when you do. Don&#39;t let that deter you. This is worth it!"

A fantastic family run business. Very clean, very comfortable for dining in. They also had a good deal of take away while we were there. We had 5 pan fried sauerkraut and 5 boiled bacon &amp; cheddar. Everything prepared from scratch while we waited. (Less than 10 min). Sour cream &amp; horseradish dipping sauce made our succulent, puffy, potato wrapped pirogues  plum irresistible. We saved just enough room for chocolate pirogues with fresh whipped cream. Yum!  We left with smiles on our faces; satisfied but not bloated. Family photos on the wall show their devotion to their craft.

Pros-- The dumplings are made ready to order-aka very, very fresh! I tried one of my friend&#39;s bacon and cheddar pierogies which had great flavoring. Out of the ones I ordered, the bacon and cheddar was the winner.

Cons-- The mac and cheese pierogies were oddly spicy. The prices were pretty steep considering the pierogies aren&#39;t that large. They averaged a little under $2 a pop. I tried the crunchy chocolate pierogies as well which were just nutella inside the dumplings. It was good regardless, but nothing that inventive."

I&#39;ve had every variation on the menu both boiled and fried and they are great any way you get them. 
So if your not feeling the food truck at your local shuffleboard spot you and don&#39;t want to overload on a monster pork chop at the local staple this is the spot.

Several years ago, I was first introduced to potato pierogies thanks to an an old co-worker of mine who use to make them with her mother as a Polish family tradition, so I was excited to try Baba&#39;s so I can reintroduce myself to this overdue treat. 

This shop serves a twist on the traditional dumpling dish by including a variety of fillings like Jalape√±o, Bacon &amp; Cheddar, Mac &amp; Cheese, &amp; Classic Potato. You can also add some toppings like caramelized onions, sauerkraut, saut√©ed mushrooms, bacon bits, &amp; sour cream. BTW, you can order the pierogies fried or boiled. 

Baba&#39;s pierogies dough is made by using an old recipe so you are getting authenticity in each bite. The place has a few seats &amp; the decor, with several black &amp; white photos, is simple but beautiful. I loved the fabric sewn into the booths &amp; I liked how they engraved the corner of their tables with the business name."

I LOVE pierogis and it was nice to find this place with a great assortment!! It&#39;s very cute inside but also a little small.  Lucky for us we arrived around 4pm, so it was empty! You can grab a spot to sit or order right away at the counter and then they will bring the food to you.  They have a nice variety of pierogis to choose from and you can pick fried or boiled.  They come in sizes of 5 or 9 pierogis.  We ordered potato and cheese, mac and cheese, jalape√±o, bacon cheddar and spinach and feta.  My favorite was the bacon cheddar and the spinach and feta was delicious.  My boyfriend enjoyed the jalape√±o and spinach and feta the most.  But we truly enjoyed them all! We also ordered the blueberry dessert pierogi which was nice! My boyfriend and me finished all of them, sizes of 5 of course! We also added caramelized onions and smoked bacon bits (delicious!).  For the extra toppings, you do get a good amount of them and then can add it onto whatever you would like.  We also overheard their salads are really good.  The only complaint was it was a hot summer day and we were all quite warm inside even though the AC appeared to be on.   Staff was friendly and the pierogis are handmade to order.  They do take some time to prepare and cook them so don&#39;t expect them to come out right away.  There was plenty of parking nearby as well when we got there.

By the following Sunday night, things had calmed down and there were only two other parties in the restaurant.

One of them - later revealed to be the sister of an owner - provided commentary and suggestions on our order. &#34;You have to get the bacon,&#34; she said. &#34;It is so good.&#34; She also told us that it was made with real pieces of bacon, not BacO&#39;s or some substitute.

Our party eventually grew to four, large enough that we were able to sample almost every kind of pirogie on the menu. My favorites were a mix of old and new, the farmer&#39;s cheese and the jalape√±o cheddar rising to the top. None were any less than fair, and each one improved with the mixture of sour cream, bacon and cheese that came as side dishes.

The large windows, walls decorated with a map of Europe helpfully showing the location of Slovakia and polished wooden counter tops confirm this isn&#39;t a traditional Slavic restaurant. That&#39;s a good thing, because there&#39;s no reason why Central Europe should be tagged with a frankly outdated image that comes from Communist times.

A couple suggestions for improvement. We came at twilight on a night particularly warm day, but the closed windows and lack of air conditioning led to it being boiling inside. Please work on the circulation! I&#39;d also suggest rethinking some of the sides, which weren&#39;t flavorful, lacking the sourness found in the best versions of the dish.

Very good, could be great."

These pierogies are GOOD.  My bf &amp; I ordered a mix of boiled &amp; pan fried pierogies with various fillings (mac &amp; cheese, jalapeno).  They were as good as I hoped they&#39;d be.  Next time I want to get more toppings.  We only ordered a side of sour cream.... not realizing that the pan fried varieties already come with that.  Oh well!  We also tried the kielbasa &amp; beet salad.  Both good but pierogies are where it&#39;s at.  We ended our meal with one of the dessert pierogies which really hit the spot. 

This place is a real gem though.  Highly recommended.  The decor is clean &amp; very appealing, the people are super nice &amp; the food is excellent!  We&#39;ll definitely be back-- many times!"

But also really rich and heavy, and a bit greasy to eat a lot of, so I couldn&#39;t finish all 9 pieces. I think 7 would have been the perfect size for me. Will definitely be back again.

Cute decor, branding, menu, presentation, etc."

These guys have the Eastern European treat perfected and it&#39;s available in a whole slew of great flavors.  I tried the Spinach &amp; Feta last night and was not disappointed.  They made them to order but it did not take long at all: 5 minutes, tops.  The carrot salad actually came out last!  My wife had the only vegan option available, sauerkraut, which she completely devoured.  While she chose to have her&#39;s boiled (tossed in butter and chives) I decided to go pan fried.  They seemed to be equally greasy (the boiled ones were drenched in butter), diminishing the health benefit of choosing one over the other.  The carrot salad tasted a lot like the Passover dish charoset, which was a pleasant surprise (gotta love those Eastern European traditions). What I found equally impressive about the establishment was the friendly service by people who you could tell truly cared about your experience at their establishment.  It&#39;s also worth mentioning the beautiful, bright decor, overall cleanliness (including a great restroom) and lemon lime water available at the front counter. Top it all off with environmentally friendly table ware and a menu that also features some authentic, non-pierogi items and you have yet another fine Brooklyn establishment you can&#39;t miss!"
