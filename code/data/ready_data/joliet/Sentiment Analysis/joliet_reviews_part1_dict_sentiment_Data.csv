The brunch buffet for our event was amazing &amp; delicious, lots of options, which I love! Our waiter was fantastic, give him props for dealing with 20 people pretty much by himself, they were very accommodating, and the price was just right! I can&#39;t say enough great things!

I should say we have only been there one time for this meal, but the service was good, the quality was good, and the quantity was more than adequate. I found it to be a very enjoyable meal. 

However my previous reviews on the other menu items, remain as stated.
I think the menu is 5 times larger than it should be, and I think that the owner would do better training his cooks to prepare a few meals well, rather than to assemble many, many Items poorly.

On another note, he has recently added a very large, a very bright; almost blinding, sign that when traveling past it at night, is annoying and almost dangerous.

I think that the owner would have done far better to use that money on hiring a consultant to downsize &amp; improve his menu.",03/09/16,90,3,2,4,20,3.0033000000000003,1.544,0.172,5.284,No,786

The new building is really nice and very comfortable and clean. Even though they were slammed for Sunday brunch, we were quickly seated. The bussers were fast and attentive, presenting us with cups of coffee and water immediately and keeping both topped off. Our server came and took our order quickly, but we never saw her again until she dropped off the check. If it weren&#39;t for the bussers, we would have been parched through our meal.

The food was better than average, but nothing particularly special. My wife and I agreed that we have had better pancakes, although these were good. The portions were sizable, but they should have been, since our bill was $29 for my wife&#39;s pancakes, bacon, and juice and my eggs, bacon, hash browns and coffee.

Friday&#39;s a fish fry heaven for those who look for a chuckload of fried favorites. Really good homey and traditional cabin dining feel plus you got a view of the fox river.

They serve breakfast the entire day and the price are very reasonable. Tried majority of the skillet combinations and they&#39;re very good. Just don&#39;t order for the pasta dishes since majority of the staff and maybe the cook are latinos unless you want your spaghetti tasting like salsa and taco spices. Eveything else is awesome though and did I say free dessert choices for any dinner orders (go for the pies)? Friday&#39;s are FishFry AYCE. I can only have enough fish and chips per meal, but you could substitute for a mash/bake potatoes if you want to mix it up. Some of the choices are cod, walleye, and perch. You can&#39;t switch to a different fish for every plate though and would need to stick with cod if you initially ordered cod. My personal favorite is perch, I find it more flavorful and lightly breaded. The broasted chicken is also a must try. Enough balance of crunch and moist on the chicken to go along with the mashed potatoes, the veggies are a little overcooked and not lightly steamed as I would prefer it.

The service is fast and they&#39;re very attentive to order details. Everyone&#39;s very friendly, like every knew each other. One time we accidentally left my son&#39;s ipad and they found it while cleaning up our table. The hostess kept it safe and I got it after an hour when in most cases it won&#39;t be returned.

Don&#39;t be fooled, they call themselves a diner, but there is nothing &#34;diner-ish&#34; about this place. It is a family restaurant through and through. But we love those so we still ate. Sunday afternoon, packed, which was a good sign.

First thing I noticed was how much real estate was wasted in here. They could easily fit a handful more tables and booths to ease with the wait times, and the counter (which has about 7 seats) was not being used. Why not? 15 people were waiting for a place to sit.

Prices are fairly steep, and this is the first time I&#39;ve ever had to pay to get fries with a burger. 

Speaking of, I got the &#34;Island Burger.&#34; Which they say is &#34;smothered&#34; in thousand island dressing. Sign me up! Turns out &#34;smothered&#34; here means 1/4 of my bun was lightly patted with dressing. How disappointing. Burger was average, fries were pretty good.

Its really hard for me to write this review because this was my favorite place to eat and now I don&#39;t think I will ever go back, seriously. They moved to a new building which is very beautiful but seems to have affected their food. Although the service is still great. I took my family out to eat which was about 8 of us. No one was really happy with their food but of course it was breakfast so we ate it and just decided not to go back. The home fries are cooked weird now, they are very hard on the outside and potatoes just aren&#39;t done on the inside. The pancakes that use to be amazing have changed and now they aren&#39;t as good, not nasty, just not that good. My brother asked for medium over easy eggs and he says they were barely cooked and he could barely eat them. I even stopped ordering my favorite chorizo frittata because the potatoes were hard inside and it just wasn&#39;t good and it was too expensive to order it and not eat. Im not sure if their griddle is messed up because the time before this we went they were having problems with their griddle so we gave them a pass on the food that wasn&#39;t very good, although they didn&#39;t offer a discount.

I know having omelettes so huge they&#39;re practically falling off the plate is a selling point in 2014&#39;s America... But for those of us with a normal body mass index, I wish I could pay less and just get a normal amount of food. This seems to be a common problem across most (all?) midwestern diners.

The reviews on the lower end of the spectrum are pretty on point with what I&#39;ve experienced. When you&#39;re making omelettes this huge, you&#39;ve got to overcook them. It&#39;s simple physics, as to get the inside of a 6&#34; wide omelette cooked you&#39;re going to have to overcook most of the outside. Again, back to normal sized food, and being able to cook it, well, normally.

I&#39;ve never tried anything outside of the breakfast menu, but know this is the kind of place that has EVERYTHING. Want some Chinese? They got it. Pasta? Got it. Seafood? Got it. This might contribute to why everything is so resoundingly mediocre, as how do you be a restaurant that has great stir fry, pasta, breakfast, steaks, salads, and more? If a chef exists that can knock each of those respective cuisines out of the park, chances are they wouldn&#39;t be working at a converted Pizza Hut in Aurora.

You can tell the clientele who go here truly don&#39;t care about this kind of stuff as they just want two days worth of food for a small amount of money. If that&#39;s your thing, you&#39;ll absolutely love the Riverview Diner.

The food? Yes its amazing! From the italian beef to the fish and all the appetizers! Home made potato chips and the milkshakes! French onion soup...Hell yeah!

Who cries about portion size? The more the merrier if you ask me specially with food this good!

The clientele seems to be mainly family and older folk but I see plenty young couples going too. Great place for a quiet date ;) lol.

The building is old and quirky with local businesses advertised all over the tables and coffee mugs. I ordered the patty melt with fries and a side of thousand island dressing. It was all cooked to order and tasted good. The thousand island tasted homemade and was really good. Troy got the 2+2+2 which was just 2 pancakes, 2 eggs &amp; 2 pieces of bacon. It looked average but the scrambled eggs did look nice and fluffy.  Alyssa got a salad (with no lettuce) that was brought to the table in a silver mixing bowl. I&#39;d never been here so I thought perhaps that was a quirky trait of theirs but apparently this was an error by the server who had &#34;just came back&#34; and she quickly returned it to the kitchen to be properly plated.
As for our server, she was attentive enough but extremely eccentric. Honestly, i think she was on drugs but she did a decent job so, to each their own.

New place is very nice, feels very comfortable &amp; clean and just a lot nicer than the old place that was in an old Pizza Hut location. Not that it matters as the food &amp; service is the main deal....but the new, much larger restaurant just is a lot nicer.
On the food, the breakfast&#39;s that I&#39;ve had are all very good---you order 2 eggs with any dish &amp; you get 4 when it&#39;s served!

I have probably had this choice maybe 6 times at this place and every time--- it is just flat-out delicious. Fries are perfect (great, traditional fries--not the &#39;double-crispy&#39; ones that a lot of restaurants have gone to for some reason that I HATE!) and always very hot &amp; fresh and the soups are equally tasty. As I said, breakfast&#39;s are always done very well and the only negative I could come up with here is that they only offer canned corned beef. But most places like this don&#39;t make fresh corned beef and I don&#39;t hold that against them since when you ask, at least the servers have always been honest about it &amp; tell you flat out---which is a major plus in my evaluations of places. You want fresh-made corned beef, you have to go to specialty restaurants like Walker Brothers up in northern Chicagoland or Buttermilk in Geneva--- which excel at their homemade corned beef.

A short update. As I dig the fish here, I have often remarked to Eleno the owner, that a &#34;Fish and Eggs&#34; special for breakfast might be a winner, as I have had that dish a bunch north of the Cheese Curtain.

My folks and their whole circle are faithful regulars. Came home to visit. We ate dinner there and I was pleasantly surprised by the wide array of menu options. I opted for their prime rib and it was a good 13oz lean thick portion above value. The sweet potato side was an excellent option for we health nuts, but their vegetables were canned. It would be ok to raise the price $1 or 2 for fresh vegetables. Also for the server to offer the horseradish sauce. I had to go to the front to request it. The place was half full and moderately busy. However, there were 3 servers and 2 other staff members/managers. Rounds for water, coffee, and checking up on customers was minimal. If the owner/manager can get their staff to be a bit more proactive, with a couple tweaks, this place will have a 5 star rating when I return in 4-5 months. Along with the new addition they are building, I have great expectations for them if they can get all of their staff up to speed with proactivity.

For the chicken and cod, it&#39;s $9.95, for the all-you-can-eat walleye, it was $12.95.  I went for the chicken, my best friend went for the cod.   Both were fantastic.  Next I will try the walleye.  

When he re-ordered the cod, the 2nd plate didn&#39;t come with two little bits like most places.  It was 4 or 5 nice thick pieces.  

It even comes with soup and a dessert, of which they had about 10 choices of pie (delicious), ice cream, and I think it was rice pudding.  Even the potato choices are insane...fries, baked, mashed, hash browns, sweet potatoes, home fries, maybe even another option or two.  Or you could even opt for mac n&#39; cheese!  There was a guy sitting next to me that had the mac n&#39; cheese and it looked delicious.  

I would recommend this place to Jesus, Mary, and Joseph if they found their way out to the SW burbs.  

Certainly a place that doesn&#39;t care about the bottom line.  It seemed to me like their biggest concern is repeat business.  And the line out the door this past Friday spoke volumes to that effect.

After a short wait, our massive portions arrived and all convos ceased - we meant business. I tore into the chicken which had crispy, flavorful skin with juicy white meat. My fries were standard fare, but delicious nonetheless. The cod came with homemade chips, and was replenished until we just couldn&#39;t take anymore.

Didn&#39;t like that the tacos had lettuce &amp; tomatoes rather than onions and cilantro, which is expected in Mexican eateries in caucasian areas.  The girl there said that onions, cilantro, and cheese were also in the tacos, but could barely make them out as it felt I was eating salad tacos.  

Pork burrito was a little better but was just average at best.  The flan and horchata ended up being the highlights of my meal.

I began to scan the area as i waited boy did it look filthy!! Tables that had food on them and dirty plates spilled pop on the tables.

I decided to hit the restroom to wash my hands and I seen that they had a warning sign up for wet floor not sure why until I went into the men&#39;s room.

It does look like they tried to up their game from old saltless fries to offering a variety of different spices that can be added, as well as expanding their combos with a big $4 meal menu.

But, even with all that, it was pretty lackluster.

I will say our server, Alex, was pretty good. Got everything right and got things out as quickly as the restaurants pace allowed.

I ordered the Chili Mac Supreme, the dish came out overflowing with noodles and all the fixings but ONE issue. There was a teaspoon full of chili in the actual dish. I asked the girl to maybe add a bit more, she did and the manager told her to tell me it would be extra.

Now I&#39;ve eaten this dish dozens of times because it is what I enjoy and I&#39;ve never had issue with the amount of Chili they put on it until today. The manager wouldn&#39;t budge so I asked her to take it off the receipt and I wasn&#39;t going to be eating dinner.

Our breakfast was fairly disappointing with the only good thing we ate was pancakes. For an extensive menu I would think there would be more consistency and a qualified breakfast cook. Service wasn&#39;t too bad and we were in and out in about 40 minutes. 

Our lunch experience was trouble from the start. Even though there was a clear line of customers waiting to be seated and we asked if they were taking names (rude response of &#34;No!?!&#34;) only one of the waitresses was seating customers and she would point to a random person in line and say &#34;how many?&#34; Then seating the party at a dirty table not yet cleaned from the previous customers. Truly unprofessional. It took forever for our waitress to show up and tables seated after us had ordered drinks and food so I went to find a manager. The manager was running the drive thru and quickly asked where we were seated and said &#34;OK&#34; as she turned and walked away. No &#34;sorry&#34; and she never checked back on our situation. I don&#39;t know what it was her job to manage but she clearly wasn&#39;t managing a thing in the dining room or paying attention to the lines of people waiting to be seated or those waiting to pay at the register. Our food was awful. My chili was actually cold, watery, and the cheese never melted. When I mentioned this to our waitress she said she&#39;d take it off the bill. As the chili was my substituted item in place of fries we only saw a $.70 cent savings. She never offered to replace it with a hot one or offer one to go. Others at the table had an overcooked but cold Frisco melt, warm but greatly undercooked fries, and cold onion rings. The service was so slow I did see one set of customers leave after waiting too long for their food (they left without paying for their drinks or complaining) and our total time in the restaurant was a long hour and twenty minutes. 

The restroom was fairly clean on both visits and the entrance and parking lot were clean on also.

Because she barely stopped at our table, we had to use the one napkin the set of silverware was wrapped in for both of us.

And then I got the food home and found out it was not even what I had ordered. (The wife eats a Chili Mac, they gave us a Chili 3 Way. I&#39;m not familiar with these and cant tell the difference, but apparently there is quite a significant difference between the two.)

In the 10 days that I was visiting family, we ate there three times.  On our first visit, it was three egg vegetable omelet, bacon, fruit and a turkey reuben.  Second time, was a breakfast burrito with onions, sausage, cheese and peppers and eggs benedict.  Lastly we sampled the belgian waffle and roast turkey panini with avocado, bacon, pepper jack cheese, spinach and chipoltle mayo.

The sides like the hash browns and fries were excellent.  Hot, not greasy, and nicely crisped.  The russian dressing on the reuben and the spicy mayo on the panini, were especially good.  It was nice that both came in separate containers so that you could control how much of the spread went on.

Our server took 7 minutes to approach our table.  She brought the soup,  but no crackers..when we were completely done with our soup, we had to ask a hostess to find her, as she had disappeared.  Server claims they ran out of rolls, and they just got some in...she cocked an attitude as well.

I came here expecting 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag Joe Pesci and got Casino De Niro.  I mean wow, just blown away.  You wouldn&#39;t think that this unassuming place (which despite their good effort still looks like a gas station) would have one of the best Italian subs this Yelper has had in quite some time.

I had the underboss, and it did not disappoint.  The sandwich was as perfectly crafted as the Sistine Chapel with the perfect ratio of meat to cheese to toppings to oil to I&#39;m salivating now just thinking about it.  There were a minimum of six other sandwiches that I NEED to try and a few others that caught my interest.  They have hot sandwiches too, not just the awesome deli ones.

There are also some good looking sides/salads.  I had a broccoli pasta salad that was simple yet tasty.  But there were a couple others that looked just as good.  

There were a couple cannolis there, but literally a couple.  Two wrapped together in plastic wrap.  I didn&#39;t get one, but if they have better packaging next time I&#39;m there I won&#39;t be stopped.

The only thing to note of this place is that you have to pull into the right side of the building when you pull into the parking lot.  You can&#39;t park in from and they don&#39;t have it blocked off.  Depending on the time of day it can be a pain to pull around to the other , Proper, side of the building as you can&#39;t pull through.  But that is a minor complaint once you get this food in your face.",28/12/12,151,5,2,4,43,3.8969000000000005,3.335,0.616,14.049,No,1485

I loved this dish and my hubby loved his turkey cutlets. The dishes quickly reheat in a microwave and are packaged in compostable containers. Some may get two meals out of one dish--but I ate every bit of the Beef! Each dish comes with a dessert of three French madeleines (cookies).

The atmosphere is solid but it can be a little noisy at times. There are plenty of TV&#39;s to watch if you come during a sports event. Plenty of beers to choose from including both bottled and on draft. The only reason I&#39;m knocking a star off is because the quality of the pizza changed in the last few months. I used to be a regular when they would have their pizza specials because they were so delicious, but more recently they have become somewhat tasteless.

It&#39;s nice that they have so many handles but honestly didn&#39;t have a great selection. I&#39;m noticing the trend that places are installing many handles for impression sake, but true craft beer lovers know the difference between many handles of average beer and that of quality. They had Californian Laguanitas, and 3 Sheep from Wisconsin. They also had beer from a nearby brewery in Lemont. Other than these, nothing else very interesting. They did have a nice Whiskey selection. We went on a Tuesday night and it was semi-noisy.

We&#39;ve been back maybe a dozen more times as we live about 5 minutes from here. The hours are a little odd because they don&#39;t open until 4PM. The same people own the Southern Belle breakfast place right next to it.

The food has always been consistent. The service has always been great with the exception of one server who gets confused pretty easily. The bartenders know what they&#39;re doing and are usually willing to give samples if there are any questions about certain taps. The beer selection started off really varied and interesting but has since devolved into a hop lovers paradise with not much in the way of lighter brews (pilsners, lagers, etc.). That&#39;s fine for me but my wife isn&#39;t a fan of bitter beer (her words) so she&#39;s hoping they come around.

There are about 15 seats at the bar, maybe 6 hi-tops that seat 4 each and 8 or 9 low tables that can be pushed together for groups. 22 large screen TVs mean everybody gets a view if they want to see whatever sports game is showing. Restrooms are clean and large. Like every other place in Joliet and Crest Hill there are 4 or 5 gaming machines along one wall.

The pizza here was a nice surprise as are the wings, stuffed jalepenos and mushrooms, and grinder sandwiches. all excellent. The burgers, wraps, salads,etc are all good. We haven&#39;t tried the pasta dishes.

We&#39;ll probably be somewhat regulars as long as they can make it with those limited hours...",08/01/15,169,4,2,5,17,4.4356,3.0900000000000003,0.546,14.364999999999998,No,1539

Drinks: come for the great beer and whiskey selection.  24 rotating mostly American microbrews and 100+ in bottles. Extensive collection of whiskey: at least 80 bottles of bourbon, rye, Scotch, Irish and the like. Tasty cocktails too if that&#39;s your thing. 

Food: the food is probably my favorite pub food in the area, but can lack consistency. The burgers are a generous 10oz with tons of choices for toppings. My favorites: Ring of Fire (spicy and delicious), Like a Rolling Stone (can&#39;t go wrong with bacon and a fried egg) and Revolution (cherry peppers, avocado and onion straws). Wings, apps and pizza are great too. 

People: staff is (mostly) great. Seen a few good and not so good ones come and go since the beginning, but overall I love these people. Especially the bartenders and manager/owner Nick.

Cool interior but the food was just average. Thought the meals were overpriced for what you get. The grilled cheese for $10 was a total joke and maybe worth half that.

Only difference is I got the combo and the Italian sausage was the only thing that saved the homemade beef to add any flavor.  I hadn&#39;t eaten here since the 70&#39;s.  I think going away from Scala&#39;s beef was a way to control food cost but it just doesn&#39;t taste how I remember it.

Food both fries and combo came out SUPER hot so little chance of any foodborne illness here.  I wanted to try the saganaki squares but wasn&#39;t that hungry.  Plus an abundance of salt on fries kept me from eating many as my sodium levels probably went through the roof.  The air conditioning is clearly failing as it was over 80 degrees inside on a 89 degree day.

Very nice people here and I want to like them more.  At least they are getting an award from Vienna next week.  Maybe I should have just gotten a dog.

I was on my way home from visiting a friend and decided to stop here for lunch. It looked like a cool, divey burger joint and I thought there was no way the food could be bad. I was actually pretty excited. Perhaps my excitement is why this place is only getting three stars. It just didn&#39;t live up to my expectations. I got the burger and looked furiously for the burger. It wasn&#39;t easily seen and there was supposed to be 2 patties. When I bit in I was relieved to find they in fact did NOT forget my patty, but honestly it wasn&#39;t all that impressive. It was mostly just a big hunk of lettuce with mustard and ketchup and I&#39;ve had a million better burgers at little burger joints like this.

In Chicago (back in the black and white days) I would get my food and sit on the curb in between two parked cars. This is a pretty big upgrade.

Good beefs. I ordered mine with hot and Lisa&#39;s with hot and sweet.. also a couple of orders of fries. When I say good, I mean they taste good, but unlike Portillos.. they actually fill the bun with meat.  This is not my first rodeo at Flips so I&#39;ve got some familiarity with the food. They forgot to put the hot peppers on Lisa&#39;s beef, she was a little disappointed, but I was already home. They have OK fries.. kind of your standard frozen fries, cooked crispy.

I&#39;ve never tried their Gyros and thought their burgers were good, but not special.

I don&#39;t know what it is about that sign that flippin bugs the crap out of me. They&#39;ve selectively covered over a part of the sign on Roosevelt... I dont know if used to say &#34;Scala&#39;s&#34; Beef.. or what. And if they used to use Scala... now what?**

flips-glen-ellyn-2,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,xcvN4uzRWuC6aDe2vk13hA,"To celebrate my one year anniversary of being on Yelp I decided to do a review update for a place that I reviewed one year ago today.

On my very first day on Yelp I put up a whole bunch of reviews from collected notes of visiting hot dog stands throughout Chicagoland. One of them was Flips Beef &amp; Hot Dogs in Glen Ellyn. Since I put up that initial review the way I&#39;ve been writing has changed, and I figured this would be a good place to revisit and see if the food quality had improved since my first review and to provide a more in depth analysis of the food.

First off let me go over the establishment itself, Flips is a small little restaurant with a few tables set up on the inside. There are a few TVs so customers can watch ESPN while eating, and for when the weather is nice some outside tables with umbrellas. There&#39;s also a ledge with stools set up to eat at right across from the main order counter. The main order counter is where you can see the menu board, and place your order, and even see your food prepared if you&#39;re so inclined. In visiting Flips again I decided to go for a hot dog and fries.  

The hot dog I received on my most recent visit came on a somewhat dry non-poppy seed bun. There was a pickle spear on it that was fairly thick though not particularly sour. There were two somewhat wet and mushy tomato slices on the dog along with two sport peppers that combined in length were not long enough to cover the entire hot dog itself. This meant that I didn&#39;t get sport pepper flavor in every bite. There was a decent amount of mustard on this dog, the onion and relish were a little light. The sausage itself was a skinless frank, it was well heated. The overall taste was decent but the bun was dry and the tomato and pickle flavor really overpowered the rest of the balanced. I wound up having to take those two items off to finish the second half of the dog. 

I also decided to go for some fries here, they have thick and greasy fries. On the positive side, they&#39;re very crisp on the outside with a nice potato paste inside. On the negative side they are super salty and greasy. Ketchup almost has to be used to sweeten up the incredibly potency of the salting of these fries. 

Overall my experience with Flip&#39;s left me feeling it&#39;s still slightly below average. The time to get my food was more than one might expect, and the food was a little below average. I&#39;ve had some other items here over the years such as burgers, gyros and chicken sandwiches, but I haven&#39;t had them recently enough to detail my experience properly to incorporate into this review. I&#39;m going to stick with my original rating of two stars, but it&#39;s possible a second updated review may come along at some point touching on the gyros, subs or something else there.",04/05/13,306,2,2,4,39,3.3070000000000004,1.384,0.237,23.379000000000005,No,2823

In 1997 the burger, gyros, hot dogs and other stuff were all very good. From 2002-2004 they were still very good, in 2011 the gyros salad and plate were still great as well, but the burger was no longer good, nor was the hot dog or the beef. 

That being said, when I was there last year in November the service had really gone down hill along with the rudeness of the cashier and the cleanliness of the place. The bathroom was out of toilet paper and there was leaking water in there, the table that I sat at, had not been cleaned under-neath the table, there were fries, relish, and pickle under-neath the table and the top was sticky from who sat that before, yes they have surveillance cameras in the restaurant but the person who does the cleaning was not paying attention to the inside of the restaurant or to the bathroom, It was the middle of the afternoon and there were no orders ahead of me and it took way to long for a gyros, the person at the table next to me said his hot dog was not good and that his wife hated her burger and they will not be coming back. 

I ordered a gyros with fries, the gyros was dried out, the pita bread was stale, the fries were over-cooked on the outside, and very mushy on the inside, greasy and way too salty, I will not be coming back here and I will stick to eating my gyros at Jester&#39;s in Elgin whose quality has not diminished over time.",01/02/14,147,2,1,0,9,-0.7381999999999997,0.46900000000000003,0.36800000000000005,5.163,No,1519

The beef  is definitely not a hidden gem like someone else said, but a little above average.  Not even close to being as good as Johhnie&#39;s, Portillo&#39;s, or Mr. Beef.  I guess some people can&#39;t tell the difference between a good Italian Beef sandwich and a great/amazing one, or they own the place and are lying to get business.  I might be back to try other items on the menu, but I&#39;m not in a hurry.  I hope I just forget about this place.  The Gyro sounds good from reviews, but the beef sounded great in many reviews also.

There are 2 different listings for this business.  I think the other listing has more accurate reviews.  This listing has too many people commenting on how good the Italian Beef is.  The other listing talks mainly about the Gyro&#39;s.  I&#39;ll try the Gyro someday.

My Top 5 Italian Beef Sandwiches:

1.  Mr. Beef &amp; Pizza (Harlem and Irving)

2.  Mr. Beef (Orleans Street in downtown Chicago, not related to Mr. Beef &amp; Pizza from my knowledge.) 

3.  Johnnie&#39;s (Elmwood park, Arlington Heights)  

4.  Portillo&#39;s (Great flavor, but I don&#39;t like the aftertaste, something about it, has slowly been making it&#39;s way down my list)

5.  Al&#39;s Beef (It keeps growing on me every time I have it.  I did not like it the first time because it was different.)

Consolation Prizes:  These places all have above average beef sandwiches in my mind.  I will list as many as I can remember.

Their service is pretty fast (even during peak times) and the staff is VERY friendly. They normally have ESPN on TV while you wait (nice touch I&#39;d say). Food is very good as it relates to fast food. While it is small, it&#39;s also clean. Parking can also be at a premium during peak times. This is another place I&#39;ve heard students (college) speak well of so that&#39;s another good sign. 

1. The place is pretty small so things can get tight during peak (lunch &amp; dinner). 

2. As far as the eats:
a. Cheeseburgers are very good. One thing that gets me is when places put more lettuce  on the burger than meat. That&#39;s not the case here. Made fresh and fast.
b. While not one of my top gyros, it&#39;s still very good. On some of my recent visits, I noticed that people put the sauce on the side. Not a deal breaker but worth noting. 
c. SOLID patty melt (I&#39;m a bit fan of grilled onions on my burger). 
d. I had the roast beef sub once and I may want to try it again. When I&#39;ve gone here, I&#39;ve been in the mood for a hot sandwich. I liked it. 
e. The beef sandwich is a hidden gem. 

3. One minor complaint (and it&#39;s minor). One trend I&#39;ve noticed is that places are going the McDonald&#39;s meals route of #1, #2, etc. Flips does the same things. As a rule of thumb, I don&#39;t eat fries often (I try to limit my high glycemic food intake). If you take the fries out, I want to say the price drops about $.50. Not much of a drop pricewise.

Flip&#39;s looks like your typical divey burger and gyro joint, but they were pretty damn good. The outside decor is kinda fun and offbeat: they had sculptures of lions and deer on the outside with really funk and mismatched patio furniture, which I thought was fun. The inside has a long counter you can eat at and a few tables, but it really is a small joint, so don&#39;t expect to find seating for a huge crowd.

Tonight was the first night that my boyfriend and I had ever been there: I got the polish sausage meal and he got the italian combo. I loved my meal, although it was little on the charred side.

The lady who rang us up was a total sweetheart: she was very nice and polite. The cooking line amazed me with how fast they got us our food and seemed like nice enough guys.

I went here for the yelp check-in special of 20% your order, which was higher than anyone else was offering. You get a lot for your money, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be returning. Nothing personal about them, but their large menu isn&#39;t very extensive. Well, that depends on what you want. If you want 6 different variations of hot dogs or hamburgers, then fine. They didn&#39;t have a single patty hamburger, or a crispy chicken sandwich. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, and it was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before. I did like the spicy option, and the sauce was very good, but the chicken itself was gyro style. It was chopped up in slivers and served on a bun, and I&#39;m not sure how I feel about that. Their chocolate shakes are pretty gross. Very little chocolate, and I&#39;m pretty sure I took a lot of wax from my mouth while drinking the shake. It had an abundance of waxy chunks.

Flip&#39;s is basically just your average Chicago style hot dog stand. I&#39;m a connoisseur of Italian beefs, and I like to try up different spots.

The fries were pretty decent, but I don&#39;t come for the fries. 

I&#39;d still give Flip&#39;s a shot in the future, but I&#39;m gonna give it a 2/5 simply because the beef was so tasteless, I&#39;d rather get a pre-packaged, oven roasted beef sandwich from Rosati&#39;s.

I have been coming to this place for a while now.  This is by far my favorite shawarma joint!  Today did not disappoint either!

Today, I order shawarma with fries and a drink, as well as an Israeli (it might be called something else now) salad.  Let me start with shawarma, it was excellent, the meat was perfectly cooked, moist and soft chicken!  I took it in the pita.  Usually they put Israeli salad inside as well.  It was a perfect ratio of meat to salad!

The fries looked like home made chips, which I personally prefer!  And they actually made it home with me without getting too saggy.  Delicious!

The Israeli salad was actually a nice size for a side salad and had plenty of different veggies in it!  Definitely worth the money!

Overall an A+ experience!

You choose to start with either a pita, rice bowl, or salad bowl then choose your meat (chicken shawarma, steak shawarma, or falafel), garnishes (chopped salad, purple cabbage salad, sumac onions, and/or pickles), and sauces (tahini, garlic, amba, s&#39;khug, and/or harissa).  

I tried their salad bowl with chicken shawarma.  I really love the flavor of the chicken.  It was fresh, tender, and juicy.  The crunch of the salad was a great accompany to the meat.  If that was enough, the side a pita they provided was heavenly.  It was soft, warm, and had a nice chew.  The portion sizes here are very generous, so come with a hungry tummy.

I decided to check out the restaurant with her and let my taste buds have some adventure.  The ambiance is casual and comfortable.  It&#39;s not so loud so carrying a conversation is easy.  

I have had the Kefta Pita which is a freshly made pita stuffed with very well seasoned ground meat, hummus, chopped salad, and sumac onions.  The combination is very delicious, but messy as the garlic sauce drips.  Be prepared to wipe your hands periodically.  I received one side dish and decided to get the Naf Fries.  This was awesome.

The cashiers are all very pleasant to talk to and very patient when I asked them what is good.  I have been advised that questions such as, &#34;What do you like to eat here, or what is good here?&#34; are all very annoying questions.  So, when I asked those questions to them, they were prepared with an answer and how they answered was in a friendly tone.  I&#39;m impressed by their willingness to entertain my questions.

I ordered the chicken schwarma plate (add a couple falafel) and he ordered the falafel pita. The prices were a little higher than I remembered, however I went home with a huge amount of leftovers for the next day. The plate will run about $12 depending on which one you pick. The plate comes with your choice of protein, rice, cucumber/tomato salad and a pita. There are also a few sauce choices that are left out so you can pick and choose. My favorite was the green. It had a little bit of a kick but the cucumber salad cooled my mouth down. 

The food is fresh so it&#39;ll take a few minutes for it to cook. Ours took about 15 minutes. You&#39;ll get a beeper and they&#39;ll buzz you when it&#39;s ready.

NafNaf is to middle eastern food what Chipotle is to Mexican food. 
It&#39;s a healthy alternative to fast food for sure.  It&#39;s good quality and everything on the menu is safe for just about any person&#39;s tastes.  Just don&#39;t get too excited about this being any sort of authentic experience, it&#39;s not.... 
Somewhere like Pita Paradise in Carol Stream is much more authentic and the dishes will all have better depth to them while staying in the same price range. 
But, if you&#39;re an average suburbanite looking for something different for lunch, or if you&#39;re looking for something &#34;ethnic but not too ethnic &#34; then NafNaf is great.

If you&#39;re hungry, don&#39;t think twice - just go here.  If you want great food but don&#39;t feel like paying over $10 - just go here.  What&#39;s that?  You&#39;ve bought into the hype of all these reviews and now you practically live off of Naf Naf shawarma and pita bread?

Ok but who am I kidding, most of the food is here probably great for you and you definitely won&#39;t get sick of it ever.  Some of the best pita ever.  Check.  Perfectly seasoned and grilled meat.  Check.  Lentil soup, which is probably one of the healthiest (disregard sodium) and tastiest soups you can get anywhere.  Check.

I ordered chicken schwarma which was a giant portion (at least 1/2lb of meat) - it was nicely spiced and not oily. My meal came with 2 sides so I picked salad (fresh and tasty) and rice (again, a giant amount).

I was here on a weekend vacation and stayed with local family and we came here for my last dinner before departing and oh my goodness it was so so spectacular! My uncle ordered the falafel on the plate, I got the beef tenderloin on a plate, and my aunt got the Israeli salad with a side of hummus. All meals come with your choice of two sides (hummus, fries, Israeli salad), yummy garlicky tahini, and a basket of warm, delicious, soft squishy made-fresh-on-site pita. I was blown away. I think of myself as a Mediterranean connoisseur and I&#39;ve never had squishy fluffy pita. I&#39;ve always had the flattened kind that&#39;s unleavened but this was. Ah. May. Zing. 

Green spicy sauce for the taking along with homemade pickles. They look like typical dill pickles but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re a nice salty palate cleanser. So good.

I was here on a weekend vacation and stayed with local family and we came here for my last dinner before departing and oh my goodness it was so so spectacular! My uncle ordered the falafel on the plate, I got the beef tenderloin on a plate, and my aunt got the Israeli salad with a side of hummus. All meals come with your choice of two sides (hummus, fries, Israeli salad), yummy garlicky tahini, and a basket of warm, delicious, soft squishy made-fresh-on-site pita. I was blown away. I think of myself as a Mediterranean connoisseur and I&#39;ve never had squishy fluffy pita. I&#39;ve always had the flattened kind that&#39;s unleavened but this was. Ah. May. Zing. 

Green spicy sauce for the taking along with homemade pickles. They look like typical dill pickles but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re a nice salty palate cleanser. So good. 

Would love if this small chain would explode and open branches to replace every single Taco Bell and McDonald&#39;s in the U.S. but yknow, life can&#39;t make that much sense right? Ha! 

Two entrees, side of hummus, and main size Israeli salad with side fixins- Our meal was $30 with one medium drink. I even asked for taboule salad AND Israeli salad instead of hummus or fries (trying to stay away from carbs... Except that damn tasty pita!!!) and they happily made the exchange! No problem!

Being a vegetarian stinks at times, but Naf Naf grill I may never tired of. Their falafel and pita bread are the best around. I can honestly say no other place compares. The falafel is always fresh and the perfect texture. The pita bread is like little clouds of heaven. The pita bread is so fluffy and soft, I&#39;d gladly make myself a life size pita blanket :) The garlic sauce is so good. I&#39;m not sure what they mixed together to make it, but I dip everything in it when I&#39;m there.

My big irritation though is their fries. Before I proceed, they are not fries, they are like chips. Simply put, they are soggy chips. It&#39;s like they dipped them in warm oil, dried them a little and threw them together. My way around this is to ask for them extra crispy. Once they get the extra crispy memo they are perfect though!

- Food is fresh and made to order, always love places that hide nothing - all cooking done in front of you
- Staff all seemed nice and had a sense of urgency to get you your food quickly and accurately
- Priced well, you&#39;ll spend more than typical fast food but the value is there for the money (~$12 a platter)
- The shwarma is great, but takes a bit longer so if you are starving get something else
- Hummus is excellent, and the bread is fresh and tasty",21/09/14,71,4,1,2,9,1.5856,0.499,0.047,1.454,No,570

I really do wish I could give them a better review but I can&#39;t. Overall, their BBQ is &#34;famous&#34; because, well, they&#39;re the only BBQ place around being that Darien isn&#39;t exactly (ok or even close) to the BBQ capital of the world. 

Inside and out this place is confusing. Is it an old VFW hall? A former funeral home? Obviously they&#39;re just as confused since they call themselves a &#34;Mexican, Barbecue, Southern&#34; restaurant. More like none of the above. Their breakfast is great I&#39;ll give them that. If you&#39;re not here for breakfast well I&#39;d suggest taking your money and appetite elsewhere. 

As for lunch, dinner, and their so called &#34;late night menu&#34; everything I&#39;ve tried is bland and boring to those who don&#39;t live within a three mile radius of this place. My most memorable experience here was when I ordered from their &#34;late night&#34; menu (it was 10:15pm that&#39;s hardly late night but whatever) and I ordered the wings. The wings come with celery, which I can&#39;t stand, so I asked if I could have some carrots instead. Our waiter did the best he could so no offense to him BUT THE KITCHEN DIDN&#39;T HAVE CARROTS! How does a kitchen that specializes in not one, not two, but three cuisines fail to have carrots? Especially when they&#39;re supposed to be in your salads!

For example, they have beers from Miskatonic, Buckledown, Pollyanna, Lagunitas, and Revolution to name a few. 

My past few dining experiences at Chuck&#39;s have been positive. My go-to entree is the pulled chicken sandwich. It is always tender; you could basically eat it without teeth. A while back, Chuck&#39;s had a fried mac and cheese appetizer, which was outstanding. It came in the form of big fried balls. For some reason, this is no longer on the menu. I would really like to see the fried mac and cheese return. Uncle Bub&#39;s, a BBQ restaurant in Westmont similar to Chuck&#39;s, has the fried mac and cheese balls and they are a favorite of mine. When I had Chuck&#39;s fried mac and cheese, I found it considerably better than Uncle Bub&#39;s. So I recommend bringing it back. 

The dining area is spacious and classy. There is plenty of seating, from booths to tables to the bar. They also have a nice electronic board that updates the beers on tap. This is situated in the dining room. On the walls are logos from breweries, including many that are local.

We were given a generous amount of drink tickets, good for sample pours of beer from local breweries (Goose Island, Urban Legend, Ten Ninety, Church Street, Buckle Down, Gordon Biersch, Exit Strategy, Lagunitas, and more!) and wine from Cooper&#39;s Hawk.  This event was a beer snob&#39;s paradise.  My favorite beer of the night was the Apricot Ale from Ten Ninety Brewing, located in Glenview.  I also used a lot of my tickets on the Sparkling Almond Wine from Cooper&#39;s Hawk.

A generous amount of food was served buffet-style by Chuck&#39;s including pulled pork sliders, chicken tenders (spicy and Korean style), two soups (corn chowder and a green chile soup), and staff served passed trays of mini chicken and pork nachos.  The corn chowder was my favorite, served with cubes of Mexican cheese and dusted with a sprinkling of chili powder.  Everything was very good.

We ate at the other Chuck&#39;s location, in Burbank, and I wasn&#39;t impressed, but I really liked the food served here, so I wouldn&#39;t discount Chuck&#39;s for another visit.

The event was held in the banquet hall which is much more impressive inside than it is on the outside.  The hall is lovely, really mostly a blank canvass for your creative mind, with elegant chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.

chucks-southern-comforts-cafe-darien-2,Angus W.,HtewfIDJCsL3b4AY0Ukefg,#NAME?,"We went to the original Chucks years ago and thought it was pretty great. I was excited for it to open closer to home.. and here it is.

We first visited the Darien location about a year and a half ago.. it was OK but I thought that we needed to give it another try to see if that just OK experience was indicative of the location.. or just a blip on the radar. Obviously this experience kept us from rushing back.

We walked in just before noon on a Sunday.. I was having a &#34;man-date&#34; (his daughters terminology, not mine) with my old buddy Mark who was in town for a couple of days.

We walked in at 11:50 and they said that they wouldn&#39;t be seating for lunch for 10 minutes.. no biggie... Mark and I have a lot of catching up to do.. half an hour later.. we are still the only people waiting so we check with the hostess.. they forgot about us and seated us right away.

I&#39;m not a big fan of their gumbo, it&#39;s more of a seafood chowder to me, that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not good.. I just prefer a style more similar to Heaven on Seven.. with a thick roux, Andouille and a small mound of white rice. So I got their Chucks Red which is a really tasty chili and worth the trip.

Mark got the gumbo, thought it was OK.. wished he&#39;d gotten the Chuck&#39;s Red too. He made the gumbo one of his three choices for the BBQ sampler. He thought the ribs were really good and the Hot Link was excellent when it was hot (I tasted it, yum) but lost something as the temperature cooled.

It was Sunday and the special of the day is Mexican pot Roast... you don&#39;t have to ask me twice!

When it came out, I was a bit disappointed.. it&#39;s not the prettiest dish in the world. Fortunately, I approached this with an open mind.. because it was pretty damn delicious. The potatoes were mashed with cheese in them (yum) and the mixed veggies were more like stuffing veggies. Everything was swimming in the Au Jus and was terrific as is.. BUT! I had me some fresh tortillas and when I made some Pot Roast/Mashed Potato Tacos.. that pretty much sealed the deal! Also, as a side note there was virtually no fat on the meat.

So, Mark was a little disappointed in his food. Mine was quite good. He was shocked that my food was quite a bit less expensive than his.

I don&#39;t love the atmosphere at this spot either, it&#39;s not indicative of the style of food. But I think that&#39;s a function of the location doing a lot of catering and events.

Hot sauces (had to ask for them) are the El Yucateco brand, good sauces.. they brought out all three and I immediately went for the Hottest one (That&#39;s the one that is NOT brightly colored) I like these and they are acceptable.. it would be fun if they offered some sauces to try that I can&#39;t buy at the local Jewel.",29/08/15,292,3,1,4,1,3.8543000000000007,2.773,1.35,19.877,No,2794

I mean fried chicken, BBQ and so forth. Well, Chuck&#39;s Southern Comforts Cafe is here to deliver, with a range of southern and Cajun treats to nourish you. 

Oddly enough, the feller and I didn&#39;t even go with the most southern stuff on the menu. Well, we did start out with a special of some sort of Cajun-spiced shrimp, which were indeed spicy as advertised, and we retained the plate to keep mopping up the sauce with the little twisted footballs of bread that were provided. 

He went more southern than me and got the gumbo, which did indeed have okra in it (a point of contention among gumbo-eaters: I lived in New Orleans and have listened to this argument many times -- is it real gumbo without okra in it?! Well, this was real, and really tasty, according to himself.)

What appealed to me that night was the Caesar salad, with an unusual jalapeno-lime dressing (again, spicy!), with grilled chicken added. usually a Caesar is just a Caesar, but the dressing added a fun zip that was different and memorable. 

Our waitress Ariel was friendly and fun and took good care of us. We had a back booth that was quieter as it was tucked away from the more bustling area of the restaurant, overall it was pretty busy.

This place was pretty empty for lunch so I&#39;m curious as to why everything took so long. However, the wood paneling and low, yellow lighting gave the place a southern feel authentic enough to convince someone who has no real experience of the south (me).

Everything is super down home southern comfort food so if you&#39;re on a diet, congratulations you played yourself. The menu enormous so we asked the waitress to suggest something to us and she proceeded to recommend like 20 dishes. Thanks bro. She also wasn&#39;t great with describing the food to us; we were pretty new to the world of complex meat orders. It took us maybe ten minutes to decide what we wanted, eventually opting to split mozzarella sticks and a BBQ combo of a half rack of ribs + pulled pork. 

The mozzarella sticks arrived in good time and were delightful as deep-fried cheese-centered sin bombs always are. The main order took some time. We both ordered sides of Mac &#39;n&#39; Cheese, and it was like a sticky cheesy little bowl of heaven A+. I don&#39;t know what possessed me to pour barbecue sauce over it but it happened and I have regrets. Pulled pork was decent but the portion was rather small. I will admit to knowing very little about ribs, but these ribs were AMAZING and I couldn&#39;t get enough. gooooooood shit, but only a half rack :( that combo meal definitely did not last as long as we had hoped, so we looked at ordering some more.

 We had some questions about the rib tips since neither of us had ever had them, and the waitress again proved less than useful, rattling off information that was already on the menu and clearly insufficient for meat noobs such as ourselves. She also failed to tell us anything relevant about the barbecue sauce, saying the North Carolina sauce was a vinegar-based sauce in which the vinegar could not be tasted. we had already tried the sweet mesquite sauce, and she vehemently described the mild sauce as &#34;mild&#34;. We went with the NC, which, for the record, was quite vinegary. Also, rib tips are good but super fatty, even in comparison to the rest of the food here.

Server seemed to be very attentive to get our order but after that he seem to disappear into oblivion.   We waited about an hour to get seated and once we were it was at a table right next to the bar which made talking kind of hard as it was extremely loud inside.  My husband had jambalaya with shrimp and the portion was large.  He said it was very spicy like he likes and enjoyed it very much.  I got the beef brisket dinner and while the brisket was tender , juicy and just the right amount of smoke the sides were ehhhhhhh ok.  The green beans were good but the Mac and cheese was really dry and bland..did they even put cheese in it???? 

Would we go back, yes to try some other items and probably go at lunch time so it&#39;s not so crowded.

I was impressed by the beer and cocktail list- they really have a good thing going there!

As for food, it was good, but I&#39;ve had better BBQ at Q in La Grange. I had a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and mac n cheese. The pork was tender, but I found the sauce too sweet. The mac and cheese was creamy, but it tasted like it was made with some kind of cheap american cheese or something. The potato salad was a little sour, I like mine a little sweeter. The food was 3 stars, but the service and drink selection bumped it up to 4 for me. I&#39;d give it another go!",01/02/16,101,4,2,5,35,4.4302,2.059,0.0,8.940999999999999,No,823

The bartender seemed attentive. I ordered a beer and was served immediately. I finished that beer and waited 10-15minutes for the bartender to return and see if my friends and I needed another drink. This wouldn&#39;t have bothered me as much but there were two employees behind the bar and exactly 8 patrons sitting at the bar. To add to my frustration I had to sit there parched as I watched these two employees eating behind the bar right in front of everyone. I really don&#39;t want to complain because I like Chucks. The food is good and beer selection is excellent. Towards the end of our visit the bartender returned and felt compelled to tell me how she felt about my mustache. She asked me why I was growing a mustache to which I explained that it was November and I was doing it in an effort to raise awareness for prostate cancer. She didn&#39;t like my mustache, no big deal, but she explained, and I quote, &#34;you look like a pedophile&#34;! That was it for me. We left shortly after that. Between the terrible service and being ridiculed and harassed, i will never support Chucks in Darien again. It&#39;s a shame because I liked this place and have been there many times.

We had a bridal shower for my daughter here and I&#39;m so glad we did.  We were allowed in to the room early in order to decorate.  We had plenty of tables for gifts and other decorations and the seating was perfect.  The banquet room is HUGE but they have dividers that section off your room according to the number of people you have.  They started serving right on time, bringing out the salads first, followed by mashed potatoes, smoked chicken, pulled pork, mac &#39;n cheese and warm rolls and butter.  (The Ranch dressing was spectacular.)  The wait staff was very polite and attentive and the banquet manager stopped in often to see how things were going and if we needed anything.  The dessert was apple cobbler with ice cream which everyone loved.  

When we booked this venue, we had many choices for our menu and they can serve it plated or family style.  We chose family style since it does promote conversation.

Granted, it is a little strange that when you enter, to the left is a banquet hall called Chateau Orleans Banquets.  Last night there was a wedding reception there, this afternoon, a bridal expo.  Go right.  There is a huge bar area with TVs and then seating that includes high top tables, booths, and regular height tables.  As large as it is, it gets crowded and there might be a wait.  Here&#39;s why.

The food is deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious.  The menu is covered in wonderful descriptions of tasty sounding food.  Not only does it read as delicious, it is delicious.  We had the beef brisket that was soooooooooooooo tender, no knife required.  We also got an order of ribs  &#34;to go&#34;  and when I got them home I removed the meat from the bones before putting them in the refrigerator.  The meat literally fell off the bones, just the way I like them.   Our sides were also very tasty:  creamy cole slaw, baked beans, and perfectly done French fires.  There were 5 soups to pick from and they bring the cutest shaped rolls, hot, to start.  I see many visits in our future.

So, why only 4 stars?  They only offer spicy, mild, and North Carolina BBQ sauces.  Only 2 of those choices are available on the table AND the mild had a very vinegary taste to it.    BYO sauce for a perfect experience, unless you happen to like vinegar.

I will probably try the Burbank locations before I try this one again, BBQ, &amp; Creole are what I noticed on the Main Menu. mixed in whatever daily/monthly special they have going on. I personal liked the Creole side of their menu. If you are a beer lover you&#39;ll love this place I think close to 100 beers and a lot of drafts. It&#39;s in your best interest to check the daily/monthly food special before you go. Chuck&#39;s daily/monthly special is only on the menu for certain days. An example: Thursday is Cajun Meatloaf (although you might be thinking $2 off Thursday night for meatloaf... what it really means is Thursday is the ONLY day you&#39;re probably going to get that item.

LONG Overall review
I feel cheated. The photos you see in the yelp review are amazing. So much so that I didn&#39;t even read any of the reviews (which might have gave me a better impression of what I should expect) I decided to take my mother out as she&#39;s been on a diet and was looking for a &#34;off&#34; night. 

Service:
My waiter pulled a Jekyll and Hyde on me. Let me tell you about Jekyll. In the beginning she was slow and rude. (it was a Thursday around 6pm but was slightly busy possible because it was the day before Good Friday/Easter. With that being said, original set down it was only three other groups in her section. but all of them already had food.) After about 10 min of waiting we order an appetizer but forgot where things were on the menu so Jekyll informs us she would put the order in and be right back. Our waiter didn&#39;t come back to AFTER the appetizer was brought out by someone else. (I&#39;m guessing 15+min) So while eating our appetizer she finally walks up to our table and ask have we decided what we wanted. My mother says &#34;The duck gumbo&#34; (plate)is what she wants for her main dish. We are informed that&#39;s not one of the dishes today but she could order the duck soup, What blows are mind is once the waiter pointed out the soup on the menu. My mother tries to take her reading glasses back out her purse to see what she&#39;s referring/pointing to, but I guess this was five sec to long for the waiter because she say&#39;s &#34;I&#39;ll give you some more time to order and flat out walks away....We tried calling her back (cause hell, we&#39;ve read the menu 60x with all that waiting and knew our 2nd, 3rd and 4th options we were going to pick,) but we felt like she purposely ignored us and kept walking away. 5 min later she comes back and we order.

A 2nd &#34;someone else&#34; brings out the main dish.  Jekyll disappear and Hyde shows up  &#34;Oh how is your dish&#34; &#34;That&#39;s my favorite&#34; &#34;Want anything to drink?&#34; Good choice&#34; She even started talking about the dessert and making  comments about leaving room for dessert as they are really famous for certain dessert dishes. 

Food:
I order the Chuck&#39;s Cajun Cakes (5/5) and the Shrimp &amp; Crab Au Gratin (4/5) as appetizers. Those two things were amazing. These two things have saved this review from being a 1 star.

My main dish the Cajun Blackened Filet Mignon Tail. It was disappointing for two reasons. 1 I wasn&#39;t impressed with the taste of this  2. It wasn&#39;t even what I wanted..... I thought this was the same plate from a photo on yelp but it turns out that particular filet mignon photo was only on TappaTuesday (only on the 3rd Tuesday of the month). Basically I did the same thing my mother did earlier. I picked a dish that was from a photo but because the description in the photo said filet mignon. I made the mistake of assuming it was the same thing that was on their main menu. So although I&#39;ll admit this was more of my fault because the yelp photo does show #tappatuesday at the end of the description and it was something that I should have thought about when it happened to my mother. Jekyll wasn&#39;t really all that friendly to start with. Otherwise I probably would have pointed directly to the photo which I had questions about and asked her had she tried the dish. This is what I normally do when It come to food photos, but didn&#39;t want to be bothered cause Jekyll gave me the impression we was wasting her time and should get out and stop breathing.  (not sure which order she wanted us to do)

My mother choose to get the BBQ Combo (half slab baby back ribs and Beef Brisket)  as her main dish. She was happy with it and I&#39;m a big guy and must say it was a LARGE portion of food. Although she was happy with it. both the ribs and brisket I sampled were extremely fatty. However I thought he BBQ sauce was good and can see why they are popular.

Enjoyed the  two drinks (Grape Mojo (3/5) and the Hoodoo ElixirI (4/5) Both were well mixed and tasted great.)

It is in somewhat of an awkward building which is half restaurant half banquet hall. The restaurant part is very large with a pretty big bar. They also have outdoor seating.

For drinks I had a blue moon mixed with ginger beer which was one of their drink specials...it was ok but a bit watered down with way too much ice. My husband ordered a beer from their very large beer list.

Let me say the BBQ nachos were sooo good! Lots of delicious bbq pulled pork with shredded cheese and delicious guacamole. My husband and I could have probably eaten just this and been full but of course we ordered pulled pork sandwiches too!  The pulled pork was tender and had a perfect amount of bbq sauce (which you can order mild or spicy). For sides I had coleslaw and Mac and cheese. The coleslaw was great! It had the perfect balance between veggies and dressing. The Mac and cheese was pretty good but I am picky when it comes to the perfect Mac and cheese and this one was slightly too creamy. My husband had coleslaw and fries. The fries were nicely seasoned but could have been warmer.

chucks-southern-comforts-cafe-darien-2,Tad D.,mmnneqm5rY6MNwF--uScYw,QdhqtYuTvMUm90PcT1hPPg,"This place blows. First, it has both a conceptual and physical identity crisis. Is it a  southern restaurant, a BBQ joint, or a Mexican place? Turns out none, the food is crummy. Is it a sportsbar, a family restaurant,  or a banquet hall? 

You can see where I&#39;m going with this. Long story short, I paid $55 for a meal they wouldn&#39;t serve you at TGI Fridays.

It began with being given no less than four different menus, and the waitress giving a five minute explanation of all the specials, sides, beers and platters. we felt like we needed to be taking notes.

Next, the BBQ. It was smoked to oblivion. Honestly I think the ribs were rubber bands from Staples and the brisket was cardboard from a Papa John&#39;s box. The hot link was ok. 

Hello??? I lived in Kansas for three years, enjoying true smoked meats and real sauce. This is an embarrassment to the BBQ world.

The sides were store bought crap. Thanks for trying to trick me. I&#39;d rather have Kraft macaroni. A real southern or BBQ joint takes serious pride in their sides. Chuck&#39;s takes their minivan to Sam&#39;s club to purchase their sides.

Finally, the marketing bullcrap was so thick it was disgusting. &#34;Have dinner with Chuck!!!&#34;. Why? So he can tell me how to buy stuff from Schwann&#39;s and overcook it? And what&#39;s all this about Chuck working for Rick Bayless? Granted Bayless is a dbag, but Chuck must&#39;ve bussed tables for Ricky Rocket.

This location has a fairly large parking lot and additional parking next door if the bank is closed.  It looks like it was once a banquet hall.  And, I believe, they still have 1 or 2 large banquet type rooms.
Their bar is within the restaurant (unlike the Burbank location).  They have a really good beer list and seem to use the correct glassware too. They are pretty efficient because this is a busy, albeit large, restaurant.  We&#39;ve ordered lots of items from their menu but my favorites are probably the jambalaya, Korean wings, gumbo and their enchiladas with mole sauce.

Over the course of the last 15 years, I&#39;ve seen restaurant-bars come and go from this location (most recently Cornerstone), but it looks as though Chuck&#39;s is here to stay for good, and I for one am very glad.  They have an amazing menu that gets populated with new items seasonally and I&#39;ve only experienced a few blemishes across half a dozen visits.

Their food style is distinctly &#39;southern&#39;, with plenty of delicious side dishes to go with the barbeque items, as well as a handful of &#39;Nawlins-inspired items.  You can&#39;t go wrong with any of their BBQ, but the pulled pork and smoked brisket are standouts.  Make sure you upgrade to the &#34;deluxe&#34; (comes with 2 sides), and get the mac&#39;n&#39;cheese + baked beans.  The jalapeno cornbread sounds better than it actually is (brought out to us at room-temp).

I&#39;m not sold on their Cajun.  I&#39;ve had the jambalaya (surprisingly weak), catfish po-boy (meh), and gumbo (decent, but once found a sliver of bone / hard plastic in the bottom of the bowl.  not cool guys.)  Some may find the cajun to be good, but frankly speaking, I would get it elsewhere--Pappadeux&#39;s and Heaven on Seven come to mind.

If Chuck&#39;s falters with their Cajun, they atone for it with beer.  A LOT of it.  Tons of uncommon brews on tap and an extensive beer list that would rival most other places&#39; wine lists.  The beer flight is the way to go - sample several and find your new favorite!  I sure did - Allagash White, thankyouverymuch.

Breakfast is a whole &#39;nother story.  EXCELLENT choices, but a standout is the bananas foster french toast that&#39;s topped with freshly-sliced bananas, slathered in caramel and topped with pecans.  It&#39;s so good it&#39;s sinful, it&#39;s so sinful you&#39;ll need to head to Confession afterwards.  Once a month on a Sunday, Chuck&#39;s features beignets and cafe-au-lait for a nice change of pace.

The interior is clean, always festively-themed, and generally well-staffed.  Service has been consistently good, save for one time I ate here at an off-hour (like 2pm) and was forgotten about amidst the server shift change.  They&#39;ve got slots and video poker, too, for those of a gambling persuasion.  Good location on Cass Avenue, nice and close to my childhood home in Darien :)

So, long story short (too late), I&#39;m right on the fence with Chuck&#39;s....good enough to be deserving of 5*, but a couple missteps with food bring it back to a 4*.  In all honesty, I&#39;d give them 4.5 / 5.

Not only did my family have a wonderful experience at both locations, but the catering has also been unbelievable when we used it for family parties.
I have also used Chuck&#39;s for our employee appreciation BBQ about a year ago and Chuck himself ran the entire event voluntarily. He truly cares about the experience he provides and even went out of his way to accommodate our vegetarian employees. This was paramount because I didn&#39;t want anyone to feel left out. Chuck flawlessly set up our menu and arrived promptly to prepare everything before the event. He did an awesome job serving 70+ people and absolutely nothing ran low. Some people were confused because their chicken was pink inside and they thought it was undercooked. Chuck promptly informed them that this pink coloration is normal when chicken is smoked and assured that it was fully cooked. This helped some people who were skeptic or unfamiliar with smoked meats. Chuck has delivered a great experience on many levels and I always feel comfortable dining there.
My recommendation would be to try the mac &amp; cheese, pulled pork, and corn bread.",22/10/15,120,5,1,4,-13,3.5243,1.63,0.389,9.981,No,1188

chucks-southern-comforts-cafe-darien-2,K C.,mC-gDvf2hcFTMNMLPtIcHw,r-x1wUYyIGrKZWmgL3MuWQ,"I recently went to Chuck&#39;s for restaurant week.  

At times in the past I&#39;ve noticed that some restaurants aren&#39;t always on their &#34;A&#34; game for restaurant week. So it&#39;s hard to tell if my experience was the norm or because of Restaurant week. 

Overall my experience was average at best at Chuck&#39;s 

I give one star for service... the restaurant was clean, and nice, had a nice open feeling to it. Our servers were also great, very friendly and funny and attentive 
And I&#39;ll give one star for their Lobster Bisque. It was great. For their Bread pudding. It was delicious and came in huge servings. And for their wide selection of craft beer. 

My main problem is with my main dish... I ordered the &#34;Pasta Magnifique&#34;  It&#39;s not on their regular menu and was one of their monthly specials... which could be another reason for the quality and my issues with it.  Simply put... the  dish was horrible.  I am not a picky eater at all, but the dish was just overcooked and unappetizing.  To start, it was probably the worst pasta I&#39;ve had in a restaurant in as long as I can remember.  The pasta was so overcooked that the fettuccine tasted like mush and had no texture.  On top of that it was served with the largest head of broccoli I&#39;ve been given in a restaurant...  I wish I had taken a picture of it, because the size of it was comical. The head of broccoli was easy the size of a softball, and when the plate was put down me and my girlfriend couldn&#39;t help but laugh about it.  The broccoli was supposed to be steamed... it wasn&#39;t, or at most was only lightly steamed.  It tasted almost completely raw. I suspect that because of the size it wasn&#39;t properly steamed long enough..... I like raw broccoli, but raw broccoli doesn&#39;t go with an Alfredo dish and I ended up just having a softball size garnish on my plate.  When bringing home my leftovers I actually had to re-steam the broccoli myself.  The fact that Chuck&#39;s doesn&#39;t have any other real pasta dishes, and that they spelled &#34;fettuccine&#34; wrong on their website should have been a red flag for me.

Even with the problems with my main dish I didn&#39;t dislike Chuck&#39;s.... I just didn&#39;t have a good first experience and  don&#39;t see myself going back any time soon.",08/02/16,227,2,1,1,-1,0.5997999999999993,2.417,1.394,18.188000000000002,No,2317

Hadn&#39;t been to a Chuck&#39;s before and was skeptical having been to the previous two failed bar/restaurants at this location. There was a line to request a table which surprised me: &#34;For this place?&#34; I thought. Chuck&#39;s made some mostly superficial improvements using the existing spaces pretty much as they were previously which made me more skeptical. You still have to walk through the somewhat same divey bar area, but now with more tables where you can order, on your way back to the main dining area consisting of ample booths and large-party tables. The place was way busier than I remembered it on previous visits. The new outdoor seating is a very nice addition and was very busy. Any fears related to the previous places ended here.

Our waitress was prompt and friendly.  The beer menu is awesome with a fantastic selection of quality craft beers and ciders. I had the smoked half chicken which was luscious and made even better with the vinegar-based North Carolina style BBQ sauce I had on the side. Fries were done perfectly and ample. Coleslaw was fresh and a perfect complement. The only better complement was the Xingu Brazilian schwarzbier. Wide selection of apps, entrees, sides, and deserts. Five of us got out for $75 including drinks and tip which was a very solid deal.

The soup. Chuck offers like 6-8 soups a day. If it has the word chowder- it&#39;s not a chowder- it&#39;s like a bisque that the angels kissed. I have tried several corn, crab, jalapeno, poblano, scallop, some variation of this chowder and again- so magical I would come just for soup. 2. Extensive beer menu and fun bar specials- come during a bears game- you will not be disappointed. 3. The food is pretty darn good- I love the Mexican pot roast, his chilaquiles, banana fosters French toast, and the pulled pork is phenomenal. The menu is extensive and has comfort/ southern/ BBQ/ Hispanic/ creole items. He has so many specials daily and some day I&#39;m going to have off on tapas night.... I hope.

My Breakfast Review: 
The seating is not tight which makes it very family friendly. Breakfast stops at 11ish....so get there early! Each guest I go with loves their breakfast. French Toast is a good choice and any of their skillets. I always order Huevos Rancheros or Huevos Montulenos (scrambled). Both plates are 5 stars!

My Lunch Review: 
I wanted to show off this place to my friend but I realized that breakfast ends early! We ordered Cornbread which is a great way to start lunch! It was just perfect! There was also an extensive beer/drink list for lunch and dinner. I don&#39;t like cajun food so I ordered the Chicken Wing Dinner and I really liked my potato salad.

bien-trucha-geneva-2,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,Zm8Gz6TzswM5HMjU2rcLDw,"Phenomenal tacos and sides. Easily the best I have had in the Chicago area. 

Our power was out, so we decided to make the most of it and go get dinner somewhere far away. Bien Trucha it was!

With the menu running relatively cheap, and becaude these were only a dollar more than soda, my wife got a limonada and I got a mangoneada. Both were bright and fresh, and the mangoneada in particular was quite thick, like a smoothie (mango water is not a good description for this menu item). The rim of chili-based seasoning provided a familiar heat with the drink as well. 

I also ordered esquites, which was grilled corn with lime and cotija. I&#39;d definitely get this again, and it went well with my Atun tacos, or tacos with breaded tuna cubes.

It&#39;s pretty easy to describe the ingredients, but the thing that stands out is the balance of the ingredients. It would be so easy for any of the ingredients on the tacos to overwhelm, and you won&#39;t see me argue against having a fistful of fish on my plate. But no; each bite has the creaminess of the avocado, a little bit of fish, a bit of pickled onion. This is taco perfection.

I&#39;m pleased to say my wife&#39;s Bien Trucha was treated with the same care, only including skirt steak.

I&#39;m hoping to get a trip back here before winter sets in, because the things they&#39;re pulling off deserve the attention they get.",03/09/16,154,5,1,5,-4,4.6908,2.419,0.269,12.313,No,1385

The food itself was superb, priced reasonably for what you received, and the service was excellent. I had the signature tacos, and they might have been the best tacos that I&#39;ve ever had.

My friend and ordered the steak &amp; chorizo tacos, the chicken tacos, and the grilled corn. 

The star was definitely the corn. Both taco types lacked flavor and did not taste as authentic as my cheap local taco joint. The menu felt disjointed with very limited options if you didn&#39;t want tacos or tortas. 

Ok so the service was attentive, but food was lacking any real flavor. I guess it&#39;s catering to the Americanized Mexican pallette... But this non-amateur eater left greatly disappointed.

It had just rained outside by the time we got to dinner, so the patio was all closed up. However, as our dinner went on, they slowly opened it back up and had a great waiting spot for people outside. It was probably my favorite thing about the unique set up of the whole restaurant! Tables are a bit crowded together and voices carry/echo throughout, so don&#39;t plan to come here for a quiet dinner.

We started off ordering drinks at the bar, as we had to wait for our (previously reserved) table. House margarita, watermelon marg, and I had the strawberry marg. Our bartender did not skimp on the tequila! They were fresh and very tasty drinks. 

We then got to our table and promptly ordered the guac of the day which had mangoes in it. Real tasty, but I cringed knowing that we paid $9 for the lump of it that we got. We also ordered the Bien Trucha and Pollo tacos, both of which were good. The Pollo comes in a fried tortilla, which I was not expecting. The BT tacos were pretty standard steak tacos with cheese and some sauce drizzled over it.

I came with my parents on a relatively quiet Tuesday and asked for a table for 3, and they had us squeeze in at a table for 2. This meant my parents were mashed together on the booth half of a small table and their elbows were basically on the neighboring tables. I know it&#39;s a small place but c&#39;mon, it was not that busy. 

Instead of chips and salsa, they drop off chips and beans at the table.....I&#39;m not sure I have ever heard of this before, but it was not very good. So I asked for salsa to go with the chips (standard and complimentary at 99.9% of places) and the waitress told me she could not just bring salsa, but I would have to order the salsa platter for extra $.

Once my friend arrived, we were seated at one of the 10 tables there. No joke, not a huge place. They have a sister restaurant attached, which is only open for lunch. They may seat folks there once they are full, as it&#39;s the same ownership.

We had the tacos, and tortas. We also had some corn appetizer, which was phenomenal. Can&#39;t remember what it was called (Lo Siento, mi espanol es no bueno) but it was a must have. The tacos were great, tortas were nothing special. The meat on the skewer was tough. 

A bill for the two of us was $50, plus tip. While the food was great, it wasn&#39;t worth that much. If they brought their prices down by 20% or so, or increased portion size, it&#39;d be a great spot.

The only thing I don&#39;t like is that it is served tapas style. So you cannot go with a group of people and just get your own thing.

(If you know of others, I always looking for reminders of home do msg me w/ locations, please). I make them at home but nothing compares to well made ones + the delicious (slightly spicy) sauce + cheese they pour on them, YUM! 

The potatoes bravas are delicious as are the beans. You could easily share a guacamole app + each a taco entree. Tacos will more than fill you up since they come four to a serving. I usually end up taking one home. 

The patio in spring/summer is awesome, reminds me of a Miami lounge vibe when they&#39;ve got the DJ going and strawberry margaritas are being sipped. Certainly don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m in Illinois!

At about 4:20, I sidled up to the end the line outside of two rather unobtrusive buildings that one would otherwise mistake for a home on a main street. As it turns out, they are both part of the unique location that entail a primary dining room, a beautiful outdoor bar and dining space, and a separate bar with kitchen service.

Friendly well trained staff greeted us in line with an ipad to arrange our reserved seating, and informed us of our seating options, whereupon sitting outside was deemed the best available. I do appreciate the well organized line management, as it saved us from several would-be line cutters!

After what turned out to be a very short wait after opening, I was greeted with a flurry of professional service by a team of knowledgeable servers, led by both our server and a contentious manager.

Two excellent margaritas later; the guacamole, salsa flight, swordfish tacos with fried taco shells that were so yummy the table next to us tried to steal them, and tilapia fish tacos with home made chips had me longing for a beach in Baja at sunset; and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.

We ordered the limeade and hibiscus iced tea to start and both were refreshing and delicious. We were also given complimentary chips and a bean dip -- both very tasty. Our waiter mentioned the special guacamole that day had pears in it -- we were intrigued and had to order it. Yum! We also ordered the cazuelitas de camarones and bien trucha tacos, which are supposedly the best items on the menu. For our sides, we decided on the esquites (corn) and arroz poblano (rice).

The plates are meant to share.  The tacos are 4 per plate so, if you come with 4 people, that&#39;s ideal (you don&#39;t want more because the place is small).  We sampled the lunch menu and had the following tacos... A La Diabla (spicy shrimp); Pescado (beer battered tilapia); Pastor (marinated pork); Pollo (crispy chicken - more like flautas than tacos)  And I love that i could sample one of each!  I would rank them, but I can&#39;t .. all a tie for first.

Service also was among the best I ever experienced.  The waters were constantly filled and the chips were constantly refilled.  As I am not often in Geneva, I hear there is a sister place with the same menu in Glen Ellyn which is a bit more drivable for me called Toda Madre...

I went here for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I was surprised the restaurant was still pretty busy. There was about a ten minute wait but we decided to eat at the &#34;chef&#39;s table&#34; and we were seated right away. 

Our server (Lucy) described the handmade margaritas and I decided on the De Lujo margarita. The drink was not too sweet. $12 seems a little high for the size of this margarita but it had a great taste. 

I was very satisfied with the food! We started with the Bien Trucha tacos. The steak had a unique flavor and the roasted tomatillo salsa was perfect on top. 

The server suggested an order of Esquites (grilled corn, epazote butter, lemon aioli, queso cotinga, chile piquin). This is a great choice and will go with any menu item. We also ordered a Capitalina Torta. This is a sandwich with pork, cheese, pineapple, avocado, beans and aioli. 

Overall- They offer tasty food and I would love to go back if I&#39;m in Geneva. Heads up- they close at 3:00 and then reopen for dinner at 5:00. I would recommend getting there early if you&#39;re going for lunch.",12/07/15,147,4,2,5,30,5.1963,2.992,0.332,13.676,No,1215

Had the following

Ceviche of the day
It had lobster in it. Very good citrus flavor and the spice really sneaks up on you. Nice fresh starter

Guacamole traditional
Basic guacamole. It was fresh and the chips were nice and crispy

Bien Truca Taco
The steak was very tender and I loved the cheese in it. Full of flavor and definitely could have ordered some more of these

Pollo Taco
The tacos are fried into rolls and it reminded me of an eggroll with the crisp and texture. An unexpected dish. More like southwest eggrolls. Enjoyed this one as well

Barriga de Puerco
Pork belly with a lot of flavor. Solid taco. I would say I liked the above 2 better

The tacos here are very small about 2-3 bites and you are done. If you are going with a big group definitely recommend sharing if you like a variety of food. I do appreciate the creativity of this place with tacos and the food is full of brightness and flavor. Way better than some of the fancy mexican that I have had in the city

The only drawback was the crampness of the dining area and how the tables are so tiny. For a restaurant that focuses on small plate there needs to be table space to share that food.",25/09/16,133,4,3,5,61,7.795500000000001,4.417999999999999,0.0,11.581999999999999,No,1293

It totally lived up to every expectation I&#39;ve ever had. The first time I came here, I was starving and I ordered everything I can stuff in my pie hole. Everything was great and super tasty. So I went back the second time just in case I was just hungry the first time, I surely didn&#39;t want to give a place 5 stars for a possibly skewed review because I was starving. Oh man, the second time around was even better! 
Let&#39;s talk taco: bien Trucha, arrachera, and pescado tacos were very good. Bien Trucha and arrachera were made with the most tender and well marinated skirt steak. Pescado is made with breaded tilapia with red cabbage topping. All 3 were soooooo good! You&#39;ll get Turnt Up For Taco guaranteed! #TUFT
PiÌ¬ce de rÌ¬sistance: shrimp cazuelitas. Oh. My. Gawd. To die for. MUST HAVE for sure. The explosion of flavor in this dish is to die for . Totally worth the drive wherever you&#39;re coming from. Best dish I&#39;ve ever had in my life!!! 
Sides: the rice and corn sides were amaze balls 
Drinks: too sweet for my taste. I recommend their sipping tequilas vs their sangria and margarita.

bien-trucha-geneva-2,Jacqueline B.,zKY6NM9CxxWxcY5JJXUB7g,eV7iaxvkw7RDVfU2uxDvaQ,"I was so excited to write this review, but I&#39;ve restrained myself until now just so Bien Trucha could be my 200th review! :)

The hype is real folks. The hype. Is. Real.

My husband and I came here for Cinco de Mayo this year. I of course have read amazing reviews on Yelp, so I decided what better time to check it out. I know Bien Trucha gets hella busy, so I made sure to make a reservation online. It was the morning of cinco de mayo when I checked their availability and luckily we were able to snag their last rezzy! I guess it was meant to be.

Although we arrived right on time (6:45 p.m.), I don&#39;t think we were actually seated until about 7. I kind of was prepared for this though, being the holiday and all. What I wasn&#39;t prepared for was the shuffle between two separate buildings. Thanks to Angela P.&#39;s review, I knew A Toda Madre was connected to BT and is basically the same thing so I wasn&#39;t too concerned. It was rather annoying though how the hostess at BT told us we&#39;d be seated faster next door, and then that host sent us back to where we originally were.

When this shuffle calmed down we still ended up sitting at the bar and ordering a drink until our table was ready. They had a $5 classic margarita special, so that kept me calm, cool, and collected while we waited. About 15 minutes later we were sat at a quaint 2 person table in the side room. Our waitress greeted us right away and was super helpful.

I love the ambiance of the restaurant (although pretty small). A wine bottle-esque pitcher of water was on the table, along with a candle, stylish plates and a simple menu. The scene is perfect for a date night or a girls night out.

We started with their classic guacamole and were also given complimentary pinto bean dip. Both were delicious and addicting. Their homemade tortilla chips stood out to me. I&#39;m not sure what it was, but they had the perfect crunch and were not over-salted. It&#39;s safe to say we accidentally filled up pretty well on these pre dinner snacks.

Their food is served basically tapas style, so we were instructed to order a few different things to share and they would come out one after another. I really like this concept, however when all was said and done the hubbie and I agreed that we ate too fast in anticipation of the next delicious item coming out!

We ordered as follows:

Cazuelitas de camarones -- sautÌ©ed shrimp, red onion, garlic, cilantro-chimichurri, and chihuahua cheese served with tortillas (this was basically a make-your-own quesadilla and it was amazing!)

Bien Trucha tacos (4) -- grilled skirt steak, chorizo, chihuahua, roasted tomatillo salso

Pescadillas tacos (4) -- shredded swordfish, epazote, crispy tortilla, avocado-habanero pico 

Everything was absolutely amazing. I&#39;m talkin every time either of us took a bite we did that like full mouth &#34;mm hhmm, that&#39;s really good&#34; nod to each other. I literally can&#39;t wait to come back. These are fresh and unique Mexican flavors I&#39;ve never had before. It&#39;s a modern Mexican menu so sure, I&#39;ve had more &#34;authentic feeling&#34; entrees, but Bien Trucha is something special.

Definitely go check &#39;em out. Like, NOW!",08/05/15,384,5,3,5,57,13.177599999999998,6.9110000000000005,0.411,28.677999999999997,No,3222

Great outdoor seating although we sat inside to get a break with the air conditioning since we were out in the afternoon enjoying Swedish Days. The tacos came in miniature across a wood plank and my wife and I shared the tuna and swordfish tacos. The swordfish were spicy in a crunchy shell where the tuna was wonderful in soft shell with salad garnish. It was very busy but wait staff very friendly and attentive.

bien-trucha-geneva-2,Rose D.,FqHNMGc_-BgX4svll0SwLg,TClSD0RRhr-3UrK9Yl-E_Q,"I was hesitant to try Bien Trucha. Since whenever we happen to be in their area it&#39;s lunch time but they don&#39;t take reservations for lunch and the line is usually down the block...and places with a lot of &#34;OMG you MUST go there!&#34; hype tend to disappoint me.  A few years later the planets aligned to a rainy Saturday where we would be in Saint Charles.  I hoped the rain would work in our favor keeping the throngs at bay for a bit so we could give them a try for lunch.  We arrived right before opening and we were rewarded with immediate seating.  The place filled up within an hour of their opening, however - but there wasn&#39;t a line to get in so a crummy weather day is a good time to give them a try if you can&#39;t make it for a dinner rez time slot. 

I&#39;d say the food was 4 - 5 stars and the service was 1 - 3 stars so I&#39;m going to settle on 3 stars.  It&#39;s tapas style but they have teeny tables so plan on just ordering 1 - 2 things at a time.  We tried the Esquites (roasted corn - amazing &amp; my dining companion who normally doesn&#39;t like corn gobbled it up!), the Bien Trucha tacos (skirt steak &amp; chorizo) &amp; the Atun tacos (tuna) - both tacos were delicious.  We also tried 2 of the margaritias (the melon, a special that day, &amp; the avocado) &amp; the sangria - all were tasty but they really don&#39;t give you much at all and they don&#39;t give you much &#34;kick&#34; if you know what I mean, either.  If I&#39;m paying $9 (sangria) - $11/12 (margaritas) each I would like it to be a least a bit stronger.

Our server was kind and explained the menu to us and she checked on us regularly.  We had 2 gripes with the service.  One was right after our margaritias arrived my dining companion picked it up  to move it to the side and make room for the food and the glass just slipped right out of his hand.  I&#39;m not sure if it was a bit of grease from the tortilla chips or what but he picked it up &amp; the glass immediately slipped out and spilled all over the table &amp; him.  Now this occurred when a bus boy was watching 2 feet away &amp; our server was at the next table taking their order.  Not a single person came over to help clean up the mess and we had to ask the bus boy to bring us new napkins &amp; plates.  That was a rather irritating start so I&#39;m glad the food was delicious to even out their star rating.  The second gripe was regarding the small basket of tortilla chips &amp; a bean dip they bring you when you sit down.  We finished our chips &amp; still had half the bean dip left.  The bus boy took away our empty basket for chips &amp; left the bean dip but never brought any more chips.  I did overhear another table asking for chips so perhaps you have to ask? Just not sure why they wouldn&#39;t ask us if we wanted more chips (most servers at other places ask), especially if they are going to leave the bean dip on the table. 

After all is said and done I probably wouldn&#39;t bother going back.  Good to give them a try, at least, though.",03/05/16,329,3,1,5,-24,5.1290000000000004,2.4060000000000006,1.2779999999999998,23.317,No,3044

So when I first crunched into a magnificently, impossibly fresh tuna taco adorned with baby arugula, celery aioli and avocado at Bien Trucha, an unassuming little joint on the edge of downtown Geneva, every expletive I knew shot through my head within a nanosecond. And the bill for guac, twelve tacos and four margaritas came to just about $80. (I wasn&#39;t dining alone, I swear!)

As I munched on house-made totopos and that exemplary guacamole, freshened with the tang of tomatillo, I thought, &#34;Could Rick Bayless somehow be behind this?&#34;

Nope. Turns out Mexico City-bred chef/owner Ricardo Garcia-Rubio, although a decades-long kitchen vet, had never garnered any kind of real attention or seen much success before opening Bien Trucha in 2007. Now, eight years later, after an expansion and much local and national acclaim, it seems Chef is right where he needs to be.

He&#39;s certainly farther away from Lakeview than I&#39;d like; I would eat at Bien almost every week if he were within a five-mile radius. I randomly crave those tuna tacos. Other times my mouth waters at the thought of crunchy tortillas stacked with juicy, epazote-scented swordfish and avocado-chile pico de gallo. Even the skirt steak tacos, slightly overshadowed by the oceanic treats, pop into mind. I even miss the simple but ridiculously addictive white rice, dotted with bits of roasted poblano and creamy-gooey with crema and Chihuahua cheese. 

My only complaint aside from distance is that the margaritas, while delicious (especially the cucumber &#34;Pepino&#34;), are rather small and low on booze. I may prefer my tequila drinks more bracing than most people, but these might not do the job for even the lightest-weight lightweight in your group. 

I suppose that means that, pocketbook permitting, you ought to have an extra cocktail. The experience is otherwise worth savoring.",08/11/15,254,4,1,2,-35,1.7527000000000001,1.1960000000000002,0.514,15.290000000000001,No,2018

After spending a relaxing Saturday afternoon in the area, we decided to venture over to Geneva and try our luck. Without reservations, we got in line around 4:30 for their 5 o&#39;clock dinner opening. Great timing as we were the third group in line. The weather was perfect to sit outside in their outdoor dining area under the canopy. Once 5:00 pm came, the line was to the end of the block. I was just hoping that the tacos lived up to the hype!
Once we were seated, our server got right to work, greeting us and offering information about their specials. I ordered a watermelon margarita for myself and the traditional guacamole for the table. We ordered tacos to share and decided on shrimp, tuna and chicken. The tacos came in orders of 4. 
At first, our food came almost immediately, and I had the feeling that because this restaurant is so busy, we would be rushed out in order to turn over the table for the next guests. That could have been the case but our order of chicken tacos took an extremely long time. That was fine by us as we were there to enjoy the atmosphere and the beautiful weather.

This place is very small so if you aren&#39;t a fan of siting close together for dinner, I suggest visiting during patio season, there&#39;s a little more room out there. They start off your dining experience by bring a bean dip with chips. The bean dip seems to have a hint of chipotle and is tasty. The pepino margarita they have is too good. It is pricey, but it&#39;s one of those things that you don&#39;t feel guilty splurging on because it&#39;s delicious. The guacamole is a must. They do have a special guacamole (Guacamole del Dia) where fresh fruit is added, by chef&#39;s choice and we always try it and have never been disappointed. The tacos are flavorful and have unique combinations on them.( I would not describe them as authentic mexican tacos at all, but more of a taco with a modern twist) The Arrachera tacos are one of my favorites. It&#39;s steak with onions, avocado and salsa. If you don&#39;t mind paying a little more for a upscale feel, then this is the place for you.

I was treating my daughters to a &#34;girls day out&#34; and the wait time was 15 minutes for a table so we decided to sit at the bar.  We were the only three at the bar the whole time.  The bartender/server placed three menus in front of us and we chose our meals.  He ignored us for the most part and when we asked him for an explanation of some of the menu headings in spanish, he would mumble an answer that none of us could make out.  Two of our dishes came out at the same time and when the third came out about 5-6 minutes later, my daughter said, &#34;oh, I didn&#39;t know it&#39;s fried&#34; and the bartender responded with &#34;did you read the menu?&#34;  Now looking at the meals description of &#34;pollo&#34; under Tacos it says &#34;crispy rolled&#34; which still doesn&#39;t explain the &#34;deep fried&#34; meal that was given to her.  She explained that she is pregnant and has indigestion issues and he walked away.  So, the food was good and the service was ridiculously near non-existent and in your face rude...which is ironic since he wasn&#39;t busy mixing drinks, helping other diners, etc.  He would tell our order to one of the other servers and then they would hand the dishes to him and he would place them in front of us.

I went back last night with some friends and I was beyond excited. However, I have learned high expectations can lead to disappointing results. 

We went in, grabbed four drinks (at 50 dollars total... Am I back in bora bora?) and went outside to sit and wait for our table. I really liked having this option as I a quite am a people watcher.  Our table was called on time and we were brought to the building I ate at the first time. 

On to the order! 
They were out of cerviche, which was disappointing but it was also 830, so my bad.  We ordered pork belly, fish, steak, and pork tacos along with the corn and salsa. 

Everything was mediocre and the flavors were not what I remembered. I think what drove me the most crazy was that everything came out at the same time.  Even our chips and salsa. The tables are tiny there and there was no room for anything.  They had us take the tacos off the platters so they could take the platters away right then and there.  Thanks for the rush...   Maybe invest in a larger table?

This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants ever and it is definitely worth the wait. Bien Trucha owns two buildings that are separated by their outdoor patio. One restaurant is for reservations and the other is seated on a first come first serve basis. I would strongly suggest that you make reservations as soon as possible as they get booked fast and sometimes it can take a month to reserve a prime time on a Friday or Saturday. 
We always have a large group and so we usually order pretty much everything on the menu. The drinks are phenomenal! My favorite of them all is the Ahuacatl. They give you complimentary homemade chips and bean dip and a must order is the salsa trio and the traditional guacamole. Another must order are the side dishes of rice and corn and the pescado tacos. I make it my mission to try fish tacos across the country and these are my favorite by far.

They need to change that so i can try different things. Then they need to make more unique tacos still the same ones.

Free appetizer:  its frizoles and chips the chips are fresh not greasy seasoned well the beans are really good i just eat all the cheeze in it then i stop not to get too fool

Ceviche del mes: i ordered this twice both completely different the first time it was really unique sometjing i never had before this time it was more traditional but still amazing its gormea so it has high quality ingredients in it then i love the salad in the bottom its not diluted  with water like alot of mexican restaurants must order!

Cazulita de camarones: this is the best dish here its so good the shrimp are cooked perfectly the sauce is really rich but a lil sour the perfect balance. The cheese underneath is to die for its so good its like a mexican fondue i wish they put more shrimp in it though u have to order this

Barriga de puerco: this was really good the sauce was really good to but i like my pork belly fried and its not fried 

Pescado taco: this was the best taco i have ever eaten its perfectly fried really crispy not greasy perfectly cooked not overcooked or dried seasoned really well the coleslaw is so fricken good adds so much richness to make it so decadent.

Atun taco: its really crispy but not greasy seasoned really nicely the sauce was really good i wish there was more surprised there was alot of tuna fish the salad on top was really good just wish that there was coleslaw instead  really good though 

Soup: crema de chile poblano: omg this was so fucking good i didnt expect anything of it i just ordered it cause it was cheap wow did this have so much flavor it was so rich one of the best soups i ever had it had a lil bit of smokey flavor not alot perfect for cold days comes with bread but i used the chips for crunch. Theres cheeze and potatoes at the bottom needs more though

Brocheta de carne: its a mexican shish kabob. It was cookd perfectly it was medium rare and the vetables werent overcooked wasnt to burned either the dipping cause was good could be better though it needed salt though the seasoning wasnt that good wouldnt order again

Enchiladas: umm this was my least favorite it was way to sweet was more like a dessert. And tasted like the can mole to be honest idk if they used it but tasted really similar to it. 

Mexican Corn appetizer: i love mexican corn but this wasnt really that good it needed sAlt jus had no wow factor i had better

Arrachera taco: this was my least favorite taco it was to plain i tasted almost everything off the menu and this had no wow factor the bien trucha is a way better steak taco i wouldnt order this again

Bien trucha taco: this was my favorite steak taco here its so good. The steak is cooked perfectly supper tender and flavorful. I love the cheese theres alot which is good. Then the salsa on top is so delicous not spicy just the right balance. Then theres chorizo on it which makes it even better not burned! Or really greasy.

Oysters: really fresh really delicious just i wish there was more condiments like horshradish theres just a black sauce and a red sauce needs a wow factor

Churros: this was my least favorite thing i ate here they were overfried and no sugar or cinnamon on any of them i had to ask for it.

Key lime pie: i hate key lime pie i dont really like things really sour but this was so fucking good it wasnt sour at all  the icecream was perfect not overturned not to sweet perfect texture. The crust at the bottom was supper crispy added alot of texture then theres  meringue that is blow torched so good not to sweet. Must order 

Corn cake: u have to order this one of the best desserts of my life u have to order this supper moist and flavorful the sauce is to die for theres tequila in it that really enhances the flavor of the cake its amaizing u have to get it",02/06/15,529,5,4,5,118,11.039299999999997,4.111000000000001,0.838,15.052000000000001,No,4685

I did mention this upon arrival and the answer I received was that they only have three phone lines so if all are in use they can&#39;t accommodate. We said ok we&#39;ll wait. I went to use the washroom and when I returned my husband was already seated. So about 5 minutes. Strange to say the least. They brought me to the table my husband and daughter were at.

We received a text just as we pulled up that our table was ready. They sat us at the Chef&#39;s table (bar). That was a nice experience as you can watch them cook and interact if you choose. Our waiter was friendly. The menu has great options. Mexican beer for $5 is nice. Glad they don&#39;t up charge the beer too much as an &#34;import&#34;. Margaritas starting at $9 and up to $12. Well, it&#39;s all fresh and mostly organic ingredients so I feel it&#39;s worth it. 

Chips and bean dip delivered complimentary. Very fresh. We ordered the guacamole as I tend to judge a place like this based solely on how fresh it is. NICELY done. We actually watched them prepare it. My wife ordered the special. Yellowfin snapper that was butterflied and grilled. Simply seasoned and perfect. Grilled lemon was a nice touch. Came with a red cabbage salad and tortillas. Delicious. 
I ordered the Pastor tacos. Very, very good.

Atmosphere. Deep house music over the PA system. Nice! Outdoor seating with couches while you wait to be seated.

Food. I was expecting a larger menu but it turns out all they do is gourmet tacos and a few sides along with the typical salsas. Everything we had tasted very good.

Service: It was good. Nice, friendly waiter.

What I didn&#39;t like:

It&#39;s a little pricey but hey, it&#39;s Geneva and we just got back from Vegas so we knew weren&#39;t gonna get taqueria or Taco Bell prices. I thought the size of the tacos was OK. They weren&#39;t big but they hit the spot. Ordered a habanero salsa and I got an ounce and a half for $5. Ouch. Was expecting more items on the menu such as entrees considering all the buzz this place has but now I know if and when I go back not to expect more than tacos.

I would go back if I felt like gourmet tacos and wanted to eat outside with a group. I wouldn&#39;t go if i wanted authentic Mexican food in the form of entrees.

Edit. When I got my receipt, the habanero salsa was $2. I must have remembered the price on the menu which was $5.",16/06/16,130,3,2,3,18,2.9207,3.5700000000000003,0.054,15.376,No,1103

Even with all the food options of Chicago, the modern house-turned-restaurant stole the show.

After being seated quickly my server suggested a few options and I settled on the Bien Trucha tacos (I figured it has to be good if they named the restaurant after it) and the Esquites, a mixture of roasted corn, epazote-butter, spices and lemon juice. It&#39;s hard to live up to the hype of the 29 Zagat score posted at the door and all the other reviews you have surely read below, but I&#39;m here to tell you it was far exceeded. The flavor was amazing. To the point I brought my wife back THE SAME DAY for dinner. Which you better be early to because by the time 5:00 PM rolls around there is a line of 30+ people. 

Regardless of what you choose to get, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get the Esquites. You can put it on any taco and its guaranteed to knock your socks off. Take a bite, BOOM, no socks.

I wasn&#39;t at all impressed overall. The hotdog was ok at best, but the only thing jumbo was the diameter. When I think of a jumbo dog, I think longer.

The staff is slow. The people that came in 5min after us were taken care of 1st.

There&#39;s a table near the bar that&#39;s been piled with dirty dishes from before I got there and sat the whole time.

I&#39;ve also had the Kung Po chicken/shrimp. These can be a little more hit and miss in regards to the spiciness of the dish. If you don&#39;t handle heat well, be clear when ordering that you want it on the milder side.

The dine-in experience can be lengthy especially on a Friday or Saturday night. It&#39;s a smaller place, and groups of 6+ are going to struggle to have comfortable seating. I would highly recommend them as a quick take-out option. Order ahead and give yourself about 25 minutes.

That&#39;s exactly how I felt after I read all of these glowing reviews on this place. Are you guys smoking crack? Abusing prescription meds? Snorting Drywall!?!! I stopped in for lunch with my boyfriend based on the good reviews. The inside is decorated nicely. I loved how they decorated the napkins in cool stand up triangles on the tables.
      I ordered a watermelon smoothie to start. I was so excited that Asian Harbor actually used REAL fruit, and not a smoothie mix. I started with a Japanese appetizer called Gyoza, which was a fried dumpling that resembled a pot sticker. My boyfriend ordered pot stickers, and we actually laughed about how they were similar. The pot stickers and Gyoza were very good so I just knew I would enjoy the rest. I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong!!
     Anyhow lets get down to business. I ordered a Japanese dish trying to be different, and I didn&#39;t care for it. The picture shows shrimp tempura on top of noodles.

manzos-burger-chicago-2,David N.,li5pwULg5kwUf7CjN7uvCA,ptlpAA1xLgKO3StUi6hOGg,"Stopped in recently for lunch, hoping to enjoy what I was led to believe would be a solid Southside burger. Unfortunately, our first visit netted average meat sandwiches and a dirty, unlocked uni-sex bathroom door leading to an eyeful of employee deuce-making (Ewww). Anyway, I checked out the Five Star Burger, while my wife tried her hand at the Bourbon Burger. Both seemed to have the makings of a good burger, but fell short in the flavor department. I almost question if the excess of ingredients on both sandwiches were in response to the flavorless meat product they called a burger. Certainly not fresh, almost completely dried out, and void of seasoning. If they called it a grilled onion, sautÌ©ed pineapple, and smoked bacon sandwich, I might have left with a smile. But they didn&#39;t, and I didn&#39;t. My wife&#39;s Bourbon Burger was a tad better as ingredients were above par, but again same meat patty was involved. We did grab an order of French fries, which were hand-cut and seasoned well; but ended up almost cold and were obviously waiting in the basket while the burgers thawed away. Bottom line... Five Star appears to be an average burger joint at best.  They do offer daily sandwich and side combos around $5, but probably won&#39;t be returning to check out the rest of the menu. 

And what&#39;s with the old-school Italian music in the background? So confused...",26/12/14,165,2,1,3,-25,2.2636000000000003,1.326,0.43699999999999994,12.238,No,1392

Wednesday is $1 tacos - so call ahead and bring CASH...NO debit/credit accepted.  They have ice cream and a large variety of Jarritos soda.  Dine in or carryout they provide home made hot/mild salsas and limes. The fresh tortillas whether it be corn or flour are moist.

I usually order 15-20 tacos for my family - they are packed 3 tacos per foil wrap and always include onion and cilantro.  We like the steak/potato with cheese, onion and cilantro - but everything I had here is good.

Rockdale is like a quiet movie set for something set in a deserted, wild west town.  Rockdale is just south of Joliet and might as well be a part of Joliet.  I discovered Rockdale when I had to pick up a package from the UPS facility.  Curiosity led me to searching for restaurants in Rockdale, and that&#39;s how I found El Comal.

As I already mentioned, they don&#39;t have horchata.  What the FF?  They do have a variety of Jarritos sodas though, so I got the pineapple.

My husband and I had lunch here on Memorial Day, I was surprised how busy this spot was on a Monday afternoon.  While we were eating, lots of people would come and go, and at one point, all of the tables were full.

The food is good.  I had 2 tacos: one steak, chicken, and pork.  All three were equally good, served on soft corn tortillas with the customary cilantro and onion.  Chips and salsa are complimentary, and there are 3 salsas to choose from.  We also ordered the guacamole, which was served in a styrofoam bowl.  The food is good, authentic, and great for a casual lunch or dinner.

Prices are great too, I think the tacos were only $1.25 each.  Cash only!

If you live in Plainfield, drive the few extra miles to El Comal, because I still stand by the fact that there is no truly good Mexican food in Plainfield, especially tacos.",30/05/15,161,4,2,5,34,4.2578000000000005,2.787,0.7749999999999999,15.437999999999999,No,1334

I didnt get the chirozo as recommended but instead pastor &#34; the marinated pork.&#34; Wife had the asada huaraches.( Steak). I went there to get carryout. Place was mobbed at 6pm on a Monday. I waited a bit. Disappointed no horchata. Carryout was fairly quick. Cashier was a very pleasant girl. Still amazed  at the huaraches which are homemade soft corn tortilla shells. Whats interesting is they are not your standard 6&#34; or 12&#34; but a size different. They are an odd size which makes you realize they&#39;re homemade.   
Food was great! They put onions &amp; limes
on the side. I like that cause you can put extra hot sauce on then cut it slightly w/ the lime. Not sure but feels authentic. 
I want to dine in next time. As previous reviewers stated, its cash only. They do have an ATM there in case you forget that. 
I did also have the quesadillas which were slightly above avg but nothing special. 
The prices are well below average which is nice if you have a group. Wasnt looking for margaritas and didnt see any. Small parking lot on side but plenty of street parking . I&#39;d give it a 4 1/2 of 5 stars. If they had horchata, margaritas, and a better reputation for other menu items it

El Comal is located in Rockdale, IL on a street that is famous for being in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most bars on one street (or something like that).  So the neighborhood is somewhat sketchy, but if you can past that it is definitely worth a stop. 

It was slammed at noon when we arrived, not an open table in the place.  Quite a mix of blue and white collar workers which tells me that this place is not a secret to those in the know in Joliet.  

I managed to read a few reviews while standing in line and kept seeing comments about the huaraches.  Now I&#39;ve eaten at a hundred different Mexican places and one thing that I thought was odd is that every place has pretty much the same selections on thier menu.    How the hell have I never heard of a huaraches????   

I ordered the Tripas Huaraches and a Mixed Huaraches (steak, pork and chorizo).  I give them both a solid A.   The best explanation I can give you is a really long soft taco that isn&#39;t rolled up and the taco shell is home made and unlike any taco I&#39;ve ever had.

Now, the salsa and the beans and rice leave a lot to be desired.  Had some of the sides been adequate I would have definitely given EL Comal a five star review!!

Carlos and his staff have truly created a masterpiece. It does not matter what you order because everything is Amazing!The quality of ingredients is second to none. What sets Tacos El Comal apart from the competition is their hueraches, which is hardly found in authentic Mexican cuisine. What makes the  huerache unique is that it is larger than a taco and has a sweet, corn/flour hybrid fluffy tortilla. furthermore, Tacos El Comal is one of a kind because of the salsa. The salsa has flavor that I have never tasted at any other authentic Mexican restaurant ever!!!  Particularly The red salsa has a smoky flavor great with steak.

Carlos, the owner Is a very friendly and is always working alongside his coworkers, and interacting with customers. Carlos takes pride in getting to know his customers and community. Do not be surprised if you are the only individual there that speaks english, which I think is a good thing because you know it&#39;s authentic. Another key feature is that it&#39;s super cheap. For 6 bucks a big guy like me can get full and still have quality. My wife and now live an hour away and still make trips to come here.

Tacos were above average. (especially when they&#39;re $1.00 each on Wednesdays) Its of the authentic kind and when they say if you want it with everything, they&#39;re referring to adding onions, cilantro on them. 

The huaraches was disappointing but was quite relieved that it was only a mere $3.25.  It was just a long tortilla with some diced steak on it.  However, I found a balled-up styrofoam in my bag containing long onion strips and a jalapeno, which I assume was for the huarache but didn&#39;t make it that much better.

My pork burrito was the real winner here.  If you like your burritos with lots of meat, beans, and cheese and with little lettuce and tomato, then you&#39;ve come to the right place.  I&#39;ve had burritos from numerous places and I rank the ones here right at top.

Turns out these &#34;big tacos&#34; are known as huaraches and are the specialty here:  homemade large tortillas stuffed with a choice of filling, cheese, cilantro and diced onion. Served on the side are grilled onions and lime. Yum! Boy had the steak and I had the daily special of chorizo and potato. We also shared the guacamole which was homemade and a big step above most Mexican fast food places. Total bill with two drinks was @$12.  We were going to carryout but decided to eat in. To our table we were brought tortilla chips with salsa verde, salsa roja and pickled jalapenos.

In all their dishes, not one flavor overpowers another, they just meld together and are bright enough to complement one another without stealing the show. Seriously impressed!

Located in a large strip mall in Winfield, IL it looks pretty simple on the outside. Once you get inside, however, it almost feels like you are at a restaurant near a tourist spot with soft music playing in the background.

We went on a Friday evening around 8:30pm, and the restaurant was on the empty side. We were seated promptly and given menus to look over.

I almost always order the Pad Kee Mao (spicy flat rice noodles) when I first visit a Thai spot. My husband ordered a curry dish (Coconut Yellow Curry?). My food overall was pretty decent. A little greasy for my taste, but definitely not overly oily to the point where I can&#39;t enjoy my food. The curry dish was delicious!

Thai Iceed Tea $3 - This was very good, not too sweet at all (in fact, I could go a tad sweeter).

Tom Kha Kai $5 - Thai coconut milk soup with your choice of chicken or vegetable cooked with lemongrass, bell pepper, mushroom and lime leave.  This was a tasty soup, but what threw me off were the pieces of green bell peppers.  I love veggies, but this is one of my least favorite vegetables.  I&#39;ve never had that in a Tom Kha before.

Lard Nar with Tofu $9 - Big flat rice noodle with Broccoli and Collard Greens in garlic gravy.  They made this with a very strange twist - the noodles were crispy and the sauce was watery.  Maybe this is the fusion part.  I was expecting the normal soft wide rice noodles with thick sauce and didn&#39;t particularly enjoy this variation.  Also, I didn&#39;t see any collard greens.

Spicy Catfish $14 - Deep fried crispy catfish with red curry paste in coconut milk, topped with a touch of crispy basil leave.  My favorite dish of the night and it was delicious.

Finally, great Thai close to home! I have been dying for some great Thai food ever since I ate at Banana Leaf in Dallas and remembered just how great Thai food could be. (amazingly the owner there looked Thai, but had a thick Cajun accent)

Seriously, we eat Thai food a couple of times a month and have been making do with food that is just OK and creeping up in price. Many of these Thai places don&#39;t even serve much seafood... What&#39;s up with that?

Montri Thai has a full menu with all the right stuff. We started with the Avocado rolls and Chicken Satay... followed by Pad See Ew with Beef, Tofu Thai Fried Rice, Thai Orange Chicken and Panang Curry.

Everything was delicious! The Panang Curry is a real treat and the Satay is the best that I&#39;ve had in a long time (looking forward to trying the pork satay) I can&#39;t wait to get back there to try the whole red snapper and some of the other seafood dishes.

Now there is more to eat in Warrenville than just Two Brothers.

Good prices, a nice room, decent wine list, friendly service and great food... an awesome formula for success. Now if only they could work on their Cajun accents",02/03/13,150,5,2,5,22,5.32,4.472,0.053,9.475,No,1188

I asked for &#34;spicy,&#34; and my dish absolutely was spicy without blowing my head off.  But don&#39;t eat those little red chilies in the dish, because those will make your mouth hurt.  I mistook them for a dried fruit, but I have no idea why I assumed something so ridiculous, so my mouth suffered a little.

The avocado rolls were interesting.  I liked the creaminess of the avocado and the crunchiness of the roll.  But it kind of tasted like guacamole which threw off the whole Thai thing.  Our friends ordered the Angel Wings appetizer, which looked like a giant stuffed chicken leg and deep fried.  I didn&#39;t get to try it, but it looked delicious.

There&#39;s a good variety of Thai dishes on the menu aside from the predictable Pad Thai including red, yellow, and green curries, and quite frankly a lot of other things I cannot recall much less pronounce (Pad See Ew, Kung...tingtangwallawallabingbang...)

Montri Thai is located in a strip mall, alongside a laundromat and thrift store, so I expected a more divey, casual joint.  While Montri Thai is casual, the interior of the restaurant felt intimate and classy with the dark wood tables, booths, and white tablecloths.  The restaurant can definitely accomodate groups, but it was so quiet in here (aside from the Christmas music) that I felt like I had to keep my voice down.

Hands down, this is it. Whether it&#39;s break ups, work stress, or something else, their cocktails are excellent (both in liquor content and price) and their Rama Chicken makes everything temporarily better.

Taste was pretty good. The duck was fried and some was hard to eat since the breading or whatnot was extremely tough.

montri-thai-warrenville,Anuj S.,chgTnp84tlV4UUJlfIVJzA,r3KJfbh0jhHZ0d_Jux_CuA,"I went to Montri with a large group recently and the overall reviews from everyone were mixed.  What I know is, whatever food I tried was good so I&#39;m going to give Montri the benefit of the doubt here.  Really the two major issues were that the service was really slow.  We waited a LONG time just to get our appetizers like avocado rolls and soup.  That was excessive, but again maybe the issue was the size of our group, 8 adults and 6 kids.  The other issue my friends complained about was the sweetness of the food.  Many entrees came out quite sweet, which wasn&#39;t ideal.

I tried a couple of things.  First off, the avocado rolls were great.  Almost like a Tex/Mex-Asian fusion thing going on.  Really nice.  On the other hand, the Tom Kha soup was... not what I expected.  Not that it was bad, but it just didn&#39;t taste like the Tom Kha soup I have almost everywhere else.  I&#39;m all for unique flavors, but this just seemed like a whole different kind of soup.  Really, the soup was my only complaint.  The red curry was great and the Pad Kee Mao was good.  I think we could and should have upped the spice levels on everything we ordered.  Adding in the hot sauce provided the heat we needed.

I would recommend Montri.  I would come back and give them another shot in terms of the service assuming part of the issues were just due to our group size.  We&#39;ll hope for a better experience next time.",27/05/13,167,4,2,5,13,4.9263,4.3260000000000005,0.944,15.729,No,1422
montri-thai-warrenville,Jon F.,rkZYr1Rf6aASwDYNjrXIiA,ch8xq8Zi91nYCYAO-rO-XA,"Very cool little place.  If you had any question about it - the service is TOP NOTCH!

We arrived hoping to finish dinner by the closing time we thought was 9 (actually 10) on a Friday.  The place wasn&#39;t too full, but the decor and setup is very clean and modern while still being comfy.  We took a bit of extra time to order since we wanted to scan the whole menu to see what they had to offer, and the waitress was extremely polite and not bugging us, but attentive none the less.

We ordered some Thai Tea that really stuck to your gums.  The very good flavor hung around in your mouth if you let it.  Then we decided on some Tom Kha Kai which came in a plenty large enough bowl to share (but not too large as to leave you groaning).  The flavor was very good but there was an interesting aspect - bell peppers.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but it was unfamiliar for the dish (as well as a couple of others).  Probably just something to get used to.

We also had the Pad See Eiw which was delicious, but the noodles may have been fried too much (unless they started with a different wide noodle than I&#39;m used to) as they were a bit too hard to cut with a fork and or spoon.  We commented to the waiter and he said he would tell the chef and thanked us for our opinion.  The dish also had broccoli instead of collard greens, but the flavor was great either way.

The other dish we ordered was the spicy catfish.  It was a very good mixture of red curry and coconut milk with a spice that I thought I was going to need to spice up at first, but set in to the perfect cruise to spice town.

When the waiter went to wrap up our food he noticed that we did not have much rice and, without asking, packed a nice, full extra container for us to take.  Awesome!


I really liked the lounge-style oldies that were playing the whole time we were there (Beatles, Doors, Steely Dan, etc) and the waiter also noted that they will be featuring live jazz once a month (2nd Friday?) and possibly more often if it is popular.

We visited Reserve 22, at Village Links, on a Fri nite in May &#39;15. The place was already very busy at 7, not so much with golfers coming off the links, but with diners who made &#34;22&#34; their target for the evening. A loud boisterous crowd filled the dining room, the large bar, and most of the terrace. Video screens covered sports of the day.

Service was very attentive, and there was plenty of staff to handle the large crowd as well as keep problems down and service up.

&#34;22&#34; is not the usual clubhouse dining. A long list of craft and specialty beers, and wines, are offered. They do have typical soup/salad/sandwich menus, but also an interesting list of small plates and sides, from $3 to about $15. A limited list of plate dinners ran mostly below $20. We had chicken linguini w/artichokes and bistro steak w/truffle/parmigiana fries. The steak was no filet but was well prepared and nicely dressed with a savory, slightly tangy sauce. The fries were to die for! I devoured the whole mountain of them. The chicken pasta, a large serving, was very good and included several dried tomato slices. Sides are extra.

The noisy crowd diminished about 9PM and management went to great efforts to move the band, and pull out some tables, for those who stayed for the entertainment and dancing until 11.

We have been back twice and loved everything we have tried. I adore the mango lobster roll appetizers, which are spring rolls with a peanut sauce you can spoon on yourself. I&#39;ve had the baby corn and peapod and trio delight entrees and they were both delicious. My partner had pad thai chicken and some kind of coconut curry with shrimp and pineapple that he raved about. The Jasmine iced tea is refreshing and light, too.

The banana dessert reminded me of overcooked oatmeal, but there is so much delicious food, I can skip dessert. :) I will definitely be going back often and we noticed they do a brisk carryout business, so we are looking forward to having a new carryout place that is on my way home from work.",12/11/13,110,5,2,5,27,4.648200000000001,2.0380000000000003,0.0,8.962,No,969
montri-thai-warrenville,Shannon M.,H32QTRV87Q6CGTVUm1Z4QA,F0IJC4pLixRJPxdGSebswA,"There used to be another Thai restaurant (Ariya) in this space that was only so-so, and so when we got to this location (flying blind after reading the excellent reviews here at yelp), my friend insisted that we&#39;d been there before, but I said no (I&#39;d written no review for Montri, after all!) 
At any rate, we went in to dine. Yelp, I hate to be the dissenter but I fear that I must say that Montri is carrying on Ariya&#39;s mediocre tradition.

Why? Due to pretty much everything we ordered. For an appetizer we split the Blue Sea Crispy Rolls. For a dish that claimed to contain a combo of lobster, crab, shrimp, and scallop along with carrot, cabbage and bean threads, I have to say that the seafood was almost undetectable. The taste wasn&#39;t bad for what it was, but what it was was pretty much a deep-fried veggie roll. 

For our entrees he ordered the sweet almond beef and I got the mussaman curry with chicken. Mine came in a large ceramic cauldron, a heady broth of coconut milk bobbing with potatoes and chunks of pineapple; I fished around with the serving spoon to locate the chicken I&#39;d ordered until we realized that it had been made with tofu. 

(Servers: this is what an ordering pad is for!! There is no shame in using one!!)

I snared the waitress before she got into the back, and she took it away and apparently they remade the whole dish, because my friend finished his whole meal before mine came back. It ended up being okay, but in the end I should have tried something else initially (had I known). 

His dish was alright but as he said, only serviceable. 

There were a number of interesting sounding dishes on the menu (nutty chicken, coco chicken) and a plethora of seafood dishes (including the hilariously named (Hotty Seafood), but after this experience I&#39;ll return to the safety of Le Siam further south on 59.",19/02/12,217,2,1,2,-16,1.1321,1.34,0.9530000000000001,13.706999999999999,No,1863

Called in a pick-up order and was bringing food back to some friends who own a nearby business. Upon arriving, I liked the interior and the people were friendly, but when I got the food back, I was shocked to see what was being portrayed as thai food. Got a few noodle dishes and a bunch of apps. NONE was good and none was remotely close to authentic. One step up from food court sweet and sour chicken at the mall really. Ask for spicy, and you get a 1/2 cup of red pepper flakes thrown in at the end type of crap - and the crazy thing is that people like this junk.

(I normally go to Tusk Thai in Batavia) So I work in Warrenville and came across this place online when searching for a nearby Thai restaurant. I stuck to what I know best which is why I ordered Thai fried rice with chicken. The chicken was very flavorful and delicious! Definitely exceeded my expectations! Now the rice on the other hand didn&#39;t. I&#39;m not sure what ingredient they used too much of but the taste reminded me a lot of the $1 Michelina&#39;s boxed frozen fried rice which I do not like. Price for my order was about $10 and it was a good size portion if only I had liked the flavor more. I just admit I was a tad bit disappointed that it was not as good as my favorite Thai restaurant.,10/09/14,79,3,2,3,15,2.1155,1.9060000000000001,0.484,6.61,No,771

I tried the chicken satay, and it was good, but again, not my thing. Just the flavoring of it wasn&#39;t to my liking. But it&#39;s good. Again, I hope this makes sense.

Time of my visit: Early dinner

This was my first time at Muscle Maker Grill...  I should note, I did not realize that it was a chain until after I started writing this review.  However, I will make an exception, because of the uniqueness of the chain (it&#39;s mostly located on the east coast NY/NJ area).

Off to the experience, I paced my order for pickup.  It was easy to place it, however, we wanted Warrior Nachos, but sadly they were out of chips/nachos.  I ordered Premier Burger and my girlfriend ordered Penne Romano.  When I arrived the order was ready.  I liked that!

I was a bit surprised by the portions, I guess being too long in this country, I got used to large portions.  The portion was probably right size.  My total was $17 and change, which was a bit pricey, even for this area.

Off to our food.  I could not speak to my girlfriend&#39;s food as she only let me try a little bit, but I would say, I was a bit disappointed...  The side I chose was cucumber salad.  The salad was decent, it was well seasoned.  The burger was interesting...  It seemed that the topics and the cheese over powered the taste of the meat.  The bun was good.

I would give this place a C-.  For the price I was expecting more value for the price.  Service was very good!  I would like to come back and try Warrior Nachos.",17/09/16,161,3,2,3,21,2.6663000000000006,3.008,0.171,15.821,No,1359

I was excited when I found this place offering tons of high protein/low carb options, plus nutrition information that&#39;s posted online. I ended up being pretty disappointed with my meal... I ordered the turkey taco salad, no cheese, and sour cream on the side. The turkey was broken up so fine it was almost like a meat sauce on top of lettuce, and it was lukewarm. The salsa that came on it was like jar salsa. It tasted like there was a lot of sodium in it too (and verified by their online nutrition facts). It was far from wow-ing me, that&#39;s for sure. There are healthier, more flavorful ways to punch up ground turkey to make it fantastic, and sadly, I was wishing for my own cooking as I ate this. I was only able to eat half, and the rest will be in the trash shortly. My guy got their chicken entree dinner- a grilled chicken breast, potato and steamed broccoli. Everything came out piping hot, but we never saw a piece of chicken go on their grill. He said even though the potato was steaming the entire time, it didn&#39;t taste hot, which was strange. He suspected some microwave action in play.

Since I work in Wheaton, I thought this might be a good place to grab a healthy lunch from.  Yes, I was right.  My first visit here was after a boxing class at the gym, I just wanted a protein shake...they have em! They taste great and are of decent size for the cost, and most importantly, convenient.  
The night I stopped in to pick up a shake, the woman asked me if I wanted food to go along with it, and I said no, because that was big enough for a meal, plus I watch my carb intake.  She pointed out their low carb options which brought me back here last week for lunch. I called ahead for the &#34;Texas&#34; one of their low carb solutions.  It was just perfect (and filling) for lunch.  It was still hot when I brought it back from work, plus the container is great for food prepping at home.  

This place is also a heaven sent as I&#39;m currently participating in a weight loss challenge at my gym.  I will continue to stop in at this place.  All of their nutrition information is posted online... all healthy stuff!!!!

This place caters, they deliver, they have take out and have meal plans...how cool is that?!?!  They need to open more of these, because every suburb should have one!",21/10/15,154,4,2,4,28,3.2076000000000002,2.548,0.789,11.662999999999998,No,1261

You see, I&#39;ve always carried around a bit of extra weight since late childhood, but I have taken steps to combat that, to get rid of bad eating habits, and to stay physically active. And so Muscle Maker Grill helps make Review 200, and it helps me in my quest for 200, because they offer well-portioned and well-PROportioned meals. You want high protein/low-carb? Balanced lean protein, veggie, and starch? Veggie options? It&#39;s all there. You can tell certain food items come pre-cooked, or pre-prepared in some fashion. But the price is right, and at the end of the day, someone else is doing all the food prep for you! Most meals can be split into two sensibly sized portions. Eat half now, save the rest for later.

If you&#39;re reeeeeeally not into the whole cooking/meal prep thing, they also offer meal plans that run about $7 per meal, with no weekly commitment whatsoever. I also get a 10% discount thanks to my association with the Cardinal Fitness in Glen Ellyn. With mostly healthy, and mostly guilt-free options, there&#39;s a little room to feel like you&#39;re cheating, but also plenty to make sure you stay true to your nutritional goals.

They have a nice selection that is healthier than 95% of the other offerings around town.  I had a chicken breast that was served over steamed broccoli, what a treat instead of fries.  Lots of different choices, good food, hot, cooked fresh. 
On the flip side, I have had the chicken breast sandwich and it was pretty small, about the same size bun as a Mcdonalds regular burger, and the smallest chicken breast I have seen. I think it was $9, and that came with a side. Was a little underwhelmed.
I had the godfather last time, which the menu lists as Griled chicken and Portabella mushrooms. Since I love the earthy taste of portabellas, I tried it.  Well, the vast majority of mushrooms on my dish were regular button mushrooms.  The person at the counter said they mix up both kinds.  So why doesn&#39;t it say Portabella and Button mushrooms?  If I saw an offering that said &#34;Kobe beef burger&#34;, I would expect 100% Kobe beef, not a mixture of 90% ground chuck, and 10% Kobe, right?

My friends and I really, really liked this place.  The food tasted great, which I wasn&#39;t expecting because I thought it was going to be bland health food. I was totally wrong!  This place is great!  

What I learned is that most of their food is made fresh, not frozen.  That&#39;s one of the things that makes it such a healthy option.  

First thing I noticed is our food arrived to our table steaming hot!  Sweet!  I ordered the El Mexicana from their entree menu.  It had seasoned chicken, black beans, rice, bell peppers, cheese, and salsa.  Mmmm!  It was more than I could eat.  I took some home.  They have these really cute take-home containers that are microwavable, dishwasher safe, and reusable!  I&#39;m totally saving this for future uses.  

One of my friends ordered the Rocky Balboa wrap.  The Rocky Balboa had a blend of chicken and meatballs with mozzarella cheese and a tasty sauce.  I was lucky to get a taste before my friend ate it all.  After one taste, I knew why he ate it so fast.  It was SO good!!  I think I&#39;ll order that next time.  The wrap came with a side dish.  My friend chose the spicy chunks of potato and loved them too!  

My other friend ordered the grass-fed beef burger and had a side of the greenest, brightest, most flavorful broccoli she had ever seen or tasted.  I don&#39;t know what their secret is, but this was beautiful broccoli!  The burger was incredible, so tender and juicy!

That being said, they still don&#39;t have the well rounded selection they once had. But they have bottles craft beer nonetheless.

My sister &amp; I decided to go for an early dinner on Sunday March 20th to enjoy our girl time, we chose on hooters because it&#39;s something we both thoroughly enjoy &amp; have done it every couple months, religiously might I add. This was literally the worst service I have received at this location.

They messed up our food order. Which took 40mins to come out. Mind you, it was not busy. They brought two cheeses when I asked for ranches &amp; never brought our fries.. which whatever, it was fine. Mix ups happen. I understand because I used to work in a restaurant. I was also given a dirty look when I asked for extra lemons for my water, for the second time in 20mins. So I corrected our served almost immediately about the mix up. &amp; yet, she still tried to charge me for the fries we didn&#39;t receive &amp; the cheese we very obviously didn&#39;t use or touch. When I corrected her a second time, she had the audacity to go back to the cook to check if I had fries on my plate. 

That right there should just tell you how much of a service she really was..

Carryout has seriously disappointed me on two separate occasions.  The first disappointment I ordered wings for the first NFL game of the season.  I timed it so I could be back home with the wings for kickoff.  Unfortunate for me, Hooters jacked up the entire order.  Instead of having my order ready when I got there, Hooters had to start a new one while I stood there and waited.  By the time I got home with my wings, the game was in the second quarter. 

The second carryout disappointment came this past Friday, December 12th.  When I arrived to pick up my order, they couldn&#39;t find it. Why?  Because they put it under the wrong name, (&#34;Pink&#34; instead of &#34;Kate&#34;) which took the manager forever to find.  I ordered fries and ten wings.  The fries were hard and cold; the wings were dried out and overcooked.  I live only 10 minutes from Hooters.  Food does NOT get that cold that quickly. Nothing was edible.

The second time we finally got what was owed, actually part of it. We were supposed to get a half off for the order and 2 pitchers, we got the discount, but still had to pay for the one pitcher we got. The GM said my name and what we were supposed to get was to be in their book or in the office and the manager at the time after searching several times said no. He reluctantly called the GM at home and she said the half off. Apparently she even forgot about the pitchers. We thought after that visit, the service and speed would pick up. Boy we were wrong, I don&#39;t know why everyone in our group wants to go back. Our waitress this time, Alexis was good at taking our orders, but when it came to taking care of extra needs like silverware, hand wipes, and extra sauce it was horrible. Never saw silverware and had to ask for the hand wipes. Refills were far and few, one person in our group had iced tea and when he asked for a refill, they didn&#39;t have any more and had to get a diet Pepsi instead. Wouldn&#39;t you think if the place is still open that they would still have tea available. Usually around 11:20 or so, you can see the girls cleaning up and straightening up tables for the next day. I get it was busy earlier with the Blackhawks game on and some other sporting events, but come on you are open til midnight. Our waitress, was not very attentive and when one at our table asked for blue cheese dressing, it took a good 10 minutes. The refills took about as long. I don&#39;t get how two buffalo chicken sandwiches, a philly cheese steak sandwich and an order of wings all with tots or onion rings can take 30-40 minutes. Flagging down a manager to ask him won&#39;t do any good, since you can&#39;t rush frying chicken. 
I ordered no cheese on my sandwich and it had cheese, I didn&#39;t want to risk the food going back only not to receive a sandwich back. The onion rings that came with the food were nothing more than frozen onion rings you can get at a grocery store and I got maybe 8 rings. When you order tots or fries, the plate is loaded with them.

Our server was prompt and well-endowed (Duh!) but very listless.  Not that I expected rah-rah fanfare, but at least crack a smile now and then.

The mediums wings had no sauce or flavor on them and the hot wasn&#39;t hot at all. And then there was a piece of shrimp tail fried up in chicken. The cold mexicurly fries were made worse by the fact that they are made with cheese that tastes like bland melted velveeta. The food was terrible in general. Literally, my stomach hurts. Then after our food was given to us, the waitress did not check on us once. Didn&#39;t ask the food was, nothing. We watched her run around servicing other tables, but not ours. We had to flag her down just to get the check. We usually tip very well. I mean VERY well, but not this time. Disappointed in the service I left a two dollar tip.

Our party of ten made a reservation for 7:00 on a Saturday night.  The owner said that our large group would overwhelm the kitchen at that hour if we ordered all at once.  So we changed our time to the less-busy 6:30, and we ordered a little here and a little there.  We didn&#39;t need to eat all at the same time, so that wasn&#39;t an issue. 
     
Chips and salsa took over an hour to arrive.  And the rest of the food came out at odd intervals, with no apparent rhyme or reason; dishes did not arrive in the order in which they had been ordered. 
    
We had to wait unbelievably long times for the rest of our food: two members of our party waited TWO TO THREE HOURS -- yes, you read that correctly -- for their meals (one a quesadilla, the other a flatbread of some sort).

Needless to say, I don&#39;t think they place can be classified as an authentic Mexican restaurant. There are plenty of Puerto Rican infused items in the menu. The appetizer for example was a goat cheese and meat stuffed plantain with a savory salad and rue on top. I wish I could re-call the name. 

Date and I ordered the exact same meal, but were told there was only one. So I compromised since there was the skirt-steak chefs special on the menu. As a rule of thumb, I never order skirt steak. Is a poor cut and chewey. However, not far from edible. I can&#39;t say that I enjoyed my dish, much more of a personal preference than anything. The skirt steak wasn&#39;t worth all the chew.

That would not be that bad if we were downtown chicago or if the drink was even worth it, but the drink was extremely small , almost all ice and oranges.

I had three very small drinks.  21.00 plus $9.00 upgrade.   Wow!

The service was slow to say the least. Appetizers took forever. Drinks you might have well brought your own. In defense of the server the restaurant was way under staffed our server was actually making his own drinks. Two of the 7 meals came out 20 minutes after the others and they offered us 20% off just the 2 meals. Now to the check. Charged for 12 margaritas  when we only ordered 7. Had a coupon that the server did not want to honor. Waited 15 minutes for the owner/manager to come to our table. When he finally arrived he agreed to take the  coupon.

rubi-agave-latin-kitchen-whiskey-and-tequila-bar-homer-glen,Scott G.,9DL5SLqur_MUF6TZ6-qU9w,cldpxFW4dvl51GBMV2bgCg,"Over a year ago I gave a great ***** review. Chef Reuben, you MUST be hemorrhaging money. Your food is good &amp; original. You need management at the front of your house.  Train your staff.  Fire your ponytailed bartender. Your own family is going to kill your business. 

Since my original review my wife &amp; I have been back at least 1/2 dozen times. This was the 2nd time we actually walked out and we won&#39;t ever come back.  The service was so bad this time it outweighed the unique cuisine. 

Rule number one in the restaurant business is don&#39;t bring out a humongous bussing cart when there&#39;s people walking through the restaurant. The busboy ran right into my wife&#39;s chair and nearly knocked her over, he looked at her, and just moved on. No excuse me, no apology.

The waitress came to our table bringing only two waters for three people. She said she would be right back with another water and we never saw the water come until 30 min later.  We immediately ordered two empanadas appetizers and two whiskey Manhattans straight up.  The waitress asks us what type of glass we wanted. I told her it normally served in a martini glass.  She returned to the table with short rocks glasses, warm, and they were half full.  I had to explain to her what a martini glass was and she said that the bartender told her this is the way HE does it.  Now I&#39;ve been drinking Manhattan&#39;s for over 20 years. I&#39;ve never had it served in a short rocks glass. It wasn&#39;t iced or shaken.  I asked the waitress to bring me a martini glass and poured my drink into it.  I showed her that it was only about one third filled and on top of that after taking a small sip, it definitely was not a Manhattan made with proper ingredients or proportions &amp; since there was no ice, I thought it strange my regular drink lacked flavor. I would hope it wasn&#39;t watered down but I&#39;m suspicious. Basically it was only 1 ounce of warm booze (I know how much a short rocks glass holds).  She apologized and said she would speak with the bartender.

She came back only after I had to take my empanadas appetizer from the table next to us (it had been carelessly dropped on the wrong table by the food runner without comment) and the people at the table were kind enough to ask if that was our order.  When she returned she told me again the bartender told her that this is the way HE makes a Manhattan.  I told her this is completely wrong and definitely the wrong proportion after I showed her how much was in the martini glass. 

At that point the hostess  saw we were getting aggravated and came over to talk to us.  I asked her to have Ruben come out and speak with us regarding the service. After a quick run to the kitchen she said he was cooking and didn&#39;t have time to come out and talk.  I told her that will be here a while and if we if he has two minutes to come out to talk please do so. He was probably the only person back there so we never did see him.

A few minutes later the bartender, a young kid with a long ponytail (I believe he&#39;s Ruben&#39;s cousin), came over to see what the problem was.  I explained to him that after working 10 years in the restaurant business including professionally bartending, I&#39;ve never seen a Manhattan made this way.  I even told him what the correct proportions were. His response was &#34;I used to bartend in New York and I know how to make a Manhattan&#34;. I explained to him you can go online and see what the proper proportions are and take a look at any picture of a Manhattan in a martini glass and it does not look one third filled!  Again his response was &#34;well that&#39;s how I make them.&#34;  I said to him that if that is the way he bartended in New York, no wonder he&#39;s not working there anymore.  I kindly asked him to take the drinks away since he decided that he knows best.

Now I have had that kid wait on us before as a server, and he was horrible and unattentive. Why they would have him behind the bar when he clearly does not know how to bartend is beyond me.

At this point for over a half hour had passed and the waitress had still not taken our food order. She apologized for the behavior of the bartender, sort of shrugged it off and took our order.  After another 10 minutes &amp; mulling over the whole situation we decided to just pay for the empanadas &amp; leave. 
I left my name and phone number for Chef Ruben to call me as I really want to see him succeed. The place is nice, well decorated, and has awesome food.  The issue is he has his family working behind the bar &amp; serving. These were certainly not professionally trained waiters waitresses &amp; bartenders. In fact, they&#39;re going to kill his business.  The food is consistently good &amp; the service is consistently the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced. 

Chef Ruben, you really need to do something about the front of the house. You lost at least a $100 tab from us. Family or not, you need to fire the staff, hire a professional bartender as well as someone who has the ability to train your servers. A manager up there is a MUST!",13/04/15,530,1,1,1,-57,0.6533,5.105000000000001,3.9820000000000007,49.91400000000001,No,5118

This could be due to the low alcohol content of the cocktails, the 45 minutes it took for them to arrive at the table or both. Add another hour to get how long we waited for our appetizers - which we ordered at the same time as our drinks - to be ready. Is the kitchen cooking with Bic lighters or something? Why should it take that long to melt cheese? The service was so lousy, it seemed intentional. A few members of our party actually got up and left rather than deal with the BS.

First, I&#39;m shocked that anyone thinks these drinks are strong ...

We initially when in for the Brazilian dancers which were awesome but was ruined because we were sat all the way in the back when clearly there were tables open.

The best part is that we waited another 30 mins for our check after waiting and waiting - maybe this joint should be called Waiting Rubi! Our server was sweet but does not know the menu and was not on her game. 

The food was actually pretty good but not anything to rave about- there was not a lot of choices and for what you would pay there you would pay in the city for way better concoctions. 

My husband and I decided to confront the owner, which was really weird. There wasn&#39;t a sincere apology it was more of an excuse. Excuses that went on forever. First, it was an off night, the server was new, people called off, our food is made to order, it was packed.... Here&#39;s some advice - I don&#39;t care what the excuse is - you had entertainment come in - you should be on your a game knowing more people may be there for it... Packed? Again, what are you smoking? Packed would mean there are people lined up waiting - there were tons of tables and spaces at the bar open.... New server? More like bad training ... 
Here&#39;s the icing on the cake: we were pretty much forced to having a dessert shot on the house as a sorry excuse for a comp of any sort. I asked what was in it because it was interesting ... I got two ingredients ( milk and roasted coconut) listed and then &#34;some other special things&#34;, really? You don&#39;t know what your shots are made of? Not surprised since everyone we asked questions to about drinks or food items had to take a moment ask over their head piece.... Not wise to not know what&#39;s in your food or drinks if you have someone ask because they have an allergy or restriction - lawsuit anyone? 

$65 later and 2.5 hours we finally were able to pick up and leave ... Unfortunately I was looking forward to coming here but it&#39;s nothing special ... It&#39;s a wannabe latin dance club with amped up Mexican food... Great entertainment but that will only hold you up for so long - best of luck to Rubi but I won&#39;t be back! 

If you&#39;re looking for real latin vibes head to Nacional, Carnival or Rios in the city - $65 will get you food, drunk and dancing all night :)",18/10/14,301,1,1,3,-47,2.2996999999999996,1.7939999999999998,1.52,17.686,No,2960

Extremely disappointed in the service and quality of food. I have worked in this industry and consider myself a good judge. This place needs to reevaluate their menu as the food is bland and tapas size portions in the selections we ordered. The service is the slowest and most uneducated I have ever encountered. I would strongly encourage the manager to retrain all staff in liquor selections and customer service. If you promote yourself as a tequila and whiskey bar your staff should be able to take a simple cocktail order. You make your money on your bar service and this is the slowest service I&#39;ve ever had. And delivered incorrectly.

The mango one had nice hunks of mango too!

Very interesting menu, things I had never seen before. Ordered guacamole and chips, great fresh guacamole!! I had the quesadilla which was the size of a pizza! Very interesting and good!  Definitely coming back.

I arrived to a full parking lot but that&#39;s what&#39;s to be expected on a Friday themed night.  I found parking and headed in.  No one greeted me at the door.  I found my friends at the bar where upon my arrival they mentioned, good luck getting a drink - great.  Everyone on staff appeared to have at least two jobs.  The bartender was running food from the kitchen, taking orders and tending bar.  There was a guy in back who I can only assume is cooking is running dinner orders out.  The rest of the staff looked confused an disoriented and could not keep up with demand.  45 minutes after my arrival, I order my first drink.  20 minutes later while seated at the bar, it arrives.  The couple sitting next to me at the bar waited so long to pay their bill they eventually gave up and walked out without paying.  The bartender never noticed and the tab from the persons previously sitting in their seats was still sitting on the bar top.  My drink arrives, and the bar tender never asks for payment or for a card to run my tab.  Later in the night when it takes us 20 minutes to flag her down to pay she now tries to figure out who ordered what and who is paying and how.  She messes this up three times, coming back on several occasions for repeat instructions.  She approaches my friend to pay who has a tab open and my friend has to tell her she already has her card.  There was no system in place for getting seated at the tables since my friends had put our name in at 6:30 and by the time we left several hours later - were never seated or approached for a table.  I can&#39;t say enough bad things about the service and hopefully I never return.  It&#39;s a shame because it has the possibility of being a good place to go.

The drinks were very delicious and would be the only factor in my return.  Most likely I would never go back, however if I did it would be on a Wednesday night at 4 p.m.",16/02/15,212,1,1,3,-7,2.3567,1.884,0.96,19.157,No,1973

I love the warm paint on the walls and the stone bar not to forget the gorgeous patio. The new owners have worked wonders in this place. We started with the chips and salsa, this is not your average Pepes salsa this salsa has levels of flavor sweet, spicy, sweet and spicy again just enough to leave your mouth wanting more. From there we went to the tamale and taco duos. The tamales were mind blowing. The masa was not dry at all and awesomely sweet  the pork was seasoned perfectly and the whole thing garnished beautifully with a drizzle of crema. The tacos were solid seasoned and cooked perfectly next time I would try the steak. Even the little side salad was delicious dressed in something delicious I couldn&#39;t define.

My husband, daughter and I went, we had a taste for Mexican food so I thought go give Rubi Agave a try! The chips and salsa are VERY small in portion but NOT price. We were left chewing our finger nails because our tummies were hurting from hunger pains waiting for our food. Our dinner had finally arrived! 1 quasadilla 2 burritos and THATS it!!! No beans, no rice, no jalapeÌ±os and carrots no refill on our chips!! Nothing else but the quasadilla and 2 burritos and 12 pieces of lettuce that was referred to as the spring salad that came complimentary with the overpriced burrito that lacked not only character but taste. I&#39;m not used to this way of a traditional Mexican dinner/restaurant I mean come on who doesn&#39;t have carrots,jalapeÌ±os or fricken rice!

I didn&#39;t realize before coming that it&#39;s connected to an upscale grocery store. But not to worry, this is a casual and welcoming place to stop for lunch with pretty reasonable prices. 

You walk up to order at the counter and take a number to your seat. What was different at this place though was a server continues checking in after bringing your food. They were friendly and attentive. 

I can be nervous eating out since I&#39;m sensitive to several different foods,  follow the Paleo AIP diet, and am also gluten free. I didn&#39;t call ahead or ask very specific questions, they didn&#39;t bat an eye when I ordered a gluten free and dairy free salad with no pepper or seasonings. I didn&#39;t ask specifically about oils or seasonings on the meat, but felt I was pretty safe ordering the kale salad with salmon. Just asked them to leave off the nuts, cheese, and seeds. Then did oil and vinegar dressing at the table. The salmon didn&#39;t seem seasoned with pepper or any other obvious pre-marinade.

It&#39;s has an upscale modern grill connected to a grocery store (similar to Trader Joe&#39;s only pricier).  I leave from there disappointed today from my choice to go there for breakfast, a choice I will likely not make in the future.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy with the sunny side up eggs, my husband- the omelet with fruit (substituted for the hashbrowns).  Aside from the waiter - service was a major issue.  Starting out the cashier seemed confused and couldn&#39;t answer a single question without consulting someone else - our questions were simple no brainer&#39;s (gravy on the side, replace hashbrowns for fruit, etc.) which clearly she wasn&#39;t trained to know the answer for in advance.  There was just a handful of people, yet it took several minutes for it to arrive at the table.  When it was delivered our food was cold &amp; my sunny side eggs were broken and running all over the plate. (my husband didn&#39;t send his back) I told the runner (that delivered the food) that the food was cold &amp; requested that it be remade as I&#39;m not one to accept this.  He took the plate and returned within a few minutes with the same plate (leaving the gravy), which as still cold and appeared to be slightly microwaved. He had to take the gravy back to be microwave it at a separate trip.  When the waiter came back we told him that this isn&#39;t acceptable - at that point I was so frustrated I simply wanted to leave.  After that the manager came to the table (after telling the waiter we didn&#39;t want to talk to her) and tried to pick up our check as compensation.  I quickly told her that wasn&#39;t the point and declined the offer.  I reminded her that in Naperville&#39;s competitive restaurant market service issues of this litany has brought many restaurants before it out of business - service is paramount and expected.  She proceed to make excuses that they have no plate warmers in their kitchen, that they just started service breakfast 6 or so weeks ago.  Again, not a valid excuse when I&#39;ve been in Standard Market multiple times with every table filled and not had those issues.  I&#39;ve given it three stars because the food is high quality and for the most part good.  However, the service issues for me will be a deal-breaker with future visits.  I&#39;m disappointed, because the food is for the most part on point, but service for me will trump that every time.  My suggestion is to hire a manager with experience - it seems that the staff&#39;s training is lacking.  Service is king in Naperville - especially when you can go a different restaurant every day for an entire year &amp; never hit the same one twice!  The restaurants that make it long-term in Naperville have mastered service first and foremost - coupled with good food and portion size.  I give it three stars because it&#39;s not been this way every time.",06/11/16,300,3,3,0,53,-0.6783000000000002,0.867,1.085,23.048,No,2969
standard-market-grill-naperville,Brian C.,dBaqCO-JMhlohTPtCtpRJg,Tyv69FfhRlHwoOdIBnCPTg,"This review is for the Grill. My wife and I visited last night, and this place is a circus. Upon ordering we noticed a customer actually in the kitchen! The guy was complaining about his food, and the staff let him back there, where he had his hands and arms on the serving station. It was crazy, and the staff were completely absorbed by the event, and paying no attention to the customers. 

The food- Uggh! the worst. I ordered a chimmichuri steak with potatoes. What I got was an overcooked piece of meat (worst cut possible), and a pound of green potatoes. Flavorless and terrible. My wife had a fairly uninspiring turkey burger.

We have noticed over the past several months that service level and quality is declining steadily there. At the end of the day, this place is a grocery store, and they need a lot of improvement in basic food preparation and restaurant operations.",31/10/16,101,1,1,-1,-11,-1.6757,0.115,1.818,11.067,No,882

I generally order a Buddha bowl, and never know which mix of vegetables I will get.  Sometimes there are mushrooms, sometimes not.  Sometimes leafy greens, sometimes endemine.  For being &#34;standard&#34; the recipe seems to vary a lot.  The line when you order carry out can be frustrating too.  You watch your food sit and get cold while the slow, young staff attempts to take orders of those in front.  A carry out register would help.

I tried the stir fry and a sandwich because I had read about them on other reviews. They were fine, pleasant and adequate.

standard-market-grill-naperville,Alex P.,WXpBhNFoVhNhEh3dcWl-hw,OvUaPbDR9oQt_hsTy1Hatg,"The food here is always great. A big variety and huge portions. The problem with The Standard Market Grill is their service. My family and I have been coming here for lunch since they opened, and each time we have come the service is always extremely slow. You wouldn&#39;t think that based on the amount of staff they have working all day, but it&#39;s true. When meals should take approximately 10 or so minutes to arrive at your table, they take closer to 20 or minutes. For a casual dining place, that is way too long. And if you&#39;re expecting refills on your drink, forget about it. You&#39;ll get your drink 10 min after you sit down and a server won&#39;t be back well after you&#39;re done eating.

standard-market-grill-naperville,Kelly K.,KG7g8D87x7wgUwhGKX0rbA,5LOZNwq0-WJ6I1nuGGmGow,"Ok. So I&#39;ve gotten food from standard market grill on three different occasions now. Food has always been great. I have ordered the kids sliders and fries because it is a big enough portion for an adult, and I love them. I order them with sweet potato fries that come with delicious honey mustard sauce. On point with those. I&#39;ve also tried their Buddha bowl with steak and it is also absolutely delicious. 

My beef here is the drinks and how much they charge for how LITTLE you get also with the service* I&#39;ve had the past two times. 

My second visit I ordered a milkshake for $5 and it came in a smaller glass, which wasn&#39;t that big of a deal because I added a bunch of stuff to it and honestly smaller portions are better for you (contradicting their meal portions). Today I ordered a LARGE size of their strawberry banana juice and I got my cup, same size as the milkshake but it was HALF full. The girl bringing me the drink asked the one who poured it if it was correct, the girl who poured it rudely said &#34;that&#39;s how much they get&#34;. I would have stayed and asked to speak with a manager but I was already running late for work.

My advice: Skip the drinks and just order water with your food. Maybe get it to go as well, I&#39;ve had rude and snooty service two out of the three times I&#39;ve been there. But alas, I will be back to try more things on the menu.",10/07/15,156,3,2,3,34,2.5385,1.6790000000000003,0.42,11.902000000000001,No,1399
standard-market-grill-naperville,Ashley M.,YMYb73K3Dv3oiac4mADJSg,_khnKS1HmSfTYaa7116oXw,"My boyfriend and I came here for Sunday brunch after doing a quick search on the highest rated brunch choices in the area. Standard Market Grill had the best ratings and all the positive reviews and pictures looked promising. Located next to the Standard Market, the grill is its restaurant offering fresh fare. I was expecting a full service restaurant and was surprised to see an ordering counter as soon as you walk in. There&#39;s a digital menu beyond the counter and to be honest, I was looking for more variety in brunch options. If I didn&#39;t want a sandwich or salad, it seemed my options were limited to one of two omelets, a breakfast burrito, or a Belgian waffle. I quickly decided on a hanger steak and mushroom omelet, which is exactly what it sounds like and is served with standard breakfast potatoes (diced potatoes mixed with onions and peppers) or fresh fruit. Choice of white bread, whole grain bread, or English muffin. Strawberry jam and butter on the side. We were given a buzzer, told to grab our waters from their water station, and find our seats. 

Now is time to note that I like the layout of the restaurant. There&#39;s an indoor dining area; a semi-outdoor dining area with views of the pond, high windows and a cozy fireplace, and an outdoor dining area with wooden chairs and large umbrellas. There&#39;s a sign in the center table directing you to place your buzzer there and we did as instructed. Shortly thereafter, a server appeared, grabbed our buzzer from us, and assured us our food would be out soon. We waited only a short time and our food arrived. 

My omelet was fluffy and well-seasoned, with bits of hanger steak and mushroom through the egg instead of inside the omelet itself. I&#39;m not a huge meat person, but I think they could have definitely been more generous with the steak, especially at $9 for the omelet. Perhaps there was even an adequate amount of meat in my omelet and I just couldn&#39;t tell because it was chopped up and mixed with the egg and mushroom. The potatoes were heavily seasoned, and the onions and peppers gave it more flavor. The English muffin was also delicious, and I appreciated the fresh butter and strawberry jam.

After delivering our food, our server did not come back to check on us and didn&#39;t seem to be anywhere near the patio area, which makes me very confused on what level of service Standard Market Grill is trying to achieve. I do not mind ordering at the counter or picking up my own drink, but then I would expect a classy place like this would offer more service than a greeting and food delivery. Overall the food is good; I&#39;m not impressed with the brunch selections but I look forward to coming back and giving lunch or dinner a shot.",11/12/15,304,3,2,5,42,5.9138,2.581,0.309,20.108999999999998,No,2744

This particular restuarant takes advatange of the fast casual trend and provides a great place to get a meal on the side of a Trader Joe&#39;sish type of a grocery store.  The place is beatiful and open with tons of places to sit.  The one thing I will have to comment on is that they are a little slow to clear down tables, as one was left dirty for quite sometime into the meal.  While I&#39;m on the downsides, their draft beer list is on a rotating screen and the person at the counter taking the order had no clue what beers were being offered.


Outside of that the food and beer selection was pretty fantastic. I ended up getting the BLAT.  It had tons of crisp bacon, nice toasted brioche bread and creamy avocado.

standard-market-grill-naperville,Caroline M.,CnUzhHxPuJCP_5z2p7gcRg,DuAibumocBjNIfZ7fVOaiA,"We went here specifically for the restaurant. Sure, the grocery store is nice as well, but the restaurant really takes the cake. The grocery store prices have niche items, so if I needed a specific ingredient and couldn&#39;t find it at a specialty store closer to me, I could probably look here. But, kind of out of my budget right now. The restaurant fits nicely within our budget, though. They have cucumber water and watermelon water, so that&#39;s free also. 

My husband ordered a chicken sandwich with chicken, cheese, and bacon. He orders a sandwich no other way. He liked it. He also had a bowl of chicken tortilla soup. He said it was good, but it was literally just chicken and tortilla chips. Usually there is some corn, tomatoes, beans, etc. in the soup, but not in this one. It was more of a chicken chili. Also, it came with tortilla chips on top..and a dinner roll...and packaged oyster crackers..so carb heaven.

I ordered the veggie burger and I can confirm that it is not just a Morningstar or Boca burger patty. I asked and they do make them daily. Granted, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a given, but it seems like most restaurants just use frozen patties. Anyway, it was delicious and I would order it again. Maybe without the BBQ sauce (I&#39;m just not a super BBQ fan). I did like the buttermilk garlic, though. 

And the fries...oh. the fries. Delicious. Freshly made and really, really good. If you&#39;re trying to be healthy and order a salad, good for you. The fries are worth it.

Only downside is the seating. There needs to be a wall separating the ordering line from the booths. Otherwise, we had people watching us the entire time we ate. And maybe a better system for seating people. There were people walking in and saving tables so that by the time we ordered, there was only one table open.

The grocery store alone is tremendous, but my lunch at the Grill took me over the top. We had the grass fed burger with white cheddar cheese, tomato bacon jam, kale slaw, and red onion on a pretzel roll. I ordered it medium and it came out light pink in the middle and juicy. The jam was quite strong, but I liked how the raw onion cut the flavor. And you can&#39;t go wrong with a pretzel roll. 

I also had the mustard honey chicken sandwich. Pretzel batard, grilled chicken, Monterey Jack cheese, roasted red pepper, bacon, avocado, Bibb lettuce, red onion, mustard-honey. Everything just came together perfectly. I&#39;d order it again for sure.

And the sides are great. The market side salad as these soft cornbread croutons. There is no crouton anywhere near as good as these. And it&#39;s true, get the sweet potato fries. Incredibly thick, nicely seasoned, and a good honey-mustard dipping sauce. I want some chicken fingers for that mustard!!!

The Arnold Pomer was a really good drink; it&#39;s basically an Arnold Palmer with pomegranate juice. Very refreshing and refills are free. And there are no salt and pepper shakers. They give you a grinder that has coarse salt on one end and peppercorns on the other. You grind either side, so both the salt and pepper are as fresh as can be. Awesome.

They finally made it and the cashier was very apologetic and she seemed to be the only one who wanted to help me out. But no drink while I wait or cookie to leave with. Anyways I leave, start eating my salad and it&#39;s missing ingredients, this is the second time they have forgot to put avocado in my salad! I get this salad at least once a week and it&#39;s usually good. For $12 it should be made right every time!

We were there for a party and unfortunately I snagged my pants on a nail sticking out of a booth.

The Super 7 with grilled salmon was excellent, and I was impressed with the craft beer selection on tap.  I&#39;ll definitely be back to walk through the market area, which definitely looks to give Whole Foods or Mariano&#39;s some stiff competition.

Came here for lunch. It is the type of place where you order at the register but then have a server from there on out. Brock and I split the mushroom/goat cheese pizza (AHH goat cheese!!) and the blue cheese steak sandwich. We were lucky enough to find a seat on the patio where we waited with our pager-thingy. The neat thing is that the pager has a gps of some sort so your server can tell where you sit and bring your food to you. We even moved seats once and he figured it out!
Our food was brought quickly and was delish! The pizza was larger than I expected, definitley sharing size, and the sandwich was average size. The pizza was a kind-of cross between a flatbread and a regular pizza, kind of rustic, with perfect crust. The steak sandwich was cooked well, rare, and was of average tenderness. It still got stuck in between your teeth as rare steak typically does. The star of the sandwich though was the blue cheese aioli. It was not too pungent but you certainly knew it was there. I am not a HUGE blue cheese fan but this was balanced perfectly. The sandwich was paired with fries which were average if you ask me, I don&#39;t know what other Yelpers are raving about there.
The service was excellent as was the value. Our freshly squeezed lemonade even came with refills which NEVER EVER happens. Our server was attentive but not overbearing and came with warm chocolate chip cookie chunks to accompany our check. 
The patio is small so the seating is a little tight but I love eating outdoors. I&#39;ll be returning if i&#39;m in the neighborhood.",13/07/15,174,5,1,5,8,5.2955000000000005,2.531,0.22999999999999998,20.239,No,1658

The market has a variety of culinary pleasures including HOOK&#39;S aged cheddar.  Lots of items you wont even find at WF though I found the prices to be comparable.  

It lost one star due to how small it is, imagine how much more stuff you could fill in here if the place was bigger.  Moving along, you can find helpful staff and pre-bagged dinners, with fresh ingredients to make dinner/lunch yourself OR you can pick up pre-made.  I believe there are different meals depending on the day of the week.  The day we went they had a pre-bagged steak dinner and pre-packaged knuckle rolls (lobster salad sammies) YUM. 

As we moseyed around we saw people drinking wine next to the cheese counter area, will have to come back to check that out.

Last, the GRILL.  We opted to sit outside because the weather was perfect and started with the chicken tortilla soup which was excellent.  We shared, the Pulled Pork Pizza, the Molten Grilled Cheese, a side of hand cut fries and Kale Slaw.  All were fantastic.  

Everything from start to finish was tasty, we will definitely be back again, and again, and again.  :)",27/06/15,146,4,2,4,32,3.7428,2.849,0.172,10.979999999999997,No,1183

This is a Chef driven business so everything seems to be pretty top choice^_^ almost everything is top quality with almost no artificial preservatives/additives.

Now when I walked into this fine establishment on this fine day and observed the fine menu board rich with options, I was blinded by my previous experience. I ordered the Brunch Burger, a delicacy by my standards, and my amigo ordered the Brisket Grilled Cheese. I had been resting in the booth with my good friend when after an extended period of time my friend had his meal and I was still waiting for my glorious sandwich. I had to go say something to the server and finally I had the beloved burger in front me. Considering the quality of food served here, I had high hopes that have never been disappointed before. You would think frying an egg is a simple task, but it seems the chefs that day had it out for my immune system (as in salmonella, which is rampant uncooked eggs). As for my friends brisket grilled cheese, it was less than satisfactory. He considers himself a connoisseur of brisket having eaten and enjoyed it for many years (he&#39;s pretty old but that&#39;s just between you and me). As I enjoyed my bacon and burger (minus the egg) I periodically looked over at him taking large slices of fat off of his grilled cheese. While I am no professor of brisket according to him this is one of the worst sins possible in meats. Over half of the brisket were large pieces of fat. With the combination of the poor service, and the lackluster elements of the food, Standard Market Grill was not up to standard",22/11/15,159,3,3,5,54,4.227900000000001,2.026,0.497,10.477,No,1530

I ordered the Mediterranean Salad and it was one of the top three salads I have ever had - absolutely delicious!  It comes with grilled salmon, balsamic dressing, field greens, Campari tomatoes, focaccia croutons, cucumber, feta, and Kalamata olives.  The salmon was perfectly seasoned and cooked - tender and not overdone.  The dressing was sweet and had the right amount of bite from the balsamic vinegar.  Everything tasted fresh and was cut in small pieces for dainty eating.  I could not put my fork down, lol.

I also enjoyed the flavored waters - not sure what was in mine, haha.  Maybe labels might be helpful?...  ;)

A very very high priced market, actually overpriced in many areas.  But it has some interesting options.  The &#34;dinner for two&#34; appears to be a good deal coming in at around $18.00, including a salad, entree, vegetable/starch and dessert.  everything I put my hands on was expensive to me... unnecessarily so in many instances.  I think the market caters to a different kind of ego that could care less about how much something costs.  That&#39;s okay, just turns me off. Obviously the meat counter is phenomenal, but I can do better at Caputo&#39;s. The cheese and wine selection is large and varied, top of the line.  The Grill is a nice option for lunch.  It has an attractive bar, replete with a lot of craft beers.  They make a good steak sandwich, and the fries are great.  That&#39;s all I had so far along with an excellent craft beer.  They try to take very very good care of you but customer service is sketchy, which is surprising.  It&#39;s a nice experience, and I will go back just out of curiosity, or to pick up dinner for two.

He was skeptical about this place because of the fact that it&#39;s a chain restaurant. The first night we ate here, it was dead quiet and empty. We were thinking about ordering some of the small app&#39;s for $3 (I think) when a neighboring couple said they were REALLY small. So we skipped it.

I almost always order the buffalo blue chicken salad. The chicken is crispy and awesome tasting. I accidentally got the bigger portion with soup and was sad it didn&#39;t have a roll (like I got with lunch). On a second visit, I got the smaller portion and it came with bread.

The salad is huge and the ingredients are really fresh and tasting. I love the tomato soup with the two cheesy fritter things. It&#39;s just out of this world. I usually can tell you what my partner ordered and what he liked, but I was too busy enjoying my yummy salad.

The service was good, the tables clean, the food was outstanding. My only problem is that Houlihan&#39;s isn&#39;t closer to home. Should I sell my house? Probably not. But it was worth the extra drive and considering it takes 20 minutes to get here, it was strange that we would come back within a week.

The dinning event started a little slow, waited nearly 15 minutes for wait staff to notice us, and it wasn&#39;t very busy, but once they did notice us the service and food were outstanding. 

We arrived before 7 pm on Monday and were able to take advantage of the drink and appetizer specials. $2 off select draft &amp; bottled beer $3 off Blue Taboo &amp; Raspberry Peach Sangria. 

The waiter went out of his way to make sure we got a sampling of everything we asked for, which included Left Hand Milk Stout, served at the correct temperature and a sampling of the Sriracha Thai peanut sauce from the Sriracha salad. 

Glad we went for a full order of GOAT CHEESE AND ARTICHOKE POPPERS. Amazing! We nearly licked the plate. 

We enjoyed the BUFFALO BLEU SALAD with a 20 oz glass of Allagash White on draft and the STEAK &amp; WEDGE SALAD with RASPBERRY PEACH SANGRIA. 

Don&#39;t be fooled, the Steak &amp; Wedge Salad was more like a petit cut steak dinner. The steak was cooked to order and served on the side, along with asparagus and the lettuce wedge with just enough dressing. We asked for the roasted pecans to be served on the side as well, which we were glad we did. The pecans had a chili flavor to them. 

The Raspberry Peach Sangria was a great compliment to the Steak &#34;Salad&#34;.  It was served as a fully poured wine glass with an added small decanter, enough for a second glass. 

We know we have been to Houlihan&#39;s before, but can&#39;t say why we hadn&#39;t been there in a while. However, we do know we will be visiting again really soon to enjoy a full glass of that Stout, some of poppers, and steak salad.",06/09/16,190,4,1,5,4,5.8324,2.881,0.129,12.99,No,1695

I ordered the stuffed chicken. When the food came, my friend began eating her salad and immediately bit into bacon which she had asked to have excluded from the salad. Ok, we were at this point running late for a movie so she picked out the bacon and kept eating, but after the wine mistake we began to wonder if it was the server or the cook. Well, I was happily digging into my chicken. I got about halfway through it, and I kept waiting for the cream cheesy stuffing to flow out. When it never did, I opened up the chicken, which was basically 2 breasts cooked together, and there was no filling.....at all! What? I still don&#39;t know who was running the show and making the mistakes but since the quality of the chicken was good and we were only getting later for our movie, I didn&#39;t want to deal right then with anyone offering to bring something else or correct the error(s).

I went here with my family and it took about ten mins to get seated when the place was dead on a Saturday night. When we did get seated it was right behind the hostess booth with a bunch of high school age workers chatting and hanging out. About another 15 mins go by and the waiter finally comes with no waters, etc ( mind you there was maybe four other tables there). I swear we almost went through the whole beer list and they were out of everything, even your basic domestics.

 The waiter had to go and check after everyone we tried to order too (half the time we saw him go back and play on his phone or chat for a bit before returning). We finally decided with some wines and ordered food. Again, this place was dead and we were waiting another 30 mins for our food. We asked to talk to the manager and told her that the wait times and beer issue was ridiculous. I can see being a out of a few, but everything you try to order? They should of used a company card and hit binnys or something to cover till they restocked the next day. She apologized with the usual responses as we continued to wait. Another 10-15 mins go by and we asked for her again. 

 We told her that it was almost an hour without any food ( no appetizers served yet either) and we were leaving. Magically the food starts to come out and more apologies.  We said we didn&#39;t care even though she offered to give us food for free. and were leaving on the principle of the whole situation. She gave us some $25 vouchers which I gave to a homeless guy the next day.

 You couldn&#39;t pay me to go back here. When a place is practically empty it shouldn&#39;t take long for anything. Just the waiters attitude was aggravating too.Like it was comical that they didn&#39;t have anything and how long it was taking. After an hour of wasting our time we ended up just cooking at home, which we should of done in the first place......


Unacceptable to run a business like this. I wish I could comment on the food but I never got to taste it. The manager needs to actually manage and not be chatty Kathy with the staff.

The wait staffs are attentive and polite. I definitely recommend this place.,19/01/15,40,4,2,4,17,3.4610000000000003,2.513,0.0,5.487,No,364

I went to their competitor Champps, and they were more than happy to work with us. So we went there with our group and happily spent $687.74 cents.

I wouldn&#39;t go here for an actual dinner or meal in general. Where Houlihan&#39;s really wins out is with a group of friends for Happy Hour drinks. Me and my coworkers frequent this place and always have a great time. The service has always been friendly and efficient. We all order some Long Island Iced Tea pitchers (Georgia Peach is my favorite!) and a bunch of appetizers (Stuffed Mushrooms, yum!).

Outside seating is available during the summer months, with it being 26 degrees outdoors who wants to sit out? We have visited in the afternoon and evenings. This place is really busy during the evening hours. Now about the staff, we had Michelle as our server yesterday and what a nice person she was. Michelle made sure that she visited the table often for refills etc. She was able to accommodate a special request for my husband. The food was delish, as always, I had the filet with smashed potatoes, French Onion soup and a garden salad. The birthday boy had the Thai Chicken, pineapple rice and the Tomato Bisque. We also ordered the Buffalo wings, brought those home for later. The salad that I had was enough for a meal in itself. Dessert was the ice cream brownie sundae,  what a brownie, deep dark chocolate, this was okay except for the whipped cream. Enjoyed the meal, the service and the fact that the manager also asked how the meal was. Keep in mind that if you register for your birthday, the meal that you have is free.

I got a seared tuna salad there...it tasted great, but could&#39;ve used more tuna. It was just meh, after that. I wasn&#39;t really full. 

The margaritas were great, but I don&#39;t think our server understood us EVER. We went for a girlfriend&#39;s birthday, and we had to constantly ask him for more drinks. We figured out that we needed to ask him 3 times before ever getting anywhere. It became the big joke of the night, how we had to ask 3 times before getting anything. It eventually became more annoying, though.

Service seems to be top notch as far as chains go too. On our last visit our waitress misunderstood and took my friend&#39;s dish rather than boxing it up. They made him a whole new salad to take home. 

The food is good, and I think Houlihan&#39;s has  by far the most exciting and creative menu of any chain. I love the small plate menu. The fish tacos are awesome! The smores fondue might be my favorite restaurant dessert ever!

Applebee&#39;s is usually very consistent with their food quality, and this location was not different.

I greatly appreciated the staff from going above &amp; beyond to make my experience a good one. I celebrated a birthday while in town for business, and I joked with both bartenders about being here while on the road.

We got a gift card for Christmas and decided to come last night. When we got here it wasn&#39;t crowded at all. We were seated right away. However, it took us a good 10 minutes to get drinks. The table next to us was getting ready to leave. By the way their table looked, you would think they just got their food. The server closed them out, sat at the bar to count her tips, got her coat and left. We finally got our drinks. 

The food was normal chain food. The onion rings were too crispy and hard to bite into. Nothing spectacular. The table next to us was still dirty and now we are losing room on our table as well with extra cups and dirty plates. 

The manager appeared to like walking around. He was the one to serve our food and kind of dropped our plates down on the table. My husband and I ordered the same thing, but mine didn&#39;t come out with everyone else&#39;s. He walked away and a couple minutes later came back with my food. He looked at the table next to us, grabbed the booster seats, looked like he was going to clean it, and walked away. 

The dinner rush is starting to come in now and everyone that walked by the dirty table looks at it and leaves. We closed out our bill and getting ready to leave. No one still touched the dirty table. 

I shouldn&#39;t let it bother me, but if they&#39;re too lazy and unorganized to clean a table, why should I come back? Most likely won&#39;t be returning.",27/12/14,186,3,1,1,-7,0.26860000000000006,1.648,1.5349999999999997,19.820000000000004,No,1537

We started off with the beer pub pretzel which are seriously amazing! And 15 hot wings. Everything was great except for  having to ask for a cup of ranch twice...

Then we ordered the triple bacon burger, I&#39;m not sure why they chose that name because it was literally just a patty with two pieces of bacon. We asked for little pink in our burgers and they came back over cooked and dry.  
Not happy at all.

What really bothered me, was when I had piled all of our dirty plates on top of one another and pushed them to the end of our table for our waitress to pick up, they were just left there. Some guy dropped of our dinner, saw the plates and did nothing. Our waitress came by to check on us and did nothing about the dirty plates and who i believe was a manager came by to check on us look at the pile of dirty plates and walked away. Come on!! 
I was a waitress and that&#39;s one of the most important things to do! Learn to pre buss your tables people!! I don&#39;t want to eat my dinner looking at dirty plates...

So it&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day and we had reservations for when they opened. It was our first time here and there was only five or six other tables sat. Drinks took a long time to get, ordering food took a long time, and getting extra anything (napkins, condiments, tortillas, etc) took a long time. Nobody made us aware of the day&#39;s specials either. I found out they existed after we ate. The food came quickly and tasted awesome! I would say today&#39;s crew was made up of inefficient servers/bar staff and/or they were short staffed
Again, the food was fantastic. 
So it came time to pay. I was short changed on purpose. My &#34;change&#34; was rounded down. Well my receipt said I was still owed a measly 46 cents. It&#39;s about the principal. The server acknowledged doing it and said she didn&#39;t have 46 cents. so it was rounded down. (So are they just taking everyone&#39;s change each shift? That&#39;s called stealing.) Two additional staff members scoffed at me and fetched 45 cents from the bar resister and made a snide remark while giving me the change. I tipped well at the table before speaking with them at the front desk on the way out and now I wish I hadn&#39;t after this treatment over the stupid 46 cents that was suppose to be mine after paying in the first place.

The food is average, although I wish I could report better.  The margaritas were actually solid and not watered down.  They also have a decent wine list.  

The salsa they bring is okay.  The green was bland to me but the red was good.  The habenero that is available upon request is the standout.  I&#39;ve gotten the sampler, which allows you to try a bunch of different things.  The sopas were my least favorite, despite the fact that I usually love them.  These were just very bland.  The taquitos, which I usually find boring, were actually better than average.  Flautas were okay and the empanades were actually solid.  We also tried the tacos, which were again good but nothing special.  I will say I really enjoyed their tamales.  That was probably the best thing I&#39;ve had.

We arrived on a Thursday night to find the place mostly empty. We sat outside. We ordered some drinks, they were ok not anything special. The chips and salsa were decent. We had queso fundido for an appetizer. It was pretty good, but the cheese was thicker than I&#39;m used to. We split the taco platter - six different types of tacos. A few of the tacos were covered in onions, more onions than meat. The fish taco was probably the best one. 

The outside area is nice but it&#39;s missing something. Some music would give a more festive feel. Clarendon Hills &#34;downtown&#34; doesn&#39;t really have much life to it.

As for the food it was beyond delicious. The homemade guacamole and salsas were to die for and we could have made a meal out of just those two things alone.

She came back a few seconds later and we were seated.

The food and drink menu were both a good size with a lot of different selections.  Free chips and salsa were placed at our table, and I was extremely disappointed with the salsa.  No one in my group ended up touching it.  I don&#39;t know how to describe the taste except it was just, off.  However, the fresh guacamole was delicious!  We wanted to order another one!

We were a party of 4.  We ordered a bottle of $35 wine.  The server came back and said that they were out of our chosen bottle, recommended another wine and said he would &#39;make a deal&#39; with us.  When the check came, the $35 wine turned into a $75 wine.  We politely protested and he brought out the owner, which is where the problem escalated.

The owner was condescending and rude. She agreed to reduce the cost from $75 to $52, stating that $52 was her cost. (I do not know of a restaurant that only marks wine up by 50%...)  When we explained that $52 was still unreasonable, and that we expected to be charged $35 for whatever the server recommended, she threw the server under the bus and tried to guilt us into paying more by saying &#34;do you think it&#39;s fair for the server to have to pay the difference&#34;.  We suggested that that was between her and her server and had nothing to do with the fact that we were dissatisfied.

This episode occurred in the middle of the restaurant at about 8pm on a Friday night. It was very uncomfortable.  We have never been in a situation where a restaurant owner did not make things right.  Our total check was about $140, so there was ample room for the owner to make an adjustment.

In the end, we had no choice but to pay the additional $17.  Unfortunately, the server ended up on the short end of the stick because his tip was reduced to account for the overcharged wine.  I routinely treat servers well (having one in the family) and tip a minimum of 20%.

Taco, pick 3 - I chose baja fish taco (which was excellent), carne asada (which on the menu was listed as just having grilled onion but ended up with some sort of sweet sauce - meh) and braised pork belly (which tasted nothing like pork belly)

Margarita - the Cadillac is much more on par with a standard margarita. The House margarita tastes like fruit punch that should be served at a 12 year old&#39;s first pool party.

aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Kris G.,3nobdo6I6BMRWMxOzbK14g,EVYLaodX7Q0EccZTSTvV7w,"I&#39;ve been to Aguamiel on three occasions. The first time I was here with a friend, I thought the food was fantastic, but that the service could be better. A lot better. I thought that since they had just opened, I would wait a while and see if there was improvement.

The second time I visited, I was meeting a friend at the bar. The bar crowd was much older and I suppose I forgot the unspoken rule of &#34;if you&#39;re female and order yourself a drink at the bar you are allowing men to hit on you even if they&#39;re older than your father&#34;. So, that was a life lesson, I guess.

I only ordered a margarita, and it was great. However, after I ordered that first drink, I was largely ignored. Even when I flagged down the bartender for another drink and then a glass of water, I got neither. 

When my friend arrived, we finally were able to order a couple more, but were largely ignored and couldn&#39;t receive service for all of our trying.

The last time I came here was with my dad and everything was again, delicious. However it was, again, difficult to receive service.

I think the food here is too good to have a place with such poor service. I would say go for the food and give it three stars, but honestly, good luck convincing anyone in there to actually serve you any.",11/01/14,143,2,2,4,12,3.396,2.8120000000000003,0.7629999999999999,11.425,No,1294
aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Arthur M.,9rgiTp7kcoJ0cOY6uQDn4g,cS6RNzp9lEYQ_CkN-h0ujg,"Chef Kike made the sauces amazing at Frontera Grill for so many years, when I heard he opened a new restaurant in Clarendon Hills I had to make the drive from Chicago with my girlfriend.  High expectations were exceeded by the top notch restaurant Aguamiel, named after the honeywater of the agave plant (that becomes tequila and mezcal) which can be fermented into pulque.  The place is situated in the center of town among gift shops and an ice cream parlor and abundant parking.  Inside the restaurant was toasty in winter and cozy with a fireplace, hand blown glasses on the tables matched by hanging lampshades at the bar, and intriguing art including humanscale sculpture, paintings and the restaurant&#39;s insignia in metal above the fireplace.  Chef Kike&#39;s signature sauces shine at Aguamiel.  From the table salsas served with tortilla chips to the spicy brightly acidic tomato guajillo sauce cutting the rich slow cooked shortribs, the flavors were big and bold.  

The best may have been the smoky serrano chile sauce accompanying the grilled shrimp entree- deeply flavorful, complex, a hot herbacious campfire.  Ceviche was a mouthwateringly acidic starter with albacore tuna cooked in the acid of lime, the heat of chiles accented by the salt of diced olives.  Sopes featured rich shredded beef in buttery corn masa complimented by roasted tomatoes and onions.  The food was so delicious.  To drink we split a half pitcher of 1800 margarita- blanco tequila, fresh squeezed lime, limey and bright with a touch of sweetness from agave nectar, and a half pitcher of the cadillac margarita- smoother and rounder from tequila aged in oak, orange liquor lingering on the palette.  Both were excellent, as was the prompt service.  Chef Kike who worked for so many years at Frontera Grill has a place whose standards of Mexican cuisine and service deserve to be around for many years to come.  Well done and thank you, Chef.",25/01/13,226,5,1,5,-5,6.548700000000001,2.725,0.044,11.230999999999998,No,1934

This being said, Aguamiel has become a regular stop, not only for us but several of our friends as well. The food is always fantastic, service is always good so I would still give it a 4-5 stars BUT, my issue is with the bar, particularly the margaritas. Come on guys, give the customer what they order and what they pay for. Substitute the crappy bar mix instead of the &#34;fresh lemon and lime mix&#34;?  Completely fill the glass or worse yet, the pitcher with ice and skimp on the drink itself?  Now, I may not be a professional bartender but for sure, I can hold my own when it comes to margaritas and the one key ingredient in a margarita is tequila. What happened to the tequila? Especially the premium ones you are supposed to get when you order them.  On a recent visit, we had a group of 6 and ordered 3 pitchers of cadillac margaritas (yea, I know) and not one person had even the slightest buzz by the end of the night. (we could sink the Titanic with all the ice though)!  $100 in drinks?   C&#39;mon Aguamiel, you have too good a thing going to skimp on the drinks like this.

The two salsas (served with tortilla chips) were a little less spicy than I usually like, but the flavors were interesting enough to make them delicious.  The guacamole of the day had habanero in it, and at first I thought there was a mistake as it was undetectable.  As we ate, I began to notice a subtle burn, and by the end of the little bowl, my lips were lightly burning and tingling from the heat, so I think it was perfectly seasoned for a serving for two people.

I had the vegetarian chile, and the flavor was superb.  Nicely spicy and smoky, with plenty of good vegetables and cheese in the ample-sized &#34;open face&#34; chile.  My husband loved his quesadilla special that included shrimp. 

The drink specials looked good as well; we settled on the gold margaritas that were amply-sized.

Our first few visits were outstanding! As for the last 10 or so it&#39;s been on the steep incline. 

My past visits we always enjoyed the margaritas, now I am pregnant and can only drink iced tea or some sort of boring beverage. I am very thirsty being pregnant so I had 4 of them, mind you they fill the small glasses ALL the way to the top with ice so it&#39;s literally like 5 sips, I was charged $3.00 EACH! I was baffeled, how can you charge for iced tea? it&#39;s water and tea bags?  $12! UGH! Seriously Aguamiel? I would have much rather had a margarita at that price (if I could), Also the waiter brought me a lemonade instead of a iced tea and still had the nerve to charge me for it. 

The waiter was also annoyed that I had him ask if their cheese was pasteurized. He was annoyed by this, this isn&#39;t the first time I had this waiter and he is very rude and was caring more about the large party that was also his table so we had to wait, I literally had to wait to get another iced tea for 20 minutes, then another 15 minutes for the sour cream I asked for 3 times.

Also I asked to wrap my leftovers and give me more flour tortillas as he gave my husband corn on accident, then on the bill we were also charged for those tortillas we didn&#39;t even want, not to mention sour cream 

It&#39;s not like you give us credit for the items we don&#39;t want on our bill so don&#39;t nickel and dime us for everything dinner shouldn&#39;t cost $85 without alcohol for 2 people. 

Disappointed, I don&#39;t know if we will be back. The customer service needs to be stepped up if you want repeating customers, you&#39;d actually have more customers if you properly take care of them.

The staff was very attentive, but not in-your-face. 
The chips and salsa are always my favorite part of eating at a Mexican restaurany- but the salsa here was AMAZING!  I was enjoying the red salsa so much, but when I tried the green salsa I fell in love.
The sangrias were pretty darn good, too.  That was the ONLY thing I was looking for that night, and Aguamiel delivered.
Hubby ordered the pork belly with a mole sauce and mashed sweet potatoes.  on the waiter&#39;s recommendation.  He&#39;d never had pork belly before, but is adventurous so he gave it a try...and liked them alot.
I had the wood- grilled salmon in a peanut mole sauce with garlic spinach and mashed potatoes.
The potatoes didn&#39;t have a ton of taste, but the salmon was very good and the sauce was unique.  They blend alot of different  flavors to create unique dishes...which I find so fun!

This place is LOUD!!  Between the poor acoustics, and the numerous people who had one too many, you had to yell for the person next to you to hear, it was also difficult for the waiter to hear our order.

The food is much more authentic than most of the other Mexican restaurants around here, with unique items.  They have a number of different moles that are very good.

The staff could use some work, the front of the house was weak, and the waiter didn&#39;t get our order exactly right, perhaps he didn&#39;t hear us right with all the noise.  Also they were not quick to correct the wrong order, by the time they did we were already on our way out.

I loved the carne asada. It had a few spots that were a bit fattier than I like but most steaks do.  The highlight of my dish was the plantains! They were sauteed in maybe honey? Brown sugar? They had a perfect crisp glaze and then a drizzle of their fresh crema and a sprinkling of queso fresco? Goat cheese? Whatever it was, they were divine!

Certainly a welcome addition to the area. The prices are really good considering the neighborhood. Then there are the margaritas! By far one of the best I&#39;ve had outside of Mexico. Splurge and get the Cadillac, you won&#39;t be disappointed, great fresh flavor and no sickeningly sweet triple sec. Also take the server recommendations, they were spot on. The fish tacos are amazing for so few ingredients and the carnitas are melt in your mouth. My friend had the stuffed peppers and loved the combination of fillings. The tortillas are handmade, soft and delicious. 

The service is working out the kinks of being new, but no issues that can&#39;t be overcome with time. The servers I have had have all been very informative on the menu. My biggest pet peeve in restaurants is patrons asking the busboy for things out of his scope of work. FYI a busboy can&#39;t order food for you or get you another drink, other than water. There are certainly places that have ultra experienced busboys that will go tell the server what is needed but this guy can just do the basics which is fine, he is still doing his job and doing it well. I had people next to us complaining that he was &#34;incompetent and didn&#39;t even speak English.&#34; Get a clue folks and stop being so ignorant. 

They are very kid friendly which I would normally not be thrilled about, but since having a two year old nephew that has been dining out since 3 months, I appreciate a place we can all go. Btw, he loved the guacamole. I guess he&#39;s not really your typical 2 year old. The management knows how to seat a dining room because everyone cringes when they see the kid in the high chair. They put us up front by the windows and sat other patrons in another section. Granted this was very early on a Sunday night so they had the luxury of an empty restaurant to begin with. They also have plastic cups with straws for water that are given to all kids.

We arrived at 8pm on a Friday and were told it would be a 30 minute wait for 3, but we waited only half of that before being seated.  The bar was packed so we had to awkwardly plaster ourselves against the half-wall that separates the bar from the busy pathway to the kitchen.  Be smarter than we were and make a reservation!

I liked the look of the dining area, but it&#39;s so LOUD.  Not a good place for a first date or catching up with an old friend. 

The service - our waiter was perfectly nice and got our orders right, so yay for that.  However, food runners tried to deliver other tables&#39; food and drinks to us three times throughout the night, and our own waiter couldn&#39;t remember who ordered what when our entrees came.  Little details, but that&#39;s the stuff that would set this place apart from the competition, if they could get the details right.

I had a regular margarita - fine, not awesome, I&#39;m sure if I had upgraded my tequila it would have been better.  

The food is where this place shines.  I started with the ensalada fresca - jicama, cucumbers, and pineapple, with a little kick of chile powder.  Not only does it look amazing (and had diners at other tables asking me what I ordered) but it tastes fantastic - refreshing and fun.  My mom started with a special appetizer - tamales - which were very good (though were a little heavy on the masa/light on the meat for us), and my dad had the sopa classica, which was outstanding. 

For entrees, I had the camarones ala diabla (shrimp in some spicy sauce, with rice and zucchini).  They weren&#39;t kidding around with the spice here - very good, but not for the faint of heart - or rather, stomach.  If you typically order things medium or mild, this would probably not be a good choice for you, but if you&#39;re like me and love some heat, have at it.

My mom had the quesadilla with chicken and said it was wonderful (and she knows her quesadillas - that&#39;s her standard order when we go Mexican), and my dad went with a taco trio - al pastor (too sweet for him, I tried it &amp; thought it was good), carne asada (great), and pollo (his favorite).

I&#39;m surprised at how affordable everything was - parents&#39; entrees were under $10, mine was almost $20 (darn shrimp), apps were all under $10.

Since we just ate at CiNe, we were looking forward to dining at the neighborhood&#39;s other new Mexican restaurant. Like CiNe, this is is not the normal suburban burrito and fajita experience. The menu looked appetizing as there were numerous selections that looked muy bueno. Most dishes were less than $15. Started off with chips and salsas, green and red.  Chips were overly salty and they masked the taste of the salsas. The red salsa could have been a bit spicier. For dinner, I had the chicken enchiladas with a dark mole sauce.  They were good, but were not hot enough. And the rice and refried sides were luke warm as well. My wife ordered the chicken tostada which she also enjoyed.  Children&#39;s menu available for $6. Service could have been better.  Maybe they just need more help. Besides one dish not being prepared as we requested, a second basket of chips never arrived and the waiter never asked whether we wanted dessert, just dropped off the check.  Plus, one dish was also never cleared from the table. Management was very friendly and checked on us a few times.  Beware, the dining room is inordinately loud. Or maybe I just need a hearing aid, which my wife would agree with!

Compared to CiNe, the portions at Aguamiel are more authentic, larger and at a lower cost.  Quality is similar.  The atmosphere at CiNe is more to my liking and is not as loud. Plus, CiNe&#39;s chips and salsa were superior--I love my chips!

aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Kristina B.,6PDZZVsXb6Eigxnam_s0wg,BORNgLqpJYltQ5EjDw_BDg,"Came here last night with my dad and sister to celebrate my dad&#39;s birthday. We had heard good things from a few people, so I was really excited to try it out!

My dad had a really great margarita that was like a combination of a pina colada and a marg. If i didn&#39;t consume a 47 ounce margarita somewhere else the night before, I would have drank 5 of these :) One of the most delicious flavored margaritas I&#39;ve ever had!

We started with guacamole which was outstanding. Good texture, nice flavor without being too spicy. You can tell it was super fresh. I loved how the chips were thick enough to hold up the guacamole! My dad ordered the tortilla soup and really enjoyed it.

We each had the 3 taco platter. I chose 1 al pastor, and 2 carne asada. The Al Pastor sounded really interesting, with adobo flavoring and topped with bacon and pineapple. The smokiness of the adobo was almost a little too much for me, but the bright pineapple flavor cut through and the bacon was a nice addition. I was super excited for my steak tacos, which were supposed to be marinated skirt steak with grilled onions. Imagine my disappointment when they arrived with chopped, raw onion, and loaded with some cilantro type of sauce. They were good, but I really don&#39;t like raw onions and a lot of cilantro, so they weren&#39;t as enjoyable as I was expecting. My sister had the same as me and was disappointed by the same aspects. I only ate one taco and two bites of another.

My dad decided to get dessert - a mexican bread pudding and some mexican coffee. You&#39;d think the coffee would come pretty quickly, yes? No. almost 10 minutes pass, and someone drops off our check - without the coffee or dessert on there. Why? I don&#39;t know. It took a few minutes to flag someone down to tell them what was going on, then he took the check away and said he&#39;d be back - we weren&#39;t really quite sure if we were still going to get the items my dad had ordered or not, but then the coffee arrived. I tried a sip and it was outstanding! So many bold, delicious flavors, I would honestly come back here just to have a cup of coffee. About 10 minutes later, the bread pudding shows up. Our server explains that he dropped the first one and the chef had to make another, which is why it took so long. Well, the bread pudding was delicious too, and was served with what I think might have been pistachio ice cream. Creamy, crispy, and warm, this was a lovely dessert.

It took a while to get an updated check, then to have someone come get the credit card, then to have them come back with it. I don&#39;t think that guacamole, tacos, and bread pudding warranted an hour and 45 minute long dining experience, but maybe I&#39;m just antsy. 

I would probably try this place out again, but make sure that my tacos come with what they&#39;re supposed to. And hopefully there is a better waitstaff around too, the  service was pretty spotty.",22/04/13,330,3,3,5,72,11.214999999999998,6.668,1.708,26.624,No,2936

Delicious echoes of Frontera Grill from the Rick Bayless acolyte, Chef Kike.  Terrific salsas, moles, guacamole, tacos, margaritas, and several terrific platos fuertes (entrees).  Loved, loved, loved the place.  We made sure we were there at least a couple times a month.

Unfortunately, our last couple of visits have been somewhat disappointing.  Portions have shrunk considerably, and several of the dishes seem to have lost their kick.  Has Chef Kike turned the kitchen over to a much less capable sous chef?  I&#39;m not sure what, exactly, is going on, but if this trend continues, I&#39;m afraid we will be writing this place off -- which would be really sad given how much I loved this place.",28/09/13,104,3,1,3,10,2.5623000000000005,2.6239999999999997,0.683,6.693,No,796
aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Judd K.,j5Kx1W2EXWpXc1viLrxUxA,NqQkkjeoYDtOwZtOVSB_KQ,"Aguamiel is excellent and getting better each time I visit.  The tacos are so good that I haven&#39;t ventured too much farther on the menu during my four visits.  The bar has an excellent selection of tequila and an adequate selection of most other beverages.  The gold margarita is excellent.  I have been waiting to write this review until after trying Cine.  Last night was my first experience there, and now I must wonder what kind of herbs those who prefer Cine to this place are smoking.  Cine is more trendy and highly designed inside, but both spaces are attractive.  Cine has a slightly better bar selection.  Service seems about equal at both places, though both are relatively new and I&#39;ve seen staff missteps at both places.  At the end of everything, the determining factor for a restaurant must be the food, and in my opinion Aguamiel has *much* better food at a slightly cheaper price compared to Cine.  Aquamiel boasts a wide selection of amazing tacos, all of which can be mixed and matched.  The carnitas and pork belly are to die for, and the fried fish taco is the best of that genre I have ever tried.  I will be back.  Drive on in to downtown Clarendon Hills for the tacos here.  You will not be disappointed.",05/01/13,130,4,2,5,15,5.047199999999999,2.8560000000000003,0.134,12.009999999999998,No,1236
aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Marty A.,GO5sdZaWY9esGX_F7Ute2g,_ealElzDeHTo3W32p4f53A,"The place looked very promising when we walked in at 8 on a Saturday night with reservations. The menu looked interesting and a step beyond the normal suburban Mexican restaurant.  Six of us arrived early but were seated within five minutes of our reservation time.  The interior is trendy -  I thought I could be in a  small restaurant in River North. The place was packed. 

To start off, the obligatory chips seemed to be the same ones we get at Costco. First batch was served cold, the second batch was warm. The two salsas were good.  

I ordered the Al Pastor Tacos. I really enjoyed them. The taste of pineapple contrasted well with the meat, but the tacos were supposed to have &#34;crisp bacon&#34; but I could not taste nor see any bacon. This was one of the reasons I ordered these tacos.  The beans and rice were barely lukewarm. My wife had a mix of tacos. Two were good, the fish taco was rather poor - think &#34;fish sticks&#34;. Other meals were actually pretty good.

The service was inexcusable. We go out for fine dining at least once a month and this the worse service we have had in many years. The waiter was was pleasant enough and seemed knowledgeable about the menu , but was very absent minded and non-attentive. We ordered guacamole. It never came. I ordered  a drink, that did not come until I was well in to my meal, and the was after prompting the waiter. Many of the drinks were filled to the rim - which on one hand is nice. But my wife&#39;s drink spilled some and she cleaned up with the napkin - the waiter did not offer any assistance. We asked for a napkin. It never came - we grabbed one from another table. We went through the water and asked for another carafe. It never arrived.  Also, at a place like this I do not expect the meals to be auctioned when they are brought to the tables. So the last one is a bit petty but this there seemed to be  a trend.

Prices were very reasonable. The main dishes ran from $12 to upper 20&#39;s as I recall.
.
This place is also really loud - think Pappadeux and multiple times 2.  How about some fabrics to deafen the sound? 

I really wanted to like this restaurant. I suspect if I came back and had an experienced server this would be a 4-5 star review.

My go-to Mexican in the CH area is still Taco Grill on Ogden a couple blocks west of Cass. Just a small lunch joint (though open for early dinner, too.)  A lot less fancy than Aguamiel, which is a very attractive  dining room with a very well-stocked and ornate bar, but I think TG food is much more flavorful.

We shared a 1/2 pitcher of house margarita which was fantastic. I didn&#39;t think it was too sweet or sour. We also had one of the top shelf margaritas last time which was the best, but knocked us on our a$$! :) 

I had the chicken mole based on the reviews-  it was delicious. It wasn&#39;t what I was expecting at all, but so good I nearly licked the plate clean.

The service was good and the food arrived in a timely manner. I&#39;m a vegetarian so I was pleased to have a lot of options. They were accommodating with my restrictions. I order the tacos with mushrooms, onions, cheese, and peppers. Tasty but not greasy.

My husband, on the other hand, will eat anything. I think he got a pork or chicken mole which he liked.

My only negatives were:

The guacamole was bland. It needed more kick but that&#39;s a personal preference which is a simple fix.

Also, we weren&#39;t happy with our desserts. We ordered the churros which were served in a cold chocolate sauce and a bread pudding that was served cold.

I also agree with other posts about the chips and salsa. That was an unexpected surprise.

All in all we were happy with the experience!",04/11/12,89,4,2,4,25,3.3511,2.236,0.333,12.431,No,863

aguamiel-clarendon-hills,JoAnn P.,PqAIEqiqoxpZYJfPW-HyvA,dt6AO6sQ6tkgJd0zTn7NDQ,"Let me start by saying that my husband and I went on what I believe may have been their 1st Friday night.  So presumably, there are some bugs to be worked out.  

It was very crowded and the layout of the bar made it difficult to find a place to wait where we weren&#39;t in the way of the waitstaff in the back or standing in the open doorway.  The bar staff (of 1) seemed completely overwhelmed.  Luckily another set of hands hopped in to help out, but while that helped the speed of service, we didn&#39;t get the margarit&#39;s we actually ordered, but instead got the standard house version. They were ok, but we are not fans of the sour-mix margarita, so we did not get off to a good start.

We did get seated in the time estimated, which was a pleasant surprise. And the chips and salsa arrived promptly.  The chips were clearly homemade and very fresh and the salsa was good as well.

They clearly were open a little too soon, as the menus were paper copies and we informed that the bar could not actually make our 1st 2 drink choices.  We then went back to ordering a fairly standard margarita, though with premium tequila and lime juice v sourmix and these were very good.

The highlight of the night was however, the food.  We were excited that the exec chef had experience at Frontera/Topolobampo and that was evident from the food.  I had the pork tenderloin which was tender and flavorful.  My husband went with the chicken mole and was more than pleased.  It was nice to be in a Mexican restaurant that didn&#39;t have a standard Pepe&#39;s/Uncle Julio&#39;s-style menu.

We did order another round of margaritas, which never arrived (luckily we didn&#39;t get charged for them either, though we did see the drinks they couldn&#39;t make appear on the bill).  We noticed and experienced a rather long wait time to take our order, come back to ask about dessert, deliver our bill, and refill our water glasses (which never happened).

So, there are obviously some servie issues which need to be worked out, but the quality of the food and reasonableness of the prices should definitely make you want to give it a try.  We will be returning in a few weeks to see if they&#39;ve gotten the kinks worked out.  The food is well worth it.

My wife ordered guacamole and chips which is NOT worth the price, as the portion size is small even by kids standards.  Apparently a LOT of people have complained about this to the manager, but nothing has changed.  They should listen to their customers or we can easily find other options, especially in this area.  I ordered 3 tacos, all different and all very good, though the shrimp was a bit spicy.  My wife did the same.  Kids ordered the tortilla classica soup and loved it, then had tacos and chicken strips as entrees.  Chicken strips are not what you think, but actually much better than the breaded chicken pieces you normally see on a kids menu....this is a pounded thin chicken breast that is very lightly breaded and cooked.  My son ate all of it.  We did not get dessert, and bill was very reasonable.  The place was very crowded but Tara at the hostess station was very friendly and sat us right away.

Fluffy homemade biscuits, rich sausage gravy and a perfectly cooked, crispy fried boneless chicken breast with two eggs over easy. Decadent, huge portion, not too salty/greasy, just perfect. My mom got an omelette with a morning glory square on the side which was an interesting menu item, kind of carrot-cake-y but with a banana bread texture. Really good!

Today I ventured in around lunch time so opted for a burger. Went with the California Burger complete with avocado, mixed greens and provolone cheese, to which I added garlic aioli and crispy bacon. The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and came with some house made fries that were crunchy and tasty. Throw in an iced tea and that&#39;s a pretty damn good lunch.

But the best part was Penny and her hospitality. She knew my name and came and sat down again to visit. And then she let me taste test a new item she&#39;s working on that includes waffles, house made chorizo, an egg and chipotle creme and salsa verde. It was pretty tasty and definitely unique. Can&#39;t wait to see it on the menu.

Upon walking in, we immediately notice this restaurant is busy. There were only a handful of open tables, but we were quickly greeted and seated. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is extremely friendly. The specials are listed on a large board at the back of the restaurant and I quickly noticed many of their dishes have a Southwestern flair, containing ingredients such as chorizo or accompanied by salsa. They have traditional American breakfast dishes as well, but I chose to go outside of the box and order the Carintas Waffles:Topped with slow cooked, perfectly seasoned pulled pork, chipotle crema, salsa verde, cojita cheese, and fresh cilantro. There is no need for syrup. At first glance, this sounds pretty weird, but I really, really enjoyed this dish! It comes with a heaping ton of carnitas and the chipotle crema and salsa verde is the perfect accompaniment to the fresh, warm waffle. I would recommend trying this creative dish if you&#39;re looking for something different!

Can we talk homemade jams?  Or is it jelly?  What&#39;s the difference again?  What ever the smashed-fruit goodness that you put on toast for breakfast dessert is called...that in itself if almost worth the trip.

We had Tracey as our waitress and she was very sweet and attentive. I ordered the biscuit and gravy breakfast that included hash browns and got cheese/onion added + a side of egg whites. The hash browns were perfectly cooked just the way I liked them (without me even asking), the eggs whites were beautifully scrambled with a light butter taste and were sooo fluffy, and the biscuits and gravy were out of this world. I could eat this breakfast 3 more times this week! The portions are perfect and the price is spot on. 

This place offers a vast array of different items on their menu. For those pumpkin lovers, they have everything pumpkin for you. Their flavors seem to change daily (or maybe weekly, not sure) for things like coffee cake, which is great. My friend had coffee cake and it looks great and was a HUGE piece!

The food here is your typical breakfast fare.  I was expecting something a bit more unique for some reason. I ordered their pancakes which I normally do at a new breakfast restaurant. Also a 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy just to do a little taste test and a side of sausage patties.

When it came time to serve our meal the staff seemed a bit unorganized as they handed out my order to three different people and forgot parts of others.  As I gathered my meal with a chuckle I tended to my pancakes which were large and fluffy looking but unfortunately they were rather dry and crumbly once I dug into them.  The breakfast sausage patties were thin and unremarkable. The biscuits and gravy was fairly weak on flavor and thin on sausage. 

My wife&#39;s waffle came with a huge glob of butter in the middle. Most restaurants usually only serve their waffles with powdered sugar.  My wife hates the taste of butter so this put a damper on her meal immediately.

We were not pleased with our meal and won&#39;t be back.  We went about 9:30ish in the morning, it was not busy, a few open tables and more open booths.

There seemed to be confusion when we walked in the door, another couple was behind us and they were trying seat us together. We got seated with just our party and a waitress asked about drinks.  We only had one coffee cup on the table so my husband got his cup of coffee right away, I asked for decaf and a milk for my LO. Another waitress came up and again asked us what we wanted to drink, had to ask for drinks again.  I was looking at the menu to see if there was a kids menu, the guy who seated us didn&#39;t give us one, one of the waitresses brought us the kids menu with crayons.  

Food - considering the place was not super busy, it took longer than expected to get our food.  I had ordered the two eggs (scrambled) with meat (bacon).  My meal was supposed to come with either hash browns or fruit, the waitress didn&#39;t ask which one I wanted when I ordered, the default is usually hash browns, but neither were on my plate when it was served, we had to ask for it, I got a nice side of fresh fruit.  I asked for pancakes, instead of toast.  I thought it was weird there was a $1 up charge for basic pancakes.  We go out to breakfast and have tried multiple breakfast joints in Naperville and never seen an up charge for basic pancakes.  Overall, my meal was just ok.  My scrambled eggs were a little over done and the bacon was just ok.

I ordered the one egg kids meal for my LO, it came with an egg, meat and starch (toast or pancake).  The meal was sufficient for my LO but when we got the bill, it showed an up charge of $2 for bacon.  The bill was corrected but I am glad I checked everything.

Hubby ordered a make your own skillet and upgraded his toast with the blueberry coffee cake.  He liked the coffee cake but didn&#39;t care for the skillet, and it wasn&#39;t the ingredients he added.

Overall, food was just mediocre.

the-lucky-penny-diner-and-deli-naperville-2,Eva S.,U99ctrpa3CJ9IB6efd2Zjw,kJn7ydHew3nqX6c5teYWNw,"This morning I visited Lucky Penny for the first time. I&#39;ve lived near this location for years and have seen a few restaurants come and go. If my first experience is any indication, I think Lucky Penny is going to be my favorite cafe that&#39;s been in this spot.

The owner, Penny, served my breakfast, kept my coffee fresh, and chatted with me. Her passion for her work was apparent from the start; I felt very welcome, and I could tell she was excited and proud of her food. It&#39;s always so cool to see someone passionate about what they do. I still miss my dearly departed Wicked Good CafÌ©, and this was the first time since then that I&#39;ve found a place that&#39;s as warm and friendly as they were.

I had eggs benedict, hash browns, and coffee. The serving size is generous - I need to keep that in mind and order light when I go in so early in the morning. When I get restaurant hash browns, I honestly don&#39;t expect much, but these were carefully seasoned; the salt-and-pepper blend made them special. The eggs benedict had strips of ham instead those fried discs that many restaurants use, so they were cooked evenly and were tastier. I think there was some paprika in the sauce; it was yummy.

The coffee was a standout. I take two creams and half a sugar in my coffee, so when Penny refilled it partway through my first cup, I thought I would need to add more of both. Instead, it was so smooth and mild that I put away 2 or 2 1/2 cups without having to add any more flavoring. Very impressed with the coffee.

It always feels so satisfying to support a local business, and I&#39;m so pleased to have a high-quality one right near my house. Highly recommended.",27/04/16,192,5,3,5,73,7.2536,3.8770000000000002,0.132,13.991000000000003,No,1686

They were really on top of the coffee refills and other drinks, so much that I was a little confused about who our waitress actually was. Given the abundance of staff, the service was a little too slow for my likes. I had an omelette with very fresh ingredients, delicious. The chocolate chip pancakes were over portioned (3 full plate-sized). My daughter thought the music was ahead of it&#39;s time with the geriatric crowd. All in all a very mixed experience. I will probably try it again, lunch next time.",14/04/16,62,3,1,2,-1,1.6606999999999998,0.9790000000000001,0.077,6.944,No,590

Highly recommend the Carnitas Waffle, very delicious. The place is a little hard to spot from the street which I think leads to it not being as busy as it should be with such great food. Please go and visit!",09/05/16,32,5,1,3,10,2.9914,2.055,0.037,2.909,No,293
