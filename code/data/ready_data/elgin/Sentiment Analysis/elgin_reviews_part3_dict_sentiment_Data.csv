When I got home, I was sorely disappointed to find that not only was there NOT extra sauce, it was even less than you would normally expect.
I called over to speak with the manager who never apologized. He said the amount of sauce was relative which is bonkers considering my wings were bone dry.  He offered to make another batch for me but this was completely inconvenient for me as I had plans for the rest of the evening.  An offer for a future discount, a coupon, even a simple apology would have sufficed..

Took at least 20 min just to get some drinks and when the drinks came they weren&#39;t what we ordered. When reanne asked if we were ready to order we replied yes after taking our order she replied with there is a long wait for food over 25 minutes minimum. After taking our order she never returned to ask if we needed anything else. About 30 minutes later she returned with the food dropped it off and and about 10 minutes later she came with the checks saying &#34;take your time no rush.&#34; 5 minutes after that while still eating she asks if we had the payment ready. Seemed pretty rushed to me.

We sat our table for twenty minutes no one came to ask if we&#39;d like drinks, after we got our drinks Reanne kept telling us that it would be a long wait for food. Which was fine we told her that was ok. We didn&#39;t get our food for maybe 25 minutes which was ok. During that entire 25 minutes she did not stop by once to ask if we would like refills. After we got our food she disappeared and did not come back at all for another 20 minutes and then just to give us our checks. Then she came back five minutes later asking if we&#39;re ready for the bill. At the point we were still not done eating and hadn&#39;t gotten our refills.

Came last night at 7 PM on a boneless Thursday night, which I realize means the place is busier than usual, but what happened to my group is just unacceptable. We were seated and ordered our drinks immediately, and about 5 minutes later placed our orders, so far, so good. Then an hour later, our food still hasn&#39;t come. It is now approximately 8 PM. Our waitress did not come check on us or update us at all during that hour. Finally someone who was not our waitress delivered our wings to us by basically throwing them on the table, and then quickly turns around and walks off. At this point we are starving, and look at our table and realize... We have no napkins and no silverware. So we hope that our waitress will come by soon so we can ask for some. She walked by our table several times and we were unsuccessful in waving her down. We also tried to get the attention of other servers, who looked is DIRECTLY in the eye, and then did not stop and ask what we needed. I also did not see a manager during this time, if I had I would have attempted to get their attention. So finally, FIFTEEN minutes later, we get the attention of our waitress who brings us silverware a few minutes later. By now our food is cold, but whatever, we were starving. Halfway through eating our waitress does check on us, and she says she will bring us more water. That never happened. We finish and ask for boxes and our checks. Checks come, we pay, but no boxes. We wait another 20 minutes before we are able to flag someone down to get us boxes. Food was good, service was awful.",24/06/16,181,1,1,-2,-11,-2.0551,0.72,2.051,17.229,No,1618

buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Robby W.,QC_g-og4viJ9gjK2pjJteg,f6MgDkKHo9QD4N6_5kkAXw,"I have been to &#34;B-dubs&#34; locations across the country and I always have a fairly pleasant experience. I know some people like to player hate on chains, but I honestly have never quite understood that whole mentality. Does the fact that a restaurant is a chain somehow diminish it by default? Perhaps in the alternate universe some wanna be hipster operates under it does, but to those of us who objectively embrace reality, food and experience is the same no matter if it&#39;s a Mom and Pop joint or if they are rocking 1000 units coast to coast. Ok, stepping off the soap box. 

If you have been to any other &#34;B-dubs&#34; location (and unless you have been living under a rock the last decade, chances are you have), you will find many aspects instantly familiar. They have wall-to-wall flat screens that put most sports bars to shame. BWW is very popular with fantasy football followers for this very reason alone. There are not too many places where you can swivel 360 degrees in your chair and get every single live NFL game on Sunday afternoon. I have yet to enter a location that did not have NFL Sunday Ticket, and this location is no exception.  The last couple of years my fantasy football league draft was conducted from the bar stool of a BWW location. Another staple is UFC events, and all the PPW events are on tap here as well. This is actually quite handy if I am traveling. If there is a fight on I want to watch while I am on the road, I know that I can visit the closest location and get my fix. Even some po-dunk towns in the middle of nowhere have  BWW&#39;s these days. 

As to the food, wings are what you should go with here (surprise, surprise). They are always plump and succulent and are about the best you will find at any chain. They have sauce selections for days to accommodate just about any preference with &#39;Blazin&#39; being the hottest. I adore insanely hot food and it is a sauce that is pretty nuclear for a mass produced product. A BWW district manager once told me the sauce is in the 200,000-350,000 Scoville units of heat range. By contrast, Tabasco sauce is between 2500-5000. So, yeah....It is friggin HOT!  If I am not in the mood for wings, I also like the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich which has been on the menu at every location I have ever visited. You can also go bone out on wings and eat them with a fork if you are not wanting to get messy. BWW locations also will serve regional specialty items by location. For example, the location closest to me back in Wisconsin had deep fried cheese curds. 

Lastly, this is a good spot to grab a drink since the 20oz beers are reasonably priced.  This location has decent selection on tap with some local microbrews thrown into the mix to round things out. 

Overall, this location is a good option. Prices are cheap, the service is good, and they have all the &#34;man cave&#34; type of accompaniments that are typical of the chain.",23/06/15,321,4,2,4,44,3.7372999999999994,2.536,0.843,25.619999999999997,No,2942

buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Robby W.,QC_g-og4viJ9gjK2pjJteg,f6MgDkKHo9QD4N6_5kkAXw,"I have been to &#34;B-dubs&#34; locations across the country and I always have a fairly pleasant experience. I know some people like to player hate on chains, but I honestly have never quite understood that whole mentality. Does the fact that a restaurant is a chain somehow diminish it by default? Perhaps in the alternate universe some wanna be hipster operates under it does, but to those of us who objectively embrace reality, food and experience is the same no matter if it&#39;s a Mom and Pop joint or if they are rocking 1000 units coast to coast. Ok, stepping off the soap box. 

If you have been to any other &#34;B-dubs&#34; location (and unless you have been living under a rock the last decade, chances are you have), you will find many aspects instantly familiar. They have wall-to-wall flat screens that put most sports bars to shame. BWW is very popular with fantasy football followers for this very reason alone. There are not too many places where you can swivel 360 degrees in your chair and get every single live NFL game on Sunday afternoon. I have yet to enter a location that did not have NFL Sunday Ticket, and this location is no exception.  The last couple of years my fantasy football league draft was conducted from the bar stool of a BWW location. Another staple is UFC events, and all the PPW events are on tap here as well. This is actually quite handy if I am traveling. If there is a fight on I want to watch while I am on the road, I know that I can visit the closest location and get my fix. Even some po-dunk towns in the middle of nowhere have  BWW&#39;s these days. 

As to the food, wings are what you should go with here (surprise, surprise). They are always plump and succulent and are about the best you will find at any chain. They have sauce selections for days to accommodate just about any preference with &#39;Blazin&#39; being the hottest. I adore insanely hot food and it is a sauce that is pretty nuclear for a mass produced product. A BWW district manager once told me the sauce is in the 200,000-350,000 Scoville units of heat range. By contrast, Tabasco sauce is between 2500-5000. So, yeah....It is friggin HOT!  If I am not in the mood for wings, I also like the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich which has been on the menu at every location I have ever visited. You can also go bone out on wings and eat them with a fork if you are not wanting to get messy. BWW locations also will serve regional specialty items by location. For example, the location closest to me back in Wisconsin had deep fried cheese curds. 

Lastly, this is a good spot to grab a drink since the 20oz beers are reasonably priced.  This location has decent selection on tap with some local microbrews thrown into the mix to round things out. 

Overall, this location is a good option. Prices are cheap, the service is good, and they have all the &#34;man cave&#34; type of accompaniments that are typical of the chain.",23/06/15,321,4,2,4,44,3.7372999999999994,2.536,0.843,25.619999999999997,No,2942

Unfortunately the traditional wings were slightly dry and overcooked, and the food came out very slow. Especially for 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon, which is just after the Saturday lunch rush.

I had the traditional wings. Half were covered with a limited edition, Salted Caramel sauce (which is just honey BBQ with a touch of caramel, and kosher salt) while the other half was covered in Caribbean Jerk sauce, which I knew I would like quite a bit.

I&#39;m glad, for one, they&#39;re experimenting with different kinds of sauce. The salted caramel was complex enough, and not too sweet (though my wife said it was too sweet for her tastes.)

The drumsticks were cooked well enough but the wings were a bit overcooked and stringy. We also grabbed the soft pretzels, which were good.

In addition, the food came out pretty slow (15-20 minutes), with no explanations from the wait staff. I also mysteriously got a drink refill I didn&#39;t ask for. :-p

buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Sharon G.,ewgfC5JX0tSKtHN66SGqiQ,#NAME?,"If I could give this place no stars, I would.  First we waited 15 min and no one even approached us as a server, bus person.  I finally asked a girl bussing tables who was our server.  Turns out the server didn&#39;t know we were his table, which was smack in the middle of the dining room.  I was with my two 8-yr-old children and we had just come back from a dr&#39;s appointment after a diagnosis for my daughter.  I thought it would be a nice treat.  Think not.  I ordered a prem. margarita, which was 99 % ice.  I called the server over to show him and he sent the manager over.  She said everything is premeasured, that&#39;s the margarita glass, so the rest has to be filled with ice.  I expressed my dissatisfaction and she asked if I&#39;d care for another with not so much ice,  I said fine.  We were served our dinner, two kids meals and I had the Med. salad. I&#39;ve been to Buffalo Wild Wings in Naperville and in Lombard, and the serving sizes were much smaller at this Bloomingdale location.  I asked for a carry-out box for my salad and the check.
In the meantime I was brought another margarita with less ice, of which I finished 1/2, and the check.  I come to find out they had charged me for the 2nd margarita I had sent back.  I spoke again to the manager and she said, oh, no, if you drink it, you have to pay for it.  I said there was hardly anything to drink and I thought you were bringing me another one with less ice.  I asked to speak to her manager.  He proceeded to tell me that &#34;by law&#34; they have to charge me for alcohol &#34;if I drank it.&#34;  I said I will pay for one, but not the other.  This was $10 we were arguing over.  The bill was 42 something and I handed him $40.  He asked me if I had paid my bill.  I told him I will give him $40 and nothing more.  He proceeded to tell me that he would call the police on me for not paying my bill.  I told him I am 59 yrs old with 2 adopted children who&#39;s worked in the court system  as a stenographer for over 30 yrs.  I handed him the remaining $2.42 cents and left.  I have never been so insulted in my 59 years on this earth.  Where has common sense gone?  Where has respect for the customer gone?  The place was dirty, the customer service horrible and the portions significantly less than other Buffalo Wild Wings.  

So Customer Beware.  Buffalo Wild Wings are independently owned and operated.  I would  think again before supporting the Bloomingdale location.

My husband and I ordered lots of wings on New Years eve with the Hot BBQ sauce, which is really hot for me, and ranch. I called early and made sure to double check that we would receive ranch with the wings. The woman on the phone assured me a few times that it would be in the bag. It ended up taking us almost a half hour to get to this BWW. My husband ran in and grabbed the bag and we headed home. When we sat down at our dinner table I realized that they had neglected to put even one cup of ranch into our bag. I was not about to waste another hour of my night to drive back for the ranch that the servers forgot to place in the bag, so I called BWW to see if they could give me a free credit of some ranches for my next visit.

I had to cycle through at least 3 girls who basically told me &#34;it&#39;s JUST ranch.&#34; and whined about how busy they are. When I&#39;m spending a decent amount of money on hot spicy wings, it&#39;s more than JUST ranch, and BWW is ALWAYS busy. They should have bags filled with silverware and ranch ready to go if they can&#39;t remember these items. I finally got a manager on the phone who I regretfully forgot to ask for his name, but was so flustered from the last 3 girls that I had to explain my situation to. I just wanted them to take my name so next time I wouldn&#39;t have to pay for ranch that I was shorted on this visit. The manager took my full name and address and told me he would send me a coupon for some free wings to compensate for my time and apologized. I told him I wasn&#39;t looking for free wings, but very much appreciated getting taken care of. 

It&#39;s been over a month and NO coupon or any mail has arrived at my house from BWW. I understand that it&#39;s JUST ranch, but service for customer&#39;s should be handled MUCH better than this.

(I know there&#39;s one day for boneless and one day for traditional but didn&#39;t know what was what). 

To figure this ish out I called them to ask..you know, why not?
Well, the girl on the phone was completely rude. I asked if there was a wing special today where they had 50 cent wings and she abruptly responded being all, &#34;Actually it&#39;s 60 cent wings&#34; WELL THEN! Take my dime, whatever.

After I hang up the phone with miss rude pants I had another question or two. I was wondering if the same deal applied to take out because some restaurants are weird like that. &#34;Oh you can have a discount on our food but only if you sit down&#34; Stupid. 

Well, I called to ask and she was rude yet again and responded like &#34;duh...&#34; but didn&#39;t actually say duh...you know what I mean.

After I hang up the phone with miss rude pants I had another question or two. I was wondering if the same deal applied to take out because some restaurants are weird like that. &#34;Oh you can have a discount on our food but only if you sit down&#34; Stupid.

I love buffalo wild wings dont get me wrong but this location is by far the worst bdubs yet.  I have given this place way too many chances and it has been the same horrible service EVERY TIME.  (on days when there are games playing.. dont even THINK about maybe coming here, EVEN WORSE) 

Here is my list of REPETITIVE issues with this location:

-LONG LONG LONG wait.. I&#39;m talking a good 40 minutes and there is very little seating.. so have fun standing.. and when there is a game on.. the wait is more like 2 hours, no joke.

-The employees lie to you saying it will be about 15-20 minutes.. ya 20 minutes my ass. 

-EXTREMELY slow service, just to get your waiter to your table is another 30 minutes of waiting

-when you FINALLY get your food (after about an hour and a half of waiting since you got there) its cold.

- when you finally get your cold food that you have been waiting hours for, they mess up your order, or they tell you the rest of it will come out later, which is awesome because I love eating a whole basket of wings and then 30 minutes later being able to eat my fries separately, NOT.

Service:
Service is attentive on most nights. Quality of service ranges from okay to good. I&#39;ve been here a few time to know that service won&#39;t kill your mood here at least.

Food:
Hot and Saucy wings! It&#39;s what you go here for of course! My favorite choice is the Garlic Parmesan because of how all the flavors fight for the affections of your taste buds. I find the chicken to be acceptable on most nights. To be honest, nothing wows me on the menu after the many times I have visited. But to be fair, I only go here for the wings so I am extremely limited. Don&#39;t get the fries.... I usually just go nuts on the edible wings.

Service:
Service is attentive on most nights. Quality of service ranges from okay to good. I&#39;ve been here a few time to know that service won&#39;t kill your mood here at least.

Food:
Hot and Saucy wings! It&#39;s what you go here for of course! My favorite choice is the Garlic Parmesan because of how all the flavors fight for the affections of your taste buds. I find the chicken to be acceptable on most nights. To be honest, nothing wows me on the menu after the many times I have visited. But to be fair, I only go here for the wings so I am extremely limited. Don&#39;t get the fries.... I usually just go nuts on the edible wings.

I tried watching a football game here but the problem is its way too loud to hear any of the commentary or calls. If you care about the audio in a game you should&#39;ve probably just watched at home. They play music which drowns out any sounds from the tv&#39;s. 

Now on to the food:

A word of advice about the wings. If you want to try alot of different varieties of sauces, go on a cheap wing night (i think tues/thurs) the wings are cheaper and physically smaller so you&#39;ll get to eat more. Also go with a bunch of people because they have bulk discounts on wings. 

I recommend the bone in wings more than the boneless ones. The boneless wings are usually dry in the middle and hard fried on the outside. 

The sauces are pretty darn good here. I like the teriyaki or carribean jerk. If you have cuts on your hands or lips, NEVER get the blazin wings.

Potato wedges are tasty also, their seasoning is good. 

A note on the atmosphere, it is LOUD in here. Don&#39;t bother trying to carry a long conversation here unless you like yelling. 

Overall I&#39;d say this place is great for wings but not that good for watching sports. 

Give it a shot if you&#39;re in the mood to sauce up your fingers and face.",08/11/12,146,4,1,2,4,1.6526,2.256,1.017,13.726,No,1383

Seems like the fight nights bring in a rough clientele so avoid going on those nights if that&#39;s not your scene. 

We ordered the pretzels and fried pickles for appetizers, both of which were good. The traditional wings we ordered were soggy and undercooked. Wing Stop&#39;s are much better and saucier.

2 =  if there is a wait of 20 minutes or more than 5 tables ahead of you... Advise you to WALK AWAY and GO ELSEWHERE.... when they are busy you will get slow service, the order may not come out all at once, and the food may be cold. Once they are busy and behind the 8 ball the service and accuracy of orders falls apart. To the managers credit, they have done their best to fix problems when you complain but by then everyone is eating at different times. 

4 =  If they are full but medium to slow busy. 
Pro&#39;s: Good for kids and enables parents to have a little break. There is noise and activity so you don&#39;t have to worry if a child gets a little upset or if your friend&#39;s child is going through a random scream phase. They have a free hand held game, with Free games, unlike some nearby places. Food has been served hot and of good quality. Amount of sauce on bone in wings has been perfect but boneless ones need a little bit more. They can usually bring out the kids food quicker but be warned that it will be HOT and need to cool down.
Cons:  The server is usually different from the person who delivers the food and this can cause a disconnect if order needs any adjustment. Prepare to mention it to both people who stop by the table as the delivery person does not always communicate with the server. Sometimes the kids food is too Hot and can take 10 min to cool down enough for them to eat.",13/06/14,155,3,1,2,-57,1.9984999999999997,1.571,0.483,11.946000000000002,No,1472

We went last night and when we walked in we thought we would be seated right away due to the fact that half the patio was open and there were over a handful of seats open in the main dining room. The hostess told us that it would be at least a 15 minute wait and I asked if there was a wait for the patio since it was half empty and she replied with the excuse &#34;I don&#39;t know. I am here alone and haven&#39;t checked.&#34; A couple came in right after us and said they wanted to sit on the patio and were seated right away.

After we were seated the service was sub-par and we were surrounded by tables with food under them and covered in trash for longer than they should have been. 

When we left at 9:45 the hostess still had a waiting list going even though there were over 8 tables open in the main dining room and the patio was less than half full.

I know it&#39;s probably one of the busiest days of the year for them, but that being said you&#39;d think they would have a better method for getting carry out orders out.  When I called they said it would be an hour and twenty minutes, which I was fine with.  When I arrived an hour later, it was mass chaos.  Once I paid I was told to wait by the special tables set up in the bar area.  The tables had so many people crowded around them you couldn&#39;t even get close.  They were set up by alphabet, and the A-G tables were empty.  I was waiting for a B order so I figured my order wasn&#39;t ready yet.  After about 20 minutes with only one girl trying to get orders out, I noticed there was a bag on the M-Z table that no one had touched.  I finally pressed my way through about 5 people to get close enough to check the receipt name, and sure enough it was my order.  There was no one to confirm with, so I just grabbed our bag and pushed through the growing crowd to get out.  People dining in were getting annoyed because they couldn&#39;t get through the crowd to the bathroom, and it was so  loud you couldn&#39;t even hear the game! When I got my food home it was cold and the order was wrong (sauces were incorrect, and cheese that was supposed to be on the side for the fries was cold and globbed on top.

Don&#39;t miss out on the artichoke appetizer.  Roasted with butter and breadcrumbs.  It was a fun and relaxing way to start dinner and get into your wine and a bargain at the same time.

The wine list I thought was a bit spartan.  Not a large list in general, and especially in the few Italian choices.  Not that it&#39;s inadequate, but I just would&#39;ve expected the wine list to match the large menu.

The pastas were phenomenal, in particular the bolognase, and can definitely be shared by a few as a primi or as a large main course. I really liked their option for penne versus the traditional long noodle. Big, rich flavor really rose to the occasion.

Ambience - in the bar area, of all places - was actually pretty nice. We sat right by the toasty warm fire. Speaking of toasty - the complimentary bread was nice and steamy!

I had the chicken polenta dish ($17) and, like a schmuck who doesn&#39;t appropriately pair my wines with my proteins, a glass of Mnajtrois (mixed red, $7). The pour was generous.

The chicken (2 breasts) was delicious: very tender and perfectly cooked, saucy, and seasoned well. It was topped with big chunks of fresh mushrooms. The side of spinach was generous and lightly steamed. I&#39;d never had polenta before, and it was sadly the most &#34;forgettable&#34; part of the dish... I think just due to the fact that the portion of it was literally dwarfed by the chicken.

My +1 had a pasta dish and he requested a different pasta than was listed on the menu, plus veggies that were also not listed. He was accommodated with a smile, which I thought was very nice. 

Our young male server was personable and attentive without being overbearing. The only thing I thought was a bit unprofessional was the PDA between him and a female hostess - bear hugs and neck nuzzling. (Ahh, young love!)

The carpaccio with wild mushrooms and avocado is always a must order for me here &amp; the baked goat cheese in tomato sauce while not a complicated dish, satisfies your need for some warm, comforting cheese.  These starters alone could complete my meal &amp; have.

For entrees the pan roasted chicken with roasted artichoke hearts in a tomato sauce with melted mozzarella and side of linguini is delicious.  I especially LOVE the artichokes (mmmmm) &amp;  reasonably priced compared to some of their other entrees or when you don&#39;t feel like spending $30 on a New York strip.  But when you do, this is just as good as some of steaks you&#39;ll find at upscale steak houses and it comes with potatoes and a veggie..no this not a la carte.  Entrees are decent portions.   I don&#39;t usually order the pasta dishes only because I think spending over $12 on pasta here is a crime especially when its very simply prepared.  Pasta is cheap and so are tomatoes.  I opt for either steak, poultry or seafood specials.  Pizza&#39;s are pretty tasty too..

They also have a small outdoor patio.  Just come and hang out at the bar, enjoy the ambience or savor an above average meal.  They&#39;ll treat you like a paisano!!!  Salute!",19/05/15,264,4,3,5,77,6.571599999999999,3.9509999999999996,0.974,21.074999999999996,No,2468

We often sit in the bar when we go which is nice (though there is dining room seating); therefore, we usually get the same waiter!

    The food has always been great, so far, and I&#39;ve ordered various dishes. Having just eaten there yet again, whatever I ate was so good that I&#39;m glad I have leftovers. Some sort of gnocchi and shrimp in a garlic cream sauce and what may&#39;ve been calamari. Definitely recommend it. The desserts are good, my little sister is very fond of the crme brle.

So if you too experienced that and are amazed they&#39;re still open, give it another try.

I&#39;ve never gone wrong when I&#39;ve ordered the special of the day and at Zaza&#39;s, their lunch special was impressive.  Two of the specials were salmon, and two of us opted for the grilled salmon, served with a creamy mushroom leek sauce, served with sauteed spinach.  It was absolutely delicious.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  Fresh and flaky (in a good way) and so flavorful.  The sauce was divine, I had it served on the side and I just wanted to mop the rest up with my bread. One of the lunch trio ordered the salmon Caesar and that looked just as impressive.  The salmon that was served to us was a very nice portion and not at all a &#34;lunchified&#34; portion--you know what I mean. 
We lingered over coffee--it was Lavazza.  Rich, bold, wonderful taste. Refills aplenty.

We asked to be seated at one of 6 empty tables away from this area and were told &#34;each and every table&#34; was booked until close (and the manager was dealing with &#34;1000&#34; catering orders, so they weren&#39;t available).

Several coworkers had commented on how wonderful their food is.   When the opportunity to choose a place for special girl&#39;s night Leap Day dinner presented itself to me I jumped at the chance.  ZaZa&#39;s it is!  I appreciated when I called to make the reservation Victor asked if I wanted the Addison location, which I did, as I didn&#39;t realize they had another location.  

The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous inside.  I love the decor and the ambiance is perfect.  Upscale but not pretentious.  They have a nice little bar area and a decent amount of high-top seating in the lounge, then regular tables in the dining area.  

The have an excellent drink menu and I opted for the white wine flight - all three wines were equally good, though I&#39;m always partial to a riesling.  My friends had red wine which they also enjoyed.  They have so many wonderful things on the menu you won&#39;t have to twist my arm to come back here again for more!  They also had a number of specials, which I usually prefer to order from at any restaurant.  Our group all ordered from the specials menu and were not disappointed.

I had an amazing salmon dish.  It was a layered dish which started with a wonderful tomato and basil sauce on the plate, a potato pancake, roasted fennel, then a large grilled salmon filet, perfectly seasoned, with light arugula salad and viniagrette on top.  Wow.  A few of us had the same dish and I was the only one who resisted consuming it all.  So very delicious.

I was a little disappointed by the portion size of the Salmon.  I was expecting a nice 1-2&#34; thick cut and a good serving size of 5-8 oz.  The piece I received was rather thin on the ends making the crispy fried outside (pan basted) texture overpowering.  This also made the ends rather dry, which made the cut feel much smaller than what it probably weighed prior.  The fire roasted spinach was okay, but under seasoned (or no seasoning used at all).  The sauce was also okay, but lacked a mustard taste which I was looking forward to.  The portabella mushrooms were very delicious.  They were very well prepared.  They were hot and tender, but not so much they were mush.  Next time I plan on trying some other entree.

I had the rib eye, medium rare, and it was the greatest steak I&#39;ve ever had in my life. It was seasoned perfectly, had an amazing char on it, and was cooked superbly. I was a little offput at first when it came out with a light gravy on it, considering the place is a self proclaimed &#34;steakhouse,&#34; but with the first bite I realized that the gravy didn&#39;t take away from the steak, and the steak certainly didn&#39;t need the gravy. It was light enough that it complimented the steak perfectly and kept the flavor on it instead of running all over the plate. I also ordered mushrooms on the side as I typically do, but found that I actually preferred the steak without them. This is not to say that the mushrooms weren&#39;t good however, because quite the contrary was true. The mixed vegetables were very good, the garlic mashed were alright and probably would have gone great with some more of that steak gravy, but the star of the entree definitely shined. I paired the meal with an Argentinean malbec that was also phenomenal. To finish the visit, I ordered the Chocolate Tartufo. I&#39;m not huge on desert at restaurants, but this completed the meal wonderfully.

zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Roseanne S.,lg1UvP-7KLtjSdxbFbt3Aw,RPaWh_DvrU2JmNthKXoQXw,"Definitely was not impressed. Living in the area, I pass this place by many times and always wondered about it. My boyfriend and I really had a taste for steak and seeing as this is a STEAKhouse, we decided to try it out. There was nobody in the resturant on a Saturday at 5 which to me is always a warning sign, but we went in anyway. 

The inside was nicely set up with white table clothes and the like. I was very disappointed when I saw the menu, though. Only two steak items? Are you kidding me? Their steak options were New York Strip and Filet Mingon. I&#39;m a girl who loves a good, hearty steak so I was looking forward to a Ribeye, which was not to be found. The waitress came by with the specials. As soon as she said Ribeye, my ears perked up only to find out that it was a 20 oz Ribeye for $40. Yikes. That&#39;s way too much steak. I could have gotten it, but then I would have leftovers for sure, and it wouldn&#39;t taste as good the next day, if I remembered to eat it. And that price tag is too high. I asked if they had a half portion of the Ribeye and she said they do on some days but today was not one of those days. I don&#39;t think you should have this popular steak available on SOME days. Also, they should think of the money they could make if they offered a smaller portion. Instead of selling me an $8 salad which is what I ended up getting, you could have sold me a 10 oz steak for $20. Win-win.  

Like I said, I ordered a salad (Caprese) which was nothing special. I had made one at home earlier that week and it was much better. They used way too much oil. I was scraping it off on the side of my plate. My boyfriend had some pasta which looked good and was a huge portion, but I wasn&#39;t in the mood for pasta at a steakhouse. Maybe this is what an Italian steakhouse is but for my money, I&#39;d rather go somewhere with a lot of meat options if I&#39;m going to pay that much.

So, my husband and I decided to try their Addison location since we were going to the movies across the street this past weekend. Based on both of our meals (and we tried eachother&#39;s)....the consensus was a big NO.

The staff was friendly and there were a couple of larger groups in the same seating area as us who were seeming to enjoy their food.  The hostess and our waitress were very friendly.    I did think it a bit odd she didn&#39;t ask if we wanted to start out with an appetizer (or make recommendations), ask if we wanted a salad, etc.    I&#39;ve never been to an Italian restaurant that didn&#39;t ask if you wanted pepper or fresh parmesan cheese grated onto your pasta.   The waitress didn&#39;t ask or offer.

I got the special of the night - Mahi Mahi with scallops and garlic mashed potatoes.  My meal was very watery - if it was intended to be the sauce, it certainly didn&#39;t have any flavor and was more like water.  The garlic mashed potatoes had no flavor and were watered down.  They put the Mahi Mahi on top of the potatoes and there were barely any potatoes that I actually forgot there were potatoes on my plate until I got half way through the Mahi Mahi (due to having no taste and they weren&#39;t very visible along with the spinach).   The scallops had a very fish smell so I am going to assume that is because they were very fresh.   Disappointing to say the least for a $24 dish.

My husband had the Penne Abruzzese and he was not impressed with it.  It seemed to lack on the meat and just wasn&#39;t very flavorful overall.

The best we had that evening was the warm bread - very good with the tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.   I thought of sending the Mahi Mahi back but we were hungry and didn&#39;t want to miss our movie.   But we won&#39;t be back at this ZaZa&#39;s location.

My husband&#39;s office is nearby so occasionally, we come here after I pick him up for dinner right before their closing time. I also come here with one of my girlfriends for girls night out. 

I&#39;m so beyond disappointed with the owner/manager&#39;s service--I&#39;ve seen better customer service/appreciation at Olive Garden. I always order penne with vodka sauce and lobster. The last few times I&#39;ve been here, food was so disappointing I ordered takeout after. This was strike three for me. 

My husband and I try not to indulge in carbs too much so when we treat ourselves to pasta, we split our entree to eat smaller portions--the servers are all awesome and know my order. They split a lobster tail in half for me and my husband, but it was so so so salty it literally made me gag. I immediately took it out of my plate, but i had already mixed it into my pasta so it ruined my amazing vodka sauce! I called the server who told a man I&#39;m assuming is the owner--he didn&#39;t at all apologize or show any sincerity. He seemed irritated with my complaint and said the kitchen was closed. He asked if both mine and my husbands lobster was bad (uhm, you split one tail down the middle so obviously). I asked if I could have a fresh plate because my pasta became salty as HELL. He said kitchens closed but he will take &#39;my pasta&#39; off..I explained yet again that I split a single entree with my husband and he said he will take &#39;something off&#39;..I said its fine ill just eat it because it was my first meal for the day and I didn&#39;t feel like stopping somewhere again after waiting on their food. 

When we got the check, my pasta is $17.95 + $20 for the lobster tail + $3 to split and at the end there was a -$10. Wtf?!?! We shut up and ate salty ass pasta and returned the lobster tail, at least don&#39;t charge us for the tail! Our server was a sweetheart and said the guy was probably &#39;confused&#39; so he literally came up to our table to ask us in person if we ate the half of the lobster tail..my husband explained that we both took out the tails off our plate. Again, this guy was not apologetic whatsoever &amp; seemed annoyed as if he didn&#39;t believe us. What kind of management harasses their customer or risks their integrity over $20?!?! I felt embarrassed to even be asked to explain something for $10! This is a &#34;steakhouse&#34;! 

1.) I live in downtown, I have a million options for dining. 

2.) I come here ONLY for the vodka sauce, I don&#39;t give an eff about a refund. It&#39;s the principle and lousy service that made us even point out that they didn&#39;t even take the entire lobster tail off our bill. I wasn&#39;t trying to get anything taken off my bill, I wanted to eat a semi-consistent tasting pasta. Anyone who orders the same exact thing every time can understand how annoying it is when it doesn&#39;t taste the same--this was the third time in a row this happened. 

3.) Not everyone is after a free meal. If I wasn&#39;t irritated over the lame food and owner&#39;s attitude, I wouldn&#39;t have objected to a measly $10. I&#39;ve never so much as checked a single price on their menu and until today, I had no idea how much I pay for my usual entree--as long as the food is on point, I&#39;m satisfied.

We had never been there, but picked a place in between our parents so it would be convenient for them.  Our waitress, Chelsea, was not wonderful.  She was not attentive and instead of asking me to repeat myself twice she said &#34;What?&#34;. Pet peeve...that&#39;s not polite, people!  She would wander off for 5-10 minutes and we could never find her to get a drink or a refill. We tossed around the idea of ordering 2 or 3 bottles of champagne, then decided on 2.  She brought 3.  We gave her the unopened one back and she had the nerve to state twice that we had ordered 3.  There were 6 of us at the table...that&#39;s 12 ears to her 2 ears.  She took it back, reluctantly.  The bottle was unopened so I&#39;m not sure what the issue was.  All of the pastas were ok at best, the pesto was AWFUL, probably the worst I&#39;ve ever had-super bland, boring, yuck. There was a special Valentine&#39;s Day menu that they would not deviate away from which made me angry because there was NOTHING diet friendly on there.  There was no mention of this special menu online either, so we had no way of knowing.  Preparing for a wedding, I wasn&#39;t trying to eat a heavy meal.

The place was SO loud and SO crowded.  We were on top of the surrounding tables and could hardly get out to go to the bathroom. I hate that! 

After the waitress was rude, my fiance went and talked to the manager, Al.  He didn&#39;t comp anything, but he brought us limoncello....which was gross.  I&#39;ve never had it in a glass with ice and it was just way too bitter to sip.  However, he was really nice, chatted with us, took a picture for us and for that I gave this place another star.

Overall, I&#39;d say this place was mediocre, but I don&#39;t often eat in Addison so I don&#39;t know where else I would recommend.  Do your research ;)",20/02/13,213,2,1,-1,3,-1.1379,2.013,2.9260000000000006,18.059999999999995,No,1925

My bf and I were craving Italian one evening and figured we would give ZaZa&#39;s a shot since we had heard fairly good things about it. The menu looked appealing, the environment was romantic, and the prices seemed fair, so we were in. 

I definitely got that old school Italian vibe. Our waitress was an Italian woman who was over-the-top ((in a good, ol&#39; fashioned Italian way!)) about making sure we got exactly what we wanted. Needless to say, the service was fantastic. 

Here&#39;s where it gets lame-o. I ordered the Capellini Pomodoro, and he ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Talk about venturing out and really trying the menu items, huh?? Oh well. Neither of us were super starving, and we were craving a big bowl of spaghetti - nothing wrong with that!! Both dishes were very good. The pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente. The sauces were rich and garlicky. Yum. The meatball was the size of a softball, and was tender and juicy. The portions were massive. I had lunch for the next following two days. We also had a couple martinis each - and they don&#39;t skimp on the booze. I definitely left with a pasta coma and a buzz -- if it&#39;s possible to have both at once. 

I will be back to give ZaZa&#39;s another go. It&#39;s probably not the place I would choose to order a steak, but I will definitely give their chicken dishes or fancied-up pasta dishes a whirl. Mangia!!",08/02/12,179,4,2,5,18,6.3763000000000005,3.989,0.113,19.898,No,1451

Service
Fantastic!  On their busy evenings the service may be a little on the slow side, but it is understandable.
Food
Appetizers: Baked clams- they are small, but packed with flavor.  The sauce that they are served in - lemon, garlic, butter - is to die for.  Stuffed artichoke: again wonderful.  the stuffing is not too heavy and it too is served in a lemon, butter, garlic type sauce that is phenomenal!
Entrees:  All of the pastas are wonderful.  They are full of flavor and are generous portions.  I have not had the steak, but others at our table have, and all have enjoyed it.  The fish - especially the whitefish - is delicious, and, like the pasta, a generous portion.
Desserts: Basic, but good.

The place was surprisingly empty for a Saturday night, but then again, we walked in at 9:45 and they were set to close pretty early (10:30).

We sat at the bar and ordered drinks - sangria for my friends, the Tuscan Sun martini for me. I was VERY pleased with my drink because it was nice and strong, just the way I like it. I tend to be disappointed with the quality of drinks at suburban restaurants, so this was a pleasant surprise. 

Ordered two appetizers to share - the artichoke and the scallops, both of which were delicious and perfect to split among three people. They also gave us fresh-out-of-the-oven bread with two little bowls of tomato sauce and parmesan cheese for extra flavor - YUM!

I&#39;d recommend this place if you live in the suburbs, like your drinks strong, and don&#39;t want to worry about waiting a while for a table on a weekend. I plan to come back for a full meal (read: steak).",24/10/10,118,4,2,4,38,3.9118000000000004,1.741,0.308,6.951,No,1033

The place was beautiful and spacious -- fireplace visible from the outside, red walls and modern furnishings on the inside, somewhat odd Greek statue-inspired paintings.  The waitstaff was friendly.

There were 3 solid vegetarian options for dinner, all pastas. I had the ravioli alla fungi which was only about $12. Very tasty, though the sauce was too salty.

They were pretty dead, but it was a Wednesday evening. I was in a big group of women, and I have to say they did a good job with keeping up. On their menu they have quite a bit to choose from - anything from chicken to pasta to steak. It&#39;s a nicer place, not overly expensive by any means, but I would say they are a little more expensive than an Olive Garden, but not like a 5 star restaurant. I ordered the Pollo Arrosto al Rosmarino, which was really really good. I also tried the risotto which was very good as well. Out waitress was very nice and informative, but she repeated herself a lot. She made sure we knew that they could substitute for different things and make any dish how we liked it.

When we walked in at about 730 pm there were a 4-5 tables occupied in the entire restaurant, a signal to us that something was awry.  We decided to sit in the bar area; it seemed more appealing to us.  The waiter was a bit pushy and recommended a wine to us, which was one of the more expensive ones on the menu (go figure).  We ordered a couple drinks, and they standard.  Our bruschetta appetizer was very good and garlicky and cheesy.

The waiter was friendly but was rather pushy on a couple of expensive dishes.  He probably worked at a car dealership at some point in his life because he was a terrific salesman.  I ordered a New York Strip steak - medium.  It was heavily seasoned with mushrooms and prosciutto yet nothing spectacular.  My friend S ordered a Chicken Limone and he seemed to enjoy it thoroughly - he was grinning like an idiot through his entire meal :).

It seems funny to me that this place is called an Italian steakhouse even though they really don&#39;t have a wide variety of steaks.

Also why is everything ala cart, I mean this was in Itasca, not the Chicago Firehouse on Michigan in Chicago. Also the waitress had ADD or something, not that it should matter but we didnt get a straight answer from her and she just stared into the wall ahead of us without making eye contact. Weird.

Yes, really.   Well, it was actually a huge portrait of Michelangelo&#39;s David, with a bright green merkin.   I found myself staring, despite my best efforts.  I think if you are going to have a giant portrait of David, you should just embrace the nakedness - it&#39;d be less distracting than a huge green merkin.

We started out in the bar, while waiting for the rest of our party.  At 6pm, it was quite nice, but I could see it&#39;d be unpleasant and packed later in the evening, since they had really crammed a lot of tables in there.   I had the house Shiraz, which was truly very good.   

Since it was New Years Eve, they had a special menu &#34;because they had prepped a ton of stuff&#34;, according to our waiter.  Which, fair enough.  The menu still had a lot of options.   Our appetizers were excellent - we all split an asparagus salad, fried calamari and a really really yummy shrimp dish.  

Our entrees were reasonably good - I had the filet, topped with lump crab and a yummy sauce.  My steak was cooked well.  It was a bit salty, but not horribly so.  Or at least, it wouldn&#39;t have been a problem, if my wine glass and water wasn&#39;t empty, and had been for some time.   Everyone else seemed reasonably happy with their entrees, especially the folks who had gotten pasta.

So, why only three stars?  Honestly, the service wasn&#39;t all that great.  It felt like they were battening the hatches for New Years Eve, so everything felt rushed and like a crisis was about to erupt.  The host and hostess seemed flustered, and it was only 6 pm.  We had a hard time getting drinks - the waiter, when he took our dinner order, only seemed to notice one person&#39;s drink was empty - I had to ask when he came back some time later for another glass of wine.

We started the evening with martini&#39;s.  They had a raspberry cosmo.  Very tasty!  My husband and I do not agree on appetizers so much.  He loves shrimp cocktail, and I on the other hand, love calamari.  We always run into this problem, and most fine dining restaurants will not do a half order of calamari.  ZaZa&#39;s did this for me.  I opted for the grilled calamari.  It was very tasty.  A little zesty, drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  Our entree&#39;s were great as well.  To finish off the evening, I had a turtle martini, and we shared a tiramisu.  The tiramisu was excellent.  The drizzled the plate with a dark chocolate syrup, which really complimented the coffee flavor of the tiramisu. 

From the outside, you do not know what to expect, being as ZaZa&#39;s is in a strip mall, but the inside is very inviting.  The prices belong downtown, but you feel as though you are downtown when you are in there, so I guess the pricing goes with the atmosphere.

The place was beautiful inside, very modern and very comfortable atmosphere.  The waitress was good, she recommended a red wine for me and it did not disappoint.

I had veal scallions.  The sauce was WAY too salty.  The veal was perfectly cooked though.  It came with a side of linguine which was a little cold and not too much sauce which is good to me.  My husband had the bone in rib-eye:  medium.  It was very rare and he sent it back to be re-cooked.  Also, the au jus sauce was quite peculiar so when they re-cooked it he asked for no sauce.  The waitress was apologetic and very accommodating and of course it wasn&#39;t her fault it was undercooked so she still got a substantial tip.

The spinach was al dente and very bright green.  I will admit my husband does like his steak medium rare.  He actually received a medium rare steak.  There was not too much fat and very tender.  Just enough sauce to let the steak shine through.  Delicious!  The wait staff was very attentive.  We drink a lot of water and our water glasses were never empty.  Plates were politely picked up in between courses and we were always asked if there was anything we needed.  We did have the house made limoncello followed by a decafe espresso and the biscotti.  We enjoyed the limoncello as neither of us like anything too sweet.  The biscotti was an excellent choice with the espresso, again not too sweet.  The owner, Al stopped by our table to greet us.  He was very cordial.  Our server even stopped long enough to share a story or two with us.  The accommodations were very comfortable.  We sat near a window but did not hear the outside car noise.  The tables were large enough to be comfortable and were always picked up between courses.  No rush, but very comfortable.  The lighting was not too bright but not so dim that we could not read the menu.  Tables were spaced comfortably apart.  The dcor was mostly wood and gave a home feel.  Soft Italian singers played in the background.  It did not drown out our conversation.  We enjoyed the restaurant and will return again.  The food, wine, personal customer service and atmosphere were very enjoyable.",21/02/13,246,5,3,5,58,8.6817,7.167,0.9760000000000001,32.857000000000006,No,2240

Sergio&#39;s boasts deals on these two items throughout the week. According to the sign out front margaritas are 1/2 price on Tuesday and Thursday. You can also get shrimp tacos on Friday. Unfortunately, I came on a Sunday and, as far as I can tell, there aren&#39;t any good discounts on those days. Nonetheless, we decided to check the place out since I&#39;ve passed it almost every time I&#39;ve been in Geneva. I mean, it&#39;s on State St, so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s easy to miss.

We&#39;d been hiking up and down the hills in this town all afternoon for a photo shoot, so we were very thirsty and requested lots of water right at the beginning. We quickly gulped down our glasses and were left with empty cups for quite a while. Our waiter finally returned with a pitcher of water and my fianc asked him to leave it so we could help ourselves. He seemed to be able to mange that request better and kept refilling our pitcher as needed.

We ordered the guacamole with bacon and pineapple. It was pretty interesting but I don&#39;t know if the bacon really added to this appetizer. I did like the pineapple, so I&#39;m glad we tried something new.

My fianc got a chorizo burrito and I ordered the lamb street tacos with a side of garlic butter vegetables. We both really liked what we got, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go out of my way for it. As was expected, the burrito was not nearly as good as our favorite hole-in-the-wall taqueria&#39;s, but the refried beans were really tasty. I enjoyed the lamb tacos very much but the vegetables were overly salted.

For drinks we got shots of Frida Kahlo tequila, the horchata and a piarita. The tequila was nice and sweet, the horchata was really great, and the piarita is passable. I think I&#39;ll stick to drinks on the patio next time and see how they do their other margaritas.

I want to say that I am part Mexican and lived in Texas about 5 miles from Mexico and used to go eat in Mexico, a lot, both inland and on the coasts -- so you can say I am VERY picky about my Mexican food.

Sorry, but the shrimp and avocado tostadoes were barely meh.  Frozen shrimp cut into pieces so small I actually searched through the toppings for them.  What was worse were the refried beans on the side that were out of a can -- yes, I can tell the difference.  A Mexican restaurant can&#39;t make its own refried beans?  The only thing quasi-spicy was the salsa that came with the store-bought tortilla chips.

Went here with my family for my brother&#39;s birthday - when we arrived it was fairly dead, but then the crowds picked up pretty quick.

- Chips and salsa were &#34;pretty good&#34;.

- My nachos were just &#34;okay&#34;.  While they were indeed loaded with everything, it looked like a big mess.  95% of the chips I picked up had everything that was on them just &#34;slide off&#34;, so at best I ate a bunch of soggy chips with some residual refried beans on them.  The sour cream looked as if it has been squirted on from a bottle - I prefer sour cream to just be a scoop or two on the side, not squirted all over the nachos as if it was salad dressing.  I left half of what was left in the plate as I didn&#39;t want to scoop it all up with a fork and eat it that way.  The stuff in the plate looked (the OPTICS of it, I mean) more like canned dog food than a good nacho platter.  They were ok at best, but I would not get them again.

- Beers are expensive.  My brother got two Corona&#39;s which were about $9 together.   A bit pricey.

- My family all said their meals were &#34;decent.&#34;

- Our waiter service was okay.  He was kinda slow at times, but he did get us chip refills and drink refills, so all was okay there.

- Bathrooms are the &#34;single, lock door type.&#34;  One for men, one for women.  One toilet, one sink - no urinals or multiple stalls or sinks.  I do not even think there were paper-towels or a hand dryer in there.  So only one person can be in there at a time, unlike most other restaurant washrooms which can be used by multiple people at a time and your privacy is still maintained.  This kind of bathroom is more appropriate for one of those small, shin-ding gift shops or car/home insurance places, NOT a mid-sized restaurant.  Now keep in mind this is a MEXICAN restaurant to boot, if you get my drift (I know most guys will).  In peak times, lines can back up waiting for use of the bathroom and you will hear people knocking on the door.  If anybody really has to get in there and it is backed up, I feel sorry for ya (or - go across the street real quick to Little Owl).  

All in all, just an &#39;okay&#39; place for me.  I can&#39;t say I&#39;d never come here again, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to make plans to come here either.  I assume this place does fairly well (especially spring thru fall) MOSTLY because of the &#34;location aspect&#34; - being Downtown Geneva - and having a historic, prime location right off of State St. and the Fox River.",15/04/15,290,3,1,5,-7,4.2187,2.3320000000000003,0.594,25.074999999999996,No,2549

It&#39;s the same size as Lalos, but without the huge price tag of $11!  Not as delicious as Lalos, but still pretty good.  I tried both the mango and strawberry margaritas and preferred the strawberry.  The mango one had a strange taste.  

There was quite a wait for a table with about 10 people crowded by the door.  Luckily, our other half of the party had arrived half an hour early and had been waiting so that I only waited a couple of minutes before we got our table.

For dinner, I went with the pick your own 2 combo option - I chose with tamale and enchilada.  For $10, I got 1 chicken tamale, 1 chicken enchilada, rice and beans.  Seems pricey for those 2 main entrees, but there were other options that may have provided more food.  The tamale and enchilada were good.  The rice was on the hard side, but decent.  With enough half price margaritas, anything can taste good!

I&#39;d say the 3 star a-ok is exactly right for this place. The margaritas are good tasting and very large- but are likely made with a mix (I prefer the fresh ones from up the street). I&#39;ve tried several different dishes here- the fish tacos, enchiladas, etc. Everything I&#39;ve eaten has been fine- nothing terrible, but nothing great either. I do love that they provide free chips and salsa- and refills are free too. 

I will give Sergio&#39;s two major pluses- I have always had great service. I&#39;ve been waited on by several different staff members, and they are always friendly, attentive, and able to answer numerous questions. I also think that Sergio&#39;s is a great place for groups. I&#39;ve been here several times with parties of 10 plus people- and it is always a great time. Many of the other Mexican restaurants in the area are far too small for group gatherings- so anytime we want to do something in a big group, this is where we come.

Avoid Sergio&#39;s during peak times. Sergio&#39;s is just too small for the crush of too many people. We went at 1:30 on a Thursday and owned the place with about 3 other couples. Plenty of time to ask a lot of questions about the menu from Jerry whose recommendations were very helpful. 
Sergio&#39;s decor is bright and cheery with a lot of windows. I like a place where I can keep an eye on my car. There is a convenient public parking lot right across the street.

My older brother went with a pick two, a delicious beef burrito that was stuffed with the usual ground beef, rice, cheese, lettuce, sour cream and lightly grilled, and a tasty steak taco. I told our server Jerry that I was trying to decide between the chile relleno, the 3 drumstick mole or carnitas and he said for another $1 I could do a pick 3 and get one of each. Perfect. I liked each with the chicken mole being my favorite, not too greasy or salty and you could get the chocolate undertones for once. The chile relleno was house made and huge. I could have taken a lot more heat AND Jerry provided a ho-made looking hotter table sauce and it was perfect. The pork taco was also good, not too greasy, salty or overcooked like you get all the time. They slow cook and the carnitas still had a pink glow. Our meals came with small servings of rice and beans and better than usual friendly helpful service from Jerry. 
Our two lunches and one ice tea came to $25, fair enuf. 

Even though it was half price Margarita Thursday we still had a lot of things to do so went with their unsweetened peach iced tea. I didn&#39;t like it, and would have preferred a just plain not sweetened iced tea, but a little sugar helped.

Too cool for the patio but it looked like it would be a lot of fun on a nice night. It is not going to be quiet out there as several big trucks confirmed instantly.  
So check your expectations and avoid peak times and plan accordingly. We thought the food was surprisingly good and look forward to a half price margarita night on the deck but it is going to be crowded and not the best margarita we ever had, but the best one we ever had on a patio in Geneva for $3.50.",18/04/15,257,4,2,5,20,5.354699999999999,3.903,0.9179999999999999,19.179000000000002,No,2177
sergios-cantina-geneva,Jeannine M.,RNVE5O6CWb9ZtraKz3hwDg,MoD3k0Eun7dR3tDXLGkMRw,"We wanted to love this place based on the street tacos we had at the Festival of the Vines a couple of weeks ago (steak CC).  Either we were starving or they used a higher quality of steak at the Festival. 

But let&#39;s start at the beginning. The stale chips and what tasted like jarred salsa was not appetizing at all. We ordered the house margaritas on the rocks - my 15 year old son could make a better margarita and he doesn&#39;t even drink (that I know of). It tasted like pure lime juice on the rocks. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love lime juice. I always have a lime available in my house. I&#39;m not a fan of sweet n sour (all sour), what about triple sec or splash of OJ? Something to tame the taste. I had to wait for my tacos to arrive to even down it. At least it wasn&#39;t that expensive or I would have felt cheated 

On to the tacos. I can eat any fatty meat (prime rib, fatty ribs, bacon w lots of fat), but I cannot do gristle!  I had to pull out at least 5 or 6 large pieces in my steak tacos. I grew up w authentic Mexican food. I never remember my uncle Lalo&#39;s tacos like this. The sauce was wonderful. Thank goodness it helped me get down the steak and the margarita. I also had a side of rice that came w my meal. Sooo under cooked. I know Mexican rice might have some firmness depending on the family but this was either overcooked sitting in a tin or way undercooked. I was sad seeing I barely eat rice. We had also ordered the shrimp tacos. The shrimp tasted fishy and the texture rubbery. The Pico served w I think some green verde, mediocre at best. 

The atmosphere - wish it was warmer and I could have sat outside. I felt it to be too bright, cafeteria style and SUPER loud. Plus our table was a random squeezed in table practically up against where the servers grab the food. It was like we were having dinner with the family next to us. 

I&#39;m giving it 2 stars because I&#39;m nice and I&#39;m guessing a family establishment. We will never go back.",21/09/14,242,2,2,5,40,5.949,4.288,0.9710000000000001,25.741999999999997,No,1993

sergios-cantina-geneva,Jon F.,rkZYr1Rf6aASwDYNjrXIiA,IE-5wDUxwG0w3nAgCHz_Yw,"I&#39;m a bit surprised by all the negative reviews.  A little more space in this place might be nice (and since they can open the patio in the summer - there is for half of the year), but other than that that I enjoyed my meal here quite a bit!

Lets start with the reason you came:  Half price margaritas on Tuesday &amp; Thursday!  2 of our strawberry margaritas were pretty good.  One of my party said the flavor could be a little stronger, but I was OK with it when I tried their drink.  My mango was plenty strong (in both flavor and booze) and tasted great!

We had the Shrimp And Chorizo Queso Fundido for one appetizer.  It was as greasy as you expect chorizo to be and the shrimp were tasty.  One or two more quesadillas might be nice, but we made it work.  We also had the pineapple and bacon guacamole.  There was a nice little pile of small pineapple chunks and bacon on each side of a mound of guacamole that was a great flavor combination.  When I saw it I was hoping for a little more quantity, but by the time we were done eating I realized that was uncalled for.

I was stuck between lamb tacos, pork belly tacos, and the chile relleno combo.  I went with the latter and was, again, a bit disappointed in getting 1 chile relleno (note - there&#39;s no &#34;S&#34; on the menu for this one silly!) however it was pretty good.  Then I moved on the the skirt steak part of the combo and color me surprised - that was probably the best skirt steak I&#39;ve ever had!  Cooked perfectly with a sear to medium rare and the flavor was outstanding.  The black beans, rice, and accompanying peppers were good - but nobody is writing home about those.  

After sitting back lamenting about my fullness I realized that, once again, the portion size was correct (and hey, it is a giant pain to make chile rellenos).  2 appetizers between 4 people usually doesn&#39;t leave me with anything to take home, but today we had 3 very decent take out boxes in tow.

We brought a Groupon which presented no issue at all and the waitress was friendly and helpful.

My tips:
-Call your reservation in, we showed up to a half an hour wait and it looked like it was getting longer than that immediately.
-Be adventurous and try a new dish!  The menu has both the basic classics and some very interesting spins on dishes.
-Make sure somebody in your party gets the skirt steak.  I never thought the stuff could taste so good.


My only complaints would be:
1) Our table for 4 was near the bar/entrance.  Lucky me, that meant people would bump their rears into the back of my head regularly throughout the meal.
2) Someone in our party asked for red sauce and was given verde.  This could have been a sound/busy/distraction problem, but sometimes things just don&#39;t work like you want.",10/04/13,304,4,2,5,37,7.641499999999998,5.57,1.412,23.01799999999999,No,2779

I moved to Illinois last year after 26 years in Southern California. There is almost NO good Mexican food in Illinois. I feel like I&#39;ve tried EVERY restaurant. And every time, disappointed.

This place is over 20 miles from my house and I will drive there next time I want GOOD Mexican food. It&#39;s NOT a grease truck. You can find those. 

The salsa is THE BEST I&#39;VE EVER HAD IN THIS STATE. The chips are made fresh. We had three rounds and it was all FREE. Unheard of in IL. I ate three bowls of that salsa. Mild kick, but it&#39;s the flavor that was delicious.

The chicken mole was like $12 and there were two large chicken breasts covered with homemade mole. Delicious.

Enchilada with roja sauce was incredible and the avocado tostada was also incredible. 

My SIL had the coconut crusted tilapia. Not authentic, obvy, but she liked it. I wouldn&#39;t order it. Fried fish isn&#39;t my thing.

The queso (which I don&#39;t like as it&#39;s not popular where I&#39;m from) was excellent and much like a fondue instead. No Velveeta here, folks. Real cheddar!

I&#39;ll get the guac next time for sure. 

My only issue was that they use chicken stock in their rice and I don&#39;t like that. Also, I could&#39;ve used more black beans on my plate-- as they don&#39;t have refried and their pinto beans aren&#39;t veggie-friendly.

Chips and Salsa: 9/10 - Fantastic! Almost perfection. Chips are great; one type of salsa but thats all you need. It&#39;s a green/red blended mix with the perfect amount of spice.

Entrees: 3/10 - Pretty bad. I had a chicken chimichanga and I kid you not, it tasted like sushi. Had an extremely off-putting fish taste. It was also covered in an acidic sauce. No bueno.

Margs: Was too turned off to try them.

We never once got checked on, never got refills, never anything! We didn&#39;t get napkins or silverware with the meal either. We never got the check, we waited OVER an hour. We walked to the kitchen and asked for it and she gave us this look like &#34;who are you?&#34; and took another 10 minutes trying to formulate the bill. NEVER gave an apology. I happily gave her a big fat ZERO on the tip line. This service alone will prevent my fiancee and I from ever returning.",20/05/13,160,1,2,2,20,1.6163,2.612,2.306,18.081999999999997,No,1224

One of my favorite things is the chips and homemade salsa (which is always complimentary). I love the hot salsa too, it has the perfect amount of heat for those that love an extra kick in their salsa. If you go in after 10pm they have a half price street taco menu which is a great deal. Tuesdays and Thursdays they have half price frozen fruit and house margaritas. If you like meat, I&#39;d recommend Sergio&#39;s family recipe carnitas entree. The pork is slow cooked for over six hours with such richness in flavor and the cactus salad side dish that comes with it is delicious too.

Like Roger Ebert says, &#39;there&#39;s no excuse for making a bad movie,&#39; I feel the same way about food: how can you run a restaurant and settle for plying your customers with mediocre chow? Especially Mexican--if you have fresh, top quality ingredients and a chef with a bit of pizzazz, it&#39;s nearly impossible to go from &#39;Ole!&#39; to &#39;uno mas cerveza, andale, andale...pa-tooey!&#39; (See my review for &#39;Elote&#39; in Sedona, for what Mexican food SHOULD be.)

Such was my experience here. The place itself is inviting--nice patio, perky waitstaff, tasty chips and salsa.  

But, instead of great South of The Border cuisine, the food simply goes south. 

The steak in the tacos seemed to be shorn from a new breed of bovine--the Chewy Gristle--and the tortillas they were wrapped in seemed straight off the shelf of the nearest supermercado.  Rather like a thin Mexican Frisbee--cold, hard, and muy, muy bland.

Nachos? I would like to say that they&#39;re a step above what you&#39;d get at a Friday&#39;s or a Chili&#39;s, but sadly, I cannot. Whole lotta &#39;meh.&#39;

Where&#39;s the spice, the zing, the fresh just-picked-it-out-of-the-garden-knockin&#39;-on-your-taste-buds kinda &#39;wow!&#39; we want in our Mexican? Somewhere else, apparently.

I read in someone else&#39;s review of this place that there is an actual Sergio, and he&#39;s a very nice guy. I&#39;m sure he is, and I wish him all the best in his cantina. But Serge: if you want to be more than just a memory in the Geneva Culinary Consciousness, I suggest 86&#39;ing the canned ingredients, and going for a giant helping of &#39;Fresh.&#39;

We walked in and were seated at the bar.  We showed the server our Groupon, and proceeded to order.  The Groupon said that we had the choice of nachos of quesadillas.  We opted for the nachos.  We told the server, and she said that they only came with cheese with the Groupon - yet the regular menu had it with chicken and/or steak.  So seriously people?  You are going to take meat off nachos just because we have a Groupon?  That is not cool.  Once the nachos came, the toppings were sparse.  The cheese was not even melted, and the ingredient that they had most of was lettuce.  Not good.  How do you mess up nachos?  

Our Groupon also came with 2 house margaritas with &#34;premium&#34; tequila.  These were the weakest margaritas I have ever had, and the tequila did not taste very premium.  They looked good, but were very disappointing.  They come out of a slurpie type machine.  Not very authentic, as someone else posted here.  

We then ordered the grande taco platter (2 steak and 2 carnitas tacos) and the coconut shrimp.  The steak was pretty good, but the carnitas were just so-so.  They were extremely greasy and salty.  Also, they looked like ham!  The server said that it was because they only use salt and fat to cook them in .  Even though she said it was pork butt - seems like ham to me!  Yuck.  

The coconut shrimp was pretty good but not very generous.  My wife was slightly grossed out because she hates refried beans, and her plate very clearly started with refried beans on it that had been wiped off (but not completely) and replaced with black beans.  Pretty gross.  Our bill would have been around $52 had we not had the Groupon.  I would have been even more disappointed if I spent that amount of money at this place.

The enchiladas verdes were lackluster and treated way too heavily.  Not good.

The chips and salsa were very good, however!",16/01/12,24,2,1,0,-1,-0.7862,0.332,1.779,2.8890000000000002,No,180
sergios-cantina-geneva,Amy V.,lIX2eJmJD2KKEGSmVKSSKg,jab99D8aA4z_15P5f48nQw,Love going here! Chip and salsa are to die for! Their margarita with sangria in it is quite possibly the best margarita I&#39;ve ever had. Chicken enchilladas is my &#34;go to&#34; item on the menu...amazing! Affordable prices too. always coupons online.,31/05/13,32,5,1,1,-4,0.7001999999999999,0.9339999999999999,0.411,4.655,YES,254
