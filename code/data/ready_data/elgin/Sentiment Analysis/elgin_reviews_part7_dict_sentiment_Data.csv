They paid attention to little details like water carafe on the table, sauces readily available on the table and the wait staff was nice, courteous and helpful.  I&#39;m not sure why people are complaining about the food cart, which is not at all loud and is pretty typical for Asian restaurants to use.  After reading some of the reviews, I was preparing myself for a loud noise and I barely noticed.

The food was really good.  We started with chicken wings which was very tasty, had the right amount of crispiness, perfect touch of salt and good sauce to accompany the wings.  I wanted another order immediately but had to save my appetite for the entree.  I also ordered Vietnamese coffee - usually served already made.  This place goes the extra mile with again, attention to detail.  They gave me one cup with full of ice and another cup where the coffee was dripping down inside the cup so it&#39;s freshly brewed coffee.  On the second cup, there was cream on the bottom.  Once the coffee finishes dripping to the bottom of the cup, you have to swirl around the coffee with the cream to mix it together and then transfer the mixed item to the other cup with the ice.  It was delish!  I love Vietnamese coffee and this did not disappoint.

Onward with the entree, we both had vietnamese noodle soup.  It is very flavorful and taste amazing, but it didn&#39;t seem like a traditional pho that we eat at the Vietnamese restaurant.  Regardless, we really enjoyed the noodle soup and would definitely be back to try other items as well.  I thought the price was very reasonable.  Please give them a try.  It&#39;s hard to find a good Vietnamese restaurant in this area so I&#39;m ecstatic that we have a good one!",28/07/16,197,5,3,5,72,7.0021,4.253,0.293,16.456,No,1805

The not good:  Very excited to try the Pho.  There are no good Pho places in the burbs.  We ordered the Seafood &amp; Beef.  Pho came out hot!  All the trimmings beautiful, plentiful and fresh!  I tasted the broth...stop...like a Korean soap opera...stop...come in for a close-up shot to my eyes...I tried to smile but the tears welled up and slowly rolled down my cheeks, diving into the broth below...no expression--just tears.  Not feeling that?  How about the Olympics, then.  You watch the lone competitor from the smallest country do a routine and they need to end it with a very big move.  They have a disaster.  You wince.  You cry inside.  They carry the country&#39;s hope on their tiny, tired shoulders.  Why?!?  Your lip quivers.  

Please Pho An, please.  Have the decency to arrange for a Vietnamese chef to taste your broth.  The broth is anything but Pho broth.  Why can&#39;t I give it 2 stars, huh?  Because the Pho broth must be respected.  Period.  The end.

We were seated across from an Asian family and my dining companion momentarily locked eyes with the father.

As for the food, you will not be happy if you walk in with an expectation that you will get authentic Vietnamese food. For example, they do not serve tripe and meatball for the pho. So if you&#39;re a fan of those things, you&#39;re out of luck. I normally get only the rare meat, brisket, and tendons anyway so I was fine with the choices. I liked the broth, it is less greasy and still has good flavor. 

The spring rolls, although similar, wasn&#39;t what I normally see at other Vietnamese restaurants. There&#39;s more vegetable, which I liked. I did not like the sauce very much though, there was too much peanut butter. I mixed the sauce with sriracha and hoisin.

I understand this is a new business so I will be more lenient with my review as they are probably still working out the kinks. 

What we ate:
1. Spring Rolls - Taste and dipping sauces were good. They did have less meat in them than other places.
2. Shrimp &amp; Avocado Rolls - First time trying these, but they were delicious!
3. Bulgogi Bahn Mi - Really disappointed here, the baguette was soft and had no crunch. I honestly did not even finish half and the pate tasted weird.

If you are looking for Vietnamese food that has been modified for the American palette, you might enjoy this place. I cant take a Vietnamese restaurant seriously if they do not offer the standard bahn mi sandwiches: grilled pork, or one using specific deli meats.

I was so excited to see this place when after my visit to Bottle and Bottega!  My boyfriend and I were super hungry and I was battling a migraine that was lasting for days, so Pho was the answer for me. We ordered the wings as an appetizer. There were for small wings for $4, but the flavor was incredible. I ordered the Pho which was  also amazing. The portion was huge and it left me with two more meals worth of leftovers.

That was not the case for me.  It was pretty empty during the lunch hour other than the two Asian ladies chatting in the corner of the restaurant.  Me and my sister each ordered spring roles and pho which took approximately 15 minutes to be served.  When the food arrived, I tasted broth first to find that it tasted incredibly salty.  Usually pho broth is supposed to taste mildly strong and refreshing, this restaurant served me salted water in a bowl.  My sister got a stomach ache and couldn&#39;t even finish the food while I was wondering how the hell this restaurant got rated so high on yelp.

Spring roles - 2

pho-an-heights-arlington-heights,Lena M.,555vYbOC9Lxi3Wlo9Uwzcg,ggQOpC98Hs7FYjySf5Shdw,"First off - this place is NOT authentic Vietnamese. The menu is a mix of Korean and a translated (aka fusion) form of Vietnamese food. 

My niece and I were heading to the yummy Mexican place around the corner and instead we decided to give this place a try. We both have eaten authentic Vietnamese all our lives. Argyle isn&#39;t just a place to visit, it&#39;s where we go for real food when we don&#39;t want to cook ourselves. We figured if this place makes the cut, there&#39;s going to be $ saved on gas and we gain back 2 hours from the drive. 

We ordered spring rolls and the combination pho. The pho was served almost immediately brought to our table on a wheeled cart (? What&#39;s with the cart?) with the accompaniments. At first sniff of the broth it just didn&#39;t smell right. It sorta smelled like someone&#39;s laundry water with a hint of beef. Not the usual rich beef smell with cinnamon, star anise, and other spices that linger with regular pho from Vietnamese restaurants. 

Well - here goes - I wanted to try it without the accompaniments to get a real fresh taste. Chopsticks in, stir, and look. 

*Noodles - a decent serving
*Rare beef - missing. There was NO red, pink, or even near that color beef found. 
*Beef Slices - 3 small pieces, overcooked and chewy. Tasted weird. Not beefy taste, just a not good taste. 
*Tendon - the yummy melt in your mouth goodness - one teeny tiny piece! Maybe it all melted? If you don&#39;t know what tendon looks like, you would have missed the piece. 
*Beef brisket - there were a small amount of  shreds of gray stuff so I&#39;m going to think that&#39;s it. It filled my spoon &amp; that&#39;s it. 
*Broth - NASTY smelling and OMG!!! Salty salty SALTY! My niece pointed out my bright red ears and cheeks after 3 spoonfuls of the broth. 

That&#39;s all I could take. I called the waiter who was very nice. He was apologetic, offered to add hot water to it to dilute the saltiness, and when I declined he took it away. Came back and said they had a busy lunch service and the broth was probably concentrated from being low. Ummm... This was at 6:00. How did they not pay attention to their broth since lunch at 12-1? Isn&#39;t that the big part of their restaurant? 

Our meal was &#34;comp&#34;  because my niece didn&#39;t want to have a sodium overdose either and didn&#39;t eat hers. 

OH! We never got our spring rolls so I can&#39;t review that. We left and went back to our original plan - table side prepared guacamole.  

Summary: 
If you like salty, fake, funky smelling Vietnamese food - enjoy this place. It has exactly what you want then. 

Why 2 stars and not one? Because the waiter was nice &amp; apologetic. 

I&#39;m still in search of good pho in this area.",15/08/16,321,2,1,3,-22,2.937,3.2809999999999997,2.7220000000000004,36.998,No,2741

The spring roll, better known as a Vietnamese fresh roll or summer roll on other menus, was well balanced with shrimp, rice noodles and thickly sliced bell peppers that added a unique flavor for these standard rolls.  The rice paper was the right thickness with no excessive over wrap.  It is served with a homemade sesame and peanut sauce that I enjoyed precisely because it didn&#39;t have a strong peanut butter taste.  

Everything about the pho seemed right to me.  I&#39;m not a pho expert but the sliced beef comes in the steaming bowl not fully cooked, which is correct.  There weren&#39;t as many fresh herbs as traditionally served but this is normal to keep costs down.  The broth smelled wonderfully of cloves and star anise.  I&#39;m not sure if the broth was as clear as is normally desired by pho experts but I had no complaints and enjoyed the meal.

pho-an-heights-arlington-heights,Christina C.,HLRXtCQ2wyBUtHHWVD2XeQ,zBFaBkEfTe72la7SkttPQQ,"Really 3.75 stars.  First, this place is adorable.  I felt like I was in a k-drama while there.  The coffee house music, the beverage station - it was all very cute and appeared very clean.  The service was very friendly, although a little slow getting the check which was not a big deal.  The Korean food (galbi?) we had was very good, the Vietnamese coffee was excellent and I appreciate that they used the traditional strainer and allowed me to mix everything.  The spring rolls were decent, although appeared to be more of a hybrid than a traditional Vietnamese spring roll and peanut sauce.  The chicken wings were decent.  That brings me to the pho... Sigh. I am still lamenting the demise of my beloved Viet House and searching for a replacement and while I will definitely come here again for coffee, atmosphere and Korean food, the pho just didn&#39;t do much for me.  The broth was very anisey, and didn&#39;t have much depth.  The rice noodles were slightly overcooked and the meat (I had pho tai) was not very generous.  That said, it was a decent sized bowl and they brought a beautiful garnish plate out to accompany it.  Were I dying for a bowl of pho and happened to be nearby, I would probably order again, but in terms of finding the place I need for my weekly pho fix, this just wasn&#39;t it.  Will definitely try again, but probably not for pho.",10/11/16,149,4,2,4,24,3.8242,2.228,0.28400000000000003,13.487,No,1366

Ordered spring rolls and chicken wings as an appetizer. The wings were good, very flavorful. My husband really enjoyed them. The spring rolls were pretty good and the peanut sauce was good.

Got the sliced beef pho and my husband got a bowl of the big bowl pho. The broth was decent and the sliced beef was tender. A great alternative for pho that&#39;s close by if you don&#39;t want to drive far.

Restaurant is Korean owned so many Korean dishes that we will try next time. It&#39;s spacious on the inside and kid friendly. Also love that they leave extra water on the table so you can just pour yourself more. Overall great experience and we will be back!",09/08/16,90,5,2,5,37,4.8885000000000005,2.97,0.13,10.901,No,744

Everything else was perfect.  Prices are beyond reasonable so you can really afford to try a  few things on the menu.  We had the edamame and chicken wings to start.  Both of which were great.  I had the bibimbop as an entree which was a super fresh and tasty beef dish.  For desert, we tried one of each @ $3 per.   Both were fantastic, esp the green tea ice cream.

The slices of jalape̱o were extremely hot, so be careful! A few more pieces of brisket would be nice but you can ask for more for an extra $2 if you wish. Others in my group had the spicy pork sandwich and the seafood with ramen. They were very pleased with their entrees as well. The waiter was a young man, very polite and efficient.

pho-an-heights-arlington-heights,Restaurant Vigilant E.,wqWJzo62RE8DmSYqFKmutg,M9Y1m9vDU9Tbo_-NiaAQlw,"Pho An opened in downtown AH a few months back, replacing some Tapas restaurant. The location is good - on Dutton which is essentially smack in the middle of downtown. We went on a Tuesday night as soon as it opened and were the only people there. I got the sense that the place is family run - the service was very friendly and you could tell they wanted to do a good job. I will tell you for two non-alcoholic drinks and appetizer and two entrees it was $25 which I thought was very reasonable.

The interior is pretty minimalist - the waiter brought your standard glasses of whatever, but with a very nice flip top lid bottle full of chilled water - I thought this was a nice touch. 

I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee which came with the glass topping dripper and sweetened condensed milk that you stirred and poured over ice. Very authentic, and it wasn&#39;t loaded with Tasters Choice either...no doubt it was the Vietnamese coffee itself, which I have ordered online before. I was very impressed.

The menu is pretty small. They have half a dozen Pho bowls, half a dozen appetizers, two Banh mi types and a few other odds and ends. We started with the scallion pancake....it was pretty standard - rice flour and scallion fried up and served with sauce. It was adequate for what it was and at $4.00 I wasn&#39;t complaining.

I ordered Vietnamese fried noodles with pork, carrot and mung beans...it was excellent and the portion was quite generous - again, at $9 or $10 bucks, I was happy with the size and such. My friend ordered Korean Seafood Ramen which was about the same price and had squid, shrimp and mussels. It was served in a giant bowl and the steam coming off of it clearly indicated the broth was near boiling.

On the table, you had your standard bottle of siriachi, but also a jar of clearly homemade red chili puree which was excellent.

The prices couldn&#39;t be beat and the food was excellent. Service was likewise good and the interior was spotless and on trend...it was a bit devoid of life (no music, just big empty grey room which reminded me of a chipotle for some reason - only nicer of course).

Downside? Well, I feel like they are nit-picky things and really weren&#39;t important. The place is primarily Vietnamese, but they throw Korean elements into some of their stuff - like the banh mi and such....I don&#39;t know, maybe that works...Vietnam and Korea are like 4,000 miles from each other though - you wouldn&#39;t have a Swedish/Italian fusion restaurant would you? But I will say, the food was excellent, so I am just being a pain here I guess. Rather than delivering food on a tray or by hand, the servers used a giant cart with wheels off of a Roman Chariot (perhaps I exaggerate)...but the donkey cart made a TON of noise when it was hauling its cargo...and when it came out with just the single scallion pancake in a thunderous cacophony, it seemed a bit ridiculous....now, it soon became clear to me though - the cart makes perfect sense when bringing out giant bowls of Pho or Ramen that has been heated inside of a lava tube....it wasn&#39;t annoying at all, just a little odd...

This is a great casual restaurant, the price is right, the food is excellent, the service is good....I&#39;m sold. Not sure as I would go there for a first date or something (as it is quite casual), but it checked off pretty much all the boxes.

The 2 stars however, is for service based on 2 visits over the last month. During my first visit we were barely waited on once the food arrived and at no point did the server feel the need to check on our empty drinks. I tried to flag her down but she was standing by another server chatting. Keep in mind there was maybe 1 other patron in the place so it shouldn&#39;t have been that difficult to check on us. After I literally shouted, &#34;excuse me&#34;, I got a dirty look and she finally came over. My second visit was last night, a Sunday. We walked in at 7:51pm. They close at 8:30pm so one would think 39 minutes prior to closing is still sufficient time to eat but the server was adamant that they were closing in &#34;30 minutes&#34; and basically tried to get us to leave. My friend being the nice one that she is, told her we were just going to get a few appetizers and said, &#34;is that ok?&#34;  The server replied, &#34;if you think you can eat in 30 minutes&#34;. Seriously??? You don&#39;t try to dissuade customers from dining because you&#39;re worried about closing time. We still decided to eat there but I just can&#39;t get over the rude service.

We were brought freshly made bread which was cut into thin slices. Not bad.

For an appetizer, we had oysters in a sort of italian herb crust. It was good, but bigger oysters in the shells would&#39;ve justified the price.

For dinner, I had their half-baked chicken with roasted potatoes. It was good and filling. The potatoes could&#39;ve used a little more love, but nothing to quibble over.

On to dessert. We had two....the tiramisu and a Nutella chocolate cake on special that night, if I&#39;m not mistaken. 

I didn&#39;t try the Nutella cake, but was told it was good. The tiramisu could&#39;ve used more coffee-flavor and/or more chocolate flavor, but was fine overall.

The baby panzerott&#39; were delicious,  5 nice sized portions.  The grilled octopus was tender and gorgeous,  served atop broccoli rabb and beans.  My wife grabbed the huge prawn so I tackled the cuttlefish and calamari. Wonderful.

When you walk in it is unexpectedly small, but the owners optimized the space they had with the dining tables and the bar- as we go to sit down our server, Marion, comes up to us in the first two minutes and introduces himself, we order some drinks and start to scroll through the menu. We immediately notice that the menu is based on Italian fare from Puglia, as Vito and his family are from Bari, this was a real surprise considering you don&#39;t typically see restaurants specific to that area! We ordered the meat and cheese platter and the fried calamari as appetizers, and the orecchiette con ossa e bracciole for our entree that we shared. The only reason I&#39;m giving this 4 stars out of 5 is due to the fact that the calamari was really bland- no taste at all- and the drinks we ordered were over priced ($10 for a Titos and water) - when it came to our entree however- it was food literally to die for. I have worked in a million Italian restaurants, my family is Italian- I have eaten Italian food my whole life, here and there and everywhere- but this Bracciole was hands down the best I&#39;ve ever had. The best. It was simple, extremely tender and the flavors were just excellent. Thankfully no raisins or pine nuts (I hate all of that stuff jammed in a bracciole)  I would go back there specifically for that meal and likely will. Our server was fantastic, I really enjoyed the atmosphere- all in all we were were very pleased.

My vegan ravioli dish was wonderful and the sauce creamy and rich.  And Thursday night is free dessert night!

They ran out of pepperoni.  Who ever heard of a pizza place running out of pepperoni.  But, once they realized it they called us back to see if we wanted to substitute with something else.  No problem - Canadian bacon is a fine substitute!

In one such mall, on Algonquin Road, you&#39;ll find Nero&#39;s Pizza and Pub , a full menu restaurant and bar, open from 11AM daily.

On the Monday nite following Superbowl, we expected to find the joint deserted, but the bar was busy with the local regulars, and the restaurant had several tables taken as well.

Our waitress was friendly and helpful.

My guest went with an Italian Beef/Sausage combo (2nd foto below), accompanied by fries and slaw.   It was excellent.   I went with the thin crust pizza, sausage and pepperoni, also excellent.   There was a slight char on the crust, which didn&#39;t put me off.

If you&#39;re looking for a bar scene?  This might be a good place, however that&#39;s not my thing so I could be wrong. I don&#39;t think they take their restaurant side of business very seriously.

Pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, and bacon. Not that chewy undercooked bacon either. Perfectly crunchy crispy bacon. The other I tried was the Mexican pizza. It was delicious. I will warn you though.

neros-pizza-and-pub-algonquin,Dorothy P.,#NAME?,zEuaM6tgrPvrP0i3AJu37Q,"Pizza always sounds like a good idea to me, and when the craving grabs hold, it usually doesn&#39;t let go until I satisfy it.  This time, when I heard the pizza call, the hubs and I decided to give Nero&#39;s a try.  Seeing as I was already  in pajamas (at 5 in the afternoon, thank you very much), my hungrier half decided he could swing by and pick up a carryout order on his way home from work.

For about $31, we got a large (18&#34;) 1 topping thin crust pizza, a huge order of fries and an order of chicken wings (hey, don&#39;t judge; we like a lot of leftovers).  Everything was ready to go in 20 mins, and it was all piping hot when we opened it all up.  

I thought it was sort of weird that the chicken wings came naked, with the wing sauce on the side, but it made for a crispier chicken wing that was much appreciated.  The sauce was standard wing sauce, although it did have a nice spiciness and vinegar kick to it, which was much appreciated.

The fries were nice &amp; hot, a good mixture of soggy and crispy ones to accommodate varying tastes in french fry crispness (this is a good thing in our house, since I tend to pick out all the mushy ones and eat them first, while the husband prefers the crunch of a crispy fry.).  This order of fries definitely kept the peace in the house.

The pizza was decent.  While it&#39;s not a &#34;choir of angels&#34; good type pizza, it wasn&#39;t greasy, the toppings were ample, and it was well cooked (crust was crispy without being overcooked).  The squares are huge, so unless you&#39;re a 13 year old boy or a linebacker, I&#39;d start loading up your plate modestly and go back for seconds.

While I don&#39;t have much experience with the restaurant&#39;s patrons, I will have to say that I feel like we got a decent meal (or 5) at a price that&#39;s good enough to keep Nero&#39;s on the short list of local pizza places that we will go back to again.",10/01/13,230,3,2,5,23,6.0652,1.874,0.111,11.015,No,1916

I just got back from there (with another sports team).  We pre-ordered our pizzas about 20 minutes before we arrived to ensure we didn&#39;t have to wait too long with a bunch of hungry 10 year olds.  Well, the person taking the phone orders apparently forgot to put our pre-order in.  Oops!  Understandable, though, because as it turns out, she was also the only waitress on duty tonight.  I felt very sorry for her--and it was not her fault that the service was slow because they were so short-handed.  I&#39;d say she did an amazing job under the circumstances.  But it&#39;s just poor management to have only one server on duty by herself and making her take phone orders, too.   On the night of a Blackhawks game when they were pretty busy. 

We waited about 40 minutes for crappy, overpriced pizza that was barely even melted.  Seriously--no browning of the cheese or crust at all!  The sauce tastes canned and very heavy on the oregano.  The cheese was pretty flavorless.  The crust was soggy.  I think they rushed the pizza because we had been waiting so long.  I would have rather they had just waited a few minutes and given us some properly cooked pizzas.   Very disappointing.

If this had been my first time at Nero&#39;s having lackluster food and slow service, I wouldn&#39;t be writing this review.  But I have given them at least five chances and my opinion remains the same.  

I will say one positive thing--their chicken strips ARE indeed very good.

No big deal, since the wife usually gets wraps (around $10), and I got a pizza, with plans on getting a bigger one and taking home leftovers. 

The wife got a ranch chicken wrap with sweet potato fries. The fries were AMAZING. Crinkle cut, which I&#39;ve never seen for sweet potato fries. The only bad part about her meal was when I went to take a bit of her wrap....and bit into a chicken bone. Pretty big too, probably 1.5&#34;. The waitress was very understanding, took the wrap off of our bill, along with the restaurant.com gimmick, even though with taking the wrap off it put us under the $22.50.

As for the pizza I had, I would say it was OK at best. The toppings were fresh, but the crust was not crispy at all. It seemed like they didn&#39;t cook it long enough, and only the outsides got crispy.

They have a large menu with lots of different appetizers, sandwiches and pizza. The sweet potato fries are my fav, however I really wish they would give you more for the price you pay. They have an all you can eat fish fry on fridays which is not a bad price. I&#39;ve ordered the cod basket a few times and the fish isnt too bad, although the batter is a little too thick for my liking. Their sandwiches are good, not spectacular, but the portions are pretty good. I&#39;ve lived in the chicago area my whole life so I had to give their chicago style pizza a try to see if it lives up to Lou&#39;s or Gino&#39;s. My verdict, meh.The sauce wasn&#39;t quite right and the crust was a little too soft. The price was comparable to others. Not gonna order it again tho. Their regular pizza is good but a little pricey for what you get. 

I do have to warn you about their website. The menu items on the website don&#39;t always come with what they say they do. I think whoever created the website never updated it and part of the menu has been &#34;under construction&#34; for almost a year now wtf?! So always ask what comes with your food items when you order so as to not be disappointed like I was. Also, the hours on the website are for the pub itself, not for delivery and I think those are even incorrect. Me and my friends tried to order pizza at 10:30pm on a Friday night and they said the kitchen was closed..wtf?!! What delivery pizza place isn&#39;t open past 10:30 on a FRIDAY night?

The crowd was very rowdy and it seemed to be a bunch of college kids out there to drink. I waited at the bar for 15 minutes before a bartender even acknowledged my presence. After, I got a beer. I went out on the patio to get out of the loud environment indoors and it was no different out there except that I was walking into a cloud of cigarette smoke. This definitely did not comply with the law that tells an establishment that it&#39;s smokers must remain 15 feet from the door. When I went back inside to hear the band start up. Many of the crowd members were very intoxicated. I went back to the bar to order a mixed drink and the drink was ridiculously strong and not mixed properly.

I can&#39;t quite sense the same taste out of the pizza that I used to, the crust is now different.  It&#39;s still good, but not what I fell in love with.  Going to try the other crust options to see if it&#39;s closer to what it used to be.

Otherwise the place has gotten nicer, they&#39;ve expanded and redone the bar area and added more TVs to watch the games on.  They have a bags game setup on the patio.

They also are very good with accommodating large groups of people, our neighborhood used to have monthly outings here in the past and they never batted an eye about us calling ahead.

Nice atmosphere but pretty EMPTY for a Friday night around 7pm-ish.  Nevertheless, it took them 10 mins to finally acknowledge we were seated.  One waitress moved from table to table socializing.  Since we didn&#39;t know who our waitress was going to be, it was beginning to get ridiculous as we felt completely ignored.  Finally, another waitress came up to us &amp; said, &#34;Has anyone helped you yet?&#34;  After telling her we had not been attended to, she simply said, &#34;Ok, what can I start you off to drink?&#34;  ---SIDE NOTE: Maybe I am old fashioned, but WHAT HAPPENED TO APOLOGIZING FOR IGNORING US FOR THE LAST 10 MINS?---  So, when we got our drinks we went ahead &amp; ordered our food.  The food came in a reasonable amount of time.  Here is where I owe them A LOT of credit, THE FOOD WAS FANTASTIC!!!  The fries were just perfect; slightly crunchy but soft in the inside, not overly cooked or overly salted.  The chicken strips were real chicken &amp; not processed.  They were also deep fried in the most amazing batter.  My wife&#39;s taco salad was really good, despite not having salsa.  The pizza was good for a thin crust.  And lastly, the fish fry (which was ALL YOU CAN EAT) was probably the best I&#39;ve EVER had &amp; I have eaten at quite a few places.  Ok, back to the service &amp; back to being completely ignored.  Nobody came by our table to offer us refills, to get more tartar sauce, to give me more fish for what seemed like forever.  After finally flagging down our waitress, I asked her for some salsa for my wife&#39;s taco salad &amp; before I can ask for anything else, the waitress is already starting to walk away.  So, I said, &#34;Excuse me!  I wasn&#39;t finished.&#34;  She says, &#34;Oh.  What else did you need?&#34;  ---SIDE NOTE: Once again, what happened to people apologizing when their behavior isn&#39;t acceptable?---  So I finished telling her, &#34;My son needs a refill.  I would like more fish &amp; I need more tartar sauce (for the small amount of fish I hadn&#39;t finished yet).&#34;  She quickly skampered away &amp; another 10 minutes goes by.  When she finally came back with salsa, a new cup of pop for my son, she said to me, &#34;Your tartar sauce will come up when your fish is ready.&#34;  I said, &#34;So I can&#39;t get more tartar sauce for the remaining fish I have?&#34;  Finally, she said, &#34;Oh sorry!  I didn&#39;t realize you still had more fish left.  Let me get that for you.&#34;  She comes back to the table with the tartar sauce reasonably quick.  I say to her, &#34;When the fish is finished, could you also bring a small cup of ranch (which I use for my fries)?&#34;  All seemed ok when I got my refill of fish &amp; my medicine cup size of ranch dressing.  After we were done eating, I had to flag down our waitress again.  We were now the only people in the main dining area (it was maybe 8:20pm-ish) &amp; nobody seemed to be interested in attending to us.  We eventually got our check and noted a $0.45 charge for ranch.  Ok, here&#39;s the deal...lol  I wasn&#39;t asking for a bottle of ranch.  This was a restaurant, couldn&#39;t they spare the small ranch dressing for a large dinner order for 6 people?  I mean, I can see if I was by myself and ordered 1 thing.  Was this charge necessary in preventing their establishment from going under?  ---SIDE NOTE: I would have gladly paid $0.45 for ranch if the service was excellent.  It&#39;s the principle of it!---  Since I was already frustrated in their service, the small charge for the ranch put me over the top.    Since my waitress was nowhere to be found, I flagged down a busboy &amp; requested for the manager.  When the manager came, I explained the whole night to her in &#34;cliff-notes&#34; fashion.  She immediately apologized &amp; blamed it on being really busy (Friday fish fry was very popular).  ---SIDE NOTE: THE PLACE WAS EMPTY FOR A FRIDAY NIGHT!!!---   I wasn&#39;t going to argue with her.  I just wanted her to do what was fair regarding their lack of attention.  The manager then said, &#34;We&#39;ll take off the charge for the ranch (which was one of my many issues) and we&#39;ll give you a coupon.&#34;  REALLY, A COUPON???  Why should I bring my family back for this treatment when there are hundreds of other restaurants I could choose from?  Instead of blurting out my true frustrations, I bit my lip &amp; said, &#34;If you feel that is the right thing to do to compensate us for our troubles, here is my credit card &amp; charge what you feel is fair.&#34;  Puzzled, she walked away with my credit card, discounted our bill by $5 and apologized one last time.  I signed the bill &amp; left.  Truth be told, if I had managed a restaurant &amp; a patron had that many complaints, what harm is losing $50 if the patrons leave feeling appreciated?  Especially that they had picked my restaurant for their celebrations.  In my opinion there&#39;s no question, it would have been on the house; but that&#39;s just me.  I&#39;m not asking for a handout, just what is deemed fair.

Too bad this place isn&#39;t closer to home because I would definitely come back often--not just for the food, but for the extremely welcoming service.

We showed up for a late dinner around 9:15 PM on a Friday night.  We were greeted warmly &amp; seated quickly.

We looked over our menus and I decided to order the bi bim naeng myun and an order of their cod fish casserole.

The bi bim naeng myun was just ok, not as good as some of the other places that I&#39;ve fallen in love with in Honolulu and NorCal.

The cod fish casserole was very flavorful and definitely hits the spot for a cold, Chicago night.

I really liked the kimchee here.  Very flavorful and just the perfect amount of sour.

The food would be about 3.5-4 stars, but the service is deserving of 10 stars.  They are very accommodating and genuine.  Very great people!

We even got a free Klondike bar for dessert.  One for each of us.

When I asked for a glass of water, the owner came back with a cold bottled water at no charge.  This place is definitely worth visiting.",07/11/16,121,5,2,5,25,4.5046,3.395,0.33299999999999996,11.272,No,1063

Odd ambiance because the interior has eclectic (some home/handmade) decor, room for improvement in the ventilation area, and opportunity to dine with one Marilyn Monroe (as we did, since her portrait hung aside our booth).  

Come for the fresh flavors and food! Everything was flavorful and tasty. I&#39;m a huge fan of the chap chae, bibimbop, and bulgogi. The pre-meal tiny side dishes (the proper name for it escapes me) were ordinary, so don&#39;t fill up.

The owner has apparently had the business for 10 years and is an arts and crafts type person.  You can tell from the eclectic artsy collections that decorate the place, some of which he crafted himself.  They have classical music playing in the background here also.  The food though is definitely Korean and still the main draw as it should be, and it was very good, satisfying, and flavorful.  Our server was also very polite, efficient, and friendly as well.

- chap chae
- so myun (a soup with thin noodles)
- dak bokum (pan fried spicy chicken)

Grilled meat dishes can be cooked by the kitchen (as we preferred) or at the table grill as the customer prefers.  All of the hot dishes were piping hot, fresh, and delicious.

It&#39;s like a large room made up of secret booths that could use a paint job with artistic statues and it&#39;s absolutely phenomenal. I love it. 

I&#39;m vegetarian and they had about three true veggie options but a lot of the dishes you can ask for no meat and they happily help out. One of the options include a veggie BBq dish. 

Was given a bowl of cashews for an appetizer for free. My favorite nut of all time! 

I had the tofu appetizer and bi bim bop (sans beef) and it was great! Took the appetizer tasted like it had sesame oil and garlic on it which was delicious.

I loved grilling my own veggies on the grill in The middle of our table. We also got free Klondike bars for dessert.

Drinks are cheap. Smaller selection but totally adequate. A glass of wine was $4.50 and a large 650 ML beer was $6.50. Get the OB beer, it&#39;s very smooth with a hint of German hops so it kind of reminded me of a Hefeweizen Pilsner mix. 

I&#39;ve never met nicer people in my entire life. I will be sure to come back here again. Even though I live in the city, I will drive out here to go to this place.",30/03/16,149,5,2,5,45,7.091800000000001,4.8549999999999995,0.311,14.834,No,1227

A friend said that I had to try Bi Bim Bop.  Ok, I like saying it so it must taste good. 

We tried this local place based on good reviews from other Yelpers and we were not disappointed. 

Our waiter was so helpful.  We told him it was our first time having Bi Bim Bop.   He explained all the ingredients.  He explained the best way to eat it.  He brought 6 side dishes to accompany the Bi Bim Bop.  Not to put in it but to have before and during the main meal.   A nice clear beef broth with fresh green onions on top was included as well as barley tea.

I liked how hot the Bi Bim Bop stayed in the heated stone bowl.   The chili sauce that I put on the Bi Bim Bop (still love saying it) was delicious - a bit hot and a tiny bit sweet.

The waiter provided attentive service without overdoing it.  And the manager treated us to ice cream for dessert.  Now that is a sweet deal.  

The quality and quantity of food was very fair. 

The ambience and decor are a bit funky/eclectic but we just rolled with it and enjoyed a whole new experience and cuisine.",12/02/16,134,4,2,5,44,7.3794,4.253,0.0,13.747,No,1110

Service was also great. And the extras... what a pleasant surprise. We had asked for water. The waiter brought bottled water for the adults and boxed juices for the kids.

Service:  If one have been to a number of Korean spots, often times, you will have these &#34;I hate life&#34; waitresses/servers.  They may get the job done, but sometimes, this pissy attitude can kill one&#39;s appetite/vibe.  You won&#39;t find that here.  Even if you&#39;re not Korean (Yes I said it, I&#39;m being real here), the sincerity and service at Chungkiwa is excellent.  Language barrier aside, the two guys working here are fantastic!

Food:  That raw beef dish was so bombdizzle (I&#39;m an adventurous eater while my fiancee isn&#39;t) that my Fifi actually ended up eating half of it.

That GALBI!!! dang, soo good, marbly-great.  Better portion that most places to boot!

First of all, they&#39;re open until 10pm on Sundays.  Not many places are and we really only have Sunday nights free.

Next, they go out of their way to accommodate their customers.  We showed up around 8pm with no reservation, not realizing that it was going to be full on a Sunday night.  After agreeing to a 25 minute wait (not bad), we were told a few minutes later that the wait would be longer, and we were asked if it would be OK if we were seated in the party room.  We agreed and were seated immediately.

The menu is gigantic.  We were overwhelmed with choices that&#39;s a very good thing!  We ended up ordering the Korean Special for 2.  It ended up being enough food for 4 people and a tremendous value.  Additionally, literally everything was delicious!  It came with 6 appetizers, a huge bowl of soup, and a massive pile of meat and seafood.  We ended up taking half of it home.

The service was fantastic too.  Our server was really friendly and checked in on us frequently.  He even showed us how Korean people eat their BBQ with lettuce leaves and rice and sauce, which we were not aware of.  We got dinner AND some cultural education!  The manager and head chef even checked on us a couple times.  They were all cool and friendly.

The drink menu is huge too, and I had Korean shoju for the first time.  It wasn&#39;t much different than the Japanese shochu I like to drink, and it paired extremely well with the food.

I&#39;m a huge fan of Korean food but just realized all of the Korean bbq places I&#39;ve been to (even living right next to Korea town in Dallas) paled in comparison to Chungkiwa.  First, the decor.  Yes, it is very odd and eclectic.  The booth we sat at had a naked female statue, a moose coat hanger and a picture of a baby scratching it&#39;s ass.  Across from us was a bronze statue of a man decapitating another man with what appeared to be an axe.  Oh yeah, he was also naked.  Okay, but I&#39;m not here to eat the decoration.  Stuff like that really doesn&#39;t hinder a good dining experience.  But, the service which does play a role in how I truly feel about a restaurant was EXQUISITE! From the moment we walked in, my date and I were greeted by the most genuine, humble and attentive waiter and owner.  So please tip well if you receive the same exceptional attention during your eating experience.

We ordered korean dumplings, bulgogi, pork belly and split a bottle of soju for about  75 bucks.  It was a lot more expensive compared to the other places that yelp pulled up but so worth the money! The beef bulgogi wasn&#39;t stained dark brown like I&#39;ve seen so many times, but bright red and looked actually like beef, surrounded by a light marinade.  The result was that it was easily the best bulgogi I&#39;ve ever had.  Apparently we ordered a pound, but it felt less because it was so delicate, light and tender.  I also appreciated that the meat plates came out with raw vegetables so you could throw them on the hot grill.  The pork belly was as delicious as it sounds, simple, no seasoning but turning into something magical once you cook it and then dip it in the sesame oil and salt and pepper mixture.  All of the banchans and rice were perfect.  Most of the banchans were recently made.  This place is the true definition of quality is way better than quantity! I&#39;m kinda craving it again tonight...

Cool note: Most of the tables are private booths, which we loved because it made it feel like we were at our own private restaurant.  Great ventilation here too.  Just saying.  I hate smelling like smoke for the rest of the day.",24/10/15,249,5,2,5,17,7.6921,4.881,1.096,20.021999999999995,No,2208

The decor is eccentric, but makes you want to seek out the sculptures :)  Wish the bench was more comfortable too.

What we had:
Beef Soup - nice portion, good taste
Pork Belly - perfectly soft and greatly seasoned
Galbi - perfect cuts and superbly seasoned
Ribs - marbly goodness
Bi Bim Bop - total balance and distinct flavors, great rice
Japchae - not kidding, the best Japchae I&#39;ve ever had, noodles perfectly cooked, not greasy and a incredible depth of flavor that I&#39;ve never experienced.  Going back to see if it was a fluke.
Cones - complimentary cones after dinner, nice surprise

I want to emphasize that the service was amazing and attentive.  So many times (and my Korean friends are frank and will readily agree) if you&#39;re not Korean you just don&#39;t get the personal and warm service that Korean diners clearly get.

Pricing. Well the pulgogi, the best known Korean dish, was pricey, but just plain delicious !  The other dishes were often half that price, and were a very good selection of Korean dishes.
You should try this restaurant. If you&#39;re new to Korean food, they&#39;ll cook your food at your table right in front of you if you&#39;d like that.  The booths and tables were nicely private.

After going to dozens of KBBQ places from Koreana, BBQ Hut, Seocho Garden, 92 Town, Chicago Kalbi, etc... This place jumps to the first of my list for best KBBQ that I&#39;ve had in Illinois.  This place is located in a strip mall and upon entering it you will see a bunch of artsy decor.  The restaurant isn&#39;t very huge, but can seat two big parties (8+) on one side and a few smaller groups (4-6) on the other.

The owner and waiters took our order and the food came out quick.  The first thing to come out was the Hot Stone BiBimBop and that was good. It was on par with other Korean Restaurants is your typical bibimbop.  The next item to come out was the Panjeon (Seafood Pancake), oh man this pancake easily jumps to the best Panjeon I ever had. It even topped some of the pancakes that I&#39;ve had in Seoul, Korea.  The batter they use is different, which gives it crispy, fluffy texture in every bite.  My only regret with this is that we didn&#39;t buy two of these!

Now on to the main course! We ordered a assortment of things to grill Samgyeopsal , Kalbi, Beef Tongue, Bulgogi, and Squid.  Although my preference is charcoal when grilling meat, many restaurants, including this one uses gas instead.  Meat isn&#39;t just meat here, they use some quality cuts of meat here that are tender and packed with flavor.  I was impressed with the bulgogi especially, usually I do not like to order this because places either cut the bulgogi too small so when you grill it, the meat shrivels up or the marinades are not good.  The Bulgogi here are biggest slices and the marinade goes very well with the meat.  The Samgyeopsal included onions, zucchini, and a few mushrooms to grill with it.  I thought that the amount of meat you get on each order was a good amount.  

The service here is very good, the waiters/owners are very nice and attentive. They asked multiple times throughout the meal if we needed anything, and of course we needed more banchan :) At the end of the meal, mini ice cream drumsticks were brought out and some toy plushies were brought out for the girls.  This extra service was very generous of them and the atmosphere of this place is very welcoming.  Overall, this place jumps to the top of my list for best KBBQ in Illinois.

Upon entering, the setting wasn&#39;t very welcoming as we were the only patrons in the restaurant, no music playing, and there were many sculptures and other art pieces that seemed &#39;out of place.&#39;  It certainly gave us a lot to talk about and look at.

He gave us great recommendations (ie. scallion pancakes are very crispy, the meat is super fresh, all food is prepared to order) and he was right - we were all very pleased with the food.  He checked in on us very frequently and even proceeded to showcase some other historical artwork and a collector&#39;s item sword.  But that&#39;s not all, we each received a different STUFFED ANIMAL at the end of it all as a parting gift.  And MINI DRUMSTICK ice cream cones for dessert.

chungkiwa-restaurant-mount-prospect,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,m2pASztNPGKoasHLB-OPOw,"Chungkiwa is a bit of a mixed bag for me. On one hand, the flavors are pretty spot on , everything seems to be made out of good ingredients, the dishes are presented well -- however the portions are a bit small, lacking in meat, and the prices are quite high. The dishes are also not very memorable in flavor -- satisfying but you wouldn&#39;t recognize them in a blind taste test against other local Korean restaurants. The service is relatively good, the food temperature and cooking speed is good, the dining areas are comfortable and decorated quite a bit (although I don&#39;t exactly understand the theme), the noise level isn&#39;t too high although the background music isn&#39;t Korean themed.

I was served 6 banchan here, all fresh and light tasting -- a little small on portion size although we were offered refills -- nothing unusual you haven&#39;t tried elsewhere.

The hot pot bibimbap had a light flavor to it with nicely crisped rice. The fried end was prominent in this dish but I wish that the sliced beef was more noticable. The lightly sauteed and seasoned vegetables did provide nice texture contrast in the dish.

Jang gook bop had a good body to the broth with just the right amount of rice in the soup. 

Kalbi tang casserole was mixed for me -- I wish the beef had more flavor and the sesame oil was a little strong but the vermicelli in the dish did add a nice touch.

Sam kyup sal - The slices of pork belly were prepared well, fatty but still having a bouncy texture to the meat and crispy edges. The taste of sesame was prominent in this dish but it worked well. Still, a bit expensive for the amount of meat you&#39;re getting.

The meal ended with Lil&#39;Drums, which appropriately matches the mixed East-West feel I got from this restaurant. 

Overall, it&#39;s a place I would return to for the quality of the food -- but still wish that the prices would be just a little lower.",25/01/15,213,4,2,5,47,5.4319,2.1029999999999998,0.20900000000000002,12.687999999999999,No,1914

From the looks of it doesn&#39;t seem like it has any potential. I live so close to it and never realized it was there. Its in that weird plazza on algonquin by busse. Who would ever think that this fantastic korean place is there. Well I am so glad I ran into this place.

A fun fact about this place. You can cook the food yourself in front of you or you can order it be cooked in the back. I sugested we have it cooked in the back. I am not the best cook and frankly I am not sure how much I am bound to eff it up. 

My friend ordered 4 orders of bulgogi, 2 with the bone and 2 without. One loves the bone one and my other friend opts for the other. I think they taste exactly the same but hey what do I know? I am from south east europe, all we know is tomatoes and feta cheese. They were fantastic. It was blesses with some great seasoning and a fun like teriyaki sauce. Lohoved it! 

They give you so many little dishes with the food. They are more like sides or sauces. Some of them are really good, some are just too spicey for me. (I genuinely feel bad for the dishwasher)

Korean. BBQ meat dishes were 25 to 30 dollars each so weren&#39;t sure of portion size and what was included but again we didn&#39;t receive any help.  After ordering a few things she said, kitchen closes at 2 but I&#39;ll let you know.  Ten minutes later one plate of meat was dropped at table and guy walked away. The grill was not set up so we didn&#39;t know what to do and no one came to help.  Finally we asked someone for help and they looked at us like we were a huge burden.  A guy came back and uncovered grill and opened vent but still offered no assistance.  We asked again for help and a guy came and started grilling for us.  Meat was really good but portion seemed small for price, only came with white rice .  The guy picked up a large piece on short rib plate and said it was all bone and he should throw it away.  Why would they plate that?  We were all still hungry and asked to order more and he told us the kitchen was closed.  We pointed out it wasn&#39;t even 2 yet and he acted like he didn&#39;t understand.  We asked waitress again and she said sorry kitchen closed.

There are many Korean/BBQ restaurants in the northwest suburbs.  Tonight we decided to try one we never had before.  We drove by Chungkiwa many times but for some reason this was our first visit; and we like it!  First impression - with artworks and classical music all over the restaurant it was so non-traditional.  Service was very attentive, prompt, and friendly.  Quality of food was excellent - tasty, not salty, not overpowered by garlic as many BBQ restaurants do.  Everything was just right.  They had the best kimchi and bibimbop.  Highly recommended; and we definitely will return to Chungkiwa.  PS - I do agree with Tony C&#39;s wife comments on the price.....",03/08/14,77,5,2,5,29,4.060700000000001,2.42,0.0,8.58,No,690

The restaurant is located in a strip mall and to put it plainly, it&#39;s a hole in the wall. Inside the decor matches the outside. The lack of ambience is more than made up by the really nice employees at the restaurant. Everyone is super sweet and friendly. This is a family run place so don&#39;t expect white table cloths or a large wine list. 
We ordered the Chungkiwa special for 2. This included soup, appetizers , and and an assortment of marinated meats to grill. The best part of Korean BBQ is the ability to grill your own meat which was perfect for since we don&#39;t agree on how long to grill meats. The appetizers were delicious and the soup was amazing! The meats were fresh and tender. 
The only reason this place didn&#39;t get 5 stars is because the decor leaves a lot to be desired. But if your looking for a small whole in the wall authentic Korean BBQ restaurant near Ohare then come here immediately!",12/07/14,103,4,2,4,33,3.7469,2.2860000000000005,0.171,9.544,No,968

We came on a double date a few weeks back at the recommendation of the other couple, she is part Korean and this is where her Korean family eats.

1. Service, unlike other Korean BBQ houses, was STELLAR.  100% above par.  Very attentive, gracious (free dessert anyone?) honest, and polite.

2. Food was out of this world.  We started with an appetizer noodle dish, the name of which I&#39;ve regrettably forgotten.  It was glass-type noodles stir fried with vegetables and meat.  We also ordered an order of chicken and an order of bulgogi to cook on the grill.  The meat came with assorted vegetables as well.

3. Side dishes were also great, and replenished as many times as we wanted.  We had ample amounts of kimchi, chili tofu, bean sprouts, sweet radish, fish cake, and lightly pickled cucumbers.

The 2 main dishes and appetizer plus sides were more than enough for four of us.  Throw in drinks, and the bill including tip came to $45 per couple.  Not bad at all!

I will definitely be back to try other meats, and let Chungkiwa wow me some more!",10/12/12,143,5,2,4,42,3.1262999999999996,2.536,0.29,14.173999999999998,No,1084

However, I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the most traditional kind of cooking. I like the food here because the cooking is clean, and less greasy than other places. Also, ventilation is good here with the bbq grilling because my clothes didn&#39;t smell that much after I left. 

I would highly recommend the seafood pancake (if you like yours on the crispier side). I enjoyed the pork and kimchi stir fry as well. Also, you can&#39;t go wrong with the bbq, and this comes with bean paste soup. 

Furthermore, the workers here are very friendly and attentive to customers&#39; needs. They are a little quirky, though- not in a bad or annoying way. For instance, I came here on Christmas, and they passed out stuffed animals to everyone as a gift.

Previous comments about the decor are spot on: it looks like it used to be a Greek restaurant, converted to a Korean BBQ place.  They had opera music playing in the background,  which drove my wife nuts. But what really surprised me was the service. The food was great, but the way that the servers conducted their business was very impressive. The servers went well out of their way to make us feel well cared for. They gave us extra food for our toddlers, even dessert for them, all at no extra cost. The plates of food just kept coming, and our order was ready for us very quickly.

 My wife thought the food was overpriced (we got just two entrees, the kalbi and samkyupsal for about $50, without tip), but she was also impressed with the service.

Because of how horrendous it was, I had to call them and let them know. Once I called and spoke with the manager Billy, all he gave me was an OK and that he would talk to the chef. Hardly an apology which makes me even more pissed that I gave them a dime of my hard earned money.

billys-hot-dogs-beef-and-sandwiches-palatine,Jim P.,G8DFpQ7fH6bYe0E1GTo-Nw,RN6nS0gdKXZqiiYuAVc9Pg,"An unusual restaurant, to say the least. I guess one would categorize it as &#34;fast casual&#34;. It has one of the most extensive menu of any such restaurant of which I&#39;m aware. In addition to the expected burgers, hot dogs and fries, they feature numerous salads, panini sandwiches, wraps, pasta and more.

I sampled a double patty melt, fries, onion rings and what they call cream of chicken rice soup.

The patty melt was different and not really to my liking. The bread was marbled rye and it appeared they utilized some kind of unusual, almost lemon like seasoning in the toasting process. In addition they added pickles and ketchup without asking me. These aren&#39;t standard items on a typical patty melt. The onions appeared to be carmelized and were quite sweet. I prefer your standard grilled onions that have more &#34;bite&#34;. There are probably others that would enjoy this sandwich more than I, but it wasn&#39;t bad.

The soup was a big disappointment;watery and containing little chicken or rice. The fries and onion rings were decent, not outstanding. With more and more places opting for the fresh cut skin on style of french fries, these crinkle cuts are fast becoming an anachronism.

To their credit everything tasted fresh and made to order and the service was friendly and efficient. The interior is pleasing to the eye, but the dine in area is small and rather cramped. If they&#39;re crowded you may find yourself nearly in the lap of a fellow diner.",02/09/15,169,3,2,3,15,2.3905,1.549,0.44299999999999995,16.008,No,1484

You walk up and order at the counter, but there is room to sit (although it is a bit cramped with two ill positioned round tables that are between the booths).

The food was just ok.  My husband&#39;s hot dog and fries were fine. I liked my Vegetarian panini enough, although I did find the veggies used weird.  When I asked what kind of veggies were in the sandwich, the response I got was, &#34;Oh, lots of them.&#34; He then asked if I wanted avocado - which I agreed to. So how weird could it be?   Well, there were some boiled carrots, cauliflower, zucchini, spinach,  tomato, avocado, cheese  and their spinach artichoke spread.      I could have done without the mushy carrots, cauliflower and tomato - but the rest was good.  

But why was I charged $1.25 extra for avocado when avocado was listed in the description of the sandwich?   I noticed after I paid - so I wasn&#39;t going to make a big deal, but those little things irk me.

The matzoball soup was a bit salty while the cream of chicken soup was a bit thick and could have used some extra vegetables for flavor.

Even their pickles were awesome.  Nephew was enticed to try a banana-strawberry milkshake and felt it was well worth the calorie indulgence.

This review encompasses the last 4 visits.  Wednesday March 30th I was part of a group of 15 or so that stopped in for breakfast before golf.  We were seated quickly and given 2 servers to accommodate the large group.  I ordered from the main menu (3 eggs, hash-browns, bacon, &amp; toast).  Everything was great, not that you can really screw that up.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal.  

Tuesdays June 7th, 14th, &amp; 21st.  They offer a weekday morning deal that has roughly 10 or so options for only $6.25, always a plus.  Each day I ordered off of this menu.  

June 7th I had I think 2 eggs, hash-browns, &amp; bacon.  Once again, everything was great.  The order came out quickly as just off the grill top.  

June 14th &amp; 21st I had the french toast.  It only comes with 2 full pieces of 4 halves, along with either bacon or sausage.  I always get the bacon (3 pieces).  Both times everything once again was great tasting and super quick to come to my table.

The food has absolutely no flavor and is seldom cooked from scratch.
The sausage gravy is right out if a can horribly bland.
The Alfredo cause likewise. Runny and bland with horribly overcooked pasta.
Last visit i had chili in a bread bowl. The bread bowl was burnt and the chili was horrible salty canned crap.
Tried the Buffalo Wings once. They were chicken tenders with NO heat - no spices and no sauce. Asked the manager if they were indeed Buffalo wings. He said they were miss ordered - not their usual. When I asked why on Earth they would still serve them he begrudgedly offered me half off.
The portions are over sized to compensate for their lack of flavor. The prices are obscene for the quality.
Our waitresses have always been great and management has always been cold and aloof.
One night, we arrived 20 minutes before close and were refused a table. When we mentioned it was 20 minutes prior to closing We were told, &#34;We don&#39;t want to be here all night.&#34;

manor-restaurant-and-pancake-house-east-dundee,Gordon G.,-1eyZGJDZRBKXCqIykNaxg,LRDQmMm94NYNUvhngpbzNw,"Breakfast at the Manor Restaurant provides an East Meets West experience without the use of the trendy word &#39;Fusion&#39;, as in Asian-Fusion, which is hard to do. This building must have been a Chinese restaurant circa 1975 with its round windows, Asian influenced outdoor garden, low ceilings, and the &#34;bamboo&#34; (wood) facade encompassing the entire dining room.   All that was missing were paper placemats depicting the Chinese Zodiac signs (I&#39;m a monkey!) and Lazy Susans on the larger family-style tables.

Meeting the West, the menu consisted of American fare with a very slight Mexican influence.  Upon entering the Manor House, in true Western culture fashion, you&#39;re greeted by a display case consisting of pies, cakes, and baseball decorated cookies. Among the dining room, about 50% of patrons and staff were speaking English, and the other half were speaking Spanish. 

I ordered the Bacon, Eggs, and Toast meal and substituted Silver Peso Pancakes for the bread.  One can add hash browns to their meal for a dollar, so I did.   My eggs arrived scrambled as ordered, very tasty, and certainly largely portioned.  Hash browns were excellent, and the bacon was thin and crunchy.  My phenomenal pancakes included a scoop of whipped butter, which was the icing on the cake! (Chef&#39;s Note: Add some confectioners sugar to that butter, and it would be icing! Literally!)  No complaints at all for my meal.  

The better half ordered the No. 1 Pork Egg Foo Young Special.. errr, I mean, the 3 Egg Deluxe Omelette, which consisted of bacon, sausage, onions, green peppers, sans mushrooms.  This omelette had way too much cheese to be enjoyable, but the pancakes more than made up for the kitchen snafu.  

Water glasses are tiny and need to be refilled constantly, which I find to be a pain.  Coffee magically stays refilled, which is a definite plus in my book.   Service was good.

The acoustics de Restaurante Manor are AMAZING.  So quiet, even if you have a hangover, you won&#39;t be bothered by noise.  Overall, an enjoyable restaurant not to be missed.  

I now find myself craving old-school Chinese/Polynesian cuisine for dinner tonight, certainly due to the decor of this pancake house.   Bring on the Pu Pu Platter, Teriyaki Beef, and Scorpion Bowl for dinner!

All of their skillets are worth trying though. They all cost around 6-7$, and each is different enough to satisfy a multitude of cravings and tastes. Their soups and other menu items such as melts and burgers are also worth a try. The soups are simple but good for wetting your appetite, and are included with many meals.

The quality of the food is about what you would expect from a cafeteria, but it comes in generous portions. It&#39;s great for the day that you are hungry and lazy and want more variety than pizza delivery.

Yesterday, my group of 4 decided to dine in. I would not recommend this to anyone, and we will not be back. The waitress was condescending and inattentive. See Mike M&#39;s 11/9/14 review - he&#39;s already explained it. I will add that the pickle spears were mush, the crackers were stale, and after the waitress brought us our check she never returned, even though some of us were still eating.

I get the distinct impression that their attitudes are due to our ages - we are all in our twenties, and the Manor caters more to the 60+ crowd. My friends and I dine out frequently, speak respectfully to restaurant staff, forgive small mistakes, and tip 20%. This age discrimination is undeserved, unusual, and it&#39;s bad for business.

The coffee was barely warm and don&#39;t even get me started on the water. The menu was unorganized which made ordering difficult. We ordered our so called breakfast and once it arrived at the table we seriously wondered how can this place ever be busy? Everything was digusting. We&#39;ve never had bad bacon before so thanks for that. The &#34;Manor skillet&#34; was spoiled by using canned mushrooms. The cheese on the skillets was gross. To make matters worse while we are barely choking down this future vomit our entire party was smacked in the face with the most horrific rotten fish smell coming from the kitchen. It was so bad that we just paid and left.
We seriously would have preferred McDonald&#39;s. We will never, ever attempt to eat here again. Ever.",18/07/14,139,1,1,-3,-61,-3.0788,1.015,3.1180000000000008,15.868,No,1284

I basically grew up in this restaurant like most anyone born and raised in the Carpentersville/Dundee area. All I have to say is the owner or owners daughter (I don&#39;t know which but she is middle aged with dark hair) is either racist, hates children or discriminates against children and/or families with disabilities.

Occurrence #1: my nephew has autism and on this particular day we had been out and about and it had been a long day. We were all tired and we stopped in for a quick bite to eat on our way home. My nephew was having a rough moment, as all children do, and my sister was doing her best to keep him calm and quiet. This nasty woman (the middle aged woman with dark hair) came over and asked if everything was OK. My sister gave her a half smile and said, &#34;Yes. Everything&#39;s fine.&#34; and this woman had the audacity to say, &#34;Obviously not!&#34; and walk off! So unbelievably rude!

Occurrence #2: we had my great-grandmother&#39;s luncheon after her funeral at The Manor. When we were being seated, my sister asked if we could order for my nephew right away (a means to keep him occupied) and this same person said &#34;No&#34; very rudely, continued ignoring my sister and went about seating everyone else.

Occurrence #3: we were back with a larger group of our family and while we were waiting for our food this same woman came over doting on one of the other children at our table, laughing and talking with him and took him to the front of the restaurant to pick out crayons and coloring materials to bring back to his seat. She never once acknowledged my nephew (the only other child in our group) with a &#34;hello&#34;, a smile, or offered him any crayons.

Is it because he&#39;s mixed (black, white and Asian)? Is it because he has special needs? She is either racist or this is not a persons w/ disabilities friendly establishment. We will NEVER go back.",18/06/14,213,1,1,0,-26,-0.9815000000000002,1.173,1.767,16.059999999999995,No,1991

There was no wait for our group of six, which was nice.  They didn&#39;t have kid&#39;s menus for the kids (or at least we weren&#39;t offered one) and there wasn&#39;t a kid&#39;s section on the menu, anyway.  The kids had eaten a bit before, though, so they just decided to share with us anyway.

Our waitress was a bit...brisk.  I don&#39;t think she smiled once.  She was all business and it was slightly awkward.  It was almost as if we were a big inconvenience for her.  So 1 star for service.... I mean, it was fast-ish, but she was craaaaaaabby.

And the food...meh.  My veggie omelet was not very good at all.  I like when the eggs and the veggies are melded together, and this was just sort of eggs-wrapped-around-some-greasy-veggies.  Meh.  But mine came w/ silver dollar pancakes that the kids seemed to enjoy.

My husband got a stack of pancakes, though, and these were REALLY good.  They were better than the silver dollar ones that came with my meal, and they were SUPER fluffy.  So delicious!  I kept stealing bites of his food :)

The d̩cor is the same. The menu is the same. The &#34;specials&#34; are the same. The soups are the same. The lackluster service is the same. About all this place can offer are a good typical breakfast and typical sandwiches. But how hard is it to make toast, pancakes, eggs, bacon, hash browns or a BLT, Reuben or patty melt sandwich?

I ordered the fish and chips once and got a square piece of previously frozen fish and fries. A fish sandwich from McD&#39;s had more flavor! Granted this place is not fine dining, but a frozen piece of frozen processed fish is labeled fish and chips?

On a recent visit, five seconds after being seated, the old sour bitty of a waitress greeted me with &#34;Do you know what you want yet?&#34; No Hello or how are you. She came back a few minutes later and took my order. She brought my Reuben sandwich and asked if I wanted the thousand-island dressing. I replied &#34;Yes, that that&#39;s what makes it a Reuben.&#34; A couple of minutes later she brought it. How many people order a Reuben without the dressing?

After I finished, she slapped the check on the table without saying a word.

I decided to do a search for manor (after hearing they were a chain) and was surprised to find this location in East Dundee. Much to my surprise it is the same place!!! The potato pancakes here taste the same and so does the coffee (they have great coffee). The Potato pancakes are made fresh and have a hit of Cheddar cheese. This is one of only a few restaurants I will order potato pancakes (they are great at Our Kitchen also). The old 70&#39;s style dinner is great also. Plenty of comfortable booths here.

There is a great secret menu - the Lucky 7 (a wreck with double meat, using the meat from an Italian) is my favorite. One of my favorite things about Potbelly is that you can customize your sandwich any way you want. Meatballs on your a Wreck (a wrecking ball), they can do it!

Also, if you have a problem with your Potbelly experience, if you go onto their website and let them know, they&#39;ll do something about it (I know for a fact they then go to district and store managers with customer feedback), and they reward you with two free sandwiches for your bad experience.

Good thing I tried it again.  Since my second time trying Potbelly&#39;s I have not gone back to the other sandwich places around.

I usually get the roast beef on white, but today I had the Italian sandwich, and I think it is the best Italian sandwich of any of the chain stores that are around (you know who you are!).

If you like pickles, their pickle oil gives the sandwich another layer of flavor due to the vinegary tang.  Exceptional!  Their bread is baked and I firmly believe that bread baked well can make a mediocre sandwich tasty, and crumbly, tasteless bread can make a good sandwich almost unedible.  Props to Potbelly&#39;s for their delicious bread.

I cannot say more about this awesome sandwich shop, but WOW! :)  

Overall ALL the Potbelly Sandwich Works restaurants have been awesome and the consistancy is impeccable! So, if you go to one you can expect the same quality sandwich at another.

Of all the sandwich shops chains out there, THIS one is my absolute best! It has toasted sandwiches, it has awesome chili, soup, potato salad, cole slaw, etc.  All taste very fresh and homemade (or pretty darn close if it isn&#39;t!)  

I always have either the Italian OR the Wreck.  I also enjoy the PB&amp;J sandiwich(yes, you heard me) which is awesome(but messy) when toasted.  Their sandwiches are simple, but VERY flavorful(especially if you add hot peppers! yum!)

They also serve hand-dipped ice cream and yummilicous malts. They have other little sweets like cookies, ice cream cookie sandwiches as well.  

This particular location is QUITE busy especially during lunchtime, so expect to wait in line for a bit as they get your sandwiches done. As every sandwich is made to your taste, it will take a little bit to get your sandwich ready. But, oh man, is it worth it! 

Crispy, toasted bread(wheat or white), warm meats and cheese. Their homemade hot pepper mix is hot without being overly so. 

The restaurant itself is very clean and the music is upbeat and not overly blaring or distracting either.  Very casual, but not so much to make it look cheap.  The antique shop decor is interesting and adds to the ambiance of the place.

My party of 3 had a very attentive waitress and the (owner/manager) stopped by to ask how everything was.

The food was all very good and everyone enjoyed it.
The rangoons were nice and crispy, not oily. The General Tso chicken was flavorful but not very spicy, and the kung bao pork was right on par.... no huge surprises here.

What I really liked was the quality of the meat in all of the dishes. A lot of places use fried chicken that is 70% breading and some unidentifiable meat-ish core..... not here.
My General Tso chicken was legit chicken fried right and instantly identifiable as chicken.

The only thing stopping me from giving Lin&#39;s a full 5 stars is that the serving sizes were smaller than most other chinese places in the area.... a lighter eater in my group did have leftovers, so it&#39;s not exactly skimpy and the prices are fair for what you get, it&#39;s just more of a lunch portion.

A little overkill for appetizer. Our dinner consisted of sweet and sour pork, beef fried rice, and 3 delight which was a beef and chicken dish. Taste was fine but the quantilties were small. We had to ask for white rice and soy sauce. I usually like white rice with chinese food  in addition to fried rice. Service pretty slow even tho the restaurant was not crowded.

Now that I&#39;m thinking about it, a conflict ensues when she becomes hungry and asks me where I want to eat. Today, I wanted Fried Rice; but, my mom didn&#39;t want Chinese food as soon as she called Chef Ping to place an order and found out the restaurant is closed on Mondays.

Both of us agreeing with Thai for lunch was too good to be true. She showed me a menu from a place she recently tried with her boyfriend and I wasn&#39;t impressed. It took my finesse and this app for her to cooperate with me.

Yelp provided over one hundred reviews but it was someone&#39;s photo of their  Shrimp Pad Nar that won me over. I don&#39;t even know how many times I skipped over this place because of its curious name. Now, Thai Little Home has us wanting more!

The crab rangoons were small and crispy. I feel like they could have added more cream cheese/ crab filling. 

The egg role in the lunch special was bomb, but everything else was pretty average. My spicy chicken was not spicy at all. I think they didn&#39;t put the sauce on it? 

Pro tip: Use the spoon they give you for the Pad Thai. I know some people are probably rolling their eyes at how obvious this suggestion is, but they cut the noodles up into tiny pieces which makes it hard to manage with a fork alone.

I recommend coming here for the lunch special from 11 AM - 2:30 PM, Monday - Friday (the restaurant is closed on Wednesdays, though). You&#39;ll get a lot for $7.25 (There&#39;s a $2 upcharge for a dish with shrimp or squid). With your choice of Pad Khee Mao, Pad See Ewe, a Thai Basil dish with your choice of meat or tofu,  a red curry dish with your choice of meat or tofu, plus four other dishes, you can&#39;t go wrong. Each lunch special comes with an egg roll, chicken satay, Pad Thai (meatless), and fried rice (meatless).  I typically get the Beef Pad See Ewe, which is always good. In particular, I like how the dish has the perfect balance of noodles, meat, and Chinese broccoli. 

As for the restaurant&#39;s other offerings, we enjoy the shrimp toast and the Thai calamari. The individual pieces of toast and calamari are big. Both dishes have a nice batter on them. I particularly like the Thai calamari&#39;s delicate batter, which allows the calamari to largely stand on its own.

I asked him about it and he said it was not great - since I loved mine, I wondered if it was him or me.  Turns out that even though they were the same dish, mine was WAY better.

We have been here at least a dozen times for both lunch and dinner.  We have tended to stick with the single dish we like, so we can&#39;t offer a wide review of their menu.  For lunch, the amount of food you get for the Lunch Special is enormous.  I&#39;ve had friends actually leave food on their plates.

I wish I saw Candice&#39;s review before I went. BYOB is the bestest! Duly noted for next time.

Thai Little Home Cafe is tucked away in this rundown strip mall but is nice on the inside - nicer than what you&#39;d think you would find here. We went in with the intentions of having a very fast lunch to make a movie and it happened just as we needed to. We ordered, the food came out really quickly and they were fast about bringing our bill and running our card. Plus they were on top of refilling our drinks through the meal.

I ordered the Chicken Pad See Ewe and loved it! It was a big portion for a good price. The chicken was super moist and cooked just the right amount. The noodles in the dish were great. Overall, loved what I ate!

thai-little-home-cafe-arlington-heights,Rick L.,tYjd9n5_4Kibix2OLCbCAg,uMT14svqFgCc-N_NPJe1Ew,"8pm Tuesday night.  I am the only patron in the restaurant.  Service should be really good I hope.

Starting with the Tom Yum Kai soup.  It is coconut milk based which has a unique taste. I did not find it spicy.  I did kick it up a notch with chili sauce. Chicken and mushrooms were very satisfying.  Large enough to share. Temperature was almost perfect, I am not a fan of Luke warm soup.  Would have been perfect on a really cold night. I ate maybe half of the soup.

Next was an eggplant dish with beef.  Advertised as a spicy dish, I found it tame but very tasty.  The beef was just a bit chewy, but when eaten with the eggplant and julienned carrots, it was a wonderful explosion of tastes.  The serving size was just right, not overwhelming. Especially after the soup.

Even though I was the only person in the restaurant, the rice was perfect.  Not mushy at all so it had to have been pretty freshly made.  That is a big deal. 

Not entirely done, probably over did it with the homemade coconut ice cream.  It was the only thing that was just okay.

All for $18.69 plus tip.  Worth every penny.  You don&#39;t have to spend a fortune to have an enjoyable meal.

Once again the yelp community was right on. Thank you.  I travel a lot and depend on your comments.",18/03/14,148,4,3,5,59,5.6865000000000006,4.395,0.128,23.477,No,1269
thai-little-home-cafe-arlington-heights,Nick C.,T_6kSUID2ODT0xgCgl5Muw,hvxcUWKpAEee0HS16KzO8Q,"Best asian joint in the area. Been going here since it was a establishment in Chicago on the North Side.

Appetizers: 

Fish cakes - amazing -- it may sound different, but you will not be disappointed. 

Fried wontons - cheap and addicting. Not going to fill you, but are very tasty.

Satay Chicken - fantastic, it&#39;s good sized portion for the price, although it may seem pricey.


Main Dishes:

Pad see ewe - adored by my sister.  She gets this once a week to keep her sanity, I think. 

Chicken with egg noodle - beloved by family and guests when I serve this.

Fried Rice Dishes - would take a punch from Mike Tyson for ...


The FRIED RICE is amazing and is better than any place you can go to, even high priced chains.  Do yourself a favor and get beef fried rice from here.


Other thoughts:

Still home ran by the family who had it in Chicago for years when my parents were just in their 20s (they&#39;re in 60s now).  Still roll the napkins and silverware the same way.  Always a friendly staff.

Red sauce on the table is traditional Thai spicy and is delicious.



Key Money Savor:   

BYOB


Bring a cheap bottle of wine from Trader Joe&#39;s and you&#39;re going to pay $40 for 2 people with a bunch of appetizers and left overs. Great for a casual date night OR a new date where you want to impress your significant other with amazing food so that you look like a connoisseur. 

Final Thoughts:


I no longer order Chinese. Thai Little Home ALL DAY.

thai-little-home-cafe-arlington-heights,Sethu M.,_3FKvELgV4XA0aSSXGaU_g,EHGf-NbIhl1L6dn6c0R9PA,"Went here for lunch on two occasions this past week. Both times I ordered from their lunch special menu. Both times the food was consistent and the portion was huge enough that I couldn&#39;t even finish it. The fact I liked the most is that the food seemed &#39;clean&#39;...meaning I was convinced that they properly washed and prepped the food before cooking it unlike some other Asian restaurants I have been to in past where the chicken would smell like old rags.
Their service is also amazing....perfect in my mind. The morning server is really quite but extremely observant. As soon as you enter the door, she will be waiting with the menus and as soon as you wipe your hands with the napkin after your meal, she will be ready with your check. She does everything in extreme stealth mode and doesn&#39;t always hover over you for the type of service she provides. She should be truly rewarded because in my mind a good server is not someone who can chat up a storm but someone who is attentive, quick and effective. So full points on that. 
I also don&#39;t agree with any one star reviews. One star should be reserved for a place that is horrible in all aspects and doesn&#39;t even try to improve. You can&#39;t possibly give a small business one star because your one item wasn&#39;t up to your standards based on just one visit. It could mean a death sentence for them when they are just trying to do their best. And by no means this restaurant is so bad that it deserves such a low rating....that&#39;s just my opinion.

Con&#39;s:
Noodles were over cooked, super soft and way too oily, order Basil or Cashew instead if you&#39;d like to avoid noodles or give it try, maybe they have improved it already.

Clean
Huge portions
Consistent food

The Pad Thai was just average. To be honest, it looked lighter in color than most pad thai that I&#39;ve ordered, but I can&#39;t say that it took away from the flavor.

A. Affordable.
B. BYOB. BYOB. BYOB. (in case you missed it the first time around)
C. Charming (and really, with enough BYOB supplies, what isn&#39;t?) and the Cutest restaurant name ever, and Cost effective (so Cheap!)
D. Delicious
E. Exotic
F. Fast (Holy Crap- this was lightning speed) and Family owned + operated

...alright, imma be honest: I don&#39;t feel like finding an adjective for every letter of the alphabet just to be cute so I&#39;m gonna go ahead and skip to my favorite reason (after BYOB) .


S. SPICY!!!  Finally, a Thai food venue that understands when a hot blooded woman says she wants it extra spicy, she frickin&#39; means it. And I like the type of spicy their food is... it&#39;s both hot pepper spicy and black pepper spicy. Aaand they earned extra bonus points for having that spicy stuff right on the table for additional DIY spicing.

My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for decades since it was originally established in Chicago and still continue to make the trip out to the suburbs to eat at the new location. 

From the moment you walk in you can see the numerous newspaper and food articles that rave about the food. This place has been a big part of Chicago&#39;s Thai food community since the 70&#39;s! Way before the whole Thai food craze began and still family owned and continues to put out authentic and excellent Thai dishes. I&#39;m sure there are a bunch of the older generation folks who, if they knew what yelp was or how to use it, wouldn&#39;t hesitate to give this place 5 stars.

There is something for everyone at this place. 

1. If you are dining on a budget, all the menu items are cheap and, in my opinion, under priced for the high quality and large portions you get. (no that wasn&#39;t a typo, you seriously get more than your money&#39;s worth)

2. They offer a variety of freshly prepared and tasty Thai dishes from the classic and well known Pad-Thai to  uncommon dishes like Larb-Kai and other spicy salads. My favorites are the Red Snapper with the house special sauce and the Chicken-egg noodles.

3. If no. 1 applies to you and you enjoy alcohol, then here is another reason to go to this place, it&#39;s BYOB and located in the same strip mall as a liquor store!

lastly, service is always top notch. The wait staff is always attentive and the owners love engaging with the customers and taking time out to talk and make relationships.

We had the Thai Calamari which was perfectly cooked and tender - so many places overcook it and it turns into a texture similar to rubber bands.

For entrees we had Pad Thai (tofu), Pad Woonsen (Squid) and Panang Curry (Vegetables/Tofu).  The Pad Thai was one of the best I have ever had - a good balance between sweet/savory.  The Pad Woonsen was also very good and again, the squid was cooked to perfection.  Unfortunately, while I liked the flavor of the Panang Curry, the consistency of the sauce fell short of expectations.  It was a both consistency - it did not adhere to the rice or the other ingredients at all which, for me, is a big negative.  I love the sauce so much and want to eat it all, not leave it in a puddle on the plate.

To be fair, I am a very tough critic when it comes to Thai food since I have traveled to Thailand so many times and tried all kind of things while I was there. 

I ordered chicken and pork satay, crab rangoon, lad na noodle and chicken fried rice. The satay could use a longer marinating time or cut the meat thinner I suppose. It was pretty tasteless. The peanut sauce was ok, I prefer my with a little kick of red curry. 

Crab rangoon was very disappointing. Barely any filling and overcooked. My kids look at it and was like &#34;is this crab rangoon or fried wonton?&#34; It was dark brown and less than a dime size stuffing.

Lad na noodle was not edible. I ended up throwing it out because it was way too salty. The sauce was also runny like soup, not like the traditional lad na gravy sauce. It also didn&#39;t fill up the to go container all the way. It looks like leftover just like someone else already said on here. Also, no vinegar with pepper to go with my lad na noodle. 

The fried rice was ok. Kids ate it but could use some vegetables in it. The 2 slices of cucumber was a joke.The fried rice was more like chinese fried rice, not thai fried rice. Also, did not fill up the container completely. No lime. Thai fried rice with no lime?

I paid almost $40 for food and probably will have to pay another $40 for the dry cleaning. I left smelling like the kitchen.The smell stick to my coat. They need to fix the hood because the smell is leaking out into the dining area.

I guess the further you are from the city, the worse thai food gets. I&#39;ll stick with my 2 favorite places in Niles and Morton Grove from now on.",02/12/14,227,1,1,2,-37,1.7808000000000002,2.559,2.8150000000000004,22.627000000000006,No,1840

The place was quite spacious and cozy and reminded me of a cafe that we ate at in Phuket a few years back. The service was spot on, everything was brought out pretty fast and hot just the way we like it. 

Onto the important part, the Thai goods. We started with some Thai egg rolls which were very fresh and delicious. Crunchy outer edge the way it needs to be. Then we got the crab ragoons, which were served smaller than we are used to but also delicious. Then again, we did get like 10 little ones as opposed to 5-6 big ones that I&#39;m used to, so overall you get your money&#39;s worth. Then we got a few pad Thai&#39;s to share and they were light colored like a few people have mentioned, but also tasty. I&#39;m very picky on my pad Thai so I don&#39;t know if I would get it here again, but then again it was still okay. I&#39;ve just definitely had better. Now onto the best dish of the night, the pan fried red snapper with jalapeno peppers. OH MY is all I have to say, it was outstanding. Super spicy, super fresh, with like a sweet edge on the crust, it was just out of this world amazing. The place without the fish would be like a 3 star but that fish alone takes it up a notch. 

I will definitely be back and will bring more friends and family here and get like 5 fish orders. Wish it was a tad closer to my house, but will make the trip on a cold winter night.

pad thai- on the lighter side. they use more of a sweet chili sauce than the peanut sauce
red curry and panang curry - acceptable, but pretty heavy on the peanut sauce-- i prefer my curry sweeter with more coconut milk, and this was more thick and chunky than milky.
squid salad- a new try, and i liked it! squid cooked perfectly,
chicken satay - standard

I have to be honest, though, I&#39;m not sure it quite lived up to its reviews.  My brother ordered some pot stickers that he thought were dried out (my dad seemed to agree), and my mom was disappointed with her chicken panang curry, saying it was very one-note and lamented the lack of vegetables.  My dad ordered their iced coffee with condensed milk, and found it too sweet-- though I think both of my parents take the blame upon themselves for ordering things they didn&#39;t know very much about.

However, I really enjoyed my vegetables red curry entree with tofu.  It&#39;s definitely spicy, but also has quite a few vegetables in it (unlike most of their entrees!)  My brother liked his chicken satay and pork fried rice, my dad liked his pad thai, and my mom really liked the tom ka kai soup with chicken that she ordered.  Anything with meat comes with a full animal&#39;s worth, which is definitely a good thing value-wise, but doesn&#39;t do much for balanced dishes.

One other thing-- we had to flag our waiter down quite a lot, certainly more than was warranted by the mostly-empty Thursday night dining room.

I&#39;ve visited here several times--actually always with my folks. We seem to get the same waitress each time but that&#39;s not a bad thing. Service is always timely, friendly and attentive. It&#39;s a pretty space, white tablecloths give it a more formal feel but it&#39;s still really casual. 

We always get the pork satay. I was a chicken satay person but Mom knows best--she said the pork satay will have better flavor because it&#39;s will hold up better--more tender and juicy--than say white meat in chicken satay. She&#39;s totally right! The pork satay has a good flavor, very tender. Add their yummy home-made peanut sauce it just amps up the flavor! 

For noodles, we pass on the Pad Thai and opt for Pad Khee Mao--wide rice noodles, Thai basil, bell peppers and Thai peppers. You can choose your choice of beef, chicken, shrimp but we always get tofu. Wonderful basil flavor, nice spice and the tofu is cooked perfectly--firm and not mushy. 

Our other go-to dishes include the House Fried Rice--we choose shrimp. The fried rice is light and not greasy. Nice pieces of tomato, onions and green onions. Topped with a fried egg, you could totally make this a meal in itself. The deep-fried snapper, either spicy or sweet/sour, is a great dish too. Fresh fish and it holds up well to the spicy or sweet/sour sauce. The Thai Iced Coffee is always a must. Very good flavor and because it&#39;s a little sweet, it helps cool off the palate when you&#39;re enjoying all the spicy food.

It&#39;s the one word I would use to describe this restaurant. 

Food was not good at all. The pad see ewe I ordered was too oily. Although, they did have good shrimp toast. But, that was probably the highlight of my meal.

I gave this place two stars instead of one, only because of their lunch special. Lunch specials are only about 7 dollars, and you get a bunch of food. You get fried rice, pad thai, chicken sate, and an egg roll - in addition to the entree you order. It was very filling - but, I don&#39;t know if I would ever fill my stomach with that food again.

Also, service was mediocre. One of the things I hate the most when eating in restaurants, is when they don&#39;t serve the food all at once. I was in a group of about 15 people, and we all got our food at different times. The curry came out first. Five minutes later, a few more dishes came out. Another five minutes later, another couple dishes. And five minutes later, the last of the dishes. So, one person got their food first, and 15 minutes later the last three people got their food. A fifteen minute difference between meals coming out is not acceptable in my opinion. 

If you do still end up going here - like I said, the shrimp toast was pretty good. Other than that, don&#39;t waste your time.",23/12/10,159,2,2,2,12,1.3125,1.4549999999999998,0.622,18.923,No,1286

thai-little-home-cafe-arlington-heights,Michelle K.,ii1lLmpRH4LzPXuhU9Zw2Q,13hAPUSRm0Scro06pAvotQ,"Thai Little Home.  A cute little name for a cute little restaurant.

Don&#39;t ignore this place just because it&#39;s in a strip mall!  Good things do indeed come in strip mall packages.  (Or something like that.  I can&#39;t remember how the saying goes, so sue me.)  The decor is cute but unremarkable, save for the GIGANTIC ALBINO LOBSTER mounted on the wall near the entrance.  Scary, but cool.

During my visit, we ordered the shrimp toast as an alternative to the usual crab rangoon we often order at other Thai and Chinese restaurants.  It was tasty and filling (perhaps a little TOO filling for two people) and accompanied by a sweet cucumber and onion salad.  My chicken pad thai was very good, and tasted even better when I reheated the leftovers the next day.  My boyfriend&#39;s beef pad kee mao was excellent and very spicy.  In general, I&#39;m not a huge fan of super-spicy food, but I hate when pad kee mao isn&#39;t spicy at all!  I really enjoyed Thai Little Home&#39;s version.

Thai Little Home has a lot of items on their menu. Some are pretty good, some are not so good. Everything I got was a bit too oily for my taste. But the seasoning is typically right on. I would definitely come back to try out more items on their menu. 

The thai egg rolls - good, but standard 
The pork satay - plump and flavorful. the cucumber salad was too sweet and the peanut sauce started to separate and looked kind of gross. 
wonton soup - DO NOT get this! Not even sure what the filling is made of.

Came here with some co-workers.  Had a lunch special choice (pad see ew).  It was typical, but I came back with my wife on a separate occasion and that was a lot better.

We ordered the papaya salad, which my wife loves.  Also ordered a whole fish that was prepared with a variety of veggies.  That was excellent.  

We also had lettuce wraps that is usually ground chicken.  Only, upon inspection, it wasn&#39;t ground chicken, it was actually great quality (white meat) chicken that was broken and torn to bits.  That totally won me over as it was fresh, flavorful and good quality.

We ordered the fresh spring rolls while we waited for our takeout order. Two really long spring rolls were delivered to our table within a couple minutes. They were cut into bite sized pieces like a sushi roll and the syrupy sauce was poured on top. The first bite was surprisingly and uncharacteristically warm, nay, hot! So I recalibrated my expectations for a hot appetizer assuming they had just made it without time to chill. The sauce was sweet, the soft wrap was good but the stuff inside was not. Plain tofu, plain scrambled eggs and plain noodles. No flavor and very spongey. I was starving so I kept eating anyway. After 2 more bites down the line, the roll was lukewarm and then refrigeratedly cold, revealing that the roll must have been microwaved for some reason and very unevenly at that. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it had been in the freezer. Yuck. We left about half of it on the table. Our takeout order included the potstickers, vegetable red curry with tofu and the Pad Khee Mao with chicken. I liked that the potstickers were made with chicken instead of pork. They were served with a &#34;spicy vinegar-soy sauce&#34; which was not spicy and very vinegary. The red curry was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. The sauce was watery thin and painfully lacking that yummy rich curry flavor and not a single leaf of Thai basil to be found. The Pad Khee Mao noodles were very mushy and the prominent ingredient in this dish was oil. No real tasty flavor to speak of. The &#34;hot peppers&#34; appeared to be jalape̱os which I always detest when they&#39;re standing in for Thai chilies; but alas, this seems to be the norm in Chicago. (I&#39;m partial to the Thai food in Orlando). At least it was nice to see Thai basil in this dish and the chicken was cooked well.

Inside we met Sammy.  He made us feel like we&#39;d been coming to his place for years.  It was fun.  I&#39;m not going to get into the food--there&#39;s lots of others who had said it was delish and it is.  I did have the chili-cheese dog.  The crispy slab of bacon on top was a pleasant surprise.

As I was looking at the menu on the wall and deciding what to order... Decided on a couple slices of pizza and a chicago style hot dog..  The owner I assume is very nice, makes you feel like a customer whos been coming there for ages..

Everything seems made to order as I had to wait 5-10  mins for order...No problem was prewarned by owner as he said will be a few mins..

Kind of was hoping they had some lemonade of some sort however is just coke, water, and few others in cans...  Howeever am sure don&#39;t  sell a lot so no worries..

So i receive my food and on way..  Get home everything is still piping hot..

I eat the chicago style hot dog its good, nice flavor there is nothing bad to say about it.. Other  than the pickle was an off brand...  Can tell wasn&#39;t a food brand pickle..  Would order again really want to try other kinds of dogs they sell.

The pizza.  I had to really let this cool down it was hot hot hot.. The  sauce, the cheese, the sausage was all the perfect amount and tasted great.   The crusted tasted reat as well however for some reason it was a little doughy even thou the pizza was so hot..  Kind of undercooked I suppose..  Will I hold it against them no it happens.

- ORIGINAL REVIEW -


I&#39;ve been holding off reviewing this place for a bit because I wanted to try a lot of their stuff, but upon eating the Chicken Tandoori Pizza last night, i can no longer stay silent. 

It was among the finest pies I have eaten in my life.

The fresh cut fries they serve manage to be crispy, not soggy, as so many other establishments do. The deep fried taco is stuff of legends.

The burgers are GREAT! One of my favorites is the Hickory Burger. The man is a surgeon with bacon.

Something I admire in burgers the same way I do sushi that doesn&#39;t fall apart when you pick it up. The hot dogs are delicious and there is a wide variety of options. Consistent through all meal options is the quality of ingredients and the great skill with which they are executed.

Tonight is the third time in the last year that I tried and failed to get dinner! They do not keep true to their own posted operating hours.  Always closing early. Tonight I called at 7pm to order wings, he said it would be just a few min. I said oh it usually takes longer. I can&#39;t make it that quick. I asked if they could put the order in so that it was ready to be picked up around 745. He said no, we can&#39;t do that and then hung up on me as I was trying to say ok if call back in 30 min to order again.  So fast forward to 7:38 exactly I call again.  They won&#39;t answer the phone. I called about 5 times. Finally knowing they are going to close at 8 my husband runs over there to order in person....doors locked and lights off when he gets there at 745 which is still 15 min before they are supposed to be closed. I&#39;ve had this happen 3 times now!  I&#39;m sorry, but no food is worth that effort and it&#39;s just poor customer service. If you post you&#39;re open until 8, and your answering machine says your open until 8 you need to be open until 8. Or have a well posted disclaimer that says we close when we please because we don&#39;t care about our customers. My husband was in the parking lot at 745 listening to a message saying they are open for another 15 min.  Nice. The first time this happened I called 30 min before closing and the guy said they don&#39;t take orders that late.....I said I didn&#39;t understand because they were open for another 30 min. Apparently when it says they close at a certain time that&#39;s when they plan on walking out the door and has nothing to do with what time they will serve customers.

Three months into our relationship and my family continues to work our way through their ever-changing menu. Lemme give you a few highlights...

Tandoori Chicken. On a pita. On a pizza. In a taco shell...no, not just any taco shell. It&#39;s like the best chalupa shell you&#39;ve ever had but sooo much better. I&#39;ll be honest here. The words &#39;tandoori chicken&#39; scared me at first. I&#39;m picky. I don&#39;t like new things. Except that&#39;s all a lie because every time I try something new at Sam&#39;s, I like it. Basically, tandoori chicken is well-seasoned chicken breast chunks. It&#39;s a little spicy. It&#39;s not &#34;burn-your-face-off-spicy&#34;, but rather, &#34;I-like-my-taste-buds-to-get-a-workout-spicy&#34;. The chicken breast chunks are fabulous and fresh!  They serve it with a homemade sauce that I&#39;ve tasted. It&#39;s good, but I am not a huge fan of dairy, so I get that on the side. The seasoning is not like something that I&#39;ve ever had before...and that&#39;s a good thing. It makes the chicken a bright orange color. I thought it was weird until I tasted it. Now, it&#39;s one of my new favorite foods. 

Speaking of favorite foods, have you tried paratha?  I did a couple weeks ago for the first time (under duress) and now I can&#39;t get enough!  This is a homemade gluten-free bread, like a flatbread made with wheat flour. I loved it plain!!!  I even liked it with sour cream and, as I mentioned, I&#39;m not a dairy fan.  Filled with tandoori chicken, it&#39;s waaaay too filling, but flavorful. I really like the flavors in the onion paratha best (so far).  Again, another thing that I never would have tried back in the day, but Sam, Rachel, Nick and the whole crew have yet to steer me wrong.

BBQ Saturday. It&#39;s a great day to eat at Sam&#39;s!  Try the ribs with the homemade sauce. Talk about finger lickin&#39; good!!!  I still have the BBQ beef sandwich on my list of things to try. Maybe next weekend?

We&#39;ve fallen head over heals for their hand packed burgers, the Bari Italian beef sandwiches and their gyros fresh off the spit. The fried taco is sooo bad, yet sooo good in all the right ways!  And when given a choice between their fresh cut fries and their beer nuggets (made from fresh pizza dough), we don&#39;t usually choose and we eat both. Shhh, don&#39;t tell.

So they&#39;ve added another table and a few more chairs which is good especially for the regulars. I&#39;m a proud regular. Us regulars like to stand around and chat like we&#39;re at Cheers...without the beer...and the bartenders...and we like to share our opinions on our favorite foods with the newbies who&#39;ve wandered in. Don&#39;t worry, they won&#39;t be newbies for long. Thus, the reason for more seating. Almost every time that I stop in, I see someone I&#39;ve seen there before and I usually meet someone new who wants to try what Sam&#39;s has to offer. I genuinely love coming in here! Don&#39;t get me wrong...it&#39;s really nothing to look at when it comes to decor. I know that I come back time and again for the tasty food, the great company and the exceptional service. It&#39;s a true hometown eatery that&#39;s growing every day. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they expanded to offer a comfortable dine-in experience for their growing number of clientele one of these days. 

Stop in and try something new. You&#39;ll be glad you did.",01/02/13,428,5,3,5,86,9.7665,8.958,3.1700000000000004,40.87199999999999,No,3456

Great food, good prices, super friendly staff.

As always, Sam was happy to see me!  Noticed a few new things since the New Year.  Sam put up an abbreviated menu of some of his more popular Indian dishes (he&#39;s always made them, just never advertised them).

I got my regular Royal Burger with Jalapeno added (you gotta try this--it&#39;s amazing!).  As always, it was delicious.  I also noticed that he had a 2pc chicken tandoori paratha on his new Indian menu.  I figured what the hell, and went ahead and ordered it.  I&#39;ve never had paratha before, but this was INCREDIBLE.  

Sam was very excited to describe it to me, and from what I gathered, it&#39;s essentially a pita that is cooked with egg batter.  It made it very flaky and flavorful--honestly similar to an egg-roll type of flavor and texture.  Mixed with the already amazing tandoori chicken, it was phenomenal.  

Keeping with tradition, the portion size was also very generous for the price.  

Sam also let me sample his new Hawaiian style spicy pineapple sauce.  I haven&#39;t decided what this is going to be best on, but I think it&#39;s my favorite sauce of his so far.

Enter in Sam&#39;s Grill.

This is a little restaurant located in a little strip in Bartlett (close to Hanover Park).  It is a little difficult to find--especially in the dark--and it just says PIZZA on the roof of the building, not their actual name.  So be on the lookout!!

There are about five seats in this place TOTAL so take-out is probably best!

Anyway, the service here is PHENOMENAL.  I wish there were more stars I could give this place just based on the service and friendliness of the staff alone.  The food was just as good, but I love a place that has a friendly staff and appreciates your business.  You could just tell they were grateful to have the business from the moment we walked in.

OK, so here is what we originally ordered (to be split among three of us)
12 Hell Raiser Wings (for the husband)
Fries
Gyro Dinner
Italian Beef Sandwich
Loaded Cheese Fries
Cup of Chili

Now after we had ordered that, the nice man behind the counter, Nick, brought it to our attention that nobody has made it through 5 of those wings and offered us a taste to MAKE SURE that&#39;s what he wanted (after a burning throat and watering eyes, we determined that NOBODY would enjoy that).  So they made him a spicy buffalo sauce that wasn&#39;t even on the menu.  Talk about service!

But other than that, he was really sweet answering all of our questions and after they saw our burning mouths (yikes), a really sweet guy from the back brought out bread with cinnamon, sugar, and honey on it to calm our palates.  How sweet (literally!)

All of the food was really, really good, too.  There was nothing I was eating that I was thinking &#34;I could use some _____&#34; or &#34;I wish it had _____&#34;.  It was all very, very good!!

My only complaint is that they forgot my chili :(  I didn&#39;t realize it until I got home, so I didn&#39;t want to go back.  But honestly, I am more upset about the fact that I missed out on trying some bomb-ass chili (and I know the chili will be amazing if my loaded fries are any indication!!).

So I can&#39;t wait to go back...and try the chili. :)

sams-grill-and-pizza-bartlett,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,v6kfzO8AhZ-AWrHWkdohxw,"Sam&#39;s Grill &amp; Pizza is a hole-in-the-wall place in Bartlett that sells bar food. Really good bar food.

I took a lunch group from work over there to try it out. The menu is written in chalk on a giant chalkboard, ordered by a giant grid that&#39;s about 10 cells tall by 5 cells wide. It&#39;s not the most readable menu out there, so I scanned the paper menu instead.

I ended up getting a Gyro Burger with fries and a drink. I loved the fries... freshly deep fried russets with a good coating of salt. Not greasy at all! The burger itself was excellent. It consisted of a soft bun around a beef patty, shaved lamb (!), lightly grilled onion, tomato and tzatziki sauce. I liked every bit of it.

Really, what tips this from 4.5 stars to 5 is Sam, who clearly has a passion for good food, chatting up the customers, and chicken wings served with ghost chili-enhanced hot sauce. (He kindly provided a sample: Yowsa-hot, but very good. Same deal with the mango haba̱ero!)

So the next time I&#39;m here, I&#39;ll be getting the wings.

sams-grill-and-pizza-bartlett,Martin S.,M6WDb7H9Dn6xbGcgXYkpjw,#NAME?,"I recommend the Chicken Tandoori... EVERYTHING!  The pita, the prarthana, and yes even the chicken tandoori pizza.  Sams teases with some of the spices and flavors of India on the foundation of the All American Diner.  The combination is WIN!  

I think the name &#34;Sam&#39;s Grill&#34; is a misnomer that evokes the standard hot dogs, burgers and gyros.  Though I would pass by it daily, I had not gone into this place for years thinking it was just another dog &amp; burger joint.  Chicagoland is nothing if not overwhelmed by tons of top notch dog &amp; burger joints already.  

I was astonished to find something so unique and unsuspecting hidden in such a inconspicuous location.  After all, it is small and in an off the beaten path strip mall.  It&#39;s really for pickup &amp; take out as the front doesn&#39;t lend itself to sit down dining.  Although he does have a couple chairs and a stool perched against the wall that is carpet bombed by local merchants business cards and flyers.

The owner and son are very friendly, conversant, and seem to truly appreciate my business.  Though I wouldn&#39;t engage much idle chat during lunch rush.  They do have a steady business to run and the staff is small.

The fusion of flavors I found in this place sets this guy apart from everyone else.  Sam&#39;s Grill delivers on an unusual blend of oddly addictive Indian flavors and spices with traditional American and Greek foods.

I was stunned at how good my first chicken tandoori pita was and it keeps me coming back for more.  I&#39;ve now taken it on as a personal challenge to go down the list of Indian fusion creations Sam&#39;s has to offer and look forward to more creations.  This flavor is unique, weird, delicious, addictive and something I can&#39;t even describe.

I would recommend this to anyone that may think they do not like Indian food due to a bad experience with something a little &#34;too authentic.&#34;  Or perhaps to someone that has an interest and wants to try new Indian flavors but might be intimidated or confused by a completely alien menu at an authentic Indian restaurant that may be a bit much. 
 
I wish for nothing but big success to these guys and hope they expand to another couple more locations soon.",28/07/14,243,4,2,2,30,1.6337000000000002,2.9739999999999998,1.5390000000000001,17.487,No,2249

I ordered well ahead of time and was told that it would be 25 minutes.  I get to the place 32.7 minutes later and was told just &#34;5&#34; more minutes before your order is ready...Sure... I ended up waiting another 15 minutes in the shop as the main guy dillywag with his friend.

No apology, no nothing...that kind of irked me, since it was apparent how much bs his estimate of time was.

Anyways, I ordered the chicken tandoori pizza and wings (buffalo/lemon pepper).

Was not that impressed by the pizza.  Indeed, the crust was...fantastic...not sure how to describe it other than pita-ish.  However, the toppings and sauce was meh.  Confuzzle as to why other yelpers raved madly regarding the pizza when it was...alright.

The wings definitely had an awesome crispy texture, but there is a BUT.  Buffalo sauce was leaning too far on the sour side to the point where I would describe that even BDUBs sauce is better.

Lemon Pepper version though was perfect, so I would recommend the wings definitely, albeit, with a different sauce/seasoning other than buffalo.",20/07/14,130,3,1,2,5,1.2583,1.241,1.0599999999999998,9.698999999999998,No,1113

1) Friench fries with their secret sauce - they are so crispy and goes good with the sauce....these fries are best in town..not exaggerating...
2) Lemon Pepper wings - wowwwwwwwwww...no words to explain and their garlic sauce along with it...never tasted so good anywhere else till now.

First off Sam is a rockstar, makes you really feel like he is making the food for love not for money. 

ok lets start

1.) I had there hottest wings ( forgot the name) I eat spicy but those kicked me in the a$$... but not just heat great taste. 

2.) Pau Bhaji &amp; Pau Bhaji Pizza.. I have been to mumbai 4 times in 2 years and Pav Bhaji might be one of my top 3 street foods, and Sams makes it like Bombay, plus at only 6 dollars a plate. I highly recommend it

3.) Tandoori Chicken Pita or Pizza ... Nothing to say here as a restaurant fanatic I have had Tandoori chicken at every restaurant in 30 miles probably and frankly the 15 dollar plates cant touch his 6 dollar pita , perfectly marinated and just tasty. 

4.) Paneer Roll.... First off this is not paneer you get anywhere you cant buy it , this is proper indian paneer dense and just amazing, I got it spicy and it had just the right amount of burn. 

Sam laughs that he has met half my family cause they have all come in with my recommendation, and not one has told me I was wrong. Our family chef has said his Pav Bhaji is the best she has had outside of Bombay !

sams-grill-and-pizza-bartlett,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,dapaO6IxPE0p0-kVlLTldw,"Having seen a number of Yelp reviews with outstanding feedback of Sam&#39;s Grill &amp; Pizza, I decided to take the risk and make the journey out from my office to Bartlett to pick up some food here on my lunch break. In looking over their options, I saw they had a Chicago style hot dog and knew I had to give this place a try. They have a fairly diverse menu with lots of different kinds of burgers, hot dogs, alongside pizza, wings and other common to these kinds of establishment menu items like Gyros and Italian beef sandwiches. 

Sam&#39;s is located in a small heavily deserted strip mall off of Prospect avenue in Bartlett. When you walk in there&#39;s a long counter, a cooler with various types of beverages to your right. And a big menu board on the wall to your left. There&#39;s a few tables and a counter if you were to eat in the restaurant itself. A while after stopping in (more on this later) I was ready to leave with the food ordered for myself and my co-workers.

On to the review of the food itself. The hot dog I received came on a Chicago-style poppy seed bun. The bun didn&#39;t seem to be steamed, but was soft and showed no signs of dryness. There was a thinly sliced pickle on top of the dog, this pickle slice was a bit more sour than I would like, but certainly didn&#39;t taint the flavor of the hot dog. There were two long sport peppers perfectly placed on top so that sport pepper could be had in every bite. The peppers were a good balance of being not too hot and providing the right amount of flavor. The tomato on this hot dog was a bit of a downer, it was slightly soggy and didn&#39;t cover the entire length of the hot dog. The big problem with this hot dog was the relish, it wasn&#39;t the brand, it was the amount. There was around 2 dogs worth of relish on this hot dog. As a result the relish flavor was the dominant taste here. It overpowered both the mustard and what onion was on the hot dog. As for the sausage itself, it was a skinless dog, it was properly steamed and prepared. There was some celery salt on the dog, but its flavor was again, overpowered by the excessive relish. Overall, this wasn&#39;t a bad hot dog, but it was definitely a bit unbalanced.

The final subject to note on Sam&#39;s is the time it took for the order to be ready, Between myself and my co-workers there were two burgers, a hot dog, and fries for the two burgers that needed to be made. This took around a half hour from when I placed the phone call to when the food was ready a ways after I arrived. Overall I liked the food and might be back, but for the investment of time it took for my food to be ready I wouldn&#39;t say this is quite a five star establishment. I give Sam&#39;s Grill &amp; Pizza four stars. My opinion on this establishment can best be summed up in the following rhyme.

Good, but not great and be prepared to wait.",19/12/12,312,4,1,5,-29,5.1353,2.5309999999999997,0.7649999999999999,24.704,No,2875

aris-kitchen-north-aurora,Ryan B.,4z_fa3OYaBLAgQgTx_wk8w,ceKTET-WuF-0n1ZoMcMS8w,"Ari&#39;s Kitchen is that rare experience where every aspect  makes it profoundly different from dime a dozen breakfast spots on every corner. Do yourself a favor and take a road trip to this hidden treasure and be prepared for a foodie experience well worth writing about!!!

This little sits in an unassuming location, a basic strip mall in North Aurora. For however modest it appears on the outside, it plays amongst the champion food experiences on the inside.

Greeted by Ari himself, you&#39;ll quickly find yourself immersed into his world as you sit down and begin pouring over the menu. While options of all sorts greet you, the menu is actually simplistic at the foundation level and then you make it uniquely your own with the sides and add-ons.

What is apparent is how much of the menu is homemade, made from scratch right there. Fresh ingredients galore spread across the rest of it with huge portion sizes ready to grace you with their presence. 

There is also that unique feel that the environment creates. You feel at home. I always get a feeling of just wanting to sit and relax for well over an hour. I rarely get that anywhere in my life because I&#39;m high strung. Here I&#39;m made to feel welcome, wanted, and encouraged to stay. It is eating in your uncle&#39;s kitchen!

What to Eat
1. The Foundational Experience: Mr. Steak Omelette with hashbrowns, Home Made Pumpkin Pancakes, and sausage 
2. The Adventure Experience: Egg Mountain (minus ham) with HomeMade Pumpkin Pancakes
3. The Unexpected: Breakfast Burrito | HomeMade Cinnamon Apple Oatmeal with HomeMade Biscuit
4. The Kids/Picky Ones: Home Made Pumpkin Pancakes

First Timers
1. Seat yourself
2. You have all you need at your table
3. Fancy views, menus, and servers are not the experience. Exceptional recipes, personalized orders, and fresh ingredients served with efficiency and care.
4. Ari wants to get to know you. He will meet you and talk with you. If (and you will) return, he will remember you!
5. Specials are just that... great ideas for you. These are not &#34;we need to use up ingredients so let&#39;s call it our special&#34;

Tips
1. Portion sizes are huge
2. Go with the HomeMade pieces on menu (H.M.)
3. FirstTimer: Ask Ari for a recommendation. He takes his time and will really work you through a custom experience
4. Get a table starter! For example, get an order of H.M. pumpkin pancakes for the table to share as an appetizer
5. HomeMade biscuits come with homemade jams - tremendous tasting experience!
6. Breakfast is so good that it is easy to forget they do lunch
7. The &#34;Combo&#34; is a great way to experience Ari&#39;s for the first time as is &#34;Comfort Food&#34;
8. Best way to navigate the menu is to realize almost all options are the same so it is the foundational piece you need to start with. In other words, nearly everything has eggs, griddle, and meat but you can start your build from an omelette or skillet or you could start with pancakes or French toast :-)

Thanks Ari for being the best breakfast spot in the Chicago burbs!",21/06/16,355,5,2,5,27,9.201,3.7030000000000003,0.027,21.270000000000003,No,3062

Ari&#39;s  = God of Breakfast

200 reviews for a family-owned, &#39;morning meal&#39;-type spot is generally a sign of positive word-of-mouth.  I came here one day of my own accord, but had someone told me about Ari&#39;s, I&#39;d now be thanking them.

Located on Randall Rd in North Aurora, Ari&#39;s Kitchen shares a small strip mall with a doggy spa, veterinarian, nail salon, and gyro place.  It&#39;s very unassuming from the outside, but inside it&#39;s a beehive of activity.  So busy in fact, that I decided on dining &#39;al fresco&#39; during a very mild bit of weather on a Sunday morning in late February.

The chairs outside were pretty damn uncomfortable, but each table had hot sauce on it, so that&#39;s something.  Menus appeared to have been designed on a Commodore Amiga 500 and printed on an Epson dot matrix (formatting was wonky and typefont looked dated).  A few minor errors, smudged ink from waterglass condensation, why Ari&#39;s doesn&#39;t laminate their stuff, I have no idea.

Our server was quick to greet us and had lots of charisma.  All of the servers looked like hipsters (which normally I would hate), but they managed to pull it off.  Every waiter/waitress wore a spiffy hat and took orders on their phones, an interesting twist.  Shortly after getting our orders in, we were given a bowl of fresh fruit &#34;on the house&#34;.  Apparently, instead of providing the industry standard bread &amp; butter to customers, Ari&#39;s prefers to dole out Dole!  (hehe fruit pun)  I neglected to take a photo, stupid me.

Unsurprisingly, Caty D ate all the good stuff like banana wheels and juicy melon balls, leaving me with a funky, fuzzy 1/4 kiwi and some weird ass blackberries.  I really liked the idea of  fresh fruit as &#39;a petit dejeuner&#39;; it&#39;s something I&#39;ve never seen done before in a restaurant.

Once the food arrived there was even less to complain about.  My combo featured eggs sunny-side, homemade hashbrowns, a single large pancake......and 5 slices of extra crispy bacon.  FIVE.  For those of you counting at home, that&#39;s more than double what most breakfast joints offer--some may serve as many as 3, but that&#39;s usually pushing it.

If I&#39;m being honest, the homemade hashbrowns weren&#39;t my cup of tea.  This was mostly due to the prevalence of raw onions and large, chunky potatoes.  The green peppers were nice, but I much prefer thinly shredded &#34;hash&#34; browns over breakfast potatoes, as these were definitely of the latter variety.

Don&#39;t ask me why, but Caty D ordered some monstrosity called &#39;Egg Mountain&#39;.  It was pretty much everything I got, but smothered in biscuit gravy.  Came with a defibrillator on the side.

We were here for a late brunch on a Sunday and they were packed.  Despite the short wait, we got seated pretty quickly because the staff were working their butts off.  Everyone was wearing cowboy hats for some reason and there were beach umbrellas inside?  Let&#39;s just say the decor is quirky.

The breakfast stuff looked amazing, but we were feeling lunch.  My husband and I went halfsies on the meatloaf sandwich and the chicken club.  Both completely hit the spot, but I definitely want to go back for some of the egg dishes.

This is definitely not a fancy expensive brunch spot in the city.  It&#39;s definitely more homey food, which I totally appreciated.  The meatloaf sandwich in particular reminded me of something my grandmother would have made.

Most places don&#39;t do scrambles unless you ask them to  because it&#39;s off the menu. Well, it is  on Ari&#39;s menu, and you can choose 2 or 4 eggs, so you don&#39;t have to take home 1/2 your breakfast if you can&#39;t eat those big 3-egg omelets at other places.   There are so many choices that I haven&#39;t been able to scratch the surface of all that I can pick from for breakfast at this place.  And the food is always tasty!

But the food and service were AMAZING. I ordered something which I believe was called the Most Popular or something like that, a combo of eggs, a bread and a side.

aris-kitchen-north-aurora,Sabrina C.,#NAME?,tpsJVy_FweIryupbX8uzRQ,"So we&#39;ve got a new breakfast spot. 

Ari&#39;s is awesome. Nothing fancy - and it doesn&#39;t need to be. The food is tasty, hot and fresh, Ari is awesome, and all the servers are friendly.

The water came with a cucumber slice. You know, like a spa, except breakfast. After the night I had, I needed hydration. Slammed it. I don&#39;t even like cucumbers, but I love cucumber water for some reason. And this was exactly what I didn&#39;t even know I wanted. 

I tried the Swedish pancakes previously (with lingonberries and a canister of whipped cream, which comes with the pancake accoutrement and is left at the table) and today I had the breakfast panini. Omg. I wasn&#39;t actually THAT hungry and I had to stop myself from devouring the entire thing. It was that good. A panini with pesto mayo, bacon, sausage, cheese and an egg. It&#39;s kind of a miracle my arteries cooperated long enough to let me draft a review. But that being said, I&#39;m totally ordering it again next time. 

Side note: They were super packed today and breakfast was taking a bit longer than usual - so Ari came over (unprompted!) with a bowl of fruit salad (watermelon, honeydew, blueberries, banana, strawberries, etc) and kept the child happy. This was just a cool move, and even though we&#39;ve been here a couple of times now, that turned us into regulars. What a way to take care of your customers. 

Ok, back to the food. Husband and child love the biscuits and gravy here. And they are picky about biscuits and gravy. The biscuits actually have flavor, and the gravy is solid (as in awesome, folks.)  

They encourage substitutions so you can enjoy exactly what you want. Most of them are for no extra charge. They don&#39;t rush you out. There&#39;s a pepper grinder on every table. (A real one... not one of those cheap grocery store two-pack dealios.) And did I mention they bring an entire can of whipped cream to the table for pancakes? Yes? Telling you again. Because awesome. Happiest kid ever with that one.

The outer aesthetics are very unassuming and I couldn&#39;t find a website or menu, so I was skeptical to spend my hard earned/precious lunch break at Ari&#39;s. However, I relied upon my fellow Yelper&#39;s reviews and was pleasantly. Oh, and I found the menu in their Facebook page.

The wonderful Ari, greeted us and was our server. He is really awesome! The inside is rather quaint, but space is optimized pretty well. However, it gets pretty crowded during peak weekend brunch hours, so be prepared.

As for the food, my husband ordered breakfast and I ordered from the lunch menu. We had the best of both worlds and it everything was really good. Each item deserves an individual description:

Pancakes: They&#39;re HUGE (almost as big as the plate) and fluffy/tender. Might be at the top of the
list for good pancakes around here.

Hash browns: Delicious! I usually like the shredded hash browns, these are not shredded and I love them! They are homemade, kinda chunky and cooked perfectly. You can add toppings like onions and peppers as well.

Corned beef hash:Best hash around here....again, made in house from scratch.

Chicken fingers &amp; fries: Yummy! So, the chicken fingers are very different from typical pre-frozen fingers your get from a restaurant. These are straight up homemade fingers, so there is no thick breading. They&#39;re lightly floured and seasoned....what I prefer. The fries are fresh cut and yummy as well.

Soups: we had potato soup and Ari gave us a free bowl of chicken tortilla soup to try. Both tasted great. I usually don&#39;t get tortilla soup, but I would definitely buy it when I go to Ari&#39;s. It&#39;s really good!

Aris kitchen has this magic homemade feel to it, since well everything is homemade! The jams are so good, corned beef hash is amazing. Hashbrowns with peppers and onions are really huge potato chunks. I have tried most of the breakfast menu and half the lunch menu and have not had one thing I did not like. Ever. 

Ari&#39;s is known for breakfast but the lunch is also amazing. The onion rings are fresh and homemade, none of the crap from a freezer that everyone has. It gives them a light and slightly crispy taste, you will love them! The fries are perfect and hot every time. My favorite thing on the menu is the pup-perozzi sandwich, a fancy two cheese grilled cheese with tomatoes, bacon and avocado. The burgers are huge and yummy too.

Please note... it is small and people dinning in take first priority to to-go orders, as it should be. If your order can not be made fast or perfect ari will turn down a to-go order to make sure the people dinning in get great service. I love that!

Looks can definitely be deceiving, but the quality meals that are served from the friendliest people (including Ari himself) here, are priceless. I read all of the great reviews on Yelp and as a Aurora resident I was psyched to check this place out.

My husband and I came in for breakfast on a Thursday morning. Ari&#39;s Kitchen is a pretty small restaurant, although the do have seating outside in the warmer months. There were about 3 or 4 other tables occupied in the restaurant when we were in. 

I immediately loved the homey feel of Ari&#39;s. The coffee mugs were all different, which reminded me of the collection I have at my house. The menus made me do a double take, because they are actually old hard covered cook books with the Ari&#39;s menu pasted inside. Quirky and clever - I like it.

As for the food, everything looked and sounded amazing so it was hard to choose. I finally decided on the California Dreamin&#39; benedict. Anything with avocado typically wins me over, and boy it did. This benny was awesome! 

I chose fruit and my side and let me tell you, &#34;side&#34; is a loose term, but I&#39;m not complaining! The amount of fresh fruit that came with my Benedict was insane! I&#39;m talking a whole banana was included alongside apples, grapes, dried fruit, pears - the works.

Other bonuses of this magnificent breakfast adventure? Cucumber water. Pitchers of fresh cucumber water are served at the table. Love it. Also, Ari will more often than not be your server! I think that is so cool and of course he has all of the knowledge of his own restaurant and what they offer. Ari is super friendly and is literally the definition of amazing customer service.

Most of the tables were taken but it is a relatively small place. We went through the menu looking at what to feast upon. A quick minute later we were greeted by Ari himself. Ari is the heart of this place, and you can tell how much he stands behind his baby. He welcomed us and went over a few things on the menu that we might be interested in. Everything sounded so good and after a few more minutes we finally placed our order.

My wife went with a breakfast panini that was loaded with bacon, sausage patty, over easy egg, cheddar cheese, and sourdough bread. She got a side of fruit which is beyond generous. She loved the sandwich. It was enough to feed both of us, and honestly, I have never seen a side of fruit with such variety and portion! I went with the biscuits and gravy. It came with a side of hash browns. Ari asked if I wanted green peppers and onions added to the hash browns, uh yeah! Everything was decedent. It was so fresh and you could taste that it was all made from scratch (which Ari confirmed). My plate was loaded with 5 fresh from scratch biscuits drowning in a thick country gravy that was perfectly seasoned.

My husband ordered scrambled eggs and corned beef hash which was home made and fantastic.  He also had toast that came with home made orange marmalade and home made strawberry jam.  My husband isn&#39;t a huge breakfast fan but he loved this and can&#39;t wait to come back.

While you are waiting for your food Ari brings you a bowl of fresh fruit mixed with dried dates and figs.  Very nice touch!

I def enjoyed the complimentary fruit to start. My fave of what was ordered was a pumpkin pancake and the breakfast panini. Both were so amazing and worthy of a drive from Chicago to aurora. Didn&#39;t enjoy the California skillet as much. Would definitely stop by again thanks ari.,21/09/16,43,4,2,3,26,2.7306999999999997,2.1700000000000004,0.6599999999999999,4.1690000000000005,No,370

Ari&#39;s isn&#39;t that easy to get to, but when you walk in, you&#39;ll most likely find Ari talking to customers. The place is very small, only about 14 tables, but it definitely has that quaint family-run feel to it.  You&#39;ll most likely find Ari taking the orders himself, serving up food, as it appears he has only two other staff--a chef and someone who appears to be a daughter or granddaughter. 

Because of its size and small staff, the place isn&#39;t very tidy--there was a tower of condiments either on or next to each table, which made it feel somewhat claustrophobic, and the floor was in need of some serious sweeping--crumbs everywhere. The tables were filthy, as were the cluttered menus. It suffers from a lack of spacial organization, due to its small size, and clearly needs to be reorganized.

Since it was my first visit, I was given fresh fruit on the house. Although my bowl wasn&#39;t that fresh at all (the pineapple looked like it had been sitting out for 3 days. I was there around noon on a Wednesday. 

I ordered the combo, which consists of your choice of a bread (waffle, French toast, Swedish, regular or pumpkin pancakes); a side (eggs or hashbrowns); and a meat. I got the regular pancakes, homemade sausage patties, and the homemade hashbrowns. The pancakes were huge-almost as big as my upper torso-but fluffy. I can honestly say that these are among the best pancakes I&#39;ve ever eaten, and I&#39;ve tried a lot. The sausage was clearly homemade and a huge portion. It was a little on the salty side and there was something amiss about the flavor--almost artificial. I asked about the spices, and although they are &#34;a secret,&#34; Ari told me that there is a combo of seven different spices that they use. The hashbrowns were not has towns at all. They were made from a baked potato smashed (skin and all) and fried up with a little bit of pepper. Clearly authentic, but very bland. 

I didn&#39;t get to try their lunch options, but I did get a glimpse of their giant onion rings, soups, and sandwiches from other patrons. For the food, I give it 3.5-4 stars. But due to the clutter, dirty tables and menus, and lack of a clean floor, I knock off one star.",02/07/16,258,3,1,2,-22,1.4745000000000001,1.794,0.6970000000000001,19.508,No,2231
aris-kitchen-north-aurora,Tyler K.,UUDPtM0nKFLEmFheFSIEBw,50kdLcGfQ2Z7WhFslkBHcA,"Let me first start by saying this place is way over priced and the portions are extremely small. I came here with my family today 02/27/16 and this was our 2nd visit. On our 1st visit we didn&#39;t have any issues but the prices were alot lower than they are now. 

My wife and two kids were extremely hungry and I ordered a banquet skillet the small portion for $8.39. I knew it said small portion but the regular portion was $10.29 and didn&#39;t feel like paying that for a breakfast meal. When my food was brought to the table, I thought they made a mistake, my breakfast was literally packed in what looked like a cup of soup bowl.

I&#39;m not joking when I say this but I finished my entire meal in 3 bites, that is how much food was given to me for $8.39. My wife decided on the half order of bucuits and gravy combo, which came with one biscuit, one egg and a very small portion of hash browns. Her meal was $6.39 and the biscuit wasn&#39;t even covered in gravy and she wasn&#39;t even filled. 

The kids wanted the pancakes combo which was a very large portion of pancakes but the bacon came out over cooked and the hash browns were such a small portion and there meal was $10.29. I think the food here has great flavor and they cook with care but the owner needs to learn how to portion the food accordingly to price. I spent almost $40 dollars on breakfast and my family walked out still hungry because of the portion sizes. I could of went to a steakhouse and stuffed myself for the price I spent here. 

The owner needs to stop letting the review get to his head and focus on his customers and portions. He must be making a ton of money off idiots that continue to spend $11 for a plate of nothing. America wake up and stop letting restaurants like this rip us off. If you want a good breakfast go to Oswego family restaurant, they have great prices and the portions are just right.",27/02/16,203,2,2,1,35,0.27690000000000015,0.75,0.658,15.591999999999999,No,1897

We stopped in for brunch, which started with a good cup of coffee.  I had the California Skillet with avocado, bacon, tomato, and mozzarella.  I also had the Rye toast with their homemade raspberry jam.  The orange marmalade was good too.

Ari&#39;s is a small place with a big menu; omelets, benedicts, pancakes, skillets, burgers, wraps - I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t go wrong.

All food is home-spun with a flair for the tasty. I had low expectations for finding a restaurant in Chicago&#39;s suburbs. Ari&#39;s totally over-performed and was absolutely wonderful. 

Ari recognized that his menu is huge and extensive. He also recommended a smaller portion size for a fella wearing form-fitting clothes who is somewhat overweight (me). I love that Ari did this; the smaller portion was exactly what I needed to prevent a food coma before my Monday work day. 

This location is a hole in the wall place; but the food is high quality. Once inside the restaurant, it is tastefully decorated and simple and clean. It has a homely feel with a tilt to the eccentric personality that Ari brings.

Ari greeted us and is a very nice guy, but honestly, the food is not that good.  Our meal came with a house salad.

aris-kitchen-north-aurora,Jennifer S.,mYvZwQ3T5JzqwOyURQWA_w,GdfEInH6oUlMWYwJupystA,"Rarely do I choose a new spot suggested by Yelpers and find they were wrong.  Ari&#39;s Kitchen proved this point once again!  SCORE!!  We were headed to the Aurora Outlet Mall and wanted to try something different for breakfast.  I read through a few reviews, ran a map and we were on our way to Ari&#39;s.  The map did cause some confusion with an unnecessary u-turn, but we saw Ari&#39;s up ahead and ended up ignoring the GPS at that point.

We walked up and saw a few tables set for dining on sidewalk.  It was nice to know that this was an option.  When we opened the door, we were immediately greeted by a server and allowed to sit wherever we wanted.  At the table, we found cookbooks (that confused the heck out of my husband and son!), but since I had read ahead a little, I knew that I would find the menu inside.  Ah, the menu...it is vast!  And loaded with information.  We wanted to try everything.  It took us quite a while to make our decisions and when we finally did, here&#39;s what we tried:

Homemade breakfast sausage patty - This was a fan favorite and we would come back based on this alone!

Mashed potatoes - I loved these!  They were obviously made with loving care as they had a few little lumps, but were so fresh and delicious.  An excellent choice if I do say so myself.

Farmer&#39;s Skillet (I think) - Served over a healthy serving of hand cut hash brown potatoes, every bite of this disappeared.  This was easily a successful dish.

Pancake (just one as a side, but look at the size of that thing!) - Huge!  Obviously not a box-mix or some pre-made boring batter.  This reminded me of my mom&#39;s kitchen, but it was from Ari&#39;s Kitchen and it was delightful.

Sausage gravy &amp; biscuits - Share this, or get a half order.  This was waaaay too much food, but the fresh biscuits were fantastic and the gravy was a winner.

Poached eggs &amp; a side of hash browns - Eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns arrived with a cup of gravy (like you would imagine with mashed potatoes).  These large chunk of fresh potatoes were so good that I had to snag a bite or two until my husband mixed the eggs in of course.

Turkey sandwich on white bread - While the turkey was obviously roasted and cut right off the bone recently, the sandwich was completely cold.  I had not thought this through at all.  I expected toast even though the menu didn&#39;t stay toast, so that&#39;s my fault for not asking for toast.  The turkey had definitely been chilled in the fridge, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it were hot instead.  The quality was there, but I was the goofball imagining things the menu did not say.

Side salad - I chose the salad instead of the soup (surprisingly) because I wasn&#39;t thrilled at the soup options.  The salad was quite large and served nice and cold.  The dressing was good and the cucumbers/tomatoes were fresh.  The lettuce wasn&#39;t very thrilling - it&#39;s lettuce and it worked, but this was probably the only thing that hit the table that wasn&#39;t great.  

The glasses were kept full, the restaurant was clean and had an open kitchen concept.  We met Ari right away and he&#39;s a really nice guy who&#39;s hustling and bustling to make sure everything is up to par.  For a Monday morning, the crowd was very diverse and there were plenty of customers to keep them on their toes.  I cannot imagine a weekend morning here, but seeing as we don&#39;t often have the opportunity for a weekday breakfast and we loved it so much, I think we will find out what a weekend morning looks like soon!

The parking lot is shared with a few other businesses including a drive-thru.  Don&#39;t accidentally try to go the wrong way down the one way drive thru lane.  Basically, you can only go out the same way you came in.  So keep that in mind. 

Bottom line... Ari&#39;s Kitchen was awesome!  Virtually everything tasted fresh, the service was impeccable and the food seemed like it was straight from my mama&#39;s house.  Check out this local gem!",14/10/14,442,5,3,5,73,9.784299999999998,7.734,1.7660000000000002,38.49900000000001,No,4025

The egg scramblers and omelets are basically the same. Scrambled eggs should be lite, fluffy &amp; buttery. My Scrambler was a spitting image of a dried out overcooked Omelet. However, serve a fresh fruit cup with a crisp blueberry...let the dazzle begin!

aris-kitchen-north-aurora,Roberto H.,LJhj78TyHrsu3buWTQkWQg,r4lOvksp4nWIEuEhkVsJTQ,"I went here with my girlfriend for breakfast and we had two different experiences. We came here because we have heard some good things about this place.
    When we first walked in we noticed that it was a lot smaller than we expected, but it had a small country diner feel to it. The hostess was really sweet and we felt welcomed to be there. They do have waiters but Ari, who is the owner, is the only one who takes orders and he is the only one who takes the bill which was a bit unusual.
   When Ari came to take our order he was friendly but my girlfriend felt that he was rushing her a bit. I can see why she felt that way. He was very straight forward and fast in taking orders. I liked it, but when you go to a homestyle type of restaurant then you expect your waiter to not be so quick paced. 
    I ordered the biscuits and gravy with homemade hashbrowns and my girlfriend ordered the veggie skillet with scrambled eggs with toast and a side of grits. My biscuits and gravy were very good. You can tell they treat the biscuits and gravy as a main dish and not just a side dish. The hashbrowns were unbelievably good and I would definitely recommend them to anyone going there. They are perfectly seasoned and are cooked in onions and green peppers. 
   As for my girlfriend&#39;s food it seemed to be just the opposite. Her skillet was full of vegetables  but they were not seasoned and tasted bland. Also the presentation was not the strongest. Over the veggies they threw on a slice of cheese, it wasn&#39;t shredded. It was just a lice thrown on top of the veggies. I tried the grits and it was awful. The grits were watery, flavorless and just really bad. 
    Overall it was a tale of two cities. My food was good and my girlfriend&#39;s was pretty bad so it was an average experience. I read that Ari comes around and talks with everyone and is really friendly, but to us he made us feel a bit rushed. Maybe it&#39;s become so popular that he doesn&#39;t have that extra time he had when he first started.

Well we pull off and look for a place. It took some time but once yelp showed us this place we decided to give it a go. And I for one am very happy we did.

Ari is an extremely nice guy who made us feel like regulars right away. After he took our order he asked us if we ever tried his soups. When we said that this was our first time in, he decided to give us cups of two different of his soups. I was very impressed with the soups. The minestrone was full of vegetables and was just plain good. My wife tried the chicken noodle and she was also very happy with her selection.

We decided to split a Greek salad and a grilled cheese with bacon, avocado, and tomato. The salad was huge with a nice whole chicken breast on top. I really wouldn&#39;t change anything on the salad at all. The grilled cheese could have used a little more bacon (but knowing me I would say that about anything).

We arrived at around 10 and there were 2 groups ahead of us. The place is so tiny there really isn&#39;t anywhere to stand and wait. It was chilly out so waiting outside was not an option for me. We waited around 15 min to be seated. We were offered menus to look over while we uncomfortably stood next to the other people waiting. 
We were seated at a booth which I was glad for because I noticed that the tables are all very close  together and in some cases you could end up sharing your table with strangers. The place itself is cute, nothing fancy at all, very cozy and no frills. The waitstaff was all teens and the person taking the orders is the owner himself, Ari. 
We were brought over glasses of ice water with cucumber, very nice touch, I love cucumber water.  I also ordered coffee which was very much needed and it was nice and strong. 
We waited about 10 minutes for the owner to finally make his way to us and take our order. I went with the chilaquiles with chorizo. My son got the brunch burger which came with a fried egg and bacon and home made fries. My two little ones got the Mickey Mouse pancake. My daughters and I got our meals at the same time but my son had to wait about 5 minutes later to get his meal. My chilaquiles were served with a side of sour cream and they deposited a huge jug of fresh salsa. For my daughters they served the pancake with a can of whip cream. 
Eating out meal was a bit tricky because our table was so small that our plates and glasses hardly fit. I had to pile plates on top of the condiment tray so that we had enough room. 
My meal was good, very flavorful, the chorizo was good and the salsa have it a yummy touch. My girls were happy with their choice. The big winner was my son, his brunch burger looked AMAZING!!! He is a burger fanatic and he was quite impressed with this burger. 
The food was ok, portions were big, I didn&#39;t like that there is no waiting area, the restaurant is a bit congested and having to wait around for the owner to go around every table, taking orders and payments made our time spent there a bit on the long side. After I packed up my left overs we waited about 10 minutes for Ari to come back to our table to take our payment.

They make the corned beef hash, jams, sausages, and more by scratch. He and my daughter are particularly fond of the corned beef hash. Ari is always friendly and takes the food orders personally. It is nice to have the owner put such a personal touch into their establishment. The wait staff is on the ball and is always there when you need something. The decor is eclectic and homey. Since it is on the small side, there does tend to be a line for this little breakfast place, but my family seems to think the wait is worth it and I have to say that the turnover is quick. 

Today the kids had the Mickey Mouse pancakes, which did not look like Mickey, but were &#34;awesome&#34; and &#34;tasty&#34; according to them. I had the pumpkin pancakes and sausage. Both were good and there was more than enough. My husband had the hobo skillet, which he loved as usual. The prices were good for what we got. We paid less than $40 for a family of 4 with drinks and sides and we had leftovers for later.

We had to wait about 15 minutes which was fine because it seemed as though the staff was turning the tables pretty quickly. They were very welcoming and friendly when we arrived and we took a look at a menu while we waited.

There are a lot of options to choose from. Everything looked as though it was prepared there. I can&#39;t go so far as to say anything was stand out. I ordered an omelette and my friends ordered skillets or regular breakfast items. I will say that I thought the hollandaise on my friends eggs Benedict was pretty good. I&#39;m pretty picky about my sauces.

Again, everything was fine. Good. Just not great and not very memorable. The prices were average and I would view it as an OK value for my money. I probably wouldn&#39;t choose to go back here over other places that leave me remembering something that stood out.

The B&amp;G is outta control. The biscuits have flavor, as opposed to other breakfast joints who give you nothing to savor. The gravy........aww yiss. I got the FARMERS BENEDICT. The sausage patty, wow, really really tasty.
The skillets were slightly small, in comparison to  other places. But to make up for this, Ari himself gave us an extra pancake on the house. A truly nice, welcoming owner.

We found it! Ari&#39;s Kitchen is amazing. Ari is such a great person and very friendly. His staff is attentive and the food is so fresh and tasty. If is such a change of pace to find a place that makes food with high quality ingredients and then allows you to taste the amazing flavors by not over salting it. 
There are so many great touches to this place- all condiments are on the table including hot sauce, if you order coffee you get a freshly brewed carafe so you can refill any time with flavored cream at the ready and a wait staff that caters to your every need. He even has fun with the specials menu as evidence of this past weekend&#39;s &#34;SAMCRO&#34; specials as a tribute to the Sons of Anarchy TV Show.
The soups are to die for, and if you are lucky you will be there on the stuffed pepper soup day, the food is so fresh- I have been partial to the skillets  and the fabulous cubano sandwich but have not found a klinker in on the menu yet. I&#39;m not a big pancake guy, but the pumpkin pancakes have made a believer out of me- you don&#39;t even need the freshly made cinnamon butter that comes with it.
Everything is freshly made including the bbq sauce which is fabulous on the shredded pork, he makes his own jellies and uses Oberweis dairy products and fresh Gonnella bread. Even the fries are freshly cut and made to your order and he refuses to over salt things.
The only thing negative I could say is that the menu does take a bit to get used to. But after a couple times, you know just where to find what you are looking for.
We have been there many times in the past few weeks and is a great place to grab a quick lunch as well as a great Sunday breakfast. The prices are reasonable for the amount and high quality food you get. 
We expect a line or to wait. I haven&#39;t figured out why waiting for great food upsets people so much. That is a sign of a great place to eat if people are willing to stand in line for it. You shouldn&#39;t penalize a restaurant for serving high quality food. All the 5 star reviews don&#39;t lie-

I don&#39;t mind the crowd so much as they do my favorite meal of soup and sandwich better then any other place in this neighborhood.

The key to good soup and sandwich starts with the soup.  They make their soups fresh every day.  They are so good, and I think I remember the menu saying they stay away from corn starch.  Which is excellent in my book.

Speaking of books, their menus are all inside cook books.  The first couple of pages they tape or glue a menu in them.  Very creative.

Their menu is a little hard for somebody like me with ADD to get through.  As I&#39;m sure sure how it&#39;s really laid out.

And I guess my only big gripe about this place is they don&#39;t have a website with an online menu.  I can&#39;t go their for lunch during the week for this reason.

I only get a half an hour and by the time I&#39;d go their look over that menu, place an order, wait for the food to be done it&#39;s already over my time.

I noticed they sometimes put the soups on their FaceBook page, but to me that&#39;s not a great option as I don&#39;t wanna be busted checking out FaceBook at work.

The service here is great.  They might get a little frazzled when busy but who doesn&#39;t.",12/05/14,133,4,1,5,-8,4.591900000000001,3.6690000000000005,0.21699999999999997,14.113999999999999,No,1263

It seems to be new, since I&#39;m pretty sure it was something different less than a year ago. 
Ari was our waiter, and apparently the owner as well.
The setup inside is small, and has a country type feel. However, if you can &#34;not judge a book by it&#39;s cover&#34; then you can genuinely appreciate this restaurant. It&#39;s not set up like a 5 star restaurant, but the low cost, customer service, and delicious food make up for it.
I honestly don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve had better service. Anywhere. We&#39;ve had $100 meals where the service wasn&#39;t as good as the service we received here.
First of all, my breakfast was $4.95. 2 eggs, delicious homemade hash browns, and raisin toast. My fianc̩ had 2 eggs, bacon, and french toast for $7.95. Very cheap!
And, it was delicious. The eggs were buttery and fantastic. They also make their own butter and various jams.
There are stencils on the wall that say things like &#34;We don&#39;t own a microwave&#34; or &#34;we don&#39;t use added salt&#34; which is a little odd. That being said, you can tell they take pride in their food. It is a great home cooked meal. 

Also, when we had finished our meal, he asked if we were full and had enough. He asked us if we wanted refills...on our food! It was crazy for us to be so welcomed and we felt that was a grand gesture that he really wanted to make the customers happy. 

I definitely recommend anyone to visit here!",05/03/14,179,5,2,5,29,6.964699999999999,4.409999999999999,0.522,18.067,No,1522

The best Biscuits and Gravy I have ever had. This is a cozy small restaurant with 25 tables. A nice plate of fresh fruit including pineapple, plumbs, apples, bananas and dates.

Where the magic really happens is when Ari come&#39;s in person to take your order. He is as pleasant and warming as the food he serves.

The most organized, precise, consistent and systematic restaurant I have ever seen.
Ari&#39;s does not have a microwave, only uses real whipped butter, and will change your mind with how you look at breakfast.

Ari is a observer who see&#39;s all and a great judge of character. He knows just what to do to make your experience the best experience as he read&#39;s people well.

This is important and why his food is so great, Ari understands people and knows what people like.

olde-north-pancake-house-west-chicago,Rose D.,FqHNMGc_-BgX4svll0SwLg,i-08gTvgj9ac3asg_Z27xg,"We were incredibly impressed by our first visit!  Everyone on staff when we visited Saturday morning for breakfast was incredibly friendly and helpful.  The owner introduced himself and said the restaurant has been in his family for 40-some years (I forget the exact number) &amp; he is the 2nd generation running it. He went over the menu with us since it was our first time in.  The servers appeared to be mostly younger folks but they were the sweetest &amp; most attentive younger servers I have ever encountered! When the diners next to us left one of the young gentlemen was training another employee how to properly clean off the tables and explained to, &#34;be sure to take everything off the table top before you wipe it down completely and don&#39;t forget to wipe the edges of the table.&#34; I was quite impressed with the attention to detail (you would hope all restaurants take as much care in cleaning thoroughly between diners but we all know that doesn&#39;t happen all the time at other places).

I had the Western Omelet with home fries &amp; toast and the Hubs had pancakes.  The ingredients in my omelet were very fresh and the veggies were cooked perfectly (still with a little crispness and not mushy).  The home fries were cooked perfectly as well.  The pancakes were clearly homemade from scratch. The owner had mentioned that when going over the menu but the truth is in the taste and those were some fantastic buttermilk pancakes! Given their name they have quite a few specialty pancakes to choose from but not quite so many egg options...okay, they have egg options but I guess I am used to being overwhelmed with option overload of omelettes &amp; skillets at other places. One thing that was different is you don&#39;t have the option of toast or pancakes with the egg meals like you see at most other places. I&#39;m guessing this is because their pancakes are completely from scratch and not just from some premade batter.  They do have a combo meal option that does come with pancakes, however, so if you want both that is the way to go.  Their coffee was great, too.  Their was a bit of a mixup with the coffee as we had both ordered the regular but our second cups were refilled with the caramel flavor coffee, but I think someone just made the caramel one in the wrong pot by accident. No biggie, it happens.  I&#39;m not sure if it was due to that little mixup or if it was because it was our first time but the manager brought over a single strawberry crepe for us to try as well on the house. Wow - I&#39;m glad he did because that was one of the best fruit crepes I&#39;ve had! The crepe flavor was perfect and the strawberry compote was clearly homemade (not the sickeningly sweet jam type stuff or just defrosted strawberries in sugar syrup you get at most places).  I&#39;m usually an egg person but I think I&#39;ll have to order crepes the next time we visit!  They have a Friday night fish fry (starting after Labor Day I believe) and the rest of the menu looks good so I can&#39;t wait to give them a try for some other meals.  Perhaps I&#39;ll even be upping them a star to 5-star status after visiting them more than once.

The location, while on a busy road, is off on its own not in an area with other shopping/dining options so it would be easy to overlook when considering your dining options.  The decor is country and reminded me a bit of Cracker Barrel but with a even more homey feel.  The only thing that took away from the country decor was they have fliers for new offerings &amp; specials just thumb-tacked to the wall around the place...it would be better for them to print a few &amp; pop them in some inexpensive frames &amp; hang them up in a couple places. Or just keep it on the big specials board near the front.",29/08/16,364,4,2,5,37,8.081800000000001,4.058000000000001,0.861,24.08,No,3782

The service is always good, the dishes always clean, and the food is always legit.  Their seasonal pancakes are great. The pumpkin  (of course) in the fall was good but this winter&#39;s ginger snap pancakes are amazing. 

The food is slightly more expensive than Cracker Barrell or any of the Greek diners, but it&#39;s also a lot better quality. Nothing I&#39;ve had has ever been greasy or cooked poorly.  The steak in the steak skillet is great compared to most places.

Finally, after years and years of driving by, I decided to give it a shot!

Right off the bat, we were greeted by the owner of the restaurant. As a first time patron of the business, the owner explained the whole menu. He broke down the specials, along with what are the most popular meals at Olde North. 

I decided to get the &#34;Country Breakfast&#34;, which the owner claimed to be their most popular item. I&#39;m happy to say I was not disappointed! The food was great, everything was cooked quickly and thoroughly. The caramel coffee is a must try, this is coming from someone who very seldom drinks coffee. Their pancakes are made fresh and not from batter, everything was extremely fresh!

The decor of Olde North is definitely old and outdated, though it does give you that feel of having Sunday breakfast at your grandparents. The seating is comfortable and not overcrowded. You are also able to hold a conversation without having to yell across the table at each other.

Anyway, the food was truly fantastic. I made my own omelette with ham, onions, and mozzarella cheese. Since I don&#39;t usually pick mozzarella I didn&#39;t know what to expect. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised! Not only was the mozzarella a good choice, but the ham was juicy and the onions were fresh, and the eggs were light and fluffy. The hash browns that came with it were great. We also split an Oreo pancake, which management offered to us on the house with no prompting, and we really enjoyed it!

My old man and I came in on a Saturday morning before running errands, we didn&#39;t have our kids with us so we wanted to enjoy ourselves-and we did. I&#39;m glad I wore my yoga pants. 

To start off...you should get the coffee. The caramel roasted one. I don&#39;t drink coffee on a regular basis, and usually when we&#39;re out it&#39;s just one cup...I had three. Seriously, get it. 

I had a half order of biscuits and gravy, turkey bacon, one pumpkin pancake and scrambled eggs. 

The old man had the country fried steak, turkey bacon and one strawberry pancake. 

First off...I was STUFFED. The portions were great, everything in that kitchen is made from scratch-right down to the pancake mix and buttermilk that is used for them. The gravy itself is also made out of hog that they cut themselves and absolutely delicious.

The syrups were thick and REAL, the strawberries extremely fresh, and I couldn&#39;t stop sopping up the gravy with whatever I could.  

You can truly taste the difference and the quality of the food compared to other places. I see several reviews about the levels of grease/butter etc on things...it&#39;s a good &#39;ol family owned breakfast place, it&#39;s not your trendy &#34;egg ____&#34;  so get over yourselves. 

The decor definitely is on the &#34;country&#34; level, the place legit looks like breakfast places down south. There are pictures &amp; trinkets everywhere which I think give the place charm. 

Rick-the owner- was absolutely fantastic. You can truly tell how much he loves the place. He seemed involved in all aspects of the restaurant and we witnessed him talking to every table, seating guests, and running food. 

And of course, as we are sitting there we notice a sign that they make shakes...Oreo &amp; &#34;Shamrock&#34;. I couldn&#39;t help myself...we got a Shamrock shake...and odg it was amazing. 

We will most definitely be back to try out other items on their menu, we honestly had difficulty deciding because everything sounded fantastic.",14/05/14,230,5,2,5,48,7.146199999999999,3.342,0.802,17.857,No,2092

We asked the boy before we even bought the groupon if we could use one each and he asked the owner and somehow the understanding was that they would accept it. 

Later, we were told we could only use one. The owner agreed to make an exception at first and then later went back on his word and  said he would just buy back one groupon and let us use only one. Due to the miscommunication and confusion there was a lot of discussion at our table with the owner and we were okay with all of it until the waitress sat down right behind us and started rolling her eyes in plain view. She made eye contact with me right after rolling her eyes and then walked away. Very disappointing experience.

olde-north-pancake-house-west-chicago,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,8J96jgSQFZaoq0nrRQJ8TA,"On a cold Sunday morning in late January I decided I wanted breakfast. After carefully considering my breakfast options from fast food drive thru windows, to places I know have good breakfast food, to Captain Crunch. I finally decided to take a risk and try somewhere I&#39;ve never visited before. Having passed by Olde North Pancake House many times I&#39;ve had a mental note in my brain for at least a decade to stop by, but for some reason I never have, until today.

Olde North Pancake house is laid out like an old country house. There is a front door with a very tall step before you walk in the door. There are strange arts and crafts decorating the walls and interior. The best description I can give is one not many people can relate to, it&#39;s decorated like my maternal grandmothers house. It&#39;s dark, with a big fireplace in the middle, low to the ground wooden chairs and a comfy atmosphere all around. I noticed price tags on some of the arts and crafts and antiques decorating the place so I assume they&#39;re actually for sale and that they simply didn&#39;t leave the price tags on everything.

Once I came in I was fairly quickly greeted and seated. I looked over the menu closely and noticed that the prices here were considerably higher than most pancake house/breakfast joints. After thoroughly browsing the menu I made my decision to try a Lousiana Skillet. This is a skillet with cajun style ingredients like shrimp, crab meat, andouille sausage and various types of peppers and cheese. What&#39;s somewhat different about Olde North Pancake house than other breakfast joints is that the skillets here do not have pancakes as an option, instead you&#39;re offered toast or a tortillo. I went with a corn tortillo. They also carry Pepsi products, but do not have Mountain Dew which is rather unusual.

A few minutes later my food was ready, and I was ready to snap the cerimonial picture for Yelp and dig in. The skillet was excellent, it was rich in wonderful flavor. While a bit spicy the sausage was great, the crab meat was moist and delicious and the shrimp was fantastic as well though I had to break the hard shelled tails off and eat those individually. The potato pieces had crisp outsides but soft insides, this skillet was perfectly seasoned and fantastic tasting. The tortillo was a little stiff, but besides that and the fact that the shrimp tails were left on I have no real complaints about the food itself. Simply put of all the breakfast places I&#39;ve reviewed this is the best skillet I&#39;ve had anywhere while also being the most expensive.

Overall I was very pleased with my meal at Olde North Pancake house. While the prices are quite a bit higher than most breakfast places the food here was fantastic, I&#39;ll definitely be visiting again and likely be bringing other people with me to try it. Overall this comes highly recommended and if you like cajun style food as much as I do the Louisiana skillet is a can&#39;t miss menu item. I&#39;m going to give Olde North Pancake House a full five stars.",27/01/13,329,5,1,5,-19,6.5194,3.33,0.709,22.962,No,3058

I ask myself that every time I eat here.  Maybe I have been good at avoiding rush hour.  Maybe the place is so big it can accommodate a lot of people.  Maybe they&#39;re fully staffed during prime time.  If Madonna were here, she would say &#34;Olde North Pancake House is a mystery...&#34;  

This place has really grown on me.  I was a little weary my first time since I went around noon on a Sunday and did not see any cars parked in the front.  That suspicion diminished over time since I have not had a bad experience yet.  

The waitresses are always happy to serve, and my coffee cup never goes empty.  I&#39;m not a big coffee drinker, but I do like their caramel coffee.  The decor is very country and it gives me a fuzzy warm feeling.  
The food is always delicious and there are tons of menu items to choose from.  

I had the strawberry crepe special during my last visit and it came with 2 crepes, 3 stripes of bacon, and 2 eggs for just under $8.  I&#39;ve also tried their yummy potato pancakes (and you can get both the apple sauce and sour cream).  They have fish fry on Fridays I have been meaning to try but haven&#39;t gotten the chance to.

-CASH only
-About 4 parking spaces in the front and lots more parking in the back (don&#39;t panic if you don&#39;t see any cars parked in the front)

I had an omelet that was very flat and over cooked.  The scrambled eggs were also very flat.  The side order of blueberry pancakes was undercooked in the middle and not very tasty.

Overall, the restaurant seems very cluttered even to the point that the owner was sitting at one of the tables with paperwork and a computer.  It would be nice if there was an office for the owner rather than having guests watching him doing his own daily duties.

The restaurant also does not appear to be compliant with ADA requirements.  There is one stair to enter the front door which makes wheelchair access difficult if not impossible.  The door to the men&#39;s room is much narrower than a standard doorway making access for disabled persons impossible.

We religiously watch kitchen nightmare with Gordon Ramsey. This place is a serious contender for that show. They were going for eclectic decor but came out a bit sketchy. Not the best impression but whatever. Hopefully the foods amazing...

The food: We got a small order of scrambled eggs and toast. Came out like an omlette. The toast was drenched in butter. Most people nowadays live a healthy lifestyle and there already is butter on the table. Should let us decide if we want butter or not...
Also ordered the spanish omelette. It was okay actually but small portion of eggs and a ton of hash browns. The salsa that it came with literally was pasta sauce. It tasted nothing like salsa. Once again, toast on the side, drenched in butter. 
Lastly we got chocolate chip pancakes. What comes to mind when you order chocolate chip pancakes?

Between my brother, sis-in-law, and I, I think we&#39;ve tried half the menu at this point. Everything has been delicious. They always have a special (usually season themed) pancake. Most recently; gingerbread pancakes with gingersnap syrup. Mmmmm. The caramel coffee is wonderful. Seriously, wonderful. 

You can order a whole bunch of different pancakes in one order. Like, 1 chocolate chip, 1 banana, etc. My sis-in-law loves that option. 

The servers are always very nice and really pay attention. Even when they get busy the servers don&#39;t rush but are still attentive. The decor is wonderfully tacky. It looks like someones crafty grandmother&#39;s garage sale exploded all over the walls. The best part is you can buy the decor right off the walls.

BRING CASH! Or your checkbook. Credit cards are not accepted, but there is an ATM near the entry with a $60 cash limit.

Nice little restaurant on North Avenue in West Chicago (the far west suburb) with good service and a friendly staff. The interior has a country feel to it and seats about 80 to 90 customers. The parking lot is small and may accommodate about 30 cars. I took a chance on going on a late Sunday morning, right before noon, and managed to be seated right away (table for two) in the already-full restaurant.

I chose this restaurant for the pancakes, of course. I asked my server, who happened to be Rick the owner, if he&#39;d recommend the blueberry pancakes or the cinnamon raisin pancakes. He suggested one cinnamon raisin and two blueberry pancakes so that I could try both. So that&#39;s what I ordered, and a side of bacon too. Both types of pancakes had the fruit mixed into the batter and tasted pretty good. Hot blueberries in the pancakes and hot blueberry compote made those pancakes even better.

Three types of syrup were on the table: Maple, Strawberry and Boysenberry. After having the standard maple syrup on my cinnamon raisin pancakes, I tried the boysenberry syrup on the second half of my blueberry pancakes and immediately fell in love with the flavor. Good stuff. Boysenberry... I&#39;m coming back for more!

The grapefruit juice I ordered with my breakfast was excellent. I had to ask my server what brand of juice it was, simply because it was some of the best tasting grapefruit juice I&#39;ve ever had. Not too tart, right amount of sweetness and hardly any pulp at all. He said their supplier is in Florida and guarantees fresh squeezed juice shipped within 3 to 4 days of juicing. It was really good and I&#39;ll probably try the fresh squeezed orange juice next time.

I&#39;ve really only been to the Olde North Pancake House for breakfast, but their menu has a lunch and dinner section too. A sign outside the restaurant notes their Friday Night Fish Fry special. I also saw a sign inside the restaurant noting an upcoming date when they will be serving pumpkin pancakes. So I guess it&#39;s hit or miss when pumpkin pancakes are available, but I definitely want to try those.

Was told what was good for my cold was the sav usal - at least I think that&#39;s what it was called.
Good for my cold! Noodles yum! Soup was good.
But I didn&#39;t get the buns they gave, I mean I get to lessen the heat for those who it&#39;s too hot but I wasn&#39;t feeling them and I felt bad for wasting them I tossed them in the trash I wish the menu was more descriptive cuz I would of told them none please.

When I walked in it was not what I expected, a little sketchy, but what the hell I was hungry! This very nice man was at the counter and suggested I try the dinner special. You get a variety of stuff and he said I would like it. I said cool I&#39;ll take that and an order of samosas please. He didn&#39;t ring me up but told me to take a seat. I walked over to the coolers and looked at all the desserts they have and grabbed a coconut water for my beverage of choice. I sat down and waited and waited. The dude came out with my food and I stood up to pay and he said it&#39;s ok pay later. I liked this guy already! He explained what was on the tray and how to eat it ( for example eat the rice with the soup and dip the bread in the bean dish or whatever I want.) I appreciated that information. I dug in, and wow it was delicious!! Just the right spices, food was so tasty. It tasted homemade to me. Then he brought me a sample of some ball thing to try I liked it!! Thanks dude! The samosas were so amazing!! I can&#39;t rave enough about how good the food was. Ok now on to the best part. I finally went up to the register to pay and for my giant dinner special, samosas, and my drink it was $7 and some change!!! I could not believe the price!

I have to admit I was a bit surprised at the decor/layout - I think I was expecting more of a restaurant.

I had no idea what to order since I don&#39;t know any Indian dishes except for samosas, so went with the Lunch Special. (I wish I could tell you what it included, but I have no clue..)  The woman took my order, but she wasn&#39;t particularly friendly.  Some men came in after me to place orders and they got theirs first.  Not sure if that was typical, or if they pre-ordered..?  There are a bunch of chairs to sit in while you wait for your order.  I waited for almost 15 minutes, though it seems much of the food was made ahead of time and was just being warmed. 

The price was reasonable and the food was good.  The portion size was good, too - I was able to make two meals out of the Lunch Special.  There were varying degrees of spice between the different dishes, which was nice.  It&#39;s clear it&#39;s made right in the back, as I could spy a rice cooker from the doorway.

It&#39;s an Indian snack shop, which sells fresh sweets, loads of snacks, and various Indian sundries (spices, ice cream, frozen food, rice, flours, etc.) It also sells freshly made vegetarian and vegan food. There&#39;s a menu full of standard favorites, such as samosas, paratha, pakora, and puris. Also tea (delicious milk tea), lassi (both plain and mango), and coffee. 

I had the lunch special. Apparently, it changes every day. Today was Monday, and if it&#39;s the same every Monday, anyone who doesn&#39;t do very spicy food would like today&#39;s special. For a mere $6 (as of this writing), you get soup, rice, a hot vegetable dish, a hot bean dish, two kinds of bread (naan and puri), and a little cold salad. As you can see from the photo, it&#39;s a LOT of food. I was hungry when I went, but I still had to take half my food home with me. That&#39;s probably why this place also offers a mini lunch special, which includes all of the stuff I listed minus the soup and rice -- for $3. You read that correctly. I&#39;ll probably get that and a cup of tea next time I go, so I might be able to finish it. Really good food. I&#39;ll also have to try it on a day when spicier foods are offered; I grew up eating both Thai and Indian food, so I&#39;m pretty spice-tolerant. 

The family who runs this place are really nice, and the gentleman behind the counter is very happy to guide you if you need help with any menu items. Not only that, if you eat in, he gives you samples of other stuff to try. Or at least, he did while I was there. In addition to my lunch special, I got to try a delightful methi pakora (little fried puffball made with spinach and besan [chickpea] flour). After I paid and told him how good it was, the cook sent out a little piece of methi paratha (spinach, millet, and corn flatbread) that she&#39;d just made.

The spinach ball pakora things are also excellent and have nicely spiced batter.

vegetarian-fast-food-glendale-heights,Kedar D.,e7V5B3xq3rRNxmABwFKqVw,qzs8qbS4iNbami3g0NnFfA,"This is a Gujarati cafe/grocery store with a large selection of inexpensive vegan Indian offerings, including two vegan (by default) desserts. The owner, D.K., is a really friendly guy and knowledgeable about what is and isn&#39;t vegan on his menu (most of the foods are vegan, whereas most of the desserts are not).

I got a vada pav ($3) which is a potato dumpling placed between a bread roll. This is typical Indian street food in Bombay and I think Vegetarian Fast Food did a good job with it. The dumpling (vada) could have been crispier, but it was nicely flavored.

I also got some dishes for take-out: alu baigan (potato-eggplant) and a cabbage-potato dish. Both of these cost about $3 for a medium-sized portion.

The cabbage-potato dish was excellent: fresh, simple and well-spiced. This is typical Indian home-cooking at its finest.

The potato-eggplant dish wasn&#39;t as good. For one thing, the eggplant didn&#39;t absorb the curry&#39;s flavors enough. Also, the eggplant was kept intact in pieces, rather than being broken apart into a mushier texture; in the case of this dish, a mushier texture would have aided flavor uptake and would have created good contrast with the firmness of the potato pieces. Lastly, I didn&#39;t like the spices on this dish. I think there was too much tomato in the mix and not enough garlic and onions.

There were two vegan desserts when I came: one type of &#34;ladoo&#34; (a fried sugar ball made of flour and spices) and also some other greyish bar-thing. I wasn&#39;t impressed with either, but it&#39;s rare that you find vegan desserts in Indian cuisine, so I&#39;m glad that they&#39;re available, nevertheless.

One final thought: that area of Glendale Heights/Bloomingdale has very few cool cafes and coffee shops. Vegetarian Fast Food could really capitalize on this if it spruced up its interior and offered some nice drinks, such as home-made Indian chai, made with soy, rice or almond milk. If it had more vegan desserts, too, it would be a great hang-out spot.

As it stands, it has a few good vegan dishes at really low prices. If you&#39;re in the area, it&#39;s worth a stop.",26/12/10,262,3,2,5,30,4.2263,2.3230000000000004,1.055,17.623000000000005,No,2142

If we are primarily  rating on how cheap the food is then I would have given it five stars. It had the cheapest Indian food I have had in North America.

I think they may use frozen food for most part, but you can&#39;t blame them since they call themselves &#34;fast food&#34;.  What I did not like was the daal(curry) being lumpy, dosa slightly burnt on top and coconut chutney that looked like it had seen better days.

I recently moved back to the suburbs, and as difficult as that can be, a restaurant like this makes it all the more tolerable.

I first saw Vegetarian Fast Food about a year ago and decided to give it a whirl.  Turns out I walked into a smorgasbord of Indian foods.  The owner was extremely attentive and helped to explain the many options available on the menu.  I ended up with a meal that consistented of 4 or 5 different tasty dishes (Indian food often comes in smaller portions with more variety of foods).

I returned 3 times in the first two weeks following my initial visit.  Also, I mentioned that I had just been married on one trip, and left loaded up with a to-go box full of desserts - free of charge.  The owner told me it was a congratulatory present and that I had to share it with my wife.  Now that&#39;s classy.

Bottom line: I would give it 4.5 stars.  Great food, incredibly reasonably priced, and not a lot of restaurant hassle.  If you like your vegetarian food, and you enjoy Indian cuisine, get over there ASAP.",28/07/10,125,4,2,3,29,2.5627,1.515,0.076,10.408999999999999,No,1092

So I only realized that it was Indian food when I decided to finally go in and check it out. I think they should add that onto the signage, but then again it kind of adds to the mystique of the place.

The owner DK is awesome. He is excited that you&#39;ve found his place and that you like Indian food. He goes out of his way to give you free samples and explain what items they have and is flexible with the lunch special items. It&#39;s no Gaylords but you&#39;ll come away from this place with an ok selection of Indian snack type and more traditional type foods. They have samosas, yellow dal soup, rotis, chickpea/ beans and some unknown vegetable mash-ups. He will give you a variety to try, he&#39;s trying to find out what appeals to his customers most. The masala tea is pretty awesome too. They have seating inside and a small grocery snack area as well as a bakery sweet case. I do have to say the &#34;fast&#34; compared to other fast food is lacking, but then again it is Indian food.

It was possibly the worst Indian food I have ever had. I will agree with others that you get large portions, but at the end of the day when you throw 3/4 of it in the trash because it tastes terrible, you&#39;re really not getting a good value. The chole tasted like canned beans mixed with canned tomato soup. The soup that came with the lunch special was bland and cold. The mango lassi was tiny, overpriced, and not that tasty. The one things we did like was the sambar, but the vada that came with it was extremely dry and flavorless. I would also like to say that vegetarian food can be healthy, but a lot of items here are deep-fried. Potatoes can also be healthy but if you deep-fry them into french fries it sort of defeats the health factor. Just because something is vegetable based does not make it healthy. They did have decent service although they didn&#39;t seem to have the setup needed for a good takeout place, or sit-down for that matter.

So I stopped in because i wanted something fast and something without meat.  To my surprise, it&#39;s actually a small Indian grocery store!?! Oh even better, because I live off of late night Indian (getting out of work and  staying near Devon leave u little choices)

I must have looked confused because the two men behind the counter were very sweet and patient with me. I told them my meat and rice restriction, and that I&#39;m allergic to nuts.  He picked something out for me and I waited for it to come out (it&#39;s only a couple tables and awkward for dine in, so I took mine to go). The owner was so sweet, he even gave me some Spinach Balls on the house... Picture a spicy cornmeal-like batter with spinach mixed in. Delicious. 
I don&#39;t even know what this dish I just ate is called, but it&#39;s filling and flavorful. So I opened the lid and there was cilantro and tomatoes mixed into a yellowish sauce, and chickpeas. The cilantro and lime remind me of Mexican food. But this is awesome, I never quite liked Chick Peas until today. The bread that comes with is like a mixture between naan and paratha...

My husband and I kept getting Pop&#39;s menus and coupons in the mail (and we drove by it often) so we headed there for dinner one night. To our surprise, Pop&#39;s is more than just a sports bar -- there is a small restaurant dining room off to the side. Both are easily accessible from either side of the building.

We were seating at a quiet booth in the restaurant and promptly handed menus and a giant bowl of the most delicious bread I&#39;ve ever had prior to a meal in a restaurant. It was SO GOOD. I nearly ate the whole loaf. For dinner, my husband ordered a rotisserie chicken while I had the fish (I believe it might have been the Friday night fish fry). Both meals were the perfect portion: not too large, but still left you stuffed after finishing off the entire plate. Both meals were also very delicious -- surpsingly so, considering this was just the little dine-in restaurant attached to a bar. Our bill wasn&#39;t too bad either. We left satsified.

Five other people there and they all had their food when I showed up. Ordered a turkey club sandwich and got it 30 minutes later. Let that sink in for a moment. Toasted bread with turkey, mayo, lettuce and tomato took 30 minutes with nobody else ordering food. The bartender even went back several times to check on my food.

Okay, every place deserves a second chance right? Went again tonight and it was busier but not packed. Got my food in about 20 minutes this time but my server spent most of the time sitting at a table with two other servers and a couple of guys. Another server brought out my food to her to bring to me because apparently checking on your customer&#39;s order isn&#39;t something they do on their own? I ended up asking yet another server to get my check and she was the one that rang it up too because mine wasn&#39;t around. 

I heard two servers complain to customers about how slow it was and how they weren&#39;t making any tips. I empathize with that but complaining about it on the floor to customers is not exactly creating a great customer experience.

And this is another reason that I love Yelp!  I went to Pop&#39;s when I was much younger and I&#39;ll always have those memories. And then I visited about three years ago. I didn&#39;t love it. Back a year later. It&#39;s okay. I head back last year for a party and I can see improvement. I Yelp all about it and now over another year later, I&#39;ve decided to give them one more star. 

I still don&#39;t adore Pop&#39;s, but as an official Blackhawks bar with good pizza, decent service and a great location, it works. I&#39;ve tried the wings and like those too. The service gets better with each passing visit so that&#39;s a plus in my book. Our friends love Pop&#39;s so I imagine that we&#39;ll be visiting again soon. And when I do, I&#39;ll enjoy the game with our pizza and wings and I won&#39;t feel bad about supporting this local business.

Obviously the place was packed but hey, it&#39;s a sports bar on game night..they should be packed right? Right away i noticed an attitude with our waiter. She barely came to our table, maybe once every 40 mins or so, she would only stay for seconds at a time. I was with a group of 10 people, there was no way we could all order what we wanted in a couple of seconds, but she would just walk away! Wouldn&#39;t even bother asking if anyone needed anything. She didn&#39;t get us water, or napkins, or ketchup for our fries. She had a nasty attitude the entire time, anyway we asked for the bill which she screwed up, took her 30 mins to get us the correct bill (with attitude) and then we waited, and waited, aaaaaaand waited. 45 mins later, she STILL hadn&#39;t picked up the bill. That was the last straw, I finally complained to the manager who was really nice and covered the whole thing for us. I appreciate him taking care of us like that but the service was so awful that I really don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever go back to this place.

Pro tip: Do not order too much food at the beginning of your visit because Pop&#39;s lays out a one pass buffet during halftime. The servers will not tell you about this because it is obviously to their gratuity disadvantage.  If you take advantage of the buffet, please be sure to tip your server accordingly because not only do they lose the opportunity for table turnover during the duration of a game but they lose out on potential tips earned from food that would normally be ordered.

The bar area provides many seating option that range from open hightop areas, table seating, bar seating, and a strange and awkward perimeter seating situated around the table area. I saw awkward because you&#39;ll be directly on top of the table inside the ring staring at their heads, food, and drinks in very close proximity.  All of the seats have at least decent views to the banks of flat screen monitors tuned to various sports channels just in case you don&#39;t care for football.

The thin crust pizza is standard thin crust style found in many bars so it&#39;s good but nothing to specifically make a trip to Pop&#39;s for. I suggest 2 toppings at the most as the pizza flavor becomes convoluted otherwise. 

The nachos were of the standard bar variety as well and featured nothing special and came out in the standard heaping typical mess. Satisfying but nothing unique.

We were going to order wings but after seeing someone else&#39;s order containing average sized wings but pricing, in some cases depending on quantity, at or over a dollar per wing. Whaaaaaat? No, thank you.

So why four stars? Only because it really is one of the greatest places to catch the Bears game in the area. Bucket deals for domestics are cheap as well so you won&#39;t have to worry about breaking the bank to come out and watch a game. Make sure you arrive early for decent seating so you won&#39;t get stuck with an awkward aerial view of the person inside of the awkward ring.",05/10/13,229,4,1,2,0,1.2066,2.082,1.318,14.600999999999999,No,2104

pops-pizza-and-sports-bar-roselle,Khaled D.,Hh4trFe0Z3htEH8XA0hcyA,2ZJhwkRIh4wR7A3TcgkeGA,"So I must start by saying I have very mixed feelings about this place.  I recently moved very close to Pop&#39;s and thought it was going to be a great bar to live near.  In a way I was right but mostly wrong.

The pro&#39;s....

Pop&#39;s does have great drink and food specials for each day of the week which is nice if you are looking to drink and eat for cheaper than most places.  They do have outside seating with TV&#39;s in the window if a game is on, which is always a plus.  


The con&#39;s....

For the most part the servers seem to be very nice but at times seem miserable.  I mean I understand it&#39;s work and no one wants to work but it gives off a bad vibe.  I was also somewhat under the impression that it would be more crowded on weekends.  For the weekends that I have gone it has been pretty slow.  I know it is called Pop&#39;s pizza but I am going to be honest when I say their pizza is pretty bland and nothing to brag about.

Within the last year the service has slipped.  There are still a handful of good servers, but more likely than not, you will get a server that has no clue what they are doing.  Take last Sunday for example: we sat down with 6 people for the Bears games.  A server came by about 10min after we sat down, we ordered a Bloody Mary from the Bloody Mary bar (which was not stocked), a couple of waters, and bucket of beer.  The Bloody Mary pint glass showed up with vodka and melted down ice because it had been sitting for pick up for so long, no waters, no beers.  After waiting and waiting and waiting, we decided to go to the bar to get our own drinks.  She came by 45 min later, didn&#39;t even realize she forgot the other things ordered.  This went on for the entire game.  We even had to bus our own tables.  When I looked for some &#39;in charge&#39;, they were MIA.

I&#39;ve opted to eat in both the bar and restaurant area. Either way, the food is the same. Some days are better than others, but either way it&#39;s average bar food. I&#39;ve tried a little bit of everything...pizza, appetizers, salads, sammies, pasta, and wraps. There&#39;s usually decent daily specials, that&#39;s a bonus. 

Service is always friendly and typically fairly fast. Prices are fair and portions are pretty large. 

As for the atmosphere, this is not a place I would come to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night. As is, the bar area usually brings in some of the local drunks, which I prefer to not be around. If that&#39;s what it&#39;s like during the week,  I&#39;d hate to see it during amateur hours...

The restaurant is where I prefer to eat if I&#39;m grabbing a quick bite with a friend. It&#39;s much more quiet and the service is better. I feel a little less dive-y in that section. Other than that, I stick to carryout. 

Pop&#39;s isn&#39;t bad if you&#39;re looking for a sandwich, some fried bar food or greasy pizza. You won&#39;t find me hanging in the bar, or slamming back beers on Fri//Sat night, but that&#39;s just my preference...",07/02/12,157,3,2,4,28,3.0663,1.8920000000000001,0.102,15.007,No,1370

They&#39;ve done some cosmetic surgery a few times over the years, but it still doesn&#39;t hide the overall nastiness of this place. It&#39;s in serious need of a real good top to bottom cleaning. 

The service is beyond horrible. If they get your order correct,(They&#39;ve gotten it wrong more than once) it  takes a long time to get it, and it&#39;s average at best.

The bar area/bar side of the establishment is pretty spacious - not just a large bar but many booths &amp; tables.  On 3 occassions (typically after work - say, 5pm), there was just one person serving the entire place.  

&#34;Running around like a chicken with her head cut off&#34;.. yep, that describes it perfectly.

The typical wait for a drink refill - even just some water - was probably 20 minutes - if you could flag her down.  And this is while sitting right at the bar.

The food is hit/miss.  Our wings were dry as a bone.  The &#34;fish fry&#34; was just a small plate of ok food.  The mini burgers are typically the safest bet &amp; the fries were good as well.  I had a chicken wrap that was pretty decent.

Basically, this used to be the only place to go close to home, but now that Bulldog has opened, we go there instead.

Order a burger and wings to be delivered...  when I finally got the food and open up my wings I found on the very first wing a HAIR! .. now that for one is just gross and should be a reason to get this place no stars! But it didn&#39;t stop, I decided to go back and give this place another shot and go see how the service was, when I got there I sat at the bar at lunch time. The service was awful!  Sat there waiting for a refill of water, but didn&#39;t get one... instead we heard the server swearing and complaining about how &#34; hard she works&#34;. After that I decided not to go back inside every again. My friend decided to order some food from there and pay with cash..  the delivery guy came and dropped off the food and after being given a $20.00 for a meal that was only $9.47 the delivery person started to walk away... my friend asks &#34; do you have change for this $20.00&#34; he reply &#34;No, all I carry is $20.00&#34;.

Here&#39;s the breakdown:
I came in with the restaurant having one person inside.  Kind of discouraging since this is supposedly a &#34;hot and new&#34; restaurant.  No worries, I&#39;m not here for popularity.  Upon looking at the menu, the entree which do not come with any sides is priced at $8.99.  So ultimately, you will get a leg and thigh or a palm sized beef (Steer crazy) for $9!  Not a good start.   Sides (rice, quinoa, or kale salad) is an additional $2+.  I ordered the steer crazy with kale, and lentil soup = $15.24.  TASTE: bleeehhhhh!  The soup was tasteless, the beef&#39;s sauce had an after taste of can followed with bland tasting meat, and the kale- well it tasted like Kale.  Definitely not worth the price.  As a matter of fact, not worth the visit.  
I can sympathize with the long wait for the food since they have to warm up the beef or whatever they have to do but again, just like the price, it was not worth the wait.

I love supporting small business but it must come with good value, service, and taste for me to ever return.  I&#39;m afraid this is my first and last visit.  Glad I tried something HOT &amp; NEW!",02/06/16,163,2,2,2,12,1.3453,2.227,2.2960000000000003,13.474999999999998,No,1304

For lunch, I was given the option to pick a protein and a side. They say the food is wild caught or grass fed... great for paleo diets. +1

Initially, it looks like they were going to do a daily menu but it looks like people complained so now they&#39;re trying to do a set menu and changing it up once in a while? Personally I&#39;d rather they have a set menu because I can at least tell what my options are before I go in (or at least announce on their FB what their current menu is). I think it would also help if they took a nice picture of the protein/sides and taped it up on the glass. When I got there, they had to open every single tray to show me my options. I can imagine that to be very drying to the food and time consuming if people were waiting. 

My protein (salmon) was dry but I think I was supposed to get a sauce on it. Even so, the meat was very dry so I don&#39;t think sauce would have helped much. The vegetables I got were delicious. 

The person working there was very friendly and explained everything to me well. +1

Instead of a soft flour tortilla, the &#34;wrap&#34; was a big, crunchy cabbage leaf - completely changing the texture profile of the dish.

Like so many other reviewers, I want to cheerlead to wish Omar and his team success. But I think there is somewhat of a lack of actual restauranting experience happening here. I have eaten at restaurants across all of North America and most of those have a tilt to vegetarian, so I have a pretty broad perspective when I say I support and welcome his concept...but it was not overly polished yet.

My suggestion? If fresh is your focus, then you should not have drying out foods visible along the counter. The practical answer is to simply not to have them so visible. We all know it takes a while to build a customer base and churn your offerings hourly.In the interim, please don&#39;t let me see what time can do to fresh ingredients... 

But that is a minor detail. The actual quality of the food is their focus. My curried lentils were a nice texture and a lighter flavor. Brown rice as a side was a nicely flavored supplement to it. My friend enjoyed her salad very much, adding avocado to enhance it. Gratefully, the food experience outweighed the uneven experience at the counter.

We still have high hopes for their content, their commitment to the quality of the ingredients and the impact on the larger food chain of his restaurant.

butcher-on-the-block-lake-in-the-hills,George H.,4rGP_TDwRw3i4oPJJHFfKQ,ZjkgqRVKLBMDvEARyOglDQ,"This was my first time getting meats from here - I usually go to a butcher elsewhere but I wanted to try to find somewhere closer to home.  I called in my order of a beef brisket and three slabs of St. Louis cut ribs on Monday of this past week for pickup on Friday morning.  (I was having a cookout on Saturday and needed time for my rubs to make everything &#39;happy&#39;.)  I asked if there was a particular time to get my order and I was told I could come anytime - I followed up saying I&#39;d be there around noon- they took my name and cell number to confirm the order.

Flash forward to Friday, I stopped nearby to do all the rest of my shopping for the party and drove over here to quickly pick up my order at 12:15.  I got in and the person behind the counter told me that my brisket was ready but that the delivery truck hadn&#39;t shown up with the ribs yet.  I responded, asking why they didn&#39;t call me - that I drove there all the way from Dundee.  He apologized, then told me he&#39;d check again to see if the truck had arrived.

This is where the visit went downhill...there is not separation from the meat counter all the way to the back of the shop, so I saw him look out the back door and then speak with someone else before going into the cooler, brought out a bag, took some ribs out of it and put them into a separate bag which he brought up to the counter, told me the truck just came in, quickly placed on the scale and almost immediately pulled off to wrap them in paper.  

When I saw them briefly on the scale, I thought the ribs looked small and asked to see them.  He pulled out a section of ribs that were cut in half across the slabs, leaving the rib length at about three inches.  I told him that wasn&#39;t acceptable - that I had ordered three full slabs of St. Louis cut ribs, and that those must have been someone else&#39;s order.  He said that they weren&#39;t, and pulled out another of the &#39;mini-slabs&#39; out of the  bag and tried to tell me that that&#39;s how they received them and showed me that &#34;put together&#34; the mini slabs equal a big slab.  

Again I told him that is not what I ordered and said if the truck did truly come just now, there should be more ribs on it seeing that it would be their delivery for the weekend.  He then told me that the ribs he had was all that they ordered for the weekend.

I told him that he could keep the ribs, they were not what I had ordered and I was unhappy with them.  I then asked to get a pork shoulder instead and have that along with my brisket.

Everything cooked up well at my cookout and was delicious, but the fact that the employee lied to me about the truck &#39;just arriving&#39; and instead pulling out (what I consider to be) a substandard product compared to what I ordered, and then proceeded to try to convince me that it was what I had ordered is what caused this two star rating.  

I don&#39;t care how good your product may or may not be, but DO NOT LIE to customers - especially when they can see your actions and know you are trying to cover your tracks.  I WILL NOT BE BACK.",25/08/13,301,2,1,0,-25,-0.4322,0.41800000000000004,0.632,17.95,No,3104

Liu&#39;s was AWESOME. Fresh, flavorful, and all around amazing. 

First, NO MSG ADDED!!! YAASSSS! All the ingredients are fresh. Did I say that enough?? The chicken, it isn&#39;t the gritty, gross dark parts. It&#39;s good, cooked crisp (or tender of not breaded). Meat is also tender and not chewy. 

Sauces are not overly garlicky or sickening sweet. There is also wide variety on the menu of dinners and specialties, vegetarian too. 

This place is great! If you are like me and are searching for your Chinese go to, you&#39;ve found it.

Eh. Was looking forward to trying Liu&#39;s  (not Chamber Red as indicated) based on ratings but ... eh. Food was decent...even pretty good but many things left to be desired.

Ambience: it&#39;s October but today was warm and humid and they did not have air on so muggy inside. No tablecloths as shown in photos so more stark in appearance. Weird mix of primarily country music playing. Plastic dishes and serveware took away from presentation for sure. Oh...and if you&#39;re planning on using the loo at Liu&#39;s bring your own paper towels because both bathrooms had none. 

Food: As I said...decent but portions small for the price. We like Yu&#39;s in Schaumburg and this place got higher ratings but I cannot figure out why, for the life of me.

I had the pork potstickers. Although they were fresh, I thought they were very bland. I&#39;ve definitely had a lot better.

I could eat a bucket of it. My husband and I have also split the Szechuan eggplant, which is great too. And the appetizers, including the soups, egg rolls, potstickers, and dumplings, are all amazing. No complaints whatsoever!

That said, they certainly need to work out some kinks with regard to service. Whenever we go, we wait a very long time for our food to come out. When we were last at the restaurant, we waited 40 minutes. During that time, we actually saw three couples walk out without ordering. Liu Brothers is short-staffed in both the kitchen, and on the floor.

When Liu Brothers popped up on my yelp search with almost perfect rating, I was very skeptical: the quite town of St. Charles is an unlikely place to harbor an authentic Chinese restaurant and &#34;Bistro&#34; doesn&#39;t necessarily convey authenticity either, but I wanted to give it a try. 

As we walked into the restaurant, my heart sank: the waiter is not Chinese, there are no Chinese patrons and there are only knives and forks on the table! Shoulda brought my own chopsticks...

I took a deep breath and scanned through the menu. The menu is not as lengthy as many Chinese restaurants, and there is no two-menu system (you know, one for Chinese expats, and one for locals). Most of the items listed are typical Americanized Chinese dishes but we quickly decided on two of the few atypical ones: Szechwan Eggplant and Liu Brothers&#39; Crispy Duck. 

It turned out the waiter is the owner of the place and he is knowledgeable about the food. He had me when he brought us two pairs of chopsticks, as well as authentic Chinese chili paste without us asking.  

10 minutes later, I was a total believer of the five star rating. The Szechwan Eggplant was the best I have had in a very long time: the eggplant is well-cooked and tender, which is hard to come by when it&#39;s cooked to order. The sauce was reminiscent of the classic Szechwan &#34;Yuxiang&#34; sauce, sweet, a bit tangy, slightly spicy all at once. The duck was not Cantonese or Peking style roast duck, but Szechwan style tea smoke duck. I think the name Crispy Duck is a bit of misnomer as the skin was not particularly crispy but who cares when the flavor and the tenderness of meat was awesome? Needless to say, we devoured the food.

Can I rave about the wonton soup for a second? It was EXACTLY what I wanted - and super fresh - and then I wanted more so I ordered some to go. 

Everything on this menu is made fresh to order. Every single thing. I thought that might take awhile (and I&#39;m wary of things taking awhile after six weeks on Miami Time) but it really didn&#39;t... so it was fresh AND fast. Sold. 

The crab rangoon was light and crisp, and a new favorite of the 6YO, who pretty much wanted to eat until she burst. 

For entrees, we ordered honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, and combination chow mein. And all were obviously fresh - and delicious.

There was a new person who seated us, but that&#39;s no big deal. Walking to our table we saw into the kitchen and saw it was different people too. Uh oh.

So we order and the food comes...not quite the same. Especially the fried rice, which we sent back. I loved their fried rice previously! They didn&#39;t use a lot of soy sauce and it was lighter and tastier. This one had a lot of soy sauce and also had a curry taste to it. So they went from having the best fried rice I&#39;d had to the worst. Very unfortunate.

The most frustrating thing though was the fact that they have kept the name and the menu...so you walk in thinking that you&#39;re going to have the solid meal that you&#39;re accustomed to having at Liu Brothers, when in fact it is not Liu Brothers, but a cheap imitation. I actually felt duped. Funny, somehow they feel ok about charging what Liu Bros charged for a meal that was far inferior to the original. Which actually makes me angry.

I had the garlic scallops and holy cow, they were amazing. The garlic sauce is incredible and the scallops were cooked perfectly. 

Our only complaint was with the crab Rangoon. My husband and I are crab Rangoon junkies and we were disappointed because there was hardly any crab in each one. I noticed it when I first took a bite and from then on, my husband and I were pretty much having a search party to find crab lol.

But not any more.  What was once the freshest and best prepared food has become run of the mill.  We knew immediately when we got our meals that something had happened.  The quality of the ingredients and the preparation was not the same.

When paying the bill we asked if there had been a change of ownership.  There has been.  New  owners.  And it shows in a decline to the average from the exceptional.

If you are a regular, you are in for a disappointment.   If you are here based on recommendations, you are about to wonder what the fuss was about.

Sad",10/01/16,61,2,1,1,5,0.7977999999999997,0.9830000000000001,1.292,10.725,No,682
chamber-red-asian-bistro-st-charles,Chris W.,Sy3ArBQ5fKcC-tu7cDHvjQ,0sd8oSH4el8P-g7xoFk8VA,"Time for an update since there&#39;s been a change of ownership.

Just before year end, the brothers, Kevin and David, and their partner, Kevin, sold the business. The brothers stayed on until mid- to late-January to teach the recipes to the new owners/cooks. 

We have gone in and carried out a couple of times since the new ownership took over, most recently last week. I ordered dishes I was more than familiar with to gauge the kitchen&#39;s performance. 

The crab rangoons were good. They were cooked differently and had the look of something that had been fried in a tempura batter. The result was a delightfully crispy and flaky, but light, shell which I thoroughly enjoyed. The filling had a dominant flavor of something akin to green onion. Could have been an under-mixed batch of filling. The rangoons never had a strong crab flavor to begin with so that wasn&#39;t missing, but I&#39;d have liked a bit more balanced flavor. The accompanying sweet sauce is the same- a little thicker perhaps- which is fine, but still fresh and bright. So the jury is out on these depending on the filling.

The chicken fried rice was definitely a disappointment. The chicken was not browned and the rice was very pale. Overall the dish was just very bland and had a greasy quality. Definitely a step down here.

Lastly we had the honey walnut shrimp, which I must say was better than ever. The shrimp were just perfectly cooked- and that wasn&#39;t always the case when David and Kevin were in the kitchen- they had a tendency to overcook the shrimp by a minute or two and the shrimp got a little rubbery. These were perfect. Again, the sauce was perhaps a little thicker, but that was just fine by me as it coated the shrimp and walnuts perfectly. Speaking of the walnuts, they had a much better candied crunch than I remember, so perhaps the new cooks are paying more attention to the walnuts too. The dish was the best example of this Liu Bros classic that I have ever had. An improvement here.

So the new ownership is batting .500 for us right now...I&#39;m a long-time regular customer and I will not be too quick to dismiss the new iteration of this restaurant. Based on what I have seen thus far I am willing to give them some time to refine their approach.",10/02/16,232,3,1,5,-2,6.8977,4.319,0.371,21.309999999999995,No,2261

Relocated to the Fox Valley 2 years ago, and I&#39;d been searching for a real good Chinese restaurant in the area, but had yet to locate one, when some friends at the local dog park recommended this place.
Quality is definitely the main priority. Since July, I&#39;ve been there at least a half dozen times for dinner and twice for lunch. The Szechwan and Mushu are superb. I haven&#39;t had comparable, in years. The soups and noodle dishes, made with homemade chicken broth are some of the best I&#39;ve had. Lunch portions are of decent size. I haven&#39;t been disappointed with any entree.
The only issue I have is with the size of the appetizers. They&#39;re very good, but smaller than some I&#39;m accustomed to. Used to have Sunday brunches of Chinese appetizer plates and soup. Unfortunately, I cant do that here! They don&#39;t even offer an appetizer plate.

The food is phenomenal and above and beyond any other Chinese restaurant in the area. It is BYOB, which I wasn&#39;t aware of, but luckily we went with good friends who knew and came prepared! We ordered several items and tried a bit of everything. We had the crispy chicken wings, which are out of this world, the pot stickers which were also very good and the spring rolls which are above average. For entrees we ordered the Orange Chicken which is amazing. Just order it, trust me. My husband had ordered the Mongolian Beef as it is one of his favorite Chinese meals, and it was very good, but he specifically asked the waiter for the chef to make it hot, and oh boy did they. So if you like hot ask them, just be prepared to sweat! One of us also ordered a special that was on the menu that was a chicken chow mein that was delicious. The food is really great.

The only problem with Liu Brothers is the service as others have said. I&#39;ll be honest, our friends had been there before and warned us about the service and that you will wait and wait, that the waiter is a young kid who spends a lot of time on his phone and ignoring customers so we kind of knew what we were getting into. But we were assured the food was worth it. And really, it is. If you aren&#39;t in a hurry and can just relax, pour your own wine and deal with wet glasses (yeah, they brought us soaking wet glasses straight from the dishwasher) and wait for food, it&#39;s tolerable. And to be honest, after some wine it began to become hilarious to see what would happen next.  And really, the night we were there we had the owner as a waiter and so it wasn&#39;t too bad.

The food took too long to leave the kitchen and even thought the restaurant was only half full, the kitchen and waiter were obviously overwhelmed by the amount of diners. 

Last time we went it was for lunch, and my husband and I ordered two appetizers and soup. Our appetizers came out, but we sat for a long time waiting for soup. It was lunch and we had to go back to work, so after an hour went by we asked about our soup and explained that we had to leave soon. The waiter, instead of checking with the kitchen, said he didn&#39;t know what the hold up was, and if we couldn&#39;t wait we should &#34;just leave!&#34;

We waited for 20 minutes to be seated - while there were over 10 open tables and booths. We thought it could be because of their kitchen size, or to keep labor costs down. Either way, not a great start.

I had the orange juice, and a chicken salad meal, which was great. My brother had a panini, which he enjoyed. my father had the pancakes and eggs, which he said were very good.

Great portion size for their price, it was around $10 a person for drinks and food.

Service was quality - our server was prompt, fun, and very knowledgable of the menu. 

Definitely would&#39;ve been five stars, had we not waited for eternity to be seated.",19/03/16,80,4,2,3,28,2.656,1.4569999999999999,0.452,8.091,No,680

I order the special two eggs, tow pancakes, and two bacons.  I was so delighted to have had my order how I like it.  I read of two eggs there were four.  I don&#39;t like bacon so I had a substitute.  I ordered sausage instead I received tow if those but they were a pretty size and  very delicious.  It came with fresh squeezed orange juice and fruit in the side.  The pancakes were made to perfection.  I was so happy I did not go to McDonald&#39;s by myself. 

My husband ordered stake and eggs.  His order had 3 big platters one with his huge stake and fresh not frozen broccoli.  One order of pancakes.  On the third plate he had four eggs, hash browns and fresh fruit.  Wow this was amazing.  I had only had this kinks of breakfast in Canada back in the day.  They give you so much food and is fresh not burned..

No wonder my husband was upset when we took him for potato pancakes at this other restaurant there the food was horrible he got sick and I just could NOT eat those sweet potato pancakes.

I recommend this restaurant in a second.  I did not know I had such a great restaurant walking distance.  Yum.  The restaurant is clean and big.  It is also cozy.

egg-yolk-cafe-west-chicago,Sarah S.,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,7asFoESmdiaNw7z8QrfG_Q,"Last weekend I had brunch with a friend of mine at the Egg Yolk Cafe. We were going to Kline Creek Farm and faced with limited options, both agreeing reviews, pictures and the menu at Egg Yolk looked good. 

When we got to Egg Yolk on a Sunday morning, we were told it would be a 15-30 minute wait which seemed reasonable. When we were called to be seated, they actually had called us before another table and the other lady made a seen about us being seated first. We just stood confused as we honestly had no idea who was there first or what was going on...but it put us in an uncomfortable situation and I think their hosting needs to keep better tabs on things. Now when we were sat, we waited. A lot. Like 15 minutes before we were even greeted. And then she had to get us menus. After she dropped those off, it was another 15 minutes before she came back to us. It was a bit frustrating waiting 30 minutes just to place our orders. 

We finally got to order and the food was eventually brought out to us - again this took quite awhile. And she set it down and walked away before we had a chance to remind her we had no silverware. So we sat for another 5 minutes with our food in front of us but no way to eat. When she came back around, she was of course apologetic that she didn&#39;t realize we had silverware. She snagged it off another table and all was well in the world. I understand it was busy and it&#39;s a diner but there were some serious service flaws.

For brunch I had a delicious ham &amp; cheese omelette. The cheese oozed out of it when I cut into the perfectly cooked egg. Everything tasted very fresh to me, perfectly sized pieces of ham, very enjoyable. The hashbrowns that came with it were different than any I&#39;ve previously had. The shreds of potato were more thick but still soft &amp; crispy in all the right spots. 

Overall, our meals were good, service wasn&#39;t but it could have just been an off day. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to go back but would prefer trying somewhere else before returning.",01/11/13,212,3,1,4,7,3.0365999999999995,2.551,0.9,20.549000000000003,No,2035

What should have been maybe 40 minutes top for a meal turned into an hour and a half just because the waitress couldn&#39;t get our food to us in a timely fashion and made us wait 30 minutes to get our check.

The food? Meh, pretty good. It wasn&#39;t anything to brag about. Basically all the same options that any other breakfast place has. I did have breakfast though. Their lunch menu looked decent too. Maybe their lunch is better?

My three boys are pretty simple - pancakes - but my wife and I enjoy a good range of choices. We were not disappointed at all. I love corned beef and hash with eggs and Egg Yolk had an awesome corned beef hash skillet. Sooo freakin good and a great size portion of the skillet alone let alone the huge pancake that came with it. Didn&#39;t come close to finishing even though I wanted to. Whole family enjoyed the experience. The decor of the place was very nice but prices were so reasonable. I wish I would have eaten here all three mornings I was in town!

Also, they were open on both Thanksgiving and Christmas which worked out nicely for us as we&#39;re too pathetic to make ourselves breakfast.  

The food is always really good.  Greg almost always gets the corned beef hash and eggs, Sue has the pancakes that come with it, and I get confused because the menu is too big.  They have a hawaiin omellete (I believe they call it the Hawaii Five-O, which is silly, so I&#39;m refusing to call it that), that is really good.  It&#39;s canadian bacon, pineapple, and cheese.  I&#39;ve also had the biscuits and gravy, they were really good.  They have tuna salad stuffed pineapple and I appreciate the attempt at stuffing something but let&#39;s be serious, just put the tuna salad on a plate with chunks of pineapple.  I won&#39;t mind if it&#39;s not in an uncut half of a pineapple that I now have to awkwardly cut up with a butter knife.

It wasn&#39;t too busy but the placement of our table was kind of awkward.  One side was flush against another table, and the other side was into a walking area.  Fortunately nothing happened, but it was kinda awkward.
The food was pretty good.  I got some crepes and they were good.  Coffee refills were quick.  The orange juice tasted fresh squeezed, and was tasty.
The only thing I dislike about these places is the price of their a la carte eggs.  I mean 5.49 for 2 eggs.. C&#39;mon man.
But that is typical of most breakfast joints.

The food in general wasn&#39;t too salty and came out pretty hot.  There are quite a few options which is always nice.  The eggs benedict were good and their hash browns also had a nice brownness to them.

They have an excellent new menu. The food quality seems improved too. The prices are reasonable and affordable. They now have freshly squeezed orange juice and the serving size is generous. Their strawberry crepes are AMAZING and come with a bowl of fresh whipped cream- you get three big crepes- wow. I had a breakfast combo with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and french toast and ate every bite.  

The service is very good too, with some familiar faces from the Sandpiper. I appreciated that our server checked on us a lot but just walked by intentionally, without interrupting our conversation- it was a perfect balance and we always had just what we needed. I also liked that they leave a carafe of water with lemon on your table so you can refill your own water as needed instead of it happening throughout the meal and you feeling like you have to stop your conversation each time.

When driving on a Sunday morning to visit a different breakfast place, I missed a turn and the yolk was one me as I wound up stopping here instead. Having spotted it from the nearby intersection I decided I was hungry enough to just give it a try, and boy was I in for a treat.

Egg Yolk Cafe is a very typical breakfast/diner restaurant. The decor inside is pleasant, the place itself is very clean. There&#39;s high ceilings and even a skylight. The inside is surprisingly spacious and well decorated for a family diner. After being seated I looked over the menu and quickly identified a Mexican skillet as the menu item of my desires. Shortly thereafter a waiter came to the table, took my drink and food order, and within about 10 minutes my food had arrived at my table. 

While the place is clean, spacious and aesthetically pleasing, it would all be in vein it if the food weren&#39;t up to snuff. The Mexican skillet I ordered came with lots of cheese, eggs and clearly lots of spicy chorizo sausage ground up on it. There were a few jalapeno peppers in the skillet as well to give it that extra bit of spice. I was also given two bottles of different hot sauces.  The dish was garnished with a strawberry in the corner to give it an extra appetizing look. The first thing that&#39;s notable about this particular skillet is that the potatoes covering the bottom of the skillet were very well seasoned and well cooked and were quite flavorful. Often times when ordering skillets I find places serving bland, flavorless, unseasoned potatoes as filler. The potatoes here had some hot and some caramelized onion mixed in. This along with other seasoning added some extra flavor and were easily the best hash potatoes I&#39;ve found at the bottom of a skillet. I seriously wish other diners would try these skillet potatoes out and take notes on how it was done. The eggs were made well, and there was a generous amount of cheese and meat on the skillet. It was spicy, but not too spicy, and the extra hot sauce bottles allowed me to add a little extra kick if I wanted it.

I also opted for pancakes instead of toast. These were fairly average pancakes with nice thick syrup that had a good amount of flavor. While there wasn&#39;t anything particularly unique about these flapjacks, but they were a nice compliment to the skillet.

Overall I was extremely pleased with everything about my experience at Egg Yolk Cafe. This is an egg-cellent place to grab breakfast and I will definitely be coming back in the future, just writing this review makes me hungry for their food. I HIGHLY recommend the Mexican skillet here, and I&#39;m going to give this place a well deserved and somewhat difficult to obtain from my grading standards five star review.",08/04/13,303,5,3,5,64,7.712500000000001,3.1940000000000004,0.301,23.503999999999994,No,2842

egg-yolk-cafe-west-chicago,Christa F.,VVyIz8Z73MU9RbZA_JoyRA,_y4-Nl25ZEE6RadSH6IURQ,"When we arrived at the new Egg Yolk Cafe (formerly The Sandpiper) they were mildly busy for a Sunday morning, but there were still over a dozen tables open.  We were immediately run down by 4 bus boys that seemed to be in a rush.  Not one of them excused themselves or apologized for their rudeness.  After about 5 minutes an &#34;owner&#34; looking man asked that we wait a moment, so we did still wanting to check out the newly renovated space.  A family of 6 came in 5 minutes later and told the owner that they were just going to sit over &#34;there&#34; and took their seats.  I gave the owner a sour look as we had already been waiting and there were only 2 of us.  He grabbed a couple of menus and sat us at the nearest table.

The waitress had informed me that the Corned Beef Hash was &#34;homemade&#34; when I asked, so I was pretty excited to order that with a couple of scrambled eggs, hash browns, and pancakes.  My boyfriend ordered the Potato Pancakes along with some bacon and scrambled eggs as well.  I also asked that they bring out a new pitcher of water as the ones they leave at the table have lemon in them and I cannot have lemon at all.  The guy acknowledged that he understood, yet all he did was dump out the water in the pitcher and refill it.  My boyfriend did a quick taste test of it and confirmed that I couldn&#39;t drink it.  I nicely asked the waitress for just a straight up class of plain water.  She was nice enough to oblige.  

When we received our food I was dismayed to find out that the Corned Beef Hash was not &#34;homemade&#34; as I was told previously, but just the canned stuff browned up a little.  Complete disappointment.  My boyfriend&#39;s Potato Pancakes were a little floury and contained corn as well as carrots.  They were quite bland and could use some seasoning since all I really tasted were the corn and four.  Overall everything was pretty greasy and nothing really had any seasoning!  I was pretty disappointed as I&#39;ve wanted to try this place out ever since it changed over!

egg-yolk-cafe-west-chicago,George R.,nGdejkTKHuQryIOIFek02g,SezwB4alpvOtr-85TSDnBQ,"Formerly the Sandpiper Restaurant, the Egg Yolk Cafe is under new ownership and management.

I dined here for lunch during their early transition period. The menu is a standard breakfast &amp; lunch only menu focusing primarily on breakfast entrees...  pancakes, crepes, waffles, omelettes, other egg dishes. Their lunch items include soups &amp; salads, paninis &amp; wraps, various sandwiches and burgers.

Although I stopped in during lunchtime, I chose to try a bacon and avocado omelette with hash browns and wheat toast. The omelette was nicely shaped and folded, covering almost half of the plate. It was slightly overcooked for an omelette, but I was okay with that since I don&#39;t like runny eggs. Hash browns covered the other half of the plate. The bacon was fine, but the avocado was not very appealing. 

At first I thought they made a mistake and added mushrooms to my omelette. I don&#39;t like mushrooms, so I began picking them out of the eggs. But upon further inspection, I realized the brown pieces were indeed avocado pieces. Now, I&#39;m no chef and I don&#39;t know if the cooking process affected the color of the avocados, but I know I&#39;ve had green avocados in an omelette at other restaurants... which causes me to think that these ones were old and brown when they were were added to this omelette.

Anyway, the service was good and friendly (their saving grace). And I am pleased to see that this restaurant space did not ultimately shut down, but rather is being redefined. So for now, I am stretching to give it a 3-star rating, and I&#39;m hoping the kinks in their food prep or freshness will be worked out soon.

I work in West Chicago, and I will be back once they are in full swing to reevaluate their quality, for better or worse. So, give them some time to make their transition. But for now, don&#39;t order an omelette with avocados.

It was my second time trying to eat here, and the first time I actually did it. Last time, I saw a line of high school kids hanging out in front and decided to take a pass, since it was cold out and I didn&#39;t feel like waiting. This time, the high school kids were all leaving when I got there. This slowed things down a bit, but I did get to wait inside, so no big deal. My advice to you is to keep an eye out between 11:00 and 11:45 during the week when school is in session if you need to get in and out of here quickly.

I ordered the crepes with strawberries, bananas, and walnuts. I was immediately impressed with the quality of the fruit. Sometimes, a menu will read &#34;fresh strawberries,&#34; but they really mean &#34;fresh from the can.&#34; Other times, the berries are fresh but come doused in syrup, like the canned ones. Here, there were just sliced berries on top of my crepes, which were cool and naturally sweet. The bananas were not brown or mushy. The walnuts were added with a good nut to fruit ratio in mind. These would have been the best crepes I&#39;ve had in a long time, except the actual crepes were slightly undercooked and mushy. Still, they were not undercooked to an unsafe or disgusting level, and the large portions meant I could set aside the few mushy pieces and still fill up on the rest.

I also liked that they give you a full carafe of water here. The service isn&#39;t bad, but it isn&#39;t fast enough to fill up the glass of a pregnant woman who goes through water like Shamu at Sea World. My glass was never empty, but I didn&#39;t have to flag somebody down for more water every five minutes, either. Very nice!

I might bump them up to a fourth star on a later visit if I don&#39;t have to stand around waiting for the football team to clear out because there is slightly more staff to accommodate the lunch rush.",18/01/12,213,3,2,5,36,4.5091,3.1730000000000005,0.39299999999999996,16.434,No,1903

At first I was hesitant, especially after reading a negative review.  I&#39;m so glad I decided to try for myself.  I&#39;ve been meaning to write this for some time now, wanting to encourage people to give it a try.

First the new ownership and service team is impeccable, very friendly and welcoming and always great attentive service.  They remodeled the place and it looks much better and is very clean and welcoming.  I have been seated in booths in the main dining area as well as at the smaller tables in the bar.

The bread is phenomenal, I&#39;d have to say it&#39;s my new favorite Greek bread.  Anyone who knows me knows that I judge a place by their bread, and in this regard Kouzina nails it.  It&#39;s freshly baked and has the crisp crust I look for, and the olive oil they offer has great flavor.  They will bring butter if you request it.  I could make a meal out of this alone. Well, this and one more thing...

The saganaki.  The show stealer is the saganaki!!  Insanely good!  Best I&#39;ve ever had, better than Parthenon and Greek Islands.  It&#39;s a higher quality cheese and the portion is the perfect size for individual orders.  Call me hungry but this is saganaki that I refuse to share.  Order it, you&#39;ll be glad you did.  And during the week it&#39;s half price if you eat it in the bar during a specified time period.  It&#39;s so creamy and doesn&#39;t turn to rubber like other cheeses I&#39;ve had.  The taste is fantastic- makes me salivate thinking about it.  Ugh, so good.

Everything I&#39;ve had here is top notch- my usual order is chicken kabob with Greek rice and a side Greek salad.  The chicken is so tender and cooked to perfection, and the grilled flavor is sublime.  The Greek rice is so good, great flavor with the sauce on top.  Goes well with the kabobs.  Their salads are enormous, cold, fresh and crisp, and their feta cheese is delicious.  A meal in itself.

I&#39;ve dined with others who have enjoyed the gyros platter, the salmon, and the Greek potatoes.  What a relief to have such high quality Greek food without having to drive to the city.

kouzina-schaumburg-2,Gerry A.,OHH18hww_n6etjhWmHrd7A,DvE6y4BsZec36EiK7n6Yxg,"Lunch review. 
One good constant from the last owner is Zach, a server we really like. Wish I could say the same for the Moussaka and the menu in general under the new ownership.

Lunch prices seem high, and in comparison to dinner, dinner prices seem a little low for Schaumburg but I think they will be pumping drinks, more on that later.
Moussaka is $15 for lunch and $17 for dinner?
Big problem right away is that I don&#39;t like bechamel instead of the usual layer of mashed potatoes in my moussaka. The other problem is it wasn&#39;t half as good as the moussaka the previous restaurant was finally knocking out the last few years. Didn&#39;t like the clunky steak fries at all.
No octopus main course on the lunch or dinner menu? What kind of Greek Menu is that?
There is a small octopus appetizer. I like my own lamb, chicken and meat dishes better than most restaurants, so my test for a Greek restaurant is the moussaka and octopus, my octopus has really improved though.

I drank mass quantities of strong iced tea but saw a flyer on the way out with $5 cocktail specials on 4 nights. I can only imagine what a $5 martini tastes like in Schaumburg and am going to keep it that way.
Service was intelligent and attentive, we like Zach. Interior is tastefully toned down from the last owner, and so was THANKfully the droning Fox Noise in the bar.
If you are heading West, exit onto Plum Grove Road and then turn West on Golf when you leave.

Ok, I was disappointed and am not going back until the menu, and/or cook changes.

Me and my boyfriend decided to try a different, new place. We sat down, I ordered a glass of iced tea, while my boyfriend went to the bathroom. We waited 20 minutes for the waiter to bring me my iced tea, and come and take our food order. He NEVER came back. Yes! I never got my tea and we decided to leave because we were both hungry and if it takes more than 20 minutes to bring me my drink, food was probably going to take 2 hours. Omg I have never been so disappointed at ANY restaurant. Even McDonald&#39;s. We are not complainers usually and we have never left a restaurant before. The tables next to us were also looking around and didn&#39;t look happy because none of them had their food and they were there before we came. It was just a chaos. I have never expected such disappointment even from the most average food place. The owner really needs to hire a lot more waiters or something else must be done, but this place&#39;s service is a joke compared to all schaumburg restaurants.

The meal started off well the waiting staff was attentive and bread was brought to the table. My wife and I each ordered pita gyro sandwiches. The food was brought to our table nice and hot and it was all very tasty. That said I have a couple caveats. It was obvious that the Gyro meat served was not made in house. Also, the french fries were undercooked, they were still edible but they were definitely a little floppy. Finally, the restroom wasn&#39;t quite up to standards that I expect which are quite high. It&#39;s not that the bathroom was dirty or anything it just wasn&#39;t well-maintained and could have been cleaned a little bit better with a little bit more attention to detail.

Monday and not very busy.  Our server was very attentive and had suggestions at every course.
A warm loaf of bread was put on the table immediately with seasoned oil and a few kalamata olives (a nice touch).
Appetizer:  Saganaki and it was delicious.  Not too thick, perfectly melted.
My husband had a cup of the egg lemon soup and was licking the bowl.
I had a small greek salad filled with onion, tomato, cucumber, kalamata, lettuce and a nice chunk of feta on top with the perfect amount of a greek vinaigrette.
Entrees: 
Beef Kabob with roasted potatoes.  Ordered Medium and it came out prefectly pink.  Not dry at all.
Chicken, spinach artichoke with lemon sauce. rice pilaf (i finished every last grain)

I ordered 2 things: melitzanosalata(eggplants dip) and pastitchio(Greek lasagna). I&#39;ve had both these at many restaurants in Greektown,Chicago and love them but at Kouzina they just weren&#39;t authentic. The taste of the melitzanosalata was weird as if it had a lot of mayo in it or something. Also, it was bright pink??? Never had it pink. The pastitchio tasted like chef boyarde spagettios. I&#39;m not joking the only thing about this place was the service and they all spoke geek and we&#39;re professional.

1st- I was hungry and looking for lunch. After pondering the menu, went with the large Italian sub and medium potato salad. The Italian sub was simply prepared, meat, veggies, and a tasty Italian dressing on a sesame seed Italian bread. All combined to a tasty sandwich, with the meat standing out in the end. I haven&#39;t had much luck with potato salad, this one was decent - all potatoes were cooked through, which usually is not the case at other places. Dressing on that was alright.

What I was really surprised was with my second order. Did not want to bother cooking dinner, and saw a side case of already prepared Italian dishes. I got the braciole and got a veggie rotolo. These came in microwaveable dishes. After reheating, we were pleasantly surprised that might. The marinara sauce was nice. The braciole was tender and did not require a knife to cut through the tasty layers.

Now, I&#39;m generally not much of a sub fan. I might even hate them. Something about them reminds me of grade school lunches where the cheese would sit on your sammie unrefrigerated for hours to the point where it goes a big rubbery one and gets all melty and disintegrated. Yucko the Clown. 

Mario&#39;s veggie sub has become my new Tuesday (or any time I&#39;m in the area) tradition. Get the 10 incher (trust me- if you go with the 6 your life will only be full of regrett), no mayo, and ask for the spicy cheese- that ish is seriously spicy and oh-so  GD delish. 

On occasion I&#39;ll veer from exclusively getting one 10 inch sub and opt for a little variety... like maybe I&#39;ll get two 10 inch subs, OR a 10 inch sub and ravioli, or a 10 inch veggie sub and the delish veggie rotolo... and I mustn&#39;t forget a kolacki cookie and gelato. Everything is phenomenal. Truly. And there&#39;s TONS of veggie options. 

On some days the super nice little woman behind the counter asks how many sets of silverware I need  for all the food I&#39;ve ordered... as if I&#39;m order for multiple people. Just one, I say. In fact, I probably don&#39;t even need the one bc everything is so good I just dig right in with my digits. Plasticware can&#39;t hold this Bia back, yo.

The environment inside is kinda sterile but it&#39;s a deli- whadya expect? And I&#39;ll admit that sometimes the worker bees can be kinda cold but I don&#39;t care- that veggie sub still manages to warm the cockles of my heart and I&#39;m giving them 5 stars for it.

And, I was hungry following a traffic-ridden drive from the city. It appeared that the fates had written me a prescription for an unshakable case of the hangriness.

Ooooh, lookie - there&#39;s a sandwich shop next door!

Crisis averted. I was surprised to find a warm, cozy shop with a family feel once I walked through the doors. Turns out they&#39;ve been around for years, and you can satiate your craving for all things Italian between their impressive offering of just about any pasta dish your carb-lovin&#39; heart desires and their standout sandwiches. I went with the deceptively simple yet all-out awesome roasted red pepper and fresh mozzarella sandwich. If you&#39;re into salads and soup they make them too. But you must save room for the cannoli - it&#39;s not a recommendation, that&#39;s a rule.

marios-addison,Don Z.,1dFC0YhcvFu1ibPVYTkEfA,IZHC35qLP2vfAn3AAHW6dA,"As a regular customer of Bigby&#39;s Pour House which shares the same building, I have been to Mario&#39;s many times.  I like Mario&#39;s, but I don&#39;t love it... well at least not everything.

What I do love is that it is not Sub-Johns-nos.  I like real old fashioned sub sandwiches.  I also like that they have a variety of other dishes such as lasagna, chicken Vesuvio, meatloaf, eggplant parmesan, etc.
The food is all &#34;homemade&#34; tasting which puts it above all those chains.

Walking into Mario&#39;s from either the outside entrance, or the hallway shared with Bigby&#39;s you find yourself in a small, somewhat sterile environment with food cases on one side and plenty of tables and chairs on the other.  Everything is clean and well kept which is great for a restaurant.  It definitely has that deli feel to it that doesn&#39;t really encourage you to hang out.  I usually take my food over to Bigby&#39;s to enjoy it with a beer.

The counter is usually manned by Mario himself or his wife.  They efficiently understand what I am ordering and get the ball rolling.  The one area that I think leaves room for improvement is personality.  Perhaps they have been doing this for so long that it doesn&#39;t seem important anymore, but personality goes a long way.  All the times I have been in Mario&#39;s I have never felt that they appreciated my business.  I don&#39;t even care if they remember me personally, but just give some indication that you are happy to see me choose your restaurant.

Once you order, you get to hang out while they make the sandwich fresh (or heat up your entree which was precooked, but kept cold in the display case).  Speaking of the hot entrees, they are served in styrofoam bowls/plates and there is only plastic utensils.  I know that this is the way things are done these days, but that doesn&#39;t mean I have to like it.  I often avoid those items  if I think about it too much before ordering.  I also find the sauce to be good, but a little on the salty side.

Sometimes if the Bigby&#39;s/Mario&#39;s schedules overlap, I will get some dessert to go with my beer drinking.  (I&#39;m weird that way.)  Mario&#39;s has a nice selection of homemade desserts like cannoli, Napolean, tiramisu, cookies, brownies, and other things that I cannot remember.  Anything that has cream in it and benefits from being chilled is delicious.  Unfortunately, they keep the cookies and brownies in the same case and I didn&#39;t like that they were served cold.  They also have gelato (hidden off to the side by the napkins and utensils).  I have only had the hazelnut and vanilla.  The hazelnut gelato was very good.  The vanilla must not be as popular because it was a little freezer burned.

So overall I like Mario&#39;s.  I don&#39;t know if I would go out of my way to eat here if it wasn&#39;t next to Bigby&#39;s, but it is definitely a nice break from the limited Bigby&#39;s menu.  Unfortunately Mario&#39;s is usually a couple hours away from closing when Bigby&#39;s is opening up, so the window of opportunity is small.
Keep the fresh subs coming and I will be back... and looking for a little smile.",09/06/13,322,3,3,5,73,7.705,5.208999999999999,1.7550000000000001,27.037,No,3155
marios-addison,Aimee M.,RO3vznPVVw5NWcgfP3k17A,yvjNbQnRMkzDpi9KFycVgg,"Mario&#39;s is a perfect place to pick up lunch or dinner--especially when you&#39;re on the run and/or don&#39;t feel like cooking at home.  There&#39;s not much character to the place-it&#39;s a bit like a cafeteria, but the food is the real reason to visit.  I&#39;ve picked up dinner here several times and taken subs with me to picnics and even to tailgate at the Bears games. Always a hit. 

Sub sandwiches, paninis, pasta, salads, soups--there&#39;s lots to choose from.  My favorite is the Italian sub--stuffed with meats, topped with lettuce and tomato and their Italian dressing, all on a nice hearty italian bread.  Delish. I&#39;ve had other sammies here and have never been disappointed.  The Ravioli is also a solid choice.  

Service is always friendly and prices are very reasonable.  There&#39;s a sweet station with gelato and pre-packaged Italian Ice.  And don&#39;t leave without checking out the pastry case--delectable delights!",17/08/11,106,4,2,4,19,3.2814,1.8269999999999997,0.082,10.091000000000001,No,950

Yes, the meat was literally popping out of the sides of my Italian sandwich.  I was in sub heaven.  The sumptuous meat and cheese was complimented by a few pieces of lettuce and tomatoes and topped with Mario&#39;s Italian dressing on a very fresh sesame roll.  The only thing missing was a few thin slices of onion.  My wife ordered the veggie and a small cup of fruit salad and was quite happy.  Yes, vegetarians, between the veggie sandwich, eggplant paninni, and pasta dishes you have many options. 

The only thing that I won&#39;t do next time is order the 10&#34; sub.  I guess I&#39;m just not man enough!  This was the first time in a long while that I haven&#39;t been able to finish a sub.

Next stop at Marios will require ordering one of their beautiful looking pasta dishes.

The owners are quite nice and were a great help on my last group order.  I ordered 4 different subs and they advised me what subs are the most popular and what is usually on them.  I got a hot corned beef and stayed away from the vegetables while the turkey got a touch of mayo along with swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  The Italian has hot capacolla, genoa salami, mortadella, provolone, along with some veggies.  They use fresh Turano bread so it&#39;s got a nice &#34;chew&#34; along with some sesame seeds.  The bread has to be thick because they&#39;re so well filled.

They have a daily hot pasta menu item and for $7 or $8, it&#39;s definitely filling.  There are plenty of semi prepared items in their display case which can be heated up and added with sauce or perfect for a take home dinner to add to your own salad or sides.  The seating area is simple and clean.  There&#39;s parking in the back and it&#39;s not that difficult to get out onto Lake Street.

My Italian sub had plenty of meat, tasty cheese and just enough dressing; the bread was chewy and perfect. My husband&#39;s panini looked delicious, but I wouldn&#39;t know since he scarfed it down so fast! I do wonder if I could get some giardiniera next time, that would be the perfect final touch to my sub...

The space itself is clean (although a few tables could&#39;ve used a wipe off) with maybe a dozen tables. There were cool pictures of various forms of pasta all over the wall, and some maps of Italy and its regions.

The menu is on large signs on the walls with virtually every type of Mexican food offered. The widescreen TV is tuned to ESPN Deportes so if you speak Spanish and like soccer you are all set. The tables are Formica with wood trim and the chairs are typical vinyl style. Counters and stool seating are on either side of the restaurant. You order and pay at the counter and if you&#39;re having horchata there is a self serve dispenser out in the dining area marked no refills please. The food is very typical of many of the fast food, order at the counter Mexican restaurants in the area. You can&#39;t go wrong with tacos and the chicken and steak are especially good. My go-to meal for dinner is the Bisteak ala Mexicana. My favorite carry out is chicken enchiladas with green sauce and my wife&#39;s favorite is the chicken nachos.

We have driven past Gianelli&#39;s many times and always thought &#34;we should try that place sometime.&#34;  Unfortunately, it always seems out of the way when we are feeling a craving for good Chicago Style fattening foods.

Well, I am here to say that all of you others out there should not be making the same mistake that we had been making since they&#39;ve opened.

We just did the drive thru, so that is the only experience that I can base my review on.  We placed our order and were greeted by a nice young dude.  We paid at the window and waited maybe 5-8 minutes (typical for a nice fresh gyro).  An older guy, who I believed to be the owner, handed us our food and was very pleasant.  The ride home (about 5 minutes) was very difficult, because the aromas coming from our piping hot bag was too much to resist. Once we had plated the food, my wife and I both devoured our tasty tasty gyros in no time. We said to each other &#34;these are the best gyros we have in a loooong time and much better than Tommy&#39;s or anything else that is nearby!&#34;

This place is very much a staple to those in Barrington, and after you pay a visit it is easy to see why. Why people would bother with the Starbucks located nearby when we have this place is beyond my understanding. It is located right in the heart of downtown Barrington on the corner of Cook and Station streets. &#34;Downtown&#34; is admittedly a bit of a parking nightmare, especially on the weekends, but the entire area is very walkable, so it is really not that big of a deal. They have a large outdoor seating area, which is a cool spot to post up and people watch while you enjoy your cup of joe. Wifi is both fast and free. The atmosphere is trendy and a tad on the pretentious side, but this is Barrington after all. Staff, on the other hand, is super friendly and inviting. 

They have all the standard coffee drinks you would expect to find, along with a specialty Latte menu that rocks! I recommend you try the &#34;Honey Bee&#34; which is made with local honey and lavender syrup. Yum! They have another called the &#34;7th heaven&#34; which has a caramel and macadamia nut flavor that similarly rocks my socks. They make all their flavoring sauces for the drinks here from scratch, which is what makes the taste so distinctive and memorable. 

Conscious Cup Coffee Roasters, located in Crystal Lake and also owned by these folks, provides all of the coffee and expresso beans for the drinks. I would describe the taste as less bitter than most (probably because it is a million times fresher since it&#39;s local) and of the light to medium bodied variety. It&#39;s really delicious but if you are used to Starbucks it will seem a tad weird when you take your first sip. 

I have managed to resist all their very delicious looking pastries that they offer up each day, so I am no help with that one, but their Panini&#39;s I have had a couple of times and they are quite good. Try out the Amarillo Chipotle with bacon (is anything with bacon bad?) and pepper jack or the Greek with Spinach and Feta.  

They do open at 6 in the mornings, which sounds like a great option to grab a cup on the way to work in the AM, but with Barrington Station right down the street for those that commute into the city, it gets crazy busy sometimes. 

Overall, this is a quaint little indie coffee shop that you should make a point to visit if you are in the area.",07/05/16,255,5,1,4,5,3.5817000000000005,2.1170000000000004,0.46499999999999997,19.417000000000005,No,2447

cook-street-coffee-barrington,Jennifer L.,lP2MfGE563YD6tD_egSZYw,9e8RSaTt1JJUmwKYLqKt7A,"I woke up this morning with a bad, bad, bad craving for scones.  And, I really did not want to trek all the way down to the city just to get one.  I figured that there *has* to be a local bakery selling a decent one.  

A quick search of Yelp directed me to Cook Street Coffee.  A local coffeehouse?  Why, yes, please!  I&#39;m always on the hunt for great local coffeehouses.  I made sure to look at the pictures and read the reviews to confirm that they do sell these little treats.

In twenty minutes, we were at the coffeehouse, which is located in a cute downtown area by the train station.  I thought it was really funny that there is a big name coffee chain literally located a few minutes from Cook Street.  I wanted to yell at the people sipping their beverages there and tell them to go to the local chain.  I resisted the temptation though.

It was pretty packed for being 9:30 on a Sunday morning.  There were several patrons dressed in super tight, Spandex biking gear, probably refueling after a long, hard bike ride.  There were groups of people sitting outside, sipping coffee and enjoying the beautiful morning.  I also noticed that there were several families with their little tots in tow.  That&#39;s definitely a good sign.

They brew Conscious Cup Coffee, which prides itself on roasting socially and environmentally sustainable coffees.  That is another big plus in my book.  Their menu is fairly extensive, and they serve a wide array of espresso beverages and iced drinks.  I was intrigued by the caramel vanilla latte, mainly because I&#39;ve never had both in the same drink.  For those that can&#39;t do dairy, they do offer soy and almond milk.  They also offer a 1% organic milk.

My beverage was amazing.  You could really taste the coffee coming through.  In addition, it wasn&#39;t overly sweet, which was my initial fear since it contained both caramel and vanilla.  I definitely would order it again.

My fianc̩ ordered a double espresso and he enjoyed the acidic taste to it.  He did have to add some sugar to it to make it a bit more palatable.  He prefers acidic espresso to the most burnt and bitter ones.

I did not leave without getting my hands on a scone. I really had to resist the urge to buy them all as there were only four left.  They offered a chocolate chip, blueberry and possibly cranberry or cherry almond.  I stopped paying attention after she said chocolate chip.  The scone was baked to perfection and had the right hard exterior and soft, crumbly insides.  Now, if only they offered it with some clotted cream and jam.  That&#39;d make it even more prefect.

They also offer a small selection of Spunky Dunker donuts for those who don&#39;t like scones.  I couldn&#39;t resist the donuts, and a glazed chocolate cake made its way into our order.  The donut was pretty good and I really liked the chocolate glaze.  

For those not into pastries in the morning (seriously - what&#39;s wrong with you), they offer a selection of breakfast paninis and sandwiches.

Service wise, the woman who rang me up and the woman who made my drink seemed nice.  We really did not interact with them that much.  You can eat your treats outside since they do offer outdoor seating.  Unfortunately, all the tables were occupied so we sat at a bench across the way.

The only downside were that the prices were pretty high.  My 12oz drink cost 4.70 (and perhaps more since I had it with soy milk).  We spent almost $12 total.  However, I believe it was worth it.  I&#39;d gladly spend that money and support a local business.  It&#39;s worth it.

I definitely have plans to visit in the future to try more of their coffee drinks and of course, to gorge myself on their amazing scones.  And, I&#39;d be interested to visit their location in Crystal Lake.  Big props to Yelp for this amazing find!",10/08/14,434,4,1,5,10,8.8528,7.891000000000002,2.07,44.03900000000001,No,3833

After visiting a few, I thought why not write reviews and share my thoughts on each of them. So here we are... with out any further ado let&#39;s dive right in to my unbiased review of Cook Street Coffee. 

First I will say, I also did a review of Conscious Cup Coffee Roasters and extremely impressed. I thought it was the best it could get! The owner sent me a message on yelp thanking me for the review, and recommended I visit his other location (Cook Street Coffee)... I was shocked to see that this location was better than the last! I have reviewed dozens of coffee shops, and so far... this is the best I have ever been to!

Location &amp; Ambiance:
Great location, and the ambiance is on par with the best of the best. The staff swiftly greeting me even though I got there only minutes after they opened. 

Coffee:
Well it is a coffee shop, so lets talk about the quality of my cup of coffee! First, take a look at some of the pictures I posted! The coffee looks great, and tastes even better! I got a small latte, and it tasted great! The milk was not burnt, the espresso was brewed correctly, and once again the staff was amazing! They recommended different drinks knew the ins and outs of coffee. 

Food:
I got there just after they opened and the increasable staff recommended that I try a scone! They had just been taken out of the oven so I tried the almond scone as well as the chocolate scone. Both were amazing, and complimented the great latte I was sipping on. 

Staff:
The staff, as I have mentioned throughout this review, it is by far the best staff I have even seen in a coffee shop. The other location, Conscious Cup Coffee Roasters, has a great staff as well but nothing compares to the experience I had at Cook Street Coffee! Its a 30 minute drive for me, and I will definitely be going back again!

Try a granita, which is comparable to a frappucino but with more rich coffee flavor. The hot cider is well-spiced and even better with a dash of caramel. Better still, their flavorful brews are local and sustainable. Hippie high five!

Try a granita, which is comparable to a frappucino but with more rich coffee flavor. The hot cider is well-spiced and even better with a dash of caramel. Better still, their flavorful brews are local and sustainable. Hippie high five!

Stopped in with the wife over the July 4th weekend about an hour before close.Only one person appeared to be working and was a little worse for wear but rose to the occasion. Had a mocha and the wife a tea. Both were great. The atmosphere was relaxing, music low key and we could actually carry on a conversation. There was ample seating for maybe 40. The d̩cor was tasteful and internet uninterrupted.

I think it also begs to mention that they offer grounds for composting and the solo-cops are actually compostable...so they go the extra mile to do a little bit for the planet.

I was quite dismayed as I approached Station heading north on Hough because on the corner is a Starbucks!  I thought for a few moments that this place had been bought out.  I turned on to Station anyway and was pleasantly surprised to find the shop IS there, just a few doors down.  It&#39;s still frighteningly close to &#34;that other place&#34;.  I hope they survive and thrive despite that!

I was very pleased with both my purchase and the service!!  I got a pumpkin bar- it was yummy with a flaky crust and I got a soy chai latte- it had the perfect amount of froth which I wasn&#39;t expecting.  I LOVE froth!

did you ever have food? did you run out? why does your website say you have food? Why can&#39;t you give me something to work with? 

I can already tell you have pastries! ughhhh

I got it and booed so loud in my head that it might have gone telepathic.
(specifics: it was closer to a cappuccino, milk was too hot, and only a distorted taste of coffee could be tasted through the congestion of milk)

I had forgotten what real espresso tasted like! Most coffee shops have switched over to automated espresso machines (the machine does all the work) because they are easier for the employees to operate...but not Cook Street. They hand pull all of their espresso shots, and that combined with their special fair trade beans produces a delicious, creamy, smooth shot of espresso for your latte or mocha.
The staff is primarily young people (20-30&#39;s), but they are friendly and take pride in working for a independently owned coffee shop (which you dont see much of anymore). The wait is usually a bit longer than other places especially if they ate busy, so give yourself extra time if youre in a hurry.

A couple weeks ago my parents and I went over to my sister&#39;s place for games, drinks and to hang out. For dinner we planned to order in. My sister suggested IPK. She said her and her boyfriend order food from there all the time and it&#39;s really good. However, she said their pizza wasn&#39;t her favorite but she has loved everything else. 

So why, did I decide to order pizza? Who knows. I blame my decision on the bottle of wine I drank prior.

I claimed not to be super hungry so my mom and I split a 12 inch pizza. We went with the Bianca which consisted of fresh ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan on thin crust topped with your choice of broccoli or spinach (we had spinach). Then all of that is drizzled with extra virgin olive oil (no red sauce).

It was definitely tasty. Not my absolute favorite pizza, but a good combo for sure. My main complaint was that their was too much spinach. It was literally a thick layer of chunky spinach laying under all that delicious cheese. Too much for me.

The delivery was timely and everything came hot. My dad got an Italian beef sandwich which looked really yummy, and so did the other burgers/sandwiches that were ordered. I thought prices were reasonable as well.

I&#39;ll for sure be enjoying their food again since it&#39;s a staple spot for my sis. Can&#39;t wait to dive into their menu outside of pizza, because they offer a lot of other options!",02/02/15,176,3,2,5,30,4.357600000000001,2.8499999999999996,0.911,19.239,No,1581

I know the owner of Italian Pizza Kitchen values input, as both the +1 and I were contacted following our last reviews. He included his number and offered an &#34;improved experience,&#34; which was thoughtful. I hadn&#39;t accepted because, though the sentiment is nice, I just feel uncomfortable about it. Anyhoo, we decided the extensive menu and coupon were enough incentive to give them another shot.

We ordered Take Out: a Shrimp + Spinach Linguine and an 18&#34; thin crust with spinach + half anchovies. I was quoted 25-30 minutes (they&#39;re 10 minutes away).

I arrived on time (7:45) and my order was taken out of the warmer. When I got home and my +1 saw the pizza:

&#34;How does it go again? &#39; Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me?&#39; &#34; 

The cheese was half hardened and the pasta lukewarm, so we had to reheat it all. Makes me wonder how long it sat.

The linguine was cooked well and the sauce was tasty, but the shrimp were SUPER salty (frozen/brine). They included a sandwich roll which felt pillowy and soft in the cellophane. Oh, and a little packet of parmesan cheese: nice!

As for the pizza: it had LOTS of cheese. Heavy, oily cheese (no Lowfat Moz here!) and a too-hard and really bland crust. IMO the only flavorful part was the sauce, which is a shame. Definitely sad I ordered such a large pie because the bf wants nothing to do with it.

The fam and I rolled in on a sleepy Saturday afternoon, looking to fill our bellies and not upset anyone in a more upscale restaurant by bringing a 14 month old. We had the whole place to ourselves, which worked out well since they only have a handful of tables and one highchair. Score! The folks behind the counter were super sweet and helpful, welcoming the three of us as we made our way through their plentiful offerings. 

I sampled quite a bit but here are a few standouts...

Cheesy garlic bread: A thick coating of flavorful, garlicky cheese atop toasty bread. Yum fest all around. 

Caprese sandwich with pesto: Very fresh bread stuffed with an ample portion of thick mozzarella medallions, bright tomato, a drizzle of balsamic and a delicious spread of pesto. The sammie was large and in charge, ensuring that I had a sizeable lunch the next day. 

Gnocchi with sauteed spinach: I&#39;m not kidding when I say the portions are huge. My daughter ate some, I ate some, my husband ate some, my daughter ate some the next day for lunch and we *still* have some left. The gnocchi were none too soft, covered in a zesty marinara and a decent serving of sauteed spinach scattered about.

I&#39;ve tried branching out a lot at this place and keep getting disappointed. Today I tried their Gnocchi Florentine. I wasn&#39;t expecting miracles because it&#39;s a pizza place but it was just... disappointing. Despite the abundance of spinach, ricotta and tomatoes... it was just really bland. Not surprisingly, the gnocchi is probably store bought so it was just ok.  

The thing that made me super frustrated was the quality of their containers. I only work about 3 minutes away. When I got to my office, the paper bag holding my gnocchi was leaking. I didn&#39;t even have to open the paper bag because the top literally peeled off because it soaked through so much. The top of the pasta container was the flimsiest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. It looked like I could peel off the foil on the paper top and it was soaked too. Everything they gave me (napkins, utensils, parmesan cheese packages) were soaked too.

Luckily I had an extra tupperware in my car otherwise I would have had to throw away the second half of my gnocchi.

Today I stopped by and ordered their Linguini with chicken and broccoli for lunch. I thought the price tag of $13.50 was pretty high. I assumed the pasta dish was either really gourmet or descent but a ton of food. Unfortunately it wasn&#39;t even descent. It was so nuclear hot that it was burning my tongue - clearly microwaved. Also half of the broccoli was rotten. It was completely black and mushy. Overall very disappointed. I&#39;ll continue to order pizza but will not order anything else off the menu moving forward.

It was reminiscent because I ate them all the time growing up in high school. They call it stuffed garlic sticks here. They add a bit of parmesan &amp; parsley on top &amp; cook it to a perfect golden brown stuffed with mozzarella cheese, served with marinara dipping sauce on the side.

I ordered two 16&#34; thin crust pizzas; one with mushroom &amp; pepperoni, the other with Italian beef &amp; giardiniera. I must say.. OMG .. can they make a pizza! Its not soggy at all &amp; they use Serano cheese (I believe), which just dominates all the pizza places around here. They were generous with the giardiniera &amp; had a great ratio of italian beef as well. 
I&#39;ve also ordered their Cod fish sandwich here over 4x now. The fish is a nice thick cut fried to a nice crisp &amp; topped with cheese, romaine &amp; as much tartar sauce as you&#39;d like. I honestly forgot but it miiight come with a tomato slice, lol. The bun is nice &amp; airy with an oily sheen on top. Everything paired well together.
I also had a side of spuds which were nice, my favorite is mozzarella &amp; pesto. The only problem is now they use crinkle fries, back maybe more than half a year ago they used actual &#34;spuds (wedges of potatoes, skin &amp; all),&#34; now their the frozen fries identical from the ones at White Castle.

Today was my second time experiencing Italian Pizza Kitchen and honestly it will be my last! Two months ago I ordered the margarita pizza and it was cold, flavorless and lacked cheese. Since it was my first time, I chose not to complain. 

Well today I gave them a second chance and when I placed my order I mentioned to them the issue I had with my previous pizza. This time I decided to add a few ingredients (similar to my favorite pizza place) hoping it would be just as good. Their margarita pizza normally only comes with plum tomatoes, fresh basil, olive oil and topped with mozzarella cheese. I added garlic and marinara sauce to give it added flavor. I also asked that they make sure it has cheese on it throughout and that it be hot.  

HERE WE GO.....
The pizza arrived and I was APPALLED! It was once again cold,dry, and lacked cheese. It looked like crackers. Not to mention they did not put the plum tomatoes on the pizza. To make things worse, I called and spoke with Carmen (manager) and he was extremely rude. He was not empathetic to the situation at all and even tried going tit for tat with me. He told me the tomatoes were not added because I added marinara sauce. REALLY! When you add something it doesn&#39;t mean take something away! Then he referenced my  previous experience as told to the order taker telling me &#34;you had an issue last time too&#34;. You right, I did and I was reassured it wouldn&#39;t happen this time. He went on to tell me that margarita pizzas are not suppose to have much cheese on them! WHERE IS HE GETTING HIS INFORMATION FROM??? Every margarita pizza I have had had plenty of mozzarella cheese on it. He told me the pizza came out of a 500 degree oven then boxed and sent directly to me. Well, I don&#39;t know what happened between it coming out of the oven and delivered, but it was very cold. He kept asking me if I wanted a new one sent out with my tomatoes added and I told him NO! If they messed it up twice why would I give them a third try? I told him I wanted something else or my money refunded. He placed me on hold. Then Rosa (owner) picked up and was very empathetic. She apologized and was more interested in rectifying the problem. I ordered the boneless buffalo wings with blue cheese dressing and they were okay. 

Ultimately, I was not charged for the $19 crackers but I do not think I will be ordering from here again. Sorry, but I can get a better pizza for less than $10 at Domino&#39;s. Perhaps things could have been different if I had better customer service.

We actually found them here on, Yelp! After reading many good reviews, we gave it a try.. we are thrilled that we did! 

We ordered many different things, over the course of two months. (Yes, I will admit- we became a slightly addicted to their food! Ordering four times in one week! No joke!)
First being Alfredo with stuffed cheese  ravioli- which was very good!! I find it to be a rather hard challenge.. Finding good pasta dishes when ordering in. 
Their wedges are AMAZING! Not only are they good, it&#39;s a huge order. We&#39;ve tried basically all of the different ways they can be made, we love them all. 

Their pizza has to be one of the best pizza joints around. No joke! We are pizza snobs.. Not only was the pizza piping hot when it arrived, when we would reheat the left overs, the pizza tasted just as good as it did when arriving after being freshly made. 
Their cold subs are pretty good. However, I was a little weirded out, when mine came with four huge fresh mozzarella balls. (Yes, they were huge and round, they basically took over the sub.) their bread is always very fresh. 
Chicken is pretty good! It came with four to five rather large prices, along with fresh bread, cole slaw and wedges. Chicken is always very fresh, warm and very crispy. 

We also tried their out if this world amazing brownies. Yummy! We heated ours up, and added ice cream. You just cannot go wrong with that dessert. Cheese cake was very good- typical Eli&#39;s brand. 

Only one item we ordered, that we sadly ended up throwing out after the first bite. Sadly, it&#39;s one of our favs..fried zucchini. They also do not serve it with any type of sauce. They were SO mushy! Honestly, they were gross. 
After ordering many times, we finally received a coupon for 30% off our entire order. Awesome! Well, not so much when we called to place our order. The gal taking our order ended up being slightly rude, when we mentioned our coupon. Asking us over and over again what code was printed on the coupon. Almost not believing us, that they in fact had a coupon out for 30% off! (They staple it to the box, and no coupon code is provided on the coupon)
In the long run, we did receive 30% off. 

Overall, great place with great food! Only wish they offered more coupons then the one 30% off coupon we received after placing many orders. (20 plus)",21/03/14,311,4,3,5,91,12.5055,11.346,2.551,30.102000000000004,No,2455

I&#39;ve tried many different varieties of pizza here...favorites below:
Buffalo Chicken Pizza - this is unlike any buff chick pizza I&#39;ve ever had. It is so incredibly cheesy, delicious and stuffed full of flavor! My only recommendation is ask for it to be made without onions or bacon. Trust me, I LOVE bacon but it&#39;s gotta be crispy and it is not when in the pizza. The onions are too much for this pizza. Ask for extra ranch!
Margarita - this is my second fave. Again, another pizza I&#39;ve tried at many different places, but IPK does it the best.
Standard sausage/pepperoni/cheese - even the norm is incredible.

We&#39;ve spent several hundreds of dollars with this Roselle location in deliveries over the past 3 months. When we ask about using a coupon on their menu we just got from them about a week ago for free wings, they said the coupon was expired end of February. We looked and found it was in fact expired. When we got our food we got a new menu, which still had the February expiration date on it, except it now has a rubber stamp date on it til July. How can they send out a menu with coupons that have expired then refuse to take them, only to send you more showing expired but altered with a rubber stamp???? When we called today to complain and get the wings refunded back to us for last nights order we were turned down..saying they can&#39;t give away the business. Well, they just gave up my business. If they can&#39;t see their way to honor a coupon they know is expired when they give it to me and then send me another one with a rubber stamp date over the pre-printed date which is expired, they don&#39;t need my business. Their food is good, kinda pricy but food quality was worth it. That said no amount of good food can negate to poor customer service and misleading menus that seem to be out of date, misleading on products available and misleading on coupons offered, at least as the mood fits them. No more business from us, they will be a few hundred dollars less profitable now, hope it was worth the trade off vs just honoring your coupons.

(UPDATE #2)
Owners contacted us only after seeing negative review on Yelp saying they wanted to make things right...after 2 phone calls the previous day to try to make this right they now WANT to make things right after seeing posting in Yelp. My fiance called and spoke with one of the two owners but they were only willing to make things right, ON THEIR TERMS. What started out as wanting them to honor a coupon THEY SENT US IN THEIR MENU A WEEK AGO FOR FREE WINGS AND THEY REFUSED TO DO AT THE TIME OF THE ORDER,  them saying it was expired, only to have them send us our order the other night with the same menu, same expired date of February 28th but then a rubber stamp over that saying expired July, and in the owners reply to me in Yelp acknowledging both the clerk who took the order, and the other owner who we called yesterday should have honored the coupon and refunded us...was only recognized after they are called out in public here on Yelp. Still, they then expect that just a coupon or a future discount will suffice....not a chance after putting us through all this when all we wanted in the beginning was them to honor the coupon THEY sent us.

Their solution:  place ANOTHER order with us and we&#39;ll give you a % off.  What the % off was he never said.  Nonetheless, making the customer happy should be on the customer&#39;s terms NOT management who screwed up in the first place.  I requested half off my 70.00 bill.  Lets face it, the order taker blew it, her manager blew it and then the 2nd manager only took 1 step forward to correct it but only on THEIR terms.  Sorry.  Three days of inconvenience and aggravation isn&#39;t worth your unknown % off.  They don&#39;t need our business, that&#39;s evident.  And now they&#39;ve lost it.

Their menu is HUGE and everything on it looks delicious.  Therefore, I had a hard time narrowing down my choices!  Wahwah.

We ordered around 6 pm on a Saturday night, and our food was going to be delivered within the hour (it was!!)

We ordered:
8 buffalo wings (bone in)
Medium thin-crust pizza w/ half cheese and half sausage
Tortellini Veneziana (sans the peas--I megaloathe peas)

Let me just say that everything was amazing.  EVERYTHING.  My husband likes his wings hot, and I am pretty white when it comes to spice pallets.  We both agreed that these wings were a great compromise.  The flavor is REALLY good, and then the heat sort of sneaks up on you.  So it was the best of both worlds, in my opinion.  They were really meaty, too.  There&#39;s nothing worse than bony wings!

The pizza was really, really good.  It wasn&#39;t TOO saucy, the cheese was delicious, and the crust wasn&#39;t soggy at all, which I loved.  The sausage was spiced well and completely delicious.  I can&#39;t wait to try more of their pizza!

My favorite part of the meal, however was the tortellini.  It was stuffed with Asiago cheese, and was nestled in one of the best-tasting alfredo sauce I have ever had.  All of the cflavors worked so well together.  And it wasn&#39;t swimming in the sauce, but there was plenty of it.  It was the perfect balance!

I cannot WAIT to try more from Italian Pizza Kitchen.  It was affordable, delicious, and fast.  I am really impressed!",03/06/13,184,5,3,5,57,9.152899999999999,6.102999999999999,0.617,19.28,No,1569

I happened to discover Italian Pizza Kitchen when we attempted to order pizza for lunch at my place of work. Our usual place had just gone out of business.  The other nearby places weren&#39;t open for lunch, so I called Italian Pizza Kitchen.  The pizza was great and everyone at the office really enjoyed it.  The ingredients including cheese were all very generous and the prices not out of line.  We&#39;ve since been ordering from them on a regular basis.

EDIT:  So the owner invited me back to try his new recipe for their crusts, and I agree the crusts are MUCH better.  That time I ordered I think the staff may have known why I was getting another pizza though because it had more than the usual amount of toppings (good for me !), and the next time the topping were more the normal amount.    The toppings taste fresh and the staff was nice.  So I&#39;m upgrading them to a 4 star :)

With so many pizza places in the area, they should have better service, as their food IS that much better than their competition.

I had Lou Malnati&#39;s first, and seriously wondered why people think it&#39;s worth it.  Never had a good pizza from Lou&#39;s!  Gino&#39;s East wasn&#39;t any better.  Uno&#39;s was okay, but Giordano&#39;s really showed me that deep dish pizza could be delicious.

Okay, so you&#39;re probably wondering what that has to do with Italian Pizza Kitchen.

I have had their thick crust pizza several times  and really enjoyed it, but only for the first time recently did I have their deep dish pizza and it was fantastic!  Slightly buttery (non cornmeal-type) crust.  The sauce was perfectly seasoned, with a slight marinara taste.  The cheese was perfect and there was so much of it.  Good pizzas do not skimp on cheese!  We had it with two ingredients and they tasted really good.

In quality, IPK&#39;s deep dish is comparable to Giordano&#39;s (and far, far, far x100) better than Lou&#39;s or Gino&#39;s East.  In price, it was better than any of the chain places.  If you&#39;re in the Roselle area, don&#39;t waste your time or money on those chains.

While i waited for it i ordered a slice of cheese pizza since the pepperoni was in the oven. It was a little cold and the cheese wasnt melty and stringy, but the flavor was on point. Dont knkw if sauce is house made, but it has a lot of flavor and they didnt use too much sauce, just the way i like my pizza, a little on the dry side so good job there. My sandwich took around 10 minutes to come out, but i was still working on my slice of pizza so i didnt mind. Btw, for $3.25 the slice was pretty big. Finally my cheesy beef came out and lord it looked amazing. Roast beef with mushrooms and onions covered in melted cheese, what more could you want!

Over a six-week period, I know we visited this place at least seven times!  Each time, we ordered something to eat in and something else to take home!

The food, in general, at Italian Pizza Kitchen is fantastic.  The ingredients are fresh and &#34;Mom&#34; puts it all together.  The tortellini is amazing!  Everyone in my party, two to six on each visit, was thoroughly satisfied with their dining choice.

The pizza is what sets this place apart.  The secret, and I shall not tell, is in the cheese.  It is the best cheese I have tasted in a long time... reminiscent of that used years ago at Rosie&#39;s Pizza in my hometown.  Of all of the Chicago staples - Geno&#39;s, Nancy&#39;s, Giordano&#39;s, etc. - none of them have it!  Because of that reason alone, IPK is my top choice for pizza in Chicago, and it&#39;s well worth the drive to Roselle!

Since I&#39;m from Barrington, I go here every time I&#39;m in back in town. Even though I&#39;m not a regular, each and every time, I feel at home. The bartenders are awesome. The drinks are cheap. Even their food is good (try their grilled cheese). It&#39;s a great place to hang out in Barrington on a Friday night. Thankfully, it&#39;s not a shabby, sketchy bar in town where old men would hang any more. It definitely gained back it&#39;s reputation from over the years.

I started coming here after I graduated college. It&#39;s definitely an interesting crowd. It&#39;s mainly middle aged to older townies looking to grab a drink with neighborhood friends. Then, mixed in, you have the young crowd who come back from college. 

The vibe, overall, is really what you make of it. Whether you&#39;re here for a drink or two to grab a drink or two with a friend or play darts with a group of people, there&#39;s really something for everyone. There&#39;s a jukebox to the side to jam out on a Friday night and a gigantic Jenga that&#39;s always fun to play tipsy. Just fair warning, if you&#39;re a townie like myself, you will probably ALWAYS run into someone you know.",23/11/15,143,4,2,5,24,6.058,3.388,0.113,13.498,No,1253

yankee-doodle-inn-barrington,Ashley A.,Um_THfGSE0ND5LAQUyrobg,EMUapRKgtT1ZgjA1t96u4g,"There are not many bars in Barrington and I wanted to check out a place I had not been to yet, so my boyfriend suggested Yankee Doodle. It is sort of hidden in what seems like a mini strip mall in the back corner of the building, adjacent to the Barrington Metra train station parking lot. 

It is a divey bar and not very spacious. They have jukebox and fireplace (but it wasn&#39;t on, which would have been great considering it was such a cold night). Washrooms (at the least the women&#39;s) were not very clean. The patrons consisted of both a younger crowed (20&#39;s &amp; 30&#39;s) and older adults; it was probably a 60/40 ratio.

The beer selection was decent. It&#39;s getting to the point where I&#39;ve tried so many beers that not every bar has ones that I have not had yet, but Yankee Doodle did have a few. I can&#39;t remember which beer I ordered, but it was new to me and a special of the day. 

The thing that irked me about this bar was the bartender. She was plain rude. I told her nicely I needed a minute to decide on a beer and when I was ready to order, I looked her right in the eyes, we made eye contact, yet she still walked away &amp; basically ignored me. I continued to look up and right at her, an obvious signal that I&#39;m ready to order. She even took the order of a guy standing next to me, even though I had been standing there before him. I gave up and had one of the guys I was with order for me. Surprise, surprise, she waited on him. Seems like she picks the males to wait on, maybe in hopes of getting a better tip. Luckily, there was also another older male bartender behind the bar, so for the next round, I ordered through him.

Another thing that tainted my impression of this bar was during the last few minutes before the bar closed. The bartenders announced that if everyone wasn&#39;t finished with their drinks by time the exact closing time came around, they would collect the drinks regardless if you were finished or not. I&#39;ve actually experienced this at one other bar, but it seems these people enforced the rule more so. I understand the bartenders probably wanted to get out of there as any employee usually does at the end of a shift, but you have to understand it&#39;s a bar! It&#39;s one thing to keep announcing that the place would be closing soon or that everyone needs to get out (after the closing time). I&#39;ve seen many bars do that, otherwise they would have belligerent drinkers sit around all night, but to take paid drinks away is plain rude, in my opinion. 

I really can&#39;t see myself ever returning to this bar, mostly because of the rude service. I&#39;d rather drive to another town than to go here again, even though it&#39;s probably one of the closest bars to my house.",09/03/12,300,2,1,3,-34,2.5208,1.888,1.0819999999999999,23.029999999999998,No,2761

Having searched around and read reviews, I decided to give it a go. I was blown away! My go to is a thin cheese with garlic buttercrust, and sometimes I will throw bacon on it.

The crust is nice and thin and has a fantastic cracker - like crunch to it. The cheese is decent, but the parmesan and oregano seasoning adds the necessary flavor.

The staff seems to be one close family. They are always friendly, honest and sincere. On my second pickup, they burnt my pizza. I work in the industry, so I understand these things happen. The cashier told me right away, told me about how long it would be, offered a larger size at no additional cost and offered a drink while I waited. Mistakes happen and how they recovered was pretty much textbook, leaving me as satisfied as i would have been without an error.

Basically, this place is doing it right in all departments.",23/07/15,116,5,2,2,23,1.6077999999999997,1.4409999999999998,0.40800000000000003,12.15,No,1008

At least one of them is always there taking pride in their business and always greeting you with a smile. They seem to treat there staff well because the same employees have been with them forever, always friendly and making you feel welcome. 

If you and your family, group of friends/co-workers or just yourself is looking for a quick hot meal, this is the place to go.

So, my mistake, I accidentally called Palatine and not the Elk Grove location like I intended. (I could walk to the Elk Grove location from my home if I wanted.) I show up at the Elk Grove location to pick up my order and was given a kind but quizzical look from the cashier. She asked if I could have possibly ordered from the Palatine location (which I didn&#39;t even know they had). She immediately called the palatine location to confirm my order. She was more than helpful by also getting the address and Google mapping it to let me know how long it would take to get there from Elk Grove. After learning it would be a 17 min ride I was very hesitant about having to drive 40 mins round trip to get the pizzas. The palatine store offered to deliver them and I graciously accepted! They must have left right then &amp; there because my pizzas were at my door in almost exactly 20mins. To top it off the driver apologized and was thanking ME for allowing them to deliver the pizzas and was refusing my tip to boot!

Everyone who works at Run-A-Way is supremely friendly, and their prices are ridiculously low.

This is relatively new ownership picking up the pieces of two popular Irish joints that found a way to fail. From my perspective, this is a crescendo of popularity...customers are not &#34;Running-A-Way!

Most &#34;Good Food Fast&#34; joints do not have a booze bar to accommodate your attendance. In my world, most would or could or should.

Basically this a family run operation, a huge dining area and a booze bar partitioned by wood and glass. The major change from past ownership is the flat top and char broiler are now a public spectacle. They cook up some decent grub.

I kind of view this as a hot dog joint that offers a side salad resembling a16oz PBR. But NO! The menu is extensive to the point of...well, more choices than you might expect! For all you slugs, they offer a &#34;Late Risers&#34; breakfast menu. For us normal people that have a liquid breakfast at an appropriate hour, the meat and potatoes offerings are extensive for lunch and dinner. You can order a gyros and fries or...&#34;Chicken Vesuvio&#34; with garlic potatoes, garlic toast and choice of soup or slaw for $8.95. Is this a Harry Caray&#39;s rendition? Hell No! They forgot the peas.

Back to the family run operation...I never ask names. The usual suspects here are &#34;Grandma&#34;, the &#34;Dad&#34;, his &#34;Kid&#34; and his &#34;Bride to Be&#34;. They hold court here daily.

I usually have salad for lunch 2-3 days a week.  I&#39;d like to see a little more of a variety of vegetables on some salads, but there are certainly enough to choose from with options like additional gyros or chicken.

Speaking of gyros; best I&#39;ve ever had.  And the fries are awesome!  Crisp on the outside and hot and tasty on the inside.

The rotisserie chicken is a dinner favorite for my wife and me and the burgers are pretty good (4 out of 5) and the steak sandwiches are tasty.

The beef or chicken noodle soups are very good.

They have pepper and egg sandwiches on the regular menu, but among the sub sandwiches, no traditional Italian.

The owner is a great guy and will customize your order.  I always get a &#34;low carb plate&#34; and that can come several ways I like.

They have beefs and hot dogs that are very good too.

The waitstaff are very friendly and helpful.

The interior has been freshened up and modernized, much brighter than the Elmer days. We grabbed seats at the bar which was nice because it was separated enough from the restaurant so i coud sip beers without listening to parents trying to entertain their children. Pretty solid bottled beer selection, decent variety of hard liqours, only Bud Lighht on tap, but you can get by. The menu has a variety of traditional American favorites with a smattering of delicious Greek staples. The portions are all gigantic, while the prices stay reasonable, and the service is casual and super friendly.

run-a-way-restaurant-north-aurora,Dan S.,81fr37MM4GR62S2yvOt3gA,qpAkmrBHhpaXRI-cpwPziA,"I&#39;ll pre-face this review by saying I rarely give 5 stars to anything unless everything is spectacular.   

I pass this place twice everyday and have always been curious about it.  With today being a holiday for me but not Kelly and based on all the other Yelp reviews, curiosity finally won out &amp; I went there for lunch today.  I had mentioned it as a lunch option occasionally to Kelly but she was a bit leery as the place does look like your standard dive from the outside.  

The place is interesting inside.  It&#39;s definitely older, divey looking place with a  dark wood decor.  Very wide open place inside with plenty of tables.  It&#39;s probably 2/3 sit-down restaurant/tables while the 1/3 is comprised of a bar area and fast food counter to place your order if you don&#39;t want to be sit first and be waited on.  The menu is diverse with a variety of samiches, salads, etc.  However, don&#39;t be fooled by the sit down portion of the place:   the core of the menu, while diverse, still revolves around  hot dogs, burgers, chicken and gyros.   

I walked in at lunchtime and was offered the option to order at the counter or sit down &amp; be waited on. As the place had 15-20  patrons (most of whom appeared to be regulars as the one waitress and other help were  talking to several people at length by name), I approached the counter.  I  was greeted by a  nice older greek/italian gentleman with a bit of an accent that I couldn&#39;t quite understand at first.  After a few minutes perusing the menu &amp; a few failed attempts on my part to completely understand him more due to poor hearing than the accent, I went with the grilled chicken samich in a pita with fries &amp; pop for $7.  While the staff and menu appeared to be heavily Greek-based with the  gyro the lead horse on the menu, I was trying to be somewhat healthier by ordering the chicken. I was given my fountain pop cup &amp; was told to take a seat and the food would be delivered shortly.  

After about 5 minutes, just enough to catch up with all things the debacle known as Richard Sherman from the Seahawks-Niners game,  my samich &amp; fries came out.  While the samich wasn&#39;t quite what I had envisioned, it was very good.  I was expecting your standard big pocket pita split on top with chicken, tomato, mayo, lettuce, etc all jammed inside.  What I was given was some thin pita bread akin to regular bread in 2 fairly large triangular wedges.  The pita, for as thin as it was, was very good.  The chicken was cooked perfectly:  fresh, tender, juicy, flavored well.  The fries were your standard, thicker cut, regular fries but good,  plentiful &amp; cooked just the way I like my women:  hot &amp; soft with some saltiness and enhanced with a condiment.  After inhaling the first half of my hot samich, I was approached by the friendly waitress for a refill on my pop.  I gladly accepted since the standard issue 16-22 oz pop cup is about 1/3 required to sate my thirst.    The fountain pop had he proper carbonation to syrup ratio so that too was good...though it was from the Pepsi family.  Always had a stronger preference for Coke products. 

All in all, the staff were all very nice &amp; friendly.  The food was very reasonably priced and tasty.  While not &#34;blow me away&#34; good, for $7,  I definitely got my money&#39;s worth and would go back. If you can not judge a book by it&#39;s cover, give this place a shot.  This place is definitely not one you should &#39;run-a-way&#39; from and a welcome option to your standard fast food meals.",20/01/14,391,4,3,5,56,7.513000000000001,4.524000000000001,0.857,26.619,No,3560

Goat Pepper Soup
Efo Riro - Spinach Veggie Soup served with Pounded Yam and side of plantains
Beans &amp; Corn Porridge
Ayamashe - green bell pepper with spice and herbs. serviced with white rice and fish
Jallof Rice - chicken in fresh tomato and sweet bell pepper puree with spices, side of plantain

My favorites? The goat pepper soup - AHMAZING!! Hot and spicy, just the way I like my soup. It would be great as a hangover meal...just saying. The Jallof Rice - it had a mole consistency and that&#39;s all I needed to know. The Ayamashe - just the right amount of spice in their pepper mix and I liked that the fish was a side.

We started off with the Moi Moi (bean cake) appetizer, which was delicious, gizzard and plantain, and the goat pepper soup. All were great.

bisi-african-restaurant-schaumburg,Jennifer P.,bDXSrl19qIe0Hb-cZcCJ5A,g_axNwD_fKPdWCL3uoU1eA,"I&#39;ve been wanting to try Bisi for-everrr. (Or so it feels.)

My +1 had his heart set on a &#34;suburban chain and/or theme restaurant&#34; for dinner. I talked him down from TGIFriday&#39;s  (Whaaat?! *eyeroll*) and we were en route to a kitschy tropical-themed place in Schaumburg. When we passed Bisi, he relented on the original plan and encouraged a u-turn. Yay! #win

Dec_r: Clean, spacious, minimal, with the white-tablecloth-with-butcher-paper thing going on, plus cloth napkins + a paper one. The booths seem a bit dated as compared with the rest of the place.  It has what looks to be a full bar.

We asked the owner&#39;s opinion on a few dishes. He explained they were out of beef for entr̩es (they had kabob apps, though) so meat choices were chicken, fish, and goat. We found out, while ordering, that there is a $2 upcharge for the goat, but we still went with it.

We ordered:
- Ayamashe w/goat
- Jallof rice w/goat
- Efron Riro w/fish
- one fruit juice


Verdict:

Ayamashe: 4/5
This was my favorite of the 3 dishes: the sauce had good flavor, moderate heat, and the goat was very tender on the inside. (If you&#39;re sensitive to heat, you might skip this one..) There was a LOT of rice and little meat/plantains, though, so disproportionate.


Efron Riro: 4/5
My second favorite. This was a spontaneous order on our part: after we put in the other two entree orders, my +1 noted the pillowy-looking fufu yam on the menu and was curious to try it. 

The fish was very good: crispy and flavorful. The texture of the yam was dense, but was a good use to help sop up the spinach and sauce. (I left the yam out in the leftovers, though, due to the heaviness of it, and just took the spinach.) The flavor of the spinach/sauce was good!


Jallof Rice: 3/5
I thought the flavors were pretty muted and plain. The rice was orangeish, but had minimal spice and depth of flavor. This dish had TWO pieces of goat.. AND a $2 upcharge on it? I found this disappointing and I think my guy did too.

Pre-tip total = $38


Service: Moderately attentive. It was a Thursday, and aside from a patron dining at the bar, we were the only others for 45 minutes or so. Water glasses were refilled, though, and the owner was nice in answering our questions.


In all, Bisi was a good culinary experience: Nigerian food FTW!  I would definitely get the Ayamashe again - with goat or fish - and would like to try some of the vegetarian options.",16/04/16,311,4,3,5,57,6.6842,4.115,0.286,25.598999999999997,No,2440

Bisi was suggested by one of my coworkers and I am glad we tried it. Bisi is hard to find, hidden in a little strip mall off of Roselle behind a light store and next to a flower shop. 

We came for lunch and we were the only ones there. I imagine this might be a livelier dinner location. It is a nice white table cloth dining setup but it did not feel too fancy for lunch. The bar area, lighting, fixtures, and art were all unique and very nice. 

We were served and helped by someone who presented themselves as if they may be the owner. He helped us through the menu and guided us on any questions we had. We ordered our dishes and asked us if we wanted any appetizers. He informed us it would be a minute to cook the items we ordered as everything was made fresh. We declined and waited patiently for what would turn out to be some great food.

I had the jallof rice with beef. I chose the beef as he advised this was the only meat that did not have bones. I went with this easy route. The rice, beef, and plantains were great and I can&#39;t wait to come back and try some more dishes. Specifically the egusi soup and maybe some fufu. 

*I also tried some of the Vita Malt which was describe like root beer. It was root beer-y but also quite thick. It went well with the food but could be a bit much to drink alone.

bisi-african-restaurant-schaumburg,Livvy O.,3_UzdLx7oQ4759Ho-5bGPQ,eCqVBIvVXkHNIyN8G5cdyQ,"So I fell into this place because I was heading  out to the Food Truck Extravaganza, but when I got there it was a hot mess. Lines all over the place and people waiting hours to get a snack. No Thank You!!! So I Yelped some high rated restaurants in the area and this one came up. I never had Nigerian food so decided it would be fun to try. 

I noticed a lot of restaurants in the area are in strip malls so I wasn&#39;t expecting much, but to my surprise the inside was very nice. You wouldn&#39;t have known it was in a strip mall. They had gorgeous art pieces throughout the restaurant. 

I wanted to order this Moi Moi (a bean cake), but they ran out so I ordered the beef kabob instead for an appetizer. I thought it came with a few - so I just ordered one order, but it was only one small kabob so I split that with my dinner mate. Very good, but I just thought I would&#39;ve gotten at least two for an appetizer. 

For my main entree - I got the beans plate. I love beans - I could literally live off beans and rice. You had the choice of rice or plantains so I got both because I like both! I did not like the beans, I was very disappointed. I really wanted to like them because I love pinto beans, but the flavor was unappetizing so I just ate the beef which was very delicious and tender with the rice and red sauce which I dipped my beef in. The side of plantains also came in handy - which were good. Kind of reminded me of a Latin dish with a mix of Indian spices. 

Overall, they have a small menu but lots of good choices to choose from. They sort there menu as vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The prices are very reasonable, especially with the portions they give  you. It had to be my cheapest and nicest dining experience.",20/04/15,188,4,2,5,32,4.7484,2.976,0.9470000000000001,18.077,No,1741

I walked in and was greeted by... Anthony, I think. We struck up a conversation because, well, I was the only person in at 11:30 on a Wednesday for lunch. A quick perusal of the menu let me to fufu (pounded yam) with goat, because there&#39;s no way I walk into an African restaurant and *don&#39;t* get goat.

The fufu is like a big, sticky mashed potato that&#39;s dropped on your place. You definitely want to eat this with the spinach and collard greens (or for the particularly adventurous, the crushed mango seeds) because it doesn&#39;t particularly taste like anything, but works really well with either of the previous two ingredients. The goat was tender, well spiced and flavorful.

The greens were cooked in garlic, ginger, and a whole lot of spices bloomed in oils. It was noticeably spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. And one thing is for sure--you get your money&#39;s worth with an entree here. To the best of my sensory knowledge, this is true, no-compromises African food.

I paired it with a ginger beer, originating from Jamaica and by far the spiciest ginger beer I&#39;ve ever had. Over ice it went very well with the fufu.

Bisi is a great place for the open-minded to gain an introduction to African food. Just to make that point, before I left I was offered a small bowl of mango seed (because I was so interested in it). I&#39;ve never had something so sticky and earthy before, and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d have it again, but I&#39;m glad it was offered to me nonetheless. I&#39;m very glad to have a friendly place like Bisi out here.",27/08/15,198,5,2,5,44,6.350700000000001,3.813,0.319,14.868,No,1754

Definitely prefer the wall booths away from traffic and other people. Food and service seemed hiccupy and the opposite of smooth... friendliness only makes up for a finite amount... unless you&#39;re in another country and on island time... go with the flow then...

Back to this... was not a fan of the meat kabob thing... tough and no flavor was detected... the Fish that came with the mashed root blob was good enough but not amazing... overall it was not a horrible dining experience but not stellar... prices being very reasonable made it okay... but personally not a fave.

bisi-african-restaurant-schaumburg,Cole D.,eXr-HXR7dCXHo9ecl4UtyA,GY1xSmigNzbwin1HP5JuPg,"Went here with my friend today.  We are both well travelled and are open to trying anything new.  

We went at noon on Wednesday and had the place to ourselves.  I didn&#39;t mind the intimacy and it allowed us to speak with the owner Anthony during the meal.  His wife Adebisi is the chef and owns the restaurant and he is the manager.

The restaurant is styled very nicely on the inside with a nice bar area.  One thing of note is that the right side of the restaurant has a wall with large pictures of Nigerian masks and sculptures which basically serves as a mini-museum about Nigerian culture.  It helped me appreciate what Bisi and Anthony are trying to do; diffuse Nigerian culture through food and context.

First we both ordered a Kenyan beer.  Anthony said that he has been looking for a Nigerian beer but the distributor he buys from doesn&#39;t carry any.  I hope he can find one, although I&#39;d never had a beer from any African country so I was still content.

I asked his recommendation and he suggested the corn and beans because it was simple but classic.  I was considering ordering the bean cake as an appetizer just to try it, and then he suggested it and I said sure.

The beer was good, pretty light and smooth but nothing to rave over.  Kinda tasted like a watery Stella.  

Next the bean cake.  I actually really liked this although it was super basic.  My friend and I discussed what flavors we were tasting and felt it was a good hybrid texture between the shell of an enchilada and mashed potatoes.  I was wondering if it is ever served with a sauce because that would have been fun to drizzle on top or dip pieces into.

I was glad there was a good vegetarian menu.  The options weren&#39;t hugely varied within the menu but there were small enough variations that you could change it up, although I would encourage Bisi to try to expand into more varied vegetarian dishes and eliminate some of the redundancies.  I&#39;m never too critical on plating with less traditional fare, and it is hard to attractively plate beans and corn in any dish.  The  tomato and bell pepper sauce was really what I was paying attention to and it was quite good.  The texture of the beans and corn was fine as well.  

All in all, I enjoyed speaking with Anthony and hearing about the restaurant.  I had never had Nigerian food before and it was great to try something that felt like home to him.  The restaurant is still in its beginning years (I believe around 2 years since opening) and I think they will continue to grow.

I would like to see more items on the menu.  Bisi is cooking the &#34;home style&#34; meals native to Nigeria...however, unlike Indian or Asian restaurants, there aren&#39;t flocks of Nigerians filling this restaurant.  I think adding a cosmopolitan flare would show the diversity in Nigerian cooking and the flexibility of its ingredients to lend itself to compliment and work with other cuisines from around the world.

I asked Anthony where the animals are slaughtered for the meat that he buys and he said on the South Side of Chicago in the only active slaughter house in the city.  The goats are slaughtered Halal which I anticipated but was not happy to hear.  He insisted the animals were humanely killed and had visited himself, but halal is known for not using anesthesia and is outlawed in many European countries.  I&#39;m fine leaving up to the government to address, but in the mean time, restaurants can make an impact and not purchase halal meat.

Overall, I enjoyed eating Bisi&#39;s delicious food and would recommend for anyone to stop by for lunch or dinner and enjoy a drink, a dish, and a chat to learn more!",08/07/15,375,4,3,5,94,11.275500000000001,5.572,0.461,28.967,No,3669

bisi-african-restaurant-schaumburg,Lan N.,OP2IxPFYj4lkoINZH5tZvA,wDhNxQ2XMwNjqB015E3Aqw,"Oxtail pepper soup:
Be warn, it is very very spicy! Its not a normal spicy either. The broth was flavored well, even though your mouth is on fire you can still taste the broth. The oxtail was tender and the meat fell off the bone. The only thing negative I had to say about it is that, I wish the broth had some type of vegetable in it. When I was eating it,  I wanted a carrot or a celery  or something to alleviate the spiciness and have a different texture.

Jallof rice:
It&#39;s always yelp reviewers to the rescue. Everyone said to tried to jallof rice. Good job everyone!  I was not daring enough to try goat meat, so I opt for boring beef instead. BUT! Boring is not what the beef was. The beef was very well flavored and the meat itself was tender and not chewy. It was a little dry though. The rice reminds of jambalaya rice because of the tomatoes and bell pepper puree they used. I thought the flavoring in the rice was good, not too salty and not too bland. Dish is served with plaintains.

Ayamashe:
Basically, it is a rice with choice of  spicy meat cubes. We had the goat meat. Again, the meat was tender and flavored well. The rice was not as flavored as the jallof rice. But when you mix the meat into the rice, that&#39;s where the flavors come into play. It is a spicy dish, like the oxtail soup. Dish is served with plaintains.

You have to look for it a little - it is in a strip mall hidden from Roselle Road from an outbuilding that blocks it. But, don&#39;t let that stop you.

The first thing you notice when you walk in is how clean and well decorated it is. It is sparse, but very clean lines and not overwhelming with decor. The have a small bar that only features wine and beer.

The menu does not have too many options which was fine for us, not knowing anything about African foods. The server (I believe the owner) was very welcoming and helpful explaining the options on the menu.

My son and I both sampled the only African beer they carry, Tusker. It is like a light European lager. We also shared an appetizer - Gizzards and plantains. They combination was wonderful - sweet and savory. If you&#39;ve had southern style gizzards before, these were very different - they were tender and very tasty. The plantains were cooked perfectly - soft, sweet and not mushy like some can be.

For dinner, I had Aya Mase with rice and goat meat. This is not for the faint of heart - it is quite spicy. The server warned me ahead of time about the heat, so I was prepared. It was really great. Very tasty, very spicy. The goat meat was not gamy at all and very tender.

Jon had the Beans with rice and also chose the goat meat. The beans look a lot like Mexican refried beans, but have a distinctly different taste due to the use of a sweeter bean. It was also remarkable.

This is a first class restaurant that you should definitely try if you are around Schaumburg. We certainly will be back.",11/05/14,180,5,3,5,63,7.2532000000000005,5.092,0.324,20.584999999999997,No,1672

My husband and I started with the Oxtail Pepper Soup and Moi-Moi (Beans Cake) appetizers which actually complemented each other very well and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d ever eat either one by itself now after having had them together.  The soup was tasty with a bit of kick - actually just the right amount of heat for me and a little too mild for my husband (although he still thought it was delicious).

As an entree I tried the Egusi Soup with Fish and my husband had the Okra Soup with Goat.  Our server, who may also be the owner, figured out that we&#39;d be sharing so he suggested plantains as the side dish for one and fufu (pounded yam) as the side dish for the other (instead of the usual fufu with both).  Both entrees had amazing flavor that continued to build with each subsequent bite.  Delicious!

For an appetizer, we tried the moi-moi which was very very good. My husband got a malta drink to try (it was a thick molasses, root beer-ish drink) and he enjoyed it. Since it is very thick and sweet, he sipped it slowly and had water as well. To eat, he had the Ayamashe with goat. I only tried one bite since I can&#39;t handle spicy foods as well as him. It was too spicy for my taste, but he loved it. He had plantains with it which were perfect. I had the Efo Riro with chicken and fufu. I really liked this dish and would have it again. The fufu was new to me. It reminded me of a steamed bun on the outside, but just like eating plain mashed potatoes in both taste and texture. 

It was a nice, enjoyable, and laid back dining experience. The owner was very kind and attended to all of the tables.

bisi-african-restaurant-schaumburg,Kevin N.,#NAME?,OjXnBYgUz2PM5c5X-OMlCA,"Wondering where to eat when you&#39;re in the IKEA / Woodfield neighborhood? Bisi African is a MUST visit! First and foremost, I am intrigued by cuisine I&#39;ve never tried. Other than Moroccan or Ethiopian, I&#39;ve never had the opportunity to sample African food, let alone Nigerian.  Nestled in a strip mall BEHIND the lighting store, you might never see this place. The owner Anthony said that he parked his delivery truck in the lot in front of the place so people could spot it. Since he lives in the northern suburbs, he decided to open a place closer to home rather than in the city, which explains the unusual location for this very unique restaurant.

What&#39;s special about Bisi is a warm, contemporary decor with booths along the window and a bar along half of the dining room. If you are wondering what to order or have questions about the menu, owner Anthony will graciously help you through the unusual offerings. We tried the spicy goat pepper soup and the gizzards and plantains as appetizers. The soup tasted much more flavorful than it looked, with a deeply spicy broth filled with the tenderest goat meat I&#39;ve ever eaten. Anthony shared his secret to a tender goat, braise it slowly! The gizzards and plantains also had some delicious spicing with diced plantains flash fried to finish them. 

For entrees we tried the spicy Aye Mase fish with steamed rice and the fufu (pounded yam) with spinach and goat. Both of these were amazing. Anthony told us he imported all of his spices from Nigeria to give his food a taste of home. 

The bar includes a couple of African beers as well as a lightly fermented palm juice which is definitely an acquired taste. I say stick with the beer!

Anthony and his partner went all in on this place, so let&#39;s give him some love and support! Bisi is his wife, hence the name. If you want to try some delicious food not on your radar, run to Bisi!",29/03/14,224,5,2,5,42,4.6932,2.235,0.224,18.541,No,1910

Next, I had the Moi Moi which had the consistency of masa from a t male. It was delicious with a different flavor that was nice as a tad spicy.

I have always wanted to try Nigerian cuisine but never had the courage before yesterday. I ultimately mentioned this place to a few friends and we agreed that it would be great to try as a group. As a result, I posted it as a Meetup and our group of thirteen had the feast of all feasts! 

The place is not your average ethnic restaurant. It is very contemporary, airy and upscale. The table linens cause you to do a double take when looking at the menu prices. Upscale dining for the price of Five Guys. To add to the initial shock, the service was phenomenal. The owners Anthony and Bisi are great hosts. From the initial reservation to our departure, we were treated like royalty. The service alone was worth the price of the food. 

Given the size of the group, it goes without saying that we tried many things on the menu. Here&#39;s an overview: 

Beef Kabob- served with onions and just enough kick to get your nose running. We all loved it!! .... It is one piece per serving for $2.49.     5 stars 

Moi Moi - a huge bean cake. It has a little flavor, similar to that of a tamale.  It was tasty but not a favorite.  3 stars 

Goat Pepper Soup - This is not for the weak. Very spicy, but amazing! Pieces of goat and in a broth.   5 stars 

Bean &amp; Corn Porridge - a vegetarian&#39;s dream. Great taste. If you need meat, there is an option for you too.   5 stars

Efro Riro - this was fabulous. Saut̩ed spinach mixed with collard greens, turkey meat and seasonings. It is also served with your choice of plantains or Fufu and meat (chicken, fish, beef or goat)   5 stars 

Jallof Rice - rice with tomato sauce, bell peppers and seasoning. One of their most popular dishes. It is served with plantains and your choice of meat. 

Ayamashe - spicy dish. I forgot to try it but everyone else enjoyed it. 

Gizzards and Plantains - it was enjoyed by everyone.   5 stars

We learned that meat portions are small because it is not largely consumed in their country. The pieces were small but just enough when paired with the other items. 

My favorite meats of the night were the goat and beef kabob. They were both well seasoned and packed with an amazing flavor. I absolutely enjoyed it and everyone else did too. The fish is whitting?? and it is served with the bone in. Easy to get off, but I recognize it discouraged a few. 

I also tried Malt India (a Puerto Rican beverage) for the first time here and it was absolutely divine.  5 stars",17/02/14,295,5,3,5,63,7.753499999999999,6.894000000000001,1.4000000000000001,34.706,No,2531

My gf and I flew to Schaumburg for a weekend (whee) and needed to get dinner on Saturday. Yelp led me to Bisi, and Yelp was not wrong - their food is spectacular. I had the spicy soup (oxtail, though it doesn&#39;t matter at all what meat goes in - the broth was to die for) and the Jallof rice. My gf had an equally amazing dish. The restaurant was mostly empty, which was mind-blowing, because they&#39;d be packed in any east or west coast city. The fact that all of the other patrons were black was not lost on me - methinks some casual racism might be at play. It could just be midwestern preference for bland food, too...

So anyway, I just had one of the best meals of my life at this suburban strip mall gem that opened a few days ago. I&#39;m not sure how familiar y&#39;all are with the suburbs and African food, but that&#39;s pretty much not a thing. Like, I can think of less than five places across this expansive Chicagoland burbs that allow a taste of the second largest (in size and population) continent on the planet, so this is a much needed and welcome addition to the area.

I&#39;ll be real, the outside is nothing to write home about, and the storefront is actually 100% hidden from street view so it makes it extra hard for them to get the word out. That and they (at the moment) are pretty bare bones as far as marketing tools. No website, no facebook, no PR team, but also no worries (Hakuna Matata, for those who weren&#39;t aware). This husband and wife team is so full of passion for Nigerian cuisine and the menu, rich with long-time family recipes, reflects that.

The inside is something else. Super chic, actually. I had to take a picture or you guys wouldn&#39;t believe me based on the outside, but inside is modern and there&#39;s a large, long bar (no alcohol served for now), rich colors, minimalist wall art, tall booths, and table seating for around 80 people. The menus are just the paper, pamphlet-style take-out menus, but that&#39;s A-Okay with me. They&#39;re just getting starting and for only being 3 days in, I think they&#39;re doing better than fine. 

I got to meet the owner, Anthony, who makes up the front of the house and he told me a bit about the business and why he and his wife started it. His wife started cooking when she was 6-years old with her grandmother and continued for the family, friends, guests in their home, and the food was so good (as I experienced today) that friends would come back and offer to pay her to cook for them. And Anthony worked for years as a server at the Ritz Carlton downtown, so he&#39;s more than familiar with first-class service flavor and service, and he and his wife decided it was high time to branch off and build out their own dreams. 

Anthony got me sat right away and asked if I had ever had Nigerian food before and then he asked a few questions regarding my personal and preferred tastes (do I prefer spicy, sweet, etc) and after telling him that I&#39;m a big fan of spice, but with the caveat that I&#39;m pescatarian (only veggies and sometimes fish - veg-aquarium, if you will) and Anthony was able to point me in the direction of their Jollof Rice dish with fish as my protein. 

The food came up quickly and Anthony was beyond patient explaining everything. The rice is cooked in peppers and fresh tomato - they don&#39;t do canned when there are so many great markets around to get fresh produce. My plate of food included the Jollof rice, three &#39;fish rolls&#39; and the best damn plantains I&#39;ve ever eaten. And that&#39;s saying something since I generally can&#39;t stand plantains, but these were unreal. Otherworldly, in fact. 

The &#39;fish rolls&#39;, which are not what they&#39;re actually called - just what I&#39;m calling them were phenomenal, but when you get your plate you should start with them as they&#39;ll lose their heat the fastest. They reminded me of the fish my Dad and I (mostly my Dad) would catch when I was a kid and then take home, gut, de-bone and fry up in a pan. To me, these were perfect little white-fish morsels. The only caveat is that there is a spine in these, but as soon as you cut in, the fish unfolds and the one line of bone comes right out, easy peasy.

The Jollof rice was perfectly spiced and reminiscent of South American flavors. The portion was heaping and I ended taking home half of it to eat as my dinner, and considering this hefty dish is only $9.99, you&#39;re getting quite the bargain on all accounts of price, portion and quality. I pretty much can&#39;t think of a better deal.

Beyond the phenomenal fare, the hospitality is second to none and honestly, would&#39;ve been happy just sitting their all day and chatting the young owners up... though I&#39;m mighty please that I got to dine as well. I&#39;m excited to head back (probably going again tomorrow, actually) and work my way through the rest of the menu, and while I know it&#39;s gonna take some time to get through the things I&#39;ve never had, but I&#39;m excited for the adventure to come. 

As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti, I too bless the rains down in Africa... or whatever the heck needs to get blessed to ensure Bisi becomes the booming &#39;burban business it deserves to be.

bisi-african-restaurant-schaumburg,Simon K.,cHosCNV53hqSUkmgm_f7Iw,QoCxnWJLBCrKUTUOIwKa_A,"Let&#39;s go quick and efficient:

- Gizzards with plantains: Best dish of the night. The sauce consists of red peppers and tomatoes and they shine in this dish. The slightly sweet taste goes perfectly with the not-so-chewy gizzard.
- Jollof Rice: Great flavor. Not sure what the flavor is, but my taste buds loved it. The fish that came with it was slightly underseasoned but was perfect when eaten with the rice. The goat was perfect and fell off the bone.
- Fried Rice: Not sure where the liver was but it wasn&#39;t a bad dish. It could have used a little bit more flavor as it paled in comparison to the Jollof Rice dish. The chicken was a little dry.

But the best part of the experience was talking to the owner. He explained what went into the sauces and answered any questions we had. We ended up staying later than any other customer but he didn&#39;t hurry us at all. And when we finally did leave, he wasn&#39;t around but he made the effort to come outside to tell us good-bye.

Great experience, although, their interior decor could use some work. For those that judge a book by the cover, Bisi might not interest them. But for those willing to see what&#39;s inside, you&#39;ll find a Nigerian gem in the burbs.

The meal was very good. Both meats were well cooked with great flavor and tender. The goat was especially tender. Yum. The rice had a little spice to it but very mild.

I have been waiting to try this place - finally a new cuisine in the area! And, if you are a vegetarian, this is your place. They have tons of vegetarian options - even if you aren&#39;t you should try them! There are also meat/fish options (the goat is amazing), if that&#39;s what you are craving.

The atmosphere is quiet and clean. Everyone that works here (or walks through the doors) is VERY friendly. We immediately felt comfortable. If you have questions about anything on the menu, they are very helpful and willing to walk you through the menu. Our waiter explained what was in our dishes, and even how it is made. Very cool!

We ordered the Moi Moi, Pounded Yam, and Fried Rice. Everything was packed full of flavor - nothing artificial here! The Moi Moi is soft, almost like a bread pudding, and easily split between other people. The Pounded Yam is hard to describe - it&#39;s a lot like mashed potatoes, but it has been steamed so it becomes more firm. It&#39;s like a potato pillow. Take that with some of the greens and your meat (with your hands of course), and you are good to go! It is a tad spicy, but not too bad. Everything is pretty cheap too (each meal is under $11).

It is super tender on the inside, falls apart as you bite it, the flavor profiles and layers are great as you bite into it, the outside has a nice crispness to it.  Such excellence in cookery!

The owner described our dishes to us, helped us choose, and it was perfect.  The food, swoon, the food, insanely fresh and hot, intentionally made to order, as if you&#39;re at their house being served.  Gizzards, not chewy, melt in your mouth and flavorful.  Fish, with bones that don&#39;t choke you, but dissolve.  Seriously, I know, it&#39;s Schaumburg, but an amazing restaurant that everyone should try.   So friendly, the decor is gorgeous, the service is outstanding.  The owner loves this place, and man, does it show, the quality, so blown away.

The owner is very friendly, and also doubles as the server.  Ask him about anything-- he is very knowledgable about West African food, the Chicago and suburb scene, and is very proud of his establishment. The music is ethnic and complements the atmosphere. 

Price: very reasonable, most dishes are $10. 

Food: 
Beverage. I got the Malta, which is a caramel honey malt drink. Very delicious!

Appetizer. We got the moi-moi (bean cake) and beef stick. The moi-moi was very good, but the beef stick was a m a z i n g.  

Entree. We got the jallof rice with goat and beef and the vegetarian bean porridge. They complemented each other very well and ingredients were fresh. The goat was tender and the beef well-seasoned. The plantains were delicious-- loading your fork up with the combination of beans, rice and plantains is the way to go.  Very comfort food-y. 

Great place overall! I&#39;d recommend it.",17/10/14,122,4,2,5,23,4.8192,4.144,0.0,13.856000000000002,No,968

Beans and rice were good too. I took my order to go and food was still hot and traveled well by the time i got to my hotel

I ordered the jumbo steak burrito, which is the reason of the -2 stars. I asked to have rice put inside also, which was fine. The burrito was lukewarm, which also isn&#39;t a deal breaker since there were plenty of &#34;cold&#34; ingredients inside. The biggest issue was the meat. It was like a shredded beef type of deal. I was expecting diced steak like carne asada style. It was extremely dry since it was shredded. I couldn&#39;t eat more than half of the burrito, which was a total let down. 

We also had a vegetarian burrito, chips and salsa, and horchata. I didn&#39;t try the vegetarian burrito, but you can&#39;t really mess the rest up either. Very sad that the size of the salsa is much smaller than I remember. I would&#39;ve ordered two if I had known.

On the bright side, a generous three stars for the best salsa I&#39;ve ever had and for the same friendly workers.

The service was decent. Not the best, but was fine.. My real issue was with the actual food.

I ordered Enchiladas Poblanas with chicken, my wife ordered steak tacos. I asked the waitress if the mole was homemade, she said yes, but her body language said, &#34;I&#39;m not really sure.&#34; I went against my better judgement and ordered anyway.


The food came out fast.. Too fast. When it arrived at the table there was an overwhelming aroma of beef broth.. The food smelled like someone mixed hot water with beef broth powder. I brushed it off until I actually tasted my food.. The mole came straight out of can or pouch.. There is no way it was homemade.. If it was.. That&#39;s just wrong. I took a bite of the rice and it too had a strange flavor profile and texture.. Like a granulated chicken or beef powder.. It was bizarre.

I took a bite of one my wife&#39;s steak tacos and it tasted like roast beef!!!! She agreed. What&#39;s up with that! Appalling.

My family and I have been going here for years. I recommend this place to everyone I know. It is a nice, good old fashioned family owned business, and that really makes a difference. The owner, Francisco, is a really great guy, he always greets me with a handshake and even a hug. The employees here always remember regulars and are very welcoming and polite to newcomers. 
Their food is the most delicious and fresh Mexican food I have ever had. It has an authentic taste, and all the ingredients are fresh. This place puts other Mexican restaurants to shame. Not to mention the prices are great, and eating here isn&#39;t going to break the bank, even when you bring the whole family. 
I am a vegetarian and sometimes it is hard to find good food locally that is meat free. They have an entire section of their menu for vegetarian and even vegan options. I recommend the Jumbo Veggie Burrito! Vegetarians and meat eaters alike will be satisfied here!
Their hours are great too, in high school this was a great hang out for my friends and I, as they are open late on weekends, and friendly to young kids. When you live in the suburbs it&#39;s sometimes hard to find somewhere to hang out for underage kids late at night.
This restaurant, while not the most glamourous in decor, is always clean and neat, and the wait to be served is never long.

That&#39;s how this whole journey started. We actually drove to three other places and ended up here out of sheer &#39;8:30pm on a Sunday night hunger desperation&#39;. 

The restaurant was well lit and filled with actual people eating food, so we walked in. 

The menu seemed huge!  Then we realized that they have devoted multiple pages of the laminated menu to photos of the food. This worked out well for us when my husband was asking me about the enchiladas and I was able to point at a picture in the menu. He ended up ordering said enchiladas with steak. I ordered a taco platter - chicken breast, ground beef and al pastor. We also had complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was fine. I didn&#39;t love it, but I am convinced it was me. I don&#39;t like a chunky salsa and this one was definitely chunky with fresh veggies. I prefer a more blended option. I still dipped my chips and just avoided the large pieces of veggies. It was nice and spicy. 

The hubby like his meal that came along with rice and refried beans. I wish I would have just stuck with the al pastor. I had a bite of the ground beef and wasn&#39;t excited by it at all. I ate the whole chicken taco. It was almost bland, but okay. The al pastor was well seasoned and juicy. The tortillas were fresh. The service was prompt. And the bill was reasonable. Finally, it&#39;s a hot spot for the local police officers. We definitely were in the right place for a quick, tasty meal. 

All in all, we&#39;ll head in again the next time we&#39;re in the area looking for some reasonable, authentic eats.",21/01/13,185,4,3,5,51,4.087200000000001,4.05,0.885,23.064999999999994,No,1613

The modest dining room has 18 tables that would be at home in a diner serving pancakes and eggs. But here, the food is surprising refined. The ubiquitous chips and salsa brought to the table were fresh, flavorful and crisp. I started with horchata (finally - with actual spices) which was delightful. 
I&#39;m a sucker for flautas so I ordered one chicken ($2.00). It was surprisingly large and was crisp, hot and flavorful. 
For my entree I ordered mixed steak and chicken fajitas. Apparently, the tortillas CAN come to the table piping hot as they did here. (Take note Chili&#39;s - you lied). 
The chicken steak and veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly in a lightly seasoned sauce. Rice, beans and cheese rounded out the ensemble.

I was pretty surprised at the size and weight of the torta when j got it. But was pretty disappointed after my first bite. 
1.) I guess a chicken torta at this place = chicken Milanesa torta (fried chicken piece)
2). Bread was dry and slightly stale tasting.
3.) Big chunks of onion, not a lot of cheese

My daughter likes their quesadillas and the guacamole, and the child&#39;s size is pretty decent. Enough to reheat the next day.

Found out about this place from my son&#39;s neighbor. The husband brings tacos home from work every Friday. Sounds good to me...always out to find good food.

We have had carry out from here about 5 times and have never had anything mediocre. Everything is full of flavor! My family loves to eat and we are not shy about trying anything. So far we have had tacos, mexican and american styles: chicken, beef, tongue and tripe. Our favorite taco is the tripe. I think they fry it after cooking it so it is tender inside and crispy outside, and not chewy....very delicious!

We have had the burritos too: they are filled to the max with everything you can think of and there is no additional charge for the toppings. Steak was juicy tasty and plenty. My husband could only eat half. My favorite was the chile relleno burrito. It was soooo good, I could not stop eating it. Licked my fingers when I was done. Would have licked the plate, but my husband stopped me.  The red and green sauces were both good, but realistically, the food was so flavorful you didn&#39;t need to use them...but of course, we did!

Tortas were excellent: big, flavorful, gooey sandwiches. Included all the toppings you wanted.  The al pastor torta is definitely, by far, our favorite.  Of course we could not skip having the tamales...perfect too.  Menudo...this is usually found in restaurants only on Saturday and Sundays...this place has it every day.  It was so good for dinner, but just as good the next day for breakfast...yummy!!!

Before I forget...the owner is a super guy. He makes a point of welcoming you and thanking you for coming. When I went to pick up my first order, he introduced me to the guy in line ahead of me...told me he has been coming by for the past 10 years...even knew his name. Now that is some owner...who takes the time to know his customers and treats everyone like family.

Food:
I love their gigantic food selection. I have enjoyed a variety of things over the years from their quesadilla to the tacos. You really can&#39;t go wrong with their Mexican selection. Though, I have never and probably will never try their American selection. My favorite however are their burritos! They are always full of flavor and packed with all the ingredients! The tomatoes and Avocado taste ripe and juicy. The meat is tender and flavorful! And the rice isn&#39;t bad at all with not too much sour cream. Every chew is a fusion of Mexican flavor that I thoroughly enjoy. The free chips quality always varies from stale to fresh, but their salsa is always good.

Pro tips:
Their Guacamole sucks, never get it. I think they put mayo in it :(

Never have a Jumbo Steak Burrito and Horchata together. It won&#39;t feel good coming out lol.

Service:
Service is always fast and friendly. Food usually comes out within 5 - 8 minutes even with groups of 5. I have also never have met such a nice owner! He always takes the time to stop doing what he is doing to shake my had and say hello. He even calls me &#34;Brother.&#34; I have never in my whole life felt valued as a customer. Even if I am gone for 6 months he still remembers me. If you start to come semi frequent, he will remember you!

Atmosphere:

Hole in the wall place. It got a lot bigger with the remodeling. Not much to look at, but the place is always clean with plenty of space. Place could use a little music, but it doesn&#39;t matter unless you go alone. Which I rarely do. The free wifi is also very fast.

It was 9:00 on a Monday night, and I was thisclose to pulling into Taco Bell as my default taco option, when I saw &#34;TAQUERIA&#34; lit up on a sign practically next door. Never wanting to lose an opportunity to try something new (without having the wife complain about the food) I walked in and grabbed three tacos.

I ordered an asada (steak), chicharron (pork skin) and chorizo con huevos (Spanish sausage with eggs). I also decided to have them with sour cream and cheese.

Excellent, all around. The red and green salsa is very flavorful but not terribly hot, and I&#39;m glad fresh limes were thrown in for free. All of the meat was cooked well, although I thought the chicharron would be crispy for some reason (it wasn&#39;t, which was fine). Abundant amounts of cilantro and grilled onion. And, the guy that was there shakes your hand as he hands you your meal.

The store also passes the &#34;do Hispanic people eat here?&#34; test with flying colors, as even at 9:15 there were quite a few Hispanic people in the restaurant.

Never seen such non stop group service, they were great.

Food: we had a LOT!

Japanese soup (onion and mushroom combined) I never thought I would enjoy either, but it was actually delicious. Next was a Japanese salad with ginger sauce. Very nice combination of flavors.

Main course: yakisoba was very very good. The steak and lobster was insane.

Everything cooked to absolute perfection.

Tempura shrimp and vegetables was delicious, saut̩ed zucchini was yum!

We came here around 2pm on a Saturday and the place was not busy at all. We called ahead to make sure we could be seated right away but still needed to wait once we got there. 

Once seated, not much was told to us. We actually needed to ask our waitress whether or not it was still time for the lunch special because she did not inform us on anything. Our chef came out and put on the typical show but I was not thrilled because I had just graduated college and felt like I was being treated like a child. Even my father asked what exactly the &#34;ice cream&#34; he kept putting on each dish was and he replied as &#34;its just butter, but we do ice cream for the children.&#34;

We had a large group (with a reservation). They were not ready for us yet, so we went to the bar. There really wasn&#39;t enough room for all of us to stand/sit, and we kept getting in the way of the servers. Finally we were seated at our table.

The service overall sucked. I usually don&#39;t say that, but we all were really disappointed with the service. Our waiter took a while to come to the table. He took drink orders, and then took forever to come back. Then we waited for the food to come. Finally that started and came out at a steady pace. Then we had a different server come to the table (where did the other guy go?). He refilled some drinks and then never came back. Old server comes back way later. Where have you been?? People were waiting on drinks (especially the birthday boy), plates were hardly cleared (and we didn&#39;t have much room to begin with), just a lot of waiting. They were nice about splitting checks, I&#39;ll say that.

The food was mediocre, as I remembered. I&#39;m not a fan of their miso soup or the ginger dressing on their salad. The teriyaki chicken hibachi was ok...didn&#39;t really taste like teriyaki to me. the veggies and shrimp appetizer were probably the best part. As I recall, other places automatically give you the fried rice with the hibachi. Not here. Ugh. The chef was very nice and entertaining though. I have nothing bad to say about him.

They sang happy birthday half heartedly and brought out ice cream for the birthday boy. We did get a nice group photo on the house. But overall I can think of other hibachi places that I have had better service and food.",06/07/15,211,2,3,2,57,1.2258999999999998,2.333,3.126,25.541,No,1801

We called and made our reservation for a Monday night at 8:00 pm. I asked if gratuity was included or if we add it ourselves on top of the bill and was told it was not included.  The reason I asked is that I know it is now illegal to add gratuity to the check in Illinois without informing the paying customer, so I wanted to make sure. It was my wife&#39;s birthday and we invited her mom, dad, etc. 7 of us in all. Unfortunately we were very disappointed in the overall experience. The food was really good. Fresh and flavorful, but for the price portions were pretty small. The chef was extremely nice and friendly, attentive and fun. He actually saved the night. The waitress on the other hand, Noi, was terrible. She did not even try to look somewhat friendly, no smile, no politeness and made us feel extremely rushed. She did ask if it was our first time there and it turned out that not even 1 of the 7 people had been to Benihanans. So even knowing that she did not help guide us through the menu and show anybody or tell us where the drinks were listed. She just stood there and skipped over whoever didnt know where the drinks were and asked the next person. Finally someone asked what soda they had and she said Pepsi products. We asked if they had Mt Dew and she just said no. Instead of telling us what they did have or pointing out the drink page. We ordered 2 appetizers and she also stood there to take the entire order. We all hurried up and ordered our meals on the spot because we felt bad and thought maybe she was really busy. When the appetizer(s) came (Sushi Sampler, no other appetizer) she brought my meal (Sushi &amp; Sashimi). Since we all thought  they were both appetizers, again everyone&#39;s first time here, I had no food to eat when everyone else&#39;s  food was ready. No refills offered though. She did do a great job clearing the table throughout our meals. At the end when they sang happy birthday it was only two people who sang, when the entire night and one table after us, there were about five employee&#39;s singing. Plus the gratuity was included at 20% with no mention of them adding it to the bill. We almost tipped double and it was not very well deserved.

I have been a regular weekly Express Lunch customer at the Benihana in Schaumburg, Illinois.
The Express Lunch was just changed to where 
1. my meal was no longer cooked on the teppanyaki grill in front of me,
2. there can be no substitutions on my meal order, 
3. and also an increase in price at the same time.
The result of these changes significantly reduces the Benihana experience and reduces the quality of service.
Based on these changes to the Express Lunch, I am reconsidering Benihana as my weekly lunch time destination.

benihana-schaumburg-2,Sean C.,rDT74LoBAYkhIkrbNq7tZg,rGSWx5x6SdoDkxnktvwesw,"Pretty disappointed in this place. Have been to plenty of Japanese steakhouses before, but to this large chain. The expectation has always been that it&#39;s too overpriced and too commercial to provide the diner with a great meal and great experience.  Came for a very early dinner with my wife and two kids. Place was pretty empty but that is expected at 5:30. Salad and Soup were fine, both tasted fresh. The chef guy doing the cooking was friendly and very engaging with both of my kids, so that was a positive- they both had fun and enjoyed the experience... But now to the food, which was severely lackluster overall. I had the filet and shrimp combo which is $40 (plus the actually charge $4 extra if you want fried rice with tiny bits of chicken in it) I&#39;ve never been to a place that charges for fried rice, and if you don&#39;t want it, then you get plain white rice. Cmon! Dump the tiny bits of chicken and just include plain fried rice in the already highly priced bill you&#39;ll be getting. Anyway- the shrimp were just terrible. I watched the guy literally overcook to the point of rubber. They had no seasoning on them, and just tasted like rubber. Most places go crazy with the butter on them when they cook, but I got MAYBE a half a teaspoon. The steak was ok, but also super bland. No seasoning, just plain meat. My wife and kids all got chicken and there&#39;s was also super bland. No seasoning and no butter to juice it up. It was also overcooked too. Dry and tasteless. I&#39;m left with a small portion of tasteless meat and 2 orders of rubber shrimp, and my companions end up with dry boring chicken. Everything overcooked and overrated.  I&#39;m not sure the hype on this place. Service was good, chef was interactive and nice, but when you get a $200 bill for overcooked, under seasoned, and boring food... You leave shaking your head and never come back. No thanks on a return trip, that&#39;s for sure.",29/06/16,218,2,2,2,18,1.2155999999999993,2.8000000000000003,2.697,18.501999999999995,No,1935

A. Listen to The Smiths&#39; Big Mouth Strikes Again 
B. Eat somewhere with hibachi grills and onion volcanoes capable of singeing my eyebrows off

In full disclosure, I didn&#39;t do the traditional Benihana hibachi thing here and I was alone... so even though alone is my favorite way to eat out and do most things, sitting at a hibachi table alone during an off-peak hour and waiting for more people to be seated at your sad table is not. Plus, happy hour at the sushi bar... which is a total 5-star experience. 

I&#39;m going to start with my server, whose name was &#39;Apple.&#39; She was awesome, super funny, and only a little judge-y about how much I ate but it was okay because I channeled Liz Lemon and took it as both a challenge and a compliment and at the end she even patted my back in a &#39;Way to go, Champ! Really happy you didn&#39;t choke on all that food you shoved in your face&#39; kind of way in reference to how much happy hour sushi I&#39;d just demolished. 

I&#39;ve been kind of sick for pretty much the past 4 weeks and because I&#39;m intent on infecting everyone Outbreak+Contagion style (just kidding, I&#39;m not contagious... just gross feeling/looking), I sat belly up to the sushi bar and ordered some hot tea for my throat... I think I drank 3 mini pots during the course of my happy hour stay and Apple was quick to refill me every time even though I&#39;m sure I was probably the thirstiest, most annoying customer she&#39;d have all day. 

When I first got the menu, I had the option of &#34;All You Can Eat Sushi&#34; order as I go off the happy hour menu, but the AYCE sushi isn&#39;t exactly that. You can order up to 3 rolls or 10 different nigiri for a flat rate (and of course anything you don&#39;t finish you pay full price for - standard). I opted not to do this even though the &#34;AYCE&#34; menu had some more interesting rolls on it out of principle since something with a limit of rolls is clearly not All You Can Eat. Not that I need to eat more than 3 rolls on my own, I just don&#39;t like being limited, so the Happy Hour menu is what I chose. 

Their happy hour runs Monday through Thursday from 5-8pm in the sushi bar only. There&#39;s a pretty decent sized menu with a number of rolls, hand rolls, nigiri, small plates, and apps like gyoza, edamame, etc. Most items are between $1.50 (nigiri) to $5.25 (full Rainbow Roll) and a total steal. 

I got:
* Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Jalapeno
* A second order of Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Jalapeno because the first was so good
* Spicy Tuna
* Crispy Spicy Tuna
* Tuna Sashimi w/ Spicy Sauce
* 3 mini pots of Green Tea

My bill came to just over $20 and I had to undo my belt as I sat at the bar. American success! Because the happy hour prices are pretty discounted and because Apple deserved it I made sure to leave a $10 tip so she wouldn&#39;t remember me only as the fatty that ate all their tuna because I know I&#39;ll be headed back here for happy hour on the regular.",15/09/13,353,4,1,5,9,7.2287,3.3149999999999995,0.466,12.219,No,3055

No happy birthday song was sung by staff as it had been at a couple other tables while we were there.

I had a $30 &#34;chefs table discount&#34; for b-day, no chance was provided for me to use it...!

We were asked if we wanted to buy desert but it should have been included in our premium dishes. When they figured that out they came back and said you &#34;get one of these few flavors of ice cream&#34;... Thirty to forty dollars each and we &#34;get&#34; a scoop of ice cream, no thanks!

Finally the confused desert waiter asked if we wanted our photo taken for birthday memory (only acknowledgement of the celebration)

So frustrated we went elsewhere for dessert, paid full price ($187 for four people) and left unceremoniously feeling taken for granted and advantage of.

I usually get terryaki chicken but I love salmon too. I never see a combination of both meals on it on Benihanas or Kobe&#39;s menu so I usually have to ask if I can have both. Kobe always have adjusted to it but the waitress here at Benihana told me it wasn&#39;t on the menu so no. So I said fine and just go with the chicken. The chef was funny and nice. However both the soup and the rice was &#34;bland&#34; tasting. I literally took the guys soy sauce and used it on my rice. I don&#39;t eat the veggies, I usually give them to my husband, but my plate seemed so unfull of food for paying $25. And my husband said he was disappointed in the salad, that the dressing is usually sweet but it was really bitter this time. He eats his and my salad both but he didn&#39;t even finish his own this time..so I know it wasn&#39;t good. Our meal cost $83 total and if we would have went to Kobe it usually costs us less than $70..and we get sushi there and they throw in noodles with their meal.",25/04/16,108,2,1,1,-13,0.03759999999999991,1.3179999999999998,0.521,11.161,No,1022

But even more disappointing than the food was the price. I was prepared to pay $25-$30 per meal. However I was not prepared to pay an extra $5 for substituting the steamed rice for fried rice.

Here comes my order sushi order, I&#39;m trying not to drool as the waitress puts it down. Mental note to self: do not devour, you want to savor the moment. They&#39;ve added new rolls to their happy hour menu since I&#39;ve last been so I decided to try the Gotham roll and I&#39;m so glad I did, it&#39;s so tasty and delicious, it was gone within seconds, as fast as the speed of light!

However, my all time favorite from Benihana has to be their shrimp crunchy roll! Anything fried and has tempura crumbs on it is good right? Of course it&#39;s good! It&#39;s beyond good, it&#39;s orgasmic freaking good! So yes you need to try it!

I first ordered Miso Soup, it came as expected tasting no different than anywhere else. Next up, Sumo roll. A very American roll, fried ingredients and smothered in mayo. I&#39;d say it was &#34;good&#34;. Lastly my usual favorite, the Philadelphia Roll. 

They brought it out much quicker than expected, leaving me to ponder on if it was pre-made or not. My first piece was disappointing, and while not substantial, it only declined from there. I&#39;d compare it to a typical grocery store sushi roll (I&#39;ve eaten an unfortunately large amount of that stuff). The sesame seeds and veggies over powered the other flavors, hiding the bland cream cheese and the tasteless salmon. Something in this scenario was pre-made or left to sit out, it was not a fresh roll like I&#39;d prefer. 

Overall, three stars are given for good service, nice atmosphere, and friendly people. Two stars are lost due to  sub-par ingredients resulting in forgettable sushi. I don&#39;t regret my experience but most likely won&#39;t return.

It&#39;s been about 10 months since our last visit and if you read my previous review, you will understand what took so long for our return. 

We decided to go to celebrate a birthday. They ask you when you are first seated if you are there for a special occasion, as it appears many people do, due to the number of times you hear them sing throughout the evening. We informed them that we were, in fact, there for a birthday celebration. Typically, you get an ice cream and they will take your photo, etc. Just a little something to make it special for the birthday boy or girl. None of this happened. Luckily, the birthday girl didn&#39;t mind. 

Let me remind you of something I find to be very important....you can not really be in a hurry when you come here. Be prepared for a slow start to your meal unless your group fills a table. They will sometimes wait to start prepping until you have more than 3 or 4 people at a table. 

All meals begin with the soup and salad. The salad with the ginger dressing is my favorite thing on this planet! I think I need to go to a store and look for this stuff! The soup has tofu and mushrooms. I finally wised up and ordered it without mushrooms and this was no big deal to them, so I was more than pleased! We did the dinner for two and it was more than enough food. We ordered a fried rice to share. Always, one of my favorites. They prepare most of their food before your eyes, so it&#39;s always a fun show. Again, this &#34;show&#34; is what takes up time, too. 

Our glasses were kept full, our food was prepared perfectly and all special requests were fulfilled, my sister&#39;s rice with no egg, for example. The only thing that kinda bothers me is that the veggies (onion and zucchini) are served long before you have any protein to enjoy with them, and being kind gross to me to just eat grilled onions, the veggies are usually cold by the time I get some shrimp or protein to marry with them.

Everyone&#39;s food always looks delicious and watching how things are prepared, almost makes me want to try something different. This is the fun part about sitting with other people you do not necessarily know.

The menu layout was a little confusing, but we were able to find what we wanted to order, so it all worked out. 

I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back before we know it.",06/12/11,249,4,2,5,26,7.9252,4.0040000000000004,0.28400000000000003,23.712000000000007,No,2401

It&#39;s $20-$30 per entree, but if you sign up for their e-mail list they give you a $30 gift certificate on your birthday = free meal. SCORE. Not only that, they bring you ice cream, sing happy birthday (in both english ..and &#39;japanese&#39;) AND take a picture of you and whoever you&#39;re with and &#39;frame&#39; it.

As far as food goes, their onion soup was DELICIOUS. The two sauces they give you were really good too. Everything else was just..alright. Nothing worth remembering. The onion soup is a definite winner. ...and I suggest getting their sake sangria. $8 a glass, but sooo yummy.

Benihana has a new menu.  I think that it&#39;s basically the same options, but the layout was a bit weird.  They are calling the appetizers &#34;side dishes&#34; and the drinks are spread out throughout the menu.  

Most recently, I had a combo with teriyaki steak and jumbo shrimp.  I paid $3.25 extra for chicken fried rice, which is well worth it instead of white rice.

It took a really long time for each course

It seems like for me, you are paying for the atmosphere and the entertainment rather than the actual quality of the food.  My lemon chicken was really pricey, and it was extremely dry and not flavorful at all.  IT didn&#39;t taste anything like lemon.

On my last visit with my parents and my husband, the grill was kind of dirty and the chef (who was kind of unfriendly) never really cleaned it.  BLECH. He did a fair number of tricks, though, including the requisite onion volcano. My hibachi shrimp which were totally bland despite being cooked in the usual heart-stopping blend of soy sauce and butter, AND I asked for my fried rice without chicken and they said &#34;No problem!&#34; and then proceeded to make me fried rice WITH chicken. I did get a huuuge portion of shrimp, though. The onion soup was delicious as usual and my husband had a pretty decent sake/sangria cocktail.

All the local seafood spots were at least a 40 minute wait, so we took our chances at Benihana.   It&#39;d been a while since our last visit (at least 2 years ago), and the experience is still good.

If you haven&#39;t been to Benihana before, it&#39;s teppanyaki/hibachi, where food is cooked right in front of you.  Our fam of 4 was seated immediately, directly across the grill and chef.  There were two couples to either side of us at the table.  We&#39;ve been here before where we either took up a whole table, or requested to be seated alone, which they&#39;ve accommodated (if not on a busy night).  We had a good time with the other couples, the kids behaved and conversations weren&#39;t mixed or intrusive.

Menu doesn&#39;t change much at Benihana -  they have a good selection/variety of choices for the grill along with a good sushi/sashimi menu.  We are always pleased with the quality and taste of the food at Benihana, and this night was no exception. We went with all seafood (Surf Side and the Hibachi Shrimp).  Most menu items come with soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice (choice of brown/white/fried), along with the entr̩e.  Good variety of sake and Japanese beer (Sapporo, of course).  Kids meals come with a lot of food...choice of entr̩e, rice, drink, and ice cream.  The kids menus are printed on chefs hats (big hit).

Our chef did the usual tricks: onion volcano, escaping shrimp, catching egg in pocket, catching shrimp tails in hat, behind-the-back rice bowl fill, showmanship with utensils, etc.  The kids loved it.  It was entertaining, and while we&#39;ve never experienced a terrible or boring showing from the chef, depending on who you get, the cooking show will either be hilarious/lively/fun, or lackluster/mediocre.  Ours tonight did good, and while he put a little &#39;oomph&#39; in there for the kids, it was still a little more on the &#39;routine&#39; side - going through the motions, more than it was with the pizzazz that we&#39;ve seen here before.  Regardless, still a good showing and food was cooked well.

Benihana can be pricey, though they offer lots of specials...good for families, for couples, groups of friends, etc.  They&#39;ve been around forever, especially this Schaumburg location.  Not hard to see why.  Always a good time here.

Also - if you&#39;re celebrating a special occasion, let them know and they&#39;ll take your photo and send you home with a souvenir Benihana frame.

So please don&#39;t think i complain often. Last Saturday 4 of us made reservations at Benihana Schaumburg. I have been so far at a Wheeling location a few times and had a great experience. The place was packed but it was to be expected. 

We were sited and our server was great until she brought us our drinks and disappeared. Since then we had like 4 different people that would serve our table. Which i find confusing and uncomfortable not knowing who to tip at the end. All those servers came to pick up our plates but NOT ONE SINGLE ONE OF THEM ASKED IF WE WANT TO REFILL OUR DRINKS. Well that was a definitely new experience! It got to the point that 20 MINUTES LATER WITH NO RESPONSE FROM ANYONE, and believe me we tried to call a waiter few times. I literally got up from my chair and wanted to walk by the kitchen to ask if i can get a glass of water because nobody wants to refill our drinks. It got the attention of chef that was cooking at our table and you could tell it was not ok. 

Lastly the waitress that end up refilling our drinks look rather unhappy. She asked us about dessert however skipped on one friend who&#39;s meal did not include it. I think its a shame because she wanted to order one and they would make extra money . Isn&#39;t that whats service industry is about in a first place? Selling more ???? The check was rushed in without asking if we would anything else. AGAIN BIG MINUS FOR SELLING MORE SERVICES (YES WE WANTED ORDER SOME SUSHI ROLLS TO GO). At the end my friend payed and tried to be good about it saying thank you to our waitress. SHE DID NOT SAY THANK YOU BACK!!! Talk about rude!

In conclusion I don&#39;t have great expectations from cheap or chain restaurants but when you spend $50 per plate, you at least expect decent service.

I will not be coming back to that location and will tell friends not to go there EVER! Please visit instead the Wheeling location (100 times better!!)",28/01/13,220,2,1,2,-18,1.9361000000000004,2.77,1.827,20.402999999999995,No,1990

We came here for a friends birthday.  I had never been, but she loves it (and they provided birthday ice cream and took a picture and printed it while we were there).  However,  it got off to a bumpy start.  We were there early and they pointed us to the bar to go sit (ironically, she pointed in the wrong direction).  15 minutes after our reservation time, we noticed another party who arrived after us get seated.  I went to resolve this issue and they clearly screwed up.  The hostess was rather irritating in failing to acknowledge their screw up.  Within 5 minutes we were seated. 

The concept is neat - they cook in front of you. I have never been to a place like this so my the chef had my attention.  However, like a few other reviews, it was FREEZING (and the bathrooms more so).  Even once they started cooking, I had my wool coat on.  The vestibule between the outdoor door and the indoor door was, in fact, warmer than the restaurant.   

Between those two snafus, I gets .5 knocked off.  As for their food, I liked it.  They definitely give you a TON of it.  The shrimp appetizer was a wonderful start, and the onion soup was delightful.  I thought the veggies were a bit overcooked - but I hate zucchini being too soft. Fried rice delicious.  I do wish that they cooked it so you had some of the sides with your main meal.  I had the steak and scallops - both done to order and very tasty but not overwhelmingly buttery.

I ordered there spicy seafood pasta special. It was linguini with muscles, clams, shrimp and fish. It was a generous portion but unfortunately one of the muscles must have been on its way and really ruined the whole dish giving it an off flavor. This happens from time to time with seafood and I really can&#39;t blame the restaurant. That was the only downside to my experience. Well that and the fact that it was a tad pricey.

One of the most embarrassing dinners that I have ever had and we were celebrating my 50th birthday on top of it. I moved into the area about a year ago and had been wanting to try this place as it was close to home. We walked into the restaurant and overheard someone say that someone was the owner, so I made it a point to introduce myself to the guy and tell him how I was excited to eat at his restaurant. We sat down and ordered wine and food. After my friend drank his first glass of wine, he ordered a second. When they brought it out, it did not taste like the same wine as the first. Please keep in mind that this is someone that never complains in all the times we have gone out over 20 years of friendship. The restaurant did good though and replaced the glass with one from a newly opened bottle. So far, so good. Then we got our entrees. I have a daughter who is autistic and while she loves Fettuccine Alfredo, if she sees black spots from pepper or if the pan is not clean, then she makes a fuss. I have learned to just coach the waiter in any restaurant as we order so usually it is not a problem but when her dish arrived, sure enough, there was black stuff all around. I tried to get her to eat it but it was a problem so I grabbed the waiter and talked to him. He took the dish back to the kitchen and came back 5 minutes later with what was either the same dish, stirred or a different dish with more black spots in it. As soon as it was set down, he noticed it, apologized and took the dish back again. Then he came back and said that the kitchen was unable to prepare an alfredo sauce that didn&#39;t have black spots in it but that the manager offered to comp the dish. Keep in mind that the dish was removed from our table uneaten so it was not like they did us any favor. Was there really a question if they were going to charge us? Then, the waiter asked about desert and this is where it got funny. When we said that we were interested in seeing the desert tray, he came back to the table and said that the owner must be having a bad day and sometimes gets an attitude and that between the complaints of the wrong wine and the alfredo, that he was refusing to let us have desert. At first, we were confused, then offended and as we were about to get up, the waiter came back and said that there was a mistake, that his boss had a heavy accent and that we were welcome to order desert. I have to believe that there was no mistake made and that the guy just had second thoughts about his actions as he made no effort to come himself to the table and as we eventually did leave, actually left the dining room in what appeared to be an attempt to avoid us. I will never go again, even though I could walk to the place.",01/04/16,275,1,1,2,-36,1.9594,2.29,1.068,20.641,No,2769

Minestrone Soup: Not bad,  tasted fine. (Came free with meal)

Funghi Ripieni: 4 button mushroom caps stuffed with a mix of  sausage, bread crumbs and cheese and topped with a cream sauce. There&#39;s also a little salad on the plate with it. I would say this dish is a little salty for my tastes and at 10.00 is too pricey for 4 stuffed mushrooms...maybe if they were stuffed Portobello&#39;s it&#39;d be worth it. 

Linguine Vongole (Red Sauce): 6 big clams and lots and lots of little clams. This dish was TOO DAMN SALTY! The portion was huge but the red sauce was really really watery. I would say at 18.00 this dish is worth the price for what you get if you like tomato seawater as pasta sauce. 

I would say that the best part about this place is the service. The people are really friendly and fast about getting you your food. My waiter kept refilling my tea when it was low without me even asking. 

The worst part about this place is that they will literally charge you 6 dollars to split an entree. That to me is a ridiculous cost just to put 1 dish on 2 plates. 

Overall I would say this place is not that great if you&#39;re a food focused diner. If you consider the ambiance and service very important then you might want to give it a try. 2 Stars for food, +1 Star for Service and Atmosphere, -1 star for crappy pricing.

Since my family moved down the street from this restaurant (it&#39;s hard to miss since it is part of a strip mall), it has been three different things--Cafe Clemenza, Capri, and now DeBenedetto&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t care for CC, Capri was the shizz, but this measures up as well!!

BTW, as they state on their coupons, they are NOT affiliated with Clemenza&#39;s OR Capri.  They stand alone!  This is also written on the coupons they give out if you join their page on Facebook, HINT HINT.

My husband and I went for my birthday.  We weren&#39;t sure we needed reservations, so we decided to wing it.  As we were walking in that day, we saw a sign on the door that said that they were having $6 Limoncello Martinis.  Sign me up!!!

We were one of three tables in the restaurant, so we neednt have worried!!  We ordered our limoncello martinis while my husband got a Peroni, and we were on our way.  

The coupon was $15 off an order of $50 or more, so we also ordered the calamari in addition to our meals.  It was really hot, fresh, and the marinara that came with it was delicious!  

I got the ziti, which was amazing, but I forgot to order it without peas.  Peas and I detest each other.  But it was my oversight, so I tried to eat around them.  If you are a pea lover, then this dish is for you.  I could barely eat around them, really since the dish was RAMPANT with them!  But what I was able to eat around was really good.

My husband ordered the steak, and he didn&#39;t even need a knife to cut it--that&#39;s how tender it was.  SO delicious!

Each meal comes with a choice of soup or salad (I chose both! ;)).  Their minestrone was good, but their pasta fagioli was different than every other I&#39;ve come across.  I wouldn&#39;t say I would order it again, that&#39;s for sure.  The tried and true minestrone would be my pick next time (and there WILL be a next time!)

I have had Chicharr_n, Butifarra, and Lomo Saltado.  Those sandwiches are fresh, tasty, and delicious.  I did not think that I would like sweet potato or fries on my sandwich, but Peru loves potatoes.  I guess that I do too now.

The chicken fried rice is amazing.  I always try to stay on my diet and not get the fried rice or maybe eat a little of it.  That just never works.  It is too good.  I put a little extra hot sauce in it and my mouth starts to water.

I have had the fried plantains there too.  In the past, I have never liked fried plantains because they are usually soggy or greasy.  The owner/chef makes them crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  It shows just how great this place is - something as simple as a plantain done so well.

The owner/chef and his mother seem to do everything here.  They are very friendly and attentive.  You pay at the counter and there is seating.

For a very fair price, SanguChe serves up loads of fresh Peruvian eats and stuffed sandwiches that are sure to please the masses. While the place itself is straightforward - expect no frills here, clean tables, clean bathrooms, a soda machine, and a handful of tables - the food is complex and full of flavor. I went with the Aji de Gallina: shredded chicken in a creamy yellow aji pepper, peanut and basil sauce, served on a French Roll with slices of sweet potato and hard-boiled egg. Per SanguChe, it&#39;s mix of Spanish and Peruvian flavor. For me, I saw peanut sauce and sweet potato and said, sure, that sounds great. 

And it was. It wasn&#39;t a flavor combo I was used to, but it was a nice mix of salty sweet and tender chicken. My dining mate, Jacqueline B, ordered a size of fried rice (arroz chaufa) and it.was.enormous. For $3.50 a normal sized human could easily fill up on this generous portion.

sanguche-naperville,Jacqueline B.,zKY6NM9CxxWxcY5JJXUB7g,AU1X7f0IKnPIbO_SLtTc8g,"As a newbie to Peruvian food, I was super intrigued by SanguChe and am now officially a fan!

I&#39;ve had SanguChe bookmarked since the day they opened and finally just came here for lunch with Nicole W last week. They&#39;re located in my no-so-favorite Naperville area due to the construction and traffic that is always happening at North Aurora &amp; Route 59. With that being said, I have no problem heading this way for fantastic food from places like SanguChe and their nearby neighbors Fire It Up.

SanguChe is a small, casual little shop with probably like 5 or 6 tables. At 11:30 am on a Friday they were mildly busy. I think there was one other group dining in, but plenty of folks popped in to grab lunch to go.

As I perused their menu which is written up on a chalkboard, the Chicharr_n sandwich caught my eye. This beauty on a bun is made up of their traditional Chicharron (which is pork butt that is braised then fired in its own juices) served on ciabatta roll with slices of sweet potato, salsa criolla relish &amp; drizzled with fresh parsley mayo. 

I think those toppings pretty much speak for themselves, but in case you need more direction, it&#39;s basically AMAZING. Such a unique flavor and a way more exciting lunch option then the usual boring old sammie. Their menu describes the Chicharron sandwich as their influence of African culture from the South of Lima.

To accompany my sandwich I ordered a &#34;side&#34; of fried rice (arroz chaufa). It&#39;s appropriate that I put the word side in quotes because IMO this is nowhere near a side - and I&#39;m not complaining! Their order of fried rice is huge! It honestly could be a meal in itself (and for only $3.50!). This rice is just as delicious as it is plentiful, let me tell you.

Definitely plan to eat my way through the rest of their menu. Great lunch spot.",13/11/15,204,5,2,5,17,5.699400000000001,3.181,0.328,14.490000000000002,No,1847

I am so glad that I did! When you walk in, there are 5-6 tables, there is Peruvian music playing, and the environment is cozy. We asked the chef (who turned out to be the owner, more on him later) what he would recommend and he said &#34;try the chicharron.&#34; We ordered that and the adobo de cerda. In addition, we ordered a side of empanadas and fried yucca. An older lady (the chefs mom) brought our food to us. She started with the empanadas. The empanadas was filled with meat, raisins, and a relish. Weird combo, but it worked and tasted amazing. Then they brought out our sandwiches. These were the best sandwiches we have had in long time. The bread was perfectly toasted and the flavor of the sandwiches were nothing I have experienced before. Finally, the fried yucca was the weirdest choice on the menu. Turns out, yucca is a thicker version of a potato (a potato on steroids). It came with a mustard sauce on the side and this out any French fry to shame. Towards the end of our meal, the chef/owner came out and ask us how our meal was.

The people were very nice, they gave me a free appetizer, fries yucca with mozzarella melted inside yum. 
The place is very clean &amp; bright, &amp; they have the Wall Street journal on the tables for your reading pleasure.

Overall it was a very nice experience.

I have zero. He has a ton of TV shows. I have zero. He&#39;s got a red classic car and other ones, too. I have zero.  

But in addition to having better hair than Guy, I have access to SanuChe. He does not. At least not yet. But he may. If I were him, I stop in as part of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and give this place a test drive. 

SanguChe is family run and very welcoming. Peruvian artwork adorns the walls along with photographs of people enjoying Peru. There is also some Peruvian jewelry for sale. It all works very well to take what would be an ordinary, strip mall vibe and add some life and energy to it.

The menu is clear in its explanations of the dishes. I went, however, with something off of the menu after conversing with the owner. He recommended a filling of meat, olives, onions and other seasonings and things wrapped in a potato and then deep fried. It was served with pickled onions and a hot sauce and it was awesome. The olives complemented the meat filling and the pickled onions and hot sauce made the dish a smash. Even without the hot sauce, the dish was terrific. I don&#39;t know the name of it, but if you ask him for it, he will definitely know what you want. 

I also went with some fried Yucca. The Yucca was stuffed with some mozzarella and served with another sauce, also delish. For me, the appetizer was waaaayyyy too much food for lunch but it was mighty tasty. 

My only complaint is that they don&#39;t serve unsweetened iced tea. I don&#39;t really go for pop or lemonade so that was a bit of a bummer. But they do offer water and that works just fine.

I&#39;ve never experienced Peruvian food, but I&#39;m willing to try anything at least once. So I looked over their menu and was immediately drawn to the Lomo Saltado. Containing strips of sirloin that have been sauteed in vinegar, garlic, and soy sauce, this sandwich is constructed beautifully with flavorful meat nestled on a soft french roll and garnished with red pepper, onion, and tomatoes. Topping it off are french fries and a delectable spicy aji panca. I was sold.

The decor at SanguChe is simple yet clean and inviting. There is a fountain drink machine but you can also order  Peruvian colas. There are five tables adorned with small, minimalistic centerpieces. It&#39;s a very casual, low-key establishment, but don&#39;t let that deter you from experiencing the fabulous food. The menu is small (seven types of sandwiches, including a quinoa burger option) but in a world where menus are diverse and overwhelming, I appreciate the simplistic approach at SanguChe. Still not convinced? You can build your own sandwich as well.

The gentleman who took my order (I believe it was Cesar) was extremely nice. He offered me a taste of the hot sauce that came with my sandwich and wow! That sauce is a creeper! At first you taste flavors and no heat but then spiciness kicks in. That&#39;s my kind of sauce, bring on the heat!

So the sandwich itself is nothing short of uh-may-zing!  The meat, the soft bread, the spicy sauce, the red peppers, everything was so fresh tasting! I was sad when my food was over. 
I opted for no side with my sandwich,but I certainly would like to try the rice. I also plan to try the Adobo de Cerdo sandwich on a future visit. The food and great service exceeded my expectations.

Being a foodie, the concept of a Peruvian Sandwich Shop is something so unique that I had to try it out for myself.  The place is small and comfortable and tucked away in a strip mall.  You wouldn&#39;t even know it was there if you didn&#39;t hear about it from somewhere else.  That being said I&#39;ve tried three of the sandwiches here and each one I had was amazing in it&#39;s own right. 

The other thing is who can argue with the price point? They also have something for everyone here as they have a pretty good vegetarian quinoa burger to offer.

We had one of each of the sandwiches, fried yucca, and the fried rice. All were very good!! The photos show the Steak &amp; Chicken on Ciabatta but the normally come on a french roll, both are good.

The fried yucca is like a big potato in terms of what it eats like. They give you a great dipping sauce to go with it. The fries are &#34;FreshCut&#34; or handcut as they say. One thing I&#39;d love to see is a selection of hot sauces to put on the sandwiches when you dine in. At home we did Sriracha &amp; Tapatio which were both great to spice it up a bit!!

sanguche-naperville,Rose D.,FqHNMGc_-BgX4svll0SwLg,laflA6vlF4Lj6btx1AacWQ,"Thank you, Yelp, for directing us to this gem of a place when we had a hankering for sandwiches because we wouldn&#39;t have stumbled across them otherwise!  The sandwiches here are delicious!  I wish we lived closer to enjoy them more often.  The owner/chef is incredibly nice and very helpful if you have questions about the menu. You can tell the meats for their sandwiches are slow roasted or braised for a long period of time as they are all very tender &amp; oh-so-flavorful with just the right amount spices/seasoning.  The last time we visited the Hubs &amp; I split a sandwich and an order of the Peru Poutine - more than enough food for the two of us.  

I recommend getting the hot sauce for the sandwiches on the side if you haven&#39;t had it before and they typically will ask you this just to be sure.  It&#39;s a unique hot sauce and I have no idea what is in it but it&#39;s very flavorful &amp; packs quite a punch - a little goes a long way.

In my opinion the only thing holding this place back is their location but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s because they are a new place &amp; need to keep their rent low.

I was definitely impressed and will definitely be back.

The meat in both sandwiches was hot and had good texture, not dried out or greasy. The vegetables were all fresh and the bread was good. 
I  have absolutely no idea what the saices were but they were both delicious and mild.... nothing spicy but very flavorful.  
 
The fried yucca was like the best, super crispy steak fries you&#39;ve ever seen,  but they are more dense than potatoes. ... do yourself a favor and enjoy them BEFORE you google nutrition information on yucca. 

The proprietors seemed really nice and the place was clean. I&#39;d definitely recommend it.   The only reason I can&#39;t go with 5 stars on the review is that A- I&#39;ve only been there once, and B- it was a little expensive.

sanguche-naperville,Jazz V.,4xO91E9FiSNItUeMLNfs3g,RdER0mAhiwAdtTVvbXvpag,"I love and very much appreciate this place and hope that it stays around for a while.  I say this with caution because this type of venture seemed risky (in this casual reviewer&#39;s opinion).  First off, there are no Peruvian restaurants west of the city.  The location is in an obscure strip mall off of Route 59 and away from the bustling Fox Valley area.  And, if someone is looking for a more traditional Peruvian experience, this is not the place to go because its a sandwich shop.  That being said, I certainly did not leave disappointed.  I&#39;ve tried several Peruvian eateries (from high end restaurants to casual bistros) and have been to Peru, so I&#39;m familiar with the cuisine and culture.  While not &#34;traditional&#34;, the brightness of the food, the Peruvian-themed photos of the walls, and the pop/rock music in Spanish made me reminisce about my short time in Lima.

But enough of the nostalgia, let me talk about the food:  SO GOOD!  I got the quinoa burger and fried yucca.  Friend got the chicharron (braised pork) sandwich and Peru poutine with aji de gallina (shredded chicken in cream sauce).  I didn&#39;t know what to expect with the quinoa burger, and was surprised to find that the patty had more of a seitan-like texture.  The sandwich also had a slightly sweet taste to it which gave it a fresh and bright taste.  The chicharron sandwich was also really good.  The chef (who btw was wearing this festive Pisco Sour apron) offered a sample of the chicharron before ordering.  This chicharron is not fried pork skin (which is what I thought chicharron was) but thick slices of deliciously braised pork.  Both sandwiches were very flavorful and also very filling.  Both my friend and I are healthy eaters, and we were both stuffed and satisfied.  

Their regular fries are good (they are the type that have peel on them like Hot Doug&#39;s), but to really kick the meal up I recommend the fried yucca.  Usually I find fried yucca to be bland, but these were nicely fried and seasoned.  It was served with a creamy sauce that tastes similar to the aji de gallina sauce.  Peruvian food, in general, is not as spicy or tangy las other Latin American foods.  The Peru Poutine is a fun take on &#34;fries topped with stuff&#34;.  We got ours with aji de gallina, and it was topped with sliced hard boiled eggs and green onions.  This was a meal in itself, and we had to take half of it home.  

The price is a bit on the pricey end ($7-9 per sandwich, $11 for poutine) but honestly these prices are on par with the frou frou, hipster-friendly places in the city.  And I think the price warrants the uniqueness and quality of the food.  Also, South American enthusiasts may be a bit disappointed to find that the Inka Kola they carry is the American version, and not the bottled cane sugar version we&#39;ve all come to know and love.  But listen--Peruvians are notorious for bragging that they have the best food in the world.  The chef, as evidenced in the restaurant and on their website, is proud of the food he has created for this shop.  And in this casual blogger&#39;s opinion, they have every right to be.  Its simple but flavorful, modern but authentic, unique but familiar.  Sanguche is a great addition to the culturally-limited options of the western suburbs.",18/09/15,373,5,1,5,-19,10.646,5.090000000000002,0.672,27.23700000000001,No,3301

I didn&#39;t know what to get, so I asked for suggestions. The man suggested ceviche. My husband said he wanted it, and I said I didn&#39;t like seafood and asked again. He recommended something... I don&#39;t remember the name, but it was a fried potato ball stuffed with hard boiled egg and ground beef.

We weren&#39;t impressed. My husband didn&#39;t like the ceviche. It was serve with beans and a boiled sweet potato, and my husband said it needed something to mellow it out. And said it wasn&#39;t fresh. He didn&#39;t finish it, which is shocking for him. I got the potato ball, and it was cold in the center, which was really disappointing. It was tiny. I would have needed three to make a meal. I ended up giving it to my toddler, and it was perfect for him! Great size and perfectly cold.

sanguche-naperville,Shreyas V.,Id7EHrRsouz5pOMmSMTlHQ,TL9M9I-WLc97ANYbLjma6Q,"SanguChe is a little hard to find - it&#39;s situated in a strip mall that you can see on North Aurora and you access from Fairway. Takes a second to figure it out.

Besides that, I don&#39;t have any criticism. This is one of the absolute best restaurants I&#39;ve been to in Aurora/Naperville. I&#39;ve never had Peruvian (or Peruvian-inspired) food before, and after trying the wonderful food at SanguChe, I really regret that decision. While many of the dishes here do contain meat, they are wonderful about dietary restrictions which makes this place a great vegetarian/vegan spot.

I got the Quinoa Burger and the fried rice. Both were absolutely delicious and well portioned. I typically hate veggie burgers that go the &#34;sweet&#34; route rather than the &#34;savory&#34; or &#34;spicy&#34; routes, but I was really loving the sweetness of whatever topped the burger. I think the only thing that could have made the burger better was if the party itself was a bit spicier to give a bit of contrast to the sweeter topping. But really, I can&#39;t complain. The fried rice was totally solid - a delicious accompaniment to an already delicious meal. Typically, they make it with chicken, but they were very happy to accommodate a meatless request.

It&#39;s a small-ish place in a strip mall.  Decor is very basic with 5 tables, various Peruvian pictures on the walls along with what appears to be somebody&#39;s old wooden fence along the one wall.  The menu is on a big chalkboard above the counter/window where you order.  They have about 8 sandwiches to choose from (or make your own) along with a few sides.  
The place is very clean &amp; service was very nice/friendly, albeit  a little hard to understand at times. 

After perusing the brief menu &amp; wanting to not risk getting anything spicy out of concern for my co-workers &amp; the ozone, I ordered the chicken milanese samich and split the Peruvian Poutine with pork with my friends.  The sandwich, share of the poutine &amp; pop came to about $16.  Li&#39;l  sticker shock at that initial cost in my opinion.   They have Pepsi fountain pops &amp; only 1 size, 12 ounce cup.  We were told to take a seat &amp; they&#39;d bring the food out. 

All the food was brought out separately as it was done, which was a bit unusual but I get they want you to have it as fresh as possible.  The Peruvian pork poutine came out in about 5 minutes &amp; was fantastic.  The pork was thinly sliced, flavored wonderfully with a lighter cheese  sauce &amp; nice, fresh, hot, soft fries.  The ONLY ding I have on the fries was that they needed a little salt to me.  

The milanese samich came out a few minutes after the poutine.  The bun was extremely fresh, soft and big.  The chicken was hammered very thin &amp; fried and came with small, thin fried taters and basil-y mayo and some other seasonings.  I thought the samich was very good but not blow me away good.

Also, be sure to try out an Inca Cola. Apparently, it&#39;s a Peruvian type creme soda and it&#39;s sweetness goes well with the salty, savory sandwiches.

I pass by this place almost every day after coming from the train station and I&#39;ve had it on my list of restaurants to visit but after over 100 Yelp reviews at 4.5 stars, I could no longer hold off.  Very nice couple as owners.  Got to talk to them a little while I was there.  Asked them what the most ordered item was and they mentioned the Chicharon.  I come from the Philippines and this is a specialty there as well so I asked what the next most ordered item was.  Got the Lomo Saltado to go.  They have a small seating area but it wasn&#39;t packed when I got there around 6 pm.  I think most people order to go?  Anyways the sandwich tasted like Filipino steak my dad makes but instead of eating with rice...it was on a bun with some French fries stuck in-between.  I love my dad&#39;s cooking so this hit the mark.  Very tasty.  The meat was a little thicker and very tender.  My maybe only complaint is it could have had more meat for a $9 sandwich but you certainly can&#39;t beat the taste..  I will definitely go back and try the rest of the menu.

I eat out a lot and sometimes it&#39;s hard to get excited about the usual dinner fare.  What a wonderful surprise to find that there is a whole new (to me, anyway) cuisine - Peruvian!  

Since Peruvian food is so new to me I really don&#39;t have any idea what we ate - I had a delicious steak sandwich.  My wife had a pork shoulder with pickled red onion and sweet potato sandwich.  The fried yucca was an interesting new flavor; but probably the biggest surprise was the chicken fried rice.  Simple, Subtle and incredibly delicious.

When I pulled up, the open sign was flashing, so I proceeded to walk up to the door noticing that I arrived close to an hour before they opened. The two workers in the back let me inside anyway and even offered that I eat inside after I insisted multiple times I could just take it to go since they weren&#39;t officially open yet. At this point I was already very pleased by the welcoming and homey vibe from SanguChe. 

I decided on the Lomo Saltado sandwich(Sirloin saut̩ed in garlic vinegar and soy sauce) and was not disappointed. It came on a French roll that was toasted to perfection and topped with tender sirloin topped with fries. The flavor is amazing and not something you can really explain to those who have not tried Peruvian food. 

I definitely got the fee of one of those small fusion restaurants in the city and almost forgot I was in Naperville.

For starters it was indeed a quaint place  about 4 tables of 4  and 2 longer tables we sat at a longer table, because the place was filled. So what was all this hype about i was certainly excited i could smell the goodness..

What you do is walk up to the lady , and she has a nifty order taking machine, all digital..kind of cool.  the menu was easy to read, i went with  the Lomo Saltado  and also we got a Milanesa sandwich  wifey got a salad, and some Yucca  and we also had a side of rice, with a couple of pepsis..

I will say this everything we had was good.. But it was nothing i couldnt make in my own house,, Starters the salad was very good  wifey, is from costa rica ,, and the peruvian salad is very simliar. The Yucca was excellent as well a good portion, now the sandwhiches  and i am being honest im not going to ride on this hype train,  the chicken sandwhich was just like a chicken sandwhich i would have at a bar,, there was no real flavour,, and no spices that either me or wifey found exciting..

The solado ((beef was over cooked)) thrown over some fresh cuts fries, and peppers,, i did NOT find these two sandwhiches worth the price the beef was 9.00  the chicken 8.50  way overpriced..The rice was very good complete with onions, and much chicken, somewhat flavorfull..

Im sorry i really wanted to like this place the people there were nice,(the owners) but  there was one cook  and serving all those people it was quite clear he was rushed,, they even brought one sandwhich at a  time out..not all at once , and the salad DIDNT come first,,  I think this place could be really good, if the food was better im giving a 3 star but it was  more like 31/2..

I would encourage you to try it, well head over for some lebanese next week, my review comming soon,,,

The final verdict: a total price of 34.00 bucks for 2 people 2 sandwhiches , fries, salad , rice and 2 pepsis...

Maybe well try it again when more attention can be given to quality this was very aveage me and wifey agree on this one,,,
I had the rest of the chicken sandwhich the next day  it was so bland no flavor..just like a chicken sandwhich at  Micky D&#39;s and I never go there anymore...  very disappointed..

Let me give you my experience here :

It&#39;s a rainy afternoon and I just got out of yoga... As I walk through the door I&#39;m greeted by smiles, hellos and a board of pictures of people at Machu Picchu! I start to gander the menu and see aji de gallina, lomo saltado and chicharr_n - all famous Peruvian dishes I&#39;m well aware of :) (I&#39;m thinking at this point this is too good to be true) and of course it is for me since I&#39;m a newly vegetarian. Wahhhhhhhh... so I figure I can start with the fried yucca and maybe a salad. Oh no, no, no ... Cesar, the nicest chef around, catches wind of the fact I don&#39;t eat meat and offers to whip me up a sandwich of veggies! :) :) :) 

Now I&#39;m thinking this could go wrong. This could go terribly wrong since I&#39;m already well aware of how rich these food combos can be- tomatoes marinated with cilantro, onions and lime, olive sauce, eggs, aji sauce .... But fear not because Cesar really knows what the heck he&#39;s doing in that kitchen- the first bite and taste buds exploded- ( it took me back to Lima, Peru- literally). You wonder why there&#39;s no picture with this review? Because I devoured my sandwich and sweet/spicy/peanut coleslaw (seriously an awesome spin on Asian Peruvian fusion and American slaw)... I also washed that down with fried yucca and huancaina sauce(best dipping sauce ever), part of a tamale and an alfajore(the first think I ate)... Let&#39;s just say my belly and heart were extremely satisfied. 

Now I can&#39;t sit here and give all the credit to the food because anyone can cook - I mean, I cook Peruvian food, and yes it&#39;s hard, but it can be done! But there is some serious talent here. Cesar is not only from Peru but has moved around the U.S. cooking at various places. His concept of sandwiches on these famous dishes is genius and you won&#39;t be left wanting more. All the food and ingredients are fresh and prepped each week, which is not easy, if you&#39;ve ever cooked these dishes. Cesar also does a great job explaining this food to newcomers as I asked how overwhelming it must be for people who have never seen this stuff before. Hearing his story made the experience just that much more awesome and his and his mothers hospitality and friendliness made me feel like I was in their home (how it normally is in Peru too!) Thank you again for that :) 

All and all, this little slice of paradise has something for everyone. I recommend the lomo saltado (steak lovers) or chicharr_n, Salchipapa for the kids, Plato del mes for the drunkies and tamales for the brunch goers. Again, you really can&#39;t go wrong and if you&#39;re still lost don&#39;t be afraid to ask Cesar- he won&#39;t steer you the wrong way! Keep up the good work Sanguche - my new favorite place!

No frills, cooked with love and taste profiles that are complex and reflect truly authentic Peruvian food. Chef Cesar, who is Peruvian, and his mother have brought a new, vibrant taste to the suburbs. 
The sandwiches are out of this world. The meats- chicken, pork or beef are all tender, flavorful and well portioned. The Aji de Gallina a shredded chicken dish as a sandwich is awesome. My other favorite is Chicharron, a pork butt sandwich with meat that melts in your mouth. The same is true of the sirloin. 
Another authentic dish is Peru Poutine which is your choice of meat over hand cut fries smothered in Huancaina sauce. It is absolutely incredible.

I love Peruvian food, and am lucky enough to have tasted authentic versions of it. This place didn&#39;t disappoint! I ordered an all time favorite: Aji De Gallina, which is Peru&#39;s answer to chicken curry. The sauce is made by blending milk, bread crumbs, chicken stock and aji yellow peppers. The aji pepper is extremely rare outside of Peru, and is only available in paste form in the states. The base dish is a tad bland but you have to add the spicy aji salsa to get the full effect of the dishes&#39; flavor. I love that it was paired w sweet potatoes, as Peru has a plethora of potatoes cultivated there.  The neatest thing is you can order this dish as a platter or in sandwich form. They offer plenty of other options of well known Peruvian dishes presented in sandwich such as Lomo Saltado. I will be trying that next time :). On the weekends they offer Peruvian tamales wrapped in banana leaves. Nice music and a friendly staff round this place out to a solid 5 stars! This hidden gem doesn&#39;t disappoint with it&#39;s authentic offerings, unique concept, and great staff! They even have a wall where customers can bring their Peruvian trip photos (bringing some of mine for sure).",09/01/16,157,5,3,5,51,5.0133,3.0489999999999995,0.155,12.796,No,1286

So I drove 15 miles to get food from this place and it was empty because it was Sunday at 19:25. I was immediately greeted as I walked in the door by the chef and he ask me what I would like. I told him I have no idea but what do you recommend. He said try the Adobo de Cerdo and I trusted his judgment as I had no clue what anything was. I also ordered the Yucca with some pepper and cheese sauce and holy Peruvian was it so good. As I was waiting for my food to cook, the chef was giving me samples of stuff on the menu and it was all so good. I wanted to order everything on the menu but didn&#39;t have enough time.

I would&#39;ve given 5 stars, but our waitress wasn&#39;t the nicest, but she wasn&#39;t mean.

I delivered pizza for 3 years and not carrying at least $5 to make change is unforgivable.

Now, on to the food. Evidently, Randall Roadhouse hasn&#39;t figured out that hot food left to sit in plastic containers with no ventilation results in everything being incredibly soggy.

randall-roadhouse-carpentersville-2,Mark G.,GwjAyvXwevobwDPecPOEhA,fnKxDJ26QYrKM_CtHbS7fg,"We have been frequent diners for awhile and love the food and service.
However our recent visit was so disappointing. From start to finish.
Didn&#39;t get any server to our table for 10 minutes and had to get hostess to find someone.
Our server seemed irritated to take our table and was very quick about taking our order and made sure she told us this mistake was NOT her fault. She told us they were out of fries and wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we left because of it. One of the drinks had what seemed to be a small piece of lettuce in it, but we took it out and blew it off. (another time in the past, there was a paper strip that&#39;s used to secure the silverware into the napkins, in one drink)
First round of food took forever. Finally came ate that, then ordered the bigger meals.
Figured the Chicago Pizza would take longer then the nachos but we were wrong. They both came out together and also took forever. Not sure why as restaurant was not busy. Think the servers last comment she made before checking on us of &#34;oh shucks&#34; meant she forgot to put the nacho order in.
When nachos came out they looked different.  We order these almost every time we come in.
The cheese was barely melted, barely any chili and the chicken was cut so large you had to cut it up. My first bite into my nachos I had a piece of what seemed to be plastic wrap or bag.
Asked hostess, as our server was MIA again, if there was  manager on duty, she said yes and I asked her to send them to our table...5 min later the server came back and we told her our issues, she apologized offered to make another we accepted.  Those came back normal and good. One ingredient was missing from our pizza. Not once did a manager come to our table, which is not good customer service. 
One of my kids wanted Ice cream and she came back 10 min later saying they were out and next time we come in we could get some . She packed our food, but didn&#39;t realize until next day she forgot to pack one meal. Took awhile to get bill but she finally she brought it and guess what? Not ours!
We watched from a distance and could see her fidgeting through her checks and came to our table.
Seems as though the one comment on here about them caring more about the remodel then their customer service is correct!  Not sure we will be going back. Not worth the money, if the service has gone to crap and the management doesn&#39;t give one.",21/03/16,267,1,1,-1,-34,-1.2820999999999998,1.131,2.24,25.63,No,2411

Everything else here I like.  It&#39;s a decent sized place, very clean with lots of nice flat screen TV&#39;s &amp; a couple of projection screens.  It doesn&#39;t matter where you sit, you WILL see the game.  Oh, and they don&#39;t have music blaring over the big game either - they have the audio on so you can see AND hear the action.

The service was quick and friendly.  They have a HUGE menu, which we found surprising.  We weren&#39;t expecting to have so many choices from a sports bar...they have a whole page worth of items on the menu that&#39;s just steaks and pasta dishes.  We did find the &#34;Chef&#39;s Corner&#34; area of the menu a bit confusing...I&#39;m guessing those are their &#34;specialty&#34; or &#34;signature&#34; items.  Most places put those items in the appropriate area/category of the menu and then highlight them in some way (which I would prefer) but not here.  So there I was surprised they didn&#39;t have a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich on the menu when my hubby pointed out they do, it&#39;s just not listed with the sandwiches, it&#39;s in the &#34;Chef&#39;s Corner&#34;.

Everything we tried tasted good &amp; was good quality.  I liked that there were a few choices for side items with the burgers/sandwiches (fries, onion rings, coleslaw or cottage cheese).  But I did think many things were a bit overpriced.  $7.50 for fried zucchini or fried mushrooms?  Maybe they are giving you a pound and a half of &#39;em, I don&#39;t know - but that&#39;s the same price they are charging for 12 fried shrimp...I don&#39;t know, I guess most places are raising their prices these days just to make ends meet.

This place has been open a little longer than 5 years and that is saying something for a start up local bar in this economy and the reason isn&#39;t hard to understand after ordering your first meal here. The food is simply above average quality for the price. The portions are large and the ingredients are fresh and vibrant and full of flavor.

Their food is ok, nothing special at all which is expected from a regular bar.  My main problem is with their &#34;regulars&#34; whom happen to stare you down the moment you walk in like its southern 1920 and you&#39;re black.

The worst part is the table with the most obnoxious people, who just sit there mean-mugging and give you a hard time for using the juke-box.  They had a SERVER that WORKS THERE whom had just gotten off her shift and joined them, she just sat there laughing it off with them.

I can&#39;t believe how Neanderthalish these people can be, all we did was order food, play some Golden T and get some tunes going.  We kept to our selves and disregarded everything until one of my buddies got shoved aside from one of the guys going to the restroom.  We could have made it a point to take the 3 Twerps outside and put a few dents in their fragile frames, but figured we&#39;d be gentlemen and just leave.  The place would probably put it on us since we&#39;re new customers anyways.   

I figured a nice midwest suburb 2 weeks from 2010 would have gotten past trailer-trash behavior, but I was wrong.  Even the bartender was less than courteous.  

It&#39;s their loss because we are new in this town and looking for a close-by bar to start visiting and bringing friends and family to.  I will never go there again, it&#39;s not like their food warrants taking such hostile treatment;  I had the spicy chicken burger with jalapeno and it was less than average.  Their poppers were average, but they did have a decent Diablo Shrimp appetizer.   

I plan writing a letter to the owner regarding that idiotic server, in case he cares to make new customers. 

To be fair our server was nice, and perhaps when you visit during different hours (I visited in the evening on both counts), perhaps you won&#39;t run into trashy people like this.",13/12/09,206,1,1,0,-19,-0.7945000000000001,1.401,1.425,13.174999999999999,No,1988

They recently won the BEST BURGER award for the entire mchenry county and this award was through the daily herald and done by the people, not some food critics.  

This place is a bar/restaurant with more of a bar than restaurant.  As you enter you notice a very large and long bar, lots of large TV&#39;s and a large projector TV as well.  To your right there are some stairs that take you up to a higher level (but still in the same room) to where there are about 15-20 tables and booths to sit down and eat.  Since there is smoking in the bar area, i could imagine on a busy day the smoke would carry up to the eating area, but we have gone in the afternoons since it&#39;s less crowded (i have kids).  

Of course i had to get the burger, and let me tell you, its the best ive had in the NW suburbs.  My other favorite was the village squire burgers but these are just a little better.  I did not care for the pizza as much but other things i have tried there were great.

However, Rosa J. made it work and found &#34;Taqueria Los Laureles&#34; inside a tiny supermercado in Rolling Meadows, not too far from the Woodfield business/shopping districts.  She literally went through three (3) pages worth of Yelp search because she wanted something inexpensive with a local flare.  

This place is mainly &#34;solo para llevar,&#34; but there are five (5) chairs available for patrons choose to dine in.  Hubby and I ordered two (2) gorditas de asada, two (2) tacos de chile relleno, and two (2) horchatas medianas.  The total came to $19 and some change.  

The steak was made fresh, which I could see what the cook was making in action.  The Mexican police soap opera kept everyone entertained.  It was a bit funny and occasionally over the top.  Nevertheless, my Spanish is still at the elementary level and didn&#39;t fully understand every line.

Hubby was glad that the chile relleno taco was available for those who want non-meat options.  The only minor complaint I had was the corn masa pocket was slightly dry, and the horchata could use a bit more cinnamon to balance out the &#34;sugary&#34; taste.

taqueria-los-laureles-rolling-meadows,Bernadette M.,zKjpiG6knomktlqYVlPRag,X1XwPB6paeQGq4wK79e3cA,"This place is awesome. It&#39;s inside of a grocery store and I would have never known of its existence if it wasn&#39;t for you awesome yelpers. I ordered myself a burrito for $5 for lunch last week. It was stellar. Very fresh, the steak was flavorful and tender and did I mention the burrito was huge? I couldn&#39;t finish it and ate the rest the next day. It was still good although I microwaved it.

This is definitely not a sit down type place although there is a counter with some chairs where you can eat what you&#39;ve ordered. Seating is limited so it&#39;s more of a grab n go. 

I love this place, I want to try their tacos next.

Although the ambiance of this place might throw you off, don&#39;t let that defer you from the amazing food!

Edit: Just came here  a second time for lunch again because I was dying to try their tacos. I ordered one pastor, one chorizo, and the third was barbacoa. I really enjoyed the pastor and barbacoa. The barbacoa tasted the best, I will definitely be ordering that one again. The pastor was delicious as well. Both were very juicy but not to the point where it destroys the taco. The chorizo was good but not great, I&#39;ve had better. 

What I like most about this place is that it&#39;s 100% authentic. I can&#39;t name a lot of places around the suburbs that think to give you lime with your tacos although that should be a standard thing always. 

The tacos were huge as well and I&#39;m not sure if it was because it was lunch time, but I bought three tacos for $7 and got a can of pop as well. 

I am definitely going to be a returning customer.",01/08/16,168,5,2,5,50,5.425600000000001,4.4239999999999995,0.915,16.660000000000004,No,1603

Lol all in good fun though.  But I always have to think how authentic because a place like El Sombrero that I reviewed is the furtherest thing away from Mexican food. It&#39;s kinda like that hot sauce from New York city!

Moving on from my side comments and history trying to find gems in the suburbs...this is definitely an authentic Mexican taqueria (meaning what&#39;s served is likely limited to tacos, tortas and burritos and of course rice and beans). It&#39;s a small little grocery store that reminds me of a few of those little shops on the south side I grew up in.  On the back corner is their restaurant.

The price is pretty cheap, especially for the portions you get.  The food is not the bet but it is pretty darn good.  Very tasty and filling.  Their carne asada is okay but I like the Milanesa (breaded steak).  Try this place out, it doesn&#39;t disappoint.

Leagua is my next taco to try.....

Bonus is while I wait I can pick up a few Mexican  pantry items that they don&#39;t carry at the European Markets or Mariano&#39;s since its a taco counter in a small grocery store.

As a note about the service.  It&#39;s a taco counter in a mercato - so no white linen service but the nice guy with text book perfect English is fun to chat with and when the very nice lady that didn&#39;t know any English took my boyfriends order and he was ordering Napolitas asada and I was trying to tell him it was cactus and he didn&#39;t believe me she could someone that could explain it to him.

Carne asada tacos are seasoned well and the quality of the meat is above average compared to other Taquerias in the local area.  Other stand outs are the chicken and carnitas tacos.  The sauces they give with with your meal are very good:  green being on the spicier side - red having a bit more flavor and less heat.

taqueria-los-laureles-rolling-meadows,Justin B.,HrYA4KBu4G-gW1FblE0GSA,085az1rGN0TWyMUiGOLxIA,"Fantastic place.  It is a tiny grocery store and the take out place is in the back right corner.  The menu consists of burritos, tacos and tortas (I have no idea what a torta is).
Burittos are 4.99, tacos are 1.75 (best deal is 3 w/ can of pop for $5), and I have no idea what a torta is lol. (went yesterday so prices are estimates)
I had the burrito and my gf got 2 tacos (which she thought was a quesidilla but I will go into more details on that a little later)
My burrito was godly, the menu is pretty barebones in terms of describing what the heck is actually in the burrito.  I took a few bites of it and was a little disappointed that it did not have what I thought should be in a burrito (beans and rice).  Thank goodness it didn&#39;t have that bull crap because it would have taken away real estate from the glorious glorious meat.  I got the al pastor (which is marinated port, I am a huge pork lover) and it was the best meat I have ever had.  It was delicious.  I am not a big foodie so I decide what tastes delicious by how much I want another bite, and Oh how I wanted bite after bite.  The burrito was comprised of lettuce, grilled onions, tomatoes (which I hate and would have asked for them to remove if it was listed on the menu, but again the menu is literally Burrito - al Pastor... and nothing else!), and meat the glorious meat.  Next time I go I am going to get the 3 taco combo so I can try other types of meat cuz goodness gracious it was good.  The burrito itself was not big but it was so good.  In terms of value, I would say it is just as good as those other burrito places (Moe&#39;s Mondays might be a better value since it is a bigger burrito w/ drinks and chips but it does not compare in taste at all).
My gf got two &#34;quesidillas&#34; it was located at the bottom of the taco section.  So she thought they were going to be quesidillas but they were quesidilla tacos so she could have gotten the 3 taco deal and had a good old time.  But anyways, she absolutely loved them and she loves this place more than Qdoba (which is her go to &#34;Mexican&#34; food place, she goes all the time to that terrible place).  Even though she did not get a quesidilla she still loves the place more than Qdoba, quite an accomplishment.
We both had a hard time of ordering since we do not speak spanish.  I think of it as part of the fun, I do not think she liked that aspect as much as I did.  
In sum,  this place is awesome.  It is located in the strip mall on Algonquin along with China 1 and a Dunkin&#39; Robbins.  Funny thing is that it is located right next to an actual sit down Mexican Restaurant, screw that I am going to the grocery store for my restaurant needs!
I love mexican food but I am no means an expert when it comes to this delicacy.  So come try it out if you are not a taco snob.  It is delicious and if anything it is cool to look at all of the different mixes of canned beans there is in the world while your food is being prepared (that was not a racist comment, the counter is directly across from the beans and canned jalape̱os section, if you were curious there is a can that has beans and jalape̱os in one can, real crazy).",26/08/13,348,5,2,5,13,10.3606,5.574,0.9830000000000001,20.444000000000003,No,3179

taqueria-los-laureles-rolling-meadows,Jeremy J.,8nCbLz3H2qfehaf7Ps-fWw,9YIzyIxPRKnypu7SzahhkQ,"We went here for tacos and were not impressed.  My wife ordered 2 lomo (ribeye), and received 1 lomo (good) and 1 skirt steak (not so good).  I liked the lengua (tongue) and the cabeza (head meat).  The al pastor was not good.  The sauce was more of a paste of dry spices and a little liquid.  The chiccaron (pork rinds) pretty much ruined my meal.  It was not crispy like I&#39;ve had other places.  It was mushy and chewy at the same time.  It seemed to have been boiled instead of deep fried.  But the worst part about the chiccaron is that it was incredibly spicy.  I had no desire to finish it, but would not have been able to if I wanted to.  And I actually like spicy foods.

The reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 2 is the chiccaron that I bought from the meat counter.  It&#39;s fantastic!  It&#39;s both seasoned and cooked perfectly, and has nice chunks of meat as well.  I will go back just for more of that.  If only they put that in the tacos.  They call these pork cracklins in the south and they&#39;re hard to find around here.  If you&#39;ve never had them, I highly recommend it.  It&#39;s salty, bacony, fatty, crispy, all at the same time.  So good, and certainly so bad for you.  

Overall this place is just ok as a taqueria (as long as you stick to the more tame varieties).  With so many other great places, I won&#39;t be going back here for tacos.

 To begin with I tried this place for the first time a few months ago as I had a Groupon... I ordered a few appetizers for the house party with zero expectations and everyone loved the chilli fish and then again on a weekday my wife and I dropped in to explore the dine in experience and we noticed this place has a decent ambience than the most hyped Indian restaurants around, we ordered the hakka noodles and chilli chicken and the food was cooked to perfection and had nice flavor. We also met the owner Tony who was very friendly and we chatted about how passionate he was about running a restaurant and how he ended up starting this place after managing many other restaurants in Chicago.

Then last nite being a lazy Friday night we thought  staying in and ordering some food and that&#39;s when Tony totally blew us away with the food. We ordered the Chicken 65, Chicken Cafreal and goat fry and we were amazed by the flavors poping in our mouth. 

The chicken 65 is not the usual stuff you get at other places, it had an authentic rare taste that I had not tasted in many years since I left India. Chicken Cafreal woww!!! This had a unique distinguished flavor that I had never tasted before, the gravy was green in color and came highly recommend by Tony and he said it was a Portuguese- Goan dish... then the goat fry was very well cooked the pieces just melted in my mouth and my wife who is not usually a fan of goat meat tasted it and loved it.

To sum up my long review...over the years I have easily tried over 30 + places in and around Chicago and I can confidently say this place is the most under rated Indian place in the city that deserves it&#39;s due credit. I rate this place way above all those overhyped  Indian restaurants like Bombay Chopstics, Bawarchi, Paradise , Bamboo garden etc. that just spice/color up and serve food with zero flavor. If you are a foodie that is not just looking for a typical South Indian, North Indian spicy or mild kinda food this is your safe haven... It&#39;s different... It has the best Indo Chinese in the town and then brings that rare Goan cuisine into picture.

All in all our new favorite place for Indian food!  Highly recommended!!!

spice-grill-rolling-meadows,Eliel C.,GfcpFSNYWAMu_c4vRn2weg,nzIvQZRt4brwNYlEe3HcIw,"Very good food with decent service. Probably the best chicken tikka masala I&#39;ve ever had (out of about a dozen places recently) and the Chicken tandoori was pretty amazing. It&#39;s cooked the traditional Indian way, skewered in a clay oven (Tindoor)

The outside looks like an abandoned Wendy&#39;s, with the old school sun room and all. Random plants and weeds for the landscaping and busted down parking lot pavement. Minimal, basic sign also.

The inside is actually decently nice, especially when contrasted with the exterior. Looked clean, except for the men&#39;s bathroom, which was more on the nasty side.

Other than waiting a quick minute or two to be seated (Only 1 server, 1 bus boy on the floor for a Friday evening) the rest of the service was pretty quick. Attentive, prompt water refills, as well as timely table clearing (before next corse served) 

You get these thin, oily, crispy chips to dip with a sweet brown sauce and spicy green sauce, complimentary before you order. Was pretty flavorful and unique. 

You can also ask for spicy sauce on the side (a must for almost all my meals) which had a good kick and nice flavor. 

Over all: a very tasty, decently priced and exotic spot to eat. Good service to boot. I would definitely come back and recommend! Enjoy life :)",30/07/16,172,4,3,5,60,5.7169,4.082,0.31,10.607999999999997,No,1295

spice-grill-rolling-meadows,Elana K.,D8WuAA6QO6plFiGT_cyjdg,CnhUxHON5vsnX4MEyBeLBQ,"I had high hopes for this restaurant because, right now, it is one of the higher-rated Indian restaurants in the area.  However, this place is just &#34;okay&#34; in my book.  I am probably spoiled because I&#39;m from Schaumburg, which is home to a variety of excellent Indian restaurants.  But with that disclaimer out of the way:
 
I came here for the weekday lunch buffet, which was a reasonable $10 per person.  One of the first things I noticed was there were no Indian patrons dining here, so take that for what you will.  The second thing I noticed was that my shoes immediately became sticky from walking on their floor.  I&#39;m usually one to overlook that sort of thing, especially if the food is good, but...

There wasn&#39;t as much variety of food as I&#39;m used to from other Indian buffets, and everything skewed bland.  I know it is common for buffets to tone down the spiciness level, but the food was not just not spicy; it also sort of lacked &#39;soul.&#39;  What I ate was serviceable, but there was nothing that made me say &#34;That was so good, I&#39;m going back for some more.&#34;  Even the naan was only pretty good, and when it comes to naan I&#39;m used to speaking in superlatives, so &#34;pretty good&#34; is a downgrade from what I&#39;m used to.

The service was minimal, since it was a buffet, but it was quick at least.  No complaints there.

Overall, I would not be in a rush to come back here, but I might return if a friend wanted to come.  I hate to leave such a lackluster review because the staff seemed nice enough, and everything was basically okay, but I guess that&#39;s what my review boils down to: this place is okay, but there are just other places I would prefer to go.",29/04/16,180,3,1,3,6,2.9090999999999996,1.242,1.01,11.748000000000001,No,1724

The outside is meh, but the inside is ok. The buffet is in a small corner in the back by the register, which leads directly into the kitchen. A weird spot... we almost didn&#39;t see it.

The service was quick, but the server seemed uninterested in everything. I guess typical buffet.

The food selections are small.. they only had a couple things, 2 appetizers, 2 types of rice, 2 vegetarian dishes, 3 meat, 3 desserts, and some veggies, and sauces. Everything was tasty, but really salty!! So salty we mostly had 1 plate each. I drank about 2 whole cups of water and even more all throughout the day after lunch. Terrible.

My favorites were butter chicken and the veggie samosa even though they were super salty. The tandoori chicken was made from thighs and drumsticks, but they were still somehow dry... I avoided the Chinese dish because who eats Chinese food at an Indian restaurant?? 

The naan was fresh made. It was probably the best thing we ate.

I didn&#39;t wanna mention it when I was there... buuuut.. I found a thick black hair in my butter chicken. I didn&#39;t want to gross out the people I was with (especially since it was their first time eating Indian food) so I didn&#39;t say anything, but I lost my appetite after that.

The price is reasonable, but it made sense because there wasn&#39;t that much to choose from. 

I do think the food could be good, if they didn&#39;t put so much salt (and hair). 

I was put off by that though, so I doubt I&#39;ll be going back and neither will the people I came with. I&#39;m just disappointed that the 3 people I was with had a horrible experience for their first time with Indian food :(",16/01/16,208,1,1,0,-22,-0.31759999999999977,1.595,2.25,19.157,No,1869

Prices are expensive considering the depressing atmosphere and ambience but the quality is good and quantity is good as well. I think the owner will do better by opening a carry-out place after reducing prices. Location is not good, find a better one to increase traffic.

I can only judge on what I tried which were the following:

We ordered the dinner for two which was $49 and we chose the hot and sour soup with chicken, chicken 65, chicken tikka, chicken makhani, and gulab jamun and kheer. The order does come with rice and garlic naan automatically.

pappadam: free chips before meal were fine, but they were greasy and the oil tasted like it was old. The sauces were good though.

Hot and sour soup with chicken: plus side, it came out steaming hot, which is a great sign. The flavor was just too sour and lacked spicy heat. The chicken that was in the soup was fried, but the chicken looked like it was freezer burnt. Very strange texture on the chicken (rubbery/hard).

Chicken 65: It was probably one of the better things that we actually tried. It was very very greasy, and there was a pool of oil on the plate. The flavor was fine, but definitely not spicy or, in my opinion, traditional. 

Chicken makhani: This is also known as butter chicken. This was the most bland butter chicken ever. There was no spice, no heat, no balance whatsoever. I can make a better butter chicken than that, and I have! I was very disappointed in this dish. It was just like pureed tomatoes with some butter added and some chicken. 

Chicken Tikka: This one was a surprise. We assumed we were getting chicken tikka MASALA, but instead it was just the tandoor grilled chicken. This would have been fine if the chicken was not DRY and overcooked. When it arrived at our table, the chicken was visibly dry on the outside, and clearly they did not baste it with butter or oil. It was dry on the inside and had no flavor or spice, and it needed salt too! Very disappointed.

The rice was just fine, nothing awesome. 
The garlic naan was actually pretty good. I would say that was also probably the best thing we had.

The gulab jamun was just mediocre and so was the kheer. The description of the kheer said it comes with pistachios and almonds, and of course were not present on my dish. It would have been nice to have some texture.

The service was good enough, the server was nice and prompt.

How do I even begin?

Let&#39;s start with the food:
0. Pappadum-for free!!!! We got a nice sized basket of these treats before our dinner came out, pleasant surprise 
1. Chicken tikka masala-gooood! How can you go wrong with this dish and they did this one just right
2. Goat curry-holy cow, you have to try this one. Very flavorful, right amount of spiciness, amazing with the naan (which by the way, buttery goodness, omg ^_^)
3. Aloo Gobi-this is the cauliflower and potato veggie dish, nice complement to our meat heavy dishes. So yummy, non gelatinous like those buffet ones tend to be)
4. Tandoori appetizer platter-we didn&#39;t want to order just the tandoori chicken so we got the whole appetizer platter. Wish the chicken tandoori was a little burnier but that&#39;s just a personal preference
5. Kheer-the dessert, rice pudding, my favorite. They totally did it justice here, it&#39;s so much better than all the buffet kinds, the toppings were an added bonus!!!
6. Naan-I already raved about this up above but I&#39;ll do it again here; they are amazing. Probably the best one yet!

In all honesty, we probably ordered dinner for six people, but it was totally worth it because we have two more meals we can eat tomorrow, and how can I say no to that!!!

The waiter guy was really nice and attentive, he noticed I had dropped my knife from the other side of the restaurant and rushed to get me a new set!

Another Yelper had mentioned not to be put off by the exterior of the restaurant, and I totally agree with that sentiment-definitely do not judge this particular book by its cover.

We didn&#39;t know where to go and looked up a couple Thai and Indian restaurants in the area. Their $5.99 lunch special sealed the deal. Two people in our group also never had Thai food before so it was going to be a good experience.

Thai Thanee is a lovely little restaurant tucked away near the end of a strip mall that suddenly appears after driving through tons of residential areas. At noon on a Wednesday, there was no one there except one staff member (I assume there were more people in the back, but we never saw them). I was kind of surprised that we were the only people dining here. Oh well, more space for us!

We all ordered something different from the lunch special menu: an entree, a soup, two mini egg rolls, and a side of white rice. The soup (I forget what it was) was spicy, but good. The egg rolls were great!! I&#39;ve never had egg rolls that I actually liked before (I tend to avoid them) and I was scarfing these down. Sweet. My lunch was the Pad Woon Sen with Tofu -- it was delicious and just the right amount! I was a happy luncher. I think my co-workers were too (the two that never had Thai before enjoyed their dishes). I felt satisfied when I left -- good price, good food, good company.

Not sure if that is a testament to the other reviews complaining of slow service, but my take out has always been ready for pick up with in 10-15 minutes.  Impressive.

Thai food is Thai food is Thai food, I&#39;m a pretty staunch supporter of this viewpoint. It&#39;s hard to find terrible Thai, just as tough as it is to find excellent Thai. And Thai Thanee does nothing to battle my opinion. It&#39;s in a strip mall. Out of the way. Next to some Mexican joint. Near a 7-11. If none of these things excite you don&#39;t worry, the food won&#39;t either.

I&#39;ve had a handful of dishes from Thai Thanee. Their Chicken satay, spring rolls, Pad Thai, Pad Se Ewe, Pad Woonsen and Lard Nar are all about as standard as they come. Nothing to make me jump out of my seat, nor off a bridge. Just kinda sit there and chew noisily. The one bright spot I&#39;ve found on their menu is the Kaeng Panaeng, which is a great yellow curry with basil, peas, carrots, peppers and your choice of meat, chicken in my case. Over some rice it has a nice amount of spice but isnt overwhelming and the flavor really comes through. Props where props are due. 

It&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s just not all that good, either.",26/12/10,136,3,2,3,11,2.6416,1.851,0.562,15.587,No,1075

When we walked in, we were all surprised by how beautiful it is inside! The space is huge and the decor is great. They even have a few well-placed big screen TVs, so our football fans could watch the game. They also have a little unused(?) bar area to the right of the main door, and I couldn&#39;t help thinking what a great space that would be for private parties or mimosa brunches or whatever other trendy breakfast words people are into these days. 

Our waitress was friendly and made some great suggestions. I think her name was Lynda? Lynda, you&#39;re a rock star. 

We ordered a ton of food (way more than we could ever eat), but it was all good. The veggie benedict was excellent, although it was a good idea to get the hollandaise on the side because it was a little on the clumpy side. The pancakes with lingonberries were awesome, and I&#39;d like to give a special shout-out to whatever magic butter they come with. Great work, berry butter. Truly some of butter&#39;s best work. 

My sister had a wrap with ranch &#34;on the side&#34; -- but just ended up getting ranch everywhere and an extra side of ranch. I know some people love their ranch and all, but she&#39;s not one of them so it wasn&#39;t a great surprise. 

We also had about 3 orders of the potatoes between us, and they were pretty good but no one could finish a whole order because they were also veeerrry greasy -- so steer clear of the potatoes if that&#39;s not your thing.

I had biscuits and gravy with two eggs over easy and it also came with hash browns. The &#34;biscuit&#34; was more like some sort of bun and the gravy was like it came out of a can. The hash browns were undercooked and greasy. The only good thing was my over easy eggs. Guess the egg guy was on today!

Hit this place on a busy Sunday at around 11 AM. We were told the table would take five minutes but were seated in about two minutes. Awesome! The hostess served us waters and took our drink order after about four minutes of sitting and waiting. Waitress was nowhere in sight. A few minutes later she flew by serving another table and said she&#39;d be right with us. Then a few more minutes later she stopped at our table. After our meal was served, she apologized and said she&#39;s been in the business for 26 (or something like that) years and commented that some servers didn&#39;t show up. I guess she was trying to make it sound like her lack of attention wasn&#39;t because she wasn&#39;t experienced, but because they were understaffed. I got the feeling she was one of the managers.

The services by the staff members usually seem adequate, but sometimes you have to flag down a staff to be noticed and served.

So for the 1st time I decided to order take out. I got my regular jerk chicken sandwhich and it had no flavor at all. So I  decided to call and spoke to the manager. He was a complete jerk. I explained to him what was going on and wouldn&#39;t let me speak. 
When he finally stop talking i told him, because of his attitude, i definitely wont be going back to dine in or carry out.

Everything we ordered seem to lack flavor and a lot of it. Even the guacamole I wanted to just pour more salt into it. Everything tasted so plain and lack so much flavoring. Just felt like I was eating the same thing because it was that bland. 

We both got drinks and they both were pretty good but a little on the pricy side. I thought the drink made inside the pineapple was a very cute concept and match well with the theme that was going on. Our waitress was top notch. Before we ordered, we told her we were a bit in a rush and she quickly brought out our food so that there was enough time for us to eat during our 1 hour window for our lunch break. She was even kind enough to bring over the check and some to go boxes because she didn&#39;t want us to wait on her.

I tried the zombie drink (quite tasty) and the sesame crusted ahi for my entree. The dish was very satisfying- I love Ahi tuna- but quite small. We also tried the chocolate island cake, which was way too rich for my taste. Their signature draft beer, the Aruba red was very refreshing after this meal.

You feel like you&#39;ve been swept away from Schaumburg to a Carribean Island upon entering. The menu is HUGE, so many food and beverage options it was hard to decide. They have 11 different options for Margaritas alone!

Hibiscus Margarita- this was HUGE just like the menu, came with a pretty edible flower!

Warm Spinach Dip and Chips- probably could have done without this. The dip was pretty liquidy rather than creamy and didn&#39;t have much depth of flavor. Did like that they gave some plantain chips along with the tortilla chips though

Coconut Shrimp Tacos- w/ side of beans and rice and Sriracha aioli, really frickin&#39; good! Makes me crave them writing this review

They have a dining area where a person is singing to you live. They have another fancier dining area that has a fire pit in the middle (awesome!). Then they have three other dining areas, each secluded from the other. They have a bar area in the dead center of the restaurant that has three TVs, my friends and I enjoyed catching the ending of the Bulls game. They also have a bar area in the huge dining hall with the singer. I asked one of the waiters if it&#39;s possible to reserve this room and she told me yes (but it wasn&#39;t a confident yes, so maybe she wasn&#39;t sure). Overall, I was very impressed with the ambiance of this restaurant.

We had a table reserved for 25 but only about 18 showed up. They had two separate long tables saved for us, but the 18 of us just managed to squish into one because we didn&#39;t really want to separate. No problems there. 

Now the service. Our server&#39;s name was &#34;Steven G&#34;. He was the best! We were all over the place with our orders and we kept shuffling seats, yet he still managed to bill us all correctly. He was very polite to us and showed no signs of annoyance even though we had many requests. He also made sure to check up on us frequently. Thank you Steven for taking great care of us. 

As for the food, expect to pay $10+ for a meal without any drinks or appetizers. I got the Black bean burger which was pretty descent. I asked to make mine spicy but I didn&#39;t taste a hint of spiciness. My friend requested Jalapenos on his, maybe I should have done that instead of asking for it to be spicy.

bahama-breeze-schaumburg,Alyssa J.,ad-KN1XpgrJr6j_lAfQnrg,BLMDfhhgpwO9lU_ZjZR-8g,"I went here for a team lunch on a Wednesday. It seemed to be your usual chain. Food seemed overpriced and the menu was massive (with listed calorie counts that made me stay away from almost everything). The whole place was dead - maybe 5 tables when we arrived at 12:30, but only one when we finally ordered at 1/1:15. And none when we left at 2:10. YES 2:10!

The service was slow from the start. She took a while to get our waters, then took forever to come back when we weren&#39;t sure what to order (massive menu!). When we were ready to order, we also had one latecomer arrive. Instead of getting another chair, she had us move to another table (not a big deal, I assume fire code restrictions or something). Then, we didn&#39;t see her for probably 20 minutes. Two of our people were without drinks. We finally ordered, and did I mention she was rude? I work in IT, with a team mostly made up of Indian people. A guy on my team was having trouble understanding the convoluted menu items and side combinations. She couldn&#39;t understand his accent I guess, and was not shy about it. She finally just said &#34;Yep!&#34; and moved on to the next person, completely not caring that his idea of what sides he ordered was not what he was going to get.

It then took forever to get our food. FO-REV-VER! Like close to 45 mins, and she never came by once during that whole time. The food was actually not bad (it was clear my coconut shrimp plate had been under the heat lamps too long). It was fine, but I was in a rush to get through it and back to the office by our 2:00 meeting. 

She was attentive and nice from the time she gave us our food and got our check. Overall really poor service, and I probably won&#39;t chose it again (mostly because I can&#39;t afford to spend two hours at a restaurant on a work day).",10/05/16,221,2,1,0,-30,-0.08219999999999994,1.026,0.9540000000000001,21.02,No,1822

bahama-breeze-schaumburg,Melissa K.,n1S4QCZFUQUIyde8rHT6Cw,QyKSiwtipSPgr1Tge99nQg,"Although I do not live in the Chicago area anymore, anytime I am back visiting my family I enjoy going to Bahama Breeze with them. My parents also go very frequently on their own. The atmosphere is awesome! It really makes you feel like you are on vacation. The food is also normally very good! However, this place has unfortunately gone down hill.

Tonight I visited with my parents. My dad and I both ordered mojitos. Mine (coconut) was very good, but my dad&#39;s (regular mojito) was odd tasting. It seemed like there wasn&#39;t sugar added, and almost tasted like Sprite or something very citrusy/acidic was added instead. My dad dealt with it and said it was fine, but it wasn&#39;t very pleasant tasting.

We started with the firecracker shrimp. Tasty. Decent size.

 I was disappointed to see the menu had changed and that the salmon pasta was no longer on the menu. I ordered the jerk chicken pasta instead, as I had had it a couple of times before and loved it. When I got the pasta it had plentiful chicken, but the taste of everything in the dish was just bland and not very good.  The pasta was a bit dry and the sauce was more watery than usual. 

However, my biggest gripe was that the dish was supposed to have mushroom and asparagus in it and it literally had like 6 chunks of each. By chunks I mean tiny bits less than an inch big! That&#39;s absolutely ridiculous! When I first started eating it I hadn&#39;t realized there wasn&#39;t really anything in it until I came across a piece of tiny asparagus and I thought it was maybe a mistake. Then I realized it was *supposed* to have both mushrooms and asparagus. What a rip off! Not to mention the taste overall was not up to their normal standards. I mentioned this to our server who was very apologetic and said she would tell the manager. 

It took forever for the manager to come over, and when she did she didn&#39;t even seem very concerned or apologetic. I feel like she tried to place the blame on me, like I had faked it or something, because she said, &#34;If you had told us sooner we would have fixed it for you.&#34; How about you tell your chefs to make the meals correctly instead? I was offered another meal or a  dessert, but I declined and just had it compted. Based on the fact it looked like the pasta had been slapped together and the chef probably doesn&#39;t care, I felt like it&#39;d be the type of place where your food would get spat into if you got replacement food. 

Our server was so sympathetic and apologetic, but the service was so slow! The place wasn&#39;t even crowded. My parents also said their food was disappointing compared to usual (and like I said, my family frequents this place!). It was just a bad experience overall. I&#39;m really sad, because this place was always a great dinner choice. I&#39;m so upset that the new management apparently doesn&#39;t care about good service or food. Giving no reason to customers for an obvious mistake in meal prep and having a lackadaisical attitude is a sure way to lose customers.",30/08/15,323,2,1,0,9,-0.5756000000000001,2.9770000000000003,3.439,31.587,No,3038

First off, could they be any cheaper with the air conditioning? It was so uncomfortably warm and stuffy inside that I had trouble enjoying myself, and that&#39;s saying a lot because I&#39;m the type of person who finds most places far too cold in the summer. 

Secondly, the food isn&#39;t all that for the price. $10 for 5 not that tasty coconut shrimp,and $17 for two chicken breasts with broccoli and sweet potatoes. And they don&#39;t even bother adding the plantains to the potatoes like they used to either. What a disappointment.

I&#39;m just happy we had a gift card and didn&#39;t spend any actual money here. I&#39;ll take what&#39;s left on the card and go to a different Darden restaurant.

Seems for the guacamole, all they did was squeeze out the avocado and served it. No seasoning at all. Their menu was limited and pricey. Portions were rather small. Drinks were served in smaller glasses. The service was mediocre. Many times we had to flag down our waitress for refills while leaving our table uncleared. Later, our waitress was not to be found so we asked another waitress to please clear our table which she did not. She probably figured it was not her table. 

Oh, the suggested gratuity amount on my receipt was wrong. They included the tax when the gratuity was tabulated. Sneaky. Expanded conversation:

How about us, I thought. Ruin our meal for the benefit of the next customer. Poor judgement and selfish on her part, assuming she just wanted to get her chores done early so she could leave at the end of her shift.

Because of her behavior, the meal (which was delicious) became a negative experience. That girl should not be working with the public.

As soon as we walked in we saw 3 hosts standing there talking, not a single one looked up or greeted us. They just stood there talking; and me being someone that works in a restaurant I found that VERY unprofessional, we did not feel welcome. We stood in front of them for a bit until one finally looked up and just stared. We asked for a table on the patio and she said she didn&#39;t have one even though it was practically empty, like she just didn&#39;t want to walk over there.

My next put off was when I went to the ladies room. Two young servers were standing there talking loudly and complaining about how they didn&#39;t want to be there and just wanted to go home and even some in restaurant drama. IN FRONT OF MANY CUSTOMERS! Swearing and all of that. How unprofessional and rude?!

Next came our server. We saw him maybe 3 times the whole night. He kept walking around and talking to other servers in front of customers. I wish we remembered his name, he said he&#39;d been there for 10 years but it sure felt like only 10 days. I felt like we weren&#39;t welcomed or wanted.

On our way out after being very disappointed with our food, (we would&#39;ve sent it back if our server actually came to check on us other than to bring us our bill) we walked past an entire row of servers leaning back and talking and standing in the small walkway by the porch bar. We had to say &#34;excuse me&#34; for them to even realize we were there trying to leave because they were too busy socializing! Out of the 6 or 7 servers standing there that we walked through, including our own, not a single one said goodbye or thank you for coming in or anything!!

However, I was less that blown away by Bahama Breeze.  The service was very choppy.  Staff seemed confused and kind of all over the place.  We had a relatively large group of 8 and the place was only about half full.  

The ambiance is nice, it really has been well put together and feels like you should walk out the door into a 80 degree night.  The restaurant is large and spaced out which I like.

We ordered edemame (I know, Japanese food at Caribbean restaurant... kinda weird).  They were fine, but we had to ask three different people for soy sauce and the first two adamantly denied that they even carried it... 

I ordered the Mahi with Shimp in Lemongrass sauce (D).  It sounded frigging amaze-balls and I was pumped to try it....   Then I did.   It was bland and tasted primarily of vegetable.  The fish was cooked fine, but the entree just didn&#39;t jive well.

The lobster/shrimp quesadillas were great, with chunks of the seafood falling out. A cup of sour cream and one of delicious tomato salsa made the 8 sandwich-size slices into flavors you can suit to your taste. Chicken quesadillas were good too. Nice starter for two or three, or a meal for one.

They offer several &#34;bowls&#34;, which are large one-bowl dinners. The Trinidad chicken bowl had a jerk-chickpea sauce with many large chicken chunks on a bed of rice, with a chutney sauce on top. What a neat idea. Every fork-full had a different flavor: plain, curry, jerk, sweet, and sweet-sour. The mahi shrimp bowl was very good too. On the specials, there was a goat-meat bowl with an interesting sauce; very good. This also had lots of meat. Bowl spices are not overwhelming.

Ribs came black, overcooked and dry, with fries that were so so. The slaw was wimpy and tasteless. My HH margarita was large, pricey, &amp; plain, but I don&#39;t know if it had any alcohol at all. Expensive colored water. Take a pass on these.

It was a good dish &amp; worth ordering.  For my entree I ordered the Calypso shrimp linguine.  The pasta is sauteed with garlic, scallions, tomatoes, spice and cream.

Moving chairs around, making noise, crawling under tables, and furiously sweeping for no apparent immediate need. When I asked her to stop, she snapped back that she wasn&#39;t doing it near us ( 3 feet away), and that she wanted the place to be clean for the next person.   
How about us, I thought. Ruin our meal for the benefit of the next customer. Poor judgement and selfish on her part, assuming she just wanted to get her chores done early so she could leave at the end of her shift.

Because of her behavior, the meal (which was delicious) became a negative experience. That girl should not be working with the public.

My friend&#39;s meal was wrong, so she had to sit and wait for hers while I ate.  The waitress should have at least comp&#39;ed her drink for that error.

As soon as we walked in we saw 3 hosts standing there talking, not a single one looked up or greeted us. They just stood there talking; and me being someone that works in a restaurant I found that VERY unprofessional, we did not feel welcome. We stood in front of them for a bit until one finally looked up and just stared. We asked for a table on the patio and she said she didn&#39;t have one even though it was practically empty, like she just didn&#39;t want to walk over there.

My next put off was when I went to the ladies room. Two young servers were standing there talking loudly and complaining about how they didn&#39;t want to be there and just wanted to go home and even some in restaurant drama. IN FRONT OF MANY CUSTOMERS! Swearing and all of that. How unprofessional and rude?!

Next came our server. We saw him maybe 3 times the whole night. He kept walking around and talking to other servers in front of customers. I wish we remembered his name, he said he&#39;d been there for 10 years but it sure felt like only 10 days. I felt like we weren&#39;t welcomed or wanted.

On our way out after being very disappointed with our food, (we would&#39;ve sent it back if our server actually came to check on us other than to bring us our bill) we walked past an entire row of servers leaning back and talking and standing in the small walkway by the porch bar. We had to say &#34;excuse me&#34; for them to even realize we were there trying to leave because they were too busy socializing! Out of the 6 or 7 servers standing there that we walked through, including our own, not a single one said goodbye or thank you for coming in or anything!! I couldn&#39;t imagine not greeting a customer on their way in or out at my restaurant! It&#39;s so unprofessional and very off putting.

However, I was less that blown away by Bahama Breeze.  The service was very choppy.  Staff seemed confused and kind of all over the place.  We had a relatively large group of 8 and the place was only about half full.  

The ambiance is nice, it really has been well put together and feels like you should walk out the door into a 80 degree night.  The restaurant is large and spaced out which I like.  I ordered a Mango Jalapeno Mohito and it was the highlight of my experience. A+  i would definitely return for another one (5) of those!!!

We ordered edemame (I know, Japanese food at Caribbean restaurant... kinda weird).  They were fine, but we had to ask three different people for soy sauce and the first two adamantly denied that they even carried it... 

I ordered the Mahi with Shimp in Lemongrass sauce (D).  It sounded frigging amaze-balls and I was pumped to try it....   Then I did.   It was bland and tasted primarily of vegetable.  The fish was cooked fine, but the entree just didn&#39;t jive well.

It was a good dish &amp; worth ordering.  For my entree I ordered the Calypso shrimp linguine.  The pasta is sauteed with garlic, scallions, tomatoes, spice and cream.  I was very surprised at how good this pasta was.  I wasn&#39;t expecting this from this restaurant but they definitely came through on a quality dish.  The restaurant was clean &amp; the service was fast &amp; friendly.  

Overall the restaurant was run well &amp; it was clean.  The service here was good &amp; most importantly the food was delicious.  I would definitely eat here again if I was in the area.",11/09/15,116,4,2,5,42,6.5035,3.694,0.146,13.16,No,1290

bahama-breeze-schaumburg,Kevin K.,fRltt9hDgO2hxzK3a657Qw,jbmnvJfrqeOsCNe4dzsmvw,"This place has two things going for it: Decent drinks and very friendly service, hence the star for each. The food, however is a totally different story. 

Came here last weekend with my girlfriend and her family to celebrate her dad&#39;s birthday because he had wanted to come here for the longest time. We had all heard high remarks about this place, thus our expectations were high going in. Upon setting foot in the restaurant, you really are transported to an island paradise. The colorful walls, tiki hut style interior, island music and even smell transport you to a totally different world. We were seated and greeted by Ashli, who was extremely personable and friendly, so that was a huge plus right off the bat! We placed our drink orders and waited about 10 minutes for those to arrive. My coconut mojito was absolute heaven! I typically like my mojitos prepared classic style but I decided to venture outside of my comfort zone a little bit and I am super happy I did. My girlfriend ordered some fancy drink served in a pineapple which looked yummy, her mom a pina colada with strawberry swirl which also looked good, and her dad, a pain killer which looked the least exciting out of all of ours. Everyone was pleased with the taste of their drinks, so we all thought that was a good sign.

Following our drinks, our appetizers came out. This is where the nightmare began. We ordered their beef empanadas and onion rings, and both were just flat out bad. The onion rings had absolutely zero flavor, as though somebody had not seasoned the batter at all. The empanadas were stuffed with very low grade, almost mystery meat quality cubed beef and a nasty curry sauce that just had an off taste to it. There was nothing remotely authentic about it, and it seemed like whoever created the dish had no palate whatsoever. Extremely dissappointing.

The one thing that ended up bothering us was how quickly they brought out our food following serving us our appetizers. I understand they were trying to provide fast, efficient service but this was pushing it. We ended up needing to ask for boxes for our remaining appetizers, about half of which were unfinished because there was just no more room at the table with how much they brought out.

I ordered the key west shrimp and grits, and it wasn&#39;t all that good. The food itself was bland, and the only redeemable quality about the dish was the cheesy grits which was considered as a side. You know there&#39;s a huge problem when the redeeming quality of a dish is not the protein itself. The shrimp were just not all that fresh, soaked in a weird lemon butter sauce and the green beans were completely bland, as though they had been cooked in water that had not been salted. None of the flavors went together all that well. My fellow dining companions just barely picked at their food, noting the lack of quality and flavor. As it turns out, I was right about the freshness of the shrimp since I got sick and threw up later that night.

All in all, we walked away paying 220 dollars with tax and tip for a 4 person dinner, which seemed like an astronomical price given the quality of food we were served. Had the food been of a higher quality, the price would have been justified, but it simply wasn&#39;t.

bahama-breeze-schaumburg,Samantha J.,zGKa70vyy_rC8Uz4FYamYA,jGDuRw3oT0gzvQy4cIrRLA,"I must say as a long time employee of the business this restaurant is a horrible excuse for an eating establishment!

Not only were my fiance and I ignored as we walked in the door then we had to experience the unprofessional attitudes and habits of the staff (and good thing we did!) 

It took the bartender almost ten minutes to realize we were there. Then we had to ask to have drinks and menus given to us! As if we would just go away after a while! Then after ordering we watched several employees standing openly on their phones......customer services means nothing right? 

Then to top it all off we saw employees trying drinks! Mind you I have done this in my career but with a straw and hygienic means! This employee dipped their finger into the frozen drink not once but twice! Then a second employee did the same thing! Sad thing is the bartender watched all of this and wondered why I wouldnt finish the drink I was made.....

Then we were pushed out because we were enjoying our time out (which rarely ever happens with our schedules) but the bartender had already closed up so we &#34;needed to go&#34; as we spotted an employee eating off a  guest&#39;s plate.

Needless to say unless you want to go to a restaurant where the staff tries your food and drinks before you I would never step foot in this establishment again!

Those words were spoken by my BFF who actually introduced me to Bahama Breeze a few years ago. 

Bahama Breeze is like a tropical vacation in the suburbs of Schaumburg (where literally every restaurant known to man exists). When you walk in you feel like you are in the balmy tropics- there are palm trees, a huge fire pit, and even live music playing Bob Marley. The only thing missing are tropical birds, a waterfall, and hot shirtless Island men haha

The food is all &#34;tropic&#34; themed and range from coconut shrimp to truffle yuca fries to meats that are garnished in mangoes, pineapples and other tropical fruits. I had the West Indies curry dish and it was sweeter than most curries but tasty nonetheless. My friend had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pasta and loved it!
Dessert was amazing- we had the Banana Supreme which is banana-nut bread with brandy sauce a la mode- perfection!

Our sever was fantastic! I think his name was Steven... He actually drew  island scenes on our to-go containers (complete with bird/sharks) and we got to take home our own unique works of art! The water was constantly filled and I even ordered a mango milk shake which is a unique twist on a classic malt!

The bathrooms are pretty big and the stalls remind you of being in the tropics- however the hooks are kind of high up (&#34;who do they think we are, giants?&#34;- My BFF who is 5&#39;3&#34;). There are several areas to dine in (near the fire pit), (inside under this wooden tent), and (in the center of the restaurant). 

Minus one star because it was kind of dark, we didn&#39;t get to sit at a booth, and there was a long wait where the host didn&#39;t really smile-maybe he dropped his pina colada!",14/01/14,212,4,1,5,7,5.402200000000001,3.8120000000000003,0.46299999999999997,12.724999999999998,No,1779

Not only were my fiance and I ignored as we walked in the door then we had to experience the unprofessional attitudes and habits of the staff (and good thing we did!) 

It took the bartender almost ten minutes to realize we were there. Then we had to ask to have drinks and menus given to us! As if we would just go away after a while! Then after ordering we watched several employees standing openly on their phones......customer services means nothing right? 

Then to top it all off we saw employees trying drinks! Mind you I have done this in my career but with a straw and hygienic means! This employee dipped their finger into the frozen drink not once but twice! Then a second employee did the same thing! Sad thing is the bartender watched all of this and wondered why I wouldnt finish the drink I was made.....

Then we were pushed out because we were enjoying our time out (which rarely ever happens with our schedules) but the bartender had already closed up so we &#34;needed to go&#34; as we spotted an employee eating off a  guest&#39;s plate.

Needless to say unless you want to go to a restaurant where the staff tries your food and drinks before you I would never step foot in this establishment again!

Those words were spoken by my BFF who actually introduced me to Bahama Breeze a few years ago. 

Bahama Breeze is like a tropical vacation in the suburbs of Schaumburg (where literally every restaurant known to man exists). When you walk in you feel like you are in the balmy tropics- there are palm trees, a huge fire pit, and even live music playing Bob Marley. The only thing missing are tropical birds, a waterfall, and hot shirtless Island men haha

The food is all &#34;tropic&#34; themed and range from coconut shrimp to truffle yuca fries to meats that are garnished in mangoes, pineapples and other tropical fruits. I had the West Indies curry dish and it was sweeter than most curries but tasty nonetheless. My friend had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pasta and loved it!
Dessert was amazing- we had the Banana Supreme which is banana-nut bread with brandy sauce a la mode- perfection!

Our sever was fantastic! I think his name was Steven... He actually drew  island scenes on our to-go containers (complete with bird/sharks) and we got to take home our own unique works of art! The water was constantly filled and I even ordered a mango milk shake which is a unique twist on a classic malt!

The bathrooms are pretty big and the stalls remind you of being in the tropics- however the hooks are kind of high up (&#34;who do they think we are, giants?&#34;- My BFF who is 5&#39;3&#34;). There are several areas to dine in (near the fire pit), (inside under this wooden tent), and (in the center of the restaurant). 

Minus one star because it was kind of dark, we didn&#39;t get to sit at a booth, and there was a long wait where the host didn&#39;t really smile-maybe he dropped his pina colada!",14/01/14,212,4,1,5,7,5.402200000000001,3.8120000000000003,0.46299999999999997,12.724999999999998,No,1779

bahama-breeze-schaumburg,Jennifer P.,bDXSrl19qIe0Hb-cZcCJ5A,WXiaubDUGsSo4rpITHRUKA,"A high school friend of mine came back home to visit for Christmas and we made a lunch date.  I suggested a local African place (since I&#39;ve had one bookmarked for a while and, well, he swears he&#39;s a black woman), but he laughed at me and suggested Bahama Breeze.  I checked out their menu and was pleasantly surprised to see several vegetarian and fish options, so was all-in!

There are a few different spacious seating areas in the front which is good if you&#39;re waiting for your party.  It was pretty slow, as there were 3 greeters/hosts behind the desk when we arrived.

The decor is a bit obnoxious and very open.  It somewhat reminds me of Joe&#39;s Crab Shack but larger and obviously more tropical.  It&#39;s...interesting.  They were playing this bizarre Christmas mix that included some some songs in Spanish.  I wonder if their regular tunes are Jimmy Buffet-esque. 

Our server was none other than Rick James (I HAD to ask if that was his real name).  He was kind of funny, referring to me as &#34;The Boss&#34; several times.  Clearly that was his sctick, as he did that to the adjoining table.  He was very attentive, though - filling up our water glasses several times over and checking on us.

We both got the lunch specials ($8): High School Buddy got the Pulled Pork sandwiches with the Seafood Chowder and a side of fries (+$2).  After asking Rick James for his recommendation between the Fish Tacos (which another reviewer stated were bland) and the Lobster Quesadillas, I settled on the Tacos with the Black Bean soup.

The soup was surprisingly delicious - not salty nor bland like other places.  I could have eaten a whole bowl of it!  The fish tacos were, indeed, pretty bland.  The fish was generously sized and cooked well, but could have used some seasoning (salt!) as it was cooked.  It tasted like it was steamed with only water.  The guacamole also left much to be desired, as the avocados were not ripe. 

Still, our tab (before tip) was $20.  Not too shabby! We walked out feeling satisfied.

I&#39;ve got my eye on the Portobello Mushroom Burger, so I&#39;ll definitely need to make a return trip!",24/12/13,253,4,1,5,-29,6.2593,3.6060000000000003,0.584,22.811,No,2141

Today, I started with a margarita flight. It came with 3 mini margaritas: grilled pineapple, hibiscus, and key lime pie. The grilled pineapple tasted like butane. The key lime pie was the only excellent one, it tasted like desert. Our waiter was fleetingly available. To start off with, we got the chicken quesadillas. Pretty good way to start off. It comes with pico de gallo and sour cream. For dinner, I ordered the Cuban sandwich and Bahaminian seafood chowder. Both were delicious. The Cuban sandwich is a mix of meat, cheese, and pickles. It always tastes a little better with mustard. I loved every bite of the soup. My spouse got some type of salad covered with fruit. It was very fresh. The manager came by to ask us if our food was okay but started walking away before he could have even heard us reply.

Upon arriving, the place looked packed.  We had called ahead of time to see if they took reservations-which we learned, they don&#39;t.  However, on the phone, the host said he could put our name on a list and reduce our wait.  So when we checked in, the host said it&#39;d be a half-hour wait, and he gave us that little pager thing.

bahama-breeze-schaumburg,Jennifer P.,bDXSrl19qIe0Hb-cZcCJ5A,WXiaubDUGsSo4rpITHRUKA,"A high school friend of mine came back home to visit for Christmas and we made a lunch date.  I suggested a local African place (since I&#39;ve had one bookmarked for a while and, well, he swears he&#39;s a black woman), but he laughed at me and suggested Bahama Breeze.  I checked out their menu and was pleasantly surprised to see several vegetarian and fish options, so was all-in!

There are a few different spacious seating areas in the front which is good if you&#39;re waiting for your party.  It was pretty slow, as there were 3 greeters/hosts behind the desk when we arrived.

The decor is a bit obnoxious and very open.  It somewhat reminds me of Joe&#39;s Crab Shack but larger and obviously more tropical.  It&#39;s...interesting.  They were playing this bizarre Christmas mix that included some some songs in Spanish.  I wonder if their regular tunes are Jimmy Buffet-esque. 

Our server was none other than Rick James (I HAD to ask if that was his real name).  He was kind of funny, referring to me as &#34;The Boss&#34; several times.  Clearly that was his sctick, as he did that to the adjoining table.  He was very attentive, though - filling up our water glasses several times over and checking on us.

We both got the lunch specials ($8): High School Buddy got the Pulled Pork sandwiches with the Seafood Chowder and a side of fries (+$2).  After asking Rick James for his recommendation between the Fish Tacos (which another reviewer stated were bland) and the Lobster Quesadillas, I settled on the Tacos with the Black Bean soup.

The soup was surprisingly delicious - not salty nor bland like other places.  I could have eaten a whole bowl of it!  The fish tacos were, indeed, pretty bland.  The fish was generously sized and cooked well, but could have used some seasoning (salt!) as it was cooked.  It tasted like it was steamed with only water.  The guacamole also left much to be desired, as the avocados were not ripe. 

Still, our tab (before tip) was $20.  Not too shabby! We walked out feeling satisfied.

I&#39;ve got my eye on the Portobello Mushroom Burger, so I&#39;ll definitely need to make a return trip!",24/12/13,253,4,1,5,-29,6.2593,3.6060000000000003,0.584,22.811,No,2141

Today, I started with a margarita flight. It came with 3 mini margaritas: grilled pineapple, hibiscus, and key lime pie. The grilled pineapple tasted like butane. The key lime pie was the only excellent one, it tasted like desert. Our waiter was fleetingly available. To start off with, we got the chicken quesadillas. Pretty good way to start off. It comes with pico de gallo and sour cream. For dinner, I ordered the Cuban sandwich and Bahaminian seafood chowder. Both were delicious. The Cuban sandwich is a mix of meat, cheese, and pickles. It always tastes a little better with mustard. I loved every bite of the soup. My spouse got some type of salad covered with fruit. It was very fresh. The manager came by to ask us if our food was okay but started walking away before he could have even heard us reply. The place can be a little pricey, it cost $50 for one drink flight, one app, one salad, and one sandwich with a side of soup. The music was good.

Our server had a big party of 10-12 people, and I, being a server, kind of tried to say he was just busier with them. Big parties can be a lot to handle at times and I understand that. 
It took him about 20 minutes after our melted drinks to even come ask if we were ready to order. The table that got seated a few minutes after us had already gotten their food.

Upon arriving, the place looked packed.  We had called ahead of time to see if they took reservations-which we learned, they don&#39;t.  However, on the phone, the host said he could put our name on a list and reduce our wait.  So when we checked in, the host said it&#39;d be a half-hour wait, and he gave us that little pager thing.  Then we headed to the bar for some of those really delicious-looking fancy cocktails.  Had some of those, they were fine.  But then we waited, and waited, and waited for our table.  About an hour and a half later--success!  We could finally sit down.

Our meals were good, nothing to write home about.  My meal came out a little lukewarm, so that was interesting.  But the most interesting part?

It was a Saturday late afternoon, a warm and breezy fall day in Schaumburg.  We were seated right away and had a wonderful server.  She was quite friendly and attentive.

I love Cuban sandwiches.  When I saw they had one on their new menu, I was sold. We started out with the white bean hummus with fresh vegetables.  My son had the Seafood Paella, my wife and daughter had salads.

First off, the hummus was pretty disappointing.  If you ever had a night in college when you drank beer and had Lays Bean Dip with chips, that was what the hummus tasted like.  Definitely and dish not to order in the future.

The Cuban Sandwich was okay - certainly not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but certainly not the worst either.  The beans and rice I ordered with it were excellent however,  They serve black beans and a yellow rice. Very fresh and tasty and just a little spicy.

Everyone else raved about their meals.  There was a grilled chicken and a grille salmon salad, both were excellent.  The paella was also quite good.

So, overall it was okay.  Bahama Breeze is great for two things - warm days when they open the windows and a you get a nice warm breeze through the restaurant, and those cold days when the windows are shut but you are lucky enough to get a seat on the patio where they have a warm fireplace and live music.

So, stay away from the hummus and you&#39;ll enjoy your experience.",30/09/12,181,3,2,5,24,7.471900000000001,4.677,0.36500000000000005,15.957999999999998,No,1571

I sat with friends where live music was being played. The performer (Kenny Kipp) was very good, covering songs from Train to Stephen Bishop, switching up from keyboards, guitar and his trusty uke. Good stuff.

I ordered the shrimp creole. The chorizo sausage gave a nice zesty accent to this dish and there was a decent amount of shrimp.

That&#39;s always a good thing. This is the most packed I&#39;ve seen a restaurant. We had a half an hour wait and the person gave us a buzzer when it would be our turn. So we headed to the bar when we saw a seat empty to go grab a drink while we waited. It took about ten mins to wait for the bad seat to get empty etc. it was so hectic behind the bar! They were running around everywhere and making people&#39;s drinks. We waited about ten mins before the guy got our drink order. The bar area seemed very congested or less people should&#39;ve been there. You could also grab a seat at the bar and eat there if you didn&#39;t want to wait for a table. So then it was also congested because people bringing out food to people who were sitting at the bar. So that&#39;s that. Drink menu was great! It went with the Bahama breeze name and atmosphere. My husband was saying he wished there were surf boards and stuff there to set that island atmosphere. Anyway, we got our table after half hour and we got seated right in front of the live singer in the second part of the restaurant! Definitely put us back into the island mood. We ordered the coconut shrimp for appetizer which was great. Shrimp was meaty and big. I ordered the shrimp and crab linguine for my entree. Where the seafood aspect was good but for $20 I would expect to have some flavor in my food. Anything salt, seasoning SOMETHING! It was creamy but literally had no taste. I think I make better pasta at home. We will come back eventually and I shall order something different.

I got the coconut shrimp and my fiance got one of the burgers. The coconut shrimp did not taste good at all and the brocolli and rice that came with it had absolutely no flavor in it at all.

First time I&#39;ve ever been there and it was a party of 16 at first. I guess I can imagine that that is such a large party, however they were just serving a WEDDING. 

Anyways, we were ordering something to drink and I did not know what I wanted to drink after my first option was declined because they couldn&#39;t make it virgin(totally understandable).. well then the waiter totally forgets about me and goes to place everyone&#39;s order. I was a little offended at this point... but I brushed it off and decided to order one when he gets back

Well... he never came back. However, we had 2 more people join our party and the waiter comes running back with everyone&#39;s drink and takes THEIR order and saying &#34;oh I noticed you just came in, what can I get you?&#34; 

ARE YOU KIDDING ME??

At this point I&#39;m completely ticked off and ready to start screaming because I&#39;m not getting noticed at all.. My boyfriend started to say something and the guy finally took my order for a drink. 

It gets way way worse. 

We start to order our food and some of us in the party just wanted appetizers because it was half off at 9pm for happy hour. Well we wanted to order at 8:57pm and our waiter says &#34;oh no it has to be 9 in order to take those.&#34; Walks away...Are you telling me you can&#39;t take at least 7 people&#39;s orders and wait for it to be 9?

So it takes about 20 minutes for us all to get our food and when they call the chicken tortilla soup my boyfriend put his hand up and called to them it was at this end of the table. And no surprise they ignore him. 
At this point I was balling my eyes out from the frustration I had. And they still had the nerve to come up to me and ask me if I wanted desert... WELL NOT IF YOU&#39;RE JUST GOING TO IGNORE THE CRAP OUT OF ME AND PROBABLY DROP IT OFF TO THE WRONG TABLE. 

No one was able to get a receipt back either. That took about an extra hour... and they messed up the receipts by putting the wrong orders on everyone&#39;s receipt and changing everyone more. 

Every employee there was trying so hard to defend our server and say it&#39;s hard to be a server of 18 people... well why work in an industry like that if you can&#39;t handle the pressure? Or why not check up on everyone to make sure you didn&#39;t mess anything up or just check on everyone to see if they&#39;re ok? Nothing of that happened this night. 

So I did what everyone else would do and called a manager and told him how awful my experience was while crying my eyes out. He gave me a gift card for like $25, but i will never go back there.

The fish tacos are excellent, I&#39;ve ordered a few times and it&#39;s consistent. There is a grilled salmon salad with a great dressing but this dish has not been consistent. The most recent time I ordered it, the salad was not spring mix, just regular romaine. It was just not a great march. It comes with some kind of bread crisp that&#39;s pretty good. 

Bahama mama drink is always worth it. The best time to come is when they have live music, great for a date night.

It was Father&#39;s Day and i figured why not. I wanted to try out a new place with my Family. It was 2 hours before closing time and it was a slow night. 

When you arrive, the place is stunning. It is very well decorated and you forget where you are. I felt like i was in Miami. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great. 

We were tended to almost right away. My daughter ordered the jerk chicken and a lemonade, i ordered the grilled chicken and a margarita. My wife ordered the salad. We were excited cause we loved the place and atmosphere. 

And thats were the excitement stopped. 

The lemonade and Margarita took 20 minutes after we ordered. My margarita was not good. It tasted very sour and the tequila tasted like it was a cheap brand. 

I requested to have my margarita to be made again. When i received it the second time it tasted like they recycled my drink and added more mix. My waitress asked me how was my replacement drink and i told her it was ok. Not happy with it, but ok. I ended up not drinking it. 

The waitress brought drinks and food to our table on two occasions that was not for us. 

By this point, 45 minutes had passed. My family and I waited another 30 minutes and no food in sight. I noticed 3 tables sit down 20 minutes after i arrived being served their food and leaving. 

After 1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting, we had enough. We were so disappointed because we loved the atmosphere and it was fathers day. We decided to get up and leave. I asked the waitress for our bill to pay for the drinks. She apologized and said not to worry about it. 

Based on other peoples reviews, we will try it again in the future, but we were very disappointed this time. I hope they get it together, its such a nice place.",15/06/14,192,1,1,4,0,3.7396999999999996,3.822,1.8050000000000002,24.373999999999995,No,1858

When we visited on a Sunday afternoon, it was busy and stayed that way until closing time.  Even though they were packed to the gills, the service was attentive and timely.  My husband had the chicken fried steak, which came with three eggs, cooked to order, and hash browns.  I had a small stack of pecan pancakes, and we ordered the &#34;small&#34; biscuits and gravy to share.  The portions were generous, the food was simple and tasty, and the value is excellent.  

I would love to see this place switch to making their sausage gravy from scratch, and it should have more sausage.  It seemed to have been a pre-made concoction, and the little bit of sausage was bland.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was still worth the calories, but I am a bit of a biscuit/gravy snob.  My only other gripe is that I have not been able to find any place in the Fox Valley that will cook an over easy or poached egg properly (at any price point, but it is much more forgivable at Golden Skillet prices).

We moved to St Charles 18 months ago, and have been on a hunt for new favorite restaurants.  We have been sorely disappointed until now.  I would much rather have good old-fashioned food at the Golden Skillet, than to pay three times as much for food that is pretentious and falls way short of its hype.

golden-skillet-elgin,Chris J.,#NAME?,eoECE9lAMLmwBO5KQBK_ww,"The smallish storefront space and low-key appearance do not do justice to Golden Skillet&#39;s charm as a nice neighborhood restaurant with tasty food and welcoming service. Though they do not offer much in the &#34;dinner&#34; category, they are a sure-fire place to get a fantastic breakfast, or a sandwich &#39;n&#39; soup if you&#39;re in a lunch mood. My wife and I frequent GS because of their good food and terrific prices.

Servers are always attentive (we rarely see the bottom of our coffee cups until we throw in the towel) and friendly, and we always feel like they appreciate our business. 

Though we generally stick with the same few items (yes, we can be a bit boring in our menu choices), they are consistently delicious. My wife likes her eggs criminally well done, so we have had to send her eggs back a couple times - I&#39;m sure because the cook recognizes the injustice he is being asked to commit :) . However, the staff always seem eager to correct what is not really a mistake on their part, simply an underestimation of my wife&#39;s egg-related depravity. I better hope that she doesn&#39;t read this....

For breakfast, I usually go for an omelet, while my wife loves the chorizo and eggs - she&#39;s Mexican, so if she says it&#39;s good, it&#39;s good! For lunch, our mutual favorite is hands down the Chicken Philly sandwich with a cup of the soup of the day. Be sure to check out their daily specials on the wall as well!

Pretty much just looked up the closest breakfast place, and Golden Skillet came up, with good reviews, so we decided to check it out. It&#39;s in a residential area and located in a little strip mall. The place isn&#39;t fancy or new - but it definitely has a certain charm. It&#39;s small, and it was busy, but we got a table right away. We were greeted instantly and got offered something to drink while we looked over the menu. I ended up ordering the &#34;eye opener&#34; skillet - a massive serving of 3 eggs, hash browns, corned beef hash, cheese, peppers and onions all in a skillet, with toast on the side (could have gotten pancakes instead, and regretted that decision immediately when I saw how good they looked).

Though it was a bit off the beaten track (about 5 miles from I-90), it was well worth the trek. The restaurant is located in a small strip mall, and stepping in the door was like stepping back into the 60&#39;s. We were greeted as we walked in, and our friendly waitress understood our need for a rest room before we could sit down for lunch. I chose a BLT Club, which came with soup (DELECTIBLE homemade pea soup) or salad (can&#39;t speak to that). Jerry chose a meat loaf sandwich with potatoes and gravy. We both decided the soup alone was well worth the off-highway trek, but we were both impressed with our meals. I don&#39;t get better food at home, and Jerry&#39;s a great cook. My BLT had fat slices of tomato and lots of crispy bacon, and it came with crispy, delicious fries. Jerry&#39;s meal was made up of two thick, piping hot slices of meat loaf (heated on the grill) and REAL mashed potatoes with a savory gravy. We were stuffed to the gills and happy as clams (pardon the aquatic acclaims). Looks like we&#39;ll only need a snack at dinner time.

Had a hot dog with fries and it just did not do it for me. The dog was average at best and the fries were just ugh. Tasted like old fries in old oil. Sad but true.

I found the price for a hot dog and fries at $3.79 before tax so high. Make it $4.17 with tax for a skinny dog with fries.

Service was friendly so that&#39;s a plus.

I couldnt pinpoint a flavor whether it was the meatballs beef or sauce but ot was damn good. The fries are absolutely awesome. It was a very heavy meal.

We had pre-ordered our food because we only have a 30 minute lunch, and I am happy to report the food came up right when we got there, so they did know how to time it correctly for our arrival time. 

I opted for a combo lunch that was listed in the menu we had at our office as $7.99. Evidently, we had an old menu because my price when I paid for my lunch was $9.60. I had 4 of my coworkers behind me and I was not about to question it because it probably was an old menu. Just paid and that was that. 

I received my order at the counter and it was my combo sandwich, well done sausage as requested. And the sausage was decent. Thank you, Bubby&#39;s for that. The Italian beef was not exactly a $9.00 sandwich if you know what I&#39;m saying. The meat was dry and a little chewy. :( The bread was fresh and &#34;wet&#34; as ordered. I am fully aware that it wasn&#39;t $9.00 for just the sandwich and the fries and drink were also included, but almost $10.00 for some very greasy fries, a fountain drink and an okay sandwich kinda broke my heart.

All of my coworkers ordered combos and I saw how much waste there was at the end of the meal. Not one person finished their fries and some not even their sandwiches or hot dogs. I later figured out that the fries were just too darn greasy for everyone, so they didn&#39;t eat them all. While they tasted pretty good, the grease was overwhelming. Kinda ruined them.

Lastly, the gentleman behind the counter offered to refill our sodas before we headed back to the office; SCORE!!! I figured out at the car that he had refilled my diet coke in my coworkers cup of iced tea and her iced tea in my cup of diet coke. Icky! This is not a combination of beverages I can work with. Perhaps Cherry coke and regular coke, but not tea and diet. :/

barones-pizza-and-restaurant-carpentersville,Peter T.,VP5wjC-QIeKvUv6_E-laBA,zkygDAYDpO2u9h6Ay12bYQ,"This may or may not be part of a small local chain;  there are a number of establishments in the Chicago suburbs with the same name, but no indication(s) online or elsewhere the joints are connected.

This particular location, in the far Northwestern suburb of Carpentersville, is located in a small strip mall, set well back from the nearby main drag (Illinois 25), and you&#39;re not likely to see it if you&#39;re not looking for it, or unless you&#39;re a regular. There are two sides to the business, a full boisterous bar with seating and service on the right, and a sedate, vinyl-table clothed restaurant on the left.

Judging from mentions of the restaurant on other sites, this place has been here at least 25 years. The restaurant does a booming take out and delivery business, with a very complete menu of dinners, sandwiches, pizza, and nightly specials. On a Thursday nite, at the dinner hour, the bar was packed and the dining room deserted.   Guess which I opted for?

Meals are served complete - with a complimentary bread basket, soup or salad.  The Thursday special was fried chicken, four good sized pieces on the plate, with a choice of fries, smash or baked.  The salad was ample, the soup Minestrone.

The thin crust pizza is priced 10-20 % less than other independents in the area, which surprised me, because Barone&#39;s really piles on the cheese (the equivalent of double at other pie shops), and used a hand-pulled, flavorful, Italian sausage in good sized pieces. The crust is typical of &#34;Chicago thin,&#34;  not cracker-like, but crispy and flaky at the same time. Sauce was flavorful without being overbearing. I like sliced green olives on my pizzas on occasion, and it seems like Barone&#39;s uses my favorite kind, a &#34;Sicilian style.&#34;

Service was perfunctory.  The menu states to allow 25 minutes for  pizza, so there&#39;s been no oven update in that kitchen in the past few decades.  But that&#39;s ok.  It was worth waiting for, and if I lived in the Chicago &#39;burbs, this would be my new go to place.",02/05/14,242,4,1,3,3,2.7398,1.3359999999999999,0.217,15.447000000000001,No,2054

johns-restaurant-and-tavern-winfield,Heidi K.,oz-Kfz_tDfPQE19CsZy_tg,#NAME?,"Not a bad place. Growing up in the area, my father would take us here a few times a month. Knowing it as &#34;John&#39;s Buffet&#34;, I will still continue to refer to it as such. Throughout the years, John&#39;s has remained consistent with both customer service and their food preparation, which is much appreciated in today&#39;s world of &#34;will this visit be as good as the last time?&#34; for many establishments. I can always count on John&#39;s to deliver great food, a comfortable atmosphere, and friendly servers.

As a tween and having a rather picky palate back then, I would only order their pizza soup. To this day, the pizza soup is as delicious as I remember it. It&#39;s a tomato soup with sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and pepperoni, and topped with mozzarella cheese. (You&#39;ll have to pick around the mushrooms, as it&#39;s pre-made). I definitely recommend this soup!

Most recently, I tried a cheese quesadilla with Italian beef, roasted red peppers and pepperoncini. Yep, you heard me; Italian beef on a quesadilla. Sounds odd, but it&#39;s fabulous! The only thing I wish they did differently is use only mozzarella for this type of quesadilla instead of the cheddar/mozzarella blend. M had the bacon cheeseburger quesadilla, which is equally as good. 

The Johnny Nachos with everything (chicken, steak, and chorizo) and Bruchetta are fabulous as well. Definitely want to try a &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34; burger (1/2 pound burger topped with cheddar cheese, bacon, fried egg, and finished with heavenly brown gravy) and the &#34;Burn Your Butt&#34; burger (1/2 pound burger topped with pepper cheese, a grilled jalapeno, and a dollop of salsa all on a garlic buttered bun, with chipotle mayo) someday. A friend ordered the Stairway to Heaven burger once and we jokingly asked him what he wanted his tombstone to say. It looked so good but it also made my arteries cry just from looking at it.

On nice days, it&#39;s enjoyable to eat out on the patio, if you don&#39;t mind all the train traffic. Growing up in Wheaton and living near the train tracks, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve grown used to and can easily tune them out. On the inside, there is ample seating and a cozy bar and a great beer menu. Their website lists an &#34;On Deck&#34; section of brews coming soon; make sure you follow them to receive notifications of when they are available. The Bloody Marys are good (make sure you ask for it spicy, if you prefer). I wish they came in a pint glass, though.

John&#39;s has been around for almost 100 years now, and I&#39;m glad to see this little gem still doing so well in downtown Winfield. If you&#39;re in the area, I definitely recommend you stop on by.",06/07/14,325,4,3,5,65,11.135299999999999,6.197,0.662,21.141,No,2705

johns-restaurant-and-tavern-winfield,Karen T.,D6dCi7XXzK4ZxYyL5eag4w,PTb7GnYzk3vkocVoQ0oO7A,"Ate here last night. The meal was an overall disaster.

The dinner salad was puny, mostly white-ish iceberg lettuce, and served with a tiny cup of watered down blue cheese dressing. No bread was offered. 

My salmon was dreadfully overcooked. The outside was dry, the inside was on the verge of dry. The baked potato was puny and had black spots. The vegetables were overcooked and I think boiled. 

I told the waitress about the salmon, and she apologized but did nothing about it. My dinner companion went to the manager and asked for some consideration. They took half off the cost of the salmon dinner. I probably should&#39;ve gone up there myself, because I would not have settled for anything other than a free meal... Although I would hardly call it a meal because I took the potato and salmon home to feed my dog. 

To top it off I had ordered a piece of their supposedly special banana cream pie. It was also puny, the crust was soggy, the bananas were brown and it lacked flavor.

And if that wasn&#39;t enough the place is loud, noise reverberates, and it had a very musty smell last night. I think this will be my last visit. 

I will add a sidenote. Our waitress said she was not old enough to drink so could give me no advice regarding a choice of beer. I did ask for a particular brand on the menu, and she said &#34;oh we just ran out of that yesterday.&#34; However she was the one who brought our beverages to our table.

I love their outside patio.  Nicely done and I like hearing and seeing the freight and Metra trains pass through.

Great beer selection and their wine choices are not shabby either.  On certain nights they have 1/2 off their premium wines.  They also have live music some nights and beer and food pairing events too.

Thursday, July 17, 2014 stopped in with three friends for a quick bite. We got seated quickly in the outdoor garden. Place was not packed. We waited a least 10mins for waitress to come to our table. We all ordered sandwiches, easy. One also ordered hot wings with his sandwich. The hot wings came out in reasonable time frame. The waitress set them down and left. we were to busy talking to notice that none of us had silverware. After waiting over 5 mins I went inside and asked for place setting from another waitress. 

It has now been over 20mins since we ordered our food. I ask another waitress if she can check on our order and get out waitress. It was another 5mins and finally our waitress come to our table. I advised her we have been waiting over 45mins for our food. She apologized and tried to stress that they are having a big party that is taking a lot of her time. I had to keep my composure, but replied that it has nothing to do with our order. I then asked her to just cancel our orders and we were gonna leave. She left and returned within 1 min. she advised us that our food was ready and would be out in a few mins. We informed her to make them to go. Another 5mins goes buy and she returns with our to go bags. Now were all stemming. What horrible non customer service we received. 

We followed the waitress inside by the serving station. At that time I noticed a man that had a goatee, behind the bar staring at us. I asked him if he was the manager, he said he was. I then ask him was he just gonna stair at us behind the bar? or come over and talk to us regarding the ridiculous long wait. He states &#34;that he is gonna stay there behind the bar&#34; We advise him that he should be making contact with all of us for the horrible long time it took to get our food, they were just a few sandwiches and burgers. He then stated that they were busy with a party. We then told him that everyone in the facility was important. What a joke this useless non caring individuals way of handling the situation.  We were all pretty ticked...we paid our waitress and gave her an exceptional tip even though the service was a -10. NONE OF US WILL EVER COME BACK HERE.

(In comparison to the nachos you get &#39;across the street&#39; at Caliendo&#39;s - night and day&#39;s difference.  Unless you like simple small Tostito chips covered with your basic tasteless Gehl&#39;s cheese sauce).

You will not be disappointed.  Great ingredients, salsa, cheeses, and beef.  Also is not some HUGE plate of &#34;mostly chips&#34; (like you get at Fox and Hound and The Village, where the plate looks huge, but its mainly just one layer at the top that appears loaded, but 80% of the plate is just bare chips underneath).

I love these things.  The only place that ever came close to having as good of nachos was Wag&#39;s restaurant, and all the Wag&#39;s closed down in like 1992.

As I stated above, while I cannot obviously comment on their entire menu, I can vouch that their soups are all VERY GOOD, their burgers are pretty good, as is their steak.

Also is a full bar with a summer outdoor seating area.  VERY COOL PLACE!

Food here is everything from American to Italian and all is great.  The reuben is the best I have ever tasted and most likely the best in Illinois.  Burgers are great and portions on all meals is are medium to large.  Many of the meals come with sides and the sweet potato fries are the best.

There are 20+ beers on tap between the two bars and they range from Miller to Goose Island.  There are even more selections of beers that are bottled and seasonal selections are always good.  Mixed drinks are always great and the bartenders do a great job.

The layout of the bar/restaurant splits into two different sections.  There is the classic tavern with a triple horseshoe bar and then there is a restaurant and higher end bar in the same building.

During the season, when it isn&#39;t freezing, there is an outdoor patio section that has multiple tables and is great place to eat.  Service is fast and many of the servers are very knowledgeable about the menu.

We stopped in at CK Pad Thai on a rainy Friday night. It is located in a strip mall on Army Trail.

Came in, was greeted + seated and looked over the menu. Typical Thai menu items available. I always go with Green Curry with chicken which I can make a pretty good version of myself.
Also, Tom Yum soup as an item. I judge Thai restaurants on these two dishes. If they can&#39;t make these two basic Thai staples, they get crossed off my list.

The Tom Yum soup with shrimp was OK. Not the best I ever had but still enjoyable. The shrimp were fresh and tasty in the soup but the soup itself could have used more zip.
The Green Curry was very nice. The server asked about spice levels and I told him I like it spicy and it was. At first when eating it I did not think it was very spicy but upon continuing I felt the hair on the back of my head starting to sweat a bit. It creeped up on me and I loved it.

I originally asked them if they had ground pork &amp; they said no but they did have ground chicken.. the next best thing. I asked for exxxtraa spicy ground chicken with basil.. simple as that with no rice.
I must say the ground chicken basil was delicious, I wasn&#39;t expecting the huge cuts &amp; amounts of bell peppers &amp; onions because it watered it down. Overall the dish was spicy as I requested, I&#39;m happy. :)",07/09/15,91,5,2,5,24,4.534800000000001,3.099,0.355,6.547,No,820

He really should have been on roller skates because he just zipped all over the place and despite him being the lone server, service never suffered. 

The food was delicious. We tried the Crazy Noodles (wide noodles with veggies in a spicy sauce) Thai Fried Rice with Shrimp, Green Curry with Chicken and a plate of the Mini Egg Rolls. Everything was so well-made and tasty.  The spicy dishes had a nice heat, but the heat didn&#39;t overpower the flavor.  The Curry was really good and I&#39;m usually not a huge fan of Thai Curry.  The coconut milk in the curry was just enough to make it creamy and add sweetness without overpowering the curry flavor. My only gripe about the dishes was size of the veggies in the Crazy Noodles and Green Curry--the peppers and bamboo shoots were huge.  Could have used a little more chop down, but at least they were cooked perfectly and not overdone. The portions were a nice size and we had leftovers for lunch the next day.

Typical service from a Thai restaurant.  Fast.  Efficient.  Friendlier than most.

The food made me sad.  Sad because I think I might have to ditch my favorite Thai place in the burbs (Thai Zie-try it!) for CK.

I have been to many Thai restaurants around the Chicagoland area, but I have not been as happy with them as I have with CK Pad Thai. I&#39;ve tried Mama Thai, Star of Siam, and others. The food at CK Pad Thai is most excellent compared to other restaurants. You would never suspect the quality of food from the strip-mall storefront. 

I ordered Panang Curry. The peppers were cooked just right, to where they were still crispy but not raw-crunchy. The tofu was not mushy and was fried around the edges to where the pieces had a nice tenderness. The curry itself was very flavorful, and they used just the right amount of spice!

The service was also very good. The waiter was friendly, personable, and attentive. We never had empty drinks, and he checked to make sure we were enjoying everything. I feel that service like this is hard to find amongst similiar restaurants.

The beauty of CK Pad Thai is its consistency. Everything is prepared almost exactly the same every time (please, there is no such thing as 100% exactitude with restaurants, but you can come close). Here are my conclusive results, after twice-monthly delivery service since August 2012:

- Pad thai: Insipid and watery
- Egg rolls: Unremarkable
- Chicken egg rolls: An astounding improvement ... no idea why. The sweet and sour sauce is awesome.
- Green curry with chicken: Flavorful and abundant with vegetables but too soupy. However, I have successfully remedied the texture by making a cornstarch slurry and stirring it into the curry while I reheat it.
- Panang curry with tofu: Same as above. 
- Beef and meatball noodle soup: The beef is too gristly so now I get it with just meatballs, those eerie and yummy spheres of beef paste and potato starch. I also request extra bean sprouts, basil and cilantro to make the whole dish resemble pho as closely as possible. 
- Chicken fried rice: Really delicious, maintaining that balance of sweet and salty so prevalent in Southeast Asian cuisine, and featuring big, tender chunks of gristle-free chicken breast. Whatever sauce they use, I want gallons of it.

Needing to find a place for my cousin and I to meet, I did some research on some of the local joints. Based on other yelp reviews, I thought I would CK a try and I am glad we did! 

The actual restaurant is a little easy to miss. Tucked away in a strip mall, it seems quite underwhelming from the outside. Entering the restaurant, I was immediately greeted. The decor was cute and charming. The restaurant is on the small side, but that was okay as  we were the only patrons eating in. 

The food was fantastic. I ordered the green curry. I requested that it be extra spicy as I find that most Thai places go easy on us Americans. The curry was terrific. Very spicy as requested, but the right balance. I could still taste the amazing flavors of the coconut milk and fresh vegetables (eggplant, bamboo shoot, basil, etc.) I  was very pleased at how fresh the vegetables were!

My cousin ordered the spicy crazy noodle dish. Although I didn&#39;t have any, my cousin was raving about and has begging me to take him back for more. Did I mention, this was his first Thai experience? He loved it! His meal did look quite good!

CK Pad Thai is small and not terribly noteworthy on the inside, but they whip up the food extremely quickly and the employees are friendly.  I ordered the Crazy Noodle extra spicy and they did quite a good job at this (even including an extra side of chili sauce... yay!).  The vegetables were so perfect -- red peppers still crisp, sweet onions still sweet.  It didn&#39;t quite rip my face off, but it wasn&#39;t the Minnesota-hot that I&#39;m used to getting stuck with back home.  The sauce itself was a bit on the greasy side but at least the food wasn&#39;t swimming in it.

The decor is also well-done; very clean and homey, but nice enough that you could probably take a date here. You wouldn&#39;t expect something of this quality considering CK Pad Thai is in a grungy 1970s strip mall with a Jiffy Lube and a dentist.

Anyway, we first stopped at jc&#39;s in Bartlett to find them closed.  Then we went to villaggios in roselle... To also find them closed.  At this point we were hungry and cranky so we headed to spavones. At least they were open!


The decor reminded me of an 1980&#39;s banquet hall. There was a decent crowd, but a banquet was also going on in the next room. 

Our waitress seemed frazzled.  Most questions we asked were answered with an I don&#39;t know.  My husband asked what the widest noodle he could get and she literally had no clue.  Hmm...

So we ordered our entrees, and two drinks. I was happy with my gluten free pasta, but it wasn&#39;t anything special. I guess for the 19.95 price tag, I was hoping to at least get a salad.  Nothing came with the meals except bread rolls.  They smelled delicious and it stank sitting there with my mouth salvating while my other two family members ate. 

Overall, the meal was fine. Nothing special though. I would love if they threw in a salad or soup with the meal. I would be more willing to go back.  But an 80 dollar bill before tip seemed like an awful lot to me.",06/12/15,153,3,1,2,-10,1.4464000000000001,2.087,1.312,18.601,No,1269

I know in other reviews Yelpers say its outdated, but I think it&#39;s a nice welcome of something different. I dined on a Thursday night and the place was basically dead, which concerned me until I got my food. The only down side was that I don&#39;t drink or eat items cooked with alcohol,  and virtually everything on the menu had wine of some sort in it so I had to order wisely. 
Everything we ordered was extremely fresh and authentic. I had a filet, and my boyfriend had some crazy trio of things I could not pronounce. Everything was simply delicious. My filet was cooked perfectly, and the lemon butter sauce it came with was awesome.

The interior looks outdated and a little run down. Looks aren&#39;t everything, but it didn&#39;t feel very inviting. Unfortunately, both bathroom stalls were dirty, (details here will be spared), which was quite unpleasant.

Our waiter was sarcastic and made comments that were inappropriate. I understand he may have been trying to be funny, but using a condescending tone and making personal comments towards customers is neither funny nor acceptable. I won&#39;t elaborate on the remarks to save the tedium of reading a long review.

The food was ok. Grilled calamari lacked flavor, and all the food seemed to take quite a long time considering the small number of guests. The gravy on the veal reminded me of cafeteria gravy. I feel like the price was not at all relative to the quality (food and service) and flavor.

Positives- the bread served was good (as silly as that is to include). The veal itself without the gravy was tasty. Also, our bus boy was pleasant and attentive.

This menu hasn&#39;t changed since the 1980&#39;s because it is solid southern Italian food. The veal dishes are amazing, the Chicken Parm is worth the trip and Braciole is also great. My only negative comment is that sometimes garlic takes over some dishes. The house salad dressing is an example and so are the garlic rolls that start the meal. Oh well, they are garlic rolls.

There were two large parties celebrating birthdays and 80% of the tables were full by the time we left at 7:30.  Tony made everyone feel at home with his charm and his old Italian songs.

The food was great!  We shared appetizers of bruschetta and arincini which everyone loved.  I ordered the Meditereanean Sea Bass which was a special offering.  The fish was as good as any grilled fish I have had at Shaw&#39;s.  A whole grilled fish that was perfectly deboned table side by Kelly.   

My wife ordered the pasta with broccoli and shrimp which was prepared in an olio sauce.  She loved it.  They have a pretty good wine list that includes some interesting wines.  We didn&#39;t have any room for dessert because the portions are so large and it&#39;s hard to have just one.

Our server, Kelly was fantastic.  She was very professional and attentive.  Everything about Spavone&#39;s was spot on.  Food, service and atmosphere - we walked out with smiles on our faces.

As many other reviews have stated, the atmosphere is dated and boring, and the lighting is too bright and glaring.

I had to go ask the hostess to PLEASE send our server over, since no amount of arm waving could get her attention.  After finally ordering, we waited another 1/2 hour for the food to arrive...please!  how long does pasta take?  All three of our dinners were below average.  The prawn special came on top of spaghetti noodles with an enormous amount of raw garlic sliced all over it, yet surprisingly, had very little flavor.

Tony was nice enough to come to our table and chat with our family and talk about how my husband and his family have been coming here since they opened. Tony was singing Christmas songs and asked me if I had a favorite Christmas movie. Tony as well as my entire family laughed when I said ask the Jewish girl her favorite Christmas movie (I married into an Italian family). 

Our server was kind of weird and spoke in a very monotone voice but she did come up with great food. recommendations including ordering tiramisu with cannoli filling on the bottom.

Each time I come here I order something different and have to say they nothing I order here is bad. We ordered two appetizers to share of the calamari (I don&#39;t eat that) and their delicious bruschetta. The  bread is amazing and comes out warm with fresh garlic. The minestrone soup was delicious. I decided to order for my main course the chicken Parmesan. The portion size was huge with two giant chicken breasts. It was warm and delicious with the perfect amount of breading. cheese and sauce. I was so full I couldn&#39;t  even get to my side dish of angel hair pasta in meat sauce. I took the pasta home with me that is a portion large enough to have as a dinner the next night.  I had a bite of my husband&#39;s chicken Marsala and that tasted delicious as well. Everyone else at my table ordered the chicken Vesuvio which looked amazing. I&#39;ll have  to try that next time we dine here. Their tiramisu is the best I have had from any Italian restaurant. The husband and I shared it.

I would also like to say don&#39;t expect to be in and out of this restaurant fast. If you want five star authentic Italian dining you come here if not then I encourage you to go to a local &#34;chain&#34; Italian restaurant. The food is made fresh and hot.

tony-spavones-bloomingdale-2,Jameson G.,k4PgmFQkBsyqyaTUUmTCrw,74xN5oORzUDUjpy0lrRzkg,"When I was younger, I used to go here all the time with my parents.  It had been YEARS since I&#39;ve been there and my dad suggested it over another Italian restaurant. 

It was a Saturday evening at around 6pm and they were slammed! We had to wait 15 minutes.  I don&#39;t usually drive past it but when I would the parking lot would always be nearly empty, so I was shocked to see this much business.  

I believe several changes had been made to the food, ambiance and restaurant and it is now back to what it used to be.  Yes, I will say, for a suburban Italian restaurant it is a little pricey! BUT, I will also say that you will not find a better vodka sauce at any suburban Italian restaurants.  Everything is made to order, so you could expect your dinner to be around 2 hours or so.  

They start you off with garlic-butter rolls, delish! The baked clam appetizers were very good and our calamari was crispy and tender on the inside.  Our cocktails were strong, bonus points to the bartender.  I asked for my chicken parmagiana to come with vodka sauce and the waiter had no problem making the substitution.  The rest of our party enjoyed their meals, especially my dad and his veal dish.

The service was good, but a little spotty, I couldn&#39;t tell who our server was because a couple people kept switching off.  At any rate, the service was fine and fulfilled it&#39;s purpose. 

It&#39;s also dinner AND entertainment: Tony Spavone sings and takes requests!

First off, I want to say that I really wanted to like this place - I like supporting local businesses, instead of the chains..but, it was, by far the worst dining experience I have ever had..first off, the service was unbelievably slow...we sat down and then waited 45 minutes before the waiter took our drink order...he seemed a bit overwhelmed, and explained that he was new, so we told him we understood...then, it was another 30 minutes before he could take our appetizer order...the appetizers were mediocre, at best..nothing special.  About 30 minutes after we ordered our entrees, they finally arrived..three of us had ordered the gnocchi with Vodka Sauce, and it was not good at all..the sauce was very thick and an odd orange color, which prompted my friend to ask if it was Kraft macaroni and cheese.  The waiter continued to be frazzled, even after the room started to empty out...we tried to be patient, but when we ordered our desserts and coffee, and after 20 minutes still did not have them, I asked for the manager.  I explained what had happened and that I was very disappointed in the evening..he seemed surprised by my assessment, and said that the Vodka Sauce was very good, even after three of us had just told him it was not..I thought I was in the Twilight Zone at that point...I asked for the check and we canceled the desserts, since there was no indication they would be coming to our table any time in the near future...the manager kept asking that we come back another time when it wasn&#39;t so busy and it would be better...not sure how that could be guaranteed, since the food was not good...were they going to get the food from Olive Garden for my next visit?  But, he tried to make things right by comping the Kraft gnocchi and cheese, and gave me a gift certificate for a very generous amount, but even with that, I will not go back.  Then, the waiter actually came over to our table, and asked why we canceled our desserts!  Seriously?  

I went home and had leftover pizza, which was a better meal.  Having read the rave reviews here, I can only say that this must be the most schizophrenic dining establishment in all the Western Suburbs...the reviews here go from out of this world to what in the world?...that level of inconsistency is unacceptable in a restaurant",17/10/15,245,1,1,2,-8,1.4007,0.738,1.277,7.984,No,2378

A seafood fettuccine comes with minestrone soup and garlic roll.   The garlic roll was OK, I quite like it. The soup was so-so. No problem cause i care more about main course.  The pasta, OMG, HUGE PROBLEM. It&#39;s way too much sauce first of all, whole pasta was dipping in the white sauce, every single pasta has more than enough cheese/sauce sticking on it. I was like drinking a bottle of pasta sauce. More doesnt mean it would taste well. There were scallop and shrimp on top of the pasta, let me tell you, those were the worst shrimp and scallop I have ever had in my whole life. Seriously. They were hard as stones, not sure were they overcooked or what... I can easily find frozen shrimp and scallop in any grocery store that would taste way better.

We went on a Thursday night around 7:30, and the place was deserted. Upon walking in you first notice the giant wall with Tony posing with various celebrities over the years, very neat. We were warmly greeted and seated promptly. On the plus side, the service was very good; Kelly was great. The rolls included with the dinner were warm and tasty. We decided on an appetizer with dinner, and we weren&#39;t disappointed with the fried calamari. After that, everything went downhill quickly.

I ordered the Veal Siciliana, a layered veal and eggplant dish smothered in meat sauce, and a side of angel hair and meat sauce. The veal was a super-thin slice of meat, heavily breaded, reminding me of something out of a school cafeteria. The meat sauce was relatively tasteless, and the sin of all Italian food sins: the pasta was overcooked and mushy! The meal came with a choice of soup or salad. I chose the Minestrone soup and was taken aback by the excess salt. I would have rather eaten a can of Progresso, cold, served in the can...

My partner ordered the Chicken Cardinale, and having tried it myself, the dish was all around bland. It was basically a piece of breaded chicken, cheese, and tomato sauce (which tasted like it came out of a can.) He ordered the Pasta e fagiole soup, which was mostly beans, and the beans tasted like the cook opened a can of &#39;pork n&#39; beans&#39; and added that to their broth.

While Tony himself was friendly, and the service nice, the food left much to be desired. It looked to me like they&#39;re riding on reputation. A major improvement is needed in the kitchen before I make a return visit.",27/04/13,213,2,1,4,-11,3.8296,2.445,0.364,16.191,No,1814

I&#39;m serious!!!  And they were unapologetic about it. It took probably a half hour before we got our first round of drinks, then another 45 minutes to get the second.  45 minutes!!!  It wasn&#39;t until we said something to the hostess, until the waiter came over.  They were out of many things, I had to change my entire order, half the people at the table didn&#39;t get the pasta fagiole (special) that they ordered.. and when they brought out someone&#39;s steak and three small potato wedges instead of the baked potato he had ordered, they said &#34;Sorry sir, we&#39;ll bring more out later&#34;.. which they never did.  Food was mediocre, at BEST.  Mediocre is actually a compliment for that food.   Our waters were never once refilled, or offered desert, the list goes on.

This place has authentic Italian food and a very family oriented atmosphere.  Food is priced very reasonably. 

Some of my favorites: 
The garlic rolls (are to die for!)
Real homemade tasting calamari (not the pre-made junk you get everywhere)
The Vodka sauce (omg this is amazing on pretty much every pasta dish)
The gnocchi (especially with the vodka sauce)
The veal (best veal I have ever had at a restaurant- especially the lemon or parm)
The Specials [this place never fails to bring out new specials that make you want to try every single one!]
Tiramisu (regardless if you have room left in your stomach, you have to get this!)

Very quiet atmosphere for lunch

From what I hear they were extremely accommodating with everything in the planning aspects from the food menu to the space (we needed more room and they were able to section off the majority of the restaurant for the afternoon).  They allowed the hosts to bring homemade cookies/cannoli and lots of them! They were also able to switch out linens which really made things come together.

The menu consisted of salad, minestrone, bread, Italian style green beans,  pasta with vodka sauce, chicken vesuvio and lemon ice.

Mind you, I have been in the food industry for 6+ years. Ordered the rice ball appetizer, they came out still frozen. Sent them back, still cold in the middle. Thought, okay, they were busy I get it.  After and hour and a half the entr̩es come out. Mine and my boy friends moms entr̩e were cold in the middle. Sent thrm back,  came  back cold AGAIN. At this point im like wtf. I told the owner I woukd eat it because after over an hour and a half im starving, so I would eat the cold pasta. The taste was good I will say, same with the appetizers. The waiter was the worst. Very tall guy, cant remember his name. Never apologized, never asked us if we need anything, never refilled drinks, nothinnnggg. I dont usually complain,  but for being higher priced it was inexcusable.  I understand, it was busy, i understand shit happens. But to ignore us and it continue to be wrong, come on. We will NEVER be back. Also, the owners singing was like some kind of weird vegas review and made me uncomfortable.  A waitress sang who was very good.  Overall a terrible experience.  They ended up comping us 4 desserts, 2 drinks, and the 2 entr̩es. Should have comped the whole bill to ensure a return cisit.

I would&#39;ve given Spavone&#39;s four stars had they not been rude about their mistake because I&#39;ve been coming here for as long as I can recall.
Spavone&#39;s is a place that my family and I have frequented for a long time.  There&#39;s something really authentic about it..no frills, just traditional food and a lobby area littered with pictures of..idk I think Tony and Jim McMahon and other Chicagoland icons.
Unfortunately, most of our trips are after services at the nearby Salerno&#39;s funeral home.  Anyhow, the food is decent.  It&#39;s not the best Italian food I&#39;ve had, but the atmosphere is authentic and you can be sure to leave in a carb induced coma.  I think what I&#39;ve enjoyed most over the years is the consistency.  You know what to expect, Tony Spavone on the mic, pleasuring your eardrums with a little ditty.  It&#39;s actually hilarious.  
Also, the food is consistently good.  The Rotolo Primavera, is tasty, rich and fattening (although Zaza&#39;s in STC is better, sorry Tone).  The eggplant is also pretty decent (although V&amp;V in Bartlett is where it&#39;s at).  Their rolls are pretty damn delish though (but they&#39;re trumped by the Hideaway&#39;s).

My favorite dish is the Fettuccine Carbonara, much better than what I can get at the local Olive Garden. A must for me is to get olive oil and parmesan cheese, mix it together on a little plate and dip the rolls into the mixture.

They also have the only tiramisu I have ever liked, but that probably had something to do with the amount of brandy in it. I&#39;m not a big fan of coffee, but the brandy makes it all the better.

The waiter was extrememly attentive.  We used a $25 Restaurant.com gift certificate.  After seeing mixed reviews on Yelp, I was a bit skeptical, but knew it was a place my husband would probably like.  I was right!  I liked it too.  The decor was a bit dated, but nice regardless.  I don&#39;t expect every restaurant I walked in to to look like they just remodeled or just opened up.  It shows character, and I know that they must have been there for a while.  There were tons of pictures on the walls of Tony and his family.  I know it is definitely a family owned and family orientated restaurant, and I like that.  It&#39;s not the best place for kids, as there is nothing for them to do there but eat, but they are willing to half portions of their pastas, and accommodate a child.  We did not bring kids, but did inquire.  Tony sings there every night around 6:30 or 7:00.  I am sorry that we went as early as we did, because we missed Tony.  We will definitely be going back to eat again and hear Tony! 
Back to the waiter - very attentive, but not overly attentive.  He knew we wanted to enjoy our meal, and not be rushed.  We ordered shrimp cocktail - no fishy smell at all.  They were very fresh shrimp.  Then we went out for a smoke, and had our 2nd round of cocktails waiting for us when we got back in.  We ordered dinner, the salads came, and we ate those.  The waited informed us that we had time to sneak in one more smoke before dinner came.  I loved that he told us that, so we went for another smoke!  We came in and had dinner, and enjoyed every bit of it.  I have been looking for a mushroom risotto that was good, and they had it!  After dinner the waiter asked if we would like dessert, but declined and opted for another cocktail.  He gave them to us on the house for an anniversary gift.  I thought that was very cool.

Why I&#39;m giving SS 3 stars: the very first time I ordered a salad here, it was absolutely swimming in dressing...kind of like, &#34;Would you like some salad with your dressing?&#34; But OK, that is an easy enough fix -- now I am just always sure to ask for dressing on the side.

However, my main complaint is that every time I order a salad (and I&#39;ve tried a few different kinds) the salad always comes as 98% lettuce and very few other ingredients that are listed in the description of that particular salad on the menu. I always feel a little disappointed and like I just paid $8 for a huge bowl of spinach or romaine leaves. 

I just had lunch with my husband here the other day and thought I&#39;d give the Southwestern salad a shot.

My husband and I stopped by here one rainy night after his chiropractor session nearby and were kind of blown away by how unexpectedly cute and cozy Savory Salads was. Nice small tables, basic decor, very friendly employees, a small outdoor dining area for warmer days, and a mouth-watering menu. After staring at the menu forever and figuring out exactly what we wanted, we ordered a couple paninis with chips and salads. And I got a coffee; Intelligentsia, baby!

The paninis are HUGE.

So huge, in fact, that I could only eat half of my panini and had to save the other half PLUS my chips for lunch the next day. And it was still amazing! So satisfyingly scrumptous. Savory, indeed.

Also, their paninis are the reason that my husband and I decided we needed to get a panini-maker and make some awesome food at home (and I may or may not have bought one earlier today instead of waiting for Christmas..... oops?!).

The only thing this place has against them is the location. It&#39;s very easy to miss when you&#39;re driving by during rush hour traffic and all you see is a glimpse of the bright Subway sign next door (DO NOT go to Subway -- pay the extra couple bucks for the much better fare at Savory Salads). If it were downtown, it might get more attention. Or maybe not. Maybe this is just where Savory Salads needs to be.

This joint is what you get when you mix Mike Tyson and powerful, packed-to-the-point paninis. These babys will know you on your ass. 

I don&#39;t typically even think of salads and paninis, but when I do I usually think of delicate women or ladies who lunch. Most of you reading this probably don&#39;t know me, but I&#39;ve never been called delicate in my life- I came out of the womb a hardened, hungry hellion and I plan on staying that way. Before Savory Salads, you wouldn&#39;t find me within 50 yards of a salad during dinner time, but I got a tip from a fellow yelper that SS served hearty greens and paninis as big as your head, and decided to give it a shot. 

The first time we went, we passed it right up. Easy to miss, situated next to a Subway, you&#39;re doing yourself a great disservice partaking in a sad $5 foot long. For a only a very nominal bit more, you can get a larger, more filling and fulfilling meal at Savory Salads. Everything was hearty, the bread was delicious and even the half salad was jam packed into a container making it enough for 2 to share- same story with the half panini. 

I&#39;ve left buffets less full than Savory Salads. They mean business here, but their business ain&#39;t mean. Definitely some of the friendliest service I&#39;ve encountered. The dining area is very very small, so on a busy lunch time frame you may be better off just ordering to go. On our visit I think we&#39;d just missed the lunch rush as the table certainly could have used a good wipe down, but once I dug into our tasty bites, it was easy to see how a seemingly tidy sandwich and salad combo could get a little sloppy. After all, these aren&#39;t for the faint of heart.

Besides the &#39;crumby&#39; tables, my only let down was checking their online menu before hand and seeing way more options there than in person at the establishment, but in a way I&#39;m glad it happened that way because it forced me to order outside my comfort zone and helped me find new things that I wouldn&#39;t normally have chosen for myself, that I actually really enjoyed. 

I wish it were easier to get around downtown Barrington&#39;s cockamamie traffic flow so it wouldn&#39;t be so painful to get here, but even that wackadoo city planner of B-town won&#39;t keep me from suckin&#39; down salads and packing on the panini.",29/12/12,265,5,1,5,1,4.3098,1.966,0.6930000000000002,15.341,No,2409
savory-salads-barrington,Dale L.,AlT51uWbcRTWoSCgHebDCA,y2hGAzL0Yp9UA2y9R-g4WQ,"I&#39;m an electrician. Because of this I get to eat out pretty frequently and actively search out the small privately owned greasy spoons instead of frequently visiting Mickey D&#39;s, BK, or Taco Bell. 
Last week one of my employee&#39;s who I enjoy having lunch with the most because of our culinary enthusiasm, asked me how that salad place in Barrington was because I live near there. Uhhh, never went, was my reply. 
Today was my chance to change all that. My wife and I were working at our rental in the village, when I complained that it was time to enjoy some lunch. &#34;So where should we eat?&#34; she asked.  We should try that salad place next to Subway is what I offered. When I arrived there was a cluster of Barrington moms chatting in the tiny dining area, I stood patiently at the counter for what must have been 5 minutes waiting for someone to come to the counter to take my order. Only then did I notice in the clutter on the counter, the bell and sign suggesting to strike it for service. Really? There must be some intense salad science going on in the back area of the restaurant for no one to be manning the restaurant front counter during a late lunch period at 2pm!
 One of the staff finally arrived and quickly took my order of two half salads and two panini&#39;s. Two ladies began preparing my order. Before they began I was a little overwhelmed by the menu and especially the prices. $7. for a half salad and if you add some mediterranean chicken it&#39;s a $2.50 addition? Like I said, this better be some crazy good salad science. 
The meals took a little more than 10 minutes to prepare but once my wife and I were ready to enjoy it, we were not disappointed. The Caesar half salad for my wife was pretty good, but my Balsamic Blue was really tasty. I moved on to the Provolone Prosciutto panini. I&#39;m a big boy and I can EAT. But I could not eat more than half of this sandwich after enjoying the salad. It kept calling to me for several
more bites, there was no more room. 
My brain was saying MOOOOORE! But my stomach was reminding me that it was on the ropes and looking for break. My wife was got as far as three bites into her Caprese panini following her sald and she was done. Both of us were full and our found the meals to be tasty, filling, really enjoyable. Regardless of others who find the packaging that the meal is served in as less than savory, I like the fact that they are conscientious of the feed locally, operate globally mindset, of serving in packaging that is practical and effective. 
Now if they could do something about their price points and still remain profitable, I would be thoroughly enthused about visiting a lot more frequently. For now, I&#39;m really fond of this place and their meals. But I better do a lot more installations to be able to afford eating here as much as I would like.  When my pocket has some extra green in it, I&#39;ll be back to try the other items on that menu.",07/05/15,311,4,1,5,3,6.958,3.12,0.627,30.253,No,2959

savory-salads-barrington,Brett F.,LZwRtRSIR7Jv6LdBfqQyfA,S5ag56K1VsDMJm8E_ZNRyw,"First impressions. Influential? 
Some may say yes. I tend to think so.
However, if judging solely on initial impact of Savory Salads, this review would be far more dismal.

First impression Bummer #1: the place is called Savory Salads. As in, we have a HELLUVA LOTTA SALADS. And they&#39;re savory! But, yeah, salads, we&#39;ve got those! Well, kids, they have seven. Just seven. And of those seven, one is a caprese (boring), another is a Caesar salad (really?), then there&#39;s a garden salad (you&#39;re officially killing me) and a the &#39;ol standby southwestern salad (ol̩? um, no) among a few others that I can&#39;t even remember now. Salad-a-palooza? More like Slimpickins-a-snooza. Let down city. 

First impression Bummer #2: the restaurant was dirty. Every table and counter I turned to had either a previous guest&#39;s trash or crumbs on it. There was literally not a clean spot to be found. We had to request a wipe down of a table, which was kindly obliged, but the funny thing I noticed was that after the gal wiped down our table she just went back behind the counter and left the rest of the muck on other surfaces to hang out. If cleanliness is next to Godliness, this place is going to hell in a salad bowl. 

First impression Bummer #3: presentation. A lot can be said about a foods appeal simply in how it looks. Well, at SS they present their dining-in guests meals the same way they do their take-away customers: in cardboard take-out boxes sealed with stickers. See photos. I&#39;m sure a less picky person might be apt to dismiss this altogether, however, it bugged me. Dining in, yet having to &#39;unseal&#39; my takeout box and eat from it while dining on premise, felt odd and really highlighted a lack of effort.  

At this point I&#39;m sure you&#39;re wondering why this review has three stars and not one. Now that I&#39;m writing it I sort of am, too. But alas! I&#39;ve remembered why. The salads!

While I complained about the succinct menu, my selection of the &#39;Black and Blue&#39; salad with grilled steak, blue cheese crumbles, fresh red onion, sliced cucumber and house made Balsamic Dressing was beautiful, bountiful, tasty and uberfresh. I commented repeatedly on just HOW MUCH salad I had in front of me while my mom chimed in at how tasty and flavorful the chicken in her Southwestern ditty was. We wanted to be displeased but we just couldn&#39;t. It was delicous! Really generous, overlfowing portions, quality ingredients and yummy flavors. Things had officially turned around.

Would I come back for said super salad? Probably... but for take-out only. Dining with cardboard and crumbs, not nearly as savory as the moniker implies.",22/03/13,336,3,1,2,-10,1.2993999999999999,5.507,3.086,33.407,No,2688

savory-salads-barrington,Phillip L.,mmxQQJHrOuX__httcUWI3Q,AG7TUU2YD_PVrJy_SVkL7w,"Went with my wife for lunch at noon on a Saturday.  I ordered a ham panini, and my wife ordered a chopped salad.  Our wait time after ordering was a little over 20 minutes, which was a little longer than I expected.  The ingredients were very fresh, and made to order, so I don&#39;t have a problem with a 5-10 minute wait, but at 20 minutes I was starting to lose my patience.

The panini was fresh -- ham, bread, mustard, and provolone -- simple but tasty.  Portion size was especially large, I can&#39;t think of anywhere that I&#39;ve ordered a panini that came out larger than this one was.  I would have traded half of it in exchange for a pickle and a small side (salad, potato salad, or anything like that).

The chopped salad had a little too much dressing for my wife&#39;s taste, but I tried it and really liked it.  If I go back, I&#39;ll probably order the chopped salad instead of a panini.  I&#39;m not usually one to order salads, but this one was quite good and would be my choice next time.

The staff was friendly, but with four people working and bumping into each other a little bit, it seemed like the cause of the slow food prep was a need for a little better organization.

Pros: excellent chopped salad, fresh ingredients, friendly staff

Cons: wait time was too long, and &#34;I&#39;ll trade you half of this panini if you&#39;ll give me a side&#34;",30/06/12,165,4,1,4,-8,3.2335000000000003,1.2149999999999999,0.114,10.671000000000003,No,1386

I&#39;m seriously shocked that it only has 3 stars at the moment.  Not sure what others are looking for in a restaurant, but what I love about this place is...

Everything is fresh and made in house!!  The homemade bread and pastries are another level above any and all franchise restaurants you could stop at.  Fresh is best!

The coffee bar is incredible!  Lots of options and brewed right there.  MMmm.

Decor is quant and makes you feel comfortable the moment you walk in.  They really have done a nice job of making it cozy!

The salads and panninis are huge!!  Great portions and they save pretty well for leftovers too!

I have been at all different times of the day and yes you have to wait for your food (about 5 min) but if you read the paragraph above....it&#39;s all fresh and made right as you order!!!  Of course you are going to have to wait.  This isn&#39;t the golden arches that has gross unhealthy, unnatural food!  People are so bazaar with their food expectations....let&#39;s be realistic. 

Im really happy that someone has gotten it right when it comes to quick service resturaunts and I applaud the owner!  Nice job and I will continue to return and be one of your many happy and satisfied customers!!

Their hot dogs, salads, and regular ol chocolate cake are really good too.

We went last night on our way home. Order process was ok except couldn&#39;t hear her too well when she repeated the order back. But that&#39;s not surprising for how loud it is in there. But the order came out correctly. 

Down at the other end the girl/lady that was packing up the orders stuffed all of our stuff into ONE paper  bag, including the eclair cake. We had to ask her for a separate bag for the cake and it was like we were totally interrupting her life. When we got home and unpacked everything, it was all smashed because of being crammed into 1 bag. 

The biggest disappointment was that nothing had any flavor to it whatsoever.  My hot dog....no taste. Wife&#39;s hot dog (with everything)....no taste. Both our cheese fries....no taste.  I have never had that happen before. But we do not normally go to this location. Maybe people in St Charles do not like flavor. I find that hard to believe though since the other places around all have flavor.

I ordered the Mediterranean salad with hot chicken on top and my daughter had the cheeseburger and fries. When the lady handed me the salad from behind where they make it I was a bit surprised. I said this is it? The lettuce was chopped up with everything else and looked wilted and old. I asked if they had more fresh lettuce and they told me that&#39;s what they use for the salads. I thought ok and sat down to eat. I also ate 3/4 of the cheeseburger meat as my daughter said it was too salty. She was right. It was like eating pure salt! I took the meat and cut it up to put it in my salad. That night I was tossing and turning with the most horrible stomach ache.

However, I always feel most crowded in this particular Portillo&#39;s compared to the other two that I&#39;ve been to numerous times.

As far as food- I rotate through a few of my favorites every time I go- Jumbo hot dog, cheese fries, onion rings, Italian beef dipped, chopped salad, or the breaded chicken croissant. I still haven&#39;t tried the ribs- it is on my list- but I hear they are delicious. Oh, and the chocolate cake shake and strawberry shortcake are delicious for dessert.

I highly recommend Portillo&#39;s as well for a private party- they are reasonably priced, have great service, and nice private rooms so your party can ignore the hustle and bustle of the rest of the restaurant.

Portillo&#39;s is really a one-stop shop for high quality fast food. I love the wide variety of menu items. 

My favorites are the Chopped Salad (with lemon poppy muffin) and the Cheesy Beef Croissant. 

I also like the traditional Beef Sandwich and the Breaded Chicken Sandwich. 

I think their hot dogs are ok. I don&#39;t care much for the bun. But they do make it proper with all the fixings.

Typical Midwestern dine in experience with a washboard hanging on the wall along with some steel tools and the other midwestern chain decor. It reminded me a little of a Famous Dave&#39;s. 

I really wanted an Italian Beef. Kind of a let down. I ordered mozzarella and hot peppers. Either they forgot the cheese for .50 cents extra or their idea of cheese is throwing on two shreds of mozzarella.

While I like the fact that it was drenched in juice, it just didn&#39;t satisfy my hankering for an Italian Beef at all. For all the praise and accolades this place gets, I just didn&#39;t experience anything that amazing or mind blowing.

The fries were pretty good. Like that they carry the krinkle cuts and that they were hot!

Italian beef - 4 stars. Tastes great, but when I had ordered from this location most recently (March &#39;13), it had a lot less beef than I remembered. I remembered having a beef at the Portillo&#39;s in Rolling Meadows where they had double the meat.

Maxwell Street Polish - 5 stars. Delicious! Nice snap. Soft bun.

Grilled tuna sandwich - 4 stars. Healthier alternative to their Italian beef. I never order salads at an eatery because I can just make one at home in lickety-split.

Chicago-style hotdog - 5 stars. Perfect how it is.

Their Italian beef is awesome! I have them add cheddar cheese for even more flavor. The Beef-N-Cheddar Croissant comes on a huge croissant almost as big as the Italian Beef sandwich itself. So if you&#39;re looking for a softer bread, try the croissant.

They also have a Barnelli&#39;s side to the restaurant where you can order pastas and salads. I don&#39;t like the bacon they put in some of their salads because it is too chewy (fatty). Otherwise, everything else is good.

Portillo&#39;s food is great! The seating and service in this location leaves much to be desired. There are too many tables crammed into the space, they need to take about 1/4 of them out. 

The service on the salad side is awful. Sometimes you order and in moments your salad is ready while others who ordered 10 minutes before you are still waiting. Just hope you&#39;re not in the latter crowd. They just don&#39;t have their act together.

The naan is crisp and flaky on one side but nicely buttered and garlicky on the top side. Their standard jasmine rice is al dente and perfectly cooked.

I&#39;ve tried the goat chettinad which was flavorful but crept up on your tastebuds which heat and formidable presence. If you can handle the heat and spice, go for it. India Bhawan takes up a sizable portion of the strip mall but it is beautiful on the inside with nicely appointed adornments. 

Their bathrooms are glitzy to say the least but impeccably clean. I haven&#39;t ventured to the bar area but their house wines are pretty tasty for the money.

I am generally not a picky eater and don&#39;t criticize about my food unless it stands out (in a bad way).  I did like their Indian style specialty pizza.  They are not bad.  Some of their apps like Chicken 65, Chili Paneer, and Andhra Cut Mirchi are good.

india-bhawan-palatine,Jennifer L.,MhHtPfvJXweF4xwK7Hm5yA,vAriBTjz0l98zGC5_OWxHA,"I LOVE chicken tikka masala. It&#39;s one of the only things a picky eater like myself likes at an Indian Restaurant. I had a favorite place. It closed. I finally found another favorite place, and then it too closed. I found this place through Yelp a while ago and was finally able to try it a couple days ago! SO happy i did. 

We ordered for carryout. My son went to go pick it up, he said the interior of the restaurant was really nice. I was a little worried, because the reviews are like either 1-star or 5-stars, seems like people either love it or hate it. 

Chicken Tikka Masala: was a little bit more yellow than i like, so i was nervous when i opened the container. But i have to say it was DEEEE-LICIOUS!! My son and i both really, really enjoyed it. It was creamy and buttery and fabulous! Lots of flavor, just a smidge of spice. Based on this first experience, It&#39;s right up there in my top three ever. I was a little disappointed in the size of the serving, when you&#39;re paying $15 for some chicken i guess i kinda expected a little larger container. Ultimately with the extra rice and sides i purchased, it ended up feeding two of us. If we had not gotten sides though, there&#39;s no way it would be enough for two people. 

The Garlic Naan was BEAUTIFUL! Is that weird to say about bread?! lol. See picture. It was truly the most beautiful presentation of naan i&#39;ve ever had. It tasted really nice, as well. Very pleased with the naan. 

Samosa: wasn&#39;t my favorite. I still have one left, i&#39;m going to heat it up and try again, but it just had a little different taste than i&#39;m used to. I usually love samosas. I need to try and put my finger on what I don&#39;t like about this one, and then will update. 

Overall, i think it&#39;s a tad expensive. However from a quality perspective - it was really good food! I am definitely excited to try it again! Looking forward to it.

Tip: per their website, looks like they do deliver! Never seen an Indian delivery place - i think it&#39;s great! Unfortunately, i&#39;m sure we&#39;re too far away so we&#39;ll have to pick it up. But that&#39;s fine.

Like many others have pointed out it is a new restaurant and one section of the restaurant was still undergoing reno as we were dining. This was a tad annoying at times with the drilling sound.

We ordered the Medhu Vada, Onion Pakora, Chicken 65, Paper Masala Dosa, Onion Rava Dosa and Chicken Chettinad with Naan. 

What we thoroughly enjoyed :::: were the Medhu Vada, Onion Rava dosa and Naans. The vada was fluffy &amp; crunchy! The Onion Rava Dosa was superb in texture and taste.

The rest of the food items were good but nothing extraordinary. The Chicken 65 tasted like a simple chicken fry tossed with curry leaves. The Paper Masala Dosa was over done on one side. This biggest disappointment was the Chicken Chettinad which was loaded with pepper and other Indian spices. Those flavors were very dominant and did not allow us to enjoy the dish.

The servers were better at refilling everything. The tandoori chicken was fresher. I still wasn&#39;t asked if I wanted a drink, though. The servers could be a little more prompt at emptying the table. There were still a few dishes that left something to be desired, the one that stuck out from my yesterday was the hard rasgulla and watery korma. My two lunch buffets experience there demonstrate the buffet items range from amazing to just okay.  Keep up the amazing things, and take out the not so great things!

Although it was eerily empty, the decor was modern and the staff made us feel quite welcome. We ordered masala dosa for an appetizer and it was sooo good. It was a huge portion and presented with hot Sambhar and coconut chutney. Yum! Then we ordered paneer tikka masala and bhindi amchur. While the paneer was tasty, the okra was amazing. Probably the best we ever had. We had plenty to take home for leftovers. After our meal, we decided that we had to come and try the lunch buffet. So we went on a Saturday afternoon. The options were plentiful and some things were spicier than I could handle but still, the food was great. Hot, fresh naan and tandoori chicken were brought to our table too. We left with happy tummies. 

All and all, the food is a tad expensive but is really, really tasty and we recommend it.",01/08/16,108,5,2,5,39,5.1268,2.903,0.09,13.008,No,880
india-bhawan-palatine,Vaibhav B.,bqeHM095-r9Li-B9HcwR8w,2b6w7gGE46vD-bWWreIXsQ,"Visited India Bhavan today for their Lunch buffet with a group of 6. The ambience is great and spacious. Well that&#39;s the only good part of it. Although we were a group of 6 we were crammed up into two tables which could barely fit all our plates and glasses. There was no place for the breads, dosas and tandoori chicken which came in later. We just had to juggle everything between the little space we were left with. When we asked the server if he could add another table so that we could ease out he bluntly replied that it&#39;s Friday and we have lot of folks coming in. Well the place had quite a lot of tables vacant and they remained the same till we had left.

Now coming to the food, there was a lot of variety and almost equal options for both veg and non veg food items. But unfortunately just having lot of options is not good, it also needs to have some taste. The goat curry, chicken curry and tandoori chicken were very low on salt and not very tasty. Tandoori chicken had almost gone dry, probably was sitting on the sizzler for a long time. Other items were ok, didn&#39;t find anything that caught our attention.I have had better Indian food in the vicinity. Most of the folks on our table were visiting for the first time and were not too impressed with the experience. I think the place is still new and has a good scope to improve.",12/02/16,141,1,2,2,27,1.7517,1.533,0.6719999999999999,11.794999999999998,No,1357
india-bhawan-palatine,Lynn B.,yyGk_LaUJDh1THK5ok2z7A,aIdTpBfKFuXza5UosyDL8A,"Forget about all of your other Indian restaurants in all of Chicago. This place is absolutely the best.

I would have taken photos of the food, which I like to do, but I ate it too fast and I couldn&#39;t stop myself, so no pictures. Just go eat it. Don&#39;t even take a picture of it. Just eat it. Today. Do it. Go.

india-bhawan-palatine,Ritu D.,cp-rWPVqlGyuroPKoBefYQ,QA--4fHXExbKwhbS37OyzA,"The restaurant seems pretty unassuming from the outside - located in a small strip mall, in a space that was initially going to be an italian restaurant. When you walk in, though, it has a large spacious, beautiful interior - with a large bar area to the right, an even larger dining area to the left, and a small party room in the back. The decor is what I loved most about this place! It&#39;s sparkly, a modern touch, just beautiful - very different from what you would expect from an indian restaurant - word is, they kept the decor from the italian restaurant that was going to open there prior to them - LOVE it!

We went for the lunch buffet to try as much as we could. There were plenty of items to choose from - Chaat, fruit, salad, samosas, pakoras, gobi manchurian, rice, idli, sambar, chutneys, raita, 5 veg entrees, 5 meat entrees, gulab jamun, ras malai, and fruit custard. They bring fresh masala dosas, naan, and tandoori chicken to the table if you want any of them. The food was decent, not the best I&#39;ve had but definitely not the worst. The samosas were small and delicious! Chaat was pretty good. I really enjoyed the gobi manchurian so I looked past the extreme oiliness. Idli, sambar, and chutney were fine - nothing to write home about. The dosa was a decent size, yet contained maybe half a cup of the masala, which itself was pretty tasteless to begin with. Wednesdays are dosa night, and judging from these dosas - I wouldn&#39;t want to go out of my way for that. The veg entrees were palak paneer, dal makhani, mushroom muttar, potato fry, and navratan korma. I absolutely loved the navratan korma: Extremely flavorful! The mushroom mutter was pretty good. The palak paneer is usually my favorite, but didn&#39;t have much flavor other than the spinach and paneer, the dal makhani was extremely tasteless, and the potato fry was nearly inedible due to how extremely spicy they made it. Another table heard me talk about the spice after downing a glass of water and they agreed that they couldn&#39;t even finish one bite. The fresh naan was great. Dessert was pretty good.

Overall, food was decent - not the best, but there were definitely items I enjoyed. I have never heard of sit down indian restaurants serving pizzas, but they do - and I&#39;m intrigued - I will probably come back to try those at some point when visiting my parents again in the suburbs!

If the owner reads this - seriously, do you know where all that decor is from?? LOVE! :)",09/04/16,305,3,3,5,58,11.444699999999997,8.142999999999999,0.413,17.441999999999997,No,2484

india-bhawan-palatine,Michele B.,5QIKSsA37FTkAae9hJeCTg,GN4fKqG9CFJLFxOIzScu1Q,"I love Indian food and have been to many if not all in the area. After reading the reviews I was hopeful that India Bhawan would not disappoint, but sad to say I was terribly disappointed.  

From the beginning we waited in the entrance for longer than one would expect for a restaurant that was pretty slow for that time of night on a Friday.  When we were seated the waiter (didn&#39;t have a name tag) kind of tossed the menus in a pile at us and walked away.  We ordered as soon as he appeared, which took so long the hostess came to our table to see if anyone had taken our order.  The chickpea bread with the sauces was very good, but when it was 30 minutes and we STILL hadn&#39;t seen any food we grabbed a server and asked for more and also asked that our water glasses be refilled.  That took 10 minutes and STILL no food.  Took about an hour for our food to arrive and I can&#39;t speak for the rest of my party (though they probably would have eaten the tablecloth they were so hungry) but my Aloo Gohbi (cauliflower and potatoes in a creamy spicy sauce) was probably some of the worst I have ever experienced.  The sauce was hot but the cauliflower and potatoes were warm at best.  The cauliflower was noticeably scant in this dish that had an over abundance of UNDER COOKED potatoes.  I thought the price $13 for a mostly potato dish was over the top.  Again waiter MIA so I asked the hostess if we could get our bill and a takeout box (thought I would take my potatoes home and cook them).  After a few minutes our waiter appeared from the bathroom reeking of smoke and offered to box my leftovers, I declined, paid the bill and left.",11/01/16,171,1,1,1,-28,0.09599999999999997,1.244,0.8399999999999999,10.916,No,1649

They&#39;re close to my house, the pizza is pretty good, and the secret barbecue menu is very promising. However, every trip here ends with something bizarre happening that makes me question another return trip.

In no specific order:

1. My wife&#39;s deep dish pizza was given to another customer WHO DIDN&#39;T EVEN ORDER FROM COOPERS. This person walked into the wrong pizza place and left with our pizza. To add insult to (first world) injury, there was no offer to make it right by Coopers. I would expect a free pizza, not a &#34;please wait another 40 minutes for us to make you another pizza and charge you full price.&#34; 

2. The food is always slow: We now build an extra 10-15 into our wait time when we order take-out.

3. The prices: We ate off the &#34;experimental barbecue menu&#34; and for 2 BBQ meals, a hamburger and a salad the bill was $75. Apparently secret menus have secret prices. I think the BBQ was $20/plate. Ouch. And the $5 discount card isn&#39;t going to help this problem.

4. Bizarre policies: Burgers only done medium well. What? Why?

coopers-pizza-barrington-3,Jeff P.,oVyDhCoZAAxm3OhyY14XOQ,#NAME?,"I&#39;ve found Cooper&#39;s to serve authentic sandwiches, wraps, and salads which are among the most generously-portioned I&#39;ve had (no bagged-lettuce on a plate), without being over-the-top huge.  I&#39;ve been coming to Coopers for two years and can honestly say that after having almost everything on the menu, there is little that disappoints.  Homemade dressings, fries, and chips are unique and tasty.  My favorites are the grilled chicken sand on pretzel bun, baked meatball on garlic bread, and quesadilla with jerk chicken.  The buffalo wings are an appetizer easily shared, or an entree.  For a heartier dinner, ribs and stuffed pizza are my next favorites, and homemade chili (in Fall/Winter).  I&#39;ve found the staff to be knowledgeable and there&#39;s very little turnover which is always a good sign.  The decor is continually improving, and has virtually nothing in common with the previous pizza hangout.  For dessert, there&#39;s a new frozen yogurt place next door.

The chicken quesodilla (only cheese was on the menu, but they chicken ized it for us) was described as &#34;yummy&#34;. The only gripe was with the horchata, too watery. 
 The big plus, they have a drive through! While my heart will long for the former tenant, the new occupant has thus far earned my business. The true test is upcoming, how good are your burrito suizos?

Let me preface this review by stating this: I only like my tacos on flour tortillas and they have to have sour cream and NO lettuce. I know, not really keeping it real, but that is how I grew up eating my tacos and that is how I will continue to eat my tacos.

I ordered a chicken taco and a steak taco, both on flour tortillas and both with sour cream and no lettuce. What I received was a chicken taco and a steak taco, both on corn tortillas, covered with lettuce and not a drop of sour cream. Get this, I liked them. I really liked them. I scraped a majority of the lettuce off, of course.... but what was under the lettuce was pretty darn good. The chicken was so flavorful, I didn&#39;t even mind that it was on a corn tortilla. Same with the steak. Both tacos were really delicious. 

That being said, I doubt we will be running back anytime soon. Too many other Mexican restaurants in the area that are far better and will get a simple order correct.

The beef burrito was large (only a bit smaller than a chipotle burrito) and the beer was tender and well seasoned. Surprising for a mexican restaurant, the fries were good too! The meal was priced at 7.39, definitely a price I&#39;m willing to pay for the portion.

- Lobster Mac N Cheese - best I&#39;ve ever had

We also go some pretzel bites that were fresh and came with pimento cheese and horseradish cheddar sauce, again delicious.  I got the one burger that had bbq sauce bacon and an onion ring on it.

For starters, they don&#39;t take reservations but have a nice lounge area tucked to the side of the bar in the front windows where you can hang out (and we even had a waiter come by and take drink orders for us) while you wait for your table. We sat here while waiting for our whole party to arrive, also.

We split the pierogis -- a MUST if you come here (potato and onion, obvi). 5 come to an order and they&#39;re just perfect pillows from heaven. You&#39;ll love em. After this, I just wanted a classic bacon cheeseburger so I went for the Local Burger (with bacon) and mac and cheese as my side. Talk about an indulgent meal! It definitely hit the spot. Their mac and cheese is delish!

The girls and I all tried different cocktails and we had so much fun sitting and sipping for a while after our meal was done. Their cocktail menu is very unique and there&#39;s something for everyone! To round out our meal, one friend ordered a round of celebratory chocolate martinis for the table (and the bartender did awesome)!

I really enjoyed my first visit at The Burger Local. The interior is awesome, service was friendly, and they have a huge food and drink menu. We had a table of 6 gals out celebrating Olivia B&#39;s birthday! Our table started with an order of the pierogis which was a surprising menu item, but very yummy! This dish comes with 5 homemade pierogis - either potato and caramelized onion or sauerkraut (we went with potato and onion), pan fried in sage butter for $10.

I&#39;ve been on a champagne kick for quite some time now, so it was only natural that my first cocktail was the Pom Pom. I can&#39;t remember all that was in it, but the drink included prosecco and vodka. My second cocktail was their grape cocktail - again, can&#39;t remember what was in it but it was fruity and delicious! Just a heads up - the drink menu on their website is different than the one we were given at the restaurant. 

The waitress told me their blue salad was awesome so I ordered that, and she was right! This salad is so good you guys. Not only does it look pretty, but it tastes amazing. Mixed greens, grilled tenderloin, gorgonzola, roasted fennel, tomato, cherry peppers, onion strings, and house made blue cheese vinaigrette. Need I say more? For $16 this salad is pretty big and the tenderloin was on point. 

As far as dessert goes, all they have is pie which is kind of a bummer. Luckily the bartender was able to whip us up some chocolate martinis! Sweet, boozy, and perfect for celebrating.",14/04/16,186,5,2,5,16,8.4718,4.728,0.31500000000000006,13.956999999999999,No,1563
the-burger-local-geneva,Christa F.,VVyIz8Z73MU9RbZA_JoyRA,sQUuQBregBtOV7TvqcwugQ,"After work Friday, we had some things to do in Geneva, so I took the train out that way and the boy met me there. I knew we&#39;d be hungry before we went gallivanting around, so I found somewhere to have dinner while I waited. The boy has a love affair with burgers and as soon as I exited the train I saw Burger Local... 

The hostesses informed us that it would be a 30-40 minute wait, so we put our names in and found a spot on one of the couches in one of the lounge areas to wait. A server came by and took our drink orders, so we let her know that we had our name in for a table. She asked how long and wanted to know if we also wanted an app while we waited. We let her know we&#39;d think about it while we waited for our drinks.

I ordered a cider and the boy ordered and Irish mule to which the server said they could make. My guess is that they don&#39;t have it on the menu and don&#39;t typically make by her response. When it came out it didn&#39;t taste quite right, so the boy asked for some limes to see if that was the missing factor. Turns out it was. Mistake fixed and his drink tasted way better!

We did opt to order an app while we waited. We started with the Tots while we waited for our table. They are fried in duck fat, topped with braised short rib, parmesan mornay, grilled leeks, and drizzled with gravy. These were obviously handmade tots! Everything paired together very nicely giving the tots a really great flavor with just the right touch of saltiness and smokiness. My only issue was the coating of the tots. It was a little tough and chewy. 

The server was nice enough to check on our table wait a few times for us. It took an hour instead of 30-40 minutes. There was a room with arcade games, so we spent the rest of the time in there playing Ninja Turtle and Burger Time so we didn&#39;t get too antsy. 

For dinner we both order the Mac &#39;n Cheese with Pork Belly. I added schrooms to mine and the boy added chicken to his. I wish I could remember the 3 cheeses the server told us were in there, but I can only remember white cheddar. Anyway, the combination was really tasty! And the noodles they used were the kind that hold the sauce down inside of them which is great! Since we had an app, we both ended up taking leftovers home for lunch!

Our server was super nice and attentive! She answered all of our questions. We had the same one from the lounge area for dinner which was nice. All of the stars are for her and the food. 

The hostesses - there were 3 - were really quite terrible. They stood around socializing and ignoring people for the most part. There was no need for more than 1 considering the servers were covering more area than they could handle on such a busy night. The hostesses could also use some better training on how to speak to customers and estimate wait times! As nice as this seems, the treatment from the hostesses alone will prevent us from returning.",29/07/16,312,3,1,4,-19,3.704500000000001,2.495,1.246,32.259,No,2931

The place is trendy, cool and had a friendly vibe. There were couples, families and various groups keeping the spirit up throughout the late afternoon. 
We tried a couple craft beers, nothing that we loved, but they had 8-10 beers on tap to try. The beers rotate, so you won&#39;t see the drafts on their online menu. Also, the Sunday special is $2.50 Miller Lite drafts, an affordable option. 

As for food, I can&#39;t believe I tried them, but we ordered the tostachos...three tostadas with lots of toppings including chorizo and ready, oxtail. Um, the were good, but it was hard to get the idea that I was eating meat scraped off a cow&#39;s tail. Also, my husband got a bone, thank the Lord that that was not in mine!!! It&#39;s still weird that I ate it. We also ordered the deviled eggs, they had an uneven distribution of toppings (lobster and bacon) throughout the egg mixture which was disappointing on a could of the eggs. 

For our entrees, the guys both had the four pepper burger with fries. They both loved all of it and each burger was cooked correctly. I tried a bite, and I really enjoyed the crispy jalape̱os. My friend ordered the tacos of the week w/a house salad. She really enjoyed them and ate every bite. I ordered the house salad with salmon. The flavor combination was awesome and so was the dressing and the salmon was cooked to perfection. 
I will certainly go back. I would ask for a tasting of the beer before I order and skip the apps to save room for the more delicious entrees.

We would have waited for a table (told an hour), but a couple seats opened at the bar- and we are good with that!  So only 10 minutes for us- and another got moved up a bit... Worked for all. 

Let me start With the bartender, she was great.  Attentive, suggesting drinks on special drink menu- and quite delish!  

Menu- nicely appointed with many options to choose from!  I had the shrimp burger from the &#34;protein&#34; section of the menu- umm hellllo, yum yum yum!  Fresh.  I chose the brioche bun vs. pretzel, side was fries. Garlic salted perfection on the fries!  Really really enjoyed- will return for that hands down! 

Hubby went for a typical burger - but he said it wasn&#39;t typical at&#39;all!  Probably the best burger he&#39;s ever had!!! Full of flavor.  His side was a salad - whateves.... I go for gusto with fries in a burger place.  He was playing good boy.  

Played great music- loved the cool black chandeliers- might steal one ;)  Go and plan on waiting a bit - it&#39;s cool- have a beverage or give them your phone number - take a walk - they will call u!!!

the-burger-local-geneva,Jim K.,0mgZF0Z0JGRrbfSXjp3XRQ,kri3U47CzPxbL_IIV4o44g,"For some reason, a lot of our favorite places in the Tri-Cities were packed this weekend, maybe because it&#39;s March and the slightest hint of spring is in the air? When our group of friends wanted to get together for the first time after the holidays, we couldn&#39;t find a place for a reservation around 7:00 pm, so we decided to take our chances and try out The Burger Local.  Any place that lists my favorite Negroni on the menu as a featured cocktail is worth a look.

My lovely wife and I arrived around 6:00 pm, and the place was really hopping.  A check in with the hostess told us that there was a 1-1/2 to 2 hour wait for a group of our size.  We put in our phone number and since the bar was two deep, decided to beat a hasty retreat right up Third St. to our favorite place for a nice pre-dinner libation, Wildwood.  A quick text to the rest of our friends, and we settled in for the call.

The wait was really about 1:15 and The Burger Local was no less crowded but louder when we walked back in. Thankfully we were seated right away, presented with menus and drink orders placed. The aforementioned Negroni was spot on.

For apps, our group shared the potato and onion pierogis and the portobello croquets.  I&#39;ve eaten my share of pierogis in my day, nothing better than Mom&#39;s homemade, but the entire table enjoyed the lightly pan fried, nicely sized gems.  The croquets were mezza-mezza, actually very finely chopped mushrooms, but the cream sauce accompaniment was really delicious.

My wife and I both opted for the Double Diner burger, her&#39;s with fries and mine with onion rings.  The burgers were really good, the pork belly, pickles and egg added nicely to the flavor, and my onion rings were stupendous, accompanied with another nice sauce, this time pepper jack.

As a group, our only real complaint is that most of the food was overly salted.  I&#39;ve read some of the other Yelps here complaining about lack of flavor, but to us, too much salt does not necessarily mean better flavor.

There were some other menu items that looked intriguing enough for us to plan a return visit, but next time I&#39;ll ask them to hold back on the NaCl if they can.",06/03/16,255,3,3,5,64,5.7844,2.323,0.48,15.198,No,2190

the-burger-local-geneva,Andy G.,YKEELuL0vGh8sUHxntfuPQ,ST20m0X9rtexb_OlPp8pFw,"As much as I still like the DMK burger bar, I have to say this is now my favorite burger establishment in this area. Being a fan and loyal customer of Barrel + Rye my expectations were exceedingly high and were exceeded. I found out from Sarah at the other location (who always provides me with stellar service) that an owner by the name of Nick is the culinary genius behind the menu items at both locations. So Nick whoever you are (I know you but you don&#39;t know me) your culinary talents are greatly appreciated to say the least.

Where do I start with all the fabulous menu items? The pepper jack dressing is so unique and SO good on the taco salad and of course they don&#39;t just throw chunks of meat on the salad. The high quality meat is extremely tender and deliciously seasoned. You will find this same meat on the cobb salad at the other location. As far as the burgers go any one of them would be to die for but I personally like the double diner and the lamb burger. I also highly recommend the mushroom appetizer. Another fabulous appetizer is the combination oyster, sausage, and onion ring appetizer.  I don&#39;t like oysters but I would be tempted to order it and ditch the oysters. The sausage is obviously made in house and it has this great home made taste. Please be aware though that with all the fried food selections this dish is rich and is best enjoyed with another person. The attention to detail is mind boggling. Many of the sauces and sides are just as good as the main dishes. I especially like that the two locations have different items and each location has a distinct theme. 

I congratulate Nick on his obvious success and look forward to what he will bring us in the future which would hopefully be another location.",02/03/16,185,5,3,5,55,8.1561,3.5289999999999995,0.192,14.278,No,1759

the-burger-local-geneva,Shevon R.,S2xVq_56n25pP0IhjQwMYQ,waSpql7s-y-nrBAoNRasQw,"Went there for a late lunch today.  The d̩cor is sort of a cool, eclectic mix with rustic, homey features.  We chose to not wait and sit in one of the &#34;lounge&#34; areas.  This was outfitted with a couch, coffee table, and 2 lounge chairs.  I would not have chosen this, but my son wanted to sit there.  He thought it was a fun novelty to sit on a couch and eat at a restaurant.  The light fixtures are huge, black chandeliers that fit with the rustic chic design going on.

I decided to order an appetizer for my meal.   The waitress who was fine, nothing exceptional, recommended the Tostachos over the Tots, so I chose the Tostachos (tostada &amp; nachos). On the menu, it is described as follows: smoked oxtail, chorizo, black beans, pico de gallo, guacamole sauce, queso fundido, fresh tortillas.  If I was blindfolded and did not know what I was eating I would have said some sort of protein on a fried corn tortilla with some sour cream, queso, black beans, and greens.  I didn&#39;t taste any pico de gallo or guacamole sauce.  One bite had some funky dry piece of micro green that was the texture of straw.  (yes, I had to spit that one out.)  By the menu&#39;s description, I was expecting an explosion of flavors.  That was not the case.  The meat was supposedly smoked oxtail and chorizo, but you could&#39;ve said it was soy protein and some ground beef and I would&#39;ve believed it.  Bland and flavorless.

My 11-year-old is a foodie and knows a good burger when he tastes one.  He ordered the BBQ burger.  It was on a pretzel bun with bacon, cheese, bbq sauce, and an onion ring.  It came with fresh cut fries.  I asked him what he thought (I also tried a bite).  I concur with his review.  He said the burger had no taste at all, the bacon was hard to bite off because it wasn&#39;t crisp enough, there was hardly any bbq sauce (he had to add some ketchup for taste), and the bottom of the pretzel bun was soggy and mushy with grease.  I asked what he thought of the pretzel bun and he said, &#34;It&#39;s a pretzel bun.  Hard to go wrong with that, except it&#39;s all wet on the bottom.&#34;  The fries were the best thing on his plate.  

What a disappointment.  When &#34;burger&#34; is in your restaurant&#39;s name, I would expect an excellent burger.  The actual burger had no flavor at all.  Don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll be back.

Pros: the interior is beautiful. Except for a few stray wires that were running up along one wall, it&#39;s gorgeous inside. MUCH more inviting than the former Mexican place. Lots of TVs everywhere. But yet does NOT have as much of a &#34;bar&#34; feel to it as one might expect. The light fixtures are really cool. The waitress we had was attentive and sweet. 

Cons: The meat had no flavor. I had the double diner and if it didn&#39;t have all the extras on it, I would have literally sent it back. The burger by itself would be so bland. When I bite into a burger I expect really mouth watering taste. I didn&#39;t get that with this burger. I was really disappointed since the place is called BURGER local. I work in the city, so maybe I&#39;m spoiled by all the choices and flavors and variety out there, but this definitely didn&#39;t come anywhere close to other burgers I&#39;ve had. Even Tom and Eddies and Smashburger are better tasting than this place. The ONLY saving grace on the cool &#34;plate&#34;... was the fries. Delicious fries. They were some of the best I&#39;ve had. I would say take your $12-15 (the cost of their burgers) and find another place. I&#39;m really surprised since these are the same owners as Barrel and Rye.

The only other note I had was that there is no noise dampening in the place, it&#39;s all hard surfaces so it gets really loud in there. 

Suggestion to owners: find a way to flavor the burgers better, or get a better source of meat. And add noise dampening to reduce the noise level when it gets really busy.",10/02/16,184,2,2,5,35,5.7545,4.322,0.7100000000000001,19.968,No,1667

The Burger Local is right across from the train station and replaced a Mexican place I didn&#39;t like much. After hearing the raves a few friends, my boyfriend and I just had to try! We started with some oxtail tostadas... Absolutely amazing. Then I had the four pepper burger while my boyfriend tried the pimento burger. I wasn&#39;t even that hungry but devoured the whole thing. It was just spicy enough, with bacon, pepper jack cheese, and with crunchy fried onions dusted with habenero sauce. Amazing! I only had one bite of my boyfriends pimento burger, but it was a unique olive flavor. My boyfriend polished off his burger too! Both of the burgers were juicy and cooked to perfection. Oh, and the hand cut fries are amazing too! Great service also. The perfect place for that &#34;burger splurge!&#34;",14/07/16,99,5,2,5,17,4.664499999999999,3.9319999999999995,0.253,9.815,No,846

The only drawback is the lighting.  I&#39;m in my mid 40s now and my eyes are already starting to shift into Hans Moleman mode, so even with adequate lighting reading small print can be a challenge.  When you dine here you feel like you&#39;re in a midevil dungeon.  I can almost hear the screams of the tortured coming from the kitchen.

here&#39;s a tip, folks - good food, good service... but if you want to preserve this feel as part of your ambience, have some kind of light apparatus at each table (not a dim candle) to assist us old farts in reading the menu.",15/03/16,89,4,1,2,4,1.1341,0.897,0.425,5.678,No,764

The restaurant is actually quite dark and there are TVs lining the wall. It has much more of an upscale bar atmosphere than a friendly family place like I thought it would. My husband and I were uncertain if it was baby-friendly because all of the tables and chairs we could see were bar height. The hostess said they had shorter tables in the back with high chairs, so we decided to go ahead. 

Our baby wasn&#39;t in the mood to cooperate, which obviously isn&#39;t the restaurant&#39;s fault, but because the tables are small, the food was placed right in front of our baby, and it was burning hot. She grabbed it and burned her fingers and started screaming. The waiter just seemed embarrassed and nobody was kind about the fact we had to rush baby out of there, though brought the check &amp; a to go container very quickly. 

The food was okay; my SIL really enjoyed the French dip burger and when I got to taste it, it was great. My short rib burger was kind of dry and the short ribs themselves were good but were lost on the burger overall. My husband had the pork burger and it was just okay. The onion rings were mostly batter and the fries were only okay. 

In short, restaurant is not really baby-appropriate, fancy food is only okay, and it is very fashionable so if you&#39;re a young family of dorks just trying to grab a burger, this place is not for you.",20/05/16,156,2,1,3,-44,2.2579,1.514,0.554,10.931,No,1462

It doesn&#39;t get a whole lot better than this. Well, unless you go down the street to Barrel + Rye which is owned by the same people.

We have some shopping to do on Saturday and were in the Geneva area. We started to go to another restaurant that we have had good luck with recently, when I remembered that her friend had told me about this place.  The sister restaurant to one of our favorite restaurants in Wheaton used to be located here. Apparently, the owner of that one, for whatever reason, decided to open a burger joint. We&#39;re really glad he did.

We were greeted at the door as we walked in, and seated immediately. The host was very friendly. As we came to find out, this was going to be the same with all the staff we met. Our server,  was at our table within five minutes to take our drink order and our drinks arrived at the table shortly thereafter. He also took the time to explain several different things on her menu. We decided to start off with the deviled eggs. If we had one thing that wasn&#39;t outstanding at this restaurant, it was these eggs. They were good, however somewhat bland. I hope they read these, because all those deviled eggs need is a little bit more punch by maybe adding a spice or mustard.

My wife had a standard burger with fries and I decided to try the BBQ. My wife always orders well done ( wife or life of me I can&#39;t figure out) and I medium rare.  Both were prepared to perfection. I got fries, she got the tater tots.  not sure I  would refer to them as tots, more like teenagers. These were easily three times the size of normal tater tots.  they might not be prepared to everybody&#39;s liking, but for us, having them on the slightly undercooked side was great!  Back to the burgers for a second, these are not your fast food burgers. These take two, if not three hands to eat, and make sure you hang your head over that plate, because they&#39;re very juicy. 

The beer selection look excellent, however we can&#39;t speak to it since right now I&#39;m on some medication that prevents me from trying it. Trust me, I&#39;ll be back.

We now have two excellent choices for lunch or dinner when in Geneva, and luckily they&#39;re owned by the same individual which means the quality and service should be consistent.

We highly recommend.",29/12/15,253,5,2,5,38,7.9504,5.388,0.7320000000000001,23.880000000000006,No,2308

There are many different sitting areas throughout the restaurant to sit, have a drink and wait for your table. 

Food was great, we had the Portobello mushroom appetizer, liked the flavor and the dipping sauce complimented it well. We both had burgers. I had the short rib burger, cooked medium, and I have to say they nailed the temp on the burger, with the side salad. The vingerette dressing was perfect, just the right amount of acidity but not overpowering and they didn&#39;t drown the salad in the dressing. 

My wife had the chicken chorizo burger and liked it a lot. Good spice flavor to it but didn&#39;t blow her mouth out so that all she tasted was hot or spice heat.

The funky tots were great (I think they will be a main course for a couple of our group if they ever return), and we liked the Portobello croquets.  We had 2 Black &amp; Blue burgers, a local, a French dip, and a burger of the week (with a perfect sunny-side-up egg).  The burgers were delicious, prepared properly, and generously sized (most of us halved ours for left-overs and to save room for dessert). The fries are some of the best around, the mac and cheese is very good, and the side salad with citrus-ginger dressing was a wonderful complement to the grill on the burgers. We had Key Lime pie for dessert, which was excellent; we were surprised that it came with vanilla ice cream, but that went very well with the thick graham cracker crust.  However, we could barely hear each other speak.  We arrived for an unusually early dinner -- 4 o&#39;clock --  and beat the crowd that trickled in over the next hour, but even so the cavernous space seemed to absorb our voices before they crossed the table, and the loud music made me want to finish up and escape as soon as possible.

Like, the best everything (burger, onion rings, etc) I&#39;ve had in every category. I think their pimento cheese burger is awesome - husband enjoys the French dip burger. I have just one issue here. We came with our kids including our 16-month old (for an EARLY dinner on a Sunday evening - like 4PM - we&#39;re not rude diners who drag our kids out during date night hours and bother other patrons) and it was already crowded which means our only seating option was one of their communal, very high top tables (they have maybe three low top tables, normal height tables in the entire restaurant). They could not offer a high chair tall enough to fit this table, and the booster seat option was a joke - the tiniest little booster I&#39;ve ever seen with NO STRAPS either for the child&#39;s waist or to secure the booster to the chair. I mean it would have been truly, seriously dangerous for me to put my child into this seat on such a high chair. And I felt like the waitstaff could not care less and just stood there staring at us while we tried to work something out. I ended up having to leave and take our son to a nearby park to eat his (packed) dinner while the rest of the family ate. And then came back and shoveled down some food that was ordered on my behalf while someone else in our party bounced the little guy on their lap.

It sure was on FAT TUESDAY! (who can resist a place named Beef Shack anyway?).

A perfect excuse to indulge in all things fattening with reckless abandon and leave your inner skinny girl in the closet...lock her up and throw away the key...

I mean c&#39;mon...this used to be the former Zippy&#39;s &#34;Home of The Cheezy Beef&#34;..
A joint I had scrumptious scandalous cheesy beefy memories of...Unrivaled by others. 
And yes, I was completely sad that I never got one last taste of Zippy&#39;s before it closed...

I was salivating this gloriousness again, hoping it would satisfy the zippiness in me, so
I hauled my little culo into the Drive-thru (gotta love drive-thru&#39;s) and placed my order to the awesome guy working.  Super nice &amp; no order hick-ups.  He even mentioned that fries come with Dog in case I didn&#39;t want a whole bag. I appreciated that. I Got -  Cheezy beef on garlic, (sweet &amp; hot peppers on side), Cheeze fries, plain hot dog....(no, my skinny girl didn&#39;t lose her mind, she was SHARING, not hoarding).  And yeah, I went a little cheezy...

Menu cuts to the chase. They only serve:  Beefs, burgers, dogs, one salad, grilled cheese and fries..that&#39;s it.  I dig small menus...whew.  I&#39;ll admit I browsed reviews here.  Some reported beefs where just like Zippy&#39;s, while others didn&#39;t.  Some said owners use the same recipe...my head was sort of spinning on what to expect...yet, I remained a hopeless Zipmantic, confident this love would return to me..

Was it unrequited?  :*(

While the tantalizing soft garlicky inner grilled bread and cheesy mozz layer didn&#39;t leave me, the beef did..The most important element...Although it didn&#39;t COMPLETELY leave me, the beef itself didn&#39;t remind me of Zippy&#39;s.  They didn&#39;t skimp on the beef that&#39;s for sure..I have no &#34;beef&#34; there. It was a hearty sandwich, but beef was dryer and not as thin and tender as I remember..

Beef was thicker sliced and had a sponge-like texture. SORT OF reminded me of Arby&#39;s texture and was average quality...It WAS tasty, but by no means did it relive my memories....

Fries were almost identical to Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s, but BETTER.   Hot &amp; heaping Fresh cut in a brown paper bag sporting oil stains left and right...I&#39;m no fryaholic, but these were so good (sometimes Crinkle doesn&#39;t cut it).  I know people who&#39;d kill for these fries.  The cheese sauce was too tangy &amp; robust for my fries.  Dog was covered in fries (another flashback to G&amp;J).  Soft steamed bun.  Didn&#39;t taste like a Vienna dog.  I know there&#39;s different grades out there...what I&#39;m sayin is, this dog was for the dogs....little flavor, little snap. I&#39;d hit Portillo&#39;s for dogs (or an awesome Italian beef).

Beef Shack might be where its at for beef....and only beef, be it a burger or cheezy B.
A bit pricey, but worth a taste.  They offer Mini beefs which is great when your inner skinny girl is with you and needs a cheat day....or you just wanna give it a go...

As far as true cheezy beefs go, the perfect amount of yummy melted cheese will satisfy the cheesiest of tastebuds. The bread is pretty great. Not bad for Beef Shack..",23/02/16,411,3,1,5,-31,7.427100000000001,5.736000000000001,1.988,23.275000000000002,No,3248

I tried again Friday after taking a detour home from work that had me passing by.  I went through the drive up this time instead of eating inside.  
First impression...the guy taking the order and (I&#39;m assuming) the same guy at the window was a jerk!  Seriously.  A tiny bit of kindness can go a long way.  Especially since I didn&#39;t make any special requests on my order.   
I certainly felt like maybe I was bothering him by coming to spend my money there. 

But on to the food.   Again, I&#39;ll comment that it is just really expensive compared to other Italian beefs in the area and the name of the restaurant leads you to believe they would be the best.  

And the fries.   Good god, could you all please learn how to cook French fries?  They were a bag full of oil soaked fries.   You could tell even by looking at them.   Limp.  Just, disgusting.   I took a picture to share with you all.  

The only saving grace of this wasted meal was the sandwich itself.   Still seriously lacking in the amount of beef they put on the sandwich.  But the bread is different than what is used at other places and I prefer this bread.   The beef was flavored better than I recall from last time.

It&#39;s massive popularity I have always found curious considering the food they have on tap. That said, this Hoffman Estates heavyweight does serve up some pretty good grub for it&#39;s type, I just don&#39;t drink the Kool Aid like most folks around here. 

&#34;The shack&#34;, as it is referred to colloquially, serves up Chi-town fast food favorites. Dogs, polish, burgers, cheesy beef, Gyros, etc. are all here, and prices are dirt cheap. Depending on the day you show up, you can score a double dog with fries and a drink for under 5 bucks. It&#39;s exceedingly difficult to have problems with that level of value. The fresh cut fries here are sensational, assuming you show up at a time when they are relatively fresh. 

The Shack is always busy, with almost no exception. If you show up here around noon on a weekday there will be a line out the door. That said, they fire out food to customers with military precision, so you will never wait long. 

Food quality here has always been consistent, but I just do not understand the big deal. If you have never been here before go with a dog combo. It&#39;s tasty and comes loaded up with zing relish and sport peppers. All dogs also come with fries plastered all over the place.

Beef:
The beefs are very flavorful and come with the standard offerings (hot/sweet peppers, au jus) but what I also appreciate is that they offer a &#39;half&#39; size. Sometimes I want an Italian beef, but a whole sammich is too much....especially when ordering fries (and potentially a shake). On one occasion, I requested sweet peppers and only got one pepper. It was a bummer, but I&#39;ve forgiven them since then and not too worried about future visits.

Fries:
Greasy, fresh cut fries; so awesome. Dunk &#39;em in ketchup, or eat them plain; you can&#39;t go wrong. If you REALLY want to up the ante....go for the &#34;Shack Sauce&#34;. You won&#39;t be disappointed, however it MAY ruin fries for you at other locations. I&#39;m giving you a fair warning.

Bigger than what you would expect from a beef joint. Meat was tender and juicy. Lots of mozzarella on this sandwich. The fries were hand cut and I ordered them with cheese. 

My daughter (11) had the grilled cheese sandwich. She&#39;s my picky eater but she devoured the entire sandwich without a complaint. 

My son (9) had a plain burger. The kid is not big on cheese (he does not get this from me lol). The burger was char grilled and very good.

My husband ordered the combo with cheese. Another winner

I recently returned here after a few months.  My first meal here was a five star experience &amp; after returning here agin I got to experience the same five star meal.  

Right away a few things stand out to you as you walk in the doors.  The place doesn&#39;t look like some cheap fast food restaurant.  Most hot dog &amp; beef establishments just throw the place together &amp; call it a restaurant &amp; cut costs on making it look nice but not this place.  This place looks like they spent a lot of money just to make it look nice.  The wood paneling gives it an upscale high class look which I can&#39;t say I have ever seen with a restaurant that serves hot dogs &amp; Italian beefs.  

Next, the food which is the most important part is also the best.  They offer three different types of Italian beefs.  They offer a regular Italian beef, a &#34;cheezy Italian beef&#34; &amp; lastly a &#34;cheezy beef on garlic.  All of the beefs are available in a regular size or a mini size for almost half the cost of the regular.  The regular is a very generous portion.  The &#34;cheezy beef&#34; on garlic&#34; is hands down the best Italian beef sandwiches I have had &amp; that is saying a lot especially with the competition in town.  

I usually am not a huge fan of getting burgers when I go out but the burgers here are delicious.  The burgers are Angus beef &amp; it is a pretty large portion.  They also have a special sauce called &#34;Shack sauce&#34;.  This sauce is a game changer.  Every time I have been here I have asked for extra sauce &amp; I usually order something else just to dip it in the &#34;Shack sauce&#34;.  For drinks you can get a 24 oz cup for $1.89 &amp; it is fountain drinks so you can have as much as you want.  

The hot dogs here won&#39;t disappoint either.  All of the hot dogs are Vienna beef.  They offer two different kinds.  They have the regular dog or the double dog.  If you are looking for an option that is healthier than Italian beefs, bugers or hot dogs, they do have a Shake salad.  As for the french fries they are all fresh cut &amp; seasoned very well.  

This particular Beef Shake location does have a drive thru.  

Overall you can&#39;t go wrong by eating here.  They don&#39;t have a hundred items on the menu because the items they do have on it have been perfected.

It&#39;s new &amp; improved &amp; I think for the better. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of Zippy&#39;s and although Beef Shack uses the same building, some of the same menu items and apparently has the same management, I like it much better. Michele K. is right on that the interior and exterior remind me of a quick service restaurant I&#39;d find at Disney World. To me, that&#39;s not a bad thing at all although I could see how it could put some people off. 

The menu is simple - burgers, dogs, beef &amp; fries. I went with a couple of coworkers and had myself the double dog. Not a bad deal at all for under $5 plus it came with a very generous serving of fries. I loved their fries! They were beyond greasy...but...they&#39;re fries. It&#39;s to be expected. The flavor and cut of the fries was spot on but just know the grease on the fries may just eat through the bag. I recommend getting a tub of their special Shack Sauce to dip the fries in. It&#39;s much better than having plain ol&#39; boring ketchup. I got my double dog plain and it had standard Vienna beef hot dogs on a plain bun. Nothing fancy, but I enjoyed it.

I can only vouch for the cheezy beef on garlic. It&#39;s the best! The combination of the bread, garlic flavor, roast beef, au jus and mozzarella is heavenly.

The only reason it&#39;s 4 instead of 5 stars... I desperately miss the waffle fries that zippy&#39;s had. Beef shack now has hand cut fries done in peanut oil I think. The times I&#39;ve got them they are hit and miss. Sometimes over done and soggy, sometimes light and crispy perfection.

The Beef Shack just opened and although the name goes perfect with the B-52s song, I found the experience to be mediocre. The remodeling is a huge improvement from the previous Zippy&#39;s and the restaurant is well staffed and managed well but the food itself didn&#39;t quite leave an impression. 

What&#39;s better than a regular Italian beef? Cheesy Italian beef with sweet peppers on garlic bread. We also got the angus cheeseburger and fries with the Shack sauce.

Well.. not at this one but we&#39;ll get to that a little later We&#39;ll start this review with a story. A long long time ago I visited a place in Saint Charles called Beef Shack and I was pleased with the depression dog and fresh cut fries at a good value. Some time later I saw that a long time favorite spot of mine called Zippy&#39;s had closed, but in its place there was a sign mentioning a new Beef Shack would be opening soon. As the days went by Beef Shack eventually opened up and one day I finally had the opportunity to stop by this beef shack and give it a try.

In visiting the Beef Shack I decided to go with the hot dog that I had at the other location along with a cheesy beef. The inside had the same rustic wood decoration of the Saint Charles location and I had expected my food would be the same in quality. I placed my ordered, looked around at how they re-decorated and waited for my order to be ready. Besides adding lots of wood paneling they replaced a lot of the tables with and added stools with cow patch looking art on them.

Once my order was ready it was time to dig in, the first thing I tried was the hot dog. It was absolutely buried in fries. These were fresh cut fries but didn&#39;t taste quite as good as the ones served at the Saint Charles location. They were very greasy and had a strange cooking oil flavor that really didn&#39;t sit well with me. After I buried my hot dog out of the pile of fries I noticed it was covered with grease and residue from the  fries. The bun was almost completely soaked, my hot dog was a natural casing sausage with very very light condiment application except for relish which was excessively added. The bun was seedless and there were a few sport peppers on it. Despite quality ingredients being used here this was a messy hot dog, a sloppily prepared hot dog, and just a bad hot dog overall.

Now being called the Beef Shack I thought, &#34;well maybe the Cheesy Beef here is better&#34;. Well, I opened it up to see some almost hardened mozzarella cheese on the outside. The bread was tasty but a bit on the hard side with spots that were soft and spots that were too firm. The beef itself was very very bland, it could have been Arby&#39;s roast beef only I think that has a little more flavor to it. They were also very conservative in the amount of beef they put on the sandwich, this combined with the less than optimal bread meant you tasted the bread more than the beef. The cheese was okay but wasn&#39;t soft in any way shape or form and had the consistency and appearance of that elmers glue you would use to make projects with in elementary school. My overall opinion is that this was a bad Beef sandwich though it was not worse than the hot dog which was ruined by grease from the awful fries. 

I&#39;ve definitely had worse hot dogs, but going in with expectations of this being like the Saint Charles Beef Shack I came away thoroughly disappointed. I definitely miss the Zippy&#39;s that was previously occupying this spot as they had excellent chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. If you want a huge pile of nasty greasy fries and bland beef served on questionable bread then Beef Shack in Hoffman Estates is the place for you.

After what seemed like years, they finally opened their doors and I immediately noticed a lot of traffic through their tiny parking lot and drive-thru lane. Last night I finally had the chance to check it out.

A quick Google search will reveal that the owners of the old Zippy&#39;s also owns Beef Shack so Beef Shack menu items and &#34;mini&#34; serving options reflect this, albeit a much smaller menu. Beefs, hot dogs, burgers, fries, and salads are all that&#39;s on the Shack menu but the star of the menu is the same as it was for Zippy&#39;s: the cheezy beef. More specifically the cheezy beef on garlic bread.

We ordered a cheezy beef on garlic, a cheeseburger, and fries with Shack Sauce.  The roll is toasted with the beef, cheese, and peppers loaded on top which results in that classic flaky, crusty goodness on the outside of the bread with a creamy, melty cheese layer on top.  And the garlic bread...they mean garlic when they say garlic. I was afraid I would only get a hint of garlic flavor but this was a pungent kick of you-obviously-don&#39;t-have-a-date-tonight flavor.  And it was so much better than I remember the Zippy&#39;s version was. My only complaint was the bread to meat ratio was meager bordering on pathetic. Skimping on the beef is NOT the Chicago way and sincerely disappointed in that regard.

The burger was fresh and hand made and the bun was obviously fresh because both the patty and bun were pillow soft.  The toppings included cheese (optional) with lettuce and tomato with a microscopic dab of chipotle mayo. Where&#39;s the onion? I can only guess that they make the burger this way to avoid masking the flavor of the juicy patty and I can appreciate that style. My only complaint with the burger is the hefty price tag of $5 for such a small patty that is served a la carte. A small serving of fries to accompany it would justify the pricing.

They serve fresh cut fries here which you can see being cut and put directly in to the fryer. I love fresh cut fries but we has a few clumps that were undercooked which indicated that fries were overcrowded in the basket and not properly rotated while cooking. That&#39;s just a matter of method though and quality would obviously change between chefs.

While the Shack Sauce was fantastic and reminded me of a better version of McDonald&#39;s &#34;special Big Mac sauce,&#34; I was sorely disappointed to find that the tiny container I received was only half filled.  Really, guys? You&#39;re going to actually charge me 50 cents for sauce and then short me on the quantity? First of all, a sauce that lacks originality and is likely made from condiments that are readily available shouldn&#39;t be charged for and if it is charged for it should be served as a significant amount so that the sauce doesn&#39;t dwindle to nothing barely halfway through the only size order of fries available.  That&#39;s okay though, you won&#39;t trick me again next time. I&#39;ll just ask for some free mayo, ketchup, and relish on the side and make my own Shack Sauce, thankyouverymuch.

Overall a great meal, although expensive at $16 and change for three items and no drinks.  The interior and exterior projected unique, designer level ambiance which includes industrial touches such as pre-rusted corrugated metal awnings and extensive use of metal piping on everything from door handles to railings.  Everything is brand spanking new so everything is sterile clean, unlike the greasy dilapidated mess Zippy&#39;s condition was before closing.

beef-shack-hoffman-estates-hoffman-estates,David B.,yqInzISRAGgOVJaY1_DB8w,PZYXcHMyux-c2Epq0-_qzg,"So I live nearby and have been watching the renovations to the old Zippy&#39;s that was recently closed with mixed emotions. I used to love Zippy&#39;s and it&#39;s been around here for many years. And waffle fries!

But I recently learned that the owners of Beef Shack are associated with the Zippy&#39;s family and they have a very well reviewed location (as of this posting) in St. Charles. So why not, let&#39;s give them the benefit of the doubt.

Went through the drive-thru at this location and the service was very quick, efficient and friendly. Much appreciated. Their menu is basically a slimmed down version of Zippy&#39;s, and although some favorites of mine are no longer available (chicken gyro, waffle fries, onion rings), I&#39;ve always thought that a more simplistic menu at a place like this promotes better quality in the selections that they do have available (see: In-N-Out Burger).

I grabbed a cheesy beef on garlic bread with hot peppers and an order of fries. The fries were crispy and really well seasoned, fresh cut fries will always be a favorite of mine and Beef Shack does them really well. They also have a &#39;Shack Sauce&#39; available for an extra 50 cents which they said is some sort of Thousand Island dressing based dipping sauce. 

The beef sandwich is served on traditional Turano bread and they don&#39;t skimp on the cheese, which you&#39;ll find oozing out of the side of the sandwich. The beef is pretty well seasoned, but I must agree with another reviewer who said that they don&#39;t give you quite enough meat to get to the optimum bread to beef ratio. Because of this, the sandwich is just a little bit duller than it could be. Overall, though, the quality of the food is better than Zippy&#39;s has been over the past few years and that&#39;s what we&#39;re going for, right? I&#39;ll be making regular stops at the Beef Shack for sure!

Very limited menu, which is OK if everything else is great - but that is not the case. Hot Dog is just OK, comes with fries. $5 for a hamburger?

Fries are VERY greasy, I mean wring them out greasy, disgusting. Couldn&#39;t finish 1/3 order and I&#39;ll eat just about anything.

Shack Salad, similar to a chopped salad, had almost NO CHICKEN, 3 tiny pieces that I could find. The online menu description says &#34;Topped with A CHICKEN BREAST&#34;. NOT!

However, they failed to put the fries and sauce in the bag. Luckily I realized it before I left. The first person didn&#39;t apologize (oops). However, they quickly got them ready and apologized for forgetting. 

My full order consisted of a Mini Cheese Garlic Beef (no peppers), fries and the special sauce and cost $7.22. The food was very very good and I would certainly order it again. In fact wish I had ordered the full beef since it was so tasty. The fries were in a good sized bag and had a great flavor. The special sauce was good but in way to small of a cup. They really need to work on that. I look forward to trying their burger and see how they do with that. 

I was happy to see they had Coke products, but no types of deserts. The menu is limited but have to say, I will be stopping by on regular bases after having had it once and as long as they do a few things very well they will do well and I&#39;ll keep stopping by.

After three or four minutes the steak finally arrived.. Cold..  Ok., so it was a great steak and the frites were super tasty, but that was a bummer.   

Not a game ender.

The confit duck and chicken entrees were five stars, and the duck liver mousse and escargot were also five stars..    The service and cocktails also would rate five stars..     

However serving a cold steak... Bad so. 4 stars.

We told the server about the steak and she was very gracious, and gave a free desert to take home..  Note..  We told her after as the steak finished as it was still tasty, and my friend decided to eat it..  They would have made a new one.

The staff was friendly and for the most part attentive. (Ricardo is just great! 5 stars for him) This is an upscale resturant with prices to match. My wife and I had the cheese and sausage plate and a drink each and our bill with tip was almost $60. The cheese plate is $24 which was short on substance, perhaps 2 or 3 oz. of meat and cheese and a big pile of grapes. 

I have two suggestions for management regarding staff. #1 no cell phones while on duty. Patrons should not have to wait for service while staff check their phone. #2 If you want to be upscale, be upscale, have the waitstaff and bartenders in all black attire, lose the blue jeans. The current black tops are classy, but not with jeans.

- the water and iced tea had a weird taste. Maybe it&#39;s the city water? It wasn&#39;t stale but it just tasted a touch different.
- we both thought the sandwiches could have benefited from less ham. We felt 1/2 the amount of ham used would have been perfect and not overpowered the sandwich. Same price point, less cost = more margin!

We came at 5:30p and were promptly seated and by the time we left, it was full. You&#39;re greeted with white tablecloths, and servers bring out crusty French demi-baguettes, creamy butter, and homemade olive tapenade. We enjoyed the $5 glass of wine special, then noshed on house salad with a creamy, tangy vinaigrette, And two kinds of tart flambes (ok, that&#39;s a fancy name for flat bread pizza): duck confit with goat cheese tart and the four cheese. Both were tasty. The pizzas were crisp but tender, the toppings flavorful and filling. The charcuterie and cheese platter for two at a nearby table was ample and looked delicious. Prices are high, especially for main courses, but they do offer a pre-fixe menu for $35. Will have to try that next time. Welcome to the neighborhood!
Updated 8/20/16: Went here again for an anniversary dinner for 6 people. It was incredibly noisy and difficult to have a conversation. Very bad acoustics. We were very underwhelmed by the main courses. The steak au poivre was not peppered enough. The seafood pasta was a huge disappointment due to lack of fish variety and bland flavor. We all hated our desserts. The strawberry shortcake was served with a hard shortbread cookie, there were no fresh strawberries and it was served with ice cream instead of whipped cream. The creme brl̩e was the worst. The sugar crust was too thick and the torch burnt the sugar. Burnt sugar is NOT tasty! Service was just ok. The food took a long time to come out.

However we had not been there in a few years due to our disappointment the last few times we dined there. So when Crystal Lake opened we though it would be a great chance to check it out again. Sadly we were again disappointed. 

The positives. The goat cheese salad always good. Good vibe in the place. It was packed. 

The negatives. When the waitress presented the skate wing, as soon as it was placed on the table, I thought, that does not even look appetizing. The best I could describe it is grey and drab. A large portion accompanied with maybe 3 shriveled string beans. I&#39;ve ordered skate wing before in a variety of restaurants, so I had some expectations. Francesca&#39;s in Barrrington does a nice job with it, when they do have it on the menu.  It tasted as it looked. 

We also ordered the pasta dish. Ok. Nothing spectacular that would make me come back and pay the high entree price. 

The strawberry shortcake. This version had some ice cream, whipped cream, sliced strawberries and then I guess the &#34;shortcake&#34; was this round biscuit that was set atop.  The biscuit was dry and tasteless. Good thing that there was enough of the other stuff to mask it. 

If we do go back, a big if, it&#39;ll be at the bar. A glass of wine and salad at most.

When we asked her about the beers on tap she explained a bunch were out and couldnt explain what had replaced them. My husband and I both ordered a beer and then decided to order some tater tots.  The tots were absolutely delcious and perfectly crisp.  We wanted the hot sauce on the side rather than lathering the tots in it.  This was a good choice because the tots remained crisp.

They are cooked to medium unless you specify otherwise, but they are always cooked perfectly. Great flavor and they are huge. The burgers also come with a side of tater tots, and really who doesn&#39;t love tater tots. I think they deep fry theirs or something, because they are amazingly crispy on the outside, not the soggy mess they can sometimes be at other restaurants. And if you&#39;re a real tots fan, the tot-chos are also great. But probably dangerous, because they are covered in cheese, jalapenos and bacon.

Overall I am quite happy with my visit. The food was delicious and the service was prompt and friendly. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for. No corners were cut.

For an appetizer we had the drunken Mexican shrimp and the flatbread. Not a fan of the flatbread, mostly personal taste. The shrimp was delicious. I highly recommend it. Just wish they gave you more.

For the meal I had the Parmesan crusted swordfish dinner. I&#39;ve never had swordfish before but they made my first taste special. It was delicious. Came with a side salad and some seasoned potatoes. I didn&#39;t like the salad much but the potatoes complimented the fish perfectly.

For dessert I had the Smore Budino which was basically a smore parfait. Layers of chocolate, graham cracker crust and toasted marshmallow on top. In addition I tried a glass of blueberry wine. I&#39;m not a big fan of wine, but that stuff was really to my liking. I might go back to just buy a bottle one day.

coopers-hawk-winery-and-restaurants-arlington-heights-2,Michelle C.,1NDsC7qr1iX9IBra-NVHIQ,4ae6ThSU5StErHkRokAgsg,"Happy Sweetest Day! My boyfriend and I visited this location on Sweetest Day this year. Very great experience! As we usually never have time to make reservations and wanted to have dinner at Cooper&#39;s Hawk I called around to the different locations. Most locations had 1 hour plus wait times. I called the Arlington Heights location and they had no wait! Not because they&#39;re horrible, but because this location is so extremely large! As every location is, it&#39;s very nice inside and relaxing amongst all the chaos with servers. The ambiance is excellent and simple. 

I ordered a few samples of wine. I believe they usually only give you three if I recall. I am by no means a wine connoisseur so I have no clue what I like other than I like it sweet. I could not find the right wine for ordering a whole bottle, so the server definitely helped in giving extra samples to find the right one. We ordered a bottle $22, which I don&#39;t think is outrageous for amazing quality wine.

We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. I don&#39;t think it was worth it because you get about 8 small slices of chicken and 8 lettuce wraps. We put two pieces of chicken on each wrap and ran out of chicken well before the wraps. We have also had their pork nachos before.  If you&#39;re going for amount of food for the value, I do not recommend these. The nachos you get about 6-8 chips with meat on them. If you ARE going for flavor for your buck, I highly recommend the nachos! The chicken wraps are good as well, I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with any meal here. 

For dinner, my boyfriend had the BBQ Ranch chopped salad and I had the Dana&#39;s Parmesan-Crusted Chicken. The parmesan-crusted chicken was not my favorite, but is by no means horrible. It was a little on the dry side. Being Italian, you like some sauce and extra cheese on your chicken ;). 

Oh, and our server... SOFT TALKER, but it made for an entertaining date when one of us could understand him and one could not.",17/10/16,216,4,2,5,28,5.524800000000001,4.228,1.308,21.463000000000005,No,2001

I have already posted a review regarding food and drinks at the Wheeling location and thankfully this location meets all the same standards.  Ideal for group gatherings or solo dates. 

Highly recommend calling in advance to book reservations. Have rarely seen this location not busy and typical wait times can exceed an hour. Luckily, waiting inside a wine place isn&#39;t the worse thing that can happen to someone but needlessly to say reserve yourself a table.

Another tip, make sure to check in your reservation upon arriving. Reservations are only held for 30 minutes and have learned the hard way when waiting for the rest of our party to arrive that our table was given up.

Prior to coming here I has made reservations through open table and added a note I was celebrating my birthday, without realizing this my fianc̩ called to see if he could a dessert or chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our table at the end of the night and the rep mentioned that there was already a note about it and it would be taken care of, perfect.

Upon arriving we were greeted and seated within a few minutes. Our server was friendly and our service was okay. The food was quite delicious. We started with the flavor packed pork belly toastadas, no wonder these are award winning, so yummy! I had the surf and turf, beef medallions and drunken Mexican shrimp while my fianc̩ went for the filet. You can definitely tell the beef were high quality cuts with the way it just fell a part in your mouth. The drunken Mexican shrimp were okay. The shrimp are small with barely any bacon. We enjoyed both our potato options: chipotle cheddar and Debbie. 

After we were done with our meal the server asked if we would like dessert or coffee. So somewhere along the way there was a miscommunication between our reservation and the server. We were extremely disappointed since Scott had followed up with the host as well. We ended up following up with Chris, the Manager who seemed overwhelmingly busy that he was trying to make it up to us but also get us on our way so he can take care of other diners. We left with a half filled box of sweets. He did mention for us to come back and he&#39;ll do something nice for us, but we will see.

The ambiance is very classy and exquisite. Makes you feel like you&#39;re in an upscale place but just without the upscale prices. Their wine is fantastic. We usually get the flight sampler so you can get a taste of about 6 different wines. It&#39;s very inexpensive. Everything we&#39;ve eaten from there has been good, including the Salmon, fish &amp; chips, and the jambalaya. The portions are also very genroous. The waiters and waitresses are VERY attentive, informative and VERY helpful. 

They have a membership program that allows you to get a free bottle wine every now and then and some other cool perks. My wife and I plan to enroll in it the next time we go. If you haven&#39;t gone, please go check it out.

I actually received a complimentary meal and glass of wine from last summer. So I finally decided to use it; I was actually going to go back to Naperville,  but this one was closer to where I was. First, this one was huge!  Huge parking lot and tons of space on the inside. We went around 4pm and there was a 15 minute wait, but when we were taken to our table there was a bunch of empty tables so didn&#39;t understand  the wait time??? 

Anyways, the bread is always good. I tried to order something  simple this time because  I didn&#39;t like the jambalaya last time. I ordered a veggie flatbread with the wedge salad which was delicious.  Everyone I went with enjoyed their meal this time too. 

Our server was nice and quick. Now, I mentioned the Naperville location  had a stale/weird smell like you would smell going to a say an Olive Garden or some kid-friendly restaurant where everything  is sticky and gross! This location did not have any smells!!! Very clean! The bathrooms could&#39;ve been better though. 

Don&#39;t know if I would be dying to go back since it&#39;s a glorified chain. The first experience still has jaded me from ordering anything too complicated.

Food recommendations-
Apps: Top 5 - Chef Matt&#39;s Mediterranean Share plate ...plenty to share
Asian Pork Belly Tostadas
Mexican Drunken Shrimp 
Cap rede Flatbread
Cooper&#39;s Hawk Calamari

Soup - my favorite is the Crab &amp; Lobster bisque
Sides - Betty&#39;s Potatoes &amp; Asparagus

3 of their pastas can be made gluten free which really makes it convenient for my niece 

Dana&#39;s Parmesan Crusted Chicken is super yummy and Ellie&#39;s Chicken Piccata is my second choice
 
Burgers &amp; Sandwiches - The Prime sandwich (to die for) and the Leonard Burger

My niece loves their Soy Ginger Salmon

Meats: I prefer the Maple, Mustard, &amp; Pretzel covered Boneless Pork Chop and Short Rib Risotto

Desserts: everything and the truffles

The best is the Life Balance Menu though. These are my top 4 options - Chicken Pot Stickers, BBQ Ranch Chicken salad, Grilled Tenderloin Medallions, and their Grilled Atlantic Salmon.

Pros:

-These are generally very nice venues, great place for a date or event. There really is an element of class at Coopers Hawk

-If you&#39;re a wine buff you&#39;ll be a fan. Promotional offers are a big draw

Cons:

-Dishes on my last visit were surprisingly bland. Granted it was for an event served family style, but flavor was definitely lacking for my level of expectation on such an establishment, and the main reason it gets a 3.

-If you&#39;re not a wine buff, this place will probably lose at least 40% of its charm

-Some people may find the atmosphere a little over the top. The place is huge and strikes me as a little over done, though it  generally doesn&#39;t bother me


Bottom Line:

Not being a wine guy, Cooper&#39;s Hawk really doesn&#39;t talk to me very well, and to be honest my last visit was a disappointment. I&#39;d never go out of my way to come here on my own, but I&#39;m not exactly against it either.

Their wedge salad is one of my favorite salads.  The wine is great and having tasting while you wait is wonderful. The problem I have is that my food has just never been that great. It isn&#39;t bad, but I usually don&#39;t leave thinking WOW my food was awesome. Why still 4 stars, you ask?  Because I will keep going back so the charm of the place is definitely there. This visit I had the crab cakes. There were just too many shells. My husband had the filet trio with different crusts and the Betty&#39;s potatoes. Although he enjoyed the filets, the potatoes were mostly bread crumbs. Like I said, the food is just always a little off. In my opinion, if they raised the bar on the food preparation a little, the place would be even more popular than it is. Let&#39;s face it, the place is always packed and reservations must be made in advance so I guess not a ton of motivation is there for food improvements. I will note that our service has always been wonderful and the pretzel bread you get prior to your meal is warm and delicious.

I had heard from friends about how great Cooper&#39;s Hawk is and I knew I had to try it. I had to see what all the rave was about. I&#39;m glad I did. 

My friend and I stopped in one evening to enjoy some wine and good food. 
Our first stop was straight to the tasting room. 
The tasting room is a Napa Style tasting room with an open feel. 
Our server, Tim G. did an excellent job introducing me to the Cooper&#39;s Hawk experience. He recommended a few wines to sample and explained the differences between the different wines. 

Keep in mind, I&#39;ve always been a vodka drinker and never developed an appreciation for good wine. Tim changed that. My friend and I enjoyed the wine and chatted it up. We truly had a great time. I enjoyed the wine and ambiance so much that I decided to sign up for the Wine Club. My favorite so far is the Orange Muscat. (January Club Wine)

The Wine Club entitles you to (1 or 2) bottles per month. You also receive some great perks, such as accumulating points and 10% any wine purchase. I get so excited every month when I receive the email from Cooper&#39;s Hawk that reveals the &#34;Exclusive Wine of The Month&#34;. (club members only) 

The food at Cooper&#39;s Hawk is outstanding, as is the service. 
I have gone back numerous times (2-3 times a month) since my first visit. 
My father and I even went to enjoy Thanksgiving Dinner and had a great experience, as usual. For food, I highly recommend starting off with the Potstickers or Pork Belly Tostadas, truly delightful! If you&#39;re in the mood for a sandwich, I always get &#34;The Prime&#34;. Prime Rib piled high on a soft bun with seasoned fries and a side of au jus. Pro Tip: Add Pepperjack Cheese and Jalapeno Bacon!

The service here is impeccable. The wait staff is always quick and responsive. They know their stuff and are happy to recommend food/wine if you&#39;re in the mood to try something new. We especially love the Grapevine Decanter that is set up at the table. We usually share a bottle so it works out great! 

Since my first visit, I can&#39;t stay away! (Good Thing!) 
I enjoy going in and picking up my bottle for the month and shopping around in the tasting room. Christmas shopping was easy this year! Once again, Tim G. exceeded my expectations. He helped me one night when I was looking for a nice gift for my father. My father LOVES wine. I wanted a nice Malbec gift set for him. However, there was not one on the floor. Tim happily assisted me and said he could hand-make one to my liking, complete with two matching wine glasses. 
The gift was made with care and truly perfect! My dad was so happy when he opened it on Christmas morning! 

I can&#39;t say enough good things about Cooper&#39;s Hawk!

I first started coming here more than two years ago after finding out about their gluten free menu at a benefit dinner.  The short rib risotto was amazing, PLUS knowing it was celiac-safe was a combination I fell in love with.  The plethora of wine options only made me love this place more, and it became my go-to for date night or a fancier dinner when I came home to visit family.  But lately, I&#39;ve left feeling super disappointed -- to a point where I&#39;ll probably never come back.

In December, this Cooper&#39;s Hawk, which boasts as not only gluten free but safe for celiacs, gave me an allergic reaction.  The food that night didn&#39;t taste like it normally does.  I don&#39;t know what happened.  But the reaction was so bad and caught me so by surprise that I mentioned it to a manager -- wanting to make sure no one else got sick more than anything else!  But I was met with confrontation and denial while my stomach was puffing up by the minute at the table.  I finally just had to point to my stomach and say, &#34;my stomach does not lie.&#34;  Not cool.  I was offered a card to come back for a free entree, and I swore I wouldn&#39;t use.  I was too scared to risk a reaction like that again, let alone after a $50+ meal. But... six months later, the memory had faded and I decided to give it a shot again.

When I came here for dinner this past week and used that card, while I didn&#39;t have a reaction, the experience was average at best.  They were out of bread (for the gluten eater at my table) and the waiter was brusk and slightly rude.  But what bothered me the most was that the risotto was completely different from how it&#39;d been the last 20 times I&#39;ve had it.  Now, instead of short rib atop a plate of risotto, it was 80% short rib mixed and mangled about 20% of risotto.  Did they run out of risotto too...?  Again, I left feeling like the value wasn&#39;t there.  The food and experience as a whole weren&#39;t what I&#39;d become accustomed to at Cooper&#39;s Hawk.

I used to be a huge fan of this place. I was a wine club member (now cancelled) and I frequently bought wine to take home with me.  It&#39;s still some of the best Cabernet I&#39;ve found in the area. But dining here? Frankly, even supporting this business after how things have been on the last two visits? Eh, I think I have to move on to find a new date-night dinner spot.",20/05/16,275,3,1,3,-34,2.9336999999999995,3.2600000000000002,2.239,23.500999999999998,No,2447

I&#39;ve heard great things about this location that I wanted to try it out and hopefully impress the out-of-towners.
I made reservations for 10 of us tonight and they were able to accommodate.
Once we arrived it was a big space plenty of parking and a big area for the wine tasting in the front of the house.
Since we had a big group there was a wine tasting table that if we order from their menu that they will be able to accommodate us. If you are part of the wine club (2 bottles of wine) then your wine tasting would be free with a guest each month!  If you were just coming in for the wine tasting, then it will be $7.00 each up to eight different types of wine to taste.  That&#39;s still a good price.
We were able to try different wines from whites to reds to desserts wines. They also offered us flat bread type crackers with our wine (good need something in my tummy). 
Our wine server Valerie, was very attentive and very polite as we continue to drink and get louder. It was a nice touch that the manager was coming by asking us how we&#39;re doing. 
We also ordered a chocolate truffle for each of us which was very very good I would get it again not overly sweet and not too bitter. One of my cousins order the chocolate dip strawberries and she said it was sweet and juicy perfect with pairing with her wine. The wine tasting was so good that we actually had two of the ladies sign up for their monthly wine club. Yeah group outing!
Once we got seated it was a perfect setting at a long table. There was also sections that have dividing walls for a bit of privacy. Kind of glad because we had a loud party of girls.
Our server Kelly was very attentive and patient with us as we were ordering our food including three bottles of wine from our membership club that evening.
All the dishes we ordered we sampled from each other from the risotto beef ribs very creamy and flavorful and the meat was very soft. I had the carne Asada flat bread which had a light sweet pesto sauce topped with cheese and the flatbread was a crispy cracker crunch which I really enjoyed. We order the sweet calamari with the spicy mayo on the side which was OK. We also ordered the crab cakes beignet with the Asian cabbage slaw which was pretty good light sesame vinaigrette dressing. We also ordered barbecue pork tostadas which was very tasty. We also ordered these shrimp appetizers with avocado which I didn&#39;t get a chance to try but heard from the other side of the table that it was pretty good. Also the main meals that we shared was chicken piccata with angel hair pasta was very tasty, also someone ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which was a lot of food and it tasted ok. My other cousin ordered the grouper with the steak medallions with roasted vegetables and mashed potato which I got to try and that was pretty tasty too. My one cousin ordered steak and fries which was a pretty large portioned meal.
The ambience is dim which can be a romantic setting and a modern space which is pretty big. They can accommodate your small to large parties if needed as well. They also have rooms on the second floor if you wish to throw a private party.
Overall, this was a very memorable and great experience with my family who I love dearly and looking forward to coming back here again with friends and family!",26/04/16,355,5,5,5,141,13.082899999999999,5.618,0.122,25.260000000000005,No,3435

Went with the rich lobster bisque soup, Big cup, delicious, LOBSTER.
Chose then to go with two entrees since they came with some veggies, and skipped the salad/flatbread option.

The Salmon had a light teriyaki sauce that wasn&#39;t salty or sweet and had some mustard notes,  about a 6 ounce lunch portion on a bed of creamy rough mashed potatoes with a light fresh cole slaw. Pecan breaded boneless pork was small imo, maybe 4 ounces and was on the same rough mashed potato bed with some light fried onion crisps and some sauteed mushrooms and veggies, nice add to the too small boneless pork plate.
Dessert was a larger than expected dark chocolate or white truffle.
We had leftovers of everything (weren&#39;t that hungry after the soup) even split a truffle. 

The $20 prix fixe included coffee and tea, and service was friendly and helpful. Lots of booth and seating options including private rooms. We had not been to this location b4. Reminds me a lot of the old Chart Houses. This location and corner has had a number of owners.

coopers-hawk-winery-and-restaurants-arlington-heights-2,Dominic L.,yLaRNythaaKMpsMrGKpOMw,XnQjMfYl3ZWaLCih7iRBvw,"My girlfriend and I came here for the wine tasting because we heard it was a really good deal. And it *is* a good deal, with caveats. 

One, it is cheap: $7 for the basic tasting (8 wines) or $10 for a bit of a different experience. We went with the $7 option. We tasted 4 whites, 3 reds, and a dessert white sangria. We were very well taken care of by the servers, who were all very nice and helpful. 

The 3 star rating comes because, frankly, Cooper&#39;s Hawk is the Starbucks of wineries. The wine itself was bland: all the whites tasted the same and all the reds tasted the same. That doesn&#39;t make them bad; in fact, they were decent or decently good wines. But there was no variety. I couldn&#39;t distinguish anything special about the wines I was tasting. And when I got home I uncorked some Montepulciano wine from Trader Joe&#39;s, which I thought was much better than anything I had at Cooper&#39;s Hawk. 

Cooper&#39;s Hawk, it felt to me, is trying too hard to be something it isn&#39;t. It is not a winery in the strict sense, no matter how much it wants to be, and the wine it does produce is focused more on mass production as opposed to quality, in my opinion (I&#39;m sure the corporate folks would vehemently dispute this). The product is akin to Starbucks&#39; Pike Place roast coffee: a non-offensive, mass appealing product that doesn&#39;t take anyone outside their palate&#39;s comfort zone. 

That said, I didn&#39;t try the restaurant or any of the food there (except a Bailey&#39;s truffle, which was tasty). I looked at the menu and it looked pretty good, and fairly priced. Maybe my review would change if I went to the restaurant part of Cooper&#39;s Hawk. But based just on the wine tasting, this place is a solid 3. 

It&#39;s a good deal and it&#39;s something nice to do. I just wouldn&#39;t do it regularly.",19/08/16,208,3,2,5,44,4.665,2.5370000000000004,0.821,16.642,No,1847

I had the shaved Brussel sprout salad and it was to the moon good!  So fresh and tasty. The blend of flavors in the veggies, cheese, vinaigrette and almonds was sheer perfection.  

The carne asada flatbread was also a wise choice. The only thing that kept it from perfection was the lack of steak. I knew it wouldn&#39;t be &#34;loaded&#34; but a little taste in each bite would have been nice.  It was crispy, full of flavor and beautifully presented. But it did leave me asking &#34;where&#39;s the beef?&#34;

Let&#39;s start with the staff (the wine is always a HIT OF COURSE!)  They were so nice and helpful!  I had a reservation but my friend was taking FOREVER ... so i decided to go to the wine counter for a &#34;taste&#34; :)  The lady at the counter greeted me with a smile and proceeded to take my order.  I wanted to try something new and she helped me do just that.  She asked about my tastes and all of the of the probing questions to get to a suggestion that may fit me and my palate best!  Yup... her suggestion was on point!

While standing their i realized, goodness I forgot to check in at the hostess stand.  I walked over, with my wine of course :) explained my situation (my reservation time had passed 30 minutes ago!)  He said no worries, I will see what I can do and come grab you from the wine counter.. he did just that!  Just in time for my friend&#39;s arrival.  

After being escorted to the table, the waiter was right on time.  He was very attentive and helped us with the ordering process.  We were there primarily for wine and appetizers.  After speaking with him he suggested the pitcher of Sangria Red! It was AMAZING!! 

We also decided on ordering the Egg Rolls!!! Holy Rolled Heaven!  They tasted great!

I have always heard good things about, so I was looking forward to it a lot.  The service was great from the hostess, waitress and all other staff.  My only complaint was the food.  I got the short rib grilled cheese.  It was tasty, but I felt like I was eating a kids meal.  There was very little short rib in it.

I tried it out again this past week, I didn&#39;t leave as satisfied as I was hoping for. To begin with, this place was PACKED, especially for a Tuesday evening. The wait for 2 of us was 1-1.25 hours. We ended up finding a seat at the bar area right away, so that was nice. We started off with some wine and warm pretzel bread. I love love love the pretzel bread here, especially when its served hot from the oven. I could probably make an entire meal from it, some butter, cheese and wine. Their wine selection is definitely great, and I always enjoy trying their different options. Regarding the food, we tried the butternut squash enchiladas this time - I wasn&#39;t very impressed. There also seemed to be  chunks of ginger in the mix, which overtook any other flavor in the dish. The side salad of mixed vegetables was good and I enjoyed it. The Caesar pesto salad is always delicious, and the caprese flatbread is at par level with most caprese flatbreads that you can get at most places (nothing out of the ordinary).

Drinks: I tried a sparkling rose and the sunset punch. They are known for their large selections of wine, and if you order a bottle of red wine it comes in a huge wine aerator pourer thing- really cool.

Mediterranean shrimp salad: a little too olive-y for my taste but otherwise very fresh and light so perfect for an appetizer salad to share! 

Surf and turf: salmon and filet medallion were the perfect choices for this dish. There was a little too much sauce on the salmon, but the Parmesan crusted filet medallion was very delicious and tender. Cooked perfectly medium rare. The roasted veggies and potatoes were also a great pairing to the dish. 

Other dishes ordered at the table: blackened ahi tuna (mmmmm so so good!), grouper (another excellent seafood dish), and strip steak (I personally liked the filet better).

Dessert: birthday dessert had a nice fudge truffle (perfectly rich) and chocolate covered strawberry. How delightful!

There are two options. The standard monthly sheet and the sweet wines. You are allowed to taste 8 wines and you can combine different wines from each sheet for a total of 8 wines. The prices is $7 which is a great price. 

They serve what I think was pretzel bread and butter as you are seated it comes hot and ready to munch. 

One must try the egg rolls. I totally forgot to take a picture but they are plentiful (6 or 7) on the plate with an Asian slaw and three sauces all are fantastic. 

I didn&#39;t find it to be over priced but the wine like at any restaurant is expensive which is why we ordered sangria to get the most bang for our buck. 

For my entree I ordered the Dana&#39;s chicken that came with a side of cheesy potatoes, and garlic green beans. I loved every bite and had enough to take home for the next day. 

I was not in the mood for steak so I decided to skip it. But I hear it is really good from this place!

Skipped desert because we were too full. I did see another table order desert all of which looked delightful. 

My only negative was the parking. At peak times it is difficult and be prepared to walk. There are enough spaces but the parking lot is large and it is a distance if you get stuck far away from the entrance.

Barrington, I was excited to see how this location compared. Replacing one of my favorite restaurants (Pappadeaux), I had to be sure this standardfor CH kept.

I dined for lunch on my birthday. Beautiful interior, in a 360 degree fashion. Perfect setting for a nicer lunch or dinner. Prices for lunch run about $12-$15 a plate, where the nicer dinner or larger plates are anywhere from $20-$30. 

My typical pick: 8 oz. filet mignon with a parmesan crust, broccoli, and Mary&#39;s potatoes. I ask for horseradish cream sauce- and without problems, they oblige. My steak is always cooked at a perfect medium. A marriage of a seasoned flavor on the outside, with a juicy, tender-pink inside.

Wine. Oh, the wine. you can sample one, sample many  (in a flight of 4), or even become a diehard fan, and opt for the wine club. CH allows you to sample 4 glasses before committing to one. Wide range, from moscato, to sangria, whites,  reds, sparkling, and dessert wines. They&#39;ve even got moscato (although I prefer d&#39;Asti). You really can&#39;t go wrong. 

My personal wine favorites are the sweet sparkling red, ice wine, and the night jar. But my tastes lean towards sweet, or rich. The pinot noir comes in a regular and a luxe edition.

Service is always impeccable. Friendly, knowledgable, and usually some eye candy for waiters.

I have to give it a 5-star review, because it&#39;s a place I keep coming back to for more. I&#39;ve had cheese plates, appetizers like the tostadas.. even the complimentary bread is amazing. a favorite dessert of mine is the banoffee pie, which is like an adult banana pudding on a graham cracker crust, with a mix of toffee, caramel, and whip cream. For a lighter dessert, you can do a medley of chocolate covered strawberries (there&#39;s a varying selection).

Start-to-finish, nothing I&#39;ve had has ever disappointed. On top of that, they are consistent.

Walking in I did not realize this was a chain establishment, as so I was immediately impressed with the set up and atmosphere. Everything is very slick, you see.

Once you come through the doors you enter a fairly large room with wine, wine accessories and other items which would make great gifts. The dining room itself is dimly lit and tastefully decorated. Despite the high ceilings the noise level is low. 

The menu consists of dishes with a recommended wine pairing alongside it, the wine recommendation refers to a particular bin and of that bin you make your choice of libation. 

I started out with a blanc de blanc as aperitif, it was crisp, dry and I really enjoyed it. Our friends ordered the chicken potstickers and pork belly tostadas for the table. I loved (with a capital L) the tostadas. The pork belly was tender soft and it&#39;s pairing with fresh sliced avocado made the little bites perfectly creamy and addictive. The potstickers were pan-fried and served alongside a flavorful coleslaw.

I had trouble deciding on my main course as most items on the menu sounded wonderful. I opted for the short rib risotto, served with earthy mushrooms, fresh parmesan shavings and white truffle oil. The short rib was braised perfectly- it was fork tender and it made me a very happy diner. All of us ordered meat so we enjoyed a bottle of cab to accompany our meals. The bottle was poured into a very cool (and effective) table aerator.

They(my parents) knew it would be immediate family but the aunts/uncles/grandparents were supposed to be a surprise. So, we made a reservation for 7:00 dinner, we all arrived on time, ten minutes early.... checked in with the hostesses and waited.... we asked the hostesses how much longer our table will be, since it was already 7:15, she replied with &#34;not much longer&#34;.....then we waited some more... and we waited and waited..... Needless to say the surprise wasn&#39;t such a surprise when my parents walked in and saw everyone waiting in the lobby, and then they got to wait with us some more! 55 minutes passed and were finally sat. It didn&#39;t seem like there was any reason why we had to wait almost an hour PAST our reservation... especially with my grandmother who is 86 years old.... When we were(finally) sat, our server apologized  for our wait and she even gave us a few appetizers on the house. The food was good. I had the tuna and tried some of a few other dishes. Service was good too. I just don&#39;t understand why such a large establishment would make a reservation wait an hour AFTER their reservation... what is the point of reserving a table? Anyways, just because of this first and probably last experience, I will not be back. There are so many more places I would much rather spend my money for great food AND great service.

coopers-hawk-winery-and-restaurants-arlington-heights-2,Jessica K.,hbbCbKz_q4ZYakEk0iInlg,8VvI0mt3MmHY6SrvGj-zWw,"So it was my boyfriends birthday and we wanted to try something new, he had driven past this place a few times and so we googled it and saw the menu which looked good, so we made a reservation! This was a huge mistake !! We get there and were seated at a table for two which was fine, then we sat for another 8 minutes before we were ever greeted mind you it wasn&#39;t busy and there were servers everywhere ! Finally our server comes take our drink order and after another long time we finally got our drinks , which he never offered us straws ! I ordered a turkey burger with mash potatoes and my boyfriend ordered a steak entree , the waiter asked him if he wanted soup or salad assuming it came with the meal how the server asked us , it didn&#39;t and his small Caesar salad was 6 extra bucks ! We got our food and my turkey burger came with fries not the mash I ordered our server said he would bring me the mash ASAP .. ASAP means 5 minutes later from a different server ! My burger was DISGUSTING !!! Soggy mushy and horrible after taste, I&#39;m a server and I don&#39;t complain but this was like a dog food burger ! I told my sever he took it away offered something else I said no , never once did a manger stop by to see how things were going or apologize for the food!! Very unprofessional ! My boyfriends meal was ok nothing to ride home about ! We ordered dessert which was their chocolate cake and 2 chocolate strawberries , the cake was good and the strawberries were garbage ! At 2.99$ each you would think you would get a juicy big one , nope two small disgusting strawberries ! Our experience was horrible and the food service and atmosphere was horrible and pathetic ! The management needs to learn how to mange and take care of their guests .... Very disappointed will never be back and never recommend this place to anyone EVER!!

So we went back because after my complaint we got Free dinner wine and dessert comps so we decided to give it another shot, and my boyfriend and I are very happy that we did! We had Teagan who was our server who was absolutely phenomenal! she was very friendly super nice never had to ask for anything drinks were always filled she was very knowledgeable of the menu she was great! My boyfriend got the filet mignon and I got spaghetti with meatballs we also got French onion soup and tortilla soup and for dessert got the Cooper&#39;s chocolate cake, everything was absolutely delicious the food was right everything came out perfect and the spaghetti and meatballs had such a good authentic taste I was extremely impressed, my boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well the soups were great and the cake was also delicious!!!

I&#39;ve been to several locations in my Midwest travels, and I like that I get consistent quality and great service each and every time I visit this establishment.

The house sauvignon blanc has become my go-to choice here. However, I&#39;ve tried some of the other whites, reds, and seasonals; and have enjoyed most of those as well. The gnocci carbonara is also my go-to dish, for no reason other than carbonara, when done right, is the most relaxing sauce in the world. I catch myself making &#34;mmm&#34; sounds while I eat this dish, and neighboring tables probably think I&#39;ve lost my marbles.

Once in a blue moon, I allow myself to order the banana bread ice cream sandwich, and only when there is a gym available to me within the next 24 hours.

When we arrived for our 7:15 reservation, we waited about 10 minutes to get seated. There was a wine tasting area by the front desk, even though we did not take advantage of it, it seemed like people were really enjoying it. 

Once the six of us got seated, the waitress immediately came over. She was very friendly and knowledgeable about the dinner menu and the wine list. My sister is part of the wine club, and she had a free bottle for January, so she ordered the sauvignon blanc. They didn&#39;t end up finishing the whole bottle, but she was able to get it re-corked and take the rest home. 

Throughout the night the service was good and the atmosphere of the whole restaurant was great. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food that they ordered. I decided to go with the Life Balance Sea Scallops, which were served over a mediterranean sweet grape tomato relish, oven-roasted cauliflower, and fresh basil. The dish was really light and very savory. I would definitely get it again. However, the relish was a little bit onion heavy, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anyone who does not like onions. 

At the end of the dinner, the waitress brought a cute dessert for my sister with a candle, which consisted of some chocolate covered strawberries and some truffles. 

Overall, we had a great experience and my sister had a wonderful birthday. We would definitely go back again!",21/01/15,164,4,2,5,27,5.258100000000001,2.7230000000000003,0.265,13.011999999999999,No,1460

This is the first location we go to that is not in a mall area. Plenty of parking and absent of crazy mall traffic. We had a great experience with the wine member event. The only thing I would recommend is to extend time for servers a bit more so they have time to refill glasses and serve food. The barrel room holds many people and having only one person go around to fill glasses is not enough.

Very enticing very very enticing you get two free tastings per month by being a two club to bottle club member. The prices are reasonable about 20 bucks for a bottle of wine and they have ports how cool is that?

I met some girls there for dinner and we started off with a couple of tastings and got a nice glass of Malbec. Paired well with my vegetarian dish. Yum. 

I wasn&#39;t 100% thrilled with my dinner but it was a veggie night for me so I should just go with something different next time. I had the black bean veggie burger with jalapeno cheeseburger toppings. Without the meat  they bunned with lettuce instead of bread, so was good, it just was really crumbly, it&#39;s falling apart so I had to eat it with a fork; a  burger cannot be eaten with a fork.

A few of my friends mentioned this place when it first opened up near our house but we never bothered to check it out. Then we saw it featured on an episode of Check Please and thought it was interesting so we made a reservation on Valentines Day no less. 

When we arrived we participated in the Wine Tasting which anyone can try at the front of the restaurant. My husband and I love red wine but are not very knowledgeable so the tasting was definitely worth the time. We tasted 8 different wines and were given tips and notes on the best foods to pair with each wine. 

We had such a great time our server Ron offered the membership to us. You can become a member and get free wine tastings and bottles of wine every month for a membership fee. You also rack up points for money spent on dining and can redeem the points for a reward towards your bill. 

When the wine tasting was finished we were taken to our reserved table and enjoyed a delicious meal. Typically when you visit a winery the food isn&#39;t up to par but the food here is excellent. They have something for everyone but my staple is the Short Rib Risotto which is sublime.

What started out as a wonderful evening with a tasting for 6 hosted by Kate (she is adorable and friendly and so down to earth!) turned into a night of jaw-dropping comments, eye rolling and general lack of respect from our server, Chrissy. Things started out okay as we ordered a bottle for the table, but then quickly went downhill from there.
1. Chrissy came around to ask if we had settled on any appetizers, to which I said, &#34;No, I think we&#39;ll just have the bread.&#34; When I said this, she rolled her eyes and said, &#34;YEAH, I&#39;ll bring the bread.&#34; My guests and I were appalled.
2. When she came back for our orders, I told her, &#34;I&#39;m going to do a couple smaller plates for dinner (the soup, shrimp and side of fries).&#34; To make pacing easier for her I said, &#34;I guess the soup can come out first&#34; to which she snobbily replied, &#34;I KNOW. I think I&#39;ve done this before!!&#34; Seriously?! Sorry for trying to make things easier for YOU. 
3. One of my guests needed a refill on his beer (which she hadn&#39;t been coming to check in on) so he said, &#34;Excuse me, ma&#39;am, can I please have a refill on this?&#34; Chrissy immediately shot back, &#34;YEAH. I GOT it. And don&#39;t call me ma&#39;am!&#34; And then walked away. When she came back, she told him again, &#34;Don&#39;t call me ma&#39;am, I&#39;m too old for ma&#39;am. Call me miss.&#34; (She was, I&#39;m guessing, in her 40&#39;s? And his use of ma&#39;am was out of kindness, not disrespect.)
4. When our food came, it was quite some time before she came back to check in. We had to tell her that my fries NEVER came. When she brought them, she set them down and told me, &#34;I&#39;m sorry about that ma&#39;am.&#34; REALLY? You make such a stink over someone calling YOU ma&#39;am, but then you call ME, a woman in her 20&#39;s, ma&#39;am?!?&#34; 
5. She came around and asked if anyone wanted coffee, which we said no. Granted, it appeared that one of our guests was in mid-conversation with another, and he didn&#39;t hear her. When she came around again, he said, &#34;I&#39;d like to order some coffee please&#34; to which she said, &#34;Where were you when I offered?&#34;
After that, she must&#39;ve realized that her job requires her to work for tips, because she was very polite around the time that the check came. She never once asked if we were wine club members, or if we wanted to be (which we are, and have been, loyally, for the past 3 years.)

Food- We started off with the Thai lettuce wraps and the prosciutto bruschetta.  The Thai lettuce wraps were good, crisp romaine lettuce and an array of sauces to dip in.  But the real star here was the bruschetta...    Oh.  My.  Gosh.  Literally on my top three best things I&#39;ve ever eaten list.  It came with arugula, prosciutto, mozzarella, ricotta, sundried tomato, and as always balsamic.  Every bite was creamy and the fattiness of the prosciutto blended with the creaminess of the cheese to make a heavenly combination.  For dinner I had the surf and turf with filet medallions and bacon wrapped shrimp.  It came with rich mashed potatoes which were smooth as butter and delicious.  The shrimp was nicely cooked and tasted great, even though the bacon was a bit overpowering.  The filet medallions came with a succulent steak butter on top.  I had to scrape a tad off because I was already so full from the apps.  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium and was seasoned nicely.  There was also a thin but prominent layer of au jus on the bottom of the plate that served as a sauce for any bite that needed a flavor boost.  I also tried a bit of the classic cheeseburger which was cooked medium well (as requested by another member of the party) but was still seasoned well enough that it held a good flavor.  

Service- Very polite and free refills on soda and iced tea.  

Atmosphere- Upscale but doesn&#39;t feel fancy.  I was still in my beach clothes and I didn&#39;t feel too underdressed.

If you happen to be stranded in the NW burbs and don&#39;t want to venture out to the big city, this place is a solid &#34;C&#34;. 
The wine selection is wide, and the quality decent.  We have bounded about quite a bit on the list and recommend the red blend.  Blended wines have a way of nicely mixing the grapes such that they average out to a good wine that should offend no one. Kind of like what Budweiser did for beer- not too hop not too malt, but just right. 
I think their short ribs are really good.  Slow cooked and tender, with a nice wine reduction sauce. They have to be a calorie killer as they rest upon some buttery, creamy mashed potatoes.  
The Asian glazed salmon also was good.  Fish was cooked perfectly on temperature.  Sauce was lil sugaray for me, but still solid. 
Our server had one speed.....ssssslllloooowww, but it was a Saturday night and I got the impression it might have been his first big night.  They don&#39;t seem to have runners or bussers, so in think this dude had to do everything.  Dirty dishes sat in front of the diners way too long and the water glasses ran dry on occasion.

I really wanted to like this place - and when I ate there I did - it does have a very cool rooftop and ambience which is nice for the downtown Barrington area. However - after eating here three of the four of us got so violently ill from food poisoning that not only can I never return to this restaurant but I highly doubt I will ever be able to eat sushi again. Our fourth friend who did not get sick did not eat any of the raw fish - she only ate the short ribs. Two of us were so sick we landed in the ER with severe abdominal pain and dehydration. As of now, our sickness has spread to two of our children and one husband.

For appetizers we started with Asparagus Beef Roll and Orange Duck. It would be tough to chose a favorite because we devoured them both with equal zeal.

For our dinner we ordered rolls to share. Shakou Roll was way too salty and our least favorite. The Green Dragon was a repeat favorite. While I found the Flaming Hamachi too spicy for my taste, I admit to being a light weight. The rest of our party loved it!

As I walked in, I was struck by two things--the loud decor and even LOUDER MUSIC. Think clubbing, a la 2002. The hostess greeted me and proceeded to take me to my spot--a single stool wedged between a full bar of people. Hmm....no thanks. I made a reservation, I&#39;ll wait for a table. She then tells me to go upstairs, wait at the bar and they will give me a table. I go up the elevator and as the door opened, I nearly fell back from the noise.

I nearly left, but I was tired and not in the mood to go elsewhere at this point. After about 10 more minutes, I was seated at a couch and table. 

Matthew greeted me and certainly put me a bit at ease. I order the seaweed salad and the 15 piece sashimi. The seaweed salad was good (and quite large), but the sashimi was terribly disappointing.

shakou-barrington-2,Scott A.,K-33joLzLIwr5T_RljBsTg,ZorQZYqDgu8LkQVQPpJFvg,"I&#39;m perplexed by some of the reviews here.   Simply put, I don&#39;t know of any place within 30 miles that rivals this place:  atmosphere, food, crowd, and service were all a notch above what you find in the burbs.    It doesn&#39;t completely achieve the personality of many of the places downtown but does a very commendable job of losing the sterile lifeless feel that is so epidemic in suburban restaurants; a condition that stems from the typical unoriginal formulaic cookie-cutter process usually used to create them all the way down to the menu items.

The Seven Spicy Ahi,(currently $11) a variation of the very popular spicy tuna over toasted rice dish which to my knowledge got its start many years ago in LA at the original Katsuya, was pretty much the best iteration of this well-know item I&#39;ve ever had beating Katsuya itself, killing E+O&#39;s, and being quite a bit better than Wildfish&#39;s; just to name a couple I&#39;ve recently tried.     I probably marginally prefer the modified version (mine) of the original Sushi Bombs at Kaminari but alas this is no longer available now that the ownership of Kaminari has changed hands.

I&#39;ve been to Skakou Barrington twice now and tried a large sample of the menu.   Not every dish was an absolute winner but I don&#39;t recall any I flat out didn&#39;t like or that wasn&#39;t at least on par with what I&#39;d get elsewhere around here.   Along with the Seven Spicy Ahi, I recall the Braised Short Rib (currently $24) also being outstanding.

Prices are EXACTLY what I would expect for a restaurant of the mid-to-high-end variety in this location with food averaging about $40-50 per person + drinks.   Since this is what I usually pay at any restaurant of this level in this area (Arlington Heights, Algonquin, Barrington, Schaumburg, etc..), I don&#39;t get all the comments on being over priced.   In any case, while you can dine here for less, expect to pay at least $40 per person + drink costs.

Bottom-line, I definitely recommend checking Shakou Barrington out.    

I have been to most of the places in the area, but if you do go to Shakou Barrington and feel there&#39;s another place within 30 miles that is better, please drop me a personal note.   I&#39;d love to try it!",31/01/16,252,5,1,3,-2,2.0706,1.786,0.81,11.404,No,2262

shakou-barrington-2,Rosanna P.,SovnbVXddUEdziqeLMuUCg,dKmqaPFTD1UhhVeS7AfbMQ,"My husband and I went to Shakou on a Saturday night. We had a 7:15pm reservation and decided to go a little early and have a drink at the bar. We got there at 6:45pm and the place was PACKED!! Always a good sign considering this is a newer place in the area. Unfortunately we weren&#39;t able to sit at the bar, but I was pleased to see the place busy. 

We ate like champs. I had their cucumberita, which was a little strong for my liking, but I drank it. I think their drink menu has some good variety when it comes to beer, wines, and cocktails, but it is a on the pricey side. 

Now, their dinner menu is awesome. Great selection. Almost too much to choose from. We were there with another couple and we all ordered 2 different rolls, and a sashimi platter. My stand out favorites were the flaming hamachi roll, spicy tataki, green dragon and the crunch melt. All were different and very fresh. 

I have to say, sushi is my favorite thing to indulge on, but Shakou is definitely pricey. Is it the best sushi I&#39;ve every had.....? Not really. It was great, like super fresh and very tasty, but for the price I guess I could go somewhere else and get the same quality for a fraction of the price. Just to put it into perspective, we were 4 people, we all had drinks, 2 rolls each and a sashimi platter and we walked out of there spending over $300....

shakou-barrington-2,Restaurant Vigilant E.,wqWJzo62RE8DmSYqFKmutg,YBvMaqbI3teR9ivYwMiSGg,"Shakou popped up in downtown Barrington about a year ago. This is the second sit-down sushi place in town, joining Sagano around the corner which has been around since the dawn of time. Shakou is a modern, trendy and buzzing atmosphere which is very popular. It is arguably the most trendy restaurant in town. Recently, they opened their rooftop dining facilities which are open air - I haven&#39;t been up there, but it looks awesome from the street and I have heard it is great.

I generally break sushi places down into three categories. You have &#34;stand sushi&#34; which would be like Sushi Station or even grocery store sushi...quick, convenient, sort of the hot dog stand of sushi, generally pretty affordable and pretty forgettable (assuming it is edible)....then you have what I would call &#34;mid-tier&#34; - these are generally family run places that have been around for a while - probably were super exotic in 1992, very traditional interior etc...and generally an OK experience, though again, often forgettable. Prices are a bit higher, but not too bad. Then you have &#34;Flagship.&#34;

Shakou falls into the Flagship category...the type of sushi place against all others are judged. I know of one other place within 15 miles that can match it&#39;s food....I would also put the food on par with just about any flagship sushi place in the Midwest. It is good! The variety is quite diverse - you can get your simple California role, or something super colorful that is probably on fire or something. The atmosphere is trendy chic and what I would call dressy casual....a pair of chinos and a colored shirt would be ok, you&#39;d not be feeling overdressed in a suit, a pair of nice shorts....your t-shirt and baseball cap, not so much.

The menu is pretty extensive and even if Grandpa Bill doesn&#39;t eat sushi, he can always order a steak or something. The downside if you are doing Maki here is the price. Generally they are 15 to 20 bucks a role here...and who orders one roll? You can easily run up a $40 or more per person tab without drinks....can you do it for less? Sure, but whole sections of the menu would be off limits. Let&#39;s just say I won&#39;t be ordering take-away from here any time soon....in my mind, this is really more of a special occasion, first date type of place. I am sure there are regulars who go there quite a bit, but I think it is cost-prohibitive for that - just me....for that special occasion though, or when you just want really well done sushi, Shakou fits the bill...one thing that does annoy me though - all their testimonial banners on their website from NBC and local media outlets...I am really hoping that this doesn&#39;t turn into a big chain - they already have 4 locations - in my experience, restaurants go way downhill when they try to have one in every town.",18/07/16,327,4,1,5,-4,6.508100000000001,2.807,0.5270000000000001,17.666000000000004,No,2831

I was there this past Saturday with a bunch of my girlfriends and we were in the upstairs bar/lounge area. We each placed our drink order and requested the bartender to split our checks(needless to say I can&#39;t think of his name -the guy with a Mohawk) apparently he had a problem with this and he showed this to us by rolling his eyes and saying &#39;whatever!!!&#39;. Sorry, we only asked 4 separate checks,that&#39;s too much to ask! We were shocked! One of our friends&#39; was from out-of-state, visiting us and we wanted to take her to one of the coolest places in Barrington, well I&#39;m sure this place made a great impact on her! We did not place another drink order with this gentleman and proceeded to go downstairs as our table was ready. The hostess wasn&#39;t very happy and commented that we should&#39;ve come downstairs earlier as she texted us a while ago. Wow, really? 
When we were seated, we made it clear to our server that we wanted our checks split to which she said,&#34;haven&#39;t you been here before? We can&#39;t do that.&#34; ( don&#39;t know her name either as I believe she did not introduce herself) 
So we got poor service from not one or two, but 3 employees at this Barrington location and I&#39;m not sure I would go there again or recommend this to any of my friends.

However, if you&#39;re used to even halfway decent sushi or service, you will be disappointed if you go here. Overpriced for starters, but I understand good sushi can be pricey. Beyond that, the service had terrible attitude. I picked up sushi to go, asking for an extra side of eel sauce. They took that to mean don&#39;t even put ANY eel sauce on any of the sushi. Forcing me to drive an extra half hour back and forth for it, only to be met with a manager who tried to convince me the roll DID have eel sauce (it did not). 
Finally with my eel sauce, the sushi was still very sub par, beneath even the lowest tier sushi I have ever had. Great idea, terrible execution. Will not be returning. Learn a little something from the incredible service at the brunch restaurant next door.

When we got there, the hostess immediately lead us to seating, only problem was it was at the Sushi Bar, which we didn&#39;t want.  She then sent us upstairs where there were &#34;tables available&#34;.  Only problem was the tables were for seating of 8-10, which wasn&#39;t really what we had in mind either.  

We had no problem waiting at the bar, that had been the initial plan anyway.  She indicated it would be about an hour, so we ordered some calamari and some edamame to go with our drinks and wine.  Bartender was great, she helped us with a wine selection.  Less than 10 minutes later and before our appetizers arrived, we got a text message that our table was ready (???)  Ok...The bartender  transported the appetizers to the table for us, but we were a little skeptical based on the initial 15 minutes here.

From there forward it was outstanding.  Table by the window.  Good service.   I had the Sea Bass and my wife had the Short Ribs.  Both were as good as it gets.  I would highly recommend either and reasonable portions as well.  The atmosphere is great.  I don&#39;t recall the wine, but it was good and the wine selections by the glass were plentiful.

Just before we were leaving, we ran into some friends that were coming in for a late dinner.  They had been here before and had also been to the Shakou in Libertyville.  They indicated they loved it as well.

Seriously?  Then, not being familiar with all the nuances of sushi and feeling adventurous to order different then my standbys, I asked Tim for a brief explanation of some of the menu items.  He was curt, rude and could not be bothered.   The night went from bad to worse.  My girlfriend never received her water, I ran out of water half way through dinner, I had to get up and find our waiter to ask for another bottle of wine (when he saw me he assumed we wanted our check).   Tim walked quickly by our table a dozen times, never stopped to check on us, never asked how the food was and he rushed by so we could not even stop him and we tried.  Then when we wanted our check, the bus person had to track him down.  He stopped plenty of times at his other tables, but those patrons were little older and he assumed they would spend more than us I guess.

The menu is gi-normous; loved the huge and creative variety of maki rolls plus the large selection of fish to choose from for both nigiri and sashimi entrees. There was also a sizable part of the menu that had non-raw fish selections(like steak, duck, chicken, etc.), which I&#39;ll probably add to my order list when I come in the next bunch of times. Our server Liz was very attentive, knowledgeable and engaging to work with--she even made some good white wine recommendations to pair with our sushi and brought out this huge slice of amazing chocolate cake with a lit candle without anyone in our party having requested it.The ambience was really cool too:if you were to turn Versailles into a minimalist 21st combination of restaurant and cocktail lounge, this is the place: high ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, black velvety-looking walls with matching booths, chandeliers, sexy metallic-finished bar/dining area, chill-out techno playing overhead--it was like no other sushi restaurant I&#39;ve been to in the &#39;burbs. The clientele was a mostly a mix of families with kids who sat in the half of the place that had the booths and larger tables; in the bar area, there were mainly young women celebrating someone&#39;s birthday, and middle agey-looking couples. There were even these 2 cute little old ladies who shared a front booth, who appeared to be enjoying the food and the vibe of the place. Overall, I would definitely come back here; this place really livens up downtown Barrington, so having grown up in neighboring Barrington Hills, it was great to see such a hip, vibrant business move into town!",28/02/16,216,5,2,5,43,4.760999999999999,1.2199999999999998,0.019,6.7620000000000005,No,1827

The girls at the front desk were extremely rude and didn&#39;t even try to be helpful. While I was discussing an issue with my reservation that I had made with one of the rude host girls, the manager or owner walked up. I thought my issue would get resolved at that point, but instead the owner/manager was even more rude than the host girl. I couldn&#39;t believe it! The food is very expensive and pretty much just like any other sushi in the area.

All of the sushi &#34;leaked&#34; on the plate, further suggesting something wasn&#39;t right with the fish.   The only thing worse than the food was the service.  The service was slow.  It took at least 20 minutes to get menus, then another 20 minutes to get our drinks, and then another 40 minutes to get the four selections of sushi we ordered.  When we finally got our food, two of the orders were wrong.  The server just rolled her eyes and took it away.  When she came back with the right order another 25 minutes later, never saying a word, just dropping the plates with a loud thump and a crappy attitude.

THRILLING... that sums up the feeling this foodie feels about Shakou coming to the village!
Not only was the food exquisitely presented but it tasted delicious too! We mostly had Sashimi and Nigiri. My litmus test for great sushi is, how well the fish stands on its own without sauces! I love the creative and out of the box rolls, however, they mask the true flavor and freshness of the fish. I am more than delighted to say the fish was fresh, flavorful, and at a perfect temperature. Also, the flavor of their rice was nothing less than perfection! Not only do they have typical Japanese restaurant cuisine but they have entrees with such meals as Chilean Sea Bass, Tilapia, and other delightful looking meals. I definitely plan on making this a regular dining experience. I held back on the desserts but they looked fabulous!

We went on a Saturday night on recommendation from my husband&#39;s coworker.  Had a wonderful meal and great service.  My husband got the rib dinner for $11.50, I got a half fried chicken dinner for $9.  We shared our meals and honestly, they were both absolutely off the charts yummy.  He had a beer, I had a couple of cocktails, and our bill was only $33.  Unbelievable value.

The building and interior are not anything fancy - remind me of a resort town bar in Wisconsin.  Lots of beer signs and simple decor.  I won&#39;t even suggest it needs updating because it is what it is and the decor is very bar-like. 

Our server was incredibly sweet and apologetic about the cash thing (no, we didn&#39;t know, and tried to pay with a credit card) ... she told us where the closest ATM was.

Today is her actual birthday and she specially requested sushi.  First, they understand NOTHING about what gluten is .  They awkwardly switched servers 3 times due to gluten confusion.  So as it turned out , hardly anyone served us---HORRIBLE service.  They forgot to bring my salad and the fried rice--which came with an up charge was undercooked and crunchy.  When I told them, they pretty much said &#34;oh, well--I tell the kitchen&#34;.  Nothing further.  I&#39;d explained it was a special night and that we were celebrating our daughter&#39;s  birthday.   This went totally ignored, yet we heard the loud cymbals as they clanged their way through the restaurant to celebrate other diner&#39;s birthday.  This was a horrible, over priced disappoint.

Then shrimp and veggies comes even before the main course and I chose the ginger dipping sauce. Very gingery I loved it! Boyfriend like their teryaki sauce best he also tried the mustard. My first time drinking SAKE! I had their cold dry one but it came in a cute bottle which I loved and they gave me a little glass. I liked the taste it went down easy. Boyfriend had Sapporo beer which he enjoyed it comes in a big bottle. WE both loved ending this huge meal with their green tea ice cream. Smooth and creamy. yum. So full but so worth it!

kyoto-japanese-restaurant-crystal-lake,Sam R.,FtDnLYWMiXBDNFoGTPjbTg,s3HbphvUdgVZROe7cg7SdQ,"Okay food, APPALLING customer service!!!!!

We made reservations almost six weeks ago for 11 people to celebrate two birthdays; I have a very serious chronic health condition, and was, unfortunately, unable to attend at the last moment...which was upsetting, as none of us had ever been there and I was incredibly excited to go celebrate with my family! 

When my family got there, they were harassed for over five minutes for having only 10 instead of 11 people - the staff was incredibly rude, complaining over and over and OVER that accurate reservations are important.  THEN they treated them poorly the entire time (presumably because of the &#34;incorrect&#34; head count), and continued to complain about the &#34;missing person&#34;.  And they brought the check before dessert even arrived!  My husband went to place and order for me to go (I was sooooooo excited to try their food...I wanted sashimi so badly last night; I had been looking forward to my husband and brother-in-law&#39;s birthdays, and trying Kyoto all week!), and they brought the check within two seconds of the dessert order.  My family had PLANNED to order $15 worth of sashimi for me and at least one more round of drinks (10 alcoholic beverages would have added up to a quite nice chunk of change, I do believe), but Kyoto made darn sure to push them right out the door as soon as they could.  

So thanks a whole lot, Kyoto, for ruining two birthdays, and making me feel even worse than I already had.  Thanks for making someone who was really sick and already in bed at 6pm on a Saturday night cry.  Next time I&#39;ll be sure to get sick at your restaurant and sleep at the table, just so you can not harass my family, kick them out early, and not let me have a meal.  And guess what?  The food, according to ALL TEN PEOPLE, wasn&#39;t even worth the price, the HORRIBLE SERVICE, the way you made me cry (thanks again!), or the overcrowding (they couldn&#39;t even interact - so what was the point of going to celebrate?).

My entire life, every time I tried it I was left disappointed and couldn&#39;t understand peoples obsession with the stuff.  Then I was talked in to ordering sushi from Kyoto.  Fantastic.  Everything we have ordered from there has been delicious and impressive.  As far as everyone else who complained on here its not really fair.  It gets crowded yes, but that because its the best restaurant in town.  A 20% gratuity is fine due to the fact that when you cheap it out its 15% and with a chef doing tricks at the table I would expect to pay 25% so the way I see it its a deal.

And almost lost me when &#39;tails&#39; turned out to be just &#39;tail.&#39; I mean, if a menu implies plural lobster tails - you can&#39;t really blame a girl for being a bit miffed when the dish comes up short. 

Fortunately, this was a case where quality definitely won out over quantity - and I&#39;ll take one DELICIOUS lobster tail over two not-so-delicious tails any day. After just a taste, Kyoto was back in my good graces.

My dining companion and I opted for the Hibachi style lobster tail, which is DELICIOUSLY prepared with salt, pepper, and soy sauce - already removed from the shell and separated into small fork-perfect pieces. Extra presentation points for using the hollowed-out shell as a garnish!  

I should preface this portion of my review by pointing out the fact that I&#39;ve just recently jumped onto the sushi bandwagon. This probably goes without saying, but as such -- I have yet to cross the line into more adventurous territory. 

Translation: I don&#39;t eat raw fish (yet). 

Thankfully, there are plenty of other fish (and crustaceans!) in the sushi sea - so this hasn&#39;t hindered my newfound maki Love one bit. And I&#39;m usually not one to kiss and tell...but between you and me? I&#39;ve hooked up with more than my share of shrimp tempura rolls. In the process, I&#39;ve become acquainted with all the little details that equal a tasty roll in my book. (1) A crispiness that is not lost amongst pieces of avocado (I Love me some avocado, but crispy shrimp trumps green mush!); (2) Reasonable roll-to-mouth ratio (because it&#39;s just not enjoyable if I have to cut the roll in half); and (3) It&#39;s got to be tight! (loosely packed rice and hanging-off seaweed ends need not apply). 

Kyoto&#39;s shrimp tempura was amazingly crispy - with a surprisingly light batter, and was definitely the star of the roll (take a backseat, avocado!). Also to my delight, the roll was perfectly sized and I easily took it in with just one bite. Alas, If not for the sloppy seaweed ends -- Kyoto would have earned a perfect score from me. But hey, what&#39;s a couple presentation points lost when taste and service score near perfect? I&#39;m definitely willing to overlook a couple loose (seaweed) ends, and will continue to roll with Kyoto!",10/08/12,274,4,1,5,-39,6.4048,3.2449999999999997,0.858,18.898000000000003,No,2305

Made reservations for 2 of us 3 weeks ago for 7:30 and didn&#39;t get seated until 8:20.  Every time we inquired when we would be seated the frazzled hostess  would repeat the same scripted response..... &#34;soon, be patient&#34;.  It was Valentines Day weekend so you would think they would be extra prepared.....nope!! The lobby was packed like sardines &amp; everyone was clearly upset by the dysfunction.  When we were finally seated, 12 of us were crammed at a hibachi table which would barely fit 10 comfortably.  You literally were on top of eachother &amp; bumping elbows. Our waitress finally showed up 15 minutes later to take our drink order.  Everyone got served their drinks &amp; 20 minutes later I received my drink, but not before I had to ask 3 times for it.  As my husband and I sat &amp; looked around at what clearly looked like an understaffed, unorganized mess we couldn&#39;t help but notice how dirty and unwelcoming the entire restaurant was.  We have been to several hibachi &amp; sushi restaurants and this place was a dump.  The waitress brought over a plastic storage bin with bowls &amp; handed us our rice bowls like we were children at a birthday party.  One of the patrons sitting at our table had a broken chair that looked like it came from the dump, everything was so mismatched &amp; dirty.  The crappy service only got worse when the waitress disappeared &amp; everyone at the table had to keep getting up to go to the bar to get their drinks.  Wait, were we at a restaurant or a backyard BBQ ....so stupid!! In the bar they literally had their inventory of unopened boxes stacked up in a corner.  Like the area wasn&#39;t cramped enough you leave your mess in the middle of the bar area, seriously low class!  The best part of the evening was our chef Danny, he was awesome &amp; way too talented to be at a crappy place like this.   I found it strange though that anyone who had seafood was served first &amp; done eating before the meats were ever started.  My husband didn&#39;t have seafood so he had to wait awhile.

kyoto-japanese-restaurant-crystal-lake,Max R.,1gnDcSa5fEA9yTcIVaF2Jg,WMgh_WCUQjmrMwQbvcJSYQ,"I&#39;m being totally honest in this review

Very nice building (newer) entrance is decorated with chochkis that you can buy probably. A little over done but nice. Interior is classy with good seating option.

1. Host- had her mouth full of food when I entered and she spoke to me in a way I could not understand cuz her mouth was full. I&#39;ve never been here before. Initially she didn&#39;t realize that so I was pointed to an area and told I can sit wherever. Very unprofessional and careless. Probably an owner or family member. She ultimately saw my confusion and led me to my seat finally. She also served me the whole time, and smiled a lot. Nice lady. But they need a hostess that can show you to your seat and not eat while working so you can understand her... At least that&#39;s how I feel. I left a $20 tip on a $46 bill even so. Because I have respect and love for all sushi places and restaurant workers in general. O yea btw this place is expensive for the quality. There&#39;s another place just down the road that accommodates better in all ways... Starts with a K also, but I&#39;m going to be a good sport and let you figure it out.

2. Salad with ginger dressing very typical not too pungent but drenched in dressing couldn&#39;t finish because it was a dressing soup at the bottom

3. Sushi bar- very spacious table chefs very talkative which is good. Communication is key to good team cooking. But they were loud (noisy)

4. Atmosphere overall- very classy and comfy. Classical music plays. More for the older crowd probably. Not very &#34;cool&#34; compared to some of the newer sushi establishments. 1 star outa 5 for coolness...

Maki- was just ok. And very spicy, overkill. Not very good. Rosemary was overkill. And the put it in 2 out of 3 rolls I had ordered. Spicy mayo was creamy and interesting, different from the usual, but ok..

Sushi rice- very sticky. Again a little overkill but consumable

Sashimi- blue fin which they had on special was amazing, regular tuna was very exceptional. Very fresh sashimi. Probably the freshest in the area aside to the place off RT-31 5 minutes away

Overall was ok, but I feel it was a waist of money. They are all looks no taste. I&#39;d much rather get my fill, for a better price and better quality overall, at my favorite place just down the road!!! Not promoting either one. I don&#39;t work for either one.

kyoto-japanese-restaurant-crystal-lake,Brittany B.,pt0fTgphUcVXN5ZkSKY6ow,34XggeOkaXgzt9fyVJbuUA,"WORST RESTAURANT IN CRYSTAL LAKE.  This was my first time at Kyoto and my LAST. HAIR in the food. Really!? Long black strands of hair and smaller ones in my sushi. I have never had that happen at any sushi restaurant before. This was extremely disgusting. Also the service was awful. We should have done the teppanyaki but I would never go back after the way we were treated. 

I love sushi and the food did taste good but I will not go back to a place that serves 20 dollar plates with hair in them. 

We were excited to try this place after all of the good reviews and are extremely disappointed. When we walked through the door the decor was gorgeous. That is the only pleasant part of this experience. We ordered our food and as soon as the waitress left she was talking to another server right next to our table and they laughed that my sister ordered a chicken salad (Its on the menu). That made us feel very unwelcome. I love sushi and so does my husband, but we were treating my sister and she just wanted a salad. Why would you laugh at that? That is extremely unprofessional. Then when our food was brought out they brought her chicken teriyaki. The waitress ARGUED with her. We all heard that she ordered a chicken salad and the waitress kept insisting that she ordered something else after we even heard her and the other waitress laughing about the chicken salad. 

So she finally brings out the chicken salad and there is a huge long black hair in it.  I felt horrible and so did my husband. We have never been this poorly treated at a restaurant before. We felt sick to our stomachs and couldnt eat any more of our food. We stopped and just stared down at our food in disbelief. The waitress came back over and asked what was wrong and we showed her the hair. She then argued that no one in the kitchen staff has that long of hair. Then I said that well maybe it was a waitress with long black hair? She asked if we wanted another plate. REALLY? I felt like I was going to throw up. The manager wasn&#39;t in that day so maybe that&#39;s why their staff felt like they could act like children. 

Never going back to this place when there are SO many better places out there. This was close by and convenient for us to get to and it was a waste of time. If you want good food and amazing service go to Kaminari in Lake in the Hills. 

I will NEVER go back to Kyoto in crystal lake. Disgusting.",17/09/14,251,1,1,1,-7,0.3329000000000004,3.1050000000000004,5.257,29.638999999999996,No,2407

Prices: Not cheap, but not crazy expensive.  Expect to pay about $50-60 for dinner for 2 with drinks.  Lunch specials are the way to go.  For $10, you can get a bowl of Miso soup and two orders of rolls.

Ambiance:  Feels a little like an 80&#39;s Japanese disco.  (Not that I&#39;ve ever been to one, but that&#39;s how I imagine it would be).  They like black paint and neon lights.

Food/Drinks: The rolls are fresh, and tasty.  There is a decent selection of cooked and raw sushi.  The house salad is served with a really tasty ginger dressing.

kyoto-japanese-restaurant-crystal-lake,Jeff S.,CiQk5MWr2uF5KtkUUgMj9A,zjiXXR8R9_VqNMmaudmaAg,"I have not eaten here in probably 7-10 years, and for no good reason other than I usually get my Japanese fix when traveling for work.  I&#39;ve also since traveled to Tokyo, ordered sushi in a number of higher-end restaurants across the US, and visited a few excellent teppanyaki joints.

So decided to go there last week. Way disappointed. Hibachi chicken was extremely overcooked and everything was drowned in the teriyaki sauce so there really wasn&#39;t much if a difference in taste between the meat and vegatables.  

We also ordered a selection of makimono which was all very bland.  The spicy mayo was not really spicy and was overloaded on the rolls to the point I could barely taste any of the fish.  The ginger salad was green lettuce in a soup of ginger &#39;dressing&#39;.  No traditional carrots.  The miso soup tasted like instant stuff I&#39;ve made at home from miso paste packets.  The tempura vegetables had a very doughy batter and was not crunchy, plus the batter basically fell off the vegetables when dipping in the tentsuyu.  

I used to eat here often so I really don&#39;t know if over time either the quality has slipped or my standard have gone way up. But either way the next time I want local sushi it&#39;s back to Bistro Wasbi (a no-brainer really) and teppanyaki might be Rokbonki.

Another minor issue that was annoying was that the menu did not state any restrictions on ordering the &#39;kids platter&#39; which was one of the very few non-fish items (chicken + vegie roll) on the menu.  OK, most places have policies and that&#39;s understood, but it wasn&#39;t stated on the menu and you&#39;d think that they could make an exception after ordering in some cases, but the &#39;my manager said no&#39; response tells me the manager doesn&#39;t care about repeat business. (The place was packed so I guess they can afford to choose margin over individual experience).",27/11/10,205,2,1,-1,-50,-1.1921000000000002,0.556,1.6900000000000002,13.754000000000001,No,1904

I thought that the box lunch was a good deal for the amount of food you were given.  I scored above average for food not so much for the contents of my box lunch but for the sides that came along with it. First, the miso soup - it was probably one of the best ones I have ever had as it had a great flavor. Second, the ginger salad dressing- OMG! I do not have to say anything more. DELISH! Third, the fried rice-I am not a big rice eater except when eating sushi so it is not often that I would comment on rice but this fried rice had the perfect balance. I would definitely make a trip back out there for lunch and maybe even consider a &#34;special&#34; occasion dinner and try the grill experience.",13/08/14,89,4,2,3,22,2.8936,0.961,0.0,8.039,No,775
kyoto-japanese-restaurant-crystal-lake,Andrew S.,TlDX6BxYLs_tH5I1nL7uRg,4Stfj92WuVwHDNrSxubUYA,"As mentioned in other reviews, this place is a 5 for McHenry county, but compared to the rest of the US this place is a 3.5, slightly above average. Before I go into depth, let me state that I love this place and have been here well over 25 times. I get the hibachi and sushi. This is my wife and my main go-to place to go for special or not so special occasions.

I recently had a bad night here, but will get into that later. Overall it is expensive but worthy. The hibachi entertainment is pretty standard; same old onion volcano, big flame-up, and broccoli flipping stuff. Every so often a new trick is done or variation of an existing routine. Most of the chefs are great but &#39;Paul&#39; is one of my favorites. One thing they do differently at Kyoto is the &#39;spicy garlic&#39; topping. Most other places have a garlic (only) topping that looks like it was formed at a factory. Kyoto&#39;s is made fresh and the spicyness makes it really stand out. It is very buttery. Some places have very dry garlic topping

They serve a simple chicken noodle soup, and a salad with homemade ginger dressing before the meal. As a standard, this place generally serves you the rice first, then veggies, then meat. I like that order so you have the best for last. You can also get 3 dipping sauces, a teriyaki, ginger and mustard sauce. All of these are good. I have to point out, some places have far better mustard sauce; one that is creamy and not so pungent. While i do love this mustard sauce in small quantity, other places do it better. This is one of the few things I would change here. Overall, it is just a different way of doing it. Not really a negative or positive to me. You can order sushi; full rolls or ala-carte. I highly recommend the Godzilla. It has shrimp tempura in avocado and a few other things. I hate avocado and I love this! The individual sushi is very good, but it seems like they all come with wasabi inside. After the meal, they give you a complimentary palette cleansing ice cream. If it is a special occasion you get a pineapple boat. 

Now on to the bad parts. This place is a nicer looking restaurant for Crystal Lake. It also pulls a crowd on the weekends. There is little waiting room, and the bathrooms are directly behind it. If it is busy you gotta politely, or not so politely tell the people standing around to move out of the way. Due to the layout of the eating area there is little elbow room, and you will likely feel fairly crowded. I think most other places within a short driving distance are like that though. One other side note; reservations help, but if a table is not up and ready at your reservation time, you will have to wait. I have also seen where they accidentally skip you when the next table opens up. Due to the waiting area getting crowded, you may have to spill into the dining and bar section. Even with a reservation the waitress may fail to notice you and seat another party. 

Here is my first bad experience. It was a recent Friday night and my party got there before the crowd. I ordered sushi early on and it came well into the main meal; just before my steak got onto my plate and after all my rice and veggies were delivered and eaten. Usually they serve it by the time the chef starts starts cooking or at least before anything he cooks gets put onto my plate. The individual sushi order had way too much wasabi inside. WAY too much.

Timing was way off all night. The salad, also supposed to come early, was delivered to everyone just before my sushi. Refills took forever. It was a really &#39;off&#39; night for them. The chef seemed like he was new to Kyoto; I had not seen him before and his routine was a good amount different than the other chefs. He did not put rice into bowls, and instead just plopped it onto everyones plates with the spatula. An already overcrowded plate became much worse. It also felt he was talking at you with a bunch of pre set sayings and trying to simply smile and nod if you try to ask him something. Not so bad, but didn&#39;t feel quite right either. When he was dishing out some extra rice or veggies, he knocked over someones full water glass into their lap and plate while doing so. Really threw off the mood. He also messed up some of his twirling routines. It happens, but he kept trying at it, and messing it up again and again. It really threw off the fun of the show. I ordered the filet combo, medium rare. He gave it to me rare and I had to have him scoop it back and cook it a bit longer.  


In all, I love the place and plan on going back often. There is not really anywhere else reasonably close that is as good, or better. If you want to go here, it is better to do so on a weekday.",15/02/15,543,4,2,5,44,11.667600000000002,8.206999999999999,2.472,55.32000000000001,No,4707
kyoto-japanese-restaurant-crystal-lake,Amanda L.,yrKUGsyYMggfgDrQ9Ec33Q,Srvm1dI3j3rIm_YSXIWGaw,"Came in for dinner with some friends last night and had a fantastic time. 

First of all, apparently the restaurant was recently moved to a new location, and it was obvious, as the place was clean and the decorations were modern (we loved the green lights in the walls).

The pricing was right on for a Japanese steakhouse, if not more reasonable than many I&#39;ve seen (and definitely better than Benihana for what we ordered). The menu was much more extensive which was nice, but I&#39;ll be honest, I went right to the hibachi section so I don&#39;t really remember what was on the rest of it.

If you&#39;ve never been to a place like this, it&#39;s nice because for the price you get a full meal - soup, salad, rice, veggies, meat, and then ice cream for dessert. It was really a TON of food, we waddled away from the table!

I ordered the hibachi filet mignon, and it was the absolute best filet I&#39;ve ever had at a Japanese steakhouse. The seasoning was delicious - the teriyaki was so good and the meat was tender and moist, cooked perfectly. Every bite was so delicious. The veggies were a nice blend of broccoli, carrots, zucchini, and onions. We also got bean sprouts (&#34;Japanese french fries!&#34; our chef told us). 

We also tried the sake sampler, which (while small cups) was small enough to split between two people, that stuff is potent!

The two-year-olds we had with us loved the show our chef put on for us (which is also part of the appeal of coming to a place like this). They had the kids teriyaki chicken and really enjoyed it, that teriyaki sauce was too good! The kids portion was large enough for two two-year-olds to split. But bring cups for the kids, they didn&#39;t seem to have any kids cups like most restaurants with a kids menu do. 

Expect to spend at least an hour at dinner, since the chef cooking the food is also entertainment, and it all takes time, but they feed you a bit at a time, so it&#39;s nice you are eating as you&#39;re watching. It&#39;s just not a good idea to come to a place like this if you&#39;re in a rush. 

We loved Kyoto! Delicious food and a fun show to see with friends and kids!",19/03/12,257,5,4,5,113,10.5749,4.677,0.134,16.188999999999997,No,2151

On the other side is the hibachi grills where you can sit at the grills where chefs are cooking right in front of you!  I ate on the sushi side but I will definitely have to come back for the hibachi side.

The sushi was great, we tried a couple of the standard maki rolls in the California and the spider and they were just as good if not better than anywhere else I have been.  What really set this place apart was the chef&#39;s special maki rolls we had.  We tried the green turtle and the crazy monkey, both amazing creations!

Aside from the food, we enjoyed some great Saki from their wide collection and I tried one of their saketinas as well.  It was very interesting mixing the vodka and the sake together but it was a good cocktail!

Bistro might win out a little bit in ambiance and quality, but they are MUCH more expensive and don&#39;t have as much of a selection as Kyoto.

The teriyaki sauce is so good, we buy it by the pints (it&#39;s pretty inexpensive as well). The sushi is so delicious, but I&#39;ve realized I like all sushi so maybe everything is good to me! I like how there is a sushi entree in which you get three rolls and salad for about $18.

We ordered from here for the first time tonight and are so thrilled with the quality of food and service. I ordered carry out and it was ready in fifteen minutes or less, and was assembled neatly in containers when I arrived for pick up. One of the employees even triple checked everything was in place before I paid. It&#39;s so nice to see that level of customer service happen directly in front of you to remind you it still exists. I was too hungry to take a photo before eating, but it seriously looked picture perfect. 

Both my boyfriend and I ordered chicken burritos and they are SO BIG for so little money. We could both only finish half. The chicken was seasoned well and the ingredients were clearly fresh and crisp. We also ordered the supreme nachos which were, in short, delicious. He chose a steak taco as well and said it was better than the other ones he&#39;s tried in the area. We plan on going back tomorrow, Wednesday, for the $0.99 tacos. 

But back to that salsa: So. Good. I love trying salsa from Mexican restaurants and this is top 3 for sure. It&#39;s refreshing and thin, not chunky, and the flavors work so well together. Order it and make your day.",31/05/16,140,5,2,5,33,6.146700000000001,3.577,0.107,13.315,No,1262

Almost always, I&#39;ve been dissapointed or not very impressed.

I&#39;ve tried this place many times, and every time the food has been delicious! I love their green sauce, not too spicy, but lots of flavor. The red salsa is too spicy for me, but delicious. They are switching their name from &#34;Catering&#34; to &#34;Restaurant &amp; Catering&#34;, and they have a sit down restaurant going on next to their takeout section. The staff mentioned that they will be gearing up to host karaoke, so that should be interesting! Only desire is that they had more of an array of deserts, but they do have Flan and cookies. Haven&#39;t tried these yet though. They do sell beer here and you can place your order in advance for pickup. 

The staff is always very friendly and the food is always brought out fast and hot. The rice and beans are not my absolute favorite, but I think the main entree&#39;s more than make up for this. 

Steak tacos: Plenty of meat, three usually more than fill me up (points for $1 taco day actually having regular size tacos, unlike other some other places)
 
Steak Gorditas: Gorditas are traditionally like thick tortilla flatbreads that are stuffed with meat, cheese, beans and sour cream. The ones served here are not your traditional gorditas, it has a bottom and top piece with the meat and condiments in almost a sandwich form. But it tastes like they make the flatbread tortillas in-house, huge plus for me, they are soo delicious!

Enchiladas (green) with Chicken and cheese: These are not on the menu, but one day I asked for them and they made them. Tortillas were a bit soggy, but overall delicious cheese and delicious seasoned shredded chicken was used. 

Chilaquiles (green): Delicious, crunchy goodness! Only offered as a breakfast item, I usually get these with chicken, beans and rice and an egg over easy. My favorite thing on the menu. 

Horchata: 7/10. It&#39;s delicious, not too sweet, not too bland. Wish it was a bit thicker, but quenches my horchata craving. 


It is in the same lot as the Village Tavern, next to the 7/11. They also just extended their hours, which is great for me! 9:00 am - 10:00 pm.

We ordered cheese enchiladas in green sauce, a steak torta and a taco de al pastor.  I also had an agua de horchata.  

So first of all - the complimentary chips and salsa.  The chips were obviously not house made, but they were ok.  Something that is so simple to make, I never understand when mexican restaurants prefer to buy them pre-made.  Anyway, they were ok.  The salsa was good.

The enchiladas dinner came with 4 enchiladas, rice and beans.  They were really good.  I was told that the green sauce was mild - well, I must be a whimp cause it was spicy to me - but still really good.  

The rice and beans were decent.  The beans were made from a can - but that&#39;s not such a bad thing.  again, making beans homemade is cheaper than from a can - not sure why they use canned, but they were good.

My BF loved his torta and taco.  Clean plate club for sure - he even finished off my enchiladas because my dinner had so much food, I couldn&#39;t finish it all!

My horchata was clearly homemade and really delicious, HUGE plus for that because that mix stuff is AWFUL!!

panchos-taqueria-and-catering-schaumburg,Andrew G.,f3ccR72Y75lLAP88VLd8Tw,Cjmvd2am2DKEC1rnT5nkiA,"It was depressing seeing the nearest &#34;authentic&#34; place to nab some Mexican cuisine came up as Chipotle. While they&#39;re good, they&#39;re far from authentic in the same way P.F. Chang&#39;s is anywhere close to genuine Asian food. So, setting off to discover something remotely close to the Real McCoy of Mexican food, my wife and I happened to stumble on Pancho&#39;s in a hapless sort of way. I expected it to be okay and was thrilled to discover it was so much better.

Despite being nestled in a small strip mall, so unassuming that if you weren&#39;t looking for Pancho&#39;s you might very well miss it, the place is nothing less than a hidden gem at the very least. Walking in, the place is simple and unassuming, but conveys a homely feeling of a neighborhood taqueria with an alluring smell to match. The couple behind the counter are all too happy to take an order or toss out a recommendation.

Opting to try the pork burrito, I was curiously enthralled to see how it matched to Chipotle given that&#39;d been my usual meal of choice when visiting there. My wife ordered a foursome of steak tacos. We also opted to split some nachos and queso. Forgoing fountain drinks, which aren&#39;t offered, my wife nabbed a can of Pepsi and I a bottle of orange Fanta. Altogether, we spent roughly $20.

Directed to take a seat in the dining area, the gentleman behind the counter brought out our drinks and a set of chips with salsa. While I found the salsa to have a slight kick, my wife -- ever more sensitive to spicy food -- found it unbearably hot. Wimp. She nearly downed her entire can of soda trying to alleviate the heat and was all too happy when the nachos arrived.

Though a bit sad and slightly better than what one would expect at a movie theater or ballgame, I couldn&#39;t be too upset with the appetizer. Taken at face value, it made me wistful about waiting for my food to get there, filling me with anticipation and did it well. While it wasn&#39;t necessarily anything that could be considered to rewrite the playbook on nachos, it was perfect in that it left the bar at a place for our meal to surpass it. 

When my wife&#39;s tacos finally showed up accompanied by my burrito, we couldn&#39;t have been more excited. The smell was just about enough to trigger a Pavlovian response. Hungrily, I sampled the first big bite and slowly savored it, dragging the moment out. It was great. Down right fantastic and some of the finest Mexican food I had ever had the joy of tasting in the Chicago burbs.

Sampling one of the tacos off my wife&#39;s plate, it turned into me eating an entire one, complemented with a slight amount of green salsa to give it a bit of limey flavor. Equally good, I felt like the normal sweetness of the tacos and burritos outer wrap was dispensed, giving the food contained therein each its own moment to be savored. My wife said it best when she exclaimed that she hadn&#39;t had Mexican this good since she lived on the South Side and I was inclined to agree. Pancho&#39;s offered the delectable flavor of the city to us deprived folks of the suburbs and delivered it exceptionally well.

We quietly ate as much as we could before we were both too full for another bite. Taking home half of my burrito and my wife bringing a solitary taco, we saw our way out. It wasn&#39;t long before the leftovers were gone -- in fact, they didn&#39;t even last through the evening.

The service was exceptional, the prices right and atmosphere vastly welcoming -- it was purely icing on the cake that, for the most part, the food was positively delightful. If you&#39;re ever in the area, it&#39;s well worth stopping in, if for no other reason than the place is leagues beyond the next best thing suburbanites have access to: Chipotle.",18/08/13,405,4,3,5,82,8.6009,4.03,1.602,28.366999999999997,No,3780

I ordered chicken wings and was told to pick them up in 20 minutes.

At one point one of the workers came out from the back but did not acknowledge the line of customers at all. Now i had waited an additional 30 minutes on top of the initial 20 for a single order of chicken wings! Are u kidding me?

After 1 hour of wasting my time without getting any service or food i left hungry and dissatisfied.

Just because you are one of the few halal pizza places in town doesn&#39;t mean you can disrespect and waste customers&#39; time as you please. Learn to manage traffic and communicate with customers when they are waiting.

- First, no management available or in sight. There wasnt even anyone to complain to. Service took forever and we were ignored. We were not the only ones to complain as well. Several parties around us were experiencing the same. Took us 2.5 hours to just eat and get our of there.
- salads were bagged lettuce and bland watery ranch dressing. Terrible. 
- bread came halfway through the meal instead of before and was surprisingly microwaved. I know this because it was almost raw in the center and hard after a few minutes of sitting on the plate.
- steak was dry as a bone. Poor quality meat. No flavor or seasoning. Bleh. Not pleasant even remotely.
-complete kitchen and bar delay on service. Our drinks and food were all served extremely late and we were ready to walk out of the restaurant. We waited and waited only to recieve garbage food. Very disappointed.
-children screaming and running around the tables did not help situation.

I&#39;m not one to complain so I let it go and just didn&#39;t eat it since it was a part of my combo meal. The steak was decent, could have had a little more flavor but again, I didn&#39;t complain. Afterall, it was MUCH better than the horrible salmon!  Got the check and noticed that they charged me $7.50 for my Merlot(and my table had 3). I finally had to say something! I said I ordered the house wine, and she said I know so I&#39;ll ask about that. She came back to tell me their house wine is a brand called Red Diamond and that is their top shelf wine. I then said, well, I ordered the house wine.... And she said I know but that&#39;s all they had for Merlot. Ummm, not to sound cheap, because my bill was over $200, but I could have made my own conscious decision to drink that &#34;brand&#34; or not had they informed me beforehand. I would have been fine with the Cabernet that was actually the house special  price. But I&#39;m not even mad about that since I did end up drinking ALL my alcohol, but the Salmon, DAMN! YUCK!

Solid 5 stars! What a great find! So far very consistent...had sandwiches there three times and the chicken breast they use is huge! We couldn&#39;t believe how heavy the box was with my sandwich. Last time we ordered one sandwich and shared and it was plenty for two adults. 

It&#39;s got an inconvenient location and, while I think it&#39;s a great find I&#39;m almost hesitant to share this info because I don&#39;t want it to become overrun! It&#39;s that good!!

YES to the tasty grilled fresh prepared food everybody is raving about. Large Havana is not as spicy as I was led to believe, spicy mustard is not spicy habanero, but good. The texas toast travels really well, and remember this is not the lo-cal plate. OK Fries are fresh cut with skins and refreshingly not a salt bomb, thank you. Next time I&#39;m gonna try the slaw.
The stuffed pepper soup, think Italian Wedding soup, was a salt bomb and on the greasy side but delicious and I wouldn&#39;t change a thing. You might want to omit the optional feta cheese if you are watching salt, but it added a lot. Large 16oz serving for $3. We split a Havana and soup and it was plenty for us, no leftovers except a lot of fries. $15 with tip. Great road food.

Laura was very helpful as we stumbled through their menu the first time. We like Bomba grill and bet their rating goes up, another reason to like Dundee.

Hotdog was good, but average - both said the Havana was good.  The problem was waiting - it took over 30 minutes to get our orders and we had to move outside because it was so smoky (from the grill, not smokers) inside the restaurant.  The lady working the counter apologized and gave us all credits for a future visit, which was nice.

I will be back - I think this place has a lot of potential and they are still working through the kinks of being a new, successful business.

My guess it would be BOMBA Grill.  My wife and I split a Havana and a Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  We couldn&#39;t finish either - but not for lack of desire.

Subtlety is not a virtue at BOMBA.  Both sandwiches were huge - and displayed a fusion of flavors and ingredients which were both delicious and daunting.  The Havana deserves the raves it has been receiving - but the Buffalo Chicken might be better.  It&#39;s an over-the-top combination of buffalo chicken, cheese and bacon which could have fed four.  

The pasta salad side was enormous - and delicious.

This is not your ordinary sandwich place.  It&#39;s built for the serious eater who&#39;s looking for creativity and quantity.  The only thing it needs is an easier to access location.

I&#39;ve been to this unassuming pizza place a few times and have been impressed by their thin crust pizza. They seem to use very fresh ingredients and the cheese is not too greasy. The best is when you buy it on one day where all pizzas were 50% off however I don&#39;t know if they are still running this promotion. The largest pizza is enough to feed a lot of people. I have not tried any of their other type of pizzas except for their thin crust.

Pros: Great thin crust pizza not too greasy

Cons: Gets really busy and customer service at the desk is sometimes lacking

Hidden deals:
Monday used to be 50% pizza however you should call to verify that this is still the case",14/01/16,74,4,1,3,-4,2.1189,0.543,0.0,5.457,No,696

D̩cor: The outside is a bit unassuming as it is in a strip mall, but inside they do a solid effort of making it feel as authentic as they can. The party &#34;area&#34; (it was not a separate room) was the perfect size for our gathering and the rest of the place is a decent size too. I was told that they just recently expanded their space so that must have been where we were located.
Bathroom: clean and inviting

Staff: All of the waitresses were johnny-on-the-spot with anything that we needed. Great service!

Food: As you might imagine, we had pizza. There was a salad to accompany it, which was basic and very tasty, and the pizzas had assorted toppings. Everything was very tasty and there was more than enough food to go around. Great taste, flavor, and everything was hot and fresh!

pasta-mia-bartlett,Joe N.,Sw2Lpr6-iOleFtD7NL6awQ,#NAME?,"I have been coming to this restaurant for years, and I finally am getting the opportunity to write a review about a place that has many highs and some lows. I should let anyone know that if you&#39;re looking for a quick review, I think the place is good and at a fair price. If you want to hear my detailed review and get down to the specifics, then I suggest to read along.

When you walk in, you will notice immediately how greatly designed the interior is. One side is the dining room, while the other side is the bar. I prefer to be on the bar side, as the dining room side can get noisy and crowded. The bar has many beers on tap (from IPA&#39;s to Lite) and has a wide selection of whiskey and vodka. They have a large selection of martinis, but the one alcohol you should drink is wine, especially at an Italian restaurant. The bar side has high top tables, so bringing your grandmother may not be a good idea (unless you dined in the dining room with low top tables). Even though it isn&#39;t your typical bar, it is still a great place to grab a cocktail and enjoy some appetizers.

The service is, well, hit or miss. I had a few of the waitresses take my order and were slow. They would bring the wrong food out, and even mess up the drink order. On the other hand, I have had a waiter and a waitress give me great service and deliver the food right on time. I guess some of them are great, and others are ok.

The food is good. I&#39;m not going to say great because I have had better dishes, but for what you pay, you get an excellent bargain. I have many favorites, and I am going to label the better dishes and the lesser of them.

Great Dishes You Have To Try:
- Any Special (they&#39;re always great)
- Calamari (try all 3 ways!)
- Grilled Misto
- Eggplant Stacks &amp; Eggplant Rolls
- Wings
- Pasta Fagioli (the only item I get every time I am there)
- Vinnie&#39;s Meatball Salad
- Italian Beef Sandwich
- Shrimp Scampi
- Chicken Marsala
- Chicken Vesuvio
- DA CHEEZY BEEF PIZZA! (THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD TRY!)

The stuffed artichoke and the veal dishes will upset you.

Overall, its a nice, cozy place. Pete is a great guy, and he&#39;s always happy. I hope one day this place takes off and eventually expand. It&#39;s all homemade, and I hope you can experience this for yourself.",24/02/16,274,4,1,5,-6,6.7831,4.427999999999999,1.0850000000000002,19.487000000000002,No,2320

We were not offered an appetizer, nor dessert and I would want my staff pushing guests to order more food if it would help business, my opinion. We had extra pizza at the end and we were not offered a to go box to take home our food. We had had enough of our dinner and just wanted to get out.

pasta-mia-bartlett,Clarissa R.,vMD3OHIn7ceCHUY6s6sGHg,UScEgp0mZOvmcy2XXXQzSg,"This is undeniably some of the worst food I&#39;ve ever put in my mouth. I just didn&#39;t know what to expect when we came here. We always drove by and figured we&#39;d give it a shot. I honestly feel like I would have been better off flushing my money down the toilet. 

Here&#39;s what we ordered:
Chicken Vesuvius which came with salad:
This was described on the menu as chicken with garlic and a light sauce with potatoes.  When I got it I was a little blown away. The potatoes are actually potato wedges (the kind you deep fry and eat away your sorrows at a cheap bar). There was no color in the dish and whatever the sauce was wasn&#39;t a sauce...it was a oil slick. There was garlic, but it didn&#39;t taste like anything except bland sadness. The chicken itself had obviously been frozen for months. For $15 I could have just driven a few miles and gotten all you can eat sushi instead. The taste was revolting. It was equivalent to what I would give my son as a punishment. There was zero seasoning on this dish. I ate one potato wedge (of the 5 on the plate) and half a chicken breast (of the 3 on the plate) and politely declined when the waitress asked if I wanted the rest wrapped up because I wouldn&#39;t even have the nerve to give this to my dog. The salad was OK...you can&#39;t mess up a salad...but the croutons were burnt.

Chicken Pollo sandwich:
My fiance ordered this and by the look on his face alone I&#39;m gathering that he didn&#39;t enjoy it at all. The bread itself was gluey on the inside and then indestructible on the outside. It looked to be an egg bread (shiny on the outside) but it looked like it had the consistency akin to something like polyester. Hey it flexes, but you can&#39;t rip it apart.  How the inside was raw is beyond me. He got potato salad with it and it completely lacked seasoning. He ended up eating half of the potato salad and only the chicken (which was dry) from the inside of the sandwich.

Chicken tenders and fries:
My son got this (I&#39;m so sorry, Desmond). The chicken fingers were obviously frozen. They looked like Tyson chicken nuggets, just longer. The fries have zero seasoning. They just tasted old to be honest. He didn&#39;t eat much of it thankfully.

At the end of this excursion I spent $36 plus tip. When you stop and think of the things you could have gotten for $36+ instead of dropping it on food you only ate 1/4 of it gets really depressing. $36 gets you a lot of decent sushi up the street. $36 pays for a month of internet. $36 gives you a good amount of groceries. $36 pays for two and a half months of world of warcraft. $36 will make a homeless person&#39;s day. If I wanted a ton of frozen food served to me, I would have gone and bought $36 of frozen food from Jewel because at least then I&#39;d throw salt on it before serving it.

This was by far the worst food I ever put in my mouth and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I got sick off the 5 bites I did dare to take of this food. All that went through my head was how this place is worse than some places you see on restaurant impossible.",01/11/15,342,1,1,0,-47,-0.41899999999999993,2.5370000000000004,1.9729999999999999,34.491,No,3085

This past week we ordered pizza for delivery and again need to add extra sauce because it seems they cut back on it. Well the pizza was delivered and it looks like the driver tipped it and all the topping slid off the pizza all to one side. I called and the mgr said it&#39;s because we ordered extra sauce!! He me me feel like it was my own fault. We always order extra sauce never had trouble. He told me he would remake a new pizza and my husband had to go get it!! They didn&#39;t offer to refund the pizza price or the delivery charge we paid earlier!

The food is really good, but I don&#39;t recommend planning a party here - it seems like their party planning is very disorganized and it&#39;s difficult to get hold of Pete. The staff is helpful though and accomodating to requests. We had a party here, and they didn&#39;t provide enough food for the size of our party, the bakery they mandate that you use didn&#39;t do what we asked, and once we were seated the wait staff basically forgot about us and never served us drinks or anything.

Anyway, like I said, I have to go back once a year or so to be reminded this place is no good, which I did about two weeks ago.  Still the same old tough chicken marsala with plain pasta slapped on the dish for some unknown reason, and still the same cardboard pizza with pizza sauce that has no seasoning and tastes like tomato sauce.

Started off with the appetizer platter, which consisted mozzarella stick, wings, jalapeno poppers and ravioli, which was decent, but nothing special.

This is the first time I&#39;ve ever eaten at any Pasta Mia -- We went as a family - 8 of us.  Was this the waiter&#39;s first job??  We were seated at a long table around the corner in the restaurant with practically no light at all.  Waiter comes with plates/silverware/oil.  We waited FOREVER for bread.. One basket for 8 people?  And he brings drinks.. eventually.  No sweetener.  We pass our own plates/silverware around as he clearly can&#39;t be bothered.   

Waiter could  not get the drink orders straight..  WHO had lemon?? Who had wine? Who had this?  

When the &#34;entrees&#34; came out.. the waiter brought 3..  The rest of us had to wait and wait and wait and wait.  I got my salad when another person got their hamburger..  ??  

One person ordered a slice of pizza that included broccoli..  We&#39;re told they ran out. Sorry.  I ordered linguini in white clam sauce.  15 min later I&#39;m told they gave my food away and they just ran out of clams.  Did I want the shrimp scampi pasta??  Horrific choice.  Dry and no garlic butter to be found anywhere in that bowl.  By this time, we are out of bread.. again.  We had to ask, repeatedly, for more bread. ONE loaf of 6 pieces is not enough for 8 hungry people.  

The pizza crust tasted like cardboard ( margherita) and I can safely tell everyone we will NEVER come back to this place, again.  The waiter was more worried about a table of 3 young girls than serving us.  His excuse for running out of food was due to the holiday weekend and that they put their orders in on Tuesday. My daughter works in food service. That was a bunch of bunk. They need to hire somebody who KNOWS how to order.. and a waiter who KNOWS how to wait.. and a COOK who knows what he&#39;s doing.  UGH..

It&#39;s a little tucked away but still close enough to the downtown area. The strip mall it&#39;s located in is behind a Walgreens and by the Post Office, in case you were curious. 
It&#39;s not a huge fancy establishment, it&#39;s kind of like half a bar and half a sit and eat but don&#39;t stick around there&#39;s only a handful of tables kind of place.

The first time around we were not impressed at all by the food. We got some kind of pasta dish, I think I got the chicken marsala which was obviously not too memorable. I mean pasta IS in the name? It tasted very oily, bland and something that I could easily whip up...which trust me folks is not a compliment! We left full but not that impressed.

I don&#39;t know what it was, maybe laziness and not wanting to venture out too far, and we were starving...but we decided to try Pasta Mia again, this time we ordered a pizza.

Cavatelli w/ vodka sauce (it comes w/ soup, and we ordered the chicken vegetable)
Minestrone Soup
Medium Cheese-Well done
Medium Mia Supreme-Well done
Fried Dough

pasta-mia-bartlett,Kim M.,VaDDhoa-IGKj3BMCHUxc4Q,ENKSmiznR9-W-KAuWABcKg,"We went on a Pasta Mia Leave of Absence once we discovered the place across the street. But sometimes you&#39;ve just got to dine in for pizza. So before my kids&#39; class we decided to stop in -- thinking I had an hour so it should be fine. Especially since we were the only people in there. 

I informed the guy that sat us -- well scratch that, we sat ourselves. The server came out about 5 minutes later. We ordered. I let him know that we had to be out in at least 40 minutes and he said no problem -- that the pizza would be ready in 10 minutes. 

Well about 20 minutes later the server noticed we were still sitting there. I asked him if I could pay at that time, and also have the pizza put in a box since I knew getting that done close to the time we had to leave would probably stress me out. 

Finally we got the pizza. Something is different in the sauce from what it used to be. I think it&#39;s that there is not as much garlic. But here is what I will say, THE CRUST WAS AWESOME. Again, THE CRUST ON THE WELL DONE PIZZA WAS AWESOME.

We walked in with about 10 other people and we waited to be seated, as other grabbed menus and took seats, we finally determined that was normal.  Grabbing 5 menus we took a round table.  Later we watched as other were seated so...that was a bit confusing.

Lighting...let&#39;s say it was intimate dark...hard to read the photocopied menus, luckily we have flashlight apps on the phones!  

I asked about specials for the night, our server explained that they were on the back, ok...he walked away and when he came back I asked if there were any other specials he said...&#34;No.&#34;  I then asked about half price pizza&#39;s...oh &#34;Yes, that is a special tonight.&#34;

There were five of us and we ordered two pizzas a plate of chicken fingers, a stuffed artichoke and a cup of soup.  After about 20 minutes we got our water and I noticed that another table had gotten bread, I asked about that and was told it would be right out...that went ok.  At that time the soup and salad arrived, the salad was not drained and full of water the soup was ok.  

While waiting we could hear someone, yelling at the staff in back from the front of the house...that was interesting.  No cursing so no Ramsay effect but it still seemed a bit unprofessional.  I know it happens but I have only heard it in the house a few times.

The pizzas came out at the 35 minute mark, they were warm and they were prepared correctly...but there was nothing special about them.   We had ordered the Hawaiian and the Cheezy Beef...eh, they were ok.  The Cheezy was full of a lot of giardiniera and a little beef.  The beef was not tasty at all.  The Hawaiian was not bad, a little salty but we have had worse.

We had to ask after 10 more minutes about our chicken fingers and our stuffed artichoke.  They arrived, the chicken fingers did not excite the diner and the artichoke was more artichoke flavored bread.

The bill came and there were a few errors, the pizzas were not half off, I had to get that corrected and the price we were billed was different from the menu we had been given, off by a dollar...we let them keep that one.

I&#39;ve been dining at Pasta Mia for over 5 years now and have never had a bad pizza or bad experience dining in or taking out.  Pizzas are the best around-- thin crust has a nice crunchy crust and slightly sweetened sauce.  Toppings are fresh and good quality.  I&#39;ve had good pasta dinners as well-- the Rigatoni Spinachi has been a favorite.

Recently, I changed to a vegetarian diet and no longer eat meat or cheese.  While it&#39;s had to find healthy options like this at any pizza joint in town, Pasta Mia now has some gluten-free pasta entrees and they were easily able to accomodate my needs with a nice veggie pasta dish.

That represents about 75% of my experience with Pasta Mia.  Whether I pick it up or get it delivered, this is my only pizza place. I love this pizza.  The crust edge is a wonderful combination of crispy and fluffy, like a warm roll that perfectly complements the rest of the ingredients.  The sauce is delicious and in just the right proportion to the other ingredients.  They don&#39;t skimp on the cheese either.

Pro tip: They have a coupon for 50% off pizza on Mondays if you are looking to save a few bucks.

 I have occasionally stayed to eat my pizza, but the beer selection is terrible.  They have Miller Lite and Leinie&#39;s Red on tap, with a couple of other undrinkable bottled beers.  Good beer is a requirement for me when eating pizza and I have plenty at my house.

I do occasionally eat in when I am in the mood for pasta.  Pasta Mia is very small.  The tables are very close together and there are not many of them.  Despite the limited seating, this place seems to be very popular for children&#39;s sporting team events.  I really hate the nights when I am unlucky enough to walk in on that scene.

There is not a dedicated hostess station, but you will be greeted by someone behind the counter as you walk in.  There is a stack of menus on the counter.  You can just grab a couple and seat yourself.  

The servers are all very nice.  Even when the place is packed, I always get pretty good service.  Some of the young waitresses don&#39;t know anything about beer or wine, but I suppose that is more the fault of our Puritan laws.

The pasta dishes I have had over the years are always tasty.  This is not the fanciest Italian food you will ever eat, but it is a good, solid effort.  The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable.  Each meal comes with bread and soup as well.
 
I don&#39;t often get dessert, but the Italian ice is very good.  The tiramisu comes in a little disposable plastic dish.  I don&#39;t know where they get it from and I don&#39;t like the fast food presentation, but it is good.

I have also used Pasta Mia to cater a house party.  The ordering process was easy and they delivered big steaming containers of delicious food such as eggplant parmesan and chicken marsala  directly to my kitchen.  The prices for this service were very reasonable and everyone loved the food.  They definitely made my party a success.

Overall I am definitely a fan of Pasta Mia.  I have been a customer since I moved to Bartlett in 2004 and I hope we continue a long and pizza filled relationship.

Anytime we order, its cooked as we ask and delivered when promised.  While there may be other pizzas I prefer, Pasta Mia is consistant with an above average product.

The principal reason that I spend my money with Pasta Mia is their very high level of commitment to youth sports.  I coach Football, Baseball, and Wrestling in the community and it always seems that Pasta Mia shows up more times than not on the sponsor list.

pasta-mia-bartlett,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,8Hnb5Wdss6sk4bDxutZgGg,"This is a good place to go for some solid Italian food. Due to the abundance of Italians in the area, the western &#39;burbs are blessed with lots of good Italian restaurants, and Pasta Mia is one of them.

The restaurant itself is a pretty casual place. Service was on time, and friendly. I think it&#39;s a little dark inside, which is... odd... considering how much of the exterior walls are devoted to windows, but that&#39;s just me.

But on to the food. Calamari was surprisingly good; the batter wasn&#39;t overly complex, but it was crispy, and the squid very fresh. It helps that the tomato sauce tasted fresh, and that they give you 3 lemon wedges with it.

I had a simple broth-based pasta dish with broccoli, shrimp and lots and lots and LOTS of garlic. Very good. My wife had a thin crust sausage pizza that came out as a chewy thin crust, but an absolutely unbeatable cheese mixture. (I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they used some of that fontinella in the cheese mix.)

On the way I got to see some of the other flavors of pizza they have to try - eggplant and fontinella sounds like a winner, as well as a pizza/Italian meatball hybrid. This is definitely a place I would check out over lunch someday.",05/08/10,138,4,1,5,8,5.394,3.306,0.173,10.521,No,1217

It seems since the expansion, the service has really declined. Friendly, but not organized and not enough servers. Plus, just found out that they recently put all high top tables/chairs on the older side of the place. I don&#39;t know many people that like to sit on those. Might be a bad idea, since that means less regular tables. Very loud inside since the ceilings are high and open.
We went to restaurant last night (for first time in about a year...since last time we went was awful). It took forever just to get bread and soup. When the soup came, it was room temp. It was good and we were all hungry, so we ate it and told the server later. She said she&#39;d turn up the heat. Don&#39;t know if that actually happened. Our entrees came pretty fast after the soup (since it took so long to get that). Food was ok. Not that tasty. Had to keep adding salt/pepper. Wish I had other spices to add. My husband had chicken parm and he said the chicken was delicious, but the marinara sauce had no flavor...just pureed tomato sauce. 
They were out of two of our favorite desserts, which was disappointing. But, what we did have (Nanis Casadetti), was delicious.

When my husband and I first moved to Bartlett, we were worried about finding a good pizza place, but luckily, Pasta Mia was there. 

Their pizza toppings are always wonderful quality--whether it&#39;s the sausage or the eggplant or the ricotta cheese. I would say they could use more meat when it&#39;s ordered, but that seems to be the trend at all pizza places these days. 

I normally order my own pizza because I mainly like veggie pizzas. I suggest the Quattro Formaggi pizza which has four cheeses, fresh sliced tomato and fresh basil leaves on top. I also suggest the eggplant if you&#39;re looking to replace the meat on your pizza.

For under $6, you can get a sandwich with a side of fries or potato salad. I&#39;ve had all of their sandwiches and love them. I recommend the potato salad--it tastes homemade--like someone made it for a picnic. 

Although there is a sit-down area inside, it&#39;s not like going to a sit down restaurant, which I like, but if you&#39;re looking for ambience, it&#39;s not the place.

Finally, there&#39;s always coupons in the paper or Coupon Clipper, so make sure to take advantage. Just today, we ordered more than $25 and got $10 off. If you order a larger pizza, you get a free small cheese pizza.

From first glance, the place is nothing out of the ordinary, conveniently located inside a shopping center in Bartlett.  I love coming here for their food.  It is one of the best authentic tasting Italian restaurants close to the house.  The food is very tasty and authentic, and the portions are always huge.

   When I come here, I always get the Eggplant Rolls, stuffed with ricotta and smothered with marina sauce for $5.50  You get 4 large eggplant rolls, enough for 4 people.  If you want, you can get this as your entr̩e....it is that good.   One of my other favorite is their fried Calamari drenched in Jardonaire.  If you love spicy food and calamarie, this is definitely not one to be missed.  It is not always on their menu so ask the waitress if they have it on their menu.

    I have tried a number of their pastas and antipastos, and have loved them all.

I stand by my positive points of having a local restaurant.  I have also since met who appears to be the owner and he was a very nice guy.  The girl servers are all very friendly and personable.  However I have had a couple of experiences that just prevent me from giving more stars.

I went in for dinner one evening (actually Halloween) with my daughter and some friends.  The kitchen was obviously slammed with orders as the entrance was crowded with people waiting for pizzas.  We were one of three tables in the dining room.  After we sat down and didn&#39;t have our drink orders taken for about five minutes we decided to leave.  It was late and my friend is a diabetic and she needed to get some food in her.  As we were leaving the server came out, I explained we were going to go because it seemed like they were slammed.  He seemed irritated and said they were busy with pizzas but the kitchen was fine.  We opted to leave anyway.  It turned out to be a good decision as our other friend walked in shortly after we left and said they were stuck there waiting for their food (they did get pizza) for an hour and twenty minutes.

More irritating however, is the harassment I have received from Tim S. who appears to be associated with Pasta Mia in some way, I have had the below exchanges with him:

Tim S.a year ago-

I was searching google for reviews for Pasta Mia, and I came across yours. First of all I would like to apologize to you again for the level of service you received on 8/12/2010. I am the General Manager of the all 3 locations, and am aware of what happened. I just wanted you to know the other side of the story. Your server, &#34;Mr.Twitch&#34;, was running 9 tables at the time. Yes, that night we were understaffed. However, you cannot plan on that volume of business especially on a Thursday night. That Thursday night was like a Friday night for us. On Friday nights we have 4 servers for 22 tables and also 4 cooks in the kitchen, 3 pizza cooks, 2 answering phones, 2 managers and 3 drivers. That Thursday we had 2 servers, 1 manager, 2 kitchen cooks, 1 pizza cook and 2 drivers. The manager on duty was actually the owner and was helping in the kitchen as well. That is why it took a while for your food, and a 15% discount was applied to make up for that. Your server applied that discount without asking the owner, and he was very honest and sincere with his apology.  I do hope your server got your order correct and everything tasted to expectations. As far as the &#34;Pee Dance&#34; I know what you are talking about, my 4 year old does it too. I think your server just stands with his legs crossed like that sometimes. Your server works about 65hours (by choice) a week to support his family, he is on his feet a lot and I guess that is comfortable for him. He looked &#34;more crazed&#34; because he was running 9 tables and was running around like a mad man in order to do a good job for his tables so he can make tips to supplement his regular income. Bad service = bad tips. He has another little one on the way next week, and the only things he thinks about is supporting his family and doing the best he can at his job so he has the means to be able to support them. Anyway, again I am sorry for your experience at Pasta Mia, please come back and see us again sometime. 

Sincerely, 
Andrew Linck aka &#34;Mr. Twitch&#34;

Tim S.a month ago-

&#34;I wish someone could write a review on your fake, stupid bitchy ass.  It&#39;s people like you who hide behind computers and say stupid ass shit all the time... &#34;I work in the credit card industry&#34;  WTF does that even mean??? I suppose if you did, you would know that the correct action the owner should have taken would be to call the credit card company and report it lost and they would have instructed him to destroy the card.  You Olive Oyl looking twig, work on your imperfections FIRST, maybe you can get a blue star for that.....&#34;

 Julie B.a moment ago- 

&#34;Wow Tim, great come back. 

You are correct, the proper thing to do would be to destroy the card. However, good business owners have common sense to know that perhaps their paying customers would like to come back and use that card again at their establishment. 

I don&#39;t hide behind my computer and say stupid ass shit all the time, on the contrary I only review when I think an experience warrants it. 

I wish you well in all your endeavors, sorry you are such a hateful little person.&#34;",15/12/11,500,2,1,5,-84,5.143700000000002,5.552999999999999,3.675,34.773,No,4543

But....the way they blacked out the windows now is a bit intimidating.   It&#39;s usually a bit crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, so before when we want to come we kind of look inside as we drive by to see if the bar side is super crowded.  If it is, well, we go somewhere else.  Now we can&#39;t even see inside because they blacked out the windows.  Once, and only once, we walked in, it was too crowded and we left to go somewhere else.  We don&#39;t want to have to walk in everytime we decide we might want to go there.  I also noticed they have a new sign on their window....an &#34;Open&#34; sign.  Gee, I wonder why.....

It took almost 10 minutes after we were seated by a young host who took our drink orders. The waitress, Amanda,  that eventually approached our table, was previously giggling and talking behind the main counter with other servers. When we placed our orders we asked about soups, she quips clam chowder .. she doesn&#39;t mention the other soups, that I later learned,  are available that night .We asked what came with the ribs, she snips &#34;only fries&#34;. In the past we always had a choice given. We asked she go back to the kitchen and ask what our choices are. A while later she comes back and again barks &#34;out of ribs&#34;. We had it with her attitude, so we got up and started to leave. As we were walking out the door a thin blond asks us how was our dinner. After she confirmed she was a manager I gave her some examples of the waitress&#39;s rude attitude, Amanda overhears and runs over to challenge us with &#34;how was I rude&#34;. Maybe the owner may have handled it better, but as I looked over my shoulder, as we exited, the blond and waitress Amanda were laughing and smiling with each other... so much for professionalism and respect in the treatment of your customers. ...by the way, we had a great experience down the street at Savory restaurant.",26/01/14,156,1,1,2,2,1.3064,0.916,0.731,12.351999999999999,No,1462

  We recently had a sit down meal on a Thursday evening when I craved a good sandwich and the wife wanted some pasta. Skipped all other restaurants in town, went here knowing best, and ordered their steak sandwich.  Simple Pizza bread appetizer arrive15 minutes  after ordering. Steak it self was very cold and over cooked.  Sent it back, and was returned to me within 3 minutes, same piece heated on the grill and was under seasoned.  My wife ordered a simple Alfredo pasta and she commented that she&#39;d had better at local chain restaurants.  What&#39;s most concerning is that things appear to be precooked and reheated. The alfredo sauce sounds like it was out of the jar. 

  Unfortunately, the ingredients  and detail to quality has gotten worse over the past year.  Pizza is either burnt or under cooked... yes that can happen. Cheese quality has changed and only the owner(s) will know why!  The family was going to this place for over 3 years now and once upon a time officially claimed this the best pizza joint in Bartlett to all our friends and family. NO MORE

Stick to simple marinara dishes, but know that it will not taste like anyone&#39;s mother is truly cooking this, but rather just some random staff in the back.

pasta-mia-bartlett,Bob R.,9YIBTprpBpK5KJWTOTBnrQ,19iKqvgX4QHJiibL_YPe8g,"Really solid Pizza/Pasta joint near downtown Bartlett. The restaurant seating area is relatively small, but that doesn&#39;t keep people from packing the place on a busy Friday/Saturday night. As you might gather from the name, the pasta is a major draw here. The servings of largely Italian-based pasta dishes are very generous, and should almost automatically be accompanied by a to-go container. 

The pizza here should definitely not be overlooked, as it&#39;s also very decent. If you&#39;re looking for a quick lunch, stop in and order a slice and they&#39;ll cut a generous slice out of a finished pizza on presentation on their large serving counter. They&#39;ll give it a quick blast in the oven and pack it up for you and you&#39;re on your way. If you have the time to fight the crowds on a weekend, the fresh pizza is really the way to go. I&#39;ve had a good experience with it nearly every time.

pub-47-grill-huntley,Amber S.,Y5bJ7wp1k3WSZ6V1czB7Ew,03xCpmjSrAQG1HIiBuz7NA,"I really enjoyed my visit here. I&#39;ve lived in Woodstock for a little over 2 years now. However, being that I come from living very close to Chicago...I&#39;m constantly looking for unique places to dine out at. Local mom-and-pop diners are great, but that&#39;s just not typically what I&#39;m going for in regards to atmosphere. This place had a typical bar feel to it (nothing wrong with that). Their drink options were awesome, the food menu was extensive. The waitstaff was attentive, friendly, and quick to handle any requests.
We had the Beer Nuggets as an appetizer and those were awesome. I LOVE my carbs and these hit the spot. Soft, billowy, fried hunks of pizza dough served with homemade marinara/pizza sauce. I had to cut myself off because they give you a heaping helping and I needed to save room for my actual meal. Lol.
Off the kids menu, I ordered the mac n&#39; cheese for my 2-year-old daughter and a milk. This wasn&#39;t anything super special, but she enjoyed it. What remained, we took home and she finished the next day for lunch. She also put her seal of approval on the Beer Nuggets,
I had their Burger of the Week which was their Black Bean Veggie Burger...which I replaced with a grilled chicken breast. It had guacamole, pepperjack cheese and jalapeno slices on it. Man! It was soooo good, and came with fries that were delicious.
I ordered a dirty martini to start with and it was made well. They didn&#39;t bother with the vermouth (thank you very much) which tells me there is a bartender at work who knows what they&#39;re doing. Then, I had a glass of Murphy-Goode red blend. Again, very good. Surprisingly nice wine selection for a bar atmosphere. My one critique is that both drinks that I had could&#39;ve been a little larger. Both the martini and wine were unusually small pours.

They have a burger special each week that&#39;s usually really good. The GM is great about walking around to check on tables and ask how your service is. I appreciate that the servers are attentive and have a good attitude. On a few occasions I&#39;ve see the chef come out of the kitchen and talk to tables which is fun to see as well. 

I love the Tomato Tower and Szechwan Beef Lettuce Wraps as entrees even though they are on the starters menu - both great options if you&#39;re looking for fresh and light menu ideas. Flatbreads are excellent and easy to share as a starter as well. The Southwest Chicken Wrap is excellent and I&#39;ve ordered the Horseradish Encrusted Salmon numerous times - if it comes out and the crust isn&#39;t a little crispy/crunchy send it back (I&#39;ve only had this happen once but they are happy to fix it for you). I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a bit tricky to have the crust be crunchy but not burnt so I&#39;m happy to cut the kitchen some slack on occasion. ;)

One of the first times my husband &amp; I ordered carry-out for dinner they forgot to put my side salad and my husbands french fries in the bag. When we called to ask if we could come get them the GM asked how far we lived (only about a mile) he offered to have one of their staff members (probably a bus boy) bring it to us. It was so nice and they sent us a short note inviting us back with a small certificate for the trouble.

I checked into yelp and showed the waitress the 15% off,  and she did not deduct it from our bill.   To sum up our meal experience,  we probably will give them another try.   With higher priced entrees you would think service would be spot on.

Perhaps you thought as we did, that it probably was a local dead end type locals bar - but you would have been mistaken, as we clearly were.

We started hearing about this place from different people.  Bikers love the place for its pizza and craft beer selection.  Others like our Doc at Landin Chiropractic Care, raved about their amazing salads and attentive service.

Today we decided to finally check out.  First impressions upon walking in was how warm and inviting it was.  We were greeted by a big smile from our hostess, who offered us various seating options.  

The lighting in the bar area was low but not dark or gloomy, with an open floor plan.  Large windows and plenty of monitors on the walls but nothing like a sports pub.  Some dinning areas are raised, and they offer a combination of low and high tables.   No paper napkins at this place...which is a good sign of things to come.  The servers were dressed in black and quick, helpful and friendly.  The menu is large, but made up of variations of chicken, steak, lsalads and pizza.  Even if your are fickle, you&#39;ll find something on this menu  

My wife ordered a fresh potato chips and dipping sauce - simple but warm and delicious.  For the main order, she had a nice side salad, Chicken Piccata, with asparagus, and garlic mash potatoes.  I ordered the Cobb salad and added grilled steak, with a vinaigrette dressing.   Both our main meals arrived in short time. While waiting I decided to look up Pub47 on YELP to see what others had to say.  A discount coupon popped up offering 15% off our meal...sweet what an unexpected surprise bonus!   

The manager stopped by our table and introduce himself as Gordon and confirmed that we were indeed going to receive a discount.  We exchanged pleasantries, and shared with him that we were here based on what our friends were telling us, and how much we really liked the food.  

So what about the food...

Both our meals were excellent and plated beautifully.  Had we not been so hungry, we would have perhaps thought to take a picture as they looked like plated art.   Our waitress visited often (but not too much) and provided us with plenty of refills on our ice-tea.  When the bill arrived, the 15% discount was there.  In truth, we were never there for the discount from YELP, and we would have happily paid full price for the meal, as it was worth every dollar.   Instead we tipped our waitress higher and waived good bye on our way out - satisfied with our experience at Pub47. 

We will be back soon to try their pizza and craft beers.  This time we&#39;ll gladly park ourselves in the bar area.  You should definitely NOT hesitate to visit this place.  Make sure you proudly mention that you&#39;re a YELPer!",24/04/16,326,4,1,5,-30,9.4871,5.357000000000001,0.796,25.848,No,2862

We recently moved to Huntley and on our first weekend in town we checked this place out! Turns out Pub 47 is also new in town. So I will say, when a new place opens up I like to cut it some slack especially in the service department--the servers and cooks and bartenders are still trying to get everything figured out and there might be some hiccups. 

On our first visit, we took my parents out for lunch.  The owner actually came over to our table to welcome us and tell us the the special drinks they were serving that day.  I thought that was a really nice touch and he sold all 4 of us on a drink! The drinks sounded so good when he described them and I really enjoyed my sangria!

We were sitting in the bar area and although it was busy, we had great service there. The menu has A LOT of options.  I would actually argue that there are too many options and they should consider cutting back.  It does seem like they are just in too many different places at once.  I really do like the wraps and sandwiches options though because that is what I am looking for when I go to a pub or bar.  

Anyway I ordered the Southwestern wrap and I really loved it.  My mom ordered the same thing but felt &#34;meh&#34; about it so I tried hers and figured out they had forgotten the dressing.  Oops. Since her wrap was more than half gone we ended up not saying anything about it.

I visited a second time with my husband on a Friday night and this place was busy! I had the French onion soup which was amazing (with a crap load of cheese how can you go wrong) and pulled pork sliders.  My husband tried a Whiskey Stone Sour off the drink menu and it was great! We ended up recreating them at home later! Service was great again and this time there was nothing wrong with the food! 

I really like the food and the atmosphere at this place.  It is honestly a bar where I feel like I could go and hang out and have drinks and not feel out of place.",22/05/15,209,4,1,5,8,5.927899999999999,3.1100000000000003,0.7669999999999999,20.124,No,1990

From the wait staff to the management (Ben) everyone was very kind, and the food was delicious. If you want food that is more upscale from your typical greasy bar food this is the location you want to eat. I had the Santa Fe chicken salad and the French onion soup. The Gruyere cheese was fantastic. My wife had the Ruben and it was stacked full of quality meat.  Every few weeks they have a tap take over with the local crystal lake brewery...

pub-47-grill-huntley,Anthony J.,ZEkTTLQ0a_c_7-JcPKnRWw,UOAvO1T9ROO9vOmXVxXyQA,"My wife and I went to Pub 47 with 4 of our friends on Saturday, September 17 at 6:30pm. We were seated by the window so I had an excellent view of behind the bar. We all had dinner and drinks. We suspected the drinks were being watered down when throughout the evening every one of us had 4 shots of Patron each and 2-3 beers or mixed drinks each as well and none of felt even the hint of a buzz. I personally am a lightweight. If I have 2 bottles of beer at home I&#39;m buzzed. So I thought it was strange but when the other people said the same thing about not feeling the drinks, it was confirmed. However, we didn&#39;t say anything until we physically caught the bartender. My wife ordered her 2nd mojito for the night. When she got it, it was so full of ice that she couldn&#39;t even get the straw to go all the way through. So she started taking scoops of ice out. After taking 3-4 scoops out, the glass was still over half full of ice and there was next to no drink. It was ridiculous! So she asked the waitress if she could just have a new one made because there was just too much ice and no drink. The waitress was very nice and we saw her tell the bartender (we were in sight of behind the bar but we were not within ear shot). The bartender just took the glass and filled it with spritzer water and gave it back to her!!!!!! When we told the waitress what the bartender did, she went and got the bartender. When the bartender came over she came with a serious bad attitude. When my wife explained what I saw, she tried to make some lame excuse and was very confrontational. She didn&#39;t listen to anything my wife had to say. She just kept saying, &#34;So you want a double.&#34; My wife said nothing like that. She said, &#34;No, I only want what I ordered. &#34; However, after realizing she was getting nothing but attitude from the bartender, she finally just said fine in order to not ruin our evening with friends. We spent nearly $600 that night between the 4 of us. Bought 24 shots, 10+ beers, 6 meals &amp; appetizers and 3+ mixed drinks. We only had an issue with 1 drink and got incredible attitude including dirty looks all night after that!!! To add insult to injury, you guys had the nerve to charge my wife for the double that she didn&#39;t even want!!!!! Absolutely ridiculous!! We will never go in to your establishment again and we will be certain to tell EVERYONE we come across about our horrible experience!!!!",25/09/16,268,1,1,-2,-29,-2.6805,1.3179999999999998,3.239,25.443000000000005,No,2448

Our waitress was amazing. Kept asking if we needed anything all night. My one year old had a French fry, gagged, and threw up on the floor. The staff was so helpful and helped clean without hesitation. The owner even came by and asked if we were alright and if we lost anything in the mess. We all laughed and got back to eating. 

The food was good. I got the chicken Caesar wrap. It came with a little cup of dressing. Maybe a little bigger cup next time or ask to put dressing on the wrap. Their French fries are FANTASTIC! And if you like Mac n Cheese this place should be your next stop.

pub-47-grill-huntley,Stacey S.,bl7zTxk7oNfo7T2XRE_ynA,UhbVN8brtgtbehb8-zmQew,"Last night was actually my second trip to Pub 47.  I was so excited that a new place was opening up close to home.  The first visit was last Thursday night.  When we first walked in i was impressed with what was done to the interior.  It was warm and inviting.  We were seated, there were 5 of us (3 adults 2 kids).  I ordered the cod dinner with asparagus, the girls ordered the build your own pizza.  The other two adults got the salmon &amp; hamburger.  We were very impressed with the menu.  There were some really good options &amp; it all sounded great.  Our server was very nice &amp; attentive but a bit scattered.  I dismissed that because it is a new place &amp; a new ordering system.  When our food arrived we were all a bit disappointed.  My asparagus consisted of two miniscule over cooked droopy stalks that were tossed across my plate, my friends salmon was clearly over cooked &amp; dry with an odd stalk of rosemary sticking out of it, the hamburger had a huge clump of guacamole on top &amp; the pizza the kids ordered was wrong.  The food tasted ok, not horrible but clearly not as good as the menu descriptions sounded!  I decided to not write a review based on this visit and give it one more shot before i wrote a review.

My second visit was Saturday night and the place was very busy... A good sign!  My husband and i decided to go out for drinks &amp; appetizers.  We sat at the bar and ordered 3 items.  First we ordered drinks, nothing fancy, my husband got a beer &amp; i got a vodka cranberry.  Then we ordered the crab cakes, beef skewers, &amp; rock shrimp.  I liked the crab cakes, my husband did not.  There was a lot of filling &amp; very little crab which bothered him but the flavor was good so i was fine with it.  The rock shrimp were pretty good, very generic and nothing special but I liked them.  The beef skewers where another story.  I was really excited for those because they were supposed to have a horseradish sauce, which I love.  I was so disappointed, the skewers were so drenched in sauce you could hardly tell there was meat under it and there was not even a hint of horseradish.  The sauce was so bland and boring.

To summarize, the atmosphere is good, the service is good, the menu sounds fantastic but is very poorly executed.

I was hoping a new start for the chef would help.  After eating here, I am just under the impression John Hennessy can&#39;t cook.  Probably why his other endeavors have failed.

We decided to get an array of appetizers.

The calamari was really greasy and had no flavor. 

 We got the chicken strips, which were rubberized planks.  There is a thing called brining to make them juicy, give it a try guys.

The cheese curds were OK, but they looked they were purchased from a vendor.

pub-47-grill-huntley,Jane K.,5XkFaFlbzOo-ux-S-GS-sw,RRAEcppqLgTJP-yyHdpfVw,"A coworker mentioned how she has eaten here before and she had a great experience. So I decided to try it out, I always love to eat and try to places. Now, she did dine-in and I ordered carry out so maybe this effects the quality of the meal (it shouldn&#39;t). 

The process started out unprofessional and weird. I called in my order and it took a while. From me telling them what I want, to finding out my total took way too long. I first spoke to one person who took my order then I was transferred to someone else who was supposed to give me a total. While I was &#34;put on hold&#34; by the second person, I heard everything they were saying. It was unprofessional and unorganized. The person even said &#34;this is such a mess&#34;. My thought was &#34;if the ordering process is a mess and unorganized, I wonder how my food will be&#34;. After receiving my order (half soup, half salad) I was unsatisfied. Let&#39;s just say, Huntley doesn&#39;t offer many good food options anyway, and this didn&#39;t sway my opinion. My Cesar salad was drenched in dressing that seemed watered down :(. I ordered salmon to add to the salad which seemed like a fancy option...it wasn&#39;t. It was plain and tasteless. On top of that, the price for the salmon as an add-on was inconsistent (yelp) had a pic of the menu and it said $4 yet they told me $5. Seems like a huge rip-off for the quality and taste. 

One bright side to my lunch was the French onion soup wasn&#39;t bad. Would I come back here? Most likely not. They don&#39;t even have the hours open on yelp. It took me three calls until someone answered at noon. I was first wondering if they even are open for lunch, apparently they are but I couldn&#39;t find the hours anywhere and no one answered the first few calls.",09/03/15,202,2,2,1,21,0.5351999999999999,1.566,1.546,20.887999999999998,No,1775

Today I came in for a quick lunch with my daughter who had the pulled pork sandwich. Sauce was a bit bland for our taste and the pork was decent but would likely not order again. 

The &#34;homemade&#34; Italian beef was dry and had no flavor. This was more &#34;French dip&#34; than Italian beef.   There was no traditional oregano/garlic juice, just dry dry dry meat and a side of au jus which also had no flavor. Won&#39;t order this again as it was poorly prepared.

We sat down and waited about 20 minutes then decided to go up to the bar to ask for drinks because we were hungry/thirsty. Werent irritated or anything just hoped for a drink while we waited. They said since we had a table our waitress should be taking our order and to sit down and wait. Then once we got our drinks (from a waitress that wasnt her) she finally came over and told us we couldn&#39;t sit at the table because we only ordered drinks that we had to go to the bar. Only reason we hadnt ordered food is because she hadnt come to take our order! We had reserved that table with our friends btw. She did not ask nicely she acted as if we were horrible people for thinking we could sit there. So weird. She smacked the bill down on the table and left immediately. I was in shock because we hadn&#39;t done anything to be treated this way we wanted to have a relaxing night with food and drinks. She also gave herself a 10 dollar tip out of our friends bill without asking(they paid in cash) Who does that??!! Overall ridiculous experience.

I ordered a cheeseburger with Swiss cheese, pickles and onions, and a child&#39;s portion of macaroni and cheese for take out. When I got home I had a cheeseburger with American cheese, onions, and a pickle spear in the box, and a small order of pasta w red sauce. I called to let them know of the mistakes and in their defense they did ask if I wanted to come back in to make it right, I told them no as I had just got home and didn&#39;t feel like venturing out again. They did not however ask if I wanted some type of refund or credit to possibly use the next time I would come in. ALL of the food was very bland and tasteless, the pasta with red sauce I took 2 bites of and threw away, so not only was it wrong it was just not good at all. The burger tasted like they threw some meat on the grill and did nothing to it, no spices, no salt or pepper, no taste what so ever, I did not finish that either. I&#39;ve seen some poor reports on here as far as takeout orders but that shouldn&#39;t be an issue as takeout or dining in the food should taste the same, and if what I had tonight is indicative of what the food is like I&#39;m not sure right now if I will go back to give it another try or not. I really hope that the owners and or the people responsible take the time to read the reviews of their establishment, and take them seriously as there are not a ton of food options in the immediate area and they have a chance to distinguish themselves from all the other options.

charlie-foxs-pizzeria-and-eatery-st-charles,Amanda O.,mSSRX_XWF31iVl5oAiC1Ow,HW5iz1mEmlwGs02JZzHeiw,"We visited Charlie Fox&#39;s Pizzeria in St. Charles for my husband&#39;s birthday in January. My experience there was just ok.  For a Friday night, the place was surprisingly not too busy. I initially visited because I read that this place was voted best in the Fox Valley or something like that, so maybe my expectations were just too high.

Let&#39;s start with what I liked. I did like the old school Trivial Pursuit cards that are on all of the tables. I liked having something to do while we waited for our food. I also thought the food was good.  Not great, just good. I&#39;ve definitely had better pizza in the Fox Valley. We started with the Heart Attack on a Plate...ahem, I mean the Charlie Chips (kettle chips covered with bacon and mozzarella cheese) and, while greasy, it did taste good. The pizza was just average.

I did not like the service here. Everything just took SO LONG! Just being seated took about 10 minutes. When we walked in there were people at the counter picking up to-go orders and we didn&#39;t even get a &#34;be with you in a few minutes&#34;. We just stood there, waiting. The staff could&#39;ve been way more attentive. From ordering, to waiting on our food, then waiting for our check - everything just took forever. I couldn&#39;t understand the wait. There were plenty of empty tables so they weren&#39;t working at capacity, and it still took a really long time for everything.

Overall, with so many other pizza options in the area, I&#39;m not sure that we&#39;ll return.",11/02/15,165,2,2,3,21,2.1412999999999998,2.144,1.4020000000000001,17.454,No,1515

If you want to wait less time get it from Charlie&#39;s in Geneva, but I warn you, they&#39;re quicker because they are not as good, people from Geneva get it from st. Charles because they just don&#39;t compare. 

Their fried mushrooms are amazing! The ranch that comes with is so yummy.  And the pizza with Italian beef and giardinaire is sooooo addicting.

The new dining room here at Rt 64 and Peck is almost spartan in appearance. Kind of like an updated and sterilized Barnaby&#39;s look.

The food is the same food you can order for take-out or delivery. They bring you a basket of peanuts and encourage you to throw the shells on the floor.

Time of my visit: Late dinner

I was in a mood for a calzone all week, so finally, today, I decided to have one for dinner.

I pass this place on my way to work, I used to know the place that used to occupy that space.  We phoned in our order. For pick up.  We ordered two calzones, one with BBQ chicken, another with BBQ chicken and onions.

About 30 minutes later, we picked it up.  The calzones looked huge!  I don&#39;t think I have ever seen them that big!

I can&#39;t speak for my girlfriend, so I will give my review.  I enjoyed, I thought it was a decent calzone.  It was a nice ratio between cheese and toppings.  Personally, I prefer thicker crust for a better grip, but I am also weird when it comes to that.

Ordered a half jalapeno/pepperoni and half sausage/mushroom/giardenara pizza. Also got cheese sticks. The pizza was absolutely fantastic. We just moved to the area and I&#39;ve been shopping for a go to pizza place. This is it. The ingredients were fresh and they certainly did not skimp on them. I very much appreciate when places use fresh mushrooms too, which they did. The crust was very thin (which I like and had the perfect combo of crunch and chewiness. The crust was also flavorful, which is something many pizza places in the area lack. They use a LOT of cheese. I may ask them to tone it down next time. Pizza is delivered HOT.

I ordered the cheese sticks based on other reviewers&#39; recommendations. They did not disappoint at all. The marinara dipping sauce was really good too.

On to the cons of which there are several. I ordered using Yelps grubhub knock-off, Eat24. I ordered at around 5 and set the delivery time for 730PM. I received the pizza around 6PM.

I ordered a large pizza. It was shoved in a box that seemed to be designed for a pizza about an inch or two smaller. This caused the pizza to get a little misshapen and curled up. Kind of annoying. 

The cheese sticks came in a small brown bag. They were crushed and torn apart. Still tasty but looked a mess.

Granted, I haven&#39;t been to very many, but I do prefer this place over Algonquin Mexican Restaurant or North of the Border (although both of those are very good too). 

Once seated, they give you complimentary chips and salsa (green is mild, red is hot). Both salsas are good as well as the chips, but the red salsa is fire-hot.. I like hot, but it&#39;s too much for me. 

For appetizers, I&#39;ve only tried the Sopes (with shredded beef) and they are amazing. I could totally order it as my meal and it&#39;s really filling (you get two with your order - see my photos). the beef is very flavorful and tender and all of the toppings make it perfect. 

When I dine in, I usually order the #2, which is a 1/2 skirt steak, chicken taco and cheese enchilada. The skirt steak is probably the best skirt steak I&#39;ve had at any Mexican restaurant. Not chewy, not fatty.. Perfectly juicy and tender. The chicken taco is delicious and the cheese enchilada is pretty good (lots of cheese of you are a cheese lover, and very sausey).

We never have a bad meal and our service is usually top-notch (although, our favorite waiter just recently got a new job and is no longer at El Molino).

I am not a big drinker... as in I maybe have two drinks a year but when I go to El Molino, I cannot pass up their strawberry margarita (frozen, sugar on the side, please).

el-molino-mexican-restaurant-carpentersville,Eric E.,VkH1Fm9Vn4ohQTT0CC9QFA,Pv6n6Y3wjVct0dyueLeqZw,"Used to visit here fairly regularly when I lived nearby.

First visit in 4+ years. Walked in and welcomed warmly.

Sat at one table, but thought a window would be nice since the sun was shining. Noticed some dirty silverware someone hid behind the table sign, and pointed this out. Second table, something sticky on silverware, possibly a spray from some juice.

Both times, servers were quick to respond and very friendly. They had a big night with some celebration, and it seems they were eager to get out and were a little sloppy. But, the sincere and very quick responses, along with the look of embarrassment on our server made me think this was not normal. ;) 

On to the excellent food!

The rest of the restaurant was clean, the chips &amp; salsa left at the table were fresh and wonderfully flavored. The red was crisp and hot, while the green had a fresh and warm flavor.

My wife ordered an appetizer sampler (don&#39;t remember what it was called) and I tried the Panzon for lunch. The appetizer contained quesadilla&#39;s (upgraded to the portabella from the dinner menu), and two other items I don&#39;t remember. She loved them, and especially recommends the portabella quesadilla! The Panzon was made with machaca meat, and was outstanding. The chipotle sauce was warm and aromatic, with just the right amount of heat and flavor. The meat was well seasoned, and the corn tortilla was the perfect carrier for the rest. Rice and beans were decent, but the entire half of a perfectly ripe avacado was a bonus!

We didn&#39;t try the margarita&#39;s, but the friends I used to come here with drove 45 minutes for them. Since the owners are still the same, I&#39;m assuming this still holds. ;) 

Service overall was outstanding, with our server stopping by on occasion to check on drinks and take away anything we were finished with, but not making us feel rushed. Perfect balance, here.",15/04/13,219,4,2,5,35,8.3495,5.183999999999999,0.44,17.375,No,1899

If you are at a restaurant that claims Mexican food... There should not be shredded beef or ground beef on the menu.. Or soft or hard shell taco.

el-molino-mexican-restaurant-carpentersville,Restaurant Vigilant E.,wqWJzo62RE8DmSYqFKmutg,dPT7U6YCiL_iDx9OMj4SKA,"Last night, my family took me to El Molino for my birthday dinner. I have been coming to El Molino since the early 1980&#39;s, when the place first opened shop in an old dairy queen drive thru and the main dining room was actually where you would park your car. Growing up, it was my favorite restaurant - I hadn&#39;t been there in years, but was so looking forward to it!!! Pulling in, the place looks much the way it did in the 1990&#39;s - a comforting thing. I noticed the parking lot was a little light (it was always packed on the weekends), but it being a Sunday night, I didn&#39;t think much of it.

We had a reservation for 6 and were quickly shown to a table - though we had to add another place setting as it had been set up for a 5 top. A gentleman came and filled our water glasses immediately and made friendly conversation. Chips and salsa arrived asap and I was thrilled to note that the distinctive red salsa and green salsa hadn&#39;t changed at all - would know those flavors anywhere. A waiter came fairly quickly to take our drink order - a nice enough guy, but seemed a bit unsure of himself - maybe brand new to food service? 

We ordered 4 margaritas, a few soft drinks and some guacamole. After a time, the drinks came - no one seemed to like their margaritas. My brother in law, who is a mixologist couldn&#39;t even identify the peculiar flavor they seemed to have...he suspected that they were using an off-market brand equivalent of Grand Marnier, but wasn&#39;t sure what the strange taste was. The waiter took our dinner orders, writing everything down verbatim. He then recited the order (correctly) in a long, drawn out litany...several minutes passed and we still had not received our guac - we flagged him down and he apologized. The quac appearing almost instantly after this.

So, the quac...it was fine, well presented...just sort of &#34;yawn...&#34;...I could not detect any lime or salt, not a hint of spice nor any real trace of cilantro. It seemed as though it was avocado, tomato and onion and that was it. I don&#39;t know if they were trying to cater to weak American palates or what, but, though certainly edible, it was pretty bland and didn&#39;t do much for us.

The food came after a reasonable length of time. The waiter didn&#39;t seem to know which chimmi was beef and which was chicken...we realized soon that they were both beef, because he had forgotten to put in the chicken chimi (mine)...I sat there while everyone else was served, insisting they go ahead and start. The waiter said &#34;Their just finishing yours, it will be up in 30 seconds&#34; but it was clear he hadn&#39;t ordered it. After about 5 or 10 minutes, he comes out with it...the plate itself was about 400 degrees and - as I used to work in kitchens - I could tell someone had but it under a salamander broiler post-haste...the beans were fine, though bland...the rice was ok...the pico seemed fresh...a side of the bland guacamole accompanied the dish. The chimi itself was not crisp (as it should be and used to be back in the day)....the cheese was still quality Chihuahua cheese which I was happy to see - the chicken was pretty good, but again bland...

Overall here is what I would say...the physical building/atmosphere is perfectly fine. The service was very friendly and they tried - they were just sort of incompetent...the food...while I am not claiming this is &#34;authentic Mexican food&#34; - it does have some authentic undertones (I am thinking the salsa and some of the ingredients used)....this is really Tex-mex food - the food has suffered a bit over the years though...it is ok, but in my mind it was always just way way up there and very few other places could even touch it...I still feel that it is better than a lot of similar places in the area (though those with actual authentic food, I consider to be in a separate category - sometimes you want Mexican, sometimes you want tex-mex you know)...but I can&#39;t give this a super high rating. I will....with sadness give it a 3...and remember it in better times during my 1980&#39;s childhood....your getting a 3 ONLY out of loyalty from me",08/09/14,451,3,3,5,56,6.0487,2.2990000000000004,0.612,22.088,No,4148

el-molino-mexican-restaurant-carpentersville,Brandy N.,X5AOC11OP8hF9CTp7-boZQ,m_R_BJPOGMlFFgDm4X5b_w,"Tonight was my first experience at El Molino. We picked up the food for carry out. 

I liked the service provided by the person who answered my call and helped me with my order since no menu was available online or by fax. Very helpful and patient, willing to recommend items when I asked (such as the El Molino Enchilada).

We wanted to sample a few things so we had taco dinners served with rice &amp; beans (one beef, one carne asada), chicken flouta &amp; an enchilada (El Molino Enchilada). 

Highlights/Pros: 
I highly recommend the El Molino Enchilada. It has a very yummy red/tomato sauce and they recommended the muchaca beef (shredded beef) which was delicious.
The chicken flouta as expected is not of course overflowing with flavor (mild) but if you like something on the mild side that is deep fried it was really good.
I noticed the carne asada was quite tender and had limited fat, much appreciated. 
The green sauce was very flavorful.
The guacamole is very tasty. 

Cons:
A little on the pricey side compared to other mexican carry out options but the overall quality and presentation proved this to be worth it.
I didn&#39;t like that they charged $1 for the green sauce (it&#39;s a large portion) most places include that with the purchase of a dinner.
I have to believe that the cook forgot to add any toppings to my carne asada tacos since I can&#39;t imagine they would serve these plain (must have cheese, cilantro at least for more flavor and of course add green sauce and my favorite fresh avocado).
No menu available online or by fax.

Worst part of the experience was definitely the beef tacos. The ground beef appeared to have no seasoning and tasted extremely bland. I would recommend another meat choice for sure unless you are accustomed to eating simple  browned ground beef of course.

We will be back soon, and plan to dine onsite next time and try the Sangria!!",26/05/12,225,4,2,4,21,3.4501000000000004,2.115,1.069,15.816999999999998,No,1896

First thing that came to mind was Mexican.  I had not been to El Molino since I was a youngster in grade school so I didn&#39;t know what to expect.  

This restaurant has been in the area for years.  The building itself looks a bit run down, but that generally does not bother me.  Inside, the decor was typical Mexican Cantina.  Although we walked in right at the lunch hour, the restaurant was basically quiet.  A few other parties were dining as we were escorted to our seats.  

Chips and salsa arrived -- as another reviewer reported, BEST tomatillo salsa I have ever had as well.  Exquisite flavor.

I ordered a trio of enchaladas, one chicken, one cheese and one shredded beef.  Service was timely and soon thereafter, we all hand our lunches.  I ordered mine with a medium heat sauce and it was just right for me. Rice and beans rounded out the dish.  Flavor was very good. 

A good lunch experience to be sure, but I thought the prices were high.  $12pp for Mexican at lunch seems a bit steep.  They do not have a lunch menu per se, so you order off the dinner menu at the dinner menu prices.  I&#39;d have easily given el Molino a 4-star rating if their prices were a bit more in line with the competition.",17/10/09,151,3,1,4,7,3.2257000000000002,1.798,0.0,17.202,No,1303

Unfortunately, we were not that impressed food-wise.  For us, the real measure of a Mexican restaurant is their chips and salsa.  The chips were ok but the salsa wasn&#39;t all the great.  The tomatillo salsa was extremely sour and needed more salt.  The red salsa did have a bit more heat but left a bad taste.  For dinner, we ordered the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas with the molino sauce.  I really wanted to love them, but didn&#39;t.  The enchiladas were bland and the sauce seemed to have dried up when the plate was put in the oven so everything tasted dry.  

While we weren&#39;t terribly impressed with the food, the service was completely different.  Everyone was super nice and helpful.  We were amazed at how quickly our food came out...less than 15 minutes after putting in our order.  But even with the great service...and maybe we just went on a bad night....I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back.",03/11/09,110,2,2,1,19,0.9964,1.986,1.43,9.583,No,1050

I was looking forward to El Molino because of the mostly positive Yelp reviews. I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, especially the bar.  It&#39;s very cozy and inviting.  I ordered the margarita on special, the 1800 margarita for $6.  It was very good for $6.  After my friend arrived and we were seated is when the evening started to turn.  Our server acted rushed and aggravated with us the whole time we were there.  We were seated at 7pm, so it was hardly as though we were holding him up at closing time, nor was there a wait so it&#39;s not as though we were tying up the table.  He acted pissy when we weren&#39;t ready to order within a minute of sitting down, and proceeded to rush us the whole meal.

Now, I&#39;m not sure if my expectations were too high, but i was very disappointed in the food, especially given the price.  The chips and salsa were &#34;meh&#34; and my entree was average at best.

Most recently we went on 1/2 price and trivia night. I will definitely go back for this combo again. Mister Trivia was hilarious and even though we were awful, he was kind and made some light-hearted jokes. The food was very good. I had filet sliders and had them sub in some crispy onion strings.

It was a very busy night to be fair, however, I was there to celebrate my cousin&#39;s 9th birthday. As soon as we sat down, I told our waiter that she was turning 9.

Both tables ordered, were served their dinner and had their leftovers packed to go, we were served! At that point, the manager was walking around talking to tables. I approached the hostess and asked if she could send over the manager. Very rudely she asked why. I gave her a brief explanation, and her response was simply, &#34;well we&#39;ve been very busy tonight.&#34; Nothing more. I returned to my table and the food was out a couple minutes later, however our waiter did not say one word to us. No apologies either. After we were done eating, our waiter took away our plates, (didn&#39;t offer to pack it up), the manager never came over and to add insult to injury, no dessert menu was brought out, and no cake/ice cream, etc was brought for my cousin&#39;s birthday.

I ate here with my wife, daughter and mother in law. Each of us agree that for the price, we had gotten a better meal at Olive Garden. For starters we ordered the calamari, which was cool when served. The overall flavor was plain, which made us ask for extra marinara sauce. 

Our meals arrived after to parties that arrived after ours. I ordered a Chicken Cesar Salad. My wife ordered penni pasta with meat sauce. My mother in law had the salmon with salad. 

My salad was mediocre. The chicken was dry and looked like it was cooked on George Forman grill.

My wife&#39;s pasta was over cooked and soggy. The meat sauce tasted like canned pasta sauce.

My mother in laws salmon was actually the best dish. Nice size cut of salmon. Only issue was asparagus was limp and like the pasta soggy.

I went with a friend on Friday night. Reservations were honored for our 6:30 time and it was packed. The restaurant is small and very tight. The waitress was calm and accurate, despite having multiple tables to handle. Food came out quickly, yet did not feel rushed. 

Friend had the chocolate martini and loved it. 

We ordered the bruchetta-delicious. It tasted like what it should. 

I ordered the chicken vesuvio, but asked for white meat only, boneless. It was very good. Order also came with a salad and vesuvio potatoes. 

Friend did a pick your pasta. The options are limitless. She enjoyed the dish and the portion size was enormous. It was angel hair with olive oil/garlic, fresh mozzarella and shrimp. 

We ordered the cannoli flight, which is 4 different types of cannolis sample sized. They are made in house, but did not seem freshly appeared as the cannoli shell was soft. 

Huge drink menu options.

It didn&#39;t take long for my wife and I to agree that we&#39;d made the right decision! 

We came in on a Sunday night &amp; were pleasantly greeted with a smile by the owner (that is by assumption). There is a nice wood bar to the left with a fully stocked bar...appeared to have a decent selection of wines but I did not sample. The dining room we were guided to was just off from where the bar area is. We found it perfectly intimate for the type of dining experience we were looking for. 

Once to our seats, we were greeted, drink orders taken and then received continued attention by our very nice server (cant remember his name). It appeared he was the only server on, but handled the four seated tables generously. I had a few Birra Moretti&#39;s and she had an iced tea. 

There were a lot of delicious appetizers on the menu, but knew they were going to fill up our plates so decided to hold off. 

My wife had a house salad and I ordered the French Onion soup before our entrees came. It was simply AMAZING! You could tell that everything was done fresh that day. I wanted to take a bath in that stuff. 

We both ordered one of the specials for the night. I ordered the linguine dish that had shrimp, calamari &amp; mussels in a fresh tomato/wine sauce. Again it was just amazing. Seafood was fresh and the sauce was to die for. My wife had the Spinach Manicotti. She was just as pleased. Both entrees were huge and made for a great reheated lunch today! 

We topped off the meal with desert and had the peanut/chocolate Gelato. We split and had the bowl gone in no time! 

The electricity went out in downtown CL during the end of our dinner, but everything was handled perfectly and we were all made comfortable.

This is hands down the best Italian food I have ever had in the McHenry County area (with Cucina Bella in Algonquin coming in at a close second).

Not to mention I still had plenty of leftovers! I loved the food, service and atmosphere so much that I decided to book my wedding rehearsal dinner here. Now, this is not something they typically do. Since the restaurant opens at 4pm, they opened EARLY and allowed our wedding party to come in for a  late AND PRIVATE lunch between 2-4pm. It was awesome! Everyone loved it.

Unfortunately that&#39;s where it stopped. We walked in and because we didn&#39;t have a reservation we were relegated to the bar area with VERY small pub tables. Much too small for any sort of meal, but we stayed because we were really hungry.  

My husband ordered the pork tenderloin (he liked it).  I had ordered pasta with aglio olio (my standard for an Italian restaurant).  After a few bites I noticed that my throat was starting to burn.  At that point I just assumed that it was the garlic that was making it spicy so I had my husband taste it.  He agreed that it was spicy.  The more I ate the more my mouth was burning and my lips were tingling.  We come to find out they use crushed red pepper to make their aglio olio.  I barely ate half of my meal.  We told the hostess that my dish was much too spicy for me to eat when she came by to check on us. At which point she asked if I wanted it wrapped up.  Ummmm, what part of much too spicy for me to eat did you not understand?  Other restaurants would comp your meal if you didn&#39;t like it.  This place?  No way!

They also seem to cater to their frequent patrons (based on how many people the hostess knew by first name when they came in with their reservations) and forget about the new customers.

The owners go around to the people they know but not to those they don&#39;t and I feel it should be the other way around.  Overall the experience was good and I will definitely go back.

I went with my best friend for years, and we both loved this place.  This is a beautiful restaurant that has the most authentic Italian food since your Italian Grandmother. 

Food: I ordered a key lime pie martini, which was delicious, and probably the best martini I&#39;ve had in a long time. My friend and I  ordered the grilled calamari as an appetizer. So Good! My friend took a trip to Greece in 2009, and said this was the freshest calamari she has had since her trip where she watched the boats come in with the fish they cooked that day!!! My friend was so pleased with the calamari that she ordered a linguini-calamari with red sauce entr̩e that she loved just as much. I was really craving angel hair with their homemade vodka sauce. I have a boyfriend that comes from a very Italian family that originates from Sicily, and Da Baffone&#39;s sauce was better than my boyfriend&#39;s mother&#39;s. That is huge! And to top off the evening, my friend and I sampled a shot of the owners homemade Limoncello which was just what we wanted.

Service: Our server&#39;s name was Raymond who had a great knowledge of the food and made great recommendations. He was super friendly and had many other tables, but still brought everything out quickly which was perfect because I was starving. 

We met the owners of the restaurant: Camille and Dom. They were awesome!!!  Camille went to every table and talked to every guest.

da-baffone-cucina-italiana-crystal-lake,Jennifer G.,TSpfyh3QkAjZ9j44ggHoyw,vpERRse4_rG98KRYANpnMA,"This restaurant used to be Cucina Bella.  The interior is exactly the same which is fine, really, and lends itself to the &#34;authentic&#34; Italian feel that I assume they&#39;re going for.

What is it they say about first impressions?  Right.  So, shortly after we were seated, the owner, clad in a completely see through shirt and black bra (very classy) proceeded to mock customers who had requested to be sat at a different table than the one the hostess chose for them...very rude and unprofessional!  Thankfully, our waiter, was courteous and did his job well.  Serving is not easy and he earned one of my two stars.

On to the food...

Where to start...well, appetizers of course.  They bring out a basket of bread for you to dip in oil...that was very good.  We ordered the caprese and the calamari fritta.  The caprese was very good (but really, it would be hard to mess up tomato, cheese and basil,) but the calamari was definitely chewy - no one likes chewy calamari!  

On to the main courses.  I ordered one of the specials, a stuffed pork chop saltimbocca and my husband ordered mussels.  The mussels were nothing that you couldn&#39;t get at any Olive Garden - the sauce was mediocre at best which is sad for an &#34;Italian&#34; restaurant..bland and metallic tasting, wait...did that come from a can??  My dish, the pork chop saltimbocca was pretty sad.  They basically punished the vegetables on the plate (zucchini,  yellow squash and asparagus) by cooking them for as long as possible resulting in total mushy grossness.  The chop itself was overcooked and literally drowning in buttery goop.  The taste of each component was so completely overwhelmed by the goop that there was no discerning between the chop, the squash and the pile of noodles on the side.  It was so bad that I took maybe three bites before putting my fork and butter knife (the butter knife which was supposed to be adequate for cutting a stuffed chop) down and calling it quits.

So why two stars?  Trust me, it would have been one at best, however, the cleverly clad customer mocking owner noticed that my meal was basically untouched and actually took it off the bill without my asking (that&#39;s not how I roll, I will generally pay and just not go back.)  She even took the time, with her fantastic black bra in our faces, to ask me what, in particular, I disliked about the dish.  So, two stars for that. 

Ultimately, no, we won&#39;t go back there again...perhaps if Gordon Ramsey came in to save their sad culinary offering we would reconsider, but for now, not a chance.",19/03/11,292,2,1,1,-16,0.8392000000000002,2.125,1.6109999999999998,20.264999999999997,No,2574

After we were seated and got our first round of drinks our waitress said she recognized us from previous visits, kudos to her. Our entire meal, before dinner drinks, appetizer, entree, dessert and after dinner drinks was just over $100, before tip so I consider it very affordable as well. Everything they put in front of us was outstanding; we had anti pasta for an appetizer that was made to order and not only was it delicious the serving size could have been a meal in itself. I selected a tuna dish for my entree and asked our server what doneness it&#39;s cooked and she said &#34;any way you want it.&#34; Again, very impressive so I ordered mine rare and it was lovely as my wife&#39;s ravioli was as well. After dinner we spotted a guy (an employee) who looked so much like a friend of mine I showed our server a pic I had of him on my cell and she said, &#34;Hey tony, come look at this!&#34; Tony, my friend&#39;s doppelganger, is one of the owners. He got a kick out of the picture, stayed for a chat and when our server mentioned we were &#34;regulars&#34; who were celebrating my wife&#39;s birthday he immediately said, &#34;bring them something nice on me.&#34; So we got our dessert comped and our server gave us to lemon drops (drinks) to boot.

I ordered Chicken Giambotta, which I love, and much to my dismay the chef forgot the sausage!!! Pretty bad since it helps make the dish. 
Since it was very busy and our waiter did have a number of tables I decided to just keep eating it. Now I&#39;m not a big eater so I always have something to take home. Leaving half my order I told our waiter to box it but I wanted him to know there was no sausage. He seemed concerned and went to tell the chef. When he came back he sort of apologized and gave our table (me, my wife &amp; daughter) one free piece of carrot cake. First of all none of us were even ordering desert and if we were, why carrot cake? Secondly, the problem was mine, not the other people at our table. I just believe this was not handled properly. I would have preferred the chef coming out to apologize instead of carrot cake I didn&#39;t even want. 
Now when it came to the meal itself the food was good though no sausage. I tried my daughter&#39;s Chicken Parmaggiane since she also brought some home and it was delicious. Their pasta sauce is very good (which is another reason I added the star). The complimentary homemade bread was also very good. 
I will go back again hoping that my next experience is better.",18/01/11,150,3,2,4,32,3.7069,2.63,0.907,13.464000000000002,No,1314
da-baffone-cucina-italiana-crystal-lake,Tracy M.,VGf9Hc88kvJEOwfLdP7lFA,FQYwjKfmuifkwJoe5PX4mQ,"I wish I could have given this place five stars.  
I looked on the website before making the reservation - many great sounding entrees, and especially some desserts that we couldn&#39;t wait to try.
As mentioned above, it has all the charm you could ask for.  The service was great.  The entertainment was great - the singer had a terrific voice.  Everyone was so friendly.  Everything you could ask for - except...
Actaully, the food started off strong.  The bread and salads were absolutely delicious.  Also, a side of asparagus was cooked to perfection, and seasoned with something wonderful.
But.
The entrees went from too bland to bother with, to literally inedible.  The Braciola was just... blah.  You could eat it - but why would you want to .  No seasoning, no browning, no flavor...
Unfortunately, I ordered the lovely sounding dish of shrimp, scallops, sun-dried tomatoes in butter and white wine sauce over pasta.  I don&#39;t know how this could come out bland - but it did.  Somewhat soggy and slightly rubbery scallops with no flavor.  The big beautiful shrimp were cooked to death so that they curled in a ball and were extremely tough - inedible.
We mentioned to the server that we didn&#39;t care for the dishes, left most uneaten and declined taking it home, and he just suggested we order something else next time.
As it was a special occasion for us, we decided to order dessert - remember those lovely selections on the website?.  Well, they didn&#39;t have most of those - they had some different ones.  I ordered some pudding cake thing - the owner later said it was supposed to be a lava cake or something.  But it was unidentifiable as a cake at all - it was just a gooey liquid mess.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t cooked?  I don&#39;t know, but again, inedible, and I didn&#39;t.   Again, the server took it away without comment.
There was no discount or offer of any other dish at any time. 
We spoke to the owner, who was nice and said the dishes weren&#39;t supposed to be like that and said come back and ask for her. 
However, we paid over $100 for a meal for two that we didn&#39;t eat, which was basically inedible.   So come back?  Don&#39;t know about that.
It is charming - if you want to try it, my suggestion would be to try a simple pasta dish - maybe they can do that ok, and it&#39;d sure cost less than my $25 inedible seafood.",24/02/11,258,1,2,5,31,5.4888,4.718,1.5879999999999999,24.692999999999998,No,2361

Definitely don&#39;t expect fine dining. Don&#39;t expect presentation or balance. Expect hearty, unpretentious meals and friendly service. 

My first experience with Maccs was the mashed potato bowl. It definitely has the vibe like something you make at home out of convenience, but it&#39;s really good.  For under $10 I left full and happy. Not a mind blowing dining experience but a good meal.

Today I tried a burger and was very pleasantly surprised.  The burgers are a solid half pound, the buns are nicely toasted. I&#39;d call it the best burger in the area compared to other Americana fry counters like Dr Dogs or Sammy&#39;s (both of which I like). The surprise was how good the bacon was on the burger. Most burgers get some sad, wilted, tiny bacon sliced so thin it hardly exists.... this burger got a solid few pieces of good bacon, cooked crispy (but not grilled to dust). Lots of melty cheese and a huge pile of waffle fries firmly established Maccs as my new go-to for lunch in the area.

The order was ready 12 minutes after I ordered it, and the staff were very nice on the phone and in person. I had the volcano wrap, and it could have  been good if it had a sauce that added some acidity, brightness, and moisture to the fish - not sure if it had the Cajun ranch on it as described in menu. However, I was happy with the freshness of the ingredients and crunch of cabbage, fresh jalape̱os, and onions. My boyfriend had the Grecian chicken kabobs. The rice pilaf they came with had fresh lemon juice on it, which made it so good, but the chicken itself was pretty dry and could have used a yogurt/cucumber sauce or something else to add moisture. The included vegetables (onions, peppers, and tomatoes) were nice though, and overall it was a good portion with 2 kabobs worth of meat and vegetables.

john-and-tonys-west-chicago,Jennifer S.,mYvZwQ3T5JzqwOyURQWA_w,Bi-5f5w3MX3sgfKnEPtTug,"I kept telling my husband how much I wanted to try John &amp; Tony&#39;s.  This went on for way too long.  Finally, one Friday night when he decided we should try to find something different, we wandered in.  

We were under-dressed.  I should have known better, but the hostess and waitress were kind and welcoming just the same.  There was no wait at seven on a Friday which concerned me, but it turns out that I think John &amp; Tony&#39;s just aren&#39;t getting the publicity that they deserve.

The bread is not worth the space in your stomach.  I am confused why so many people, including our sweet waitress, thinks that it is so good.  It is overdone and they are stingy with the olive oil and cheese.  This was the only less than complimentary thing that I thought about our entire visit.

We both had soup.  The French Onion was marvelous!  Not too greasy with a nice, rich broth.  My other half tried the soup of the day...cream of broccoli maybe...and was pleased.

He had the fish and ships for dinner.  It is not all you can eat, but the portion was plentiful and he had plenty of leftovers for our 14 year old eating machine at home!

I had a trio.  I&#39;ll be honest here.  I struggled with what to order.  So many things sounded good and that&#39;s why I ended up with a platter of things to try instead of one entree with one side.  When it arrived, I thought I made a mistake in ordering it because it didn&#39;t look like a lot of food and I thought I was going to be hungry.  I was not.  I ate most of it and I was nice and satisfied.  From left to right:  A fried tilapia filet with asparagus, a filet mignon over smashed potatoes with a perfect beef gravy and a chicken breast over sweet potato mash with a slightly spicy sauce.  It was all delicious and served at the right temperatures.  Thank goodness!  That&#39;s a pet peeve of mine and everything was timed just right.  

Prompt service, quality ingredients and reasonably priced sandwich options are the main reasons that I plan on heading back very soon.

It was good!  We shared the stuffed jalepeno peppers, buffalo shrimp, and the filet mignon skewers.  I found them all to be quite tasty.

The shrimp were butterflied and served on top of a &#34;bed&#34; of blue cheese.  The jalepenos were interesting - halves that were roasted with a mixture of sausage and cheese inside.  Some were quite spicy and some weren&#39;t - guess it depends on the pepper.

The filet skewers were cooked to order (medium rare) and were good as well.  I thought the portions were pretty generous for the price, and the service was attentive and kind.  We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very friendly and conversational.

We had no waters brought to us until we had to ask for the waters and the &#34;free mimosas&#34; were very small and were never, ever, offered to be refilled, coffee or sodas or anything.

The food layout was chaotic, it was spread out everywhere with no honest direction, it was like bland bar food, with the price point of a Easter brunch. The ham was very salty and most of the food actually was just lukewarm or even cold. 

Two of the silverware sets were super dirty and we had to make due by grabbing our own. The whole place had a vibe of being not really clean during this event if I am to be even more honest. Nothing about the place spoke about have a special once a year event. N.O.T.H.I.N.G

We arrived shortly before 3:00 p.m. and were told we could choose from the lunch menu if we ordered before 3:00 p.m., or else from the dinner menu.  We wanted to unwind with a drink or two, so selected the dinner menu.  We sat in a booth in the bar area.  We had a wonderful server.  The place was empty, so she was the server, bartender and hostess.  Nevertheless, service was great.

When we looked at the menu, we were surprised at the prices.  $10.95 for a hamburger, $11.95 for a cheeseburger.  So we opted for the pasta dishes, where we get soup or salad with the meal.  I had J &amp; T&#39;s Rigatoni with a salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Both were very good.  My partner had the Linguine with Clams and the Broccoli Cheese Soup--again both were very good.

We both loved the Artisan style bread.  We had it with butter so can&#39;t comment on the olive oil and Parmesan cheese.

Portion sizes were very good.  My partner ate all his food, but I wasn&#39;t able to finish mine.

So why 3 stars rather than 4 or 5?  First, we thought it was overpriced.  Secondly, when I looked at their website, I noticed they have a &#34;Happy Hour&#34; menu, which we were never offered.  According to their website, a Pub burger and fries is $4.95 between the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.  My partner would have enjoyed the wings (6 for $2.95).  Maybe the Happy Hour menu is no longer available?  If so, they need to change their website accordingly.

Also, when I looked at the wine list menu, I ordered White Zinfandel, which said $15.00 for a carafe.  I received 1/2 carafe for $15.00.  Their on-line menu shows White Zinfandel at $15.00 per bottle, which is equal to approx. 3/4 carafe.

The bread was mediocre, the olive oil was very thin and tasteless (cheap)

We rented out the back room for a family event and for a steak house I have to say it felt very middle of the road.  I&#39;d compare it to Outback, nothing above that type of place, which was disappointing.

I ended up ordering a steak salad and I was very clear that I wanted it medium rare.  This being a steakhouse I figured they knew what I meant.....Woe is me, my steak arrives and it&#39;s grey.

I&#39;m of the opinion that anyone working in a kitchen and 90% of home cooks should be able to cook meat properly.  It&#39;s really not complicated, you can tell by touch and if you advertise as a steakhouse it should be a lay up.  To be honest I usually order Medium Rare because I think they&#39;ll screw up and I&#39;ll end up with Medium or...worst case Medium Well.  The rest of the salad was very underwhelming.  I am reminded of a bag salad from the grocery store with a few strips of flank steak sliced on top.

They also seem to be over the top with sauces for your steak.  Personally this seems more of the french style of mediocre meat and drown it in a peppercorn or hollandaise to mask the sub par meat, but that&#39;s just my .02, I prefer the taste of aged and well prepared beef over sauces.

After we were all done they presented us with a bill that was just a number.  It looked like a computer print out and had NOTHING on it but the $$.  I found the manager and said, &#34;What am I looking at here?&#34;

She replies, &#34;the bill.&#34;

&#34;How do I have any idea if this is our party or not?&#34;  I say.

&#34;Oh, you want an itemized one?&#34;  She inquires.

&#34;yes, thanks that&#39;d be great....&#34;  I reply.

So they add in gratuity, which I understand but don&#39;t give me an itemized copy or our bill?  This is the first time I&#39;ve ever had to ask for an itemized receipt and a restaurant.

I would not return.  It was overpriced and they overcooked all of the meat.",14/06/12,217,1,2,4,25,3.1521999999999997,2.461,1.305,22.233,No,2016

john-and-tonys-west-chicago,Jessica N.,9lOMNl4qnjX9PSAx8FBliA,OLxgsK7NlJkrAc4oUP9sGw,"Decent food. Steaks were cooked perfectly and for a more casual steakhouse experience, I would definitely return. A few details:

The bread for the table was less then mediocre and we only received about 5 tiny slices. I think they could beef that up a bit by picking a more quality bread like LaBriola or something.

We started with the baked goat cheese and it was absolutely delicious! My fiance loved it so much that he wouldn&#39;t let him take it because he wanted to dunk his steak in it - and he did. 

One perk of this place (when you have a hungry guy like I do) is that they give you a lot for the price. Our meals came with soup or salad.... My fiance&#39;s salad was nothing spectacular - just your below average iceberg lettuce with a few veggies and French dressing. I got the French Onion soup which may have been one of the worst I&#39;ve ever had, unfortunately. It was over salted and the broth didn&#39;t have that great, rich, beefy flavor. They didn&#39;t top it with gruyere but with swiss instead - maybe to cut costs? Anyway, it was also evident that after putting the cheese on top, they didn&#39;t bake the soup in the oven but instead fired it with a torch. 

For our entrees, I had the tournedos of filet mignon and it was yummy. A bit over salted also, but tolerable. They were cooked perfectly and the mushroom sauce was rich and had a nice flavor. For my side I got the au gratin potatoes - HUGE MISTAKE. Not good at all. I took a few bites and never returned. It was almost worse then a Betty Crocker box mix. 

My fiance ordered the NY Strip and loved it. His was also cooked perfectly and had nice grill marks on the top. His steak came with a small cup of melted garlic &amp; herb butter to pour on top which was really delicious. For a side he got the sweet potato mash and which was pretty good.",11/04/12,203,3,2,5,39,4.7689,3.917,1.7730000000000001,17.309,No,1833

I liked the decor, it was a nice atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and we got our water and bread pretty quickly.  They poured us some olive oil + pepper + parmesan cheese to dip it with.  
There was some music goin on by the bar, but we were seated in the main area.  It wasn&#39;t too bad, and it seemed like people were having fun.
I ordered the chef trio or something like that.  It was some filet mignon, some chicken, and some fish.  I can&#39;t remember the fish lol.  I think it was tilapia.  Either way, it was yums.
My wife got the special pasta which was a beef ravioli.  That thing was huge.  She probably only dented like 1/3 of it and we took the rest home.
We ended up taking a dessert sampler, of chocolate cake, carrot cake, and choco mousse but to go, cause we were stuffed.

The entertainment in the bar area is certainly a nice touch.  I was there on a Friday night when the owners (John and Tony) were playing with their band.  They started a bit late, and the mix was up much too loud on the notably talented vocalist, but the cover songs they did were mellow and inviting.

The food was very nicely displayed and was easy to access.  Overall, the food was good, but a few items were a greatly under seasoned - potatoes, tomato and mozarella salad.  The meat at the carving station was all perfectly prepared and the omelets were great.  We really liked the desserts and the fact they were cut into small portions.  Very wise move.

Now the negatives.  While we were seated fairly quickly, they really crammed too many tables and chairs into the room.  Our chairs were so close together that we could barely raise our arms to eat.  It took a while for our waitress to fill water glasses and she never even took our drink orders.  She also failed to mention that the one sole coffee carafe was at the far end of the table.  I think it was just really busy for her, but it provided a negative first impression. 

The thing that left us with a very bad taste in our mouth was at the end of our meal.  Our waitress came over and said that her manager told her that we needed to leave because the next party was here for their reservation and they had the same table.  We thought that was extremely rude, especially since the other 2 tables in the room were open.  We understand that it was crowded due to it being Mother&#39;s Day, but honestly couldn&#39;t the manager have said something directly to us instead of sending the poor waitress.

  Lay out was in three different rooms.  First room contained the salads and desserts on one table.  Three salads ( potato, fruit and a caesar salad)and some smoked salmon on toast. That was it.  
I love desserts and this was pretty disappointing.  Some very tiny  and I do mean little,  maybe 1 inch squares of different bar cookies..lemon bars, brownies and some chocolate pudding in maybe a 2 inch in diameter tart shell.   And then to top it off, there was a foil pan that had some store bought cinnamon rolls that looked like they were bought out  at the last moment to fill in the empty space???  Tacky ..  Do it right or don&#39;t bother. Sigh

Getting back to the second food area, in the main dining room, had scrambled egg, bacon, sausage, french toast some kind of pasta, cod fish, macaroni and cheese, chicken wings(nice wings but no sauce or anything  to put on them) chili and corn fritters.  That was pretty much it. Had to ask for butter for the french toast. Should have been provided by the french toast.  

The final room had a chef making omelets and another person carving roast beef (the best, but again, no au jus, gravy or horseradish to put on it) pork and a piece of turkey breast.    Nothing else.

The owner seemed a bit taken back when he asked me how things were and I said, food was great, but things were missing.  He replied that if I wanted anything that was not there, I should ask.  Hmmm a buffet usuallly has everything out that should be served together.   Should I have asked for lobster?  I don&#39;t quite think that would have flown.  But just normal accompaniments would have been out.

  He went on to say that we should have been there at 9:00am and should have seen all the things they had.  we were there at 11:15.  I thought to myself, the buffet didn&#39;t start until 10:00am^^^. 

We had a second helping of the roast beef,  and the owner then did bring some horseradish sauce, I&#39;m sure he whipped up himself and it was good. Thank you!
We also found it strange that there were no vegetables nor and kind potatoes.

I know that they have just started searching brunch in the last couple of months, but it needs to be tweaked a lot.  Perhaps Raise the price and do it right.

Not sure we will rush back, but having had a regular dinner there on Xmas eve we again found that the food itself was really good, too bad this brunch needs help.
Went for lunch recently,  waitress stated..be sure to check out our FANTASIC lunch buffet.  Lemon chicken and fettuccini, lettuce salad, two dressings, I think 2 soup choices, and some left over pastries from Sunday brunch..that were not appetizing looking.  Not a thing fantastic there.  Pretty pathetic.  Good thing we ordered from the menu.  Food was decent, BUT PLEASE, DON&#39;T OFFER BUFFETS AT ALL.  BRUNCH OR LUNCH.",01/03/13,347,3,2,3,12,2.9669,4.05,2.193,30.758,No,2969
john-and-tonys-west-chicago,Dan A.,a5QqJNIO93CnzEEDprL2OA,RJcEhZ7qu41dCmyE0BiKEg,"Went here on a groupon and was dissapointed the couldn&#39;t use it from my iPhone and said they needed a printed copy, but offered me 20% off my bill for a party of 4 that had a fairly expensive dinner with drinks, and I was very impressed with their manner.

All 4 meals very good, and the 2 steaks that were ordered were cooked wonderfully, there has been a rash of new steakhouses lately that just can&#39;t seem to get it right but they do.

Our service was great and every request for the evening was handled with a smile, our server was made us feel like we were at a much pricier downtown joint yet still had a sense of humor.

This place is relatively new, even though many steakhouses have been in this building, if they develop a following which I am sure they will, they could be in for the long haul here, something the suburbs really needs.

The inside is very nice and tasteful, with good bands setting the mood on the weekends.  The menu is a little small, I will admit, but I would rather have 10 good dishes than 20 subpar dishes.  Prices are maybe a little bit more than they deserve to be, but for what you get and the quality of food, you won&#39;t be able to complain.

I will be back, and will most likely make this a once a month retreat, I did like that it tries to be a more upscale locale without the snob attitudes yet still keep an air of class and elegance for the burbs.

I would reccomend that if you are looking for a good area steakhouse and don&#39;t want to pay a week&#39;s salary, spend an hour looking for parking and another hour waiting for a table, try John &amp; Tony&#39;s, you won&#39;t be dissapointed.",23/03/11,171,4,2,5,38,4.5777,1.4950000000000003,0.194,7.3100000000000005,No,1648

A friend and I were cruising around trying to find somewhere new to eat and this came on Google Maps. I went to their site on my phone and got their PDF Menu and read that they had a Crab Cake burger on Pretzel Roll - Sold! We happen to arrive at exactly the same time as the members of the band that were about to perform. Nice, live music and pretzel rolls.

I ended up getting the Domain Dupage (by Two Brothers) to drink, and boy was it delightful. I originally wanted Lagunita&#39;s IPA but they had replaced that with Ranger, it couldn&#39;t have turned out better. I did end up getting the crab cake burger and it was as delightful as I thought it would be. We sat in the seating around the bar and we were served by the bartender, Michelle (sorry if you spell it differently). I was a little apprehensive about this as it is quite easy for them to forget about you. I&#39;m happy to say that Michelle was more than attentive - she was like a ninja. I would be getting close to empty on my beer and she was there, and right as I am finishing it off there is a fresh one that appeared seemingly out of thin air.

The cover band that we arrived with was rather good as well. They played a lot of good/well known hits. They won me over when they started with a jam by The Police.

Their iced tea is unlike any other tea I&#39;ve ever had, it tasted burnt, with artificial sweetner poured in, gross!

He did offer a new sandwich, but from the onion-packed, ice-cold bite, I just wanted to get out of there.

john-and-tonys-west-chicago,Jeanette K.,j15b0iIothmQpH7RWSBzFg,wqbwKJl--Lf4BbEFzJrObA,"I had high hopes for John and Tonys. I previewed the menu on the website beforehand, and it had a lot of good-looking items. The chef is also originally from Emilio&#39;s Tapas. John and Tonys is located in a spot that never seems to hold a restaurant for long, so I thought maybe this would be different. Last night, we tried it out.

The restaurant is recently remodeled and hosts live jazz bands in the bar area. It wasn&#39;t very crowded, despite us arriving around 7:30 on a Saturday night. The crowd was also a decidedly older crowd.

I ordered the roasted chicken that came with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans, and red cabbage with bacon and pearl onions. The BF ordered a cheeseburger and the french onion soup. The meal started off to a good start with hot crusty bread and a roasted garlic/shallot spread. The garlic spread was awesome. The salad that came with my meal was small and unremarkable. The BF&#39;s soup was tasty, but there wasn&#39;t enough cheese and there was a colony of bay leaves at the bottom of the bowl. We also ordered the saganaki which had a nice crust on it.

When our meals came out, I was a little disappointed in the chicken. The skin was soft and soggy, and the chicken seemed reheated. The mashed potatoes and green beans were average. The best part of my meal was the red cabbage, which I probably could have eaten a whole plate full of. The BF&#39;s cheeseburger and fries were average as well. The best part of his meal was the grilled pretzel roll.

Prices were reasonable, and there is a pretty good wine list. However, there are many other similar places in the western suburbs where you can get a better roast chicken or cheeseburger. Maybe we ordered the wrong items, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back to try something else unless I know it will be better.",11/07/10,212,2,2,5,15,4.6213,2.6220000000000003,0.298,21.080000000000002,No,1816

Normally their brunch is $15/adult, but I guess because it was a Bears game day, they lowered the price and had different food offerings.
Food was ok...there was a crepe and omelette station, french toast, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, chicken wings, chili, salad, a few dried out desserts, chips and salsa, way too creamy pasta and some others not worth mentioning.
The coffee was not included in the price, which I think should be told to the patron on a brunch day.  Every other brunch around includes soft drinks, tea and coffee.
Kids price was $6.95 and didn&#39;t include juice either and the waitress didn&#39;t mention that either.  Juice cost $2.69 each.
My kids are all under 6; they barely eat anything.  I think it&#39;s unfair to charge $7 for brunch and almost $3 more for one cup of apple juice.
Our waitress was non-existent.  I hate tipping 20% for a brunch that I basically serve myself at and had to track the waitress down to get a refill on coffee!
The only positives are...it is a beautiful restaurant...very clean; 
the omelette station was good and an older gentleman (owner?) came by our table and offered my kids complimentary ice cream.

We also got the artisan bread which was very good, but it took a long time to get butter. The worst part of the evening was when they brought my lasagna with meat sauce when I specifically asked for marinara sauce with no meat. After taking my meal the server came back and informed me that the whole lasagna had meat in it and they could not remake it so she could bring me spaghetti and marinara sauce instead. I got that in about 5 minutes and it looked very rushed and the sauce was just sloppily poured into a pile on top. The sauce was basically watery tomato juice and I didn&#39;t even eat it.

I saw this new place had opened up, and decided to give it a try.

Wow, this place is awesome!  I went in on a Friday night and they were pretty busy.  They had some live music going, to give it a real nice enviroment.

We had the Prime Rib and it was too die for!  All of the rolls, sides, and salads with the meal were top notch.

The only question I have for is this place, is why are they not downtown charging $50/plate?!

Not a good first impression. Finally, a bus boy came to greet me and help.  The owner John walked up, offered me coffee while I waited in the foyer for friends, and tried to look for the reservation we had.  He did admit he sometimes writes down the dates wrong, so make sure they&#39;ve got it right when you call.  While waiting, I noticed a lot of artwork was moving out.  When I mentioned it, John took me on a tour of the restaurant paintings that were done by his daughter, whom I met, and told me about the multi use room where they were just clearing.  I liked to hear the enthusiasm in his voice and appreciated his hospitality.

The interior is darker wood and offers a fireplace on the west end of the main dining.  Hopefully, the lighting will be adequate for the evening.  The east area has two bars, seating with a musician area.  John mentioned the previous night&#39;s artist was a member of the Drifters and another recent artist was a jazz singer.  The southwest corner is an enclosed multi use room which was being converted to a swing dance floor for the evening.  John and Tony&#39;s offers dinner and movie nights and this room also serves as the theatre.

The brunch menu was one page and offered a variety of items for $7.95 along with a separate lunch menu.  I opted for the omelet with Spinach, mushroom and goat cheese. A build your own with four ingredients for the same price as three is listed.  We were served a starter of small cinnamon rolls providing a nice touch. There was too much goat cheese and not enough egg and trying to eat the omelet was like eating paste. The meal comes with a very small portion of diced fried potatoes (which were slightly overdone) and one slice of toast; the size is enough to satisfy an appetite.  Coffee and tea are $2.25 with refills which I thought was pricey.

One of my friends had the dates wrapped in bacon (sides on the lunch menu) and French toast. These days anything wrapped in bacon in a sure thing, and she said this idea was on the top of the list.  

The bus boy did a phenomenal job keeping our beverages filled, asking if the meal was satisfactory and clearing.  I wish every restaurant would have someone taking pride in the service as this gentlemen did.  

If you want something a little more elegant, this is place to go.  If you want local and casual without the feeling of one of those generic family restaurants, go to the Olde North Pancake House just to the West, they&#39;ve been a staple for a long time.

We were sadly mistaken, who knew simple pasta dishes at an Italian restaurant could seem so difficult to make? I ordered the gluten free pasta aglio from the signature pasta part of the menu. When I got my meal the pasta was the most overcooked pasta I&#39;ve ever been served, the broccoli was just plain disgusting and was equally as overcooked and the sun dried tomatoes had the texture of raisins. But that&#39;s not the worst part. The menu claims my dish has a light herb garlic oil and my dish tasted like nothing. I even tried putting pepper, cheese and more oil on and the &#34;pasta&#34; dish just soaked it right up. I rarely complain when going out to eat and wasn&#39;t surprised when my sisters Chicken Marsala was drenched in sauce, and her side of fettuccine Alfredo looked like it had been sitting under a heater for days. Not to mention that it tasted like nothing as well. My dad had the Reuben and you could tell it was disgusting based on how little of it he ate. Our waitress could care less and it seemed as if she had heard the same story many times before. It&#39;s amazing that this place got 3.5 stars because the cooks could care less if their customers get food poisoning or not. I&#39;ve never experienced such horrible food in my life.

I&#39;d rather eat grass than eat at FoodBarz again (the only other option for lunch in my building), so I was excited to see that Grill Chasers was coming to the office on this lovely Hump Day. 

Here&#39;s what I had: 

Chicago Bird Skewers: I had mine doused in Buffalo Burn sauce. The meat was tender, juicy, and seasoned well. The sauce was not exactly your typical buffalo sauce, but really good nonetheless, and not too hot. 

Jalapeno Ranch: This came as a &#34;Chaser&#34; for my skewers, and it was so good that I felt it deserved to be mentioned separately. Buttery, slightly spicy, and a great complement to the buffalo sauce. 

Roti Prata Pancake - I had no idea what to expect here, and what I got was the lightest and fluffiest flatbread you could ever imagine. I had no intention of eating this because I knew it was filled with butter, but then decided it was worth the obscene amount of calories it probably contained.

However, the food was very mediocre. I ordered the chipotle fries and the chipotle sauce was basically spicy mayo. The sauce made the fries much worse. $4 for the chipotle fries.
I ordered the grilled veggie and goat cheese wrap, the wrap was a bit burnt, which made everything bitter tasting. The grilled veggie was nice but overall the whole wrap needed some sauce or some melted cheese to it to blend it all together. $8 for that sandwich.
Overall for a $12 meal, I am expecting much more. I could get a very decent meal at a sit down restaurant for $12.

I ordered the Ole&#39; Bird skewer which is chicken infused with orange and lime juice, garlic, chipotle peppers,  and ancho chili powder. I also tried to get the jalapeno mac and cheese but I was told they didn&#39;t have it. So that was disappointing. 

The mango salsa that accompanied the skewer was good. I also loved the Roti Prata pancake. But the skewer wasn&#39;t great. The first piece was good: full of flavor and slightly spicy (for my tastebuds, anyway. Others might consider it very spicy). But the second piece was chewy... not good chicken at all.

This one was probably my favorite of the night! So glad that they only offered their skewer tasters! For $5, I got two skewers of chicken prepared in my choice of sauce (I did the Sweet Q Glaze), a piece of their Roti Prata bread (A-MAZE-BALLS!), and a chaser, or dipping sauce. I chose the asian spiced mayo which was delish! You could tell they smoked the chicken before grilling (you actually saw the smoke ring on some parts!), and it was grilled off pretty well.

Knowing it was Members only club I never knew at times it is open to non-members. The general area is very quient and I know of one recent 1920 gangster movie used the area for its vintage look.
Being in the area Friday Night I googled it and discovered it at times it is open to non-members we went for brunch on sunday morning. Being the first to arrive (anxious) we were both awed by the charm of the building. Lots of stain glass and wood. I have been a road warrior for seven years and eat out a lot. The table presentation was very nice.
The food was very well presented with bigger than expected portions. Food Quality was very good with the price reasonable.

Either that, or less care is taken with the food prep for non-members.

Upon arrival, service was attentive and pleasant.  However, even though we (party of 7) were there at 12:30 for Sunday brunch, and the place was mostly empty (e.g. there was just one other party of 4 or 5 in the Saddle Room with us), the food took a VERY long time to arrive.  This was ordering off the limited brunch menu, too, and a limited menu should mean faster food prep.

Once the food did come, nearly all of our party had something missing from their orders.  2 of us ordered the prime rib skillet, and neither got the horseradish sauce side; we both had to ask for it.  One of our party didn&#39;t get their asparagus side; they had to ask for it.  2 of us didn&#39;t get their potato side; they had to ask for it.  You get the idea.  Small things but LOTS of them give an overall bad impression.

Food was absolutely nothing special.  I ordered the prime rib skillet, potatoes crispy.  The side potatoes were crispy, the potatoes in the skillet were not.  Everyone else&#39;s side potatoes were equally crispy to mine, more crispy than they liked (and included burnt pieces).  I ordered my eggs over easy, they were medium.  Someone in our party ordered the filet mignon burger medium well, but it was done well instead and dry.  Another person&#39;s burger was done properly, but just nothing special taste-wise.

Frankly, it all seemed like the same quality you&#39;d get from a budget chain place like Denny&#39;s.  Crab Benedict was...  OK.  Chicken and waffles were...  OK.  Prime rib skillet was...  OK.  We did have a special request for carrot cake for dessert which they accommodated and it was done very well.  Ultimately, though, we saw no reason to ever go back there again.  

Last thing, and I&#39;ve never seen this at any restaurant I&#39;ve been to in my life.  Some of the desserts on the menu had an additional $1 charge if you wanted it &#34;to go.&#34;  Huh??  No idea what that&#39;s about; maybe that&#39;s a fancy dinner club thing?  What if I just ordered it normally, then didn&#39;t eat any of it and asked for a to-go box:  would I still have been assessed the $1 charge?

the-anvil-club-east-dundee-3,Ashley C.,98DslWquC6ypAJZyZcKcZg,Ph5xYwWFiNkppRg2l9zK_A,"2.5 stars overall with 4 stars for service. I&#39;ve come here several times with my family who live in the area for special occasions. It has a great ambiance and I love the unique dinner experience at a dining club.  It is somewhat dimly lit but that adds to the charm. It is also nice a quiet so you can actually enjoy a conversation with the whole table. The renovations are really nice and they have preserved the history while making it a bit more modern.  We&#39;ve had really good service - whether in the bar or in the dining room.

The menu was nice, but the food was just okay with some execution issues.  To start, I had the lobster bisque.  It was pretty good but could use some herbs or something to cut the richness. My husband had the caesar salad which was beautifully plated but overdressed. The bites that weren&#39;t overdressed were very good, the ingredients were fresh and the Parmesan chip was delicious. For the main, I ordered the special steak - filet medallions cooked tableside with mushrooms, garlic and shallot with a side of mashed potatoes. It was delicious and cooked very well. I was happy with my choice. However, the problem is the rest of the table&#39;s steaks were overcooked. Everyone ordered medium rare and no one got medium rare. I tried my husband&#39;s steak which was medium well bordering on well done (his looked to be the most over). I was not surprised that it was very tough and dry.  I would have let them try to fix it but since the head of the table/member didn&#39;t, no one wanted to be &#34;that guy.&#34;

Living in Chicago, I have high expectations for a steakhouse. There are some things I can overlook because I recognize we aren&#39;t in Chicago but in the suburbs where options are more limited. However, you just can&#39;t overcook the majority of the table&#39;s steaks and get 3 stars in my book. That being said, there is potential once things get smoothed out.",29/09/15,201,2,2,5,47,6.736600000000001,4.117,0.9369999999999999,18.946,No,1929

First of all it is a members only club with some evenings and brunch open to the public. We were invited by a member so apparently had access to a private room. We arrived at 630 the given time and this was on  Wednesday night so of course there was not a huge rush. Plenty of parking and a sign that clearly says &#34;members only&#34;. I will have to say it did have the feel of an exclusive club and I being a brown person (with an attitude) didn&#39;t feel out of place as much as I thought I would--just had to throw that out there--at times it can be a concern. Staff was nice and server--although a bit distracted at times was fine. An array of cheese and crackers was brought to the lovely table where our group was seated and wine was served as well. Good unique selection of cheese- there was a blueberry blue I think and one had what I thought had a praline type of aftertaste. I do not drink alcohol so sorry no wine review from me. Members have their own key to their own wine closet on the premises. Interesting. I&#39;d need a ginger ale locker please. Anyway the lobster bisque followed--buttery and velvety-not too salty. I ordered the special which was swordfish steak and opted for the mash potatoes and primavera veggies. Fortunately I love my onions blackened but I&#39;m sure they weren&#39;t supposed to be that way since no one else had them burnt black. Can&#39;t remove a star because I enjoyed it but seriously--be consistent.  Swordfish was huge I think like 8 oz very nicely prepared--not fishy or over cooked at all--potatoes were equally delightful. After dinner a big table rolled out and bananas foster were prepared in front of us ...flames and all. AWESOME---here&#39;s a term I have not used in a while....foodgasmic! Served over vanilla ice cream as they should be. The best part was the smell of the brown sugar , butter and rum after they caramelized it. One thing the Anvil might want to look at is that the servers empty finished plated onto a tray so nearby you can see piled up dirty plates and a mound of uneaten food. It would be good to do this elsewhere or not in sight given the sexy swanky look of this place. It is a ambiance killer. On the nights and brunch where public is welcome I would encourage people to give it a try---great for a romantic dinner, special occasion and even maybe small groups.

I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s why the low review count and way too high of the rating. 

Let&#39;s say, the membership is not very expensive (and get you into rest of the associated supper clubs!) and newly renovated building is really nice. There are no small children running around... 

Than&#39;s about all nice things I have to say.

The few times I have been, general host/staff sounded snobby. Wait staffs were nice, but slow. Food took too long to come out. Chicken was definitely overcooked and medium steak ordered was delivered more well than medium. Most other food items are mediocre at best for the long wait - even with fairly decent presentation. 

Considering the membership commitment to gain access, avoid it. There are vastly superior dining experiences to be had elsewhere. If you are really curious, ask for a guest pass or wait for non-member entry times.",17/06/15,139,1,2,5,22,4.416,2.8780000000000006,0.742,11.381,No,1188
the-anvil-club-east-dundee-3,Richard H.,qA04yh4pFUbUp0H_pvNCSA,uFumCitVo4Q8GB-oOFzwDw,"I just read Juice R&#39;s rating of the Anvil Club and felt compelled to offer my opinion of the Anvil Club. I have lived in New York City and Chicago for a good deal of my life and have had the pleasure of sampling many fine restaurants. I moved to the Northwest suburbs with a little intrepidation because I was used to great metropolitan restaurants and other than many of chain restaurants, fine dining here can be difficult. My wife and I became members quite by accident and since that time have been constantly happy and amazed at the quality of the food and service at the Anvil Club.  Being one of the &#34;average members&#34; and above the Yelp user base I hope that my age does not preclude my appreciation for fine food or my ability to park my Harley outside the Anvil Club.  The staff and General manager have been cordial and accommodating, The Chefs have credentials that equal or exceed many of the culinary staff in Metropolitan Chicago.  Matt, the head mixologist can direct you to some of the finest scotch I have ever tasted.  In short, this is one of the finest restaurants I have had the pleasure of dining at.  I personally feel that it is great that the membership is inexpensive as it opens a fine dining experience to a variety of clientele to experience the club.  I will conclude by giving the Anvil club high marks on food, service and ambience and as I put away my AARP card am thankful that I didn&#39;t have to pay for dinner with my father&#39;s credit card.",11/09/15,149,5,2,5,49,4.5683,1.525,0.23199999999999998,8.244,No,1493

the-anvil-club-east-dundee-3,MtnMan E.,RSwXSRGOb9FVxmio6_6F2w,Pr9oiTdLoc-jjx_i2eh1hQ,"My wife and I have been members at the Anvil Club for several years now. We were initially introduced by a client and soon found out we knew other members. After coming several times over a year we joined even though we live about 25 minutes away. Our biggest concern was how ofter we would use it. That hasn&#39;t been a problem as we look forward to coming out and don&#39;t just reserve it for special occasions. But enough with how we got introduced... 
The service is always fantastic. The wait and bar staff are as good if not better than any of the area Country Clubs I have had the pleasure of visiting. While the food and menu have improved under Michael F.  we have always found it to be very good. Have I been served an overcooked steak, sure but there was no question and it was quickly replaced. The seasonal menu&#39;s that that have been introduced have added to the appeal of dining here. Yes I like the old favorites like the Cowboy Ribeye but the Venison Loin with Roast parsnips is sensational as are most of the other seasonal items.  
If you like nice wine and a good cocktail the Anvil Club has one of the best bar selection I have found. It is not hard to find a new single malt to try and if you haven&#39;t had a Manhattan ask Carlos to make you one of his Perfect ones with Vya. 
As for the decor, I loved the original dark paneling and stock certificates on the walls in the men&#39;s room but I&#39;m slowly getting used to the remodeling that was done last year and especially the update to the patio. 
This Club is not for everyone but it is for us and we will continue to bring our special friends and families who are always impressed.  
PS - they honor reservations and when was the last time you sat at a piano bar after dinner and sang some of your favorite songs with friends?

My wife had the chicken entree and, even though it was being served in a banquet style (10 tables in our room) it was perfectly cooked and juicy.

the-anvil-club-east-dundee-3,James B.,6SMgVrFCqRzulY34veTuaw,Kvb7PrQDHwzw0y77S1tWow,"I am among the most senior members of the Anvil Club. My late father in law was a founding member. I was introduced to the Anvil Club in 1971 by another family and after that initial visit, never forgot the Club for how I was treated and served. I can remember I was bedazzled on the Club&#39;s artifacts and decoration. Tiffany glass, from George Pullman&#39;s mansion, Bar Face off of the Delta Queen River Boat. Plate Glass Mirror&#39;s made in the 19teenth century, Gargoyle&#39;s, &amp; Cherub&#39;s, Stock Certificates of companies before the Great Depression, everywhere you looked. Waiters, Bartender&#39;s, Maitr&#39;d&#39;s in Tuxedo&#39;s, beautiful oil paintings, wine cellar and in the summer, 5 distinctly separate rooms with their own theme, with the fifth, being under the stars,&#34;the veranda&#34;.

Back in the late sixties and early seventies, there were other private steak houses
not far away. They are all gone and only the Anvil Club has survived. If anything that had been achieved because of the Club&#39;s ability to identify with family. Never as an individual did I come to this Club, but only as a family, as this organization rest with our families memories. Every album we have at home, has pictures of our entire family at some celebration enjoyed there. There would be Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister, Aunt, Uncle, Cousin &amp; friends. For almost all of these occasions, there were Anvil staff there ready to take the pictures~!

Talk about service~? My wife was a diabetic and was suffering from not enough insulin while at the Club, the assistant Maitre&#39;d at the time &#34;Brian,&#34; on a snowing night ran to the pharmacy in town and got a vile of insulin for my wife. We as a family never forgot this incredible act of friendship he displayed~! Never have I or my wife been disappointed with any aspect of the Club.  I am retired now and have moved to Texas, but I still have my Anvil Membership and will always have it to use when I am, back in town. And when I am, I take my best friends&#39; there to enjoy and say hello to all the servers and bartenders, I have come to know over the years. Yes we are on a &#34;first name&#34; basis~! God Bless this organization, The Anvil Club.

Service was amazing, steak was perfect, and loved the buttery sauce it was served with. This place has so much history - and the renovations are coming along nicely.

Now more than your father&#39;s &#34;steakhouse,&#34; the Club also gets into the avante-garde with new proteins, foams and presentations. One can also have foie gras or sweetbreads if one desires. 

Last Friday evening we arrived and the bartender had begun making our cocktails as soon as we walked in the room. Popcorn is almost always perfect but on occasion arrives stale. Moving to the dining room we put ourselves in Chef&#39;s hands, we had no idea what he planned to prepare for us. Out came a trio of amuse bouche- pulled pork with pickle, smoked salmon with citrus creme and a barbecued chicken crostini- all excellent. Our appetizer was a seared scallop atop corn risotto with chive blossoms and corn shoots...heavenly; and a lovely presentation. Entrees were prime porterhouse steaks with foie topper, goat cheese potato croquettes and a vegetable medley. The steak was perfectly cooked and the croquettes were spectacular...I suggested he add a small plate option of these with crumbled goat cheese and Bordelais sauce as a spin on poutine- they were that good. The vegetables were cooked, but had texture- not at all mushy. We ended with a rich chocolate mousse. A terrific meal, start to finish.

Service is, as usual, excellent- friendly and attentive yet not overbearing. We were provided clean stems with each new wine. We will be going back this weekend for Chef&#39;s sweetbreads. 

The menu is a bit pricey, yes, but there are nightly specials so one does not need to break the bank to dine here. They have also relaxed the dress code and the age policies to accommodate present times. The new spring/summer menu will be unveiled tomorrow, and I for one cannot wait to see it. In the end, for what you spend here, you get good value. They have also repainted some rooms, put in new carpets and made other improvements, so it is not as dark, dingy or musty as it once was.",18/06/13,240,4,1,5,-19,6.623600000000001,3.167,0.095,17.738,No,2071

It&#39;s pricey but look around on the outside and especially on the inside and you know you&#39;ll be paying. But far less then any steak place in Schaumburg or Chicago - and in our opinion none of those clowns have a shot at the Anvil Club.

A side note... Our friends went with us here and apparently did not want to impose on us so they called up too see if they could dine there just this past Chistmas Eve.

Always loved the food and service (always take out or delivery).  The food was always amazing and had a better taste than those fast food asian cuisines such as panda express. So now its 2015 and I&#39;ve moved back to STC and have ordered delivery from there 3 times now on their website (which is super cool by the way) and have been 100% satisfied on both service and food quality each time. Even their delivery drivers are respectful and keep customer service in mind. I could not recommend a better place than here.  I wish I could give 6 stars but im sure you get my point. The only down fall (and its my fault) is its is after 10 and Im craving some amazing food!

After yet another dissapointting order tonight I have to lower my rating. The food I ordered had no flavor but usually is the only thing on the menu that does lately. Everything is just drowned in a brown garlic sauce of some kind, maybe some pepper thrown at it. I&#39;m over it. Stay away, this isn&#39;t the Silver Lake you grew up with.

Original:
Just OK. Their food if pretty good in the appetizer department, usually consistent in quality and delivery. My issue with the restaurant is that the quality of food you get seems to depend on who&#39;s cooking that night. Sometimes I get nice, crispy chicken in my food, sometimes it&#39;s mushy, almost a reheated quality about it. Don&#39;t hate it, but I don&#39;t flock here for good food anymore.

My biggest pet peeve is a restaurant that half-asses their food. They clearly don&#39;t care about the food they&#39;re making, because it has no flavor. To have thrown french fries in a dish just shows laziness. They don&#39;t want to take the time to create a pleasant dish for the customer to enjoy.

The sweet &amp; Sour chicken, there&#39;s no way you can mess that up unless you burn it or under cook it. The sauce it comes with has pieces of pineapple and bell pepper((again)).

I think I burned out on them a few years ago when we went to them often. But when my niece and nephew recently expressed their desire to have Chinese food when I was visiting my hometown for family business, we chose Silver Lake Chinese Restaurant on the recommendation of my mother&#39;s friend. 

I didn&#39;t have high expectations for Silver Lake Chinese Restaurant. It was located on a busy highway, in a strip mall, in a far-west suburb of Chicago. I anticipated large quantities of mediocre, salty, MSG laden food.

I was wrong...

I always order hot and sour soup in a Chinese restaurant. If it is good, I know my meal will be good, as well. If it is bad -- then I know I&#39;m in for a mediocre meal. The best (and first) hot and sour soup I ever had was at Jimmy Tsang&#39;s in Pittsburgh in the early 1980&#39;s. I&#39;ve been looking for hot and sour soup near that quality ever since.

So, after ordering plum wine (I actually requested red wine but the waiter misunderstood me and brought me plum wine (which was actually delicious -- kind of like apple cider and Amaretto) I ordered hot and sour soup, spring rolls and steamed dumplings (pot stickers), knowing a full meal was too much for me. (and knowing I could taste the food ordered by others)

The rest of the table ordered General Tao Chicken, orange flavored beef, orange flavored chicken, and empress chicken. At the last minute we also ordered a fried rice side. Each order was spiced according to the wishes of the orderer from mild to very hot. The waiter asked many questions in order to get the heat level right for the person ordering.

My hot and sour soup was amazing. Almost as good as Jimmy Tsang&#39;s. It was a trifle too salty, but perfect in every other way. 

The rest of the meal was also delicious. All of the dishes were very good. We realized we&#39;d ordered far too much food when the waiter put the first plate on our table. We all gorged ourselves and had leftovers for two days. 

The service was attentive (there were not very many other customers in the restaurant that night) and fun. He joked with the kids and winked at me (thinking they were my children, I think). 

The only complaint I have is that I ordered tea and was given a tea bag of black tea. I saw containers of green tea behind the counter, and was expecting that. 

I highly recommend this restaurant and will probably go back when I&#39;m in Elgin again. It rekindled my fondness for Chinese food -- I&#39;ll have to find a good one in Bethesda.",12/11/10,303,4,2,5,31,6.5337000000000005,3.622,0.8029999999999999,24.575000000000003,No,2568

I had the Mongolian beef and it was flavorless with gristly crunchy beef with an awful sauce and Mexican rice too.  I think the thing that makes me upset about all these asian restaurants around here is the use of &#34;Mexican&#34; rice vs &#34;Asian&#34; rice.  Idk I guess I gave it two stars due to cost(you get what you pay for) and speed. To follow up. I eat at a ton of different &#34;Asian&#34; restaurants and I have noticed that at all the good restaurants, the workers come out and sit at the tables to eat the food they cook. Here the workers went out and came back with Portillos to eat. Says a lot for their confidence in the food.   Go down the road to Thai Town for better food and better atmosphere.

1) I HATE the idea that you serve a smaller portions to people who eat in your restaurant, as opposed to those who order take out. and.... I don&#39;t mean make your take out portions smaller.
2) The new chicken pad Thai is awful! I love pad Thai, and this taste nothing like any pad Thai I have had before. Want to check a good pad Thai Brian? go to White Pearl and try theirs. Authentic and awesome.
3) I have only ordered take out because I felt that the 1 long term waiter is unfriendly and arrogant. Not going to go into a lot of detail because it has been years since I ate in, but this waiter who is still their propelled me away from your restaurant.

The service for dine-in is pretty good.  The food seems like it takes a long time to arrive and you can only read your Chinese horoscope so many times before you want to pull out your own teeth in boredom, but it is good and plenty to eat.

I won&#39;t be ordering here again. I decided to give it a second chance, and I once again was not impressed. We had ordered delivery, and gotten egg rolls, orange chicken, sweet &amp; sour chicken, Beef with broccoli, and a house fried rice. We like to order a variety of things before we judge a place. 

First off, the egg rolls, the first time I tried these they were good. This time, they were incredibly salty. Secondly, the orange chicken, extremely disappointing.. Did not have a Orange flavor at all, its served with bell pepper, broccoli, and green onion in a dark sauce and tasted either burnt or like sesame oil.

The sweet &amp; Sour chicken, there&#39;s no way you can mess that up unless you burn it or under cook it. The sauce it comes with has pieces of pineapple and bell pepper((again)). 

I tried the beef and broccoli, my bf stated that it tasted fishy, but i&#39;m not entirely certain i felt the same way, though it was not tasty enough to want to eat it. 

The house fried rice was not a big let down, it was decent.",29/07/13,150,1,1,2,-8,1.6667000000000003,1.3610000000000002,0.44,10.197,No,1151
silver-lake-chinese-restaurant-elgin,Dona P.,8uNFWX3FKrDD1f8QAXJLJg,F-9iaMBOdt9u6HcjywJJeA,"I am not a huge fan of Chinese restaurants these days. I think I burned out on them a few years ago when we went to them often. But when my niece and nephew recently expressed their desire to have Chinese food when I was visiting my hometown for family business, we chose Silver Lake Chinese Restaurant on the recommendation of my mother&#39;s friend. 

I didn&#39;t have high expectations for Silver Lake Chinese Restaurant. It was located on a busy highway, in a strip mall, in a far-west suburb of Chicago. I anticipated large quantities of mediocre, salty, MSG laden food.

I was wrong...

I always order hot and sour soup in a Chinese restaurant. If it is good, I know my meal will be good, as well. If it is bad -- then I know I&#39;m in for a mediocre meal. The best (and first) hot and sour soup I ever had was at Jimmy Tsang&#39;s in Pittsburgh in the early 1980&#39;s. I&#39;ve been looking for hot and sour soup near that quality ever since.

So, after ordering plum wine (I actually requested red wine but the waiter misunderstood me and brought me plum wine (which was actually delicious -- kind of like apple cider and Amaretto) I ordered hot and sour soup, spring rolls and steamed dumplings (pot stickers), knowing a full meal was too much for me. (and knowing I could taste the food ordered by others)

The rest of the table ordered General Tao Chicken, orange flavored beef, orange flavored chicken, and empress chicken. At the last minute we also ordered a fried rice side. Each order was spiced according to the wishes of the orderer from mild to very hot. The waiter asked many questions in order to get the heat level right for the person ordering.

My hot and sour soup was amazing. Almost as good as Jimmy Tsang&#39;s. It was a trifle too salty, but perfect in every other way. 

The rest of the meal was also delicious. All of the dishes were very good. We realized we&#39;d ordered far too much food when the waiter put the first plate on our table. We all gorged ourselves and had leftovers for two days. 

The service was attentive (there were not very many other customers in the restaurant that night) and fun. He joked with the kids and winked at me (thinking they were my children, I think). 

The only complaint I have is that I ordered tea and was given a tea bag of black tea. I saw containers of green tea behind the counter, and was expecting that. 

I highly recommend this restaurant and will probably go back when I&#39;m in Elgin again. It rekindled my fondness for Chinese food -- I&#39;ll have to find a good one in Bethesda.",12/11/10,303,4,2,5,31,6.5337000000000005,3.622,0.8029999999999999,24.575000000000003,No,2568

It was basically like eating dessert for breakfast, but that&#39;s fine by me! I mean, there was a sliced banana on top, so that&#39;s one point in the healthy column...right?

At 11 am on a Thursday morning Jelly Cafe was pretty empty. Our waitress was prompt and friendly and our food came out really fast. My decaf coffee was always full and and hot and waters were full.

Their menu has so many things that sounded delicious, but the banana bread french toast definitely caught my eye, and here&#39;s why...

4 slices of banana bread. I repeat... Four. Slices. Topped with chocolate chips, sliced bananas, some sort of cream frosting, and powdered sugar. So freakin&#39; good! Mind you, it&#39;s extremely filling and super sweet so despite how much I enjoyed it I was only able to eat about half of it. It reheated nicely as leftovers though! With all this sweetness I was glad I got a side of bacon to even things out. The bacon was thick-cut and very good - the perfect addition to French toast.

Great spot for breakfast or brunch! Keep in mind they close at 3 pm :)",15/07/16,140,5,3,5,81,6.9758000000000004,3.958,0.219,12.823999999999998,No,1124

After bookmarking, browsing and drooling over the photos of Jelly Cafe dishes on Yelp, I decided to give this place a try with Jacqueline B. for breakfast. 

Upon entering, I was greeted sweetly by multiple waitresses and was seated right away at a booth near the door. I have never been called &#34;babe&#34; so many times by women! The employees seemed appreciative and sweet to their customers. My coffee and water was served right away and I was excited to check the place out.

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just a newer concept or if it&#39;s a bit of an eyesore to me but I couldn&#39;t help but notice the open ceiling. I&#39;ve noticed places acquiring the open ceiling look more and more but I&#39;m not sure how I feel about it. The place is bubbly, colorful and happy so for some reason the industrial, hardware look on the ceiling didn&#39;t mesh well with the rest of the decor. This wasn&#39;t anything to be taken seriously or a reason to be given less stars, it was merely a first thought.

After browsing the yummy options in the menu, I decided on the Almond Berry French Toast...mostly because I had seen a few photos from fellow Yelpers who had gotten this picturesque dish and I had to get it for myself (and take my own pictures of course). One thing I must say is, HOW PERFECT. This was the prettiest french toast I had ever eaten! The toast itself was covered in tiny almond slivers which gave it a satisfying nutty flavor and crunch, they were so perfectly yellow and yet still soft and pillowy! And yes, I am still talking about the toast! Aside from the nuts, there was powdered sugar and vibrant strawberries and blueberries on the toast and plate as well - excellent photo op. The waitress came by often enough to get us re-fills on coffee, make sure we&#39;re doing alright, etc. 

Overall, I&#39;d love to come back here because of it&#39;s convenient location to me and these dishes that come out of the kitchen are beautiful AND delicious!

I would give it zero stars if that was a choice. The food was mediocre.

I heard from the owner today regarding my visit. The owner&#39;s rendition of the incident was not quite accurate and was harsh in his/her response. They accused me of being &#34;proud&#34; of not leaving a tip and that was not true. I simply stated that I did not leave a tip. They wanted to make me feel bad that I slighted the 18 year old waiter. This all comes down to good customer service which there was none, That&#39;s fine.

Great taste! My wife had their ham steak, eggs and home red potatoes with a side of pancakes. Delicious of couse. 

The service was good. A latin lady served us. She was attentive but was out there. And I mean out there as in she might have a little crazy in her. Lol I really don&#39;t mean that in any disrespect, however whenever she&#39;d come to our table to ask us how everything was going, she&#39;d literally scream out her sentences.

Rough meaning I drank way more than any normal human should...especially when they have to work the next day! Curse my company for making us work the day after the 4th. Honestly, our parking lot was empty and the commute to work was without any traffic to speak of. A couple of my buddies at work were in the same head pounding, dehydrated state as me yesterday and we decided the only way to semi ease our pain was to fill our faces with some greasy brunch style goodness during our lunch hour. 

Enter Jelly Cafe. Imagine my surprise when I was able to eat a normally super greasy brunch meal but with less of the mess.

I&#39;ve been seeing all my Yelp friends check in here on the daily so I knew this must be the right spot for brunch food. We walked in and I was surprised we were the only table dining in the entire corner cafe! The good with that is there was a lot of parking and we had very attentive service throughout. 

The menu at Jelly Cafe is simple with some good options but missing a little something in my humble opinion. With a name like Jelly Cafe, I would love to see more types of homemade jellies...tons of cool flavors...maybe even a jelly flight! That would spice up this cafe and bring it up a notch in my book. But alas, they have their one signature jam...I&#39;m not even sure what flavor it was but it reminded my friends and I of the lingonberry sauce you get at Ikea ~berrylicious. 

My friends and I got the beignets &amp; jelly which should be their signature item coming with four of the little guys and their jelly for $2.50. Good deal and they are so delicious! Each is a ball of warm, soft goodness covered in brown sugar - not your usual beignet - but good all the same. I didn&#39;t even need to dip it in the accompanying jelly to enjoy the little balls.

For my main dish I had the Hash Bennie and loved it. They have five styles of Eggs Benedict and this sounded the most appealing to me with their homemade corned beef hash in addition to the usual eggs benedict sandwich. I loved this dish but it just tasted a bit more - dare I say - healthy that the norm. I liked it! It was just under $10 and came with potatoes. Not too bad but also a bit more than my usual brunch diner spots.

Jelly hit the spot for my hungover coworkers and I without breaking the bank or putting us into a fattening food comatosa state. Although I&#39;m not dying to go back, I wouldn&#39;t mind venturing in once more.

jelly-cafe-mount-prospect,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,JWCFkX-4NejjGxqrDVL8Tg,"Awesome breakfast place with good prices and great food. Jelly Cafe has a slightly more unique menu like what you&#39;d find at Egg Harbor but without the extremely long wait (yet). The setting is comfortable and the service is good.  Overall, everything was cooked very well with good texture and flavor without being overly sweet or salty.

Beignets &amp; Jelly - You&#39;ve probably seen everyone who posts a picture get this, and for a good reason. These are fried perfectly so that the outside is crunchy while the inside is steaming hot and chewy. This pairs perfectly with the jelly on the side and is a MUST TRY item on your trip.

Croque Madame - Good flavor, the ham and the cheese match well together and the sandwich doesn&#39;t seem overly salty. The egg was prepared well and tied the entire dish together. The french toast could have been done a little better, maybe crispier and sweeter but this didn&#39;t make the dish bad.

Hash Bennie - Excellent texture on the hash browns, excellent flavor on the corned beef. The hollandaise sauce wasn&#39;t too distracting and the house red potatoes with sauteed onions accompanied the benedict perfectly. These potatoes are seriously good, they rival the ones made by Egg Harbor.

Pot roast skillet - the pot roast is done well, not too salty and not overcooked. The best part about this is that it&#39;s not overly saucy since too much gravy can ruin the rest of the dish (by making it too wet and salty). All the other elements (gouda cheese, onions, mushrooms) helped to support the flavor of the pot roast.

Cream of mushroom soup - great body and flavor (almost like a mushroom bisque).

Chicken sandwich - Probably the best I&#39;ve had from any of the local breakfast restaurants. The chicken was perfectly cooked and tender and accompanied by fresh avocado and tomato. The real star of the dish was probably the bacon, adding a burst of flavor the tied everything together.

Pancakes - Light and fluffy, done very well.

I may not have money but what I do have is a particular set of skills... and a smartphone. I&#39;m not afraid to use them.

When the food is great, bad service can ruin the meal.

The service at Jelly Cafe is consistently as great as their food.

Fluffy eggs. Spongy flapjacks. Sticky syrup. All good but the jelly... Raspberry-frickin-Jelly... and it accompanies four fresh fried fritters flocked with cinnamon and sugar hot from the kitchen... HEAVEN ON A PLATE. Beignets, they call &#39;em. [Ben-YAYS]

The whole crew is sincere and attentive but not overbearing. From the host to the server to the bus... always friendly. Such a pleasant experience every time.

This place has seemed to grow into the best breakfast spot in Mt. Prospect and possibly the NW burbs.

Situated on the South end of a beautiful park with a pond, playground, tennis courts, and jogging path, this spot is the perfect place for a relaxing start to a beautiful day.

jelly-cafe-mount-prospect,Jacob J.,1xJwMqmvVXPwY7yEVQIc-A,KK2B76vwj9zV4Nf6YnwjeA,"Sometime back I was in Mount Prospect with day long meetings and time to kill.  Hunger had set in and I was on the Yelp app locating a good place to have lunch.  Luckily for both parties, Jelly Cafe popped up as a local option and once I saw the food porn that Sarah S. provided of her Hash Bennie from July 2013, I was like hell to the yeah!

The place is cutesy in decor.  Nicer than your average cafe and surroundings quaint enough to enjoy the time whether solo or with a group.  Now if only they could offer Wi-Fi, I could have had my Chromebook in their with me taking care of some needed work, whilst enjoying my Bennie.

The food was good, as I was thoroughly satisfied with my order.  Service was good and my waiter made some small talk while ordering and checking back.  Food came out in a reasonable amount of time as they were having a good amount of business during lunch on a weekday.  
I&#39;m crazy about Eggs Benedict and homemade Hollandaise, which is what my waiter responded when asked whether it was real or canned.  Another detail which caught my eye via reviews was the mention of Beignets.  I&#39;ll tell you any place offering Beignets should be a must and your response to whether or not to have them should always be &#34;of course!&#34;  Beignets with jelly are a must.  The pairing of this sugar topped, light and airy French donut with a sour jelly, is perfect.  Previous experiences had left me having them solo or with a caramel dipping sauce.  This was the right amount of sweet for me.

Most folks know that Chicago is known for spectacular breakfast and brunch.  The suburbs of Chicagoland are riddled with chain eateries which offer some good staples but it&#39;s in these random Mom and Pop cafes that wonderful experiences are found.  Don&#39;t overlook the burbs.  If you can dig the food porn that Jelly Cafe is putting out, it&#39;s worth the try.",01/05/14,201,4,3,5,57,5.617600000000001,2.884,0.5609999999999999,16.555,No,1888

My first experience was about a month ago. I was in the area and stopped in for lunch with my boss. We were greeted and welcomed in a friendly manner.

The server gave great advice on what to try and I left highly satisfied. 

I loved it so much I took my boyfriend their today for breakfast. I had told him about my first experience and insisted we go again. The portions are a great size, he got full before he finished his plate (which is a rarity for him). I left full and satisfied and took half my skillet home.

I got a plate with corned beef hash, 2 eggs sunny side up and rustic potatoes. Comes with a side of toast or pancakes. Got the toast as we had jelly cheesecake French toast. 

Food is really delicious. The rustic potatoes tasted really well cooked and not burnt and not dripping with oil.  The beef hash was fresh to taste and also tasted scrumptious. 

The highlight of the brunch was the French toast. It&#39;s basically two pieces of French toast stuck together with cream cheese and sprinkled with their jelly. Vey sweet but delicious.

Hubs ordered a burger with bacon and egg, hold the cheddar cheese. It came without the bacon and egg, and without the cheese. That was quickly remedied when we pointed it out to our server. He said it was good and cooked to the right temp. 
I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast special. The steak was super tender, the breading a little weird, but overall it was good. The sausage gravy on top was very tasty. The side of potatoes were fresh real potatoes, not that shredded in a bag hash brown stuff. That alone could be a meal!

Rough meaning I drank way more than any normal human should...especially when they have to work the next day! Curse my company for making us work the day after the 4th. Honestly, our parking lot was empty and the commute to work was without any traffic to speak of. A couple of my buddies at work were in the same head pounding, dehydrated state as me yesterday and we decided the only way to semi ease our pain was to fill our faces with some greasy brunch style goodness during our lunch hour. 

Enter Jelly Cafe. Imagine my surprise when I was able to eat a normally super greasy brunch meal but with less of the mess.

I&#39;ve been seeing all my Yelp friends check in here on the daily so I knew this must be the right spot for brunch food. We walked in and I was surprised we were the only table dining in the entire corner cafe! The good with that is there was a lot of parking and we had very attentive service throughout. 

The menu at Jelly Cafe is simple with some good options but missing a little something in my humble opinion. With a name like Jelly Cafe, I would love to see more types of homemade jellies...tons of cool flavors...maybe even a jelly flight! That would spice up this cafe and bring it up a notch in my book. But alas, they have their one signature jam...I&#39;m not even sure what flavor it was but it reminded my friends and I of the lingonberry sauce you get at Ikea ~berrylicious. 

My friends and I got the beignets &amp; jelly which should be their signature item coming with four of the little guys and their jelly for $2.50. Good deal and they are so delicious! Each is a ball of warm, soft goodness covered in brown sugar - not your usual beignet - but good all the same. I didn&#39;t even need to dip it in the accompanying jelly to enjoy the little balls.

For my main dish I had the Hash Bennie and loved it. They have five styles of Eggs Benedict and this sounded the most appealing to me with their homemade corned beef hash in addition to the usual eggs benedict sandwich. I loved this dish but it just tasted a bit more - dare I say - healthy that the norm. I liked it! It was just under $10 and came with potatoes. Not too bad but also a bit more than my usual brunch diner spots.

Jelly hit the spot for my hungover coworkers and I without breaking the bank or putting us into a fattening food comatosa state. Although I&#39;m not dying to go back, I wouldn&#39;t mind venturing in once more.

I may not have money but what I do have is a particular set of skills... and a smartphone. I&#39;m not afraid to use them.

When the food is great, bad service can ruin the meal.

The service at Jelly Cafe is consistently as great as their food.

Fluffy eggs. Spongy flapjacks. Sticky syrup. All good but the jelly... Raspberry-frickin-Jelly... and it accompanies four fresh fried fritters flocked with cinnamon and sugar hot from the kitchen... HEAVEN ON A PLATE. Beignets, they call &#39;em. [Ben-YAYS]

The whole crew is sincere and attentive but not overbearing. From the host to the server to the bus... always friendly. Such a pleasant experience every time.

This place has seemed to grow into the best breakfast spot in Mt. Prospect and possibly the NW burbs.

Situated on the South end of a beautiful park with a pond, playground, tennis courts, and jogging path, this spot is the perfect place for a relaxing start to a beautiful day.

Hunger had set in and I was on the Yelp app locating a good place to have lunch.  Luckily for both parties, Jelly Cafe popped up as a local option and once I saw the food porn that Sarah S. provided of her Hash Bennie from July 2013, I was like hell to the yeah!

The place is cutesy in decor.  Nicer than your average cafe and surroundings quaint enough to enjoy the time whether solo or with a group.  Now if only they could offer Wi-Fi, I could have had my Chromebook in their with me taking care of some needed work, whilst enjoying my Bennie.

The food was good, as I was thoroughly satisfied with my order.  Service was good and my waiter made some small talk while ordering and checking back.  Food came out in a reasonable amount of time as they were having a good amount of business during lunch on a weekday.  
I&#39;m crazy about Eggs Benedict and homemade Hollandaise, which is what my waiter responded when asked whether it was real or canned.  Another detail which caught my eye via reviews was the mention of Beignets.  I&#39;ll tell you any place offering Beignets should be a must and your response to whether or not to have them should always be &#34;of course!&#34;  Beignets with jelly are a must.  The pairing of this sugar topped, light and airy French donut with a sour jelly, is perfect.  Previous experiences had left me having them solo or with a caramel dipping sauce.  This was the right amount of sweet for me.

Most folks know that Chicago is known for spectacular breakfast and brunch.  The suburbs of Chicagoland are riddled with chain eateries which offer some good staples but it&#39;s in these random Mom and Pop cafes that wonderful experiences are found.

It was small, but fill of people, and their menu is fill of variety and interesting things. Service was good and atmosphere was nice, it was cleanly and bright.

I got the own seated tilapia fish tacos. Pretty awesome. I got the cheese on the side, and I&#39;m glad because it really helped me taste the slight spiciness of the salsa. There was a slice of avocado in each taco, but also a little bowl of guacamole. It was pretty questionable... I&#39;m not a fan of super pur̩ed avocado in general though. The white corn tortilla was awesommmee.

You can choose from fries or pasta salad for a side... I chose the pasta salad and apparently no one else does because.... It was still slightly frozen. -__- so I guess they don&#39;t make that fresh daily. FYI.

Then we shared an order of beignets, which was enough for two! there were four total, and a generous amount of jelly to dip them in--which was a little on the sweet side, but pretty delicious.

The beignet are heavenly. Perfectly fried and covered in cinnamon sugar.. and you dip 
it in this homemade fruit sauce they call jelly (its not as gelatinous as the jellies I am used to).. I felt a small moment of fireworks in my mouth when I ate these pillows of cinnamon sugar dough. They were AWESOME!

Jelly Cafe is proof that the American diner concept doesn&#39;t have to be boring, bland, or tasteless. Why? Because Jelly Cafe is none of those things.

It&#39;s super-cute, from the outside to the inside. Nice little wrought-iron bistro tables and chairs sit outside -- and they&#39;re both big enough and spaced well enough that you&#39;d feel totally comfortable sitting out there on a nice day. It&#39;s relaxing and inviting, with some nice hanging baskets of flowers keeping the area pretty and homey. 

Then you go inside. The decorations are modern without being uncomfortably so. It&#39;s not hipstery; it&#39;s homey and comforting, but it&#39;s also not your sainted great grandmother&#39;s sitting room with floral wallpaper and plastic covers on all the furniture. Super nice. 

The tables are nice, but the high-backed booths are even nicer. They do a great job of keeping your conversation within your area, and keeping other peoples&#39; conversations outside. Very nice. 

The food! Most of the Yelpers who have reviewed this place have mentioned the beignet &amp; jelly side as a must. As my SO says, &#34;if it&#39;s in the name of the place, you pretty much have to try it.&#34; We did. 

Four of the most beautiful freshly-made, cinnamon-sugar dusted beignets you could ever want to see came out with a little dish of their homemade fruit sauce...er, &#34;jelly.&#34; I don&#39;t say &#34;jelly&#34; mockingly; it&#39;s just not set the way most jellies are, but that&#39;s a good thing in this case. Picture the most delicious jelly doughnut you&#39;ve ever had. This is better. I guarantee you this is better. That is, unless your mom or grandma made that doughnut in your mind, in which case I&#39;m a liar. (Of course your mom&#39;s and/or grandma&#39;s is better! But this is a close second!)

We came in around 11am on a Thursday morning, so it&#39;s prime brunch time. I&#39;m the kind of girl who could easily eat breakfast for any meal of the day. My SO went with the portabella and steak panini with a side of pasta salad, and I went with the croque madame. We also each had a fresh fruit smoothie: he had strawberry/pineapple, while I had strawberry/mango. 

The smoothies were delicious, and exactly as advertised. Definitely hit the spot for a smoothie craving. The croque madame at Jelly puts a slight spin on the traditional croque madame. Instead of just being the fanciest, nicest grilled ham and cheese you&#39;ll ever eat (I say it&#39;s the gruyere that does it), Jelly takes away the Mornay sauce and makes it with french toast instead. So even though you have the fried egg on top, it&#39;s still marginally less messy. (I still didn&#39;t pick it up and eat it with my hands, though.) 

The breakfast potatoes that come with the croque madame are very tasty. The croque madame itself isn&#39;t crunchy at all (which, well, &#34;croque&#34; does mean &#34;crunchy,&#34; but I&#39;m not complaining because it&#39;s really tasty), but crucially, some of the potatoes *are*. I love crispy, well-seasoned breakfast potatoes. I also noticed that you can order traditional hash browns as a side, if your breakfast palate isn&#39;t satisfied by mere breakfast potatoes. Most places only have either/or, so that&#39;s really nice of Jelly to do.

My SO&#39;s portabella and steak panini was HUGE. He&#39;s a boy who can throw down on a much bigger amount of food than I can, and even he said it was huge! The pasta salad was very tasty, with a nice vinegary kick to it. The horseradish sauce served with the panini was creamy and smooth and flavorful, and suited the sandwich beautifully. (It wasn&#39;t bad on my breakfast potatoes, either.) 

All in all, definitely a good experience. We&#39;ll be back, and we&#39;d probably recommend it to everyone we know. We saw some of the coffeepots on tables that Candice G and others have mentioned, which is awesome if you&#39;re a coffee drinker. I also appreciate that you can do a half-sandwich, cup of soup lunch special if you want.

Jelly Cafe got put to the test today on a Sunday brunch at 10:30, which could only be worse if it was 12:00. They really hustle there, but our food still came out pretty slow BUT when I have my own carafe of coffee, I&#39;m happy.

The beignet are heavenly. Perfectly fried and covered in cinnamon sugar.. and you dip 
it in this homemade fruit sauce they call jelly (its not as gelatinous as the jellies I am used to).. I felt a small moment of fireworks in my mouth when I ate these pillows of cinnamon sugar dough. They were AWESOME! 

So I get excited for my main breakfast meal when my Jelly Cheesecake French Toast arrived. I took a bite and to my despair, I was a little disappointed. They were wet and soggy. It maybe the type of bread, it was thin and flimsy. I saw the cream cheese but it was overpowered by the jelly that you could not really taste it.  When I ate the The Works Skillet, first thing that pop in my head was the Papa John&#39;s The Works Pizza. It tasted just like it.

Jelly Cafe is proof that the American diner concept doesn&#39;t have to be boring, bland, or tasteless. Why? Because Jelly Cafe is none of those things.

It&#39;s super-cute, from the outside to the inside. Nice little wrought-iron bistro tables and chairs sit outside -- and they&#39;re both big enough and spaced well enough that you&#39;d feel totally comfortable sitting out there on a nice day. It&#39;s relaxing and inviting, with some nice hanging baskets of flowers keeping the area pretty and homey. 

Then you go inside. The decorations are modern without being uncomfortably so. It&#39;s not hipstery; it&#39;s homey and comforting, but it&#39;s also not your sainted great grandmother&#39;s sitting room with floral wallpaper and plastic covers on all the furniture. Super nice. 

The tables are nice, but the high-backed booths are even nicer. They do a great job of keeping your conversation within your area, and keeping other peoples&#39; conversations outside. Very nice. 

The food! Most of the Yelpers who have reviewed this place have mentioned the beignet &amp; jelly side as a must. As my SO says, &#34;if it&#39;s in the name of the place, you pretty much have to try it.&#34; We did. 

Four of the most beautiful freshly-made, cinnamon-sugar dusted beignets you could ever want to see came out with a little dish of their homemade fruit sauce...er, &#34;jelly.&#34; I don&#39;t say &#34;jelly&#34; mockingly; it&#39;s just not set the way most jellies are, but that&#39;s a good thing in this case. Picture the most delicious jelly doughnut you&#39;ve ever had. This is better. I guarantee you this is better. That is, unless your mom or grandma made that doughnut in your mind, in which case I&#39;m a liar. (Of course your mom&#39;s and/or grandma&#39;s is better! But this is a close second!)

We came in around 11am on a Thursday morning, so it&#39;s prime brunch time. I&#39;m the kind of girl who could easily eat breakfast for any meal of the day. My SO went with the portabella and steak panini with a side of pasta salad, and I went with the croque madame. We also each had a fresh fruit smoothie: he had strawberry/pineapple, while I had strawberry/mango. 

The smoothies were delicious, and exactly as advertised. Definitely hit the spot for a smoothie craving. The croque madame at Jelly puts a slight spin on the traditional croque madame. Instead of just being the fanciest, nicest grilled ham and cheese you&#39;ll ever eat (I say it&#39;s the gruyere that does it), Jelly takes away the Mornay sauce and makes it with french toast instead. So even though you have the fried egg on top, it&#39;s still marginally less messy. (I still didn&#39;t pick it up and eat it with my hands, though.) 

The breakfast potatoes that come with the croque madame are very tasty. The croque madame itself isn&#39;t crunchy at all (which, well, &#34;croque&#34; does mean &#34;crunchy,&#34; but I&#39;m not complaining because it&#39;s really tasty), but crucially, some of the potatoes *are*. I love crispy, well-seasoned breakfast potatoes. I also noticed that you can order traditional hash browns as a side, if your breakfast palate isn&#39;t satisfied by mere breakfast potatoes. Most places only have either/or, so that&#39;s really nice of Jelly to do.

My SO&#39;s portabella and steak panini was HUGE. He&#39;s a boy who can throw down on a much bigger amount of food than I can, and even he said it was huge! The pasta salad was very tasty, with a nice vinegary kick to it. The horseradish sauce served with the panini was creamy and smooth and flavorful, and suited the sandwich beautifully. (It wasn&#39;t bad on my breakfast potatoes, either.) 

All in all, definitely a good experience. We&#39;ll be back, and we&#39;d probably recommend it to everyone we know. We saw some of the coffeepots on tables that Candice G and others have mentioned, which is awesome if you&#39;re a coffee drinker. I also appreciate that you can do a half-sandwich, cup of soup lunch special if you want. My kind of lunch special (when I&#39;m not feeling brunchy)!",15/08/13,464,5,5,5,143,15.963899999999997,11.367,0.761,39.872,No,4105

Jelly Cafe got put to the test today on a Sunday brunch at 10:30, which could only be worse if it was 12:00. They really hustle there, but our food still came out pretty slow BUT when I have my own carafe of coffee, I&#39;m happy.

Don&#39;t let anybody tell you it isn&#39;t really LOUD in there, and Jelly Cafe is very kid friendly which is fine for those of us who enjoy other people&#39;s kids, but it definitely adds to the volume. Our food looked good too, I specifically wanted to try the cornedbeefhashbrowns and I liked it. My partner&#39;s bacon and fig omelette with melted provolone was fantastic even if a little overdone and the coffee was good. 
They seemed pretty flexible letting me choose a fruit cup over MORE toast or pancakes and I appreciated it. Interesting menu and we saw several other choices we would like to try, and that is NOT our usual experience in most breakfast oriented restaurants.

We braved it out here during Chiberia to meet a friend in from out of town. Parking lot was plowed, restaurant was warm - both good signs.

I was surprised, but the menu was pretty extensive - egg dishes, crepes, pancakes, sandwiches, steel cut oats, eggs benedict (they call them Bennies), etc.

The food was tasty. My friend and I had the Huevos Locos while the hubby had one of the Bennies. The chorizo they used in my dish was fantastic - just enough kick to where I didn&#39;t need hot sauce. And the red potatoes were yummy too. They came in big chunks and I dipped mine in ketchup. The husband said the Bennie was good too, though I was too full to try any of it. My only grip is the Huevos Locos didn&#39;t come with a side of toast. How was I supposed to eat up my over easy eggs?

Our waitress kept the coffee flowing, which scored big points from me on such a cold,  gross day. Granted, the place wasn&#39;t hopping, but we didn&#39;t feel rushed at all to go, even though our meal was a lingering one to catch up.

Believe it or not, the place started to fill up as we were getting ready to head out.

However, despite being busy, Jelly&#39;s was able to get us in within 5 minutes. Our waitress was prompt and personable. 

My boyfriend ordered the Banana Nut Waffles and I was torn between two dishes - the Strawberry Banana Nutella Crepes and the Green and White omelet.

We were greeted, sat, and had water and menus all within one minute of opening the front door. The menu had a lot to choose from without overwhelming me. Those seven page breakfast places make it hard to choose and make me nervous about how possible it is that everything back there is fresh. 

I went for a chicken wrap and fries while my sis went for one of their versions of eggs Benedict. We were both full and almost part of the clean plate club.

... and by &#39;life&#39; I mean every electronic device I own. Every.single.motherf*cking.one.of.them (as any character in Pulp Fiction would say). But it was okay. You know why? Because I took a minute to have a meltdown, came to Jelly Cafe as an escape and they served me an entire personal pitcher of coffee. Serenity now.

The coffee was pretty great, especially considering the day it saved me from, and came in one of those carafes that keep everything warm and that they let you keep on your table all to yourself, that&#39;s also served with a smaller cup of cream for those of you like me who might not even really be a fan of coffee if it weren&#39;t for the creamer. 

The inside is super cute, not much of a waiting area if you get there during a busy hour, but at 2:15 on a Monday, I was the only one in there. I got my pick of seats so I went with one of their ultra cozy booths with super high backs so your dining experience feels very private, but you still get to take in the big open space of the dining area. It&#39;s immaculate and bright inside and the mood of my server, Brittany only further reflected that. She was full of smiles, inviting, polite, knowledgeable about the menu and even though the place was empty and 45-minutes to being closed, she kept busy working, wiping, sweeping, stocking, making sure all things were in order. 

The menu wasn&#39;t anything mold-breaking, they aren&#39;t reinventing the wheel. the offerings were actually pretty classic but the twist is that they&#39;re more cleaned up. Nothing greasy or heavy, nothing that&#39;s going to outright cause your heart to clog upon consumption. Very refreshing. 

I went with the beignets and jelly side, which for two balls at $2.50 seemed like a lot, but they were absolutely delightful and something I&#39;ll no doubt order every time I return. I rounded out my meal with the breakfast burrito, but subbed the regular chorizo for avocado to make it meatless, and they made that substitution without hesitation or up-charge. The meal came out in perfect timing and was served with a side of lightly seasoned diced potatoes that were cooked exactly the way I like them- firm, but still kinda squishy inside. The burrito was huge and very tidy as far as burritos go. Not sloppy and oozing out all over like you&#39;d normally see. It came with a side of salsa and sour cream and was stuffed with super fluffy eggs and a generous serving of avocados. I was pretty hungry and felt like I was going to demolish the plate, but it ended up being so filling that I had to get a box for most of the potatoes and over half the burrito, which was great because at $9.50 a pop, I didn&#39;t mind seeing that stretch into two meals.

I had the Nutella strawberry pancakes and my boyfriend had the steak and eggs. The pancakes were good and no I was only able to eat half taking the other half home.

Then he proceeded to mention how much he loved the light, airy biscuits throughout breakfast. So if you&#39;re a biscuits and gravy fan, this is your dish. 

I had a custom omelet with turkey sausage, spinach, mushrooms and goat cheese. It was tasty, but a lot of egg. Their omelets are made with 4 eggs; I must usually eat 3 egg omelets.  The menu said it was served with house red potatoes and saut̩ed onions, so I was hoping for baby red/new potatoes.  It&#39;s actually one big hash brown without any onions. 

Service was slow on a Sunday morning. We had a table in the back so I think they forgot about us. It was about 20 minutes between being sat and taking our drink order.  At least we didn&#39;t have to wait for a table (surprising for a Sunday) and our food came quickly.

From our first time, we were greeted very friendly by the host, as well as having an attentive server. Second time around, no friendly host, and the service lacked, but it was closer to them closing, so that could explain it. However, I did order a side which I&#39;ve been wanting to try (Beignets &amp; Jelly) and he never brought it to my table, so I was pretty upset about that. 

I&#39;ve gotten their Caprese Bennie which was excellent. It&#39;s their egg Benedict with 2 poached eggs, fresh mozzarella, pesto, grilled tomatoes, and a English muffin - it comes with a side of house red potatoes which are so good (don&#39;t forget the ketchup). I recommend this as it was one of the best Benedict&#39;s I&#39;ve ever tried. The next time I was there, I ordered the croque madame breakfast sandwich - it was just OK. It was my only second time having this sandwich, so if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that I had the most amazing croque madame in a French bakery in Cali, this may have been better, but i will not get it again. 

The coffee is great here and they serve it in your own personal coffee pot, so you can refill it yourself without having to wait. My boyfriend had the grilled asparagus and egg, and considering he ordered it both times, he must have really liked it! 

The inside is nicely lit up because of the giant windows surrounding the restaurant. There are tables in the middle, and booths along the sides, which are very nice and private.

The menu is huge - ten different omelettes, ten different benedicts, plus stratas, fritattas, quiches, skillets, crepes, waffles, french toast, and pancakes.

I got the corn &amp; brie frittata with avocado salsa (on the specials menu), my husband got the breakfast tacos. The frittata was an amazing flavor combo, and really unique. I love brie, and the combo of brie, roasted corn, and avocado was perfect. The frittata came with oven roasted potatoes and a huge piece of freshly baked toast. The breakfast tacos were just what they sound like, tortillas stuffed full of eggs, cheese, and veggies.

Unfortunate you can only grab that a couple of nights a week. 
And so this trip it was for breakfast, which was pretty tasty! 
I think starting with some apple beignets is a smart way to start the morning, and although these were tasty, I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d rush back for them. But hey, at $3.50 an order, it wasn&#39;t a HUGE investment. The breakfast tacos on the other hand were SUPER tasty. They can benefit from an extra tortilla to hold all the goodness inside, so you might consider grabbing a few more, and I&#39;d recommend some extra salsa too. I got mine with chicken which in the end was probably a silly move. I should have stuck with the chorizo which they recommend.

She had dark hair and looked to be no more than 18 or 19.  That we had to repeat the word &#34;Pat&#34; to her 3 times when we weren&#39;t more than a foot away from her was the first clue something was wrong...she kept repeating it back to us as &#34;Dot?&#34;...with the 100 yard stare...she told us there would be a 20 minute wait for the patio...we were good with that, so we stepped outside for 10 minutes, as the foyer was filling up quickly...while we were outside, she gave our patio seats away.

My hungrier half &amp; I seldom get to go out to breakfast, and when we do, we usually hit up our &#34;regular&#34; spot, which is within walking distance of our house.  This time around, I wanted to try something new.  The original plan was to go to Richard Walkers, but I got vetoed (judging by some of the reviews out there, I&#39;m not missing much).  I took to Yelp to save us from our routine, and I came across Benedict&#39;s La Strata.  What caught my eye, after perusing the menu, were a few standout details:

- They serve some organic items (apple juice and yogurt are the two that stick in my mind)
- They serve Intelligencia coffee, which is my absolute fave!
- Their menu is HUGE &amp; varied, offering a little bit of everything from omelets to crepes, benedicts, pancakes, waffles, etc. (they also have a small lunch menu, but breakfast is most definitely their mainstay.
- They&#39;re local &amp; not a huge chain (something that we both appreciate)

Bonus, when we called to see how busy they were, we were told that a party of 2 would be seated right away.  We hightailed it on over before the potential rush hit.

The decor is super cute, sort of a modern kitschy country farm thing going on, with red walls &amp; rooster decor.  There is ample seating, so grabbing a table was no problem at all.  

Normally I&#39;m not much of a &#34;sweet&#34; breakfast gal; I prefer omelets to pancakes any day.  But for some reason the stuffed cherry French toast caught my eye (&amp; my stomach for that matter), and I couldn&#39;t resist.  To balance things out, I ordered myself some vanilla organic yogurt, the perfect compliment to my French toast.

My hungrier half got the breakfast burrito, because he&#39;s a sucker for anything wrapped up in a tortilla and/or containing chorizo.  His portion was HUGE, and even though he&#39;s a longtime member of the clean plate club, even he had to pony up and ask for a take home box.

Well, I really have no good reason to want to!!

This was my first time at this location, and it was great (I personally prefer the Dundee location, though), but this was a great experience as well!

After being seated (ten-minute wait at 9 on a Sunday, but there were a LOT of people waiting after us), my sister and I perused the menu and picked out about 27 things off of the menu that we wanted.  

We may or may not have been &#34;hungry shopping&#34;. ;)

So after much debate, she ordered the BLT Eggs benedict, I ordered the Egg white/turkey omelet (I added onions), and we had pumpkin pancakes off of the specials menu to share (like I said, HUNGRY).

The food came out SO quickly, and it was really, really delicious.  My sister&#39;s BLT Benedict was amazing--well, you add bacon to anything, it&#39;s going to be awesome!  My omelet was good, but there was a $.95 upcharge for adding onions....um, really?!  That&#39;s a small onion right there.  A DOLLAR?!?!  That seemed a little extreme...

Oh, and the pumpkin pancakes were AWESOME.  It came with three, so we each had one and I was able to take one home!!  YUM--it was just as good the next day.

Our waitress was really sweet as was any of the other people who came to serve us (the woman delivering food, the woman who refilled our drinks).  They were all really on top of things!


The only thing to keep my review from being five stars (other than a dollar for freaking onions) was the hostess.  She was a little...brisk.  That might be too nice of a word.  She was downright rude (brisk toward me, but I didn&#39;t get yelled at).  I get that you need to repeat the same thing a lot to customers (&#34;I can&#39;t seat you until your entire party is here&#34;).  Heck, I even heard her say it to about 11 different people in my ten-minute wait, but that&#39;s what you signed on for when you got the job as hostess.  But I actually heard her YELL it at customers and give them major attitude when they would come in with two people and request a table for three.  The customer wasn&#39;t rude whatsoever, but basically got yelled at as the first impression.  Whoa...",13/11/12,269,4,2,5,47,6.091900000000001,3.2270000000000003,0.45100000000000007,22.321999999999996,No,2181

This is a solid breakfast place in Crystal Lake&#39;s cute downtown. Despite the central location, there&#39;s plenty of seating, and the place was poppin&#39; at brunch.

The food was a step above your average breakfast place, with more interesting dishes that the usual omelets and skillets (though they have those, too). My wife had a smoked salmon benedict, which she liked, though poached eggs are not really my thing.

I had the Jambalaya Eggs, which were coated in cheese and sauce and were pretty tasty, if lacking in shrimp. They were, however, extremely rich. Make sure you&#39;re hungry!

I&#39;ve ordered from here on a few occasions and everything&#39;s been pretty flavorful. Why the 3 stars? My biggest complaint is that they won&#39;t seat you until your whole party is there. I&#39;ve only ordered take out up until this past week and when I went in, I noticed several elderly people were standing by the front door. I figured it was a really large party and they were all waiting for their friends/family. My friend was on her way so I thought I&#39;d stand there and look at the menu. Then I got a text she was running late. So I asked to be seated. The first hostess said she&#39;d seat the other party behind me  since everyone was there and then come back. When the second hostess came by, I assumed she&#39;d take me to my seat. Nope! She mumbled, &#34;We don&#39;t seat incomplete parties during lunch&#34; then hurried away. Fortunately, the first hostess followed through when she got back, otherwise I would&#39;ve taken my wait outside until my friend showed up and went elsewhere. I don&#39;t fully understand this practice of making people stand there, cluttering up the front--especially THE ELDERLY!!!! 

The second star was taken off because, while I love their skillets, many of their diced potatoes are rock hard because they&#39;ve been cut too small. Other than that, I&#39;ve had their Mediterranean Chicken sandwich and it was absolutely scrumptious.",21/08/14,149,3,1,4,-3,3.0850999999999997,1.338,0.41100000000000003,15.250999999999998,No,1415

Let me start by saying the service we received was outstanding... No complaints there.  Our waitress was exceptionally friendly, helpful &amp; on top of things.

My first issue begins with the ladies room. It&#39;s a pretty good rule of thumb that the cleanliness in the restrooms is an indicator of how the rest of the place is cleaned.  We drove in over an hour to get to this place so I REALLY had to use the facilities when we arrived. For me, there&#39;s nothing more gross then seeing a thick layer of dust on everything.  The garbage bin lids, the top of the paper towel machines &amp; my biggest peeve, the fake plants. Dust that thick doesn&#39;t happen overnight...so one star off for not cleaning.

Lastly, I ordered the apple, brie, bacon omelet.  It came with an orange slice, about a 1/2 cup diced potatoes, an English muffin and I ordered a side of bacon.  Coffee is amazing because it&#39;s Intelligensia. The food came out in a very reasonable time but was not hot.  It wasn&#39;t cold but, I prefer my food hot if it&#39;s coming out of the kitchen that quickly. The bacon was a bit greasy but good.  The omelet concept was amazing but the flavors didn&#39;t marry &amp; it was bland. This could have been easily prevented with a little salt in the kitchen. The potatoes we&#39;re not fresh, room temperature, dry &amp; needing of salt.

I dined with my husband, MIL &amp; SIL... everyone agreed it was a pleasant breakfast but the food was meh.

The other thing that is a little wonky is their portion size. Some items you can barely finish, others will leave you ordering an extra item.

benedicts-la-strata-crystal-lake,Holly P.,3zeQJFbasEq8ZA8wE81kUA,E4Nb-bgyWBJFFZYgV5Sexw,"The food is not bad and the prices are reasonable.  The reason I will not be returning to this restaurant is because I now have serious doubts about what is going on behind the scenes.  It started with the fact that they can not handle simple modifications to menu items such as &#34;no cheese&#34;.  I have ordered food togo there 3 times now.  Each time I have had to have it remade.  Somehow the kitchen either does not receive the order correctly or they don&#39;t read it and the cashier who puts the order together does not check whether it is correct.  

Last time I ordered 2 dishes with no cheese and brought them home to see they were covered with cheese.  I called ahead to have them remade, checked them upon returning and the new dishes were STILL covered with cheese.  The manager put together the third attempt at making my order but even then it was missing the sides.  He gave me a card for 2 complementary meals for the trouble.

I finally decided to redeem the complementary meals today.  I clearly explained my order to the cashier.  One with no sour cream and the other with no english muffin.  Again, I clearly explained that I was using the card the manager had given me, my previous orders had not been made correctly and it was extremely important that there not be an english muffin with my food because I am gluten intolerant.  She repeated my order perfectly.  Then to my surprise, my food still come out with the muffin.  Not in a separate container or on the side but UNDERNEATH the eggs I had ordered.  This was especially frustrating because Benedict&#39;s markets themselves as celiac-friendly.  They label their menu items GF when appropriate and even serve gluten-free pancakes.  This gives a false sense of confidence in this restaurant to people with this dietary issue.  

Whether it is a failure in communication or a serious lack of attention to detail, I seriously doubt it only extends to food preparation.  Based on my experience in the industry, a kitchen staff that fails to make orders correctly and a service/managerial staff that fails to notice these mistakes are also neglecting food safety and cleanliness requirements.

The first time was during Crystal Lake&#39;s Johnny Appleseed Festival when me and my mother ate breakfast before walking around the fest. 

We were fawning over the breakfast menu for a good 10 minutes. They have every egg dish you would ever want, as well as every pancake, waffle, and skillet options. I haven&#39;t been brave (or hungry) enough for the Bavarian skillet. From what I remember it has like full sized bratwursts, onions, potatoes, swiss cheese all ontop of eggs.. This menu has something for every type of breakfast diner. 

They also serve Intelligentsia coffee (and also give you your own carafe) with freshly made beignets, covered in powdered sugar.. It really is a treat!

Definitely a hidden gem in the area, it seemed liked everyone there was a local which is always a good sign :)

Definitely pay close attention to the specials, they seem to always be changing and are worth while. My boyfriend tried the pulled pork skillet, YES pulled pork for breakfast, and was hooked. I opted for a veggie skillet and really enjoyed it, ingredients were fresh and dead on.

It sounds like the place could definitely expand, they have space outside but it was one of the 100 degree days of summer and the A/C was not working, which made it kind of brutal, but definitely understand those things happen sometimes.

Also I wish they would serve the beignets on the weekend! when else can I rationalize dessert for breakfast? definitely not on a monday...

The Good (chili)
The brisket chili had the perfect blend of spices, and the cornbread was tremendous!

The So-So (crab boil)
I&#39;m a southern woman, so I have high expectations for flavor. The  crab boil was a bit mild for my taste, but Alexa helped me out with some add-on seasoning. In the future, I would hope they let seasoning really &#34;set&#34; before serving.",15/11/16,91,4,2,5,41,4.1151,2.149,0.0,6.851,No,740

I guess you just expect places like this to serve portions that only a 400 lb person would find spot on but I understand that is the nature of this type of offering. . 

I had the ribs and the chicken combo (which were served prior with bread that was soaked in garlic butter).  (Maybe carry some Tic Tacs if you are on a date.. but then again, why are you going here on your date.. )  The ribs were great and I&#39;d order again, but the chicken could have been a bit more seasoned.

I had the chicken and waffles and my wife had a combo plate so that we could sample different items.  The BAM BAM shrimp appetizer was 1/2 price so I started off with that.  We were there early on a weekday afternoon so it was pretty quite.  They were playing some great blues music throughout the restaurant. The shrimp was amazing. Dressing not to spicy and served on a bed of cabbage slaw. 

It was the first time I had eaten chicken and waffles so I wasn&#39;t sure how to eat it.  It comes with an amazing jalapeno jam, honey butter and a country gravy that I could have eaten with a spoon! The chicken was breaded and fairly large.  I wasn&#39;t aware that there were still bones in it which made it a bit difficult to eat while trying to cut into the waffles.   

The ribs were really good but on the short side (Only like 3-4&#34;). They had just the right enough pull to them. Not fall off the bone but not tough at all. Very well done.  The pulled pork was ok. Not exceptional in any respect.  The brisket fell far short of my expectations.  Thinly sliced.  Fairly salty. Not much smoked flavor.  Didn&#39;t even look appealing for a piece of meat that had been smoked for hours.

Service was friendly and polite.

I was singing like Neil Diamond by the end of the night. If you watch the Yelp video I posted you will hear my singing talents as I belt out, &#34;Bop Bop Bop!&#34; &amp; &#34;So Good. So Good!&#34; Look out American Idol &amp; The Voice I&#39;m coming for you next. Yelpers start voting on my video now. Actually Friday nights are a lot of fun here. They have the &#34;Live Pete Show&#34; &amp; he plays music from 5pm to 10:30pm. The guy is magical &amp; smooth when he sings. I felt like I was listening to the coolest CD ever. Pete is a performer from his ultra cool jacket to the old time microphone. I could listen to this guy sing all night. In fact, we ended having a three hour fantastic dinner. 

When you walk in, you will notice all of the cool antique memorabilia on the walls. My favorite item was the giant neon Blatz beer sign hanging in the middle of the room. I want this in my house. This place has such a fantastic feel inside plus they had great holiday decorations. I loved how the restaurant was like a giant loft with the bar in the dinning room. It just added to the fun atmosphere.  Everyone in the restaurant could hear Live Pete playing music but it wasn&#39;t very loud, so we could still enjoy having a great dinner conversation without yelling across the table. 

When we sat at our table I notice that the  chairs were incredibly comfortable. It had taken us an hour from downtown Chicago to get here and when we sat in our seats it was so enjoyable. I didn&#39;t mind sitting down again. 

We started out with some cocktails. I ordered the hand crafted blackberry bourbon smash which was fantastic. I loved how the drink wasn&#39;t overly sweet and it was a great way to start my evening. We also ordered the Maryland lump crab cake &amp; I will tell you it was one of the best crab cakes I&#39;ve had in Chicago. It stands up above all of the fancy downtown joints. In fact, I liked this one the best cause it had a little spice to it. The chef hit it out of the park with this amazing opening dish. If I walked away now, I would be a happy man. There was also a side of coleslaw which was delicious with a nice spice to it. My little one started out with the clam chowder and it was phenomenal. I love that she is such a foodie. 

I was in need of a second cocktail when I decided to go with the Ginger Crush. I was in love with this drink &amp; I would be enjoying it for the rest of the night. When I find a drink I love why would I choose anything else. This cocktail is very similar to a Moscow mule but made with tequila, fresh lemon, mint &amp; ginger. This is my summer drink! I can&#39;t wait to come back here when it&#39;s warmer &amp; drink this on the great outdoor patio. 

I loved the kids menu. We typically do not order off of it but my little one saw Filet Mignon on there &amp; she had to have it. I feel sorry for her boyfriend cause she&#39;s not going to be a fast food date. I was really impressed with the steak. It came with two petite pieces and ranch fries. They even cooked it perfectly for a child. It was done medium &amp; not dried out. The chef knew the timing on cooking the steak &amp; I was happy cutting it up for her. My little one also jumped into the garlic butter bread rolls. We got three for the table but for some reason I only got one bite. My little one loves bread. These rolls reminded me of the addictive buns you get at Bob Chinn&#39;s. I wish I would have asked for another basket cause they were very good. 

For our entrees I went with the Shrimp Creole which was delish. I loved all of the spices. I could have used some of that bread to soak up the yummy sauce. The sauce was made with butter, beer &amp; Cajun spices. I wish I had a shot glass of it to toast the table. The entree came with a choice of two sides &amp; I went with the Mac N Cheese &amp; the chili. The Mac N Cheese was creamy &amp; yummy. I wished I had more. My side was a tease &amp; I&#39;m going to need to come back here for a full bowl. I was really impressed with the deep red chili with chunks of beef brisket. Again I can not wait to come back here for a giant bowl of this. 

My wife decided to go with the fish of the day. It was a grouper with a white wine sauce, fresh tomato, avocado over green &amp; white asparagus &amp; a fantastic polenta. My wife doesn&#39;t like polenta &amp; she dived in. I&#39;m a huge polenta fan &amp; I couldn&#39;t stop stealing it off her plate. She had three giant pieces &amp; I was able to steal about 2.4 of it. I&#39;m lucky she didn&#39;t poke me with her butter knife. I really loved her fish &amp; the sauce worked great on it. I wish that this dish was always on the menu cause it was a winner &amp; I would drive out here for it. 

We were almost ready to throw in the towel when we had a family discussion for dessert. My wife and I were voting for key lime pie &amp; our little one was voting for fresh hot maple bacon donuts. Our waiter Zack who was now a part of our family was voting for donuts, so we got both. Wow those donuts are magical! What a perfect ending for dinner.

Midway through, we were brought biscuits and gravy to try.  The biscuits were made fresh and were fluffy.  The gravy was perfect and had a hint of smokiness.  Best I&#39;ve had.

I did the combo platter and the smashed sweet potatoes and was very pleased. Everyone enjoyed their selections and sides.

They had a large party at some high top tables by the bar. Even with that group of people we still had plenty of attention from the wait staff. 

I would go back again and recommend you give them a try. I wish they had a booth set up vs. all tables.

I got a shrimp po boy and some cheesy grits I could share with the kids.  Kids got a waffle with strawberry sauce and sausage patties.  Husband went for the ribs with sweet potatoes.  The sandwich was delicious (get the spicy keeper sauce on the side) and the girls ate everything on their plates as well as a lot of the grits.  Great service and all of this was under $50!  Husband thought the ribs were just okay (i.e. He wouldn&#39;t make the drive for them).",24/10/16,86,4,2,3,24,2.8884999999999996,1.9569999999999999,0.214,8.829,No,721

We did not order any seafood, just brisket, pulled pork and ribs. Our sides were BBQ beans, Mac and cheese and corn bread. The amount of smoke was just right, you tasted it but it was not bitter. The meat was a touch over cooked if you were in competition but it was tender, juicy, and flavorful. The ribs were very small, like a Danish cut. The bones were maybe 2.5 -3 inches long; but great taste. The dinner came with tasty rolls and Texas Toast. 

Our sides were delicious! I&#39;d drive an hour for the corn bread alone! It comes freshly baked in a skillet with maple butter.  The beans were mild with a touch of smoke. The Mac and cheese was creamy and sooooo good!

Here are the pros: 
* Food
* Portions
* Food Options
* Location
* Parking

The food is amazing and Fresh! All the BBQ&#39;d meats are placed on a slow cooker/roaster for about 14 hours so the meat has amazing flavor no matter what meat option you choose. 

You also get to use 3 different types of BBQ sauce to perfect your flavor experience to your liking. 

You also get treated to complimentary garlic rolls. These are amazing! They a baked at the restaurant and pretty much made to order. So the bread is soft and flavorful! You may feel questionable about the quantity they give (1 roll per guest) but trust me you&#39;ll be fine. 

When it comes to the actual dinner. The portions are really good and very fair for the price you pay. I went with the &#34;Pick 2&#34; option and I picked the pulled pork (cooked great and so tender) and half rack of ribs (Ribs were also tender and flavorful) I had more then enough to take home and the price was very decent. 

Save room for desert! You have to try the Bacon Maple Donuts! Holy $hit! So good! You get donuts and bacon and it&#39;s also dessert! What&#39;s not to like? 

Cons: 
* Wait times during the Weekend
* Queuing System

If you plan of going FRI, SAT, or SUN. It will benefit you if you reserve a spot ahead of time. The wait time was longer then quoted at the host table and they seem to give shorter wait times to parties of 4 or more VS parties of 2.  As we were seated (party of 2) after groups of 4 who checked in after us. 

The queuing system seems to need some work. Either the system they use or the users who are using it. 

All reservations are made with an app service called &#34;NOWAITAPP&#34; which prompts you for a phone number to book your reservation. Which in turn you get an SMS confirmation and another SMS notification when your table is ready. 

We didn&#39;t seem to get the notification that our table was ready so we are assuming the hosts were having issues with the check in system and when manual to some degree. 

Will I got back? Sure! Just during a time where it&#39;s not too busy.",15/01/16,258,4,1,5,-18,9.1953,6.117,0.633,23.25,No,2256

What kept me hooked though was checking out the menu.   Almost every item listed peaked my interest.   I decided to order carryout from there.

I was torn between several items.   Fire-roasted Crab &amp; Shrimp Artichokes or Smoked Chicken?   Crab Cakes or Spicy Grilled Jerk Shrimp?  Traditional Lobsta Roll or The King Crab &#39;N Que?    So many enticing choices...such a limited appetite.   What&#39;s a poor sap like me to do?

In the end I ordered the Smoked Chicken, Lobsta Roll, and some ginger beer to wash it all down.    All of their carryout orders are picked up at Moretti&#39;s Ristorante &amp; PIzzeria&#39;s Carryout section.    I went inside Sweet Caroline&#39;s Crab-N-QUE by mistake and the hostess was friendly enough to direct me to Moretti&#39;s.   The restaurant itself looked packed so business clearly is doing well.

The staff at Morettis&#39; were friendly as well when going to pick up my order.

The ginger beer I thought was a little tiny for the price but the drink was good.   I was overall happy with the food.  I especially loved the smoked chicken wings.

So, interesting fact, this plaza is about to be dominated by the Moretti&#39;s owner, like a one-sided game of Risk. Steak &amp; Shake is like a super fortified Australia, so no one&#39;s going to be attacking them anytime soon, but Macaroni Grill is like little ol&#39; Europe, that&#39;s about to get hit from all sides! Shame, because I like Macaroni Grill. And yes, this Moretti&#39;s owner is the same owner of Snuggery. Sweet Caroline&#39;s is a new concept from Moretti&#39;s. This used to be the old Lone Star, and it&#39;s been vacant forever. One random day, I went to Steak &amp; Shake for dessert with some friends, and there&#39;s this new shiny sign, and more importantly, a really interesting concept! 

&#34;Crab N Que.&#34; Sounds like Seafood BBQ Fusion! I&#39;ve never had smoked or grilled crab/seafood. I wonder if that&#39;ll even be good? So, a couple weeks after their grand opening, I finally got the chance to go here...

BABY BACK RIBS
Ribs were moist enough, but not as good as they could be. Good char, good smoke flavor, and mixing the Hot &amp; KC BBQ sauce on this was pretty good. I haven&#39;t had Champps&#39;s ribs in a long time, but they were my favorite ribs in Chicago, although that isn&#39;t saying much. Chicago&#39;s BBQ scene is pretty grim, and even though Champp&#39;s was no Kansas City, it was consistently pretty decent. Well, Champps is gone now, so it may be a toss up between these and Chili&#39;s ribs (which I haven&#39;t had in probably 7 years or so).

PULLED PORK
Nope. Not quite Sahara desert dry, but maybe California drought dry. Didn&#39;t have any real good pork flavor either. However, it was edible, and that means I could put BBQ sauces on them and eat them! If you like pulled pork, no need to disappoint yourself here.

BEEF BRISKET
Definitely smokey, but also pretty dry. The sauce makes it edible, but still not great. Not worth it.

SMOKED CHICKEN
Again, dry, but not as dry as the pulled pork or brisket. This one actually can taste decent with the BBQ sauce. Nothing special though. I&#39;d rather have the BBQ sauces here with Boston Market chicken...or hell...Costco rotisserie chicken.

FRIED OYSTERS
I&#39;m more of a raw oyster fan, but this wasn&#39;t too bad. For something that was just deep fried, though, it came out a little lukewarm. You get cocktail sauce and a cherry pepper tartar sauce, which was really good. That tartar sauce had a small kick to it that was very welcome too, and I found myself using that sauce for other things, like the cornbread and chips!

KICKIN CREOLE SHRIMP
Again, came out lukewarm. Jumbo shrimp with a lot of cajun spices and garlic. This was pretty decent, but the lukewarmness was killing it. Also, I could taste the creole, I could taste the garlic, but this &#34;creole butter&#34; was nowhere to be found. The flavor I was most hoping to see was butter, but oh well. And if you&#39;re wondering, NO, this is not Boiling Crab. You get like 6-8 pieces of shrimp on a plate with sauce.

CRAB LEGS
Not bad. I love crab legs, and other than being warm, these were just par for the course.

CRAP/SHRIMP/ARTICHOKE DIP
Again, came out lukewarm. It was pretty cheesy, and sure, it contained all 3 ingredients in there, but something about it was just not exciting at all. After my first chip, I was bored of it. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it wasn&#39;t bad, but nothing really popped out. Flavors weren&#39;t really complimenting eachother, and sort of fused into something blah. The whole was somehow less that the sum of the parts.

SKILLET CORNBREAD
For something served on a small iron skillet, this was also lukewarm. You&#39;d expect, &#34;don&#39;t touch the skillet, it&#39;s hot!&#34; but nope, lukewarm. This is just cornbread, but it does have a light jalapeno spice baked in. Didn&#39;t really help for me.


BORE-N-QUE
I honestly wanted to give this place 2 stars, but the points just didn&#39;t add up that way. A place that&#39;s named &#34;Crab-N-Que&#34; is dying to have some kind of fusion between seafood and bbq, but there is NOTHING of the sort here! In fact, they don&#39;t even have combinations that include both BBQ and seafood! Not only do they have an identity crisis on their menu, their restaurant layout is also just as ambiguous. The bar is huge, and is the centerpiece of the place. It&#39;s too much restaurant to be labeled a bar, but it&#39;s also too much bar to be labeled a restaurant. It&#39;s basically like an Applebee&#39;s, but with a bigger bar.

Bottom line, I don&#39;t have any desire to come back. If I was with a group that wanted to go, I wouldn&#39;t start a fight, but I probably would suggest a different place.",22/11/15,628,3,1,5,8,6.470999999999998,7.407,4.7589999999999995,48.831,No,4979

sweet-carolines-crab-n-que-hoffman-estates,Robby W.,QC_g-og4viJ9gjK2pjJteg,Yp1ibvWCuFmAuhDgQ2Y0zA,"It seems like any type of ethnic cuisine out there attempts some type of trendy &#34;fusion&#34; in an effort to differentiate themselves from the masses. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it is an epic fail. In the case of Sweet Caroline&#39;s it comes pretty close to hitting the center of the bullseye. I drove by this place literally everyday for months after it first opened without stopping in, which is lame in and of itself. I should have my elite badge stripped. 

We stopped in on a Friday night, which is admittedly about the worst possible time to try out a restaurant. At 5:15 it was already pretty busy, but we ended up getting seated within about 7-8 min, so not complaints there. The drink menu here heavily favors whiskey and the list they have available is extensive. Tennessee, Kentucky, Scotch, Irish, etc. varieties are all here, so I just had to play along and get a Basil Hayden neat. They have numerous signature cocktails that incorporate whiskey and bourbon also, which my guests were guzzling down like they had just walked across the Sahara (guess who was picking up the check?). For my second round I went with a Henry&#39;s Hard Ginger Ale, which is fantastic, and something you should try if you haven&#39;t before. 

We ordered a couple of appetizers while we were waiting for a few more people to join our party. Both were quite delicious, but a definite tip of the hat to the crab and shrimp artichoke dip. This is an appetizer that half the restaurants on the planet do a rendition of, but the variation here REALLY stands out. It&#39;s got a spicy flavor profile and plenty of texture. Delicious! I am glad it was sitting on my end of the table. The crab cakes were also good, but if you have ever been to Maryland you are not going to be overly impressed. The people with me obviously did not share my view. I was lucky to get one small bite before they devoured it all. No matter, I had my artichoke dip and whiskey to keep me company. 

I went with the King Crab and BBQ combo for an entree, which is pretty much this restaurant&#39;s version of &#34;surf n turf&#34;. For the midwest, the crab legs were quite delicious and fresh. I managed to get some drawn butter down the front of my favorite tie in the process of eating them, but this was acceptable collateral damage considering how good they were. What really impressed me most was the BBQ. Beings that I am originally from Kansas City where BBQ is king, and that I smoke my own meats at home frequently, my standards are pretty high. That being said, even aficionados will likely be impressed with the offerings here. The brisket, ribs and chicken were all smoked extremely well. The meat was tender, succulent, and not the least bit dry or overly seasoned. Whoever this place hired to run their pit obviously knows what the hell they are doing, which is more than I can say for 95% of the supposed BBQ places in the Chicago area. My only complaint was the andouille, which was not on par with the rest. My suggestion? Decrease the temperature in the pit and raise the sausage up a bit from the heat source with a grate. Or maybe use a rotisserie set up. Sausage is tough to get right, but this complaint is minor. 

The ambiance of this place is like most BBQ joints, meaning blue collar with a penchant for country music and all things rustic. It honestly has the all the outward appearances of being a chain, though this is not the case. The music they had on stage was actually much better than I would of expected. It was a Bluegrass act that was surprisingly melodic for a band hired to play a gig at a restaurant. This provided a fun backdrop for some really good food and conversation. 

Our server was extremely efficient, and provided everything we needed quickly, but almost checked on us too much. I always appreciate great service, and I tip accordingly, but there is often a fine line between good service and hovering over someone who is trying to enjoy their evening. This was also minor, as I would take a sever like her any day of the week over one that takes my order and disappears. 

If you have not tried this place yet, I would give it a shot if I were you. This is a fusion concept that actually works.",06/05/16,451,4,1,5,-6,10.7113,6.941,1.873,37.187,No,4231

It&#39;s hard to tell if it&#39;s due to it being opening night or if they&#39;re going to be like this all the time.  First off, the server seemed like he was still trying to figure out how and what to prioritize, which is understandable in a new environment.  I ordered a drink when he first came around and didn&#39;t receive it until after we ordered our food 10 minutes later.  
We ordered the mussels and the cajun shrimp.  The food wasn&#39;t too bad, but there was nothing special about it at all.  The shrimp came in a plate of juices that was just too thin to coat the shrimp, which made the shrimp taste like...just shrimp.  The mussels were a bit better, but there was still room for improvement in the flavor department.

Waited for 5 minutes to be seated for a group of 8. There was live music and if you have time to see Mixed Duo, they were great. I thought coming in it was piped in music I was listening to and lo and behold, there they were on the stage. They sounded wonderful.
Even though we were seated just a few feet from the stage, we were able to have conversations among the group.
I had the half smoked chicken which I was able to take home with brown rice and coleslaw. We shared appetizers of calamari, smoked chicken wings, crab and shrimp artichoke dip. among those three, the calamari and artichoke dip are something that I would come back for.

I did not try the seafood here. Ordered the 3 BBQ platter that consisted of dry rub ribs, 1/4 chicken and sausage. The ribs were nice and tender and I enjoyed dipping them in the hot and spicy BBQ sauce. The sauce had nice heat. Chicken was juicy and the sausage had a nice spicy flavor.

For sides had the spicy caesar salad and mac and cheese. The salad did have a kick to it and the lettuce was nice and crisp. Dressing was basic caesar taste. The mac and cheese was just ok. It was noodles in a cheese sauce. It was not baked with bread crumbs or came in a hot pan.

Also ordered some loaded fries. The fries were wedges that were quite crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside. toppings were good.

Atmosphere was nice although the music was played very loud. Inside they had live music which was great but my group wanted to be able to hear ourselves talk. We ended up sitting outside but the speakers were still blaring the music from the inside.

Service was excellent. Our waitress got us refills in a timely manner and bought us everything that we needed.",05/08/16,135,4,3,5,59,6.0192,4.069,0.0,15.930999999999997,No,1179

The menu is a strange combo of seafood and western BBQ. Caroline&#39;s features a long list of draft beers.

The place is very very busy and noisy. There are 20 video screens with different programs running. The decor and the menu are a blaze of different images, colors, shapes. Items of decor hanging all over include fishing/crabbing implements and western items in a random mix. Entertainment 3 days/week is 50&#39;s, some blues, country or folk.

Ordered corn bread- very ver good: moist, with a little sweetness and jalape̱os flavor, don&#39;t forget the butter!!!  We had a group of 6, most people ordered lobster bisque soup and really liked it. As a main dish, we had ribs, shrimps, and fish of the day - walleye. Everyone enjoyed their dish.

Started with the cornbread skillet and was provided a couple of rolls. The rolls were swimming in butter sauce with garlic. Overkill on the butter when it is dripping and running down into your hand. I had the brisket dinner which had a decent smokey flavor but it coated in an extremely salty rub. Couldn&#39;t eat more than a couple pieces. Husband had ribs which had good flavor.

sweet-carolines-crab-n-que-hoffman-estates,Jennifer S.,mYvZwQ3T5JzqwOyURQWA_w,V1zK-HnRQ9U7oltTs_jYBg,"My husband and I are no longer big New Year&#39;s Eve people. We were back in the day, but after a while, we decided we would rather be comfortable at home. Yesterday, my office closed early which was a treat, but NYE had kinda just shown up this year and we weren&#39;t prepared with plans of any sort. I&#39;ve been wanting to try Sweet Caroline&#39;s from the moment I heard about them. We took the early, non-crowded opportunity and ran with it. 

The first thing we noticed was the large bar. It&#39;s huge and takes up a lot of the restaurant. There are TVs all over the place, so it&#39;s hard to miss the game here. The designers must have taken quite a while to pull together all of the interesting decor. You could look at this for a long time without getting bored. 

Our server was sweet, but she wasn&#39;t overly excited to be there. We noticed that the table next to us who were seated after us, had bread immediately with their drinks and their server was practically Prince Charming. Our bread came out ten minutes after theirs. I wish our meal had been spaced out better. We were there around 3:45pm...long before the rush.  

I wanted the crab cakes and the hubby wanted the chili to start. The crab cakes were actually a crab cake. It was a very good crab cake and the remoulade sauce was tasty. It was an $11 appetizer and I&#39;m not sure that I felt it should have been an $11 appetizer in the suburbs. Don&#39;t laugh at me because I know this will sound ridiculous, but if they had taken the same amount of crab cakes mixture and made it into two cakes, I may have felt like I had gotten my money&#39;s worth on that one. Just my two cents. I told you it sounded crazy... The husband&#39;s chili was good, but not what he expected. It was more like a soup with a lot of beans and some chunks of meat. He likes beans, but said it was too many beans for him. 

I went with a NYE special with filet mignon and two crab stuffed prawns. I subbed out the rice and veggies for herb roasted potatoes. He chose a two meat combo with ribs and beef brisket, baked beans and ranch fries. The filet was perfectly cooked, seasoned appropriately and so tender!  The prawns were dressed in a nice buttery sauce, but the cornbread/sausage/crab stuffing was minimal. My potatoes were very good. The filet was definitely the highlight for me. My husband was annoyed by the presentation. His dinner came on a metal tray which was fine, but the beans were in a separate container on the tray (and it wasn&#39;t full...choose a different serving dish if you&#39;re only going to fill it halfway please) and the brisket was on another plate sorta thing on the tray. They had poured meat juices over the brisket, so you couldn&#39;t transfer the ribs to the plate or the brisket to the tray without making a mess. He used his appetizer plate to try the three sauces that were all too similar to appreciate the differences. They weren&#39;t bad...they just weren&#39;t distinctly different. 

While it wasn&#39;t the perfect meal, it was good and we would like to go back on a random regular night to see how that goes.",01/01/16,332,3,1,5,5,7.677100000000001,4.773000000000001,1.2,31.027000000000008,No,3119

We went for dinner on Saturday night. They are not on OpenTable nor do they have an online reservations system but I called was able to make a reservation for 8. We arrived about 15 minutes early and the lovely hostess (Katie) advised us that they were running about 30 mins behind.  No problem. We found space at the bar and ordered a drink.   My bf had the blackberry bourbon smash and really enjoyed it. I simply had water at the bar. After approximately 30 mins we checked back in with the hostess, still no table.  The restaurant has maybe a dozen various sized high top tables surrounding the bar and then maybe two dozen low tops between the bar and the stage. A large cluster of those are close together and right in front of the stage and it was very loud. We opted to wait for a better spot.
Once we were finally seated, our server  (Maria) greeted us with a smile and an apology. She was delightful. Before we could order, she informed us that they were out of ribs. What!!?? How is a BBQ joint out of ribs. That was the sole reason I went there. I openly pouted. 
We ordered the skillet cornbread - just ok. The fried oysters - AMAZING!  Perfectly coated,  seasoned and fried.. just yum 
We also got the shrimp appetizer (can&#39;t remember what it was called ) but it was basically saut̩ed shrimp in a shooter with a spicy corn relish. It was really good. 
For my entree, I got the pick 2 with brisket and pulled pork. Just ok. The baked beans were great.  The mac and cheese was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. Worse than Kraft 
I also had a mai Tai.  It was,pretty good but keep the cheap plastic &#34;souvenir &#34; cup. 
My bf got 1lb king crab legs. They were big and meaty although not served as warm as he would&#39;ve liked. His mashed potatoes and Cole slaw were hits. 
We wanted to try the bacon donuts but couldn&#39;t force more food down. 
The manager did come by to greet us and we expressed our disappointment at the absence of ribs to which he replied that we may need to come earlier.  They cook the ribs 16 hours so cook for the day and when they run out, they run out. I understand but I don&#39;t understand.  
At any rate, the people there are awesome. The food has its highs and lows. They need to figure out how to plan better for food quantities and based on the fact that there is live music (that is pretty good ) they should expect people to diddle a bit which makes seating a challenge.  
Will I go back?  Yes,  I likely will and they better have some darn ribs!!",09/02/16,300,3,1,5,-31,6.4932,5.239,2.302,30.46,No,2596

The coleslaw was a bit peppery, but VERY tasty.

My only complaint is the wasted space of a stage. They had two people singing to tracks of music up on this huge stage.  It was LOUD.  If it was a band it would have been different but this to me was a glorified karaoke with the same two people singing over and over again.

That&#39;s Sweet Carolines. While the name gives you the impression that it&#39;s a restaurant, as soon as you walk in you find that the bar and pub tables take up over half the space. And the video gambling takes up another section. Given the history of the owners, (Fred Hoffman - Snuggery) it&#39;s not a surprise. Arrived about 6:30 on a Saturday (about a week after the grand opening) and the wait was 45 minutes. We found that some groups walked right in and got a table without waiting. The manager seemed to recognize each group so maybe that got them faster service. Our waiter arrived and apologized for the wait - &#34;It&#39;s crazy tonight&#34;. If a full restaurant is &#39;crazy&#39;, that&#39;s a problem. Maybe this was just the staff getting into a rhythm as part of the recent opening. We weren&#39;t offered drinks or any details about the listed specials. We just got the &#34;Are you ready to order?&#34; The music and crowd noise is very loud. And the obligatory Neil Diamond Sweet Caroline was turned up even louder (more bar clues). The families with small children looked a little out of place. The food was ok but kind of spotty. The brisket, while juicy, lacked any smoke flavor and showed no smoke ring. The pulled pork was pretty good but had too much fat for my taste. The sausage had a strange off taste. The cornbread was more cinnamon bread. The beans, however, were very tasty. The sauces on the table were also pretty good. So there were some hits. We noticed the dueling piano players setting up (another bar clue) but we left before they started. The decor is mostly old signs, cans, etc but gave it a good BBQ joint feel. When we left about 8:30 the bar was about half full and we saw no one waiting for a table.

I think this concept would work better in an entertainment area like Navy Pier, or around a hotel area like Rosemont, but this area only has other restaurants so it really doesn&#39;t seem to draw a bar crowd. This area has seen some big names fail like TGI Friday&#39;s, Lone Star, and Max and Erma&#39;s so if they don&#39;t concentrate on the restaurant operations they will have a hard time making it.",16/11/15,265,2,1,3,-1,2.6711,2.959,1.422,24.619,No,2286

Then of course it being a BBQ place had to try the Brisket....it melts in your mouth and with the 3 different BBQ sauces made it even better but save room for the cornbread. The corn bread was fantastic with the maple butter, it totally complimented the Brisket. Ordered the Bacon Maple Glazed donuts for dessert....I highly recommend it...salty and sweet.... and they have my favorite burbon...BULLIET neat was the perfect ending to the meal.

After dinner went to the bar to have a few more drinks, Bartenders were very friendly and I like the fact they have Live entertainment and a Late night DJ.

I was so surprised by this place the first time I went. We tried a bunch of things and loved them all!!! We have come back a few times, even with other friends and they all loved what they had too.

sweet-carolines-crab-n-que-hoffman-estates,Elvira G.,K-rcqMtV9NgP_diWLfVdYw,L_hMXFf0AgJM5E673oryfw,"For my birthday, we went to check out Sweet Caroline&#39;s. There were three of us.

We ordered the BBQ Feast which serves four (but, it could actually serve five or maybe even six). The feast has four meats (brisket, chicken, ribs and pulled pork), potatoes, coleslaw, beans and cornbread. Had lots of leftovers to take home. The next day, my son took some for lunch and we actually still had enough meats for a few more meals at home. The meal overall was really good.

The three sauces they have are OK, nothing spectacular. I like a vinegary kind of sauce. Of their three, none of them were like that. In the end, they do the job.

OMG!!!! That skillet cornbread!!!! It is (for me), honestly the BEST cornbread I have ever had!! I&#39;m in love with that cornbread. Next time, we&#39;ll order two! LOL

The only thing I didn&#39;t care for is the cilantro in the coleslaw. Other than that, it&#39;s decent. An idea, they should give you a choice of with or without it. BLAH!!

The waiter was great and, the chef came out and talked to us (and even sat down). I asked about the cornbread and jokingly asked if they had any extra. Because it was my birthday, he gave me one to take home on the house (along with some of their honey &amp; maple butter). So nice!!

This place is a tad on the pricey side but overall, it&#39;s good! I will go back again. It&#39;s closer to me than Famous Dave&#39;s.",01/12/15,187,4,3,5,54,5.059399999999999,3.834,1.16,22.005999999999997,No,1400

So on my Birthday today decided to check out Sweet Caroline&#39;s Crab-N-Que that was close to home.
I had the smoked BBQ quarter chicken with their ranch fries (which look like potatoes sliced like potato chips and baked) and their mayo spicy coleslaw with the complimentary garlic rolls. They also had the option of the vinegar based coleslaw. 
I also liked that on their table they had squeeze bottles of their Hot and Spicy BBQ sauce, Kansas City Sweet BBQ sauce and their Tangy BBQ sauce. I sampled the sweet BBQ sauce and tangy BBQ sauce and decided to go with the sweet BBQ sauce since it was more rich than the tangy BBQ sauce.
I&#39;m happy to say I walked away feeling very full and satisfied. Service was good, and the atmosphere looks like they&#39;re trying to model themselves after a Southern BBQ place. 
Keep in mind they currently don&#39;t do lunch service (they open at 3PM) probably because of their process of cooking their ribs (very slowly over hours) it&#39;s not practical to have a lunch service right now.",08/06/16,133,5,2,5,30,4.7745,1.787,0.0,7.213000000000001,No,1146

It was cute--huge bar--they tried to keep it classy and kitchy at the same time--think South style chilis type of place. The staff was great - we had a very nice server with honest recommendations. We had their mixed platter where you can basically try several things and a couple sides. Food was good and the server described the cooking process of so many hours. Ribs were maybe the notable item and maybe the brisket. I think we also had fried gator which was ok. Succotash was just mixed veggies- no outstanding spice. The only disappointment was the sauces. A Southern themed restaurant with &#39;meh&#39; barbeque sauces just doesn&#39;t impress.  Now this may be personal preference but they all tasted pretty much the same and nothing I would run out and buy the bottle for. A bit over priced.

We also tried a shrimp po&#39; boy. The shrimp were cut in half lengthwise (I guess so they don&#39;t have to give as many) and it was doused in a very spicy sauce. I&#39;m not afraid of flavor, but not at the expense of overdoing it with heat. The drinks were so-so. Tasted like they were pre mixed and very easy on the alcohol.
The service was just ok. The wait staff seemed confused about table assignment. Once our server found us, she was efficient but didn&#39;t make any suggestions.

the-still-bar-and-grill-bartlett,Jeff L.,9a-bM7vwfXr3ESXgHLV9kg,5p9GZCJ3FGWN6-SZ-3rdJw,Ate here on a Saturday night Labor Day weekend. Interwove was very nice and the service was very good. Nice assortment of moonshine drinks and barbecue. I ordered the half slab of ribs and brisket and really enjoyed both. I did not need a fork at all! Loved the sauce as well. The green beans were fantastic and the fresh cornbread was warm and and moist. My wife had the broasted chicken which was a lot of food for the price.

In terms of the food, we ordered a variety, and the best things we had were the broasted chicken and the sweet potato fries (which were waffle fries - so they were already better in my book).  

&#34;I heard it from a friend who, heard if from a friend who ...&#34; said this place had some good BBQ.  Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t.  Nothing looked or tasted like it was smoked and all the meat was covered in so much sauce that I couldn&#39;t taste anything other than the sauce.  Mind you, the BBQ sauce was pretty good, but there was way more than I wanted, or expected.  I&#39;d like to say the meat without the sauce was good, but my wife ordered the pulled pork without any sauce and it was so plain that even she didn&#39;t like it (she orders everything plain).  If you decide to go, here&#39;s how we&#39;d rate the food:

Broasted Chicken - 4
Sweet potato fries - 3.5
Cornbread - 3.5 - sweet and moist
Fries - 3.5 - surprisingly crunchy in a good way
Ribs - 3 - tender but not smoked 
Pulled pork - 3 - flavorless

I love classic and outlaw country. I love BBQ. Combine these two and I&#39;m in love. Put it in Bartlett?? I feel like there&#39;s hope in my world. 

Food is good. Beer is good with a descent selection (Lagunitas and Hamm&#39;s in the same cooler). I finally got to hang in the bar after dragging the family here a couple times and loved it. The soundtrack is the best part. I want to put live music in here and it would be perfect...but I doubt that will happen. My only complaint (and this is of most places I frequent) is the need to fill the dining area with flat screens). If you&#39;re a sports bar I get it. If you&#39;re playing Wheel of Fortune it feels cheep and distracting and I&#39;d rather enjoy the moment that I escape to the sounds of real country music and smoked meat.

the-still-bar-and-grill-bartlett,Jennifer S.,mYvZwQ3T5JzqwOyURQWA_w,p44LYndnthU9H1yyyVM_Bg,"We all liked it well enough the first time on Monday that two of us decided to come back on Friday of the same week. Bartlett desperately needs some decent table service dinner options. Unfortunately, The Still has now proved we are going to have to keep waiting and leave our quant little town for dinner unless we want take out pizza, Chinese or tacos. 

Dinner on Monday was in an almost empty restaurant with attentive service, good ribs, great mashed potatoes, fresh cornbread, hand battered fried green beans and nice chicken. We learned a lot during this visit. Everyone agreed that although we didn&#39;t love everything that the service and the food were good enough to warrant another visit soon. 

At 8:15 on Friday evening, it was well past the busy dinner hour and so we headed back. Promptly greeted and seated, we sat down and waited. They were busier and ultimately seemed confused. My husband said things like: Are they trying to run the customers out of here?  A large group walked in and moved tables and chairs around to accommodate themselves. Then another mid-sized group walked in and asked for a table but was told the wait would be an hour. What?!?!  The staff should have moved a table and a couple chairs just like their other patrons had just done to welcome their guests. Nope. They just let them walk right out the door. They were there to drink at almost nine o&#39;clock on a Friday night?  It doesn&#39;t take a business degree to know that was a bad business move. 

After finally placing our order and anxiously awaiting our meals, the food was wrong. My burger was covered in cheese - I did not order cheese, so I sent it back. The same burger arrived back in front of me a few short minutes later with the cheese peeled off and now cooked to death. Yuck!  Why ask how I want it cooked if you are going to ruin it anyhow?  Well, at least the yummy mashed potatoes are still here. Um...Nevermind. These potatoes tasted so old, I truly thought they could have been the leftovers from Monday!  

I sent the whole thing back. It was after nine and I was just done. No one wanted to refill my drink. It was a complete disappointment after Monday being decent. I figured the owner would swing by and extend an apology and some indication that he wanted us to try them again. Nope. He&#39;s very busy knocking back cocktails at the end of the bar. And I don&#39;t know who the sullen woman is that walks back and forth without saying a word to the customers and only snapping at the staff, but she could use some sunshine in her day. I hope she cheers up soon before there aren&#39;t any customers to scowl at. 

As for the space, some of my favorite restaurants are in strip malls, so I wouldn&#39;t allow that to be a deterrent. 

Maybe it was an off night. But it was too far off for me to give them anymore of my hard earned money.",26/08/14,323,3,3,2,72,1.9447999999999992,2.9090000000000007,2.5140000000000002,32.57799999999999,No,2864

The first sign we noticed upon entering, there was no smoke smell. Any good smoke BBQ restaurant you walk into, you walk out of smelling like smoke. I feel bad that I actually took my wife here for our anniversary, instead of making the hour trip to Smoque BBQ in Chicago. Their brisket tasted like a pot roast. No rings and none of that delicious charred ends. The pulled pork and sausage had no smoke flavor either. You can tell a good smoked sausage when it has that initial snap, when you first bite into it. The sausage tasted like it&#39;s been in a crockpot all day. All these meats were overwhelmed with BBQ sauce, in order to mask that crockpot taste. Sad to say, I was told about this place from a friend.

The syrup was obviously that fake artificial corn syrup crap.  We make this better at home. I tried my husband&#39;s fries and they were so unappetizing and plain.

the-still-bar-and-grill-bartlett,Paul F.,YEBdTOCw846q1o8BoNvf6A,5dx2QaHom-xUDVoARJWQ0A,"Where to start?

Recently brought my family here.  We are bbq fanatics, and as I travel a lot, often hit local places.  While there is potential here, mainly due what seems a lot of hard work happening, they have a long LONG way to go.

First, the service - As I mention, I travel for work, and so, eat out often every week, so have what I feel is a good understanding on how long it should take from the time I sit down, til the time food is coming.  Service was extremely slow here, and not on an overly busy night, but I also watched my server constantly on the run.  Watching further, I had a dilemma, as I could tell he was working hard, but between being improperly staffed and the inefficient setup, he was doomed from the start.  We had a view to the kitchen, and it seemed the same.  But waiting for 15 minutes to get our drinks and 30 for our appetizers, and nearly an hour for our dinner for a table of 3, I wasn&#39;t impressed.

Now on to the food - first off, using the same batter for every item, including the chicken &amp; waffles, just got to be overload.  The waffles were like hockey pucks and overall that dish was lackluster.

The pulled pork was very disappointing, no smoke flavor whatsoever.

As for the brisket, it was very dry, very little smoke ring, and Luke warm.  It made me wonder if anything is actually smoked, or just cooked in an oven with a makeshift pan smoker.

On to the sauces, None of us were pleased with any of the tastes.  I&#39;m not quite sure what they&#39;ve done, but one tasted a bit acidic even.

Overall, none of were greatly impressed, which is a shame, as we really wanted to be.  It&#39;s debatable if we&#39;ll go back, if they last, I&#39;ll probably give it another try,  but for that time, I&#39;ll go alone before spending a good chunk of change taking the family.

I&#39;m hopeful, they&#39;ll sort out things, as, like I said, I could see a lot of hard work going on, it just hadn&#39;t delivered results as of yet.",24/01/16,233,1,1,0,-20,-0.12350000000000061,1.039,1.369,16.592,No,1978

This was my first time here so I don&#39;t have much to go on but my first impressions.  The food and drinks were pretty good.  The only thing that is stopping me from giving it 5 stars is a couple of &#34;logistical&#34; things.  First, specials listed on the board said &#34;St Patrick&#39;s Specials&#34;. This led me to believe that it was for just that day but for the weekend and Monday leading up to.  Not the case.  They might want to note that it is only for that day.  

The next is the description on the menu of some items.  I got the Catfish.  Let me say, it was good.  And the sweet potato waffle fries and green beans were good too.  However, the menu gave a choice of Seasoned and Grilled or BATTERED and fried.  What ended up coming to the table was breaded.  It was good regardless but I was expecting Battered.  

Lastly, I was thinking about taking a bit of dessert home.  On the board they had Key Lime Pie, cheesecake and a couple other items.  I mentioned the Key Lime Pie (my wife had brought me home a piece a couple weeks ago and it was delicious.  I am told they make their desserts in house).  The server said that was the one thing I couldn&#39;t get.  They didn&#39;t make any that day.  I guess it goes back to if you&#39;re going to put something on your &#34;specials&#34; board, make sure its available.

I should have known it wasn&#39;t going to be barbeque by the fact that there was no smoke anywhere when we were walking up.  The dining room was awkward and the booths seemed a little cramped.  There was almost too much light in the dining room.  Service was okay.  The beer list could have been larger.  

I ordered the Hillbilly Surf and Turf.  This is when I knew I wouldn&#39;t be coming back.  The brisket came out and right away you can tell it was not smoked.  There was no smoke ring, which should be very apparent in a meat that takes hours and hours to barbeque.  It had the shimmery glimmer that I remember seeing on roast beef when I worked at a hospital cafeteria in high school.  The catfish was okay.  It was deep fried, but not really seasoned.  Adding some Tony Chacere&#39;s or some other spice blend would go a long way.

Places like this should really call their food what it is and not throw a BBQ label on it.  I had high hopes for this place, but it is another place pitching a poor attempt at BBQ/Southern food.  There are much better places to go in the third largest metropolitan area in the U.S. than The Still.",19/11/14,126,2,2,1,17,0.7246,1.6070000000000002,0.535,14.858,No,1206

So far away from Bar B Que, that you may as well be ordering szechuan from an Italian joint! Throwing store bought BBQ sauce onto over processed GFS type meat, is hardly what should be labeled &#39;Star Studded&#39;. 

Both of the meals ordered on the occasion of our visit ( the smokey mountain combo and the smoked brisket ) were so over cooked and leathery, we did not attempt to complete the meal. When our server came to clear the plates in front of us, seeing the majority of the food still on the dishes, they avoided eye contact and swooped away like hawks after road-kill ( which is pretty much what we were served).

the-still-bar-and-grill-bartlett,Tom S.,VGwBUQHycvJNhFFO_Y1PQQ,mKNnd1uLNTGMkqxtyUqYRA,"Review from 2014....I think (hope) this place is a work in progress. My wife and I went in for drinks on a Saturday night just to see what the place was like. Decent prices for their drink specials which is always nice. We looked at the menu to get an idea of what they served. I found lots of things I plan on trying. We had just eaten so it wouldn&#39;t be that night. 

A few thoughts for the owner if they are reading. 1) The bartender working that night was nice but not very engaging. She had minimal interaction with any of the customers. 2) There was a sign out in front of the restaurant that said that there was a sangria special. A group came in and a few asked for the sangria only to be told they were out of it. If you are out, take it off the sign! 3) The wood trim in the bar (that&#39;s the only part we saw) looks great but having a plain, colored cement floor just looks tacky. Maybe a wood floor? Even a fake one would look better than what is there. 

I really want this place to succeed because I&#39;m a fan of BBQ.

1/8/16 - Service is terrible. It took 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out. Even longer for the main course. The excuse was there were a lot of take-out orders ahead of ours. Here&#39;s a hint, Mr. Owner. Take care of the people in the building. You can tell the people on the phone it will be an hour for pickup and they would be fine. If you told me it would be an hour when I came in, I would have left.  Take my comments for what it is worth but I won&#39;t be going back. Besides, the food wasn&#39;t that good.",20/07/14,168,1,2,3,19,2.4783,2.249,1.249,22.502,No,1560

the-still-bar-and-grill-bartlett,Stephanie G.,7d6m_7hEr7xKG5V6Kbm2gg,oOHhec02wJWpVFEBxqVDfQ,"Warning, this may be long! :) Yesterday was my third Sunday in a row visiting The Still. My boyfriend plays on a softball team and after the games some of us will go out for dinner. We thought The Still was our new place. I want this review to be as fair as possible, as I really love small local businesses and that&#39;s why we were so excited about The Still in the first place. That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving them 3 stars instead of letting my feelings get the best of me and giving 1 star. 

Our first visit was great. We all enjoyed our meals, had great service and tried a few fun drinks. I asked about a drink menu and was told they were working on one. Our second visit was okay as well. Our waitress was less informed and pretty shy this time. They still didn&#39;t have a drink menu and she really didn&#39;t have any drink suggestions for us. The food was still good. We really liked the fried pickles, and the smoked sausage. I tried the broasted chicken this visit and it was just ok. The chicken itself was really tasty and juicy, but the broasted portion wasn&#39;t great. Boyfriend had the ribs and those were pretty good. 

Our third visit was yesterday. We came with a group of 12. We all ordered drinks, appetizers and meals. The first problem we noticed was how warm it was inside, I&#39;m normally freezing all the time and even I was uncomfortable. The guys in our group were all sweating. We asked about the air and was told it was on, but not working very well. No huge deal, things happen. Our sweet waitress apologized. Where things started going wrong was when our food started coming out. Entrees were brought to our party 1 at a time, and all of them a couple minutes a part. Not one of us was served at the same time. Eventually 20 minutes later everyone in my party of 12 had food. All but two people had finished their meals.  Problem was I still wasn&#39;t served mine. Nobody even acknowledged us to say &#39;I&#39;m sorry, the rest of your meals will be right up&#39;. The people in our party who did have their food felt bad eating before everyone was served. At this point I didn&#39;t even want my food anymore. It still hadn&#39;t come, everyone else was done eating and I just didn&#39;t want to sit there and eat by myself. So when the owner walked by I stopped her and let her know what was happening. I told her that we had already been there for 90 min, everyone had eaten and I still didn&#39;t have my food. I told her that I just didn&#39;t want my meal anymore. I didn&#39;t yell at her, I didn&#39;t speak rudely. I simply let her know what was happening. The response I got from her was shocking. I wasn&#39;t offered an apology of any kind. Instead I was made to feel like a jerk for even letting her know. She very sternly (that&#39;s putting it nicely) told me that the kitchen was short staffed because of the holiday weekend, they couldn&#39;t keep up, they were doing the best they could. I wish I could properly describe the inflection and tone in her statement. She walked away offering no form of an apology. I sat there shocked feeling like she expected an apology from me for visiting her restaurant on a holiday weekend, as if my patronage of her restaurant was a big inconvenience. Im not responsible for staffing her kitchen. A few minutes later she walked by our table and without even stopping she &#39;aggressively&#39; stated (I have no idea how else to explain it) that she took my drink, appetizer and my unserved meal off our tab). She didn&#39;t even stop to personally address me, just kept walking as she said it and again, no apology. My entire table of 12 was shocked. We couldn&#39;t believe how unfairly rude she was to me. Our waitress heard the way the owner spoke to us and she immediately came over and apologized to us, she seemed incredibly embarrassed. I should add that our waitress that day was great, very sweet.  

In the end, the owner handled the mistake accordingly by removing a drink and appetizer from our tab, I take that as the apology. However she did this very begrudgingly and with total disdain for myself. There was never a verbal apology. When I let her know there was an issue she immediately jumped to the defense. This is not customer service. I had even let her know that this was our third visit since they opened just a month ago. None of that seemed to matter to her. She didn&#39;t seem to appreciate the fact that we came with 12 people who could have become regular guests. When opening a new business, word of mouth is everything. Great customer service and a smile really go a long way. This all could have been resolved with a simple apology, a smile and a correction. Instead it looks like they lost our continued business. There was just no reason for things to have happened as they did.",07/07/14,508,2,4,5,119,5.510699999999999,9.149999999999997,5.653000000000001,50.197,No,4806

My biggest concern was the initial description I read touting it as a liquor-themed establishment -  not at all the kind of place Bartlett needs. It&#39;s actually very family friendly (the bar is separated from the dining area) and the focus is really on the smoked pork and other Tennessee-themed menu options.

the-still-bar-and-grill-bartlett,Ed B.,xdjQdd9aCPX-Lf0wQbukYw,_Zxl4B5fI7qU-Fq-VYJ3lg,"So I&#39;ve tried The Still twice now, and it&#39;s pretty good.  So far I&#39;ve had the brisket and the brisket sandwich, plus I&#39;ve tried the chicken, pulled pork, and chicken fingers.
The brisket was really good, not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but smoky, tasty and if you live near Bartlett, you should like it.  I tasted the chicken and pork and they were good too but I like the brisket better.
Each meat came in a different sauce and all were delicious, either having smoke, tang, or heat.  The brisket sandwich made me not hate pretzel buns and join the rest of society but it was a little fattier than just ordering the meal.  The baked beans side is just average, the cornbread is very good, and the cole slaw you&#39;re on your own...I hate coleslaw more than Mondays. The chicken fingers are fantastic!  They&#39;re juicy and delicious and the batter is not like normal batter....it&#39;s light and airy and very good.
As for the place itself.  It&#39;s kinda weird.  The decor....well, it&#39;s not good.  The place is small and looks like a cafeteria a little bit. Someone said a wood floor would change the whole place and they were right.  There&#39;s a small bar in a different room so family types won&#39;t have to put up with you lonely drinker types and vice versa.  It looks nice but I didn&#39;t try it.  By the way, don&#39;t let the term moonshine scare you.  I tried two of their speciality drinks, both of which were refreshing and not boozy tasting at all.
The staff is friendly, but there&#39;s a blond lady there who, while friendly, seems awkward around people....I think she&#39;s one of the owners. The only advice I can give them is that sometimes they are a little light on the sauce for my taste. I wish they&#39;d put some bottles of each sauce on the table so you could try them all and as much as you want.
All in all the place is a little pricey but definitely worth a try.  I know I&#39;ll be going back there more often.",06/08/14,220,4,3,5,82,5.7744,3.5380000000000003,1.508,17.955,No,1966

We went to the bar area which is very small. We stood for a while and finally a large group that had been in the seating area left...and left a huge mess. We sat in the midst of dirty glasses. No one came to pick them up. Gross. Once seated, we received our menus from the hostess but waited about another ten minutes for our waitress.

Had a Tennessee Lemonade which was very good. $7 a mason jar seemed a little bit high as it wasn&#39;t really that strong.  To each their own though, right?  Bartender was pleasant but kind of distant. she Thought I was there for take out.  Had the pulled pork sandwich. Came in like 5 minutes literally. Was pretty good, glad the bartender recommended some bbq sauce on it as it needed it. The sweet potato waffle fries weren&#39;t great though. 
Bar Atmosphere was just okay. Very small. They had two tvs. One had on shark tank the other had on Mash and Andy Griffith. Why?  Seemed to have a younger crowd there, I left early cause I was sick of watching black and white reruns.

We decided to go back tonight and had a bizarre experience, and based on other reviews I can see that this is a common theme.
We walked in and saw about 8 tables occupied, by no means a full house. We waited at the door a few minutes while trying to determine if we should take a seat. 2 waitresses walked past us but no acknowledgment, so we started walking to a table. A waitress passed and I looked at her and said &#34; sit anywhere? &#34; she ignored me like I was invisible. We sat and watched them walk back &amp; forth, trying to make eye contact, even when they served the table right next to us. It was as if they wanted to teach us a lesson for seating ourselves. Another group walked in and they were seated almost immediately, and drink orders taken. After about 10 minutes of that we walked out. I&#39;ve never walked out of a restaurant until tonight.

That was fine with us . We were the only customers in the bar . There was no bartender to be seen. After approximately 10 minutes a woman did come into the bar, stood right in front of us, did not greet us, made several drinks and left the bar. Another group came into the bar and still no bartender. At about 15 minutes we were told  by another staff person that our table would be ready soon. My husband asked if we could order a drink and the server said.&#34;Oh I&#39;ll find the barteender&#34;. Finally the women who had previously made drinks behind the bar came in and took my husbands order.  We were seated.  When the waitress came to our table I asked to see a drink menu. She said they did not have one yet and &#34;we are  working on it&#34;. When I asked what their speciality drink was, she said &#34;one made with our moonshine&#34;. I asked what was in it. She told me &#34;moonshine, lemonaide and Amaretto&#34;  I said  I didn&#39;t like Amaretto. She never mentioned any other drinks so I just ordered water. I ordered the surf and turf which was catfish and brisket, my husband ordered the smoked turkey sandwich.  He said the turkey was good. My brisket was very tough, some bites so tough I couldn&#39;t even chew them. My catfish was bland and nothing special. My side of coleslaw was very small, about 2 tablespoons. They gave me more tarter sauce than coleslaw. The slaw was bland. The side of baked beans was good as well as the sweet potato fries. 
While we were eating multiple groups came it. Some were greeted by a staff person, others looked around for a hostess, saw none and seated themselves. One couple who had been waiting awhile for a hostess, finally seated themselves at one of the 2 empty tables. They were told by the bartender lady they couldn&#39;t sit there because another couple had been there ahead of them. They said no, that they had been there first, which they had.  The bartender woman didn&#39;t appear to believe them. They left the restaurant.

Big piece of fish with a dense, hard batter.  If you like the light and fluffy batter, this is not for you.  (Maybe our fish was twice fried?)  Excellent 5 star cole slaw.  Fries were ok.  I opted for chips.  Not home made.  Deluxe side set up of lettuce, tomato and onion.   Awesome tarter sauce.

He recommended drinks for us based on what we were ordering, helped me choose which flavor profiles would taste better in my cocktails, and was generally pleasant to speak with.

However, my man got hungry and ordered the wings (I believe they were slathered with some kind of sauce -- I was too imbibed to give a damn about food at that point.)

As we stood awkwardly by the front door (there&#39;s really no place to wait without feeling like you are right on top of the hostess station, or staring down the other diners), we looked at the long empty table that had a family of 4 at one end and the rest was empty. I&#39;m not sure why they didn&#39;t seat anyone else there. They could have easily sat another 2 parties with plenty of space in between. But .... we waited. Awkwardly.

I have to say, I was moments from walking out. My first impression was not a good one.

But I hung in there.

I had the tacos which were amazing. Absolutely delicious. I loved them. My daughter had a Caesar salad with steak, which she really enjoyed. My son ordered some sort of burger -- and was pleased. I forget what my husband ordered - but I believe he was happy with what he had.

Overall, I was glad I waited. The tacos were pretty yummy.

As for going back -- I might. Just for the tacos. But honestly -- they need to redesign the place or something.

Besides that above, I don&#39;t have complaints. The service was pretty good. Especially being busy on a Friday night. Everyone in my party ordered something different. I got the spicy burger, others ordered the Mac and cheese and the shrimp po&#39; boy. 

The burger was good. Dry. But good. I&#39;ve had better burgers from five guys. But the flavors were there. The house cut fries were a bit soggy. I prefer crunchy fries. 

The Mac and cheese was incredible! Cheesy and just delicious. 

The shrimp po&#39; boy was really good. Seasonings were spot on.

The calamari, Chicago egg rolls, burgers, and beef poutine are fantastic. Like stuff your mouth until you feel so full you feel sick good. Except the truffle fries. They weren&#39;t crispy, a bit disappointing. Up until our last order, service was consistently excellent &amp; food spectacular. 

They lost a star. We ordered take out &amp; although I requested ranch, confirmed it at pick up, and the hostess ringing me up read back my order when I paid, we didn&#39;t receive any ranch. What I though was ranch turned out to be pungent horseradish sauce. Like so pungent it burned my eyes &amp; nose and I started gagging &amp; almost lost my stomach. Had I known it was horseradish, I wouldn&#39;t have doused my food in it. First mistake. The second &amp; biggest was serving us bad meat. The Chicago egg rolls which I so love were full rancid. We discovered it was the italian beef inside that literally tasted rotten. We couldn&#39;t eat our takeout. I really hope it was a fluke night, but I was incredibly dissatisfied &amp; let down during our last experience. I struggled with how many stars to dock.

woods-creek-tavern-lake-in-the-hills,Ro S.,JLwR4HShCaJ1e8FG1D1NCw,cJO1aGmkRbvsef4NUpeGrg,"Pros:  Excellent food and unique craft beers on tap.  Definitely a beer snob paradise.  Updated interior that is definitely aesthetically pleasing.  Best burgers, Mac and cheese and Chicago egg rolls I&#39;ve had.

Cons:  No daily specials or happy hour.  How do you build your regulars like this?  
Interior needs sound dampening.  The wall reverberate the sound and may even intensify it.  Difficult to have a conversation if it is busy.  

Neither pro or con:  Seems to attempt to be more restaurant than bar.  Similar to Duke O&#39;Brien&#39;s in Crystal lake without the bar atmosphere.  The later it gets, the emptier it gets, unlike Duke&#39;s which fashions itself as more of a bar later in the evening.

It was Friday when we stopped in.  My wife had a salad with grilled steak and she loved it.  I couldn&#39;t decide on what to eat, so the GM actually had offered to prepare something for me that was not on the menu.  It was a BBQ beef brisket, on a pretzel role with pickle slices.  Does that sound good but ordinary to you?    One bite into it and I can assure you that if you love some brisket, and a mouth watering sandwich -  this is the one to get.   

Only one problem, it isn&#39;t currently on the menu...ask for &#34;Murphy&#39;s BBQ Beef Brisket&#34; when you visit and you may be served up this gastro-surprise.   My recommendation is to put it on the menu, it probably will become a favorite.   

We met the GM (Patrick Murphy) good Irish guy, came out to introduce himself and we had a nice conversation.   The people here are always friendly and that contributes to the overall experience of eating here.   The Barkeeps (bartenders) are a fun lot and are happy to serve you up free tasters.

Hey, it was a little awkward but I&#39;m not the type to say anything. I just complain later, lol. 

The menu was okay. We honestly didn&#39;t know what to get. We kind of expected a more expanded menu. The waitress said that the burgers are really tasty and popular.  
I decided to get the BBQ bacon burger and the hubby got the short ribs and the small town root beer.
The burger was great, good amount of bacon and sauce. The short ribs were amazing and boneless. We really enjoyed the sauce. I&#39;d love to get them again! He really enjoyed the root beer as well. Definitely said it was stronger than expected. The garlic mash potatoes were tasty too. Thick in texture. The corn on the cob was a little over cooked and shriveled, lol...

We decided to get dessert since everyone was raving about them. We got the death by chocolate. 
Umm. What the hell is it? A cold pudding with chocolate powder? Not a fan. We literally laughed when she brought it to the table. Oops! Sorry :/
 It was a waste of money. It wasn&#39;t rich in chocolate that we were expecting.
It tasted like cold pudding with some powder on top mixed with some chocolate topping? We were disappointed. Next time we want to try the pie in the jar....

The ambience was fun since the Cubs were playing. The table next to us wasn&#39;t too thrilled but whatever. 
Looks like a good time if you want to sit at the bar and have a few expensive drinks and watch a game. The place overall looks small and crowded. But pretty.

I am giving this place five stars to offset the one star reviews, so will my wife. I think the people who gave this place a one star think its Applebee&#39;s and are surprised that they don&#39;t roll out a red carpet.

We started off with the poppers. They were different than we expected... Not the traditional poppers we had pictured but they were very tasty.

Overall, our experience was great. 

Only negative thing we noticed was that the seating was very tight. But after all, it&#39;s the &#34;bar&#34; kind of environment where you go to have some drinks and watch sports.. Pretty typical.

Some feedback for the owners... The fries! I LOVE LOVE soggy fries (I won&#39;t touch crispy ones.. Just personal preference) so I was in heaven with their sweet potato fries!

Fabulous! There were a handful of tables occupied, and about a dozen people at the bar. Considering the odd time on a Friday, we thought that to be a good sign. 
Our server arrived and asked if we had ever dined there before, and then quickly explained the beer and wine options, as well as the soup of the day which she highlighted as being fantastic. 
With her suggestions noted, she left us to review the menu and make our selections. Hubby decided on a burger. I was undecided. The server was so excited about the days soup, that it made me want that (kudos to her! She totally sold the soup with her enthusiasm!!), but I knew just soup was not quite enough. A meatless salad for $9-$10 was not going to cut it. A small plate (appetizer)? Meh. Everything sounded heavy. Hubby convinced me to get the pastrami philly sandwich and that he would have some. 
We placed our order, and within a few minutes our meals arrived. My soup came alongside the philly which was served open faced. Husbands burger and fries looked great. 
The soup. Oh how I wanted to love it. The taste? Pure cornstarch. Total bummer as it had great potential (and a great marketer!). 
The philly. Oh. My. Where do I start? So this Philly was made with pastrami, cheese, etc. I love pastrami for its texture and flavor. But this pastrami was so salty, and so chewy, I couldn&#39;t eat beyond the first bite. I asked husband to try it to see if maybe I was just having an off day, but he could not muscle it down either. 
Husbands burger and fries: he says his burger was OK. Not awful, but very greasy. The bun literally slipped out of his hand when he first took it to his mouth (I laughed, but stopped when I took a bite of my sandwich).  The fries had zero flavor. Needed salt desperately. 
Which makes no sense. 
You butter your buns, but don&#39;t salt the fries? 
We looked around and there was no salt or pepper to be found nearby. Our server was awesome and was able to grab a salt shaker and pepper mill from the back...after about 5 minutes. 
Pepper mill? Empty. 
Salt? Near empty. 
Like I said, we wanted to try this place. And I really wanted to like my meal, as did hubby, but....not even close. 
The service was great. Friendly, informative, and concerned when I shared that the sandwich was really bad. (I didn&#39;t bother saying anything about the soup, nor did hubby mention his burger because at that point we just wanted to get going) the server took my sandwich off the bill, but did share that other guests RAVE about that sandwich. (Leaving me wondering what is wrong with my tastebuds) 
Will we go back? Yes. I think it&#39;s only fair to try it once more. And, it would be a sin to not return and try one of the incredible beers off their never ending list. 
Hopefully by our next visit the chef will have a better handle on how his recipes hold up and go out and adjust them accordingly. And maybe they&#39;ll throw some (filled) salt and pepper shakers onto their tables or at their beverage stations so servers can quickly hand them over when requested.",01/04/16,391,2,1,5,-8,8.828399999999998,7.839,5.367,42.793,No,3202

Waitresses both very accommodating, and were on top of it.  Unfortunately, the food didn&#39;t live up to expectations.  

Our first trip we visited as a date night, celebrating our anniversary.  We rarely have a night out without our 4 year old so we were excited to jump into the menu and try a little bit of everything.  We ordered a burger, Mac and cheese and the boneless ribs.  We also had sides of coleslaw, fries, garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.  The ribs were over cooked and extremely chewy, almost as if they were &#34;leftovers&#34;.  The mashed potatoes and coleslaw were the best parts of the meal.  The burger was &#34;ok&#34; at best.  Corn on the cob was so burnt and over cooked that the kernels were shriveled and not edible.  The Mac and cheese was tasty, but not good enough to take home as leftovers.  We felt it would not be good taken home unless we &#34;doctored it up&#34;.  

Our second trip we had our 4 year old and we stopped by for lunch.  Again service was great.  This time we were heading to a movie, so my hubby and I split the pastrami sandwich ordered fries and slaw as sides and our little guy ordered buttered noodles.  The sandwich was barely luke warm, had no flavor except of peppers.  The bread was soggy upon arrival and the cheese was pretty non existent.  The sides again were good.  The buttered noodles, as if you could mess them up were sitting in a pool of oily butter.  Even our 4 year old commented on it, and had to pour it off.

I settled on a shrimp po boy.  There were too few shrimp, and the ones that were there were soggy to the point of being mush.  I know amount of sauce is subjective, but there was a ridiculous amount of remoulade on the sandwich, making it almost inedible after scraping most of it off.  The sweet potato fries were also soggy.

We tried the pie in a jar...which is hard to screw up, but they managed.  The bananas were brown, there was a big was of graham dust under the pudding, and the candied nuts on top were stale.

I doubt I&#39;ll go back for anything other than beer.",05/10/15,89,1,1,0,-29,-0.8688,0.8039999999999999,1.881,8.315,No,797
woods-creek-tavern-lake-in-the-hills,jan l.,JHFsEH3US5qU507QgZHX5w,uQ9RmUO6hajGrEKxyp0zMA,"We went last weekend. It was crowded, new kid on the block. There have been several comments about the hostesses not knowing what they&#39;re doing. At 4:45, they had about 20 people suddenly standing in the front, with not much room to stand, and lots of empty tables. And about 5 employees, I assume hostesses,  standing around. But, it&#39;s still a new restaurant, and I&#39;m sure they will work through it.

 My husband had two beers, the same ones, but the check had two different beers, with two different prices. We didn&#39;t say anything, not the end of the world. The bartenders were kind of lost, but completely understandable, there are lots of beer taps, and it&#39;s new. They were all very nice.

We ordered the Chicago beef egg roll, which was really great. It&#39;s an Italian beef with giardiniera rolled in an egg roll  and fried. With a horseradish sauce for dipping. Delicious. What&#39;s not to love?

We also ordered the calamari, which was dreadful. It came out mushy, and for the 2nd time in 20 years, we sent food back. It came back out hotter, but still horrible.  I highly recommend stay away from that one.

They are a lot of disorganized, but trying very hard. Not any worse than you would expect within the first few weeks of opening. We will give it another try in a couple of months. I&#39;m sure they will have worked out the kinks.

On a funnier note, I asked our bartender if the owner had owned other restaurants, and she didn&#39;t have a clue.",11/09/15,172,3,1,1,-10,0.7771000000000001,2.78,2.033,19.187,No,1484
woods-creek-tavern-lake-in-the-hills,Michael G.,8j4appQIZoJaqlR7cHxSqw,27PaYJILm8XkGrxyzvz0Jw,"Nice.  Reasonable job on the pub with 31 craft beers + Miller Lite on tap.  Maybe a little light on the Gastro - with solid salad, sandwich &amp; burger offerings.
My wife &amp; I enjoyed the Philly Two-Hand Sandwich &amp; the BBQ Bacon Burger.  Each was amped up nicely with solid toppings &amp; good buns.  The sweet potato fries were okay - but weren&#39;t great once they started to cool.  The truffle fries were excellent!  We had a flight of three beers - the Founders R_b_us on Nitro was a smooth, summery draft.  I also enjoyed the Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer from SmallTown Brewing (with 10.8% ABV).
The place was busy for a late Friday lunch, but the waitstaff was keeping up.  Devin took very good care of us.  I believe the owners invested over $1m converting this from a prior restaurant-which-shall-not-be-named.  Overall, they&#39;ve done a good job. The stone finish is pleasant - though all of the hard surfaces keep noise levels a little high.
I&#39;d recommend Woods Creek and plan to return.  There were definitely some tasty-looking options we didn&#39;t get to order on round 1.",04/09/15,135,4,3,5,64,5.360900000000001,4.5,0.288,11.212,No,1106

Side veggies were Brussels sprouts, which were immediately banished from the table as he said they smelled terrible.

woods-creek-tavern-lake-in-the-hills,Lawrence Z.,y1stU4T4tHYsAzcW5774Cw,RVPtl__c8GDYZS-fEFP-PA,"I was here with a buddy of mine to watch Monday Night Football.  We were sitting at the bar and there was a couple next t us, who said it was their first time there as well.

I wound up getting the 5 beer sampler...which is GREAT because you get about a a good mouthful and a half...or about 2 tastes.  This was a nice way to try some of the brews, without having to get an entire pint/glass.  It also didn&#39;t help that out bar tender was really cute...short, but very personable, paid attention to what we were drinking and how full our glasses were, etc.

I got the Chicken Pot Pie and my buddy got the Woods Creek Philly.  Oddly enough, one of the couple sitting next to us got the Philly as well.  My pot pie was more like a bowl of really thick soup or some type of Chicken Pot Pie Stew.  It was good, but not what I was expecting.  However, my friend and neighbor at the bar raved about the Philly.  I was kind of jealous because I was thinking about getting that, but wanted to get something different.  My friend then went on to say, if the Philly had bacon on it, he would have lost his mind.

Overall, the place looks O.K.  It&#39;s more of a casual type of place, rather than a place where you might get all dressed up.  For a first date, I would say hold off and go with friends, as that&#39;s the vibe and atmosphere I got from the experience.  This would be a third or fourth date type of place, or if you wanted to take your father out for some good food and have a beer.

Just these tiny round sniffer type glasses. Even more surprising was my bill for a beer. 8 bucks for about 10 ounces. Needless to say the lager wasn&#39;t that great and at that price I chose NOT to have a second overpriced tiny beer. You have got to be joking? I mean come on. This is Lake in the Hills not Beverly Hills. Not sure what the owner was going for but I have a hunch he&#39;s trying to make the patrons pay for the &#34;over the top&#34; building material expense.

Arrived for dinner as a party of 4 at 8:00pm on Halloween.  Place was full, but no one was standing around waiting and the hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait. okkkaaay?  Maybe they were all at the bar waiting on open tables?   So we meandered over to this large looking table that looks like a second bar/community seating area and grabbed a few open seats. We started chatting and approx. 5 mins later another server/hostess comes over and explains that this is the conference table and not available for &#34;open seating&#34; and we would have to move.  No problem we got up and stood back over by the door.  Not 2 minutes later the original hostess who took our name comes over and asks if we would be ok sitting at the conference table seating and she points to the exact seats where we just got up.   I said -- You mean where we just were asked to get up and move from?  and she says &#34;yes&#34;.   Hmmm...  We opted to wait for a traditional table and not sit at the weird large conference table with other guests. We were seated at a traditional table within 5 mins.  

NOISE LEVEL:  LOUD. what? Did I mention it was LOUD? Hard surface floor. stone walls. metal high ceiling.  LOUD.  Adding something to improve the acoustics and deaden some of the noise would make for a better dining experience for guests that actually want to hear the person sitting across from them. 

SERVICE: GOOD.  Our teenage mutant ninja turtle was pleasant and attentive. (It was Halloween and all wait staff was dressed up) (Can&#39;t recall her name)

PACE:  SLOW.  Dinner took longer than average to arrive.  Our group was just mentioning that we were wondering if something happened with our order and getting ready to ask the server and thinking we should check on the meal when it appeared.  

FOOD:  BEST part of the night!  Really good.  Better than I&#39;ve had at a lot of places out this way!  Chicken Caprese Sandwich with yummy sweet potato fries.   Others had a shrimp Po&#39;Boy that looked good with large shrimp on a great looking roll with shredded lettuce and a sauce drizzled on top --",01/11/15,251,2,1,5,7,5.1849,4.065,1.486,26.449,No,2174

We are always excited when a new restaurant opens. However to our disappointment, Woods Creek Tavern is not good.  We went at a time when it was not busy and the service was still slow. The worst of it was the black and blue burger my husband ordered. It was crispy and charred to the point of inedible. So we sent it back and just ordered a regular cheese burger. We ate our dinner without my husband. When he finally got his burger, the manager, who took no accountability and had an attitude said that all the black and blue burgers are charred not seasoned. I have never heard of that. Maybe they need to write that in their menu- crispy, charred, not seasoned. I think the manager and the cooks need to learn how to make a black and blue burger or at least let people know how the burger is made -  charred and crispy. After the problems with the burger, we got the bill and they still had the charred to a rock burger on the bill instead of a regular burger. We notified the waitress and she did make the  change. 

We will not return to this restaurant and we will notify our friends of our opinions and what happened. Hopefully this restaurant will make some changes, otherwise I believe it will not be successful as the other restaurants in the area.",14/09/15,138,1,1,-1,-80,-1.2930999999999997,0.511,0.967,14.521999999999998,No,1341

Our server was pretty good. Solid B. All the staff seemed to be active. Place just opened so the manager(s) should have been more engaged with the customers.

Food? We had burgers. Very tasty, priced on the high side of average.

Beer? Nice selection of craftbeers....but....no Weizen Beer of any kind?  I think the beer is overpriced. Served in tiny glasses. This is Chicago. We like big, tall cold beers. Don&#39;t want free beer. Normal tumbler, normal price. Beer shouldn&#39;t be in little brandy sniffers.

Finally the interior layout. I grade it a Z. Horrible. Whomever told you that giant long high table was a good idea needs to be hobbled. No intimacy in this place whatsoever. You need small kneewalls. Plastic plants, something to make it less plain. Take a look at Jameson&#39;s in Crystal Lake.

We had a group of about 10 people and everyone was able to find something that they liked with no problems because of the great selection this bar offers.

The bartenders were also incredibly nice and friendly. The layout of the bar was pretty standard with bar stools and high tables for people to sit or stand around.

First visit there and likely my last. Too bad....cute place! Call me picky but ...

Food: My skillet was described as having corned beef but it was their hash which was full of green and red peppers which I do not like. I suppose I could have asked but when menu said &#34;corned beef&#34; I thought I&#39;d be getting ... well ... corned beef. The &#34;home fries&#34; at the base were not fresh...clearly those industrially cut, uniformly sized cubes. Also thought there would be a side of toast but I thought wrong. 

My companion ordered the corned beef hash and though it was seemingly homemade, which is good, it was served skillet - style which was not described in the menu. He expected the potatoes to be on the side and not all piled up w the hash and eggs,  and was disappointed with the presentation. Also...again...no toast. We like toast! For a $10 breakfast I think you should throw some in. 

Also...and I know part of this is somewhat out of their control, they had the outer bathroom door propped open. This part clearly under their control. There was a stall but, I dunno, am I wrong to want more privacy? There is seating just a short distance from the restrooms. Plus ... as a patron would you want to sit by an open bathroom door while eating your food?

In addition, the one toilet was clogged and disgusting. They sent me upstairs to another bathroom but ew....check the bathrooms regularly please!

Service: Nice when they were there...but slow. Maybe because we were outside but we weren&#39;t THAT far away. And it wasn&#39;t that busy. 
. 
So to be fair...maybe I just ordered their most mediocre item and hit the bathroom at just the wrong time but not sure I&#39;d want to go back anytime soon. Plus ... did I mention? No toast!",26/06/16,207,2,1,0,-31,-0.4647,2.252,2.189,19.559000000000005,No,1783

Middleton&#39;s is located in a very old building with lots of charm. I think it was a brothel at one time, but don&#39;t quote me on that. When you walk in you are greeted by a friendly hostess. The bar is off to the right and a dinning room is off to the left.  When the weather is nice the open air front porch offers a wonderful relaxed option.  

The food is very good and portions are big.  Yesterday four of us went for breakfast.  We started by splitting one of their homemade cinnamon rolls - it was awesome.  I had biscuits and gravy with two eggs over easy.  My wife had one of the eggs Benedict variants.  My kids both had crepes.  All the food was excellent.  Our total bill was $53, which seemed very reasonable.  

My only knock was my bloody mary.  It was weak and bland.  

Overall, Middleton&#39;s is a great place to come with friends or family.  The restaurant is quaint and very family friendly.  The bar is a great place to watch a game, and offers an extensive list of craft brews.

I tried a taste and loved it.   Then the second time I went here I was in the mood for eating some place other than the usual haunts.

The deviled ham that comes with FGT was very good.  We also ordered two different salads, the Berry salad with nuts was very good as was the cucumber and tomato salad with pistachio nuts.

We were seated immediately on the main floor. I ordered the Apple glazed pork chops with mashed potatoes and spinach. My wife ordered the standard fare of fish and chips. The food was excellent with the only issue was with the coleslaw that was very Bland. My pork chop was double thick and was juicy. The mashed potatoes could have been much better. The fish and chips however was awesome. The cod fillets were in strips and the French fries seem to be double dipped in the fryer. Yummy! My wife also commented that the tartar sauce was as good as hers.

middletons-on-main-wauconda,Julianne P.,kZwKJED4iJEersXNYvnalw,LfyGXzd5MUVwCl6wRLW1fg,"Fell in love with Middleton&#39;s on Main! The set up is really cool. It&#39;s clearly an older building but is holding up quite well if you ask me. There&#39;s two levels, main floor and an upstairs- both have outdoor seating which is neat. I sat on the balcony upstairs, getting a nice view of the street and enjoyed the nice weather.   I ordered an appetizer, Pretzel with a cheese dip. The cheese dip was amazing! I couldn&#39;t stop dipping my pretzel in it! The only downfall to it were the pretzels. They appeared to be the kind that are from a box and can easily microwave it. 
The entree I ordered was the Chicken Caprese Panini. It had a balsamic glaze with a pesto mayo and the combination was delicious. It gave the panini a nice flavorful juice. The chicken was a tad dry but thankfully the juice from the pesto and glaze helped. 
Service was decent. The employees are very kind but a tad slow. Which was odd, considering when I went it was on a Saturday afternoon and wasn&#39;t nearly close to being full. Then again I didn&#39;t see many employees around...

middletons-on-main-wauconda,Luna M.,vawW_vlm-H-1xsqH8cKFOw,mw_2ns3rTT8_1KBv1xROOQ,"Middleton&#39;s on Main is the bomb!   

When Middleton&#39;s on Main took over the empty building, I was glad that Wauconda finally had a new restaurant/bar to offer the community.   Lindy&#39;s &amp; Slyce cannot compete against Middleton&#39;s.   

My husband &amp; I originally went to Middleton&#39;s on a Friday night to check out my friend&#39;s band playing, and I thought it would be great way to ck out the place.   Middleton&#39;s is an upscale Irish bar with a talented staff (from their servers to bar tenders to bus boys).  I could not believe how organized they were, how friendly they were with the customers, how familiar they were with their menu, and how clean it was.  I could not help but think that Robert Irvine could not correct the flow or process they had going on in the bar section.  

They have dining seating area (which I plan on coming back &amp; having lunch or dinner there).   While their bar is on the right side of the building with upper seating to look over the bar.   

For drinks, I went with my usual (Captain &amp; coke) but I wish I could have tried the Strawberry Hill because it sounded yummy &amp; sweet (..... next time).   They had an elaborate list of mixed drinks, beers, wine, cordials to choose from.   

For food, we wanted to order appetizers to go with our drinks.    So I ordered their Fish (cod) &amp; chips &amp; my husband ordered their Mac &amp; Cheese.   The batter on the cod was crunchy &amp; the cod was tender &amp; fresh.   The dill sauce was a great compliment for dipping.    But wait, it gets better--- their fries made me oooooooo &amp; ahhhhhh.    Delicious!   I sampled the Mac &amp; cheese, it was creamy &amp; the bacon complimented the flavor.    They offer a lot of variety on their menu.   So I will be glad to come back &amp; try their other menu items.   

I&#39;m definitely a fan of Middleton&#39;s and &#39;you&#39; should check out this awesome place.",04/05/13,208,4,1,5,3,7.251799999999999,4.218,0.14500000000000002,16.637,No,1935

The food was good, the beer list was extensive, and everyone was clearly having a great time. I would come back if I was in the area!

I came here for a friend&#39;s birthday, and a good time was had by all. Parking was a bit difficult (we wound up parking a few blocks away on a side street), and it was a bit loud in the bar with the loud music, but there were places we could have sat that would have been quieter, so I can&#39;t fault them for this. I loved the variety of little nooks here- a main dining room on the left, a hoppin&#39; bar to the right, and small, more hidden dining area on the 2nd floor.

The food was pretty good- I wouldn&#39;t come here specifically for the food, but it was totally serviceable. I ate nachos, which came with a delicious cheese sauce AND melted shredded cheese. I got ground beef, which I would not recommend, as it was not well-seasoned- it just didn&#39;t taste spicy or Mexicanish at all. I realize I ordered these at an Irish pub, but they could have thrown some salsa in there. Still, small quibbles- I still ate them! My fiance ordered fish and chips, and they brought him some extra tarter sauce when he asked them without complaint or an extra charge. He ate them quickly enough I didn&#39;t even get a chance to try them.

The crust and flavor was incredible - she gave me a bite - OMG.  I had a Guinness-marinated lamb stew in a bread bowl - again OMG flavorful.  We got MAC and Cheese with bacon and country ham for my adult son to take home.  Even reheated he said it was delightful and he is a mac and cheese fanatic.

The atmosphere is great, the place is clean, and the history of the building is very interesting. The drink menu is pretty extensive, and I didn&#39;t even look at a beer menu. The food is outstanding. The menu has just the right amount of variety. I ordered the special (M.O.M.&#39;s meatloaf). It wasn&#39;t the flavor of meatloaf I am accustomed to, but it was still great. It was more food than I really needed, but I couldn&#39;t stop myself from eating everything. It came with a side salad which I had with, what I am assuming is homemade, Smokey Bacon bleu cheese dressing. The meatloaf was covered in an unusual sweet, brown gravy with mashed potatoes and corn with onion straws on top. 

Others tried the grilled chicken sandwich and the Jameson Chicken. The grilled chicken sandwich wasn&#39;t anything great, but it is just a grilled chicken sandwich. The &#34;bacon&#34; they put on the top is a piece of ham that has been pan fried. The Jameson Chicken was very good. It was breaded and fried chicken cuts served with a white gravy that is infused with Jameson Whiskey, mashed potatoes, and wilted spinach. The gravy is excellent, and I was stealing fries to dip in the gravy.

The couple we were with have been to Middleton&#39;s several times and extolled its virtue as a casual eatery. 

I loved the ambiance and a perky server was right there to take drink orders as soon as we took our seats. The menu is vast with choices from full course specials featuring seafood, meat, pasta and more. The choices of sandwiches \ burgers is impressive to say the least. 

I ordered a pork tenderloin special that featured paillard pork medallions in a cranberry sauce. Unfortunately, my pork (and my friends dish) were overcooked and dry. The sauce was excellent however. 

For an establishment that focuses on crafted beers the wine selection was surprisingly good. One of our friends did however ask for a wine that were out of that day. 

The service was really great. Our server was on point with all our orders and my wine glass was never empty. Keep wine in front of me all night and your tip will be excellent!  

Some of our group ordered sandwiches and those reportedly were fantastic. I will give Middleton&#39;s another opportunity shortly but will stick with the traditional pub fare and stay clear of more traditional entrees. 

All in all a nice place, near my home, and I will be back. If 3  1/2 stars were available I would have raised my rating. Over cooking my pork cost them a star however.",02/06/13,154,3,2,5,37,7.6796,3.879,0.252,13.869000000000002,No,1432

Husband had the all-you-can-eat fish fry which he said was &#34;pretty good&#34; and I had the fish tacos which were barely tolerable.

middletons-on-main-wauconda,Alison B.,A4tYnpJPUMXQpbx9TcyTbQ,T1Y_1_tLORngVYTUqhyfVw,"I know everyone in Wauconda loves MIddletons, but being a foodie - I&#39;m not as thrilled.

I&#39;ve been a few different times.  For drinks, for dessert and for dinner.  Haven&#39;t had a great experience except that I&#39;m with friends.

The most annoying thing to me, but I know some people actually would probably like this point, is the band that seems to always be playing.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m old, but when I get into Middletons, I feel old because I always feel like the music is WAY too loud.  In the bar - loud; over in the restaurant up and down - loud; and the WORST place ever to sit, the balcony across from the balcony where the band plays -- I think I lost about 30% of my hearing on that balcony. 

Beyond that - I love cocktails and I&#39;ve tried a few of the ones on their menu and haven&#39;t been thrilled with any of them.  If you like beer, I know they have a pretty broad selection.

Desserts - tried a few and haven&#39;t been blown away by anything - they&#39;ve got sugar in them so that makes me happy....  And the dinner that I tried was not that fabulous either.

The one thing I did like is the actual building itself.  If nothing else, go into Middletons for the history - they really did a good job of updating the restaurant, but leaving a lot of the original old building&#39;s bones.  I really do love going into the place just for the wood and brick and all.  Very cool.",02/03/13,144,3,2,3,20,2.8568,2.666,0.821,10.513,No,1417

Well..... there were NO tantrums.  In fact, all kids were relatively sedate and well behaved all evening.  There is something magic about this restaurant that allows adults to feel like adults (GREAT food, extensive beer list and good wine choices, dim lighting) and still allows kids to be content too (lots of kids books to borrow from the hostess stand, kids menu options were real food not an afterthought, enough room to walk around if necessary, diaper changing station in the bathroom, etc.)

I&#39;m not much of a cabbage fan so I took a pass and substituted with new-to-me dish, sweet potato tater tots. Excellent as expected. My wife had the Farmer&#39;s Salad and gave it a positive review.

There&#39;s several places to choose in Wauconda now. I&#39;d highly suggest giving Middelton&#39;s your first shot even if this place is packed (once the word gets out that it&#39;s a great place to eat).",06/06/12,130,5,2,5,21,6.681000000000001,4.5969999999999995,0.183,13.219,No,1096

We sat at the upstairs bar and my only suggestion is to either have the bar stocked with most of the beer selections or get a dumbwaiter to the downstairs bar.  It takes too long for the bartender to put the drink order in and then go downstairs to pick up the drink order.  Very inconvenient to the guests and bartender.  All in all freeway place.

I love the atmosphere there. Tasty beer selection but dissapointed that they do not offer any Hard Ciders. It is on the menu but when I spoke with the bartender she said that they dont really have any except for one that they have on tap but she didnt recommend it.. she gave me a sample and it definitely didnt taste like any hard cider I have had before, very bland and dull. So moving on to the food. I had the paddy melt and it was delicious, i could not stop eating the fries. The only complaint that i would have is that I asked for the burger to be cooked well done and it was more medium then well done. My friend had the scallops risotto and she was happy with it. To finish the meal we both had the apple crisp for dessert and it was phenominal!! I will definitely be coming back here.",25/02/13,83,4,2,3,25,2.9177,2.344,0.254,7.402,No,880

We were seated immediately upon arriving around 5:15pm. We sat down and went through the expansive drink/beer/wine menus. We both decided on different tap beers, they were out of both. We skipped the alcohol and just ordered an appetizer while we went over the menu for our dinner. Our appetizer arrived quickly, and we then ordered soups and our entrees. Our soups were delivered immediately as we were still working on the appetizer. Then, within minutes, while still on the appetizer, soups still sitting there , our entrees were served. I could not believe what was happening. Now during all of this, our water glasses went empty and refills on our iced teas never happened. There were bus boys running all over this place and not one of them knew how to pick up a water pitcher. We finished most of the appetizer, half of our soups(bowls of the cheese soup) and part of our dinners. We had to eat so fast that we felt bloated, and were unable to really enjoy or even finish our meals. Most of it was cold by the time we were trying to finish. We took most of it home. I will say the food really was good, but the service was really clueless, and there was NO reason to rush us like that in a half empty dining room. I even wrote a &#34;contact us&#34; message stating the above to management. Its been 48 hours and haven&#39;t heard from them. They are quite deserving of this review.

We had the fish and chips (solid choice) and the Reuben. The Reuben was good.... The berry tea was perfect, but for the price they should give refills.

Now for the negative... I kept a star back because of the service. Are waitress Kelly was shall we say horrid.

I&#39;m not usually a big fan of Thai food, but after looking on Yelp, some of the dishes left me with a craving for it. It doesn&#39;t get too crowded so we were served right away too.

We ordered the big plate, spicy duck rolls, and pork pad Thai. The big plate was a great appetizer/dish to share and sample some things on the menu. The crispy salmon rolls weren&#39;t really what I expected- which was what I was most excited for- but still good. The array of sauces in this dish was awesome too- lots of different yummy flavors. I really liked the spicy duck rolls too, but beware- it is SPICY. The pork pad Thai was fresh and delicious as well.

Anyways, I really liked the ground chicken salad (Larb) that I would get this again if I go back but I would ask for more than just medium spice. The massaman curry was great too.

altthai-arlington-heights,John S.,dTrZjY5RydiXBiCnY-aA2A,Ibt20whYQXGdHcTmx8WVGQ,"While still on the walkabout to find a great Thai place we finally went to altThai. As others have said a modern decor to the interior. It feels nice and open unlike many places that have poor lighting and just feel dark and dingy. Although that might be what they&#39;re going for...

Had lunch specials so they come with little sides that IMO are 100% better than any other Thai spot. Fresh cucumber salad was great and the pot stickers we&#39;re also good. The soup is real TomYum. 

The spicy ginger w/ seafood was great. Very clean seafood, cooked right, with hot peppers. They marinade the squid so it has a nice texture &amp; not super chewy.

Also did the Pad Thai and was a big fan. Served with sprouts, ground peanuts, shredded cabbage, &amp; carrots. It had the right amount of sauce and it was not oily like so many other places. The only thing I wasn&#39;t keen on was the BBQ pork. It&#39;s a clean cutlet that they slice for you with bbq flavor on the outside. It&#39;s not bad but I might have been expecting marinaded pork pieces that I have had in so many other Thai dishes but bbq&#39;d flavored. If you think of this as well done dry cuts of pork w/ some bbq flavor you&#39;ll be ok.

Both these lunch portions were large compared to other Thai places so it&#39;s a good value for me. If I make one comment it&#39;s that the items I had could have used a bit more salt (WHAT?) I know I never say that as I hate over salted food! They do give you soy and hot sauce on the table but the flavors just needed a little boost. I will say I&#39;d rather add that have it loaded up to begin with.

Our server was quick to notice that hubby was a vegetarian and accordingly suggested dishes without meat, seafood or fish sauce.

One irritation. If it wasn&#39;t for the following, the would have all five stars. When we order a vegetable dish, we must specify for the cooks not to put fish sauce in. Why would you put fish on a vegetable dish? This is not listed in the menu. None of the staff mentioned for several visits, until one did. That&#39;s almost dishonest.

I&#39;ve dined in and carry-out. 
Dining in experience:
I love the presentation using the beets, so simple yet eye pleasing. We dined in on a Sat evening and it was surprisingly not busy but food did take awhile to prepare compare to other places. 
We ordered several dishes to share, one of them being woon sen and requested mild for the kids. 2 out of 3 kids complained dish was too spicy (you have to specify your heat level for each dish). The one that didn&#39;t complain was older n she can tolerate some heat. The adults tried the dish and thought it was fine but we believe it was bc our tastebuds were numb by the spice frm trying all our other dishes. We came to the conclusion that they messed up on the heat level of all our dishes bc the one that we requested &#34;hot&#34; wasn&#39;t as spicy as a dish that we requested &#34;medium&#34;. It wasn&#39;t a huge issue bc the flavor profile for all the dishes were on pt; was just an issue for the kids dish. We ended up ordering fried rice for them and made certain they made it mild. 
Service was ok, didn&#39;t seem very attentive. We were celebrating a bday and server said he would bring out dessert at the end and forgot, had to ask someone else. 
Carry-out experience:
They have a very good lunch special. Soup is included when u dine in but not carry-out. Portions of items not part of special seems to be smaller (imo) compared to same item ordered for dinner dine in and I believe pricing is the same.

Crab rangoon was so good. I loved it. They actually had seasonings in the filling! The papaya salad wasn&#39;t as fishy as I&#39;d like it, but it was super spicy and still pretty good. I&#39;ve had the best homemade papaya salad so nothing ever comes close. The tom yum seafood was delicious. Lots of seafood and spicy. Panang chicken was too watery. It was like a soup. The flavors were good, but I&#39;m used to panang being creamier and thicker. I almost thought they accidentally brought us another tom yum. Pad see ew was good too.

The staff is always ready for your service and gives attention to each table properly. 

The staff properly listens to your requirement of the food and takes proper instructions as you direct. We always order only specific veggies &#34;no meat, no egg, no eggplant, no mushrooms&#34; and we have never been disappointed with any unusual dish or unwanted ingredients in the food. 

The cleanliness of the place is also very well maintained. Usually when we go out in different restaurants many times it happens that the restaurant is clean but the restrooms are not in a good condition,  uncleaned and stinky. Over here the cleanliness is very well maintained and is always clean.

I said I would like to add more veggies. Nonetheless, she wasn&#39;t too friendly about my request. When my soup came back with the extra veggies, I was disappointed to see that the soup was still mostly broth-- some mushrooms were added. Not only was I disappointed with the extreme lack of veggies and tofu for a $10 soup, but the soup itself was extremely tasteless and bland.

The language barrier is often difficult for people, and they&#39;re doing their best to bring you delicious food. Hope when you open your restaurant in Thailand it goes better for you.

altthai-arlington-heights,Robin W.,c-WUAibnrjL7ld58sujdzw,jXQK7gnHEy-kjd9Lmh9OIg,"Chicago gets cold in the winter. Oh Lord, does it get cold. Most of you are now thinking, no sh*t Sherlock, what&#39;d you go there in the winter for? I travel every week for my job, and my most recent assignment had me visiting Chicagoland in November through January. I never seem to get a Florida assignment in the winter. :( But I digress. One cold and snowy night, I persuaded a coworker to scope out a particular Chinese bistro in Arlington Heights for dinner. Little did we know the place is closed on Mondays. So we drove around looking for someplace else Asian, and Google Maps sort of led us to altThai. I say sort of because we asked for Asian restaurants in Arlington Heights, but the map directions had us driving all around the place...it&#39;s tucked into a corner of a small  courtyard that also houses a Noodles &amp; co., a sushi parlor, an ice cream parlor, and some other businesses. Thankfully, free garage parking was available so we didn&#39;t have to park on the snowy street.

The establishment is small and intimate, softly lit. Instead of cheesy quarter-tone music, light dinner jazz played overhead. Tables are small and seat no more than four. I&#39;d guess they seat no more than 30 overall. Service was attentive without being pushy, and on both occasions we went, the server was quite knowledgeable about the food.

Because I was freezing my buns off, I started with the tom kha soup. (Note for those new to Thai food: Tom kha is the one with the coconut milk; tom yum is the broth.) Coworker went with the spinach soup with chicken balls. The serving of tom kha can be a meal by itself. Large portion, tangy, coconutty, with a variety of yummy ingredients. I had them put tofu in, but of course you can choose chicken if you prefer. When I go to a new Thai place, I always ask for medium spicy, figuring I can modulate up or down if needed. This place&#39;s &#34;medium&#34; is just a little bit on the hot side; I&#39;d give it a 6 on a scale of 0 to 10 for heat.

Curries at altThai are just sensational. On my first visit, I chose the red curry, medium spicy with tofu. A huge bowl of vegetables and tofu with a soup-like portion of  coconut gravy came my way, with white rice. Brown rice or noodles are available for an upcharge, but I feel like spicy food isn&#39;t cooled off by brown rice very well even though I know it&#39;s better for me. What a savory, mellow taste. A perfect toe-warmer!

The next time we visited, I chose the same soup but for an entree, chose the Crispy Basil Salmon. Now, that name is linguistically ambiguous; you would think &#34;crispy&#34; refers to the salmon, but it doesn&#39;t. What I received was a large salmon filet, cooked properly, with crispy basil leaves on top and vegetables to the side. Apparently they fry the basil leaves, which is a nice crunchy garnish. The best part of this dish, besides the perfect salmon, is the melt-in-your-mouth eggplant that appears in the vegetable mix. A nice foil for the spice.

Sadly, my favorite Thai dessert, mango with sticky rice, was not available this winter; my server informed me it&#39;s seasonal, which is reasonable but still disappointing. I never get any other dessert in a Thai restaurant. So, I guess I&#39;ll just have to hope my company sends me to Chicago this spring or summer, so I can enjoy another terrific meal at altThai!",16/02/16,415,5,3,5,64,4.4928,3.499,1.359,34.142,No,3362

There is very little communication between the server and the customer. Every time I have dined here, the server didn&#39;t make eye contact or offer water refills. I never got a smile, a hello, a thank you, or a &#34;how are you?&#34;

I really don&#39;t have high expectations, I just like to feel welcomed. I don&#39;t feel that way when I dine here. I get that this isn&#39;t a five star restaurant, but I don&#39;t like being ignored, and brushed aside. I feel uncomfortable and rushed when I eat and it&#39;s hard to feel at home. 

Another thing is that despite the fact that I love spicy food, and can usually gauge what mild, medium, and hot mean, the food is always way too spicy for what it claims to be. I&#39;ve ordered each level of &#34;hotness&#34; and have found that the mild flavor still requires me to drink a good glass of ice cold water, the medium spiciness makes me sweat, gasp, and down several glasses of water, and upgrading to hot makes me breathe fire and gulp an entire pitcher of water. (Bring your own water so you don&#39;t have to flag down a server like I did for a simple refill.)

We also shared chicken Thai fried rice and chicken pad Thai (medium spice). So delicious and we&#39;re bringing home leftovers, so excited for lunch tomorrow, lol. Both have great flavors and spices. Fresh. Love it! Probably the best Thai food I&#39;ve had in this area.

We also redeemed our free Thai iced tea for checking in, it&#39;s good! Different. Mom thinks it tastes like a creamsicle. For a free drink, why not.

The decor is trendy chic, which is why I found that the waiters wearing jeans to be slightly off?  I would suggest that they wear dark khakis instead.  It says business casual in a very trendy Google software-engineer kind of way..

altthai-arlington-heights,Shawn L.,UKpiHrku6H769bYne4BMug,en0ivacvDp_zv5O5CFj_Og,"One of the better restaurants I&#39;ve eaten at in a long time.

The ambiance is nice with minimal and simple decor that resembles a modern caf̩. As for how many people this restaurant can accommodate, I couldn&#39;t  imagine a huge party eating here but rather a family of 4 or so.

It was Friday evening and it wasn&#39;t packed as I expected. There were actually a lot of tables open so in the beginning I questioned the popularity of this place. However once we received our food, I questioned why this restaurant wasn&#39;t as crowded as it should have been.

Let me start off by saying that they&#39;re very generous with the seafood content in their entrees. We had so much scallop/shrimp in our entrees that it was almost overwhelming. We tried Caribbean fried rice, basil scallop (comes with a small bowl of rice), and seafood pad Thai. Caribbean fried rice and basil scallop were our favorites. Pad Thai rice noodle was still cooked perfectly but it didn&#39;t go over my expectation in terms of taste. However, if you&#39;re a fan of Pad Thai, I advise you get it. 

Service was great and even appetizers were served hot and fresh. We were pleasantly surprised on how good the appetizers were. The chicken satay was okay however. Chicken was cooked properly but the whole overall taste with the peanut sauce didn&#39;t impress me. Probably our least favorite. But try the shrimp and calamari appetizers. 

For a group of 3, the bill came out around $75. 3 appetizers, 3 entree and a free Thai iced tea for checking in on yelp? I&#39;d say that&#39;s a pretty good price. 

I would definitely come back here again as it seems that there&#39;s a lot of people who order their meals for a pick up instead of eating at the restaurant. It might be because you get a 10% discount from ordering online. Regardless, altThai was a pleasant surprise.",10/04/15,199,4,2,5,30,5.7886999999999995,4.1209999999999996,0.9139999999999999,18.965,No,1852

You&#39;ll be given a choice of spiciness when you order your food, so you won&#39;t be out of your depth and sweating like Hephaestus.

My go-to orders are tofu pad thai with a thai ice coffee. Oh, how&#39;d I forget! The drinks rock. Coffee is very, very good- creamy with what I think is either condensed milk or coconut milk. There are many tea options as well, including a classic matcha-based green ice tea that pairs well with the spice.

Last time I went (and I go every couple of weeks), the owner sent us a free dessert. When I asked what the occasion was, he brushed it off and said &#34;just because!&#34; That was a really nice touch- and the ice cream/fried banana were great, to boot! :)

The interior of the restaurant was interesting. The shape of the restaurant is kind of odd, with a bunch of corners and walls all over, making it inconvenient to place furniture. But it looked clean and modern. The furniture kind of looked like Ikea furniture- cheap but sleek. The table had a really neat rubbery table cloth wrapped around it- you could tell it was on the cheaper side but it looked nice.

My friend had the Panang curry with fish and enjoyed it; she noted that the spice level was not dumbed down for the suburban palate.
I love crab and so had to try the crab-fried rice. It had a generous portion of blue crab, some of it stirred into the rice and the rest on top. Rice was not greasy or heavy as so many versions of fried rice are, plus there were a few more vegetables than normal.

I can&#39;t say enough great things about the service I received at while ordering and waiting for my food at Alt Thai, but I&#39;m certainly non-plussed that nearly 3 weeks after they changed me for Tom Yum soup that I did NOT receive, I&#39;ve still yet to have been refunded. 

It is really cute inside- great for a casual date and one of the only dining places on the block not swarmed by teens. 

The food that I did receive was underwhelming at best and the portion size of my Spicy basil w/ tofu looked like the leftover amount I&#39;d have after eating that same dish at any other Thai food restaurant. SUPER small, didn&#39;t even span the bottom of the container and the rice was obviously very not fresh. I know I came during an off-peak hour but rice that doesn&#39;t seem like it was cooked yesterday, reheated and put in a box doesn&#39;t seem like a whole lot to ask. Normally I&#39;m so excited about my Thai that I pretty much inhale it, here, even with the teeny bopper portion, I stopped a few bites in and went to work on a mega-giant wildlife puzzle I&#39;d been working on for the past few days. I finished it a few hours later figuring that the rice couldn&#39;t taste all that much more stale than it did when I got it.

We started with the crab rangoons, which were crispy and fried well but not dripping in oil.  The filling was cream cheese, crab, and also little bits of celery and other veggies that helped give it a great texture.  The rangoons come drizzled with sweet &amp; sour sauce.

Next, I orderd the ginger tofu rice dish with brown rice and my fiance ordered the spicy basil noodles with beef.  Both were served as great portions (we both took half the meal home), and the sauce was not oily at all.  More importantly, the sauce was flavorful and tasty without being too heavy on soy sauce which seems to be the midwestern Thai style.  Light sauces, full of flavor, and fresh ingredients.

It&#39;s supposed to be a riot of flavors and textures. The only slight disappointment was that I ordered my meal in a stone bowl, which didn&#39;t quite crisp up the rice enough, IMO.

Both my husband and I had the Bibimbap, so I can only review that.  We had the spicy pork and it was really salty which was a disappointment.  But, you get to pick out the various veggies, tofu, kimchi, etc. that you want in your bowl, so that was cool to be able to customize it.  Then, a fried egg was added from the kitchen (you have to have a fried egg with your Bibimbap!).  The serving size was gigantic, I probably could&#39;ve eaten it in two meals, but I was hungry.  :)  The actual restaurant is rather small and there were some loud children there, so we just took our food to go.

I had the Galbi bibimibap which was basically
Marinated ribs with various vegetables of which you can choose. They are warmed up and sit in piles in the bowl. I guess it&#39;s your job to mix them up. Overall a yummy dish but I maybe expected something different. The ribs were the best part!

I also had the garlic soy chicken wings and kogii fries. The fries were kinda like chili cheese fries but not spicy. They offer another kind of fries I tried and they were spicy but had more flavor.

The wings were the biggest surprise to me. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The flavor was cooked into the skin perfectly. If you love wings then don&#39;t pass these up. 

This place is great for a small group but don&#39;t expect to come with a group of 4 or more. They have limited space. Also the food can 10-15 to prepare based on what you want.

I did indeed see this time that everyone in the front or back room was wearing a hat, so that was good. 

Though one of the messages had invited me for a free meal, for the purposes of a fair and balanced Yelp review we paid our way and got the garlic-soy Korean fried chicken, as well as some dumplings again. 

The fried dumplings were just as tasty as the first time: greasy-good with the chile sauce at the table.

But the star here was the fried chicken wings!! Managing to be both sticky with the sauce yet remaining crispy-skinned, the meat was also marvelously moist: I was using Anthony Bourdain words like &#34;succulent&#34; and &#34;luscious&#34; as we licked our fingers. Also, these wings dwarf the babies at Buffalo Wild Wings or wherever: I couldn&#39;t even finish my order of ten (after the dumplings). I&#39;ve gotta say too: don&#39;t kid yourself, even though this is chicken, it ain&#39;t a healthy meal; as my bf put it, &#34;It&#39;s basically an elephant ear with some chicken inside.&#34; Still, so darn tasty!!

kogii-kogii-express-naperville,Sung Y.,tKKyYFL2geQBTOJCZuD-ow,EfOeNOzbuFBIjfvwDhZTjQ,"Kogii Kogii Express is a new Korean casual quick eats restaurant located in the busy Naperville Freedom Commons plaza. Freedom Commons is becoming the go to spot for dining in Naperville as the vast array of culinary selections range from casual to fine dining. My only gripe was the lack of Asian dining choices so I&#39;m happy to see this place open up.

Bibimbap is the main attraction here and Kogii Kogii Express offers a unique make your own chipotle style bibimbap station. For those that don&#39;t know what bibimbap is, it&#39;s a traditional Korean rice bowl dish that contains rice topped with a multitude of veggies, meat, fried egg, and Korean chili paste gochjang sauce that&#39;s all supposed to be mixed up together. &#34;Bibim&#34; literally means mixed up in Korean. Kogii Kogii&#39;s bibimbap is pretty awesome.  My favorite is the spicy pork but you can&#39;t go wrong with the Bulkogii (ribeye) or Galbi (short ribs). I love the fact that I can choose which veggies I want on top. They do charge you $1 extra for a fried egg or stone pot option. I usually skip the stone pot if its a hot day. For vegetarians out there you can have your bowl topped with no meat or tofu as another option.

The fried chicken wings here are also one of my favorite things to eat and in my opinion the best Korean fried chicken in Chicagoland and may even be the best wings in Chicagoland. They are that good. You can choose either garlic soy or Seoul sassy sauce (pretty spicy). The wings are super crisp and very meaty. A small order ($5.99) which consists of 5 pieces and a bowl of rice is enough to fill me up on most days.

Check out the Korean Churros which are pan fried dduk (rice cake) topped with spicy sauce or cinnamon sugar or the deep fried Chocopie for dessert! 

Overall Kogii Kogii Express is a unique and refreshing addition to the Naperville food scene.  Parking is a bit tough to find during weekday lunch rush due to all the office workers nearby but they do have dedicated parking spot for take out orders.

I ordered the bowl and got the beef over white rice. I like that they have a vegetable bar and they let you choose your own veggies. I went with mushrooms, carrots, bean sprouts, bok choy, cucumber, and pickled radish. And of course, I added the fried egg, though I was a little put off by a $1.00 upcharge. but hey, that&#39;s not as bad as guacamole at Chipotle. The flavor of the rice and meat was excellent, especially with a heaping of the chili sauce. I recommend adding a nice portion of the sauce to add another layer of flavor.

The Korean chicken wings were pretty good. They were crispy and juicy, and I liked that they took 10 minutes to come out because that showed that they are made fresh and are not just sitting under a heat lamp. However, the garlic soy flavor was a little sweet for my taste. Next time, I&#39;d try the Seoul Sassy to add some spice.

The corn tortilla was awful.My guess is they were steamed in the microwave which makes them mushy. I&#39;m guessing the chef learned how to cook tortillas from the back of the package- but that ain&#39;t how ya do it for tacos man!!!! My tacos came sloppily arranged in a large sheet of TIN FOIL!!

The Kimchi fries were good,but once again ratios should be noted.A large amount of fries with a little bit of toppings and cheese sauce. I feel like I&#39;d have to ask for extra cheese/sour cream if I return. The fries were actually good without any toppings.

I went with a coworker on Friday for lunch.  I have to say that I was very confused by the process, and because the employees weren&#39;t really able to communicate to me what I needed to do, it kind of soured my opinion a bit.  There were a bunch of sauces at the end that I wanted to know more about but the lady behind the counter just smiled at me like I hadn&#39;t asked a question at all.  Anyway, I had the bibimbap bowl with beef and upgraded to the stone bowl and the egg for a 1$ each.  The stone bowl wasn&#39;t worth the dollar.... the rice browned a little bit, but didn&#39;t get crunchy.  I wish I had just had them put everything on, but I didn&#39;t understand that everything was included (If that just makes me a dummy, I guess too bad).

Anyway, the food was fine, once I got over the ordering stress.  The restaurant is very, very small.  The two person tables are JUST barely big enough for two trays.  Trays are required if you get a hot stone bowl.  There&#39;s no room for anything else.  They give you teeeny tiny cups for water.  Seriously - dentist swishing sized cups.  I had to get up a bunch of times to get more water.  The sound of the refrigerators for the bottles of drinks that they sell is also really loud throughout the whole restaurant.  There are a few outside tables, but all of the ones with umbrellas are for a different restaurant.  If its not super hot, then I recommend sitting outside.  It would be great if this business would get their own outside tables.

The hot stone bibimbap with egg on top was sizzling hot and flavorful as well. Definitely worth your money and time.

Food is decent not too salty as some places can be. Selection of tacos. Rice bowls, entrees, or fried chicken. The fried chicken is amazing and Carmelites like how I ate the Korean Chinese style fried chicken growing up. I recommend the garlic soy unless u can handle a very very spicy hot chicken. Tacos were definitely nowhere near the level of Del Seoul&#39;s. I&#39;d stay away. The rice bowls are done like your Chipotle ones... In a bowl where you choose all your toppings. And definitely do try their fries. Both the kimchi and kogi fries were delish!!! Haven&#39;t tried an entree yet only because I&#39;d rather make that stuff at home.

They are definitely more fast food type. The food was out fast but not so fast where it&#39;s kind of suspicious. The kimchee fries were amazing! They were nice and crispy, which I love, but they were still potato-y? If you catch my drift. The tacos were good, but gotta put the red pepper sauce they have on the table.

I personally like my chicken more crispy, but I guess my heart and health would prefer them like this haha. But the flavor was so good I didn&#39;t even care. Also, it might&#39;ve been because it had sauce on it. I usually get plain crispy chicken, so I will try that next time!

It&#39;s good.  I got the garlic-soy flavoring and it was exactly what I was looking for.  It&#39;s just wings, but that&#39;s not too bad.

Also tried the bulkogii, which was tasty.  My wife had the bibimbap with tofu, and she thought it was okay. She was a bit underwhelmed by the tofu which was cold, and maybe that&#39;s by design but it was unexpected by her.  The jap chae noodles were tasty.

Two small concerns:  The website doesn&#39;t really convey the express menu, it just has the main restaurant&#39;s menu, which is more extensive.  Also, I didn&#39;t see it explained anywhere what &#34;Kogii Fries&#34; were, and I could have asked or taken a gamble, but I had bought too much to try it out as it was.

kogii-kogii-express-naperville,Jason B.,d5fspAn96y1YZAyP3aPUSg,KIuLPpRV6OzRQ3aFSs3CNg,"Went to this place for an early dinner. The food was very good, the experience was so-so.

I got there around 4:45 and there was only one other group of two in the restaurant. The eat-in area is very small so there must do mostly carry-out business. I had never been there before, so I was a little disoriented about exactly how you ordered and how you got your food and the staff didn&#39;t really help. There were three ladies behind the register who all looked at me while I ordered (I got the bibimbap bowl with spicy pork, kimchi fries and a coke) but then none of them told me what was going on, so I just took a seat figuring someone would bring my food to me since there isn&#39;t any spot that looks like a &#34;pick-up&#34; area. Then they had me come back to get the vegetables for the bowl but didn&#39;t explain if they were all included at no charge or if I had to pay extra for others. Then they all left and took my bowl with them. Uh... OK.... Finally one lady brought my bowl back and set it on a counter behind the register. I took it back to a table but wasn&#39;t sure if they forgot my fries or if those were coming later or what. They had a bunch of coolers with drinks in them in different spots but I wasn&#39;t sure if I was supposed to just grab a bottle of coke or what. I finally just took one and no one said anything so I guess that&#39;s what I was supposed to do. I started eating my bowl and about 10 minutes later someone called &#34;order number 44&#34; which when I checked my receipt was my order number, nobody mentioned that I even had an order number when I placed my order. So the place has some obvious order flow and communication issues...

As for the food, everything was excellent. The bowl was delicious, if anything, I put too many vegetables in it. The kimchi fries, when they came, were very good. Everything was freshly made and the correct temperature. Spice-wise, I don&#39;t like things overly spicy and they had toned it down from what I was expecting, so I was happy with it but it might not have the kick you are looking for if you like a lot of heat in your Korean food. The size of the bowl with the fries and a drink were way more than I could eat. If you have two people I would recommend splitting the bowl or the fries because i didn&#39;t come close to finishing either of them.

It was a little pricey for one person for a &#34;fast-casual&#34; type dinner, my total with tax was just under $21. I would probably skip the fries next time which would have brought the cost down closer to $16-$17 which is more typical of what I would expect to spend.",22/08/16,263,3,1,1,-1,0.9073,1.323,0.71,19.965999999999998,No,2615

The layout of their restaurant reminds me of Ted&#39;s Montana Grill, another favorite of mine.  The interior has an old school restaurant-brewery feel with it&#39;s mahogany woodwork, black &amp; white photo&#39;s and random decor.  Like the other Emmett&#39;s, this one too is in a historical building which add&#39;s a lot of character.
I chose Emmett&#39;s for the beer but I&#39;ll be honest, I was just as hungry after bowling and bocce down the street.  Our waiter was quick to offer us samples of any beer and went over each in detail.  I tried both porter&#39;s (Irish and Imperial) and the Hefeweizen.  Porter&#39;s are generally a safe bet but neither struck a chord.  The Hefe was excellent though, and saved the day.
Dinner...I had the turkey club with sweet potato fries, a staple in my dinner diet.  Both were top notch.

New Year&#39;s Eve 2015 was a very special one for us - it was sort of our informal 10-year high school reunion, and we had people coming from very far away for the event. We chose Emmett&#39;s because we&#39;d spent several New Year&#39;s Eves there before, and we thought it a nice place for our larger-than-usual group.

All I can say is that the quality of service was great. The food is always great, but what really stuck out to us was the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to make sure our unique event was special. We had 17 adults and 4 children, and were seated in the nicely-decorated and -lit upstairs room at a long table towards the outside wall. It was perfect. There were other tables up there that saw guests here and there through the night, but we were mostly alone, which worked well for everyone, I think, in that it was very reception-like. It was like a private event. We had room to move around the table, and room to gather before dinner for a makeshift &#34;cocktail hour,&#34; and we didn&#39;t have to worry about being too bothersome to other guests or restricted in our own frivolity.

The 12+ separate checks were handled with ease as well, and we didn&#39;t have to worry about a thing. Everything went smoothly and quickly, and our waitstaff was just great. Everything about the night ended up wonderful, and Emmett&#39;s was a big part of that.

Thank you! We shall return!",04/01/16,157,5,2,5,25,6.0357,4.1370000000000005,0.261,11.600999999999999,No,1510
emmetts-brewing-co-west-dundee,Owen B.,Zgz1eVxuSVq4-uzXqueSGQ,ArrK29TRXcnzFcEQznll-g,This is a nice place in West Dundee.  Nice atmosphere and the service we received at the bar was good.  We were only there for a few beers and the ones we had were OK.  Nothing wrong with my experiences but just not my taste.  I had the Octoberfest and my wife had the IPA.  Both were good but I would try something different next time.  We didn&#39;t have food but the meals we saw looked and smelled quite good.  I would go again given the atmosphere and to try another few of their beers.  I would recommend giving this place a try.,28/09/15,54,3,2,3,17,2.9322999999999997,1.791,0.0,6.209,No,535

A) Drink copious amounts of strong French press coffee-yes.
B) Read a few pages of The Sympathizer-OK.
3) Drive to Gat Guns and obliterate several terrorist themed targets-Of course, what&#39;s more patriotic than that?
D) Follow that unbridled pleasure with a visit to Emmett&#39;s Brewing, based on the &#34;Nearby&#34; setting and the favorable reviews on the Yelp Mobile App.

My fianc̩ and I went on a Tuesday. They have a taco Tuesday special where their tacos are only $2. I ordered a fried fish taco and a soft pretzel. The pretzel was delicious but a little pricey for how small it was. The cheese dipping sauce was yummy. The fish taco was so crispy! It was quite a larger serving size and had a good fish to breading ratio. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to eat 2 of them for lunch without being overly stuffed. My fianc̩ had their veggie burger which he said was good and the patty was substantial for being a veggie patty. 

We also had a flight of their beers. We asked them to replace the IPA that normally came in the flight with the Munich Dunkel. We really liked the Munich light, oatmeal stout, and Munich Dunkel.

I&#39;ve been to the Emmett&#39;s in Palatine before and tried the red ale so this time I went with one of the seasonal brews--Honey Rye Ale.  It was light and refreshing.  My second beer was the regular Oatmeal Stout.  This one was much darker and heavier but had great flavor.  My friend graciously allowed me to try her smoked beer (hallis, I believe) and it was very....interesting.  The smoked flavor was quite overpowering.

I was having the hardest time deciding what to order for my meal.  I took the advice of another reviewer and ordered the cheddar ale soup with the pretzel roll and loved it.  It helped warm me back up too! I also ordered the small plate size of the pork belly taco with sweet potato fries.  The fries were perfectly battered and nice and salty.  The pork belly taco was just okay and the flavor just wasn&#39;t quite right to me. I love the small plate concept and was excited that it was on the menu as I get to try more things.  I felt like I had the perfect amount of food.

We sat in the pub/bar portion which was clean, nice, and classier than I&#39;d expect of this sort of place. Our server was nice though nothing extraordinary, she was kind enough to explain to us the differences in some of their own brews, which one of our party ordered (the Hefeweizen, a rather banana-y tasting beer). Gave us some time with our menus, a good variety of tasty sounding meals, varying from salads to sandwiches to cuts of meat, pretty typical spread.
    Food comes. I got a Chicken and raspberry salad, topped with blue cheese, walnuts (as I recall), craisins, pear slices, chicken (duh), and a raspberry vinaigrette. Salad was in theory good, though it needed some work. Go a little easier on the craisins and that chicken was comparable to the leg of the table we sat at: dry. It was alright though, just needs some work to make it great. Boyfriend got a Cobb salad. As I recall he had no complaints, good, traditional Cobb salad. Boyfriend&#39;s brother: got a club sandwich. You have varying options for your side, he got the sweet potato fries. So. Good! He enjoyed the sandwich as well. Friend: he got some sort of burger with an egg on it, bacon on top, and the white truffle fries. White truffle fries= delicious (this place has it down with the fries apparently). Bacon?.... we weren&#39;t quite sure what it was. Wasn&#39;t quite on the burger and it looked more like ground up... something.
    Bathrooms were nice. Clean. I had a moment of surprise when walking up to the door and it had the picture of the guy and girl on it, so I thought &#34;wow, I haven&#39;t been in a co-ed bathroom since France!&#34;, but low and behold, it was just the gateway door to two other doors leading into segregated bathrooms. There was the end of a d̩j-poo moment (lol, sorry, poo pourri reference).
    I&#39;m not often in West Dundee, so this isn&#39;t exactly a go-to place for me (though I think there are other locations...), but it seems to be a hit or a miss sort of place, more often a hit is my guess, so go try some local brews!",05/07/14,284,3,2,5,16,7.217700000000001,6.654,0.9540000000000001,20.392000000000003,No,2154

As far as appetizers, I was extremely disappointed when I ordered the Walleye bites for 12 dollars and received a fancy garnished plate with 5 tiny tenders as big as my thumb, now I understand they may prepare everything by hand, but come on! For 12 dollars I should of been able to down at least 20 of those things with my beer. Other starters I&#39;ve had are the calamari (fresh &amp; excellent, small portion), and the cheddar ale soup with a pretzel twist, which I highly recommended.
 
       As for the beer I really have no complaints, they are also a little pricey, but they claim they have to charge those amounts because all of the ingredients are imported (mehh..could still lower a buck or two). Being I&#39;m not a fan of real hoppy brews, the Munich Light is probably my favorite, though I must say I really enjoy the Red Ale, as well as their seasonal Pilsener, I would suggest ordering the beer sampler so you can just decide for yourself. 
 
       Overall the atmosphere in Emmett&#39;s is very warm and relaxed, from the moment you walk through the doors and see the giant beer tanks in the windows, to the beautiful decorations/pictures, and the solid bar where you can view downtown Dundee while your sipping a pint.

I was pleased that we got what only could be called superior service; anything and everything that we asked for was taken care of smoothly and efficiently. This made our meal so much more pleasant and enjoyable!

I tried the turkey burger which was a treat being topped with just the right amount of pesto sauce. I chose sweet potato fries for my side and would order them again. Both items were fresh and tasty.

I have to say that I was slightly under-whelmed by Emmett&#39;s beers, but they were a solid 8-9 on a 10 point scale. I will have to visit again when I am not having a meal so that I can just focus on the taste of the beer.

One person in our group ordered carrot cake and was brought a slice that looked like a quarter of a cake. Beware if you are not a hearty dessert eater or don&#39;t have at least 3 friends to help you polish off this mountain of a confection.

The only negative is that parking is somewhat sparse around Emmett&#39;s. There is a fair sized parking lot behind their building but it was absolutely full at 2 PM on a Sunday. I am not sure where all the people that belonged to those cars went?

The bar (on a Tuesday) is packed, which I later learned, through my caring server, Danielle, was due in part to a beer club brat event. It seemed counterintuitive for this fine dining establishment, but it is clear that they know where their true loyalty lies. 

I started with the pale ale, which is described as having a &#34;big hop flavor, aroma and bitterness, which are all supported be substantial malt character.&#34; This beer did, in fact, live up to the description and was a great way to start my evening. 

From there, I ordered the Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna. It was cooked rare and served with a creamy lightly dressed slaw and wasabi aioli. The hot wasabi was the perfect pairing to the cool slaw. 

At this point in my meal, I remembered that I only had 1GB of data left on my monthly plan, so I asked if they had WIFI. Danielle wasn&#39;t sure, so she went to check and told me it should come up under &#39;AleHouse.&#39; Although it did not come up on my phone, I have to believe that something was either wrong with the router because it seems like everyone in the area had free WIFI. Perhaps they just don&#39;t get enough people in their fine establishment that care about that sort of thing. 

My wonderful waitress, Danielle, then talked to me about the entree section of the menu. She suggested a few items including the tortellini and stuffed chicken, but I finally settled on the Flat Iron Steak. It came with the option of soup or salad, which prompted me, on this cooler summer day, to choose the house cheddar ale soup (you can&#39;t go wrong with a soup that has beer in it at a brewery, right?). 

The soup was a good choice. It was creamy and flavorful. It paired adequately with the delectable house made pretzel, although I would have preferred that one of them was a little less salty. It was full bodied  flavor upon flavor, which made it difficult to enjoy without one of their many handcrafted beers to wash it down (not that I didn&#39;t mind an excuse to drink on of their amazing beers). 

In between my soup and meal, I ordered a red ale, which was exactly what I was expecting. My flat iron steak came and was cooked to perfection- rare (of course). The potatoes were done to the way that I enjoy them- less cream and butter and more potato and flavor. The asparagus, although unseasoned, was refreshing on the palette. Again, my only wish is that there was less salt in the dish. The steak&#39;s Chimichurri was heavy on the NaCl and even though the potatoes were not that salty, it still felt that way since the steak was coated. I will say, the chef, Emanuel, did a fine, dare I not say stellar,  job of cooking and presenting the dish. 

JJ, the manager on this Tuesday evening, looks young but is very personable. After talking to him, it was clear that I should recommend that readers come to the Heritage Festival partially hosted in their back parking lot this fall. 

Overall, Emmett&#39;s has a winning combination of epic brewery, very attentive service, and food that (although, in my personal opinion could have been seasoned differently) is very tasty and unique for this particular area. You will not find a restaurant that serves dinner in Dundee that does it better than this.

EDIT: After dinner, I went to the bar where Melissa literally remembered me from 8 months ago. She even knew I wasn&#39;t wearing my glasses! You can tell that she cares about the people that she serves and is very aware of the varying social dynamics that come with a place as unique as Emmett&#39;s. If there is one shining star to this restaurant brewery, it is her. &#34;Thank you&#34; is all that I can say. Prompt and accommodating personal service.

The meat on the bone was awesome, the other 90% was dry and under-seasoned.  Come to think of it, my potatoes and mushy vegetables were under-seasoned as well.  The beer was awesome!

I arrived later than some of my friends and it seemed that they were waiting a while for a table that could fit all of us (8 people). Finally, we were seated outside. Our waitress told us about their famous Red Ale which they had cask conditioned. My boyfriend, being the beer aficionado, ordered one while I had the regular Red. Come to find out when the waitress returned that they ran out of the cask conditioned ale and they probably should have taken it down from their chalk board. Yeah, probably. The regular Red was good. Had a good amount of bitterness to it but not overwhelming. I also had the Victory Pale Ale which was pretty good. Again, it&#39;s a little hoppy, so don&#39;t get it if you don&#39;t like hops. 

The food was okay. My burger and fries was good but then again it&#39;s pretty hard to mess that up. I got it because it was the cheapest thing on the menu. My bf decided to get the pork tenderloin for $17. That&#39;s pretty pricey for a little tavern restaurant and he was pretty disappointed with it. Only three little pork squares! For that price at a place like this, there should have been way more on the plate. 

My friends held out until 9pm and ordered from the late night menu which I definitely would have done if I wasn&#39;t so famished. For $1.50, you can get a mini burger with a side of fries. That&#39;s a great deal. You may not be getting a lot of food, but you can order something else and you might end up getting more food that way for the price than ordering off the menu.

I&#39;m not one to go back - I always like checking out places I&#39;ve never been to before.  However - hubby and I do seem to end up back at Emmet&#39;s every couple of months and a beer, and depending on hunger, appetizers and/or dinner.

So - ended up there this weekend.  There&#39;s something comforting to me about the historic building and the worn patina of the beatifully done interior.   I like the photos on the wall, the layout, the people watching - And the beer is really really good.

I had Lobster fetuccini (sp?).  It was delicious.   So was the beer.  Hubby had chicken-caesar salad - not bad, but not great - it&#39;s touted as &#34;traditional&#34; caesar salad, but there was not an anchovy to be tasted - so, if you like anchovy style dressing, skip ordering here.  If you like creamy caesar dressing, then maybe give it a try.  (For the record - we both like the anchovies - hard to find....  if anyone knows where to find that, send me a message!)

They seemed to be overwhelmed at the time although it was between lunch and dinner when I arrived just after 2pm. There was a half-filled water carafe occupying the empty bar space I sat down nearest and a pile of lunch plates just in front of me on the bar. A couple of locals loudly conversed a chair away from me and at least one of them, seemed to have been over-served. I was greeted promptly by the bar tender and the specials were explained. I ordered an Oktoberfest and it was solid. A traditional Amber M_rzen, malty, robust and highly quaffable. I ordered the Sausage En Croute appetizer from the specials menu and it was tasty with a wonderful, cheesy beer sauce to dip the pastry encased sausage. I chased my app, with their cask conditioned oatmeal stout. It was cellar cool and of perfect temperature, kudos to the staff for understanding how to serve a stout. This was a great beer that perfectly complimented the 3-wing trio. All of which were spicy, savory, sticky and enjoyable. I followed with the Dark Helmet black ale which disappointed. The DH was watery, lackluster and under-hopped. I recommend it to Lite beer connoisseur&#39;s only. Finally, nearing the end of my meal the pile of spent platters in front of me was cleared, but I felt underwhelmed with the casual, lack of housekeeping. The bar was poorly organized and liquor bottles were erratically stationed... To the point that I was put off, there was a readily apparent lack of pride for the workspace...

HOWEVER- the service was the worst i have ever had. I am a waitress myself, and I am definitely not one to ever complain. But to have a server mess up 3 out of 5 checks is ridiculous. Then, she left one drink off of my tab, which I didn&#39;t notice, but we already paid, then brought another check back to me and said sorry you have to pay again. THEN, another couple had 2 beers on their check that they never got, and when they told her that they never got those beers (all of the glasses were still on the table because she never took a single one away) she said &#34;im sorry i cant change the bill again..&#34; so basically, &#34;you have to pay for those beers even though you didn&#39;t actually ever get them&#34; 

Not only were the bills messed up repeatedly, she didn&#39;t know the menu at all, and had no idea what products they had or didn&#39;t have. One guest didn&#39;t get a drink for 40 minutes because every time she ordered they were out of it. She then decided to just go standard and for a coors light. The server said ok, and 10 minutes later came back and said &#34;i&#39;m sorry we only carry bud light and miller light.&#34; I&#39;m sorry, but those are standard beers that anyone should know if its carried or not. 

The manager was very kind and took care of everything in the end because after the server argued with us she wouldn&#39;t come back to our table.

Because this is a negative review I will only comment on what I experienced directly. The service is bad. Sever was short and only visited the table 5 times in total. At least 10-15 minutes between visits. No refills and didn&#39;t check on order accuracy. took initial order, food order, picked up plates, dropped check without asking for refills or anything, and dropped the credit card receipt. That&#39;s no effort or really busy/understaffed. I didn&#39;t even get a chance to bull shit her and tell her the food is &#34;ok.&#34; She was just absent. The server in me struggled to even tip 15%, but she wasn&#39;t rude or mean so oh well. The service was not even the worst part. The food: I ordered the Kobe Burger, med rare, sweet potato fries. What I got? I&#39;m not really sure, but it wasn&#39;t Kobe beef. It was definitely a frozen patty of some sort, perfectly round. It had a frozen patty texture and appearance on the inside. I&#39;d be willing to bet a testicle that this &#34;Kobe&#34; beef patty came from a box or plastic bag. Of course they over cooked it. The taste resembled a somewhere between a Mcdonalds and Portillo&#39;s burger. Not terrible, but nowhere worth 14.95 and absolutely not KOBE beef. For some reason I got a full huge slice of onion (there&#39;s not a person on earth that has that much onion on a burger) and no lettuce. Even the person applying the condiments doesn&#39;t care for this place. The presentation: 0, I didn&#39;t even get cheesy parsley on my plate, no effort. The sweet potato fries were frozen fries, no doubt as the middle of a few of mine were actually almost frozen. Presentation: 0, not even an attempt. The tuna taco was ok, a good deal at $2, but what isn&#39;t? If you&#39;re looking for a place for a good burger and beer skip this place. I feel like I got robbed for $60. There&#39;s my piece.

The first time we ordered appetizers, beer, and a burger and the prime rib sandwich.  The apps were pretty good: the cheese and meat plate were very tasty, the pretzels were yummy, but the walleye nuggets were greasy and small.  My question is: how do you screw up a burger or prime rib sandwich?  Well, they did.  The burger was greasy, tasteless, and the bun stale.  The prime rib was rubber and tasteless.  The beer, however, was great. 
We thought we&#39;d give it a second go and only order apps.  Well, that was a mistake.  We ordered the pretzels again (great) and the nachos with beef.  They took plain old beef, fried it up, and put it on the nachos.  No spice, no flavor, nothing.  The chips were stale.  The only saving graces of this experience was how accommodating the staff was.  When I told the young lady that the chips were stale (I didn&#39;t try the beef on it yet) she immediately took the plate back and brought out a fresh batch and the beer was good.

I&#39;m not sure if they are part of a chain (it screams Firkin &amp; Pheasant corporate entity) but it had a certain homey vibe none the less. 

Our waitress, whoever she was, was by far the perkiest and most professional server I&#39;ve ever encountered in the greater Fox Valley Area so Manager, it was the shorter of the two working on 3/4/11 at lunch time.

We were on a tight schedule so no extras, however, I wanted to steal the beautiful pretzel sticks parading by but me and the girls opted out! 

Our food was decent by not only FV standards but by my ridiculously high standards in general. Kobe burger was so deliriously delish I actually stole a bite from my bff. My club (sans ham) was tasty and filling while my other companion enjoyed some very passable fish tacos. Sides offer fries, sweet potato fries, fruit or cole slaw and while the fruit was mostly honeydew the appropriate (I mean not overwhelming amount) serving of fries and the sorta sweet slaw were hits. I was kinda glad the fries weren&#39;t abundant because I would have eaten every one so the serving size was just perfect. 

Huge beer selection, decent wines by the glass and they were pimping the Hurricanes on Fat Friday but alas, no drinking for us because we had to workity work work later.

Beer: 5+ Stars

Food: 3 Stars

Hence the 4 overall.

I&#39;ve been a regular patron at Emmett&#39;s since the place opened 10 or so years ago. My review is going to be biased towards this place as I love great craft beer and this place delivers in spades. The beer (especially the hoppier ales) are some of the finest examples one can find anywhere at any price. Having been across this great nation of ours sampling craft brews throughout, Emmett&#39;s still stands up as one of the finest such institutions in the US.

Strong words, I know.

But Ryan Clooney (the brewmaster) is a true master of his art. If you&#39;re a beer geek/connoisseur/fan and are within an hour of this place YOU MUST GO. Folks you&#39;ll thank me for this. 

Many years ago the food would have equaled this rating, but since losing their original chef, the food has been hit or miss ever since. There are still great epicurean moments to be had, but there are quite a few swing and a miss instances as well.

The beer selection was limited beyond the house brews, but for an occasional stop by that isn&#39;t a factor.  The lack of options would prevent it from being a regular stop.  The menu is standard bar fare with pretenses of gourmet. Service was good, actually better than I expected as the bartender was working the entire room but still managed to be responsive to both myself as well as the other groups around.

As this was my first visit, I started with the sampler platter of the house brews.  I&#39;m a big hoppy beer fan and I was impressed by the Pale and Red Ales.  The rest were fine, but not my cup of tea.  After finishing the sampler platter, the bartender let me sample the two seasonal brews.  The Second St. Amber was good, while the other wasn&#39;t memorable (as I can&#39;t recall the name right now).  Overall good beers, not great ones.

I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with the upgraded truffle fries.  The sandwich was tasty.  They didn&#39;t smother the sandwich with BBQ, the meat was allowed to carry the sandwich.  The truffles fires were quite good, much better than the ones at the Lucky Monk.

This came with a buffalo chicken slider, pulled pork and coleslaw slider, and a brie burger slider. They were all delish. My sister ordered a beer (don&#39;t remember the name, it was very light and hoppy) but she wasn&#39;t impressed. Definitely a little pricey, but food wasn&#39;t disappointing and service was efficient. My only complaint is that the bartender (who was our server) spent a lot of time watching a game that was on behind the bar and flirting with the hostess right near our table to the point that it was really kind of distracting- a little unprofessional and I&#39;m glad nothing went wrong with the food or timing cause I would have probably complained, at least jokingly,  about it before we left (at least be a little more discreet and attentive to your tables). We laughed about it at the time, and I would go back when I&#39;m back in this area or try their additional locations.",25/01/15,139,4,1,2,-6,1.3519,1.445,0.45899999999999996,8.096,No,1256

First time, awesome experience.  Service was most helpful, drinks were delicious, and bison burger was big, juicy, and delicious.

Second time, not so great.  Service was decent but the food quality dropped.  

Third time was the make it or break it, and it broke.  Ordered a Tanqueray martini on the rocks, my drink of choice.  It tasted watered down and lifeless.  Wondering if it was the &#34;rocks&#34; to blame I asked for another, this time served shaken.  Same lifeless tasteless martini.  How is it possible to have a weak martini???  I did!

Remembering how delicious the bison burger was I ordered it, med rare.  Burger came out medium, perfectly round, and perfectly dry.  I asked if it was fresh or frozen, I was assured it was fresh.  No way.  

My wife ordered the sea bass special......and realized why it was the special.  An fish that is ordinarily very mild came out quite &#34;fishy&#34;.

After two weak martinis and a bottle of wine I figured I would end with a double espresso, twist.  &#34;Sorry, sir, we don&#39;t have an espresso machine.  I settled for a very weak cup of coffee.

I think a struggling business has caused them to cut some corners and trim some expense.  It is too bad because I thought the place had real potential.

Last time didn&#39;t go as well. It was a Sunday evening and it wasn&#39;t crowded. I am not a beer drinker so I can&#39;t comment on the beer selection but the wine selection is good.

He made an appearance so we ordered, I decided on the beer battered cod and it came with soup,  which was chicken with rice. They were good and satisfying. But our server was just terrible.

The beer selection is pretty decent and the food is cheap and certainly falls into the &#34;bar food&#34; category. Meaning burgers, chicken tenders, nachos, etc. The food we had was really good, but you also have to factor in that after 3 beers any food they put in front of me is going to have an elevated status. 

You are also pretty much surrounded by huge flat screens in every direction the second you walk in the door. If you happen to be a sports person, this is a great option. Assuming this place has NFL Sunday ticket, this might be my new post up spot for the coming season to keep tabs on my fantasy rosters. They also have all the UFC fights on pay per view, which is another huge draw for me.

I came here on a Friday night with about 8 ladies. We were seated promptly but that was the only prompt action that was taken the whole night. We waited 5 minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink, closer to 15 minutes before we got our drinks (and our drinks didn&#39;t even come out all at once, pretty ridiculous if you ask me). Our later guests had to wait another 15 minutes before their drinks came.

Our server Jessica was not attentive, did not come by to ask us if we were doing alright. And when she did and we asked for water and napkins, it seemed like it was inconveniencing her and she didn&#39;t even bring us napkins. 

Our checks were separated, which we asked before hand and she said it would be fine. Fine if she actually knew who was ordering what, very rookie mistake (pun intended).

I&#39;m not quite sure I&#39;ve ever gotten group gratuity at a bar and I&#39;m not sure I was happy about it especially with the service that we received.

She also dropped my card along the way and came back and told me I didn&#39;t add my card to the check I handed her... really? Once she found it next to our table, she didn&#39;t even apologize for her mistake.

rookies-all-american-pub-and-grill-hoffman-estates,Thomas T.,ieRXh0f_Tax7fjnGE-C-Tg,R4cZ_O-BTBRK0Zz_VbQqSA,"Average sports bar. Came here one night to just hang out with some people and watch some basketball. It&#39;s good for that. Lots of TVs. They have drink specials too. which is always a plus. On this night they had a live DJ that was music video spinning so that was pretty sweet. 4 stars for the nightlife aspect.

2 stars for the food though. So it averages out to 3. I went on like a Friday so they had the 50 cent mini tacos. These are like literally mini, like the size of a chicken nugget. Not good quality either, tasted like it was microwaved. So I ordered a bunch of those cause I didn&#39;t think they were that small but it was no where near filling me up. Got the cheese and sausage panzerotti which is pretty muc ha big pzone. You can&#39;t go wrong wit ha Pzone, but this one seemed huge but was mostly filled with air. It tasted good, but had like barely any meat. Was pretty disappointed since it was like 9 bucks.

Service was alright. Our waitress was nice, a little slow though. Didn&#39;t check up on us too often. We had a bigger than usually group, probably like 12 of us. Mostly we ordered drinks, but she didn&#39;t think to have us split the check. So we had to go through it and split it ourselves. No harm no foul though, just a slight pain.",03/12/12,152,3,1,5,8,4.286300000000001,3.982,1.287,18.731,No,1268

My friend and I went right after church, hoping to catch the Bulls game. When we arrived, there were plenty of seats opened. Our waitress, I forgot her name, was very nice helping us out. Usually in the past I would always order burgers since that&#39;s what they&#39;re known for, but today was different. My friend and the waitress said the pizza was good. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and man, it was good. It was also a good deal considering it was just for the two of us. I&#39;ve read that sometimes, there are specials on pizzas. I will consider getting it next time I go. I should also mention, like the other locations, that I love the $1 monthly specials.

I went for a birthday celebration with my boyfriends family, about 8-11 people total. I called to see if they took reservations, and I was a little upset. However I saw a comment box and sent in a request/question, submitted it, and literally about 30 second later I got a response from John Alimissis stating that he can accommodate our party no problem. After a couple of emails it was all set. Definitely a perk!

When we walked in early, they were prepared and sat us down with no problems. We had a server named Brie who was super awesome, friendly, and overall a fantastic waitress!! She was very attentive and even brought me a birthday sundae!

I would have to say that this is a place I will definitely be coming back to, especially for the upcoming football season!!

Boneless buffalo wings were on special for 50cents. They were tiny! More like popcorn chicken! Single bites only.
Hubby and I split a taco pizza. Was the driest pizza I&#39;ve ever eaten. Crust was dense and tough. Topped with dried out re fried beans, a sprinkling of cheddar and some pico. We let the server know it wasn&#39;t good. She said, &#34;I&#39;ve never had it. So you don&#39;t want the rest boxed?&#34;

I work in, like, the Bermuda Circle. It&#39;s a giant circle going as far west as 59 and as far east as Woodfield Mall. It&#39;s Bermuda because my money magically disappears and my waistline magically increases. And every couple years or so, I grow a new chin. I know all the little food &#34;barrios&#34; around my work because my coworkers and I eat out every day just to get out of the office.

Anyway, Rookies is part of this &#34;barrio&#34; that includes Red Robin, BW3, and a lot of typical lunch places (well...it&#39;s typical if you&#39;ve been eating there for 6 years). Rookies was one of the newer additions who enticed us with $1 Burgers a month before it opened.

Anyway, you walk in to this place and get the best part...POPCORN! Good ol&#39; movie theater style popcorn. I could seriously just go and eat popcorn and drink Diet Coke all day. Oh yeah, and I&#39;ve seen 670 AM The Score there a couple times during football season which was kinda cool too.

It&#39;s a nice looking sports bar, but more of an ADD type of sports bar than a &#34;Chicago Games On The Big Screen&#34; kind. All the TVs are about the same size and they might be like 46&#34; plasmas, but they&#39;re dwarfed by the place&#39;s high ceilings and what not. It&#39;s a nice casual sports bar that&#39;s very big and open so sports fans and hungry non-sports fans can cohabit the place.

Oh, right...the food.

So, as I&#39;ve said, I eat around these places a lot, and even though Rookies isn&#39;t anywhere near my favorite, it&#39;s just another choice in the daily lunch rotation. With so many opportunities to eat here, I have eaten just about everything off of this menu. You know how you have that favorite burger at Red Robin or that favorite sauce at BW3? I was trying to find that here, but man, I&#39;ve struck out like 15 times! There is NOTHING on this menu worth mentioning. Everything&#39;s average, everything&#39;s mediocre. I&#39;ve never tried the $1 burger, but man, if the $9 is that bad, I don&#39;t even want to know how bad $1 is!

SANTA FE COBB SALAD
You know cheap salad when you see one. I mean, Wendy&#39;s salads have more respect for themselves than this! It&#39;s real easy to picture too. You know what a cobb salad looks like, right? Well, now imagine that it was served to you at Denny&#39;s or IHOP at 4AM. Now you know what it&#39;s like here!

GYRO PLATE
If there&#39;s anything that I&#39;ve actually ordered more than once, other than Diet Coke, it&#39;s this. I mean, it&#39;s hard to mess up, really. Nothing special about it, though, that would separate it from any other place. 

BBQ RIBS &amp; CHICKEN
I decided one day, for dinner, that I was going to splurge and get the most expensive thing. This is actually fried chicken and ribs, not grilled. The skin on the chicken is pretty good; it&#39;s very crunchy (not crispy...YES there&#39;s a difference!) but if you&#39;re lucky enough to actually get meat, it&#39;s pretty dry. The ribs weren&#39;t too bad. They were actually &#34;Fall off the bone&#34; as advertised. I wouldn&#39;t mind the ribs again, but I&#39;m not much for &#39;em anyway.

So there you go. Want to get a drink and catch a game you&#39;re mildly interested in, come to Rookies. Want free popcorn? Rookies. Anything else, you&#39;re better off skipping this one.",29/04/11,475,2,3,5,61,8.943700000000002,6.303,1.3949999999999998,36.302,No,3676

The layout of the bar was spacious and it looked as if there was plenty of seating to handle a good crowd, but since we were there to watch the game, we sat up at the bar.  Our Bartender was attentive and friendly, always checking on us to see if we needed any refills.  Miller bottles were $3 each...not cheap, but not unreasonable, either.  But the Burger special that they&#39;d offered forces me to raise an average rating of 3 stars up one more.  For $1, you can get a 1/2 lb burger with all the fixin&#39;s along with a basket full of chips (easily an $8 or $9 entree anywhere else).  VERY tasty sandwich and yes, only one dollar!

Plenty of TVs around to make for a decent sports bar although a big screen or two might&#39;ve been nice.  Still, great food, great specials and attentive bartenders made our experience here a good one!",20/01/13,115,4,2,4,11,3.0688999999999997,1.334,0.0,7.6659999999999995,No,935
rookies-all-american-pub-and-grill-hoffman-estates,Tobin h.,UkAiuv_3y3ciM3V_BFlIZA,u3eRZnGdt_1AW68vYQTMKA,"I will start with a positive...this bar exceeded expectations with great service and magnificent value. I had some reservations walking in because I was told the owner(s) (at least in the St. Charles location) were very frugal if not downright cheap, and they only gave real effort to daily regulars, not exactly a warm bar to walk in to. That may be the truth but I can readily proclaim that my barkeep, Jaime D. (as it said on my receipt because they don&#39;t wear name-tags, which, by the way, is great...I&#39;m there for service and if that service-person is good, I will make it a point to learn their name), anyway, Jaime D. was a top ten beer slinger of all time. She just had her arms wrapped all the way around the customer experience...and I say that not as a male looking at a &#39;perty&#39; girl but one who was with a female colleague that got equal attention. The food was a disappointment. I ordered fish fry hoping it was a nice battered cod but it was a square piece of filet-o-fish pulled straight out of the US foods box stored in the freezer. The clam chowder was salty and off. With that negative being said, I would go back, order up some simple wings and I believe this would be a great place to watch a game and have just enough beers to need a cab ride home!

I don&#39;t think I will be returning here. The food overall was some what decent. 
The cheese on the cheese fries was very watered down and tasted like it came out of a can. 
The boneless wings were okay, except they were very small (looked like baby mcnuggets) and the sauce appeared to be poured right on top of them vs cooked in the sauce.  
The mini burgers were perhaps a step above what McDonalds offers, but not much more.
The chicken wrap was best summarized by my wife as &#34;different&#34;.
