Time of my visit: Lunch

Let me start by saying, this was not my first time here...  I remembered why it took me this long to come back...  It might be awhile before I come back again...

I always liked little moms &amp; pops type places.  My first test is always to try the gyro.  I ordered gyro, fries and a drink.  Total came under $8 with tax, I thought that was reasonable.  My first reaction was to reach for my AMEX, oops they didn&#39;t take it.  That was a strike one!  Look, I get it, it&#39;s expensive to take that card, but either take them all or be a cash only.  They were busy, so it took them a few minutes to get to me.  I asked my order to be for here and instead I get it to go, at least they apologized.  Normally, it would not be a big deal, but I have yet to get my order correctly at this place (usually I get no onions on my gyro, since I have to go back to work, so either screw no onions up or something like for here or to go).

On to the food, the fries were average and nothing special.  Gyro meat was a bit dry and average.  I have had better gyros.

Honestly, I am not sure when I&#39;ll come back again, but I will try something else and some point, I just need to remember not to reach for my AMEX.  Overall C-.",31/08/16,157,3,1,1,3,0.2799,0.8840000000000001,0.7929999999999999,13.322000000000001,No,1278

They offer just about everything you would expect from a good hot dog joint, and I&#39;ve never had anything bad off their menu. 

Their steak sandwich is killer, the burgers are good, they also have really, really good gyros. They also offer tacos, burritos, and that have menudo on the weekends.

I got a cheeseburger and fries with a horchata. Because I could. It set me back $6.72, which is nothing short of amazing if you keep track of beef prices like I do.

The burger was pretty good. It&#39;s hard for me to describe a run-of-the-mill, hole-in-the-wall burger without using more hyphens, so I&#39;ll just say that it was a good burger. Fresh lettuce and nice, melty cheese.

The fries tasted slightly off. I can&#39;t tell you how, because my wife didn&#39;t think they tasted off, but to me I thought maybe some of the flavors from other fried foods leaked into the oil.

The horchata was very, very good, cold, cinnamon-y and exactly what I was looking for.

Overall though, it&#39;s pretty difficult to beat Diana&#39;s - which, by the way, appears to be run by a Hispanic dude, and I wasn&#39;t sure if red hots were actually on the menu - at this price point. I&#39;d come back.",18/05/15,111,4,2,3,19,2.4192,2.41,0.398,9.192,No,930

The hot dogs are their specialty. Typical Vienna dog but they do it all so well. It comes with fries at no extra charge. I have had their gyros, tamales and as I mentioned hot dogs. All were good and I trust that everything else in there menu, which is huge by the way, is going to be just as good.

When you walk in you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s very hot inside as the cooking equipment is very closely packed into the front. When I went to Diana&#39;s I ordered the hot dog.

The hot dog comes with fries and is a skinless vienna beef dog. The bun was a regular non-poppy seed bun. The pickle was cut thinly but was not quite long enough to get pickle in every bite. It was light on mustard and relish but had a decent amount of onions. The relish included was not the neon green style found at most Chicago style hot dog joints, but wasn&#39;t too sour either. The peppers included weren&#39;t too hot and complimented the dog nicely. The bun wasn&#39;t particularly soft, but it wasn&#39;t hard either.

The fries included were thick, they were fairly cripsy on the outside and had a decent potato filling. They weren&#39;t too salty, but were a bit on the greasy side. 

Overall this was an average at best Chicago style hot dog. The light condiments, regular bun and so so fries included keep it from reaching the three star plateau. Not awful, but I&#39;ve definitely had better.",20/06/12,140,2,1,3,-1,2.3491,1.6139999999999999,0.088,13.298,No,1220

Their gyros are awesome, it is a very generous portion of meat, tomato, onion and &#34;gyro sauce&#34; as they like to refer to it, and if you order the plate (comes with fries and a drink) you&#39;ll definitely be walking away full (make sure to grab some Louisiana hot sauce for them fries mm mm). 

Their hot dogs and cheese steak sandwiches I would recommend next, the hot dogs are classic nothing extraordinary but their sandwiches are, I definitely recommend a try. Finally, their menudo on Saturday and Sunday is extremely tasty. Although sometimes they sell out quickly due to phone in orders, I got their today at 10:09 am (they open at 10 am) and they were already sold out, yeah its that good.

I&#39;ve been here three times now , my latest visit I accidentally forgot to order something Vegan. I got to my seat outside, unwrapped it and realized I messed up (100% my fault).

Protein bar has a wide variety of options and almost everything that  can be made vegan is indicated clearly on the menu.

There are a couple things to watch out for with protein bar, namely that it is crazy expensive for a lunch option Kama only rivaled by options like an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet. If you order their barrito and also get some soup you can expect to be paying around $14. I would consider that not unreasonable downtown, but that&#39;s a lot for Schaumburg.

However you prounounce it (hint: &#34;keen-wah&#34; is correct), there&#39;s plenty of it here!

Although I was wary of Protein Bar at first, it&#39;s become one of my semi-favorite nearby-ish spots to go to if I&#39;m feeling like splurging a little bit on portions of delicious quinoa or a veggie juice.

In the few times I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve tried:

- Greenberry Juice
- The Sears Sucker smoothie
- Pesto Quinoa Bowl
- Denver Scramble

DRINKS:

Protein Bar&#39;s smoothies are all fruits and proteins (mixed with choice of milk). I asked for some veggies (spinach) and they had no problem putting it in. However, the smoothie was terrible -- way too watery. Not getting one of those again. 

On the other hand, the raw juices are packed with veggies -- the Greenberry juice is amazing. It was so good, that I went back again a couple days later just to get more.

FOOD:

The Denver Scramble was OK. Not that wonderful. It lacked flavor, and was way too simple for what I paid for it. Yet... the pesto bowl was phenomenal! It was so good, in fact, that I found a recipe and ended up making my own at home. (Oops... probably not good for business if I make it at home instead of going out, but thats how much it impressed me!)

The only problem with all of these foods? They&#39;re not filling. You drop $10-20 on some hit or miss food that doesn&#39;t fill you up. Yes, it&#39;s packed with protein; yes, it&#39;s healthy; yes, it&#39;s yummy; but, you might still find yourself going to the Buger King drive-thru afterwards to grab some fries to fill up the empty space in your stomach.

They have loads of yummy &amp; very healthy quinoa options and a special &#34;6 mix&#34; that has a super amount of nutritious flavor packed into each meal marked with this.

I have tried both the Chicken Pesto wrap, and the Newport salad, both of which were tasty, and amazingly nutritious!

I still remember the first time they invited me (Do I want a protein bar for lunch? Are you all nuts?) but they swore by it - and I realized it&#39;s a restaurant, and my coworkers were not all Mr. Olympia contestants undercover - and tried it out.

Then it opened in Schaumburg, and I was in the area and very excited to try it again. I cook and eat healthy stuff 90% of the time, so I thought this would be a nice way to break up the super-healthy (ha ha) Christmas week.

#1 The menu in-store is different from what is online. I&#39;m picky - and know I&#39;m picky - so I wanted to make this a very quick stop, as someone else was kind enough to drive me there. Studying up on the web version did not help me.

Contrary to the name, the cuisine at Protein Bar is not especially meat-centric. Sure, the menu items have insane amounts of protein (the super original bar-rito has a whopping 48 grams of it) but it&#39;s from a combination of chicken, quinoa and beans. I found the &#34;bar-rito&#34; to be pretty tasty -- and very filling -- but the yogurt sauce made it extremely watery and difficult to eat without spilling everywhere. The Baja salad was decent but definitely not worth the money, considering I could make one at home. Or customize the same salad at Chipotle..

Atmosphere
The atmosphere was very casual and fairly typical to any smaller chain restaurant with plenty of seating and open space. It was fairly slow during my visit so the noise level was reasonable and the staff was very friendly when ordering. The lay out was a tad funky but easy to follow. The menu posted on the wall was very easy to follow and informative as nutrition facts were listed next to each item.

Food
I ordered the Red Line protein shake (Strawberry and banana) which wasn&#39;t the greatest tasting. It actually had little flavor which was disappointing. The pricing is fair with most of the shakes. You&#39;re also offered a free boost to any shake/smoothie. You can even chose the &#34;hangover cure&#34; boost for those considering a place to eat the morning after an adventurous night.

I also ordered the Southwest Salad which, had good flavor but could use more of a zest and kick to it. Pricing on the salads are extremely high compared to the rest of the menu. The salads are served in large portions which helps you come to terms with the price you&#39;re paying for it.

Stopped in here for the first time after realizing this wasn&#39;t just a healthshake hangout, but actually sold real food as well!  The experience was hit and miss with a little more on the negative.

I ordered an original bar-rito along with a small chicken chili.  The burrito was a fairly big disappointment.  It features a blended mix of quinoa, beans, and chicken wrapped in a decent tortilla.  The chicken was shredded and somewhat absent, what was there was a mess of dry, flavorless meat which was combined with even more flavorless &#34;house made seasoned black beans.&#34;  It seems they were flavored with bean, since they certainly didn&#39;t stand out.

The burrito also contains salsa and cheddar cheese, both of which are lost in the dry and tasteless flavors of the bean, meat, quinoa combination dotted with small invasions of cilantro.  I know they&#39;re trying to capture a healthier market, and I can even get passed the leading flavor of the quinoa (which I actually don&#39;t mind) but for god sakes, you have to at least try to season your food with something, and the burrito has quite a list of healthy options like peppers or lime that could have added some actual flavor to the dish.

On the flip side, the chicken chili was surprisingly good.  It pleasantly packed a little more heat than I was expecting and the dry shredded chicken which had so clearly stuck out in the burrito made a much tastier appearance here dressed in its tomato-bound brethren.  The chili was a little on the sweet side, which I don&#39;t prefer, but overall not a bad combination.  

The only real disappointment with the chili was the small &#34;snack&#34; size which,  already in a smaller-than-average container, also comes half full.  I&#39;m assuming this is to save calories? but it feels more like a cop-out.

If you&#39;re looking for vegan/vegetarian where unfortunately many places already don&#39;t go out of their way to provide a correctly tasty meal, this might not be a terrible option, but compared to everything else around for lunch it definitely comes up short on flavor...

And high on price, almost $15 for a small burrito and a half cup of chili does smack a tiny bit of highway robbery.",09/02/15,250,3,1,4,-25,3.7558,2.7939999999999996,1.1989999999999996,13.007,No,2293

I think if people don&#39;t like protein bar then they didn&#39;t realize what protein bar is all about and got frustrated with some of the ingredients that a lot of people not into nutrition and health would not recognize or appreciate. As far as staff complaints go. Ask yourself if you are always the happiest bubbliest person 24/7. Seriously even though people are in the service industry doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t have a bad day or come across short sometimes. 

Anyway, Protein bar offers healthy options for people concerned about what they put in their bodies. Not only healthy but tasty too. I love the Spinach pesto chicken quinoa bowl.

I was slightly turned off by the negative reviews but decided to give it a shot anyway. I went in three weeks ago for the first time and was instantly greeted by a girl that was sweeping. As I walked up to the counter I was greeted by the cashier and the workers behind the counter. Was I at the right place? 

I went with the Vegan Quinoa Chili and the Comiskey Cocoa shake. Extra points to the cashier for pointing out that the malt powder wasn&#39;t vegan so they customized it for me. 

The chili was slightly bland but the shake was delicious. 

I had a craving for something sweet so I went in two days later at around 11:30AM. It was empty again except for two people in line ahead of me. I guess I beat the lunch rush. Yay! The morning staff was not as welcoming as the evening staff. The cashier acted as if I was bothering him while I placed my order. I asked if they had soy yogurt and he rudely replied no followed by &#34;is that it?&#34; several times while I was still ordering. I don&#39;t know what was that guy&#39;s problem. There was no one behind me in line and they had five employees in the back so it&#39;s not like he had to run back and prepare my meal.

I&#39;ve been there 4 times.  Before today, my issues lied only with the employees - lethargic/bored, have NO CLUE what they&#39;re doing at the registers, and on one visit their internet was down therefore they couldn&#39;t enter the credit on my app, refused to accomodate or suggest an alternative since it was THEIR issue, so I walked out.  Poor management and poor LOCAL customer service.  I wrote in via the website about my disappointing experience and received an extremely nice email back, taking accountability for the issue and addressing every single point I made (instead of a generic, auto-generated email).

So I decided to give it one last shot.  And it will, indeed, be my last - this time because of the food.  I ordered the pesto spinach bowl, and brought it back to work (2 mins away).  It was not even close to warm, with very, very dry chicken.  There really isn&#39;t any sauce - which is fine - but with dry chicken it was tough to swallow.  The 16oz bowl was about 3/4 full, and it cost about $6 (one of the cheapest things on the menu).

Also disappointed because their breakfast looked delicious, but apparently Schaumburg&#39;s hours changed to opening at 11am so they no longer serve breakfast.  Really no reason for me to go back then.

I would give 5 stars for the corporate customer service, but the location and food deserves a 2 at best.",17/03/14,161,2,1,-1,6,-1.0311000000000001,0.951,1.337,10.711,No,1424

The food here is great.  If you do not like quinoa, then really a salad is your only other option.  Lucky for me, I love quinoa.  My favorite burrito is the original burrito. The original burrito does not contain lettuce, which is great for my extremely picky boyfriend. The first time I came here, I got the black bean bowl.  It was not what I expected at all but it was still good.  I&#39;m pretty sure they gave me kidney beans instead of black beans, and overall it tasted very similar to chili. The actual chili on the menu is good too, but only as a side.  You will not be full from just having the chili.  A burrito, on the other hand, is very filling.

Lastly, I have only gotten 1 smoothie from this place because it was the first one I tried, and absolutely loved it.  It is called Pier-nut Butter &amp; Jelly.  So delicious!

I was really disappointed.  I ordered the quinoa black bean bowl with kale on the side and a smoothie.  The smoothie was good- but small.  They didn&#39;t put the kale on the side but rather put it in the bowl.  No bid deal but the bowl had almost no kale in it and I swear I have never seen black beans look brown?!

I&#39;d read it was greasy, and with menu items such as The Heart Attack, Doomsday Dogs, The Charlie Sheen and The Ricky Bobby I knew I should stay FAR.AWAY. 

They put gyro meat on burgers. Mac n cheese on buns. Country fried steak and gravy ON TOP OF a beef patty. I mean this place is like THE ULTIMATE hangover food and I just can&#39;t bring myself to eat it when I have to return back to the office and try to function like an adult. 

However, the intern guys at work (bless their hearts) invited me and I decided I&#39;d try a chicken sandwich- Blue Buffalo. I was glad it was grilled, not fried. It was good but it had jalapenos and it was then I&#39;d realized I had made a mistake. Why, you ask? I love jalapenos, but... 

Canned jalapenos? Really? Who are you kidding, Fatt Mustard? Booooo. Boo I say.

This isn&#39;t one of those places. We were persuaded by the reviews and the pretty pictures, but when all is said and done, this is just a regular local hot dog joint. They try to put some interesting things on their dogs, and sandwiches, but overall it&#39;s just average stuff you could make at home. Their big claim to fame seems to be the Fat Sauce, which tastes almost exactly like Red Robin&#39;s Campfire Sauce. 

What they do is fine. We ordered a couple of chili dogs that had mac &#39;n cheese on top, with bacon and whatnot. There wasn&#39;t really anything special about them. They tasted fine. They looked fine. They were fine. 

Don&#39;t take this review the wrong way. If I lived in the area and was craving a hot dog, I&#39;d definitely come back. But I wouldn&#39;t make it a destination stop again. In fact, this is going to be a short review because it&#39;s just simple stuff.

Unless, of course, you are there for the breakfast (which I cannot write about because I have never been there earlier than 11 AM- but they serve breakfast all day!). 

You just need to order any kind of burger they offer, and the Fatt Fries. It&#39;s really what they excel at. They have enough variety and toppings to satisfy anyone&#39;s weird cravings, and the Fatt Sauce you can put on your fries and feel really bad about yourself afterwards, because you know it was like eating 2000 calories all at once (JUST THE FRIES). But damn does it taste good. 

One time, (at band camp) I ordered a salad here. It came out almost as large as the tray itself. This is obnoxiously large, and I think the employees decided if anyone came here and wanted to act all sanctimonious about being &#34;healthy&#34; they would give them an entire head of iceburg lettuce with a ton of toppings to show them another way they can get to 1000 calories while thinking they are being healthy. 

Another time, I had a special- grilled chicken with buffalo sauce, blue cheese crumbles, all on flat bread with fatt fries. Again, this was a winner. I couldn&#39;t even finish 1/3 of my fries. The portions are huge.

Now, before eating the breakfast here, I had tried a panini because it was a free lunch thanks to my workplace. Plus, I was new to the area and didn&#39;t know many restaurants in the proximity. The sandwiches are good; Greasy, but good. The fries are in fact fresh cut, but they&#39;re more like fry nuggets because most of them are so small. In my opinion, the lunch food is average at best. 

Back to breakfast: They have an amazing opportunity to make some bomb breakfast food. Considering they open at the crack of dawn and close just after lunch, they need to make desayuno a priority. You can order it all day, with an exception of a few items. Again, their breakfast is simply average. The omelets usually don&#39;t come out fully cooked. I&#39;ve gotten pieces of egg whites that are still gooey-nasty and personally gross me out (haha). I am sorry to say this, but they&#39;re hashbrowns suck. They are completely undercooked and have no flavor what-so-ever. I understand that they are simply potatoes, but throw some spices on those suckers! Even asking for them well-done doesn&#39;t change anything; Trust me, I&#39;ve asked for them EXTRA well done. I would suggest swapping the hash out with tots, if you enjoy crispy tators like myself. 

On a more positive note, they&#39;re country fried steak is to die for. It&#39;s delicious, fresh, and smothered in white country gravy. If you were to get breakfast there, go for the CFS, no questions asked.

In the end, it&#39;s all like I said: Just average. And greasy. With horrible hashbrowns. Do I suggest trying it out? Sure, why not. Would I make it a point of interest if you&#39;re in town?

My double bacon cheeseburger was eh, okay. The meat was more bland than anticipated, since they boast about it being their own and being made fresh daily. And the bacon? I was not a fan. Seemed kinda cheap and thin. 

The fries... not sure what all the raving is about, I got mostly tiny little pieces that I had to spear mass quantities of onto a fork just to dip in ketchup... where all the pieces then fell off the fork and into the ketchup.

Review - Fatt Mustard

Food - My Fav was def the fries!  They are fresh cut fries, lets say it again bc sometimes peps cant tell the difference.  They server FRESH cut fries.  You can tell the difference trust me!  And the fries are good!!  They serve you more than enough too, but on a cold day who doesnt mind putting back a fried greasy potatoe or two.  lol  When you walk into the place the line dividers are jugs of veg oil.  Kinda funny but kinda gross when you think about it...

Other than their fries, its a typical burger and hot dog joint that get creative on a few menu items.  I ordered the Charlie Sheen it was a burger w/ grilled onions, bacon, jalepenos, hot sauce (franks red hot), and american cheese.  Basically it sounds like a heart burn waiting to happen if you are old, out of shape, and married.  lol  Well Im none of those so I ate it w/ a smile on my face.  :)  Decent burger I would have like to see the burger have some thickness but its one of those burgers that are thin and get that nice crisp from the flat top.   

Decor and Service - They have the cheezy hidden sexual sayings, which I always enjoy reading on the walls all over the place.  Besides that it appears to be a husband n wife duo running the joint very nice people and handle the crowds quite well!  It was lunch by myself so nothing that humurous could happen. lol",01/02/11,206,4,3,5,67,7.0192000000000005,5.027,0.7459999999999999,15.228,No,1615

the service on the other hand was terrible.

Me looking at menu and trying to decide what I would like when a employee , I wouldn&#39;t say yelled but forcefully asked me if I was ready to order and I responded I am still looking at the menu and she dismissed me quickly to talk with another employee that was sitting at the pick up window on break I guess.

I was ready to place my order and I walked up toward the register and the employee was still chatting with the other employee and I guess she wasn&#39;t ready to take my order until she was finished talking . I placed my order for the &#34; heart attack &#34; burger  and proceeded to pay , after  she took the order she basically threw my receipt and change into my hand and quickly walked away to continue her conversation with the other employee who was on break.

I ordered a soda with my meal and walked over to the pop machine and wanted ice in my cup, 4 cubes fell out and the machine was empty, I kept pressing the ice bar because it makes a loud click to engage the release for the ice at least a half dozen times while both employees are still talking at the pick up window , which is about 2 feet away. It was obvious that the machine was empty and not once did either employee ask or tell me that they would add more ice to the machine.

So I mentioned to her that the ice machine was empty and she never even looked in my direction. I have a voice that can be heard and for her to ignore me was not going to happen. I then in a louder voice said &#34; the ice machine is empty &#34; and I would like some more ice , she replied OK and continued to talk with her other employee. 3 other customer came in while I was there trying to fill my drink. they never added ice , she never mentioned it to anyone else there to fill it so I had my soda with 4 ice cubes and I guess that all you can have there.

I waited another 8 minutes for my food which was quick and she was talking the whole time I sat there and never filled or made an attempt to fill the ice .

it was 1:20 in the afternoon and  I understand the lunch rush but once I asked if I could have more ice I would have thought they would have filled the machine.

Since it first opened many things have been added and improved.  I&#39;ve tried different things on their menu, from Sandwiches, burgers, all the chicken plates, soups, pasta Wed and salads.  Salads have massively improved, I might have to get one next time I&#39;m in. All their food is seasoned and cooked well. I pay to eat here because the food is fresh. Such as their hot dogs FRESH, not store bought processed in some plant! 

I&#39;d rather pay a little more and know it&#39;s fresh than pay for something cheaper and not know when it expired. The quality of good is good. I always get a lot of food for my money, so I always have leftovers.  I&#39;m happy!

The customer service is always spot on! To address the pricing again, you can always get things from the combo list.  Make smarter choices when buying.  I can get many dishes and be right at $7.00. Much healthier meal than going down the street to McDonalds and paying $5-$9 for a value meal loaded with crap. Just sayin!

They&#39;re all menu items at Fatt Mustard Cafe which is a  burger joint with your not so typical menu.

Imagine an army of french cut french fries (skin on) diving into a bath of boiling peanut oil.  Anybody that knows their fries knows when it&#39;s peanut oil.  Pair these fries with their special house sauce or the hanky panky sauce which tasted of a creamy mustard with a hint of curry.

They take burgers and dogs and give them an upgrade such as the The Big &#34;Opah&#34; Burger which is what happens when a gyro and a burger has a baby.  This was the first thing I tried here and it works

I was also able to bear witness my coworker finishing what they call the &#34;King Kong Challenge&#34; which is the mother of all hot dogs.  I can&#39;t even begin to start describing this monstrosity of a heart attack.

My skillet was tasty, and I love that they had a make your own option so I could customize to my picky heart&#39;s content. The husband liked his fajita frittata that he said was excellent, and I also liked that I could have pancakes instead of toast with my skillet.

This is quite unfortunate because we&#39;ve been there many times since they opened years ago. Generally, the food and service have been very good. But, today, Mother&#39;s Day, we got a better look at how they feel about their customers and it was not pretty. But, if I were rating our server, she would rate very highly. 

The story goes something like this - since it was Mother&#39;s Day, we made reservations ahead of time. Monday, my daughter called and set up a table for us at 11 AM for brunch. When we arrived, they did not have our reservation. There was a long wait, but they did manage to get in after only a short wait.

We ordered right away. Since our whole family was together, we spent time talking and even ran into some friends who were also there. Before we knew it, 40 minutes had gone by. We flagged down our waitress who said she would check on the food. It came right out.

It was pretty obvious that the food had been sitting around for a while. I ordered a club sandwich and fries. The french fries were cold. My daughter ordered an omelet and specifically ordered it with no cheese. When it arrived, we noticed cheese shreds were sprinkled on top. We called over the waitress who apologized and took it back. She said she would rush the order since we&#39;d been waiting for so long already. A minute or two went by and the waitress returned. The manager send her back to tell us that there was no cheese in the omelet. She pointed out the shredded cheese which she acknowledged and took it back again. Another few minutes went by and she returned again - this time the omelet was cut open. The manager sent her back again to show us there was no cheese inside.

In my life I have never experienced a case where a manager puts there employee into such an awkward circumstance and blames their error on their customer. It was clear that there was no cheese inside, there was cheese on top which management refused to acknowledge at all. She said they would remake it and I asked for her to have the manager come by our table. The manager did not acknowledge us and in fact, never came back to our side of the restaurant.

When you check out at Egg&#39;lectic, you pay at the register. The hostess asked how our meal was and I asked her if she really wanted to know? I asked to speak to the manager. She went back to get her, but instead the owner came out. I explained what happened, and she also argued with us about the food. She told the hostess to take 10% off of our bill (my daughter said it should be free). But, I told her that I was not looking for any money off, I just wanted an apology. She was unwilling to admit they did anything wrong.

Restaurants are great places to go to for a meal out. But, half of the meal is the experience. This was not a great experience. I would give them one star if the waitress had not been so professional and had not tried to resolve the situation.",11/05/14,320,2,1,0,-43,-0.8213000000000001,1.9829999999999999,2.429,37.589,No,2981

I couldn&#39;t cross my legs without banging them on the bottom of the table, and I couldn&#39;t sit without them crossed unless I wanted to be playing ultimate footsie with my mom. Next time, I&#39;ll ask to sit at a table instead of a booth.

Our waitress was the sweetest girl, especially for being as busy as she was. The food was outstanding for the price. My mom and I both ordered the farmhouse, which is biscuits and gravy with two eggs and hash browns. I was expecting one biscuit cut in half, since there was so much more involved in the meal. Nope! It was a full order of B&amp;G (two biscuits), plus a full order of hash browns (like half the plate and overlapping onto the biscuits), and my eggs were poached perfectly! Needless to say, there was plenty to bring home as leftovers. I also had a large fresh-squeezed OJ, which was delightful and didn&#39;t break the bank. For the two of us, the bill came to 19 bucks. Worth every penny!",22/12/14,187,4,1,3,-41,2.0393000000000003,2.036,0.9189999999999999,18.044999999999998,No,1608

egglectic-caf-rolling-meadows-2,Mick B.,kk-bXv0GI7bDg1RIRJNCIw,pwvcZEaCIxV1b5TLzfCUcg,"Egg&#39;clectic Cafe is a great breakfast place with friendly service and a huge number of breakfast options to choose from.

I tried the California Omelet with hash browns and pancakes instead of toast which was a massive amount of food for breakfast- I was glad we went later in the morning because it lasted me through lunch too. The mix of the swiss, jack and cheddar cheeses with sour cream on the side made a delightful topping.

Parking on a Sunday apparently can be a bit of a problem, but a tip if you can&#39;t find parking is that there is an extension to the parking lot in the BACK of the restaurant building that when we visited was mostly empty.

The only negative- and it is a very small one for me, is that the items we were served weren&#39;t as &#34;picture perfect&#34; and beautifully plated as the more upscale breakfast places in the area. The items we ordered looked largely homestyle ordinary but the TASTE was extraordinary. I am not so picky that my meals have to be art on a plate- I just want something tasty that will stick to my ribs and that certainly is what we got.

I felt the prices were good to slightly inexpensive considering what we got for the money.

I had not been here in a while, so I was hoping the experience would be just as good. 

I&#39;m still impressed with the amount of items to choose from on their menu. I decided to get the special for the day, which was a Mediterranean benedict. I knew right away this was either going to be terrible, or amazing. Had it not been for the home-made hollandaise, it would have been great. Maybe I&#39;m just not a fan of the home-made hollandaise (although I think I have had it before at other places and liked it), but the sauce ruined the taste of everything. Everyone else seemed to like what they got, so I&#39;m thinking this was just not my dish.

When it comes to pancakes, it&#39;s easy to disappoint with multigrain batter. Well not here!! Spot on perfection. For lunch, my fav is the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, no bleu cheese, sub their HOMEMADE ranch instead.

Problem is, many of said diners/breakfast locales are just ok. And while I don&#39;t need Wildberry every weekend, I often crave their creative dishes. What I do not crave is the asinine wait that forms every.single.weekend. Thus, I&#39;m always on the lookout for tasty substitutes. And overall, Egg&#39;lectic is solid. And technically in Rolling Meadows. 

Inside, Egg&#39;lectic is country kitsch without meaning to be kitsch. Know what I mean? It&#39;s comfortable, spacious and a welcome respite from crowds. The menu is pretty impressive - deep with options that will likely please any picky palate - a multitude of creative omelets, fritattas, oatmeal, pancakes, scramblers, crepes, combos and more. If you&#39;re feeling indecisive, I bet you&#39;ll have a helluva time making your b-fast decision.

I often steer towards the sweet side of a breakfast menu, thus went with the blackberry-banana pancakes. The pancakes were hearty in size and flavor, and the fresh blackberries and bananas made for a tasty combination. Nothing too crazy, just a nice stack of carb with fruit - no fanfare in the presentation. My main issue with the combo breakfast was the eggs that came with the pancakes. The eggs were pretty gummy - akin to those you may scrape out from the bottom of a chafing dish at a hotel buffet. Perhaps they sat under the heat lamp too long?

Regardless, Egg&#39;lectic offers a really deep menu for all you breakfast lovers out there. If you find yourself hangry in Arlington Heights/Rolling Meadow, it&#39;s certainly worth a try!",24/06/13,185,3,2,5,11,4.6928,2.631,0.446,15.923000000000002,No,1639

I discovered this location thanks to Yelp (woot!!) and my husband insisted that we go the very next day (which just happened to be New Year&#39;s Eve).

My husband&#39;s FAVORITE breakfast place is Egg&#39;lectic cafe, and his favorite thing to order is the Banana Nut Bread French Toast Combo.  He gets it w/ eggs over hard, and it comes with two slices of toast.  This is his tried and true meal, and he has yet to sway from it! :)

I, however, try something different every time, and I have yet to be disappointed!  I got the healthy scrambler w/ the potatoes and substituted peppers for spinach with no extra charge.  Gotta love it!!

The kids ordered french toast and one of their specials--oatmeal pancakes!  They had oats and raisins in them and were delicious.  The french toast was standard fare--not bad, just nothing to write home about!

As for my scrambler--YUM!!  You never know how these are going to turn out--some are tasteless, some are greasy, but this one was delicious!!  There&#39;s nothing worse than ordering a &#34;healthy&#34; scrambler and have it swimming in grease, but Egg&#39;lectic understands that!  It wasn&#39;t overly-oiled and was still delicious!  The potatoes were a good compliment!

For the four of us, it was $37 including tip, and my husband was even offered a cup of coffee to go.  What a nice touch!!

We will definitely be back!",02/01/13,173,4,2,5,13,5.397600000000001,4.559,0.781,14.659,No,1446
egglectic-caf-rolling-meadows-2,Candice G.,UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg,ESdzATwFv6W_Rpg024caRA,"For the Wildberry rejects:

Here&#39;s your answer to break-fast without the 2 hour wait (which is also known as brunch... also known as Wildberry wait expectations). At Egg&#39;lectic we got right in. I even saw 3 other couples come into EC while we were dining who I had also seen standing for tables at Wildberry when I went in to check on the wait time. Apparently, this is THE place to go if you get rejected by the insanely popular W-Berry. 

Like any warm-blooded Schaumburg area-n, I love to eat at Wildberry. It&#39;s one of the only reasons I get up before 3pm on the weekends and one  of the main reasons I, sadly, won&#39;t be cutting weight this summer. But sometimes, unfortunate things happen and I can&#39;t always get a table at Wildberry that doesn&#39;t come with a ridiculous wait time, that my morning-mate will not tolerate. It was after one of these occasions that we luckily discovered Egg&#39;lectic Cafe. 

With a HUGE menu and items that, like Wildberry, are a bit more imaginative than your average B-fast menu, I quickly forgot about feeling like a pre-lunch loser who didn&#39;t get on the list. With your pick of flavored coffee creamers (mix the hazelnut and chocolate!) and pages and pages to choose from, Egg&#39;lectic was quickly winning us over. The &#39;Hey Ricky&#39; omelet was packed with avocado- there had to have been at least 6 of those bad boys up in there. And the stuffed french toast was a real panty-creamer. They NEED to sell that passion fruit jam. I hate putting jam on my ish but I was literally eating it straight out of the bowl. My BF tried to stop me because he thought it was gross, then I made him try the jam and he changed his tune. He was then trying to stop me because he wanted to eat it on it&#39;s own, too. SO good. The plates here come a little less dressed up than at Wb, and overall, nothing is as fancy or modern, or even clean, but the food is just as good and you don&#39;t have to wait 2 days to get a seat to eat it. 

We will definitely be back. Next time I&#39;m ordering a bowl of that passion-fruit jam, though. And maybe the Cap&#39;n Crunch French Toast, too!",12/06/12,244,4,1,2,-57,1.5988000000000002,3.1220000000000003,1.196,17.683,No,2141

I wish they would open a place closer to my office, because I would have lunch here once a week. And lunch would include a vat of their chicken soup and a club sandwich. They have yummy fries and delicious breakfast items. I know this because I drooled at each of them as they passed our table.

I am not much of a breakfast person, so their lunch options appease me. My fiance ordered the cinnamon roll french toast and looooooved it! The only thing I would mention is that their breakfast sausage was just average. I would either order it well done or get bacon instead. Their bacon was pretty decent.

They had a number of items on the menu that I would try but since having had their soup, I think I will stick with lunch. They have crepes which I know everyone loves, waffle, pastries and skillets. Their menu is pretty extensive.

My fiance tossed around the Red Velvet french toast idea that sounded good, but he was more than happy with what he ended up with. My sister opted for lunch as well. She rocked a chicken sandwich with bacon and a side of onion petals. The toast came out all buttered up, and she didn&#39;t want that buttered so she ordered fresh toast plain.

Based on reviews and since Katie&#39;s Kitchen had already closed for the day, this was our next choice.  If you can make it into the dining room even at 2 minutes before closing time, they will still serve you.  Luckily we were one of three tables so we got everything fairly quickly and they didn&#39;t cheap out on anything being that it was already closing time.  Once they took the order and brought out the basics, they let us know how much time we&#39;d be waiting.  Our waitress was kinda aloof, of course it was closing time, but, the runner and the hostess helped us more often then our waitress.

Nice, welcoming atmosphere makes me think of a comfort food environment and reminds me of the typical restaurants found along expressways.  The table tops are red and white checkered which to me reminds of pizza, although that is not served here.  Food was better than average and we could see why this restaurant is highly rated in this area.  Not a decision I would make again though, it was good not great.  Some of the flavors weren&#39;t appealing to us and since both of us got different Eggs Benny&#39;s, we found the hollandaise had an almost sweet taste to it which is a first for the both of us.  The highlight for me would have been the fresh crepe filled with Gnutella and topped with sliced bananas, which again was just okay.  With your brunch entree comes hash browns or house potatoes and fresh fruit.  The meal is filling and you can leave with a food coma.

It was about 5pm on a Saturday , it was pretty dead there. I only saw two other people eating there. 

We were quickly seated and given menus. The service was super friendly,  i loved the bubbly personality our cute little older server had. 

The rolls were quite inexpensive,  but i just wasnt that impressed. They dont give you a miso soup while you wait or anything like they typically do at sushi spots around the area.

The 911 roll showed more promise, but again it just failed to deliver any real finesse.

Sushi should be a thoughtful experience where chefs understand their ingredients and dare the guest to experience excitement in each bite because each element is so exposed.

sakura-woodfield-rolling-meadows,Felice O.,3HuDK890cGwqh8dQ7kdw3w,nnQk_bwLS23BGXLVZrS0bA,"My husband and I love Sakura! It is by far one of the most authentic Japanese restaurant that you will find in the Chicagoland area. 
We would literally come here once a week to get my favorite dish their tonkatsu curry!! As an Asian that has tried tonkatsu curry at every Japanese restaurant that offers tonkatsu curry, it is by far the best tonkatsu curry I have had in the US. It is super hearty and warming to the soul. Their curry is perfectly flavored with nicely sized chunks of carrots, onion, and beef. The tonkatsu is only 1 deep fried pork cutlet, which may be the only downside because it is so crispy and complements the curry so well. Beneath the tonkatsu and curry is a bed of rice that is well-portioned. 
Their miso soup and house salad are also excellent. The Japanese salad dressing they use is so GOOD! My husband loves futomaki, and the futomaki at Sakura is amazing! Their spicy tuna roll is great and comes with a good amount of tuna. I could go on, and on about all the wonderful dishes they have made for us that we have thoroughly enjoyed (Niku Udon, Menchi Katsu, Zaru Soba, and more!)
As for the service, Sakura is a family-owned restaurant and everyone there is very friendly! The restaurant is located in a non-descript plaza that seems a bit run-down, so try not to be put off by your initial impression. Inside the restaurant is separated into two rooms that you can select to be seated in. One side is where the kitchen, sushi area, and bar is located, this has seating for smaller groups of 2 or 4. This side is where my husband and I usually sit, because it has a more intimate ambiance, and we come during slower hours (8:00-9:00pm on weeknights). The other side is a lot brighter and can accommodate bigger groups, on weeknights you will see a lot of Japanese businessmen gathering in this room eating and drinking pitchers of Sapporo. That&#39;s how you know this place is good. The other side also has a great jazz band that plays on some weekends!

I had been there several times before and never had an extreme experience as the last one, but this one server, not sure if she&#39;s the owner, made the visit so unpleasant I will not go back to this place again.
The old Japanese lady spoke in a very rude manner.  We saw only shrimp tempura in Tempura Udon and asked if it should come with other vegetable tempura as well.  She angrily responded, &#34; No!  That&#39;s Korean style!  This is Japanese style!&#34;  First of all, I did not understand why she was rude in her response.  Second, what does Korean and Japanese style have to do with answering whether or not vegetable tempura should be included in Tempura Udon?  I had suspected that she may be discriminating due to my nationality, but thought perhaps she&#39;s just having a bad day or she&#39;s a grumpy person and that&#39;s how she speaks.  Shortly after, a Japanese family was seated next to our table, and the server&#39;s demeanor changed like a night and day!  She smiled at them, checked on them, and conversed with them asking where they are from and so forth.  The server spoke rudely to us with a straight face, never checked on us and we had to wait and ask for her in order to get the check.  Obviously, she is only one person and cannot represent her people, however, she left such a negative impression with her poor, discriminatory demeanor, it really doesn&#39;t help the image of her restaurant nor her people.",23/08/16,165,1,1,-3,-37,-3.1705999999999994,0.871,2.075,12.053999999999998,No,1596

And boy, am I glad it was closed! Sakura is definitely one of my favorite Japanese spots in the Chicagoland area.

Having lived in Japan for 6 months, finding authentic, quality Japanese food can be difficult--so many watered down, Americanized versions out there. Sakura, though, is not one of them. It&#39;s true, Japanese home cookin&#39;. The saba shioyaki is excellent &amp; perfectly seasoned. The sushi tastes fresh, though maybe a tiny bit pricey for the amount. The udon is a good, solid udon, as is their miso soup. I often gauge Japanese restaurants by their miso soup; it&#39;s so simple, and yet at some places it tastes more like salt water. I figure, if restaurants take the time to make a good miso, they probably put in a strong effort into the rest of their food as well.

The service is friendly, and the vibe hospitable. The room is a little on the warm side, especially near the kitchen, but it&#39;s nothing unbearable. If you&#39;re looking for good, authentic Japanese cuisine, Sakura is it.",17/08/15,141,4,2,5,38,5.561800000000001,3.016,0.0,9.984,No,1120

sakura-woodfield-rolling-meadows,Eric S.,rkdE06BbheP4gEhb3ooH0w,q1smfd-lFMZuS4Z7FdzI6Q,"It&#39;s true what fellow Yelpers say: this place isn&#39;t much from the outside.  Appearances can be deceiving, however, as inside features some nice maki choices and a pleasant enough atmosphere.  On the night I went (a Friday), they had a live soft jazz band playing.

Upon entering Sakura you&#39;ll likely be greeted enthusiastically by one of their sushi masters.  Chef Morimoto (no idea what his name actually was) seemed genuinely happy to have our business.  Our server was much less spirited--in fact, she was pretty meek and spoke almost too softly to understand.  What was more of a problem was when I asked about the specials, I received a blank look and no response.

Me: &#34;You know, the daily specials....I think the sign outside said softshell crab?&#34;
Her: &#34;Sure, crab, yes, mhmm.&#34;
Me: &#34;Uh, okay then.....&#34;

So I got two orders of nigiri sushi which was adeptly prepared by said friendly sushi guru.  As he handed it off to my hungry eyes, I politely nodded my head and said in my best Uma-Thurman-in-Kill-Bill voice, &#39;arigato&#39;.  He smiled, appreciating that the whitest dude ever (me) at least made a bilingual effort to thank him for being a master at his craft.

Sakura is one of the few places I&#39;ve been to (can count them on one hand) that has Sapporo beer on draft.  SCHWING!  When it came time to ring up the tab, I received no itemized receipt, as I would get at literally any other restaurant on the planet.  Instead, I just got the final amount and had to request a play-by-play tab so I knew how much my Sapporos were (they were $6 each).  The check total was a bit more than I expected, but you can&#39;t really put a price on carefully prepared sushi.  Or can you.....?


TL;DR: 4 stars for sushi quality, 3 stars for value, 2 for service--average 3 stars.  Plus 1/2 a star for having draft Sapporo, and in rounding up/down Sakura gets the benefit of the doubt.  There&#39;s dozens of other places I&#39;ve been where the sushi maki is the same quality in a greater quantity at half the price.",24/03/14,258,4,2,5,35,5.921,3.102,0.572,17.326999999999998,No,2057
sakura-woodfield-rolling-meadows,Candice G.,UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg,kCzc2gCm_uCNbViCYdXlNA,"Today was Community Manager Appreciation Day. It&#39;s not a real holiday and I know nobody who isn&#39;t a community manager even cares (though I did get one shout out- thanks, Christian K!), but for whatever reason I felt like celebrating this made up day by treating myself to a solo sushi dinner at a local independent business.

I&#39;d been wanting to check out Sakura ever since I stumbled upon Yanyao N&#39;s review, because, ya know, her word is as good as gold in my household. No joke. If I say I found a place I really want to visit, the peanut gallery at the G household happily ignores me. But if I say Yanyao went somewhere and loves it, well, all of a sudden we&#39;re running out the door to get there. 

So anyway, I head on in to a semi empty Sakura and get to pick my seat from the 2-tops in the first sectioned off room area. I had my pick of seats at the sushi bar but personally, when I go out to eat alone, I like to eat alone as well and not put myself in any kind of position where I might have to talk to people who aren&#39;t directly affiliated with restaurant. 

My server was soft spoken and sweet and brought the miso soup I ordered out in exactly the blink of an eye. The general vibe of the service on a Monday night wasn&#39;t overly attentive or friendly, but I&#39;ve waited tables before and the absolute worst is when it&#39;s slow and you get stuck waiting on a single person, trying to decipher whether they&#39;re just sitting there looking all all blank because they need something or because they just enjoy the silence. So I guess for my being a single diner who was just in it to enjoy the silence, the service was pretty spot on and my green tea was always full and hot. 

The broth in my miso was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had- so much so that I was tempted to follow up my appetizer miso soup with a second serving of miso soup. For sushi, I went with my standard spicy tuna, which was fine, but I tried it after having started with the 911 roll (tuna, jalapeno, double wasabi, and spicy sauce) that was by far and away, the spiciest tuna roll I have ever had--and I always seek out the spiciest thing on the menu and 100% of the time I&#39;m disappointment with the lack of spice... but not this time. It was perfect. Perfect and spicy enough that I had to take a break and chow down of the lobster salad to cool my mouth off, so I could even attempt to taste the spicy tuna roll. LOVE. 

They didn&#39;t have a ton of sushi options, but they have other dishes beyond sushi like noodles, tons of appetizers, salads etc. The atmosphere isn&#39;t fancy, there isn&#39;t much ambiance, but you probably weren&#39;t expecting the Ritz if you paid any attention at all while pulling up to this somewhat dilapidated parking lot and outdated suburban strip mall.

When I went to leave my server stopped everything she was doing to thank me for coming in and I turned the corner to the exiting path past the sushi bar, all the elder sushi chefs stopped what they were doing and took the time to thank me for coming in and trying their food. Then, as I walked out the door, my heart, now warmed by the kind gesture of appreciation by the staff, grew three sizes larger when I saw this sign: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TS__uZpyM-kVJ4GwIa7b0g&amp;userid=UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg

It&#39;s got the head chef&#39;s photo on it (from his younger days) and handwritten at the top in silver marker and red, glittery puff paint it reads: Thank you very much. See you tomorrow. Have a nice day. 

And that was it. So much heart in so few, short, simple interactions, yet I felt more appreciated than I have in, well, a really long time. And you know what? I probably will be back tomorrow; Showing my support and appreciation for independent businesses like Sakura that truly appreciate their customers.",28/01/13,423,5,2,5,27,9.990499999999999,6.2440000000000015,1.155,19.600000000000005,No,3856

I tried the miso soup and agree with the recommendations here. It&#39;s simple but really good. We had a few different maki rolls, all of which were great. The spicy sauce on one of them was creamy and delicious. My girlfriend, who usually doesn&#39;t like spicy things, kept dipping her philly roll in it. The waitress recommended a really good sake, which I&#39;m sure was a lot better than the one we almost got (not knowing much about sake).

I was looking for an old short bald sushi chef to bring me to nirvana. My search for a true shokunin led me to Sakura - one of the oldest Japanese restaurants in the area. 

Surprisingly, the sushi items were quite limited. You have the classics but the stellar items like toro (fatty tuna) and uni (sea urchin) were missing. As a result, I ordered maki and specialty rolls and some a la carte items. The spicy scallop roll was definitely the favorite since it was made from big raw scallops. Often times, spicy scallop rolls are made from smaller cooked pieces since it&#39;s cheaper but this wasn&#39;t the case at Sakura. Several of the maki rolls were only $6-7 for eight pieces which is reasonable. But based on my order, it appeared that the meal was prepared by the apprentices rather than the shokunin. 

After the meal, I didn&#39;t smell the sweet scent of cherry blossoms and left the meal a bit unsatisfied. Maybe their known for other items rather than the Americanized maki roll? I am to blame since I made the gaijin mistake of not sitting at the sushi bar and just allowing for the chef&#39;s choice.

My guy is in Chicago on business frequently, and we often stay out in the Schaumburg area. The food has, without exception, been excellent. But we were treated so poorly on Monday, February 4, that we will not return.

We arrived at the restaurant shortly after 7 p.m. The place was not crowded  and we were told we could sit anywhere. We chose a table near the window. 

After we sat down, ordered our food and had begun enjoying our beverages, a large group of Japanese businessmen came in. The staff began racing around, re-arranging tables to accommodate them. A server (not our server, but the one who presumably would be waiting on this group) said she needed our table for that group and she would like us to move. No &#34;please&#34; or &#34;would you mind...?&#34; No assistance in moving our stuff. No offer of any recompense for our inconvenience. Just get thee out of our way.

I probably could have let it slide, but my companion was furious on two counts. First, that we were asked to move, at all. And second, that there was absolutely no courtesy or respect accorded in any of it. We walked out.

He called the next day to speak to the manager or owner. They weren&#39;t in, so he left a message. He is still waiting for a return phone call.

My first Japanese boss took me here back in 1997 and introduced me to sushi...and ever since then, I have been hooked... both on sushi &amp; on Sakura.

However, the prices have gone up, so for the Sakura Chirashi dish (the one that includes Salmon Roe),  you will be dinged for $25.  But, along with the increase of price, it seems that they have increased the quantity of that dish, so I guess it kind of off-sets itself. (It is now 3 hours after we left, and I still feel stuffed.)  The quality of all the fish that I had today was excellent.  Another member of our lunch party had the Ramen (i know, i know...not Japanese), but he said that it was one of the best Ramen dishes he has ever had, and he had spent some time in Japan. 

Which goes to this point:  An establishment that keeps on producing quality Japanese food year after year, and continues to be a favorite of the local Japanese clients (I work for a Japanese owned company, so I have known plenty of expatriates from Japan who love this place), and can pretty much fill up the place for both lunch and dinner, definitely deserves a 5 star.

Top 10 reasons for Sakura lovin&#39;:

1) No-frills, strip mall, ethnic - my absolute favorite!

2) Super enthusiastic service - our server was such a doll! Joking about the size of the portions and commending me for my valiant effort at taking down their bento box. Waters filled, empty plates bussed. Superstar!

3) The lunch menu offerings! I had such a difficult time deciding because this menu reads like Yanyao&#39;s favorite Japanese foods - yakisoba, katsu don, unagi don, ramen, udon, zaru soba, spicy scallop roll, tonkatsu, tempura (and sushi/sashimi/maki rolls too). Plus, they have sukiyaki and and shabu shabu for dinner!

4) Over half of the clientele during our visit was speaking Japanese. 

5) The combination bento box! This is the most absurd bento box I have ever encountered - more like a bento platter. I chose unagi over the beef/chicken/salmon. Out came a giant platter with THREE salads (house, potato, and a cucumber with seaweed and crabstick), rice, a huge piece of unagi, two pieces of fried shrimp (so good, I even ate the tail), and vegetable yakisoba (THE BEST) -- yes, you read that right... rice AND noodles. Everything delicious. Very difficult to finish. FOOD OVERLOAD!

6) The tonkatsu is crispy and delicious - 2 large pieces of pork, served with a house salad, rice and miso soup.

7) House-made gyoza - winner!

8) The speed at which lunch comes out - we were eating within 7 minutes of ordering. This is a terrific lunch spot in the area.

9) The price! An enormous lunch for 2, with green tea, was only $32! 

10) Not having to eat at the gross chain restaurants in Schaumburg? #WINNING",19/06/11,227,5,3,5,61,5.1612,3.9299999999999997,1.816,19.255000000000003,No,1661

My parents have been bringing my Sister and I here for years. We&#39;re now bringing the next generation of our family here for traditional Japanese food.

I ordered a bowl of Mix Chazuke for $8.95. It&#39;s hot broth served with rice and wasabi. 
You can choose to pay less and have just one item from the Mix with your rice and broth: a sheet of nori (seaweed) for $5.95, Ume (pickled plum) for $6.95, Sake (salmon) for $6.95, Tarako (broiled cod roe) for $6.95. Because I don&#39;t like umeboshi (pickled plum), I asked to substitute it with takuan (pickled daikon radish).

Beef Aspara-Maki appetizer for $8.95. It&#39;s sliced beef rolled with asparagus and broiled with teriyaki sauce and a Kiliuea roll for $11.95. It&#39;s the darkest part of the tuna (and the most expensive)

sakura-woodfield-rolling-meadows,Yen L.,YVk5BDqr0Fy14ghNPBMoAw,MChtjGoEMjmjdslbDX2z_g,"My bf did a little Yelp work to find a sushi place near Woodfield, since we had finished shopping and I wanted sushi, but no buffet. Sakura popped up with a promising rating and good reviews, so off we went.

The chefs at the bar were the first people we saw when we walked in, and they all gave friendly greetings in Japanese, and it wasn&#39;t too long before we were shown to a table. It did take them a few minutes to bring us menus. After that, it was a little rough because we thought we were going to have to wave someone down for a menu. But they eventually brought us menus and hot towels to wipe down our hands, which was a nice touch. 

We&#39;d had the impression that we were going into a sushi place, but truth be told, this place is probably better with its appetizers and entrees. You can generally tell what a place is devoted to by the size of its selection. There was a sushi menu, and a few specials, but it was pretty clear that this place is more devoted to good hot entrees and appetizers. 

Since we&#39;re a little adventurous and pretty flexible, we decided to get a couple of rolls that caught our attention, and we each ordered our own noodle soup. I got the ramen, and my bf got soba. We did share an order of crab shumai and realized that we could probably go to any Asian market and buy a whole bag, but hey, at least we discovered its existence. :)

Our server was pleasant but not pushy, and the food came FAST and hot. I mean...I&#39;m pretty sure we had all of our food under 10 minutes. The sushi portions were typical, and the entree portions were huge. My bf took some of my ramen, and I still couldn&#39;t finish it. 

Sakura is situated in a nondescript strip mall near Woodfield, and I was glad we found it. We generally have defaulted to nearby Mitsuwa for ramen or sushi when we have the craving, and though we have no plans to abandon Mitsuwa, we were pleased to find this little place that offers a variety to meet different Japanese food cravings. We live in the city and won&#39;t make regular trips, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back when we&#39;re in the area.",10/07/11,231,3,2,5,45,6.8316,3.0909999999999997,0.222,15.688,No,2110

sakura-woodfield-rolling-meadows,Elana K.,D8WuAA6QO6plFiGT_cyjdg,aoLsYD6NCHoq4MgiCg6gFA,"This is more of a 3.5 star review.

The place seemed authentically Japanese.  We saw many Japanese patrons, as well as a lot of Japanese text on the menu.  I wonder if there are some kind of exclusive Japanese-only menu items?

I love good sushi, but hate spending much money.  However, there tends to be difficulty getting one without doing the other.  In this case I did spend more money than I would have liked, which was not totally unexpected, but a lot of other places I&#39;ve been would have at least included a miso soup and/or a house salad for the price.

I&#39;ve had a lot of green tea in my day (including in Japan), and the hot green tea here was surprisingly bland.  Maybe I just burned my taste buds off with that first scalding sip, but it tasted like nothing more than hot water with the subliminal implication of being green tea - which is surprising, with all of the sediment I saw at the bottom.

My husband wanted the tempura mozzarella for an appetizer, which was light, crisp, and tasty, so no complaints there.  It came with four salted green beans (not edamame) and ginger dipping sauce.

The unagi rolls were delicious, as well as the Futo maki we ordered.  As far as the quality of the food goes, we have little to complain about.  It was very tasty, at least as tasty as some of the other good sushi places we&#39;ve eaten.

The low point of our meal was the service.  There are some people who will complain about the service wherever they go because they are just unpleasant individuals.  I am not one of those people.  Usually I am tolerant of even very indifferent service, and while I don&#39;t mean to complain even now, I must say our server made us feel pretty unwelcome.  I don&#39;t know if she was overworked or maybe was just having an off-night, but she pretty much just flew through when bringing us food and the check, and had a demeanor that made my husband say mid-meal &#34;I don&#39;t think she likes me.&#34;  I didn&#39;t take it THAT personally (there was no obvious reason for her to be put off by us), but she definitely made me feel like we were imposing by eating here.  I wouldn&#39;t say it ruined our meal, but it did kind of make us feel like our patronage wasn&#39;t wanted.  The chefs behind the sushi bar, on the other hand, were quite friendly in welcoming us in to the restaurant and wishing us a good night when we departed.

All things considered we may try this place again, but on the other hand there are other equally good places we can go for sushi without feeling discouraged.  I don&#39;t want to sound overly dramatic about our experience because really it was only a case of subtle discomfort, so certainly if you are curious to try this place I would encourage you to do so.",12/01/13,297,3,1,5,3,4.5457,2.955,1.81,19.234999999999996,No,2751
sakura-woodfield-rolling-meadows,Phil S.,asP08n8OwVhIg2hyff8DFQ,J1kBbS5yevwoqa600SFrHg,"We decided to try this place out after hearing good reviews about the ramen and rolls. I&#39;m not much of a roll fan because a roll is basically just over-riced sushi but I&#39;m enjoy a good bowl of noodles.

It was past peak dinner hours on a Saturday but the place was still bristling with activity.

We started with the Kaki Fry and was pleasantly surprised by the fresh tenderness of the oysters. We tried to order a beef tongue appetizer but it wasn&#39;t available so we ordered a Dynamite Roll instead. The roll was decent as far as rolls go but we noticed it was a little on the salty side and the flavor wasn&#39;t coming from the sauce either. This was a foresight of dishes to come.

Ramen and Yaki Soba were next up on our list and we were pleasantly surprised with presentation. The ramen came in a dark broth topped with a harboiled egg half and various meats. The yaki soba came as a steaming heap of noodles and bountiful meat topped with dry seasonings and the whole dish looked very smokey and dark. Presentation was great but at first bite we both said the same thing: wow this is salty! Serious sodium overload at this place. My first thought about this tragedy is that they must be catering to the typical American tongue. 

What a shame because the noodles were fresh made and they had a great consistency and the other flavors seemed like they would&#39;ve been fantastic as well had the salt not overpowered everything. The yaki was cooked to smokey perfection and had such a great smokey flavor and the ramen noodles themselves were soft and chewy just like a fresh noodle should be but I was constantly reaching for water to calm the salt beast thrashing around in our dishes. I wish they would realize that adding flavor does not mean adding more salt because the flavors had real promise.

Service was a little slow but we had one lonely waitress serving one entire side of the place by herself and she was walking back and forth getting dishes and drinks non-stop. She was polite enough but I could tell she was extremely tired and didn&#39;t even have enough energy for a fake smile. She did her best though and we received everything we needed as long as we requested it. At the rate this woman was working it would&#39;ve been impossible for her to remember all the small details. What&#39;s funny was there was at least eight guys crowded behind the sushi bar and grill area. 

Overall, I was not impressed with this place and left longing for the noodles at Sankyu. It&#39;s too bad that Sankyu has the worst service I&#39;ve ever encountered. I&#39;d probably go back to Sakura again someday but I&#39;m going to have to request they take it easy on the soy sauce if I do go back.",30/09/12,276,2,2,5,17,4.5893,3.2110000000000003,1.8339999999999999,18.953999999999997,No,2717

We had Dynamite and Mexican rolls. The Dynamite rolls were not as flavorful as we&#39;d hoped, but it showcased the fresh fish very well. Our server said the Mexican rolls were a favorite dish among many -- and for good reason! Great flavor with good spice, if you like jalepeno.

Our server also recommended the aspari-maki appetizer. It&#39;s asparigus wrapped in broiled beef with teriyaki sauce, cut into rolls like sushi. I&#39;ve never seen an appetizer like this before, but it was fantastic. I want to try so many more items on the menu, but it&#39;ll be tough to pass this one up.

Our server was very good. He was friendly and gave great recommendations. We were too full to try all of his recommendations, but we&#39;ll be back to try the tempura and squid appetizers (he even came by our table to show us someone else&#39;s squid), along with more sushi.

As other reviewers have noted, we noticed a number of Japanese businessmen eating here. Most of them appeared to be regulars as they were greeted personally by the chefs.

The inside isnt a luxury decor either, but the food is damn good.  When a place is full of the same ethnic as type of restaurant it is.  In most cases, you know that you are going to eat some decent food.  Been going here for a couple of years and the food quality and the freshness is never off!  On top of it I always see the same sushi chefs working.  I have tried the sushi and the noodle dishes.  Lets start off w/ their bread and butter, ok let me reiterate that their soy sauce and wasabi....Sushi never failed me here yet, along w/ the out of towners that I bring.  Rainbow is always a must and so are the rest when I go (911, spicy tuna, spider, and dynamite)  I would only advise that you be drinking some of their excellent sake.  If you would go Felipe style it would be sake bombs, for the rookies out there its sapporro and a sake shot.  ;)  Well w/ any of those rolls you cant go wrong, as well as the noodle dishes.

We visited on a Saturday night around 7.  There were about 3 or 4 other tables.  We had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  We just stood there at the hostess station waiting and wondering what the hold up was since there weren&#39;t many people there.

We were seated and brought water and some chips and some kind of green dip.  I think it was a cilantro-based thing.  The water glasses are like fluted champagne glasses, so you don&#39;t get much.  I got one refill the whole time we were there and that just isn&#39;t enough for me.

I couldn&#39;t wait to have one of their margaritas.  Last time I was there they were so good!  Not this time.  It was a watered down sweet tart.  No liquor, just tasted like the mixer.  They were $10 EACH.  I&#39;m ok with paying $10 for a good drink, but these were not worthy.

There was lots of waiting during this visit.  Waiting for beverages, waiting for someone to take our order, waiting for some water.  It just seemed like we were waiting all the time!

Hubby and I both got tacos.  They use LOTS of cilantro.  I&#39;m ok with cilantro, but there wasn&#39;t much else on my taco.  I didn&#39;t want cheese.  I explained to the waiter that I couldn&#39;t have cheese and then there was cheese on my beans.

la-alianza-restaurant-west-chicago,Daniel N.,ATWwRnKmeliRSdXe8usFAg,gHq_IWhj7hmvzPrDsWT8HA,"So my mom bought a groupon for this place and I was very skeptical about going at first. Especially after some of the previous reviews. From the look of the outside this place doesn&#39;t look like it would be that nice on the inside. But the inside was nicely decorated and had a good size bar. The inside also has a nice mesquite smell, since that&#39;s the type of wood they use in the kitchen.

We both ordered a margarita to start, since it came with the groupon. It was much larger than expected and very good. One of the previous reviews mentioned no salt on the rim but both of ours came with salt. We also had chips with guacamole, the green salsa, and the red salsa. I loved the guacamole it was fresh and tasted just right. Also the green salsa was very good. I didn&#39;t like the flavor of the red salsa but that could just be a personal preference.

Now  I had the steak burrito and my mom had the potato flautas. My burrito was the perfect size, not overly large like some places, and I really enjoyed the fresh avocado  in it. My mom thought the flautas were ok. But she usually doesn&#39;t order flautas anyway. 

Our server was also one of the owners. He was very friendly and easy to talk to. He honored the total value of the groupon, and the gratuity wasn&#39;t included in it. So I don&#39;t know what other reviews were talking about. When we were getting ready to leave he mentioned that they have karaoke on the weekends, and they have all different types of music. They also had lights setup on the inside like you would see at at dance club so people can dance along with the karaoke.

la-alianza-restaurant-west-chicago,Debbie L.,ozsqYDzCBlv6hAKlq5M2WA,VVUqShzh3rQK9OonkFufZQ,"I wanted to write this review because the one and only review for this restaurant did not give any feedback on food and not much on service. I also had a Groupon for this restaurant, and they did charge 18% gratuity upfront which they did tax. However, that is about all of the negative feedback I can give - the rest of our experience was delightful.

Our Groupon was for 2 drinks, guacamole, and 2 dinners up to $19.99 each. We went on Memorial Day Sunday - the weather that weekend was not super conducive to picnicking or barbecuing.  I really did not have super high expectations - the restaurant is located in a strip mall that has seen better days. But the inside of the restaurant was very nice - low lighting, beautiful tiled floors and walls, and lovely painted murals.

Once in, we were quickly seated. Although it was 6:30 or so, there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant. Our waiter Rene came over to take a drink order. Because of the other review, I mentioned the Groupon right off and there was NO issue. Rene brought our drinks. The margarita was cold and tasty, not homemade but did not skimp on the alcohol. Then a young lady came over to make salsa and guacamole to order. I again mentioned the Groupon, thinking that since the guacamole was included that it might be pre-made, not made to order. I was wrong though, and she made us some delicious guacamole - the ingredients all seemed very fresh. We also opted to have her make us both some red &amp; green salsa - I preferred the green and my honey preferred the red. They will make them as spicy or mild as you wish. One caveat here - when we got the bill, we saw we had been charged for the salsa, which is unusual in a Mexican joint. About $3 apiece, but portions were generous and both were delicious. Had I known up front though we likely would have selected one or the other.

We both ordered fajitas for our entrees - I got chicken and my man got steak. Both were very good, but due to the seemingly high quality and freshness of the ingredients. We both agreed that perhaps they should marinate the meats for a bit more flavor. Even so we would order again - the veggies were so flavorful and cooked to crisp-tender like we enjoy. The fajitas were served with pico de gallo, charro beans, and tortillas. The tortillas were homemade and super yummy - no comparison to packaged. My honey also asked for rice because he is not a bean fan. The waiter brought him both because he said he really wanted him to at least try the beans. He did and ate the whole bowl - they are not typical refried beans, it is more of a bean soup with whole pinto beans, large chunks of ham, and a nice smoky flavor. The rice was just OK - the beans were a better flavor choice.

As we ate, the restaurant got more &amp; more busy, but the service did not waver and we never felt we were being rushed. I really wanted to try the chocoflan for dessert, but I was just too full. We left, but not before telling Rene who seems to be the proprietor as well as a server how much we had enjoyed our meal and his restaurant. 

BONUS - when we got our bill, there was a coupon inside for $29.99 fajitas, margaritas, and guacamole for two for another visit. So we will be going back.  Give this place a try!",27/05/13,350,4,3,5,75,5.7975,3.49,1.168,32.343,No,3270

Location was easy to get to and the inside was nice compared to others in town we have visited.  We went on a Sunday evening and there was only one other couple there.  The drinks were GOOD; big and like others said, you could taste the alcohol.  Guacamole was decent as were the chips/salsa.  Now for the food, eh. Nothing wrong with it but nothing to write home about either.  I had enchiladas with mole (2 cheese, 1 chicken) and my sister had enchiladas suizas (beef).  My major gripe with the food was the cheese...it was like the monterrey jack and cheddar mix in a bag you get at the grocery store.  I found that incredibly weird when they could have used so many other delicious MEXICAN cheeses.  It ruined an otherwise decent mole.  They also used that cheese on the order of nachos we got and it never really melted on either dish.

I guess the best thing about this place is the waffle fries... just that nobody else has them in that shape. They still taste like a french fry. I was grateful that they didn&#39;t put much salt on the fries... I guess to balance out the sodium content in the chicken?? 

So today I got the chicken nugget meal. I paid over $8 for some tiny pieces of very, very salty chicken and room temperature waffle fries. Not worth it at all.

I have been hearing from everyone how Chick-Fil-A has the best waffle fries and the best chicken sandwiches. We wanted to grab a quick dinner the other night and we chose to check out Chick-Fil-A. We went in the restaurant because we wanted to see what they had. The drive thru is not the best way to experience a place, if you ask me. 

I&#39;m glad we went in to get our food. The staff is VERY friendly. The place is CLEEEEEAN!! There was probably 50-75 people in this joint and the place was hoppin&#39;; there were people cleaning tables and keeping the condiment station in order. Well trained staff, good job!!

We took a look over their menu and the nuggets stood out to me. My fiance went for the sandwich. We shared a large waffle fry and there was more than enough for the two of us. The nuggets were perfectly breaded. Here&#39;s my favorite part: they had a Chick-fil-a sauce that I tried. Seriously!! Best damn sauce they offer. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the sweet and sour, but their chick-fil-a sauce was like a smokey honey mustard, and it was excellent. I&#39;m not even really a fan of mustard but it was surprisingly good.

My fiance inhaled his sandwich, so I&#39;m guessing it was pretty good. I can&#39;t wait to go back and next time, we&#39;ll eat in because the fries were a little cooled off by the time we got home to eat.

Their chicken tenders are delicious and taste homemade (non-processed tasting if ya know what I mean). I also have a soft side for waffle fries and theirs were made just so - the right amount of soft center and crispy edges.

Finally, the cookies n cream shake took me over the edge. It was soooo good. By the time I got to it the thing was so melty and delicious that I just sat and slurped it down with no breaks in between. Can you say &#39;fat butt&#39;?

This place is no exception. As far as service goes, you will not find a better restaurant in the quick-service industry. EVERYONE is happy to serve you like you are the most important person in the world. (Well, second-most based on CFA&#39;s religious views.) They have employees in the dining area to tend to their guests to do things like offer refills (known as &#34;refreshing their beverage&#34;), take plates and even pour pepper on salads. This is above and beyond what most QSRs do.

However, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m a big fan of their chicken product. I don&#39;t know if it is because they use pressure cooking, but their chicken sandwiches themselves taste soggy and mealy. I like good service, but I like good food as well. And the food here does not resonate well with me. In addition, you only get 2 pickles on a sandwich and the rest of the toppings you add yourself. Also, no onions, and I&#39;m a big fan of the raw onion.

Also, expect long lines especially in the drive-thru. Even in this very liberal part of Illinois, Chick Fil A has LOTS of fans in the area who have no problem waiting 15-20 for their meal.

Ah how you have grown on me oh chick-fil-a burger! I can&#39;t say that I am on the addicted bandwagon, but the chicken burgers here are a nice change from the meat burgers of McD. Instead of finding a grinded up patty of chicken meat, you get whole chicken meat with crispy batter topped with a fresh bun with lettuce and cheese. You can customize it by adding on the different sauces they have (chick fil-a sauce, bbq, polynesian, sweet and sour, etc) The waffle fries are a huge plus, something about gigantic fries that you can dunk in the sauce. Great prices and quick service (I got my food even before paying)

Pro: fresh chicken burger, multiple sauces to customize your meal, waffle fries, quick service

Cons: close on Sundays, food is sometime too quick (i.e. it may have been sitting prepped already)

chick-fil-a-schaumburg,Peter K.,W-WTs-vofJqK_-rDUUJJlA,0RbSmqfeGgJr4bvwyH2QDA,"It&#39;s awesome that Chick-Fil-A finally moved to Schaumburg. They are a fast food like restaurant that serves food based off chicken.

I ate here when they were two weeks old so I expected there to still be a few kinks in their service and indeed there were. When you first walk into the store, it has the same look and feel as most Chick-Fil-A&#39;s with the same menu format and the same table set up as most other Chick-Fil-A&#39;s. However, since it is a rather busy place and more chaotic due to the heavy traffic it incurs, it&#39;s a bit crazy trying to figure out where the line for the registers form and how to navigate your way. Fortunately, the service people in front are holding up their hand when they&#39;re ready to take your order, but it&#39;s still difficult to figure out where to line up. Also, it&#39;s difficult to find a place to park the first time you&#39;re there, since the most natural place to park is next to the restaurant but the most intuitive place to park ends up being the place to the drive through.

The food quality and service are all decent. I was, however, a bit surprised that they didn&#39;t get my food order right the first time. I ordered a sandwich without pickles and my sandwich came with pickles. I also ordered ahead of three people and I got my food after them. Ordinarily, if my food was customized, I wouldn&#39;t mind for my food to come a bit later, but I ordered a generic meal so I was a bit surprised it took so long to come out.

All the chicken food here is awesome from their Chicken Sandwich Deluxes to their Salads to the Nuggets. I just enjoy eating a healthier meal (vs. something like a McDonald&#39;s) so I like coming here. I&#39;m sure this place will have the kinks worked out in a few weeks.

chick-fil-a-schaumburg,Rob W.,Xk4CO2zXLjdr3l4y7eo9fg,_5b7JDeXrHrWVquv6NoT6Q,"My review is the 26th for this place which has been open for a month. If that doesn&#39;t tell you how busy this place is, go see for yourself! I was there for lunch during the week and was lucky enough to find a decent parking spot and a place to sit in the restaurant. The drive-thru was jammed. Here&#39;s my thoughts:

Food: The waffle fries are excellent - great flavor and no signs of oil or grease. The chicken sandwiches are good and the portion is a decent size. My only thing with Chick-Fil-A is that my first experience with them was in suburban Atlanta, and I have yet to enjoy one of their chicken sandwiches as much as I enjoyed that first one. That one seemed to be spiced just a little differently - haven&#39;t found it to be the same since.

Service: Amazingly prompt for as busy as they were. One unusual thing that happened - an employee stopped by my table and asked if I&#39;d like a refill. Before I could reply, a manager (whose last name was the same as the store operator&#39;s name on the receipt - may have been his wife) pulled the employee away to talk to her about something that didn&#39;t sound too urgent.  Th employee returned a few minutes later and retrieved another drink for me.

I&#39;ll be back - though it may not be like my 1st experience, their chicken sandwiches are still pretty good and filling. Good to see this chain in the Chicago area - the more food offerings the better!",13/10/11,148,3,3,4,78,3.7242000000000006,1.504,0.308,12.189,No,1423

I get it now. I really do. Never has a cherry popping been so delicious. THAT chicken! So tender, so juicy. They only sell chicken things, and they do it right. The Spicy Chicken Deluxe meal that I ordered made me very happy. It was spicy, there was pepperjack cheese, there were WAFFLE FRIES (the superior of all fries, it goes, in this order of awesomeness: waffle, curly, crinkle, thick-cut, then shoe-string. tots not included, obvi), and so many sauces! And an IceDream cone to round out the meal? (Banana pudding shake would have been overkil). I was in fat kid heaven.

It was pretty busy at an off-peak hour on a holiday, but the staff were really enthusiastic and efficient. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever encountered such friendly fast-food staff. The guy who took our order gave us SO MANY SAUCES! There were other employees around the store keeping it clean. Love the mayo and ketchup (squeeze or dip!) options at their condiments counter too. Breakfast menu seems totally awesome. Chicken biscuit, get in my mouth please.

Sure, this is not destination or fine dining. But, if you&#39;re looking for a flavorful chicken sandwich in the area, Chick-Fil-A will not disappoint - get the spicy chicken! Plus, a meal for 2 only set us back $13. Winner winner, chicken (sandwich) dinner!",05/07/12,204,4,3,5,56,7.585000000000001,4.837,0.521,22.642999999999997,No,1482

After three visits, I can honestly say my past KFC sandwiches have been more crispy (the chicken), the bread less soggy (than Chick-Fil-A&#39;s) and a better overall value.

Additionally, my cottage-cut fries were crispy on my first visit (the week they opened to much undeserved fanfare), but the fries have been too salty and floppy the last two times.

So that&#39;s it, they don&#39;t deserve 5 stars. If you really think they&#39;re better than KFC or Popeye&#39;s, please do yourself a favor and try the latter again to make sure your perception of the Chick-Fil-A brand isn&#39;t overpowering your taste buds.

Better yet, stick with Wendy&#39;s Spicy Chicken Sandwich, which is simply an A+ compared to the sandwich lauded at Chick-Fil-A.

If it&#39;s other fast food, i.e. McDonalds, it gets 4 stars.  And if it&#39;s high end fast food a la Smashburger, it&#39;s a solid 3 stars.  Let&#39;s go with that.

There&#39;s not really much point to reviewing fast food - it&#39;s cheap, it&#39;s bad for you and it&#39;s the same across the country.  But there are few Chick-Fil-A&#39;s in the Chicago area so I might as well.  The best part about the chicken here is the southern-fried coating, which has a better flavor than anything KFC has to offer and seems to lock in the moisture pretty well.

There&#39;s nothing special or fancy or 5-star worthy about it. It&#39;s cheap, fast, and anything but good for you. At least if it tasted really good, I could justify the calories and fat content once in a while. 

I was dragged against to CFA against my own will - my dinner date just HAD to have one of those coveted chicken sandwiches. I was starving, my blood sugar was dropping, and I was getting cranky so I didn&#39;t put up a fight. At that point, I was about to chew off my own arm and wasn&#39;t in the mood for a wait at a sit down restaurant.

As much as I try to eat healthy, I wasn&#39;t about to come to the infamous Chick-Fil-A for the first time and order a salad or a wrap. So I opted for some chicken nuggets, a diet coke and a handful of my dinner companion&#39;s waffle fries. Were they good? They weren&#39;t bad. But they certainly weren&#39;t the best nuggs I&#39;ve ever eaten. Not to mention I couldn&#39;t help but think I was eating pieces of chicken pumped with hormones and no beak. (I think watching certain food documentaries has warped my mind).

I was overwhelmed with the sauce choices so I went with BBQ, Polynesian, and the Chick-Fil-A sauce. The BBQ sauce was fine - very standard. The Polynesian was your typical sweet &amp; sour. The CFA sauce - gross. It tasted of fats and egg yolks.The fries were okay - they weren&#39;t overly greasy (which is nice) but I would have preferred them a little crispier. I watched my sidekick inhale a deluxe chicken sandwich, so I&#39;m guessing he thought it was pretty good.

Let&#39;s be honest here. Chick-Fil-A is FAST FOOD. So, it&#39;s hard for me to push past the 2-star zone. If I did, I&#39;d be putting Chick-Fil-A in the same category as some renown Chi-town restaurants.

The staff were genuinely friendly with the children. They have disposable table covers that stick to the table for young children to eat over.

The chicken is so juicy and filling. The waffle fries are beyond awesome! The food is not greasy and does not taste like they&#39;ve been deep frying the fries in 1 year old oil like other food chains I&#39;ve been to. The staff are very polite and display very good customer service.

I even noticed and LOVE the way they clean their tables. It&#39;s not a yucky dish towel that has been dipped under water and wiped on every table each time w/o being cleaned after each use. They use wipes from a wipes container. How frigging awesome is that! I don&#39;t have to worry about a yucky towel smudge of water on the table when I sit down.

The food was surprisingly great. They also had great customer service- people came around and actually checked to see I was enjoying my meal and to see if they could get me anything. It was sort of impressive. The store its self was clean and organized and sort of crazy with a double drive-thru that looked a bit like the tollway. Only at the end of paying your toll, you get chicken. Also, given the state of our tollways, the food may have actually been cheaper.

I also like that they are closed on Sunday. It&#39;s rare to see that sort of nicety in the fast food industry on behalf of faith or the employees or both. Any way you look at it, good for them.

So I was excited to hear that chick-fil-a was coming to Schaumburg.  I&#39;ve always enjoyed their chicken here.  Some people find the batter to be a bit bland, but I&#39;ve never really experienced that.  For a fast food place, chick-fil-a is semi healthy.  most sandwiches are under 500 calories.  None of their sandwiches come with sauce, so that allows you to put whatever and how ever much sauce you want on your sandwich.  I&#39;m very happy to say that they have Texas Pete hot sauce here which I have been deprived of for so long.  

My favorite by far is the Chicken Biscuit w/ Texas Pete applied liberally.  The biscuit is tender, not dry, and of course the chicken is delish.  The spicy chicken is also very good.  

As for the fries and extras, I can&#39;t really speak much about them.  The fries are ordinary waffle fries.

The Schaumburg store is clean and the staff is friendly.  It&#39;s extremely crowded now, but that&#39;s only because it is the newest place to eat.  There really isn&#39;t a whole lot to do in Schaumburg except eat or go shopping.

This was my first visit, so I went for the basic Chick-Fil-A sandwich meal with medium drink and waffle fries.

After wading through the dining area looking for a CLEAN table (c&#39;mon, Chick-Fil-A!) I finally found a spot right in front of the enclosed kids&#39; playground. 

I would say the chicken sandwich was good...moist and tasty. But it only came with a couple of pickles. Definitely could&#39;ve used some lettuce, maybe a tomato and some mayonnaise. 

The waffle fries were just average.

chick-fil-a-schaumburg,Eduardo E.,sCgTEU9qRRuVCSxi6-142w,blbyhcWuBKjAs5LId093EQ,"I&#39;ve always had fond memories of Chick-Fil-A. As a child in the 70&#39;s , down in Springfield Illinois, we used to pick up Chick-Fil-A sandwiches at the mall carryout. They didn&#39;t have sit down restaurants back then, and their menu was very basic. Southern style, chicken sandwiches with pickles on them. Delicious.

The Original sandwich is exactly the same. Delicious. But oddly, I found my meal today not filling, even with the waffle fry side. I could have easily eaten a couple of them, but refrained. Now, maybe way back when I was  a teen I was consuming several at a sitting, but still, you don&#39;t want to leave a restaurant still hungry after ordering a combo.

Last time I went, I had a shake as well, and was satisfied, but that&#39;s not something you want to do every time, unless your mission is obesity. Maybe adding another healthy side would do the trick.

The service and sandwich are still a 10.
The waffle fries are a meh.
The side salad is an 8

Our standard deluxe chicken sandwiches were not huge, but they each had a nice hunk of tasty, tender, real chicken, not reconstituted patties of who-knows-what chicken parts. Even without mayo, the sandwiches were so good, we still didn&#39;t need to add any of the sauce packets we sampled, all of which were good as well. We instead used the sauces as dips for our real potato waffle fries. I say real, because the strings at McD&#39;s for example, taste more like salted cardboard. The cole slaw we had on the side was also enjoyable.

Our very friendly and professional cashier handed us our food almost instantly on the busy evening we visited. Elsewhere, other employees made deliveries to some tables and kept the place clean, while the cow mascot was hard at work entertaining children, stopping by various tables, and dancing with one of the patrons.

It&#39;s still fast food.  Is their chicken sandwich better than Mc D&#39;s, Wendy&#39;s or other joints?  Perhaps.  I don&#39;t really go out of my way for chicken, unless it&#39;s Harolds or Wings.

Pretty freaking delicious.  As soon as I cut it in half, the cheese just oozed out like delicious cheesy lava.  If you don&#39;t like messy burgers, that may not be for you.  But I didn&#39;t mind.  It&#39;s cheese, for crying out loud!  The service was also friendly and helpful.  Our server recommended the toasted marshmallow milkshake.  It was very good, but also very rich.  I had to split it with a friend to finish it.

I think I like it here.  Not just the staff, but the clientele.  When a very rude and drunk patron got in a waitress&#39;s face and started yelling at cursing at her, the other customers and staff yelled at him to &#34;Get the hell out of here!&#34;  People of Elgin: You Rule.

Burgers made delicious 
Sweet Potato Fries excellent
Onion Strings sinfully good.
Very Clean environment.

Negatives:
Wait Staff well.... They are all dressed lovely. I say this as a sincere compliment. Some of the waitresses are not good at serving. You have to ask for every little obvious thing like napkins, etc.. and there is a long wait for them to come back with what you need. I feel that maybe this is because more of the people who eat there dine on their food vouchers ( rewards), maybe they don&#39;t tip well etc.. I don&#39;t know I am just guessing. When I go in there I feel like saying, I&#39;m spending my money in here instead of the casino. Please give me a waitress who knows how to serve and in exchange I will tip well. Maybe I might try that next time :)

Chicken Wings appetizer. Chicken tasted raw and out of the coop. You know that fowl fresh smell. undercooked.

Salmon with veggies. Salmon needs a better marinade very fowl seafood smell.  Needs better prep.

Bring a sweater if you get cold easily, it has a very cold draft in many seating spots.

I ordered a burger to go it costs me $13.00 and it was wrapped like I went to Wendy&#39;s in foil with fries in a bag. I didn&#39;t spend that amount of money to have it poorly wrapped. Give me a proper container for a to go order.",10/09/13,210,4,2,5,29,6.203600000000001,4.825,0.405,18.77,No,1699

They have so many tempting burgers to choose from.  I&#39;ve had several and my faves so far are the Mushroom Burger w/Gruyere cheese &amp; the Thai Chicken Burger.  Yum!  You can build your own burger creation as well choosing from their various burgers, topping and buns. All the burgers come with regular fries (this isn&#39;t clearly stated on the menu as far as I could tell) but you can upgrade for a small charge and get some other great fries like the White Truffle Fries (OMG, these are AMAZING) or the Sweet Potato Fries (very good, but not OMG like the Truffle Fries).

They also have an extensive list of libations with fun names.  Each burger has a cocktail &amp; wine suggestion with it (might have a beer suggestion too, I&#39;m not sure).  I&#39;ve had one of the leaded (alcoholic) milk shakes in the past as well as tried a few cocktails.  One of their fun martinis is plenty for me!

Let me first start off by saying, the service there is always fantastic, That&#39;s never a problem. The issue I had was with the food.  The devil is in the details!!!!

The Asian Chicken Burger was excellent. However, the signature truffle fries were a bit under cooked. If you are going to serve fries with truffle oil, please make the crispy first.  My wife had a custom Kobe beef burger on a pretzel bun with sweet potato fries.  She lucked out, both were fantastic.  I on the other hand had a custom Bison burger with shredded bacon and provolone, on Ciabatta roll with onion strings.  My burger was cooked perfectly, but the bun wasn&#39;t toasted, so the bottom was soggy and non-existent. The onion stings were also under cooked and disgusting.  I really wanted to enjoy it, but I just couldn&#39;t.

At the end of the day, I didn&#39;t want to say anything in front of our client, because he thoroughly enjoyed his Asian burger and was OK with the truffle fries.

I will go back tomorrow (being Sunday) and tell them of my experience, so that my food is made exactly the way I expect it should be,",23/06/12,150,2,1,4,-39,3.5061,2.698,1.139,13.164000000000001,No,1292

I like the fact that you have a large variety of build your own burger, they even have salmon and Kobe beef (not sure how &#34;pure&#34; it is but I will say the Kobe beef patty at only $2 more than the sirloin burger is damn well worth it if you&#39;re a carnivore).

It came with onion rings on it which I took off because they just made the burger too big for my mouth. It was like having two different sides :) The Juicy Louise here is the closest I have had to Matt&#39;s bar in Minneapolis (still the best in my opinion).

I like that there are different meat options (a couple of different beef options, buffalo, turkey, chicken, etc.) and there are a lot of fancy ass sauces and mayos to add on too.

First we take a look at their beers. They could have better choices when it comes to imports. I was going to have a Stella on tap. Nope, they were out. Ok we&#39;ll just have a Coke. When they came, they were flat. Finally flag down the waitress to let her know and ask for water instead. We also ordered the Onion Strings. They were ok. It&#39;s tough to mess up fried onions. They were served with runny ranch dressing and ketchup. Plain was better.

I ordered the surf and turf burger because I love lobster and I had one once in Vegas and loved it. Yeah, this one, I did not love. The lobster tail was raw. Flag down the manager and let her know. She looks at it and says it sure is and takes it back to the kitchen. She comes back explaining that he grabbed it our of the wrong pot..blah blah blah. I don&#39;t really care how it happened. It shouldn&#39;t have happened. She tells us she&#39;s taking it off the bill. Good thing because the replacement was overcooked. Can&#39;t find a happy medium?

Yes, they are expensive, but if you know that ahead of time and are willing to pay the price, then don&#39;t complain.  I would estimate that they have 15 speciality burgers, and the menu also recommends specific drinks (alcoholic and non) as well as shakes that pair best with the burger.  I thought that was a cool feature that most places don&#39;t have.  Personally, I love the fact that you can customize your own burger.  Choice of Buns, Cheeses, Burger type (Hamburger, Kobe Burger, Chicken breast, turkey burger, plus some more), toppings, sauces.  So many combinations that you could come up with.  Little doubt in my mind that you could make your favorite combination and be pleased with the burger.  I also like the fact that they will cook the patty either flame broiled or griddle seared (aka Burger King vs McDonald&#39;s).  Shakes are amazing here as well.

I have never had an issue with the service.  Most of the time it is very good.  Some times it has just been average, but it has never been bad.  Atmosphere here excels.  Love the tiling they used on the floor, and the booths are pretty cool looking.  Very comfortable, chic vibe going on.

Our server, Jill, was an absolute gem, and she was so helpful.  A bunch of us did the build-your-own-burger option, so we were kinda high maintenance, and she was very roll-with-the-flow about it.  She even teased us about it, and I appreciate a waitress with a sense of humor!

We started with drinks--my friends got beer, and mixed drinks.  I tried their flight of three martinis for $12.  TOTALLY worth the value.  These babies are NOT small and they are SO, SO strong.  So if you&#39;re the DD, or you actually want to be coherant while playing in the casino, you might want to skips ordering one of these babies.

But anyway, the food was DELICIOUS!  The macaroni and cheese balls were really, really good, but my personal favorite of the night was the chili cheese fries I was able to upgrade to with my burger.  They were phenomenal, and they hit the spot.  Everyone else was raving about their burgers, too.  The Kobe beef is outstanding!

The &#34;leaded&#34; banana milkshake was incredible as well.  I might have stolen a couple sips of my friends&#39;.  Just sayin&#39;...

The food was great. We had the mac and cheese things to start and they were super good. I ordered the garlic burger and my boyfriend ordered the Kobe. We both really really liked our burgers. We didn&#39;t get the special fries because we didn&#39;t even know about them until we already had placed our order. But we saw some other people that got them and they looked pretty yummy.

We went on a Saturday night and were immediately seated. Basically, if I wasn&#39;t on a strict diet right now, I would probably eat here 7 days a week -- the food here is that good. You have your choice of meats--beef, kobe beef, salmon, turkey, etc. and your choice of buns, toppings, fries, etc.  So I got a beef burger with BBQ sauce and boy was it good! The fries are really good as well. My wife had a lobster grilled cheese and she loved it.  They have complimentary potato chips that are really good as well. I was tempted to try a milkshake, but that would definitely exceed my calorie limit for the day.  Plus, they are very reasonably priced (avg $10 per burger) and the service is really good.

Our waitress was very friendly and interactive with the table.  She got all of our orders correct, which we all were very please about.  The interior of the restaurant was modern retro look, which was pleasing.  The chairs that we sat on were very comfy.  We shared Mac and Cheese ball which were fried.  The exterior had a nice crunch to them and the interior was very cheesy.  It was mac and cheese heaven on a plate.  I ordered the Drunken Bull Burger medium rare, but when it came out to me it was well done.  This burger also had blue cheese, which I&#39;m not a fan of.  So I was able to sub it out with pepper jack.  The burger was very juicy and well season, something you expect from a burger house.  I ordered a side of steak fries, which were typical steak fries you can get anywhere else.  I didn&#39;t finish eating them because the burger was very filling.  One of my friends ordered a milk shake while he had his meal.  So I was craving one for dessert, but they were really big shakes.  We asked our waitress we were able to split it into 2 separate cups.  She told us it was not a problem.  My friend and I ordered the creme brle shake which we split.  I was very good and it didn&#39;t last too long in our separate cups.  The reason I&#39;m giving this 4.5 stars is because my burger didn&#39;t come out the way I ordered it and the steak fries.

It is a very trendy place, lots of circles in the decorations. One of the best parts about the atmosphere is the diner now has an option to watch TV at their table. You have an option of about three channels but that is more than most places let you choose. 

The food was great! My husband and I both got the build your own burgers with skinny fries. The fries are good and come with so many options. You can get steak fries, white truffle, cheese, sweet potato, chili cheese, or the plain skinny ones which we got. The burger was perfect. I ordered it medium and it came out medium and smelling so good. 

The shakes were also amazing. We tasted the Creamsicle and Creme Brulee. I would recommend trying both of them and maybe even being a little adventurous and trying one of their Leaded shakes (alcohol)

That&#39;s where the upside ends. My girlfriend and I waited for sometime to get a table and were eventually seated, I ordered a beer which they were out of (they only have 4 taps, that hard to stay in stock?) and there seemed to warrant a long discussion about trying to get a different one. After about 20 minutes, our waitress came back with my drink and took our food order. 

I ordered the Prairie Fire Buffalo Burger with the White Truffle Fries, and the significant other got the Thai Chicken Burger. After about 30 minutes we got our food. I should have taken a picture of my brown and light green mound of food. Both of our meals were absolutely terrible. Both burgers were #1 and #2 as the worst burgers I have ever put past my lips. The ground chicken patty was inedible, with a texture and taste worse than gas station chicken nuggets. White Truffle at prime is code for Parmesan cheese and parsley. 

Not only this, When our meals were served, my girlfriend decided to get one of their iced down $12 &#34;cocktails&#34;. After sometime had passed, I had heard the bartender complaining that no one had picked up this drink and that he was not going to make it again. I got up, picked up the watery and warm drink myself and brought it to the table. 

After over an hour of not seeing my waitress to get another drink, a napkin for my grease sponge of a burger or even to check on us, I had to walk over to the hostess stand to find a manager and waited another fifteen minutes to talk to him, he disappeared again to see what he could do for us, which turned out to be nothing. What a shock, waiting for nothing at Prime. 

I spent nearly 3 hours at prime to see my waitress once to order food.  She was from Russia but she sure wasn&#39;t rushin&#39;.   They had commented they were very busy and sorry they couldn&#39;t have had better service. Yet, including my table, there were six total tables. There were four waitresses, a hostess, two managers, six people in the kitchen and two bartenders and still got no help. 

I had a $50 check for 2 burgers and 2 drinks and 3 hours of my life forever wasted in this pit of despair.

prime-burgerhouse-elgin,Irene Z.,P1ttJQl6pdfSGUa9V4o-6g,EkfK5VYVe8HIhu_vIoFXbg,"I&#39;m giving this one star, and it&#39;s on the basis that I did not get the opportunity to try the food here because the customer service is beyond awful.

Granted, the day we came was Wednesday following the blizzard, but if I&#39;m not mistaken, customer service should be first priority for a restaurant, blizzard or not.  If you&#39;re open, it&#39;s because you can cater to your customers, correct?

Prior to arriving, we called the casino to confirm they were open and in operation. We had originally wanted to go to the buffet and were told that it was open, but of course, when we arrived (after a 40 minute drive), the buffet was closed. So...after making a phone call to the casino switchboard to let them know they gave us wrong info (and receiving an &#39;oh well, not our problem&#39; attitude), we went to Prime.  We waited 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us...mind you, this was in clear view of the bartender who saw us standing &amp; waiting there and did nothing to flag down a host or any waitstaff.  When the host finally greeted us, he gestured toward the bar and the 5 tables they had decided to open, told us they were too full for our party...and to go to the Deli next door.

We left, but then decided to try carry out.  If we couldn&#39;t eat there, well then maybe we could get some warm burgers and take them home, or eat in the lobby (ha).  So, we went back, attempted to flag the bartender down, and after 10 or so minutes (and after he was done just chit chatting with people), he came over.  We asked if we could do carryout and he disdainfully told us that there was only one burger available for us to carry out and that if we wanted to do that, we&#39;d have to wait a while.

We were, however, not the only party to be turned away...which made me feel better, but at the same time solidifies my low opinion of the service here...why turn away business when you can open up more tables??  So we, like the 12 or so other people who were turned away, stood in line at the Deli to attempt to get something to eat.

We&#39;ve been coming to Grand Victoria over the years for the buffet, Fox n Hounds (previously what Prime was), and the casino itself, and it has rapidly deteriorated in customer service and in its offerings.

In my opinion, don&#39;t attempt to go to Prime unless you&#39;re already at the riverboat to play.  Sad I can&#39;t judge the food, but I can definitely say not worth the drive just to possibly have to encounter the same host or bartender we had to.

I had heard a lot about it from people and the prices did not seem bad, so we gave it a try. Im really glad we did!!! We ended up getting a table about 8:30pm and they asked if we wanted a booth or a table, and that the booths had tvs on them. Of course I picked the booth with the tv so we could watch the Hawks game that was starting soon!! I loved the decor of the restaurant, very modern...we felt like we were sitting in IKEA and LOVED everything about it(I mean my friend wanted to ask the waitress if they would sell thier salt and pepper shakers)
 Our waitress came by and took our drink order, We ordered a coors, magic hat and then my one friend ordered the loaded creamsicle. The creamsicle was outstanding, but I could see that they would be verrrry dangerous because you could not even taste any alcohol in it!!
for dinner I ordered the build-your-own-burger with a turkey patty on a pretzel roll. It came with fries but for a dollar more I added cheese to my fries. This turkey burger was the biggest Ive ever seen and it was only 9 bucks!!! It had a ton of flavor and was cooked just right, and being on a pretzel bun made it even better!! the fries were crispy and loaded with the cheese sauce, I recommend spending the extra dollar on the cheese!!

If I could do a 1/2 star, I&#39;d say 3 1/2 but I&#39;d rather go with 4 than 3 not having that option. Had a jumbo shrimp appitizer, buffalo burger, side salad and martini which, with tax, came to about $40. Add tip, $50ish. 

I prefer the buffalo burger at Emmett&#39;s Tavern in West Dundee but Prime&#39;s is OK. You get fries with your order or pay and extra $1 for a variety of sides, including a salad. Side sald was a little bland, the blue cheese dressing didn&#39;t have any zing either but the greens were fresh. The shrimp had a little too much of an oder / taste that gave it a bit of an aged/frozen and thawed sensation. I have to accomodate for the fact that we&#39;re no where near the ocean but even given that room for play on points, it wasn&#39;t great, even though the texture was good. (Not over or under cooked.) Maybe if they put a tinge of lemon to get rid of the less than freshness? 

Will I go back? Maybe. Value for money spent is debatable but, if I go for the wings rather than the shrimp and coke rather than Belvedere vodka it may tip the scale. as the price would come down.

prime-burgerhouse-elgin,Doug W.,snPPdkLrd6dX1wRdYqSq3g,lEwOXW9PWesdj4dnJAy1Ng,"I am so disappointed in writing this review because I really, really wanted this place to be good.  We have been wanting to go to this place ever since it opened because of its neat concept with &#34;high-end&#34; burgers.  Yet on a Thursday night, with absolutely very limited business in the restaurant, it took us about 2 hours to eat in this place.  

We waited at least 45 minutes to get our food which included our appetizer!  

Now our server Brittany, is an excellent waitress who offered great recommendations for our dining.  But unfortunately, the problem was the help in the kitchen and the fact that we think we may have seen a manager of the restaurant, but nobody besides our waitress came around to check on us.  In my opinion, if you are trying to get people into your restaurant, you definitely don&#39;t want them to wait about 2 hours while they could be gambling at the casino!  

Brittany explained that the restaurant is having some growing issues and we definitely experienced that last night.  My prime-burger was ratre when I ordered it medium well.  The kobe burger was tender but also undercooked too.  The side of guacamole that I requested came &#34;brown&#34; but Brittany did replace it almost immediately when it was pointed out.

On a separate side note, how could a bartender with 10 seconds left in a NCAA game, change the channel when customers are watching the TV when the game is going to be decided in the final seconds???  But I digress.

Eventually, we will come back to this restaurant to give it another shot because there is a need for it.  But unless some TLC is put into this place (besides from the hostess and wait staff), this place will not be as excellent as it could be.",25/03/11,177,1,1,1,10,0.9358999999999998,1.26,0.601,13.139,No,1723
prime-burgerhouse-elgin,Scott A.,K-33joLzLIwr5T_RljBsTg,kcEWAHVCdEgTcDpYIMI7gQ,"A sexy more adult spin on the ol&#39; soda fountain scene. It&#39;s fun, unpretentious, and unique with hip drinks, alcoholic Milkshakes, provocatively dressed servers, and over-the-top burgers made of only the absolute finest ingredients. 

Despite it&#39;s riverboat casino location, I really just love the concept of this place! Maybe because it&#39;s so different than the norm or that they try to take casual classic American dishes nearly everyone loves and spare no expense in making them as best as possible ...or perhaps its all the subtle sexual innuendos steering the vibe to a more saucy and risqu adult feel (subtle enough to still be good for kids at least during reasonable hours). I don&#39;t know but I&#39;m definitely a fan. 

If you go, know whatever you order it will be over-the-top! They have at least six types of fries. 13 or more types of alcoholic (leaded) and non-alcoholic (unleaded) milkshakes that come in glasses that must be at least a foot tall and with a mammoth straw to suck it down. Every burger on the menu is a complex creation such as the Drunken Bull (from their menu... a Kobe Burger with Sauteed Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Crispy Prosciutto, May Tag Blue Cheese Cabernet Reduction on Grilled Pretzel Bun). Never fear, if you like your burgers simple or just want to make your own ultra burger creation, the build-your-own menu (only shown in the Magazine Menu) is beyond words and virtually allows you to build any burger you want and I do mean virtually ANY burger! The menu doesn&#39;t even show all the options of which I count 6 patty types, 7 different buns, 4 versions of the standard condiments, 8 cheeses, 8 sauces, 4 dressings, and at least 12 additional toppings. The meat is ground fresh daily on their on site butchery and no worries about your religious beliefs on charbroiling vs flat top grilling; it&#39;s your choice. 

Like I said, I really love the concept of this place. So why only the three stars? Well, I&#39;ve been here three times and they have yet to cook the meat as ordered ...even upon sending it back! I mean really...if your ENTIRE concept is centered around high-end burgers a basic element of that is being able to cook &#39;em right! PLEASE... I asked for rare+ and got well-done! Funny, as that was on the re-order, the original came out medium! Management did graciously take it off my bill but I personally would have been much more interested in just getting any awesome burger the way I wanted it. 

Still, I will try Prime again and if you&#39;re OK with the riverboat casino scene and all that goes with it, I would recommend you try this place out; at least once if nothing else just for the experience. 

If you do go and create your own personal ultimate burger, send a note or message with your bad-a__ creation and let me know how it was. And don&#39;t forget the name ...you know every legendary burger has one!",18/04/10,338,3,2,5,35,7.8017,3.5829999999999997,0.277,18.141000000000002,No,2909

prime-burgerhouse-elgin,Grady K.,mlXejAKpA4dHXlnT7_pukQ,KxzcgohcYbgU6DooRCScNA,"Been meaning to Yelp for a while, so here is my first review.  There is one caveat- Prime had been open for just one week at the time when I dined there.

Prime is a classy burger bar located in GV Casino; the decor is striking and modern, in shimmery red and black.  I was greeted by not one, but three hostesses who sat our group of six in a huge booth.  The seating is comfortable and spacious.

Rather than writing a lengthy review, I will just list my thoughts.

Positive-
The food is great!  There are hundreds of possible combinations with all the options to build your own burger.
Waitstaff was very friendly 
Classy decor
Great seating
Prices are reasonable

Negative-
Drinks took 20 minutes to arrive
Appetizers took another 10 minutes (30 total)
Food took another 25 minutes (waited nearly an hour for a cheeseburger)
Neither waitress or supervisor were able to split the check properly


Conclusion-
With great food and caring staff, Prime will be a great place once they get the routine down.  Gambler or not, if you are looking for a great burger consider going to Prime.  Just wait a few months before you go.",28/12/09,127,3,1,4,4,3.9191000000000003,1.992,0.044,8.963999999999999,No,1124

The Lobster tail was very fresh (i ate that seperate from the burger) Comes with a melted butter cup and a side of fries or fresh veg&#39;s. The burger was very tasty and done just right (medium) Very friendly staff and IMO very decent pricing.

I only went in because most people on Yelp recommend this place highly, and I stopped in at the Village Offices and they recommended Wee Dee&#39;s, so I thought it must be delicious. 

FOOD COMMENTS: The pita bread was outstanding and honestly, it was a good value as a basic meal without fries or drink.  But for my taste, there was too much salt and too much grease used to heat the chicken. My chicken pita was good.  I would stop in again, if I was desperate, but I would ask them to fry my chicken dry without oil and I would take it to go.

GENERAL COMMENTS: It&#39;s basically a tiny corner hot dog stand kind of place with seating for roughly 16-20 patrons. When I say greasy I mean windows, door handles, surfaces, and the food.

Service:
Ridiculously fast. Faster than any drive thru fast! I didn&#39;t order precooked items either. 

Atmosphere:
This place feels like the setting for a haunted fast food place in the middle of a forgotten part of the city lol. It has creepy clocks and an old school dining area. Not to mention the bathroom is unsettling. Flickering lights, weird humming noise, cracked tiles, and the slightly faulty faucet. Don&#39;t take a gal here. This is one of those places where you go to eat and be content with the fatty foods you just ate. 

Food:
The speed of how fast the food came out made me a tad worried, but everything came out presented well and the taste did not disappoint. And the price for quality and quantity is phenomenal! Seriously, the gut bursting amount of food you get for under $10 is cray cray. I am most impressed at how crispy and clean cut their fries are. Their Double Pizza Burger was the Greasy Goodness. It wasn&#39;t overly greasy, but it was packed with flavor. The quality of beef on that burger tasted well above the price I paid for it.

I was craving a Gyro so decided to see what was around by my work, and when I saw the Vienna Beef sign I was like hey what this place ? and if nothing else I know I can get a Chicago Dog and fries

so I stopped in here and got me a Gyro and Fries and a small soda think it was around $6 that not bad for lunch, and the Gyro was yummy and the fries were fresh and hot, and as my BF pointed out the other day we have not had bad fries here I don&#39;t know what it is but we always got bad fries in Seattle, plus I love all the places that have fresh cut fries here 

went back a couple days ago and had the Maxwell Street Polish, it was flame grilled to a nice crispy goodness and they put all the topping on it, just like a Chicago Dog oh so good

I went here on my lunch break for something quick and cheap and got exactly that from their buffet. I can&#39;t say it was the most expansive of Chinese buffets I&#39;ve been to but it got the job done. 

I enjoyed the eggrolls (I had 3 of them); they were made with the crispier thinner rice paper instead of a wanton wrapper like so many other Chinese restaurants use. This resulted in a lightly lighter eggroll that promoted more of the flavor of the filling which was enjoyable. I would advise, however, to stay away from the &#34;spicy&#34; mustard; there was so much horseradish in the mustard it ruined pretty much everything it touched. I also had the fried rice, which really wasn&#39;t special in any way; it&#39;s pretty hard to make a bad fried rice. I will say that the texture of the rice was nice a fluffy, not overly starchy, sticky, or mushy, so kudos to that. I also sampled the vegetable lo mien which was filling. The flavor of the lo mien was mediocre but it also had a potent underlying garlic flavor that was overpowering and I will most likely be tasting it for the remainder of the day. As for the protein dishes, I tried the sesame chicken and the kung-pow beef. Both items were tasty and the texture was not unappealing. The chicken was liberally sauced and sprinkled with a lot of sesame seeds, however, did seem sticky and it kind of clumped together but I wasn&#39;t using my hands to eat it so it didn&#39;t matter. When I was at the buffet line, it seemed like someone had stood there and picked most of the beef out of the kung-pow beef (not the restaurant&#39;s fault); luckily there were still some pieces of beef and lots of tasty mushrooms. 

The restaurant itself was clean, relatively quiet for lunch time, but I&#39;m not complaining, though I will complain about the guy at the next table that slurped and burped everything he got from the buffet... gross (again, not the restaurant&#39;s fault). The server was quick and friendly which was impressive considering he seemed to be the only one there and helped those of us dining in but also the customers who were there for carry out. 

This place delivered exactly what I needed, quick and inexpensive food. By no means is this a fancy place; It&#39;s not the best Chinese and it&#39;s not the worst, it falls somewhere in the middle as far as quality is concerned and in some instances mediocrity is okay. I would come here before I go to a Panda Express, but that&#39;s not saying much.

 As far as the other items on the buffet i wouldnt touch unless i was homeless and starving. The meat was unidentifiable on every section of the buffet. I tried the sweet and sour pork cut it in 1/2 and the meat was a dark, off colored meat that was texturaly disgusting. The egg rolls are different and not bad but definitely had better. There was something not right about the meat on this buffet.

In addition, the owner of the place seemed to be the only one working at this time and he was talking to a couple of customers he must have known and they were talking and laughing about cats and cat food and the 2 customers talking how they will be shitting on the toilet the rest of the afternoon and the owner laughing.

Food:
Crab Rangoon - heavy on the cream cheese, but smooth and mild flavored. Very good. Pair it with their awesome sweet &amp; sour sauce and they&#39;re heavenly.

Sweet &amp; Sour sauce - not super thick or super cloying like a red colored syrup. Very good.

Shrimp fried rice - huge portion, but mild in flavor. Expect a healthy amount of quarter size shrimp! Might need something to punch up the flavoring here.

Chicken with cashew - tender, delicious chicken in a fabulous brown sauce. Good ratio of veggies to chicken. Crispy orange bell peppers &amp; crunchy cashews.

Curry chicken - yellow curry, mild heat and a bit sweet. Lots of onion chunks, FYI.

Over all : I loved the place. My favorite was the chicken cashew. Next time I&#39;m skipping the shrimp fried rice and trying the chicken or veggie fried rice.

The Pot Stickers were little ball bearings of dense meat wrapped in a gummy dumpling dough.  They didn&#39;t even do a good job of searing the pot stickers and the filling was dense and flavorless.

The Orange Chicken was overly sweet and didn&#39;t have any of the spicy component that one expects with the sauce for this dish.

Quick &amp; easy, and  based on the amount of take-out business they were doing as well as already having several tables dining at 6 p.m. on a weeknight I&#39;d say they are a popular place.

We tried the Crab Rangoon, the fried Potstickers &amp; the Happy Family dish.  Everything was very good.  The Potstickers were fat with meat filling &amp; the veggies &amp; various meats in the Happy Family were plentiful.

They were a bit stingy with the sauce packets however, just one spicy mustard, 2 sweet &amp; sour &amp; 2 soy sauce packets.

Outside of Chinatown, I&#39;m simply not a fan of most Chinese restaurants in Chicago. That is what makes my love of a strip mall Chinese restaurant in Elgin out of the norm.

Green Jade has won me over  for several reasons. The food is really good without being incredibly greasy. The menu is diverse and pretty strong all around, so the chicken dishes are just as good as the seafood ones. Green Jade also recognizes that quantity can not make me overlook quality. So many restaurants, not just Chinese , give me a ton of their mediocre food and it seems like a good deal for the price. No, that is not a good deal. A good deal is when you give me normal person sized portions of a quality meal, and that is where Green Jade shines.

The buffet is very well priced and while the spread is on the smaller side the choices are all very varied and worth the money.

Now for the downside... While the food and service is fantastic when eating in (sit at a table, the booths are really cramped) or carrying out I have to admit that my experience with their delivery has been nothing but disastrous. The delivery driver arrived almost two hours after I had ordered (with the estimated time being an hour) and left quickly before we checked the bags and discovered that it wasn&#39;t even our order. Another forty-five minutes later the driver returned and apologized, handing over the correct order. He then asked for the incorrect one, which at first I didn&#39;t think was all that strange (note: we had already opened the containers to check their contents but hadn&#39;t eaten any of it) but then he started re-stapling and bagging the food in front of us!

The egg foo young was litterally an egg patty with all the vegtables placed on top...the sauce for it was bad. The egg patty was bad. The vegtables were bad. 

The fried rice was tasteless just like there egg rolls. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. I have never had chinese food that i didnt like.

If you call in, your NOT struggling to place an order with someone who hardly speaks English.

The food is always dead on consistent and a rung or two above the competition.

The place is clean and well put together...  One of my litmus tests with Chinese restaurants is the condition of the ceiling tiles: no signs of water damage or discoloration, no missing or mismatched tiles.

I&#39;m addicted to their orange chicken and its my typical order, although I have gone through the bulk of the menu and can&#39;t speak bad about any of the entrees.

I&#39;m by no means suggesting you drive in from the city to check this place, but if you live near by, this should be your first choice for Chinese food.",22/03/11,85,5,1,0,-20,-0.21749999999999997,0.46099999999999997,0.526,5.013,YES,813

Three generations of my family have been coming to Green Jade for a very long time. We know the owners which it is a family run business and even being out of state for 3 years they remember my face welcoming me back with delicious food and a wide smile.  The food has never changed, the service has always been excellent and the food is to die for. This place is comfort food to me. I&#39;ve tried many other Chinese food places and have lived out of state in Michigan and Arizona. Nothing has compared to this Chicago style Chinese which can be relatatable to new york style menu, some items. My favorites are the sesami chicken which is sweet spicey chicken..this is a must have! I haven&#39;t found any place that does it like this. The shrimp lomain is the best here, delicious sauce and right amount of noodles with big shrimp.The shrimp fried rice is great. I always also get the happy family, beef and broccoli,  three deliciously, sweet and sour chicken. These are things I can voche for and are my familys go to food for take out. Each meal comes with white rice even for take out.Must get the egg rolls! They are to die for and sooo big. Yum! Also the dumpling soup is delicious I always get that when I&#39;m feeling under the weather and my brother tells me he lives for their egg drop soup. There take out is fast, the inside dinning is pleasant with booths and space for large parties or families. The buffet is always good with many options to choose from and a heck of a deal! And I almost forgot there fried dough is unbelievably addicting! Amazing desert served with sweet and sour sauce. I skip the sauce and ask for powder sugar. Hot, moist,  freid dough great dessert. I believe I had 8 last time they were so addicting, my brother and I were fighting for the last one! Please go and try it !

green-jade-restaurant-elgin,Diane M.,lTgrXkXtIYg91sfdZS1VOA,N6dd2bKG16IOa8tPXsIkGg,"I had high hopes for this restaurant from reading the reviews and the fact that it&#39;s close to my home.  Well, I have to say I was very unhappy with the whole process and the food.  Firstly, the order was wrong on two entrees.  The other entree was nothing to brag about, either.  The chicken was thin and tough.  I was going to just let it slide and not order from there anymore, but I decided to call and let them know about the wrong order.  The man was nice enough and offered a credit or to make it over again and deliver it to us.  He admitted he hit the &#34;wrong button&#34; when he entered my order, so it was not my fault I got something I didn&#39;t like.  I said a refund would be better, since the food really was not good.  He said he would take care of it.  A week went by and no refund, so I called again and asked for the refund.  He said he would call his bank and take care of it again.  O.K., it&#39;s been over a month or more and still no refund.  I would just take the damn credit at this point, but the food was not good and I don&#39;t want another order of crappy food.  

I really didn&#39;t want to write this review, but I work hard for my money, as everyone does, and certainly did not get my money&#39;s worth this time.

We went in for their lunch buffet, which we&#39;ve done before in the past. Each visit has been a bit more disappointing than the last, and this one took the cake. 

First, when we walked in, the hostess ignored us entirely as she was too busy texting on her phone. We stood there for five minutes until someone who might have been a server or a busboy, couldn&#39;t tell, came out and acknowledged us with a nod. So we assumed we should seat ourselves and sat down.

Eventually, about 5 minutes later, he brought us tea and water. The hostess was still texting. 

The plates up at the buffet were often dirty. We had to sift through bowls and plates to find ones that didn&#39;t have dried food stuck to them. 

The food at the buffet was sparse, and looked old. The fried wontons and eggrolls, what there were of them, were burned. The greenbeans looked positively rancid. The eggdrop soup tasted of nothing but corn and starch. The hot and sour soup was more like Soy Sauce Soup. 

The lo-mein was the best thing available, and wasn&#39;t half bad (the only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1). 

Eventually we went up to pay, and the same server or busboy or whomever he was had to ring us up, as the hostess had taken her phone somewhere else, probably to text in private away from those annoying customers.

The food was very enjoyable.  My wife and I each had the Sante Fe Chicken, which was filled with flavor and a good portion size.  However, the various tequila drinks they have are the most unique trait of this place, outside of the monkey themed decorations.  The margarita I had was strong, but still had flavor to it, and came in a large glass.  It was well worth the price, which was pretty standard for margaritas.

The best part was the extremely friendly staff.  Our server, Rishi, was very friendly and had a personality, joking with us each time he came to make sure everything was going well.

We&#39;ve talked about going since it opened up but for one reason or another never gone.  (We&#39;re not &#39;bar people&#39; and over time the Tipsi Monkey seems to be marketing itself as more of a bar than a restaurant, so that&#39;s part of it.)  But finally this week we went...and are glad we did.  

We went about five o&#39;clock mid-week and found the place nicely designed, clean, and the music at a reasonable level.  We opted to sit in the dining area instead of the bar area, which is nice.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The $5 happy hour margarita surprised us by being HUGE.  We ordered the Tacos for Two which we also found tasty and plentiful.  (So much so that we took home leftovers.  I won&#39;t promise that you will since we each had just two tacos and the are small, but it was plenty for us.)  The rest of the menu was not expansive, but also not small and we saw other items we&#39;d like to try on future visits.  The cost is about what we expected to pay for a sit-down place with table service.

All in all, we were extremely pleased with our experience and plan to add it to our list of regular places.    :-)",27/02/16,139,4,1,5,9,4.1278,2.8729999999999998,0.157,11.969999999999999,No,1249

My boyfriend and I had such a great time. RAj our waiter was so helpful and his suggestions were excellent. I tried the not on the menu margarita with habanero infused simple syrup with muddled cucumber and tangerine. It was by far the best margarita I have ever had. Tangy, a little sweet with freshness from the cucumber and then a slight kick of heat as an afterthought. My boyfriend had the sangria swirl margarita that was tasty as well. 
 We had a flight of tequila shots that Raj picked for us. Great choices! 
 We chose the potato chorizo tacquitos as our app. Unbelievably tasty. Like Mexican comfort food. The fried tortillas were so fresh and crispy and the inside potato was fluffy with some melty chihuahua cheese to add to the goodness. A little more chorizo would have been perfect.
 I had the steak tacos with onion, cilantro, and lime. 4 street taco sized tacos per order. Wonderful two bite treats. Steak was cooked perfectly and those little tortillas were warm with the right amount of chew. Little bouncy fluffy tortillas. 
 My boyfriend had the steak, chicken, and shrimp fajitas which he said were the best he has ever had. I tried his shrimp and it was perfectly cooked and the freshness really stood out.

Came here with a friend for pre-dinner drinks. The space is pretty cozy, with a vibrant decorated atmosphere. We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender despite the crowd.

We later ordered frozen margaritas which were served in huge glasses and not overly fruity, which was perfect.

Upon arriving, I was a little hesitant because the Tipsi Monkey does have a bar atmosphere to it. I was a worried our tots may stick out.

After we were seated, and as the evening progressed, I was pleasantly surprised. They had high chairs and we were seated in the slightly separate section towards the back. Also, the place was loud enough that I didn&#39;t have to worry about the kids bothering anyone. (Phewf!)

The waitress was very friendly and checked on us frequently. The food was delicious. My daughter especially loved the nachos and I loved the spicy salsa.

tipsi-monkey-taco-and-tequila-bar-bartlett,Catherine P.,#NAME?,s1Zpk4TwieouGyJ_IK23mw,"I&#39;m going to break down my stars on this one.

1st star goes to the name. the name itself sounds fun and somewhere I wanted to check out. I have heard about this place and heard both good things and bad, so I was more than happy to try it out for the name alone. 

2nd star goes to our adorable server. She was friendly and totally personable. She had her flaws I will talk about later, but she&#39;s a keeper for sure!

3rd star goes to the chips and salsa. The salsa was fresh and the chips were delicious. It was not very oniony and I&#39;m always a fan of that! Well done, TM!

Fourth star is for the food. It&#39;s excellent. The chicken tortilla soup was amazing. They really know how to cook here!!

We decided to do the taco party. You have a choice of two meats. We chose the chicken and the BBQ pork. The barbecue pork was shredded and had an excellent flavor. The chicken was very well seasoned. I was not crazy about how they served it. Everything came in little cups. Really took up a lot of table space. There was two of us eating and the table was very crowded with all these little cups. I can&#39;t imagine if we were 4 people at the table, there would not have been anywhere for anyone to put their beverage or even two more plates.

5th missing star goes to the staff. Our server was friendly and totally personable. She really was adorable but she needs to learn the menu a little better and we suggested to the owner that he have the staff try all the items on the menu so they know what their talking about. The response of &#34;I cant really tell you because I never had it&#34; doesn&#39;t work for me.

The pricing...they are severely overcharging for what they are serving. I could see paying what they charge in downtown Chicago or even a fancy neighborhood like Barrington, but it doesn&#39;t work in Bartlett and I foresee that being an issue for the owners down the road.",27/10/13,202,4,1,5,-15,7.1149,5.522999999999999,0.683,24.794,No,1905
tipsi-monkey-taco-and-tequila-bar-bartlett,John B.,xgB7Gav_rmc341zv1Hhc1w,M_zSgPD-yuYg7jc4jyv_QA,"This place was hands down some of the best Tacos we have ever had!

Setup:
3ish on a Saturday. 
6 people
Place was almost empty.

Food:
Tri-color chips and salsa- Hot and fresh! Salsa was okay, fresh but nothing special. We also got a hot Salsa that was quite good. 8 out of 10

Quest Fundito- This was a surprise!!! This was Excellent! Caramelized onions with a fantastic sauce! Well worth it! Solid 9

Traditional Steak Tacos- Best flavor for 
a traditional taco I have found. Good sized portion! 10 for what it is.

Chicken Quesadillas- Good 7

Guac- Tasty and fresh 8

Kids meals are the best I have ever gotten!!! Huge plate, with high quality food rather than the sad food kids usually get! Fresh made fries that are super thin and really good! Kids had enchiladas and they ate the plate clean! 10!

Over all I would go back regularly if I lived near by, but I will make the hour trip every now and again! I really want to try the drinks!  

The only gripe I have is that the video poker machines and bar style ads/signs out front do this place a disservice. I almost did not bring the family inside since it looked like a dive bar from the front. Someone spent a lot of time building a great brand and menu, I think they should stick to being the great/high-end place they are and not fall into the crappy bar promo stuff I&#39;m seeing plastered all over the place. The inside of this place looks great too and was well decorated for Halloween. I know the Machines are a good source of revenue but put them in back out of sight.

The TV show bar rescue comes to mind with all the statistics on why to avoid neon and bar/ beer signs. This place is waaay to good for that!

tipsi-monkey-taco-and-tequila-bar-bartlett,Michelle x.,GvvE4lOXBITISBi0h2hTMQ,_JCUEtSPgHUYKlCBpIn43A,"This place was great!  

Our first impression of the motif:  It&#39;s cute, quirky, and quaint with charming, little monkeys stenciled on the walls.  This is a taco and tequila bar.  Interestingly, they did not have Mexican music playing; rather, they were playing something more eclectic, something rhythmic, which was nice to hear something different and unexpected.

Service:  Pleasant, attentive service.  Drinks and orders were timely placed and delivered.  We did not need to ask for anything additional.  Our entrees were served exactly as requested.  Plates were cleaned from the table in an appropriate time frame after eating.

The food:  Wow!  First, we were served with multicolored corn chips and homemade salsa with just the right amount of heat to it.  We couldn&#39;t stop eating the chips and salsa, not because we were hungry, but because it tasted so good!  I think we had three refills of salsa.  

As for our entrees, two of four of us had the carnitas tacos and loved them!  They were recommended and oh, so good!!   The portion size for the tacos is good -- four small tacos with an option of adding beans and rice.  The beans were cooked perfectly.  Most of the time when I get refried beans in a restaurant, they are extraordinarily dry, like they were scraped off the inside of the pan. Yuk!  Not even close to that with the beans at the Tipsi Monkey.  These beans were served just right -- right temperature, right color (not an overcooked brown color), and the right texture (not that &#34;sticky&#34; dried out look).  These were the best beans I&#39;ve had in a very long time.

The third person in our party got the pulled pork tacos and loved those too!  The fourth member of our party ordered a burrito.  Holy smokes!! That thing was huge!  She ate the whole burrito and loved it!!  I don&#39;t even know where she put it all.

Drinks:  We didn&#39;t try any tequila this visit.  We ordered domestic bottles of beer, which were on special for the month. 

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t live in the area or I would definitely go back to the Tipsi Monkey soon.  Next time I am in or around Bartlett, however, I will make an effort to go back to this place though.

The food is good, the portions are decent but not gigantic for most things.  I&#39;m sticking with 3 stars because:
-I think the prices may seem a tiny bit higher than your standard Mexican restaurant
-The menu is definitely limited compared to other Mexican restaurants but what they do have is good (love those fish tacos!)
-The service has just been okay.  Not bad but not as friendly or attentive as I would like.
-The restaurant is tiny.  When they are busy it fills up fast and it&#39;s a bit claustrophobic and very LOUD in there.

We were a party of two toddlers and two sets of parents but they seated us quickly and got us two high chairs.  We were served two big bowls of chips and salsa.  The salsa had a nice flavor too it.  I ate too much chips and salsa for sure.  
This place is more of a tex-mex place.  But that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.  One thing that stood out to me which is kinda iffy is the fact that an order of rice, beans, and cheese costs $4.50.  They are listed on the same line in the menu as $1.50  I think that&#39;s kind of expensive.
I had the fish tacos, which were pretty delicious.  They came with a cole slaw, and some sweet and spicy sauce.  I gobbled them down.  I&#39;ll admit I was kinda missing the cilantro and onion.  But, it was still delicious and they used corn tortillas.

tipsi-monkey-taco-and-tequila-bar-bartlett,Cherl Joy F.,fFYeiPV_d0lbDRdui1SMUQ,YTER4OiCsJ1ZWME7qgUslg,"Pros- comfortable atmosphere, the food is really tasty, fresh and good, the drink menu is varied &amp; yummy.  Both times I was there they had live music and that duo did good oldies &amp; dance tunes that got folks up &amp; dancing which added to the comfort &amp; cozy, they kept the current sports teams games on the large screens - a plus!

Cons- I had heard from a couple people who liked the food &amp; didn&#39;t like the service and wouldn&#39;t come &amp; meet me there.  Unfortunately the service really left a lot to be desired and could not be considered good.  I spent well over a hundred dollars on dinner and drinks and at one point we had to go to the bar to get drinks, the table was piled with dishes from dinner, beer bottles and empty glasses that just sat there on table for over an hour without them being cleared off.   Either they need to train the staff to provide better customer service or hire someone to clear tables.

The great effort by our server to rescue the experience almost gets this up to a two star, but at the end of the day I just can&#39;t justify a rating over 1 based on our food experience.    I won&#39;t pile on with the disappointment on the food but will make one simple recommendation I would make to the chef, when I eat a a shrimp fajita I really don&#39;t want to dig through veggies and sauce to take the hard shells off of the tails of the shrimp.

**I like the streamlined menu (hey, if you do something right, there&#39;s no need to have 18 pages of fluff)
**I also liked the portion sizes
**The salsa was very flavorful but not spicy which is EXACTLY how my white butt likes it (spicy and I are not besties)
**The drink I got (the ape margarita) was REALLY strong.  LOVED it.  Very delicious.  My friend&#39;s strawberry margarita was really good as well!
**The nachos were really yummy--I like when nachos have refried beans on them!
**I ordered the chicken Parrilla, and enjoyed it immensely!


Our waitress was really sweet, attentive, and really kept us happy and well-fed!  

What I didn&#39;t like about the place was how small it was.  You know those restaurants where you see it from the outside, and it is WAY bigger once you get inside?  This is NOT one of those restaurants.  We had a hard time getting in and out of our seats because it&#39;s pretty tightly cramped.

We were greeted by the owner&#39;s daughter and promptly seated with a smile.  She&#39;s a spunky, young woman who had me chuckling a few times over the course of the evening.  Fresh, warm chips hit the table with a nice chunky salsa.  We took care of those pretty quickly and our waitress offered more, but we decided to save room for the main dishes.

The menu is pretty simple.  It was a pleasant surprise to see a streamlined menu.  Do one thing &amp; do it right.  Some appetizers - maybe six or eight of them, some unique entrees that come with rice and beans, many varieties of tacos, a few simple side dishes, drinks and desserts.  My son decided to try the shrimp tacos.  This was a platter of four tacos on blue corn tortillas with breaded shrimp, tasty cole slaw and a sweet and spicy sauce.  He did a good job of clearing his plate.  My husband and I decided to have a &#39;Taco Party&#39;!  We chose two meats - seasoned steak and lightly breaded tilapia (fish).  He opted for flour tortillas &amp; I chose soft corn (red corn) tortillas.  The accompaniments were plentiful!  A mound of guacamole, onions &amp; cilantro, pico de gallo, sour cream, refried beans, the sweet &amp; spicy sauce, a creamy cole slaw and honestly, there were a couple more things that I didn&#39;t use, so I can&#39;t place them right now.  We ate all of the meat and the cole slaw, but didn&#39;t even come close to using up everything else.  

Our waitress was lovely...a real sweetheart.  She kept our glasses full and promptly moved dirty dishes off of the table.  

We also met the owner.  He arrived at the end of the meal, right along with the check.  It turns out that this is definitely not his first rodeo.  With different restaurant concepts in Elgin, Arlington Heights (I think?) and Southern Illinois, he is a seasoned restaurateur.  Soft spoken and maybe even a little shy, our conversation was quick.  But I was glad to meet the man behind our newest Bartlett restaurant.

tipsi-monkey-taco-and-tequila-bar-bartlett,George R.,nGdejkTKHuQryIOIFek02g,KWk78xbRfuhNL2Isy6bvyQ,"I love a good theme. At the Tipsi Monkey, the &#34;monkey&#34; theme or name was everywhere from their drink specials to the accent decorations around the bar. Even their free WiFi password had a monkey word in it (but you&#39;ll have to ask your server for that).

Although the Tipsi Monkey is billed as a Taco &amp; Tequila Bar, I usually rate any place that serves Mexican food by their enchiladas. So on my first visit to the Tipsi Monkey, I ordered their enchilada dinner and a small side of guacamole. The dinner came with the standard beans and Spanish rice.

I wasn&#39;t really impressed with the quality of the enchiladas. The server did tell me the red sauce wasn&#39;t spicy, so I was okay with that. However, the chicken and corn tortillas were quite mushy together; the texture did not meet my expectations. The side of guacamole was okay (nothing special).

I did like their regular Margarita (again with a Monkey name). I&#39;m not a big drinker and I don&#39;t like overly strong drinks. Whereas I typically feel the effects of the tequila after sipping 1/4 of a typical Margarita, this drink was very mellow and either really smooth with a good quality tequila or not much alcohol at all. I finished the whole thing without much of a buzz at all, so I wondered about their mix/alcohol ratio. There was an option to add an extra monkey themed shot of tequila to the Margarita, but I opted out this time not knowing how strong their drinks were. May have to try that next time to make a good comparison.

On my next visit, I&#39;ll probably try their tacos, pass on the enchiladas and go for the upshot in a Margarita or try their Sangria. And I&#39;ll try to save room for this unique banana dessert that was on the menu.",06/01/12,192,3,1,3,9,2.0539,2.1090000000000004,0.749,15.142000000000003,No,1738

I gave 2 stars due to effort- waitress was very kind.  This place was dead on a Saturday night.  I enjoyed the taste of the salsa but if you ate the chips without it- ewww.  They had a nasty fried in oil taste.  My fish tacos were bland, nothing special, I&#39;ve had WAY better.  The sangria- SIGH- I really thought this place would know how to make good sangria but it had the &#34;Hawaiian punch&#34; taste to it.  Go to Cooper&#39;s Hawk if you want a real sangria.  The snow monkey margarita was like a bad White Russian.  Lastly, I tried a margarita on the rocks.  Tasted like toilet water.

However, tonight was terrible, and I definitely will not be back. 
It wasn&#39;t packed, but service was still slow. Our waitress was an unenthusiastic girl, not engaging or friendly. My first drink was alright, not very strong, and my friend and I split the chicken enchiladas. They were so so, nothing special. Then I ordered my second drink. 
My second drink, a Snow Monkey, arrived with a thick black hair in it. It was nauseating to look at, we could not stop gagging. It took forever for us to flag someone down, just wanting it to be taken away. Finally, a male server walks by, and we stop him and inform him of the hair. He says &#34;ooooh....that&#39;s probably my hair....&#34; (Awkward silence) &#34;do you want me to make you another one?&#34;  I decline, and he offered me a shot of tequila, &#34;as there&#39;s definitely no hair in the tequila&#34;.  I decline again and ask for our bill. There was no apology, no disgusted shock...and then he proceeded to bring drinks to the older couple at the next table and talk to them-- &#34;I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re so grossed out about,&#34; loudly talking about us with other customers--very inappropriate. 
After we left, my friend called to speak to the manager and complain. There was apparently no manager on duty, but we did learn that the male server is the owner&#39;s son--I suppose that is why he feels he can treat customers with such disdain. 
The girl on the phone, Jessica, was very sweet, apologized profusely, and offered us free drinks for the next time we come in...yet that&#39;s unnecessary, we will not be back.",12/09/13,201,1,1,0,-39,-0.5049000000000001,1.454,1.8439999999999999,14.704000000000002,No,1759

Our first clue should have been that this very small place had several open tables at 6:30 on a Saturday when there are not many options in Bartlett.  After terrible food/service at the previous concept here, we decided to give this one a try.

All started out great.  The salsa was fantastic, some of the best I&#39;ve had in a while.  Although, I question giving out some pretty spicy (in a good way) salsa and then allowing the server to not return with water or take our drink order for 5-10 minutes.  Our mouths were a bit warm.

With our hopes high, we ordered the tacos for two meal.  We got the grilled steak and the pulled pork with flour tortillas.  We were brought out a nicely displayed assortment of toppings.  We made our first tacos and dug in.  Sadly, we instantly noticed that there was zero flavor to these.  Even the sour creme had no flavor.  The meat seemed clearly processed and not fresh.  The pulled pork is very likely the precooked variety available from Cosco.  I did not sense that anything was prepared with any pride or prepared fresh.  Even the tortillas were not homemade and just a bland generic type.

Service, much like when this place was Italian was slow, without personality, and simply not good enough.  My wife ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt.  She received one with no salt.  Rather than send it back, she kept it as she was very thirsty from the hot salsa.  Her drink was not very good.  Tasted either pre-made or prepared with a store bought margarita mix and tequila.  A bar featuring tequila should at least have enough pride to mix real margaritas.

We noticed &#34;comment cards&#34; stuck in with the check.  My wife suggested this means that ownership knows something is wrong, but either does not believe it or is clueless to it.  The manager did visit our table as we ate and asked us if everything was good.  I told her that the salsa was fantastic but the food was terrible and bland.  She did not seem too shocked by this and I sense she has heard this before.  We also noticed the table next to us scarfed down their chips and salsa, but left most of their dinner untouched.

We&#39;d love nothing more than to find a great local place to eat (We do love the other Mexican restaurant located down the street from here), but until things change here, we won&#39;t be back.  I predict that a for sale sign will be on the front door by years end.

Maybe we should have had the fish tacos. Had the skirt steak tacos. Dry and tasteless. Boyfriend had the chorizo tacos. Yuk O! Spicy Kennel Ration. Refried beans was like eating nothing. Just texture and NO taste. Maybe we are Mexican restaurant spoiled. We did comment to each other that people probably don&#39;t come here for the food.

Great chips and salsa!! 
Salsa is not spicy, but very fresh and flavorful!

We had the taco party for two ... perfect portions for &#34;average&#34; eaters!
If you like bigger portions for one, this is probably a bit on the smaller side for two.

Margartias were delicious!! $6 each - pretty good in my eyes - expecially for the size!

Service was great too!

My ONLY reason for 4 stars is I would have liked to see just a little bit more on the menu - I love some basic favorites that I didn&#39;t see on the menu.

I&#39;ve eaten here a few times and each time it has become progressively worse. Maybe I won&#39;t be an idiot next time and remember not to eat here. The most recent visit consisted of over cooked shrimp and steak. A friend&#39;s dish was prepared with the wrong sides. We asked for a frozen margarita and they made it on the rocks. When asked to make it frozen they said it would be watered down because they would add ice. They didn&#39;t think to remake it.

tipsi-monkey-taco-and-tequila-bar-bartlett,Helen L.,_d9ho9qZrO6D_S8DFWFsqg,2o-s6sjIShWG3aHH0RR3Cg,"We went to Tipsi Monkey for the first time on Friday night.  Let me just say that we are pretty easy to please.  Any time I don&#39;t have to cook is an automatic star from me!

We walked in and it seemed to be pretty busy.  We were told that there would be about a 10-15 minute wait.  We were okay with that - we&#39;ve waited longer than that in other places.  The problem was, the restaurant is small and there was no place to stand to wait for a table.  It looks like there was some type of bench at one point, but there are now gaming machines on top of it so that seating has been taken away.  So if the bar is packed (which it was) there is no place to wait but in front of the door, which isn&#39;t good when other people are coming in behind you.  My suggestion - take out the machines and open the seating back up.

We didn&#39;t have to wait too long for a table.  Once we were seated, the service was awful.  We were seated by the hostess and left to wait for our server.  Our waiter didn&#39;t show up to our table for at least 10 minutes.  By this time, we were ready to order and figured we would order everything at once since we didn&#39;t know when our waiter would be back at our table.  We ordered drinks, an appetizer and our meals.  We thought we may be in trouble since he never wrote our order down.  He came back to our table -TWICE- to ask us again what we ordered for meals.  While we were waiting for our drinks, we noticed that other tables were getting chips and salsa - something we hadn&#39;t gotten yet in the now 20 minutes of sitting there.  Our waiter didn&#39;t seem to be returning to our table so we finally flagged someone down and got our chips and salsa.  They were finally delivered - from the woman busing the tables!  Our drinks came 15 minutes after we ordered them (our waiter told us that the bartender was backed up.  Really?  That far behind?)  Another 20 minutes later, we got our meals - never got our appetizers!  No one came by to ask us how we were doing, did we need anything, how was everything, etc.  Should we have asked for them?  Yes - and we would have if someone would have come to our table to check on us.  We kept seeing the server, but could never get his attention.  We finished our meal and flagged down our waiter and asked for the bill.  He delivered it and quickly took off to another table.  My husband noticed the appetizers were still on the bill.  We had to flag down someone AGAIN and told her we were charged for an appetizer that we never received.  The response was &#34;Oh, we wondered where they went.&#34;  WHAT!  Someone picked up our appetizers!  Maybe if you would have checked on us we could have told you that we didn&#39;t get them.  The woman who fixed the bill (I assume she was the manager) told us that she would buy us an appetizer the next time we come in (which is probably never).

As for the food - if you are looking for a lot of choices in Mexican food, this is not the place for you.  They have a very limited menus.  I had the tacos, which I thought were good.  My husband had the Enchiladas Luis, which is &#34;stuffed with grilled steak&#34; - or so they say.  My husband found only a small piece of steak and the rest was ground beef.

This probably could be a good place to go for drinks and appetizers (if you can get them) but I know that we will not be going back.",01/06/13,346,1,1,1,-44,0.6239999999999997,1.7210000000000003,1.392,40.88699999999999,No,3373

My 3rd and last time here because
1) the Sangria had very little alcohol
 2) despite being seated in the back room where I had hoped for a quieter experience, a table of 8 who were talking exceedingly loud about their teaching experiences (not something to broadcast) The smaller seating up front was even louder so it wouldn&#39;t have helped to move. 
 3) the entree was not edible. I ordered the pork special, described by the waiter as &#34;slow cooked all day long,&#34; I love me some good tender pork, but this was so salty I had to quit after 2 bites.Strangely the rice was also salty! Beans were OK and I even tried putting the pork in the soft tacos that came with it with lettuce, guacamole and tomatoes and bean to tone down the salt but didn&#39;t work. When the waiter noticed I had not eaten it, he asked if I wanted it boxed. I told him I could not eat it because of the salt, and he called the manager. I asked if the manager had tasted this -- he said no, but he knows they add a lot of spices. I said I can taste a little chile powder but the salt is overwhelming. He did take the entree off my bill. 

The one thing I had there my 2nd time  that was good was the chile shrimp appetizer. If you want to go just for drinks and appetizers, although the choices are few, you might be better off. 

The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that the chips and salsa were good, especially the green chile salsa.",07/10/12,166,2,1,3,-15,2.2174,0.9690000000000001,0.591,13.44,No,1567

My wife ordered the enchilladas and that was very good as well. It&#39;s worth checking out. The inside of the place seem cramped.

- You shouldn&#39;t expect your waiter to actually serve the table, because this is a tequila bar and the waiter is drunk, and you should be, too.

- You shouldn&#39;t expect the food to be all that great (worst guac I&#39;ve had in a very long time), because this is a tequila bar and why are you eating and not drinking? 

- You shouldn&#39;t expect to be given the food you ordered, because this is a tequila bar and, Anything We Serve Goes Great With Tequila! (And shame on you for not ordering tequila.)

To the restaurant&#39;s credit, my dinner was comped as soon as I pointed out that it was still incorrect after the third attempt. But had the waiter actually written down the order, or had been slightly more sober, my order might have been done correctly the first time. Aside from the guacamole the rest of the food was okay, and this is the only reason I am bumping up the review to 2 stars. I cannot comment on the drinks as we didn&#39;t have any mixed drinks.

That was only the beginning and was all downhill from there. The Plates were completely dirty. There was NO bus boy. They never filled out glasses with water...when they were clearly empty.

As you might guess, they have a huge selection of whiskey and bourbon.  If you like beers, good selection on tab and bottles.

The drinks are a little too pricey for me. I had the Strawberry Bellini and it was just ok in my opinion. 

The menu items look very delicious! I definitely want to come back to try a salad. 

The macaroni and cheese was very creamy and tasty. I enjoyed the mix of cheeses they  used and the bread crumbs on top. The portion size was generous. 

My mother had the shrimp and grits. She enjoyed the grits quite a bit but for me the bacon in the grits is too overpowering. The bite I had was good but I&#39;d get sick of it fast because of the bacon. If you like bacon you&#39;d find the grits delicious with a great texture. The shrimp was too spicy/salty.

barrel-rye-geneva-2,Yvonne I.,vsRPm_-WdtcY0CWZNz2u1g,QMa-l41lAsQwHTYknxnLyw,"I love downtown Geneva! There are so many awesome restaurants to check out, and Barrel and Rye is one of those awesome restaurants.  My friend and I came on a early Saturday evening, and we enjoyed our experience here.  I don&#39;t believe they accept reservations, so I would imagine there might be a wait for a table if you are coming on the weekend during a prime time.  The place was pretty full by the time we left around 5pm.

This restaurant has many different types of whiskey&#39;s to choose from, but there are also non whiskey cocktails if whiskey isn&#39;t your spirit of choice.  To drink, I had the Smoked Manhattan cocktail, and this cocktail exceeded my expectations.  I&#39;m not sure what makes this Manhattan &#34;smoked&#34;, but there definitely is something in the ingredients or preparation of this Manhattan that makes it stand out from other Manhattan&#39;s.  The taste of the cocktail was slightly more elevated than other Manhattan&#39;s, but also still extremely smooth.  

To eat, I opted for the &#34;Dip&#34; sandwich.  This sandwich has thin slices of marinated lamb, along  with cheese and veggies.  Since this sandwich came with an au jus sauce, it reminded me of a gourmet Italian beef sandwich.  The &#34;Dip&#34; sandwich is a great option if you are looking for a hearty sandwich.",15/09/16,136,5,2,4,28,3.396,1.9740000000000002,0.202,10.824,No,1318
barrel-rye-geneva-2,Kate S.,XBomRKII_TfQbKkL8QH9rQ,ybDSiqxM9bIs2SBvXZqWEA,"I wish so badly I lived closer to Geneva to enjoy barrel + rye more. This place is seriously cool. 

I visited on Tuesday with Jacqueline B. to grab lunch and I immediately loved the space. We described it as &#34;rustic chic&#34;. There&#39;s grey patterned ceilings with light bulb fixtures hanging from them, blue patterns on the walls and modern [fake] mini deer heads scattered throughout. I try not to have the &#34;look&#34; of a place determine my liking of it but barrel + rye sold me immediately. This place truly reminded me of a Wicker Park/Lincoln Park area restaurant. There was a cute outdoor area to sit but because it was about 96 degrees we confidently chose to eat inside. 

We got seated right away at a high table next to the window and took a look at the menu. Of course, I decided on the grilled cheese with a &#34;shot&#34; of tomato soup and a side of fries. Man oh man was it tasty! The sandwich itself was hearty and I had thought after the first half that I may need a box to take home. I&#39;m definitely a fan of grilled cheese dipped in soup so I really liked the concept of a &#34;shot&#34; of tomato soup. Most restaurants give you an entire bowl to finish but even with the size of the grilled cheese, the soup was exactly enough for a dip each bite! The side of fries were exactly how fries should be made. Super tasty, crispy with a soft potato center. Yes please. Jacqueline B. and I were in the area to work so a drink wasn&#39;t our top priority but I would LOVE to come back to take a load off and sip on a sweet concoction. 

Our waitress seemed attentive and nice - nothing too under or overwhelming. You definitely receive a very &#34;chill&#34; vibe here. It was getting a little crowded inside (and from what I saw, outside too) but it seemed like the employees had a good handle on things. Very much appreciated!

Overall, I highly recommend barrel + rye. The food was great, the atmosphere is stress and rush-free and the restaurant itself is just cool to be in. Perfect spot for lunch or a drink in my opinion!",17/06/16,241,5,3,5,52,9.2682,5.928999999999999,0.569,18.503000000000004,No,2058

barrel-rye-geneva-2,Courtney C.,3wDRFdjpeq36Es97Zj2iVw,MTe6Ts7DEZowsjaHB1f5jg,"Since moving to the area, I&#39;ve been looking for a go-to restaurant. A restaurant I go to when I&#39;m celebrating, a place I go when I want to drown my sorrows, or just a place to hang out when there&#39;s nothing else to do. Barrel + Rye is that for me.

I originally discovered B+R thanks to Jacqueline B&#39;s review. The first thing that concerned me upon visiting was parking or lack thereof. Parking in downtown areas usually suck but there&#39;s ample (free) parking nearby on the side streets. The restaurant itself is pretty small, so you&#39;ll most likely have a wait. I recommend coming in and putting your name in line, then heading over to one of the wine bars nearby to relax. 

They have a pretty vast menu and I&#39;ve tried a lot of it. My favorite food from here:
+Appetizers: the BBQ shrimp (seriously, don&#39;t miss these) and the Memphis charcuterie
+Sides: Elotes
+Salad: Fattoush- their homemade hummus is to die for
+Drinks: Cranberry Mule or Bubbles and Bramble
+I haven&#39;t tried any of the sandwiches or burgers, but that will be my next trip!

The servers and bartenders here are all incredibly nice and work hard to make sure you&#39;re happy. My husband knew 0 about whiskey, but one of the bartenders spent a fair amount of time explaining the different kinds to him until he decided on something he might like.

As a lover of bourbon I had wanted to try this place for a bit.  My husband and I finally made the decision to make it out and it was worth the wait! We showed up super early (5pm) and there was already a possible 1 hour and 15 minute wait!!!! Usually this would make us turn around and find another option... This time we stuck it out and thank goodness we did! We started with the Memphis plate.  The char on the pork sausage, coupled with the cheese and giardiniera was perfection, not to mention the delicious BBQ sauce! 
My husband chose the Southern sandwich which was fried chicken, fried egg, maple syrup, bacon and cheese (aka heart attack) and said it was terrific. He was so imposed with the giardiniera from the app that he orders a side for the sandwich. I ate a crusty from the fried chicken and was very impressed with the spice and savory flavoring.    
I chose the belly burger (grass fed beef patty, house cured pork belly, sauteed onions, havarti cheese, pretzel bun) which was honestly one of the BEST burgers I have ever eaten.  No flavor over powered the other and it was awesome! I forced myself to take half home but it was difficult!
As sides we ordered fries and Mac n cheese.  Both items were well beyond average closer to the heavenly category!
I order the old fashion and my husband ordered garrison brothers neat. The old fashioned was well rounded and balanced.  There was no bite that is often found in an poorly made old fashioned.

I will most definitely be back here.  Just keep in mind it&#39;s worth the wait so plan on putting your name in early then walking around for a bit.",30/04/16,208,5,2,5,17,7.714300000000001,4.455,0.8779999999999999,15.667,No,1725

We came later in the afternoon on a Saturday, and they had a 40 minute wait. We were 2 seconds away from leaving when the host told us there were a few seats at the bar with no wait. Done.

The seats at the end of the bars are not ideal (you are in the way of kitchen and waiter/waitress traffic, by the door with cold air blowing in, etc.). However, it was better than waiting 40 minutes. The place is not huge (hence the 40 minute wait). But I feel like the atmosphere, drink selection, and food make up for it. 

I love Edison lights, and they have them here. It&#39;s a nice, but casual place. The drink menu is great. If you like whisky you will love this place. They have quite the variety! We didn&#39;t drink, but I have heard through the grapevine that their cocktails are quite good.

Their menu has a nice variety. Their food is upscale bar food. We ended up getting salads (my sister got the beet/goat cheese and I ordered the salmon salad). Both were very good! Good portion for the price, salmon was perfect, the added ingredients portion to the greens was perfect. A nice light, but filling meal.

And on the back page of the menu - there it was! A venison burger for a reasonable price.

Then I found the hummus on the front page, and I wanted just then to move to Geneva.

The hummus arrived on a very large tray with excellent warm pita, veggies, and two different types I had not yet tried - a salsa fusion and a pine-nut fusion. YUM!

The burger arrived perfectly cooked medium rare, and I didn&#39;t even have room for the fries, though the few I had were also quite yummy.

Dinner at Barrel &amp; Rye was fantastic.  Our table shared the Brie Cheese Curds and the BBQ Shrimp.  If you&#39;re a fan of brie, cheese, or curds, get those.  I could have eaten the entire appetizer by myself.  The creamy brie is a delicious twist on &#34;normal&#34; cheese curds.

Cocktails are done well also.  I had the Cranberry Mule.  Although I would have preferred a plain Moscow Mule, it was a festive adaptation of the classic drink.

The atmosphere is dark and classy.  Tables are scrunched close together, which I&#39;m not a fan of, so it was loud too but I didn&#39;t struggle to have a conversation.

The food is excellent; it&#39;s creative yet not intimidating, and most importantly it is scrumptious!!! Here&#39;s what we had...
Shrimp App-simple and great. A tad greasy, but the napkins are substantial so that was no problem. 
I ordered the Salmon salad, it is the absolute BEST salad I have ever had. Greens, pears, candied walnuts, cheese and the most amazing dressing and a perfect salmon filet. 
My husband ordered the dry rub BBQ wings as his meal. They were great, although he will try the spicy BBQ next time. The most amazing part was the bleu cheese dipping sauce. The greatest dip, not too strong. 
We shared the brussel sprouts and fries. Embarrassing admission here...these were my first brussel sprouts ever, and I will be getting them again. The fries are almost breaded and then fried. Really tasty. 
It will be hard for me to try something new after that salad, but I bet there are so many other delicious things on the menu.

I was immediately impressed with the decor and feel of this place. I love the rustic look. So much so that I literally want to copy their bathrooms and light fixtures in my own house!

When we came in for lunch the place was pretty packed. There were a lot of larger groups of lunching women on this particular Tuesday. We opted for a seat up at the bar. They have a great list of whiskey cocktails, other fun drinks and a small craft beer list. I had their Simon + Garfunkel, which includes Tito&#39;s vodka, parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, cranberry juice and strawberries. This cocktail was super refreshing and made me feel sophisticated and fancy.

As for food we decided to split a couple things. Our choices went as followed...

Memphis Sausage &amp; Charcuterie: Thuringer sausage, smoked Gouda, bourbon BBQ sauce, sweet and spicy BBQ seasoning, homemade giardiniera. This board of deliciousness is absolutely amazing! I highly suggest it. My husband and I are still dreaming of that sausage. We even tried to recreate this app at home (not even close to as good ad this B+R winner).

B+R Salad with Grilled Shrimp: roasted red pepper, grilled corn, feta cheese, avocado, tortilla strips, bed of mixed greens with a citrus vinaigrette (we added in grilled shrimp). Delicious, light and refreshing. Simple as that.

This last time we came to B+R was at about 7:45 on a Sunday night. Definitely not as busy, but there were a handful of people up at the bar since the Hawks were playing. We sat up at the bar as well - it&#39;s kind of our thing. We enjoy chatting it up with the bartenders.

I ordered the B+R old fashioned (buffalo trace bourbon, simple syrup, angostura bitter&#39;s, regan&#39;s orange bitter&#39;s) to drink and my husband ordered the Ward Eight (george dickel rye, fresh orange juice, fresh lemon juice, pom grenadine). When our drinks were served we both had to laugh. Of course being an old fashioned, my drink looked pretty hard core - dark whiskey with an iceburge cube to top it off. The Ward Eight on the other hand, was a bright pink cocktail. My hubbie wanted to switch drinks, but I let him stick that one out haha. I tried his drink though and let me tell you, it&#39;s a great cocktail - highly suggest it! I really should have switched him.

For dinner we both got burgers. I had the Brie Burger (grass fed burger, creamy brie, grilled pears, caramelized onions - $14) with a side of brussel sprouts (extra $2). My burger was huge and absolutely amazing. The brie, pears and caramelized onions formed a perfect sweet sensation that paired nicely with the burger. I&#39;m really happy I got the brussel sprouts as well, because they were delish! I ended up taking home half a burger and a tad bit of veggies and let me tell you, they were just as good the second time around when I heated up the leftovers!

The servers at B+R are pretty awesome. Super nice and laid back. I really enjoy the atmosphere here, the quality of their food and the drinks are top notch. Win-win-win.",04/05/15,409,5,3,5,94,16.348499999999998,9.189,0.055,32.756,No,3165
barrel-rye-geneva-2,Leslie S.,rbQp0U49dlq-IcC9d3uBdw,dhwEI_A2yZRsOJXv1RliFw,"After hearing so many friends and neighbors rave about this place, I could not wait to try it! My husband and I went there the last week in April for drinks and dinner. 

As I do not really drink whiskey, bourbon, or beer, that put me on the cocktail menu. I ordered the Simon + Garfunkel, and the Bubbles + Bramble. Those were some of the strongest drinks I have had since college! In fact, the second drink was so strong I had to send it back to be remade. I am 30-something years old now, and when I go out for dinner with my husband, I&#39;m not looking to get smashed off my face. Even the remade drink was still much stronger than I would normally order. I did not feel like the bartender knew anything about alcohol service. When we asked him some questions about a local beer, he told us he honestly did not know. That seemed to be his answer for most things. 

(By the way, my husband&#39;s drink, the Cucumber Punch, was honestly served with half as much liquid as mine, though it was just about the same punch. I think he was done drinking it in three sips.)

Moving on to the food, I have to say it was some of the worst I have had in a long time. What a huge disappointment! I begged my husband to start with the poutine, which came highly recommended. It was interesting. First of all, it was nearly a trough-full of poutine. it would certainly be enough for eight people, let alone two! The gravy was lacking flavor, and the duck was tough and chewy. I actually asked my husband at one point, do you think this is real duck? We have had some amazing poutine in other restaurants and abroad, and this was not. 

I decided to play it safe afterwards with a turkey burger and mac and cheese. At first, I liked the mac and cheese, but it was served lukewarm, and within minutes, it was cold. I continued to eat it, but as time went on, I realized that I was so desperate to find something to like at this restaurant that I was giving more props to the mac and cheese than it deserved. 

The turkey burger was incredibly average. The meat itself needed more seasoning, with perhaps some red peppers and onions mixed into the meat as well. 

Overall, I would definitely not return for the food, or the drinks, which means I probably will not be returning! What a shame, as I was really looking forward to a new and unique venue in Geneva.",09/05/15,269,1,2,5,14,4.5527,3.4090000000000003,1.434,24.157,No,2347

The tap beers were delicious - I had a red and my husband had an IPA.  We chose to share the house plate (meats, cheeses, crackers, jam, pickles), cauliflower, and elote (Mexican corn).  The food was simple and absolutely delicious.  If I made cauliflower like that at home, the kids would gobble it up!  The only disappointment was the cheese on the house plate...it really tasted like nothing compared to everything else.

barrel-rye-geneva-2,Rosanna P.,SovnbVXddUEdziqeLMuUCg,BONjCMmJNqeipH-WrjSCcw,"For a suburban eclectic place, I think Barrel &amp; Rye is a solid 5 out of 5. I was hesitant before we went there that our wait was going to be forever.. I read a lot of the reviews and many people were commenting on the long wait since they don&#39;t take reservations. When we got there at 6:30pm on a Friday night they were packed. Not one open table. The hostess said it was going to be an hour, so we went next door for a drink. 20 minutes later we weren&#39;t even done with our cocktails and they had already called us letting us know our table was ready. It was a beautiful night and we were able to sit outside!! 

We tried all the staples. The curds, shrimp and grits, Memphis board, and duck poutine. All were out of this world. I would recommend trying them all. The curds and poutine were my absolute favorites. After we indulged in small plates, we all got entrees. I had the venison burger and it was stellar. Super tasty, juicy, and packed with flavor. The cranberry BBQ sauce on the burger is delightful. I opted for the brussel sprouts instead of the fries and they were well worth it. We also got a side of the Mac and cheese with bacon and it was great as well. 

All in all, everything we tried was packed with flavor and the wait was not an issue. I&#39;ll definitely be back soon!",04/06/16,147,5,1,5,-4,4.5466,2.788,0.043,16.169,No,1304

My wife and I enjoy eating at the bar in any restaurant that has one  ...  we arrived right on time as a couple walked out. Waited 10min before we were acknowledged as customers, as bartenders walked back and forth talking with customers (there were 3). 

This place is relatively small ... the food was good (we split several items, 5 pepper wings, chili, and chicken sandwich) and drinks were ok (my beer was on the warm side right out the tap - I like my beer cold). My wife always drinks vodka water w/lemon.

Overall, honestly, it was ok, not sure of the validity on previous reviews. Im not knocking this place, just thought it was ok. A month back, My wife and I ate at Wildwood (next door), we&#39;d likely chose the latter over the former. 

We&#39;ll pay extra for quality.

barrel-rye-geneva-2,Dan S.,81fr37MM4GR62S2yvOt3gA,dic9n2ggZvBdf1LI4eNX0w,"Went here for our dating anniversary since we&#39;ve been wanting to go here for a long time.  Had read a lot of reviews saying &#39;go early or expect a long wait&#39;.  We arrived about 5:15 on a Tuesday night &amp; were seated immediately.    The place is dark, fairly intimate and tiny.  Maybe 8 tables inside, 6 or so outside but about 15-20 chairs along the bar.  

The drink menu &amp; food menu are about the same:  4-5 pages and everything looks awesome.  Kelly had the strawberry bellini and LOVED it.  I had a beer since all of the drinks looked really good but I was in a beer kind of mood.  Trying to pace ourselves for the night, we wanted to order nearly all the appetizers but settled on the fried brie curds.  They were AWESOME!  OMG!  I could&#39;ve eaten just those all night &amp; been fine.  The apricot pepper jam was very good with it as well.  Word to the wise:  it is a bit spicy/peppery, but not overwhelmingly so.  Just enough to say &#34;hello vicker&#34; and linger on the palate a while.   

For dinner, Kelly ordered the venison burger with alote&#39; and I ordered the brie burger with brussel sprouts with bacon jam.  Both burgers came out quickly and were very good.  I would&#39;ve liked a lot more pear &amp; brie in my burger though.   The brussel sprouts were very good too, with the best ones at the bottom of the dish.  The venison burger was outstanding.  Stuffed with bacon &amp; blue cheese with a really nice cranberry BBQ sauce.  We shared the burgers &amp; the venison burger was the far better burger.  As we ate, the lady at the table next to us ordered a brie burger as well and she got a TON of brie, so I felt a bit cheated.  I&#39;m not a big alote&#39; fan (kind of a purist when it comes to corn) but Kelly said it was outstanding. 

For dessert, they have house made pies available but you never know what they are until you get there.  We ordered the chocolate chess pie.  We thought it&#39;d be a slice of pie, but NOPE.  Pleasantly surprised to see a small 6&#34; pie come out, with a big dollop of vanilla ice cream  &amp; caramel drizzle.  The chocolate custard in the middle, to me, was very good &amp; tasted a lot like  a fried Oreo.  The ice cream was great as was the caramel drizzle.  The crust on the pie though was a bit too thick &amp; doughy for our liking. 

Service on the night from our waitress, Jordan, was outstanding.  She was always checking on us, getting refills, making suggestions since we were newbies, etc.  

All in all, some minor dings on my burger &amp; the pie, but we enjoyed our first experience here a great deal &amp; look forward to coming back!",15/06/16,309,4,2,5,23,11.067499999999997,6.093,0.182,27.725,No,2639

barrel-rye-geneva-2,Ken C.,EZ43EaX5rtqw2OudweTeuw,295UTgQda-mfzsipHCwnrw,"I&#39;d have to say my first experience here was somewhat underwhelming and three stars is maybe even generous. There was about an hour wait for a table which was not an issue since we planned to have a drink before dinner anyway. We sat on sofas in the bar area which was nice, but the sun blasting in through the window made conversation difficult. The blinds could not be closed because of interference from a half-height wall, which could easily be rectified by trimming the blinds! Beer selection was a bit limited with no descriptions offered for the drafts with crazy names having nothing to do with the type of beer. I asked for a Belgium style beer, something a bit on the fruity side. Our waitress made an immediate recommendation making me think she knew what she was talking about, but what I got was an extremely bitter IPA (I do not like IPA&#39;s). We did get our table after an hour so the wait was fine. The burger was tasty but lacking in the amount of (blue) cheese, and it was really greasy, but still tasty. I ordered a cocktail when dinner was delivered and it didn&#39;t arrive until after we were finished. By then I really didn&#39;t want it any more. A bit on the pricey side also for burgers and appetizers and this is not really a place to go for a healthy meal! 

Overall, the place has a nice atmosphere and their &#34;3rd Street&#34; is a nice bourbon cocktail, but just not a place that I&#39;m anxious to return to.",11/04/16,149,3,1,0,-44,-0.25839999999999985,0.757,0.8350000000000001,11.408000000000001,No,1448

Not to mention it&#39;s also located in downtown Geneva, which is a treasure! For seriously, how did I live in the western burbs without ever visiting this gem of a town? 

In reality, however, this place is just okay. It might be good for drinks or apps, but I think the food overall leaves much to be desired. I went here on my bday (woop woop!) with my boo. We sat at the bar because we are cool dudes with attitudes. The bartenders were friendly and suggested some beer for us to try. We drank the beer and we loved the beer. We ordered the bone marrow appetizer, the Southern, and the Flank sandwich. Let&#39;s break it down:

Bone marrow: Where&#39;s the beef (marrow)? I&#39;ve had bone marrow before, and I&#39;m used to having marrow in the bones. Does this make me a diva? The bones were filled with roasted garlic and onions (I think) which tasted good but was not marrow. 

The Southern: This was the best sandwich of the night, but it was just okay. The syrup threw my boo off. I liked it because it reminded me of bacon without actually having bacon.

The Flank: The meat was good, but it was drowned in chimichurri. And the chimichurri was drowned in parsley. So it was basically like eating a parsley sandwich. Blegh. I like parsley, but I don&#39;t like parsley sandwiches. 

Elotes: We got the elotes as a side dish to one of our sandwiches. I friggin love real elotes: mayo, cheese, pepper, what is not to love??? This was not so good. We barely touched it, it was sweet and off-putting. 

We got fries too. The fries were pretty okay.",08/09/15,217,3,1,5,9,5.4678,4.381,1.369,23.250000000000004,No,1728

Seriously. My husband and I arrived at 7:30 pm on a Friday night and big surprise, they had no tables open. We managed to find 2 seats at the bar and sat down. The pros to sitting at the bar is that your water is refilled pronto since the bartender is right there. We both ordered drinks; a &#34;bubbles &amp; bramble&#34; cocktail for me, and a blood orange margarita for him. The bubbles &amp; bramble can be made with vodka or gin and to be honest, I don&#39;t remember what else is in it. It&#39;s a champagne type cocktail though and pink. I really liked it. It was $10, but strong. Half-way through I was definitely feeling it. My husband enjoyed his margarita, but I honestly couldn&#39;t taste the blood orange at all. Only downside to this restaurant, they didn&#39;t have any mint so they couldn&#39;t make me a mojito. Very easy addition, so I hope they add that on.

Our food....AMAZING. He ordered the rye grilled cheese and I ordered the Southern. The rye grilled cheese was great. The Southern is something that I will probably dream about. From the time I started eating the sandwich to when I finished, anything could have happened. Zombies could have ravaged the restaurant behind me and I probably wouldn&#39;t have noticed (aside from having a chunk bit out of my arm, most likely). I seriously don&#39;t know how long it took me to finish because I feel like time stood still. Ok..maybe it was the effects of my bubble &amp; bramble, but I was just mesmerized by the sandwich. Southern fried chicken with cheese (don&#39;t remember what kind), a fried egg, and maple syrup on a grilled bun. So simple yet so delicious.

My sandwich came with fries, but I opted for the soup instead: corn &amp; bacon chowder.  It was decadent and I&#39;m pretty sure I raved about it for like 5 minutes later. I think my exact words were &#34;I wish they served this chowder in XL bowls&#34;. Yeah, I was in love. Whatevs. The fries my husband had with his grilled cheese were fantastic. I&#39;m not sure what they did to make it taste that way but there must be some sort of coating on it prior to frying.

Only things I would change: more seating (though it&#39;s a small bar, so that&#39;s impossible), lower prices on drinks ($10 is a little pricey for what you get), and mint for mojitos. And 64 oz corn chowder bowls. Or maybe it&#39;s better that they don&#39;t have those.",21/02/15,273,5,1,5,-18,8.2149,7.191,1.458,26.348999999999997,No,2398

It was too warm for me to sample the extensive whiskey menu. But that just means I need to return.

It doesn&#39;t get a whole lot better than this. Well, unless you go down the street to Burger local which is owned by the same people.

We had a run to Carol Stream to do some after Christmas shopping the Sunday after Christmas. We couldn&#39;t find much around there that was appealing, and decided to come back to Geneva since we have had lock the last several restaurants we went to here, we were not disappointed.

We had tried burger local the day before, and we knew the same owner on this one, so decided to give it a shot.

We were greeted at the door as we walked in, and seated immediately. The host was very friendly. As we came to find out, this was going to be the same with all the staff we met. Our server was at our table within five minutes to take our drink order and our drinks arrived at the table shortly thereafter.

My wife had a standard burger with fries and I decided to try the pork belly. My wife always orders well done ( wife or life of me I can&#39;t figure out) and I medium rare.  Both were prepared to perfection. While we both got fries with ours, I decided I really wanted to try the Brussels sprouts with bacon jam, one of my favorite vegetables.

 the sprouts were on believable. They should be served as an appetizer, there is enough to be as such. They stand very well on their own.

The beer selection look excellent, however we can&#39;t speak to it since right now I&#39;m on some medication that prevents me from trying it. Trust me, I&#39;ll be back.

We arrived around 5:15 and immediately put our name and phone number on their  list.  The wait at that time was estimated to be a very Bien Truca-ish 1-1/2 hours, so we popped next door to the very excellent bar at Wildwood for some drinks and conversation.

We got called right on time and we&#39;re very glad we caught up at the bar because as soon as we walked into B+R, we were met with a huge wall of sound that made it hard to converse for the rest of our meal and very hard to hear our wait person as she described the menu items.

There were some miscues on the service side that had us waiting for both drinks and apps.  The craft cocktails were rather short pours for the price, but I had an excellent Sazerac that was nicely chilled without being on the rocks.  The charcuterie and hummus apps were pretty good, but I had to remind our server about my roasted red pepper soup which was delivered at the same time as our mains.  It had probably been sitting somewhere ready to deliver as it came out unable-to-eat hot as if it had been popped into the microwave.  Nice roasted pepper flavor though.

Missteps aside, both food and drinks were good and given thumbs up by all, though the food was rather too salty for my taste.

Part of a table for 2, it took a bit to get our order taken at the bar and the table reserving process was confusing, but now we know.  The food, service, and the bourbon-based cocktails were all excellent.

Shared the Memphis Sausage plate, which was a good mild yet flavorful sausage smothered in a tangy barbeque sauce, sliced gouda, and a mild gardinera that was made on site.   It didn&#39;t come with crackers or bread-our serve asked if we wanted anything like that but we were good with just our hands and forks.

We also had 8 wings-4 were creole flavored which were great and 4 were 5 pepper which were just o.k.   The wings themselves were a bit dry but they were well cooked (naked wings) and large.  The blue cheese dressing that came with was pretty great and there was a lot of it.

We also split a Black &amp; Bleu burger-cooked a good medium, exactly as ordered and fries were good (even better with the gravy we ordered on top!).

Drink-wise, I had the American Mule (bourbon, ginger beer and lime served over ice in a copper mug).  Talk about refreshing yet just strong enough to remember it&#39;s main ingredient is bourbon!  They have decent tap options as well, but they were out of the 1st two I ordered (1 was out, the other flat per our server, which I appreciated knowing).

Speaking of the server, Diana, she was the type that you&#39;d ask for on your next trip.  Very friendly and attentive, but not the least bit overbearing.

Unfortunately Barrel &amp; Rye needs to up their game in the food and cocktail department if they want to be in the same league as Sovereign in Plainfield. This was my 2nd visit the first visit being a lunch time burger and fries (the burger was just okay not great). 
Seating is minimal with the majority of the place really setup to dine at the bar which I really dont mind. On a weekend night the place is packed and loud e.g. 1.5 hour wait for a table with nowhere to wait.  Decor is tasteful and comfortable and the dress code is casual. Excellent large HD TV setups as well you can pretty much see well from anywhere in the place. Staff was also professional, quick and courteous.  Beer list was good but the bottle/can list could be larger. Whiskey/Bourbon selection is exceptional and this would definitely be my go to Whiskey bar in the area. That being said the cocktails are definitely lacking. Of the four cocktails I&#39;ve tried only one was really impressive (Sour Earl). With all that whiskey they need some more interesting whiskey cocktail options like Black Manhattan, Paper Plane, Paris Manhattan etc. a standard Old Fashioned and Manhattan should be on the menu as regular items not highlighted like special drinks. The food was equally mediocre considering how interesting the items were the execution did not live up to the description. For example if you&#39;re going to have duck poutine on the menu use duck fat gravy not your regular house gravy it does make a difference.

barrel-rye-geneva-2,Ashley S.,X4O9o2A9WNaJM1mPd-2Aag,Ry14iLO9km66W-UB5c_nGw,"3.5 stars!!! made a trip out west tonight to get out of the city and visit one of my favorite little towns of Geneva IL. Lots of quaint charm. My best boys picked out this place Barrel + Rye because they know my love of upscale takes on gastro american food and basically the entire menu had our mouths watering. 

We scoured the cocktail menu and let me tell you, it looked good. real good. I settled on a fall themed rum drink that was going to have a burst of citrus freshness, my friend had to settle on an old fashioned (because the place was out of vermouth? please notice this and plan accordingly because you are a whiskey establishment and your server spent precious moments selling us on the amazing sounding cedar manhattan. so sad to have missed that) and my other friend chose a nice crisp fall cider. My drink was about as lack luster as finding some apple juice in the back of the fridge in college and saying what the heck and dumping a bunch of rum into it. Sure I drank it to catch a buzz, but in no way did I enjoy it. The old fashioned was a little sweet, but that comes with the territory and when my friend ordered a second and asked for a little less simple syrup it was absolutely delicious. I ordered their whiskey milk drink for my second round and with bits of cookie it seriously tasted like a boozy rendition of your morning milk after you finished your cinnamon toast crunch ( and I very much enjoyed this). Enough about booze, on to the food. 

The service - The girl was sweet and helpful and I really can&#39;t say anything bad here. 

So.... we were not conservative AT ALL and for the three of us we ordered the duck poutine, wings, bone marrow, a 16 dollar venison burger with what sounded like perfect toppings, a korean bbq sandwich, elotes and brussel sprouts as sides, and pumpkin pie for dessert. 

Duck Poutine - This was delicious. first off it was huge. And the curds and gravy had great flavor. There was a ton of salty well cooked duck, and although I did absolutely drown the entire thing in ketchup it was just because I was enjoying it a lot, a great sharable plate. A+ 

The bone marrow - presented her differently with a TON of roasted garlic on top. I don&#39;t have a boyfriend to kiss so I am not complaining. I enjoyed the bread here and would only say to put about 4 times as much fennel on the plate because it was such a welcome addition and I ate most of it on my one bite before my friends even had a chance. B

The wings - I don&#39;t do wings but the boys seemed to enjoy these dry rubbed wings and I didn&#39;t mind the fact that there was now basically a bottle of blue cheese at the table that I could dip my french fries in because I have absolutely no shame. N/A

The brussel sprouts - the first few bites showed promise and everyone at the table was giving their yums of approval. But a couple sprouts in and the color disappeared and you could tell that these sprouts really needed some more love and time to cook. A worthy effort on the flavor profile, but make sure that side is perfect. C- 

Elotes - my friends and I discovered elotes this year and I am seriously in love. spicy corn covered in cheese and mayo? I can&#39;t even. This one was off the cob and bursting with flavor. My friend was commenting that he detected mint on the dish and I wasn&#39;t sure if he was upset or interested, but if it was the first pass it my way, I was happy to finish it. A+

Korean BBQ - Riding the fence here. This sandwich was ruined by a thick thick bun. I only eat the bottom and I still found it too breadie. Also we noticed on the menu this weird obsession with the bread... categories like &#34;between the bun&#34; &#34;between bread&#34; just seemed a little overkill to us. focus on the flavors, not the brown slab you put it on. The meat was cooked nicely and I would have liked more of that pear slaw to brighten up the dish, it provided a nice freshness. B

and then.... oh the Venison burger. We were discussing how we should order the burger because I would prefer if they bring the animal straight to the table. Barbaric I know, but I love my meat as raw as possible. Then the waitress said &#34;chef recommends medium to medium rare.&#34; Perfect! this was going to be delicious. Well what showed up was a burger so overcooked the bun had completely taken over and the flavor of the cheese and onion was lost because no juiciness remained on this sandwich. And how can you fix an overcooked burger when the kitchen is already closed? If you say you are going to do something chef, DO IT! What a huge disappointment, especially for the price. F 

Pumpkin pie - out comes an entire mini pie COVERED in ice cream. The boys felt it lacked that strong spice but I really enjoyed how simple it was and the buttermilk made it so decadent, even though it wasn&#39;t a thick custard like you normally see from pumpkin pie. If it is the only one I have this season, I will be fine with that. B

All and all pretty good and mostly enjoyable. Until next time Geneva :)",25/09/15,557,3,3,5,82,18.562900000000003,11.906,2.023,39.07300000000001,No,5034

Being fans of tapas (and no, this isn&#39;t a tapas place), we decided to stick with a multitude of appetizers.  The standard cheese/meat board had a very nice variety to choose from.  The roasted brussel sprouts with bacon were awesome, but were missing that char/crispness that would have taken then to another level.  On a whim, I got the chicharon and it was absolutely delicious.  Crispy with a good dusting of spices, paired with an equally spicy sauce....could sit at the bar with a bar and a basket of those for the day!  To bring the caloric level down a bit, we added just their basic salad which kept pace with the other food.

Beer selection is pretty good, and the house drinks are on point .  My wife had the Moscow mule, while I had the old fashioned.  Both made well with a good balance of their respective ingredients.

The atmosphere is pretty cozy, given the abundance of Edison lightbulbs (adds a great deal of &#34;warmth&#34; to the place).

barrel-rye-geneva-2,Catherine B.,s897U7Lv7a244jqwhr0Zgg,OHKSvi1grD0ZEni2xGfGjQ,"I&#39;d give 3.5 stars if I could. Got there around 8 pm on a Sunday night without reservations and was told it would be a 25 minute wait. As we were walking around nearby discussing other options, they called to say our table was ready making our wait about 5 minutes instead of 25. 

We were seated at a high top table near the bar, and it was incredibly loud due to the music and bar patrons. Like loud enough that it was difficult to hear across the table and everything was punctuated with a &#34;what did you say?&#34; The interior is nicely decorated though. 

We had wanted to try this restaurant mainly because the Brie cheese curds sounded so delicious and almost immediately we were told they were out for the night, so that was actually a pretty big bummer. The waitress recommended some other appetizers but as a vegetarian, I was pretty limited in what I could eat so we declined. 

For drinks, we had the strawberry cucumber mojito and the Manhattan. Both were good. The mojito could&#39;ve been a little stronger, but the cherries used in the Manhattan were of higher quality than the nasty bright red ones you get at the grocery store so that was a nice touch. 

For entrees, we had the falafel sandwich (me) and the flank steak sandwich (boyfriend). We both got fries as our side. The fries were nicely seasoned but not the best I&#39;ve ever had. The sandwiches were good but I felt like the falafel had a little too much of a kick to it from the chipotle sauce it was served with - I&#39;m not being wimpy about the spice level, but it tasted a little one dimensional like it was just pure heat without flavor. To tamper it down, I stuck some of my fries into the sandwich which worked out well to round it out. 

So, all in all it was fine but not exceptional by any means.",08/09/15,188,3,1,4,-1,3.6560999999999995,2.302,0.739,12.958,No,1794

Wait staff recommended favs and I didn&#39;t choose anything among them--instead I chose the chicken sharwarma. It was so full of fat that the meat was inedible. Told the waiter, who took my opinion back to the kitchen; she came back and told me that said dish is made from the thigh so *shrug*..that&#39;s that. Flavor was good though so I ate the veggies and pita that came with it. Portion was way small if you&#39;re comparing it to any other middle-eastern restaurant that serves the same dish.

The atmosphere isn&#39;t bad for a pub. It&#39;s a very very small place with only a few tables, and it can be pretty loud when it&#39;s full. Strange given that the place is so small.
But onto the food. I tried The Local with smoked Gouda cheese--the 100% grass fed burger, and it was nothing special. The near didn&#39;t have much flavor at all, and the cheese was a joke. It was one slice, and so thin that you could see the burger through the cheese! What kind of cheeseburger is that?!  The fries were cold.

We were definitely glad we went for a 5:30 pm dinner time as it continued to get busier as the night progressed. 

We started out with drinks- bourbon for our friend, an old fashioned for my husband, and a delicious champagne cocktail. We enjoyed the cheese curds as an appetizer- delicious.

When I called I went through 3 people, no one knew what to do. So finally, the manager offered me a small rice if I came and picked it up? Small rice? I had 2 large order don&#39;t you think you should have the decency to give me at least 1 large order of rice? Anyways, I tried to explain to them that my soup was also a small.

hunan-beijing-hoffman-estates,Marie D.,jJj_S3AiFQAi26JN4tI0lQ,DRLX1Qe1cBiDZ3_qK8iBUg,This is a gem of a place! I base my Chinese restaurants on their fried rice and egg rolls. First of all the fried rice was one of the best I ever had it was not soggy like some of the others in other restaurants their was an abundant amount of chicken which was cooked just right not dry but tender and juicy the bean sprouts were crisp and the soy sauce content was enough to enhance the fried rice. Egg rolls were light and crisp and delicious.,20/05/15,46,5,2,1,15,0.8324,0.38799999999999996,0.025,3.5869999999999997,No,446

Normally, I check a place out before hitting submit.  This time I gambled and ordered before reading the reviews.  Not going to lie...I was nervous after reading so many negative reviews.  

Well.  I can just say my experience was wonderful.  They were super speedy!  It was under 30 minutes from the time I ordered to when I was eating.  And the food.  WOW.  First off - it&#39;s not jarred sauce.  Or, if it is, they jazz it up enough that you can&#39;t tell.  I had orange chicken (medium spiciness) and it had a delightful spicy tingle.  Plus you could tell it was actual pieces of chicken and not the frozen, prebreaded nuggets you get so often.  My friend got the cashew chicken and kept going on about how good it was.  And it did look quite tasty!

The only reason they got dinged is because the fried rice was a little bland.  Not a huge crisis - we just ended up adding soy sauce.

All in all - a place I will definitely order from again!",12/05/15,112,4,1,4,3,3.4373,4.078,0.526,14.395999999999999,No,1040

It was our first time trying Hunan Beijing and the lady on the phone was very thorough in making sure she got all of our information &amp; our order correct.

Food arrived 8:40 which was good timing. The delivery man was nice. Now, on to the food! The chicken pieces in their dishes are long &amp; skinny as opposed to nugget shaped smaller sizes from other places. 

The sweet and sour chicken was great...the sauce was separate from the chicken and what I loved is that all the vegetables were not in the sauce. I hate tomatoes and peppers and often places will put the veggies in the sauce making the whole sauce taste like them. I loved that they put the veggies in with the meat as it didn&#39;t taint the sauce flavoring! 

The walnut chicken had a honey type of sauce to it. The chicken pieces in this were moist but the sauce was very thin. It was tasty, I just wish there was a bit more of it and it had some thickness to it. It came with a healthy amount of walnuts and broccoli which was good.

The last dish we got was Honey Thai Chicken. It wasn&#39;t what I was expecting at all. I didn&#39;t get the honey flavor much - it was pretty bland. Tons of veggies. Not worth the $12 at all when the much better small sizes S&amp;S chicken and walnut chicken were about $7 each and the same size.

My experience at Hunan has been hit-or-miss.  My wife and I get the same variation of foods off-and-on at Hunan; sometimes dining-in and sometimes ordering-out.  Normally (say 80% of the time), the food is out-of-this-world good and the service is excellent, but on occasion the food is out-right inedible.  

Today was a day where the food was absolutely tasteless, bland and just plain wrong.  It was so tasteless and bland that I added homemade sauces to spice things up.  On top of that, midway through, my wife and i noticed we were eating Lo-Mein Noodles when we had ordered Pad-Thai.  I called the restaurant to point out the error (and I NEVER send food back or complain), and the response was outright dismissive and unapologetic.  Come to find out, the normal &#34;noodle chef&#34; is out on Thursdays, so if I were you and today is a Thursday, and you were thinking of getting any noodle dish....I would reconsider and think about getting something else.

We were greeted warmly by several of the employees and given a great table from where we could watch everything going on in the restaurant. Our waitress, Betty was a rock star! she was efficient, yet reminded me of a mom always asking if we were ok. When the little one spilled his drink, it was no problem. We wiped it up and presto, we had another drink, this time with a lid on it. Appetizers were delish, the shrimp toast one of the best ever! Crab rangoons, filled perfectly and fried just right. Even the munchkin liked them, (these folks are truly kid friendly...not just an act, but then our little one is really a good kid..lol) . When it came time to order dinner, I wanted something different and told Betty to leave it up to the kitchen, as long as it wasn&#39;t too spicy. They brought out a pork dish that was incredible! Tender slices of pork, a savory sweet sauce, onions, cellophane noodles....yum, yum!  The rest of the dishes were equally tasty, even the sweet and sour chicken had a nice little twist to it! For dessert the fried bananas and vanilla ice cream was a perfect ending.

As for the food though, honestly it was so/so. Chicken noodle soup was like a miso with thin rice noodles and some chicken - ok. Eggroll was good, but the hot mustard had a heavier than usual vinegar taste to it - I had to scrape some off. Mongolian beef was ok - I&#39;ve had better and worse. Came with fried rice which seemed a little dry - would have preferred steamed rice but wasn&#39;t asked, and didn&#39;t think to ask myself.

Value was decent - soda is in cans and are not bottomless - $1.25 each. My tab was $10.50 plus a $2 tip - easy to digest.

My husband loves their fried rice (he would call himself a friend rice connoisseur so that&#39;s a high rating for him). He also enjoys their chow fun, you can&#39;t get it the way they make anywhere else in the suburbs. 

Their wonton noodle soup definitely hits the spot when it&#39;s cold and snowy out. I did get the beef noodle soup once and felt that there was too much fatty beef parts that I didn&#39;t enjoy as much.

They had several large parties, and it is a fairly small place, so we understood. They seated us at a table to wait. While waiting, we watched people around us, and saw lots of different foods we want to try.

In particular, there was a fabulous looking dish I had to ask about. They explained it was a full fried chicken which you have to order a day in advance - next time. There was also a bitter melon omelet that looked fantastic.

What we ordered turned out to be great too. The Sweet and Sour soup was among the best I&#39;ve had. Together, we ordered the soup, chicken and Chinese broccoli, Hot and Spicy Chicken and Vegetables and Bitter Melon and Pork Ribs in Casserole. Because we had to wait a short time, they gave us a Pork Fried Rice for our trouble. So nie of them. Because, the fried rice was outstanding.

So, next time, we order the whole fried chicken a day before we go, and we will dine in rather than carry out.",13/12/14,156,5,2,3,13,2.1485000000000003,1.9969999999999999,0.636,15.367,No,1280

So for the haters, this is authentic asian cafe food. If you go to hong kong this is very similar to the food you get from the diners for lunch. There are many americanized items, but this is very similar to HK fast food scene. The beef chow fun was well cooked with plenty of flavors. Not too salty and there appeared to be no MSG. The rest of the menu is a mixture of rice, noodle, etc dishes. Prices are good and servers are friendly and fast. The only detracting value is the dingy bathrooms which is typical of Hong Kong diner type restaurants so I guess it adds to a the authentic value. Another thing missing would be combo meals that would come with hot milk tea which would be very authentic. Oh well

Pro: inexpensive, great canto diner food

Cons: dirty/dingy bathrooms

Our table ordered the cha siu pork, the sauted chinese broccoli, and a fried turnip cake (a weekend special) to share. I also ordered a bowl of shrimp dumpling noodle soup to split with my mom. I loveeedd the cha siu as well as the fried turnip cake. I only had a little bit of both because they are both cheat foods for me, but they were delicious!! If I had a little less restraint, I&#39;m sure I could have downed both orders and then some.

 The turnip cake is lightly battered and deep fried, leaving the center moist. I also appreciated that the each piece of cha siu was heavily glazed with cha siu marinade. I hate it when I get that piece of cha siu that is super dry, tough to chew, and flavorless, but the cha siu here is none of the above! I really enjoyed the shrimp dumpling noodle soup as well.

So, we decided to hop on our recently tuned-up bikes and bike over to somewhere nearby that we haven&#39;t been to yet. Hong Kong Cafe was our destination.

You know how you can tell an ethnic restaurant must be good if many people of that certain ethnicity are dining there? This was one of those places. Nearly every table was full of Chinese families and friends. We kind of stuck out like sore thumbs (especially because every was watching us park our bikes outside), but the staff immediately approached us with warm smiles and cool glasses of water. I also got a pina colada bubble tea that tasted amazing and had a generous amount of tapioca balls (writing this review right now is tempting me to finish so I can go back and one now!).

The food we ordered arrived rather quickly. My husband loved his chicken fried rice. My mixed vegetables with tofu was kind of a disappointment. The veggies were good but they were few in a large plate of abundant, soft, tasteless tofu. The overwhelm of icky tofu caused me to dislike my meal. I let my server know and she suggested that next time I ask for the tofu to be flavored and fried -- it&#39;s much better. Apparently I wasn&#39;t the only one who had that opinion about it. I believe her and I&#39;m glad she gave me that tip (but why couldn&#39;t they have just done it that way the first time around?).

Cool:
1. Chocolate fortune cookies!
2. Picture menu
3. Decor rocks


What held this back from being a 5-star review:
1. Hot and Sour soup was $5.75! Unless I get the whole pot, I&#39;m not paying that much. I&#39;ve never seen that soup for more than $3.
2. Tea is not complimentary.
3. I don&#39;t think our server said a word to us the entire time.
4. My water wasn&#39;t refilled even after I asked. I had two spicy dishes that I still put more chili oil on, so my mouth was on fire by the end of my meal... and my cup was empty. :(

hong-kong-caf-schaumburg-2,Veronica X.,1cF0kgsaBy-l7od8bh899w,k22wgkvG67rh26TkIn_CeQ,"Located in a quiet strip mall, featuring many authentic HK style caf/diner foods on the menu, this place had the gem potential but after two visits (three months apart) I just can&#39;t see myself back here again anytime soon. 

The first time we had the Black Pepper Beef Short Ribs and it was great. The deep fried bread was ok. That visit merits three stars but the second visit doesn&#39;t. 

Roast pork (Char Siu) and roast duck are Cantonese staples and they can make or break a Cantonese place for me. I am afraid Hong Kong Cafe did not deliver. The color of the roast pork was off (too red) and meat was a bit dry. The roast duck didn&#39;t have the crispy skin and meat was bland. They sat on top of a plate of rice haphazardly splashed with pure soy sauce--what happened to my meat juice? You know, the french ain&#39;t the only people who does the au jus thing. And I do miss a few stems of Chinese broccoli adorning my rice plate. 

Had a bite of the vegetable egg roll and found the skin too thick, cabbage filling boring and inside slightly doughy. The fish fillet congee (available on weekends only) was just a faint reminder of one of my favorite comfort foods. The texture of the congee (rice porridge) was not bad, but the wrong kind of fish ruined it. Perhaps I should have tried the preserved egg (not sure who started calling it thousand-year old egg but it was pretty ignorant IMHO) and pork congee, which is in fact the most popular congee among Cantonese folks.  

By now I should probably mention Cantonese food is very dear to me so I tend to give somewhat harsh criticism when it&#39;s not done right. I am sure there are things they do right but I will need to find an excuse to come back and find out, maybe for the tapioca freeze treats...

hong-kong-caf-schaumburg-2,Chris M.,T8UQb589USyQqyr_t9rOrA,_vNml_ypBfKxZ7ksKmqfiA,"There is nothing like finding a new hidden treasure. There are a lot of Asian restaurants in the area but many of them are not worth my time, so I am excited to finally have a new one to add to my list. We tried to come on a Monday and found it was closed on Mondays, so we returned a couple days later to give it a shot. Walking in, I was greatly encouraged by the fact that nearly all the patrons were Asian -- a good sign.

There are just 10 or so tables in this small restaurant but the environment is very nice, clean, and relatively up-to-date, much better than the average strip mall restaurant. The service was quick and friendly. 

I ordered the General Tso&#39;s Chicken (not real Chinese food, I know) and my wife ordered Mongolian Beef. Her beef was absolutely succulent and not covered in sauce like it tends to be in other places. My General Tso&#39;s had what I always look for first -- crispy breading. This is rare, particularly in suburban restaurants, so this is a big win for Hong Kong Cafe. On the downside, the flavor was not quite what I expect from this dish. As such, I would not order this particular item again, but would happily order plenty of other things from the menu.

The lunch specials were perfectly sized: plenty of food but not a mountain of it. The hot and sour soup I got with it was delicious and perfect. At only $6 a piece, the price is great.

I brought my 2 year old son along, who had a chicken/egg/corn soup that was pretty tasty. I liked that they gave him a proper kids sippy cup with a straw that didn&#39;t spill, a rarity from any restaurant.

This is tied with House of Pho as my new favorite Asian restaurant in the Schaumburg area!",03/04/13,189,5,2,5,43,7.1408,3.2880000000000003,0.406,14.306,No,1686
hong-kong-caf-schaumburg-2,Alex R.,XmoPHem74pKNbJnFrOyGSw,G3NLZc_JhXfeH3oTFpvY4g,"I&#39;ll start by saying the food is always excellent. This update is about their pricing, more specifically, the discrepancies in the prices listed and what is actually charged. 

They do not input their orders into a computer so the tab is susceptible to error. Lately we&#39;ve noticed that our bills have been a tad bit more expensive than what we expected based on what&#39;s listed on the menu. Had this happened only once, I would have chalked it up to mere human error. Hey, anyone can make a simple mathematical error. But when it&#39;s happened the last four times, I start to suspect maybe something is up. Each time, I&#39;ve had to literally go over our order and reference the menu price with the person who took my order (it&#39;s been the same lady each time). Each time, she&#39;s found that&#39;s she&#39;s made an error. She doesn&#39;t offer an apology but merely scratches off the old price and scrawls in the new price.

The &#34;errors&#34; have been generally between ~ 80 cents to ~ $1.25. That may not seem like much, but that adds up if you order from here frequently. Look, there&#39;s no concrete evidence that the restaurant is doing anything illicit. It could just be that the person who took my order is simply bad at entering the correct prices into a calculator. But again, it&#39;s starting to smell a little fishy when it&#39;s happened the last four times, and when the price discrepancy is just small enough to be negligible -- maybe they think that nobody will check since the price is in the ballpark and the bill is tabulated by hand, often in handwriting that&#39;s difficult to read. All I&#39;m saying right now is double check your bill. It doesn&#39;t take very long, and it could very well save you some money.",28/01/13,176,3,1,-1,-75,-1.6901000000000002,0.7150000000000001,1.676,14.609,No,1757

I visited here with the boyfriend and his family who are Chinese and knows quite a big about Canton and Hong Kong dishes and they have been fond of this place. Luckily, when I&#39;m with them, his family always order a plethora of dishes and being that it was my first time at the restaurant, it really gave me a good idea of the many dishes that they offered.  

We had a fantastic luncheon that felt more like a feast with beef and seafood congee, beef chow fun, 2 kinds of rice rolls in soy sauce and XO sauce, hot and sour soup, turnip cake, wonton thick rice noodle soup. 

The chow fun and rice rolls were really flavorful and it didn&#39;t look like any other chow fun you would get from other cook-cutter Chinese restaurants.  It was not too soft nor hard and had the right about amount of a bit crunchy-ness to it.  Though with fried noodles, you will get a bit of oil and this restaurant will use oil.  But I guess that comes with the food.  

The congee soup was very good and it was made Canon style so the rice was more fluffy than other congees.  Just have a taste of it if you&#39;re looking for something warm to start with and you&#39;ll see what I mean.  The hot and sour soup was good but I must say it tasted a bit more sweet than it was sour.  Every place makes it different and they just need to adjust the balance.  

Turnip cakes was yummy and wonton soup was delish...  Overall, I was pretty satisify with this place and I would visit again.  The food is good though the service can bit a little abrupt but they&#39;ll get your order out quick (which is pretty accurate of most local small-business restaurants).

My meal started with the hot &amp; sour soup which is VERY spicy! I was proud of myself &amp; my sensitive taste buds for having as much as I did. It has some tofu in it and something we couldn&#39;t quite identify but thought maybe it was eggplant? I found that to be an interesting selection.

Then we ordered the fried bread thanks to the yummy looking picture a fellow Yelper posted. It was a good addition at $3.30. It was steaming hot, lightly deep fried and just tasted so moist and appetizing. I loved it! 

I added the egg roll to my lunch special...not necessary at all with the HUGE amount of food we got but I really wanted to give it a try. I consider myself to be an eggroll connoisseur and can never seem to find the perfect one. I would venture to say that this might just be the best eggroll I&#39;ve ever had! No joke! It wasn&#39;t overly deep fried, came out of the deep fryer nice &amp; hot. I loved the crispiness of the outside. It was a very thick eggroll filled with a lot of tasty ingredients on the inside. It cost an extra $1.25 to add to my meal but it was well worth it!

For my main entree, I ordered the sweet &amp; sour lunch special with white rice (it comes standard with fried rice). It was just a bit over $6 and was a huge portion. The chicken pieces were very large and moist compared to other places. The sauce was the Chinatown standard...orange and saucy! It wasn&#39;t overly amazing but still good. My friend got the beef chow fun which I tasted. Now that was amazing!

We were one of just a few tables in there for lunch. The service was very friendly, much better then the standard Chinatown which I keep comparing this lunch to. Food came out very fast which was perfect for our lunch. We have an hour for lunch...it took us 10 minutes to get here, 10 minutes to get back to work, and in that 40 minutes we had soup, appetizer, side dish, main dish &amp; chocolate fortune cookies...didn&#39;t go over on our time at all!

Very well lit, bright accent colors and solid industrial aluminum chairs.
This is a lunch review only. 

$6.50 for spicy veggie, tip &amp; tax included; SO fast my veggies were undercooked even by MY standards and that is how I liked them I thought. I think they just threatened them with some hot soy sauce. Tea included, they may have to like you for a 3rd cup. 
Hot &amp; sour a little vinegary, no leftovers except for way too many raw green peppers. I&#39;m working through their lunch specials and will update. The chocolate fortune cookie is growing on me and kind of fun.

These are it. Big fat fried pork dumplings with a thin (but not wimpy) skin, and a fluffy pork filling. Amazing. Soy and vinegar on the table. I love.

I ordered string beans with garlic, which was not on the menu, but which they graciously (and perfectly) cooked for me. We also got the orange chicken - not my idea. It was head and shoulders above what you normally get when you order this dish, gingery and delicious. 

Based on yelp, I got the beef chow fun in black bean sauce. It was delicious, but the noodle were thick rice noodles, where I was expected wide, flat noodles (like Pad See Eiu noodles). A little disappointing, but still delicious.

Topped off with a mango ice smoothie, and this meal was perfection. I will be back, despite the long drive from the city.

hong-kong-caf-schaumburg-2,Peter K.,W-WTs-vofJqK_-rDUUJJlA,By6xIeD9GQwxpB4w-QxNvg,"I struggled to assign this place a star rating. In a 10 star system, I&#39;d give them 6 stars (or slightly above average). In a 5 star system, I want to give them 3.5. At the end of the day, I will give them 3 stars because they don&#39;t quite reach the &#34;price/value&#34; relationship because of my perceived higher prices from them.

PROs
- The quality of their food is really good. I&#39;ve had their spicy fried fish. They keep the outside of the fish crunchy and the inside tender. They also use green onion, pepper flakes, and salt on the outside to make it super tasty.
- Their fish fillet in white sauce is really tasty. If you&#39;re looking for something to balance out beef, chicken, or vegetable dish, I&#39;d recommend this dish.
- Their Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce tastes great. There is a great mix of flavor between the broccoli and the garlic.

CONs
- Their dishes are rather pricy for Chinese food in the area. Most of their dishes range from $9-13. I know that&#39;s in the medium range. For my taste, I always have second thoughts when I&#39;m debating which dish to get because it just barely pushes me into that range where I wonder if it&#39;s worth it.
- They got my order wrong so I ended up with fried fish instead of the fish in white sauce, but it still tasted good.
- The ambiance is nice. It has a TV screen showing some Chinese TV in the back. The service is pretty good.

My only big hesitation about this place is it&#39;s priced a bit higher than some other Chinese places in the area. Other than that, it&#39;s definitely worth going in a big group where you can try lots of dishes.",25/01/12,182,3,2,5,25,4.4459,2.8899999999999997,0.499,17.611,No,1629

We ordered lunch and they all came with soup, which was quite good. I had the hot and sour soup, and it had lots of mushrooms, bamboo, and tofu, and a really nice spicy kick.

My girlfriend and I then split an order of curry chicken and an order of Cantonese BBQ Beef over chow mein, both of which were extremely well done. The curry flowed thick over the chicken while the BBQ Beef sauce, if not as sweet as I would have hoped, moistened the crispy noodles just enough and settled the dish into a harmonious equilibrium.

I am a big fan of the Singapore noodles!!! The potstickers are fine, the egg rolls are egg rolls (how can one screw up an egg roll?)...

Here is what I like about this place...any time I have ever been there, the only customers eating there are of asian descent....they are usually speaking in their native tongue and using chopsticks instead of a fork. I usually see either couples, or more regularly large, multi-generational asian families eating there.

This is a GREAT sign in my opinion, because it means the food is likely more authentic. Being a gringo, I do realize that a lot of the Chinese food on the menu (and in most take aways in the states) have been dumbed down for the western palate...I doubt you&#39;ll find generals chicken or sweet and sour pork in Beijing or Canton...

Hong Kong caf has those dishes of course, but they also have things like jellyfish, stuffed bean curd...not that I have ever had those (I&#39;m just not brave enough I guess), but the fact that those are offered reinforces my opinion that they do authentic cooking first, and cater to the Midwestern corn eaters second.

I have had only one bad experience there and it was my own fault. I had never had chow mein before - ever in my life, and decided I would order that. I&#39;m sure (hopefully) it was prepared well, I think it is likely just the nature of chow mein...it was a disgusting, opaque, slurry of noodles and pork. Flavoreless and tasteless and a texture that made it wholly inedible.

This one experience however, did not influence my rating for this place. I ordered gringo food, I got gringo food - my fault! Not theirs!

He said &#34;you&#39;re gonna have to remind me about that because I&#39;ll forget&#34;. What!?! The waiter is supposed to remember this. During our two hour wait, our waiter Julio only came to our table once to update us on our order status, but only because we waved him down to ask. Two hours later when the pizza came out, he forgot our fries. We had to remind him about the fries. Once they came out, we asked for drink refills and ketchup. He pointed to our cups and said &#34;but your cups are full?&#34;  Yes, our cups were full,  because all the ice melted during the two hours we waited. He didn&#39;t even bring us the refills. We had to ask another waitress for our drinks! When we waved him down again,  we asked for the ketchup again. He brought it out a little while later, but all he brought was a tiny cup with about 3oz of ketchup for TWO ORDERS OF FRIES. We had to ask the other waitresses for stuff because Julio was nowhere to be found at times. Another waitress finally brought us a full sized bottle of ketchup. 

We spoke to the manager about the wait time and he said he would take care of the cost for us. When it was time to leave Julio said, &#34;So it&#39;s gonna be free, plus whatever you want to leave for tip&#34;. I don&#39;t think waiters should be asking for tips. I understand that the wait time for the pizza was not his fault. But the service could have been so much better. 

Overall, very unsatisfactory experience. Mike the manager seems polite. But our waiter need to be more attentive to his tables.",08/10/16,208,1,1,3,-3,2.9716,1.427,0.1,25.472999999999995,No,1807
giordanos-schaumburg,Elyse L.,niTdjI2tBGiZJLhNWtyqdw,c9-1cptcIQxrmjYqDP9SgA,"Deep dish pizza holds a special place in my heart. It&#39;s cheesy and decadent, unlike anything I&#39;d ever had back home in Texas. Anytime we have plans to visit Chicago, we always know pizza will be our first meal there.

There are many pizza chains in Chicagoland, but Giordano&#39;s is my favorite simply because the more cheese to sauce ratio is what I prefer. Lou&#39;s I find to be more saucy, Gino&#39;s bland, and Pequod&#39;s better for thin crust as opposed to the traditional Chicago deep dish. You can order Giordano&#39;s pizza online too which I plan to try someday. One of our friends told us that if you use a liberal coating of olive oil on the bottom of the pan you bake it in, the flavors come out almost identical.

This location in Schaumburg is fairly new and very spacious. Plenty of comfy booths and ample free parking in their private lot. 

The pizzas take 40 minutes or so to bake, so I recommend knowing what you want ahead of time. That way you can place your order with your server at the same time you get your drinks. 

A small deep dish for two people is usually more than enough food. We always end up with leftovers because I can&#39;t eat more than two slices in a sitting. (I even remove the crusts to save my appetite for the middle since that&#39;s where all the glorious melty cheese is). 

We also like to start with their bruschetta because it&#39;s really delicious. It has mounds of seasoned tomatoes and fresh mozzarella on top of crusty bread. They then drizzle it with a balsamic vinaigrette and finish with a sprinkle of basil. 

Our favorite topping combination is pepperoni, fresh garlic, and jalapeo. It&#39;s the perfect blend of savory, spicy, and salty in each bite. 

They have decently priced lunch specials also, but I&#39;m assuming for those you can&#39;t custom pick the toppings since they are probably baked ahead of time to get people out the door and back to the office in an hour. Same thing goes with their online pies which you can only get in their top selling flavors. 

We&#39;ve never had a bad experience at Giordano&#39;s and it&#39;s always the perfect place to have great food and catch up with friends. Just make sure to pack your stretchy pants.",25/07/16,244,5,2,5,38,7.707700000000001,3.433,0.0,19.567,No,2227

giordanos-schaumburg,Shawn B.,X4s64eemnxtpk5NMBDiDPA,u9aIZ0BVrZCFgAB9bYFYfg,"I was here for the soft opening of this new Giordano&#39;s location. I think the management should be happy with the staff, because openings do not always go this well. The building looks great! It is fairly large and there is a separate area for pickups. There is a full bar and the seating area is large, with a lot of booths. 

When I arrived there was a wait for a table. They said they would text me when the table was ready. Although I thought this was a great idea, for some reason, I had a feeling that it would not work. I told the hostess I was going to be at the bar and someone came and got me. Apparently, there is an issue with my cell phone provider. Since relying on my intuition is a mixed bag, maybe they should&#39;ve mentioned that, but, it turned out fine. The bartender was very friendly and the service at the bar was good. 

The table wasn&#39;t the best, but I can talk to my friend anywhere, and it was busy. The service was very good, and the food came out on time. I noticed the time they quoted for a deep dish pizza was 45 minutes, which is 15 longer than at the BG location, but at least they were upfront about it when we ordered. 

We had the  bruschetta, which was pretty decent, and a deep dish pizza. The pizza was just what I expected and It is my favourite pizza in Chicago, so that is a good thing. The manager stopped by our table to see if everything was OK, and to thank us for coming out. 

I was very happy I tried this place and I would definitely return. The only other Giordano&#39;s building I&#39;ve been in that was as nice as this location was downtown.

I can honestly say this is the worst one I&#39;ve ever been to and the worst deep dish pizza I&#39;ve ever had. The taste was ok. I ordered half sausage and half veggie. 1/2 of the veggie side had sausage on it mixed with the veggie. The worst part was the shallow pizza that they gave us.  This $30 pizza was as thick as a a dominos pizza. It was truly sad and disappointing. They cheaped out on ALL the ingredients.

Well considering that Giordanos has always been my favorite, I always thought I&#39;d give nothing less than 5 stars! Tonight&#39;s experience changed things drastically!

I was put on hold &amp; then a girl came on &amp; told me that due to a system glitch, the order was never received &amp; it was just put in the oven. I asked when it would arrive and if they were comping the meal so she then had me hold again to get a manager. After a few minutes a manager Mike got on the line and explained the system glitch once again, he apologized, &amp; offered us a $15 gift card for our troubles. I then reiterated to him that our food was going to be at least 2 hours late, no one called to explain anything or even ask if we still wanted it, but he was offering us a big whopping $15. He then finally offered to comp our meal, said the pizza just came out of oven, &amp; that it would arrive within 15 mins.   So NOT true!

After eating my appetizer I was very thirsty so when the hostess finally showed up to her post, I left my table and walked up to her asking &#34;Can you please help me find a straw?&#34; Well, she found an unwrapped straw and gave it to me. Even though it was unwrapped, beggars can&#39;t be choosers (I guess) so I went ahead and drank with it. The pizza was undercooked and the chicken cobb salad had no distinctive trace of chicken in it. I forced myself to give the server some sort of gratuity. I was so tired of waiting for my check at the end of the meal that I went to the empty hostess desk once again in hopes that someone would notice me and I can finally leave this nightmare experience. The server finally shows up to tell me that I can pay at the table. When he noticed my facial expression in response to his statement, he said &#34;Yeah, I should&#39;ve brought you the check.&#34; Finally, a manager decided to appear and ask me if I have been helped and I said &#34;barely&#34;.

Time of my visit: Dinner-ish

This was my first time at this place.  I wanted to know, if it was related to Poor Boy down in Maywood, but forgot to ask.

I ordered Gyro sandwich to go and nothing else.  It was made fairly quickly and I was on my way.  The service was polite and curious!

I got home and the sandwich looked beefy (no pawn intended), which was good!  It had cucumber sauce, onions and tomatoes.  The meat was juicy, tender and excellent!  The pita was soft and warm.  I would say it was one of the best Gyros I have ever had.  And it was at good price too, $5 and change.

I would give this place an A!  Definitely a return visit is in order and soon!",06/10/16,91,5,1,3,4,2.396,1.974,0.48,10.546,No,700

Myself and two others came on a Saturday night right before closing - 8:30ish. Service was friendly and fast. The restaurant is small but offers a a few tables, counter and stool seating. The dining area is kept very clean with a steady stream of customers. We dined in and saw what appeared to be regulars getting take out orders. Everyone seemed to know each other. 
My ribeye steak dinner was delicious! Well seasoned, tender and a nice portion. The pita was hot and soft. My son&#39;s meatball sandwich was tasty but on the small side.  I think it could of stood at least two more meatballs. The bread to meatball ratio was a little off. French fries were hot and salty, just the way I like them. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the horchata was, very cinnamonany. If that&#39;s a word.

The food was below average, the service was OK, and the parking was sparse. I will say that their prices are very reasonable, I would go as far to say that they are &#34;cheap&#34;. Then again, I thought the food was meh, so I guess this makes sense. 

I came in around 1pm on a weekday, so the lunch hour was still very active. They share a parking lot with a cleaners, a pizza place, an Asian massage place (HEYO!) and I think a small lotto store, so needless to say that the tiny shared parking lot can get pretty full. It&#39;s all tightly packed, so pulling in and out can definitely be a strange challenge.

I ended up just ordering a cheeseburger with fries for carryout, since their limited seating was completely full. I ordered my burger medium-well, and it came medium-rare, which isn&#39;t a big deal to me, but it still wasn&#39;t the way I ordered it. The fries had clearly been sitting for a little while, as they weren&#39;t hot at all. The burger was only $2.59 and the fries were another $1.64, so $4.23 for lunch isn&#39;t too bad at all. However, I would much rather pay a couple bucks extra to ensure my food is hot, cooked to order, and tasty. Unfortunately, my food wasn&#39;t any of  these.

Maybe I just caught them on a bad day, since the reviews are generally positive. And, considering I live so close, there&#39;s a chance I&#39;ll give this place another shot. However, I still haven&#39;t been back, and they certainly aren&#39;t high on my list to try again. Although, if you need to wait on your cleaners, you could always pop in for a quick massage, then play a couple scratch off tickets, and grab a $5 meal, all without leaving the parking lot.",24/04/16,218,2,2,4,38,3.4885999999999995,2.09,1.0070000000000001,14.904,No,1799

Inside there are a few tables, some stools and a counter to sit on. A large menu board to the left of the order counter showing all of their menu items, and even a few picnic tables outside the door.

First off let me go over the Hot Dog served here. The hot dog they serve is a Red Hot Chicago branded dog served on a soft non-poppy seed bun. To my delight the pickle is thinly cut, they use the right amount of onions, relish, mustard and use sport peppers that are neither too hot or too large which properly compliment the dog itself. The relish used is a little sour, and I don&#39;t detect any celery salt. But beyond those few flaws this is a good quality Chicago style hot dog.

Where Poor Boy&#39;s excels even more is at grilling things, their burgers have nice thin well grilled patties with a nice char flavor to them, their chicken sandwich is good as well.

If you&#39;re ever in the mood for some excellent gyros (like we were tonight knowing January is when people go on diets) then this is THE SPOT!  

I was a little leery on making this a choice at first, but after reading other yelp reviews, we decided Poor Boy 2 was worth a trip.  Let me tell you....POOR BOY 2 WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!  Don&#39;t get skewed into thinking this little strip of stores won&#39;t offer something great.

My wife and I made it over to the supposedly &#34;BEST GYROS&#34; (according to the Daily Herald) on Wheaton&#39;s N. Main a few months ago .  I would love to know who paid DH off for those votes. (those aforementioned gyros are nasty, greeeeezy and OMG I&#39;m going to be up all night!)  In my opinion there is NO COMPARISON!  Outside of Gemato&#39;s in Naperville, Poor Boy 2 has THE BEST GYROS around.  Pita griddled to perfection, gyro meat pilled just high enough and topped with nice fresh creamy tzatziki sauce.

Lastly, instead of shouting out ready orders to everyone within the fairground area, the guy (chef) was even kind enough to bring out our order to our stools where we waited and thanked us before we left to partake in gluttony in the comfort of our own home.

One suggestion I&#39;d like to make (and earn that 5th star) would be to replace their current frozen fries with fresh cut fries.

Food: We got the butter chicken, chicken biriyani and garlic naan. They all had great flavor and the chicken was so tender. Surprisingly though, the garlic naan is what took it to the next level. The texture was soft and chewy, while the garlic kept my taste buds in check! It went really well with the butter chicken.

Service: Service was nice and friendly. We ordered at the front and waited to pick up our food at the table. During our meal, the host went to all the tables asking how the food tasted. For a place that has a order &amp; pick-up setting, I thought it was nice they paid attention to their service.

Their food is delicious, And the guy at the counter is pretty friendly too. He offered us complimentary lassis a couple times. :)

Baigan bharta that they make is not actual bharta and it is Eggplant in spicy gravy served in Andhra Pradesh with biryani... It tastes good for sure but the name is misleading??

I started eating Indian/Pak food a few years back and am a big fan of it. This is a great spot for freshly made to order Indian take-away...you could eat there, but it is small and not the most up-market of settings...it is a total winner though for take-away!!!
 
I have been there several times, but have only ordered a few things:
 
Biriyani - On the weekends they have goat - I have also had the lamb biriyani...this is consistently excellent and for between $8 and $12 depending on the variety, you get a TON...I am a man of some girth and generally it takes me two days to finish an order of their biriyani. It is some of the best I have had anywhere.
 
Chicken 65 - You know those popcorn buckets they have at movie theaters? Just fill one to the rim with this stuff and I would be happy for a long time...awesome!!!
 
Naan - freshly made to order in their tandoor oven - it rocks the Kasbah!
 
Tandoori Chicken - I recommend it...decent flavor. Be aware, it takes approx 30 min or so, so phone in your order.
 
Saag Paneer - Spinach with paneer...the flavor was quite nice, but I am used to a thicker consistency so on texture alone, not sure as I would order it again, but I think this is due to personal preference - it was well prepared
 
Mijji Binjji - or however you spell them...these are pretty spicy chili peppers coated in lentil flour and deep fried. The owner gave me a sample while I was standing there a few weeks back and it was awesome! I ordered them last night and - like most fried food - it doesn&#39;t travel well. While still warm, it had steamed in its Styrofoam container on the drive home and ruined the texture. If you are eating there, they are worth getting - do not advise these for carry out
 
Pakoras - deep fried lentil dough...not as exciting as the Mijji Binjji above but has the same issue when taken off-site - the deep fried dough steams on the ride home and looses texture.
 
This is a GREAT place for take-away. It is the same or cheaper than other Indian places in the area that I have seen/visited. I probably wouldn&#39;t eat on site, but I get take-away from there every other week or so and love it! They just opened a few months back and I really hope they are doing well (seem to do ok) because I want them to stay around for years to come",20/04/15,257,4,3,5,61,7.834400000000001,3.3899999999999997,0.38299999999999995,15.226000000000003,No,2379

We ordered the veg samosas and lassis first which I must say were great. We also got the fish fry which would have been good but was very spicy!!

I ordered the chicken biryani which was cold had little chicken and too pricy.

My parents had masala dosa and idli which were also very bad. Potatoes in the dosa were cold and dosa itself very dry. Idlis were also cold and dry. But the most disappointing was the sambar. It was sour like it had gone bad and I couldn&#39;t eat one bite. 

Sadly the only redeeming quality was the price and the lassi and samosa. However the staff were great and the owner covered us for the dosas and idli because of the quality.

sampurnas-indian-flavor-schaumburg,Devin W.,UHRn43H2xpGEDQoBZscNtA,Q7rOSEsM5i4xJ9IpEgiSiQ,"AVOID THIS PLACE!

Short Story:
They screwed up our order 3 times (We only ordered 2 dishes and bread). It wasn&#39;t busy. We asked for a refund for one of the dishes because the eggplant was not cooked and we couldn&#39;t eat it. They did not refund the tax. Insult on top of it all. Wish the owner would reach out to me.

Long Story:
We ordered two veggie curries and some bread. They brought out 1 veggie curry and rice. We reminded them that there is one more curry and not rice but bread. So after another 10 mins they brought bread, and we had to remind them of the 2nd curry.

Finally they brought the masala egpplant, and as an apology for the 2 screw ups they brought a small mango dal, it was at room temperature though so we didn&#39;t eat it.

The masala eggplant  consisted of 2 baby eggplants, whole and very much under cooked, not at all edible. They were in a very runny sauce that wasn&#39;t very tasty. 

We finished the 1st curry and bread, and when the employee came to ask if everything was okay we told him that the egg plant wasn&#39;t cooked. He offered to bring some tamarind rice, but we asked for a refund, he agreed and then we waited for another 5 minutes, finally I had to go to the cash register to get our money back, he told the woman behind the cash register only to refund us the price of the dish, $9, he didn&#39;t refund the tax we paid. Crazy right? I was tired of waiting so I let the 90 cents go.

Needless to say we won&#39;t go back here, which is too bad because the first veggie curry that we got was really good.

I would recommend other Yelpers stay away!",21/03/15,181,1,1,0,-54,-0.6659999999999999,1.21,2.238,16.552,No,1603

I had the chicken vodka pasta and it was tasty! I had enough for 3 meals, the portion sizes are very generous. The caesar salad I had with my meal was good. 

My only small compliant was that the cheesy bread was burnt, I probably would not have served that to someone. I&#39;m sure if I said something they would have given me a new one.

Presentation of food - 9/10 

We ordered the Mergherita Pizza 18&#34; &amp; the Penne Rustica.

The pizza : 7/10 - NOT enough cheese. Seriously tasted like straight up Tomato Pure... WAAAY too much tomato, and not even cheese to even out the flavor. However, it is unique &amp; the fresh basil was nice..

Pasta : 7/10 - GREAT, new flavor. The sauce was seriously extremely watery??? If the sauce was a tad bit thicker it would be DELICIOUS. Reducing the sauce would be a great option however, it&#39;s not bad watery. Just the flavor would definitely hit home run if it was thicker.

We were seated immediately and waited a long time for a waitress to come to our table. When she did she asked if anyone had helped us yet, we said no and she said ok I&#39;ll be your waitress. Weird, but ok. She took our drink orders  and those were brought out in a timely manner. Then she took our dinner order, didn&#39;t ask if we wanted an appetizer. When my daughter&#39;s (teens) ordered she asked if they wanted soup or salad. They both chose soup, they had the choice of Thai something, or potato. However, they didn&#39;t really have a choice as she said I&#39;ll get you potato the Thai is too spicy for you. Thanks, but my girls don&#39;t mind spicy. Our salads and soup were ok nothing special.  Our dinners arrived,  shrimp diavolo, zesty shrimp spaghetti, farfalle creamy garlic con pollo, and roasted vegetables aglio e olio with shrimp. The diavolo and farfalle were the two best dishes, nothing special but good. The zesty shrimp was tomato sauce with shrimp and spaghetti, we don&#39;t know what the zesty part was, it was missing. The roasted vegetables with olive oil and shrimp was a huge disappointment, the shrimp were missing and when I pointed that out she said she would get me a plate with some shrimp. I declined and asked for the extra cost to be removed from our bill. The vegetables were sparse, when roasted vegetables are listed as the main ingredient I would expect there to be a lot of veggies. There was maybe a 1/4 cup of very small pieces of broccoli and a few pepper slices. Tossed in olive oil apparently means swimming in broth. So disappointing. Our waitress didn&#39;t come back to check on us, mid meal and our drinks were empty. She finally showed up and said I&#39;ll bring you boxes. My husband said no we are not done and we would like another glass of wine and a martini. By the time those arrived we were done with our meal. Overall a very disappointing experience.

Shame on me. 

The Roma is simple, unassumingly located on the bottom floor of an Elgin office building. Open for lunch on weekdays and dinner on Thursdays and Fridays, Roma&#39;s demand might outweigh the supply. What do I love about the Roma? I love taking a break to grab lunch from Roma, where I am always greeted with a smile from one of the employees, all of whom seem proud of the cuisine they serve. On a regular weekday, I try to keep it simple and order one of the daily soups. 

This is no ordinary soup. Chef Frank and his staff manage to turn ordinary soups like cream of mushroom and broccoli cheddar into masterpieces. Green and red Thai curries, Thai noodle soup, and vegetarian chili are departures from the Cafe&#39;s Italian menu but it is a welcome and delicious surprise. The soups are reasonably priced to include a piece of the Roma&#39;s dangerously addicting garlic bread and a house or Caesar salad. 

When I&#39;m looking for something a more generously sized, my go to is the Eggplant Parmesan. Unlike any other version of this traditional Italian dish, the eggplant is presented in thick cutlets, crunchy and flavorful, with a side of tasty pasta. I also have loved anything that comes with the Cafe&#39;s vodka sauce. 

The food is phenomenal- fresh ingredients, deliberate and exact flavors, and innovative renditions of world classics- and I would rank the Cafe&#39;s offerings among the best in the Chicago area. My only sincere grievance is that the Cafe isn&#39;t open everyday of the week and weekend for lunch and dinner. The food is worth the wait, if you go when it&#39;s busy, but the staff&#39;s commitment and pride in Cafe Roma makes it even more enjoyable. The ambiance is intimate and warm.

I ordered a side Caesar salad, one of the specials, a gnocchi in an incredible vodka cream sauce $ the tiramisu. I also sampled the home made chicken noodle soup, which was nice, but not anything to get excited about.

The biggest let down was the tiramisu. Some pieces were way too wet and then others tasted a little dry, and overall I found the coffee flavor a little overwhelming. 

On to the good parts of the meal, the gnocchi were okay; they&#39;re pretty huge and the consistency was t as pillowy and light as I would have liked but the sauce was definitely a very redeeming factor. You can also add protein for an up charge. All entrees are arced with a nice slice of cheesy garlic bread -- what could be bad about that? 

The salad was also really nice and fresh tasting. And I also ordered ice tea which was served with lemon and a sprig of mint; the garnish  made the beverage  feel surprisingly  fancy for a mid-day iced tea in the dead of winter. :)

The second day was Italian beef and some sausage concoction with rolls to make our own little delectable sandwiches. All of it was juicy and fabulous. There was also Caeser salad on the side, which was wonderful.

For mid-winter this was about as good as my homemade version in the peak of tomato season in the summer. The lentil soup was perfect! I am a very healthy eater so it&#39;s very seldom that I can find a restaurant where I feel I&#39;m eating healthy. This place is definitely top of my list.
The eggplant parmesan was delicious!! If I hadn&#39;t already eaten so much, I would have devoured it. The good news is that now I have a fabulous lunch tomorrow! 
The only downfall here is that they&#39;re only open 2 nights out of the week. I will have to try them for lunch, but know I can&#39;t eat all the generous portions they provide.
Definitely a new favorite on my list.",17/01/13,94,4,2,5,37,6.681400000000001,4.628,0.0,9.372,No,889

As someone else mentioned the serving staff doesn&#39;t seem friendly -- I think they&#39;re very overwhelmed when it&#39;s lunch hour and they are so busy. They could really expand to take up an entire suite on the first floor. Or...open a small 2nd location in downtown Elgin (it&#39;s neeed... EPH is getting needing a little competition!) or bring it to Randall and go where the Borders was in the Commons! Expansion is needed for the customer&#39;s sake, but maybe the owners are super-pleased with the way things are, and that is OK!

Soups are phenomenal (they will give you a sample to try), salads fresh and giant, pastas al dente. Handmade pizzas are totally sharable. I have yet to have a bad meal here....OHHH and you get a piece of cheesy garlic toast with entrees.

What you do is order at the front counter by the register. You get a number and poker chips depending on what you order (chips are for drinks and soup). Then you sit at a table and a server will stop by and fill drink orders. They will also bring out your entrees when they&#39;re ready. Service can be scattered. Sometimes it takes a long while to get your food. But because it&#39;s really good REAL food (ie made from real ingredients) it&#39;s worth dealing with.

cafe-roma-elgin,Marc B.,#NAME?,7huENdfGqt5Jj7mGohiQWA,"Really good food, fresh top shelf ingredients, everything is well paired. The place is cute and it looks like they have a really nice outdoor patio (it was raining when we went.) Very romantic. They have a really intriguing six course price fixe dinner menu that we would like to go back for. I was very impressed! Unexpected location in the Crystal-Clean building right at 90 and Randall Road.

Now let&#39;s get this straight. I like this place. A lot. You should go here. But if you want to hear my issues with this joint read on...

I do not understand why restaurants need to find new and creative ways to make ordering food difficult. I shouldn&#39;t have to ask &#34;now how does this work? What do i do?&#34; 

When entering from outside, you have to walk through the dining area, behind the bar and wait in line in a dead-end little hallway. They have one or two specials on letter-sized easels which you can see while waiting in line. But you&#39;ll have to wait until you&#39;re at the register to see the whole menu because it&#39;s Scotch taped flat to the counter. You&#39;ll pay up front, which is fine - maybe it gives you the feeling it&#39;s going to be less expensive or faster. 

But here&#39;s where they really get creative. Order a drink and you&#39;ll get some little vague slips of paper. Once you&#39;re done paying you&#39;ll walk out back out of the dead-end hallway and find a table. Now, wait for your waitress so you can tell her again what you want because the slips of paper aren&#39;t specific. Then your waitress will tell the owner behind the bar your drink order. It was a very slow process -- but I must say -- I&#39;ve seen some goofy ordering processes but these little slips of paper top everything in terms of creativity.

I&#39;m afraid my next and final issue is really small, picky and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll think it&#39;s dumb -- my wife thinks I shouldn&#39;t even mention it but I&#39;m going to anyway. We were served a very fresh and delicious salad with homemade croutons and a tasty vinaigrette. However the silverware was the least expensive form of stainless steel available (its called 18-0) and is prone to having a chemical reaction with vinegar, causing a bad taste. It&#39;s that &#34;set your teeth on edge&#34; taste I&#39;m sure you may have experienced. This problem could easily be solved by changing the salad dressing recipe.

So there you have it. Solid four star place. Bring a casual date or a client.",10/07/09,267,4,1,5,-29,6.506600000000001,5.782,0.605,24.613000000000003,No,2472

If you would like to do so as well, I would strongly suggest calling your order in ahead of time. The food is definitely fresh and made to order, and that can take a while despite the fact that I was there well before the lunch rush.

As far as the quality of food, the chicken parmigiana was decent. The pasta was OK, too, if a bit under cooked for my liking. The meal included a salad and some cheese/garlic toast. The oil-based salad dressing was better than expected, but I would have preferred a choice of ranch or something else. 

For what it is, Cafe Roma is a decent place and just about the only game in the area for Italian food. I&#39;d be willing to give it another shot, but this time ordering something without pasta as a side.",10/10/13,89,3,1,3,-5,2.281,0.98,0.0,8.02,No,797

2-toots-train-whistle-grill-bartlett-2,Aimee M.,RO3vznPVVw5NWcgfP3k17A,vyIV8aCL8tsRkXzUFz4_WQ,"2 Toots was THE perfect place to host my sidekick&#39;s 2nd birthday.  Like others have said, it&#39;s more like a diner, just accented with trains. It&#39;s very family friendly and the staff was just lovely to work with.

I had booked our day about 6 weeks in advance. All of their party booking and FAQ&#39;s are on their website so I all really needed to do was check the place out, check out where our party would be seated and book it.  We did bring a cake instead of getting their house cupcakes. But their cupcakes did look cute. 

Their food is quite good. The menu is family and kid-centric but I appreciate that the beef is grass fed, prairie raised beef and that there are other options like salads and chicken on the menu. I love their burgers and it&#39;s interesting to know that the beef comes from Bill Curtis (of CBS) farm. 2Toots onion rings are pretty good too.  Probably some of the best onion rings I&#39;ve had. I&#39;d definitely order them instead of fries in the future. I also tried their dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets, and they were pretty good--tasted better than some restaurant chain&#39;s nugget offerings.  Their milk shakes are just ok. But I do appreciate the unlimited refills on our soda. 

They were able to accommodate our group of 24 really well. We had 2 servers and they worked so hard checking on us often and making sure we had everything we needed. Very lovely gals!  They made the day pretty perfect, and as a parent you bet I appreciated every effort they made. 

What is also a plus is that every seat in the house is along the train tracks, even the booths.  Because of that, everyone&#39;s food gets delivered by train.

My kids, in particular my Son, love it because he loves trains (as does his Father).  Would be nice if the place was a little closer to the actual MD West line for better visibility of what is primarily the Metra &#34;scoots&#34; passing through Bartlett, but regardless...  Would also be nice if they varied up the Lionel trains used to deliver the food.

The food isn&#39;t spectacular, the menu isn&#39;t expansive as it&#39;s a kids place, it&#39;s not meant to be, it&#39;s your pretty basic burger, grilled cheese, chicken tenders, type thing, but it can be a little bit more than just taking them to a pancake house/family restaurant for the same.

If you don&#39;t like loud noises, meaning whistles (as they&#39;re given to the kids), or the poor young waitresses having to endure their shift there pulling the train whistle, this place is probably best avoided.

2-toots-train-whistle-grill-bartlett-2,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,33WprzWFm8_IZSVS79tymA,"2 Toots Grill is a really fine example of how to do a restaurant that focuses on kids. Kids can care about more than pizza and video games, if you give them the chance.

To be sure, this location is very kid-friendly. Each meal seems to come with plastic train whistles, and rest assured, these whistles were being deployed frequently, and to great effect. So I got take-out.

Still, I was there long enough to get a good feel for the place. Most of the seating is located along an O-guage railroad track, which is continuously running two trains (an old Pennsylvania 19th century-era steam engine, and a more modern one) with six or seven Milwaukee Road flatbed cars where the cooks place their baskets of food to go out. 

It is, I have to admit, a pretty cool setup. There&#39;s also pictures of trains all over the walls, neon lights everywhere, kid-friendly music playing over the speakers, and even that horse you ride for a quarter in the corner.

I ordered a cheese car, which is their basic cheeseburger, along with onion rings instead of fries. The portion was appropriate for the price, and service was extremely friendly. Once I got to having my burger, I was impressed. The meat was seasoned, and the patty was smashed, although the burger itself was still pretty moist. All the veggies were fresh, and they made a wise choice to use all grass-fed beef; I could definitely taste the difference.

Throw on a large slice of sharp cheddar, and by the end I was thinking this was the best burger in town.

The onion rings were very good as well. I couldn&#39;t really tell if they battered their own onion rings, but it certainly tasted homemade; the onion rings have a thin, very crispy shell, were nice and softened up on the inside. A little salt and I was set.

2 Toots has the benefit of a trackside location, so kids can check out the freight trains whenever they pass. Fortunately, you don&#39;t need to be 6 years old to fully enjoy this place.",23/01/12,234,5,2,5,47,8.7774,4.023,0.0,15.977,No,1961

I believe they use grass fed beef for their burgers. My boys always get the hotdogs and enjoy them. They put baby carrots in with the kids meals which is a nice healthy add on. My friend had a chicken salad and commented how good the chicken was. I highly recommend their malts too! When I went to this location yesterday the staff was not so friendly but all in all it is a great place for kids and the food is pretty good!,10/01/15,67,4,2,5,15,4.4606,2.367,0.053,7.578999999999999,No,641

2-toots-train-whistle-grill-bartlett-2,Kim M.,VaDDhoa-IGKj3BMCHUxc4Q,pgswyFJBL-zBmWwUsM6nRA,"This is the best 2 Toots location out of all of them. It&#39;s huge, the layout is fabulous. I love that they use Grass Fed beef. The burgers are like a hybrid of Steak N Shake and Culvers. Your food gets delivered by a train riding around the counter. 

Feels like a diner, accented with trains. Pretty cut and dry. A little pricey.

Here is why it&#39;s three stars instead of four for me: 

While we were sitting there, one of the managers came over to us looked at my kids&#39; shakes (they&#39;d split one so they each had a cup). He turns around and says to our server, &#34;Did you give them these shakes?&#34; she said yes. He then proceeded to berate her in front of us about the type of straws she gave us. The straws he made her give us to replace the originals actually were worse. But whatever. Later on, he berated her for seating a large party in a certain area of the restaurant when another large party walked in. Yes, because she should have looked into her crystal ball to know that another large party would be coming in.

You may ask why I think this is worth noting - or why I even care. I was a server for a good 5 years in high school and college. I&#39;ve had &#34;that manager&#34; that does that sort of thing. It&#39;s humiliating for the server, and it&#39;s uncomfortable for the customer as well.  I tipped the server 25% because despite the manager&#39;s actions - she was a great server. 

We will go back, and hopefully that manager was just having an off day. We will see.",26/01/12,173,3,2,5,40,5.834300000000001,4.482999999999999,0.9039999999999999,17.613,No,1507

I took my kids here on a Sunday evening around 5. The place has a few other dinner guests but was not packed. This is a bonus for me. I enjoy taking my kids out to dinner and actually being able to have a conversation with them, which can be difficult in a packed place.

Menu is simple, which is also fine by me. The waitress was less than attentive and was too busy making sure her boss was not glaring at her pay attention to her customers. We ordered and food came out. I was surprised that the grass fed burger was so greasy and really just a skinny lump of meat on a bun. The fries were also greasy. My kids had chicken nuggets and those were overcooked.

They each had a cupcake that they did not eat much of only played with the train whistle.

Needless to say I was disappointed.",07/08/13,97,2,2,3,11,2.4902,1.5379999999999998,0.585,10.876999999999999,No,973

We took our son for his 2nd birthday. He absolutely loved it. He was so interested in all that was going on, he barely ate anything, but he entertained himself so that the adults could eat, a total plus.

The only reason for the 4 stars vs. 5 is the food. The burgers are so thin, I mean super duper thin. I felt bad for my husband and father, they should have ordered the double stack. One patty isn&#39;t enough for a grown man. My dad did get the chili, he enjoyed it...said he would get it again. I actually opted for a BLT and loved it. The bacon was thick and the whole grain bread was really good. The fries were also good and each burger comes with lettuce, tomato and pickle on the side. I do appreciate that they use the Tall Grass Beef too.

My son is part of the birthday club, his meal was free! Sign up your kids!!! His meal included a cupcake. He&#39;s not much into sweets, but took a couple bites, again, he was distracted by the whistle they put on the cupcake. He got a kick out of that, and in this place, him blowing it couldn&#39;t annoy anyone. My one complaint about the whistle is that they gave my son a pink one, I mean, come on. If there were 20 whistles and he chose the pink one, then fine, but if anyone from the restaurant is reading this, maybe you should segregate the whistles by gender. It would have been a nice touch. Good for my son though, he blew his pink whistle the entire ride home.

One last tip, the Bartlett train station is right across the street, I wish we would have taken the Metra there and had the true train day. Next time....",17/09/12,208,4,2,5,11,6.092499999999999,3.6949999999999994,0.538,19.767,No,1661
2-toots-train-whistle-grill-bartlett-2,George R.,nGdejkTKHuQryIOIFek02g,jl5aIlOC_uZvUrHSihR9Cg,"2 Toots Train Whistle Grill is a diner style restaurant complete with diner counters and  booths. A real model train runs on tracks around the restaurant carrying food orders to each table or diner seat. It&#39;s quite a hit with the little kids (and even some of the big kids). Music overhead was 1950&#39;s and 1960&#39;s classics and a small flat panel TV in the corner of the restaurant was playing &#34;The Polar Express&#34; (since it was the Christmas season).

Food is okay. I had the grass-fed beef burger and onion rings. The meat on the burger was kind of amorphous (versus round) and thin, but tasted just fine. Onion rings were average with a smooth batter coating.

I also ordered a vanilla shake made with real ice cream. Though I have a sweet tooth, the shake was very sweet. Maybe more ice cream or milk and less of the shake flavoring mix would help here. Too sweet for me to order again. Maybe a root beer float will be in order next time.

When you enter the restaurant, you should wait to be seated (or ask). I walked in and seated myself, then found out that they will seat you or direct you to a table. Others that came in after me did the same. But they were nice and didn&#39;t make a big deal out of it.

Service was nice and friendly. When your food is ready, a train comes from the kitchen area, travels around the restaurant and stops at your table where a server will remove the food from the train cars. Your server will also bring your drinks directly to you. Aside from the old style milk shakes and malts, the beverages looked like typical fountain drinks including pink lemonade and orange soda.

Overall, this is a fun, novelty type restaurant experience across from the Bartlett Metra train station. Great for families. Single diner counter seats for individuals. If the front parking spaces are filled, there&#39;s additional parking at the back of the building. Again, the food is okay but nothing to write home about. You go for the novelty of the place.",12/12/11,241,3,2,5,21,5.0361,3.6789999999999994,0.496,22.825,No,1994

We were welcomed with a smile and seated right away.  The menu had lots of kids&#39; favorites like chicken nuggets, PB&amp;J, grilled cheese, hot dogs, and burgers.  For adults, they offer what you might expect at a diner: burgers, chili, salads, etc.  While we waited for our food, there were plenty of fun and interesting things to look at and talk about.  And of course, the most interesting thing to watch was the O-gauge train that delivers food to all the tables.

We were very excited when we saw our train coming towards us with our food.  The food was hot and delicious.  For dessert, both kids ordered an ice cream sundae, which comes with a train whistle.  There was enough dessert for leftovers for daddy.

My 9 year old loved this place so much she insisted that we give this place a top-notch review.  The rest of this review is from my 9 year old daughter:

&#34;I love this place! I wish I could live there. I really like all the big surprises in there. I also love the way they deliver the food; it is so fun. It has quick service.

The first thing I don&#39;t like about this location is the hours. They are only open until 7 or 8, which I was bothered by at first but since I have zero intention of going back here, oh well.

I&#39;m sorry that ordering is taking away from your snapchat time, but you know...you do have a job to do. Third. The menu is painfully short, painfully bland, and just painful. I understand that this place is geared towards kids and that&#39;s a wonderful concept. But at least throw the adults a bone by having a more extensive menu.  And speaking of menu.....grass Fed beef, insert obligatory cheer and ooohs and ahhhs because people seem to think this is a godly idea that only this place has.

This is the newest location (just opened today) in the growing 2 Toot&#39;s restaurant family. It&#39;s located immediately across the street from the new Bartlett Train Station building and patrons get a great view of the passing Metra and freight trains. 

All the food is delivered to every table/bar seat via a train. My kids had an absolute blast and I think just about 90% of the people there were with kids. The menu is very limited (burgers, hotdogs, tuna salad sandwich, grilled cheese, etc.) Nothing fancy. I had the &#39;Cheese Car&#39; (cheeseburger) along with my wife and the kids had the chicken nuggets. The nuggets were typical quick fry fare, but were dino shaped, so the kids loved that. The fries were standard diner style fries, but were salted well and nicely crisp in on the outside, yet still soft/mushy on the inside. 

The beef is TallGrass beef, an organic grass-fed beef (no hormones, antibiotic) and the dogs are also the same, with no nitrites or nitrates, so people looking for a great diner with good, &#39;healthy&#39; organic beef, this is a good place to start. 

The deserts are rather limited (cupcakes, brownie or a rice crispy treat). My kids had the cupcakes and I had the brownie. The cupcakes were okay, but the brownie was good, with an amazing amount of chocolate frosting on top. All the deserts came with a toy train whistle for the kids.

 This place is pretty stellar. Standard diner food. The shakes are very good. 
The food is brought to the table by model trains on a track. However, every 5 minutes or so the train would derail so it would cause delays sometimes. 
 Also, to tame children from wanting the food train, they would give children their own locomotive to play with. Great idea in theory but they use Lionel trains and as a granddaughter of a model train enthusiast, I know how much those trains cost.

Adorable ambience for kids &amp; families. My three year old loved it. She also liked seeing the Metra outside the window. Only drawbacks were bad service and limited menu. Our waitress claimed that none of the servers were assigned to tables, and that if a person took your order, another beings food, another brings your check. As a result, we were neglected for most of our time here and we had to flag down people to help us. Upon asking a different server/ manager, he confirmed that our server SHOULD have taken care of us, and that she simply failed to do so. I wish I had gotten her name. No biggie. Just annoying having to gripe to a manager when you&#39;re trying to have a fun time with your kid. We ended up sitting so long that the oldies music and cute trains lost their luster for us. 
     Also, there was some man who worked there (the manager? Owner?) who just stood around and glowered at everybody. I smiled at him and he looked away without returning or even acknowledging my polite gesture. I&#39;m thinking that if that&#39;s the manager, he&#39;s the reason why the staff was walking on eggshells and not properly trained.
Maybe we&#39;ll go again and have a better experience with a better server :) I still recommend this as a good burger joint.",11/01/14,149,2,2,3,13,2.5523,2.7660000000000005,1.65,13.584000000000001,No,1348
2-toots-train-whistle-grill-bartlett-2,Jennifer G.,AgyQvzEftvbwGdQ8Qa1-2Q,lZ0BubGjfSecLelbW2Czxg,"This restaurant seems to be going downhill, and quickly.  The past 2 times we have gone  to 2 Toots, our experience has been less than satisfying.  Over the past year and a half, we have been to this restaurant countless times and always enjoyed it.  Recently, it seems to have changed quite a bit. I&#39;m not sure if there is new management, but things that we&#39;ve been able to do in the past are no longer allowed.  

For instance, we were there 2 weeks ago with friends, and asked to have separate checks.  It was no problem at all, and was very convenient.  We went back today with three different families, and it was no longer allowed, which made it a pain to separate. 

We were also told that it&#39;s against &#34;manager policy&#34; to tip the high chair upside down to support a baby carrier seat.  Again, we have done this countless times in the past 6 months with our infant at this very restaurant.  I have pictures of our baby in it.  

In addition, milk is no longer a free refill.  This is not a huge deal, but unfortunate for parents who prefer that their children drink milk over pop (which is a free refill).  

Our waitress was less than attentive and seemed clueless when it came to bringing out our order.  The last two times we&#39;ve been there, the order has been messed up, and it was due to the waitress putting it in wrong. This isn&#39;t rocket science.  It&#39;s a cheeseburger or grilled cheese.  

While these are not major disappointments, I would prefer to drive the 45 minutes to the Downer&#39;s Grove &#34;All Aboard Diner,&#34; if this is the service that we will continue to receive.  This is a children&#39;s restaurant and we are coming for the experience.

Red ropes that make you go in a certain way and cue are weird.  I&#39;m going to a diner, I should not have to be seated. The menu was sparse. They were touting Bill Curtis grass fed beef.  I like corn fed beef. I tried a hot dog and hamburger. The burger was fresh, but it was nondescript. The tomato, lettuce and pickle were on the side. Onions were provided in a plastic solo cup. The fries were not fresh cut, but rather a Sisco product. I get a hot dog, again with Bill Curtis being the Chicago guy and all.  The hot dog is a beef frank that comes on a bun.  You get it plain. If you want mustard, onions, relish, they give the onion solo cup again and food service packages of relish. I felt I could get the same hot dog from a vending machine, or a public museum. It was not a Chicago hot dog.

Our party consisted of 3 adults and 2 kids.  4 shakes (decent) 2 kids hot dogs, 3 burgers, 1 adult hot dog, 1 kids sundae, 5 soft drinks.  Bill was $65.00. 

The kids liked the train, the place is clean, staff was pleasant. Food was not great.
Make me a diner style burger, fry it up, have a little salt and pepper on it, have it dripping with juices. Offer up some grilled onions, or a fresh onion on it.  Make my hot dog with all the fixings.  Between the price and taste of the food, doubt if I&#39;ll be back soon.

I honestly didn&#39;t expect much fom a place that touts the meat products so I will give it a pass on the veggie burger so I being a recent transfer over to the no meat lifestyle decided to try a small piece of the burger( not- so- good) it was actually greasy with no real flavour aside cooked ground beef.  The place was a bit dirty under the table was not swept out nor the booth seats cleaned and the service was less than mediochre. I actually think the train was more attentive.

My daughter wanted a kids meal AND a bowl of soup. the soup is only sold as a full meal but the waitress gave her a 1/2 bowl free. I thought that was really generous.

Then you go inside.. still..not so hot. 
It looks pretty outdated, you can tell that there used to be a buffet of some sort before it was remodeled.

I just decided to order the cheesy Italian beef sandwich (on garlic bread) with fries. Simple enough. 
Right as I was going to get my drink an employee brought a dispenser of lemonade. Which, OF COURSE I had. The lemonade hit the spot (not sure if it was fresh squeezed though). The Italian beef was DA BOMB. I know you&#39;re thinking, &#34;Really Kara? How good can an Italian beef be?&#34;. But I&#39;m here to tell you the Italian beef here is the hidden treasure of Elgin. It&#39;s ranked up there with top Italian beefs I&#39;ve had. I didn&#39;t get it dipped or anything, but it was still juicy.
The one complaint I had is that they served it in a basket with that normal basket liner, and the beef was so juicy that the paper started to stick to the food. I was starting to wonder if the paper was edible or not. No big deal though, before it got bad I just asked for a to go container, transferred my food to that, and finished my food.

Service:
You order your food and you wait for your food to be ready. The staff smiles and are courteous to customers. A step above most fast food joints that don&#39;t even smile haha.

Atmosphere:
My least favorite part about this place is how much this place needs a remodeling or refurnishing. Don&#39;t take a date here, Do take some friends out here for group lunch. Even then, the seating arrangements with the tables are a tad awkward and uncomfortable. The decorations need fresh coats of paint. Having a Jester theme that looks like it is withering away makes for a kinda creepy atmosphere. I also get the quivers when seating and tables are unnaturally moist. 

Food:
I have tried a bunch of items on the menu for my tongue to reach a verdict. Considering the menu prices I feel that this place is on par with Portillo&#39;s with a much cheaper price tag. They do fast food right with their golden fries and tender meats. I haven&#39;t been disappointed by anything yet besides how flat or too strong the soda syrup is. Seriously guys, get on that! If you have never been to Portillo&#39;s, just know that the food is up there on standards. A couple of my favorites items are the Rotisserie Chicken and Hot Dogs. The Rotisserie chicken is much better than the ones you buy in Grocery Markets and come with so many side dishes. You have a variety of seasonings to choose from too! And this places Hot Dogs are up to par with Chicago&#39;s! I am not the biggest hot dog fan, but for $2 a hot dog, I&#39;ll bite.

My faves are the Chicken Ceasar Salad, which is to die for with lettuce, green peppers, hard boiled egg, bacon, homemade croutons, onion, mushrooms...its awesome and always freshly made. Although not your typical &#39;ceasar&#39; salad, its one of my fave salads anywhere. 
I also love their gyros (very authentic and they put the sauce in the gyro vs. giving it to you on the side, though i&#39;m sure you could ask for that) and they have Greek Fries (not on the menu) with fries, lemon juice and feta and oregano, freakin amazing.  My husband loves their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.Their fish sandwich is very good too. The soups are wonderful, homemade, go on a Tuesday for their lemon rice chicken soup, its just so delicious.

Time of my visit: Lunch

I chose this place because they offered Gyros.  The reviews on Yelp! were about as good as I would expect from a place like this one.

I arrived and was seated almost immediately.  The waitress came by very quickly and since I knew what I wanted, I placed my order right away.  I ordered Gyro and fries.

The first nice thing, I noticed, about the place was that they brought out a carafe of f water, made the water refills easier.

I did not have to wait long for my food to arrive.  It was a nice size plate.  Gyro looked big and there was plenty of fries.  Fries tasted average, nothing special, your typical fries.  The size of the Gyro was the pretty big, however, the taste was so so.  The meat was a bit more dry than I like, the pita was harsher than I like.  The amount of meat of the sandwich was a bit less than I anticipated.  I thought the price was a bit high as well $9.99 plus tax.

Overall a C-.  But I would like to come back and try their breakfast.

Side note: They don&#39;t accept AMEX, which is again a big pet peeve of mine.  At least there is a sign notifying customers of that.",14/11/16,147,3,2,3,24,2.1632,1.8659999999999997,0.686,16.448,No,1163

It took awhile to get a server and way too long for her to bring my coffee. She had a pretty big area that she was helping so after I figured that out, I cut her some slack.

We decided to go against the grain here and get some eggs. Hubby had an omelette with chorizo. He said it wasn&#39;t spicy enough. He likes his food very spicy, so maybe it was just medium chorizo.

I had the grecian omelette which had spinach, tomatoes and feta cheese. It was great! I had hash browns and a fruit cup. The hash browns were fresh and not overcooked and the fruit cup was a good size and all the fruit was nicely cup up. You know, some of those fruit cups just have big chunks of cantaloupe in them and not much else, but not here.

For a place that calls themselves a pancake house they have the smallest list of pancake offerings I&#39;ve ever seen. There are not even any pancakes in their specialty section. Owners obviously paid a marketing firm to come up with a great name. It just doesn&#39;t really describe the business. Better name for business, would be breakfast/lunch place. Hint: create a pancake offering on the menu with maple and berries. You could even put it in your specialities section. Crazy thinking, I know. 

The big signs in the front windows stating its a non smoking business looks cheap. Hello, this went into effect 10 years ago, pretty sure no one will be surprised at this point. Believe there were a couple other signs that had nothing to do with the food posted in the windows too. My first impression was one of those furniture stores offering 70% off for their going out of business sale, but I digress.

mapleberry-pancake-house-carol-stream,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,jyu9W_0MVapbR_HWAarHVA,"Mapleberry Pancake House is a place that was on my radar for a long long time. It&#39;s not particularly far from where I work, but by the time they&#39;re open in the morning I&#39;m usually hard at work and had been unable to stop in. I finally made the trip to visit after well over a year of having scoped the place out.

The first thing to note is that the building itself is actually a ways off of Army Trail. Signage is visible from this very busy street, but the restaurant itself is actually off of Kuhn road and you have to either make a left there or drive through a parking lot to reach it. Once I finally made my way there I stepped in to a fantastic smell of pancakes, from first impressions that appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. 

After thoroughly investigating the menu I settled on a Mexican skillet with pancakes. Placed my order and waited, the wait was around 20 minutes (about a time and a half what most places I order skillets at take) and there wasn&#39;t a lot of customers. This was just slow service. Now the question became was the food worth the wait?

I dug into my skillet immediately and there wasn&#39;t a lot of egg, there was a decent amount of cheese but the chorizo was a bit on the weak side in terms of spice and flavor. The potato used for hash brown at the bottom of the skillet was mostly soft potato mush, it wasn&#39;t very crisp and it wasn&#39;t very tasty. The overall taste of this skillet was bland, it was certainly decent sized but it was made up mostly of potato.

The pancakes were slightly better but not by much. The pancakes themselves were dressed with powdered sugar, and came with maple syrup. The syrup was fairly thick but had more of a bitter taste than a sweet taste. I wouldn&#39;t say the syrup was bad, just not to my general liking.

Overall I&#39;ve certainly been to worse breakfast places than Mapleberry Pancake House. My food wasn&#39;t exactly bad tasting, just bland. While service was polite and friendly it was also slow.

The girls at the front is the face of your business; the first everyone meets and the last your customers see. Being ignored, unwelcomed, and unthanked is not something we&#39;d continue give our business to. The service did however improve, but not enough to keep us. The customer service here should really step it up because the food is just not that great to keep people to come back. Unless of course you like fuzzy mold spots on your grapes and only one napkin to use (the one that your silverware is rolled in).

The restaurant itself is nice and open and bright.  It&#39;s a pretty big place, which is nice at those busy times.  Although it can be fairly loud, it&#39;s a not tooooo loud to have a conversation with my family.

The food is pretty good.  The first thing I tried, the golden french toast, was strange albeit edible.  It was an odd choice of ingredients to throw together on a plate, I didn&#39;t see it on the menu last time we were in, so maybe they realized it&#39;s not a great choice.  With that said, they still were able to pull it off and it was tasty.  My brother really likes their tamale and chili omelet.  

The service is always good.  No complaints there.  They never bug us but don&#39;t leave us waiting for them either. 

They have a huge sign in the window stating that their last tables are seated 15 minutes before closing time.  I don&#39;t really understand this theory, but, at least there is a sign letting you know.  So, while they close at 2:30, you need to be seated by 2:15 if you want to be served any food.

This was decent, but totally average.  We arrived to what appeared to be an extremely long wait.  Come to find out it was a large table waiting ot be sat together.  We were sat within 5 minutes.  Bonus...

The server was nice and brought out our own insulated pot of coffee for our table.  I have mixed feelings about this.  One... I&#39;m happy I have unlimited coffee but two, it is in a thermos and I&#39;m not really being waited on.  What the heck do you do with my coffee when I&#39;m done with it?  Serve the luke warm remnants to the next unsuspecting guest?

I ordered a denver skillet with a side order of buscuits and gravy.  The skillet was quite good.  The buscuits and gravy were marginal and had little to no sausage in the gravy.  It suspiciously tasted as if it were made from a packet despite the guarantee from the waitress that it was homemade.  Don&#39;t waste your side on this.. Get the pancakes.  

My husband ordered scrambled eggs, bacon hashbrowns and chocolate chip pancakes. A-OK in his book with the exception of his feeling the coffee tasted like water.  Perhaps he got someone else&#39;s left overs?

Last, I have to note the obnoxious sign as you enter the restaurant that they take their last walk in 15 minutes prior to closing?  Hey- here&#39;s a thought... Don&#39;t be ghetto and turn away business.  If someone wants to walk in 2 minutes to your 3:00PM closing time... SERVE THEM with a smile on your face or close earlier.

It was almost so close we&#39;d forget about it.  But then one day we went in.  There always seems to be pretty quick service even if it looks busy.
My one gripe is they don&#39;t really have a good place for a baby carseat.  Ok, I suppose they dont&#39; need to, but it&#39;s either bring the stroller and block the aisle or squeeze into a couple of the booths that will fit the carseat.  The area up top works, but sometimes it&#39;s closed when they are ramping down.
I like the healthy pancake combo, I forget what it is called.  But it&#39;s like some egg whites, multigrain pancakes and some splenda syrup.  Oh and turkey sausage.  I&#39;m happy they have turkey sausages.  Too many places only have pork.  That&#39;s fine, but I prefer turkey.

Not the case here. The Mapleberry Pancake House in Carol Stream was bustling with activity when I arrived on a late Sunday morning to satisfy my pancake craving. Families, cyclists, couples and singles all filled the airy restaurant.

The restaurant was fairly modern with light yellow ochre walls, tiled floor, and dark trim accents. The servers, primarily women, were all dressed in sleek black outfits with the word &#39;Mapleberry&#39; spelled out across the front of their shirts in eye catching bling (the fake rhinestone type). The bus staff, primarily men, wore black pants and yellow ochre shirts with &#39;Mapleberry&#39; embroidered in the pocket area.

I definitely wanted to try their pancakes, but I also wanted something more. It looked like their pancake orders didn&#39;t come with any sides. So I ordered one of the other specials on the menu which included eggs, two slices of bacon, one sausage link, pancakes, and juice. I asked if I could have blueberry pancakes instead of plain, to which my server said yes. The pancakes came with blueberry compote on top, but I was pleased to find that they also had fresh blueberries in the batter too.

Overall, the food was decent, prices were fair, service was okay, and bathroom was relatively clean. Definitely a family friendly place and worth a revisit to try other items on the menu.",07/03/10,180,3,2,3,23,2.9535,1.696,0.222,12.082,No,1462

mapleberry-pancake-house-carol-stream,Kim M.,VaDDhoa-IGKj3BMCHUxc4Q,MJMdYRJBJ-aE_PVTWLmXig,"We used to frequent the Mapleberry almost weekly after it first opened. They had good service, and a huge variety of food - and it was not overly expensive. 

Times have changed now, and if we&#39;re going to go out for a meal that costs a good amount, I expect the service to be - at a minimum - consistent.

We now rarely go to the Mapleberry for a couple of reasons. The first is, that their service is not consistent. They have one consistent server there, Sarah - and she&#39;s so popular that if you don&#39;t get there super early, well, you can&#39;t request her as your server. One time she had an extra table open, and they would not seat us in her section. I don&#39;t know if it was because so many people requested her, or what. 

Every other server that we&#39;ve had there has forgotten things, ordered things incorrectly, or even just trying to get them over to your table to refill a soda is a challenge in itself. They also do not check back often to see if you are doing ok.

The food and the cost. When we started going there I loved that they had an option for Whole Grain pancakes and turkey sausage. That was, until they raised the price of it by a couple of bucks. I know the economy is part of the drive with this...but there&#39;s no rhyme or reason to their price hikes at all, and they offer coupons in a couple of sources, but they aren&#39;t worth much -- and are only good during the week. 

We haven&#39;t been there in months, so in regard to the sizes of the servings shrinking, I can&#39;t really comment.

All in all, if you feel like splurging for a breakfast, and willing to take a chance on the service - go to the Mapleberry. Otherwise, you&#39;ll save about $30 alone just making it at your own house.",05/03/09,171,2,1,4,-29,3.3409999999999997,1.3689999999999998,0.355,14.276000000000002,No,1742

Problem is that the front area is small and congested where the hostess was taking people&#39;s payments and names down for tables.  Not a good idea if you are trying to keep the line moving.  

The service was definitely slower than normal and I have been to this pancake house a few other times.  The waitress was slow with bringing our food out.  Other tables received their food before I did and I placed my order way before they even got there.  Then the food was cold.  It seemed that the food sat out under a warmer b/c my omlette was slightly cold and the hash browns were cold.  

I&#39;ve eaten here before and was happier than this visit.  My friend and I asked for a take home box and separate checks.  Our waitress comes back to our table 5 minutes later with the checks separated but no boxes.  This woman needs to work on effiiency. The food was enjoyable, but I wish it was warmer.

Skip the french toast, it&#39;s boring and plain. For some reason, I like the hash browns more when I&#39;m dining in, rather when I&#39;m taking out because it doesn&#39;t seem so burnt when I&#39;m dining in.

I&#39;ve had the omelettes, they&#39;re pretty good but they&#39;re shaped like footballs for some reason? The large sausage links are pretty big, 3 is enough for a meal. The benedicts are really good, I like the hollandaise sauce they use, and i think they sprinkle some paprika on top. 

They always have a breakfast special menu, and the portions are pretty big for the price, so I always go for that!

A lot of the complaints I&#39;m reading about is the service... I understand it&#39;s frustrating to have to wait for food when you&#39;re hungry, but you have to expect this anywhere you go on the weekend. On Sundays, especially, when everyone is out of church. I think it&#39;s a GOOD sign when a breakfast restaurant is packed. And, they keep a large coffee carafe out on a table with cream and sugar for patrons waiting- so they DO realize it isn&#39;t fun to wait.

And, if you don&#39;t feel like waiting on a weekend, then go ahead and place an order to go.

mapleberry-pancake-house-carol-stream,Sean K.,LakRXm_g4c3f3zddCGuaiQ,HRwsc5HD9Pt7p2eRCLODGQ,"We&#39;ve been going to Mapleberry since it opened, having gone to Springdale mostly prior to that. Mapleberry&#39;s atmosphere is nice and open on the west side with big windows, but the east side feels crowded and not nearly as nice. So we always hope to be seated in the nice open area. Our food has usually been very good, and service decent.
One major complaint I have personally is as follows: Once, my wife and I went in for breakfast, but we weren&#39;t exremely hungry so we decided to split a breakfast between us. When we ordered the meal and told the waitress we wanted to split it, she told us there was an additional $1 charge for that!!! What?! We should have gotten up and left, but it didn&#39;t settle on us what had just happened until we had already agreed. And then... when the food came out it was not even split up onto two plates! What did we pay the extra $1 for?? A penalty for not ordering two separate breakfasts? So what if some couple with just enough money for a breakfast for 1 came in to enjoy a morning out together by splitting a meal, and they encountered that attitude? I think of my wife&#39;s immigrant parents whey they were young and new in this country and didn&#39;t have much money.  Not sure if it was the restaurant&#39;s policy or just the whim of the waitress (tall, older, slim lady with straight black hair who has always had a less congenial disposition than the others anyway). At any rate it really turned me off Mapleberry for a while. I even thought of writing the local newspaper about it, but did not. We&#39;ve been back a couple times since then but not as frequently.
Also, my wife feels like even though we&#39;ve been going there for years the staff has never acted like they know us in any way, or welcomed us back as people whom they recognize at all. Not a big deal to me, but it is to my wife.",05/11/11,201,3,2,3,25,2.7045999999999997,1.297,0.6430000000000001,17.06,No,1859

mapleberry-pancake-house-carol-stream,John A.,sXT8l6F-SJR-0JcgoM7i9A,suzrS4s9vCXcxzuNuxFtjQ,"After Nest Cafe closed, I wanted to find a local place for breakfast. I&#39;ve eaten here 20-30 times, and overall I&#39;d say it&#39;s OK, but I&#39;ve decided to stop going and find another place. The food is decent and usually very well cooked.  The eggs they use are probably the smallest commercially available. The bacon is thin cut, not thick.(Strike One) The point here is that they still give you two eggs and three pieces of bacon, but they make more profit.   The service is pretty good and can depend on the server. A few of the servers are very nice, but most are not very friendly, but more business like. During the week there&#39;s no wait, but on the weekends, after 9:00 AM there can be  a 15-30 minute wait. They don&#39;t give customers access to their wifi there.... They have it but wont provide the password.(Strike Two). The room is very plain and uninviting. They don&#39;t have many booths and they have a lot of two tops. The two tops are narrow and they only have a foot or so between them....tough to get out and it&#39;s hard not to put a butt in the person sitting next to you&#39;s face when getting in and out...very cramped...again trying to fit more in to make a profit and less about giving the customer a good experience. 

The last straw and third strike came when after having patronized them for a few months and many visits, I made a simple request to the blonde woman who runs the place. It was actually a request for a 4 top booth by the window at a very uncrowded time. It was the type of thing that I never had to ask for at Nest Cafe or many other customer friendly places. She got this pissed off look and really tried to force me to sit where they normally put me. So that was it for me...for her, it&#39;s clearly about her, her profit and how she wants to run the place.... And it&#39;s not about the customer.  So today, I&#39;ve found a new place in Bartlett...The Savory Restaurant on West Bartlett Road.... Where I&#39;m currently typing this review after eating a great breakfast, with much larger eggs, thick cut bacon, wireless service (where the hostess eagerly gave me the password), a very nice room, a server who was very interested in how I was doing...several times during my meal in fact she came back to see how I was doing and they don&#39;t have any two tops, where they gladly sat me in a four top on a crowded Sunday and I had plenty of room to stretch out and didn&#39;t have stick my butt in someone&#39;s face getting in and out and where the person next to me didn&#39;t have to return the favor.

In a heads up comparison it&#39;s a no brainer. If you like Mappleberry, you&#39;ll probably love Savory, as it&#39;s my new breakfast place in town.",18/09/11,287,2,2,5,42,4.614600000000001,2.4930000000000003,1.195,18.309999999999995,No,2720

Service was ok.  Had to wait about 10 minutes before I went up and asked the waitress for a take home box before we headed towards the front to pay the bill.  I dont appreciate these diners where you have to go to the front to pay your bill.  If the owner doesnt trust the tramps walking around taking orders with money he shouldnt of hired them!

She got a better job. We still went there as it is close but it just went downhill. The nail in the coffin for them, from us, was over the biscuits and gravy. The gravy, particularly. It tasted as if the milk had gone bad. This was our son&#39;s meal. We of course told our server who sent the owner over. (Plastic looking woman.) Simple problem, really. This woman however, took it so personally that he did not &#34;like&#34; the biscuits and gravy. ITS HER OWN PERSONAL RECIPE, HOW COULD WE NOT LIKE IT?! ~ which was not the issue. The issue was that the ingredients were bad. Rotten milk is rotten milk, if someone tells you this to your face rather than the health department, listen. She argued with us about this issue pretty intensely and the conversation ended when realized that we were going to pay for the 2 bites taken because she simply was not taking it off the bill, period. Yes, she made us pay the percentage of what we ate. And we shared our small portions with our son because he refused to order anything else. This calculating woman. Wow.

When we got there, right away we could tell the waitress had an attitude, seems like she had already checked out.  We were seated with no silverware and ended up getting our own off another table.

August 27 two of us chose Aliano&#39;s.  We knew this was a new restaurant in a location off of the beaten path in East Dundee.

I was coaxed into going after putting this off for a least two months.

Jimmy was the server.  He is so perfect for working with us...actually..me.
My wife was the promoter of the visit.  I had just return to the city after 7 hours of travel.  Really not excited about going out, but I live In Sleepy Hollow and East Dundee is a quick trip.

Walking in about 4pm, there was a table of 6 seated and enjoying the appetizers and drinks.  Looking over the tables, Jimmy said seat yourself, except at the Reserved tables.  There were many reserved....I was impressed.

I noticed in one Yelp review that a person said &#34;it is a bit pricey&#34;.  I first looked through the menu and told my wife it is on the high side for dollars.  After about 5 minutes reviewing the menu and each item, I told her that this is normal for  mid priced restaurant. The choices are extensive and the prices are on target with any other great restaurant. 

We go to dinner in restaurants at least 3 nights each week.  This one really hits the price points, because the serving are more than generous and absolutely delicious.  We each ate half of our servings...and of course the remaining went home for the next day.  Additionally, we took home two chocolate deserts which absolutely hit the moon for chocolate and taste.

The menu offering is extensive.  We had tortellini with prosciutto and peas,

To die for meat lasagna.  Oh, that was after an appetizer of Aliano&#39;s calamari.

They offer three different calamari choices..  

You really need to do yourself a favor............go and love the flavors.",31/08/16,199,5,1,4,-15,3.3373999999999997,2.193,0.513,21.294,No,1786

First of all, I called to request a table and told them we were 2. They reserved a huge front table for 5 for me. And left people at the bar who had been waiting. No one sat us, and no one came with menus or anything for a long time. Drink orders placed and still no menus. Told us he was bringing bread, never did. Toasted ravioli was thick and dry and tasteless. Salad was good, soup ok. Tomato sauce on chicken parmigiana was awful - sweet and pasty way too thick. Like Prego. Chicken Piccata was not floured, and was in a greasy sauce. Also, the chicken breasts tasted like they were those frozen kind full of a solution. Almost rubbery but more mushy.

Husband had the Queen of West Dundee - a 14 oz steak in Cognac sauce. The steak was a good size, and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. The fat had a nice crispy edge, but it wasn&#39;t dry. Little fattier cut than he normally would have liked, but he didn&#39;t even mind. The sauce is amazing. The asparagus was crisp and delicious. The potatoes were great. 

The manicotti was al dente, which is something of a miracle in &#34;Italian&#34; restaurants around here. The sauce was perfect. All the comforts of home. 

The pizza is a proper thin crust. Beautiful red sauce. 

And the tiramisu is huge, consider yourself warned. But it&#39;s flavor matches it&#39;s girth. Husband usually doesn&#39;t like tiramisu, but he ate half of this one, easy. 

We sat outside, but the interior looked cozy when I stuck my head outside. 

It&#39;s not a cheap meal, but it&#39;s deserving of the price tag.",22/05/16,122,4,2,5,29,5.653,5.041,0.75,13.209999999999999,No,1013
alianos-ristorante-east-dundee,Julie P.,rj6PMDtzp0X4qNjwhI1UYw,fGxQSni7DPtRwgjxF59zOQ,"I am not one of those fad dieters who jumps on the bandwagon of various food trends to lose weight. Instead, I, for medical reasons crucial to my health and well being, need to avoid all foods with gluten, which makes going out to eat not always fun. It is especially hard to find a variety of menu items, much less excellent ones.  

  I went to Aliano&#39;s the other night as a friend recommended it and I noticed they had a really large selection of menu items I could order gluten free.  Decided this would be a nice place to try to celebrate my hubby and I&#39;s anniversary and to bring my parents along to thank them for their help watching our stuff while we were out of town.

What a great decision coming here proved to be!  While somewhat small, with smaller tables and quite the crowd, I had no problems getting a reservation and we were comfortable all evening.  I  had a multitude of items I could order that could be prepared without any gluten, and the wine list was extensive.

I ended up getting the Veal Saltimbocca, which was to die for. It featured tender thinly sliced veal sauteed in a lemon butter sauce with spinach, prosciutto, and mozz cheese, accompanied by gluten free rigatoni.  The rest of my party had no special dietary needs and were in heaven with so many choices. My husband enjoyed the baked Manicotti, and my parents had the pork chop with mushroom risotto, and the lasagna.  The portions were generous ( I took home a nice doggy bag)  and we all had a very great meal. We topped of the evening with gelato and sorbet as we savored our last moments.  It is a bit pricey here, but well worth it.

Interior or exterior dining, both spaces are inviting and cozy. The food was excellent, although I felt a tiny bit high priced for some of the items. I&#39;m thinking in particular to the really outstanding grilled calamari appetizer, excellent, but small portion size. 
Ordered one of the pizzas and was not disappointed, it was very good and I would consider myself a pizza snob. My only complaint is that the kitchen seemed slow the Sunday evening we were there...there were only a few couples dining inside and out, yet there were long pauses between our courses and sadly our attentive waitress disappeared when we needed our check.

I ordered the baked mostacholli (not sure on spelling) and I wasn&#39;t disappointed! It had chunks of meat in a very flavorful marinara sauce and a gigantic meatball to top it all off. It also had what I believe to be ricotta cheese in the sauce which really gave the sauce a distinct flavor.

I had brought in 17 people to the restaurant with in 2 weeks. A reservation for 8, then a reservation for 9. I left a email with the restaurant the morning after the dinner for 9, and never heard back from the restaurant about our bad service. Drinks not refilled, including wine by the bottle. We sat with empty glasses and had to ask for more wine, water glasses not refilled, even after seeing the staff come out with 2 pitchers of water, fill the table behind ours and not come to our table. Leaving dishes on the table even after we were finished with our courses. Several staff walked by time and time again leaving dirty dishes on the table. We had to pile them up or point them out in order for the dirty dishes to be removed. It was uncomfortably warm because the door opens every 30 seconds because of the tables outside on the patio. And one of the busing staff smelled strongly of weed. I tried to email the restaurant and not leave a review on Yelp, but they didn&#39;t bother to return my email. The dinner came to $50 a person.

The food was delicious. Can&#39;t complain about the food.",28/09/16,122,2,1,0,-29,-0.8609,1.35,0.9039999999999999,11.745999999999999,No,1175

I will start with mine. Now I don&#39;t believe I have had a lasagna that I didn&#39;t like, I can say that there are only one or two times where I felt that I had the best lasagna ever.  The last time I said this it was at Giordano&#39;s interestingly enough and since that time they haven&#39;t been able to replicate it.  The lasagna I had from Aliano&#39;s was by far the best I have had.  The meat had a very good flavor to it, there was a decent amount of cheese and sauce but not to the point where it was too much where it ruins the meal. The slice of lasagna held its form together. Excellent and can&#39;t wait to try it again.

My wife allowed me to taste the Rigatoni she ordered. This dish has Italian sausage and a tomato basil cream sauce.  The sauce really made the dish.  I almost liked it more than my lasagna.  

When I ordered it was later in the evening on a Sunday.  The meal was ready in 10 minutes.  The manager, Hugo was very friendly and spent a few minutes with me talking about the restaurant.  I mentioned to him we were going to try over the weekend but my four year old son has a dairy allergy and we didn&#39;t see options on the menu for him.

I ordered eggplant parmigiana which the waiter said was excellent. It was far from excellent not even edible, very thick pieces (3) that when I cut into it was like a sponge, sauce was awful so the little bit of penne that came with it wasn&#39;t very good. The kicker was the waiter came back and asked me how I liked it as he could see I wasn&#39;t eating it and I was honest. I told him I didn&#39;t care for it and he should not recommend this dish. He just walked away from our table never offered a replacement dish or even a refill on my drink. And then to add insult to injury we paid the bill and that dish was still on it. I couldn&#39;t believe that they didn&#39;t even address this.

My boyfriend got gnocchi, about $15 for 15 gnocchi with no meat, although I tasted his sauce and it was good.

We love the East Dundee area and all the local offerings so when something new comes to town, supporting that local business is a main objective.  And luckily for us, this place is wonderful!  The place is small but it has a quaint cozy feel.  In the warmer months they will have outdoors seating which is a huge plus as patio drinking is my hobby haha.  We ordered the pinot noir which was fairly good-not the best but certainly not the worst.  We ordered the Goat Cheese Bruschetta as an app and it was so so SO good!  4 pieces in this unique take on an Italian classic!  Highly recommend!  We ordered the wedge salad which was pretty standard and then we shared the Chicken Saltimbocca and Cavatelli Aliano with Arrabbiata sauce (packs a decent spice if you like it hot). Both are very delicious!  The pasta wasn&#39;t quite cooked enough with the Cavatelli but being a new restaurant and working through the kinks I&#39;m hardly going to knock them for it.  We got two cappuccinos, their HOMEMADE limoncello and a piece 5 layer chocolate cake.  All the dishes were very well executed in presentation and taste.  Our server was Hugo-a well spoken, knowledgeable gem!  Service was very attentive although it was just us and three other tables but I am sure there would be no issue in a packed scenario.  Adam-the bus boy-was polite and attentive as well!  It was nice to meet the employees and owner and become familiar with what I hope will be an East Dundee staple.

It&#39;s nicely seasoned and juicy. Also, their prices are quite reasonable. Three tacos for under $9.00 with rice and beans is more than fair. 

That said, nothing else really thrilled me here. The salsa was straight liquid, almost like soup. The chips tasted a little bit stale, they just didn&#39;t have that love in them. Also, I didn&#39;t care for the marinade on the chicken. And my Coke was watered down.

It was huge first of all and actually pretty delicious!  I&#39;ve had problems with finding good Mexican restaurants in my local area lately so I thought I pass this place almost every day let me try it.  I ordered it at 10p and by 10:15p when I came to pick the burrito up its was done as promised.  I ordered mine with sour cream and guacamole  and loved it.  The chicken was cubed as opposed to shredded which I prefer, but it was still delicious!  The burrito was so big I had it for lunch and dinner again.  $10 for a giant burrito seems a bit much but again it was good.  The place was crowded for it being 10p so I assume they must be good.  I will come back here to try more of their food.  

Now for the one down fall that I saw when I  was waiting in line to pick up my food.  Ugh, a waitress put a basket of chips on a serving tray, took a chip from the basket and ate it.  The waitress proceeded to fill the tray with salsa from the fridge and the customers drinks.  I watched her walk the tray over and place everything on the patrons table.

I came here with two co-workers for lunch on Thursday. I&#39;ve frequented the Los Burritos Tapatios in Glen Ellyn, but I&#39;m not sure if and how the burritos mexicanos/tapatios are even related to each other. They all offer similar fare: authentic and quick Mexican.

They have your standard tacos, burritos, and tortas. They have some breakfast dishes as well as some specialties such as enchiladas and fajitas. Similar to many Mexican joints, they offer free chips and salsa for each table. You order at the counter if you are getting it to go, but you take a seat and are waited on if you dine in.

After a quick glance at the menu, I decided I was pretty hungry and I ordered the chicken fajita dinner, which came with rice and beans.

The food came out very quickly, but unfortunately, our waitress was MIA after that. My fajitas were good: lots of onions, tomatoes, and peppers, and a good amount of chicken, too. I wanted more water and more of the salsa that came with the chips, but alas, the waitress never showed up. The place wasn&#39;t super crowded, either. They even had two waitresses but they were super slow. Oh well... Also, I ordered corn tortillas with my fajitas and I believe I got flour (they were white; I&#39;m not saying they weren&#39;t corn but more commonly I see a yellowish hue with corn tortillas; could be way off here).

My coworkers got burritos and they seemed satisfied. I wasn&#39;t amazed by anything with my meal; the food was 4 star but the service and price (13.50 for my plate; no drink included) was 2.5 star-ish.

I won&#39;t be rushing back here but I won&#39;t actively avoid it, either.",20/06/15,205,3,2,0,26,-0.11599999999999992,1.661,1.565,14.773000000000003,No,1753

Luckily, I can now feel closer to home as I discovered another Los Burritos Mexicanos location right off 64 and Randall Rd. I say &#34;closer to home&#34; because I frequent the one closer to me in Villa Park quite often. I&#39;ve taken a liking to the chains authentic, friendly and fast service.

I ordered my usual steak burrito, and it was just as good, if not better than the ones I&#39;m familiar with in VP. Something about the steak tasted fresher. Another one of my favorite things about Los Burritos are the salsas. Somethings about the red and green salsa here absolutely rocks my world. Flavorful with the right amount of kick, is how I best describe them. 

My suggestion to people all you people in St. Charles that know nothing about Mexican food outside of Chipotle, put down that $9 &#34;burrito&#34; with rice in it and head on over to Los Burritos Mexicans for some cheap authentic Mexican fare.

Wrong!  Our food came out about 3 minutes after we ordered it.  Fast and speedy, ok, that&#39;s great.  But when the food tasted as barely mediocre as it did, it makes me wonder if they plated it and then microwaved it.  My enchilada dinner was barely luke warm.  

Most Mexican restaurant dishes taste very similar, no matter which restaurant you go to.  But this food was noticeably different and in a negative way.  The edges of the tortilla were so overdone that I had a hard time chewing it.  A flour tortilla!  It wasn&#39;t even crispy... more like hard and chewy.  

My husband&#39;s burrito had so much water in it, it was leaking all over the place but more so, made for a nasty soggy burrito.  Drain. your. chicken. people.

The salsa here is alright; their chips, however, are nice and tasty. 

Service at Los Burritos Mexicanos is a little spotty. If you don&#39;t know to grab a table without prompting or that you have to pay up at the register, you won&#39;t really be told that. The wait staff isn&#39;t very attentive either -- I can&#39;t imagine what it would be like if the place were packed.

Parking can be an issue here too. They have a very small, private lot and there&#39;s no street or adjacent, alternative parking. My first attempt to come here was unsuccessful because I couldn&#39;t find a spot.

I can&#39;t believe all of the good reviews of this place. 

First of all, the woman at the takeout counter had a very difficult time taking my order. I ordered 2 chorizo burritos, 1 bean and cheese burrito (which she didn&#39;t understand. I thought that was pretty straight forward) and a large horchata. It probably took a good 10 minutes for her to get my order straight. She was going to charge me full price for a bean and cheese burrito which is not standard and a bit ridiculous, so I ended up scratching that. 

The chorizo was NOT good. I&#39;m really not too picky. I might complain, but 9.5 times out of 10 I will at least eat it. I couldn&#39;t even finish this burrito, to be honest. The chorizo just tasted like heavily salted ground beef. It was bland and overwhelmingly salty. My mom, who used to love this place, agreed that it was just bad. 

I also don&#39;t understand why the burritos are $6, when most of the filling is lettuce, beans and tomatoes. I didn&#39;t get chips or anything. Maybe Chicago suburbanites are okay with this, but let me tell you--- incredible Mexican food exists, and this isn&#39;t it.

+2 stars because the horchata was awesome and because my mom says it is usually good.",18/04/12,156,2,1,4,-14,3.0147000000000004,2.6900000000000004,1.3539999999999999,14.956,No,1417

There were several woman working there just talking and did not check up on me and my friends when we were eating. We were all out of drinks and I had to ask to get refills. When we finished our meal we were not guided where to go after that. We eventually realized that you have to walk up to the register and tell them exactly what you eat in order to pay. They are quite disorganized.

Food: The chicken is slightly watery and greasy. The steak was delicious but they do not give you as much as the chicken (probably because it costs more for steak).
The portion sizes are good and I enjoyed the tacos and quesadillas. My friend loved the burritos; the regular size and giant burritos are both a good choice. If you are starving I would go for a giant burrito. The salsa that they give you is amazing!

Cleanliness: The bathrooms could use improving.. Otherwise I saw no big issues.

Overall: If the service was better: smiling, friendliness, continuously checking up on the customers, asking how the food is, and refilling drinks: then I would come back. The inside was quite chilly, the AC was cranked up high which is not a bad thing if it is not out. The seats were very comfy if you choose the booth.

Last time I went to Los, I had the vegetarian burrito since a friend had suggested it to me.  The server was really sweet and prices are fair, but the food itself left much to be desired.  The burrito was large, but only consisted of beans, lettuce, tomato and rice.  Now, even Qdoba throws in some grilled veggies!  This place is supposed to be authentic Mexican but the burrito lacked any flavor.  I was extremely disappointed both in the burrito itself and my friend for making such a terrible suggestion.  My bf prefers the burritos here to any other local spot, so it may just be the vegetarian burrito that sucks.  While on the topic of vegetarian dishes, they don&#39;t serve gorditas de rajas.  I love those and have found them to be a staple at most places since everywhere has the ingredients...but nope, no gordita for me.
The guacamole is a reasonable portion and fresh, but not my favorite.  It&#39;s very basic: avocado, cilantro, onion and lime.  The chips are good but not as crispy as I&#39;d like.  
I&#39;ve also had their Chile relleno, which was no great shakes.  Everything I&#39;ve tried here has been mediocre at best...except the horchata.  That was pretty good.  
They have great service, are always friendly and prompt, and are open til midnight on most nights (if not 1 a.m.), but Mexican restaurants are run of the mill in the Chicago burbs, and this one doesn&#39;t do anything for me.

My friend and I went there on 05/20/11.  This place is small compared to the restaurants we&#39;ve been to lately.  Once you walk in, it&#39;s almost feels like a semi-fast food semi-restaurant.  You just sit wherever you want (I asked the front before sitting) and wait for the waiter.  Ours came and she offered us drinks, which we chose cokes.  She asked us the size of drink we wanted, regular or large, and we chose large.  Let me tell you, large is LARGE!  The cup probably holds as much drink as an extra large from Taco Bell, if not larger!  Yeah, we were surprised but it was fine because we usually go through two glasses of drinks in other restaurants anyways.

Looking at the menu, they offered side items for the main meal besides having appetizers.  We decided to skip appetizers and just order the main course + 1 side.  I got the mixed Fajitas + 1 cheese quesadilla and my friend got a veggie burrito + 1 cheese quesadilla.  My friend was offered two sizes: regular or large.  The waiter told us that both were the same price, so the choice was large.  Here we go again xD  When our order came to the table, which was less than 10 minutes, he got a HUUGE burrito!  Even Chipotle&#39;s burrito had to bow before its mass!  (Keep in mind that this restaurant is more of a Traditional Mexican Food place)  My Fajitas were as expected, but it looked soo good.

The food was great.  The meats were cooked very good and the tortillas were great as well.  If I had to complain on something, it would be the average taste of the beans and rice...but they were still good.  My friend enjoyed his burrito, though he would&#39;ve preferred more veggies (he&#39;s always saying that :D ).  Now the quesadilla is just AMAZING while hot!  I was surprised how great it tasted, but once the cool settles in, it loses its luster...fair warning ;)  Both of us finished our meals this time.

After all that, the bill came out really cheap compared to the other restaurants we&#39;ve been to.  We might as well ditch any fast food places we go to and come here from now on...just a couple dollars different for better food (well, I still wouldn&#39;t leave Chipotle).  My friend was so shocked (in a good way) at the bill that he couldn&#39;t even laugh, even though he promised to xDD

In summary, this place is AWESOME!!  Great food, cheap prices, fast service...what else can you ask for?  I recommend everyone to try this place out if they get a chance...you&#39;ll love it here!",24/05/11,312,4,5,5,131,10.2574,5.086,0.526,22.388000000000005,No,2584

I had never been here before, so I was excited to try it out. Walked in and the music was going and people were dancing, which is great! It was pretty loud in there though, like, really loud. And it was empty on a Saturday night, not a great sign. 

We sat at the bar and pored over the drink menu. I saw they had shot-skis listed as a special and I figured since it was a birthday, I would order one for my friend. I asked the bartender for one and she said they don&#39;t have that.... Okay, so why is it on your menu? I hate when restaurants don&#39;t block things out or updated their menus when something is removed. Obviously, it is expensive to reprint, but take a Sharpie or something and cross it out or whatever. We ordered a round of Sweet Tart shots for our group and the bartender made them up pretty quickly. Those were great, tasted just like candy! We also had a round of shots that tasted like Jolly Ranchers, I don&#39;t remember what they were called, maybe they were Jolly Rancher shots! The shots were great, but the mixed drinks were just okay. I ordered the Snugg-A-Rita, and it was just okay. The birthday girl had a Long Island and it tasted terrible, like garbage water. She didn&#39;t want to return it, so she just drank a quarter of it and had a Coke. In a testament to how loud it was, one of my friends ordered a Corona from the bartender, and she made her a tequila shot. We were literally sitting at the bar, leaning over to talk to the bartender. If you can&#39;t hear the orders, the music is probably too loud. We tried to go dance, but the dance floor was very small, there were lots of tables in the way and people kept bumping into them. You could tell the patrons sitting at those tables were getting a little irritated. 

I think this bar has potential to be a suburban hotspot, but they are right next to Fox and Hound and just ten minutes from America&#39;s bar, both superior bar spots. Also, they are in a terrible location. If you didn&#39;t already know it was there, you would never find it. If they cleaned up a bit, it could be a great place! Also, the bartenders could be a little nicer. Like, I don&#39;t know if it was because we were all women, but they seemed almost bothered by our presence.

I don&#39;t know what in the world it was, but we left after just one drink. 

I noticed a few days later that they put a $50 charge on the card that I used to buy the one drink. I called to speak with a manager about it and after being hung up on and calling back, a woman explained to me that they always do that just in case someone walks out without paying. Shouldn&#39;t you warn people about this before you take their credit cards...? I mean, I only got one drink! It just seemed super sketchy, and the manager on the phone wasn&#39;t even the least bit apologetic. My friend got an overdraft fee for the $50 charge on her card so sorry but the explanation of &#34;it&#39;ll fall off your account in 4 days&#34; doesn&#39;t cut it.

Some things that stood out as different on the menu were the fajitas, broasted chicken, and fresh cut fries.  I was debating with one of my table mates that the fries here are 100x better than the fries at Finn&#39;s, because the&#39;re fresh cut and not that crinkle-cut frozen ish.

Well, this summer, we decided to give this place one more chance, and I am really glad we did!  The manager (who desperately tried to help with our service issue from last summer) actually remembered us when we returned and went as far as to make it up to us TWICE now.

He didn&#39;t need to do that, but he went out of his way to make it right.  That&#39;s what I call good customer service, because we have since been back a few times!

No less than six speakers died within a half hour. The bartender and manager kept working on it until early in the third we got a speaker that worked for the rest of the game. Major props for that. And I only got charged for one beer, despite drinking three. That was pretty outstanding by them.

We came in on a random evening 1/17/2013 (which if you notice the other reviews from the same evening it seems we all have similar gripes) kind of celebrating a small work related victory...

Right from the start the service was brutal. There were THREE bartenders behind the bar and we waited 20 minutes to order our first round of drinks and food, there couldn&#39;t have been more than 15 people in the entire bar at this point, so not OK.

The night went downhill from there...the girls behind the bar were either texting, talking, going out for breaks etc, getting their attention was impossible, drinks were delivered wrong or never delivered at all, the barback was actually tending bar for a while (he&#39;s awesome by the way) and at the end of the night we had a complete billing nightmare that is STILL going on one week later.

snuggery-schaumburg,Shannon H.,CaoBW2NhYVAhc8E1ZUhR8Q,s8qbx-JU815_8FhbKKqpzw,"My friends and I ended up here last fall for the Chicago Bears vs. Green Bay Packers game. We had tried to go to the Fox and Hound which is right down the street, but it was SO packed that we couldn&#39;t find seats! So I found this place on Yelp and we wandered over. 

From the moment we walked in I knew we made the right choice! We were greeted at the door by someone who was taking bets for the game and asked if we wanted to participate. We were able to find a seat right away, and our server promptly came over to take our drink order. During the entire three hours that we were there our server did a great job of making sure we had drinks and food and anything else that we needed without being disruptive. This was impressive because this place was packed, but it&#39;s not the reason that the Snuggery gets four stars...

OMG The stuffed mushroom caps are TO DIE FOR! Ever since I came here on that rainy day last fall I have been craving them! They stuff their mushroom tops with cream cheese and herbs and then deep fry them. They are huge, and they are beyond amazing! The other food we had there was good to, but nothing compared to the amazingness of the stuffed mushrooms! 

The snuggery is a sports bar. It is not a healthy eating kind of place. It is not the kind of place where one goes to sip wine. It is loud. It is filled with sports fans watching the game. They have pub grub for food, and your standard beers for drinks. However, I do love me a sports bar ESPECIALLY when one of my favorite teams is on, and the Snuggery is exactly what I need!",16/04/13,169,4,2,3,11,2.8141000000000003,1.638,0.52,16.842,No,1569

Our waitress was disappearing all night.  Good 20-30 minutes between getting a drink. Forgetting our food order, very simple appetizers. There are far too many bars and restaurants out there to go here. The very weak poured drinks didnt help either. Most of the employees that work in that bar have an attitude.

snuggery-schaumburg,Mary P.,qnPIKGdJlqIQWidoM1uDHA,Ihg-UX__Yfx34s3J3YzN6w,"The waitresses are sneaky! They take your order and they don&#39;t give you change. For example, a Bug Light bottle is $3.25. mmmk! I hand over $4 and the chick brings back my beer...no change thou. I decided, whatever that&#39;s fine I want to hang out w/ my friends.

I go to the bar next to order my second beer. SAME THING HAPPENS. I was immediatly ignored after I was handed my beer (same thing happened except this time I gave her a $5) OHK! Didn&#39;t know there was automatic gratuity! I asked for my change back and didn&#39;t give her a tip. I was really turned off. She could have turned on her acting skills and pretended like she forgot about my change. 

Anyway, the bathrrom has 2 stalls. Thank GOD there is no bathroom attendant. Oh God, those people are the worst. Do I really have to tip you?? And this place is pretty packed, which is a good thing but not really cause its basically like a square and the bar takes up like 75% of the place, leaving little space for customers. 

I had a bad experience getting a cab back to O&#39;Hare. The cab driver was pretending to hit on me. I asked him how much it would be and he&#39;s like ohhh I will give you a discount, blah blah you&#39;re so beautiful,blah blah PUKE!! He charged me $60 to get to O&#39;hare...Ohh a discount from $68. WOW! ANd he made me go to an ATM cause he said &#34;Oh if you use credit card I cant give u discount&#34;. 
I was in a mood and didn&#39;t feel like arguing over the fare. He was sketchy though. This will teach me a lesson to be extra careful if I have to take an expensive cab ride again. 

Place has no dance floor. People are young and lively. I dunno. Schaumberg bars don&#39;t really do it for me.",30/01/12,211,1,1,2,1,1.7104,3.7319999999999998,2.422,24.843999999999998,No,1702
snuggery-schaumburg,Phil S.,asP08n8OwVhIg2hyff8DFQ,XvlrcQojX1IL0sujomeWTw,"I tried to like this place since I can literally walk back home if I get drunk but alas, it was not meant to be.  I&#39;ve sat inside at a high top while watching a drunken office party get drunker with the shots the DJ was awarding for silly behavior, I&#39;ve sat at the bar and I&#39;ve sat outside on the patio. I&#39;d say trying to like this place 5 times is giving it way more than a fair chance.

Food: Crappy, frozen Sysco deep fried junk. Not that I expect much better from a bar but this place just looks nicer than that so I was disappointed. Everything from the fries, wonton wrapped mozzarella sticks (ew, do not try these), beer nuggets (even worse), burgers and their specialty.... broasted chicken. It all tastes mediocre to downright horrible. Even at bar food standards.

Drinks: They have specials but like a bloody mary with a sidecar of beer. I know, sounds weird but that&#39;s why I tried it. When I asked the waitress why I wasn&#39;t given my side of beer she told me that the bartenders always forget and if I really wanted it she would go back and force them to give her one. Really? *buzzer* NEXT! After that I just stuck to the cheapest draft beer they had. My wife said their margarita was way too sweet and just sucked in general.

Atmosphere: On weekend nights they have a DJ and he does a decent cheesy job of getting already drunk people to do more dumb drunk things so I guess that&#39;s entertaining. They have plenty of TV screens as well if you really need to watch the game. Personally, I&#39;m not one that really likes the douchebag crowd that comes in wearing a tank top, sagging jeans and a straight bill hat and you&#39;ll see plenty of this species come through here with their flava-flav chains hanging around their pasty white necks. If you don&#39;t like that either then definitely don&#39;t hang out here. 

One time while seated outside, the wait staff repeatedly ignored us for a good 15 mins. Thankfully I flagged down what looked like a manager (it was a busy night BTW) and he was very gracious and apologetic and bought our first round of drinks as compensation... or so we thought. When the check finally arrived, after we got sick of waiting eons for our next round of drinks, the waitress must&#39;ve counted the empty glasses on our table (they didn&#39;t even bother clearing those off, that&#39;s why the glasses were still there) to tally up our bill. I was so sick of waiting that I just paid the bill but didn&#39;t bother with a tip. In fact, I probably could&#39;ve just walked away and not even paid the bill and our waitress wouldn&#39;t have cared. That&#39;s how unconcerned they were with service.

Summary: Kinda like Fox and Hounds a couple blocks north except smaller. They have an outdoor area which is nice if the skeeters aren&#39;t out munching on your legs but other than that pretty much the same gimmick. Avoid unless you really must but between F&amp;H I&#39;d pick this place.",09/03/12,337,2,1,1,2,0.07119999999999982,2.807,3.3180000000000005,21.87400000000001,No,2961

The &#34;dance floor&#34; is just moved over tables to create a space. Not a lot of room. They do allow women to dance on the bar though, get free shots (which they randomy give out for doing things - pretty cool). The DJ is some old guy ( at least every time I&#39;ve been there it&#39;s the same guy) who needs to just stop.

They do have a large outside area, which maybe a part of the hotel that sits behind the bar, but it&#39;s pretty much as big as the bar itself. I do like that area.

There is also a 7-11 like 50 feet away which rules when you run out of cigarettes. 

The service in the bar is okay. When it&#39;s crowded it gets laggy. I really only like this bar when I&#39;m drunk because otherwise there really isn&#39;t anything special.

I am a husky guy, and my best friend, her husband, and I decided to come out for just a beer or two. Living in Portage Park, it was a drive, but we knew someone there. Upon our first drink, we simply got two beers and a cocktail. The waitress said she needed to replenish a bottle to fill the drink, which was fine. I stood there for approximately ten minutes, being ignored by the bartender. Finally I walked back to the table, and gave up. The person who wanted the drink went up to the bar and eventually got her drink. We enjoyed a few cocktails, then drove the husband back home. 

When we arrived back to the bar (had to pick something up), we ordered a beer, two shots, and a cocktail. After ordering, we realized it was near closing. We drank our cocktails, and at 20 minutes until closing attempted to order one more. The same bartender advised us they were done serving, and walked away before we could say anything. Upon walking away, she went to pour 10+ shots for another party. When confronted she told us that they were only serving shots. We ordered 2 shots, and closed. The price was extremely high, and the service was, to say the least, degrading. The bartender was hanging out with her friends and closing, without even recognizing us. 

The bar closed, the manager made things right, without even knowing we had an issue.

What I might suggest to the management is, re-structure the weekly food and drink specials, have karaoke nights or something unique once a week, and seriously work on your customer service.

Cliffs Notes: I wouldn&#39;t go here again. Ever.

The night I went, it happened to be raining(nearly pouring), so naturally I wore a jacket/zip-up hoodie type thing. I walked up to the door and the bouncers basically pushed me away and told me that nobody could have a hood on their clothing (mine was off my head since I was underneath an awning at this point). Uhm, okay...? I understand dress codes like having to wear shoes, shirts, pants, and hats that can&#39;t be on a certain way. That I understand. I could also understand not wearing the hood inside, after all, I have no reason to wear it, its not raining inside! Anyways, I walked back to my car, which happened to be in the far back lot past the 7-11 (the parking lot was packed). I finally got in, near soaked from walking in the rain without a jacket and hood, and I met up with some friends. They had a waitress that was serving them, but it took me over 45 minutes to get a drink. She was non-existent the majority of the night. So I finished my beer and was waiting to flag her down for another. Never saw her again the entire night. So I fought my way up to the bar and finally ordered another round.

The parking lot is tiny and also next to a hotel so parking it hard to come by. If you insist on coming here I recommend getting dropped off or just parking across the street. Inside the bar it was packed to say the least and the &#34;dance floor&#34; was pathetic. Since there is no room to move they let hot girls get up on the bar for free shots...WOOO how degrading and annoying.
I was determined not to return but after being bribed with free drinks I agreed to meet some friends there..only to confirm my dislike towards this bar. There was a loud siren that I don&#39;t remember from last time that seemed to go off every 5 minutes. When I asked someone why it went off they had no idea. Ugh. 
The only saving grace of this bar was the outdoor area which I didn&#39;t go to on my first visit. There are lots of tables and a few intimate areas with low couches which was nice. Bad part about the outdoor area was that there weren&#39;t any speakers so we only heard the dull bass of the music playing inside. Also there was NO service outside.

They have a nice outside area but it was a little chilly so I only got to see it from inside.

I was here this past Friday night, I was the DD so I wasn&#39;t drinking. To get a bartender to refill a coke was next to impossible, and came with an eye roll and snotty attitude. I was tipping with each drink and bartend as well. A sober driver should be encourage by establishments not feel uncomfortable.

The wings that were actually cooked close to crispy were wimpy and had hardly any meat.  Most of them were underdone and honestly turned my stomach, I left half of them with 1 bite taken out.  I would avoid this place and walk down to the 7/11 and eat a hot dog instead!",20/03/12,76,1,1,1,-6,0.5032000000000001,0.76,0.537,5.701,No,656

Instead of utilizing the full view of the river from inside, they decided to place flat screen TVs over the windows, causing the inside to feel claustrophobic. Additionally, the menu was revamped, replacing food that used to be decent with mediocre food choices.

It seemed like it would be fun. The crowd was very diverse. The service was standard. It was nothing special but not bad either. We got to sit quickly and service was prompt. The bar was loud, but as it was a sports bar, that makes sense. I left feeling very satisfied. They also offer a shuttle service.

I should have known from the get-go that that this wasn&#39;t going to work out gwell.  I called around 6 PM.  I told the girl that answered the phone that I wanted to place and order for carryout. She put me on hold for a couple of minutes.  A different girl picked up the phone and I said I wanted place an order and she put me back on hold for a few more minutes.  When she picked up the phone again I told her that I wanted to order a dozen buffalo wings with bleu cheese.  She asked me what sauce and I said medium--but I asked if it had a kick to it.  She suggested the Captain Morgan Rum Sauce would probably be good if I like a little spice.  I said okay-to which she replied it would be about 30-45 minutes because they had a huge party they were cooking for.  After hesitating I agreed. When I got there I expected the place to be full but really there was one larger group at two tables and basically the whole place was maybe at 25% of their capacity and most of them were just drinking.    The host table was abandoned and most of the waitresses were engaged in conversation. After standing there like an idiot for a few minutes,  I went to the bar area and the bartender had someone bring the food out and she said the total was $10.  Apparently the food and bev tax is 20% because the wings were only $7.99 on the menu.  I don&#39;t care too much as I would have tipped them but I think they were just adding tips all along the way which just furthered added to my disgust.  It was an even $10 too-what are the chances!  To add fuel to the fire, I checked to make sure they put the sauce in the bag when I got to my car--and they put in a cup of ranch--which I hate.  Not to mention it was like the consistency of milk......the menu says it comes with bleu cheese....doesn&#39;t even mention ranch and I specifically requested bleu cheese.  I also did not like the sauce on the wings.  The chicken itself looked good--was meaty but the smell of the sauce and the taste was awful.  Some people probably like it--but it was not for me.  I maybe ate 3 of them.  My husband also complained that the smell was terrible.  I am sure I would have enjoyed them more with a more traditional sauce.  All in all--was not impressed.  The actual place looks nice--lots of TVs and good outdoor seating area but all in all a bad experience for a diner.

I loved their fries...some were crispy, some were soggy but all tasted really delicious. What I would love is if they added some sauces for the fries (a few creative options) to make them even better.

All hot dogs come wrapped with an order of french fries, bringing back memories of going to UIC and getting Maxwell&#39;s. 

Franchisee Dog - stuffed with cheese, wrapped in bacon, deep fried with BBQ sauce for $4.05. Now this was a good hot dog. The hot dog itself was great but the combination of everything else made it to die for. I&#39;ve never had a francheeze with BBQ sauce before or even deep fried and I thought both little changes lent themselves well to this dog.

Slaw Dog - hot dog topped with a ton of homemade coleslaw for $3.35. It really is a ton of coleslaw! So much! Another interesting dog I had to get because I&#39;ve had a lot of dogs in my days but nothing like this. I&#39;m not a big fan of coleslaw but felt like I had to order it the way everyone on Yelp was raving about it. I have to say - I get it. All the raving is justified.

You can make any hot dog a double for a dollar more or make it a combo &amp; get 2 hot dogs, fries and a medium pop.

I used to live in Berwyn and had easy access to the best hot dog, beef and pizza joints.  Haven&#39;t found anything truly comparable out here until now.  Just Hot Dogs has a classic chicago hot dog along with some specialty dogs. I&#39;m not the best person to rate a hot dog (I like a good dog just not enough to get excited), but the hubby was very happy and actually tried to convince me to go back the next day for more.  

I had the beef and it was great.  I will tell you all the things it was not: 
It was not too thick
It was not over cooked
It was not seriously over or under seasoned
It was not fatty, veiny, or grisly
It was not necessarily the &#34;perfect&#34; beef but it was really good and admittedly I have caught myself day dreaming about it more than once.  
For the super picky beef eater: the bread is good, not sure what kind but it&#39;s good.  Mozzarella was nice and melted. Giardiniera was mild. Did not try sweet peppers.

The fries: they are every bit of deliciousness that everyone has been saying.  Really.  I had so called &#34;fresh cut&#34; fries somewhere else the very next day and they were no where near as good as the beautiful fried loved I was served at Just Hot Dogs. 

No service issues during our visit. Its really laid back. Typical walk up, place your order and wait to be called.

As is, I have been a couple times now and have tried out a couple of their dogs, and they are pretty darn good.  I love the variety of dogs that they have.  14 different types, spanning the nation, to meet peoples needs.

Because they are called &#34;Just Hot Dogs&#34;, I did find it a bit weird that they have a full menu of other things (Italian Beef, Sausage, Meatball Sandwiches, Pizza Puffs, Tamales, etc).  To date, I have gone with the Cheese dog, Chili Cheese, Franchisee, and Chicago Style (for comparison reasons).  Each are good in their own way.  While I would still prefer a Chicago Style from Gene &amp; Judes or Nana&#39;s, this was very good and would rank just a shade behind the others.  Because of proximity though, I would more likely go here than to G&amp;J.  Fries are excellent.  Love the fresh cut fries that most hot dog places are doing now.  Makes a huge difference, in my opinion.

Old and tasted like garbage. The hot dog &#34;meat&#34; itself tasted old. Like it was sitting in boiling water for hours and hours before I had come in.  They probably made it in the morning before their first customer (me) showed up at 7 PM.  I&#39;m just praying now I don&#39;t get sick after taking a few bites into that atrocity. I&#39;m very easily pleased and never have left a review before but I feel so cheated I just had to.

While I was there and waiting for my 3 hot dogs for me and my family, I overheard a conversation from the 2 male teenagers working, who apparently, are in charge at this time of night. It involved waiting to clean the fryer until tomorrow, because they think it should be ok. The conversation then progressed into a much more personal area, right in front of me. Apparently, there is drama going on where one guy is mad that the teenager sweeping the floor, is friends with 2 girls even though one of them hates him and cheated on him. The two also talked about how one of their friends would certainly do horrible things behind each others back. He didn&#39;t respect &#34;bro code&#34;. I was the only one in the restaurant (obviously after tasting their horrible food) and could clearly hear these two teen males talk about their sex life and their friends. Never have I felt so cheated out of my $10. Avoid at all costs.

I edited this review just to add that my wife took one bite and almost vomited because the onions and tiny skinny hot dogs were so bad. At this point we are hoping no one gets sick. I also threw away all of the food. During the holidays, $10 is a lot to just trash while you are out and about looking for Christmas presents. The fries and hot dogs were the worst. I&#39;m very easily satisfied usually, but I feel like my health was actually threatened by this horrible food.",22/12/15,265,1,1,-2,-50,-2.0029000000000003,2.1790000000000003,3.0700000000000003,23.749999999999996,No,2394

just-hot-dogs-and-more-carpentersville,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,Dq-UsNs3-Rg49M0EtZ6Tuw,"In driving through Carpentersville a friend of mine wanted to take me to a hot dog stand he had seen so I could give it a try, and a review. As we approved the restaurant a fairly commonly found statue of a giant hot dog applying ketchup to himself so no one would want to eat him was visible right in front. Soon after I walked in I discovered that the name &#34;Just Hot Dogs&#34; is a lie as they have fries, Italian beef sandwiches and tamales. I placed my order for a hot dog and fries and within a few minutes my food was ready.

The hot dog here came on a regular non-poppy seeded bun. The bun was well steamed, soft and just a little bit greasy. The sausage used was a natural casing dog that was heated very well. The relish and onion applied to the dog were perfect fits though the hot dog was a little light on mustard. I did not detect any celery salt on it, but it&#39;s possibly it could have been applied sparingly. The sport peppers were evenly applied through the length of the hot dog and a long and thick pickle and two large tomato slices were right next to it. The pickle was a little bit on the thick side and the tomato slices were a little too watery, but outside of that this was an excellent hot dog. 

The bigger star of the show here was the french fries. Normally when I see fresh cut fries I cringe. The reason being around 90% of the time the only way to salvage them is to add chilli, cheese or some combination of the two. These were some of the best tasting fresh cut fries I&#39;ve come across. Whatever they cook them in gives it more of a sweet taste than salty.

Overall I&#39;d say the hot dog is four stars here and the fries were five. Due to friendly service and a clean restaurant, I&#39;ll round up the score and give this place a five star rating and a recommendation.",09/12/13,208,5,2,5,24,5.0094,2.257,0.42,15.322999999999999,No,1813

Comparison to Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s is not hard to make, other than Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s does not have a tomato slice on their dogs and the fries are on top.  

The hot dogs are typical Chicago-style Vienna hot dogs.  The buns were soggy though and the sport peppers were tiny so points must be deducted for that. 

The fries were of the home cut variety and very good.   

The menu is spartan, and I was disappointed that a side of fries comes in only one size (large), yet a two dog special comes with a small fry.  In other words, they are capable of doing up a small order of fries, yet you cannot order one.

I thought the prices were a bit high for what you get and I was also disappointed with their policy requiring a $10 minimum order to use a credit/debit card.

He decided one day, that he was going to take me, since we both love trying new places around the area. And let me tell you, I am a loyal fan and customer....and here&#39;s why.

1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. To me, customer service fixes a lot of things about poor restaurants. And you&#39;ll be happy to know, neither disappoint here. The first time I walked in (and every single time since), I have been greeted at the door before I even reach the counter. They actually take the time to talk to you, so you don&#39;t feel rushed at all to order. Not like a place where they just keep the line moving without any personal customer connection. They have so many regulars, it&#39;s crazy....and they know them ALL by name, and what their order is.

2. Their food is great. I am a Chicago-style hotdog enthusiast, and I want you to relax because this place has got it down! Everything from the celery salt, to the pickle spear, and to the Vienna Beef dog, it is pure Chicago. They have a variety of other options as well like italian beef, pizza puffs, etc. But other than the dogs, their fries are to die for. Superbly hand cut fries with thick sea salt sprinkled on them, they are fried to a perfect, golden deliciousness. I could eat those things all day, and sure enough on several occasions, I have found myself craving them!!!

All in all, I would recommend this place (and I have to quite a few people) to anyone who loves a good classic Chicago-style dog and fries.

It&#39;s kind of funny, the sandwich board by the street says Just Hot Dogs, and then right below it, says Fresh cut fries.  I always see it and think, I thought it was just hot dogs?  Anyways........

All the people here are very friendly, and you can get your dog or polish regular or Chicago style.  regular has mustard ketchup onions and relish, Chicago adds a pickle and tomatoes, subtracts the ketchup.  they wrap the dogs with the fries a la Gene and Jude&#39;s.  They have a couple of tables outside on the sidewalk, so I ate out there.  Had to go back in for napkins because there were none in my bag.  So I unwrapped the Polish, and it&#39;s fried, not to a crisp, but to a crispy enough, i guess, it was done perfectly!  Got grilled onions mustard and ketchup, the grilled onions were sweet, not so overcooked that they have no give, slightly crunchy were those onions.  Now the fries.  These were some good fries.  They were great fries, some of the best fries I&#39;ve had in a long time!  Hand cut, crispy, and they taste like fries should; like fried potatoes with salt on them.  No gimmicks needed, no batter or weird BK covering, just potatoes, oil and salt.  

So come here and make sure you get the fries, anything else you get is at your discretion, but the fries, one way or another, need to be eaten by you!

I wish they could keep it as simple as Gene and Jude&#39;s. Menu is too cluttered and makes the customer think forever of what they want at this establishment. Take away chicago style or regular style. The reason I say this is because if you ask for it chicago style, they will put the fries in a separate bag and not on top of the hotdogs. Regular double dog style with fries on it--Perfect. 
Make the prices a little more affordable. 2 orders of Double Dogs with fries at Gene and Judes comes out to 6.20 exactly. Just Hot Dogs- Total comes out to 8 dollars and 40 some cents. Also when they are preparing the hotdogs with the fries on top. They are not consistent with pairing the right amount of fries on top of your double dog.

Crazy crab did not disappoint.  I split the crazy pot for $40 with a friend.  I also checked in on yelp to get 1 pound of crawfish for free.

Do the mix of all three flavors.  If you like spicy then get the insane level.  The insane level was spicy but not too spicy where you can&#39;t enjoy it.

Also tried the fried oysters which were okay but I probably wouldn&#39;t order them next time.  Cajun fries were also good.",17/10/16,63,4,1,0,-26,-0.010999999999999843,1.521,1.2309999999999999,6.248,No,546
crazy-crab-streamwood,Nancy L.,yzWz3gHekKx_SLcrvR_VfA,iC-CEZM3in0GCpMPyL0v0w,"Crazy crab was finger licking good.  Literally.  The combo of 3 sauces, the fresh and perfectly steamed shell fish...you can&#39;t help but want to lick your fingers and since this is the best (&amp; most likely only) way to eat this delectable seafood...you&#39;ll be licking yours too.

First things first.  Whatever seafood you choose, go the 3 way on sauce.  Don&#39;t settle for one, makes a huge difference and packs way more flavor.

Ordered 1lb each: Deveined headless shrimp, mussels and clams drenched in 3 way sauce: (highly recommend) Crazy Cajun, Lemon pepper &amp; Garlic butter.  Its a symphony of flavors. I chose med heat and probably could&#39;ve  went &#39;crazier&#39;...spicy but not overbearing.

Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly. Nothing was over cooked or dry.  Shrimp was delicious. Mussels were meaty - my two favorites and I&#39;d totally order this again. Clams were little neck and not as impressive as mussels but still good. Fried oysters were too heavily floured for me.  I like to taste more oyster and less breading, otherwise oysters were fresh and also meaty. Cajun onion rings had a nice spice and mild kick.  I could taste paprika, cayenne and cumin.  

Garlic noodles were no biggie and a pass next time.  Not flavorful.  Just noodles with oil/butter and some garlic. It needed more sauce, spice.  I don&#39;t know if they use their garlic butter sauce on this, but these noodles would be SO much better if they used all three sauces...huge difference in taste going the 3 way...have I mentioned 3 way?

We took our order to go and they did a phenomenal job wrapping up our seafood. Double bagged in plastic, tied and placed in container.  I purposely let this sit for a bit before diving in so our seafood could soak up more of the yummy juices. Interior is newer, clean and casual.  Server was super friendly.  

I&#39;m telling you, I could dip bread in this stuff, or add pasta to it .  I&#39;ll admit it is a little oily, but what do you expect? The oil didn&#39;t overpower all the other great flavors.  If you&#39;re sharing, 1 lb is enough for two or 3 to sample while trying other seafood.  They don&#39;t do 1/2 lbs fyi.

Our order was around $65.  No it isn&#39;t cheap, but the quality is present and they get their fish locally as well as from New Orleans.  Personally, I think its worth it and they have a great seafood selection - some of which is not listed on their website / menu.
Crazy pots filled with shrimp, crawfish, mussels, clams, Alaskan snow crabs, corn, potatoes, and sausage.

crazy-crab-streamwood,Misty H.,QfGgQbzJuRF1DmbNX4LVcQ,m_ytmcf3b2kBw1VN_9KGTg,"We noticed this place while driving through the parking lot last week and knew we had to try it. Man, we are SO glad we did!!! BEST SERVICE EVER!

We ordered Crawfish and the headless deveined shrimp by the pound, with all three seasonings mixed together, (Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Butter) at the &#34;Calm&#34; spice level. The crawfish bag was a little saltier than the shrimp bag, but equally as tasty. It was all cooked perfectly and We can&#39;t wait to go again!!!

We also ordered the Cajun Fries, which are big enough to share between two people with big appetites, but they ended up actually being steak fries with some Cajun seasoning sprinkled on. (I don&#39;t want to compare, but we had previously eaten at the Angry Crab in the city and they have thinner Cajun fries, so we weren&#39;t expecting steak fries, but they were still yummy!) They were $4.50 I believe, which is in line with other similar places.

My husband ordered the beignets and they come as a 4 piece covered with powdered sugar. He said they weren&#39;t exactly authentic tasting, but they sure were delicious. He said he&#39;d order them again next time.

They have other add-ons like corn, sausage, potatoes, and rice, which are inexpensive.

One unique side item we noticed was Garlic noodles, which seem to be very popular, but I&#39;m allergic to wheat, so I of course wasn&#39;t able to try them. (Maybe I can suggest a Gluten-Free version for those of us who suffer with Celiac Disease and Wheat allergies.)

They also have calamari, which is popular. Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, regular fries, fried seafood baskets, other food items, bottled beer, and soft drinks.

Overall, this place was quite the surprise because the food was excellent, not to mention, the service was actually the BEST SERVICE we&#39;ve EVER had after 2.5 years of living in the Chicago area. We brought our 6 month old baby and we had a great time. Mike was our server, and he anticipated our every move &amp; brought the things we needed without even having to ask us. It was like he read our minds and knew what we needed before we even realized it ourselves! Impeccable service! Mike gave us great recommendations, taught us how to eat crawfish successfully, and gave excellent follow up service. Thank you Mike!!!

They even have a hand washing station, because you are gonna get dirty! That&#39;s what I like.

They sell the seafood by the half pound - everything from whole lobster, crab legs, head on shrimp, head off shrimp, mussels, clams, and crayfish. You can customize your dish the way you like it with the spices, sauces, and hotness (as in spicy). The food comes out relatively quickly, and it&#39;s to die for! So good. The spice is just right. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Crayfish is now my new favorite thing thanks to this place!

I ordered one each of the corn, potato and sausage. The sausage didn&#39;t arrive in my bag, I had to remind our server I ordered it (but he brought me 2 for the wait). The potato was so well done, it  just fell apart in pieces. Loved the lemon butter and the Cajun we ordered medium, but was more like mild. The price for Devine shrimp was the same as headless so why not make it easier on yourself. 

Really like the 4 handwashing stations with plenty of soap and towels since the bathrooms are single person rooms. Makes it nice that you don&#39;t have to wait to wash your hands. We will definitely be back but early in the evening. Went around 5:30 on a Wednesday and no wait for a table. Don&#39;t wear anything you wouldn&#39;t want to risk getting food stains on!

In the Midwest, it was difficult to find something comparable to Hot &amp; Juicy and every one place we tried, we always compared the flavors to it. My husband and I have gone to Angry Crab, Boiling Crab, Low Country&#39;s, and Asian Cajun. Out of all the places, I&#39;d say this was in my bottom 2. 

Service was great and it was nice to get a free lb of crawfish when checking into Yelp, but I will not be returning here as flavors were not in my best interest. It was very oily and the insane spice level wasn&#39;t even spicy, at least to us.

The service is as good as it gets. Probably the best that I&#39;ve experienced from Angry Crab, Low Country,  Asian Cajun, and The Boiler. Everyone checks on you regularly and they even put your bib on which caught me by surprise because I was not expecting that haha. 

We ordered 1 lb of whole shrimp with All 3 sauces and getting crazy (spice level). The spice level was perfect and not too buttery compared to the other seafood boil places. I was surprised that they&#39;ve an option of headless deveined shrimp. That was something new that I&#39;ve never seen offered. We also got a deal which is 2-3 lbs worth of seafood for $40. It included whole shrimp, crawfish, mussels, calms, snow crab legs, 2 potatoes, 2 corns, and 2 sausage. GREAT DEAL! We couldn&#39;t finish it! 

I&#39;m upset that I haven&#39;t tried any of the sides when I came in. The garlic noodles are a crowd favorite that I&#39;ve heard from the server. I hear that they&#39;re also coming up with different sides which is awesome. I&#39;m pretty big with seafood boil places so I&#39;m still trying to find one with great  service, great spice/seasoning level, and great sides. Right now, Crazy crab owns the service and spice/seasoning level.

We normally go to Angry Crab (Chicago) or Hot N Juicy (Las Vegas) for this type of food but once we heard about this place we wanted to try it out. 

I honestly can say I like this place better than Angry Crab. I tried the headless and devained shrimp with the cajun and garlic butter flavoring at the &#34;I luv crazy&#34; spice level. I normally don&#39;t eat too spicy but this was great! 

Service was alright. There was not really much of an explanation of how the menu worked so we didn&#39;t know we could mix all three flavors together when we first ordered. Took a bit to get all things settled and make sure we had everything because we constantly had to keep asking for more after our waiter walked away. At one point, we didn&#39;t want to bother anymore because we wanted to enjoy our food more than being clean. (Asking for a bib or gloves)

My family and I were very pleased with our meal here from start to finish. If I had to make a minor complaint, it would be that I wish they had mallets for the crabs, and they were out of Blue crabs that day, but those are very minor!

All together we had:
2 pounds of snow crab
1 pound of mussels
1 pound of clams
1 pound of deveined, headless shrimp
1 pound of crawfish(free with your Yelp check in!)
1 order of beignets

Looks like a hole in the wall seafood place. Usually spells disaster. But you are surprised right when you walk inside. The decor is coastal and laid back. You can write on pretty much anything. Could get sloppy but nice for the kids to run around with a marker on the walls. But the place is clean. Very well kept. The wait staff was friendly. The service was fast. When you first see everything come out in a clear industrial garbage bag, you try to make sense of it at first. But then when you dive in, you understand it. All the flavors, all the goodness is at the bottom. I ordered the snow crab with garlic butter. It was messy, but delicious. U can unshell all your crab and let it soak in the butter garlic at the bottom. Sooooooo good. 

I would compare this place to a Joe&#39;s Crab Shack (though it is better than Joe&#39;s) or bubba bumps. Not like a bob Chins. The prices are reasonable for seafood. Definitely not over priced. But be prepared to spend at least 50 bucks between two people.

crazy-crab-streamwood,Edward M.,ERK8lp1ikLZMF4qkVxlTNA,tRGlfWu8lt6vDbGw4G7RgQ,"Great food with good service. Just opened on Tuesday.

For those of you familiar, this place is like Boiling Crab from the LA area.

You order food by the pound and they boil it in stock of sorts that adds great flavor then they put it in a bag and give it to you.  You leave the shells on the table and make a mess of your hands as you eat. If you like seafood and don&#39;t mind getting messy, go for it.

Sauce choices: Cajun, Lemon, Garlic (non are spicy by default you choose that in the second step of ordering).

Spiciness: Choose from the equivalents of Mild, Medium, Spicy, Extra Spicy. We went with the medium and you got some spiciness without overwhelming the flavor. If you like spicy food go spicy or extra.

Calamari - tender rings of calamari in a batter that is similar to onion rings.  They taste good but even better if you dip it into the sauce.

Clams - great explosions of flavor with tender clams.  The best part is you can scoop up the garlic pieces and cajun spices as you eat which makes it great tasting.

Crawfish - I hate working for my food but I had fun trying to figure this one out.  Here&#39;s what I figured out, hold the head in one hand and the body in the other, twist about 30 degrees away from you. Then pull down gently and the meat should pop out of the head.  Then hold the body and tail the same way you just had it and push down on both sides of the body to snap the shell across the &#34;spine&#34; if it had one.  Then pull up from the bottom of the body and the shell should come off and you get a piece of meat about an inch or so long.  Dip the meat into the juices since most of the flavor is in the juices.

Sausage - Polish sausage - it&#39;s fine, honestly you can get it anywhere so no real need to order it here

fyi they were still doing the grand opening special, check in on facebook and you get a free lb of craw fish.  Just ask if they are still running it when you go in.

I&#39;ve been to Angry Crab, lowcountry, and the Rim Seafood in Chicago and the Boiling Crab in Las Vegas so I wanted to see if this place was comparable to the competitors in Chicago. Plus my friends on Facebook said it was &#34;good as Angry Crab&#34; so I wanted to see for myself if this was true.

Location- this place is in a small strip mall, there&#39;s plenty of parking available in the lot. The place is spacious on the inside and not cramped like it is at Angry Crab. The layout is pretty much the same, with a sink to wash your hands in the back of the restaurant and the walls filled with names of visitors that had checked out the restaurant  (we didn&#39;t get a marker by the way.)

Food- the food was plain to say the least. I ordered 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of clams, with Calm spice (not spicy) and garlic butter. My boyfriend got a 1 lb each of shrimp, clams, and crawfish with &#34;I Luv Crazy&#34; spice and the 3 flavors combined (cajun, lemon, and garlic butter). My order was inconsistent. My bag of clams was spicier than my bag of shrimp, when I requested not spicy for both my shrimp and clams. I hated the sauce, it was super runny, watery, and thin, leaving none of the sauce on the seafood. Usually, I like the sauce thick like how it is at Angry Crab and lowcountry so it clings on to the seafood. But here, it was super runny so none of the flavor stayed on and it tasted plain. Also, the garlic butter sauce was too garlicky and I couldn&#39;t taste the butter. It tasted like garlic water sauce, so disappointing. My boyfriend said his crawfish was overcooked, making it hard for him to peel and it looked mushy. He ordered the &#34;I Luv Crazy&#34; spice, which wasn&#39;t spicy at all for him. We also ordered the Fried Oysters with French Fries. This was not good and I don&#39;t recommend ordering it. It was just super greasy oysters that tasted fishy and the fries had no salt so it was just fried potatoes.

Service- our server was friendly at first and explained the menu nicely since it was our first time there. However, as time went on, he never once asked how we were doing and how our food was. Our food didn&#39;t take too long (15 to 20 minutes) but I didn&#39;t like how they brought out our seafood in a bag separately. Considering my boyfriend and I bought 5 lbs of food, they came to our table at 5 different times, which was inconvenient. I&#39;d rather have our food come out at the same time, rather than 5 times. I had also ordered the Fried Oysters with fries as an appetizer and I thought it was weird that our main course came out before our appetizer did. 30 to 40 minutes pass and our server still did not ask how we were doing nor did he refill our water. I thought he was the only server and there were about 5 or 6 other tables so I felt bad at first until I saw another woman who started to serve the other tables. It wasn&#39;t until he went to the table next to us and starting cleaning the table, that I grabbed his attention and asked about our appetizer. At this point, I already knew he forgot since we were 75% done eating and almost 40 minutes passed by. He kept apologizing and he felt bad, he gave us the appetizer for free for forgetting to place that order. I commend him for doing that for us but I wish the other staff (I saw like 4 busboys and he was the only waiter until we were almost done eating) would be more attentive and help him out, instead of standing in the back, waiting to do something.

Verdict- food was plain and the staff needs to work on professionalism and customer service. Sorry, Crazy Crab but I&#39;m not crazy about your food and service. I&#39;ll stick to the competitors in Chicago.",06/06/16,407,2,1,0,-37,-0.5881,2.1870000000000003,2.916,30.895,No,3788
crazy-crab-streamwood,Elaine M.,2YKO5OxTfgW-qDKZaWwD1w,a-POMpgh6TsQOxj3ZUA9Ag,"We finally got to try Crazy Crab in Streamwood. Having been to The Boiler in Skokie and Angry Crab in Chicago, my family knew how to order and what to expect.  A few members of our party had never experienced the shellfish-in-a-bag restaurant experience, so our server did a great job explaining the process.  

We ordered cajun chicken wings (very salty), the fried fish basket (fried cod with french fries), cajun shrimp, garlic butter shrimp (my favorite!), mussels, onion rings, fries, rice, and drinks.  The food came out quickly and almost too hot to touch with your fingers.  Fortunately (unlike their competition), Crazy Crab offers paper &#34;plates&#34; and plastic forks.  Also, 4 sinks outside the washroom for washing the spices and butter off your fingers.  (I believe The Boiler only has 1 and Angry Crab just 2 dining room sinks.)

Overall, the Crazy Crab sauces we ordered were excellent, all the seafood was very fresh and perfectly cooked, and the staff was friendly.  I love the fact that they offer shrimp 3 ways:  head on, headless, and headless/deveined.  The headless/deveined shrimp is so easy to peel!

We were a party of 8, but got 3 separate checks.  The server was very nice about this and got everything correct (sounds odd to mention, but often the drinks and appetizers get put on the wrong checks).  He did pre-add an 18% tip for each ticket (because the total party was over 6 people?), which we paid without complaint.  We were planning to tip 20%, so that&#39;s his loss.

There&#39;s plenty of free parking and this location is convenient for my extended family.  We are looking forward to our next visit to Crazy Crab!",31/05/16,211,5,1,2,-52,1.7471999999999999,2.306,1.448,15.245999999999999,No,1656

Sets the whole mood for me for the actual meal and this place has the WORST SERVICE I have ever seen. We walk in and there&#39;s a guy at the front counter (short buzzed haircut) doing something and doesn&#39;t greet us, or say &#34;We&#39;ll be right with you&#34; - doesn&#39;t even LOOK at us, and I swear a whole minute and a half passes and I&#39;m starting to get pissed. We just stood there. I was about to just seat myself but a lady finally comes up and seats us. 

We eat our food - not bad, but not the best boil we&#39;ve had. Price seems fair and the shrimp looked fresh.

After we were done, it took us another while to get our check. Someone brings us our check, and walks away. I was tired of WAITING so I told my husband, &#34;let&#39;s just pay up front.&#34; 

We go up to the counter and its the SAME GUY who pissed me off at the beginning - I hand him our check and ask if we can pay there at the front desk. He says, &#34;oh sure, I can do that for you.&#34; As he is ringing us up, he says, &#34;But next time, make sure you pay at the table, okay?&#34; 

That did it for me. I just looked at him and said as bluntly as I could, &#34;Yeah, well, we&#39;ve BEEN waiting at the table.&#34; Then his look softens and says, &#34;oh, really? Ok.&#34; No apologies, no nothing.

Yeah, it doesn&#39;t take a genius to be able to have some common sense when it comes to customer service. You don&#39;t greet the customer, make them stand awkwardly in front of you for too long without a word, and then tell them, &#34;Just make sure you pay at the table next time.&#34; No &#34;please.&#34; If that was my employee, I&#39;d fire him.

This is a fun place where you order a pound of shellfish and they bring it to you in a clear plastic bag with no plates or silverware. You dig in with your hands and let the cajun juices from the shellfish and sauce drip down your hands. You leave the shells right on the table. it was quite a fun experience. Don&#39;t wear anything nice!

I liked the set-up of this place with wooden tables and benches which were set up pretty close to each other. It was nice chatting with the table next to us or being able to see what other tables were ordering. There were a few long tables set up for large groups. I would definitely recommend coming with a group of 4 or more so that you can try all the different shellfish they have. The server suggested 1 pound for 2 people which is the minimum they serve.  If you go with one other person, you can definitely order 2 pounds but you&#39;ll definitely walk away really full.

We had the crawfish ($8/lb) and clams ($10/lb) in the cajun medium spicy. Definitely recommend the clams! There is a lot of garlic and bold spices in the sauce so if you have indigestion or heartburn, make sure you load up on your antacids before and after! The fried calamari ($8) was awesome.

Crazy Crab is located in a small &amp; to me kind of a random strip mall. It&#39;s smaller than the other Cajun places. Nice, clean, and spacious. 

We arrived on a Saturday night &amp; we waited 20 minutes or so for a table. Not too bad. But, I&#39;m expecting it to be much busier once more people find out about it. 

Their Cajun sauce is really good. I can taste all the elements in their sauce in each bite. The spice, the garlic, the butter. I got the &#39;I luv crazy&#39; which is the third spice level. I didn&#39;t find it very spicy, but I like spicy food.

The crawfish is only $8!! The rest of the seafood prices are comparable to the other Cajun restaurants. 

Service is pretty much the same as all the other places. We didn&#39;t have trouble grabbing help if we needed them and they came by to check on us asked for refills on our waters/beers. They don&#39;t have the salt, pepper, &amp; lime concoction that others have, but you can ask them for the ingredients you just need to make it yourself. They also provided me with gloves which I liked.

Why didn&#39;t this place get the  other stars? Because they lack decent sides and variety in their menu and the location is again, hideous!

I appreciate the combination of all 3 flavors (Cajun, garlic butter, and lemon pepper) making the perfect Cajun seasoning of the broiled crustaceans . I also appreciate their handwash station nearby the actual tables. Bonus! 

However, their appys are subpar and nothing complimentary to their entrees IMO. Definitely skip the beignets and seasoned fries. Waste of money and tummy space. Bleh!

Let me start by saying we went to Crazy Crab on a Sunday afternoon around 3:30pm. We were a fairly large group (9 people). Right after we walked in it was like the late lunch crowd got there because by the time we left it was PACKED with other large groups. I was happy to see a new restaurant with so much booming business. 

I love the fact that this new restaurant is different then your typical place in Schaumburg/The Arboretum in South Barrington. You can&#39;t usually find Cajun/Creole places in the burbs... You have to drive to a neighborhood of the city. I&#39;m so happy that this place is now in the burbs. 

I love the way you can customize your seafood selections. Some of us wanted our food a little spicy, and others did not, so we were able to customize our sauces and spices. 

5 of us split the following:
2 lbs of headless de-veined shrimp (these are monster size shrimp!!)
2 lbs of Alaskan crab legs
1 lb of mussels
1 lb of clams
2 lbs whole lobster

The five of us were definitely FULL when we were all done. Just a side note - When they say GARLIC BUTTER, they mean overloaded with GARLIC! We were all family, so we didn&#39;t care smelling like garlic, but I wouldn&#39;t go on a date there or anything your married and totally comfortable! You will leave smelling like garlicky goodness. 

I absolutely LOVE Crazy Crab. I&#39;m totally a fan and I&#39;ll definitely be back with my husband and other family members. This place is AWESOME for group dining and kid friendly. It&#39;s fun to share and eat with your hands and the ambiance is totally chill and very inviting. Our total bill for 9 people was about $270 before tip.

crazy-crab-streamwood,G D.,jU4W5IMVSVmzulQX9Oyudg,L2Es1UJT9h0fwx_bCaRoUg,"We came here on it&#39;s 2nd day of business, it is located in a small strip mall off of Barrington Road near the corner of Bode in Streamwood.  I consider it more Schaumburg than Streamwood.   The menu is simple you either buy your seafood by the pound or under the &#34;starters&#34; column you can get  fried fish basket w/french fries and that applies to the chicken tenders, fried shrimp or fried oyster basket.  My husband ordered the fried shrimp basket with french fries, I chose 1lb of clams in garlic butter with the spicy level of calm (least spicy).  I also ordered under add -on items corn on the cob.  Other family members ordered the headless devein shrimp in crazy cajun/lemon butter with the &#34;I luv Crazy&#34; spicy level.  The food came out quite fast and in a plastic bag if  you were ordering seafood by the pound.  
I have to say I loved the small clams it was delicious - BTW - the server suggested that if you check in on their facebook page they are offering a pound of crawfish with your meal for free!  
Since this is new, the restaurant is nicely done, with a hand washing station in the back of the restaurant (nice idea).  The lighting is perfect I don&#39;t like eating in a dimly lit restaurant this place was bright and had a few tvs mounted on the walls for people like my husband who didn&#39;t want to miss the sports going on. 
We&#39;ll be back the prices are definitely reasonable and the quality of fresh seafood was superb. I think as they get into the swing of this type of restaurant they will tweak their menu to the preference of their customers - how about a la carte...fried oysters no french fries?   Great job!!  the servers were friendly and attentive.",20/04/16,187,5,2,4,30,3.8054,2.443,0.41,11.146999999999998,No,1705
crazy-crab-streamwood,PHIL S.,kxtKSHF6_T-bheA-aPQIiA,Wnu97DBWO3KFlRplrc_t5w,Was excited to try this place after all the good reviews but ended up being very disappointed. Short on time we ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crabs with the mix of all 3 sauces at the getting crazy spice level. We also ordered a pound of mussels with Cajun and spicy. The seafood quality was fine but the sauce was very bland and it was all butter.  Even dipping every piece all you could taste was bitter garlic and butter.  We ended up having to add our own chili powder to the sauce. We&#39;ll give it another go hoping we had a bad batch but if it&#39;s the same stuff as last we are better off buying our own seafood from Costco and melting our own butter with creole seasoning.,04/05/16,70,1,1,0,-31,-0.5643,0.389,0.541,6.07,No,699

It seemed chaotic and did not have things under control with checking everyone in. Luckily we asked when we were up next, because they crossed our names off before even seating us. The front of house didn&#39;t seem as friendly as when we sat down. The guy who seemed like the manager of or owner was very nice and attentive other than towards the end when we had to flag someone down to get the check and to pay our bill. 

Overall the food itself was good and is comparable to other crab boils in the area. The sauces weren&#39;t as mixed throughout the whole bag.

1. The seafood should not be greasy. 
2. Overpriced sides: 75 cents each for unseasoned 1/4 of a red potato and an inch long piece of crappy (non-Cajun) sausage. 2b. Just include one of each: potato (whole), corn (whole), sausage (whole) in with the seafood....and charge about $1.50. 
3. Poor and messy presentation: paper cartons for crab legs???? 
4. &#34;Cajun&#34; = Not at all. Not bad flavor, just too greasy and not Cajun by a long shot. 
5. Seasoning should be in the water, not post-boiling. 5b. Sides should be cooked WITH the seafood.
6. Beignets weren&#39;t bad but too small. 
7. Sinks for customers to use is genius. 
8. Decor is just a weird hodge-podge of mismatched beach trinkets that have zero to do with cajun cuisine or culture. 
9. Training is needed across the board - from the hostesses, servers to the managers - as well as fixing the cuisine. Some were polite but highly disorganized.",12/07/16,143,2,1,-1,-42,-1.5204,0.5489999999999999,1.255,15.195999999999998,No,1083

The restaurant was not too noisy and what you expect from a restaurant that does boils.

We ordered a pound of shrimp, pound of Crawfish and pound of Alaskan King Crab legs.  The food was delicious, especially with 3 flavors all mixed together.  We had the insane heat which I consider mild but other thought was nice and hot.  Had the crab legs in the butter and garlic and delicious.  Everything was cooked to perfection and the crawfish tasted fresh.

Only reason why this is not 5 star instead of 4 star, is that they do not have french bread to soakk up the sauce when done.  This is a must if you claim to be a Cajun/Creole restaurant.  Pair with a local bakery and get it done.

And also, throw in some Abita beer on the menu :)

This is not a negative to me, but they do not have a liquor license, so prepare accordingly for beer.

Ann is a lovely business woman who was quite distressed by the behavior of her manager. She apologized profusely saying she assured me that this behavior &#34;would never happen again.&#34; She and her husband do not tolerate such rude behavior from their employees. Because of this, she has invited us back for another whirl, their treat. 

Because of her professionalism and prompt attention to our problem I am happy to say that we will take her up on her invitation and enjoy another night of great service and excellent food.

fioras-geneva,Jacqueline B.,zKY6NM9CxxWxcY5JJXUB7g,RWHDYpYfYwKi88fz9zSrBQ,"It was a beautiful Saturday night out and my husband and I were looking for a nice spot to grab dinner. Fiora&#39;s had live music outside which sounded delightful. To no surprise there was over an hour wait for their patio tables, so we opted just to eat inside right away instead (you could say we were pretty hungry).

We were sat at a quiet table near the sunroom at the back of the restaurant. Our waitress was super sweet, but we kind of felt like she was rushing us the whole time. We each had a cocktail, soup, and our entree and were literally in and out in 45 minutes. For a date night that cost us $100 we were hoping for a longer more relaxing evening.

That being said, our food was very good. The watermelon lemon mocktail I had was summery and refreshing. It was the perfect treat for a celebratory toast with my hubby for our 3 year wedding anniversary. The lobster bisque was yummy as well. The cup was a bit pricey for the size, but I can&#39;t say I was surprised. The bread and cracker assortment that came with our meal was a nice touch.

For my main entree I had their chicken medallion with spinach and angel hair pasta. It was the perfect amount of food and everything was delicious. The chicken melted in my mouth and the pasta and veggies complimented each other very well.

I&#39;d definitely like to come back for some wine on their patio and maybe even tap into their lunch menu (since it&#39;s cheaper!). Overall a tasty spot with a nice atmosphere. It&#39;s to be mentioned that their menu is American -- not Italian which is what we originally expected ;)",26/09/16,171,4,3,5,77,8.2001,4.188999999999999,0.207,14.604999999999997,No,1587

I was getting hungry, seeing as it was 8 PM and I&#39;d traveled in from the city for my appointment, so we stopped in to split a meal. 

The hostess helped entice us in by letting us know that their deal of the evening was half off cocktails, so we were sold off the bat. This is a beautiful old home converted into a restaurant with a gorgeous patio, outdoor bar, and 4 seasons porch for chillier months. If I could eat here every night (and maybe even live here...?), I absolutely would. 

First ordered the prosecco with pomegranate juice...MAN it was delicious!! So good that I will be replicating that drink on my wedding day while I get ready. Perfect proportions. Momma and I shared the burger and the watermelon salad. They knew we were splitting the meal, so they split it onto two different plates before they sent it out to us (I love when places do that). 

The burger is messssssy but it is very tasty! Perhaps I&#39;ll order it without mayo next time. The fries are my favorite kind - thick, crunchy outside and soft in the middle. The watermelon salad could have stood to have a bit more greenery and mozzarella, but maybe that&#39;s just my personal preference. It was still delicious!

Service is attentive, quick, and friendly, too. I asked to go to the bathroom in the wine cellar, and the hostess walked me all the way there to show me where it is. I really hope to come back here sometime in the winter time because the indoor seating here looks just as amazing, if not better, than their outdoor seating.

My husband and I tried it when we moved to the area this past summer, I was about 10 months pregnant at the time and everything always seemed to taste pretty good! However I remember thinking that my meal of crab cakes was good but not fantastic given the restaurant&#39;s popularity.

This weekend we dined here with friends and again, this wasn&#39;t a meal memorable enough to make me return especially because of the price. I ordered scallops over a sweet potato, kale &amp; bacon hash. Food arrived cold, and the scallops were a little fishy tasting and didn&#39;t seem to be seasoned well. The hash was good but even the sweet potatoes were cooked oddly in my opinion - they seemed steamed and mushy when I believe a hash is pan seared and therefore should have left the potatoes caramelized and crispy.

Also, my second glass of wine arrived and definitely seemed like it had been poured from a bottle that had been open a little too long. The waitress immediately replaced it so no complaints on service. In fact, I hate to give three stars when the waitress was among the best we have ever had! She was kind and professional, yet also playful with our group, and never missed a beat.

Might explain my mom&#39;s opinion about her Shrimp Risotto.  She said it didn&#39;t taste totally cooked and had a fishy smell, but she isn&#39;t the type of person to complain.

The menu isn&#39;t extensive, as any restaurant that uses quality ingredients and chef created cuisine, but there is something for everyone.  I ordered the Fiora&#39;s Supreme of Chicken.  It was very good, I&#39;m just not sure about the $26 price on it.  Some of the entrees command that kind of price, but I&#39;m still on the fence about how chicken, spinach and mashed potatoes comes up to $26.  Again though, it was good and I ate every bit of it.  I just expect that price for seafood or beef.

We all had a great time.  I love the ambiance, the service, the staff and the food.  If you ever hear that Dennis O&#39;Brien with John Paruolo is preforming, be sure to check them out.  Awesome live musicians!!

Fiora&#39;s would have gotten 5 stars from me if it wasn&#39;t for the price tag on the chicken and the heavy fish smell in the restaurant.",08/07/14,197,4,2,5,41,6.558199999999999,4.723,0.476,18.801,No,1806

My wife and I have eaten here several times before and have always had impeccable service.  Ask for James or Leroy. They won&#39;t do you wrong! We had New Year&#39;s Eve reservations. Being New Years and a 2 hour time limit on seating we both did not expect too much. Boy, are we glad we were wrong! How a place that busy with that many orders coming in can turn food out that good and that well timed is impressive in itself.

They must have been full, as they sat us in the wine cellar. There were four tables in the room and a cozy fire in a fireplace to warm up the usually chilly room. Very nice touch!

We each had an appetizer and an entree. Each of us had to rate each item as a 5. We had a crab cake and the lobster bisque for our appetizers. OMG, the flavor and seasoning of each was perfect. The bisque was rich, creamy and loads of lobster. The bisque was so smooth and delightful, the only chunks were the generous portions of lobster in every bite. We both could have had that alone for dinner and been happy. The crab cake was another pleasant surprise. We kind of expected the standard over mayonnaisey (is that even a word) fried clump with your poor bottled type Bearnaise. Uh, NO! this too was perfectly seasoned, filled with tons of sweet crab and cooked perfectly. The Bearnaise was fresh, creamy, perfectly balanced with tarragon and acid. It was truly wonderful.

My wife ordered the salmon and I the scallops for our entrees. My wife can be a true snob when it comes to salmon, yet she continues to order it at many places, only to be disappointed, but always hoping for that once in a while surprise. Well, this evening was that surprise that made her extremely happy. Cooked to perfection, nicely seasoned and served over a bed of delightful couscous and asparagus. She was thoroughly impressed. I have been married to her for 23 years. I know how hard she is to impress. ;) The couscous and asparagus, both prepared with just the right amount of crunch and texture, really highlighted the salmon. Nice job!

My scallops were sweet, huge, nicely sauteed with a hint of crust on the outside and smooth and velvety throughout. This was served over a bed of sauteed kale with just the right amount of lemon and garlic as to highlight the sweetness of the scallops. Yep, again, perfect! I seem to be using that word a lot here.

Being the gluttons that we are, we went with a single lobster tail to split between us.. Cooked and seasoned to perfection with about the best side of seasoned clarified butter you could ever have, this just complimented our entrees even more. We sat there the entire time, ate each bite slowly and savored each taste. What a great evening.

There are very few restaurants, I find, that are actually good enough to not put anything other than silverware and napkins on the table. Well, tonight, Fiora&#39;s did themselves well. What a fantastic meal! 

We will be remembering this one for a long time. Thanx for the memorable evening.",01/01/15,351,5,3,5,82,14.9321,11.735000000000003,1.8310000000000002,31.435,No,3168

I&#39;ve experienced better.&#34;  We ate on the patio last night - gorgeous night - four people who had all been curious about this place and very much looking forward to it - and not a one of us thought we&#39;d bother to return.

Their menus and website all brag, &#34;Voted Best Restaurant Last 3 Years in a Row (2014, 2013 &amp; 2012).&#34;  Okay...  The venue IS very nice.  Unusual spaces...private feel inside...looked like there was a nice atrium area for dining...and then a lovely patio.  It&#39;s great.  They even have a bar on the patio with its own section of high tables for drinks and appetizers.  If we&#39;d been there just for that I probably would have given three stars.  Live music outside...nice.

The problem is the food.  

My husband ordered what our server said they said they were &#34;famous&#34; for:  GRILLED SCALLOPS seasoned with salt and pepper and lightly grilled, served over a bed of heirloom black forbidden rice and sauted Swiss chard and garnished with a saffron butter sauce.  For $27.95 you received four larger scallops and not much else.  Had those scallops been A-M-A-Z-I-N-G I think he would have been happy but they weren&#39;t.  It was disappointing enough for him to send back after just a few bites.

I ordered the BONELESS SHORT RIB slow cooked, glazed with Korean barbeque sauce, served over wasabi whipped potatoes and Asian vegetable slaw.  Spelling matters...it is indeed ONE medium-sized rib.  Also $27.95.  Um...  The reason I ordered this was because I had recently purchased some short ribs for my dog.  He was sick and nearing the end and I wanted to get him some really nice meaty bones like from a rib roast but the butcher recommended short ribs.  He cut them long for a good-sized bone.  I&#39;d never had short ribs before and was astonished by the amount of meat.  I roasted them for my pooch and omg...they looked good.  I just had to try.  They were like the most delicious prime rib.  Amazing.  Just something I roasted up for my dog...  And they were better than this expensive piece of meat.  This was more like a well-done piece of crock pot pot roast.  It wasn&#39;t bad but like the scallops, it wasn&#39;t at all amazing enough to justify the price.

Are you catching on about the portions too?  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m expecting an Old Country Buffet heap on my plate but c&#39;mon...ONE rib??

Another in our party had the SPANISH PAELLA chicken, shrimp, clams and sausage, pan cooked with saffron rice, roasted red peppers, tomatoes and peas for $26.95.  It looked nice on the plate and she said it was &#34;good.&#34;  There was more of a portion here but it&#39;s rice so...  Pricey pricey for what it was.  The final person had FIORA&#39;S SUPREME OF CHICKEN roasted with garlic, lemon and wine sauce, and served over whipped potatoes with wilted spinach and parmesan cheese for $25.95.  Also &#34;good.&#34;  

Almost forgot the appetizer:  THAI CALAMARI tender calamari fried and tossed in chili sweet sour sauce, topped with lime aioli, cilantro and scallions for $9.95.  It was tasty but smacked of being a shaken-out-of-a-freezer-bag and spruced up with a dollop of commercial spicy sauce and sprinkled with fresh greenery to make it look more special.  I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised to be served this at TGI Fridays.

sigh...  Usually I&#39;m a sucker for a good patio and can forgive much under the spell of a perfect summer night but there was something so utterly lacking in this otherwise lovely place that had all four of us conclude that despite its charms, we wouldn&#39;t ever return.  That&#39;s too bad.

I called the waiter over and he insisted that it was Brie he even went back to the kitchen and brought out the container that the cheese came in to prove it to me.

fioras-geneva,Michael K.,mj1rmmKEkx_fDZDI2XmlaQ,AU7RRciIPuhStZgCU1Queg,"We tried this place after intending to go there for a while.

As others have said the space is pretty cool.  Check out the various rooms on their website and request a preference if you have one.  There is a also a patio area with a bar of it&#39;s own that was putting out some live music when we were there.  The patio was packed with people that didn&#39;t appear to be overly drunk, but did appear to be having a pretty good time, making them well-behaved, somewhat-inebriated revelers, which works for me.
.

We ended up in a library like small room with only 3 tables in it.  As we were about halfway through a couple of drinks and a cheese plate (delicious) the other two tables left, leaving us in our own space.  We quickly figured out that we had easy control of the lighting via a dimmer switch directly next to us so we tuned our lighting and asked the waitress to fire up some candles, which she immediately did.

The cheese plate came with 3 cheeses, which you get to choose from a larger list of available cheeses, some fruits and others things to dress up your cheese bites, and some little bread thingies.  This was delicious.  I&#39;ve had a couple better, but only at Barrington Bistro which rocks the cheese platter world, with all other cheese platters kneeling before it; or Bin 36 which rolls out larger numbers of different cheeses per platter and paired wine flights, but this was quite good and it went a good way to filling us.  We didn&#39;t bother with other appetizers, salads, etc. and went right to entrees after drinks and cheeses, through which the waitress checked on us regularly to make sure we were in good shape.

My wife had some braised short rib concoction which was delicious and came with all sorts of flavors.  Although I only sampled a small bit, she liked it, I&#39;m sure of that.  I had the duck and loved it.  Again, it had a bunch of flavors.  A light, but not overpowering orange sauce, sitting on a bed of cous cous cooked perfectly and mixed with nuts, herbs and some bits of fruit that I think were mango or apricots.  It was delicious and we were both unable to finish.

I guess I&#39;m perplexed at some people complaining about portion sizes.  We couldn&#39;t have finished ours if we&#39;d been in an eating competition.  Between just the cheese platter and those entrees we walked off with enough for lunch the next day.

Ditto on pricing.  This is downtown Geneva, which, in case people haven&#39;t noticed, is a somewhat affluent area.  I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume that the location itself, being smack in the middle of Geneva is costing them a few dollars.  They&#39;re also going to have to add some bells and whistles if they hope to attract the denizens of this little burg of Rich Folks.   The people they&#39;re catering to expect to be catered to, and that&#39;s not cheap either.  

The prices are also on their online menu, so I just don&#39;t see how anyone can complain about that.

For 40-50 dollars a person you can walk out bursting at the seams.  You can of course spend more for multiple appetizers/courses, and alcohol will bump your bill up, but that is all at your discretion.

For that you&#39;re getting great atmosphere, really delicious food and plenty of it, and excellent service.  

It&#39;s not inexpensive, but it&#39;s fair.  We&#39;ll definitely be going back.",10/08/14,342,5,1,5,-5,9.0497,5.069000000000001,0.652,27.279000000000007,No,3362

I can&#39;t say much about the price. I have a general idea but my chivalrous boyfriend never lets me see the bill :-)

The food wasn&#39;t BAD necessarily. And the prosecco served was quite good. I just expected better from its reputation.

The best way I can describe the service is &#34;abrupt.&#34;  Our waters glasses were filled often, and dirty plates picked up right away, but our server was rather awkward, arriving at our table a half of a second after our food arrived with comments such as &#34;are you happy?&#34; or &#34;is it delicious?&#34; without our even having eaten anything.  I realize this doesn&#39;t appear to be too bad in writing, but in the moment it just felt incredibly strange.  Also, the food arrived very quickly.  Normally that wouldn&#39;t bother me, but when you order an appetizer or salad and it arrives within one minute, you have to wonder about the quality of preparation.

Speaking of the food, it wasn&#39;t bad, just not great.  We ordered calamari as an appetizer, which was adequate but I&#39;ve had better at other restaurants.  My husband ordered a wedge salad which should have been called &#34;blue cheese salad.&#34;  I&#39;ve never seen so much blue cheese before in my life; it just overpowered everything else.  My chicken supreme dish was warm, the chicken was juicy but overall quite bland.  And while the side of potatoes was quite good, the spinach was incredibly salty.

Again, I wanted to give it 3 stars, but it is more on the expensive side.  Everything is a la carte and there are minimal options for wine by the glass.

Wedge Salad - just ok, not enough toppings
Crab Cake Appetizer - best part of the meal 
Boneless Short Rib - meat was dry and chewy, mashed potatoes were gummy
Grilled Scallops - scallops overcooked, more like charred on the grill and had a burnt grill taste to them. Very sandy too. Black rice too undercooked for my taste.

Wines were average. Needless to say we skipped dessert. Service was average although the server &#34;didn&#39;t hear&#34; us order the appetizer so the salad came first, then we asked about the crab cakes and he said he&#39;s get those right out, which he did. I also asked for a side of mashed potatoes with the scallops because I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d like the black rice. The server brought me the wrong potatoes ... I just ate the ones he brought because I just didn&#39;t want to complain again after the missed appetizer. Then come the over-grilled, sandy scallops and I was just getting really mad because this was supposed to be a nice date night, turned into an expensive waste of time and of a precious night out. Grrr. Honestly, it seemed like the scallops were cooked on a dirty grill that hadn&#39;t been cleaned in awhile. They were just gross and left a funny metallic taste in my mouth. 

The following couple days my husband tried a few times to call and talk to a manager at Fiora&#39;s and after no answer and no call back he just gave up. Lesson learned. Just because it&#39;s got a &#34;best&#34; rating and expensive prices does not mean it&#39;s going to be good. 

Our next date night we went to Isacco Kitchen in St. Charles. We&#39;ve been there 4 or 5 times now and it is always fabulous. Really, Isacco is the best restaurant in the area.

They don&#39;t open it until dinner time which irritated me. But my dad came into town from Texas and he likes eating at nice places so after reading some reviews I decided to give them a try. It wa s Tuesday night and as soon as we walked in it smelled very musty. As we followed the host to the seat, the smell of what I can only describe as cat pee was the next bad odor.

That was the only question that has been running through my mind since we dined here with our Chef neighbors Saturday night atround 8:30 pm...... 

Place is beautiful, well laid-out, with a really nice L shaped bar, and tables outside on the patio..... 

We were promptly seated when we arrived and I was surprised because there were only 4 or 5 other tables seated. We had Liz as our waitress and she made great recommendations, is very cute, but was a bit slow with service (especially with the light crowd). 

Did I say the place is beautiful....it really is spectacular..... 

Food was really solid, not great, but solid. Menu has fewer choices then I would have imagined. I had the sharp cheddar plate first and it was EXCELLENT, then had the salmon for dinner and it was ok, kind of plain, but decent. My wife LOVED the Walleye special, and they all enjoyed the flat bread pizza as an app. 

At desert time, my mind wandered to Grahm&#39;s located across the street, and the girls were kind enough to go across the street and buy some chocolate covered pretzels while we waited for the desserts they ordered...... 

A fun night, neat place, ok service (see the other reviews), and decent food. 

We are going to return to have dinner or desert on the patio.....

She was everything I expected and so was the dining experience at Fiora&#39;s. We were greeted at the door by 2 lovelies handling the seating. Res for 6:30 and they took us to our table in one of the dining areas. My sweet told me that the building used to be a Real Estate office. The multi room layout provides intimacy to the dining experience. We ordered beverages and did not even look at the menu until after the drinks were served. We were not rushed at all. Our waiter explained the two specials, but we looked online at the menu and knew what we were ordering. My lady had the soup du jour and she enjoyed it. I passed as I wanted to savor the boneless pork shanks (great sauce) with fingerling potatoes. The lady had her heart set (sorry but not on me) on the scallops. Above average execution of both dishes. My date ate every bite of the scallops and I was not a slouch with the pork. Servers and staff were very attentive without rushing us or being overly attentive. Dessert was offered, but we passed. I enjoyed the smallish menu. To me it reflects a chef who wants to serve the best of fewer items than trying to be a master of none. 
We talked and talked and no one rushed us at all.

Our waiter arrived and seemed stressed. His manner was a bit terse, not rude, just not at all friendly. I asked if the honey mustard sauce on the salmon was sweet. His reply, &#34;I had some customers tell me last night that it was the best salmon they ever had&#34;. Well that is very nice but please describe the sauce.

Everyone ordered salad and entrees. The salads came and were delicious. I had the spinach salad, very tasty. The majority of the table had the wedge salad and gave it good marks. After my salad I ordered a glass of the Semillon, the pour was not healthy.

No one was exactly overwhelmed by their entree. Seemed everyone&#39;s dish was good, I took a chance and ordered the salmon with the honey mustard sauce, thankfully not sweet, sauted chard and butternut squash orzo. The salmon was good, though pretty rare in the center. The orzo was overcooked but well-seasoned; however, it had never seen butternut squash during its preparation.

As our entrees were being cleared our waiter came with menus to ask if we wanted to order coffee and/or dessert. He warned us that we would have to order quickly as it was 9:10, the restaurant closed at 9:00 and the kitchen closed at 9:30. We were all surprised and felt like we were getting pushed. I split a piece of cheesecake with friends. We agreed that it was not worth the calories. The flavor was okay, bit bland, and the texture was dreadful. It was super hard and seemed congealed, like eating a stick of cold butter. We did not finish it. The banana bread pudding got rave reviews though. 

We walked through the dining room on our way out and saw our waiter sitting at a table with another server and many people hanging out in the lounge. Interesting that our waiter never thought to tell us that we could go up there and continue our evening. It felt like he was more interested in being finished than making our experience a great one.

The only thing I find to pick at this place is that it&#39;s small.  The second time I ate here I sat at the bar and found the ambience was better than in dining area.

I&#39;ve had the prosciutto and fig appetizer. After sitting at the bar I saw the giant prosciutto in the slicer that is freshly sliced with each order. Yum!!!
The Italian chopped salad was delicious and each bite had something really tasty in it. 
The VEAL MEATBALLS were the best! 3 nice sized meatballs on a bed of polenta that was so rich and creamy almost seemed like it was cheese instead of polenta. The sauce on the meatballs was really a home run.

Finally the pizza... the first time I had the gluten free mushroom and the second time I had the sopresata regular pizza. Their gluten free pizza is really thin and crisp. The regular pizza was a bit thicker but also good.

Our server was great and perfectly attentive. We even met one of the owners/chef, and despite having kinda negative views of yelp and yelpers, he was super nice  and very enjoyable to talk with.  

We started with some draft beers and a tomato, basil, eggplant, bruschetta with creamy burrata cheese.  This was incredibly tasty! The combo of crispy toast, roasted veggies, creamy burrata, and tangy balsamic was perfect.  Next we had a salad featuring grilled peaches, mozzarella,  sliced fennel, arugula and fresh blueberries with a lemon balsamic vinaigrette. Again, AWESOME and the mixture of flavors was well crafted and perfectly balanced.  

We finished off with a Hammaker&#39;s Pie. Pretty standard meaty pie with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms. Pizza was good, slightly less impressive than the two previous courses, but still delicious and very much satisfying. It was nicely crisped, and surprisingly not oily given all the meat.

I liked the simple clean rustic look.  Servers were surprisingly attentive for how busy this place gets.  Our food was amazing.  We ordered the mozzarella flight that came with three pieces of mozzarella (the first was creamy and extremely fresh on a bed of peppery arugula, the second was drizzles with balsamic vinaigrette on top of a sweet tomato, and the third was topped with a fresh pesto).  I could have eaten that whole flight by myself...so fresh and flavorful!  We also shared the pancetta and arugula pizza-cripsy pancetta and the pizza dough had just the right amount of crisp and chewiness at the same time.  I also had a glass of rose that was delightful, but priced a bit high ($12).",01/05/16,105,4,2,4,20,3.1561999999999997,1.995,0.115,7.89,No,892
gia-mia-geneva-2,Leslie S.,rbQp0U49dlq-IcC9d3uBdw,nJFSfqm9YGIY6jZrjkkoAw,"I wanted to like Gia Mia because Geneva is truly lacking when it comes to quality Italian cuisine. However, I was put off from the very start by the noise; with laminate floors and wood paneling around the entire restaurant, the noise bounces off the walls and assaults you from every angle. My husband and I were on a two-top and could barely hear each other across the table, though I could hear quite a lot of the conversation around me.

That wood paneling around the restaurant also creates a very rustic/outdoorsy odor that reminded me - and not in a good way - of my days as a Girl Scout. While the smells from the kitchen certainly helped mask the odor a bit, it was hard for me to get over.

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the mozzarella flight, which sounded great, was a bit of a joke. The only difference between the three small mounds of mozzarella was the accompaniment (balsamic, pesto, etc.). I enjoyed it, don&#39;t get me wrong, but was expecting a bit more. Ironically, the margherita pizza I had was lacking in mozzarella and basil (and flavor, unsurprisingly). My husband, on the other hand, enjoyed his appetizer and entree, so perhaps I just &#34;lucked&#34; out.

Yet, I won&#39;t be back. The final topper was when it took us 10 minutes to flag down our waitress for a drink refill. She was incredibly friendly, but clearly overwhelmed and inattentive.",07/08/16,159,2,1,3,-3,2.8962,1.972,0.43900000000000006,10.588,No,1383

From start to finish we enjoyed our visit to Gia Mia.

First, the food and drink: we started with Prosciutto and Figs, then Baby Carrots and Beans, the Bolognese pasta and the Livia pizza.  Can&#39;t give you the specific name of the red wine, the Spanish one, but it was reasonably priced with a generous pour, offering a deep rich taste which warmly accompanied the meal throughout. 

A wide array of items, a wide array of fresh delectable tastes.

The Livia pizza was a perfect combination of slightly crunchy outer edge and chewiness with a wonderful spice to the soprasetta.  My taste of my partner&#39;s Bolognese (gluten free) was impressive.

Think fresh, light and tasty for the servings of carrots and beans, and the prosciutto and figs served with greens and a light, enhancing dressing.

Added to all this was a friendly, enthusiastic server who offered comments if asked for anything on the menu--she had tried it all (lucky server!).   

Their approach to call ahead and phone text alerts is spot-on well done!

We started out with the Wild Mushroom Bruschetta.

We also got the Mozzarella Plate to begin, I couldn&#39;t decide which cheese was my favorite, I loved all of them!

gia-mia-geneva-2,Adam B.,QPPRfD8JxPypOgIP2ekTTQ,yINELZZUQeaoYcpJUZiLCA,"I headed in while I was in town for Swedish Days. I knew there was a location in Wheaton as well but thanks to them being closed on Sundays, it was difficult for me to visit. They had a wait list, but since I was flying solo, I took a seat at the bar. I didn&#39;t feel like drinking, so I stuck with iced tea and water and the bartenders kept both glasses full. Only real sugar was available though.

OK, onto the menu. I was torn between the sausage/pesto and clam/bacon pizzas. One of the bar guys recommended the latter so I went with it. The 12-inch wood fired masterpiece came out within 15 minutes. It had chopped Neuske&#39;s bacon, clams, olive oil, mozzarella, fontina, roasted garlic bechamel, and fresh herbs. For parmesan, there were no shakers, but they brought me a small silver dish of a high quality parmesan. 

The crust was crispy all the way through, which is huge for me. Also, the bechamel helped  keep the pizza moist. So often with tomato-free pizzas, it can get really dry. Thankfully, that didn&#39;t happen with this pizza. I would certainly order it again. For $14, it was a very reasonable price. I noticed some of the pasta dishes and appetizers passing by me and the presentations were incredibly well done as well. 

Gia Mia is a small restaurant with fair (not cheap, not expensive) prices, but they use high-quality ingredients, which results in great flavors, and it&#39;s a great spot for a date.

Every time we go to dinner the food comes out amazingly fast and hot. The items are plated with such care. The starters are some of the best in the Geneva area. The mozzarella sampler is a must try each of the three offerings is outstanding with really high quality cheese. The pizzas are the perfect size with really fresh toppings.

They are not open Sundays and that is odd to me with that being a day to lounge around and a quick dinner and glass of wine is always welcome after a busy weekend. 

Also the first few times we went we didn&#39;t really know what to expect when you walk in with pictures of children on the walls and a beach with the rest of the decor being so rustic. Not the upscale look of downtown Geneva.

I had found that to be very generous, as he actually acknowledged my concerns. I decided to give GM a second chance. I live and work much closer to the Wheaton location. Unfortunately, my second experience was much worse than the first. After speaking to the manager for a second time about the same issue having reoccurred at both locations, he was profusely apologetic and extremely kind. He allowed for me to try GM for a third time at no charge (even though I honestly had zero interest at that point). I was blown away by the meal that I received. Management gets 5 stars. The only reason that my review contains 4 stars is because I feel that the level of service is not consistent from management to the rest of the staff.

gia-mia-geneva-2,Michael L.,D6PdsHvwC6r84ft-hNAQAg,FL2hF8EWxAdi-RtNqsptKA,"I arrived just before 6pm on Tuesday evening, and I&#39;d say the restaurant was about three-quarters full, the conversation level was lively adding to the positive energy of the space. I was greeted promptly and offered a couple of choice to be seated. My server, Emily was welcoming and after learning that this was my first visit, gave me a quick overview of the menu.  I had read the menu online beforehand, so I was able to order immediately. There were salads, small plates, sort of like tapas, and some heartier entre&#39; items on the menu, but the 11 inch, thin crust wood fired pizzas were the feature, and the reason I had come. I was told that the dough was made in-house daily with flour imported from Italy. There are ten or twelve pizza choices, pre-designed by the chef, rather than the customer choosing his or her toppings, and sauces, but each was unique and I chose the Hammakers (?) pie which featured Italian sausage and pepperoni with tomato, mushrooms, herbs and cheese. To my surprise my order was delivered to my table in no more than 5 minutes. My server explained that the wood-fired oven baked at temperatures in excess of 700 degrees, and the pizzas cook to perfection in 90 seconds. The crust was wonderfully flavorful, and the entire pizza a delight. I&#39;m a pretty healthy eater, but the portion satisfied me. But I was tempted towards desert, and enjoyed a scoop of gelato. Emily, my server was knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients, made me feel welcome, and left me wanting for nothing.

Here is where it got dicey.....my husband and I decided to go there for dinner. We ordered the olives (good), Meatballs (very good), Tuscan Shrimp (Ok), Zucchini Fritters (Eh). Then we ordered the Hammakers Pizza (really good!). The server for dinner said &#34;rock on&#34; at least 10 times, no joke. Also, this is a Tapas style dining experience. All dishes were brought out at once.....mind you we were at a two top.....they managed to squeeze everything on the table after knocking my reading glasses off the table (their wasn&#39;t even enough room for my reading glasses). Love the concept of the water bottle left on the table as it was very convenient however, it tastes like hose water.....ya know, like when you were a kid and grabbed the hose to drink water out of on a hot Summer day. I gave this an additional star because the manager/owner was very present.....both at lunch and dinner (went in the same day).

There is no close second place, and I love how they stick to their guns. This family goes above and beyond and does things their way... it is terrific 

Burger: Tremendous griddle-style burger with a killer potato bun. Better than Au Cheval and a ridiculous value. 

Beef: Perfect dip, top-quality beef, and the best giardinera I&#39;ve ever had.

Hot dog: This is a DEPRESSION STYLE DOG made famous on the South and West sides during the 1920&#39;s (a la Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s). It is more Chicago than that &#34;drag it through the garden&#34; option and covered in HAND-CUT fries. For those who are not impressed and who want an &#34;authentic Chicago-style Dog,&#34; try the concession stand at Schaumburg Flyers stadium. No factory made poppy-seed buns or frozen links here.

Porchetta Sandwich: The recipe for this alone sandwich alone could get Illinois out of debt. Try it an then take one home for later. It is the best fast-food sandwich in Chicago right now. 

Other can&#39;t-miss items: Homemade meatball sandwich, homemade tamales, homemade Italian Ice... pretty much anything homemade. Who else makes their items by hand? DEFINITELY not Portillo&#39;s.

Anyone that complains about the food here should put their head in a toilet and flush it a couple of times because you are full of number 2! You 1 star people are use to McDonald&#39;s and always eatin a Mc this or a Mc that but seriously you are full of McS(beeeep)t or a McTootsie Roll to be politically correct in this crazy world! Don&#39;t get your panties in a bunch like they already are you 1 star people.

Now to the food: The food is absolutely delicious! No matter what you eat here. I&#39;ve eaten at 5 star restaurants and went okay this suck&#39;s worse than eating an ingrown toenail on a Friday night sitting on the couch alone watching Netflix. 

The food here is amazing plain an simple! The homemade meatballs are so deliciously delicious that you would think you died and went to heaven and saw Mother Theresa doing the Irish gig that is how good the meat a balls are. 

Let&#39;s get to the Tri-tip sandwich! All I will say is dear mother of moooooskies the owners take pride in their cooking and it shows... 

To the 1 stars that don&#39;t know anything about home-cut French fries. This place gives you a pound of freaking delicious French Fries, are you kidding me? 1 star complains about ohhh they don&#39;t have cheese sauce! Well sweetheart you want cheese for your fries than GO MILK A GOAT AND PUT YELLOW #7 IN IT IF YOU WANT YOUR DAMN CHEESE FRY SAUCE! The other 1 star complains about how small the fries were, are you kidding me? The fries are so huge even John Holmes would approve!

The Italian Ice... I don&#39;t have to drive in the city anymore! It is homemade and oooooh so delicious!

Now to the 1 stars that complain about the hours... You don&#39;t make the rules! They do! You don&#39;t pay taxes on their property they do. Read the hours of operation, they are closed at 7pm! Do you 1 stars think you can go into your local McDonalds and say hey I know your closing but I want a McDouble... The workers will give you 2 McFingers as they&#39;re kicking your McA** out! So don&#39;t complain about the hours of operation. 

This is a family owned restaurant! They are a good family and I don&#39;t even know them. The food is incredible for the price and running a restaurant that has quality food made by quality chefs speaks volumes on what they are feeding us...

Ohhh...To the 1 star that claims the parking suck&#39;s and he doesn&#39;t want to be a fatality. Well genius open your eyeballs and put toothpicks in them if you can&#39;t see cars in their parking lot!!! Even Stevie Wonder can see that the parking lot is small and it has always been small because you brain never visited Jimmy&#39;s place! The parking lot hasn&#39;t changed in over 50 years!

Last thing... You won&#39;t be disappointed folks! They are new in the business and like everything else in life it takes time to work the kinks out but seriously I&#39;ve seen worse in established restaurants... This family is awesome and love their community and that is the most important.. 

1 star people have no idea what it is like to run a business! They throw rocks at other people&#39;s businesses and think it is cute to write a negative review on someones hard work when it is simply not true. I&#39;m sorry that you keyboard commandos feel compelled and oh so powered to write garbage when you never ran a restaurant! I hope you feel better now that you did that because at the end of the day you live a miserable life in your glass house but want to cast stones on others when your claims are not valid...

My daughter ordered the signature cheeseburger. She&#39;s a cheeseburger snob and but it got the thumbs up!

And to call it a hot dog place would be like calling the Chicago Marathon a stroll down the city streets with a few friends.  This place has freshly made food from scratch, like the tamales, meatballs, Italian ice, and dessert pies. 

I&#39;ve been anxious for this place to open because I&#39;ve been passing it for years and watching its transformation. So when I saw some cars in the parking lot tonight I stopped in for a quick meal.  Rocco, one of the owners, was so friendly and welcoming, but apologized that he is still a week from officially opening.  When he saw my disappointment he immediately said, &#34;I made meatballs.  Would you like some?&#34;  I asked if I could take it to go and he said, &#34;I&#39;ll make you a sandwich.&#34;  He couldn&#39;t have been nicer.  I could tell he&#39;s very excited to share his food with people.  After he wrapped up the sandwich, he said, &#34;Come try some of my homemade Italian ice!&#34;  There were 2 couples in the restaurant and we all went over to the case and got a serving.  I got his lemon ice and it was wonderful!  When I got home I ate the meatball sandwich.  I love Italian food and rarely am disappointed when I eat it. It&#39;s such a comfort food for me. So even when it&#39;s so-so, I enjoy it. But every so often there is the Italian food that stands far above the rest. Regina&#39;s on Campbell and Vail (now Carlos &amp; Carlos) used to have that kind of Italian food. Great red sauces, fresh ingredients and handmade all kindza stuff.  Ever since Regina&#39;s closed I&#39;ve been looking for that kind of spectacular tasting Italian food. Well when I took the first bite of the meatball sandwich I realized I&#39;d found it again. The red sauce on the meatballs was so good I wanted to rush back and get more.  It has a flavor that makes you want to put it in a bowl, tear off a piece of fresh bread and eat it like soup!  

I&#39;m so excited to know this place is more of an improvement than just the building and decor. I know it will be a frequent stop for me. My only hope is that Rocco will offer his sauce in containers to go!",26/05/16,243,5,2,5,11,6.884500000000001,4.468,1.0819999999999999,23.45,No,2172

I was a little nervous ordering their signature burger - no lettuce and tomatoes here! Instead they have a spicy Dijon mayo/mustard, pickles, and minced red onion. I honestly wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d like it since I generally am not a fan of those things. But my mother in law had been to Big Ange&#39;s before us and told me she had the same reservations but I had to try it and I&#39;d change my mind. After the first bite I knew she was right. Every day since then I swear I have dreamed of that burger. It is absolutely delicious, and the toppings are perfect, I wouldn&#39;t change a thing!

The fries are plentiful and delicious (you can easily share between 2 or 3 people). They are those nice, substantial fries that still have a little skin on them, and they are cooked perfectly. 

The lemonade is incredible - with a blend of oranges and lemons it&#39;s like nothing you&#39;ve had before.

My father in law had a meatball sub and my husband had a beef and gave rave reviews for each, but I honestly don&#39;t know if I can stray from my delicious burger to try anything else.

Save room for Italian Ice! It&#39;s homemade and there are a bunch of different flavors to choose from.

The good:
The burger is great. 
$3.25 for a hot dog and good fries is a great deal.
Fries are really good as long as you are eating in.
All the flavors of homemade ices made with fresh fruit.
The ambiance inside and the outdoor space outside.

The bad:
The service is pretty bad...they have no idea how to handle a rush, and if you&#39;re taking your food to go be sure you check your bags or you will be back for whatever it is they forgot.
They need to toast the sandwich buns.
The fries are a soggy mess if you take your food to go.

The three of us all had vastly different amounts of fries.The fries were also inconsistently cooked, some white and mushy inside, and some very dark.

The decor is conflicted. They have a 50&#39;s pastel palette on the walls, but the staff wear primary colors and the artwork is a mix of blues musicians and what looks like Caribbean inspired art. No music playing, even though they have music notes painted on the walls.

Tamales are homemade and authentic. The tri tip sandwich is filled with tender slices of beef and the potato roll they serve it on is soft and fresh. The burgers are cooked perfectly, comes with their own special sauce and you can add bacon :) whatever the sauce is it is tasty. 

They always have specials, this last time we.visited we picked up a lb of rib tips, soooo good, better than most BBQ joints I&#39;ve visited, they season everything perfectly. My husband also got the BBQ brisket sandwich special, filled with tender meat just like the tri tip was! 

AND they also have homemade deserts,different options both times we have visited. The peach cobbler was to die for, they topped it with fresh whipped cream too!

&#34;Thing&#34;,...the essence of food made with love.
What I tasted was an eggplant parm. sandwich that was succulent and tasted like it was made by my Italian Mama!
The marinara sauce had the most soothing end taste notes,that brought a satisfying smile to my face.
Very yummy and very satisfying.

The hand cut fries, doubled fried the old school way,tasted great. Just the right amount of soaked oil but not greasy to the touch. They were served in a brown lunch bag, old school presentation.

I had a Lemmon Italian ice. It was very good. It looked and tasted homemade. I wished it was made with a lot less lemon rind bits. The rind bits were a little overwhelming.

The omvionce of the resturant was awesome. I enjoyed the modern yet nostalgic vibe as I savored my lunch. The bathroom well decorated that reminded me of my rich Aunt&#39;s powder room. lol

I look forward to tasting and enjoying another lunch there soon.

Delicious food with abundant portions at an economical price.  

I had the meatball sandwich which was perfect.  Just enough sauce to need a few extra napkins.  The 3 meatballs could have been by themselves, they were done great and didn&#39;t need the sauce to bring them back to life.  The sauce was a good balance of tomato and seasoning not too sweet or acidic.  I&#39;m picky as I have Taylor Street as my local Italian food.  Fresh cut fries which were just crispy on the outside, the portion is great to share which we did.  Finished it off with a cantaloupe Italian ice, refreshing and oh so yummy.  

Others in our group had the Italian beef with sweet peppers, I&#39;m getting that next time, it looked mouth watering good.  Polish sausage with caramelized onions.  Cheeseburger with the works.  They group sampled more of the eight flavors of Italian ice.  All of us walked away stuffed and happy with our choices and thinking about next time. 

The decor is light and airy which helped to detract from watching the Cubs loss on the muted big screen tv.  Tunes in the background were at the right balance to give energy to the place without overwhelming our conversation.  

Staff were friendly, helpful, and conscientious about environment.

Went in this evening around 6:30 pm and it was hopping. First problem you have to walk through seated diners to get to register. There was a wait so some kid was giving out free samples of Italian ice and then randomly stopped. Guy at register totally confused overwhelmed etc. I think the owner was ready to leave but had to step in. Then one of the family I think who was schmoozing guests tells his friends in line to sit tight and then buts in and orders for him. Lots and lots of schmoozing. Wait time 8 minutes. 

I order hot dogs with no mustard or relish and they say so just onions and hot peppers? I said what about tomato and pickles? Nope don&#39;t have long pickles, tomato or celery salt. Fries are over $3 comes with fries whether you want them or not. I ordered two tamales sorry no tamales. I ordered the prime rib sandwich with fried onions, but it was $9 and no fries? 

Hot dogs made immediately and sat and sat while some old guy hand cut the prime rib very slowly. Wait time 13 minutes. 

Get the food home and hot dogs were ok, fries good, prime rib delicious.

big-anges-eatery-arlington-heights,Daniel M.,z83LwhmSDUCr6ZcB6XnY6Q,N5XTYcc6Sz_xZuv6BPI2cA,"Like many others, we watched Big Ange&#39;s Eatery change from the old Jimmy&#39;s Place to this wonderful find of a restaurant over the past 3+ years.  They said they would open before the Cubs won their next World Series, and they did it, Big Ange&#39;s that is.  I do think the Cubs will do it this year also.

My wife and I came here on opening day.  It was fabulous. Everything we had, the Italian Porchetta Pork Sandwich, Beef and Sausage Combo, fries, their homemade lemonade (a blend of lemons and oranges, really different and great tasting), meatball sample and Italian Ice samples were all excellent, no complaints at all.

The inside decor is very light, lively and easy on the eyes.  You can see owner&#39;s Ang and John&#39;s music background with many photos of local bands and a nice sampling of guitars up on the walls.  Reminded me a bit of a mini Hard Rock Cafe.  Even the restroom was great, big, and attractive looking.  The music playing in the background throughout the restaurant was really nice also, good selections, loud enough, but not too loud.  The outside landscaping is excellent looking.  Looks like it has been there for years.  

The restaurant had to close after the first day as they were overwhelmed with customers and ran out of food, first day.  They replenished and reopened after 4 days, also with additional employees to handle the crowds.

I went back today for a takeout order.  The place was comfortably crowded, midafternoon, after lunch time, before dinner time. Today we ordered combos again, hot dog, tamale and fries.  The hot dog was great, nice taste, a good snap to the skin, Vienna for sure. The tamale was really unique.  Here is from their menu...&#34;Handmade &#34;In House&#34; (Pork tamale with smoked green chilies and avocado salsa, wrapped in corn husk)&#34;.  I don&#39;t think I have ever had a better one, even from very authentic Mexican restaurants. 

The entire staff is super friendly.

Make sure to stop if in the area, or even somewhat nearby, you will be glad you did.

Best wishes to Ang, John and their son Rocco.  You guys have a winner here.

The Last person in this line was very nice which made this ordering more palatable.

Rubbing his pants, chair, hugging his friends, he was wearing his plastic food serving gloves while with his friends. (which look like they have been on for serval hours, should be changed every 20-30 minutes). While I did not follow him back in to the cook line, I&#39;m sure he changed his gloves?

Unlike my former school teachers I&#39;ve decided to opt for the higher number. The employees (owners) seem to be quite sincere about making a go of the business.

I had their double cheeseburger (which they call a &#34;signature cheeseburger&#34;, fries and a tamale. Everything seemed fresh and made to order. The cheeseburger was passable, no more. While a rung above your typical chain fast food burger, the meat just wasn&#39;t very tasty. I did like the fact that they allowed me to substitute a thick onion slice for their standard minced onions. Also, the patties are rather small, just slightly bigger than a McDonald&#39;s junior patty.

The fresh cut fries were very good, flavorful and nicely cooked. The rather unusual pork tamale was also quite good, if a bit pricey.

Their service was friendly and fairly efficient. Others have mentioned the tiny and cramped parking lot which is a serious issue (an accident waiting to happen for every visit).

I ordered the California turkey. It was delicious. Everything was very fresh and in perfect proportions. The avocado made this sandwich, along with the Breadsmith cracked wheat bread.

Everything tastes better when someone else makes it, Smitty&#39;s is the perfect example of this.

The bread is fresh from Breadsmith and IMHO a sandwich is only as good as its bread - the cracked wheat we had was fantastic!  We both split the turkey berry and the tuna fish sandwiches (substituting out the croissant).  

I have to say the tuna was fine but not exceptional - though I personally prefer my bread toasted for tuna fish and I usually like a little crunch which was missing.

The turkey berry was absolutely fantastic! I will be returning for this sandwich, especially since it is so convenient to grab and enjoy a nice picnic along the river.  Excellent proportion between all the ingredients - including the bread.

In a world (okay in the Tri-cities) where the only places you can find a &#34;real&#34; sandwich are Panera and Corner Bakery (freshly made with 800 heavy greasy calories), Smitty&#39;s should practically be sainted. 

Unless you make your own sandwiches at home, there is no other place to have a fresh, simple sandwich. That said, there are options on the menu at Smitty&#39;s that are catered to the &#34;million-ingredient&#39; people, and sometimes that really does make a delicious sandwich. But what I love most is that they let you make it your own way! 

You can have one of their pre-determined sandwiches, the Annika, the Turkey Berry, or the Groucho (a grilled panini for my meat lovin&#39; man) are all good choices. Breads are soft, fresh and make you remember what real food tastes like.

The menu offers a wide variety of sandwiches from grilled to cold to Panini&#39;s. They also have a lot of different soda selections in bottles, like flavored cream soda and root beer. I ordered a panini that was &#34;muffalatta&#34; style and it was good. The bread smith focaccia was flaky and delicious , but not firm enough to hold all the sandwich had so it got kind of digger toward the end. But it was still good. My boyfriend ordered the California Turkey which was the main reason for my three star review. It tasted like a plain turkey sandwich you could make at home, the bread was soft and ingredients fresh but just not Great like we expected. Another disappointing factor that contributed to the 3 starts is the lack of hot peppers and hot sauce, hey only had jalapeos and that&#39;s disappointing for a sandwich place.

Locally made breads with fresh ingredients!  My sandwich was an Italian type combo and came on locally made focaccia.  Delicious.  My wife had a turkey sandwich and that was tasty as well.  Unfortunately they were out of their home made soups. If they are anywhere near as good as the sammies then there&#39;s a reason they sold out.

It is interesting that the meaning of Omega is the end as this will likely be the last time I come to Omega. This place has always had a place in my heart when I think of dining. I first went to the location in Niles Illinois which was a great supper restaurant. Their meals would always include a wonderful breadbasket, a hearty soup, a menu that had many items that changed daily, and a dessert. I recently came back here for lunch and found it a little bit disappointing. It will a lot of the desserts had changed there was no longer the strawberry cheesecake but a lot of different pies and premade. The breadbasket was still nice however what was missing was the long crackers and other type of fresh pastries. Don&#39;t get me wrong the price is very cheap for the food you get. I ordered a Philly steak sandwich and I&#39;m not exactly sure what I got. It came out on a garlic bread roll which gave it a very weird taste. In addition the Philly steak was not sliced well, it was very chewy and difficulty eating.I usually look forward to the soup which was a beef and barley soup however it was so salty that it was barely edible. The server was still nice sort of like the old diner charm however it did not make up for the type of food they served. I don&#39;t think I will be back based on this eating experience any longer

Pros: Low price, traditional diner experience, and you can make your meal a complete meal including dessert and coffee for an additional fee

Cons: The food is no longer good in my opinion

Hidden deals:
They have a menu that changes every day with the menu insert. There&#39;s also daily specials",12/01/16,178,1,1,2,7,1.4733999999999998,1.228,0.8620000000000001,11.909,No,1650

The busboys kept asking to take our dishes away while we were still eating. We tried to explain that they came to our table over 8 times in a 5 minute period. It really upset my wife to the point she got up and left.The manager&#39;s response was not at all comforting.  He said it&#39;s hard to get good help. I left thinking they are not going to fix this. Even the waitress said the busboys should be assigned to certain tables and not have each one (5 of them) pollenating each table over and over.

I will not return. An upsetting experience.

BTW, I was really happy to find a single piece of clam in my bowl of clam chowder. Whippy!! I thought by mistake they gave me cream of potato soup.

I did come here last week for dinner, though. We only came here because they were having a fundraising night for the school I work at: 50% of the bill (before taxes) would be donated to the school PTA. Since I live so close, I figured... why not?

We were pleasantly surprised at the large bread basket they placed on the table. I love bread. I eat too much bread. I ate too much bread here. The bread was good!

My husband ordered a burger and I ordered a veggie melt sandwich. Both came with soup. I had the french onion soup since the two other soups had meat in them. I&#39;m not really a fan of french onion. This one was good. I think. I&#39;ve never had it before so I wasn&#39;t sure what to compare it to, but it&#39;s definitely not a soup I&#39;d pick in the future if I have other options.

When my meal arrived, I was shocked at how large it was and how it wasn&#39;t a sandwich at all. The two slices of bread were side by side with large amounts of avocado and cheese draped over them. If you need to know something about me and food, I just CANNOT stand the sight of mounds of white, melted cheese draped over food. I was already repulsed. And the slices simply could not be put together as a sandwich. Disappointed, I cut a piece of the bread off anyway and tried it. YE-UCK! The Swiss cheese on top was mixed with Cesar dressing -- two of my not-so-preferred options mixed together just made me want to puke. I couldn&#39;t eat this.

When the waitress came back, I told her, &#34;Um... I don&#39;t really like this. At all.&#34; She promptly went to speak to a manager, came back, grabbed my plate, and told me I could order something else off the menu. OK, cool. I ordered an entree with breaded fish and a side of veggies. This meal came after my husband already finished his, but the fish was good! The veggies were OK -- I took them home. They&#39;re actually still sitting in my fridge. Oops! Our bill was about $25. Our waitress was really sweet and gracious throughout the whole meal(s) and we were thankful for that, too.

I have no desire to come back here simply because it just isn&#39;t my scene and I prefer other spots for breakfast and dinner. However, I was really impressed with their customer service and the prices weren&#39;t too bad. I can understand why people like to come here.",21/01/13,278,3,3,5,76,4.112,5.631999999999999,1.8070000000000002,33.562,No,2412

The short summary is that Omega is an exceptional &#34;greasy spoon&#34; type restaurant with a typical menu adequately prepared. But on top of that they do have a very nice selection of baked goods for dessert.   The portion size almost guarantees that you will be taking food home with you. The other thing that sets them apart is the service. The service lifts this 3-star restaurant up to 4 stars. 

I went to lunch with about 9 other people right at noon.  Reservations had been made in advance and the staff was ready for us. The group kind of trickled in. As each person arrived he or she was promptly greeted and a drink order taken and delivered. Other places I have eaten would not even have seated such a group until all parties were present. 

One of the ladies expressed an interest in the fried chicken. As this takes longer to prepare than other dishes, the waitress wisely polled the others in the group to see who else might be ordering the chicken.  She then passed word to the kitchen before taking the remaining orders. This resulted in all the food arriving at the sane time with no long wait. 

With the exception of the chicken, which smelled phenomenal, the food was ordinary, but plentiful and attractively presented.  There were some comments about the temperature of some of the hot dishes, including the tepid soup that I personally ordered. But everything was edible and nobody was vocally upset with their meal.

I really wanted to like Omega House.  The people seem nice.  They heaped a lot of food into the breakfast skillet (enough for 3 people).

I would rather pay extra for them changing their cooking grease / oil more.  I ended up giving this to our dog and I&#39;m not a picky eater.

I don&#39;t honestly know what grease or oil they are cooking with but it ruined their food, twice.  Yes the food looked appetizing, fresh, arranged nicely but again, use old, rancid cooking oil and it will ruin the flavor.

My wife and I would take are teen boys there couple times a month. We had no problems at first. The last couple times we went the service was very slow. My wife would ask what&#39;s taking so long and they would say something like &#34;oh we sent people home cause its a slow night, one of the cooks called in sick.&#34; So the last time we were there about a week ago. We ordered food, again it took forever to get are orders. My son had a buuflo chicken wrap, it was stone cold. We called the waitress over, he told her it was cold. She said let me get the manager. The manager ( a old guy) came over and asked what the problem was. My wife and son both told him it was cold. He proceeded to say &#34; I should have known you were going to complain about something.

omega-restaurant-schaumburg,Rachel B.,erdFs4hYpGivU2PbEcw1WQ,lFI17mURFgM1n8ScgK27NQ,"Meh. That&#39;s all I really have to say about Omega.  I haven&#39;t been there since I was little so I figured I&#39;d give it another try.  My co-workers and I were craving a breakfast for lunch type of thing and Omega is only a couple blocks away from our office so we decided to order from there.  The takeout was super fast.  We had three meals and they said it&#39;d be about 15 minutes and it was ready promptly at the 15 minute mark.  

My co-worker order the turkey island melt which I was also debating on getting, she said the bread was horrible, it looked like a soggy mess, but everything else was okay.  I ordered the Delicate Suzette Crepes French Toasty that was covered in strawberries and an orange sauce.  They were just okay.  There was a large amount for what you pay but nothing special.  I don&#39;t know if its because my sister spoils me with amazingly delicious crepes or if these were just not that good.  I also ordered hash browns which were abnormally dry and tasteless.  I know potatoes don&#39;t taste like much anyways but these were not good.  I only took a couple bites.  My other coworker seemed to enjoy his food - eggs, toasty, hash browns, and bacon.  I tried the bacon and it was pretty good.  

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go to Omega - there&#39;s a breakfast place on the same street that&#39;s better.  But, I would eat from here again if we ordered.  Definitely would try something different.

Most of the time it is breakfast. Experience for this is pretty good. Decent food. Good service, prices are fine. I like the omlettes or skillets. The pancakes are good too. Avoid the bread basket, because who knows what the previous customers have done to it? Waitresses here are very good. Even the busboys have stepped up and refilled coffee or water.

However, on my last visit, my wife and I went in for dinner. The manager was on the phone by the entrance. We stood there, waiting to be seated, while he was talking and talking. He didnt acknowledge us (not a good start). Finally, we were about to be seated. They had closed the back area off. There was a larger group with a noisy child. Because of this, we asked him if we could be seated in the first booth on the other side. He explained that it was closed. My wife asked me &#34;do you want to go somewhere else?&#34; (loud enough for him to hear) and I said &#34;yea, I dont want to sit near that noise.&#34; (he heard this, too)

As soon as they realized that people loved their soup and would take it home in quarts, they DOUBLED the price.  So, we just don&#39;t go that often anymore.

Today I went to lunch there with my daughter because we both had a taste for soup.  The server brought me a bowl of chicken shell soup.  1/2 way through my bowl I felt something sharp and pretty big in my mouth, (thought I broke a tooth!!!) and spit it out to find a CHICKEN BONE!!!  YIKES.

I brought it to the attention of the server and could tell that she went to tell the owners but they had no intention of doing anything about it.

When I went to pay the bill, the owner asked if everything was O.K. I told her all but the chicken bone I found in my soup.  She said (unsympathetic) &#34;did she bring you another one?&#34;. I said, &#34;NO, I wouldn&#39;t want another one!!!&#34;  If one bowl has a bone in the same batch, wouldn&#39;t they all?????

Funny thing is,,,on my way in I saw a &#34;YELP likes us&#34; sticker posted on their door!!  LOL

I&#39;ve eaten here on plenty of weekend mornings so this was not a surprise. We were seated within a totally acceptable timeframe and promptly placed our orders. The waitress was very nice and as responsive as she could be with the number of tables she had. After about 45 minutes, we flagged her down as we hadn&#39;t received our meals. She advised the kitchen did not make one of the four meals that were ordered and the chef was fighting with her about it. Shortly thereafter, 3 of the 4 meals arrived. They were cold. The waitress then delivered the 4th meal and we advised the other meals were cold. She apologized and said she could reheat them. We declined as we had to be somewhere shortly. She advised she would send the manager over. Rita, the manager, then comes over to the table. She first blames the waitress for the issues with our food. As this point, we don&#39;t care what the reason is and a manger pushing blame seems ridiculous. She then mildly apologizes as she walks away saying &#34;I&#39;ll give you a discount&#34;. Her response was incredibly disappointing. Regardless of the reason, it seems inappropriate for the manager to put blame on someone else. I&#39;ve worked in the service industry.

I have been coming here for a long time and as of recently, they have really been slacking. I actually have their number saved in my cell so I can call ahead and check on the soups for that day. Yes, I base my decision as to whether to go their or not, on the soup. I&#39;m a picky PITA that way.  The soup lately has been lacking. Normally, its overflowing with delectable veggies and nice chucks of beef or chicken (depending on the soup) and over the past few months, the soup has just been unsatisfying. The bread has a tenancy to be old. I should really find out what day they get their bread and head over that day. Their cream of chicken soup never really has disappointed me except that sometimes the amount of chicken is lacking.

The food is always pretty good. I typically order the Grecian chicken breast with rice pilaf and veggies with my bowl of soup. The chicken is always perfect- no joke. They got that down to a science. The rice is fine but the veggies are always soggy and mushy no matter what time of day it is. [as I write this, I&#39;m wondering why we still go here????]. My boyfriend orders the Chicken stir fry- I know...I don&#39;t know why, but it&#39;s actually pretty good and the veggies are much better than what comes on my plate.

If you so desire, two buttermilk pancakes may be substituted for toast or potatoes. I always go for the pancakes ((best to sop up an alcohol belly)). And all this for about $6.50. Nice and cheap! 

Service is, you know, standard diner service. I like to put it as &#34;it is what it is&#34;. The servers don&#39;t love their jobs and they sometimes dish out more than just food ((like &#39;tudes)). And you typically have to have your water refilled. However, service is usually quite fast which is a plus.

Overall, it&#39;s not the greatest breakfast spot in the Schaumburg area, but in a pinch ((or with a hangover)) Omega does the job.",12/04/12,146,3,1,1,-2,0.6492000000000001,1.1420000000000001,0.46199999999999997,16.396,No,1167

Omega is, yes, Greek owned and awesome. I love it even more because it is located next to my mechanic. 8:00am Saturday tire rotation appointment? Nooo problem! Let me just drop my car off and eat my sleep-deprived feelings away.

Their breakfast is unbelievable and generously portioned. My fave? The Hobo Skillet w/eggs over-easy (don&#39;t knock it, til you try it). Their daily specials are also fabulous, so if you are unsure what to get, don&#39;t hesitate to refer to those.

Its only down-side is that it gets pretty busy, so if you are hungry, have some extra pieces of bread and butter while you wait. I&#39;m not going to lie, though, I can&#39;t wait to get my oil changed in a month.",01/10/11,98,4,1,4,-19,3.0941,2.536,0.981,8.483,No,803

better barbecued ribs than actual rib joints? The full slab of
ribs I enjoyed at Omega were meaty and tender and smothered
in a tangy barbecue sauce...unbelievable.

I have also enjoyed more standard fare at Omega, including
omelettes, pancakes, the Buffalo Chicken wrap, and
Broiled Whitefish, which were outstanding.

Coffee is always good and being refilled by a friendly staff--
and the hostess always welcomes me like family.

And the Beef Barley Soup on Tuesdays...always hits the spot!

Bugs in the salad, OK as disgusting as that sounds, it is really understandable. Being given a bread basket with a piece of bread already bitten. Hmm, still didn&#39;t complain since mistakes do happen, but on my last visit, this was definitely the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. Had my heart set on potato pancakes, and they had a special, so definitely was excited to order my favorite. Normally I enjoy the potato pancakes, but on this occasion, I am disgusted and in pure shock at the decline of quality and service of this once great restaurant. While on my second bite, I bit into a metal string. Yes, a metal, not plastic string. I cannot put into words exactly what my thoughts were at that moment. My friend called over the waitress who wanted to take away the plate but i requested a manager. Although our waitress was very apologetic, the service from her was great I cannot say the same about whoever the supposedly new manager was. Yes he apologized, yes he explained what the metal piece is, which by the way is a scrubber to clean the grill with. He said he&#39;d take it off the bill and walked away. Our waitress came back to our table and was very apologetic and offered me something else, of course i declined. than again offered an apology and said the whole meal was on them. Okay great, but was it her responsibility or the manager to apologize, offer something else or tell us our meal was on them? i cannot or will not in my right mind come back here again or even recommend it to anyone.",25/04/13,180,1,2,5,43,4.1528,2.563,0.525,13.912000000000003,No,1646

omega-restaurant-schaumburg,Renee G.,7Pzu-X5K5kN8kXVs8ZZKGA,pGt-k538_AuR1dHZwU0wjA,"We decided to go here for dinner on a Sunday night around 6 pm with three friends.  Our friends had been here before but this was our first time.  We were seated very quickly and our waitress came over very quickly to take our drink orders even though the place was pretty busy.  We looked over the menu and the specials for the night and two of us decided on the Pork Tenderloin specials, and the other two got the Roast Leg of Lamb.  Our waitress, who looked like she&#39;s been at this for a long while, was an absolute doll!  She absolutely knew how to take care of her customers.  I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t catch her name.  Our food came out, and our waitress brought the sauce for the Leg of Lamb on the side, saying that not everyone likes it on the meat.  Thank God she did that!  The leg of lamb was excellent, very tender and well flavored, but the sauce had absolutely no taste at all of any kind and was overly salty!  The Pork Tenderloin was breaded, which was not in the menu description, and again overly salty.  The dinners came with soups and deserts.  I had the carrot cake which was huge and very good, all the others had spumoni ice cream which was....well ice cream.  The food, meaning soups and entree&#39;s could use much less salt.  I felt like the cook was trying to sabotage the owner&#39;s business by over salting everything.  If you go there, ask for no salt on your entree&#39;s and you might luck out.

This place deserves 5 stars for our waitress and 3 stars for our food due to the saltiness of the food.  I gained 2-1/2 pounds overnight...yep water retention due to salt!  Try it once and tell them to ease off on the salt and see if it works.  We will give them another try and ask them to take it easy on the salt.",21/02/14,191,3,2,5,23,4.8142000000000005,2.8280000000000003,0.787,16.385,No,1751

Good portions, I might add. I had the crepes with strawberries with a side of Canadian bacon. My husband had steak and eggs, with a side of pancake and hash browns. He devoured everything except for the pancake. I took home half of my order plus the pancake. We were stuffed.

On our way out while my hubby was paying, I noticed there were sweets displayed by the entrance. They had quite a variety of sweets, but since there was baklava, I decided to order two slices to take home. After the lady placed each of the baklavas in two small plastic containers, one of the containers fell &amp; I noticed the slices were smaller than the usual slices I normally get from other bakeries. I was ticked that the lady didn&#39;t place the 2 containers in a bag in the first place. To top it off, when I was ready to pay for them, the guy informs me that the charge for the two slices was $7.22. I couldn&#39;t believe they charged $3+ for a small slice of baklava! I had to repeat the price he mentioned and the guy asked me if I ever had baklava before. Like I haven&#39;t had one before. Note to self: Go to Caputo&#39;s on Lake St. next time I have a taste for baklava. I can get four big slices for the price I&#39;m getting charged here.

Growing their own veggies, hops, brewing their own beer, smoking and casing their own meat. I can go on...

We put our trust in the extremely knowledgeable wait staff, and ordered the Large Charcuterie board. The chef chose the meats and cheeses including a super farmhousey blue, truffle cheese, lamb face, and smoked duck.  The duck was like meat sashimi, barely cooked but buttery and delicate. 

The restaurant concept, design and menu is straight out of northern California or Eugene Oregon. My group was so excited at the unique offerings and we plan on going back next week for a smoke duck dinner, elk, and the newly released beers.

It just sat there, getting cold, as we tried to locate someone to tell them it wasn&#39;t ours.

Based on my experience, I didn&#39;t have any long wait issues like other yelpers did. Their food is good and they want to be a fancy small plate restaurant but something is falling a little short. Some of the dishes I had felt like they had too many flavors going on at once and then others did not have enough. I know they&#39;ll find their happy medium eventually. I&#39;m curious to go back in a few months and see how things have changed.

Since they make their own beer, I decided to give that a try. I think I&#39;d pass on the beer next time and just do cocktails. I tried 4 different ones and I wasn&#39;t a fan of any of them.

We&#39;ve been fans of the Turf Room for a long time and have been dying for Hardware to open. We finally made our way over this weekend.

The wow factor for this restaurant is the facility itself. A wall with greens growing on it? Yes! Herbs growing in the outdoor patio area - yes! It&#39;s a gorgeous place. 

The service was very good. The servers are passionate about the concept and they&#39;re knowledgeable. They&#39;re attentive and not obnoxious. They know the menu. Clearly, Hardware has spent time on training the front of the house.

What keeps me from giving a 4 or 5 star review is the food. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food is interesting and diverse. What it is lacking is flavor. We had pig face Terrine and it was, quite frankly, bland. If you&#39;ve been to Girl and The Goat, Pigface is out of this world. Hardware can do better. 

We also had goat cheese and it was wonderful. Korean Pork Belly was good, but it can be better. Once again, flavors. One item we ate that had pretty good flavors was the cauliflower dish. We also had foie gras sausage with lentils. It was just &#34;okay&#34;.

hardware-north-aurora-5,Jim K.,0mgZF0Z0JGRrbfSXjp3XRQ,oYTbLMc8sKVz-4gkX-c1SQ,"My lovely wife and I paid our first visit to Hardware last night for dinner.  Being die-hard fans of The Turf Room since they opened, we heard about the concept early on and watched the building grow out of the corn fields when we&#39;d pass by.

The outdoor patio was really packed when we arrived, and it was cool to see the herbs and hops and fruit trees growing around the property.  I love fresh figs, grew up in a house that had a fig tree in the back yard, and I was delighted to see all of the immature figs growing by the entrance in front of an entire wall of greens.  We opted to sit inside, however, since it was still pretty humid from all of the recent rain.

The bar is gorgeous, the dining room smallish, and it was fascinating to see the owner in the attached greenhouse, working on planting rows and rows of house greens. The low ceilings made the rooms pretty loud, so loud that it was hard to hear our server when he came up to introduce himself.  

Drink orders were placed, rum and DC for the lady, though no Bacardi to be had here, she settled on a Taildragger Dark rum that was delicious with immediate molasses notes but packed a punch.  I was happy to see a Sazerac as one of the featured cocktails, and as it turns out, it&#39;s one of the bartender&#39;s favorites as well.  It was superb, although it took a rather long time between placing the order and when they arrived.  At least a big wine bottle of water was set down right after we were seated.

Our first food choice was the medium charcuterie board, three meats and three cheese with accompaniments.  It was one of the best boards we&#39;ve had anywhere, with capicola, duck bacon and lamb sausage all house made.  It was hard to hear the names of the cheeses, but they were delicious as well.  We cleaned the board in short order and moved on.

A second round of drinks took a while to appear again, as our server had his hands full with several other tables in the dining room.

Next came the octopus and the pork sausage pancakes.  The octopus was scrumptious, great grilled flavor and very tender, on top of a nice salad of sweet potato, mushrooms and lovely green beans.  The pancakes were good, nice bacony flavor with a blueberry reduction, but something that we might not order again.

That might seem like a lot of food so far, but the small plate sharing concept let us sample a couple more choices to complete our meal.  The Chicago poutine was excellent, a little short on gravy but made up for nicely by the runny fried egg on top.  This was a pretty filling item, and the giardinera that came with it was a nice sharp contrast to the potatoes and cheese curds.  Our final choice was Parker&#39;s Sticky Chicken, the chicken thighs done nice and tender and falling off the bone, but the sticky mango sauce was lacking something, perhaps a little acid note to balance the sweetness.  Maybe the green onion kimchee that came with it needs to ferment a little longer.

Our final bill came to around what we&#39;d normally pay for a full meal at The Turf Room, so we did a nice sampling across the menu.

For a place that&#39;s only been open seven weeks, the food was darn good but the service needs some tweaking.  Each course was paced so that our small table was never overcrowded, but just a touch too slow as there were times when either a drink refill or the next course should have appeared.

No doubt it will get better with time, as did The Turf Room, and we&#39;ll be back to see.",31/07/16,405,4,3,5,62,11.239500000000001,4.159000000000001,0.506,23.335999999999995,No,3488

hardware-north-aurora-5,Shevon R.,S2xVq_56n25pP0IhjQwMYQ,tX3uah5Qssz7q7R6MWroDQ,"My husband has been practically drooling while anxiously awaiting the opening of this place.  We were passing by at about 11:30 last Saturday night and decided to check it out.  We had 5 minutes before the kitchen closed, so we ordered the Chicago Poutine appetizer.  It was good.  Large wedge fries, a slice of their housemade bacon, giardiniera, cheese curds, and a fried egg.  There weren&#39;t very many cheese curds on it and the fries were a little too big, but the taste was very good.

My husband got a sample flight of beers.  He was disappointed and said he would just get something else next time.  That&#39;s kind of sad when your house beers are not as good as others on the menu.  I was the DD so just had water.  For a sample flight of 4 beers and the Poutine it was about $18.  I didn&#39;t think it was so bad, but we didn&#39;t have a full meal.

The decor is interesting and, according to the bartender, everything in the place has a story behind it.  The bathrooms are weird, just like the Turf Room.  They are in a small hallway with about 5 doors.  Each door says different things like Rest Room, Janitor&#39;s Closet, Classroom, etc.  They are all individual bathrooms, so don&#39;t wait for the one that actually says Restroom on it.  They also have an area that had sausages hanging and I am assuming you can view them making sausages in the front area.  I would suggest that they keep that area tidy even if it is right before closing.  I went to look at it and someone&#39;s jacket was on the table. There was also a shelf with spices, etc. on it, that was messy looking.

I wouldn&#39;t take my children here.  It&#39;s higher priced and unless you have a foodie kid, they will not be happy with their choices.  The best part of this visit was my receipt. I happened to look at it today and under name it said, Shivan/Dick.  Bwahaha.  My name is Shevon, so close enough.

hardware-north-aurora-5,Nicole R.,Jwrg76eZGjridhYE_E3EqQ,ymoX3yV-EIPEzmnwEasAXA,"We went into our dinner a little skeptical. We had heard things like the menu was not great, it was way too expensive, too pretentious and overall was not worth it. We heard that from people we knew and of course Yelp was filled with similar comments. But we went anyway and man I am glad I did. This is not dinner at Chili&#39;s or TGI Fridays. If one goes to Hardware with that sort of expectation, they will definitely regret it. This was more like a dining experience. You need to go into it with no expectations, no time limit, no kids and yeah plan to spend money. Order shared plates and multiple courses. The waitress called it &#34;American Tapas&#34;. It&#39;s a menu designed to encourage ordering a bunch of food to explore. 

We started with a 3 meat chartucherie and we liked most of it but didn&#39;t care for one of the meats (duck bacon...tasted like bologna). Then we shared a greenhouse salad- it was so simple - mixed greens and dressing, but the dressing was so good, I wanted to lick the bowl. We moved on to the baked goat cheese and vegetables which was salty and warm and lovely. My husband is still talking about the olives. Our shared entree was the Wagyu hanger steak. The meat was so tender; you would never believe it was hanger steak. It was packed with flavor and cooked perfectly. We ordered the Ho Hos for dessert and they were awesome - you felt like you were eating a ho-ho but there&#39;s booze and they are way better. We had a few cocktails and contrary to other people&#39;s reviews, we left pleasantly stuffed and perfectly content. 

Yes. The entire idea of this restaurant smacks of Hipster Portland Oregon 2013 Pretention. The locally sourced menu items, the garden out back growing hops, the greenhouse inside growing herbs and vegetables, etc. But it&#39;s surprisingly NOT pretentious once you sit down on the freakishly serene patio. The wait staff is super knowledgeable about the menu but they are wearing khakis and a button down gingham shirt. They look like Gander Mountain models, not fine dining tour guides. The menu does have really fancy words on it, but the ingredients behind those fancy words are tastes and flavors that are very familiar. The entire meal was well executed and well appreciated.

All that said, there are a couple of drawbacks that keep this review from being a 5 star. First, it&#39;s step-sibling restaurant down the street excels at creative, delicious and dangerous cocktails. At Hardware, if you like whiskey - you are set on drinks. They have great cocktails that are handmade and crafted and all that, but they are all whiskey based. For those of us crazy enough to dislike the taste of whiskey, our cocktail choices become soberingly limited. I get it, that&#39;s that their thing - a million whiskeys and all, but at the end of the day it is a tad exclusionary to a person who prefers their cocktail with vodka. 

The other far easier fix for Hardware is the ridiculous bathroom situation. It&#39;s passable at the Turf Room to have unmarked, unisex stalls (passable = some boys are messy in the bathroom, frankly and sometimes sharing with the opposite sex is gross. I am not a priss about it either, boy&#39;s -learn how to aim). But at Hardware, they have gone as far as to mis-label the bathrooms. The stall I ended up with had a sign on it that said &#34;janitor&#39;s closet&#34;. It&#39;s not cute or funny and must give the wait staff migraines because I am sure they are constantly being asked where the bathrooms are. I heard it explained twice while I was using one. As a customer, you don&#39;t really want to ask for a bathroom and I mean, your clientele is spending a good amount of money. Label a bathroom for us, please. 

Otherwise, Keep doing what you are doing.",19/09/16,410,4,3,5,88,8.2783,7.478999999999999,2.343,34.177,No,3767

But then there was the OMG moment. For dessert, they had a pork belly and Luxardo cherry ice cream offering that was OFF THE HOOK. Never had anything as good anywhere.

hardware-north-aurora-5,Amber G.,e_XYqWUGn_oJfT2BED0p_w,zFa8sQ-re5ozPTlbuLxMmA,"This place must be for people who are doing a Paleo diet or for men. I should have guessed that by the name. Many of the dishes have an egg (quail or otherwise) added to it, even one of the desserts. Blech! It is also a sharing menu. I hate these. They give you a normal or smaller size meal and charge you more, since you are sharing. We had the charcuterie and chose a goat cheese and capicola (2 or 3 paper thin slices). This dish was fine and definitely paleo except for the 3 medium size crackers. We had the shrimp Caesar salad which just literally lined the bowl and the pieces of lettuce were about 9-12 inches long (another paleo dish). Rolls arrived to our table after the salad that were some kind of after product after creating the beer. The waitress made it sound disgusting. Luckily, they were good, soft and warm as the best thing, I ate there. We had trouble finding an entree that wasn&#39;t steak, pork pancakes, swordfish, mussels or octopus or didn&#39;t have an egg, so we had the sticky chicken with Kimchee.

 The nitro brew and flights were on sight and the food was delicious. The place itself is very cool with burnt wood and these ceiling decors made of pennies.

I&#39;m an ambiance guy so what Hardware has done, both visually and figuratively, is impressive.  The bottom line though, comes down to the food and alcohol.  A friend and I went in to give their craft beers a whirl and thought they were about average.  The regular food menu is frightfully expensive so we went with pre-6pm apps which constituted a half dozen small meat choices (like a hot dog, a slider, pieces of bacon, etc).  We liked the place but with all due respect, pricing is far north of the norm.  When the &#39;newness sticker&#39; wears off I think this place will find business far more challenging if they don&#39;t take a more proactive effort to reduce their food and beer price points.

Let me start by saying I am a picky eater.. not very adventurous.. I love a great steak and baked potato!  Of course I do eat other things.. but I am not a foodie and don&#39;t like anything too weird. 

Last Sunday my husband and I tried Hardware.. I&#39;ve heard its owned by the same people who own Turf Room, which has been our favorite local place since it has opened. I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal at the Turf room..  Walking in we loved the ambiance of Hardware.. But it has a very limited menu of strange items.. I tried a ricotta gnocchi.. bland.. mock risotto.. even more bland.. with a side of smoked bacon.. no flavor.. husband commented first bacon he would ever think to add salt too ! His  choices didn&#39;t fair much better..  Hoping for a good dessert.. couldn&#39;t find anything that looked appealing.. chocolate salami.. I don&#39;t think so!!! We walked away hungry with a 78$ bill. ( included 2 drinks pp) Overall a  very disappointing experience, that we chalked up to be unsophisticated in our food tastes! 

Fast forward 5 days... Had plans to go to the Goodman to see War Paint with 3 girlfriends, one suggested a restaurant that was booked.. I looked for nearby alternatives.. only briefly checking reviews.. not bothering  to check the menu when choosing .  Arriving there, very hungry! I panicked when I saw another somewhat limited menu with unusual items!!  WELL.. have to say this farm to table restaurant  is one of the best meals I&#39;ve ever had...that isn&#39;t a big steak! 

All items the four of us chose were excellent..  Peach Caprese Salad, Squash Blossoms, Monkey Bread , bacon popcorn, .The others chose a few beet dishes I did not partake in and a green tomato BLT they said were  excellent. I had the mac and cheese that was to die for!!! Two had the corn chowder that  they raved about. Everything was very flavorful and absolutely Delicious. We certainly didn&#39;t walk away hungry!!  

 I really hate to give poor reviews to local places.. but I think Hardware can do better..Had I not stumbled on the  Chicago restaurant , I most likely would never have tried another similar restaurant.. Hope they can find dishes that blend well together!",22/08/16,256,2,1,1,-10,0.4392,1.8880000000000001,1.857,14.256,No,2267

Cool concept and cool design of building with re-purposed materials, eco-friendly operations etc. However.....The food portions were tiny and without much flavor. My party and I literally went to McDonald&#39;s afterward because we were still hungry. Foie Gras on the menu?? Really??? The restaurant is sending mixed messages with this menu option.

They offer a wide selection of locally brewed beer as well as their own and a very extensive whisky list of top shelf bourbon, rye, scotch and vodka from all over the world.

hardware-north-aurora-5,Dan S.,81fr37MM4GR62S2yvOt3gA,Ltcgj3cBc3GHkltTBbJjtQ,"Read all the prior reviews and decided it&#39;s mixed so let&#39;s see what WE think. Went here with friends after wanting to check it out since it opened since we love trying new places and their premise of all local/self-sustaining. 

We had reservations at 5 and the place was just starting to get busy.  We love the interior decor of the place and the outdoor dining area. Inside is fairly dark but the tables seemed to be a bit too close. We opted to sit outside since it was a nice night out. We were seated immediately and service then, and throughout the night, was very friendly, knowledgeable, etc.   Everybody working seemed very nice, helpful, etc. 

Their drink menu is very extensive with TONS of whiskeys and a decent beer selection, but all was a bit overpriced. $9 for a beer??? C&#39;mon now. Yes, it&#39;s not Miller Lite but I am also not at a concert or ballgame, which is still robbery. Their mixed rinks were very  tasty but overpriced  as well. 

As far as the food, our waiter  told us their menu is made for sharing. There is definitely some sticker shock on a large portion of their menu to me.   We all ordered appetizers and entrees, expecting  large portions or a tapas style presentation. For appetizers, we ordered the hot dog, poutine, spare ribs and salmon carpaccio. The hot dog was outstanding, bigger than a normal hot dog but could&#39;ve been hotter. Still not sure how one &#39;shares&#39; a hot dog 4 ways. The carpaccio was 4 very thin slices about 3&#34; long each. Good, but nothing special. We were expecting more pieces and it to be thicker.  The short ribs were tasty but you only get 2. Some more meat on the ribs would&#39;ve been nice. The poutine wasn&#39;t very poutine-y at all. Just a few big, fried potato wedges with fried egg. The fries were okay, but I was expecting more accoutrements and seasoning. 

For entrees, we got the sticky chicken, wagyu skirt steak, Korean rice and pot pie. The sticky chicken was very good, crunchy, etc.  I didn&#39;t want to share!  I would&#39;ve preferred it being boneless to make it easier to share.  The steak was cooked the way we had requested and also very good, but $27 for 6-7 oz of skirt steak is ridiculous. The pot pie was huge and had an excellent light flaky crust but below the crust, it was  more chicken soup than chicken stew/pot pie. Disappointing to say the least. The soup underneath tasted okay for what it&#39;s worth. The Korean rice was tasty but lacked seasoning. All the entrees could&#39;ve come out hotter as well.

As far as desserts, we had the HoHo&#39;a and strawberry shortcake. Both   were very good but the HoHo&#39;a were better. We asked for the check. 
Definitely some sticker shock and disappointment. For our $250+, I expected a lot more and better seasoned food.  Tough to leave a place dropping $125+ and still feel hungry.

All in all, the food was good to very good. Nothing   blew any of us  away though, which should be expected  given those prices. Most could&#39;ve used some seasoning, come out hotter and in bigger portions...and  lower the prices at least 25%.  This is North Aurora, not Barrington or Chicago.  The portion sizes are not really shareable at all, unless you are only there with one other person and they don&#39;t eat much.   We really liked the decor, ambience and service. The food was good, don&#39;t get me wrong  and we did have a nice night but at those prices...AND  to still walk away hungry afterwards and not be singing praises, there  are better values and meals in the area.",04/07/16,417,3,3,5,62,8.1272,6.263,2.9170000000000007,39.821,No,3545

We decided to make a dinner date with our good friends and we returned to Hardware for dinner.  We decided to use Uber since we knew that Hardware had great bartenders and a great drink menu.  Our 2nd visit did not disappoint.  Not only great drinks, but great food!  The ladies enjoyed the Kentucky Daquiri and &#34;The Last Word&#34; and they loved them .  For the second round, they both went with &#34; The Last Word&#34;. The men enjoyed the homemade beer for the evening. 
For dinner, we shared a few small plates: (1) a charcuterie with a few meats and cheeses which was UNREAL!  The olives and mustard that it came with were awesome.  (2) Pork pancakes - these were different than anything I have ever had and were tremendous! (3) Chicago Poutine - this was also awesome!a great combination, fried potatoes, cheese curd, bacon, etc,,,what more can you ask for! (4) Baked goat cheese and roasted vegetables - really good!

We so badly wanted this place to be as good as the Turf Room which is a favorite of ours (same owner). Hardware is awful. The food is just not good. They tried too hard to be trendy and forgot that most people don&#39;t actually like food like that. I sort of expect to find sautd baby seal flippers or stenciled roast beef wrapped in dolphin skin as specials. There was literally nothing good other than the rolls and a few items on the meat and cheese board. 

The &#34;mock risotto&#34; was like eating weeds. The hanger steak was not good. 

We literally cannot remember disliking any restaurant this much. Normally when places try to be chic, the food is at least good (just overpriced). We think the Turf Room, in contrast, is a bit pricey but worth it with a great atmosphere and truly delicious food. 

In the past, when disliking a restaurant, we tended to think maybe it was just a single not great experience and try again. Not this place. As soon as we saw the menu, my wife and I both wanted to leave.

He didn&#39;t seem too surprised nor did he make any attempt to compensate for his staff&#39;s lack of effort.  I can only assume that it&#39;s because this happens on a regular basis.

We orders the 4 cheese board. When it arrived, I was shocked by the small portions. We orders 3 sandwiches and a salad. The sandwiches were decent sizes; however, the shrimp Caesar salad was tiny. The shrimp were sliced in half to make it look like you had a decent amount of shrimp. What was most disturbing was the wilted partially brown lettuce.

Fish and chips were good, but not worth the cost.  3 chunks of swordfish and veggie chips.  Again, good but not great.

**I&#39;m not sure this place will thrive in the suburbs, seems more like an uptown Minneapolis concept where people will appreciate the concept a bit more than suburban housewives. (I can say that. I&#39;m a suburban housewife, but from Uptown Minneapolis.)

-we had two people try and take our order- no big deal, happy someone was eager to serve us. 
-we were brought the wrong appetizer- the waitress came over and apologized, she thought that&#39;s what we ordered. I had asked her to give recommendations initially and she put in an order for one of her recommendations which we didn&#39;t order- I can see how the mistake was made, nbd. We ate it and it was delicious. And then we paid for it. (Maybe at least give a little discount for the mistake??)

-excited to dig into my leftover mock risotto at home 2 days later and opened the bag to fine someone else&#39;s half eaten pasta. C&#39;MON GUYS......

Either way, kinks will be worked out and we will give them another shot in a couple weeks!",09/08/16,188,3,1,4,-3,3.1551,2.6620000000000004,0.849,14.488,No,1632

hardware-north-aurora-5,Jessica D.,5SFzBdgFiuhK_98PmIBXlQ,HFAcz7miv1nwItDNq-8pGA,"Like others, we had high hopes for Hardware. After driving past it literally every day, watching it get built, we could not wait for it to open. While we were hoping for a place that was something different than Bulldog&#39;s and cheaper than the Turf Room, it ended up being portions an 1/8 the size of Bulldog&#39;s and even more expensive than the Turf Room. I get the whole &#34;sustainable&#34; thing, but really?! The prices are ridiculous, and the fact they think you can share each plate between 2-4 is a joke. We have been there twice. We went there once on opening day, since it was my birthday the next day. For three adults, we each got one alcoholic drink. They were $12-14 each. Good, but not worth the price in North Aurora, maybe at a bar downtown Chicago, but not in the outer burbs. We then split a salad, the salmon plate, and the Korean bbq. The bill was like $90 and we left not even remotely full. 

OK. 
We tried again, just to get drinks and apps with another couple a few weeks later, since they had not been there yet. The waitress started off with this 5 minute speech on the menu, and then didn&#39;t come back for like 10 minutes for us to get our drink order. We each got two drinks (we had no kids for the night, so our bad on ordering 2 overpriced drinks each), the medium charcuterie platter, and the poutine. Better options than what we ordered the first time, but still, it wasn&#39;t a ton of food for sharing. Our bill was about $115. The waitress didn&#39;t come by very often, and it still was a boatload of money for mediocre service, and a charcuterie plate with lotssss of open space on it (it&#39;s $20, fill up that board for goodness sakes!)

We will not be going again unless they make the portions bigger or reduce their prices. I think the reviews have shown that people around here aren&#39;t going to keep giving this place business when they shell out a ton of money and leave hungry.

My daughter and I almost licked the goat cheese appetizer board clean. Highly recommended.

We split the Korean pork dish and were glad we did - the portion was huge! Very flavorful and another recommendation.

I am happy that i tried Hardware but it is not a place i will spend a lot of time at. They have a really nice outside area but it is in view of a busy street.

They had (6) home brews on tap at $9 a pint...Steep. Got the flight and they were all very good. If you&#39;re a whiskey drinker and can&#39;t find your poison here with over 300 selections not sure where you&#39;ll find it. 
Both times we&#39;ve been here the staff has been very good and attentive, Went for lunch and dinner, a bit of difference between the menus. They do have a green house, smoker, pack their own sausage and offer meats and cheeses from local farms. Very cool.
The menu....interesting and different love the creativity and quality of the food seems there, however when you go with a group and you have the one or few people that aren&#39;t adventurous to try new things they really lack any of the safe staple items, Sirloin burger, Filet, Adult Mac &amp; Cheese etc. this is not your buffalo wrap type of place. I see in other reviews comments on the portions, the shareables on the menu...not so much and the prices are a bit high especially for N Aurora.
They also own Turf Room right up the road.
Can&#39;t say we will be back anytime soon, between St. Charles, Geneva, Naperville Wheaton there are a lot of choices out there.
It&#39;s worth a try and see what you think, if you like whiskey and a creative menu that is more reasonably priced head up the road to Barrel &amp; Rye in Geneva, very good and consistent.

Just a party of 2 and the place didn&#39;t get busy until around 5pm. Ambiance was cool. Patio wasn&#39;t open yet or we would&#39;ve sat there. The inside tables felt much too close to each other for comfort. They had over 330 whiskeys on the menu! They have their own greenhouse, grow their own hops, and are self-sustaining. The water glasses were made of repurposed wine bottles and the serving boards were made of old barrels! Very cool. We ordered a medium charcuterie board for $20 (they pick the meats and cheeses for you) and it was delicious! Craft beer was just okay, but I&#39;m more of a wine gal. Our bill was $114 after food, tax, tip for a beer flight, 2 porters, charcuterie, and 3 small plates to share: Poutine, Korean bowl, and fish&amp;chips. Unfortunately, they were out of the ribs and pot pie 25 hours after their grand opening the previous afternoon. Those were the first 2 items we wanted to try, but they must&#39;ve been popular! I will definitely try this spot again. Next time I&#39;ll order wine, probably do another charcuterie board, and I&#39;d likely order the Poutine again. I&#39;d skip the Korean bowl because it was too spicy and I&#39;d skip the fish&amp;chips small plate because 3 little cubes of fried swordfish for $21 was too expensive and not tasty enough for us.

I had the Korean Pork dish and it was good but just small. It didn&#39;t fill me up for $13. My brother had the Brisket Sandwich. The portion was underwhelming. The Brisket needed to be cut with a knife to prevent all the meat from being pulled out with one bite. On the positive side he said the flavor was great.

Went there this past weekend as a group of 8.   Knowing this I didn&#39;t concern myself when they told use it would be an extra 15min.  From our 8pm rsvp.   But it turned into a 30 min wait.   We were sat and waited another 10 min for the waiter to come by.  We were giving one drink menu for 8. And had to wait another 3 or 5 min for another menu.  We ordered drinks and waited 10 more minutes for our drinks so we are now pushing 9pm.  Our waiter was so I&#39;m too good for this place that he was rude and jerky as we asked a few questions about the menu.    About the only thing that sounded appealing to me was the hanger steak and sticky chicken.    Which my wife and I shared.   My wife ordered a salad and this was about the worst I have ever had.  Just a few leaves of some kind our lettuce and a sprinkling of dressing nothing else!   

We had to ask for bread and the waiter mumbled something about us being so far away from everything.  As we were In  the back.    At various points he made other negative comments  as we  had to wait a long for our food I asked for more rolls and a soda which was met w/ rolling eyes.    I had had enough so when he came back I asked him if he had lost a bet and that&#39;s why he was stuck at our table.  I&#39;m sure my anger spilled into how I asked as his tone suddenly changed.

Table of 2 on a Thursday evening. As with any new restaurant it was moderately busy. There is plenty of parking available. The front of the restaurant entrance is lined with a wall of potted greens and herbs, pretty cool. In and out it took about 1.5 hours for 1 cocktail, 1 salad, and 3 orders of appetizers. Not bad but not super quick either. The menu is all meant for sharing portions. Which means slightly larger than a tapas plate in my opinion. It says sharing on the headline for appetizer and entree sections, so you should expect smaller portions (i.e. do not come here starving and bitch about quantity of food). Although it doesn&#39;t say what size portions the salads are. From what we ordered I take it as not an entre size salad but not quite a side salad size either. Think of a side salad times 1.5 for food quantity. I take it as a nice gastropub to drink and enjoy a couple of high quality appetizers. The whiskey menu is outstanding and extensive and I hope to return solely to sample many of the offerings.

The barrel aged Manhattan was great and you can definitely taste the vanilla and caramel from the barrel. The quality of the greens were the best as you can imagine them being freshly picked daily in true farm to table style. The foie gras mousse was smooth and velvety. The Korean pork fried rice dish was awesome and I hope they never take it off the menu. Perfect &#34;drinking food&#34;. The salmon carpaccio was delicious and the arugula on it was so fresh.

Service was decent and as with any new restaurant it takes a while to work out some kinks during the busy times. We had a small issue of being charged for another tables drink on my tab. They voided out my original bill and rang up a new one while giving me a copy of the voided transaction. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and fairly attentive. The owner came by and asked how the foie gras mousse was which was nice.

I love beer, and the pale ale on tap was delicious. The food is interesting; most of the plates are designed to share and are smaller portions.

Both were good, though of the two I&#39;d recommend the pancakes. I love poutine and this one was pretty good but not memorable and could&#39;ve used a lot more cheese (but then so could everything, in my opinion).

My girlfriend and I tried several things on the menu and were not disappointed, including drinks and dessert.  I did not try any of the homebrewed beer as it all seemed to be a variation of pale ales with possibly a porter/stout option.  For those of us that don&#39;t favor bitter, the other bottled beer options are fine.  I look forward to seeing how this establishment matures as there is some room for improvement, like more herbs/flavor in the mock risotto, a better balance between portion and price (even for tapas-style dining), and a more diverse homebrew menu.

Undercooked, bland, and just kind of a mess on the plate.  What I imagined and what I received were vastly different.  The duck fat hadn&#39;t rendered either which left that unsavory flavor.

Thought it was good that the server explained that we could opt for sharing plates or a more traditional service style. When one person in my party did not order a beverage, simply because she did not want one, the server gave her a strange and unsolicited speech about how if she did not want a whisky based cocktail, there was a particular cocktail that could help ease her into it. Brisket sandwich was tasty, but small portion for the price. My husband&#39;s brisket sandwich had poor cuts of meat that were chewy. Two flights of beer tastings were served on warped planks of untreated wood, had spilled because they were overfilled and it was messy. Beer was nothing special. Ordered waffle fries which were not fries at all, but potato chips. From the time we sat down until we got the check was about 1.5 hours, rather slow. Strange bathroom situation (no signs). Strange check delivery device (baby blocks with everything rolled up and shoved into holes). Did not feel the music (kind of jazzy, adult contemporary) fit the motif (rustic chic whisky bar). Really wanted to love this place because it is close to home and I am a huge whisky fan. The prices for sharing plates and appetizer items were too high to be enjoyable for me. $50 for one beer flight, one beer, two brisket sandwiches.

Sure, that&#39;s a lot of carne for lunch, but I was glad I got to try it all. I of course wasn&#39;t able to finish everything but I put a pretty good dent in this $9.75 plate.

The falafel was perfection -- crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. All of the meats were flavorful and cooked just right. The rice and veggies rounded out the meal nicely.

We have been back twice since our first visit consistently excellent, exceeded our expectations.

mazmez-middle-eastern-grill-elk-grove-village,Raj D.,qMuhlJtQYY1sjGaYgKexyQ,SgBqmNMHZNJjLpEYYgooZQ,Nothing special here. The staff was friendly. Restaurant was clean and played nice authentic music in the background. I ordered the combo platter but unfortunately my beef was very chewy. The onion has &#34;chat masala&#34; on it which was a nice touch. I did enjoy the rice which boosted by stars but unfortunately not enough of a reason to go back. The chicken shwarma was fresh and chicken was tender but just lacked the traditional flavor. The hot sauce reminded me of a saltier version of red chili paste that you get at chinese restaurants. Unfortunately I will not be back but I will admit the food portions are great and somewhere down the line the restaurant should consider a lunch special. I suggest Pita inn or Naf Naf for a  better tasting chicken shawarma.,14/11/16,82,3,1,2,6,1.7808000000000002,2.0549999999999997,1.1880000000000002,6.756,No,770

Visited on a Saturday evening with the fam, and walked in to a completely empty restaurant.  Grabbed a couple of menus and a table.  After perusing the options, we settled on the following: vegetarian platter, combination platter, and fries.  I asked the young man behind the counter how many pitas come with the platters, and shockingly, he said none.  He must have noticed the puzzled look on my face because he offered to include them, no charge.  Ok, a bit weird but hey, he included them.

I was also taken aback at the $0.75 they tack on for every hot sauce and garlic sauce.  I can try to understand this if it were carry-out...but EVERY fast-casual Mediterranean place I&#39;ve been to (and I&#39;ve been to various all over the country) includes these gratis for dine-in orders.   Again, he says he&#39;ll include them since it&#39;s our first time...nice guy.  SIDE NOTE: if you&#39;re going to charge $0.75 for a condiment, at least fill the container up to the top. 

Out comes our food...and while it looked initially appetizing, we were let down by almost every single thing.  First was the vegetarian platter: The grilled vegetables were a salty mush, the rice was more like biryani rather than the usual fluffy pilaf variety, and oh yea, the aforementioned free pita was MIA.  But the falafel was pretty good, I&#39;ll give them that. 

The combination platter, however, was a complete fail.  The meat portions, considering it was a &#34;platter,&#34; were pitiful.  The chicken kabob was not a kabob but rather, marinated chicken cooked on a flattop.  The definition of shawarma is meat that&#39;s cooked on a spit and then shaved when ready to serve...but this was just chunks of chewy steak, again cooked on a flattop.   There was also a shish kabob was as uninspiring as the rest of its platter companions.  

So here&#39;s why I&#39;m so torn: because the people there are very friendly and genuine.  I want this family to make it, but I find it hard to imagine they&#39;ll break the 1yr mark if this is the best they have to offer.  Will I visit again?

My husband ordered the Combination platter.  It came with Falafel, Shish Kebab, Chicken Kebab and Shawarma.  His favorite was the Chicken Kebab.
We also ordered the Msahab Sandwich.  This was recommended by the guy at the register.  It was marinated minced chicken with mayo and tomato on pita bread.  They all came with some pickles and olives and radishes.  I liked the Tahini dip/sauce.

This was one of our stops on a bar crawl and picked out specifically so we could get both beer or cocktails and dinner. I went with the Adult Mac &amp; Cheese.

I still have had terrible experience (and good, though overpriced food) there, but I did notify the:&#34;contact us&#34; link on the website after the dog incident (I assume it was the owner) Brian McGonigal answered within 24 hours, addressing each one of my concerns. 

Regarding the dog (my biggest issue), apparently it&#39;s a semi-regular customer who has been told before that her dog is only allowed in the outdoor patio seating, NOT inside, MONTHS ago, so he was surprised at my experience/that the dog was inside for any length of time, and said that the entire staff was going to be retrained/reminded of the policy. He seemed to generally care that I had a negative experience, and I really do appreciate it. 

I will probably go back one more time, because if not for the dog on my last visit, I would have said 3.5 stars (factoring in kitchen mistakes), so maybe I just always catch them on an off day.

I was shivering from the elements and wanted something warm, so I ordered a glass of white white and a cup of the French onion soup with my apple and goat cheese salad. 

The salad was only OK and needed some nuts and cucumbers, but the soup? It was love at first sip. Not only was it picture-perfect, it tasted out of this world. I&#39;m going to have cravings for this soup for a long, long time. 

The drink menu was exactly what we were looking for, a mix of beer, wine, and mixed drinks. I ended my meal with an Irish coffee (decaf). It was pretty great, as well.

mcgonigals-pub-barrington,David R.,6EHbIv5w2I4XbXs3dG_D1Q,HntjHIwM8oWS_WcGR6wlDw,"We need more Irish pubs like this in the city.  Not &#34;Irish&#34; pubs with an Irish name that trot out the glossy cardboard shamrock decorations around St Patrick&#39;s Day, but otherwise work assiduously to grow the revenue numbers of the Miller Brewing Company and cater to ballcap-wearing twenty-somethings who &#34;need&#34; a place to watch sports and shout at each other over music that was on the radio when they were zygotes.

This one gets it right, not in the look so much (though that is a strength) but in the note-perfect vibe of low-pressure conviviality.  It&#39;s a great mix of folks of all ages, many of whom seem to know each other--and the staff.

This building was a bank, an honest-to-goodness, small-town, tall, standalone bank building with columns in front.  Inside, it looks like County Kerry, with a huge handsome bar and numerous tables in charming, architecturally eccentric nooks.  The music performance area is a small mezzanine overlooking the main floor.

You like beer?  So do they.  There is ONE Miller Lite tap.  They have Guinness, Harp, and Smithwick&#39;s, as you would expect.  They have some standard but solid favorites such as Blue Moon, Stella Artois, Hoeegarden, and 312.  Great Lakes, Breckenridge Brewery, and Leinenkugel&#39;s are represented, and they have some other excellent choices such as Murphy&#39;s Stout (God bless it) and Murphy&#39;s Red, not to mention Delirium Tremens, Pilsner Urquell, and Bell&#39;s Brown.  So, basically, a beer for every preference, occasion, mood, hour of the day, you name it.

Live music every weekend, friendly bartenders, a warm suburban crowd, and a food menu.  Sure, there are TVs but you can ignore them if you like.  This would be the best local pub in almost any neighborhood in Chicago, but you would probably ruin it by putting it in almost any neighborhood in Chicago.",01/04/11,229,4,1,4,-7,3.5013,2.472,0.344,13.185,No,1867

Already hungry, m&#39;lady and I decided to stop here for a quick bite to eat and a drink or two. It fit the bill perfectly.

The service was really quick, and although it wasn&#39;t overly friendly, it was efficient. My Guinness was poured perfectly and was delicious. My girlfriend had a Stella and a Blue Moon and both...well, they tasted like they should! That may sound funny to novices, but many of us frequent beer drinkers can tell when something is off, such as in the lines...these all tasted quite good.

OK, so the food - we had an order of the Trinity Sliders off the app menus. These were basically corned beef on mini pretzel rolls with a delicious spicy mustard. Really tasty...we both enjoyed them greatly. 

Four beers (2x Guinnes, 1x Stella, 1x Blue Moon) + App for $29 with tax (but not tip). Maybe slightly high, but not terrible for the area.",15/08/11,122,4,1,5,-2,4.4498999999999995,2.865,0.272,8.863999999999999,No,960
mcgonigals-pub-barrington,Kerri L.,FvB8J1sLOM84V_YhWRXDjg,mI8IL4dbxetqOGKt2QVx1Q,"The man and I went here for lunch today. 

They have a good beer selection ( I can&#39;t partake in it right now, but the man was happy with it), I dig the decor, and our waitress was really sweet.

For appetizers we ordered the Bryan and Guinness wings, and our waitress warned us that the Bryan wings were really hot and she couldn&#39;t take them back if we didn&#39;t like them. We usually order wings the first time we go to a place, and they&#39;re rarely as hot as they&#39;re made out to be, so we were curious to try these.

The wings are big, and have a nice char on them. The Bryan wings were hot, but not so hot that they didn&#39;t have any flavor, they were really good! They are definitely hotter than your standard hot wing you can get at other places, which was good for us. :) If you love hot wings you need to try them. The Guinness wings were also good, but we were hooked on the Bryan wings.

The french onion soup was ok. The broth was sweet instead of savory, and is the only reason i&#39;m giving this place 4 stars because everything else was excellent. 

The man was going back and forth between the shepherd&#39;s pie and the pot roast so he asked the waitress, and she said that her favorite thing is the pot roast. He went with that, and it was absolutely delicious. One of the best pot roasts either of us have ever had. ( He said that mine is better, but he&#39;s a damn liar. A sweet damn liar.)

I went with the Kilkenny burger with pepperjack, avocado, bacon, and sauteed onions. I was a little worried about ordering it. I&#39;m currently pregnant and can only eat well done burgers. I&#39;ve gone to a couple of places and ordered a burger well done, and it ALWAYS ends up being medium rare, and then I can&#39;t eat it and have to bring it home. It&#39;s always aggravating because burgers never reheat as well, and I hate sending food back. I had a perfectly well done burger, with a nice char taste on the outside, and the toppings were plentiful and tasted good together. I was really, really happy with my burger, and glad and relieved that they actually cooked it how I wanted it. so THANK YOU!


The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the french onion soup, everything else was excellent, including the service. I make homemade french onion soup, so that does make me more critical, but if they fixed the broth and made it savory, I would be completely won over. 

Overall it was a great dining experience and we will definitely be back.",01/05/11,284,4,2,5,24,9.3147,5.639000000000001,1.742,18.619,No,2493

mcgonigals-pub-barrington,Falcozapp A.,kJ5X5svjy7BkMoaeelWQsA,teNOvGpDPeHb3UjQIXxNyA,"Just came back from a Boxing Day brunch with my wife and in-laws.  Their order included fish and chips, Irish boxty, and a salad which they were all very happy with.  My order was the full Irish breakfast.  When it arrived, it looked delicious and indeed it was.  However, I was surprised to find just a single rasher of bacon.  I mentioned this to our server Jordan (who was charming, efficient and helpful) and she said that she would check with the chef.  A few minutes later she came back and let me know that the chef said that this was standard for the order.  I&#39;m stunned that a $13:50 breakfast only comes with a single rasher of bacon and a single banger (this is perhaps the highest price I&#39;ve seen for a breakfast platter).  I don&#39;t recall this being the case at any similar place.  Upon rereading the menu I can confirm that it does describe the breakfast as including rasherS and bangerS rather than one of each. Why list them in the plural if you&#39;re only going to serve one?  It might seem like a small quibble but having proper Irish bacon was a large part of the reason why I placed the order.  They need to update the menu to reflect this.  I was very tempted to give a lower rating, but because everything else was so nice I didn&#39;t think it would be fair to do so.",26/12/14,137,3,2,4,15,3.0681000000000003,1.26,0.107,12.633,No,1302

I&#39;ve never been to Ireland, but I definitely didn&#39;t feel like I was sitting in Barrington, IL. 

I ordered a reuben with no sauerkraut (just wasn&#39;t in the mood) and I was happy when our food was brought out and my sauerkraut-less reuben hadn&#39;t been mixed up with dad&#39;s which had the kraut on it.  Everyone&#39;s order was correct with all the correct condiments and garnishes, a big plus in my book.  The food was okay, about what you would expect. 

The one minor drawback was that the service seemed to be slow.  We were in fairly early on a Wednesday evening (got there around 5:30) so there weren&#39;t a ton of patrons.  Most were by the bar.  The service felt slow for the day/time and our very polite waitress took a long time to grab our bill back and run our card.  One thing I really enjoyed about our waitress was her honesty.  My mom asked about the chicken pot pie, and she told her it was the only thing on the menu she wouldn&#39;t recommend.  I was happy to hear her honesty instead of my mom ending up with something she didn&#39;t like just to get a sale.

Pros:

- Food quality is pretty high. Fish and chips were my favorite. Fries were seasoned and tasted really good. Fish was not bad. A little over breaded and overcooked, but does the job. 
- Overall the restaurant and bar area looks very clean. 
- Location near the train in Barrington is a huge plus. 
- TVs are generally showing something sports related and they play the sound from the TV rather than some annoying music that I don&#39;t want to be blaring over my conversation. 

Cons:

- Service during lunchtime can be a bit slow. I have had different waitresses on each occasion and found that the last waitress was an improvement. Expect to be eating there for at least an hour for a table of two. 
- The chairs in the bar area are incredibly uncomfortable to sit in, especially if you sit for an extended period waiting for food. Try to get actual seats over stools.

My favorite things there are the strong mixed drinks, the fries, and the chicken sandwich.  The chicken is seriously so juicy and not dried out, and it comes on a delicious pretzel roll--you can&#39;t go wrong with that amazingness!!

The interior is warm and inviting...maybe a bit more &#34;themed&#34; than actually &#34;authentic&#34; but a decent environment. I know a few of the staff members (they used to work at the Curragh in Schaumburg before it closed) and they are GREAT additions to this place!

I don&#39;t like their 16 ounce pint glasses...but, I realize they are acceptable and market standard (the only true pint glass in my opinion are the 20 ounce tulip glasses, but I am getting snobby, so will stop)...The aforementioned staff will ensure the pour is proper! While I am a professional bar hopper, I have never had a drinking session in this place (I don&#39;t drive when I drink, and this is a bit out of taxi range for me), but I know they have some good musical acts like Morgan Fingleton and Fast Eddie MacAteer...awesome!

I have had a couple of dishes there - Chicken sandwich...awesome! I have had it three times and it has never ever been overcooked (and is there anything worse than a rubber shoe of a chicken breast?)...I know it is just a sandwich, but it is possible to screw up and McGonigals really delivers a quality product!

The chicken boxty - always a fan of a decent boxty! I was not disappointed!!!! I did have to use table salt though (which I NEVER use), but once that was added, I was very happy.

The pretzel nuggets with melted cheese...this stuff is Seven Eleven comfort food at its best...I mean that too...pretzels and cheese...whats not to love? Again, not exactly an old Donegal recipe...but whatever! 

My only bad experience here....the mussels. I went once with about 4 people and I was the only one at the table that didn&#39;t like them. For me, it was the broth....there was something about it that was just terrible in my opinion...but I think it was more a matter of my personal taste, rather than poor execution...",07/11/11,219,3,1,2,3,1.1353,1.421,1.153,13.426,No,1946

When you go to McGonigals, you order the burger. It&#39;s as simple as that. Other dishes on the menu, yes they are perfectly fine, but to be honest...don&#39;t bother. 

They are seasoned perfectly and probably the best in the area. The patty is so amazingly juicy, and are cooked exactly to your specification. Never have I ordered medium and gotten medium-well or well done. I don&#39;t know what kind of meat they use, or what seasoning, but it is just perfect.

When we asked if they could play some music (this is an Irish pub after all) the owner said no because he wanted to watch the football game (American college) on TV. We asked our waiter for the WiFi password and he didn&#39;t know it and wouldn&#39;t find out. A huge waste of time and money (wife insisted we pay for our slop).

mcgonigals-pub-barrington,Corin W.,bYQm7BRwvJDKuaU_zbmp_w,oXRznXIXX-NN7jPUS2Btcw,"Went here last night for a Green Drinks gathering.  We arrived early so we sat and had a beer and appetizer in the main bar/diningroom while we waited.  The ambiance of this place freakin&#39; rocks.  It&#39;s three floors.  All dark wood.  Cozy booths with large windows to sit by.  even though some of the tables are close together you still feel like you have privacy. Subdued lighting.  A cheery skull sitting on a shelf behind the bar made this Gravestomper feel at home. 

Our waitress, Joy, was just that...a joy.  She was bright and funny and attentive.  The bartender was smiling, friendly and enjoying himself.

We had the best spinach artichoke dip we&#39;ve ever had.  A steaming cast iron crock surrounded by a mountain of fried pita wedges.  It was a meal in itself.

When we made it up to the third floor for the Green Drinks gathering we discovered another bar up there.  Patrick our upstairs bartender was just as friendly and attentive as the staff in the main lobby. And he had a great sense of humor.  I say that because at another green drinks meeting we&#39;ve attended at another restaurant we&#39;ve always received crap service from the bartenders.  The manager&#39;s excuse to us? &#39;You should come here for regular service, not just a green drinks meeting.&#39;  I know--that sounds insane right?  Like we weren&#39;t real customers because we met with fifty other people there.

McGonigals, however,  proved that every time a restaurant has customers come in--for whatever reason: whether it&#39;s a banquet, business lunch, or intimate dining--is a chance to dazzle them with yours service and quality.

CONs:  The hostesses dress a tad on the &#39;unprofessional&#39; side and look 16 (this could be a CON for a guy I suppose!).  They go out for many cigarette breaks and drag it back inside with them.  Also, the noise level in there is insane.  You&#39;ll have a sore throat by the end of the night.

The atmosphere was great, the food was fantastic, but the service was sub-par.  So it&#39;s not a very large place inside and there was a Michigan vs. Notre Dame game on, so the bar area was busy, but there were open tables in the place.  We got seated right away and sat at the table for almost 30 minutes before we even got our beers.  The waitress was not very personable, she never even introduced herself.  I have worked in the service industry and find it really irritating when someone doesn&#39;t even give you their name.  When she saw that we were done eating she asked if we were would like dessert, or any other drinks and my boyfriend replied &#34;no, thank you, I think we&#39;re all done.&#34;  She removed the plates and left the table.  She came back with a dessert menu and told us to take a look.....ummm we said no, thank you.   Then when she returned she asked if we had decided on dessert, we told her yet again that we were through.  She left, and returned once more finally with our bill.  MY GOD!  We paid and skidaddled.  Seriously probably some of the worst service I&#39;ve ever experienced.  I mean I can understand if you&#39;re extremely busy, but tell us that up front and make sure you don&#39;t put one table before another, it&#39;s just crappy service!  I really liked the place, had a great feel, but honestly I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll return due to the lack of personality/skill of the staff they have.

I was very pleasantly surprised as I grew up in Barrington and there was NEVER anywhere good to go besides Wool Street, which I find to be just OK.  McGonigal&#39;s is very tastefully decorated and actually resembles an Irish pub.  Their booths have beautiful upholstery and the stools are cushioned and comfortable.  The bar in the center allows you to get a good view of everyone who is showing up for the BHS reunion at night.  I do like the crowd better here and find it to be less obnoxious than at Wool Street.

The menu is well-priced with a variety of traditional Irish food.  I had the Reuben which was one of the best ones I&#39;ve had.  It wasn&#39;t too soggy and came with a great side salad that wasn&#39;t one of those wimpy iceberg ones.  My friend had a chicken sandwich which was just OK.  She should have ordered something more authentic in my opinion anyway.

Only wish we would have had a place like McGonigal&#39;s back in my younger days while living in Barrington (aka Borington) where the only nearby fun to be had was on the humdrum Schaumburg strip. 

A legit pub meets dining establishment, meets live music venue, meets event locale, is exactly what this Northwestern &#39;burb needed. There&#39;s a bit of everything to be found here and fortunately, they do it all pretty well.

A great spot to throw back some wings, watch the game and let loose or even take advantage of this building&#39;s historic past as Barrington&#39;s oldest bank and secure the cozy private dining room that used to be a safe - and still boasts all the combo locks and vault features!

We were hungry and had no inclination to find another place at that time so adjusted. Food quality has been going down in years but surprisingly with increase in customer base. Mostly Indian customers come to it because it&#39;s name resembles a famous bakery in India (not sure if it is same owner because quality is a big let down) and due to lack of Indian fast food choices in this area.

My wife can make better than this. My son had black forest cake he loved it. 

But then this lady comes to buy bread and owner was at the register. He asked her for her photo id. I thought that was strange like she was buying liquor or something banned items. For buying bread this store check photo id. 

Then he went inside and cashier came out and told the lady for her photo id. And she said she can&#39;t sell the bread to her. Lady was asking reason why she can&#39;t sell the bread. The cashier response was they can&#39;t sell bread to her. 

I saw couple of bad rating for food on yelp. But the checking photo id when you buy bread was new to me. I hope they discontinue this practice when someone buys bread.

I was there with my family and the lady who takes your orders and who runs the cash register was very rude in many ways.  She never acknowledged us standing in front of her waiting to place our order. It took us nearly 10 minutes before she took our order.  ( We were the first one in line and the place wasn&#39;t busy at all at the time)  The food was okay, not good in my opinion.  I have had better food with better customer service at many other places. The place was very filthy. But since we were visiting Chicago and my younger son liked their cake,  we decided to give them another try. And the experience was HORRIBLE!!!!!!! Again I waited a while to place my order. Even though I was first in line,  the same lady kept taking other&#39;s order and chatting with someone. Finally I got to place my order. And when I asked her for number of Idlies in an order,  very rudely she pointed to the board where menu was written and said everything is written - read! How rude!  There was nothing written that clarified the number of Idlies in an order anyway.  But her rudeness didn&#39;t just stop there.  I had some food with me for my youngest who found their food very spicy. My husband took the food out that we had brought in for my son, and lady rudely told me to pack up my food as they didn&#39;t allow outside food.

This place should have 0 stars. That&#39;s as simple as I can put it. Please listen to all the other reviews with one or two stars, this place is not worth your money, time, or patience. 

We arrived and we were the only table around 7:30PM Sunday night, and were greeted by a server that was not so inviting or happy. I&#39;m not over exaggerating my experience, I had to write a review so you guys stay clear of this restaurant until things start to turn around. The sushi was kid sized and I&#39;m not kidding, the time we waited for our rolls was around 30 minutes, remember, we were the only table. Our waters were barely refilled, we had to ask for our tea to be refilled, when again, we were the only table there. The proportion is just not worth it, and I know I had to write a review to warn everyone about this place, it&#39;s honestly not worth it and please don&#39;t go.

DON&#39;T COME HERE IF YOU LIKE GOOD SUSHI, REGULAR PORTIONS, AND GOOD SERVICE. 

I know it looks like I&#39;m being rash but it&#39;s true, I don&#39;t know what else to say, don&#39;t even go here if you have a Groupon coupon please, save your time I don&#39;t know how anyone can rate this place more than 1 star and I can&#39;t even imagine what service would be like if there was tables than just us (a party of 4).

sakumas-japanese-restaurant-streamwood,Jennifer T.,95ZOGsJp__n7j6xeF9edXg,uasmK2PHicM_Yy2fEdSafw,"The husband I were craving sushi for our Friday date night last week and we found this place on Yelp and it looks like it has a decent reviews. We were even happier to find out that they had a Groupon deal ($15 for $30) so we purchased that and had our dinner here. Sometimes, when you purchase things on Groupon, you do wonder why they needed to have a promo and sometimes you figure out why. 

I don&#39;t think this place is bad, it&#39;s decent, but unfortunately, it&#39;s not what I expected in terms of taste and especially price. Even with our Groupon, we had to really budget and spent a bit extra just to feel a bit satiated. My first impression was that this place must be under renovations or something because from a look-standpoint, they were very bare in terms of decor. Even their menu was just a sheet of printer paper inserted into sheet protectors being tied together by a ribbon. There was no sign of &#39;under constructions&#34; and previous historic reviews for this place went back as far as 4 years ago so I was a bit confused by the look of it. They also didn&#39;t have that many tables set up and the layout seemed a little bit not as flowy. The overall ambiance of this place felt like it was a place that just opened and haven&#39;t quite settled into their decor or feel established.

Service was very nice and friendly though and even their sushi chefs seems to speak Japanese or Korean or some sort of authentic language so that impressed me a bit. However, the overall taste of the food was just okay. 

The rice in the maki wasn&#39;t moist, it was dry and the seaweed wrap was too chewy. The content inside the maki was okay portion and flavor was kind of bland. They gave sauces to dip on the side which is good, but I prefer the sauces inside my rolls to really let the flavor sink in. Each slices of maki was very thin and small. I couldn&#39;t tell if this is how sushi really is and I&#39;ve just been too used to bigger rolls that got super-sized or what, but I felt like it wasn&#39;t really worth the money. They had sushi maki rolls range from $5 to the upper teens. But even when we ordered a Caterpillar roll at $9, it was the thinnest and smallest 8-piece roll I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;ve had other house special rolls that priced around $14 that were much bigger, and I think I almost prefer a big roll that is priced higher than a medium priced one that is so tiny... 

Psychologically, the price and the portions at this place just didn&#39;t jive for me. The food unfortunately, wasn&#39;t spectacular enough for me to really rave about it. I think it&#39;s decent, but until I have a more interesting experience here, I can&#39;t say it really stand out among other sushi places.",26/01/15,284,3,3,3,59,2.7096,1.3659999999999999,0.597,20.036,No,2733

We were seated and the whole time I felt like we were rushed to order and eat... ok, I understand that we came at 9PM (late)..and the restaurant closes at 10PM.. but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been rushed like this at other restaurants when they were closing in an hr..(I eat fast, don&#39;t worry!)...they also give you mini warm towels to clean your hands before you eat.. and mine smelled like rags (not so clean after all...i think i just made my hands dirty..)...so I had to go to the washroom and wash my hands from the rag smell w/ the generic smelling soap......ahh..not a good start to the dining experience..

Food: 
Kake Udon ($8): not impressed at all.. I think I can make udon at home with more flavor and more ingredients!  they only had green onions and noodles in the soup...i&#39;ve had better at other restaurants....

Spicy Tuna Roll ($6): the rolls are really small and i&#39;ve had better at different restaurants for sure!!

Costs: appetizers and salads range from $7-$15, noodles range from $8-$15, specials range from $15-$25, Sakuma&#39;s specialities range from $6-$25+

Positive: free edamame (small dish), lots of space

Negative: customer service, costs are on the high range (not sure if it&#39;s worth it..)

I probably won&#39;t visit this place again.. :(",31/10/12,207,3,2,4,26,3.2632,1.035,0.382,4.583,No,1600

We had the special which included delicious duck, shrimp and chicken soup, a green salad and a plate with 15 different selections of sushi. 
They have built a wall to divide the dining room and another patron explained they are making a Sake bar which was confusing but not in use yet.
Unfortunately, the original owner/chef moved to California but we think he still owns it. His wife was usually there to hostess/waitress. Last night was busy and there was only the one gal that has been there for a long time and she was overwhelmed. 
The decorating is getting a little dusty and ladies bathroom could use updating and a towel holder that works.
They could probably improve the ambiance by dimming the lights slightly and playing soft music.

I picked up an Oyako Don, which is chicken with mushrooms and onions, served beneath an egg omelet (!) with some sauce and laid over rice. If I recall correctly, it came served with some really good miso soup.

I thought this was a relatively unusual thing to order for lunch, but I was rewarded with a really tasty meal all around. The mushrooms lent an excellent earthiness to the dish, and they gave me enough food for two days of lunch.

That being said, I will now move on:

Let&#39;s face it--my dinner here was very &#34;blind leading the blind&#34;.  Neither one of us had really ever had sushi before and he heard all about this place and really wanted to try it.  Meh, whatev, I am game.

We really should have taken someone with us who had slightly more &#34;Unagi&#34; (FRIENDS REFERENCE) with us.  &#34;Ahhhh, Salmon Skin Roll&#34;.

OK here is what we ordered:

*Shrimp balls (I don&#39;t know the exact name) as our appetizer.
*Beef Shogayaki - Thinly sliced sirloin sauteed with ginger soy sauce (comes with soup or salad and ice cream for dessert) and I upgraded to fried rice
*Some sort of chopped tuna that came in a mountain-like structure.  If I could tell you what it was called, I would.  But you&#39;re SOL for now!

OK, so the food was good, and the dressing for the salad was delightful.  However our food took a really long time, and it all came out at different times.  Really, really odd times.

It went like this:
My salad
My friend&#39;s meal
Our appetizer
(very closely followed by) my meal and fried rice

So I would have preferred to have the salad/appetizer before the meal, and my friend kept waiting for me to have something else to eat other than salad, but I told him to go ahead.

But my beef was goooood!  And the fried rice was amazing, too!

That being said, I am still a sushi virgin.  I need Candice in my life to show me the way of the sushi.  I will bow down to her.

I want &#34;Unagi&#34;.",09/02/12,200,3,2,2,50,1.4459999999999997,1.94,1.44,18.62,No,1637

sakumas-japanese-restaurant-streamwood,Jerry M.,4VmMkBPqUbVsbk-56SIR0A,o7sKYv_UCZiWRshUnBi4mQ,"After dining at Sakuma&#39;s for over a decade, it is nearly impossible to enjoy any Japanese restaurants other than Sakuma&#39;s! Fans of this restaurant undoubtedly know what I am referring to, but the real differentiators at Sakuma&#39;s are the quality of the food and the technical and artistic skills of the chef.

Chef Sakuma is a perfectionist and professional of the highest quality, and once you have tasted his homemade sauces -- including his unforgettable soy sauce and spicy hot sauce -- you will also have a difficult time enjoying any other Japanese restaurants in Illinois (or the rest of the United States).

I recommend dining at the sushi bar and ordering one of the Chef&#39;s Choice courses (note: Chef&#39;s Choice for Two is great if you are dining with a friend) if you want a unique dinner course that changes each time you visit. Or, if you want to build your own tasting course, then I would recommend ordering several of the artistic and delicious sashimi entrees. My personal favorites are the Ethnic Tuna Sashimi, Sunset Carpaccio, and Hamachi Royale, but the Maguro Crunchy and Helmut Hurricane are also staples of a tasty Sakuma&#39;s diet. If you are more into sushi, then I would recommend the Spicy Tuna roll and the Summer roll, both of which should immediately demonstrate the unique flavors that can only be found at Sakuma&#39;s.

If you do not have a taste for sashimi or sushi, there are many other great options: amazing grilled beef (the skewers are served with an exceptional homemade mustard dipping sauce), numerous hot and cold soups that make wonderful meals (note: the dobin mushi is something each diner should try at least once, and the cold soba noodles and the hot nabeyaki udon that is served in a cast iron bowl are both also unbelievably good), and tasty-yet-healthy salads (that also pair great with a small order of sashimi).

For dessert, the banana tempura with honey and vanilla ice cream should not be overlooked, but I also enjoy the green tea ice cream after completing a Chef&#39;s Choice omakase course.

If you are a sashimi enthusiast and are ever in the Schaumburg/Streamwood/Bartlett area, I would highly recommend taking the time to drive out to Sakuma&#39;s for an authentic and unique Japanese dining experience.",04/09/14,245,5,3,5,52,5.655900000000001,1.4,0.044,8.556,No,2286

My husband and I decide to sit at the Sushi Bar today to see our sushi being created by Chef Sakuma himself!   I especially liked sitting at the Sushi Bar because there is better lighting to take food pictures, BUT I digress. ;)

It was a great experience getting our sushi served to us by Chef Sakuma.  There was a mother and her pre-school child and a friend of hers sitting right in front of Chef Sakuma for lunch.  The kid would occasionally make shrill sounds, but it was fine.  Having kids ourselves, we understood.  Chef Sakuma and his son, Akira(?) were apologizing to us profusely because of that, which I thought was very hospitable of them to do so. It isn&#39;t their fault, but they still expressed their regrets on it.

We had our usual Sushi Set B, but we added two special maki rolls.  Perhaps we were overzealous since we ended up spending about $70 on sushi for LUNCH, but we definitely didn&#39;t leave hungry!  We rolled out like a pair of maki rolls!  Hehe

We had the Green Turtle Roll and the Fantasy Roll.

The Green Turtle Roll was very delicious!  I had never had wasabi tobiko (flying fish roe - wasabi flavored) before, so it caught me by surprise.  

The Fantasy Roll was interesting.  It was deep fried in a tempura batter and had a squeeze of lime on it with raw tuna and jalapeno.  It was also an interesting take on sushi and a unique experience!

Akira had welcomed us again since he remembered us from last week.  So, it&#39;s cool that they remember their customers!

As the only Japanese restaurant to offer Sushi Making Classes to the public, we wanted to do a taste test and decide for ourselves if we would come back as students. I think it would make a great date.

Sakuma offers a 2-hour class for $40. You learn about the basic art of cooking sushi rice, preparation and use of various ingredients which include raw fish, egg and vegetable in making a sushi roll. You learn the technique of presenting it on a plate with a garnish. The best part is, you eat what you make at the end of the course with some green tea.

Cute lounge area tucked away in a corner with a tv, coffee table and couch. The servers wear a kimono. The decor is a bit outdated.

I decided I wanted to order from their dinner menu which included miso soup or house salad and a scoop of vanilla, red bean or green tea ice cream. I chose the Uma Juu.

He ordered the Sashimi Moriawase. A Small order is limited to tuna, flounder, salmon and yellowtail. He ordered the $35 Large portion of the Mixed Variety. The presentation was beautiful and fresh.

The other reviews are right. The looks of it are deceiving. Boring strip mall, bizarre decorating inside.. [I counted 5 ceramic cats from my chair. Not to mention Christmas garland &amp; Valentine&#39;s Day decorations in October]

But the food is crazy good. We love sushi and there aren&#39;t many great options in the Chicagoland suburbs but this is definitely a diamond in the rough. 

I&#39;d skip the $15 Mr. Sakuma&#39;s sampler [think that&#39;s what it was called] and head straight for the other stuff. The Turtle roll was highly recommended and was fantastic. Everything else was fresh &amp; really good. 

If you&#39;re able to reserve a spot at the sushi bar, that&#39;s definitely the place to be. 

Service was a bit slow but nbd. The owner&#39;s wife stopped by afterwards &amp; really seemed to care if we had a good experience, which was nice. 

Will definitely go back.",25/10/10,113,4,1,5,4,4.7556,3.5540000000000003,0.9189999999999999,9.529,No,1022

The maki tasted good, but although we ordered a variety of rolls, they all came out looking almost too similar.

The main reason I gave 2 stars and not 4 was due to our service.  I could never figure out who our server was (it alternated between two).  As it was a Monday night, there were only 4 or 5 other tables being served.  After we were finished eating, it took 25 MINUTES to receive our check.  We were asked if we wanted dessert, and after politely declining, all servers left us.  One of the servers kept walking past us and not even checking in with us, and the other server was drinking wine with a customer at the sushi bar.  I finally had to ask for the check, and it took another 10-15 minutes to receive our check.  With 2 servers and 6 tables, I expected way better service.

We will definitely keep going to our favorite sushi joint (Nikko sushi in Arlington Heights), as the food and service there are outstanding every time.",10/07/12,119,2,1,3,5,2.193,0.9059999999999999,0.0,10.094000000000001,No,1076

Although it may not make you full, it was the fascinating meal. Mr.Sakuma uses a lot of unique and different ingredients which I don&#39;t really expect to see in the US and definitely not in the suburb. We had &#34;Mr.Sakuma&#39;s special&#34; which was in bite size of different appetizers: tempura unagi, seared white tuna in soy sauce, sweet shrimp, tuna and Salmon with Avocado. I highly recommend this one. Another dish was Trio Chilli something. It was raw scallop, squid and octopus with different hot sauces. I love the texture of squid and octopus, not quite sure about the scallop though. Green turtle roll was great. Autumn roll and Scorpion roll was just ok for me. All the food presentations were great that I wish I brought my camera.

There dishes are trasty, usually have rolls (specials in they work with my palet) Beef wrapped in green onions is just yummy!  Joy Lucky is one of my favorite specials which Mr. Sakuma has told me I must drink the liquid afterwards because it&#39;s good and healthy for you.  I always do.  Oh and if you call two weeks ahead of time you can order Sukiaki, which is just so delish!!  The whole restuarant fills up with the smells and everyone else including staff wishes they were having the same thing.  And for dessert, the best is the fried bannana.  There is always room for that!  Yum-O!  

Staff is a little bit slow, but we are Americans people!  Can&#39;t expect them to be any faster then they are because it&#39;s not their custom to runa round the place.

The sushi was simply not good. The usual stuff (salmon rolls, sashimi prices) was mediocre at best: supermarket takeout qualify. But the special plates that everyone raves about were awful! Fish was swimming in tons of sauce, weird flavors, very little actual sushi. 

The worst part though is the service. On a not busy evening, our food took 90 minutes to arrive in full. We had 30 minute gaps between plates. But here is the kicker: our waitress made a rare appearance with a plate of food and announced, &#34;here is your - &#34; Then she paused, brought it closer to her face , and said , &#34;huh! I don&#39;t know what this is!&#34;. Then she took it back to the kitchen (!!!!!!) for a diagnosis.  Seriously? Who wants sushi mystery meat that&#39;s been paraded around a restaurant?

I have to give some props to the very nice older woman who realized the disaster in progress and took off from the bill the cost of our drinks .  Bt then, when we clearly wanted to leave and  told her we weren&#39;t having dessert , she looking pleadingly at our children and tried to talk them into ordering some ice cream. Not cool.

Imagine escaping the bitter Chicago winter by sitting down in front of a steaming bowl of rice covered with egg, chicken, thinly sliced onions, and warm dashi broth.  Pretty simple, but astonishingly satisfying.

In a very non-descript strip mall on a very non-descript corner in Streamwood resides one of Chicago&#39;s finest Japanese restaurants.  This place is sure to satisfy a wide range of expectations.  If you only enjoy sushi rolls, the creativity and technique are amazing.  I would suggest the Turtle Roll and the Summer Roll.  Every item in the elaborate rolls are carefully sliced, balanced in size and tightly rolled.  You can taste the distinct flavors working in harmony.  It&#39;s hard to explain how expertly the rolls are prepared.  Chef Sakuma also has some amazing sashimi dishes Flounder in seared in hot red wine and Hamachi Royale (which I believe is Yellowtail with a Truffle Oil sauce).  If you want traditional Japanese hot dishes, Sakuma&#39;s also excels on this front.  We really enjoy Chawanmushi which is a small dish of steamed custard with bits of shiitake, shrimp and other morsels.  Of course, the sushi and sashimi fish is exceptionally fresh.

Augustino&#39;s did not get the memo.  I ordered the Italian sub and it was the worst I&#39;ve ever had...and I&#39;ve eaten a lot of Italian subs.  
First, the bread was super stale and chewy.  
Second, the meat tasted like it was packed in salt for the past week.  I don&#39;t remember a time that I was so thirsty after a meal. 
Third, a whole raw onion on a sandwich?  Come on...
Fourth, the vinaigrette was very sharp and unappetizing.  They added so much of this vinegar to the sandwich that it pooled in the paper and dripped all over the place.  
I had taken the sandwich to go, so I wasn&#39;t in a position to complain to the staff. 
 
The rock and roll decor inside is a ripoff of Portillo&#39;s, is way too corny and looks antiquated...not in a good way.  The staff was quick and efficient, but other than that, not a fan at all.

I love the fact that everything is made to order and fresh. There can be a big crowd but they seem to move everyone out in a good order. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is nice.

Augustino&#39;s did not get the memo.  I ordered the Italian sub and it was the worst I&#39;ve ever had...and I&#39;ve eaten a lot of Italian subs.  
First, the bread was super stale and chewy.  
Second, the meat tasted like it was packed in salt for the past week.  I don&#39;t remember a time that I was so thirsty after a meal. 
Third, a whole raw onion on a sandwich?  Come on...
Fourth, the vinaigrette was very sharp and unappetizing.  They added so much of this vinegar to the sandwich that it pooled in the paper and dripped all over the place.  
I had taken the sandwich to go, so I wasn&#39;t in a position to complain to the staff. 
 
The rock and roll decor inside is a ripoff of Portillo&#39;s, is way too corny and looks antiquated...not in a good way.  The staff was quick and efficient, but other than that, not a fan at all.  
I suggest they go to a real Italian deli and try a legitimate Italian sub.

Basically, we went into the restaurant in the afternoon to request a loaf of long bread - we buy it on occasion as we love it.  By chance today, we were told they were all out (or on very low reserve), but were waiting for another shipment to come in.  

&#39;Felipe&#39; asked for our number and said he would contact us if the second shipment came in.  We gave him our number and didn&#39;t think much of it actually, we actually later in the day were going to just buy bread elsewhere.

20 minutes later, we get a call from the restaurant from Felipe.  We were actually surprised!  The bread had come in and he said he had saved us a loaf!!  I felt this was extraordinary customer service!

ON TOP OF THIS - when we go to pick up the bread, HE GAVE US ANOTHER LOAF FREE!  Wow!

Extraordinary!  Totally worth of a 5 star review for today&#39;s service!   Thank you!",12/08/12,118,5,1,4,-19,3.9600000000000004,3.327,0.067,10.605999999999998,No,1033

Basically, we went into the restaurant in the afternoon to request a loaf of long bread - we buy it on occasion as we love it.  By chance today, we were told they were all out (or on very low reserve), but were waiting for another shipment to come in.  

&#39;Felipe&#39; asked for our number and said he would contact us if the second shipment came in.  We gave him our number and didn&#39;t think much of it actually, we actually later in the day were going to just buy bread elsewhere.

20 minutes later, we get a call from the restaurant from Felipe.  We were actually surprised!  The bread had come in and he said he had saved us a loaf!!  I felt this was extraordinary customer service!

ON TOP OF THIS - when we go to pick up the bread, HE GAVE US ANOTHER LOAF FREE!  Wow!

Extraordinary!  Totally worth of a 5 star review for today&#39;s service!   Thank you!",12/08/12,118,5,1,4,-19,3.9600000000000004,3.327,0.067,10.605999999999998,No,1033

There&#39;s a left turn lane going north on Rt. 59 that looks like it&#39;s too far from the Menard&#39;s.  Take it.  Otherwise, make the left turn onto North Avenue and take the left turn lane that seems to pass by Augustino&#39;s.  Go in there (instead of a u-turn) and make the left behind the Steak n Shake.  They have their own parking lot and a drive thru.  The place closes at 9 during the week and didn&#39;t push us out, but did turn off the music and some of the outside lights right around then.

The service is good.  It&#39;s not a sit-down restaurant so you put your order in at the front counter and they bring it out to your table when it&#39;s ready.  I had the pastrami on rye with stone ground mustard.  They were nice enough to tell me it would be warm, which I thought it would be.  They gave us our tray with our drinks, straws, and napkins on them.  My friend had the egg salad and we shared an order of the sweet potato fries.  The pastrami is very thinly sliced but they give you a good portion for the $7.49 price.  I don&#39;t really like sweet potatoes but can deal with sweet potato fries.

Too bad the worker&#39;s outfits don&#39;t match but that&#39;s ok

They are known for their deli, so i gave their meatball sandwich a try, with provolone cheese and a side of french fries and chocolate shake.

I will rate this on 3 things: Service, Food variety, taste

Service: very considerate young people who understood that it was our first time and helped us by answering all our questions (****)

Food Variety: they have burgers, hotdogs, meatball sandwiches, deli sandwiches and more! (****)

Taste: meatball sandwich: you can tell its a blend of meats which is a good thing, but i have had better. the bread is toasted and the sauce is good (***)

chocolate shake: thick, chocolate-but not super sweet, just right, wish it wasn&#39;t super thick though (***)

fries: i love fries, and they must have fried this in a different oil because they look like portillo&#39;s fries but don&#39;t taste like them. Definitely have their own identity. (****)

Overall I give this place a 3.5, but I&#39;ll round up for the service i got

It&#39;s a good change from panera and other sub shops, and doesn&#39;t have the portillo&#39;s fast food feel to it. But it does have a competitor right next door (steak n shake).

Both the beef and sausage are the among the best tasting I&#39;ve had. At every bite I am reminded just how bland these ingredients have become elsewhere.

I ate here a lot in high school because one of my friends was obsessed with it. Back then, I usually got some sort of turkey deli sandwich or salad, and I remember really liking it. They also had a to die for keylime cheesecake (one of my favorite things in the world). They didn&#39;t have it this time when I went in - not sure if they were just out of it or if they stopped carrying it (the last time I was there was literally at least 6 years ago - I remember the last time I went there my friends and I grabbed lunch before going to see &#34;White Noise&#34; at the movie theater, so you have an idea of how long ago that was)

My dad told me what he wanted, and it sounded good so I got the same thing - the build your own burger with grilled chicken breast instead of a burger, cheddar cheese, bacon, grilled onion, tomato, lettuce, and honey mustard with a side of fries. The fries were REALLY good - perfect amount of done-ness, not overly greasy, perfectly salty. mmmm.

The chicken was good, not great. However, I had eaten a huge lunch only a few hours earlier, so I wasn&#39;t really all that hungry - I was planning on eating my dinner later, but it smelled good so I decided to eat it right away. My dad seemed to really like his. There was something a little odd-tasting in my opinion on the sandwich - I think it might have been the honey mustard, but I&#39;m not totally sure. They also really pile on the onions, so I took a few off - no biggie. 

The sandwich itself was HUGE. I ate half of it and saved the rest for the next day (which it still tasted good then, maybe even better. Like I said I wasn&#39;t hungry when I ate it so that&#39;s probably why I didn&#39;t love it). It&#39;s expensive (our two orders were $15 total), but they definitely pile in the food.

Overall it was good, and I will be back. I&#39;d love to try the angus burger (not sure why I didn&#39;t order that in the first place), the vegetable panini, and some of the traditional deli sandwichs.",18/01/10,244,4,3,5,81,4.2357,3.1430000000000002,1.327,13.530000000000003,No,2124

Great place to get killer Italian Beef. They also make great deli sandwiches any way you like, including some fine pastrami. I like the Italian sub, no oil, extra hot peppers, or the small Greek salad with peppercini peppers on it.

The walls are lined with some real, some fake rock n roll memorabilia, and there are plenty of flat screens around to watch the game, if you&#39;re so inclined. This Augustino&#39;s has a drive through, too.

I ate here a lot in high school because one of my friends was obsessed with it. Back then, I usually got some sort of turkey deli sandwich or salad, and I remember really liking it. They also had a to die for keylime cheesecake (one of my favorite things in the world). They didn&#39;t have it this time when I went in - not sure if they were just out of it or if they stopped carrying it (the last time I was there was literally at least 6 years ago - I remember the last time I went there my friends and I grabbed lunch before going to see &#34;White Noise&#34; at the movie theater, so you have an idea of how long ago that was)

My dad told me what he wanted, and it sounded good so I got the same thing - the build your own burger with grilled chicken breast instead of a burger, cheddar cheese, bacon, grilled onion, tomato, lettuce, and honey mustard with a side of fries. The fries were REALLY good - perfect amount of done-ness, not overly greasy, perfectly salty. mmmm.

The chicken was good, not great. However, I had eaten a huge lunch only a few hours earlier, so I wasn&#39;t really all that hungry - I was planning on eating my dinner later, but it smelled good so I decided to eat it right away. My dad seemed to really like his. There was something a little odd-tasting in my opinion on the sandwich - I think it might have been the honey mustard, but I&#39;m not totally sure. They also really pile on the onions, so I took a few off - no biggie. 

The sandwich itself was HUGE. I ate half of it and saved the rest for the next day (which it still tasted good then, maybe even better. Like I said I wasn&#39;t hungry when I ate it so that&#39;s probably why I didn&#39;t love it). It&#39;s expensive (our two orders were $15 total), but they definitely pile in the food.

Overall it was good, and I will be back. I&#39;d love to try the angus burger (not sure why I didn&#39;t order that in the first place), the vegetable panini, and some of the traditional deli sandwichs.",18/01/10,244,4,3,5,81,4.2357,3.1430000000000002,1.327,13.530000000000003,No,2124

Great place to get killer Italian Beef. They also make great deli sandwiches any way you like, including some fine pastrami. I like the Italian sub, no oil, extra hot peppers, or the small Greek salad with peppercini peppers on it.

The walls are lined with some real, some fake rock n roll memorabilia, and there are plenty of flat screens around to watch the game, if you&#39;re so inclined. This Augustino&#39;s has a drive through, too.

My only complaint is they charge you for drink refills, which reminds me too much of Portillo&#39;s... But other than that, a worthy destination in the Western Suburbs for beef lovers.

You start out by ordering up front and they will deliver your food to your table.  My friend got the Eggplant Parmesan and I got the Philly Steak Sandwich (both were sub-like buns).  Mine came with fries since it&#39;s a platter (which is basically a plate).  Also got Cheese Styx for both of us.

The Eggplant Parmesan was simply poured onto a single sub-like bun, which the customer is supposed to fold himself.  My friend had a hard time trying to fold it without everything spilling out, especially the parmesan.  He just gave up and ate it like toast.  My Philly was semi-folded on a single sub-like bun, but was much easier to fold.  My sandwich was great.  The Eggplant, besides being unfoldable, was good too.  The Cheese Styx were OK, as long as they were hot.

Visit 1 - 

The girl at the register will not even look at me - while talking on phone with some friend - a full 3 minutes and then casually asked (no sorry for the wait etc)  what will you have !  Then went about putting in the order - yes expectedly - she screwed up or the kitchen -  instead of cheese pav baji - we received cheese DOSA !!  YES !!  and then when I pointed out she offered the Pav - but we were full - refused and she gave a Kulfi !!  But the key -  the total lack of care !  Again even this time - no sincere apology - a simple oh sorry....

This gets better !!  We went in when there was exactly one customer in the cafe !  and the same girl -  I was wondering whats in store - and was not disappointed - this time the order itself was not processed (she did charge me etc)  and left her shift -  and the new guy came -  and we waited a full 20 minutes for a simple gol gapa - and then I approach him - he was - oh I just walked in -  wait I will get you -  again not even a cursory sorry galthi ho gaya !!    and no offer to even compensate for wasting 20 minutes of 2 people !!

To start off, the lady at the register(not sure if she is the owner) is such a sweetheart! This was our first time here after trying the restaurant next door the week before, and we were very excited. The lady was so welcoming and made us feel so good there! She made us a sweet paan at the end that is said to aid in digestion - and it was delicious! 

We ordered a masala dosa which was so delicious that we had to get another one right after. The dosa was so fluffy and warm and not at all dried out like we had had before. It was all just perfect 100%. We also ordered the mumbai pulav and a chicken dish(I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t remember the name and I cannot find the name of it on the menu online). Anyway, both dishes were super good!!!! They were so flavorful and all of the spices complemented each other so well. The food is a bit spicy, but that is the way we like it! If you want it less spicy, we were informed they can adjust to your tastes if you just ask. 

The prices are super affordable, and I&#39;m almost positive that these are the best prices you will find this awesome quality of food in the area. 

The atmosphere is very chill and comfortable. There are plenty of tables to be seated at. Also, there are couches to sit at while you wait for your order or to come hangout.

Great place, one of the best! We definitely will be coming back soon.

So off we headed on a Sunday afternoon.  There were a few people there but there was no one in line as everyone was already seated and enjoying their food.  We grabbed the table near the TV. 

We ordered a plethora of dishes (grilled sandwich, pav bhaji, bhel puri, vada pav, sev puri, and chikoo shake).  Everything practically came out one by one, which gave us a chance to enjoy each item on its own.

The stars of the show were the grilled sandwich and the bhel puri, although we all agreed everything was delicious.

I don&#39;t understand the service issues mentioned by the other Yelpers because the young lady that took our order was as pleasant as can be.  Also, the lady who made our food served it with a smile, so I guess y&#39;all just went on an &#34;off&#34; day?

There is no such a system in order taking it takes more than 30 minutes for them to deliver a simple order. Plus they don&#39;t remember what you order on your order and they have ask you what your order was what kind of system is this??
 What irritates me most is the lady who is always on the a cashier is the rudest person I have ever met on this  earth in my life. She should take classes For  what customer service means and what it is in order for you to gain the business.  I think she would grow far better business if she knew that plus she does not know how to take care of a customer or how to talk to customers in general.  She may think that she&#39;s so all good because she can call out people yeah maybe but you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re causing your business because the way you were talking to customers.  I have seen this over and over at this branch it is nothing but rudest way of talking to customers  I don&#39;t even know how the people take this from her. I personally can&#39;t stand her so that&#39;s why even If I went with family or friend I send them to order bcz I know If she says something i and her will have argument just knowing me how I can&#39;t take wrong stuff.

First Food-  
Vada Pav Just about average
 Pani Puri - will not order it again 
Bombay Grill Sandwich - Don`t get fooled by the name!!! 
Sugarcane Juice - Tasted like they added a spoonful of sugar syrup. The sweetness needs to come from sugarcane itself not from some chemicals.
Falooda- Mehh not at all exciting
Gola -  They got this horribly wrong!! If you have had 1 in Mumbai, please do not compare it with what they serve here. You will be disappointed.
Pan - Saving grace!! loved it.
Ohh BTW good luck navigating through the menu!! 
After all these setbacks, did not try anything else.

Second - Service and Ambiance
They take the order like any fast food restaurant and give you the food by calling out the name of the dish. Now there were 3 people for vada pav.. grab yours before someone else stakes their claim on it. There is a order number on the receipt do not wait for it to be called out. The guys working there are pretty good, but the process is not.
Ambiance - Good idea, bad execution. When you have the space for another 20 people to sit, they do not need a lounger sofa for someone to doze off on. 
It needs more chairs and tables so that people are not standing and staring at someone`s meal..glad I did not get a stomach ache or give one (hopefully) !!
The tables needs to be cleaned properly.. no extra chutneys for me please.
Guy does his job well, but he is understaffed. 

Its a tad expensive cafe...and certainly does not make up for it by food or anything else. 

One of the most standout items- they need is a trash can which can swallow a Styrofoam plate not just a cup. It will be a sound investment.

Service Ambiance - 5/10

Looks pretty neat as of now and I am hoping it stays like this.

First things First: They need to have trash cans. The ones they have cannot fit Styrofoam plates in them and can only be used for napkins, bottles etc,.  I absolutely did not like how there were used trays with leftover food sitting on various tables for long.

Few things I liked: their samosa chaat was pretty good, well balanced with their in-house chutneys. I also enjoyed their dahi puris a lot. 

Wada Pao: This was very basic. I wish they served chutney on side and some fried chillies. But a very mediocre preparation, nothing special.

It was not the same with Pani Puris. These were not as crunchy and the kanji(the gol gappa water) was bland. 

Worst was the Bombay sandwich: it was so soggy that fell apart as picked from the plate. This when I ate in India, we had option of grilling the sandwich, which is fine, I could have liked it, if it stayed in place. The bread was extremely wet with chutneys and potatoes were bland. I would not recommend this to anyone. 

Paans: My husband tried the meetha paan and he liked it, so I guess after dinner we could hit this place for paans pretty often.

Sugarcane juice: Loved it! Please go for some refreshing gingery &#34;ganne ka ras&#34;.

All in all, it&#39;s worth trying but nothing extraordinary.

Just go with bunch of friends and eat some chaat/bombay shahi sandwich then have coffee ..  Have fun !!

The food is absolutely very tasty and it tastes like homemade food. We love Neelu, the owner, who provides excellent service to her customers. She treats customers just like her family members. If you are in Chicago area, you MUST visit Mumbai Caf. During our stay in Chicago, we went there at least for one meal everyday. Sudha, the master Chef, is amazing and can customize the food to your taste. The Caf has a good variety of menu options. You can expect to enjoy whatever you select from their menu.

Overall, Mumbai Caf is a lovely restaurant for a nice Indian lunch or dinner. We really enjoyed the food here and the price is very reasonable. Neelu, thank you for the delicious food and the absolutely the best service you provide to your customers.

As this establishment is new, we decided to stop in. The place was bustling and we placed our order, which was 1 dubley burger and 3 three-layered sandwich. While picking up our order, I requested glasses for water and the cashier&#39;s response shocked me. The owner stated that we can &#34;buy&#34; water bottles and that there is no cooler or water fountain available. Health wise, this opportunity to &#34;make more money&#34; will come at the cost of Mumbai Cafe&#39;s customers. Around 60 percent of our body is water, therefore, in order to digest food, water is a pertinent necessity.  Having no access to water, depresses our appetite and we eat less, a fact that this establishment has, perhaps, not considered. If we eat less because there is no water to process food, we will buy less of the food at Mumbai Cafe. I am an able bodied healthy individual, what if I needed water to swallow my medicine? What if I was at all sick in any form? dehydrated? In my case, I was parched and required some fluid between my snack and chai. Not having public access to water for Mumbai Cafe&#39;s customer not only does my culinary experience disservice, it causes loss of appetite for its customers. Since I have to pay extra for water, I will eat less and therefore, will not frequent the establishment or chose not to come at all.

We first started going because of the great lunch deal. Over time that deal has become more sub-par but we still go. Only for one reason, the food is actually pretty good. Of all the Mexican restaurants in the area, they are probably my favorite when it comes to the food. 

The service on the other hand is a joke. A few years ago it was good, but as of recent its been nothing but horrible.In fact a handful of my friend&#39;s just plain won&#39;t go because the service is so bad. Recently a single guy runs the entire place (probably because they don&#39;t get many customers over lunch), he is terrible. He&#39;s rude, slow and just everything that&#39;s wrong with service. In fact he has argued with people in our party before over the lunch special.He gets really angry when you ask him what the lunch special is.

Recently they swapped out the old furniture for some really crappy used furniture and opened up a second side to the restaurant. I&#39;m not even sure why they expanded, I can&#39;t ever recalling more than 1 other table having people at it when we&#39;ve been there in the past. It&#39;s especially surprising seeing that Noodles right next door is always packed.

The rice is the equivalent of white rice with a splash of yellow food coloring and the retried beans taste like they came from a can. 

The service here sucks and the only thing worth coming for are the margaritas which taste good but have minimal booze in them. The last time I came here the waitress was rude and acted like we were an inconvenience. None of us got the salt or sugar rims on our margaritas that we ordered. Mine did get a special garnish though. I pulled out a piece of the bartenders hair. When I told the waitress she asked me if I was sure it wasn&#39;t mine (which was back in a ponytail with a head band, longer and lighter colored). She finally offered to replace it for me but still charged me for it. I was annoyed that she suggested I would complain about my own hair.

marias-mexican-bar-and-grill-roselle,Lilly C.,1nQDJnC0afNlDjxcFQhI-A,isDetOUeLrdHNS6vc3UZQg,"It cannot be overstated what a tremendous disaster this sub-par restaurant is.  My sister and I came here about a year and a half, two years ago and the service was poor at best.  I requested a Patron margarita, I received a margarita with what was CLEARLY well tequila (i.e. the cheapest bathtub tequila one can find).  Rest assured, the server charged me for the Patron.  They serve a white ranch dip with their chips and salsa which is probably the least Mexican food item I can think of.   An employee&#39;s child loudly played nearby.  It was a terrible experience.  

But, everyone has a bad day and apparently I&#39;m a glutton for punishment because I went back there thinking they got their stuff together and listened to customer complaints and improved.  NOPE!  I walked in and the server (who appeared to be the only person working front of house) was standing directly in front of me waiting on one of two occupied tables.  Two men came in behind me.  The server finally acknowledged us and said &#34;sit anywhere you want&#39;.  Okay, thanks for the friendly greeting.  I sat down, waiting for my menu.  Nothing.  I finally see the server bring the two men who came in behind me their chips, salsa and Lay&#39;s Ranch Dip and ask if they&#39;re ready to order.  Huh?  I stood up to leave and said &#34;Excuse me, just so you know, I was here before they were&#34; and walked out.  Shout out to the two &#34;gentlemen&#34; who allowed this to happen instead of saying &#34;She was here first&#34;.  

Businesses need to worry less about reviews on Yelp and worry more about serving their customers in a way that doesn&#39;t get them a poor review.  Never again.

We came in hungry, so we decided to split the queso fundito (?) which proved to be a great choice.  We didn&#39;t use the tortillas it comes with but rather just dipped our chips in it.  The meat and cheese were both tasty.  The chips and salsa were up to snuff as well.

Let&#39;s give this a shot... 

I&#39;m a gringo and the way I know any restaurant is good is by the level of service I receive and the quality of the food as soon as my meal is concluded. If there are others eating there the food might be good (shocker, there were). Non gringos might feel their food is good too (wish I could comment on authenticity but I&#39;m a gringo that&#39;s never gone anywhere outside a resort town in Mexico). The rice was cooked perfectly. The chorizo was normal ol&#39; chorizo (yum), al pastor was so ridiculously tender and juicy that I&#39;d wish I&#39;d ordered more for the road and the carnitas were tender and juicy but could&#39;ve used a bit more flavor. The refried beans I&#39;ve known and loved all my life tasted like the same ones I&#39;ve had everywhere else, I&#39;m a fan of black personally but you won&#39;t find me complaining. The waitresses appeared to be having a good day and well I&#39;m selfish... because whether they were or weren&#39;t doesn&#39;t quite matter so much to me, their service and attitude was great throughout. I can&#39;t speak about the bartender because she didn&#39;t serve me but the patrons occupying her stools appeared to be in good spirits *ba dum tsh*.

I have frequented this establishment almost daily since it opened not only to try out the menu but because everyone who works there is friendly and inviting. Many restaurants claim fresh food, but Maria&#39;s is hands down the best in this area. Made to order fresh Mexican food is hard to come by, and in my opinion, Maria&#39;s is spot on. Portion sizes are very generous which makes for this big guy with a big appetite very happy, but can also serve as a nice meal to share or even for leftovers.  Fresh squeezed fruit cocktails (margaritas and mojitos!),  4 Mexican beers on draft and a friendly staff who are always smiling makes for a wonderful experience. My humble recomendations are as follows. Appitizer: Elote (Mexican Grilled corn) served with tortilla chips. Lunch: Torta (Mexican sandwich) with choice of meat. Dinner: Many to choose from but I will say the Burrito Suizo. *note: very large portion*. There are many more delicious food to try and I recommend trying them out for yourselves.  I have heard some complaints about the lack of a extremely spicy sauce but a restaurant can&#39;t try to kill people with heat.  The spice level is fine and people who don&#39;t like spicy food can feel very comfortable eating here.  I am also quite sure the kitchen can whip up a &#34;fire sauce&#34; upon request.

Time of my visit: Lunch time

I decided to go to this place based on Yelp! reviews.  There is a huge selection of different options, I chose Hug Heaven.  I had an option of hot or cold, I picked cold and it came with the chips.  I also ordered large iced tea.  Right from the top, I was told, it would be just one free refill (I really appreciated that).  I reached out to pay with my AMEX and was told they did not accept it.  Sorry, but this is such a pet peeve of mine, either accept them all or be a cash only, this selected cards only is none-sense to me.

It did not take long for them to get me my food. While waiting I did notice there was a price difference between what was in the menu and what I was charged.  It was not a big difference, but nonetheless could be a bit confusing.  When my lunch arrived, the sandwich did not look all that big (size wise), maybe a little over 6 inches in length.  Chips were your typical, out of the bag, big brand chips, I was hoping for home style, home made chips.  The sandwich was not anything spectacular or out of this word, your typical deli sandwich, warmed up.  The bread was too soft for my liking.  Overall, I was not all that impressed and for pennies under $10, I was expecting a heck lot more.

I must comment and compliment on three things, efficiency, the food came out fast.  The cleanness, the place looked like you could eat off the floor.  The service, the service was awesome!  The lady behind the counter, the lady who brought out my food, both were very polite, sweet and nice.

However, C- is the best I can do.  It&#39;s almost not worth a drive for me on my lunch.",22/09/16,203,3,2,5,33,5.019800000000001,3.3360000000000003,0.818,17.846,No,1672

Upon entering to meet Jacqueline B. for lunch, I was greeted sweetly by the lady at the counter. I wouldn&#39;t say the menu is overwhelming but there is a LOT to choose from. You&#39;re not weird if you need to ask for a minute to browse through all of the different types of hot and cold sandwiches and the rest of the menu. I picked up a bottle of water from the open refrigerated section by the counter, ordered myself a chicken pesto asiago panini and took a seat. It was immediately in the middle of a lunch rush so I&#39;m surprised I had gotten a table! This place gets crowded!

I have very few preferences and opinions when it comes to food so I thought my panini was a-ok to me. All paninis come with a side of chips which doesn&#39;t sound very filling but the sandwich was actually larger than I had thought it would be. The chicken was pretty scarce within the sandwich but the panini bread made up for it. The prices were what I expected (and had read from previous reviews). The prices are definitely comparable to a Panera lunch.

The one qualm I have about Crave is that from the chatter and conversations as well as the music throughout, it was really difficult to hear the lady say the order when your meal was ready. From the ambience and looks of the place, I had honestly thought your order gets brought to your table - especially because there is outdoor seating. It may be really inconvenient for those outdoor customers to peek in-and-out to see if their food is ready.

Overall, the space was nicely decorated, very clean and had a nice rustic look to it with the warm colors and dark wood.

I really hate giving bad reviews but their food is nothing spectacular. Perhaps I had too much expectations given that this place was 4.5 out 5 stars (33 reviews). It was a total let down for me. I do appreciate the variety of sandwiches they offer. 

They advertise fresh soup which maybe it was but the taste was bland. I had the mushroom soup and it was bland with big slices of mushrooms. 

I asked for their most popular sandwich and the lady said it was the chicken pesto panini. The bf had that and I had the Cuban panini. The chicken pesto was bland with tasteless chicken and same with the pork in the Cuban sandwich. Both meats were tasteless and it could&#39;ve been more tender. The bread... Have you ever had a sandwich that hurt the top of your palate because the bread was too hard??? Yep, the bread on this one surely didn&#39;t make the cut either. I ended up taking out the meat and leaving the bread uneaten. 

The Cuban panini came with seasoned fries. $8.95. The meat filled half of the sandwich, but then again if you don&#39;t enjoy the taste, why have more of it?  Not worth it. Chicken pesto panini came with chips. $8.99. Not worth it either.

Crave Cafe is one of the good choices. The small caf has about 10 tables and it&#39;s half full at lunch time on a Saturday. The menu reminds me of Panera Bread, with sandwiches (hot and cold), soup, salads, but there are also at least 5 different kinds of burgers and some &#34;south of the border&#34; choices. 

I decided to go with the special of the day: fish tacos with fries. Each of the 3 tacos had a good-sized well-seasoned fresh-off-the-grill tilapia fillet, not small pieces of unidentified fish like many other fish tacos. I devoured all of them. The crispy fries were the best I&#39;ve had in a long time. If the weather was cooler, I would have tried one of their homemade soups. 

The San Antonio Burger he (by he, I mean my spouse of choice) got was a little messy to eat due to the BBQ pulled pork, but he said it&#39;s yummy. 

Prices are on a par with fast casual restaurants, but you can expect more of &#34;made from scratch&#34; here.

They serve Coca-Cola products from the fountain, but they also have a cooler with water, juice and Pepsi products as well.

 First of all, this place is immaculate, clean, bathrooms were spotless, shiny, attractive artwork and a fragrant aroma.  Floors were spotless.  Attendant was very helpful and for only an additional twenty cents I upgraded to a meal for my Bleu burger with carmelized onions.  Food came quickly to our table, the french fries, which I almost didn&#39;t order were fantastic.  Owner buys a seasoned fry, pays extra, but they were crispy, tasty and golden brown.  Just the way I like them.   The sandwich, which only cost $5.29 was GOURMET all the way.  Bleu cheese, was so tasty and not an incredibly strong bite, perfect for my tastes.  The Bleu cheese is a Stella&#39;s product which is an excellent brand of food.  Owner goes high end with all of his food orders, pays extra for a higher quality of food.  

Atmosphere was pleasant, they had a nice run of lunch customers which were taken care of quickly.  We were able to relax, no hustle and bustle, here,   Great mood to enjoy  friends and good food.  Not noisy like many restaurants.

I had time to burn while waiting for the significantly better half to finish up at an event in Elgin so I planned on stopping in to another coffee shop downtown.
With construction detours, I got turned around, redirected, lost and, unsurprisingly, a tad annoyed.
As I got close to where I thought I wanted to go, I grabbed the first street parking spot I saw.
After dusting off my seriously rusty parallel parking skills, I noticed that i had parked about 50 feet away from a different coffee shop/cafe.
The second thing I noticed was the huge free parking lot across the street. DOH!

As I approached it, I saw that he uses Lavazza, which I like, so, bonus.

I poked my head in to take a look before committing.

There wasn&#39;t a clutch of guys in the corner, clearly regulars, holding court, shooting the breeze.
The owner was behind the counter and his daughter was running the register.
And the guy was talking with everyone in the place. And EVERYONE who came in got a very genuine Good Morning!
The place is small. 5 tables with 2 chairs each, and some stools at a counter.

I had a large mocha which was very good. He uses better syrups, so there isn&#39;t any weird aftertaste like some other places.
I also indulged in a breakfast sandwich, eggs, ham, cheese pressed in a panini press.
The bread was excellent. He uses Italian rolls which crisp up really well in the press.
Next time I&#39;ll have him slap some roasted peppers or giardinera on the sandwich to really feed the need.

This is clearly a neighborhood joint. People know each other, greet each other. The vibe is very congenial.  After I was done with the breakfast sandwich and coffee, Leo, the owner, stopped over to clear the dishes and introduce himself.  A brief chat and he was back behind the counter helping the next batch of patrons.

This place was exactly what I was looking for on a slow Saturday morning.

I&#39;ll definitely be back.

It is now the Domani Cafe, which opened in 2009.

We ordered a large Latte, a Chai Tea Latte, and an almond poppyseed muffin and grabbed a little table outside on the sidewalk. Everything was perfect. Drinks were delicious and muffin was yummy. They use Ghirardelli syrup (nice!), and they tasted like very high quality drinks. Reasonable prices too. Total was only $10, which I&#39;m guessing is about $2-3 less than what that order would be at Starbucks.

I really loved the atmosphere too. Cute little rustically designed cafe with outdoor seating , which was exactly what I was missing from my chain coffee classics.

We were greeted as soon as we entered by the owner, Leo Urdenata - great guy, clearly passionate about his business, and providing both delicious products as well as great service.
Being our first visit, we asked Mr. Urdenata for his recommendations - Both the coffee (Cuban Latte) and sandwiches (ham, egg &amp; cheese and Cuban) were fabulous! Infact, the Cuban was one of the best I have ever had.       

The small caf located on Highland is conveniently located for a quick stop on the way to the Metra station or the post office. There are a few tables inside to relax and read the paper over a great cup of coffee.

Brock: Tell me to either turn left or right; just direct me to food.

I have been here 3 times because I love their all you can eat special but all three times the women serving us has been ridiculously rude and overbearing.

The second time I was there, it was a party of seven adults. We ordered about 24 rolls. She came back to us and told us we ordered 36 and it was too much and that she would charge $1 per piece left. We told her its fine and to just keep it coming. She purposely brought us one roll at a time, telling us she&#39;s slowing service because we ordered too much. We were the only ones in the resturant at the time so its not because they were busy. Every time she bought us a plate she repeated that we ordered too much, that she would charge us and that we had 30 left (Which was obviously not true because we ordered less than that initially).

Every. Single. Time. 

We were all so sick of her that we just told her to cancel the rest of the rolls and we left. This is an ALL YOU CAN EAT place last time I checked and 3 rolls a person is not excessive.

All three times I went there she was like this. Needless to say I have not been back nor will I be going back.

abashiri-bloomingdale,Jennifer P.,bDXSrl19qIe0Hb-cZcCJ5A,pCDat8Cg4xoZkR7gWbO1Xw,"The Good:
I&#39;ve visited twice since my last review.. Maki (roll) presentation is clean/attractive and portions are good. They haven&#39;t been heavy on the rice the last two times I&#39;ve visited; ingredients are much more balanced. Ingredient quality is also decent.

Oh, and it&#39;s a cute, clean space (bathrooms included). It&#39;s Japanese-owned, which I was surprised about, since all the ones I&#39;ve been to have Chinese or Korean owners and/or employees.


The Meh:
Service is slow when they aren&#39;t even that busy (tonight at 8:30 it was 3 tables of 2-5, including ourselves). We were seated for about 10 minutes before we got our AYCE sheets, and had to ask for them. Apparently you now have to ask for the (super salty!) miso soup, too. They&#39;re stingy with wasabi and ginger, again, unless you ask. Good luck flagging down the owner(&#39;s wife?), though - she&#39;s often behind the counter and doesn&#39;t really scan the dining area. She&#39;s not very welcoming or warm, but I feel she&#39;s a teensy bit more attentive after you&#39;ve been there for a bit.

The pictures on the menu are a general representation (stock photos?), but we&#39;ve been surprised (sometimes pleasantly, sometimes not) by some variations. This last visit we shared 6 rolls between the two of us and it was perfect. We typically get the Tempura and Fresh variety, and skip over the Hot/Cooked ones.


To Sum:
&#34;A-OK&#34;: we only come here if we can&#39;t make the hour round-trip drive to a different (and $6 cheaper per person) AYCE sushi joint.",04/08/15,190,3,1,4,-15,3.6118,2.326,0.374,15.300999999999997,No,1557

We had been going to 8000 mile almost on auto-pilot every time we wanted sushi. BUT NOW we have options! Abashiri offers a much more intimate dining experience and a much wider array of sushi options. It is also much more authentic Japanese cuisine.

Additionally, if you stuff your face with enough sushi, they will automatically roll you over to the unlimited sushi plan. Which is about $25 a person and includes UNLIMITED SUSHI. If you plan on going with the unlimited plan,might as well start and continue with the premium rolls.

abashiri-bloomingdale,Lindsey B.,y0EdiHf1fbpjYj2kJCOo2w,APMeiGnVey8Pp1FL_hxIfA,"Since moving to Bloomingdale from Chicago last year and being totally spoiled in the city for the last decade and a half by all the fabulous sushi restaurants (many within walking distance of my house), I&#39;ve found it very difficult to find good sushi in this area. This place had a decent overall rating, most people seemed to really enjoy it, so I figured &#34;it can&#39;t be that bad&#34; and gave it a shot. I ordered 2 rolls and 2 nigiri. The price was almost $50. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve been to MANY sushi places and I understand sushi is pricey. But this was crazy especially since I was ordering things like super white tuna and spicy tuna rolls. Nothing fancy really! But, I have needs, so I bit my tongue and paid up. The nigiri was ok, nothing to write home about. The spicy tuna was intolerable. The rice was hard, the tuna was almost non existent and what was there was tasteless and incredibly spongey which is a really strange texture for spicy tuna. Usually I&#39;ll power through and eat it anyway because I really love sushi, but I couldn&#39;t even eat it. I honestly don&#39;t remember what the other roll was that I ordered, but I ate a couple pieces and tossed that one too. I can&#39;t get on the same page with these 4 or 5 star reviews. I wish I could, because this restaurant is so close to my house. The food wasn&#39;t worth the price tag at all. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll even give it another shot. Maybe...

Interior is clean and quaint. When I stopped in for lunch there were a few actual Japanese patrons eating here which was a good sign. The menu is pretty extensive and they have a lot of good lunch combos.  I ordered sushi combo B which came with miso soup. The soup was hot and tasty. My combo came with 5pcs of sushi and I upgraded to spicy tuna roll instead of California roll. Sushi was tasty fresh and well prepared. Service was prompt even with one server handling 6 tables.

The husband has taken a liking to sushi and so we are working the circuit. We pulled up in the parking lot on a week night intending on all you can eat sushi. At least that was the plan. 

When we walked in, we were promptly seated and given menus to review. I really liked their bento box options, so I went that route while my husband placed an order for a few rolls to start his AYCE adventure. 

The food took a while. A lot longer than he expected. I was prepared having read the reviews over the years. The waitress was pretty focused which meant that eye contact didn&#39;t really mean anything. If you want something, ask for it when she&#39;s at the table. She was the only one working the room, so she was busy. 

The sushi made my husband happy. He filled up way too quickly since the food was taking so long. I enjoyed my teriyaki chicken, the tempura veggies and shrimp, the salad and the California roll. 

When he decided that he just couldn&#39;t eat anymore, we asked for the check and the waitress just charged us for the rolls he ordered instead of the AYCE price since it was less that way. I appreciated that move on her part. I can see going back, but might try for an off time in the hopes that the food hits the table quicker to make the AYCE worth it.",04/10/14,146,4,1,5,6,4.1781999999999995,2.202,0.049,15.748999999999999,No,1323

The first time I visited was for a UYE AYCE sushi. I had no idea what to expect but between 7 of us we managed to eat A LOT of sushi. 

For those of you that don&#39;t know the &#34;Yelp Lingo&#34; yet, UYE - Unofficial Yelp Event and AYCE - All You Can Eat. Ughhh....I just became one of THOSE people, who say Lingo. lol

Since the first time and to the last time I visited, it still stands, my favorite is the Lion King roll, I just can&#39;t get enough. Whatever sauce they put on top is on POINT!  My second favorite would have to be the Mango &amp; Tuna rolls. Yummmm-O! (As Rachel Ray would say, is she still around?)

I&#39;d have to say the oddest thing I&#39;ve tried at Abashiri is their shrimp boat.....sounds cool doesn&#39;t it? No, it actually doesn&#39;t. At all. lol

Well, I&#39;m not going to lie, I had to talk myself into eating this. It&#39;s a piece of open faced shrimp, topped with white rice, a quail egg and caviar. NEVER in my life would I have tried that but I&#39;ve learned that in life, you should always try things at least once. So I closed my eyes, inserted the boat in my mouth and closed it. To my surprise it was SOOOOO good! I could not believe that I, Osiris V, liked that slimy quail egg caviar topped thingy. haha But the combination gave it an exquisite flavor. If you visit, you should definitely try it for your selves. 

Just remember, AYCE sushi is only from Monday through Thursday and it runs around $25/pp. Which is not bad at all considering if you order one plate it runs you about 12-14. So it&#39;s very worth it.

Abashiri gladly seated us and stayed patient with us as we struggled on what to order since everything sounded so delicious and there were many first timers.

Now that I&#39;m here in Bloomingdale, well, options for any kind of quality eats run scarce. You know the feeling. Yes, YOU DO. It took me two years to finally get my yellow ass to Abashiri, but not for lack of trying.  Luckily, relatives from the Rock were in town and I sprung at the chance to experience this joint. 

It&#39;s small, so claustrophobes beware. At least it&#39;s clean, so claustrophilic clean-freaks, come on down! It appears that Abashiri is actually owned by Japanese people, a weirdly refreshing change from all the Chinese-owned sushi bars in Chicagoland, which explains the more authentic feel and flavor. 

I pigged out because 1) a well-heeled relative was paying, 2) I hadn&#39;t had access to Japanese food for way too long, and 3) I figured I&#39;d work it off later that evening. Whelp, that last one was a bust. Maybe tomorrow. 

I really enjoyed the salmon tempura roll, with its crunchy, flaky bits of salmon and a light drizzle of unagi sauce. No one else would touch my Mexican roll, a fun, punchy riff on a spicy tuna roll that featured the addition of cilantro and chopped jalapeno (seeds included). It made this heat-loving Korean happy, but I have never been so glad to have been prescribed ultra-strength omeprazole. The katsudon was perfect, but perfect, the sweet soy sauce dripping down from the egg-onion-fried pork cutlet raft onto the rice. And in spite of the bones that required the deft kind of chopstick usage that I&#39;ve never managed to master, the salmon shioyaki (&#34;salt-broiled&#34;) was the best I&#39;ve ever had. Plus, if you&#39;re anything like my omnivorous grandpa, you&#39;ll crunch on the bones anyway and say they&#39;re good for your own bones. 

All that said, the sushi did not wow my socks off, and the rice was your standard domestic calrose rice - no super-polished short-grain koshihikari loveliness here - but the food was fresh, tasty and satisfying.

Also, service is amazing, and the lady waitress was really nice. We were hungry and did not hear before ordering the unlimited that if you do order it you have to eat it all, can&#39;t take it home. If there is leftovers you get charged per roll. Honestly, we did not hear that and the lady was sweet and let us off the hook.

abashiri-bloomingdale,Jessica P.,dbjE2GM2UzCiNFRj28TcTw,H4o5pA7_dVyXnLOdCbWfkA,"I came here for lunch with my co-worker..at around 12:30PM...No wait to get seated, but I&#39;m sure it depends on the day..

Food:
All you can eat SUSHI ROLLS ($24.95): comes with free miso soup and the overall sushi rolls are good, I enjoyed the crab and lobster meat sushi rolls..

Kalbi Sushi roll.. it&#39;s just a little odd.. I think Sushi is meant for Fish....I guess you can get it if you want some Kalbi in your meal...it&#39;s just ok tasting.. I&#39;d just go to a kalbi place if I was craving kalbi..

Costs: it&#39;s sushi.. so on the higher end..the all you can eat is decent...if you want to try out different rolls, I&#39;d recommend that you just get the all you can eat so your not limited to only 1-2 rolls... if you order 2-3 rolls ... it&#39;ll probably be equivalent to $24.95...so yea.. 

Sushi Rolls ranges from ~$10-$13+ per roll that contain around 6+ pieces?...they are just average sized rolls...thankfully they didn&#39;t stuff my rolls with rice...

Wait time: no wait to get seated...wait for sushi wasn&#39;t too long..

Parking: located in a small strip mall..so you might have to walk a little if there&#39;s limited spots closer to the restaurant (meaning 10 steps to restaurant)... plenty of parking...:)

Atmosphere: it&#39;s sort of small so I wouldn&#39;t come here with a huge huge group, but with around 4 people it would be good...I came during lunch time so I just saw ppl eating here during their lunch break...

**Note: all you can eat is ONLY for Sushi Rolls..and if you have leftovers or can&#39;t finish your food.. they&#39;ll charge you..so be cautious in not ordering too much food that you can&#39;t eat..

It&#39;s good.. maybe I&#39;d come here again for dinner instead of lunch...not a good feeling when you feel like your going to explode (too much eating) + food coma returning to work for another 4 hrs.. which seems like forever! :)",24/05/13,224,4,1,2,-19,1.4502,1.138,0.013,0.849,No,1892

However, I&#39;m allergic to shellfish and finding rolls sans shrimp or crab was mighty hard. Nearly all their rolls have some type of shellfish included and if not that had jalapeno. I&#39;d go back to Abashiri but skip the AYCE madness and stick to just ordering a few things on the regular menu. It wasn&#39;t quite worth the price tag for me.

The rolls at Abashiri are a bit smaller than other places, however they offer a good variety of options. It was packed to the brim on the weekend and because of this it would take forever to get our rolls. I&#39;m talking 20 minutes of waiting with no food during our break times. It would be better if they brought the rolls out as they were made instead of waiting for a few &amp; bringing them out together.

All in all, I enjoyed Abashiri but am not rushing to get back. I absolutely would like to go again and try more items from them!",09/01/14,103,3,1,1,-32,0.7004000000000001,0.96,0.724,10.315999999999999,No,1008
abashiri-bloomingdale,Joe P.,N6awZcFSEJbIhjrK0way9w,Px0PNoK6U8b6i5e-E8QksA,"The sushi is actually pretty good. I was surprised because it&#39;s sort of tucked in a little strip mall. The inside is pretty small, only about 10 tables or so. 

It has a pretty good selection of sushi and tasty dishes for those who do not like sushi. They have changed a few thing with the all you can eat though, no more sushimi. 

The only negative is that it takes A LONG TIME to get your sushi if they have more than 4 tables of people. They only have two chefs cooking so It will take about 30 minutes an order at least if they are &#34;busy&#34;. 

The servers are very very personable and will joke around with you. They are also very knowledgeable about the different types of rolls and such.

abashiri-bloomingdale,Angela P.,3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg,_tAlmMTcL0ODqrsmI7CeLA,"Abashiri has easily earned five stars this time around.  My husband and I went here on a Monday night for AYCE sushi.  At $25/person and the awesome variety of sushi, it was well worth the 40-minute drive for us.  My only hang-up about this place previously was the long wait between rolls.

On a Monday night, there were a few occupied tables, and while the service was a tad slow, it felt faster since there were only two of us.  We split six rolls and left stuffed.  

My favorites are still the Paradise, Godzilla, Mango Tuna, and Crunchy Rainbow.  The Spicy Tuna was a little mushy, and the Mexican is too spicy with the amount of jalapeno and cilantro used, but my husband loves it.

On my previous visit...

Abashiri has all-you-can-eat sushi for $25/person, and that deal includes Friday nights!  I&#39;ve done the AYCE at a few places in the suburbs, places that do it all week, but they don&#39;t do it nearly as well as Abashiri.  Even though there are at least two other spots much closer to home for me, the 45 minute drive to Abashiri was well worth it.

I went here for a friend&#39;s birthday (happy birthday Ericka A!), and I had a great time.  Although Abashiri isn&#39;t responsible for whether or not you enjoy read more &#34; your company, my point is that doing AYCE is even better with a larger group of people.  Since they charge you extra if you do not finish what you order, it&#39;s totally safe to order something just to try it.  

My favorite rolls were the Paradise and Godzilla.  We also had the Mango &amp; Tuna, Crunchy Rainbow (even better than a regular rainbow!), Mexican (a little too spicy), Tiger, Lion King, Double Salmon, and I&#39;m certain I&#39;ve forgotten a lot more.  There were 7 of us, which means lots of rolls, and there was only ONE I didn&#39;t care for, it was baked and burnt the roof of my mouth.

The menu is HUGE.  AYCE includes miso soup, green tea, and a menu of 40 rolls to choose from!  Abashiri definitely has the biggest and best variety of rolls, and there&#39;s no way you will get through them in one visit!

The only reason I&#39;m giving Abashiri four stars and not five is because the service is so damn slow.  Initially, our rolls came out like 3 at a time, but then they came out in intervals of one roll.  In a big group, one roll doesn&#39;t last long!  I almost started to wonder if it&#39;s some kind of strategy - if they bring out the food slowly, we won&#39;t feel like sitting around any longer, and we won&#39;t keep ordering, right?  Of course, if we had ordered more, we might have faced the dreaded doom of paying extra for uneaten pieces.  You really just can&#39;t win.

The bottom line is that it&#39;s the best AYCE sushi in the suburbs.  Move over, Sakura!",10/12/13,326,5,2,5,49,5.450499999999999,4.154000000000001,1.341,24.504,No,2746

Put it in my mouth. I said my muthaf*ckin mouth...

Yep. That happened. &#39;Cause I&#39;m eatin&#39; all-you-can-eat sushi like all.damn.day... okay, maybe not all damn day, but defo for a few hours and defo enough sushi that a regular person probably could have spaced the quantity out to last the whole day. So there&#39;s that. 

Miso soup, green tea, sushi rolls like whoa and these little shrimp + raw quail egg boats that aren&#39;t part of the AYCE special, but are pretty much life changing and something you should for sure plan on getting on top of the AYCE menu.  

And while the sushi rolls weren&#39;t the freshest, nor the greatest, the $24.95 AYCE price and the variety of specialty rolls is outta control. I don&#39;t why you&#39;d do anything but that... and those shrimp+quail egg boats. 

I was glad I went with a decent sized group so we could all pig the f out and try a little bit of what felt like almost everything. I&#39;d get into specifics but honestly, I ate so much that it all kind of became a blur. In fact, at one point I actually inhaled the seaweed part of a roll that had come undone and partially lodged in my windpipe. I tried to dislodge it with my tongue and then by deep-throating my chopsticks to try and grab it, but then it became apparent that if I didn&#39;t get up and try to purge this piece in the bathroom, that I was probably going to involuntarily puke at the table with my group, or die choking on a friggin&#39; sushi roll at an AYCE sushi restaurant like some modern-day Mama Cass. 

Anyway, I *somehow* summoned all my strength and was able to clear a tiny part of my wind-pipe to silently excuse myself from the table and take care of business in the bathroom. I *think* I was discreet enough that no one noticed at the time, but figured it best that I come clean now so as to squash any suspicion of an eating disorder. No habitual or voluntary purging here, just a shoveler by nature and sometimes I pay the price. 

Anyway, check out the pics and see for yourself. I didn&#39;t take pictures of everything because we got sooo much stuff and I didn&#39;t want to be that super annoying and make everyone wait to eat before I can figure out how to work my flash.",08/10/12,255,4,1,3,-14,2.6082,1.7810000000000001,0.824,14.395999999999999,No,2280

This night began at a sports bar next door where I was watching some football &amp; my friend came up with the idea to get some sushi.  I not only had not eaten here before but I didn&#39;t know of any sushi restaurants in Bloomingdale, let alone an all you can eat sushi restaurant.  

When you find an all you can eat sushi place it is a good thing but when you find an all you can eat sushi restaurant with AYCE sushi it is a really good thing, except for your pants that might feel tighter from eating so much food.  

The staff here was very nice &amp; the sushi all seemed very fresh.  The rolls here were prepared differently than some other places which is a good thing.  It is always nice to try different styles.  

I enjoyed my experience here.  The only things that I can mention that weren&#39;t the best is that the rolls were a little bit smaller than some other places.  The price was also $25 for all you can eat while other popular all you can eat sushi restaurants offer $15.99 for lunch &amp; $18.99 for dinner.  Other than that it was an enjoyable experience.  I would eat here again if I was in the area.",02/01/14,112,4,2,4,34,3.3807,2.09,0.232,9.678,No,1190
abashiri-bloomingdale,Lylian D.,msPQ035okr0DF7xnrkt3_Q,#NAME?,"Our first stop after 4 hours of driving from East Lansing to the Chicago suburbs was Abashiri, referred to us by my foodie Chicagoan friends. We were so excited to take on the &#34;all-you-can-eat sushi&#34; deal. 

The restaurant was smaller than I expected, but very quaint. We arrived a little before prime lunch time, and seated ourselves at the table close to the sushi bar, but far enough to not be judged by the vast quantities of sushi we would be eating. The deal is that you can order as many sushi rolls, and maki rolls as you want, and as many times as you want, but you will have to finish all of what you order or else they will charge you extra on top of the $25/person pricing. I think $25/person is very reasonable pricing for how their &#34;all-you-can-eat&#34; sushi is set up. They give you the standard white sushi sheet that you can mark which rolls you want after conversing with your dining mates.

After we arrived to a consensus on which rolls we wanted, we decided on a meager number of 11 rolls to start our sushi binge. The rolls were made fresh right in front of our eyes and this made us very giddy and hungrier. The lunch rush started to trickle in and we knew that we would be there for a while since there was only one sushi chef behind the bar. This was okay with us because we were on vacation and had some time to kill. The wait for the sushi was not too bad. We got our first 4 rolls in about 15 minutes, and then the remaining rolls staggered in 5 minute intervals. The next round we opted for 8 rolls. Every roll was great except the seared tuna roll which had an off-putting smoky taste and gasoline smell. All together we had 19 rolls. The last two rolls were not pictured since we were more focused on finishing the food than documenting the last two rolls that we could have done without. Oh the consequences of gluttony. 

We were a bit slow getting out of our chairs, but we were very sushi happy!",31/10/13,205,4,1,4,-38,3.0105999999999997,1.6029999999999998,0.398,17.000000000000004,No,1943
abashiri-bloomingdale,Ericka A.,To0GTLW5MGZwOg5TxxZIQA,pTNAY6vcSkSxitfJOBaaMw,"I have never pounded so many sushi rolls in my life and I am a master of getting my money&#39;s worth at a buffet. Remember that episode of the Simpsons where Homer goes to The Frying Dutchman&#39;s all-you-can-eat? That was me at Abashiri, except they didn&#39;t give us the stink eye or kick us out. They just kept serving sushi with a smile.

Sushi might easily be one of my favorite styles of food, but I&#39;ve found that you either pay an arm and a leg for quality or you end up having mediocre sushi that&#39;s still more expensive than most meals. However, I&#39;ve discovered that you can have your rolls and eat them too to the tune of $24.95 per person Monday-Thursday at Abashiri. It&#39;s easily the most affordable and most delicious sushi option in the suburbs if not the entire Chicagoland area. Yea, I said it!

We were greeted in Japanese by a petite woman who was also our waitress. She was the only person working there, except for the chef, and there was only one other table when we arrived. It stayed relatively calm the entire night and only two more tables were taken by 7:30pm. It meant that we basically had the waitress to ourselves and the rolls came out at lightning fast speed. I especially liked that when we ordered 6 rolls to begin with that they brought them out to us in groups of 3s so we could begin eating instead of having to wait for all 6 to be completed.

Between the two of us we split a Red Dragon, Godzilla, Lion King, Double Salmon, Salmon Bomb, NY Steak, Super Philadelphia, Paradise, Mexican and another that isn&#39;t coming to mind. Some were better than others, but all of them were good. I especially loved the Godzilla and Mexican, but I might recommend saving the Mexican for last as it is quite spicy (by my standards) and might make it hard to fully appreciate the flavors in the other rolls. We ordered 10 rolls total and barely put a dent in the AYCE sushi list. You could easily come here at least 5 times before you have tried everything they offer.

They also have a small cocktail and alcohol menu that features sake, plum wine and mixed drinks. I almost felt as if we were robbing them with how much sushi we ate for such a small fee, so I tried to throw a few more bucks their way by ordering a Mai Tai. I believe it was just a little over $6. The only complaint I have is that it didn&#39;t have curacao and didn&#39;t have the signature taste, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a real Mai Tai. But it is really alcoholic, so I can&#39;t hate too much. Even after 10 rolls it practically knocked me on my ass.",15/06/12,273,5,2,5,17,4.698099999999999,2.423,0.657,20.92,No,2571

This is rolls-only sushi buffet which is a first for me and I was a little nervous about having a lack of options.  I do love eating nigiri, tempura,etc which the buffet option didn&#39;t offer  but abashiri&#39;s extensive and unique rolls made up for that.

There are SO many different types of rolls that it was impossible to try single out one roll that made my night but my favorites were definitely the baked scallop and baked lobster rolls.  I would suggest going with a bigger party so that you can share the rolls.

Like every other sushi I&#39;ve been to you should finish the rolls that are ordered or be prepared to pay for the leftovers. SHouldn&#39;t really be a problem though..these yummy rolls will all be in your belly by the end of the experience..no matter how full you are.",18/02/13,100,4,1,4,-1,3.2831,1.2069999999999999,0.249,5.5440000000000005,No,1003

Check out some of the specialty maki rolls at Abashiri! Sparks of yum were definitely flying as a group of 7 got together for Abashiri&#39;s AYCE sushi.  

Their AYCE menu consists of only maki and special maki rolls.  Abashiri is definitely for the folks that love creative maki and cooked maki rolls. My personal sushi taste runs along the traditional (nigiri!), but I found their maki very flavorful.  The flavors weren&#39;t just a mush of all kinds of ingredients, but seemed very well thought out and every ingredient complimented each other. 

Service was wonderful. The place is on the smaller side but even though we had a big group, service didn&#39;t suffer a bit.   My tip is that if you want AYCE, get your whole group to order AYCE.  Each of you should order 2 rolls and share away.  Still not full?  Order more rolls!  Tea and miso soup is included in the very reasonable price  ($25 bux).  I didn&#39;t know a few people in the group very well, but after some communal platters of sushi, we were all like a big sushi-loving family.",01/11/12,133,4,2,5,41,4.310099999999999,2.422,0.139,13.439,No,1128

I&#39;ve never had spicy tuna that was sweet, to the point where I cannot taste the fish flavor. That was a major disappointment to me, as spicy tuna is a staple of the majority of the sushi rolls that they offer in their AYCE menu. Their yellowtail is good and I do not have a problem with their other fish. They don&#39;t use too much rice on their rolls and there is a huge variety; however, with the AYCE option, you are limited to only rolls, not nigiri. And the rice has fallen apart as soon as I picked it up with my chopsticks, the rolls need to be constructed better structurally. Their handrolls were ok; again, we revisit the spicy tuna issue of it being sweet on top of sushi rice making it extra sweet. I would come to this place if I was trying to save some bucks for sushi, just because it&#39;s close to my house. Otherwise, I would have other options available that I would drive to further away.",23/08/15,107,3,2,3,19,2.4596,1.249,0.281,7.47,No,1019

From what I can gather, the best way to do Abashiri is the way we did it: With a group of 5 or 6 people, on a weeknight, everyone doing the All You Can Eat and sharing lots of rolls.

AYCE includes miso (great for a cold rainy night) and green tea (good but there were no sugar packets on the table ... so I just drank it as-is) and lots of rolls. I&#39;m having trouble remembering everything we ordered but I know it included:
Ninja Roll (at least 3 of these)
Hawaiian Roll
Fire Roll
Godzilla Roll
Mexican Roll
Lady Roll
Mango &amp; Tuna
Lobster Roll

... and more, I think we ordered at least 15 or 16 rolls for 5 people. It got a little crazy.

I will say that I was a bigger fan of the fresh rolls than the cooked ones -- the one deep-fried one seemed pretty odd to me -- and overall the ingredients seemed fresh and tasty and pretty well composed. We also were treated by our sashimi-eating cohort to some sake and some kind of shrimp-fish egg-quail egg bite that was surprisingly sweet and rich. 

The waitress was attentive and kept the food and tea coming, and offered advice on NOT ordering rice, because that would just fill us up and we wouldn&#39;t have room for more rolls. She did fail to ask one of the sushi-eating crew if she wanted change, but it was easily fixed.

So: come here on a quiet weeknight with several friends who want to stuff themselves silly with sushi. The end. (Thanks also to OC Candice G who organized our unofficial outing!)",14/09/12,175,4,2,2,39,1.9506999999999999,1.205,0.7849999999999999,10.011,No,1484

I&#39;m always greeted by the nice waitress here and I usually am able to sit wherever I want given the restaurant isn&#39;t crowded. The lighting is perfect and gives it a nice dinner feel. It&#39;s not extremely fancy, but definitely has your typical dinner restaurant feel to it.  On the walls are the pictures of many people who, I assume, are people who go there a lot, almost like a wall of fame. A few pictures of some famous golfers, who&#39;ve been to the restaurant have been there, are up there as well.

The all you can eat is spectacular. It&#39;s only $25 and you can get almost any kind of sushi you want! The nigiri (fish on top of rice sushi) is off limits, but who cares? FREE FOR ALL ON THE ROLLS, I TELL YOU! Miso soup also comes with the meal, but the waitress had told me only if you request it.  My friends and I go to this place very frequently, so the waitress knows us now. The waitress tends to poke fun at me and it makes me laugh every time. &#34;You better finish that, or you&#39;ll have to pay for it&#34; she&#39;ll say, every time I have only one roll left to go! 

When we&#39;re done eating, the bill is delivered immediately after we&#39;re all finished and it takes no time at all for her to run the payments. She always gives us a nice &#34;Thank you&#34; and bids us farewell until next time.

Second, upon walking in, we were immediately slammed in the face with the unmistakable smell of bad fish. Not a good first impression for a sushi restaurant.

abashiri-bloomingdale,Derrick T.,_qRV6YI3wm6hF0SF-2z8ng,XTNGniommWkxZA4zoQqFTA,"2nd time here, and the quality is still as good as 1 year ago in terms of rolls.  I still haven&#39;t tried their nigiri yet, but their abundance of interesting rolls keeps me interested and wanting to come back when I get the chance.  

For $25, it&#39;s an all you can order for rolls and hand rolls.  While there&#39;s no nigiri, the rolls are made well, plated fairly nicely, and aren&#39;t over packed with rice by any means.  They&#39;re generous with their portions and the customer service is typically spot on.

Why only three stars with such a good review?  We had REALLY slow service... we came in about 8:00, ordered up our rolls, and didn&#39;t get our first roll until 8:35 PM.  After that, it was about another 10 minutes before another two rolls, and then finally our last two rolls made an appearance after.  We quickly ordered up another set of handrolls and rolls, to ensure that the food kept coming so that we wouldn&#39;t be dragging this out until 10:00 PM.

I was curious what happened, so I inquired with the waitress why the service was so slow?  She explained that the restaurant got packed, and then a few large &#34;to go&#34; orders were made so they were busy prepping the those orders.  

My interpretation is basically that since they had a captive audience (folks who are here for all you can order rolls), they prioritized the to go orders first and then had us wait.

After all that&#39;s said and done, we didn&#39;t receive any discount or comped dessert or appetizers... while the waitress was very apologetic, I was disappointed that another gesture wasn&#39;t made (ice cream?  something?)  We had come to Abashiri hoping that we would be in and out within an hour, and instead if took almost two hours and the rest of our night was shot...

Verdict:  Listen, the food is good.  It really is.  The customer service is great, friendly waitresses who are wonderful.  If the owners are reading this, my suggestion is that in the future, if you have a table that&#39;s been waiting for a long time for their order, bring out something to tide them over... edamame, or perhaps even have the chefs prep up one-two of their rolls to bring out and explain the situation with an apology.  Feeling like our order didn&#39;t matter compare to the &#34;to go&#34; orders leaves me feeling like the red-headed step child that the family doesn&#39;t love, and ends up souring the mood of the evening.  Will I be back?  Ultimately, yes, because the rolls are pretty tasty and the variety is huge.

Baked Spicy Salmon and the Super Philly roll are some of my favorites. Which I love and makes it a distinct place for me! This place has a knack for making their rolls nice and creamy.

only issue i had was the service. it was unbelievably bad. we sat there for TWO hours  and only one roll came out at a time. we wanted to have a quick sushi dinner and continue our night but we sat there for two hours waiting to get all of our sushi. the waiters were not attentive to us at all, we waited nearly an hour for our first roll.

My stomach, and my wallet, are glad my coworkers introduced me to Abashiri!  Fantastic sushi at truly reasonable prices.

I especially enjoyed the many &#34;combos&#34; they have to offer, affordable with a bit of variety.  I tried the 290 combo (most of the combos are named after the area so you have the local names, roads, etc.).  The combos come with 3 small fried dumplings (very yummy), a small house salad (loved the house dressing...I think it was Ginger/Orange?), and 2 different kinds of sushi/rolls - mine had the Philladelphia roll and the Spicy Tuna roll.

I would give it higher marks except for the service. Yes, I read the reviews that said the service was substandard, yet I was not prepared for getting our meal served piecemeal over 25 minutes, like separate courses. What did we order you ask. Spicy Dragon and Crunchy Rainbow rolls, and 6 pieces of nigeri sushi. What?!? And it took a half hour for everything to hit the table? Yep.

So even if the sushi was excellent they lose a star for the service. And it wasn&#39;t. It was... OK.

The waiter was attentive and friendly. They have an interesting ordering system - they give you the menu and a small ordering sheet. Once you&#39;ve made your decision, you put the quantity you want against whichever menu item you want on the ordering sheet. This actually seems quite brilliant, as there is no room for misunderstood words (and with my Australian accent, I have found this to be a problem sometimes!), and it probably makes it easier for the waiters and chefs. 

We ordered two rolls (total of 11 slices) and one serve of nigiri (total of 2 pieces). Our rolls were: one tempura salmon and some vegetables on the inside (can&#39;t recall which), and fresh salmon on the outside; one California roll. Nigiri was the salmon nigiri. That was enough to fill us up! All items were delicious and seemed freshly prepared. There were only four other tables/9 other people in the restaurant, so it wasn&#39;t very noisy or busy; just a nice, relaxing, quick, nutritious and delicious meal.

And I did.

I ordered a few things based on awesome name alone - Godzilla Roll, Lion King Roll...and I LOVED them. This is the third sushi place I&#39;ve been, and it ties for the #1 spot. $25 for the AYCE, and I was more than filled. Almost everything was fantastic with the sole exception of the NY Steak Roll...which I tried for the novelty of having steak in a roll, and it was ... well, steak in a roll. Nothing terribly great about that one, but everything else, from the Double Salmon Roll, to the Paradise Roll (sweet goodness that was great), was fantastic.

This time my girlfriend and my brother joined me for a weekday all you can eat food coma inducing night of sushi. I am usually weary of the all you can eat tag put on sushi for many different reasons but this was just about as good as it gets.

The waitress was very friendly and we received a complimentary bowl of miso soup which is usually the deal and it was good. Then came the rolls. I like to start out with some of the raw ones and move onto the tempura and more spicy rolls later as to not mask some of the delicate flavors in the beginning of the meal. The usual fare of spicy tuna and Philadelphia were very good and not fishy at all. We then moved onto some more interesting ones like the crazy roll and the fire roll. Both were very good with the crazy roll being a definite order. After that the more notable rolls were the rock and roll and the tiger roll - both very good with the rock and roll being a nice light take on a regular roll.

By far the most surprising roll was the K.G. roll. At first glance it seemed a bit odd with the tomatoes and a spicy tuna roll. My girlfriend ordered it and it was the shocker of the meal. A perfect balance between very spicy tuna with fresh tomatoes and cooling avocado. The best part of it was the fact that the garnish covered up the rolls completely. It was essentially a small feast in just one roll.

A great place to go and try all you can eat sushi with a group of friends. A huge menu so there is no shortage of items for picky eaters. Take my word for it go and check this place out and order the K.G. roll - im not sure what it stands for and I don&#39;t care its just that good.",24/05/10,180,4,2,5,29,5.2147,2.9749999999999996,1.213,16.813,No,1736

I ordered the Bacon Clam with roasted garlic bchamel, mozzarella, fontina, clams, bacon, thyme, &amp; evoo.

gia-mia-wheaton-3,Joy H.,9X63Z6GZfr3rfZImi8rNiw,w_F-4SlB2MKq4V9ow0j8Tg,"Gia Mia is the contemporary Italian restaurant Wheaton has needed for years. 

The menu is fresh and exciting with twists in every dish. Pizza with pear and caramelized onion kicked up with Gorgonzola, shrimp pasta with pistachio pesto, beet farro salad, whipped burrata with sea salt and honeycomb. These are just a few neat offerings on the mostly small plate menu. It is cheese, pizza, and pasta heavy (as any decent southern Italian restaurant should be) so beware if you have food allergies. The menu states they have GF options. They have a full bar and pretty extensive wine list.

Our first visit was less than stellar service wise. They were busy and our server seemed to be having a problem with handling all her tables. I shrugged it off (and the long wait for our meal that resulted) and enjoyed the food. Our second visit was completely on point. Service, drinks, food were outstanding. Kudos to Lauren!

Favorites here are the Chef&#39;s Board with melt in your mouth San Danielle prosciutto, spicy soppressata, rosemary and fennel marinated olives, and fresh mozzarella; Sausage Fennel pizza with pistachios, and Bucatini Garlic Cream with big chunks of smoky bacon and tender morsels of chicken thigh. Try a sorbetto for a dessert.

If I would make one suggestion it would be to knock down the a/c just a bit. The blast of cold air hits the tables and my food gets cold less than 5 minutes after being served.

If you want something that tastes real and not just preservatives then come here.

Everything I said also applies to their other items. Yes, they have other freshly prepared dishes such as salads, pasta and fish. The salad I tried was amazing. For an appetizer I had the smashed potatoes. I couldn&#39;t get enough of it.

We got the pear caramelized onion pizza which is a good combination of sweet and savory together and we also got the Bucatini garlic cream pasta which was a very rich combination of flavors in the pasta. Lately, for desert we got the Panna cotta + blueberry sorbetto, which was my first time trying Panna cotta and it won&#39;t be my last. The combination with the sorbetto was a good combination of sweet and sour and the fresh blueberries in there were a great touch. 

Nice trendy place can&#39;t wait to go back!",11/06/16,89,5,2,4,18,3.8721,1.7449999999999999,0.0,6.255,No,801

The seating in the restaurant is pretty tight which was a bit bothersome but the tasty food certainly made up for it. 

We ordered a few apps and shared a pizza. We got the zucchini , cauliflower and potato appetizers. (See posted pics) The potato was my favorite but they were all delicious and I was fond of the presentation (prior to us devouring half of it as shown in pics.) How is it that food always tastes better when it looks good? We split a Margarita pizza with meatballs and some whipped ricotta. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the cheese and I found the pizza lacked flavor. I added some olive oil swirled on top and that did make it taste better. The service was good and the bathrooms were clean and fancy stocked with a mini space heater as well.

We found a seat at the bar and were greeted immediately by the very friendly bartender. He was so charming and personable! He totally made our experience. I wish I could remember his name. We shared a huge salad and pizza and a great red blend. My only complaint would be that my pizza was a tad charred for my liking.... I can understand though that this is par for course for a woodfired place.

The service was reallllllly unfortunate. Total missed opportunity. The waitress was neither friendly nor welcoming, and even when we ASKED for a recommendation, she did not provide one. It was our first time at the restaurant and we weren&#39;t provided any bit of info on the menu or the restaurant in general. When it came to picking a pizza, we asked the waitress for a suggestion and she said something to the extent of &#34;it&#39;s all about the dough and how it&#39;s cooked, so just pick any pizza with toppings you like and you&#39;ll like it.&#34; Is it that hard to just suggest one? She also checked on us so frequently it was obvious she wanted to hurry us out the door, even though there wasn&#39;t a line of people waiting. Clearly, this mostly killed the whole experience.

Food:
The burrata pizza - SO GOOD. Get it.
Some pesto cavatappi pasta, veal meatballs, and the pea small plate were all fine at best. 

Also, the food comes out REALLLLLLLY FAST, which while that normally is good, it made us want to order slower so we actually had time to enjoy the food and enjoy each other&#39;s company...and the waitress just wasn&#39;t having it.

Also, the dessert menu was a total let down. 4/7 items were some combination of sorbet/gelato, and the others just weren&#39;t enticing enough, so we passed on that.

I will return, but I really hope to get a server that cares and makes the experience much better! I also will probably only order pizza.",02/10/15,187,3,1,4,5,3.9097,2.887,1.635,13.479,No,1671

I wanted to go out for &#39;date night&#39; and I remember getting a menu from Gia Mia at the Wheaton Wine fest. What sold me is that they have far more options than just pizza. They also have &#34;Italian tapas&#34; so we decided to give it a try. 

-Cauliflower-- I&#39;ve actually always hated cauliflower, but my favorite menu item at Girl and the Goat is the cauliflower. I wanted to try it here also because it had toasted pine nuts and breadcrumbs. It&#39;s so delicious. I could have ordered another one just so I didn&#39;t have to share.
-Butternut squash tortellini--this was stuffed with gorgonzola, which we didn&#39;t notice on the menu. I despise the taste of gorgonzola so I only had a few bites of it. My husband who does like gorgonzola loved these.
-Veal meatballs with polenta--my favorite thing we tried. Their homemade sauce is so chunky and delicious. They also offer a veal meatball pizza, which we considered ordering because we loved this so much, but we ran out of stomach room
-Shrimp on toast--the sauce was delicious on this. I think I ended up eating most of it

Gia Mia also offers Happy Hour during the week where you can buy one pizza and get another at 1/2 price. I didn&#39;t get a chance to sample the pizza, but I think it&#39;d be a great idea to stop by for HH with some friends.

Thanks to the staff at Gia Mia for a great night out!",04/12/15,161,5,2,5,36,6.1784,5.159999999999999,1.037,13.801999999999998,No,1489
gia-mia-wheaton-3,Chris M.,MefoECvLhWp-XHqv5S2DNw,Bhh4HQB87zNhosva4G9MWw,"Dinner with my wife at 4:00 on Saturday when it was cold and raining before Chicago Blackhawks game 7 of the NHL Western Conference Finals.  We were greeted by 2 friendly and welcoming hostess.  She offered us a table by the window, but we decided to sit further into the restaurant, where the layout and decor is very city-like and modern.  Very visually open where the bar and tables flow very well.  A large screen TV behind the bar too.

&#34;The concept is chef-driven, farm-to-table food concepts such as Neapolitan style wood-fired pizzas, creative small plates, fresh homemade pasta, antipasto, and hand-made mozzarella to name a few.  Their mixology bar concept will include offering specialty craft beers as well as an exclusive wine list with flavors carefully chosen to complement their delectable food plates.&#34; 

After looking through the wine list we asked our waitress, Lauren if she had Red Wine suggestions?  We let her know we dine frequently at &#34;Fire + Wine&#34; and that we always go with a bottle of &#34;If You See Kay&#34;  She told us she would ask their &#34;Sommelier&#34; or wine steward.  We both thought that was really nice of Gia Mia to have.  It just adds a robust level of attention to their wine list.  We ordered a glass of Mastroberadino &#34;Mastro&#34; Aglianico and a glass of Angels &amp; Cowboys.  The first was very smooth and the 2nd was more of a Red Zinfandel strength.

To eat we shared the small plate on special &#34;Crispy Eggplant&#34; with pasta and tomato sauce.  Very impressed with how amazing this tasted.  After that we had the &#34;Hammaker&#39;s Pie&#34; pizza and we especially liked how crispy the pepperoni was and how delicious the mushrooms were.  The brick oven has a temperature between 800 -1000 degrees F.  

We skipped dessert for next time and looking forward to when Lauren, the owner, and the team at Gia Mia serve us again.  They all did a great job helping us feel comfortable during our stay...asking us how our meal and stay were going.  We wish them great success in downtown Wheaton.

Gia Mia is a &#34;creative and eclectic&#34; place where a couple can enjoy some good food and wine, but also a kid-friendly, family-friendly environment.",01/06/15,251,5,2,5,28,7.472499999999998,4.25,0.343,15.407000000000002,No,2224
gia-mia-wheaton-3,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,AHIO8uBfZpX1_r6OVbEABA,"Fire and Wine comes to Wheaton. Really, it&#39;s pretty much the Fire and Wine food and experience, packaged in a more modern setting.

Speaking of the setting, it&#39;s really loud in the front of the house. The back had fewer tables and was a little quieter, but otherwise you can forget about holding a conversation if you&#39;re coming here with a group.

We started things off with roasted cauliflower, which was covered in olive oil, sprinkled with pine nuts and came with very fresh green and kalamata olives. The ingredients were very fresh, and the flavor combination was quite good.

Our pizza bread came at the same time. This is their pizza crust adorned with only three additional ingredients; sprigs of rosemary, sea salt, and olive oil. I thought this was a bit too salty, but I definitely also thought that the quality of the dough meant good things were coming up.

Our pizzas came next. I had a bite of my wife&#39;s quatro formaggio, and again wondered at how top quality pizza places can somehow make a tomato jelly for their pizzas that tastes amazing. The mozzarella was excellent as well.

I have a standing rule to order seafood at new restaurants, which meant I ordered the bacon and clam pizza. Bit of a stretch, sure, but this adventure had its rewards: the clams tasted fresh, the pizza tasted fantastic, the saltiness of the bacon combined differently from the saltiness of the clams, and I really liked the garlic sauce that was laid out with the thyme in the pizza in lieu of tomato sauce/jelly. I would absolutely get this pizza again.

Fire and Wine is usually packed to the brim on any given night, and I expect Gia Mia to be the same way (it was already a 30 minute wait for a Saturday lunch, which was impressive.) If they decide to put up some fabric on the walls or rugs on the floors, maybe we&#39;ll all be able to talk about how food the good is while we&#39;re there, too.",31/05/15,214,5,2,4,38,3.6197,2.162,0.748,14.091,No,1914

We came in around 8ish on a Saturday night, this also was a night of the Cubs Playoff game so they weren&#39;t packed to capacity which was nice... it&#39;s sometimes hard to find a spot to enjoy dinner when you don&#39;t care to watch the game.  We were seated immediately.

My friend and I shared the mozzarella flight - which was pretty awesome, and this cheese lover was ALL OVER that!!! We decided to share two pizzas which we were told took 3 minutes to cook.  We decided for a white kind of pizza that had artichoke on it, and one red...I think we just got the margarita pizza, but both were REALLY good!

We called ahead and found out they don&#39;t do reservations but they do something else, which is call ahead seating.  It prioritizes you over walkins but you still have to wait.  It&#39;s basically the same thing as a reservation because I&#39;ve been to plenty of restaurants where I had a reservation and still had to wait 45 minutes.  This way they are more up front about it, and once you check in, you can leave your number and they will call you.  So you can take a stroll around downtown Wheaton while you wait.  Also, if they call you and your party is not there, they won&#39;t seat you.  This worked out for us because the group ahead of us wasn&#39;t all there, so we only had about a 10 minute wait.  Score!
The atmosphere is pretty loud and casual, yet exudes a bit of a fine dining appeal.  But overall it&#39;s a nice spot to get some good food.  Kids are welcome, but the aisles between tables are tight.  I was backed right into the hostess stand but they graciously moved anytime I needed to get up.
I believe they call themselves farm to fork, and the food tasted great.  We had a few tapas to start off.  The potatoes were excellent, and so were the cauliflower.  We also had fried zucchini which was alright... I probably wouldn&#39;t order them again, cause they aren&#39;t that special.  We had the pomodoro pizza.  It was ok.  It was lacking some flavor.

Service was excellent and knowledgeable about the menu. Originally we went in to have a tradition meal of two plates but started ordering off the small plates section and was hooked.  There is also a large selection of adult beverages as well as mixed drinks.

Started with broiled oysters and bacon...three oysters. To an order so keep in mind that these are tapas style plates.  They were delicious but the bacon was the main flavor in this plate.  Smashed potatoes are a garlicky hit with a little hot pepper heat and a sauce you can eat by the spoonful.  Get the potatoes.

Gourmet pizzas and some pasta dishes are on the menu and looked very creative.  Definitely will have to try them.  My wife and I enjoy the small plate approach ... Fill up the table with a variety of things to share.  That is what we did on our visit to Gia Mia.

It was hard to pick a favorite, so I won&#39;t ;).  Each dish shows creativity in taste and texture combination...chef shows imagination and nails it.  I could eat their quinoa every day.  The roasted cauliflower dish was unique and executed perfectly (loved the black olives in there!).  Veal meatballs were tender and the sauce was very good. I loved the dates in the kale salad...and I&#39;m not a date guy.  Overall I really enjoyed the mix of flavors with every dish.  Quite unique...definitely for Wheaton.

So...atmosphere.  Definitely seemed to try for a urban feel with some minimal modern influence, but didn&#39;t quite hit it (not to say some tweaking wouldn&#39;t take them there).  Front area almost had a Chipotle feel (to me).  I would consider a different color paint, turn down the lights a touch, 2 or 3 less tables.  Back area is better though.

Portions are a bit bigger than you might expect, so don&#39;t order too many &#34;small&#34; dishes.  The style of the food, the decor of the interior is quintessential Italian.  The food is tasty, mostly low fat, and healthy.  TO THE OWNERS:  I would suggest you consider changing the name a bit, like to Gia Mia Tapas bar.  The &#34;pizza&#34; in your name conjurs a completely different idea...the idea of just one more of the too numerous pizza places all over Chicagoland.  Your name denotes a sense of &#34;me too&#34;...I think you would get a more accurate message out if you replace &#34;pizza&#34; with &#34;tapas&#34;.  Keep the menu the same, just change the name.

Don&#39;t make us stand in the entryway-waiting for 15 minutes-while there were only 5 other tables occupied in the entire restaurant. After being seated and we order drinks the waitress asks us if we were aware that since it was Valentine&#39;s Day-there was a 1.5 hour limit to the table. No- we were NOT aware and had that been mentioned we definitely would have taken our business elsewhere. The waitress said since we were not informed of the time limit we &#34;should&#34; be ok to stay. After we hit the two hour mark the waitress asked if there would be anything else- we asked if we needed to give up the table or were we fine to stay. She said she would ASK if it was ok for us to stay. I&#39;m sorry, but when you have a large party spending well over $400.00 on small plates-I would think you would let us be. Mind you...the restaurant was NOT full and no one was waiting to be seated.

We ordered the Tuscan bean dip and charred cauliflower as starters. OMG! They were both utterly amazing! Bean dip came in a little jar with plain pizza crust t spread it on. The crust was thin, crispy,chewy and great with the dip. The charred cauliflower was heaven in veggie form. There was some grilled radicchio and pine nuts and some honey that made it all taste amazing. It was our fave item that night.we ordered three pizzas, the veal meatball,burrata and arugula ,and wild mushroom.  They were all really good.

Located next to an Aldi and a Chinese Buffet, this place is a small little eatery in a strip mall. 

Their claim to fame is their teriyaki sauce which I found to be tasty. I got the:

Chicken Teriyaki: (8.99) Chicken was juicy, it comes with salad and rice. It was sweet and salty and tangy. The salad had some sort of sweet creamy dressing which I like and the rice was a shorter grain than most Asian take out places which was a nice touch. 

What really stands out about this place is the HUGE portion. (See Picture), I got like half a chicken&#39;s worth of meat and a pound of rice. It all comes on a gigantic plate.

They also have extra teriyaki sauce bottles everywhere just in case you wanted more.  

Overall I would say if you&#39;re a teriyaki lover, this is the spot for you. I&#39;m pretty indifferent about it but I do recognize good quality and clean service which this place certainly does have. 

Keep in mind the food takes some time to come out because its cooked to order. 

Will definitely return.",15/04/13,136,4,2,5,29,5.543100000000001,3.438,0.274,12.288,No,1204

The spicy pork was more sweet than spicy, and I liked the portions to this because I was full after half. There was a slight smokiness to it too, which I enjoyed, but it was too weak for me in spiciness. However, my tolerance for spicy foods is higher than average so.. haha.

Fast, efficient service. I had called in my order 30 minutes ahead. Google&#39;s navi directed me over to this pizza place on the other side of the street (-.-); thankfully a yelper posted tips on how to get there correctly hehe.

I had a pounding hunger headache and I needed to hit the auto parts stores over in this area to look for some parts. Yelp reviews told me about how this place had fantastic homemade teriyaki sauce. As a longtime Japanese food fan, I&#39;m usually not the biggest fan of teriyaki -- mainly because a lot of people get lazy with it and just use store-bought sauce. If you&#39;re going to do it in a restaurant, make it your own. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too much to ask. 

This place does. Also, as soon as you walk in, you see that they have two things on every table: a bottle of their homemade teriyaki sauce (so you don&#39;t have to ask for extra if you eat in), and a bottle of Sriracha. (Proper Sriracha -- no Lee Kum Kee bootleg cocksauce here!) 

Lunch special is great. You get a little salad with a nice homemade creamy dressing, fluffy rice (white rice is included, but you can substitute fried for an additional charge), and your meat of choice. I had chicken. I&#39;ll upload photos in a moment. 

Drinks selection is your typical fountain stuff augmented by a cooler full of iced tea/energy drinks/Vitamin Water/Sobe. I wish they offered hot tea, but that&#39;s a minor quibble. 

Their homemade teriyaki sauce is great. Add Sriracha to the fluffy white rice and contrast the layered spiciness with the sweet/salty teriyaki and have a very happy party. In your mouth. I heard what I said. 

They also offer free samples if you&#39;re not sure. Stop in and give it a try. I want to try the spicy pork next time. :9",12/03/13,203,4,1,4,4,3.1796000000000006,2.825,0.8520000000000001,21.323,No,1730

joy-teriyaki-glendale-heights,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,qQxIoH8wASzEGeUFHareXQ,"Joy Terayaki is a small hole in the wall of a Japanese food joint located right off of Army Trail Road in Glendale Heights. I&#39;ve driven by many times and noticed it out of the corner of my eye, however I&#39;ve never been motivated to stop in and try it until today. 

Having seen some raves reviews here on Yelp and some good buzz around my office from co-workers I decided to try a few things on the menu. I ordered a spicy chicken teriyaki meal, an order of fried rice and a five piece side order of gyoza.

First off let&#39;s touch on the chicken teriyaki. The foam container had the chicken and some sauce in two pockets and a main pocket of white rice. The chicken itself was well grilled while still retaining a tender texture and the sauce was a very nice compliment. The overall taste was excellent and the portion size was very reasonable for the money. The white rice included was just regular white rice so there&#39;s not much to note there. 

The gyoza&#39;s included were pretty good as well but a little on the small side. For those unfamiliar with gyoza, it&#39;s a variation on the pot sticker. These seemed to include a seasoned white meat of some type (possibly pork). These were nice as an appetizer but I&#39;ve had better.

Finally to comment on the fried rice. The fried rice I had was pretty good there were chopped up vegatables and a lot of egg mixed in. I liked the overall taste though I would probably not order it as a standalone side again, but would instead upgrade the white rice bundled with the entree to the fried rice if possible. 

Overall I liked my food and will definitely be coming again. I&#39;ll give this place five stars for being great food at a great value.",17/10/12,190,5,3,5,78,5.617999999999999,2.847,0.153,15.000000000000002,No,1711

The chicken teriyaki plate was good, and he enjoyed the chicken katsu plate.  The salad came out from the kitchen with a delicious dressing on it.  We decided to try the variety of sauces they had bottled near the kitchen.  We identified one of the bottled sauces as the salad dressing and I added some more to my salad.  WHOA, bad idea!  It&#39;s apparently a dairy-based sauce and is NOT good after it&#39;s been sitting out and fermenting.  Gross.  Please, PLEASE Joy Teriyaki - refrigerate your dairy-based sauces so they don&#39;t sit out and get rank.  That&#39;s a tummy issue waiting to happen!  I ended up having some tummy gurgles afterward. :(

Food - Wonderful.  The best teriyaki place I&#39;ve ever eaten.  Their spicy chicken teriyaki makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside its so good.  The perfect blend of sweet and spice.

Service - Sub par.  The latest complaint comes from my experience at lunch this afternoon.  I called an order in as I typically do at noon.  The woman on the phone struggled to comprehend what I was telling her and didn&#39;t understand my name even after providing it to her a 3rd time.  Once the order was placed I was told 15-20 mins for pickup, which pleased me since I work 15 mins away from their location.  Upon arrival at 12:15-12:20 the food was not ready so a coworker and myself paid at the register and found a seat to wait for our order.  12:30 rolls around and still nothing.  12:40, still waiting.... 12:55 was the final straw.  I went back up to the counter and kindly asked what was the reason for the delay.  You could tell by the shocked look in her eye that our order had either been given to someone else or forgotten, keep in mind several other people that came in after us who had not called in orders had already gotten their food and almost finished.  1:00 and our food was finally up!  Thinking they might offer us a discount or a credit on our next meal I was immediately overwhelmed with disappointment when she placed an order of egg rolls in front of us as compensation for the inconvenience.  Some of you are saying to yourself, &#34;I don&#39;t know, that seems fair.&#34;  If you have ever had the egg rolls from Joy Teriyaki you would have been just as disappointed as we were, especially after this last price increase cost us 15.00 an order for a plate of fried rice, chicken, salad, and a fountain drink.

To sum all of this up.  Joy Teriyaki has always been a favorite but I will no longer continue to give them my business given the current prices.  There is a great chinese restaurant in Glendale Hts off of North Ave called China Chef where the food quality is just as good if not better and the portions are larger for half the price, its not the same food but similar cuisine.  If you have had a similar story or are just fed up with prices like myself please join me in boycotting this establishment.",01/08/14,272,2,2,4,44,3.0341000000000005,3.2750000000000004,2.0149999999999997,19.709999999999994,No,2557

I love the hole-in-the-wall feel of the place.

Their teriyaki is very good, I love that there&#39;s a bottle at every table and also several other bottles of various sauces available for your dish. 

I&#39;m glad they don&#39;t have too many choices, because I would never be able to make up my mind. But one day, I decided on the simple chicken teriyaki and I was very surprised at the portion I got...HUGE! When I was paying, I was thinking it was a little pricey but I then saw the amount of food I payed for and it made it that much better.

I had the 7.99 teriyaki chicken lunch special. Came with a big portion of chicken, white rice and a side salad with what i want to call a sesame, rice vinegar dressing. Not a fan of vinagrette dressings but this one was really good. The chicken was tender but had a nice carmelized char from the sauce, the sauce itself was amazing. Each table had a bottle of teriyaki sauce and a bottle of sriracha, two very essential things to me when i eat teriyaki, so you have controll over the heat or sweetness. 

The portion size is pretty big for the price..i ended up boxing up almost half of it because i got full. One negative thing is they take a bit of time to get your order out, my lunch break is an hour long, it took me 15 minutes to get there around 15 minutes for my food to come out, 15 minutes to eat and 15 to get back. This being my first time it really isnt a big deal, next time ill call ahead, as i suggest anyone on a time frame to do so.

The chicken teriyaki plate was good, and he enjoyed the chicken katsu plate.  The salad came out from the kitchen with a delicious dressing on it.  We decided to try the variety of sauces they had bottled near the kitchen.  We identified one of the bottled sauces as the salad dressing and I added some more to my salad.  WHOA, bad idea!  It&#39;s apparently a dairy-based sauce and is NOT good after it&#39;s been sitting out and fermenting.  Gross.  Please, PLEASE Joy Teriyaki - refrigerate your dairy-based sauces so they don&#39;t sit out and get rank.  That&#39;s a tummy issue waiting to happen!  I ended up having some tummy gurgles afterward. :( 

Aside from the foul-taste of the Sitting Out Sauce, the rest of the dining experience was good.  Joy Teriyaki was a no-frills place with fair-priced lunch specials.

Food - Wonderful.  The best teriyaki place I&#39;ve ever eaten.  Their spicy chicken teriyaki makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside its so good.  The perfect blend of sweet and spice.

Service - Sub par.  The latest complaint comes from my experience at lunch this afternoon.  I called an order in as I typically do at noon.

&#34; yup, call in a spicy for me &#34; 
It&#39;s about the best lunch around and since I&#39;ve been there often, I can say it&#39;s consistently good. 
The &#34;call in&#34; part is key, as it appears all orders are made on the spot and not just scooped out of some vat in back . At lunch time, the wait can burn up a lot of your git ta&#39; et&#39;n time, also the place fills up quick. I&#39;m unfortunately creature of habit, so the chicken Teriyaki lunch deal is my thing- but I have dabbled in the spicy. And it&#39;s spicy spicy. Not OMG spicy, but just enough heat to remind you what you got with every bite. 
If you are dining in, lunch is served on a china plate, or a foam box if you get it to go. Bottles of teriyaki and Sriracha  are on the tables and real silverware is available. Unless you are one of those fancy know it all metro scooter riding types, then chopsticks are available to fumble with before grabbing a damn fork and eating like the rest of us. 
Not that I&#39;ve ever done that. 
Ok it was me.

This place should be called Happy Happy Joy Joy Teriyaki.  Located in the weirdly unholy Bermuda Triangle of good Asian food near Army Trail and Bloomingdale Road which has Pho Ha, Hong Ning and Joy Teriyaki within a 1 mile radius of each other,  this place managed to break a couple of my resolutions, nay three of them, thus keeping with the tri-themed review. 

First of all, as with 80% of the country, I resolved to eat healthier in 2013.  Less red meat, namely pork, which is the best meat in the galaxy.  I also resolved to exercise more in what free time I have, and to eat less, as in, eat until satiated.  Not, &#34;Eat until food bypasses digestion phase and escapes oral-gastric tract by means of nostrils.&#34;  Yes, eating until food comes out the nose is NOT the plan.   
So how did I come to squash these resolutions?  A fateful Friday where I dropped the wife off to visit a friend, and I was to kill a couple of hours in whatever way I imagined.  Go to the gym?  I could have, but I didn&#39;t bring my bag.  I suppose that couldn&#39;t stop me from finding a trail, or even a sidewalk to just walk off a few calories.  But no. I contemplated going to the Avalanche to have a drink and catch the Bulls game, but I thought I might get thrashed if I walked in there with tall Hunters on my feet.  SO, I went to Half Price, picked up a stack of 50 cent Cook&#39;s Illustrated issues and read some in the car while waiting for the call to pick up the wife.  When the approximate time came, and the call didn&#39;t come through, the hunger buzzer in my belly alarmed.  

Deciding on Joy Teriyaki out of the three restaurants named above, I opted for the Spicy Pork and Chicken Breast Plate.  It took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready, but good things come to those who wait. Time food was ready - 08:11pm.  Time wife called for car service - 08:13pm.  Went to retrieve her and ended up going to Target before heading home.  Ate salad portion of meal while walking around Target.  Home at 10:20pm.  Watched Netflix while eating my delicious Spicy Pork and Chicken.  From what I remembered, the pork was tender, with minimal fat.  And it was my favorite cut of pork - SHOULDER.  The Crash Test Dummies comes to mind.  Mmm mmm mmm mmm.   Wasn&#39;t too spicy, but it tasted great and the chicken was also very clean tasting.  The rice, I could have used more of it, but it was cooked well.  The best part of it all?  The teriyaki.  Holy shabazz.  Talk about unctuous in a good way, this stuff had mouth-feel galore.  I mixed a little sriracha into mine and fell asleep while eating.  Kind of sad, no?  I woke up rip-roaring full, and sad, because I had to admit defeat and put it away in the fridge until the next morning.  

2 days later, I&#39;m still saving it in order to prolong the joy.",13/01/13,357,4,1,5,-18,5.741199999999999,4.7299999999999995,3.0309999999999997,30.240000000000002,No,2897

I thought at first the prices were a little high, but then after getting the food I was just like, WHOA! I ordered the beef and they seriously give you about two handfuls of beef. It wasn&#39;t like amazingly  tasting beef teriyaki but it wasn&#39;t horrible either.

You can see the kitchen area and it looks clean and organized which is the most important. They make their own teriyaki sauce and its very good.  I did see an small sign that said they were going to raise the prices on the menu in January 2013, I was bummed but if its only a buck or two, its still a great deal.  Overall good food!

After eating at Joy Teriyaki you will feel fat and you will feel full. 

You definitely get what you pay for here...in food and in flavor, especially for a &#34;fast food&#34; type of joint. I always go for their specialty, the chicken teriyaki. The chicken is always tender and you probably get about 10 ounces worth. I opt to either split the dish with someone, or else I find myself with lunch for the next day.

Yays: 
- Massive portions. When I say massive, 2 people could easily share a dish.
- Killer teriyaki sauce. And bottle of it at each table.
- Love the fried rice &amp; veggie egg rolls. And the gyoza.
- Spicy pork. It has just the right kick. 
- Salad comes with every plate. I suppose that&#39;s their effort to make you feel like you&#39;re eating somewhat healthy.

Nays:
- Service blows. It&#39;s not fast, and it&#39;s not friendly.

Food:

Portions were very generous and MSG FREE! I was very full and probably should have taken leftovers home, but it was too good to refrigerate. They literally give you a gigantic plate for dine in lol. It was my first visit and I had a mixed combo of Chicken Breast and Chicken Teriyaki. The dish came with Fried Rice and Salad. The chicken was hot, fresh, and so god damn TENDER.... It was complemented perfectly by their homemade Teriyaki sauce. The sauce wasn&#39;t too sweet either which is a problem most Teriyaki dishes have. Not too strong either... Just right and they hand you a whole bottle for dine in! The Fried Rice and White Rice deserve a special mention as well. They don&#39;t use the typical bulk cheap rice. They use legit Japanese rice that is more pricey and has that hearty texture. You can taste the freshness of the steamed vegetables in the Fried Rice. The Rice and Teriyaki go so well hand in hand! The Salad is okay. It&#39;s just there. It&#39;s not bad. I am definitely coming back for the food!

Service:

Nice Counter lady. Food came out under 7 minutes when I came in while it had a decent amount of people in which was nice. Can&#39;t really say much else, it&#39;s a Walk in food place. The lady gave me good directions to find the place as well. 

Atmosphere:

Hole in the wall place. Not going to lie, the place is kind of depressing. It looks like it hasn&#39;t been renovated since the 80&#39;s. The walls literally have 80&#39;s convenience store wallpaper that is peeling off. You get used to it fast, but I would not take any girls on dates here. Good for groups of hungry college students for sure lol. It&#39;s also kind of hard to spot. It&#39;s located in the Walter E. Smite parking lot area and right next to Subway.

Surprise, it&#39;s actually the crack-like teriyaki sauce at Joy Teriyaki that defines modern addiction. (full disclosure: i do not know what crack is like).

I really wish I were kidding about this, but I&#39;ve been to this restaurant nearly three times weekly for the last six months. It is a running standard for my office, friends from the city, nearly anyone if they are hungry and within twenty miles of this location. The service is pleasant, the menu diverse (even though I always order the same damn thing), and they don&#39;t mind if you use an entire bottle of sauce, which my boss and I are prone to doing.

The food... After comparing it to drugs and addiction earlier in the review, it&#39;s hard to go up from there, but put simply, it&#39;s massive, massive portions, cooked perfectly, with a boatload of sauces and seasonings to tickle any palette. The store is not really all that much to look at, but if you&#39;re looking at anything other than the food, something is horribly wrong with your brain and it needs a checkup.

If you&#39;re remotely close to Glendale Heights, for any reason, this should be a top priority to visit. Drugs are bad. Joy Teriyaki is good.

PRO TIPZ:
* Call ahead. The wait isn&#39;t bad, but since they make everything fresh, if you let them know when you&#39;ll arrive for dine-in it can shrink the delay between you and your saucedrugs.
* The salad is fine, but I recommend opting for extra rice instead.
* If there&#39;s a big group, the quality does start to suffer as their small kitchen fights to keep ahead of the orders.
* There&#39;s nothing wrong with the standard Chicken Teriyaki, but I prefer the Chicken Breast, which is cents more and all white meat.
* Seriously, about the whole addiction thing. I&#39;ve had people tell me, after one visit, that they&#39;ve been craving Joy months after the fact. There is something really really unusually amazingly addictive about this place.",25/06/12,240,5,1,3,10,2.6596999999999995,2.4410000000000003,1.543,15.016000000000002,No,2092

Then the taxi service that you reserved to get to your friend&#39;s place fell through, so you bribe the hotel to have their shuttle service to take you just a couple miles outside their 5 mile radius.  You have to listen to the guy complain the entire way, but you finally arrive to your smiling friends to ring in the New Year!  

At 4 AM your taxi service fails again!  Luckily, you have fantabulous friends who are sober and drop you at your hotel on their way home!  You have a late check out of 2PM... You make it out of there by 1:30 and you&#39;re exhausted!  There is nothing open on New Years Day except fast food places, but you don&#39;t pass any on your way!  Then you randomly see this diner!  It&#39;s 15 minutes until they close at 2PM and they&#39;re totally fine with you coming in and messing up their totally clean floors and grill for breakfast to feed your New Year&#39;s empty belly!  Yea, that was how we met Bella!

Needless to say, we were already happy to get in outta the snow!  Our server was so sweet and she sang as she worked!  We were the only ones in the place, so we were in and out in about 30 minutes!  Fine with us cuz we were starving!

The boy had the Hungry Man&#39;s (or some other similarly named meal).  He had a couple of eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast.  He&#39;s a growing boy and there wasn&#39;t one thing on his plate that he didn&#39;t love!  I think his favorite was the hash browns!

I ordered the country fried steak special.  It came with a couple of eggs, hash browns, and biscuits.  What a special!  The breading on the steak was light and well seasoned.  It&#39;s not often you get that perfect steak with a good breading!  I loved it!  I would say it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve ever had!  And I judge places on their gravy... This gravy was tops! The hash browns were the perfect blend of some crispy and soft potatoes.  Everything was so good I wanted to devour it all!

This place was delicious!  My boyfriend and I woke up and we were feeling lazy and decided to go to Bella&#39;s Short Stack for a late Sunday Breakfast (it was a lazy Sunday...we had to sleep in first!).  There was a bit of a wait when we arrived, but since it was just us two they were able to sneak us into seats that just opened at the bar (do you even call it that in a breakfast place?!).  It was a nice change of pace.

This place had super friendly and attentive service.  It was also super clean.  I loved the retro decor with the vintage toasters.

I ordered one of the daily specials... a bacon and avocado omelet... and here is the awesome part since it is Autumn you could get pumpkin pancakes instead of regular ones.  These was amazing.

First, like others have said, it&#39;s much larger inside than it would appear from the street. I love the bar area that they have, and was impressed by the number of seats there.

I got the breakfast burrito, which was disappointingly bland. The hashbrowns were good, but my burrito didn&#39;t have a ton of flavor. I was hoping the home made salsa would help, but I found that kind of disappointing too. It wasn&#39;t really salsa as much as it was diced salsa ingredients without any moisture. And I didn&#39;t care for the salsa OR sour cream option, when the menu says &#34;and.&#34;

Again, no flavor except for the sprinkle of RAW jalepeno slices/chuncks mixed in.  I love spicy food, but raw jalepeno is not good.

We have regular breakfast dates and are always looking for something new/special.  We picked Bella&#39;s based off of reviews here on yelp and it truly lived up to the good reviews.

The restaurant is much roomier than it looks from outside, but still has a cozy, old-fashioned feel with diner-style counter seating as well as regular tables.

We had two of the day&#39;s specials - a meat lover&#39;s omelet and a Bacon PepperJack omelet.  Both meals came with the option of breakfast potatoes or fries AND toast or pancakes.  Wow.  We opted instead for a cup of fruit on the side.

The eggs were perfectly cooked and the sliced avocado on top of my omelet was the freshest and prettiest I&#39;ve ever seen!  Bacon was cooked perfectly and the fruit (melons, strawberries and pineapple) were fresh and sweet.

As someone else mentioned, the coffee is fantastic.  It was smooth, mellow and definitely didn&#39;t have those &#34;sitting in the pot for an hour&#34; overtones that you often get from other restaurants.

The waitress was friendly and efficient and the overall vibe of Bella&#39;s was clean, charming and inviting.  Definitely making this place a regular stop!",16/08/12,133,5,2,5,43,5.5016,3.463,0.239,10.298,No,1223

I guess &#34;cozy&#34; would be a good word to describe the ambiance if you don&#39;t mind having to crab walk between all the tables to get to your seat. Upon being seated, I could almost hear myself decide on what to order but it was a struggle to do so over everyone else&#39;s conversations three feet away. Now, I get it. More tables mean more business, thus making more money, but when your staff constantly bumps into themselves (and my wife&#39;s elbow) it&#39;s time to reevaluate the feng shui. As for the food, it was almost decent enough to prevent me from writing this review...almost. The omelette wasn&#39;t bad. The pancakes were, well, pancakes and the small handful of hash browns they threw in rounded out the meal. If this place were a 24 hr diner, I wouldn&#39;t be the least bit surprised, but it&#39;s a breakfast/brunch restaurant that reminds me of the place Roseanne Barr worked at on her show in the early 90&#39;s. The price was the only thing that made me smile. Two meals and hot coffee flavored water for $20 ain&#39;t bad.

Antonio Ristorante makes some great food. My family comes here quite often - and raves about it to me over the phone - so I made a point to do dinner here while I was in town.

We used to frequent this location years ago when it was still owned by Sergio, and whoever took it over is putting it to good use. The food was phenomenal from start to finish.

A basket of fresh bread plopped down shortly after us, and it had some nice Italian bread and delicious focaccia; that focaccia in olive oil -- YUM.

For drinks, we had a lemondrop martini, Chianti, and gin. Entrees were the Pizza Hawaii, Tilapia Ai Carciofi, and a special: Rolled Flank Steak. AWESOME food.

I feel confident leaving 5 stars knowing my family has dined here many times and never been disappointed, with the exception of one time (they were short-staffed and the meal took 3 hours end-to-end). To put it into perspective, that&#39;s roughly 1/30 visits. It would be bad if that was someone&#39;s first time there (because it would probably be their last), but it looks like it was just a fluke.

I would love to airlift Antonio&#39;s to my new home. I&#39;ll definitely be paying them a visit when I&#39;m back in town!",18/09/16,147,5,1,5,-28,4.9639999999999995,2.67,0.076,11.254,No,1206

It was a beautiful night to sit outside and Frank and Dave were setting up to play. That is when things started going downhill. The busboy brought us bread. Waited half hour to no avail, asked for a waiter, after about 40 minutes, a waiter took our order, brought our drinks out relatively quickly. Our appetizers took about 30 minutes which was then followed by about an hour wait for dinner. The food was subpar, fried calamari undercooked and a very small portion for $15. The Chicken Milanese was bland and served with romaine lettuce not arugula. When we ordered a second bottle of wine , they were out of the original brand so the waiter brought us a different pinio at the same price. Of course we were overcharged .
When I told the hostess about the discrepancy, she said &#34;what you want, free food ?&#34; No, just merely pointing out another mistake, one of many that happened throughout our evening, not enough silverware, wrong soup, check amount.....On and on. The tables around us were all complaining as well. Other then the ambiance and outdoor patio, thus 2 stars, I would never recommend this place.

The pizza was all right; nothing stood out or disappointed me as far as taste goes. The pasta, on the other hand, was interesting. I&#39;ve had black pasta before, but this was literally a TON of black squid ink dumped on linguine and its accompanying seafood. In fact, it was so astonishingly black, my first thought was, &#34;This is the most metal meal I have ever seen in my life,&#34; (then again, our waiter seemed pretty hardcore himself with his skull tie clip, but I digress). Anyway, the sauce was loaded with salt, which is a shame since the pasta was cooked well and the seafood was good.

The lights were turned low setting a great ambiance. The menu was great. All classic Italian dishes with some very enticing, authentic to this place, items as well. I ordered the Calamari Alla Griglia, which is marinated grilled calamari and grilled vegetables. The calamari was tender and very flavorful. I tried the Spaghetti Puttanesca as my entree. I requested it be made a little spicy, which the chef did perfectly. I have been all over Italy as well as the U.S. and this place it top notch. I&#39;ll be eating there again tonight!

antonio-ristorante-itasca,Alina S.,1wyqCRidzCUxAH79AeZB9Q,fGoDGXel9CTzhtS3cVh4uQ,"All in all your typical Italian restaurant. 
Went here for my boyfriend&#39;s work holiday dinner. I would say this place is 2.5 stars. 
Service was ok, again i understand it being busy but when you come in with larger party that you booked in advance you&#39;d think they&#39;d make sure there was enough help. Meal started a bit annoyingly as I waited for my white wine quite awhile after everyone else at the table had the red wine that was on the table poured for them. Then I proceeded to wait while everyone else had their drinks brought to them. Even the pop &amp; iced tea. 

Appetizers were a burnt and too chewy octopus and oysters rockafellars which were pretty tasty but again nothing to write home about. Minestrone soup was your standard non-homemade (or at least tastes like it) variety. 
My entree sounded much yummier the way it was described on the specials menu. Peas were mentioned yet I didn&#39;t see them. All there was was a ribeye (over-cooked) and literally 4 thin potato wedges surrounding the steak on all 4 sides. Not very fulfilling as a protein. Wish that was better explained by the server or on the menu. Dessert was a sampler platter with pana cotta, tiramisu, teeny tiny cannoli and cheesecake.

Again nothing special.  Not sure there anything unique or wonderful enough to make me come back again.",20/12/15,147,2,2,3,32,2.7097999999999995,1.422,0.641,14.936000000000002,No,1333

antonio-ristorante-itasca,Ron S.,EwjXcxI3uoL_0cJ5kfJPzw,xNCs_Xx-3I2tMPiHfloq1g,"Antonio&#39;s is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  My wife and I ordered pasta.  I ordered Penne Bolognese.  This is my typical &#34;acid test&#34; when trying an Italian restaurant for the first time.  The sauce was excellent with nice pieces of ground sirloin and a delicious savory and somewhat smokey flavor.  This is not a just thrown together sauce.  It&#39;s obvious that they simmer this sauce for hours.  If you are a fan of Bolognese you would do well to give this a try.

My wife ordered bowtie pasta with salmon in a vodka sauce.  She enjoyed this as well although I think I had the &#34;winner&#34; of the two dishes.  Portions are ample and we both had enough for small meals to take home.

They offer dozens of wines and an extensive selection of Italian wines which is nice to see for a change of pace.  They are reasonably priced at $6 to $10 a glass but you have many more options if you order by the bottle.

This could have been a 4-star review except for a  couple of items.  The only areas that were just adequate was the salad that only comes with their house oil &amp; vinegar dressing.  (If there were other options, our server didn&#39;t mention them.)  I found it just average.  Our young female server was pleasant but didn&#39;t tell us that there were was a soup option other then Minestrone (Scarole).  She didn&#39;t explain any of the specials either as the male server did to an adjacent table.  Not a big deal but the place only had 4 tables occupied and she could have spent a little more time explaining the dining options.  Again, not a big deal and it certainly won&#39;t prevent us from coming back. 

Finally, although both of our dishes were very good, prices for pasta dishes are just a bit on the high side.  There are 3 other Italian restaurants within a 15 minute drive that we frequent and Antonio&#39;s seems to be at the high end.

As I mentioned, this is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Very good pasta preparations and an interesting wine list are highlights.  I&#39;ll be back to try one of their wood-fired pizzas.",06/12/15,213,3,3,5,73,5.4426000000000005,2.631,0.074,23.295,No,2083

While the food was great and the place was adorable, one weird thing happened that knocked my review down,
I ordered a pizza and after a while, they brought out a pizza. It looked like the pizza I ordered, so they gave it to us and left. I picked up a slice and cut off a piece for my coworker to try. At this point, the server reappeared and it turned out that that wasn&#39;t the pizza I had ordered, it was brought to the wrong table. That&#39;s fine, it happened. But he had my pizza with him, and when I asked to have the pizza I ordered rather than the one they brought us by mistake, seeing as I had ordered it the way I wanted it and all, they said no, because I had taken the first slice I had &#34;already started it&#34; and couldn&#39;t have the pizza I ordered instead. So customer service here is apparently &#34;If you trust us to get your order right, you don&#39;t get your food if we screw up.&#34; Now the pizza was still good, and it wasn&#39;t THAT different than what I had actually ordered, but that is still a really bad way to treat your customers, I think. We hadn&#39;t even taken a bit of the first piece, and I wasn&#39;t asking to keep BOTH, I just wanted the one I ordered. They apologized, which was nice, but that didn&#39;t change the fact that I still wasn&#39;t allowed to have what I ordered.

In the end, we&#39;ll probably go back, but it will not be soon, and I will definitely be double checking our orders before they&#39;re touched.",27/10/15,163,2,1,2,4,1.0556,1.3359999999999999,0.626,10.037,No,1622

Simply put, Antonio&#39;s does almost everything right!  Warm greeting at the front door, service is super accomodating and very polite.  But let&#39;s talk about the food.  They are REALLY generous portions.  If you leave hungry, that&#39;s your own fault.

They have a huge selection of things on their menus from pancakes to french toast to bennies to sandwiches and more! The more we looked at the menu, the more we kept changing our minds because everything sounded so good! 

We started off with the strawberry mimosas! (Mimosas for breakfast, why not?! It was 5&#39;o clock somewhere.) I&#39;ve had them in other flavors but not strawberry, I loved these.

I went in with my heart set on french Toast since I have been craving some good french toast for weeks now! I couldn&#39;t decide between which to get, but I ended up choosing the Stuffed French Toast which had fresh sliced strawberries, cream cheese stuffing, and topped with whipped cream. OMG! Let me tell you this one may be top 3 of the BEST french toast I&#39;ve ever had! I pretty much demolished the entire thing! Highly recommended. 

My cousin had the Florentine Bennie. I tried a bite and it was delish! She was highly satisfied with her choice as well.

As far as service, the waitress was nice and checked up onus frequently. And our food came out so fast, which was a plus since I was starving.

My wife had a healthy scrambler, and asked to not include the turkey sausage. When delivered it looked like the turkey had been cooked into the eggs then removed, a grey mess with the fruit put on the hot plate on a Romaine leaf. Picture the presentation.

We went in on a friday morning and there wasnt any wait. We were greeted by our server and she brought us coffee right away. I must share that one of the cups she gave us was dirty, had orange lipstick on it, yuck! No big deal though, she brought a clean one right away. 
So we looked over the menu and there were so many yummy things on it. I decided on the stuffed waffle. It was delicious! It was topped with powdered sugar and fresh strawberries. The inside had a pink filling with fresh strawberries and bananas, it was delectable. I was very happy with my meal. It was nice to see that they serve mimosas and bloodies too. I wasnt in the mood for a drink but I will for sure go back and have brunch along with a bloody soon.

Pros: Awesome service.  Nice large mimosa (twice size of Richard Walkers for same price).

Cons: I ordered eggs over easy.  Although the yolk was nice and runny, the egg whites were very overcooked.  They were dark brown and crunchy; cooked on too high of heat.  If you look through customer photos you will see how many of the eggs are burnt.  You would think a breakfast place would excell at eggs.  The breakfast potatoes were also sub par.

Overall, not a bad spot for breakfast but not a place I will be back to often.",24/01/16,95,2,1,2,-10,1.5958,1.734,0.242,10.024,No,712

This has become one of my staple favorites and for very good reasons. If you&#39;re unhappy with anything kindly ask your server for new hash browns if they are cold, as I have done, or take a crew and share different dishes together to sample as much of the menu as possible. 

My recommendations are to go at least 2 hours before they close. If there is a wait, just be patient, you won&#39;t waste away by the time you get a table.

It was as rich and delicious as you would expect, without being overly sweet or filling. A cannoli crepe special included one thin vanilla crepe lightly stuffed with cannoli like cream and a few chocolate chips, topped with pistachios, your choice of eggs and bacon. It took me all of .6 seconds to decide on my meal. BOOM. Hubs enjoyed a massive breakfast burrito and the little one was more than happy grabbing handfuls of scrambled egg and diced potatoes.

While I didn&#39;t really get to see too much of the restaurant, I have to tell you why...

We waited for 20 minutes for brunch on a weekend (no surprise there), but once we ordered our food came out in less than 10 minutes. They really, really know how to turn tables here. And they don&#39;t turn &#39;em and burn &#39;em, they just get your food out quickly and with a friendly smile.

We went in on Thursday afternoon around 1:30pm. Place was pretty empty, not surprised because they close at 2:30pm, so I&#39;d guess normally people come to eat in early hours.

I ordered a simple two eggs with bacon and pancakes, served with potato bites. Bacon and eggs were rather cold, it felt like they were pre cooked already, could have got better from a hotel bfast buffet.  Friend&#39;s portella mushroom was nothing better, lots of cheese - which is unneccesary. Fruit was not fresh either, how difficult is it to serve nice and fresh fruit? 

Pancakes was ok in the whole meal. Rest are horrible.

Latte was ok too, but i wouldn&#39;t want to visit this place again. Too bad and I have no idea how it could get 4 stars rating....",24/10/14,100,2,1,-1,-5,-1.2926000000000002,0.868,2.7340000000000004,7.398,No,748

The place is bigger than what it appears from the outside and was packed the entire time we were there. We got seated right away. The service was great and the wait time for our food was not long at all. My boyfriend ordered the meat and potato skillet and half order of bisquits and gravy and I had the stuffed portabello.

This establishment is a professional regarding brunch time cuisine. It took us a good while to even make a decision as to what to eat because EVERYTHING looks so darn FABULOUS. Additionally, I found myself flipping through all 117 pictures posted on Yelp of the different entrees while we waited for our booth. The traditional choices were there... but with a fun flare and creative twist.

I finally narrowed things down to the Signature French Toast and the Flourentine Eggs Benedict... because they were so heavily raved about on Yelp. The waitress was super cool and asked if I was interested in playing some brunch roulette. I said, &#34;yes !&#34; The hubs ordered the brunch chicken and the FIL ordered the Reuben. 

A quick 15-20 minutes later  I covered my eyes and POOF a glorious plate of Signature French Toast with strawberries, kiwi, and vanilla infused icing was placed in front of me, ready to be devoured.

Not a bite was spared. 

This place is PERFECT for brunches, delicious food, a family meal, and an opportunity for a good time with great food.  Cannot wait to go back!",10/11/13,126,5,2,5,11,5.8067,4.548,0.0,9.452,No,1109

Had I known what I was missing I might not have let it sit idly pending, but the past is the past. I loved it. 

In previous years, I&#39;ve had a personal Quest for the Best challenge, and one of the criteria was Best Eggs Benedict. I mention this, because the BC was the catalyst to resurrect that challenge...however it&#39;s going to be extremely difficult to find a contender to compete the Brunch Cafe&#39;s solid, top spot on the list. The decor is modern, and cozy; It&#39;s got the charming bustle of a diner; and the menu is impressive. Tea drinkers should be pleased with their &#39;tea board&#39; which offers small samples of the blends they offer, so you can interact with the tea before making a blind selection based on the name (it&#39;s a nice touch). I guess the Scrambler plates leave something to be desired, but one cannot help get food envy when a scrambler is delivered side by side with the eggs benedict. 

Needless to say, I&#39;m a fan. I&#39;ve recommended Brunch Cafe to friends and family (and a stranger once which was a little awkward, but oh well) so I&#39;ll certainly be back for more. Honestly though, it&#39;ll be very tough to try something new knowing what I know about the eggs benedict.

Read great reviews here and wanted to check this place out.  First off, our waitress was very friendly and helpful in answering our questions about what was &#39;popular&#39; and her recommendations.  Service was outstanding also.  Came with 2 friends who ordered the caliente omelet (this was enormous and looked like what an omelet should look like, big and fluffy ). She said it was delicious!  My other friend and I both had the south beach scrambler.  We tried a side of biscuits and gravy, biscuits were very tender and fresh, sausage gravy was tasty and not greasy or heavy.  I enjoyed these!  South beach scrambler has spinach, bacon and avocado with melted montery jack cheese.  This was good, but I assumed the avocado was on the side and not in the scrambler (bad assumption).  I love spinach, and like avocado, but the avocado was a little too overwhelming for me as there was a lot of it in the scrambler, lots of spinach too, but that didn&#39;t bother me.  Avocado can be a bit heavy so I would have preferred less and couldn&#39;t even finish half of my order.  Brunch potatoes were pretty simple and could have been served warmer.  We tried a side of buttermilk pancakes also and these were pretty good!  Everyone commented that they tasted something sweet in the batter...not sure what it is, I&#39;ll have to ask the waitress next time.  They were decent though. Kindof of creamy, but fluffy...these were different.
Next time I would try the omelet or eggs benedict, lots of menu options..  I will be back though.  Our food was served in less than 10 minutes!!  No lie!!  Super fast, attentive service.

I had remembered someone talking about this place before, so we decided to try them out, AND they deliver to our house - score!

The Egg Drop Soup and Hot and Sour Soup were awesome. I normally hate hot and sour soup, but there&#39;s something about babybaking that makes me just love the hell out of it. My daughter loved the egg drop soup and scarfed it.

I was really surprised when we ordered the Chicken and Mixed vegetables and the sauce actually tasted like something. That&#39;s how I knew we had ordered from the place right by us for too long. Sauces are actually supposed to TASTE like things, craziness! 

The man got mongolian beef and he dug it, said it reheated well the next day too when he brought it for lunch. I was all about the Chicken Fried Rice and Crab Rangoon. The insides are cream cheesy, but they taste good, and the outside is golden, crispy, and goood.


This place had better food than the place right by our house, and the prices were much better. We&#39;ll definitely be ordering from here again. I&#39;m sure i&#39;ll be craving the hot and sour soup soon enough.

When you first get there it looks extremely small but once inside its spacious and looks like a very upbeat and cool place to eat at. The mens are on some computer screens so those are easy to read but It took the lady at the counter like 15 minutes to take our order even tho we were the only ones in there. Also a weird and kind of annoying thing was that she wouldn&#39;t let us order one drink to share. We sat down and waited for our food which didn&#39;t take a long time to be brought to us. We ordered the small spicy orange chicken to share for $6.50 ish. Which we were glad we did because it was so much food. Their white rice is very good but the orange chicken was a bit too saucy for my taste. Besides that it was an excellent experience.,19/04/15,89,4,2,3,17,2.6562999999999994,1.333,0.214,7.452,No,864

The place is clean and relatively new. I scanned the menu for something a little out of the ordinary, and found it in the Panang Curry with Chicken. With an egg roll I spent $6.75, tax included, which is a bargain.

I sat down, and not 2 minutes later, the meal comes out. As can be expected, $6.75 buys you an enormous amount of food - I have more than enough for leftovers tomorrow. Fried rice is standard with the lunch special, which I also appreciated.

The curry was simple but hot... certainly not complex but I&#39;m not complaining either. The veg was tender. The chicken was... uhh... ephemeral. I shouldn&#39;t be able to use that word for chicken, but... it had little flavor and absolutely no bite. I think next time I&#39;ll try the beef, and hopefully in the future the restaurant can use fresh chicken, sauteed properly.

On the brighter side of things the eggroll was very crisp and went well with their sweet and sour sauce.

No fortune cookie served with the food or on the way out, which was a bummer. Overall though I&#39;d come back to Mr. Wok.",04/06/13,151,4,2,4,23,3.0943,2.018,0.398,13.584,No,1245

The biggest plus about this place is the speed in which they churn out the food. My orders usually take about 4-6 minutes to be ready. That is pretty damn impressive even for chinese take out. Quality is a mixed bag some things are good, some aren&#39;t. 

So far I had the: 

Fried Potstickers (Around 5 bucks): these things are awful and I&#39;m pretty sure they are frozen store bought. 

Small Szechuan Beef($7.00): It tastes like a spicy sweet and sour beef. They should rename it Szechuan vegetables with Beef because its mostly vegetables. 

Beef Chow fun($10.00): Not too bad, but still needs more meat. 

Considering the time it takes to finish an order. I would definitely put this in the fast food category so compared to KFC or McDonalds or BK, this place is pretty darn good. 

Also the atmosphere has a chain restaurant feel. They clearly hired some marketing people to decorate and design the interior. Its a nice touch.",08/08/14,129,3,1,5,-6,4.6465000000000005,3.0519999999999996,0.48,11.468000000000002,No,1028

In visiting Mr. Wok I decided to try a few different items. General Tso&#39;s chicken, pot stickers, crab rangoon and the fried rice that came with the chicken. My overall opinion is that the food is average. The general tso&#39;s chicken wasn&#39;t very spicy and was more sweet. It had a good flavor and I&#39;d eat it again. The fried rice with the chicken was pretty good though a bit cold. The crab rangoons were mostly cream cheese and weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but were decent. The pot stickers were a bit of a disappointment as they seemed a bit over cooked to where the outside had a harder more rubbery texture than most places.

So, after a long weekend of doing home renovations we decided on bbq. I suggested this place and since it was about a twenty min drive, we decided not to call for takeout but wash up and go dine-in. 

When we arrived it was 7:45pm (just fifteen minutes until the posted close time on the door.) The hostess said it was too late to eat here but we could order takeout. Then she briskly led us through the large restaurant to the back where we were supposed to order takeout.

In my whole life, this has never happened to me. We were tired from working all day, so we placed our order for takeout and sat on a little bench in front of the serving line. A woman behind the register identified herself as the owner&#39;s sister-in -law.

She was personable yet complained to us that a party of 15 just arrived before us with no reservations (the restaurant  was about 3/4 empty.) I explained that yes my husband &amp; I also just arrived too but we were escorted back to her at take out ( I was thinking perhaps maybe she would seat us and apologize for being told we were too late But no. That didn&#39;t happen.)

While we waited for our dinner, I saw two plates that were sent back to the kitchen because we were literally sitting next to the food pass. When our food was ready, we left without fanfare. 

When we arrived home my baked potato was cold and my baby back ribs were warm. I nuked the potato for 3 mins. My baked potato was not fully cooked in the middle. My ribs tasted alright but they were so tough they had to be cut off the bone with a knife. My husband liked the brisket, but we were still mystified at being turned away for seating while there were clearly people (including the party of 15 ) that had just been seated. The cornbread &amp; coleslaw was good, but it&#39;s doubtful we will return.",04/09/16,209,1,2,1,20,0.687,1.364,0.795,18.841,No,2011

I had the platter. The Brisket was disappointing. It seemed dry. Slattered it with bbq to make it taste better. Bq chicken was a little better and more moist with smoke flavor. Still wasn&#39;t blown away. I enjoyed the Mac and cheese. It was creamy with out being over powered with salt.

Food was ok. I got the pulled pork plate with baked beans. It also came with cornbread and coleslaw. Nothing on that plate was really phenomenal. The pulled pork was good, seasoned well &amp; not dry. The flavors just didn&#39;t jump out at me. Same with the baked beans. The cornbread was pretty good in my opinion. The coleslaw was nasty. To be fair though, I generally don&#39;t like coleslaw so it takes some phenomenal coleslaw to please me.

It had very little flavor and looked almost as if it was cooked in the microwave. I had the Mac and cheese for a side, but they were bland.

Now onto the service. My order was takeout and the man taking my order lacked interpersonal skills and customer service. He definitely lacked in customer service skills and was not friendly.

Started off with a Bloody Mary - they had a special that day, Bloody Mary&#39;s for $2. They use their barbecue sauce in their mix and the taste is pronounced. It adds a sweetness I&#39;m not used to in this drink. I can&#39;t say I really liked it, and I think I know why it was only $2 - very little vodka and no condiments.

The meal - I had their brisket meal with red beans and rice. The beans and rice was very good. The brisket was dry and flavorless unfortunately. Service sometimes can make up for a meal, but no so much here. I can&#39;t say it was bad, but it wasn&#39;t good either.

The rest of them were moist but not much smokey flavor, only doused with sauce. The wings were supposedly fried but were not crispy.  Also, one of the wings had feather still on it - gross!!

My wife purchased a groupon for this restaurant.  We went this past Friday night. (4-15-16).  When we arrived, there was a couple sitting at the bar that we knew.  They were going to sit at the bar and eat.  I suggested all of us sit at a high top in the bar so we could talk easier.  They paid their bill at the bar and moved to our table.  When the waitress came over, my wife told her that we had a groupon.  The other couple said that they had one too.  The waitress told us that we could only use one groupon per table.  We explained that the other couple was from the bar and they were going to use their groupon and we were here separately going to use ours.  She said she was not allowed to do that.  We asked to see the manager.  A few minutes later the &#34;manager&#34; came to our table.  We explained our story and was told in a &#34;dees dems does&#34; wanna be attitude, &#34;we got rules here&#34;, &#34;I can&#39;t let you do that, I&#39;d have to let everyone else do it&#34;.  All of a sudden I was back in first grade.  This manger also stated that these groupons make us lose money.  Customers take advantage of us.  I looked around and noticed that the place was pretty empty for a Friday night that the Blackhawks were playing in the playoffs on tv.  I remember thinking that the place should of been packed.   But, we all stayed together and had dinner.  

The food part of this review is ok, but nothing to write home about.  The presentation and taste was good. The portions were good sized.  At least they have a good cook.  It&#39;s just that the management staff is horrible.  Getting into a conversation with a customer about the restaurant loosing money is unacceptable in ANY situation.  They seemed to be displeased about us even using one groupon.  Complaining that they weren&#39;t making as much money with &#34;these groupons&#34;.  I&#39;m not a big groupon or coupon guy.  But one thing I do know is that coupons or groupons are supposed to get you in the door.  It&#39;s up to the restaurant to make you want to come back.

It&#39;s really too bad.  The building is beautiful, this food was good, the drinks were good.  Manager Mike, told us that the General Manager (Richard Jurczak) makes the rules.  So, I&#39;m not sure, but maybe the problem here starts at the very top. The management is running this restaurant into the ground, with the attitude that the customers take advantage of us.

Having read many of the other reviews, I tried my best to go in without any preconceptions. I should state that where we live near Bartlett, there are three excellent barbecue places to go to. That said, we like the barbecue sauce, so we figured the food should be OK. First, the brisket. As other people have stated, it was very dry. The only parts of the brisket that tasted great were those that had been well saturated in barbecue sauce. The one piece that had no barbecue sauce on it was dry and virtually tasteless. The chicken was excellent, and by the chicken, I mean the barbecued chicken that came with the three meat platter. The St. Louis ribs were very tasty, mostly because of the aforementioned barbecue sauce. It seems to me that they boil the ribs before they bake them, which some places do in order to make them fall off the bone tender. That said, the ribs were not terribly fatty, they were meaty, and well worth the ordering. The sides weren&#39;t terribly remarkable, and were much the same as you&#39;d get it any other barbecue joint. We went early on a Friday evening, and the place was only about half full. I mention that because the service was a bit on the slow side. It was alright as we were not in any great rush. Would we go back again? Not really.

Overall it was a very nice experience. Food was great, waitress was attentive, and prices were decent.

I was in town on a business trip by myself and looking for a late night restaurant. They&#39;re not super late, but it worked with my schedule. It was relatively empty by the time I got there but thankfully no funny attitudes from any workers for being one of the last customers of the night.

The menu isn&#39;t huge but it does specialize in BBQ, specifically their wet sweet style. I got a full rack of ribs with cornbread and coleslaw. Pretty good. Half the ribs were a little tougher then usual but it&#39;s always hard to gauge rib quality until you actually bite down into them. Food came out in a decent amount of time and the waitress made sure to check on me several times. Gave me some recommendations as well.

I was at a table near the bar the place was very clean, noise levels pretty decent (not too loud), and several TVs were on with various sports playing. They have outdoor seating as well.

If you&#39;re in town I&#39;d recommend giving it a shot. I&#39;d be surprised if you didn&#39;t enjoy it. The only reason I&#39;m knocking a star off is because it doesn&#39;t offer dry rub ribs and some of the ribs I had were a little tough.

Our most recent visit was on a Sunday evening.  There were few other customers present, which does not explain the less-than-attentive service we experienced.  Our St. Louis ribs, which we enjoyed on a previous visit, were warmed-over, ends as hard as tree bark.  We had to glop on extra BBQ sauce to compensate for the dry, overcooked meat.

About 10 minutes into the meal, our server finally came over to ask how everything was.  We told her in no uncertain terms.  She replied, &#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; and walked away (if you&#39;re not going to fix the problem, then why bother to ask?).

So the next day, I sent a polite email to the restaurant using the link on the &#34;Contact Us&#34; webpage.  The email promptly bounced.

sweet-baby-rays-barbecue-elk-grove-village,Catherine P.,#NAME?,KP5OpTtE63z8Sssynop_fQ,"I had a few clients come in from Texas today so when trying to decide where to take the guests, the first and foremost thing was it had to be Chicago-based. The second was it had to be something good! And the last thing I was looking for was something with plenty of options because I was unsure of what they might enjoy.

My boss had suggested some crappy restaurant with bad reviews around the corner from our office and I thought SBR&#39;s would at least be something new they may not have had before and being Chicago based, I thought that might add a little fun to the mix. 

Off we go for lunch around 2 or so. Yes a bit late but I figured we might get some better service if they&#39;re not busy. 

We walked in and no one was there to greet us. Boo SBR&#39;s!  We waited a few moments while they set up a table for 5 in an almost empty restaurant and we took our seats. 

It took a few minutes the be greeted by a server and when we finally were, it was a woman whom made me feel as if we were interrupting her day be eating here. Well let me tell you something, miss grumpy pants, service with a just a little smile can go a long way.

So lets start with getting our drinks...I swear that our server went to another restaurant down the road to get them. It must have taken 8 minutes. What the heck?!

Of the five of us, three of us ordered a side salad or soup. The soup came out almost immediately. The salads about 10 minutes later. The food, before the ladies were even done with their salads...they really need to work on timing. It was a joke. 

The food was good. The quality is there. The portions are excellent. They could actually offer half portions for a discounted price, if they wanted to open up their market to more people. The salads were huge and the two grown men at our table, with strong appetites were not able to finish their salads. A half portion would have been ideal for lunch for someone like myself. 

They do offer a $10 lunch dealio that includes a soft drink or iced tea. Not a bad offer. But cut the potion down and make it a $7.50 deal!

The guests we had with us, are on some sort of diet where they aren&#39;t allowed sugars or carbs. They explained this to our server. Reviewed their menu options and even the server told them specifically that their BBQ sauce has a lot of sugar in it. The ladies split a burger that was topped with pulled pork and onions and to their surprise the pulled pork was covered in BBQ sauce. So they ended up sending back their food to be remade with &#34;sauce-less&#34; pulled pork. After further discussion, it appeared the menu didn&#39;t state the BBQ sauce on the burger and being that the ladies chatted with the server about their dietary restrictions, you would think she would have mentioned the pulled pork had the sauce on it. Kinda disappointing. 

I asked the server to wrap up my leftovers for me and I got the snotty response of &#34;I&#39;ll bring you a box&#34;. Now, let me tell you something, I totally respect and understand company policies but there are better ways to respond to my request such as &#34;I wish I could but were not allowed...could I bring you a box instead?&#34; or &#34;actually we&#39;re not allowed to wrap up food, but I would be happy to bring you a container.&#34; 

It&#39;s all about service, people. If you don&#39;t like being a server, go find something else to do. Servers make money by providing good service and satisfying their tables enough so that the table wants to leave them a huge tip for their hard work during their visit. That&#39;s the hospitality industry. That&#39;s serving. Either you&#39;re in or your out. 

Not sure I&#39;ll be rushing back anytime soon.

After all, I use the Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s BBQ sauce at home after ditching another brand several years ago.

I did everything backwards the last time I visited SBRBBQ. I had the Texas Brisket Sandwich for $10.99. It really tasted good but made me even hungrier. Have you ever eaten something so good that instead of getting full, you just get more hungrier? My son in law really took advantage of the situation and ordered this plate of food that had no end in sight. So as I sat there watching him pig out on the BBQ Platter I checked in on Yelp and scored a free appetizer.

I decided to get The BBQ Lovers Platter Appetizer. So I started with an entree and ended with an appetizer. And boy was this thing packed with a lot of meat with the BBQ flavor just oozing out everywhere. I can&#39;t believe this plate was an appetizer, and now I can see why it was $10.99. Of course, I did share it with all of my dining companions. This app had KC Burnt Ends but believe me when I tell you that the description &#34;Burnt Ends&#34; does not do justice to the amount of food that there was. And it sure didn&#39;t taste burnt to me.

Had a Groupon that was $28 for a $50 deal for food only - I may have gotten a discount on it as well. So I met a longtime friend of mine as its location is equidistant from both of us - about 25 miles from different directions. I got there before he did and sat in the bar as the hostess that sat me indicated we could get dinner there. She asked me if there was anything I wanted, so I indicated I was interested in a glass of wine and she brought me a wine list. Not a lot of people in the bar at that time and a few in the restaurant, so I get the impression that one or both of the hostesses will be involved in the serving process at our table. But that never really materialized.

For the most part, the bartender served us from that point on. But as time passed, the bar got busier and he wasn&#39;t really equipped to maintain our order, other people&#39;s orders and make all the drinks too. Now, that said we weren&#39;t in a rush to get anywhere so the slow pace wasn&#39;t disruptive. And as noted the ambience was great (it is a beautiful older hotel) and everyone was friendly, so hanging out was fine. We ordered food - the eggroll appetizer; my friend ordered the lamb and I got an adobo skirt steak. I ordered that medium rare, but it came out medium - not a total surprise as cooking a skirt steak MR isn&#39;t easy - but at a restaurant of this level, it should have been correct. As I made a comment about the missed temperature, my friend commented, &#34;there&#39;s your rare&#34; as he was cutting into his lamb. It was pretty red - a little more so than what it should have been.

Drinkwise, my friend ordered a brandy manhattan which was nicely done and I had a couple of Bordeaux&#39;s which were outstanding. There was a keyboard player / singer and while the sound of the instrumentation there is a little tinny, the musician himself was pretty cool. 

So when it&#39;s all said and done, in my opinion given the type and quality of restaurant that the ROX is, the food fell a bit short and the service somewhat shorter. But the atmosphere was great and the staff was very friendly so I will be back - it is a nice and rather unique place to spend an evening for dinner.

We were quickly seated in this small dining room.  There were probably only about 20 tables max, but yet it seemed to take forever for anything to happen here.  I was delighted to find out that there was a $6 martini special on Thursdays and when I got my martinis, they were good.  

Our waiter came by to take our order and I started with a bananas foster martini.  Getting our drinks took awhile.  When the waiter came to take our order, we mentioned wanting some raw oysters and then ordered the filet sliders and the oysters.  Our friends ordered a tortilla soup and a Asian chicken salad.  The food took quite awhile to come out, and when it did we were shocked to see that the oysters we received were cooked with spinach and a cream sauce.  Although disappointed, we ate them anyway.  The sliders were excellent and our friends salad and soup were also pretty good.  

The waiter asked me if I&#39;d like another martini and I said yes, put in my order and waited and waited.  Eventually we wanted to switch tables to be closer to the live piano player that they had for the evening.  When I pointed out that he had never brought my drink, he said - &#34;well, I will take it off your bill&#34;.  No kidding.  Do you think I am going to pay for something I didn&#39;t receive?

We like to eat out and just check out new things. We also had a coupon that should of worked but it didn&#39;t (more on that later).

So since I am a college head coach I have to admit that I am a beer/chicken wing kind of guy. I asked what the pork wings were and the server explained it to me. I asked if it is big and is it compared to Buffalo Wild Wings (my favorite place on Earth). She said it had a bigger portion that Bdubs and that is is a lot better then Bdubs.. So I ordered it. My girlfriend ordered the chicken. So here where everything goes south.

First, the pork wings were terrible. To make things worst...there were ONLY TWO!! And the price for them was NINE DOLLARS! FOR TWO TERRIBLE WINGS!!  You can get 12 wings for the same price at Bdubs that taste a whole lot better. How can she say Bdubs was not as good as those 2 pork wings!! Terrible!!

Second, my girlfriend&#39;s chicken was bland. It was rotissere chicken. We could of eaten a better rotissire chicken at Boston Market for a cheaper price!! I ended up eating it for her.

Third, the coupon we had specifically had an expiration date. However they didn&#39;t take it saying they had to log into something and they couldn&#39;t do it. They did give us a 10 dollar coupon instead so I would have to give them that, but we still wouldn&#39;t of saved as much as we did with that coupon.

I have to admit, the blueberry they put on top of the butter they bring out was quite tasty. 

I personally think this place was a huge rip off. As a college head coach, I like to eat out and especially at the upscale restaurants whenever I go on the road, but this is by far the worst ever.

I am originally from St. Charles, and have lived in San Diego area over 30 years.  I have always loved the Hotel Baker, and, in fact, got married there 33 years ago.  I had read some reviews of the Rox City Grill, and decided to check it out while in town.

Yesterday, my niece and I went to St. Charles to check out my old &#34;digs&#34; and reminisce a bit. We stopped at the Hotel Baker, thinking we&#39;d have a late lunch, but found out they wouldn&#39;t be serving until 5:30.  When we stepped in the bar, we were immediately greeted by the ultra charming bartender, Joe.  I mentioned to Joe that I had read a bit about him in reviews here on Yelp, and he humbly stated that he had heard he was in some.

We told him we&#39;d be back a bit later for Martini&#39;s and a snack.  Upon our return, about 4 hours later, Joe greeted us both by name, came right over to our table, and took our drink order.  We had fun bantering with him, then off he went to fill our martini orders.

The martinis were great, and at $ 6.00 (which is the Thursday special) a pretty good value, although I prefer martini glasses which are a bit larger.  If I was rating the martinis and Joe- I&#39;d give a solid 4 1/2!

We ordered a couple of appetizers- one which is supposed to be Korean steak you cook yourself, and some Pomme Frites.  The steak- which I&#39;ve had numerous times over the years, is typically marinated and flavorful. This one had NO flavor whatsoever.  It was 5 very tiny slices, for $11.00. Probably the equivalent of about 1 oz of steak.  Not a great eating experience, or value.  The Pomme Frites were OK, if a bit pricey.

They have entertainment, a piano player, who started at 8:30. That seems like a strange time to have him start, mid week, but we were told it is so the diners aren&#39;t disturbed while eating.  It would seem to me, you&#39;d have him start at 7 or 7:30, and play quiet music to dine by- as the bar was pretty darned full of people- and then at least the bar crowd would have a bit of entertainment.  It would seem to me he could play quieter music, maybe suited a bit to the time period of the hotel, and then pick up the volume and/or tempo after the diners leave......... but that&#39;s just my logical business mind thinking here.....

The atmosphere of the bar is nice- I wasn&#39;t too taken with the dcor in the dining room.

Joe is definitely the &#34;trump card&#34; here at Hotel Baker&#39;s lounge.  I hope they keep him, and I may be in next summer when in town for my class reunion.",17/10/14,306,3,1,5,-10,6.037400000000001,2.54,0.718,20.741999999999997,No,2600

As much as I had called and checked that YES there is a piano player on Wed night, there was not. And if there was they would have started at 8:30, last dinner order at 9:00, I don&#39;t know about the bar menu. Still pretty pricey and frankly we were still HUNGRY when we got home after Swordfish and 2 lamb &#34;portherhouses&#34;. Wed $5 margaritas had no discernable alcohol, decent but pricey $11 pinot by the glass, a bottle is a better deal if that works for you. I&#39;ve always found the servers to be very good here. Cost us the $15 cash out on the Groupon, plus another $43 over the $50 groupon ($27 alcohol) so plus tip $71 and we were still HUNGRY. 

This is why we have switched to the BeeHive Tavern on Arcada theater nights. Well executed very reasonable bar food. The fish tacos and the separate Talapia plate melt in your mouth. Not always LOUD there, no louder than the late bar at the Rox City grill.

Lunch review, still can&#39;t take it beyond 3 stars like the good old dayze. 
Too expensive, erratic and they don&#39;t let you eat in the back deck on the river anymore. The tables and umbrellas are still there. I want to say what a shame, but I will just say the place was empty.

I can&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t seat outside anymore on a beautiful day. It&#39;s not like they are too busy, it was basically empty when my older brother and I came in for a late lunch at 1:30 midweek. In fact I got in an unnecessarily long conversation with a hostess who insisted they had NEVER seated outside. Yikes.

Our lunch inside was good, served perfectly by Hank. I can recommend the cobb salad which was deliciously unusual with Arugula, pork tenderloin, poached egg, sun dried tomatoes, blue cheese, diced potatoes. Also their own huge chunks of shredded pork sandwich, NOT thankfully buried in bbq sugar sauce. We were not a big fan of the warmed crab salad sandwich but our fault for missing the heated part of the sandwich description. The best way to make crab smell fishier is to heat it, so smother in lemon or better yet avoid it.

I still miss Donna and her newsletters. 
I had a $25 groupon that I paid $15 for $50, so it was a deal and a lot of leftovers. BUT without the groupon still 3 stars.
A-OK, but the Hotel Baker is not taking advantage of several of their many gorgeous resources here, the RIVER and the back deck for lunch.

There were 9 of us and i wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. I had been in one other time and had the filet sliders and tortilla soup. Both were very good. 

But back to this more recent visit...we were greeted by the bartender as we walked in and he was a very friendly older man who I found out later is truly an expert at his craft. All the cocktails in our group were (in the words if the ladies) yummy and perfectly mixed. Of course I personally was impressed with the scotch selection. And was happy to see the stocked some fine brands. 

I ordered the filet- perfection with the butter option. My wife and a couple others had the scallops and from the nice brown tops and soft not over cooked center they were phenomenal. My most senior staff person who eats fish all the time said it was the best tasting tilapia she&#39;s ever had. 

If I had one critique it would be that the host staff should have been more engaged in the operation than looking board at the host stand. 

As you can tell I was impressed and in spite of other comments here, the quality was well worth the price charged. And also, quit giving low stars because of your groupon  deal wasn&#39;t working.

Service was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was full enough to feel lively but not too crowded.

I tried it for the first time in February and have been back many times since then for dinner, lunch, ans sometimes just cocktails with appetizers. I have to say this restaurant is very consistently delicious. 

The first time I went, I went with my fiance (the pickiest eater in the world). He is a Midwest guy who loves his met and potatoes and is very critical of steaks. He is also never very impressed with the steaks he orders at a restaurant, always finds something wrong with it. We had an adorable server, Jessica, who was so fun and made great recommendations. Because of her, we ordered the tenderloin sliders for our appetizer. YUM!!! They had a shallot Aoli that was sooooo yummy! Then I ordered the day&#39;s special for my entree: steak with a sauce on top with smashed Yukon potatoes with herbs and feta cheese, and sauteed farm carrots. My portions were huge, and everything was delicious. Feta cheese is smashed potatoes, c&#39;mon, you really can&#39;t go wrong with that. Then I ordered gelato for dessert even though I didn&#39;t have any room left for more food - banana gelato with pralines and carmel.

The food and service was fantastic and even my very picky fiance loved every bite. We have gone back for our anniversary and other date nights. We always try to order something different each time, but we definitely get the sliders as our appetizer.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great date night with amazing food.",29/06/13,174,5,1,5,10,6.2837,3.9690000000000003,0.492,13.539,No,1498

I know we had a crab bun thing that melted in our mouth as appetizer, although it was a little to masking the flavor of the crab with cream.

Main dishes were delicious, I am now a huge fan of the gold pan fish or whatever they served me. The kabobs were great, again the flavor was overly dependent on the sauce though.

They do have great martinis here.  My husband and I started off with the shrimp cocktail, which was good.   I ordered the pork tenderloin and it was cooked way too much, it was very dry.  It had good flavor and the reduction sauce helped, but if they had shaved 10 minutes off the cook time, the pork would have been much better.  The whipped potatoes were very spicy.  I like spicy, so it was good for me but if you weren&#39;t into spice, you would have been in for a surprise.  The veggies were good too.  

My husband had the seared ahi tuna with noodles.  They said the ahi was fresh, but it&#39;s didn&#39;t have that deep red look of really great, really fresh ahi tuna.  I keep telling him that there is no way you can get fresh tuna in the midwest.  It has to be frozen and then defrosted.  He keeps trying though.

rox-city-grill-hotel-baker-saint-charles,Phyllis Z.,bKj3Cx0Bn5dFT-SA6lvXFQ,8dFm_oqaX25eHHC3fBRATg,"I&#39;ll start with the pluses:

Loved the atmosphere and enjoyed the live piano music that&#39;s featured in the lounge every Thursday.  The bread was warm and delicious.  The lobster bisque was awesome, and the pub chip appetizer was tasty and relatively inexpensive.  My husband and daughter enjoyed their entrees - hubby had swordfish and daughter ordered a filet.  I loved the mashed potatoes that came with their entrees, which I kept sampling because I was very hungry, 

which brings me to the minuses...

We waited really long for the waiter to come to our table to greet us, and to come back to take our order.  The menu was unappealing to me, as I am not a fan of big hunks of meat.  I ordered the skewers, which consisted of 3 small pieces of dry chicken breast; 3 pieces of overcooked filet and 3 small shrimp total, along with some veggies.  They were served with a thick and very sweet sauce which overpowered the scant flavor of the meat and reminded me of something you&#39;d get with a frozen dinner.  The coconut rice side dish was just weird.  At $25 it was a total ripoff.

Between a $50Groupon offer &amp; possible visit from other worldly spirits (not just the kind from the bartender), I was moderately excited to try this place.  Alas,  It didn&#39;t take long for that excitement to pass. 

My girlfriend, Kelly, &amp; I were quickly seated.  Kelly ordered a martini ($6 Martini Thursdays!) and raved about it, which is consistent with other reviews.  We also were quickly provided with bread, which was ok.  We then ordered the twin lobster rolls for $15.  They were pretty good, especially at that price.   Lots of lobster &amp; bacon,  but I would&#39;ve prefered smaller chunks of celery &amp; a bit more mayo.   For the price, they were the best value of the night.  For dinner, Kelly ordered the scallops and I ordered the 20 oz bone in ribeye.  The scallops were pretty tasty, albeit a bit chewy.  The risotto underneath the scallops was nothing special.  As far as my ribeye, it was smaller than I had expected. Perhaps the bone took up 10+ of the 20 oz.  I hate to say this, but it was one of the worst steaks I&#39;ve ever had, especially given the price.  It appeared to have been hot plated or pan cooked way too long.  It as way too charred,  not salted or seasoned in any way and very fatty/grisly.  While some fat/grisle is to be expected, it was over the top. The charred aftertaste lingered well after the meal was over.  The &#34;crushed&#34; mashed potatoes would have been better had there been salt &amp; butter embedded.  For the amount of money they were charging for the steak &amp; scallops, we&#39;ve had WAY betterone would expect less charring, more seasoning &amp; yes, the occasional dairy condiment. 

Service on the evening was good, not great.  They were short a server so our waiter wasn&#39;t overly available for us.  However, my water glass was always full.

rox-city-grill-hotel-baker-saint-charles,Rich S.,kahlRVWYilyqaTGGaZwWAg,r5IauVKSf252KjGt_h0nvg,"We were looking forward to a great New Year&#39;s Eve. Made reservations for the 2nd (last) seating for the evening, 8:30 PM.
From the moment we entered, we were constantly rushed, e.g. &#34;Would you like a cocktail? And are you ready to order now?&#34; Waitress Debra was disinterested, flip, and apparently only interested in getting us out ASAP so she could collect her tip and go home.
As I said, it was the second and last seating, so no one was waiting for a table - tables were opening up and going unfilled.
She was in such a hurry that, when we flagged her over to reorder a wine for one of the party, she flew away, before the rest of us could also reorder. She came back with the wine, I then asked for another, and she flew away again, again without asking anyone else.
When we reviewed the check, we found what we thought was a major mistake, and asked her for an explanation of charges. She acted very put out that we would even question the tab. She couldn&#39;t explain the charges, so we asked for a manager. She then became very curt and walked away.
The hostess then came over, couldn&#39;t explain the extra, inflated charges but said she&#39;d comp us for some of the alcohol tab, which reduced the bill approx. $50 . In retrospect, I think the problem was we were charged for cocktails with well liquor, then recharged for premium liquor. But, who knows? No one there could explain anything on the bill.
Later the General Manager, Mike, came over, and asked us what our problem was. Seemed bored and irked by the whole situation. We told him we&#39;d questioned the bill, no one could explain charges, and no one seemed to really care if it could be explained. Including him.
He talked and mumbled in circles, saying something about the fact that it&#39;s crazy tonight and the waitress was brought in from their banquet staff and didn&#39;t know what she was doing. And why is that my problem, and why was she turned loose on the patrons?
During his whole ramble, no apology for anything. He had an attitude of &#34;it is what it is - what am I supposed to do about it?&#34; He became so irritating that we finally encouraged him to just go away.
We then moved on to the dancing room, which required a ticket for entrance, part of the dinner package. Without the ticket, it was $25, which covered nothing except entrance. Surprise! No one gave us tickets!! We explained no one had given us tickets, at which point Mike the Manager came up from behind and said, very sarcastically, &#34;Just let her in.&#34;
The new owners had transformed the formerly beautiful and elegant Waterfront dining room into a room stripped bare of everything that made it elegant - just a big empty hall. There were only a handful of bistro tables and no chairs, so nowhere to put purses, drinks, etc. A decent DJ was playing, and there was one cash bar. Literally, CASH. Really? I&#39;m going to walk around on New Year&#39;s Eve with a wad of cash?
After about 20 minutes, we left and went to the bar/lounge area, got a table, ordered champagne and after the midnight toast went home.
We expected more from the formerly glorious Baker Hotel. It was not elegant, it was loud, with tables of 12-15 shouting at each other, and not what The Baker was previously (including our daughter&#39;s wedding ten years ago). Or, the New Year&#39;s Eve about ten years which was in the Rainbow Room, elegant, refined and everything you&#39;d expect from a fine dining experience. Rather, the Rox City Grill is a diner/grill, so why try to slap lipstick on it to pass it off as more than it is? Wouldn&#39;t it be better, at least for this occasion, make the Waterfront Room the restaurant for the evening, leave the Rox City as the bar/lounge, and have the dancing in the Rainbow Room ( a glorious dance room with lighted tile floor and a mezzanine, known in it&#39;s heyday as THE place to go for dancing in the western suburbs) Oh, wait - they booked a wedding reception in the Rainbow Room for New Year&#39;s Eve but forgot to tell anyone! Who forgets that they booked a wedding? Genius.
Perhaps the &#34;new&#34; owners should research the history of the establishment and get back to the roots.
At this point in time, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d recommend The Baker to anyone for anything. Hopefully, things will change, but they&#39;d have to work really hard and long to reclaim patrons they&#39;ve put off - one bad experience eliminates second, third fourth etc. chances.",12/01/14,530,2,1,-1,-54,-1.0288000000000002,5.158000000000001,3.4530000000000003,41.38899999999999,No,4468

I was a winner during Chicago Magazine&#39;s 40 days of giving. I won an overnight stay at the Baker Hotel in St. Charles and it included dinner and breakfast at the Rox City Grill.  I admit that free food usually taste better but their food was really pretty tasty.  We had sliders for our appetizer since we weren&#39;t planning to order one of their expensive steaks and I loved them.  We both had the wedge salad and while iceberg lettuce is not my favorite I like a wedge salad and theirs was great.  We shared scallops for our entree and while they weren&#39;t the best scallops I&#39;ve ever had they were good.  The lava cake for dessert was decent but could have been a little warmer.  I would definitely go there again for a free meal.,23/04/11,82,4,2,5,35,4.1704,2.3289999999999997,0.309,6.363,No,826

We weren&#39;t interested in any of the appetizers, but went straight for the wedge salads. Lots of thick blue cheese, and bacon over a crispy slice of romaine was really good. DH ordered the filet which was cooked perfectly and fork tender. He was not impressed as much by the spicy mashed potatoes. My butternut squash tortellaci, with duck bacon and cherry compote was amazing. Gelato dessert was average.

Atmosphere was very nice, service was great and the piano player in the adjacent lounge added a nice touch.  Altogether, a great experience.

We were seated right away in what was not the restaurant but rather a room across the lobby from the actually restaurant. They said they were opening a ballroom for dinner as there were large number of people coming but we were the only ones in the room at 7 PM. This should have been our clue to leave. There was only a pre-determined menu with a choice of either soup or salad and chicken or beef. No option to pick from the regular menu?! We knew there wouldn&#39;t be anywhere else to eat that night so we decided to roll with it. Service was quick and friendly (how could it not be if we were the only patrons?) Food was ordered and served within 20 minutes. It was a bland and disappointing meal. Chicken had no flavor and was accompanied by under cooked asparagus and perhaps box mix chunky potatoes. Beef was also under cooked (still cool on one side, lukewarm on the other!) and was sent back. It was also accompanied by the same sorry potatoes and asparagus. A different piece of beef returned after my date had already finished his plate. This piece was at least warm but again, no flavor. Dessert looked beautiful but again no flavor and had some kind of glittery glaze on it that left your mouth literally colored black and a sauce that seemed to be nothing more than orange juice concentrate.

Here is what went wrong:

*Menu had missing pages so we asked for a replacement.  It also had missing pages
*Waitress forgot water three times 
*Brought the wrong dessert but we couldn&#39;t have eaten it anyways because we didn&#39;t have any utensils
*Brought my husband lemonade instead of water (didn&#39;t she notice it wasn&#39;t clear like the water she poured me?)

When I went up to our room to use the bathroom, my husband said she was mush more attentive, coming around refilling the water and smiling.  Perhaps she just didn&#39;t like me?  

I do have to say though, throughout the entire disaster she was as nice as can be and tried to make it right.  That is the reason why I gave Rox City Grill three stars.

1. The atmosphere - we went on a snowy Wednesday, we were sat by the window which was great because we got to look out at the quaint St. Charles town. 
2. The service - most definitely not fine dining however our server Diane was pleasant, witty, quick, service oriented and just a wonderful woman to be around. 
3. The crab cakes and espresso martinis - delish! 

For my entree I had the pork medallions which consisted of two boneless pork chops with a mustard crust, with a blueberry/ cherry sauce, yam mash and three fried yucca chips. My favorite thing about the dish were the fried yucca chips. Everything else was just okay. The pork was over cooked, tough and bland, the yam mash was just gross, it was missing a sweet element and salt. The blueberry/cherry sauce was alright but it did not belong on the plate. 

Overall I would say the one thing missing was consistency and flavor. 

For dessert we had the apple tart, which was not a tart at all, it was a tart shell served with diced apples and caramel sauce on top, no tart or baking about it. 

I&#39;m sorry to say that I wouldn&#39;t dine here again, I would sit at the bar and maybe order an appetizer. This is merely a hotel restaurant, not really a fine dining experience.

Waitress was Darcy, she was wonderful.  had their Valentine&#39;s Day special &#34;Menage a Trois&#34;!  You had a choice of either osso bucco or the Menage a Trois which consisted of chateaubriand, lobster stuffed shrimp and a crab cake surrounded by wonderful potatoes and fresh asparagus.  Dinner came with a soup with duck confit or salad.  The dessert was perfect for the celebration.  A 3 layer cake with whipped cream along with other sweets.  Their martini&#39;s were right on! 

Highlight of the evening was one of the guests had 4 singers, dressed in white tuxedos, sing &#34;let me call you sweetheart&#34; to his wife of 30 years.  Everyone thought that was so beautiful.

Whenever I used to visit the Portillo&#39;s / Baranelli&#39;s combo, I always went to Baranelli&#39;s because they had no line, and Portillo&#39;s had a line 30 people deep! Looking back that should have been a serious red flag and a reality check that I was missing out on something amazing. Of course, time constraints always got the best of me, and Baranelli&#39;s short line won me over. 

Well, on my most recent visit to Portillo&#39;s, I finally branched out and stood in the long line on the other side of the building. Gasp! Well, the long Portillo&#39;s wait was certainly worth it. 

I indulged in a Chicago-style hot dog (which was truly Chicago-style, neon green relish and sports peppers galore!), spicy and sweet Italian beef sandwiches (I prefer the spicy), cheese fries, chopped salad (from Baranelli&#39;s) and the chocolate cake. All were simply heavenly. 

Their only downfall is their insane prices. Wow. Be prepared for an expensive bill-- when I first ordered the Italian beef and was asked to pay over $10, my eyes bugged out a little. But I suppose indulging once in awhile won&#39;t be too hard on the wallet!

But, after moving to Arizona, and missing Barnellies, and having  Mr. Portillo sell out.. the food has really been of less quality, and it shows.. the beef tastes like plastic, like the kind you buy in a barrel and the grocery store.

Went here a few weeks back and watched as they dropped my beef on the floor and stuck it in a bag and try to give it to me. Granted it was wrapped but still if it hits the floor it should be thrown away. The manger apologized and gave me a new one with a piece of cake for their mess up. Ok. I let it go. Today I ordered a beef and took a few bites until I got to a bite I couldnt really chew and it felt weird so I took it out of my mouth to find it was a brown piece of paper. Kind of like their napkins or a brown paper bag. I took it back for a refund but was talked into getting a new beef. Half was through I noticed a black spot on the paper the beef was wrapped in.

This place makes my mouth water. When I left Chicago many years ago, other than deep dish pizza, this place made me miss Chi-Town so much. Something about this place, they know how to make Italian Beef sandwiches. Yes, they are the very BEST!! No one compares. 

Italian Beef dipped, of course with Mozzarella cheese and hot peppers, oh my it gives you a huge foodgasm!!! Greasy, excellent fresh bread, awesome juice, thinly sliced beef to perfection. Fries are crinkled cut and always fresh and hot. Then another must is their tamale....oh so good, a bit spicy and delish. 

Now the hot dog&#39;s do not do it for me. I still prefer &#34;Jimmy&#39;s hot dog&#39;s in the city. All of their locations are clean, great service, fast with plenty room to dine in. The drive-thru&#39;s are quick and professional. This place is fast food at it&#39;s best. 

Seriously glad we do not have one here in Miami because I would weigh 300 pounds. I could never get tired of eating here.

I didn&#39;t see any mention of Barnelli&#39;s Pasta Bowl in the reviews I skimmed - it is adjoining this location.

Also, you cannot order Barnelli&#39;s items at the drive thru.

village-tavern-and-grill-schaumburg-2,Nick K.,iAZh2X2VFaQ6ONiu8CXjEg,Z5ax9joB1PKKjifIoEr--Q,"Well, ya kinda feel like Norm from Cheers when you come to this fine establishment.  Even the servers start to remember what you&#39;re drinking if you come around enough, and they are very friendly here.  The atmosphere is pretty chill, there are a bunch of TVs around in the dining area as well as the bar, so you can get your game watching/cheering on!  It can get pretty packed on game days/nights, but the wait is never really all that long.  They are hella high tech here with being able to text your phone directly when your table is ready, so in the meantime, you can grab a drink from the bar and start out with some liquid appetizers.  It tastes soooo good once it touches your lips.

Now let&#39;s get to the food action right here.  Many people go to the Village Tavern for their Chicken fingers.  These are pretty good actually... Their chicken fingers are deep fried in some proper batter.  I prefer these to be a little crunchy over softer ones, but this will fill you up for sure, and you&#39;ll probably need a box if you get it as a meal, because they are really filling.  You&#39;ll feel like a turkey on Thanksgiving after chowing down on these chicken fingers and french fries.  I don&#39;t often order these, but if you are suffering from a massive hangover, these bad boys might do the trick.

Now, where they really shine is on their burger game.  These are definitely on point!  I think at least half of the time I&#39;ve went to the Village Tavern, I ordered the Onion Bacon Cheese Burger.  Now this is a big juicy burger with a nice amount of cheese and they go wild with the bacon.  Big thick pieces piled up on top to go with the grilled onions...just toss on a little ketchup, and you will go into burger bliss. 

 Their fries are nicely seasoned and also have a nice crisp to it.  A lot of burger places have great burgers, but when it comes to their fries, it turns out to be absolute weak sauce.  Here at the VTG, the burgers and fries are top notch.  I usually order, a side Caesar Salad as well.  Even that is done up properly time after time.  It&#39;s pretty affordable too.  It goes great with a cold brew to say the least!

I&#39;ve never had the Nachorama, but that would be the next thing I&#39;d wanna try.  It looks like a mountain of nachos, if you order this be sure to bring a big crew in order to erode that massive pile down to a valley.  There&#39;s various sandwiches and other dinners as well.  I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here yet.  My buddy and I have came here a bunch after work, and it usually turns to be out on the cheaper side tab compared to other surrounding restaurants in the Schaumburg area..

It seems they never updated since they were established. It&#39;s all good, this place gets packed and they seem like a bunch of locals here. I dig it. 

So I give 4 stars for location (close to my crib), very affordable menu (they have like 10,000 items in their menu), fast and friendly service (although be careful, she gave a couple of suggestions that were totally off), and their batter (they fry everything here and they mastered the art of the batter--- so get everything in the menu that&#39;s deep fried)

Chips con queso: the chips are too hard for my liking and the queso dip was too runny and lacks taste. 

Chicken tortilla soup: sooooo good! Meaty, crunchy (tortilla chips), chunky, fresh taste, and has a sweet aftertaste because of the delicious veggies in it. 

Chicken tenders: wowwww MUST HAVE. The batter makes these tenders tasty, tender, and perfect crunch. Get the original. Although I liked the buffalo, I love the original with the honey mustard. 

Chili soup: it&#39;s ok. It&#39;s not as big of a deal like the server described it. They really pimp their chili though. It comes with green onions, onions, cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips, and of course the chili! 

Chicken parmigiana: I don&#39;t know why I ordered this... but I did so here it is: huge tasty chicken breast on top of fettuccine pasta, this needed more pasta sauce and that may have done the trick. But then again, why did I order this??? Unless you&#39;re feigning for a huge chunk of chicken breast with mozzarella and sauce on top, skip this. They have tons of items in their menu to choose from.

After all, it says so on their shirt! ;)

Growing up and going to high school in Schaumburg, everyone knows about the Village Tavern. It&#39;s a staple in the neighborhood. 
I used to visit VTG numerous times a month in my high-school days. I&#39;ve never left hungry and always left happy.

After a few years without visiting, (I moved to Arlington Heights) my friend decided to make tonight a throwback moment. We decided to make the somewhat far drive to check out an old favorite.

We went in around 6:30 and the place was PACKED! This is a normal be used everyone loves it. We put our name in the list and they put us in the app. The app allows you to see from your iPhone your estimated wait and how many parties are ahead of you. Great feature, very much appreciated.

After about ten minutes, we were seated and ordered an ice cold Blue Moon. Keep in mind, Schaumburg police/village require TWO FORMS OF I.D. to purchase and consume. I showed a insurance card and my drivers license with no problem. 

We enjoyed our beer while scanning thru the huge menu. There is something for everyone here. I decided to start with the baked French onion soup. We also each ordered the chicken finger appetizer. 

The soup was served piping hot with a heap of ooey-gooey cheese on top. Perfect, just how I like it. The soup was incredible with plenty of onions. 

Next, on to the world famous chicken fingers. They&#39;re world famous for a reason, nobody makes em&#39; like VTG. Crispy and light breading over juicy and tender chicken inside. They serve it with a super secret honey mustard sauce for dipping. The honey mustard MAKES AND ENHANCES the chicken tenders. No ketchup or ranch, stick to the honey mustard! They melt in your mouth and are best eaten piping hot where you are sure to scar the roof of your mouth. ;) 

The service here is superb. Even when swamped, they provide an excellent dining experience. The noise is a bit loud inside, but it&#39;s a causal, fun neighborhood spot. The owner knows what he&#39;s doing and doesn&#39;t need to change a thing!

Yesterday was my second visit to Village Tavern. My first visit was two years ago and their chicken fingers have been in my mind ever since. They are so crispy, tender and so juicy! They&#39;re also beer battered and don&#39;t taste like you&#39;re swallowing tablespoons of oil. Aaaaand they come with their homemade honey mustard that is perfect! 

My friend ordered the chicken burrito, I ordered the chicken finger plate and we had fried mushrooms to share. 

Food came out so quickly! My friend really enjoyed her burrito. I was in loooooove with my chicken finger plate! For about $10, you get a choice of a soup or salad (I chose the Chicken Rotini), vegetables upon request (steamed carrots and broccoli--perfectly seasoned and so fresh!), and a form of carb (fries, mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, or Spanish rice). 

The fried mushrooms ($6) were amazing as well! I never know whether the fried mushrooms I order elsewhere are fresh or frozen...but Village Tavern&#39;s are FOR SURE fresh. They use the same batter as their chicken fingers and they are perfectly seasoned, fresh, crispy, and amazing. I really hate paying money for an appetizer that I barely share with other people at my table. For $6, you can share for sure because they give you huge fried mushrooms and there are plenty to go around. 

My visit last night was superb thanks to our waitress, Caitlin. She was so attentive to our needs. Caitlin noticed that my friend and I were famished. She was so sweet and she put in our order to be rushed and made immediately. What a gem! She was always happy and filled our water/came to check on us at the most opportune times. I most definitely recommend her!

Village Tavern has delicious food, excellent service and seriously so much food for the money you pay. A must try!",12/08/15,239,5,3,5,55,9.055200000000001,5.312,0.483,23.206000000000007,No,1961

Ordered to go the other day and was left craving more. Their chicken fingers were still good and tasty but extra greasy, not like how it used to be. The wings were completely overcooked and dry, but SUPER spicy. The cucumber bruschetta was tasty but the bread that was served with it was burnt... 

The worst part was the Caesar salad, like how do you mess up a Caesar salad? It was bitter and the dressing was watery. The Parmesan and croutons were soggy and sad. Just disappointing and a waste of money.

We went here on a Monday, it was very crowded, and pretty loud for a weeknight.  I got a philly cheese beef sandwich, and shared an order of chicken fingers with my date.  The sandwich and side of fries was good, but as you might of guessed, the chicken fingers stole the show.  Very tender and deliciously breaded!  We ordered bbq and honey mustard sauce on the side, and they went great with both.  Seriously, if you go here and don&#39;t get the chicken fingers you are messing up big time.

They have a nice selection of beers and cocktails.  The food is also great and when I was on a diet, their low-cal options weren&#39;t that bad as well.  Most people come here for the chicken fingers which are outstanding.  The batter on the chicken fingers is what makes it taste great.

I couldn&#39;t believe it, but my doubting mind was quickly put to ease because the strips really are all that.

Now that we live closer, we came back last week before hitting up the mall. It was a Friday night and they were pretty busy, but we were able to sneak past everyone waiting for a table to steal the last 2 stools at the bar.  I wanted to see if the chicken strips were still good, so we ordered the signature strips with honey mustard, along with potato skins. I also ordered a Bomb Pop drink. The drink was cheap and strong, which is always a good thing. It looked just like a bomb pop too so the nostalgia of my childhood was in full force.

There were quite a few people coming in for carry-out orders and I found my purse, chair and elbows getting bumped quite a bit. It was all worth it though. When the food came out a few minutes later, it was piping hot. I loved the skins. They were incredibly cheesy and loaded with green onions. A full order was enough to bring half of them home for the next day.  The chicken fingers are still every bit as good as I remember. The batter is so thick and substantial. It&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d find at a fish fry--just on chicken instead of fish. The honey mustard is so good and will convert even non-mustard lovers. I actually took the tiny bit of mustard we had left home with me. 

Our bill was insanely reasonable too. For two appetizers and two drinks, we walked out spending $32. We later went to another bar and spent $26 on two drinks alone. 

Two different bartenders helped us out and they were both attentive and friendly with us and the other customers at the bar.

It was totally packed by the time we got there. I think they were saying the wait was 30 minutes for 2 people when we got there- which I wasn&#39;t expecting for a pub in the suburbs. Our group was 45 minutes late... but luckily the place was nice and seated the two of us immediately so we at least got to sit down for 45 minutes (although we felt very bad for taking up such a big table). But the server was nice and didn&#39;t say anything about it. The place was really big and had a ton of tables and seating. It was hard to find close parking.

I got the Parmesan Shoe Strings Cheese Burger with bleu cheese and on Rye Bread. To be honest, it was just O.K. It&#39;s not something I would get again. The fries were also just O.K. But for $8 it was not bad.

My hubby got the Onion Bacon Cheese Burger. He said it was okay. He did like his sweet potato fries though! They looked much more fresh than the regular fries. He also got a lil sumpin sumpin =).

I finished off my meal with the fried cheesecake egg rolls. Which these were to die for. The mix of cinnamon, vanilla ice cream and cheesecake wrapped in a flaky crust was so yummy.

Now after all the reviews, I already knew what I wanted. I needed a little bit of everything. Cheeseburger, Nachos and Chicken Fingers with their honey mustard sauce. You better believe we ordered all of that and split it.

Okay.. Let&#39;s start with the cheeseburger. WOW! They seasoned this to perfection. The taste was honestly unbelievable. I&#39;d easily gain 50lbs if I lived by here. They came with a side of fries. Usually bars have just regular fries and there&#39;s nothing special, however, these were awesome! Again, seasoned to perfection.. My mouth is watering while I&#39;m typing this; I may have a problem! lol

Nachos - Fully loaded. We only ordered a half order and that was enough for two people and to take some home, which I did ;) and ate them later!

I stopped in today right at open (11a), I was across the street getting my car detailed at Action Audio and Detail. Saw they were right there so I decided to spend my 2 hours here. BEST. DECISION. EVER. *** for today.

I was greeted and seated immediately when I came in. Awesome. The feel of this place is very home-y and comfortable, you feel very much part of a family when you walk in just because of the way the employees carry themselves. 

My server Lexi came over smiling and asked if she could help me out, I asked for coffee which was delivered immediately. Nice and hot. 

She helped me since it was my first time here with her menu knowledge making suggestions they were known for, but also making suggestions that weren&#39;t advertised all over the place. I ended up picking something I knew I would like but was also special to the house because it had the chicken fingers in it.

DELICIOUS! I loved my food. I didn&#39;t eat it all because the portions are abundant and I never finish a meal anyways; I brought it home for my hubby. I paid 13.03 for a big-ass wrap, and loaded cheese fries with bottomless coffee. I feel like my money went very very far today. 

I have never seen a pub/tavern fill for a Monday lunch, but let me tell you by the time noon rolled around this place was 80% full, even the bar. I bet you need to make reservations for the weekend or be prepared to wait a decent amount of time, but they also have a connection with No Wait which can help you with that. 

I have been in the food service industry for 13 years, I have done it all from serving, cooking, hosting, banquets and I have been managing now for the last 4 years. This place makes me want to come work for them, I truly enjoyed it this much. 

Lexi, you were awesome, friendly, attentive, and I couldn&#39;t have asked for better service. I haven&#39;t found service this good in a long long time (and the strange thing is I feel like I wasn&#39;t treated special, my server did not go above and beyond for me, but it appeared that she wanted to be at work, and that she WANTED to serve me and THAT makes all the difference in the world)

Don&#39;t let the exterior of Village Tavern deter you from stopping in for some good comfort food.  I came with my girlfriend for a late lunch on a Monday afternoon and we were pleasantly surprised.  Village Tavern seems like a cozy, neighborhood bar that would be packed with regulars on a daily basis.  It has an old school charm to it which I loved.  The food is priced well, tastes great, and portions are huge.  

I had the pot roast which comes with a soup or salad (I chose the beef tortilla soup) and sides of veggies and garlic mashed potatoes.  After I had the soup I was already halfway full since the portion was that hefty!  My entree itself could have fed two people and I was able to only eat about a third of it.  The mashed potatoes were garlicy and delicious, pot roast was tender and flavorful, and the veggies were probably from a frozen bag.  My friend ordered the chicken burrito and the description of the burrito did not lie.  They called it ginormous and that it was.  She was only able to eat half of it and was super stuffed afterwards.

We definitely want to come back and check it out for happy hour with friends (mainly so we can try out more food on the menu since there were a TON of yummy sounding things).  Until then Village Tavern!",29/04/14,142,4,3,5,54,5.8801000000000005,2.904,0.362,11.733999999999998,No,1304

Taste was okay.   Sort of bland.  Nachos were soggy and we were there when they were brought out from the kitchen.   The nachos while piled high with stuff but just lacked flavor.  They were skimpy with the cheese and sour cream.  

The Chicken Burrito Grande was good.  It tasted fresh.  I had to add Tobasco Sauce to jazz up the flavor.

The pulled pork&#39;s barbeque sauce was so so but I like Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s the best and my own second.  The pulled pork sandwich was average, nothing special.

Service was good.  People were friendly and efficient.

VTG earns a solid rating based largely on the strength of its chicken fingers and generally good service.  (And in full disclosure, I&#39;ve only gotten the chicken fingers here.)  The chicken fingers are covered with a light yet crispy batter that does not overwhelm the chicken meat.  The pieces are pretty big so you&#39;ll definitely get your fill.  Plus, VTG does not mess around with that honey mustard; it&#39;s the perfect dipping sauce for that chicken!

Piled high with plenty o&#39;meat and fillings, this sandwich is big enough for two meals and comes with a trough sized portion of fries (get the sweet potato variety if you steer that way).

First, they do pub food perfectly.The chicken fingers are world famous-or so it says on the wall, the menu, and the t-shirts they sell. They may not be world famous, but they should be. if you only have one item here order the chicken fingers. The burgers are also good,as are the fish and chips and the nachos are superior. The daily specials pretty much rock as well. The second awesomeness is this is the best place to watch chicago sports. Both the staff at the bar and the other locals are very, shall we say enthusiastically interactive.  If you do not want zestful enthusiasm on game day, avoid the bar. You can still enjoy the game from a booth. This is a family neighborhood  type pub so children of all ages will be present, except at the bar area, which is where you should be if you are serious about drinking.  
Be advised that during peak times-such as friday/saturday nights around dinnertime, this place is super busy. Parking is plentiful but since the parking lot is shared with other businesses parking can be a little tricky. there can be a wait to be seated as well, and the table service especially as regards drinks can be slower then you might like. Outside of the dinner/lunch  rush hours these conditions do not apply. So there&#39;ll be plenty of room when the game starts at 7:00 pm or so.

The meat itself was very juicy and tender, and the batter itself was delicious, nice and crunchy without being too greasy either.  We also ordered the nachos which was insanely gigantic, as the 4 of us couldn&#39;t finish!

My husband ordered the chicken fried steak - chicken was flavorful, but the mashed potatoes were average, and the carrots were bland.  We also ordered the brownie was the pretzel crust --overly sweet for my taste, but if I come back during that time of the month, I just may crave it =p.

More than anything, I can&#39;t wait to go back for those chicken tenders again!",17/04/14,82,4,2,3,21,2.0397000000000003,0.838,0.0,6.162,No,703

village-tavern-and-grill-schaumburg-2,Rick H.,Sy6Uwey7gRoH2jaNUzyT4w,bGxRVioLrfxNwSiFV0ie8w,"I like hot dogs...and chicken fingers.
There, I said it.

And now with a cleansed soul, and a renewed vision, I&#39;m able to focus a little clearer, staying a tad sharper while wading through numerous options found in bar menus.

I&#39;m on a mission. A mission, to find that ultimate hot dog and chicken finger joint.

First stop...right here in the suburbs of Chicago, home of the &#34;World Famous&#34; Chicken Fingers. 

We came here because Chicago was having a trifecta of sporting events, The Blackhawks and The Bulls were still in the playoffs and the Cubs were playing the Rockies, all on the same night. It just so happens we stroll into a local tavern boasting about the Chicken Fingers.

As promised, I scanned the menu, for only two options- Chicken Fingers and a Hot Dog.

Now, when the menu, your cute server, the napkins, the T-shirts, the plane pulling a banner, the local crowd, all brag about these incredible Fingers...you order tem. Did I mention the cute server?

Done.

Now, is there a hot dog to sample? Perhaps a fine Chicago Dog, with that crazy fluorescent green relish. Let&#39;s see...Cuban sandwich, Italian Grinder, what a cute server, focus Rick, a Reuben, Philly Chees... whoa! What the hell?

A Fenway Dog, in the heart of Chicago? What would Abe Froman (Ferris Bueller reference) the sausage king of Chicago think about this...right in his own back yard?

Yes, I have to have it. It must be good. 

Perhaps I gather a second opinion. 

Yep, verified by cute server number 1, well sort of, (turns out, she&#39;s a vegetarian), but she brings over cute server number 2.

&#34;What do you think, only a great dog from Boston, would survive this long in a Chicago Sports Bar. Don&#39;t be a knucklehead, get It.&#34;  - Cute Server Number 2

First, the Chicken Fingers are incredible. I mean magical. I can&#39;t describe how delicious they are, the outside golden flakey batter melts in your mouth, the moist and flavorful skin creates this pocket of perfection, like a breezeway locking in the juices and not allowing the humidity or steam to escape, making the white tender chicken breast inside more moist than The Golden Girls on a double dose of estrogen and progesterone therapy. It&#39;s Colonel Sanders meets H. Salt Esquire Fish-n-Chips. A must!

Next up, the Fenway dog. It&#39;s big. A 1/4 pound dog wrapped in a New England Roll, topped with mustard, relish and onions. I say wrapped, because the steam makes the roll encase the hot dog, forming perfectly to your own hand. The snap of the dog is crisp, I love the fact there is no ketchup in sight and the onions add, not detract, from the beefy flavor. The roll is the same as they use in making New England Lobster rolls, with high sides (to keep the dog corralled) and oozing with egg and butter flavors. It&#39;s soft and tender and at first glance, looks like they cheated you with a heel of Wonder Bread. 

Seriously, if you are in Schaumburg, Chicago you have to find this place...if not for the great food, sports, or incredible service...Do it for the cute servers.",22/05/13,404,5,4,5,104,6.114000000000001,4.2700000000000005,1.3159999999999998,31.41400000000001,No,3070

With that in mind I will try again and take the kids for dinner one night and see what they think and update accordingly :-) 

Not a food review. Just stopped with a friend for a beer at the bar after work. Typical local pub type place. Didn&#39;t get food but looked like decent super unhealthy type bar food. Think huge portions nachos, chicken fingers, and french fries. Restaurant full of families and kids sports teams. Place is worn, loud, and dark inside. About what you would expect. Very popular with the locals so you are better off doing carry out for food Fri/Sat night. Bar is full of regulars. After work bros and a lot of old men who look like they never leave. A real sausage fest. Bartenders basically ignore you if not a regular and begrudgingly serve you eventually. It is what it is. If your expectations are set correctly going in, it is just ok.

village-tavern-and-grill-schaumburg-2,Jo R.,9rCgWpYsxAt2cTa6ne8eEA,vKpqOtA2ELq_6K1jlV7Iug,"As you can see from the numerous photographs, Village Tavern and Grill is known for its fantastic nachos and chicken fingers. In fact, the chicken fingers apparently put Village Tavern on the map. The restaurant was featured on a program called &#34;Chicago&#39;s Best&#34; because of them. On a recent Monday afternoon, I decided to investigate the hype. 

My meal began with a half order of the famed Nachorama. As you can see in the photographs, loads of cheese, black olives, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and beans are piled high on the chips. After ordering nachos in other restaurants, I can tell you no other nachos have measured up to Village Tavern&#39;s. The Nachorama contains all the ingredients you want covering your chips, in abundance. The cheese was thick, gooey, and held everything in place. The chips were tucked throughout the dish. 

After consuming the nacho bomb, I was somewhat full. However, I still had to try the chicken finger platter. The platter consists of six huge, tender, chicken pieces in a crispy batter. Hands down these were the best chicken fingers I have ever had. The batter was non-greasy and the chicken pieces were high quality. What added to this amazing dish was the honey mustard dipping sauce. Both the honey and mustard flavors came through strongly. 

In addition to excellent food, I must commend the attentive waitstaff. The waitresses paced our meal perfectly. As soon as we finished the nachos, the entrees came right out--not a moment too soon. At the end of our meal, everyone needed boxes to bring home leftovers. The waitresses promptly brought out boxes and a large bag for us to take our food home. They even brought me an extra cup of that outstanding honey mustard dipping sauce. The waitstaff was pleasant and responded well to our table, without hovering. I assume they must have good management here. 

Visit Village Tavern on an empty stomach so you can fill up on the amazing grub. This is a great neighborhood place.",09/01/13,237,4,3,5,86,6.578500000000001,4.015,0.521,22.464,No,1986
village-tavern-and-grill-schaumburg-2,Rose D.,FqHNMGc_-BgX4svll0SwLg,b0-qpvRNCJIiflLITMj2-g,"They have a big menu &amp; it&#39;s obvious this place is popular by how packed it was.  It&#39;s been around a long time and it was filled with couples, small groups, families with young children and families with several generations.  Because of how packed it was the service wasn&#39;t attentive, but the food came out fast.  It was also pretty noisy in there...but with &#34;tavern&#34; in the name I wouldn&#39;t expect less.

They have an all-you-can-eat fish fry on Fridays.  We had the chicken strip dinner which was an amazing deal - it came with a crock of soup (even French Onion!), 6 HUGE freshly beer-battered chicken strips, a big cup of honey mustard &amp; a mound of French Fries (you have your choice of potato).  It was enough to feed 3 people!  The fries were perfectly cooked and the chicken strips were the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Two of our friends always order the nachos here to share and OH MY GOODNESS - it was a platter ridiculously MOUNDED with nachos.  It was enough to feed 10 people as a snack or 5 as a meal, in my opinion - so consider yourself warned.

I&#39;m not a smoker &amp; don&#39;t endorse smoking, but if you are an e-cig user be aware...the manager came over and asked our friend who was using her e-cig to please stop using it.  I know businesses have the right to decide if they can be used inside or not and this place has chosen to NOT allow them.

village-tavern-and-grill-schaumburg-2,Tim H.,zCASNH25GTirvxqtmzuVVw,AaM78fro81cRuTmJFN3NJQ,"Wowie wow wow... I just love this place. It may be known for the chicken fingers but the great homemade daily specials and staff is what makes this place shine! They&#39;re celebrating their 20th anniversary this year too!

I first learned of VTG when I lived in Carol Stream some 14 years ago. I had never been to this location before seeing them featured on Chicago&#39;s Best TV and then attending a fund raiser for Autism Speaks, here in Schaumburg. That was all it took for me to make the journey here time and time again. The chicken finger salad was my first meal here, loved it. I finished it with the fried cheesecake egg roll desert and have tried the daily specials the rest of my visits. 

My latest experience was this past Mandy-tory Monday, for the filming of Nachorama. (for a feature on WGN morning news, by Marcus Leshock for National Nacho Day) I had the chicken pot pie and black bean soup for lunch. Now the soup would have made a great meal all on it&#39;s own, then you top it off with the best pot pie you&#39;ve ever had. The huge chunks of white meat, the fresh potatoes and vegetable and  then a cracker thin flaky crust, set this dish apart from the rest. I took Mandy, the bartender&#39;s advise and splashed a little Cholula on top of the pot pie. The second half of the dish tasted just as good later that evening. I love that they serve fresh brewed tea.

I know I sampled the Nachorama (2#&#39;s of nacho&#39;s covered in their award wining chili) my first visit here, as there was some friends that had eyes bigger than their bellies. I also made it here for Tuesdays Mom&#39;s Meatloaf and it&#39;s exceptional. I so want to make it back out for their Saturday Rib diner special and I have plans to attend their event for &#34;Operation Christmas Child&#34;, the event is on the 17th of this month. Check it out on their facebook page and plan on bringing in a shoe box of gifts for a needy child. 

The owner J.R. does so much for his community and is so treasured by his employees... such a rare find. Free WiFi is also a plus! They have a great blog too, that keeps you up to date on all their drink and meal deals. And when it comes to sports.... they have more TV&#39;s than you would expect.

Not because it was bad, on the contrary, it was excellent and more than most could finish at a single sitting. What was wrong was I started to see plates of their signature french toast, grits, waffles and corned beef hash. I vowed to come back.

The following Sunday, when the wife said she wanted to go to breakfast, I seized on the opportunity. When we got there, I thought there would be a wait as there was a serious crowd. We were told about 20 mins. We noticed they had an app called The List that let us track where we were in line. The wait ended up being only about 10 mins. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive, willing to answer any and all questions as well as make suggestions. 

DANG! The french toast, made out of french bread mind you, is unbelievable. Wife had the stuffed pumpkin pancakes with cream cheese filling fused with orange. I started having regrets again when i tried it. The grits are plentiful and great tasting.

My complaints are minimal, but worth mentioning, I think. There&#39;s a $0.75 up charge for cheese in a veggie omelette! And of course the standard up charge for GF pancakes, which I never understand, especially since it&#39;s the only GF bread they have. I opted for double sides instead.

burnt-toast-elgin-3,Natalie K.,FkibF2i1heI-CE4OZi00IA,QhIHz6Z39M-He-Q68zbhkQ,"I wanted to update my review since in the past two years I&#39;ve become a regular and have tried 90% of their menu items.

Firstly, the restaurant is typically busy on a daily basis. During the week there is never usually a wait, but early mornings/afternoons on the weekend there is sometimes a short wait (I never had to wait for more than 20 minutes). It&#39;s a cozy and very friendly environment, although when it&#39;s busy, it can be quite loud. From the hosts to the servers, we are always treated like family and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been to a restaurant/diner with better staff. Not one negative experience ever. Service is always above par, and I&#39;m never left with a coffee or drink that is less than half full. You can tell that it&#39;s a positive working environment as the servers are always helping each other out (great team work). 

The coffee is good. They have their own special blend created for their restaurant. It&#39;s a light, mild roast, which my husband absolutely loves, but it&#39;s not really my favorite. (This is completely a preference-based thing, but I&#39;m a coffee snob, and I like bolder coffee.) It is always hot and fresh though. 

Their daily soups are all great. A couple of my favorites are the stuffed pepper and cream based selections (especially the Sunday cream of chicken). Highly recommend. 

As far as the food, it&#39;s pretty consistent. The eggs are good quality and are fresh, and the hash browns are shredded and crisp - never greasy. The skillets are excellent. My favorite is the veggie skillet.

They also have good bacon, so whether you get it mixed in with your eggs, on the side or in a BLT, or club, it will be good. It&#39;s slightly thick with a good crisp. 

The pancakes are amazing, and something I think this restaurant excels in. The classic pancakes are really light, fluffy and cakey. They also have multi-grain, which are far better than most restaurants whole wheat/multigrain cakes. The crunch cakes are sooo good (oats, pecans and dried cranberries in the batter). Also their seasonal pumpkin pancakes are another favorite of mine. The French toast and waffles are also very good and would recommend. 

Also, it&#39;s hard to find good gyros in the area, and I have to say that Burnt Toast has some of the best gyros. It&#39;s good quality and always has a nice crisp - no soggy gyros here! They also have a great philly steak with good quality sliced sirloin. Also, if you have a taste for steak, the ribeye is very flavorful and thin.

They have a small menu for lunch, including a nice selection of salads. When I want to up my veggie intake, I like getting the spinach chicken salad which is LOADED with baby spinach. My only qualm is the salad dressings. They are all boring flavored, pre-made dressings and taste like it too. A suggestion to BT would be to PLEASE whip up your own salad dressings!! They would make the salads much more enjoyable! 

I also kind of wish that I loved their crepes more. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they are good, but, crepes are one of my favorite breakfast foods. I&#39;ve tried them around 3-5 times and I feel like they are missing a little something. The crepes are very thin and delicate with a slight crisp, which is great! They are always cooked perfectly! They aren&#39;t sloppy or too eggy tasting like some diners. The batter would easily mix well with savory crepe dishes (would go good with chicken, etc, than a sweet dessert crepe that goes good with fruit preserves) and when I want fruit crepes, I&#39;m always wishing that they would toss a little more sugar or vanilla in the batter. I guess you can say that I like my crepes sweet, and these aren&#39;t.

I recently had the turkey club with avocado on multi-grain bread. OMG, delish! You really can&#39;t screw up a turkey club. Bacon is perfect. I&#39;m not a big fan of the thick cut bacon so I just asked for the regular bacon; which they gladly gave me. 

Usually I have a breakfast skillet (Denver). It comes with so much food. I never can finish. As a matter of fact, I could probably share it with one of my children. Back to the food, it comes with hash browns, toast or pancakes, and a very big helping of eggs. Sheesh!  

Food is fresh, service is good, coffee is always a bit bitter but nothing a little extra cream can&#39;t fix. Price isn&#39;t too bad either. 

I&#39;m craving Burnt Toast for this weekend. It&#39;s so on! Anyone care to join me??",11/05/16,120,4,1,4,-3,3.9484,3.5570000000000004,0.259,15.184999999999999,No,889

As soon as we walk in, we were greeted with friendly faces. We were seated right away. Place was pretty packed. 

We were greeted by our server Alyssa. She was very friendly and helpful. 

For drinks Brie ordered pumpkin spice latte. She said it&#39;s ok. I think because there was a bit too much cinnamon for her.  I ordered the hazelnut cappuccino. Mine was very good. Not too sweet and I love the foam on top. 

For breakfast, brie ordered the Cornbeef hash skillet with sunny side up eggs. She loved it. She said it&#39;s better than another restaurant she goes to. Portion is huge so she only ate half.

I ordered the veggie skillet with turkey sausage added and because I wanted to try the pumpkin spice pancake. My meal was delicious. My eggs were cooked just right.  Now for the pumpkin pancakes. They were delish but I didn&#39;t put any syrup since it was already sweet for my taste. I like my pancakes a bit in the crispy side so it could have been cooked a bit more. Again, portions are huge so I only ate half of my pancakes and skillet.

I had a feeling I&#39;d be a fan when they seated me even though my party was incomplete--even on a busy Saturday morning.  So nice that I could sit down immeidately and have a cup of coffee. The coffee is delicious by the way. Service was friendly and sunny throughout the whole experience. Our server had to be reminded a couple of time for some things--but they were busy and she was so apologetic that it really didn&#39;t put a damper on our experience. 

I opted for their breakfast burrito. Scrambled eggs, chorizo, peppers and cheese in aflour tortilla..  I love a little spice and this had a nice flavor and was made well.  My son&#39;s pancakes looked good as did my friend&#39;s meal (I can&#39;t remember what she had...sorry night shift brain).

The menu as the usual supsects--eggs, skillets, french toast, pancakes and crepes, but some of them do stand out.  Like the Grand Marnier french toast and some creative omelet dishes. I spied Mimosa&#39;s and a few different flavors of fruit juice which add some interest as well.

Four stars because the parking situation is a mess. There are not enough spots to accomodate this place and the pizzeria next door. Worse, there isn&#39;t really an alternative place to park when the lot is full.

I love ordering French toast because I never make it at home. Here are Burnt Toast&#39;s delectable ways to appreciate their &#34;famous&#34; House Specialty:

Their plain French toast is freshly baked French bread, cut thick and topped with organic Indonesian cinnamon sugar. Add Strawberries for $1.00. 

Their Grand Marnier French toast is baked French bread, dipped in Grand Marnier batter then topped with Grand Marnier sauce, sauted bananas, pecans and cinnamon sugar. You may substitute French bread with Banana Nut bread.

Four stars because I cannot drink their coffee. It has too much caffeine. It requires a lot of sugar and cream. It&#39;s so strong, it gives me anxiety.",29/08/14,133,4,2,3,26,2.3726999999999996,2.133,0.68,12.187000000000001,No,1070

Our order took a while to come out (to be expected on a busy day), but it did not come out all together. We waited about 5 minutes for the remaining 2 orders to come out and they didn&#39;t. We finally started eating in front of our family members who were still waiting for their food so our food wouldn&#39;t get completely cold. One order came out about 10 minutes after our food came out and the last order came out almost 15-20 minutes later. Three of us had finished eating before the final order of our table came out.

Not only that, he refused to take the last order off of our bill. $150 later and he refused to take off the $8 order of crepes that took forever to get to our table.
When we went to pay our bill we explained what happened to the manager and she rudely informed us that it was mother&#39;s day (my mom and I, both Mothers , who were well aware of what day it was) argued that that wasn&#39;t an excuse for poorly managing the situation.

Also something different...the strawberry orange juice! Oh, so good!!! I could probably drink that every day if I could, it was awesome!!!

Three of us ordered omelets, one ordered crepes and another ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. One of the omelets was the French style with spinach, sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese. It was dry and flavorless with far too much goat cheese inside and on top. I love goat cheese but it was way too much. I had Canadian bacon on the side which was as dry as shoe leather. Another omelet was the Seafood omelet which was also dry with far too little seafood and far too much cheese. The other omelet was the Spinach and Gruyere. Again, dry and not much flavor. The hash browns were not crispy brown or anything special. The corned beef hash was a flat serving, very crispy and hard and not moist. The crepes were good according to my family member who ordered them. 

Needless to say, we were very disappointed with the food, especially given the prices. We remember much better food a few years ago. May try for lunch as the lunch food coming out looked quite good.

They open fairly early (6:30am) and serve breakfast through close (at 2pm -- my biggest complaint about the whole operation). They also serve lunch at ... er ... lunch time, but I confess I&#39;ve never ordered lunch there. 

My go-to item, morning or midday, is the egg white veggie omelet with fruit and pancakes. Under $10, and it&#39;s easily 2 meals. And healthy! They also have ridiculous more-dessert-than-breakfast stuff on the menu that you have to try -- such as banana split pancakes, stuffed french toast, etc. Their skillets are amazing and their french toast should be renamed divine french loaf, for the two fold reason that it&#39;s *incredible* and *huge*!

Our order took a while to come out (to be expected on a busy day), but it did not come out all together. We waited about 5 minutes for the remaining 2 orders to come out and they didn&#39;t. We finally started eating in front of our family members who were still waiting for their food so our food wouldn&#39;t get completely cold. One order came out about 10 minutes after our food came out and the last order came out almost 15-20 minutes later. Three of us had finished eating before the final order of our table came out. 

Our server was very apologetic, but the owner, who we finally spoke to after 15 min of waiting said he would &#39;take care of it&#39; and we never saw him again. Not only that, he refused to take the last order off of our bill. $150 later and he refused to take off the $8 order of crepes that took forever to get to our table.
When we went to pay our bill we explained what happened to the manager and she rudely informed us that it was mother&#39;s day (my mom and I, both Mothers , who were well aware of what day it was) argued that that wasn&#39;t an excuse for poorly managing the situation.

Not that I&#39;d take her advice on anything, but the name of this place kind of drew me in and I was curious to try it...especially after checking out the menu online.

While driving through the area, I told my mom we needed to stop for breakfast because I wanted to try this place, I&#39;m REALLY glad I did!!! The menu is amazing!!! I went over and over and over it and had no idea what I wanted because I wanted to try everything!!! Then I looked at the specials and pumpkin pancakes looked intriguing for a while now, and tis the season for pumpkin everything, so I got the stuffed pumpkin pancakes.  My mom ordered an omelet, but pretty much changed up the omelet entirely from what it was on the menu.  These things were amazing!!!!  - The stuffed pumpkin pancakes, that is.  SO SO GOOD!!!! I posted a picture in here so you can get an idea of what I&#39;m talking about.

Also something different...the strawberry orange juice! Oh, so good!!! I could probably drink that every day if I could, it was awesome!!!

Three of us ordered omelets, one ordered crepes and another ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. One of the omelets was the French style with spinach, sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese. It was dry and flavorless with far too much goat cheese inside and on top. I love goat cheese but it was way too much. I had Canadian bacon on the side which was as dry as shoe leather. Another omelet was the Seafood omelet which was also dry with far too little seafood and far too much cheese. The other omelet was the Spinach and Gruyere. Again, dry and not much flavor. The hash browns were not crispy brown or anything special. The corned beef hash was a flat serving, very crispy and hard and not moist. The crepes were good according to my family member who ordered them. 

Needless to say, we were very disappointed with the food, especially given the prices. We remember much better food a few years ago. May try for lunch as the lunch food coming out looked quite good. 

However, our waitress was very friendly, efficient, attentive and very patient with my mother. We tipped her well.

They open fairly early (6:30am) and serve breakfast through close (at 2pm -- my biggest complaint about the whole operation). They also serve lunch at ... er ... lunch time, but I confess I&#39;ve never ordered lunch there. 

My go-to item, morning or midday, is the egg white veggie omelet with fruit and pancakes. Under $10, and it&#39;s easily 2 meals. And healthy! They also have ridiculous more-dessert-than-breakfast stuff on the menu that you have to try -- such as banana split pancakes, stuffed french toast, etc. Their skillets are amazing and their french toast should be renamed divine french loaf, for the two fold reason that it&#39;s *incredible* and *huge*! No normal human being finishes a large order.

They have delicious fresh squeezed juices, but the juice is pricey, so beware.

I think I was really just intrigued by the name!

The boy and I both got the same thing (I think for the first time ever).  The Country Fried Steak n Eggs... We agreed the steak part was pretty good!  Not overly done with the breading so you could really taste the steak with was tender.  Well seasoned and not over cooked.  

The gravy was just ok.  I typically judge breakfast places on their gravy since I grew up on biscuit and sausage gravy!  I was a little disappointed there.

They did a decent job with my over easy eggs and his scramble with cheese.  The hash browns were ok, they could have been seasoned better and cooked a little longer.  

The service was good.  We hung out a little longer than normal so we could catch up.  Overall, I felt it was a normal breakfast / lunch place.  The name didn&#39;t make it anything special unfortunately! ;)",01/06/14,132,3,2,4,11,3.2484,3.192,0.694,14.115,No,1144

I loved the fact that they had different types of orange juice, too. I had pomegranate-orange juice myself and it was wonderful.

I ordered the combo 2 (2 French toast slices (with strawberries and whipped cream), 2 eggs, 2 bacon slices). The bf got the country fried steak and eggs.
The French toast was so good! It&#39;s definitely &#34;meatier&#34; and had a really nice homemade taste to it. The bacon was thick and chewy (not a huge fan because I like my bacon crispy). The eggs were standard.
The only fault I can find with my meal was the syrup. I prefer to have warm syrup, whereas burnt toast serves it a little lukewarm/cooler.

Order eggs and bacon, which you would think could not be screwed up, wrong. The bacon came out so cripsy, it looked like it was days old. It was cold, and I even hit it with my fork and it make quite the noise. I would not even feed that to my dog, not even close to being edible. So I asked my server to swap it out for some fresh bacon. He didn&#39;t seem very happy about it, and when he came back with the new bacon, he made me give him back the old burnt pieces. Why? Are you going to serve that to another patron? Or do you think I&#39;m lying and I just wanted two orders of bacon? I just find that unsanitary and we&#39;ll rude.

Overall my dining experience  was not very good. The food is greasy. The costumer service is fair at best. The prices, way too high, to substitute gluten free pancakes for regular ones, $3... And a children&#39;s drink is not even included in a meal?

Order eggs and bacon, which you would think could not be screwed up, wrong. The bacon came out so cripsy, it looked like it was days old. It was cold, and I even hit it with my fork and it make quite the noise. I would not even feed that to my dog, not even close to being edible. So I asked my server to swap it out for some fresh bacon. He didn&#39;t seem very happy about it, and when he came back with the new bacon, he made me give him back the old burnt pieces. Why? Are you going to serve that to another patron? Or do you think I&#39;m lying and I just wanted two orders of bacon? I just find that unsanitary and we&#39;ll rude.

Overall my dining experience  was not very good. The food is greasy. The costumer service is fair at best. The prices, way too high, to substitute gluten free pancakes for regular ones, $3... And a children&#39;s drink is not even included in a meal?

It was a Monday morning at 9am.  My friend and I were seated in the middle section right away, which was nice.  And then we waited...and waited...and waited... We had already picked out what we wanted, how we wanted it, what sides to get, and we might have solved the problem of global warming (yes, we were waiting that long) had my friend not flagged down a different waitress serving the next table.  

Long story short, she was our waitress and she didn&#39;t know we were in her section.  She said she didn&#39;t see us.  Which is strange because we made solid eye contact four times before she was stopped.

Both times I have visited this establishment there was confusion at the hostess stand. Partially because the other parties ahead of my group seem to think everyone should read their minds... No sir- I did not realize asking if you were in line would cause you so much discomfort and stress.

That being said, once you get to your table things should be an easy journey. Service both times was prompt and friendly. There is a pretty vast menu with surprisingly healthy options amongst the comfort foods of breakfast. I&#39;ve enjoyed the eggs Benedict and the veggie omelette. Ask for your potatoes well done and you&#39;ll get crispy potato goodness. You can get omelettes done with just egg whites. The bread and side options are vast.

It&#39;s our favorite breakfast spot hands down. However, an incident happened last weekend, in which we will never return to the Randall rd location again. In particular, the manager, Veronica, made it a nightmare of an experience. 
When we arrived, we put our name in at the hostess stand as usual. When our name got called, we were making our way to the hostess stand while 2 members of our party were just arriving and finding a parking spot.  By the way, if your full party is not there, they will not seat you. Completely understand and get that. BUT, the hostess sat us, clearly seating 4 out of 6 in our party.  She didn&#39;t say anything to us about the rest of our party.  
We sat down and starting viewing the menu. Next thing we know, the manager, Veronica, came over to our table. She approached us by stating they only seat complete parties and its not fair to other guests. She then asked us the get up from our table and make our way back to the front.  I thought this was absolutely insulting.  I informed her to take it up with her hostess because she sat us, clearly seeing there were 4 out of 6 of us. I told her that its their error not ours, and we were not getting up.  After she continued to argue with us, the other 2 people in our party showed up.  She finally went away from our table after arguing for quite some time. 
Side note, we had a wonderful breakfast and the food was awesome as usual!
Afterwards, we were getting ready to leave, and Veronica came back to the table to argue her point AGAIN!  This is when we told her that it was ridiculous to ask guests to leave a table they&#39;ve already been sat at. She kept saying, &#34;you won&#39;t see it from my side.&#34;  We said that&#39;s fine, we just won&#39;t come back here. In which she replied, &#34;no problem.&#34;  
Needless to say, we will never return to the Randall rd Burnt Toast again because of how rude and uncalled for the manager, Veronica, treated us.  Horrible customer service!",05/07/13,230,1,1,2,-33,1.5989,2.555,2.476,21.97,No,2066

The strawberry orange juice:  Ri-goddam-diculously amazing.  So sweet, slightly tart, the perfect marriage of orange and strawberry with just enough seeds to know it&#39;s legit fresh SOJ.
The mocha latte:  large shallow cup, thick layer of perfect foam and a chocolate drizzle?  O yeaaa.  The latte itself wasn&#39;t the greatest ever, I would have preferred it a little stronger and a little less sweet..but that&#39;s what I get for ordering the caffeinated version of hot chocolate.
The strawberry stuffed French toast:  Is this real life?  It appeared before me, like some type of sugary panini..two thick layers of perfectly browned toast, piled high with a mountain of whipped cream littered with strawberries in syrup and filled generously with cream cheese.  To die for.  I could never eat this for a meal, but my bf sho did and when I took a bite I was instantly jealous of his sweets eating capabilities.
The seafood omelet:  Admittedly a borderline idiotic choice.  It sounded kind of interesting and not incredibly unhealthy so I went for it.  An interesting blend of shrimp, scallops, crab meat, cheese, and onions...I&#39;m still not really sure what I thought.  I guess it was a weird combination and I&#39;ve never seen anything like that offered so I figured why not try it.  It was decent but I&#39;d probably order something else when I return.
The hash browns:  crispy on top and thinly laid across the plate, just how I like it.  No heaping piles of browned top with undercooked mounds of potatoes just beneath to be seen @ BT.  A smaller portion than most other breakfast joints, but no complaints. I&#39;d rather have a smaller portion of quality than a big pile o sh*t (IHOP).
The pancakes:  pretty good.  Not that most amazing ever, but I&#39;m not much of a pancake gal as it is, so I was satisfied.  They give you three as a side which was more than enough.  I had a few bites and that was good enough for me.
The garbage potatoes:  Looked phenom but I didn&#39;t have any.  It&#39;s basically a skillet full of hash browns loaded with onions, green peppers, diced ham and topped with cheese.  Since I don&#39;t eat ham and I was on the verge of becoming one due to the consumption of the aforementioned food/drinks, I didn&#39;t even attempt a bite.  My bf really liked them however.
Our server was nice.  We got there @ about 1:40, and they close at 2:30 so at first I felt she was kiiinda trying to rush us but I quickly told her we had never been there and I had some dietary restrictions so just gimme a minute and she def did.  By the time she returned we had decided and we got along for the remainder of the meal.  
I will def return, perhaps when I&#39;m in the mood for something sweet because by judging my bf&#39;s French toast and some of the other dishes I saw come out of the kitchen, those seem to be their specialty.

burnt-toast-elgin-3,Thomas L.,qNmcbY0f-pJNGY0Gx3Ss-A,c30a_cGH15c0d3RQZ4p9fw,"I had the Biscuits and Gravy with two poached eggs.  The poached eggs were alright.  The Biscuits and Gravy, the main part of the meal, left  a lot to be desired.  

- The biscuits were stale, and hard to cut.
- The gravy was flavorless, and was basically country gravy without any flavor and just a few pieces of sausage thrown in.
- The coffee was disreputable.   IMHO, if I go to a &#34;breakfast&#34; restaurant I expect to have a cup of coffee that taste like a cup of coffee and not &#34;brown dishwater&#34;.  I don&#39;t expect it to be Starbucks strength, but seriously it shouldn&#39;t look like tea either.

The only place I&#39;ve found around here that really understands that Biscuits and Gravy is supposed to be a &#34;Sausage Gravy&#34; and not a &#34;Country Gravy&#34; is the The Olympic in Crystal Lake.

My definitions:

Sausage Gravy: you start with the white gravy base used for a country gravy, but then you season and cook it with ground up breakfast sausage.  It should end up with a light brown coloring from the sausage.

Country Gravy: start with a basic white gravy base and add salt and pepper to taste.  Yes, it should taste like something, hence the salt and pepper.  It should not taste bland and boring.

Makes me wonder if the burnt toast is any good?",16/12/11,146,2,2,1,35,0.8974,1.2910000000000001,0.896,12.814000000000002,No,1286

There seems to always be a wait at Burnt Toast Elgin, even if just 10 minutes, which is how long the two of us waited before being seated. The place is popular, and busy, which is noticeable not only by the noise level or crowded tables, but by the amount of food on the floor. Our booth had everything from crushed cereal to cutlery and chunks of toast under it when we were seated. I asked for it to be swept and it was done immediately. Our waitress greeted us right away offering coffee and juice, giving us as much time as we needed to order without being rushed (instead asking if she could bring us ice water while we read over the menu some more). I enjoyed that detail to start the meal off, no one likes to be pushed around when out for Sunday Brunch. 

 I ordered the Combo #1 (2 eggs, ham &amp; 2 slices of French Toast), my husband ordered Combo #2 (the same as above except with bacon instead of ham). I asked for eggs over medium, he ordered over easy &amp; we both drank plain coffee.
Our meals came out in a reasonable amount of time, the French Toast topped with a generous amount of cinnamon sugar and the eggs sunny side up. 
Up next, a test of egg cooking skill... over easy vs over medium is a fine line with an egg! I know, I absolutely LOVE eggs and know how to cook them well. This test was FAILED however. Both orders came out with yokes as runny as a nose (hungry now?), which I can handle, but isn&#39;t what I ordered. I don&#39;t send eggs back unless they are health code violation  raw, so that was that. 
The bacon was cooked perfectly, not floppy and not burnt, just crisp and medium to thick cut. The ham was pan seared and tender, just the way it should be. No complaints there. 
The French Toast is served thick cut from fluffy loaves of bread, which looks beautiful plated. The taste was good, but I couldn&#39;t get over how dry it was. It is lightly battered in egg, so the thick slices don&#39;t absorb the egg mixture. It didn&#39;t appear to have been buttered before topped with the cinnamon sugar, so the result was a mouthful of dry bread and dry sugar. I found myself topping it with butter and syrup (went back for syrup 3 times in an attempt for moisture). When I make this dish at home, using a thick slice of bread such as challah loaf, I let the bread soak up the egg &amp; milk batter enough that if you add sugar, you shouldn&#39;t need a dump of syrup too. The though did cross my mind while chewing that they were worried about cost so thus the lack of batter, the thought also crossed my mind that this is just their idea of good French Toast, which then lead me to believe I could open a great breakfast diner one day.... Pipe dreams. Should have ordered the Grand Marnier battered French Toast instead (it just sounded too sweet).

 The ambiance is a well lit , high ceiling room with high noise level but good air circulation (thank goodness, the guy in booth behind me  had awful B.O. which we could smell while be ate... not the restaurant&#39;s problem but yeesh...).

OVERALL: Our waitress was a professional by all means, very cool. The food was nice looking and average tasting. Try going for the specialty items over the basic breakfast items. The prices are average (about $8 per meal without drinks or extras), and BONUS: they let you take home an additional fresh cup of coffee to go (no additional charge), which make&#39;s your $2.49 per cup all the worth while (I loved that).",15/01/12,433,4,1,5,-5,7.4917,3.8680000000000003,2.084,27.048000000000002,No,3496

I received my beef sandwich and parked myself at a table. Now eating an Italian Beef sandwich can be almost like a commitment sometimes that once you pick it up, you&#39;re kind of committed to finish it since it can become somewhat fragile due to the beef juice.
Wow. I have to say that this was one tasty sandwich. The beef was very flavorful, the giardinera was spicy. It was also messy. I&#39;m OK with messy as long as the sandwich is worth it and this one definitely was worth it.

- Hot dog with everything on it = exceptional. I love the fact that they serve it with fries on the dog. Scrumptious. 

- Chili cheese fries = mouth watering delicious

- Onion rings = awesome batter

- Chicken wings = probably the best chicken wings around. I will definitely order MORE of these next time.

Decor: There isn&#39;t much to this place - it&#39;s a bit of a &#34;hole-in-the-wall.&#34; But, as any good Yelper knows, these type of places have the best food! And Nana&#39;s is no different. But I digress... there are a handful of tables and not much to look at on the walls. It is a clean place, well taken care of for sure.
Bathroom: It&#39;s in the back, through the kitchen, but it is clean and inviting.

Staff: While everyone was nice, they were a bit slow (from what I remember). We did not have a complicated order but it still seemed to take awhile for them to make - and there was NOT a big crowd at all.

Food/Drink: The food is classic Chicago hot dog joint fare. They have a little bit of everything but we went with what they do best: hot dogs and beef. The dogs come with fries (some of the BEST around) and the beef was extra juicy. The only thing I was a bit disappointed with is a hot dog with &#34;everything&#34; is not a standard Chicago-style dog - it is lacking several key ingredients.

the-original-nanas-hot-dogs-streamwood,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,6gWo-B8-14kUklBx8VD5aQ,"Original Nana&#39;s Hot Dogs is an aesthetically unique looking fast food restaurant with an extremely eye-catching sign located off of Irving Park Road in Streamwood. Having had several people recommend I review this place, I finally made the voyage to Nana&#39;s to try it for myself.

First off let&#39;s go over the hot dog. Nana&#39;s serves a natural casing Vienna Beef dog on a very soft bun. The bun does not have poppy seeds like most Chicago style hot dogs. Pickles, peppers and celery salt do not come standard on the Nana&#39;s dog and because I was unaware of this I failed to ask for a pickle on my hot dog, so I can&#39;t comment on that. But the application of condiments on my hot dog was perfect, the bun was soft with some fry grease soaked in as the fries are bundled in the same wrapper as your hot dog. The sport pepper wasn&#39;t too hot. The relish is sweet and flavorful and the onions were perfect. If you make sure to ask for the optional pickle, peppers and celery salt, the only thing missing from this being a near perfect Chicago style hot dog is the poppy seed bun. This hot dog is absolutely fantastic and stands among the best I&#39;ve found anywhere in the city or suburbs.

I also decided to try the cheeseburger, this was a well grilled masterpiece of flavor on a sesame seed bun. The condiments were applied well and this was just a fountain of wonderful flavor. This is possibly the best fast food burger I&#39;ve ever had. It wasn&#39;t too greasy, but maintained that char grilled flavor that makes a fast food burger great.

The fries included are tasty fresh cut fries, very similar to those served by Gene and Jude&#39;s in River Grove. They are mashed into the hot dog in a similar fashion as well. They&#39;re not too greasy, but what grease does reach the hot dog simply soaks into the bun.

Overall Original Nana&#39;s easily exceeded my expectations, this is one of the top five fast food places I&#39;ve found anywhere. I can&#39;t recommend this place enough!",26/06/12,231,5,3,5,63,7.2354,3.4390000000000005,0.669,15.893,No,2010

Its not as it once was, frankly its gone through three major changes since the original family first sold it, and none of them have improved the business, service, and the quality has only gone down.

The latest &#34;remodel&#34; which incorporated a drive through window, also eliminated the customer bathroom.

So, if you need to &#34;go&#34; or just wash your hands, you have to navigate through the kitchen, storage,   and food preparation area to do so.

Although they grill in front of you, and re-fry the fries in front of you, the vast majority is just final assembly in the front.  The prep or pre-prep is all done in the back.

One trip through same, and if you&#39;re wearing your glasses (or if you don&#39;t need glasses, you&#39;re paying attention to what you pass by/through, as well as pay attention to what you have traveled to) I&#39;m thinking you, like me, won&#39;t ever be back.

And Nana&#39;s is still there on Irving Park Rd. serving up some of the quickest and tastiest hot dogs and fries around.

The decor isn&#39;t much to look at; a high counter, a few tables and booths about, all worn and needing a fresh coat of paint.  BUT, you aren&#39;t here for the decor.  You want a dog!  You want it fast!  And you want it cheap!

All the dogs come with fries, literally.  The dog is covered in fries and then wrapped up tightly in deli paper.  This can be a tad messy so don&#39;t even think about trying to eat one of these in the car.  The fries are fresh and you can watch them put the potatoes in the special do-hickey to cut them up.

They have other traditional dog-joint fare on the menu like pizza puffs, beefs and the like.  They even have those yummy Mexican bottled sodas and GREEN RIVER soda at the fountain.

Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve had there:

1) Double Dog, Easy Mustard: Great snap. Perfectly steamed!!
2) Fries: Typically, I&#39;m not a fan of handcut fries. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the oil here or what, but their fries are great. Not soggy, not burnt tasting.
3) Chili Dog: Husband claims it&#39;s great.
4) Cheese Pizza: Meh. Was great for my kid after football, I&#39;d like to try it with something on it before I give a full evaluation.
5) Onion Rings: TO DIE FOR.
6) Cheese Sticks: Good, nothing special.
7) Chicken Strips: Good. Can tell it&#39;s real chicken breast.
8) Drink Options: GREEN RIVER and other assorted drinks.
9) Double Cheeseburger: Was pleasantly surprised. It was Great! Next time I&#39;m going to see if I can get a Bacon Cheesburger!

The cashier (who I assume was the manager) told us &#34;no, but you can get a double and a single&#34;. Well sir... I don&#39;t want the bun or the condiments. All I want is an extra patty and piece of cheese. That was b.s. I&#39;m also not crazy about the fact that they lump the fries in with the hotdogs. What would be the big deal about putting them in a different bag? Also the fried mushrooms are mushy, and the fries could be a little crispier. All in all... I wouldn&#39;t go back that often.

I remember the day well, my father asked what I wanted on my hot Dog and I replied, &#34;I want a hamburger&#34;. Dad ordered me hot dog with mustard, relish and onions - The NaNa&#39;s STD dog. In fact, for a long time that was all that was offered as far as toppings, kind of like Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s. Nowadays, you can get it with ketchup, sport peppers and celery salt if you like. My advice for those who enjoy  ketchup on your dog, order two and try one with mustard, relish, onions (add sport peppers if you like&#39;em). The fries are heavenly, served right on top of the dog. Its o.k., just move the fries off of the dog but make sure to leave a few on top, trust me. French fries are fresh cut and blanched first, which is really the best way to cook fresh cut fries.

On the way to Jimmy John&#39;s (we don&#39;t have them in CA) I saw Nana&#39;s. Looked like a cool local place so I stopped in.

Somewhat small but clean interior. Plenty of seating at 12:30 on a Tuesday.

I got the original dog, which is mustard, onions and relish and comes with fresh cut fries. They put the fries on top of the dog and wrap it all up, which was a bit odd and left a few fries intertwined with the dog.

I wasn&#39;t a fan of the fries. I like natural cut, but these were just a bit too soggy for me (I like crispy fries, but the flavor of these was good, just not crispy enough).

The dog was very good. A bit heavy on the onions, and nowhere close to Burney&#39;s in Auburn, CA, but tasty enough.

I&#39;d go back and try other things (they do burgers and other stuff too).",05/02/13,114,3,2,2,13,1.7932000000000001,1.973,0.914,9.114,No,900

First up they added pizza to their menus. The slices are huge and cheap! Are the best in the world? Not really but they are pretty good. One slice could probably feed to average adult eaters.

They also started a Facebook page and if you add them you can get a free slice of pizza or a free hot dog!

If your a fan of Gene &amp; Judes, their hotdogs are similar in style and also on how they wrap it up. The dogs are wrapped with fries on top. If you ask they can put the fries on the side for you. The fries are cut fresh from real potatoes not the frozen stuff you may find at some places. The have the potato slicers mounted on their wall and you can see them slice them when they are low on fries. Unlike Gene &amp;Jude you can add ketchup to your dogs here! Sacrilege!

The Nana&#39;s style dog is a Vienna beef dog, steamed bun, onions, sweet relish, mustard, sport peppers, and is topped w/ a whole lot of fries.The dogs themselves had that heavenly snap that no hot dog should be w/out. The combo is pretty close to perfect. The only thing that I wasn&#39;t too impressed w/ was the fries. It&#39;s probably just my preference though.

the-original-nanas-hot-dogs-streamwood,Don Z.,1dFC0YhcvFu1ibPVYTkEfA,q9-rf4NGK-5YJsNiUqGqLQ,"Nana&#39;s is a tiny little hot dog joint that I have been going to occasionally for over 10 years.  I visited more frequently when I used to live in Streamwood, but now that I have moved and I am a little more conscious about eating junk food, I save Nana&#39;s for special occasions.

Those occasions are when I just need to have the best dogs, burgers, beefs, fries, and malts!

Nana&#39;s is a small place decorated in the traditional yellow and red scheme.  The private parking lot is plenty big in proportion to the tiny amount of seating inside.  They do a lot of takeout business.  I like my stuff hot and fresh, so I tend to eat in.

Walking in the door puts you right in front of the counter where you can order your food.  Be aware of the definitions of &#34;everything&#34; which are posted on the wall for hot dogs and hamburgers.  Nana&#39;s definitions may be different than yours.  It&#39;s no big deal though, because they will do the toppings any way you like, you just may have to say something other than &#34;everything&#34;.  They conveniently accept credit cards too.

After ordering you can mill around in front of the counter waiting for your order or go pick one of the hard surface booth seats.  I think there are about 6 four seaters  and 2 two seaters.
A few minutes after you order someone will announce in a half mumble as they set some food on top of the counter down from where you ordered.  This may or may not be your food depending on how many people were ordering. Also depending on what you ordered, it may not be complete.  This usually happens when I order malts which take longer to make.  So keep an eye and an ear out and eventually you will get everything.  On the way back to your table, be sure to grab ketchup, mustard and napkins from the counter as there are none on the table.

So finally I get to the food.   I love that the hot dogs have that &#34;snap&#34; to them from the old fashioned casings.  I love the fresh cut fries, which they make by pushing a whole potato, skin and all through the cutter and right into the fryer.  What I am not as fond of is that when I order a hotdog, they serve the fries and dog wrapped together.  This tends to make everything a little too soggy.  I also get the Italian beef and the combo occasionally.  Very tasty and soaked and au jus as it should be.  The final belly buster that I can never resist are the malts.  They are big, thick and delicious.  They are topped with whipped cream and a wafer cookie.  Practically a meal in themselves, we always get two just because I cannot decide on what flavor I want.  The banana and chocolate are my two favorites.
They do a lot of promotion around the Gi-Nana-mous pizza slices, but I have never had one.  Having seen them on display, I am not even tempted.  They are huge, but it just looks like standard fast food pizza.

Overall, I like Nana&#39;s for what it is.  There is no service or ambiance to love, but that is not why I come here.  This is the way fast food is supposed to be... the way it was before the corporations refined it into a terrible cookie cutter experience of bland food.
As long as I can still look down and see my shoes, I will be back to Nana&#39;s for my fast food fix.",15/01/12,347,4,2,5,20,5.981100000000001,3.642,0.525,34.831,No,3234

We started off with some warm fresh bread that was served with some garlic butter and an olive tapenade. It was delicious! We got the fried calamari (off the specialties menu), which was probably one of the best I&#39;ve had. For the main course, I chose the Black Pasta (a popular dish recommended by our waiter), and my husband chose a veal dish that was off the specialties menu. Both were very tasty.

Added, they proudly serve squid ink pasta. But please, if you serve this, please learn how to cook this pasta. They cook with cream sauce and squid ink pasta was over cooked angel hair pasta. The restaurant owner or chef doesn&#39;t know how to serve this type of pasta at all. 
Seafood tomato sauce pasta...... it just shows only how it looks good and taste nothing. They put few big clams which is unnecessary to use it for this type of pasta. Pasta was soggy.....

Our meal began with our hosts pushing in our seats for us and pouring our water.  Warm bread with some kind of olive/garlic tapanade as well as garlic butter quickly followed, so we were already off to a good start.

The two of us split &#34;La Bella&#34; salad, featuring arugula, pears, figs, goat cheese and cranberries in a citrus vinaigrette dressing.  It was every bit as good as it sounds!  We then split the mussels and clams appetizer for our entree.  They brought each of these dishes to our table already split into two plates for us, which was greatly appreciated.  Between the salad, seafood, and never-ending bread, by the end of the meal we were full and satisfied.  Everything was excellent; the only criticism I can offer is that the angel hair spaghetti with the seafood seemed overcooked, and I feel like any legit Italian place should be able to get that al dente texture right.  So I can&#39;t vouch for the pasta, but otherwise we were thrilled with our main dishes.

The wine was ok but a little overpriced. All in all a terrific experience.",10/12/15,60,4,2,5,42,4.6039,3.6529999999999996,0.0,7.3469999999999995,No,570

We came in at 6pm on a Sunday and the place was empty so that should have been my first clue but I came in opened minded.  The service was good but the food was some of worst we have ever had.

It started off with bread that was extremely hard, almost like it had been sitting out.  We then were given salads &#34;on the house&#34; that had dressing that tasted like caesar gone wrong.  Almost all you could taste was anchovies.

Finally, the meals came and things got worse.  We ordered spinach raviolI that was very undercooked and super salty.  The spaghetti and meatballs tasted like they were frozen and the pasta was not fresh. Also both entrees were very greasy.

Overall,  I would recommend Maggianos in Schaumburg or Giacomos in Des Planes if you want good Italian food.",22/05/16,91,1,1,1,10,0.5342,1.3230000000000002,1.1210000000000002,8.553999999999998,No,842

I don&#39;t usually crave Italian food but this place has me hooked. The 2 times I&#39;ve been here wasn&#39;t too busy and staff was super friendly! I made a reservation online and I got a personal email back saying they couldn&#39;t wait to have us which I thought was so cool!!  and strange haha

Appetizer: fried calamari. I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s in here but I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. The fried calamari comes on a bed of salad. The flavoring of the salad is so good.. I could probably eat this dish as my entree but the menu is too delicious to just eat appetizer  

Entree: I&#39;ve had the black pasta and gnocchi di casa. The sauce for the black pasta is SO GOOD. I didn&#39;t really like their gnocchi dish bc the sauce tasted greasy and fatty but I loved the gnocchi. On my 2nd visit, I requested the gnocchi but with the black pasta sauce and they were more than willing to accommodate. 

My friends had the spaghetti and meatball which i thought was also really good. I also tried their penna farcita and did not enjoy that dish at all. :(

Knocking off a star bc on my 2nd visit here everything tasted SUPER salty and my salad was SUPER greasy. Guess the chefs were different. I&#39;ll just assume it was an off day bc I still want to go back some time again. Just request them to go easy on the salt and grease.

Overall, I would be back bc this place has me constantly thinking of italian food now. Carb overload...",18/06/15,171,4,2,5,14,6.228800000000001,2.91,0.566,15.526000000000002,No,1558

Appetizers included the grilled calamari (good but saucy, and I wish it was fried) and the caprese salad. 

Entrees were linguine pescatore (too salty), black pasta (the best dish we ordered), risotto with shrimp, and beet salad. 

We ordered the chocolate lava cake (delicious and served a la mode with Neapolitan ice cream), peach cobbler (also excellent and served a la mode), and crime brle (coffee flavored? But good as well).

We&#39;re talking to a coworker who mentioned how good this place&#39;s ITALIAN food is, and we decided to give it another try.

Then I went to the restroom, my gf asked for the wine menu and was told to wait until I got back. Then after choosing what wine she wanted, was asked for an ID after showing it was told it didn&#39;t look like her and and he needed to see something else to make sure it was her. Then after waiting for about 30-40 minutes was finally able to get the servers attention to order...and I&#39;ve worked in a restaurant for many years mostly back of the house but also front work as well and as we were seated inside there was barely any tables that our server had. Then we made the server aware that my gf had a severe shellfish allergy and after rolling his eyes at her when she said that...even though she ordered a chicken pasta dish with no shellfish in it. The food came to the table and asked the runner if they made sure no shellfish touched or was near it and they said yes it was prepared totally separate...food tasted amazing but about 10 min after my gf starting to eat her food her mouth felt really tingly and swollen...the only plus to this experience was obviously the server could tell we were dissatisfied and brought is free dessert.
After having to go to the emergency room afterwards and be there all night because of the lack of care provided, kinda makes me disgusted to say that I&#39;m a chef, very severe allergy not to be taken lightly and it was just not cared about at all...no manager to talk too at all. I would mention the servers name but never once did he introduce himself or tell us his name during the whole time being there. Service was terrible, never recommend this place to anyone.

Our reservations were 100% successful on a busy Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting despite a packed house. Our open table didn&#39;t go to a walk in.  

Service was exceptional. Not too much; not too little.  We had all the water, bread, etc. that we wanted.  Our wine glasses were topped up. When we gals said no more wine (designated drivers), the waiter remembered and only the guys got vino.  We were able to take our time ordering throughout.  No rush to push us out the door after. 

The food was delicious as always.  Of special note was a filet mignon and veal meatball spaghetti topped with exceptional bolognese sauce.   It was on the specials menu and it blew one of our guests away.  The other guest had the mushroom and sausage risotto topped with goat cheese.  She said the layers of flavors and textures were amazing. 

We all loved the bread that came out with house made green olive tapenade and herbed butter.  Yummy!!!!

The only thing that gets me is the wine list is all lower range wines.  $10 wine for $40.  No midrange or better wines.",06/03/16,141,4,1,4,0,3.0210000000000004,2.2889999999999997,0.7390000000000001,18.972,No,1150

I even tried to pop in for lunch one day and that was a major fail (they only offer dinner service!). My expectations were met with solid service, an inviting atmosphere and, most importantly, pretty delicious Italian eats. 

Let me preface my review experience by stating that hubs and I made my birthday reservation here on the night of a very important Blackhawks game. We&#39;re not huge Hawks fans, but I knew the (from what I&#39;ve heard) intimate setting of this restaurant would likely be altered significantly because of said game. And while it certainly wasn&#39;t a sports bar feel, I imagine it was brighter, louder, and hosted much more TV attention than the typical Saturday night. 

All that being said, Carlos &amp; Carlos is adorably quaint. We sat practically smack dab in the middle of the restaurant and started by launching ourselves into the delicious fresh (warm) bread and garlicky whipped butter. Please and thank you. 

Our server was swift but friendly, offering his take on a variety of their Italian classics as well as some specials of the evening. We went with the scallop appetizer and since I couldn&#39;t quite make up my mind he offered to let me order halfsies on the two pastas I was mulling over. Here&#39;s a quick rundown of the dishes I tried...

Scallops Pistachio: 4/5: Three small scallops nicely seared with an awesome mango roasted pepper sauce. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the cold cauliflower &#34;hill&#34; in the middle but the main attraction (scallops) were great. 

Risotto Gamberi: 3.5/5: Arborio served w/ prawns, shaved garlic, fresh tomatoes, spinach, and touch of terragon. A solid risotto dish but I felt it could have used a kick - red pepper, heat, something. 

Gnocchi Di Casa: 5/5: Pillowy homemade gnocchi served with small chunks of fillet mignon, broccoli, shaved garlic, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms in a olive oil sauce. Fantastico. 

Veal chop: 5/5: Hubs ordered this as a special and it was pounded thin, and lightly fried to crispy but tender perfection. 

Chocolate cake: 5/5: Decadent mousse-like chocolate cake with a heavy hand (appreciated) of fresh whipped cream on top and a drizzle of raspberry. 

Apple turnover/pastry/pie: 5/5: So much cinnamon, so much apple, so much sugar. Plus ice cream. You cannot go wrong. 

I definitely want to come back to Carlos &amp; Carlos during a non-Chicago sporting event night to get the full experience...and imbibe from their famous drink cart!",03/06/15,326,4,2,5,30,8.262200000000002,5.33,0.289,17.380999999999997,No,2541

Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

Have I mentioned I like the place? It&#39;s my new favorite. It&#39;s in Downtown Arlington Heights, and it&#39;s amazing. Part of me doesn&#39;t want to share it with you. I should tell you how awful it is, so that I can keep it to myself. But it&#39;s not. Its a delicious party in your mouth that will keep you coming back for more. 

The front of the building and entry are very understated. But the inside of the restaurant is beautiful! It&#39;s very classy, but the dress-code is casual. I&#39;m sure on a  Saturday night it&#39;s probably a little nicer than &#34;casual&#34;, but i&#39;ve been twice on weeknights and we wore  jeans, and didn&#39;t feel out of place. 

They have delicious fresh bread, but that&#39;s not the best part of it. They&#39;ve got this herb/garlic butter spread that is just amazing. YUM YUM YUM. It&#39;s the kind of thing that you crave. It&#39;s the kind of thing that at 3 o&#39;clock on a Thursday you think to yourself &#34;Damn, i could go for some of that bread and butter right now&#34;. 

Rumor has it they make their own pasta on a daily basis, and I have to tell you it is just to die for. There is SUCH a HUGE difference in the pasta we all use to cook, and the fresh pasta that they use here. The texture itself even stands out.  But once you put it in your mouth, you&#39;ll never want standard pasta again. Nor should you, when something this delicious is available to you!

The first time I went, it was suggested to me to try their Spaghetti and Meatballs, even though it&#39;s not on the menu. So I did. And it was so delicious. I&#39;d literally been craving it ever since the first time I went. So I went back a couple nights ago to get it again. It&#39;s phenomenal, and I highly recommend it. 

The place is kind-of small, quaint I should say. So if they take reservations on the weekend - I&#39;d be sure to call ahead. They&#39;ve got a full bar. The service has been great. All the servers there have been very friendly and helpful. They even remembered us when we walked in after having only been there once before! The prices are very fair. 

HIGHLY recommend this place. Can&#39;t say enough good about it. I hope they are very successful and that they are here to stay.",26/09/14,230,5,3,5,58,9.165399999999998,8.888,1.288,28.824,No,2265
carlos-and-carlos-arlington-heights,Mick B.,kk-bXv0GI7bDg1RIRJNCIw,yDvcrh9wDnfiX40V0ilDow,"I feel that there are two major elements to any evening of fine dining. There of course is the food and drink and there is also what I like to call the &#34;experience&#34;. Most people know if they have been served a good meal, but many times the &#34;experience&#34; is what we remember the most.

Our &#34;experience&#34; at Carlos &amp; Carlos was very enjoyable- we were greeted and seated quickly, everyone that we came in contact with smiled, seemed to be enjoying themselves and also made us feel very welcomed. It was almost like being invited to someone&#39;s home for a special occasion.

That having been said- we enjoyed everything that we ordered, but I wanted to mention two things in particular. I ordered the Linguine Pescatore which was served in a wonderful tomato-based sauce. The Linguine was cooked just the way I like it and the seafood was well done as well. Trust me if you enjoy seafood that this is a great dish to order and enjoy.

Second- we don&#39;t often order dessert, but when our server brought out the sample dessert tray, we couldn&#39;t help ourselves. There were at least a dozen lovely choices on the tray plus a number of ice creams and sherbets also. We ordered the Pistachio gelato which was more than enough to share. We both thought it was very tasty and was served with a vanilla wafer cookie.

A small thing to mention- We were seated in the back area away from the bar and the main dining area. I felt that there was more space between the tables in this area and certainly less overall activity than in the main dining space. If you are looking for a more intimate and quiet place to dine, I would suggest that you ask when checking in to be seated in this back area.

There were two bones in my chicken breasts in my Pollo Piccata (lemon chicken) and overall, the dish was meh.

Instead of a loaf of soft, warm Italian bread, both loaves were crunchy (inside).

Tiramisu was like a Tiramisu-flavored cake. Didn&#39;t appear to have ladyfingers. 

I really can&#39;t stand the way Carlos &amp; Carlos does their checks. 

Most restaurants will print out a white slip with the price of each item...itemized. 

At Carlos &amp; Carlos, you get the actual waiter&#39;s ticket with cash register prices in a column and not the best sense of what each price represents from your meal.

Recently tried this place for the first time.  We came with a party of five for a reservation on a Wednesday night based on the recommendations here on Yelp.

We made reservations early in the day and they were answered fairly promptly by e-mail and phone with responses that were almost a little over the top flowery, but nice.  

Unfortunately, once we arrived that service didn&#39;t quite hold up with a waiter who, while friendly, did not seem particularly knowledgeable or attentive.  He also seemed to have some trouble understanding even basic requests about the wine list or wanting more bread.  In addition, the restaurant was not particularly busy but the food still took quite a while to arrive.

The food itself was quite good, I had the chicken picatta which was delicately balanced without too much acidity or too much oil.  Our table also had the steak, which was perfectly cooked; the minestrone, which was also well balanced with fresh vegetables but not overloaded; and the tilapia special, which while a bit fishy for my taste was perfect for the person who ordered.

The table bread was also notably good with a perfect yeasty taste that smacked of home freshness.

For dessert we had the cannoli which was again well made.  It hit the spot for our whole table who prefer slightly less sweet desserts and a crunchy shell for a cannoli.  The only item that wasn&#39;t up to par was the carrot cake.  It had a nice dense cake body but a bizarre and terribly unappealing frosting which had the addition of garlic that just permeated in through every bite and out your nose.

Aside from the service, which may have just been our experience according to other reviews, the food really was worth the stop if you&#39;re looking for good Italian.",01/10/15,186,4,2,4,21,3.7115000000000005,1.916,0.512,12.572000000000001,No,1826

Started off with the hostess (possibly owner/manager) telling us there probably aren&#39;t any seats outside available (without actually checking), I told her there were 2 available and she was surprised. She walked us outside and sat us down at one of the 2 available tables.... Without menus. So my fianc and I figured the server would just come by or even bus boy with menus immediately. Nope, that&#39;s not the cause. Waited 15 minutes for menus , server came by with them.  Which then we are slowly realizing that the entire patio has only 1 server. We were handed the menus and started overlooking them. Another 10 minutes go by and the server comes back, we order the Beef Carpachio. Thankfully food arrived within the next 10 minutes... But the server? We finished the beef Carpachio and we never saw the server again. While the fianc and I are discussing if we should even bother staying, the lady (owner/maybe manager/ hostess) grabs a glass of wine and sits with the table directly behind us. How does this woman seriously not noticed that the restaurant is backed up? Instead, she&#39;s drinking with another table. It felt like an episode where Gordon Ramsay comes out with cameras and says &#34;THIS IS WHAT YOU DONT DO&#34;, except.. Gordon never came out. Immediately when we saw this, we knew we were going to go somewhere else because that is plain ridiculous. Waited another 15 minutes for the server to come back, we told him we were done here and we would like the check. We paid the check and left and now we are next door at Magos getting 100x better service.

When we got there we found that they had forgotten to unlock the front door. After waiting about 10 minutes I called the number on the front window and informed them of the situation.  The door was opened a little more slowly than I expected, but we got in and had our pick of tables. 

Once seated drinks and warm bread were provided.  We ordered the Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer.  It was very good.  For my entree I ordered the Black Pasta: black angel hair pasta, shrimp, scallops, red and green bell peppers, mushrooms and a delicious sauce.  She ordered Linguini Pescatore, also with shrimp and scallops, plus mussels and garlic in a marinara sauce.  As a single shared side we ordered the grilled asparagus with hollandaise; a great tasty choice.  Then we finished up with the chocolate lava volcano dessert.  Every dessert on the tray looked so good I wish we could have ordered them all.

Aside from the door hiccup at first, the service was impeccable.  We never had an empty glass or had dirty dishes hanging around the table for long. I think that every employee in the place stopped by the table at least once to take care of us (aside from the chef).  Carlos even stopped over to close the blinds since the sun was coming into my eyes and greeted me with a shoulder rub. Overall it was a great choice for our anniversary dinner, and we will definitely be going back again.

Came here with a friend who lives in the area who suggested dinner at Carlos&amp;Carlos. Typically, I am not a gal who likes Italian restaurants. Perhaps it is my dislike for pasta and heavy tomato sauces? However, this place is the exception. 

The place is quaint and you would probably walk past it since there isn&#39;t a giant sign. The decor is cute and cozy. The menu isn&#39;t extensive nor is it loaded with a crazy amount of different pastas.  The waiters bring some herbed butter and an olive tapenade that is to die for!

The reason I&#39;m giving 2 stars is due to the terrible service.  I&#39;ve been here 3 times in the last 6 months, with the 3rd time being tonight.   I always come back thinking maybe this time will be different (benefit of the doubt), but tonight solidified in my mind that the service is just going to be bad forever.   Each time I&#39;ve been there there&#39;s a tense feeling in the place, largely in part to it being seemingly overbooked, and long lines of frustrated customers waiting to be seated for past-due reservations.  It is always chaotic inside (loud and overcrowded).  Sometimes when it&#39;s so busy they will try to rush you through a meal in order to get the next group seated, but this time it was unbearably slow.  We were seated for 20 minutes before we got menus (only because I had to ask for them), and we were there for over 2 hours only because it took so long to get our food.  It would have made it more bearable if someone was coming by every once in a while to refill drinks, but any time we needed anything we had to go find our waiter, or sometimes someone else if the waiter was nowhere to be seen after 5 minutes.

I and two friends had a 6pm reservation on a Saturday night. My friends had eaten here once before, and had a good experience. This was a new place to me.

Arlington Heights is not exactly terra incognita for me, but it&#39;s not familiar territory either. This downtown area seems to be full of restaurants, including Carlos &amp; Carlos, which is Italian food. I did wonder why it wasn&#39;t called Carlo &amp; Carlo, which sounds more Italian to me, but hey, whatever works, right? It&#39;s not a Mexican restaurant.

The bar is on the left when you enter. It was already half full when we arrived. From the time we came in, we were very well served. They offered to take out coats. We said no, since we were three people sitting at a four-top. Someone hung my coat on the empty chair. I was last to sit down, and then he took the cloth napkin, unfolded it, and placed it on my lap. This could be because I look older than the other members of our party, though, and he wasn&#39;t sure I was capable of doing things for myself.

We had water, hot bread, and an herbed butter and an olive tapenade within 10 seconds of sitting down. The butter was fine; nothing special. I did like the olive tapenade very much. My friends dug into it too. 

The house wines by the glass were all $9. One friend had chardonnay, and I had the pinot noir. We were both very happy with our choices. The third person just ordered a Bud Light. What can I tell you - he&#39;s a nice man, so we let him come with us. 

We had the La Bella, Caprese and Roasted Beet salads. All were good. The Roasted Beet was mine, and I thought it was absolutely delicious. I&#39;d order it again in a heartbeat.

For the entrees, one friend had a special Seafood Risotto; the Bud Light man had Chicken Vesuvio; and I had the Penne Amatriciana. I thought the pasta was good, but it sure didn&#39;t wow me. Frankly, it was a disappointment. The leftovers tasted better to me for lunch the next day. The other two were very happy with their entrees.

All the pastas are made fresh in-house. When the waiter gave us the menus, he told us that everything is cooked to order, so they could accommodate any special requests. That&#39;s very nice. 

We had cappuccinos and coffee afterward. That was just fine, too. No dessert; we were too full.

This is a very popular place on Saturday night. By 6:30pm, there were at least 20 people waiting by the entrance and the bar. At least. We were patting ourselves on the back for making an early reservation.

We parked in the parking structure about a block away. Again, we were happy we&#39;d decided to come early. Three cars were jockeying for our space. Be aware that the later you come, parking might get tight here.

All in all, it was a very good experience. I would go again.",09/03/14,331,4,3,5,71,7.6188,6.89,2.1470000000000002,41.963,No,2838

carlos-and-carlos-arlington-heights,Terri L.,tVHRuT16cFvIC1wkXLpQ9Q,YKbWT-1Bwj-MnPYT6xm7-w,"Was very excited to taste food based on all the reviews .
I agree that the warm bread and olive tapenade were very tasty as was the house Chianti. The grilled Calamari very tasty but there were more veggies than calamari in the dish. But still overall enjoyed it.
Now for the Main Course ....
Let me say first that I am a salt lover, and usually don&#39;t complain about it.So if I felt the food was too salty, it really was overpowering. My friend and I ordered the lobster ravioli, always one of our favorites. The presentation was lovely, however, the first bite rendered such a salty taste we both knew it wasn&#39;t an accident. The lobster filling was lost because all we could taste was salt. The other thing I noticed was that instead of a nice big fluffy pillow stuffed with the lobster and ricotta, the ravioli noodle was rather long and flat at one end ( at least three fingers width) and a small pillow at the other end. This indicated to me that they were skimping on the filling and used the extra flat part to fill you up.
My husband who eats everything and rarely complains about food offered to trade his spaghetti and meatballs for my dish, he also said it was over salted. My first taste of spaghetti sauce in comparison was not as salty as my ravioli. However, even tho the meatballs were soft and tender after a few forkfuls the Bolognese sauce (which happens to be one of my favorites) was just as salty. My conclusion?  We should have saved the 142.00.",30/04/16,157,2,2,5,37,4.5857,2.295,0.173,12.532,No,1475

It was a Saturday and the house was full, so make reservations. The drinks came right away, as did the delicious bread. Vegetarians and vegans beware, they serve two dips with the bread. One is obviously butter with some sort of green herb. The other looked like garlic oil, which I ate but soon realized there was fish in it. When I asked the server, he had to check (strange) and informed us that it had anchovies in it. This was a huge turn off for me and my vegetarian husband. We didn&#39;t make a huge fuss over it, but did tell the server we are vegetarian. In the future, I hope the servers tell their guests what they are placing in front of them, since it wasn&#39;t clear. 

The food didn&#39;t come out right away, which I appreciated because they were taking their time preparing quality food for us. You can watch one of the chefs making your homemade pasta! The decor is very simple and the lighting is just right. The servers were attentive, but not overly involved. Water glasses were kept full and the owner (I think) checked on us a couple times too. At the end of the meal, he brought a cart of after dinner drinks for us to enjoy on the house. Fabulous! As you walk out the door, there are cookies at the exit for you to take as you go.

Started off with grilled calamari which was tender and flavorful. A unique combination of ingredients and just enough heat to make it interesting.

For salads we did the capresse salad. Tomatoes could have been a bit more flavorful. I guess it&#39;s tough to get good ripe tomatoes this time if year. Liked the presentation and the addition of avocado, nice touch.

Entrees were very try to the Northern Italian style you would expect, flavorful rich and creamy sauce on the veal piccata and the squid ink pasta with shrimp and scallops.

Okay, so maybe it&#39;s not THAT good. but the food is generally pretty delicious, and sometimes it&#39;s the best alternative to a home-cooked meal.  
Brought home dinner from Boston Market today... while we were in the store, buying it, and we were told that the stuffing was in the kitchen and would be out in just a second.  So we waited, packed up the rest of our dinner, paid, and somehow completely forgot about the stuffing. And as we were getting into our car in the parking lot, one of the workers came sprinting out, yelling, &#34;Wait! You forgot your stuffing!&#34;

I&#39;ve seen a few Boston Market&#39;s go under over the last few years so I didn&#39;t know what to expect walking into this one.  However, it was really clean and it looked as though they finally modernized the look and feel of their dining areas.  I was kind of impressed, actually.

As for the food, I went with a turkey carver on multigrain.  It was delicious and as with most Boston Market dishes, a bit more than I needed to eat.  The giant cups they gave us for our drink orders were daunting and I was glad I opted for lemonade instead of what might have added up to being a liter of soda otherwise.

Two things I hadn&#39;t ever seen done at a Boston Market before had to do with service.  First, after we paid for our orders, the staff brought our plates to the table of our choice.  This is nice but seems silly when we still have to fill our drinks and such.  It was almost a wasted service, if you ask me.

minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Gordon G.,-1eyZGJDZRBKXCqIykNaxg,HyIIMJnggg9q8ZHc8L3Atg,"I was just about to move to New York City in order to be close to the crme de la crme of Dim Sum cuisine.  My bags were packed, Diego and Juan were loading up the moving truck, and my cousin, Vincent, had his sofa all ready in his 300 sq. ft. Manhattan basement apartment for me to crash on while I searched for a place to reside in NYC for under $8,000 a month.

But then I saw a friend&#39;s review of Minghin Cuisine on Yelp, with the words _ &#34;dim sum&#34; highlighted, and more importantly, the city name &#34;Rolling Meadows&#34; staring me in the face.  Could this be true?  An impressive Chinese restaurant with phenomenal Dim Sum located just a short drive down Algonquin Road opened up without my knowledge? How could this be? 

Immediately, I postponed my move, in order to investigate this new discovery of the NW suburbs.  

On a Sunday afternoon, my better half and I went to Minghin to give it a try.  Now since I was in the process of relocating to Manhattan to be closer to Elizabeth Street in Chinatown, which houses such fabulous Dim Sum establishments as Oriental Garden, and Jing Fong, amongst others, Minghin would have to surpass all expectations I had built up in my head.  Before even entering, they already had two strikes against them.  1.  No cart service.  2. I would not be able to pick up &#34;Croach&#34; handbags or &#34;Rolecks&#34; watches for 12 dollars on the sidewalk outside of Minghin Cuisine.  But that&#39;s okay... flavorsome  food can certainly make up for the lack of atmosphere.

We waited 8 seconds (must&#39;ve been for good luck) before being seated at a table between the front of the restaurant and the centralized bar.  Boy those chairs are comfortable!  Given a tablet and a Dim Sum paper menu, I quickly started filling out the paper menu while the better half ordered some soup and a roast pork main dish via the tablet.  

Sadly, they were &#34;out&#34; of the roast pork dish, which seemed quite odd to me. 

About 3 minutes later, a parade of individually sized bamboo steamers showed up onto our table, housing har gow, shu mai, sticky pork filled buns, fried pork and vegetable buns, shrimp crepes, egg tarts (more on that later), potstickers, as well as a bowl of hot n sour soup.

The soup was steaming hot and strong!  Nice and spicy just the way I like it.  The really only negative with the rest of the food was that it lacked the same steaming hotness that you would normally find from steaming bamboo bowls on carts.  It didn&#39;t matter too much to me, but to some, it may.

Back to the egg tarts. This is traditionally a dish that seems to only be served to ones who have actual physical or verbal cues of Asian descent.  I have ordered egg custard every single time I dine for Dim Sum, and 90% of the time, I do not receive any.  Even while neighboring tables with Asian patrons of the restaurant are enjoying MULTIPLE orders of egg tarts!  I have seen other white folks be denied the coveted tarts as well, so it&#39;s not just me. It&#39;s all round-eye white people. However, this time was different.  My white pasty face certainly does not show any signs of me originating from Asia.  Yet, this time, at Minghin Cuisine, I was served the prized-dish.  And it was delicious!  

All of the food was spectacular, leaving me in a food coma, unable to drive home until I had hit the drive-thru of a coffee house and ordered a double.  Folks,  Minghin Cuisine could become my favorite Dim Sum restaurant of all time.   I have since cancelled my plans to relocate to The Big Apple, and will stick around the NW suburbs for awhile.  As long as Minghin Cuisine continues to serve me egg custards, I see no advantage to traveling to a major Chinatown for authentic cuisine.  

PS- We were seated at a table with Chopsticks as the only utensils.  This time, forks and extra napkins were automatically brought to our table after we ordered our food.  We had not asked for forks, but yet we received them (and I cried a little).  You know you have truly arrived as a respected connoisseur of Dim Sum (or Chinese food in general) when forks, knives, or a menu in English never makes it to your table.  I hope that will happen to me at Minghin Cuisine by New Year&#39;s Day.",16/11/16,508,5,1,5,-22,5.308700000000001,4.486000000000001,2.077,35.437,No,4246

The food is exactly the same as well. We ordered a little of everything on the dim sum menu. Everything came out fresh and hot. It was all so good that we ordered a second round for a couple things! It was sad that they ran out of the curry cuttlefish or Macau style pork though. We wanted to try those. My absolute favorite dim sum items are the taro puffs and custard tart and black bean pork ribs and tripe.. and this place makes them perfect. So good!!

I love how their food is not overly salty. Everything tastes simple and nice.

The service was a bit lacking... they tended to overlook our table and help tables with more guests. A couple times we had to call the server over because we either ran out of stuff or we wanted to order more. I also didn&#39;t like that one of the guys took my plate before I was done eating. None of the servers look happy... I guess that&#39;s common in asian restaurants and I guess they are very busy, but it doesn&#39;t make for a pleasant dining experience when all the servers look pissed off.

minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Howard L.,hVSsN5EGe2-h2uW1v_VUdA,Bou68Sh47tVo4C7IzCcv4w,"Our party of six returned for a Saturday nite dinner.  Fortunately, they take reservations of groups of 6 or more, as the large place was totally packed and with maybe 20 people waiting at the reception area at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Virtually all of the diners looked to be Chinese, which surprised me a little in that there was not a little more diversity at this suburban location.  I would say our dining experience was more like 4.5 stars though.  The food was all top notch except maybe the cage-free chicken dish which was a bit on scrawny side, and the average tasting pea tips in broth.  The ratings drawback is due to the space being so loud when it&#39;s packed - it&#39;s like dining in a loud bar, and one could not have a conversation without some extra effort. Anyway, our dinner entrees for tonight were:

- Minghin cage-free half-chicken (scrawny as mentioned)
- clams Hong Kong style (a nice spice level from the jalapenos and red peppers)
- salt and pepper soft shell crab (great dish and value at $15.95)
- beef brisket with eggplant (a tasty and somewhat unique offering, and great with white rice)
- Nagaimo yam gingko shrimp
- pea tips in broth (a little on bitter side, and so-so)
- jumbo sesame balls (served hot, and delicious and addictive)

Overall, still high on my list of Chinese dinner places, but I might try to avoid peak traffic periods.

minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Pari P.,6VKK6L4BP4rQqKYZSkL1eg,VGYkP6P6QJ38lVyfSaO__w,"If you didn&#39;t grow up eating dim sum on the weekends with your family, the experience can be a bit intimidating with all of the options. Minghin has mitigated the mystery underneath each metal lid by making it super easy to order dim sum. 

Minghin is one of the top restaurants in Chinatown and they just opened their fourth location in Rolling Meadows. They&#39;ve invested quite a bit of money on the interior because the place is pretty swanky. From the old days, dim sum consisted of carts full of metal tin containers. Unless you knew the name of the dish in Chinese, you were often stuck with asking the wait staff to lift each lid. You also weren&#39;t sure how long the food had been left on the carts. The great thing about Minghin is that you can order dim sum from the convenience of a menu or a tablet with photos and the food isn&#39;t lukewarm .  

Indicators of good dim sum are the quality of ingredients used, variety of options, and the temperature of the food. Minghin delivers in each category. Still not sure what to order? Get a variety of items that are steamed, braised, pan or deep fried, and a mixture of savory and sweet dishes.

After OCB rolled out, there has been a steady stream of subpar buffets and other random restaurants trying to set up shop here. But Minghin has good service, great food, is fancy and fun inside and on top of it all, has the Minghin name we&#39;ve all come to love from Chinatown right in Arlington Heights! Woohoo!

My coworkers and I went during lunch to try their daily dim sum. Yea huh, you read that right! Daily dim sum in the &#39;burbs! Don&#39;t expect the carts rolling around that you can grab your goodies straight from. Instead they have a photo menu on which you check which dim sum items you want. Everything we ordered was bigger than expected, decently priced and came out quite fast.
+Spare Ribs with Black Bean Sauce - some pieces had little meat on them and I was gnawing on bones. Overall though, a good dish, tasty sauce, but I&#39;d probably skip it my next go around.
+Pan Fried Vegetable Roll - meh. Skip this. Nothing amazing.
+BBQ Pork Crepe - The meat was good though not plentiful. I liked the crepe a lot but there was soooo much of it folded over. I just had huge bites of dough at times. Don&#39;t get me wrong it was sticky &amp; wonderful dough ---- but I need some meat with my sticky icky.
+Egg Tarts! My loves. I love these little custard pastries and they were just as good here as I&#39;ve had anywhere else and served warm.

They were out of pork belly the day I went! Oh so sad. Aside from the dim sum, we split an Orange Beef entree dish that was so delicious. Seriously it was so tasty I couldn&#39;t stop taking just &#39;one last piece&#39;. We wished for a bit more crispiness to bring it to perfection, but I gotta say it was pretty close to a perfect ten dish even without that.

I&#39;ll be back a million more times to try a million more dishes I&#39;m sure. It&#39;s going to be hard not ordering that Orange Beef though....Man is it tasty!",13/10/16,243,4,1,5,-13,5.398299999999999,4.662000000000001,2.019,22.319000000000006,No,1985
minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Jeanna L.,w6cRtwmxNEP4idDJY-WOsg,OIhLEvY_Df_BHHF50uLYxQ,"This place was modern, clean, and deceivingly huge. Waited 30 minutes for a table (it was packed on a Sunday night,) and the seating area was plentiful. There are menus up at the front, so we were productive in that time and had our order ready by the time we sat down.

There&#39;s a tablet with an expanded menu (non-dim sum) at each table, but it was a little too complicated for us, so we stuck to dim sum. Bubble tea is also offered, but I don&#39;t recall it on the menu. 

The food came out quick and in reasonable intervals. It was just as good if not better than the Chinatown location without the grimy feel of most restaurants in that area. Service was also pretty quick. Usually hot tea is automatically served, but we had to ask for it, and it never came. 

Food was hot and fresh, but some of my friends commented some items lacked flavor. I just use Sriracha to take care of that, so seasoning was a non-issue for me. 

I&#39;d just keep in mind to order a variety of textures. We ordered crepes, and it came with the &#34;beef with soy sauce noodles,&#34; which were rice noodles, and everything at the point was a bit too gelatinous for me. All-in-all, I&#39;d return to get my dim sum fix whilst in the area again. For regular Chinese, I&#39;d go to Chef Ping down the street.",19/10/16,152,4,1,3,2,2.6445,1.696,0.198,13.105,No,1294
minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,FzFw3zV5qUyFo2XAOmg2Yw,"Foodies around the Palatine -Rolling Meadows - Arlington Heights - Schaumburg area have been waiting patiently for this famous local Michelin Recommend (Big Gourmand) restaurant to open. In the northwest suburbs, if you&#39;re lucky enough to find dim sum, it&#39;s generally very pricey and only mediocre in quality. Even if you head further down to Westmont or Schaumburg, the quality of dim sum you&#39;ll get is nothing to write home about.

So, does the new Ming Hin live up to the expectations and have the same great quality as the other branches? The answer is a resounding &#34;YES!&#34;. Like the other Ming Hin locations, there are some signature things you&#39;ll definitely notice. The restaurants are very spacious with upscale decor, plenty of servers, well lit, and plenty of parking -- with decorations that are sure to impress your friends. 

But, most importantly -- how is the food? The food comes out piping hot and beautifully presented. There are plenty of dim sum options (more than any other local Chinese restaurant by a mile) with plenty of protein and vegetable variations (don&#39;t forget about their delicious bao and desserts as well!). If you have not eaten much dim sum before -- there are some points to note. First, the portion sizes are a bit smaller and priced as such -- like Chinese tapas. Second, you will find much less sauces than you&#39;d expect from Chinese food. The flavor relies on the freshness and natural quality of the ingredients and avoiding the use of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and oils shows the confidence they have in their ingredient quality. Although the size of the dishes are smaller, using high quality ingredients allows them to pack a ton of flavor into each bite. Third, the dishes will in general be a bit less sweet and salty, while demonstrating a higher level of cooking technique. This is preferred in finer dining -- where fresh spices and herbs provide the majority of the flavor instead. Fourth - Bring friends. Dishes are meant to be shared and you&#39;ll want to try a bit of everything.

Like other Ming Hin restaurants - make sure you try the shrimp crepe, beef crepe, siu mai, beef balls, ** fresh bao **, and bbq pork turnover. The food is pretty consistently between good and excellent for any dish you order so be adventurous and prepare to be delighted.",25/09/16,268,5,2,5,40,8.8396,3.909,0.065,17.026999999999997,No,2336

minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Barry J.,d-fkXxcPspb0YJlVM3OgFw,K2KKFGFlikh69RbRNaJ-Fw,"I get it. Ming Hin is a force to be reckoned with. They have a huge presence in Chinatown and now their plan is to branch out to the burbs. Their doors opened in a remodeled building that used to be a Chinese buffet. There&#39;s plenty of room (unlike its original location) and pretty Chinese decor. 

It feels like Chinatown too. I had no idea there were so many in Arlington Heights. Or are they just flocking here for the first few months. 

My hope is that they do not follow the Chinese buffet trend of putting their best foot forward only to go back into their ways a few months later that detracts customers and will flop in a matter of a year. 

Food is food. It&#39;s noisy. Feels too sophisticated. Suburban families will not get it. Chinese tv on will be confusing for those not used to the Chinatown scene. 

I don&#39;t know how I feel about this place. 

I suppose if you want Chinese food this is nice. But maybe I&#39;m just old fashioned. I don&#39;t want Chinatown in the suburbs. I&#39;ll just take a walk to the Panda Express I see through the window.",15/10/16,110,3,1,3,7,2.3269,2.0620000000000003,1.204,15.734,No,1072

1. BBQ pork puffs were crispy, warm enough and delicious!
2. Fried dumplings were crispy with soft mochi wrap. However, they were very greasy and didn&#39;t have enough filling.
3. Turnip cakes were flavorful! I wish they would pan fry those a bit more so they don&#39;t fall apart that easily.
4. Pan fried buns were okay. Not the best I have ever had, but certainly edible. The bun itself was light and soft, I wish they could be more juicy inside and with saltier filling.
5. Stir fried sticky rice was the worst dish we got at this meal. They were very bland and parts of the rice were still pale. Will never get this again!
6. Roast pork was okay. The skin was kinda hard but I absolutely loved how fat and tender the meat was!!
7. Roast duck was okay. I like the sauce but the duck skin was not crispy at all. The meat was good though.

The interior was very nice and the service was pleasant too! The food came very quickly and they took away our empty plates very fast. They came to check if we had enough tea so often that we didn&#39;t even have to ask for more hot tea while we were there!

I ordered a relatively light amount. The pork and shrimp (siu mai) was really good! As was the Custard Bun and Sticky Rice. The shrimp spring rolls were good, but slightly overdone.

When the big day arrived, my company and I tried out some dim sum and ordered our respective dinner entrees. All of it was terrible. To start with, we were unimpressed with the chive/shrimp dumplings- the dough was barely holding together, a mass of goop (there&#39;s no other way to describe it) lumped around filling that smelled awful. It didn&#39;t even smell like seafood; I don&#39;t even know how to describe it. They brought our vegetable crepes next. Perhaps it was the least offensive dish, since it tasted like absolutely nothing, failing to even absorb the flavor of the sauce it came with. 

Still, I had hope. Everything rode on my main meal, the beef with broccoli... and my hope crashed and burned. I knew from the moment I bit into it that the stuff was very fatty, low quality, and too soft from too much tenderizer. I refused to touch another piece and had to satisfy myself with all the broccoli it came with just to satisfy my appetite. I also shared a bit of my companion&#39;s chow mein... and returned to my broccoli when that too turned out to be bad. It didn&#39;t taste different than any chow mein you can get from a sketchy second rate Chinese restaurant, and this place was recognized by Zagat and Michelin?

minghin-cuisine-rolling-meadows,Walter C.,NTzukRdBkbNtQNNADF4NCw,jdnfrW-pKUE_FjlBDI7Hrg,"I went for dim sum the Sunday (9/25/2016) after they opened.  The food was very good, and not as salty as some of the places I&#39;m used to patronizing in the city.  Dim sum starts at $3.50 per dish, vs $3 downtown, but the dumplings are all large and full of meat and veggies, so you&#39;re definitely getting your money&#39;s worth.  It&#39;s easy to order too much and have to take it home.  However, too much food is a much better problem to have than not enough food.

The only reason I&#39;m giving this place 4 stars is that there&#39;s a lot of empty space in the dining areas.  Since you actually order from a menu and they bring the food to you, rather than pushing carts like traditionally occurs downtown, they could probably find a way to fit more tables in the dining room to help cut down on the hour long wait.  I know part of that was the demand at 12:00 on a Sunday, but I heard about 15 groups called ahead of mine where they left the restaurant rather than wait.  They could cut down on reneging with more tables, since they don&#39;t need to make room for carts to maneuver.

1) BBQ pork turnover
2) Ha Gow (shrimp dumpling)
3) Puffy egg tarts
4) Pot stickers
5) Deep fried shrimp roll
6) Malay cake
7) deep fried pork dumpling

I&#39;m spoiled when it comes to dim sum because I&#39;m orginally from Hong Kong so I can&#39;t help but compare. But for the Chicagoland area, it is by far the best place out here... it is authentic and delicious but of course not quite the same as back in the homeland. Minghin deserves 5 stars for  the Chicagoland area but I&#39;d give it 4 if it was located back in Hong Kong... which is still an excellent rating.

Anyway, an added bonus is that the place is beautifully decorated and for first time dim sumers the menu is extremely easy to navigate.

The restaurant is very spacious, bright, clean &amp; comfortable. The first two times we came for dim sum, and we came between 10am &amp; 10:30am during the weekends with no wait, but there was long wait after 11am.  Dim sum were made to order, fresh, steamy &amp; delicious.  Between the two visits, we have ordered more than half of the dim sum on the menu.  They are all good except for the roasted pork (_which is too fat, it was  not the true _lunch potion stir fry flat rice noodles with beef (_____and Yang Chow fried rice (___were both good.  Service was good &amp; attentive too.  I&#39;m glad that we finally have a decent dim sum place in the suburbs!

However, our dinner experience was quite different.  We ordered General Tso chicken, Kung pao beef, mixed seafood on a nest, stir fry mixed vegetable with garlic, fried rice and a few dim sum (cause they serve dim sum all day).  The dinner dishes were ok, not as good as their dim sum.  The mixed seafood was a little bland, the deep fried nest was not crispy, kung pao beef was not spicy at all and the stir fry vegetables has no garlic flavor.  Service was not good, the waitress might be inexperienced.  It took her a long time to serve us tea (she might have forgotten), she also screwed up on our wine order (gave us different kind of wine), we have to ask twice before we got fork &amp; knife, etc.

Having said all that, we are thrilled that there is a new dim sum place to go closer to home and we will definitely go back and hope Minghin can keep up with the quality!",07/10/16,215,4,1,3,-14,2.5564999999999998,2.2640000000000002,0.66,12.077000000000002,No,1691

stanleys-ale-house-and-restaurant-south-elgin-3,jan l.,JHFsEH3US5qU507QgZHX5w,p0XwxqkWBwBnGArkEm94Ew,"This was quite possibly one of the worst dining experiences we&#39;ve had in the last 10 years. We had great hopes, the menu online looked wonderful. Our party consisted of 3 adults, a teenager, and two toddlers. We had all pretty much decided what to order from the web, and we were really looking forward to lunch today. However, the menu online is not the restaurants menu. Not at all. So the things that looked exciting we thought of ordering were not on the menu anymore.

We arrived at noon, and were the only people in the restaurant.  As a matter of fact, my husband and I wandered around for well over 5 minutes before the bartender appeared. We sat down, our daughter and three kids arrived shortly after. We were pleasantly surprised with the interior. So far, I was very happy!

We decided to order chicken fingers for the 3 and 4 year old immediately, and then we ordered our food. The chicken took about 15 minutes. We had ordered one burger, one soup of the day, one chicken sandwich, and one turkey sandwich. oh and the fried pickles.

The bartender/server said they had a tomato soup today, and left over chicken soup from yesterday. I asked if it was broth based, and she said she was pretty sure it was, but would let me know. She brought the soup out, and as she handed it to me, said it&#39;s cream based. fine, whatever. I tasted the soup, which had more sage in it that the average Thanksgiving turkey and stuffing. It was completely inedible.

When the she came to clear dishes, she asked how my still full cup of soup was, and i said not good. She said thanks for letting me know, I won&#39;t order it later.

The rest of the food took almost an hour to come out. An hour after the chicken fingers is a really long time. At this point there was another couple, and a few people in the booth behind us. My husband was seriously going to ask for the check so we could find someplace else to have some food..we should have.

 The burger was ordered &#34;pink&#34;, as my husband was asked if he wanted it pink. It was very well done. The bacon tasted old and nasty. The chicken on the sandwich was completely over cooked.

The fried pickles were truly horrible. And i mean horrible. They were cold and soggy. They tasted like very old oil. Unbelievably bad. I ate one, the 13 yo ate half and the rest sat. Since my lunch consisted of fried pickles and soup, I was pretty hungry when we left. And during all of this we lost the bartender/server. Someone else dropped the food, and we never saw her again until she brought the check.

This was a huge disappointment, and I will never go back. The humorous part was when the bartender dropped the check, she asked if we had a frequent diners card. Not a chance!! There&#39;s $70 it pained me to have spent on something so miserable.",20/01/13,329,1,1,3,-28,2.1980000000000004,5.034000000000001,4.154999999999999,35.812,No,2801

We made reservations which were honored and good. But service was ok. We are vegetarians so there wasnt much on the menu to order from. But what i was highly recommending was the quesadillas. They were NOTHING like when i had em the 1st time. 1st time they were spilling out with veggies and cheese. This time i barely saw couple veggies inside...mostly cold melted cheese. My gf ordered the carne tacos BUT w/o the carne....because we dont eat meat. Boy that was a foreign concept to our server. She even made comments to the fact that the kitchen staff were laughing and suprised that someone ordered carne tacos without the meat.... :-(
Well after waiting almost 20-25 min we had to ask our server to cancel our order coz it was getting soo late...and she declined our request by saying that they had already made it.....so......where the heck was our food then?!
She goes back...5 or min later...brings out our food. Boy what a dissappointment it was. My gf&#39;s tacos had cheese and verde sauce...no avacado salsa or caramalized onions as stated in menu! And when we pointed it out to our server.....we were again looked at like we were crazy to point that out?! 
Im sorry to have gone there tonight....and more sorry to have spent almost $90 on sucky food (drinks were ok too....1st margarita was good but the 2nd one tasted watered down)....and unprofessional service...we could not wait to leave. Fyi....we still left a tip just coz she did still serve us...

It was awesome, the opposite of the Bien Trucha chaos that can sometimes affect my time there. Unlike BT, Puebla stays open all day. By the time we left, the patio tables were full...we were alone inside the whole time. 

We opted for the Pia Guacamole. It was good. BT wins the guac race, but the bean dip and chips go to Puebla. We loved both. 
We didn&#39;t have a cocktail, but I do want to go back and try their creative margaritas for sure. We had water, and let me tell you, it was awesome water. Super cold, no ice needed...a very nice perk. So yes, we were sort of boring on this trip, our son was at a birthday party and we wanted to get in and get out, so it was water, guac and tacos. So let&#39;s get to the best part, the tacos! We ordered the carne and pescado. The carne are steak, and super tasty steak at that.

It is a very clean, hip, new space.  We were there at 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon.  Not exactly a prime time, but they still had a decent crowd.  We were promptly seated in a spacious booth.  

Being our first time, we had lots of questions, and our waitress was extremely helpful.  My wife had steak tacos, my daughter chicken tacos, they were both excellent.  I had the special of the day: their award winning chicken, bacon and chorizo tacos - out of this world!  My son just got braces and his teeth are hurting so he didn&#39;t eat much (tortilla soup and some guacamole).  I highly recommend the verde salsa.

Unfortunately our experience didn&#39;t live up to our expectations. We were immediately served chips and beans, and the entire bowl of chips was crumbs and small broken chip pieces (no exaggeration). We tried to eat them anyway, but they were SO insanely greasy that both of us instantly felt terribly sick. I&#39;ve never had this problem (not even at Taco Bell.) We both moved on and ordered margaritas, and when we received them, the SIDES of the glasses were salted, not the rim. Like, what? Since when is that a thing? In addition, they were 80% ice, 10% margarita mix, and 5% alcohol. Basically tasted like juice. 

Our entrees were loaded with grease, tasted like they had no salt whatsoever, and were really small portions for the price. I have honestly never had such bland Mexican food in my entire life. You&#39;ve really got to go out of your way to mess up enchiladas in my opinion. They aren&#39;t rocket science. 

We threw our boxed up &#34;leftovers&#34; in the trash as soon as we left. We spent the rest of our night feeling nauseous and miserable. We will not return.",24/07/16,138,2,1,-1,-15,-1.2076,1.877,1.43,14.692999999999998,No,1174

Where to start? The Guacamole is DELICOUS. The Chips &amp; Salsa are amazing (even though you have to pay for them). The Elote is to die for, and you can&#39;t beat the Carne Asada Tacos. This is just the beginning. I&#39;m sure that the rest of the menu is very good as well, these items are just, so good that I don&#39;t want to get anything else. 

I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the margaritas. I though they were a little small for the price, and a bit watered down. On the other hand, my wife thought that they were pretty good. I don&#39;t typically get alcohol anyways, so I won&#39;t be too harsh in this area.

Service has been hit or miss, but I come back for the food every time!

puebla-modern-mexican-st-charles,Catherine P.,#NAME?,CjUE6O_MHdklJZ4h1ia1wQ,"Definitely a spot to visit in Saint Charles!! Worth the drive and totally worth the value.

Some friends suggested this place for dinner this weekend and not knowing much about it, I went with the crowd and made out way to this perfect dinner spot. First impression: spacious, clean, excellent lighting, great location, and the employees seemed to be on top of their game.

When we arrived, we were a few minutes late so we found some margaritas already on our table our friends had ordered. Unfortunately, when I drink tequila, bad things seem to happen so after briefly browsing the menu, I went with a ginger ale and the hubby ordered a Mexican Sprite in the glass bottle. If you have had an America Sprite, you will know the difference!!

Their house made chips were served with beans instead of salsa which I thought was a nice touch. I ordered a few salsas off the menu to try. 3 types for $5. I ordered the Salsa Verde, Habanero and Chile de Arbol. Not gonna lie, one was better than the next. I could have eaten all 3 and made a meal out of them! some of the best salsas are the ones you would never try. Take it from the Mexican that doesn&#39;t like spicy food all that much!!

Their orders of tacos are about $10-$12 for four tacos. At first, I wanted to order the Al Pastor because this is the true test for a Mexican place as far as I&#39;m concerned but after hearing about their specials, I changed my order to their taco of the day: barbacoa. They do not allow you to mix up your taco orders so you must get all 4 the same. You are best to find someone to order something else and trade some tacos to get a variety! Hubbs ordered the steak tacos with melted cheese and I chose the special Barbacoa taco dinner. Rice is not included but it did not interest me all that much. The 4 tacos are more than enough for one person. 

Service is where they lose a star. Our server was very nice and knew the menu items, FOR SURE!! However, we found ourselves quite often with empty drinks or water and even after finding our server and asking for this drink or that drink, he still took a while to produce a beverage. This seemed to be just how the night went for beginning to end. Otherwise, everything went well. The empty glasses issue needs to addressed but we will be back.

Went here when it first opened on a Saturday at 11:30.  Seated promptly.  Let&#39;s just say service was generally good.  Food was definitely mixed.  Prices a little high.

I get that this place is similar to many in the area - tapas style tacos.  BienTrucha, Lupitas, Macarena, El Molcajete, Altiro.  Bien Trucha 5* is the best, Altiro close with 4*.  The rest...decent, but not at the same price point.

We got the ceviche for an appetizer.  It was probably 50% tomatoes, 40% fish and 10% avocados.  Definitely not worth the $11-12 price (I forget exactly).  Fish was chopped in large chunks.  Needed a better ratio (more fish) and smaller chunks of fish.

Tacos - asada, camaron and the chicken-bacon-chorizo one.  The tortillas weren&#39;t toasted or anything.  They were soft, but not warm or heated to bring out the great corn flavor of corn tortillas.  None came out hot.  The camaron (fried shrimp) were not crispy.  The chicken-chorizo-bacon was fairly spicy (observation, not complaint).  The chicken was precooked and dry, the chorizo and bacon flavors barely there.  The asada had an excellent charred flavor, this was the best.  But still, tortillas plain and tacos served almost room temp.  

The child meal was ok for $7.  Kind of meager in portion.  The corn is not fresh, probably frozen.  The ice cream that came with the kid&#39;s meal (vanilla) was delicious, from a gelato place and the server raved about it.  Since it was lunch, we didn&#39;t get any alcoholic drinks, so can&#39;t speak to that.  My water was served with no ice, and my lemon was never refreshed despite the fact my drink was &#39;water with lemon.&#39;  At noon on a Saturday, it was nearly empty, ad therefore ok for a 3 year old, and she was well behaved.

The place was clean, well staffed, good atmosphere, good music.  The only negative besides the food was the high ceiling makes it very echoy when empty (when you have a 3 year old saying hi to passers by outside the window we were seated next to), guessing it gets quite loud when full.  Also, it was freezing inside.  Felt like 65 degrees!  We were shivering.

The courtyard outside is very refreshing.  Met a couple who mentioned the other 3 restaurants were their favorite and they basically agreed with us about our Puebla experience.  We won&#39;t be going back until we try Neo, McNallys and Zaza.",16/04/16,318,3,3,5,68,5.0376,4.2490000000000006,1.3489999999999998,32.403000000000006,No,2421

Unfortunately, good looks can only take you so far, and that is certainly the case with Puebla.

My girlfriend and I met here for dinner last week, and were surprised to see how uncrowded the restaurant was, even for a weeknight, though in hindsight, that probably should have been a sign. We ordered two cocktails, and I must say they were very nice, so if you&#39;re just coming for drinks, you might enjoy the place.

We, however, were also ordering food, especially since chips and salsa did not come complimentary (really? A Mexican restaurant that doesn&#39;t give you free chips and salsa?). We ordered one of the rather expensive salsas, as well as the house guacamole. It was crystal clear that the guacamole was previously frozen - in fact, parts of it were still frozen when it hit the table! We left most of it untouched, something I do not think I have ever done at a Mexican restaurant.

At the waiter&#39;s suggestion, I ordered the fish tacos, expecting crispy tilapia with fresh cilantro and avocado. What arrived instead were four slabs of fish (literally, the fish was cubed) without the slightest crispiness whatsoever. If there was fresh cilantro on those tacos it must have been invisible to the naked eye, as I certainly couldn&#39;t spot any. I left two of the tacos untouched as well.

What a great idea! They start with crisp chips and a smooth bean dip. The jalapeo and salsa verde were excellent. We then had baja tacos and chicken tinga tacos. The ingredients were fresh and the flavors well balanced. This is a fresh take on traditional Mexican cuisine with a healthier option using lettuce wraps.

Driving past Puebla, I suggested we give it a try and hope it&#39;s similar to Bien Trucha.  We were very pleased with the place and happy to now have another option in the modern Mexican realm of dining.

We started with a couple of their salsas at $2 apiece (chips come with it).  We had the Chipotle and the Chile de Arbol Salsa.  Both were excellent.  The portions were small, but our waiter grabbed one of them and refilled it after it was finished, so perhaps refills are free?  I didn&#39;t mind paying for the salsa.  Most upper end Mexi joints are charging for it now anyway, including Bien Trucha and Lupitas.  

We tried the Poblano corn and the green rice appetizers and found them outstanding and decadent.  I get the rice and corn apps at Bien Trucha without fail, and didn&#39;t find these to be any better or worse, in all honesty.  The main difference was that the rice was a light green.  Not sure why, but it tasted nice.  

Had the tacos Al Pastor.  My wife had tacos with what looked like shrimp and avacados on them.  She couldn&#39;t stop raving about them.  Mine were good, but not great.  I would rate the flavor of the Pastor tacos around a 6 or 7.  My main objection to them was that the quality of the tortillas was such that while trying to eat the tacos, the tortillas tended to soak through and fall apart, so that I was eating a taco that was basically disintegrating in my hand while trying to eat it.  My wife&#39;s taco shells held together just fine.  Perhaps something in my tacos tended to soak more easily into the shell.  

I&#39;d been drinking enough prior to visiting Puebla, so I had a Coke.  My wife tried a mango margarita and said she loved it and would order it again soon.  

The atmosphere is pretty relaxed and a more suburban than Bien Trucha which is a bit more upbeat/metro.  The place is enormous and is done up in very high quality woods, tiles and fixtures.  It has an overall very comfortable feeI.  I loved the long bar and appreciated that there are a couple of flat screens in there for times when just in case there&#39;s a big game happening that you don&#39;t want to miss. 

We will most definitely be returning here...soon.  I really liked it and give it a 4.  My wife would probably be in the 4.5 to 5 star territory and she can&#39;t wait to tell all of her friends about it.",14/01/14,255,4,2,5,19,9.328800000000001,4.8260000000000005,0.7020000000000001,22.47,No,2456

I went to Puebla this past Friday with a friend who was visiting from out of town. We had a great experience.

Drinks - standard margarita = very good, Sweet &amp; Smokey margarita = amazing! We also tried the avocado margarita which was very different. We weren&#39;t fans of it but it wasn&#39;t horrible.

Salsa &amp; Guac - We had the Chile de Arbol salsa and the Pablano guacamole. Both were great! 

Tacos - We tried the chicken tinga and tacos al pastor. The chicken tacos were very good but the al pastor was our favorite. The grilled pineapple added just enough sweetness and was just different enough to make it interesting without being weird.

Sides - Elote = just OK, we had both had better; Papas fritas = nothing special.

Our waitress was awesome! Very nice and helpful talking about the drinks and food items.

The ONLY reason it doesn&#39;t get five stars from me is because a tiny serving of salsa is $3.  Most Mexican restaurants give chips and salsa for free.  But anyway, the main course was worth waiting for.  Also because it&#39;s a little loud for my taste.

Well, this adventure was not only overpriced, but completely ruined our day.
First of all, we should have known something&#39;s wrong when we walked in, since the place had an overall atmosphere of a funeral home. 
We waited for about 15 minutes to be helped, even though there were only two other guests at that moment (and, they looked miserable). 
Now, as far as food goes...It was completely bland (unless you call overused cooking oil flavorful) and didn&#39;t even smell enticing.
The goulash meat was full of those chewy tendons and cartilage...The dumplings tasted like warmed up leftovers - they were hot on the outside while the middle was cold.
This was a disgrace. There was no one even around to ask us how we were doing and if everything was OK, until it was time to pay our check...
It was one of those moments when you realize that whatever feedback you have to give should be kept for yourself, because not only that you won&#39;t get an apology but you&#39;ll probably just end up feeling humiliated. 
I would say, if you want to get rid of someone for good (like, someone you don&#39;t want to date anymore, or a cousin out of town that keeps coming to visit but then messes up your house every time, or such), just take them to Bavaria Hof and your problem will be taken care of.

This restaurant apparently has a long reputation for nasty service, but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I wish we had believed the reviews because it would have saved us a very unpleasant experience!

When we arrived for dinner, the place was empty; now I know why.  The owner was insulting and dictatorial, and the waitress was exceptionally rude.  When we politely requested separate checks we were brusquely told, &#34;The restaurant rules forbid separate checks and you must obey the rules.&#34;  Maybe military obedience is expected in other cultures, but this is America and we don&#39;t adapt well to obeying orders issued by waitresses.

One of our group members wanted to use a Groupon and the waitress, hostess, cashier, bartender (she was one person doing all four jobs) rudely told our member she could not use the coupon unless she and three other people moved to another table.  Then the hostile owner appeared and told us that since our group had made a single reservation, none of us would be allowed to move.

When we expressed our displeasure she said, &#34;You people have had too much to drink and I&#39;m cutting you off.&#34;  At that point we had consumed perhaps 2 or 3 ounces each.

Fortunately, we knew of a Nigerian restaurant just a few doors away, where on a previous outing we had enjoyed excellent service and outstanding food.  We called for our check at Bavaria Hof, paid it, walked out, and headed for the Bisi restaurant.

While we were having our appetizers, two Schaumburg police officers came in and came over to our table.  They told us the owner of Bavaria Hof had called them and complained that we had been rude, noisy, and disruptive, and had disturbed other customers with our alcohol induced behavior.  We chatted with the officers and presented our version of events, after which they concluded that the complaint was obviously unfounded.  They apologized for interrupting our meal and left.

I counted the negative reviews of Bavaria Hof, and I found 52.  The owner posted a reply to most of these reviews, made snarky personal comments about the reviewers, and called many of then liars.  With a sample size of 52, I think the credibility of the reviewers is unquestionable.  The owner&#39;s replies all seem to be nothing more than school yard denials.  If a reviewer said the waitress was rude, the owner&#39;s response was just, &#34;No she wasn&#39;t.&#34;

Since this is a negative review I expect the owner will write a reply the same way she replies to other negative reviews, and will call me a liar.  My advice is to read all the reviews and decide for yourself who is presenting the truth, the owner or the victims.",18/04/16,296,1,1,-5,-31,-5.3849,1.167,3.02,18.810999999999996,No,2794

We sit down. Come to find out our coupon  is no good. The waitress tells us it&#39;s not applicable for lunch, however; the fine print doesn&#39;t even mention that. But we decide to stay.  I ordered a beer and was asked to provide two forms of identification. Oooookay. The leek soup tasted like flour water. We had to add a shit ton of salt and pepper to it and even then it had no flavor. The bread basket was slices of stale bread, but unfortunately the bread and butter was the only thing edible. Oh! How can I forget the famous Bavarian pretzel! It came out immediately and looked nothing like a pretzel. Wasn&#39;t even the shape of a pretzel. I&#39;d bet my life on the assumption it was frozen dough microwaved. Now the main entree. Ohhhhh the main entree. I ordered  the Sauerbraten. It was a very small portion of iridescent colored, dry,  old meat of some sort with no flavor. The gravy turned into gel as it cooled. Spaetzl had no flavor but that&#39;s OK because the red cabbage made up for it. The red cabbage was sooooo sweet. Totally inedible. OK, onto my husband&#39;s meal. Again a small portion of what was supposed to be a pork chop turned out to be a fucking ham slice. This place sucks. I got my food to go only to give to my dog. As my husband paid he mentioned to the owner how displeased we were. She argued with him asking why we didn&#39;t return our food. Perfectly logical question. Well the reason we didn&#39;t return our food was why return shit just to get more shit? I suppose we could have returned it and maybe had it taken off our 70$ bill. I don&#39;t know. I feel raped and bullied by the owner. Do not eat here. Just don&#39;t. Read the reviews first.",10/08/16,236,1,1,-2,-17,-2.7286000000000006,2.4139999999999997,4.132000000000001,34.455,No,1958

We asked if we could do separate checks and we&#39;re told we could move our group to different tables.  They charged us $2.95 for glass of tap water. Owner didn&#39;t want to work with us but got very defensive and combative and told us to go somewhere else which we did.  Far better experience at other restaurant.  Really wish I would have read the other reviews before.  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone!!!  Not unless you want bad service, overcharged and insulted.  No stars!

Also the owner responded to others in party that sent in their comments and her response back is not accurate and lies.  The reviews speak for themselves!  We are not the only party to receive horrible and rude service and the owner and her wait staff were rude and unwilling to help resolve the situation but compounded it.

We were not offered option of separate checks but told to split our group up to diff tables.  My friend said you want us to fuck up your service by splitting us all up?  She then insinuated the alcohol must be the problem when we were just seated with our one drink that wasn&#39;t finished.  We were also told we could go somewhere else which we were happy to do.  Then she said we didnt know how to read the bill which said water for $2.75.  Again, insulting!

We purchased a Groupon for Bavaria Hof, even though it was a 45 minute drive from our house, because we like trying new places and saving a little money always helps.  Especially when the menu is overpriced, as it is here.

The only good thing we found about Bavaria Hof was the split pea soup and the red cabbage.  Everything else seemed to be boiled, and had much less flavor than other German food we&#39;ve experienced. 

To top it off, the waitress appeared to only want to hear positive comments and was quite rude when we tried to give our feedback on the food.

bavaria-hof-schaumburg,Eric E.,VkH1Fm9Vn4ohQTT0CC9QFA,bixsONySGnz9zsCz6KDYrA,"My wife and I met here when we first started dating, about 7 years ago. At that time, the service was OK, but the food and prices seemed reasonable.

Now, we visited again with a Restaurant.com certificate, to meet another friend in town for dinner.

We came and were showed to a good table by a young host, and the restaurant was about 1/3 full at 5:30 on a Friday evening. A fair crowd for the time.

We perused the menu with many great German dishes, many bringing back memories from my childhood (yep, I&#39;m German). The prices, however, held us back from freely choosing. Our server, possibly the owner, was also very direct and gruff - perhaps again, authentic German, though most people are far more hospitable. She was direct and opinionated, starting nice but ending up almost telling us what we would or wouldn&#39;t like. Maybe fitting a direct, German atmosphere, but a little unsettling even for somone who is used to dealing with direct, opinionated Germans - especially in a restaurant setting. ;-)

The food was actually excellent! Moderate serving size, but very good quality and well prepared. I tried the Eisbein (Pork shank) and the meat fell off the bone with a wonderful flavor. This was probably the smallest portion of this dish I&#39;ve received, but it&#39;s still penty for one meal. I was satisfyingly full, but not stuffed.

Now, about that atmosphere...

The place looked fine, and was well kept. When we came before, there was an older man playing all manner of fun music. I had asked about this before coming, and told they did not have music. When we got there and started getting our food, here came that same older gentleman to begin by playing the cowbells! Very loud for a mid-sized restaurant, but kind of fun. He proceeded to play beer bottles, two trumpets at once (actually, pretty good) and even a xylophone. He played traditional music and some contemporary hits. He is quite talented, though not the best singer. Quirky as heck, but fun if you&#39;re not sitting right by the music.

Overall, the food is very good and traditional German! I strongly recommend this as compared to, for example, the more generic (though still decent) fare at Hofbrau Haus in Rosement - see another review for this one. The prices, however, are very high. Maybe not exceptional for the food in an upscale setting, but definitely at the limit for the quirky music and gruff service.

A note to the owner - the food is fantastic, and the chef gets compliments on the menu, quality and preparation! The music is fun, but customers may need to be prepared in case they get seated too close and can&#39;t carry on conversation. Customer service could use some polish! Smile more, and use more that direct German hospitality we saw shining through.

To summarize, come here for the food, and seek out some discounts to offset the prices. The meals are fantastic and authentic, and worth a little quirkyness. Three stars instead of four because of the mediocre service and louder music.",28/10/14,371,3,5,5,134,12.336499999999997,6.680999999999998,0.365,27.953,No,3006
bavaria-hof-schaumburg,Marty T.,fQOUvn4-PVtuU3p7hfmfSw,hc7n0eG4BZuiutcTg60-AQ,"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. 

We wanted to share a meal of Wiener Schnitzel with a couple of extra side dishes.  

The waitress informed us there would be a &#34;split plate fee&#34; of $3.50 and we agreed thinking they would bring the meal and sides split on two plates with the food garnished, for two people.  Wrong, the Wiener Schnitzel and bread dumplings came on one plate with the sides in a bowl and she dropped a small salad plate on the table for us to use. Why the $3.50 split plate fee if we were doing the splitting?

The tomato soup was very salty, the Wiener Schnitzel was bland, soggy and not crispy. It looked and tasted like it was cooked ahead and microwaved for us.  The fried potatoes were unseasoned and oily and the bread dumplings tasted like condensed stovetop stuffing. The sauerkraut, at least for me, was inedible.  

The best part of the meal, sadly, was the tap water.",21/09/15,112,1,1,1,-11,0.7642,0.78,0.648,8.572,No,919
bavaria-hof-schaumburg,J R.,WnoRY0_vvhR9etR6KZ7UFg,8aXltvwPzzxxRzaEtYIdoQ,"Not what I expected... What they have on their menu is all german dishes - no doubt. Only the taste is way off. It&#39;s not authentic german - real german food tastes way better without being that expensive. 
I am german, born and grown up in Germany so I know what I am talking about. 
We started with the salad that came with the meal... This was a small plate with beans, cucumber, tomatoes and beets. Beans and cucumbers were ok but everything had a sweet overtone. The Tomatoes were inedible... They were kind of chewy, comparable to chewing gum and did not taste like tomatoes. A really weird structure that I never experienced with tomatoes before. We could not eat them.
The Wiener Schnitzel was tasteless, besides the greasily taste... It tasted like it was fried in too much oil. Same thing for the fried potatoes. When you take the same pan with the same oil over ond over again you have those small black burnt residues in your pan - that&#39;s basically what my potatoes were covered in. 
My husband had the pig roast and it really was nothing else thn pulled pork. A pig roast like we do it in Germany is a lot different. The Spaetzle were tasteless, the gravy had a strange taste.
The beer was good - it came in a bottle. 

The whole menu is overpriced. The food is expensive for what you get. 
Maybe we came with too high expectations or we simply know the real german food too well. 

Service was ok and the waitress was friendly in her way. Nothing to complain about here.
Maybe just an advice... I ate approximately 3/4 of my schnitzel (I hate wasting food) and very little potatoes. She asked me if I want a box and I said no. I would have expected the question &#34;was anything wrong with the food&#34;.

So, to start off we had the potato pancakes with apple sauce. It was good. (Probably german version of hashbrowns in a way).

The red cabbage was good in my opinion ( a little sweet) but good. Then we finished it off with apple strudel. (Too much whipped cream :p). But overall really good. The only thing is its expensive.

This restaurant is NOT German, except for the (there&#39;s only one) waitress (we think she was also the owner).  Nothing in this building will remind you of Germany; no decor and/or background music.  

Looking forward to an outing with another couple, we ended up in this nearby place, none of us had ever been to.   I, too, had to laugh along with other Yelp comments, because at 6:45pm on a Sat.  there was no need for a reservation, which they only take for a party of 5+.  We thought we would be waiting outside for our table.   Ended up the four of us were seated, shortly thereafter, a neighbor showed up.  We requested they be seated at a table next to ours.   We were told that was impossible, as the table next to our was already reserved for a party of two (on the phone I was told &#34;reservations are taken only for parties of 5+).   The place was full of empty tables, yet we could not be accommodated.

We ordered 2 appetizer plates and got 4 potato pancakes for $10.00 and a sausage plate for $10.00 that barely contained enough food for one person.  I must admit that both appetizers were delicious. I ordered sauerbrauten for the main course.  It was watery and tasted like nothing but very strong vinegar.   I do like vinegar, but hoped to taste the meat, too.  The gravy looked good, but was tasteless.    The sauerkraut was good, but a very tiny portion.   All four of us commented on the fact that FOOD WAS NOT GOOD, the PORTIONS WERE VERY SMALL AND THE PRICE WAS WAY TOO MUCH.    Also, read the fine print, you will pay an automatic 18% gratuity, on any bill where a coupon is used.    Two of us at our table have a German heritage, we know what the food should taste like; this was NOT it.

If you want excellent German food, along with an authentic atmosphere and a reasonable price, head over to Fritzl&#39;s, 377 Rand Road, Lake Zurich.   The Lake Zurich address may make you hesitate, but it&#39;s  on the northern border of Palatine and not a bad/far drive at all.

bavaria-hof-schaumburg,Angela M.,54rbU3XI2QEnY-6zd75oKw,p3Ro5md6aXuGtNb8FFi5rA,"So I read the previous reviews &amp; I will say unbiased those people are nuts! I&#39;m a foodie, I&#39;m &#34;picky&#34; and I&#39;m pregnant so hormones/sensitive emotions run wild if you know what I mean. I used a restaurant.com certificate which was welcomed without question. My friend requested the gluten- free menu (graciously provided). We ordered and shared the gluten-free sausage appetizer which was super yummy! I saw some negative reviews about this appetizer...the size was appropriate for an appetizer, a generous taste served with sour kraut and fantastic mustard.  
I ordered schnitzel (veal) with dumplings. My friend ordered Hungarian goulash with spaetzle (ok how do you spell that?!). Both meals were fan-flippin-tastic! Not sure what the table in front of us ordered but it smelled divine as well! This place serves great homemade German cuisine. Dinner prices average $15-19/plate which may sound higher priced to some but folks remember they&#39;re not opening jars or pushing the defrost button on the microwave for a mass-produced, preservative-rich meal. I loved the food &amp; will be back for sure. 
PS - we were not charged a &#34;mandatory gratuity&#34; as per some other reviews I read. We did ok with basic middle school math and were smart enough to tip 20% on the original amount of the bill, not the final discounted amount.

bavaria-hof-schaumburg,Mike S.,GFDUwhxS7dt4j9aWLDoLGQ,JhiGGPSZyIvysdiqLr_Ntw,"I hate to say it but i would pass on this place.  I do enjoy the food. It was great.  Great for a place to serve Schnitzels.  However,  I don&#39;t think i&#39;ll be going back.  To start:  the place was understaffed, with one service (owner) and a bus boy.  I think they are just trying to cut cost as much as possible, however this is hurting them.  

On top of that, NEVER PUT A MANDATORY TIP IN THE CHECK unless its a large party. I brought my father there so it was just the 2 of us. She added 18% tip to the check. Personally, I think she would be lucky to have gotten 10% from me based on the service (empty drinks and had to waive her for refill). The fact she mandated that i tip her 18% it just a slap to my face as a customer.  

The fact is she is owner, so she collects profits and she&#39;s attempting to pocket &#34;Mandatory&#34; tips from people is pathetic.  Maybe she put it in place because people weren&#39;t tipping her, which makes sense. 1 person can not wait an entire restaurant, so i can understand if they weren&#39;t tipping her. 

At the rate they are going, and just judging from reviews you can tell they will not stay afloat for long. 

As i said, I&#39;d love to have a place like this i could go weekly, every other week.  however, i am inclined to avoid this establishment after my experience.  If it was a bad server i could understand but this is all from an owner. so i know what will happen next time (no second chances)",22/07/13,163,2,1,2,10,1.9417000000000006,2.555,1.005,16.44,No,1460

I&#39;ve eaten at some really good German restaurants before and I&#39;ve eaten at some ok German restaurants before. This doesn&#39;t fit in either category.

The only positive I can say is that the red cabbage and the sauerkraut was good. My son had the chicken cordon bleu, which I didn&#39;t try, so maybe it was ok.
I had the Schweine Schnitzel and my hubby had the Veal Rahm.  The first thing I noticed was that my cutlet was very tough and hard to chew. So was hubby&#39;s veal.  
The dumplings were meh as they had some spice in them that was very strong.
The bread that they give you before the meal tasted dried out and didn&#39;t taste fresh or home-made.  

We even went as far as trying the apple strudel, hoping for some light at the end of the tunnel.  Nope, not even.  It was in the shape of a slice of coffee cake and it tasted closer to an apple pie than a strudel, with no strudel topping to be seen.  It was a layer of doughy pie crust, filled with sliced apples with cinnamon and another layer of doughy pie crust.  I had to struggle with it to cut a piece off because the dough was so chewy and rubbery.  The apples tasted dry, without any good caramelized sauce which I would have thought would have been  enveloping the apples. It was covered by a heavy layer of whipped cream.  It wasn&#39;t horrible, but not exactly what I would expect for german apple strudel.

The service was decent though.  The interior seemed kind of outdated and not very appealing, either.

bavaria-hof-schaumburg,M M S.,ijZuwqjqyx6xyhzlejDfVg,9R2BWVHREyDlJ1DgIx0b1Q,"This is my 2nd attempt to review this restaurant.  The first one that I did in Oct 2011 was filtered by Yelp.

I am a big supported of small businesses and I certainly do not wish this particular restaurant to fail or close down.  But, I really wanted my opinion to be heard  and I feel that if the owner is aware of how many customers that they are losing due to fixable issues, maybe things will improve and make this restaurant a place to go (selfish reason: need good German restaurant nearby to go to!).

I went with three friends for a Friday night dinner.  We got there around 6pm and the place wasn&#39;t too crowded (about 1/3 full), so seating wasn&#39;t a problem.

There was only one full time waitress and another lady who help out and also acted as cashier.  I believe she was the owner.  I also under the impression that the waitress was related (daughter of) the owner.

Three out of four of us ordered beer and we shared 2 orders of Bavarian Style Pretzel s (not my idea!) for appetizer.  I had a bite of the pretzel, it was okay.  I certainly had better ones.  I say skip it.

Many reviewers already mention the &#34;German style&#34; salad, so I skip ahead to review the main course.

One of us ordered all-you-can-eat pig roast, one ordered SausagePlatte, one ordered Sauerbraten, I ordered Hungarian Goulash from the Gluten Free menu.

I was told that the Pig Roast, SausagePlatte, and the Sauerbraten were good.  
The (all-you-can eat) pig roast kept coming. 

As for my Gluten-free Hungarian Goulash, the meal/Goulash itself actually tasted fine.  The Gluten-free bread was definitely not freshly baked (to be fair, they never claimed that it was). I am 99% sure the bread was previously frozen and then defrosted. 

All our meals came with a choice of sauerkraut or red cabbage.  All of us chose the red cabbage and it was decent (then again, it tasted about the same as the jarred red cabbage I bought at the grocery store).

Overall service was so-so (we had the owner and her daughter serving us; Daughter was nicer than the grumpy mother). 

We had a coupon for BOGO Pig Roast (must also buy 2 drinks).  I was aware that we didn&#39;t have 2 orders of Pig Roast.  But, when it was time to pay, I thought I asked the owner/cashier anyway if she was willing to accept the coupon. She was very rudely declined to take off $14.95 (price of the all-you-can-eat Pig Roast) off our bill.   I think if she had politely declined, I would be okay with it.
The Sampler, Sauerbraten, and Goulash cost well over $15 each.  Along with our meal, our bill included about 7 alcoholic beverages, two orders of appetizer, and two desserts.  

In short, the food was so-so and service was below average. I&#39;ll keep a watch on reviews for this place.  Unless, things improve significantly, I will not return to this place.",13/12/11,341,1,1,5,5,6.506700000000002,3.9050000000000002,0.525,29.570999999999994,No,2832

This restaurant has long had a problem with nasty service.  No, the food / entertainment / non-existent atmosphere do not make up for it.  I was there yesterday for a birthday dinner.  Party of 8...two kids, two teens, couple and grandparents.  Like many restaurants, this place embraces the practice of automatically adding an 18% tip for a party this size.  Problem here is that thinking they have a guaranteed tip, the server is absent, slow and often downright hostile.  We ordered five all you can eat meals and one would think that actually ordering more food was a crime.  Repeat orders were very heavy on noodles and light on meat.  Even people who didn&#39;t order all you can eat were sneered at and treated contemptuously when they asked for take-home containers.

We had no intention of tipping 18% for such service and told them so at payment time.  They ran through a full charge despite this information and then proceeded to verbally abuse us when we refused to sign the slip.  All sorts of nastiness and personal accusations followed in full view of the entire restaurant.  The people who run and work at this place are unprofessional and mean beyond compare.

I am a sucker for pork chops, so one of my favorite menu items is the Kassler Rippchen.

My wife is a fan of the potato pancakes but she likes apple sauce on it, and I like sour cream.  Other favorites include the spaetzle, brats, our choice of schnitzels, and Hackbraten which is actually a meatloaf.

bavaria-hof-schaumburg,Rob H.,m4Bft9UAGzmLIVwKkj5UvQ,fHrXvEkeUgERKP2LyzUiOA,"The only reason I knew this restaurant was tucked in the back of the strip mall is because one late night I bought some food from the Taco Bell that shields it from the road.  I decided to come back one day and try some authentic German cuisine like my Mom makes.

When we walked in there was not a customer in the entire place.  That should be a warning for 6:30 on a Tuesday night.  The decor is mediocre and definitely lacks &#34;Deutsche gem_tlichkeit&#34;.

The owner/hostess/waitress did not seem to appreciate my joke inquiry of needing a reservation.  We sat down, ordered, and waited.  Amazingly my veal schnitzel, sp_tzle, and sauerkraut came out in less than 10 minutes.  I swear I even heard the microwave &#39;ding&#39; twice.  The food tasted like it.  The veal was tough and barely had any flavor.  Dropping the food off, not asking if we needed anything else, and not ever returning throughout the meal to check if everything was alright is a big no-no in serving in my eyes (and I did it for many years).

Our waitress also did not seem to be in the mood to drum up extra business or make a regular out of me.  I even dropped a hint that it was my first time there and she seemed to not care or wish me a warm welcome.  Rather than enticing me with a cup of coffee, naming a dessert, or even bringing me a menu, I received a short &#34;Would you like anything else?&#34;.  No, I guess I wouldn&#39;t.

While it may be too much to compare authentic fare to the country of origin or to a well-established restaurant across the stateline, Hof nontheless could not deliver a well-seasoned, tender or satisfactory meal.

We had the pork roast that&#39;s available every Friday/Saturday night. The roast was not salted and the ubiquitous gravy that seemed to douse every entree is salty. 

I had the sampler, which included the beef roulade, kassler, pork roast and dumpling. That, too, was inadequate. The roulade was and pork roast tough, and dumpling a seemingly gelatinous, bouncy concoction. The kassler was essentially a salty ham, though the one item that I could stomach. My favorite spaetzle was also the same consistency as the dumpling.

And every Friday night, an elderly musician who plays a record-breaking 10 instruments (at least) entertains the crowd with a collection of German and Italian songs.

i came here with my bf on a wednesday night around 7 and we were the only people there which worried me A LOT. we had a restaurant.com certificate so we thought we&#39;d try it out. 

that being said, the cream of cauliflower was actually wayyy better than it sounds. the German salad plate was lacking to say the least with some cucumbers, beets, pickled green beans and tomatoes. 

for main courses i had the Jager Schnitzel (white wine sauce with mushrooms, onions and green pepper) which was crispy and tasty and full of flavor. the bf got schnitzel with red peppers and onions and it honestly tasted like sweet and sour schnitzel. not appealing to me! the spaetzle was mushy and covered in a gelatinous goop of a gravy but the German potatoes were pretty delish. 

the shining star of the experience was definitely the blueberry strudel. nuf said on that one. it&#39;s pretty hard to screw up a dessert in my book.

Customer Service = Crap

I would&#39;ve given them 5 stars but after what happened last night, I don&#39;t think I would ever order from them again.

Me and my fiance placed an order for delivery  to Mr C&#39;s around 7pm last night for 2 Mr C&#39;s burgers with 2 LARGE drinks, 2 LARGE fries, 1 regular hot dog (no FF)  &amp; 6 hot wings. The woman answering the phone said it&#39;ll take an hour because it was busy.....fine,no problem...

The food came about 1 hr: 15 min-ish, we immediately realized our order was wrong: instead of 2 large drinks and 2 large fries, the woman gave us 2 medium drinks and 1 small fry, WTH?

So we called Mr C&#39;s back and explained to the same woman of the mistake that SHE had done but instead of understanding and coming up with a solution to fix the problem ----- the buffoon began snapping at us and said that she didn&#39;t make a mistake because that&#39;s what we ordered, what a bag full of B.S.!  Eventually, she said she&#39;ll send out the delivery for missing fries &amp; drinks within the next 30 mins, we asked if we should pay the extra cost and give back the wrong food, she said no because it&#39;ll be on the house....fine, no problem...IT NEVER CAME!!

I had a coupon from the website,  on my phone, and the lady at the counter kind of gave me a hard time about using it, but she did take it. 

I ordered two hot dogs, the kids had a pizza burger, and a regular hamburger.   The total bill was $16,whixh in my opinion is a little high considering the quality of the food.  I could go to portillos, and get about the same price, and get better quality food. 

The hot dogs were not Vienna beef, and the buns seem to be the cheapest buns you can find in the grocery store.  (in fact they seemed a little stale). 
The French fries were just Ok.

They stuff a hot dog with with cheese, wrap it with bacon, and then deep fry.  It was very juicy and had a great flavor.  They even include fries with it too.  That&#39;s a great deal for under $5.  The gyros was pretty good as well.  It wasn&#39;t the best I have ever had, but it is right behind that top one.  It was flavorful and wasn&#39;t dry at all.

mr-cs-hot-dogs-and-more-elgin,Michelle F.,QR8XFFHYU-X0epXOrDbrXw,279tQ1fkZMUwioTLtW1j5g,"Tip #1: Get the Yelp Deal ($10 for $20 worth of food) it is WELL worth it considering it fed the three people in my group (me and two of my guy friends)

We ordered:
Side salad
turkey burger (added fries and drink)
2 Slaw Dogs (these come with fries)
2 Regular Hot dogs (these come with fries, too)

So four hot dogs, enough fries to feed an army, a burger, a salad, and a drink all for $20?!  SCORE!!!

OK, moving on.  The staff is really nice, efficient, and funny.  They were laughing at me when I had to stare at the menu for a good ten minutes trying to decide since everything looked really good!

As for the actual food, it was really good.  My salad was just iceburg lettuce and tomato.  Nothing special.  But my turkey burger was REALLY yummy!  It wasn&#39;t just a previously frozen patty, it was fresh and well-seasoned.  The bun was really good, too.

And everyone is right about the fries--they are really good.  Nice and crispy on the outside and hot on the inside.  Perfect!

Last year they built a new strip mall in Elgin and I saw they were putting in a hot dog joint.  I am always looking for a good dog in the area.  I went in for a hot dog, but when I saw they had a &#34;ripper&#34; dog on the menu I had to give it a try.  Now the regular dog was ok.  They bun was poppy seedless and the dog was lost under all of the toppings.  The hotdog was the size of my pinky.  They also skimp on the pickle.  It is not the wedge that I would like, it was a thin shaved pickle thrown on top.  They throw a handful of fries on top of the dog, but they were a plain frozen fry and not that great.  I had high hopes for the &#34;ripper&#34; dog.  It was a jumbo dog that was deep fried.  Now what I understand a &#34;ripper&#34; dog is thrown in the fryer and sits there until it &#34;rips&#34; open.  This was sliced with a knife and warmed in the oil.  I would have loved to see some color put onto the dog but really it was just a warm hotdog.

The place I went to would be packed all day, and here I was with my wife and we were the only people in the restaurant.  Service was top notch, we were the only people in the place so it was expected, but the food just wasn&#39;t very good.  Instead of salsa to start off with, they give you a black bean type dip that is extremely bland, and definitely needed salt. We decided for the guacamole of the day which was Pineapple.  This too needed salt, and the pineapple chunks looked like they came out of a can. I had the Pastor and my wife had the chicken tacos. The problem is that they only used one corn tortilla instead of two, so the combination of the sauces they use and only one tortilla left my taco wet and easy to rip.  My wife gave up trying to eat them as tacos and forked it.  Flavors on Pastor were pretty good, but not enough to warrant another trip.

Apparently, this is where the owner of Fat Rosie&#39;s in St. Charles ended up after that restaurant closed... Which explains a couple of things...

The food is better than average. The poblano sauce with the carne asada was &#34;to die for&#34;, and the chicken fajitas showed up in one of those volcanic rock bowls heated to 1,000 degrees (like they used to use in Fat Rosie&#39;s). By the time I got to the bottom of the bowl, it was still cooking the onions -- nice!

But there was nothing with the fajitas, except for lukewarm rice and black beans. No shredded cheese, no sour cream, no cool lettuce and chopped tomato, no guac. However, the carne asada came with a nice selection of grilled and roasted veggies.

Tacos looked good, served small plate style. Ceviche was very tasty, but there was very little fish in it. And for $10, you can find at least 4 oz of tilapia, right?

No chips and salsa before dinner unless you buy a starter -- seems to be a growing trend in trendy Mexican places...

The piece de resistance, though, was the Pepino margarita (cucumber). We&#39;d go back JUST for that.. And I&#39;d give them 4 stars JUST for that.

So here&#39;s hoping they work out all of the bugs and get their outside patio opened soon. There are going to be a lot of hot summer days where a nice margarita will do the trick...",19/05/13,173,4,1,2,-10,1.9695999999999998,1.458,0.607,11.935000000000002,No,1436
lupitas-cocina-st-charles,R I C K Y B O B B Y.,T1i1T8LLFFz4mVi8tLz3eQ,3Up69vlLg4M_Z2sm0610lQ,"I guess the first thing that people should understand about this place, is that they are not your typical $1.50 per taco taqueria where you get crappy meat, shredded lettuce and shredded cheese.  If that is what you want, Taco Bell is right up the street on Randall Rd.  This is an upscale Mexican restaurant that is specializing in quality food, and excellent service.  You will not walk out of here without spending $10-15 per person on the cheap side.  If you come, make it for a nice meal, where you can splurge a little bit and get some apps and drinks and really soak this place in.  It&#39;s worth it!  After visiting numerous times, I am happy to finally give my review of this place.

Tacos:  As I have posted in the tips, they have a Taco Tuesday Special, where all of their tacos are $7.99 each.  You get four per order and they are fantastic!  My wife and I have had every one of them now.  Our hands down favorite is the Pastor tacos.  The pork has this amazing smoky sweet glaze on it, served with onions, an green salsa and a stick of fresh pineapple.  I am not a pineapple fan, but have to admit, the combination of it with the smokiness of the pork really go together perfectly.  I can say, without hesitation, they are the best tacos I have had in this area.   Right behind those, the steak tacos are tender and seasoned perfectly.  You can not go wrong with them either.  As stated, we have had all of the tacos.  If you are in the mood for fish or shrimp, give them a try.  They are great in their own ways.  Last time we had the veggie tacos, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were.

Apps:  Again, another area where they are doing it right.  Guacamole is made fresh, ceviche is decent, albeit a tad acidic.  My kids like the Queso fundido.  This last time though, they blew my socks off with a new corn appetizer, called esquites.  I nearly ordered another for dessert, it was so good!  Roasted sweet corn, lime, mayo, cilantro, all mixed together and served with corn chips.  I will be ordering that the next time we go!

Entrees:  To date, I have only had the  Carne Asada A La Poblana.  As with everything else, excellent.  It was the first dish I ever had here.  I would recommend it.

Drinks:  Numerous margaritas.  Wife loves the Jamaica (Hibiscus) Margarita.  I prefer the Tomatillo Margarita.  Can&#39;t seem to get that elsewhere.  Nice twist on the Margarita.  They have roughly 10 kinds though, so you should find one that fits your liking.

Service:  Never once have we had a problem.  Most of the time it is just my wife and I, but we do take the kids on occasion.  Regardless of how many of us there are, they always treat us politely.  Prices might be a little on the high side, but again, I see this as a more upscale mexican restaurant, than a cheap taqueria.  Bottom line, I have yet to leave this place thinking to myself, &#34;man, that meal was sooooo not worth what I just paid for it.&#34;.  They do an excellent job here and I can&#39;t wait to go back!",08/04/14,362,5,2,5,34,12.158499999999998,7.723999999999999,0.585,34.69100000000001,No,3025

lupitas-cocina-st-charles,Michelle D.,5kGuEWCJhhuRoBXitV727A,8xtRrs2JlzdBW8gFHcoe4w,"So after sitting there for at least 20 minutes we finally received a waitress that started blurting out all of the specials that they had that evening; there are probably about 20 of them and you couldn&#39;t remember any because there were so many. Then we ordered our drinks: a Pacifico beer, a margarita and a kiddie cocktail. After another half hour of waiting for our drinks they forget the kiddie cocktail. I ask her again for it and then we waited another 20 minutes to a half an hour so I could ask her again to bring her drink that finally came.
Our food took forever to get to the table and by this time I am overly annoyed. (Thankfully we order the guacamole appetizer that cost a fortune for the little portion received,) so needless to say we were starving when our food got to the table. I will say the tacos were excellent and my husband&#39;s enchiladas in mole sauce was decent, the last part of our evening topped the cake. After dinner we were sitting there for yet another 20 minutes to a half an hour waiting for the waitress to come over so we can pay our bill. At this point the owner comes over apologizes for the delay but then I still waited for the bill! Now the waitress comes up with a piece of cake as an apology! I just want my damn bill. Needless to say we will not be returning. There is no reason for it to take over 2 hours as there are only about 14 tables in the whole place.

The place is cozy, with a small bar that hosts a bevy of tequilas including Milagro (bonus point).  This place is cute and dimly lit, fairly minimalistic in regards to dcor.
My friend and I each ordered a margarita.  He enjoyed a mango drink while I had pineapple.  The drink was fresh and delicious, and had an ample amount of chile lining the rim of the glass.  I had the Matazlan tacos, which were crispy fish tacos, I believe tilapia but strangely, it was not specified on the menu.  The tacos were good, the portion was sufficient, but they didn&#39;t blow me away.  
The service was impeccable and our server was both friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  I found the food to be less innovative than Bien Trucha, that being the obvious comparison others are making...
Overall, this place is delightful with stellar service, but if you are expecting it to be on par with BT it does slightly fall short.  By no means is it a disappointment, it is just different in ways that are both good and bad.  Less assuming, better service, slightly less innovative, and no excruciatingly long wait or loud atmosphere.

The food was well prepared, not very warm though, but ok. Flavors were kinda bland. Nothing to write home about, or return for more of.

First off- the guacamole.  Lupita&#39;s guacamole should be called &#34;cucumber and tomato garnish&#34;.  It is all cucumber, radish and tomato and hardly NO avocado at all.  Last I checked, guacamole was supposed to primarily be avocado.  Don&#39;t waste your time- it is expensive and NOT worth it.

Second- the atmosphere is very ho-hum.  BORING.  They could have really made the place hip and inviting, but instead they very much fell short.  Feels like a fast food restaurant inside-- with tables and white tablecloths.

The enchiladas suizas was tasty- loved the sauce and the chicken was very tender.  I liked it.  My dining partner had the cochinita pibil and he said it was OK. The sauce that came with it was too hot for him to enjoy and he truly loves very hot food. 

There are some pretty amazing Mexican restaurants in the area (El Mocajete, Bien Trucha and A Todo Madre)  that are pretty comparable to the price, so if Lupita;s wants to excel, they need to step it up on food and atmosphere  and lower their prices a couple of bucks.

wendys-elgin-2,Wes P.,#NAME?,Y2mUNRak-K2cE9Qn1mmNVg,"Everyone,

My own imposed rules for any Chain Restaurant review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Since the food should be the same everywhere, with the exception of regional items, the food category will only be judged on the quality of the expected food (i.e. temperature, consistency, and amount).
3. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Wendy&#39;s - Elgin Southwest

Location/Layout - 4.5/10:  This Wendy&#39;s location can be found on McLean Blvd just south of Route 20, adjacent to a Jiffy Lube.  The interior is usually fairly clean and sports the standard Wendy&#39;s interior, which is not screaming for an update but is showing its ware.  Although, like all Wendy&#39;s the fountain divides the two available registers, one of which is never in use, making getting refills a pain and extremely time consuming for both you and the employees.  Parking is ample and well maintained.        

Service - 5.5/10: The order takers are usually friendly, accommodating and accurate.  The drive through is usually very expedient, especially when compared to other Wendy&#39;s.  The lone issue that I have is the location will make you wait in line for a refill even as they are filling other drink orders.  I personally never jump the line, which is what about every other person that dines in a Wendy&#39;s does, but other locations usually note the reason for your return visit to the counter and address your need while filling other drinks.  

Food - 6/10: In general I prefer Wendy&#39;s as a fast food burger option for both their burgers and chicken.  The burgers are always hot and fresh with the most natural tasting and freshest toppings in the industry.  Chicken sandwiches, especially my industry favorite, Spicy Chicken are usually prepared when ordered at this location instead of sitting precooked and waiting for a taker.  The optional sides, instead of fries are genius and much appreciated, especially given the ample options for a fast food burger joint.  Again the lone issue is that a trip for refills can create cold food upon your return, which hurts the food score for this location.      

Overall Experience - 6/10:  This Wendy&#39;s location offers a fairly solid fast food experience and is usually accommodating and quick to fill orders.  Location, quality, and speed are the main assets of this location especially given my time at the nearby Sports Complex.",15/03/13,296,4,2,4,38,3.0562000000000005,2.7059999999999995,0.435,19.858999999999998,No,2650

Well now Here I am doing the worst bc your store management must have either changed or when the other 3 Wendy&#39;s opened up near by you guys stop giving a fck. Either way I was served a chicken sandwich with cheese and I&#39;m allergic to cheese and the sandwich doesn&#39;t come with cheese normally. Simple mistake in my opinion. However as soon as I go back around to talk the manager they told me to call tomorrow to talk to the store manager about a refund considering I had to buy medicine for my allergic reaction (Yes I have an epi pen and yes I am physically allergic to dairy) The next day I called and was told I would get a small settlement of probably like $20 in the mail once corporate gives me a call. Well 2 weeks go by and I call Wendy&#39;s to make sure they were still planning on calling me and seemingly no one remembered me or my F&#39;d up sandwich I never got to eat. (Considering I still have the meal frozen in my freezer along with pics on my camera with the receipt, I wasn&#39;t worried) They of course once again gave me the run around about receiving a call for a settlement. 2 months go by (yes I still have the food in the freezer) and I&#39;m pissed. Not only did I get the run around for the 3rd time after I called, the manager had the nerve to tell me to bring in my 3 month old receipt and food. Upon doing so they &#34;lost&#34; my receipt and I was left with rotten food I paid $20 for and never ate. I let it go bc I wasn&#39;t getting anywhere with them. Well yesterday (and this why I wrote this review) my aunt went to the same Wendy&#39;s for chicken nuggets which were still frozen in the middle.. She did not go back for a refund and did not complain but %100 deserved a refund for the $ that was once again wasted on your store.

We ordered a 20in Pepperoni pizza at 6:09 pm. We were then promised a delivery time of 45 minutes or less, which is about average for the area.

Unfortunately, that time came and went. We decided to call at 7:10 pm to ask for a status update on our order. The employee on the line stated that the order had been dispatched earlier and should arrive any second. Completely understandable for a busy Sunday night.

The wait continued... No sign of the driver for another 45 minutes. Once again, we decide to check for a status update at 7:55 pm. We were told that the order had been dispatched and should arrive any moment. 

Deja Vu anyone?!?

Pizza finally arrived at 8:00 pm. The delivery driver issued no explanation or apology of any sort. We finally had our pizza at least...

I wish the disappointment ended with the service, but unfortunately it continued with the food... Our pizza was delivered at room temperature, maybe slightly colder than that. The flavor showed alot of potential, but it was simply too hard to judge this pizza due to the temperature it was delivered at...

The silver lining that saved Vini&#39;s from a 1 star review was the $10.00 credit that was offered for our next purchase. Unfortunately, that is a bit on the weak side as far as discounts go, considering I had to fork over $35.00 plus tip for this experience.

I am an understanding man and thus will give Vini&#39;s Pizza one more chance to wow me. 

Maybe a slow weeknight will allow them enough of a chance to get their act together long enough for me to finally grant them a fair judgement...

  As a pizza place, I would say they get the food right, it&#39;s good pizza, no argument.  Is it anything special?  I would argue not really, it&#39;s competent but nothing standout about it, crisp crust and melty cheese with what seemed to be quality toppings.  Taste was good but again, not one of those &#34;how do they do it?!&#34; flavors.

  The thing that bugs the heck out of me about Vini&#39;s is that my pizza cost $38, yes THIRTY-EIGHT dollars for a 3 topping pizza.  I have never in my life paid that much for pizza.  $3 (minimum) per topping is a little high, IMO.  Looking at the menu, I thought, &#34;hmm, $23 bucks is about the going price for a pizza this size, no biggie.&#34; and then as I&#39;m hanging up the phone I have a hallucination that the cashier just quoted me a number somewhere around $40 for a thin disc of bread and cheese with a couple vegetables on it.

vinis-palatine,Sabrina W.,PdmRI-1GikEGse9E03lWjA,BvMyE9--cZh8lPDeREIAJA,"My fianc and I just relocated to the Chicago area from Florida and have been looking for a good takeout pizza joint.  Since Vini&#39;s is close to our home and we pass it pretty often we thought we would give it a shot.  When I called to place our order the gentleman on the phone was very friendly and helpful.  When I explained that this was our first time trying Vini&#39;s he recommended asking the cashier to use the coupons on the box towards this purchase.  When we picked up our pizza we did exactly what he suggested and the cashier was more than happy to do so.  

We decided to try their 16&#34; regular crust with pepperoni, sausage and anchovies (just on one side as I am not an anchovy lover).  Their regular crust is a thin crust which is not usually my first choice in terms of pizza crust.  I gravitate towards a thicker crust although I have to admit that Vini&#39;s was very flavorful and I actually didn&#39;t miss the extra dough.  All the ingredients were very good including the sausage and cheese.  The thick layer of cheese on our pizza really made it stand out from the other ingredients.  All in all we both really enjoyed it and will definitely be returning to try some other items on their menu.",13/09/11,115,4,1,5,7,4.0492,1.468,0.0,9.531999999999998,No,1226

Their jumbo slices and liter of pop are filling, delicious, and really hit the spot and only cost $4 of $4.50 for the special slice.  The layers of toppings on a special slice probably cost Vini&#39;s more than the extra .50, so it&#39;s a great deal for customers if you like jalapenos, pepperoni, sausage, and bacon on your pizza.  Try the pizzarito.  It&#39;s multiple-times better than the best calzone you&#39;ve ever had.  Beefarito is like taking the pizzarito and mixing it with a savory Italian beef sandwich. Also, Vini&#39;s pasta, wings, and salads are delicious.  Their salads are pretty healthy.  Try their Caesar dressing...it&#39;s fantastic!  I&#39;ll recommend my favorite specialty pizza: the Caesar Thin-Crust. 

Aside from the food, the service is great, too.  The employees work hard and know their trade.  The owners are especially nice and friendly.

When the delivery guy told me the price I thought he had the wrong order.  When I inquired about the price he told me that it was his first day delivering for Vini&#39;s and he had already asked the staff twice if they had the right price on several of the pizza&#39;s they gave him because the receipts were so expensive.  He was worried no one was going to tip him because of the prices.  I gave the guy $5 because it&#39;s not his fault.

They also forgot to print out a credit card receipt even though I gave them all of my credit card information over the phone.  The delivery guy had to call and they told him they&#39;d call him back cause they were busy.   I just ended up writing my credit card number on the back of the receipt after five minutes of waiting for them to call back which they didn&#39;t.

I ordered the fries mushrooms app, a thin crust margherita pizza and a glass of the house red wine.

The mushrooms are standard frozen pre battered veggies and as expected.

I was highly disappointed, with both the pizza and wine.

The pizza had some sad under ripe thin slices of tomato on a crust that was neither thin or thick, instead it had the worst characteristics of both - chewy, tough, doughy and flavorless.

The wine was a red blend and was barely drinkeable.

On the plus, the patio was gorgeous and a great place to hangout.

Subpar pizza and poor wine selection ruined this for me.

choochs-pizzeria-elgin,Dachs K.,W1B5irsU3ka7H5HVEywGxA,AFjckczIHCBIlLBeAx_V1g,"3.5 stars.

The staff is great: friendly, prompt. The environment and decor are great (the sign graphics are pretty awful though; could stand to hire a real professional for that). And I applaud the restaurant for being part of the revitalization of downtown Elgin. Additionally, there is a good selection of beers. I would go back for these reasons.

But the food just isn&#39;t special. The dough nuggets, which other reviews raved about, were underwhelming. Too chewy.

We had a pan pizza. Lots of dough on the bottom crust, no high edge, and not enough cheese. It&#39;s sort of the way they try to make pan pizza in California: you take a thin crust, and then just add a bunch of dough to the bottom, without changing anything else. I make better pan pizza at home, and I&#39;m shit for cooking.

We also tried a focaccia sandwich. The bread was dry, but the innards of the thing were pretty good. Decent chicken actually. Still, nothing to write home about, and they should pile it on more. I also agree with an earlier review that said the portions are weird. The standard sandwich plate is a sandwich and a small dish of coleslaw. Fries should just come with that, but instead you pay $1.00 extra and the fries replace the coleslaw. I don&#39;t really care that much about price, but it&#39;s still unusual.

I really want to like the restaurant, because the people seem nice. But I can&#39;t imagine this place lasting much longer. They were half-empty during Thursday primetime. I&#39;m actually surprised they&#39;ve made it three years - the place has that slightly awkward, empty feel of just having opened. Perhaps their patio is a big enough draw in the warm months that they can make it through the winter.",29/10/15,209,3,1,4,2,3.083300000000001,2.8730000000000007,1.346,21.78,No,1721

choochs-pizzeria-elgin,John M.,rh2n2TyrOgFa0C8dpKiHtA,vkxNCt63jjClDH9cP_mNxA,"Visited Chooch&#39;s last night and got there around 6. Place was fairly crowded but I found a table. Little did I know that they scheduled a presentation from the Elgin Historical Society and the place would end up packed. They really should have put up a notice about the event.

While waiting for my family to arrive I had to wait approximately 15 minutes for my server to visit the table to get my beer order. After I ordered it the rest of my family sat down. In another 15 minutes a gentleman who may have been the bartender delivered my beer (hint - when you order a craft beer bring a beer glass along).

After another 15 minutes (I&#39;m not exaggerating about these wait times) our server came and took our orders.

The three of us ordered ravioli and a caprese salad. While waiting for our food my family members also had to wait for a server to take their drink order.

The food came out and was fairly good. I then ordered another beer and more Cokes for my wife and daughter. They eventually did get their soft drinks but by the time I finished my meal my beer still hadn&#39;t arrived.

During the entire experience the presentation from the Historical Society was going on which prevented us from having any sort of discussion because of the volume. In addition a woman came out of nowhere and asked if we would share our table with a stranger. I&#39;m not sure if she worked at Chooch&#39;s or not. We respectfully declined because we were eating out as a family and were trying to have a discussion.

I was getting frustrated so my wife just told me to go grab a seat at the Dog Paws pub next door. She would close out the bill and join me there.

I guess my beer finally did get to the table but there was no one there to drink it. So I paid for a drink that I didn&#39;t receive. Hope someone there enjoyed it.

It was clear that the restaurant scheduled this event without taking into consideration the extra help they would need. As I mentioned before it would have also been nice if they would have posted a notice on the door that this event was taking place so folks like us could decide if it was the proper time for us to visit.

I have never received such poor service at a restaurant where a manager didn&#39;t eventually walk over  to apologize and explain what the issues were. The only person we spoke with was the young woman taking our orders who explained that she wasn&#39;t normally a server. I do have to say she was polite.

I guess  Chooch&#39;s is participating a pub crawl tonight. I hope they have the staff to cover it. I&#39;m certainly not going to be there.",25/09/15,258,1,2,4,12,3.6965,2.6710000000000003,0.472,25.857,No,2604

Their appetizers are above-average to excellent. Dough nuggets are about the most sinfully good thing you can find south of the Wisconsin border. The deep-dish pizza is massively under-rated.

Their focaccia sandwiches are, according to my wife, incredible. This is the restaurant TGIFridays goes to bed dreaming it could be. And the owner is incredibly nice, to boot.
Go here. Spend your money. If it isn&#39;t everything I described, then come back and try again. The greatest thing about this place is that no one is trying to whitewash their feelings with a disingenuous smile and twenty-three &#34;pieces of flair.&#34; It&#39;s dining how it should be...sharing time with those you are close to, want to be closer to, or just passing through your life.

Chooch&#39;s Pizzeria 

Location/Layout - 7/10:  Located on Grove, directly north of the River Boat and along the soon to be completed River Walk in Downtown Elgin.  The interior has been completely built out new for this establishment and sports a very clean and modern feel, along with a lot of charm.  The exposed brick walls and wood bar are very nicely decorated and compliment the overall theme.  There is a first floor dine in area along with an upstairs that is currently being used exclusively for private events.  Chooch&#39;s is currently building an outdoor pation/beer garden that will connect the restaurant to the river walk and allow an al fresco dining experience.  Parking may be the lone issue as there is street parking available in front but spaces are extremely limited and used by several other businesses in the area also.  The public lots are available within walking distance both to the north and south of the restaurant.   

Menu - 5/10:  The menu is by no means overwhelming and offers pizza, apps, pasta, sandwiches, and a limited salad and desert selection.  There are always weekly specials that may be unique offerings or combinations of current menu items.  While the menu is extensive enough to keep most patrons satisfied, they currently only offer their pizza in two odd sizes; thin is offered in 12&#34; or 15&#34; and the deep dish is available in 9&#34; and 13&#34;.  This can pose an issue when ordering for a large group or trying to split a pizza between more than 2 guests.  Additionally, they are in desperate need of a drink menu especially showing their beer offerings and pricing.  

Service - 6/10: Our servers are usually efficient and friendly.  They have always been knowledgeable about the menu when asked with the exception of not knowing all the available beer selection and pricing.    

Food - 7/10:  In full disclosure we have always eaten pizza when we have gone to Chooch&#39;s.  I am looking forward to trying other items at some point but since they are a pizzeria, this is why we have come to Chooch&#39;s.  Fortunately, the pizza is very good, with fresh toppings and a good cheese ratio.  The thin crust is thicker than standard Chicago style thin but is crispy on the bottom with a nice chew and breadieness to make it unique.  It is served table side on a pizza riser and is always piping hot.  

Drinks - 5.5/10:  Chooch&#39;s offers a full service bar area with mixers, beers, wine and soft drinks.  Unfortunately, they do not have a libations menu and prices are unknown unless you ask or wait for the bill. 

Overall Experience - 7/10:  Chooch&#39;s offers a solid selection and some very good pizza.  They are a great addition to the newly expanded downtown Elgin dining scene and are convenient to all the amenities such as the River Boat, Hemmens, and The Centre.  They offer a comfortable dining experience with a few TVs for viewing sporting events but will really shine when they are able to complete their patio and have a new River walk for patrons to enjoy.",31/05/13,396,4,3,5,51,5.066,3.5250000000000004,0.77,27.705,No,3576

Location/Layout - 7/10:  Located on Grove, directly north of the River Boat and along the soon to be completed River Walk in Downtown Elgin.  The interior has been completely built out new for this establishment and sports a very clean and modern feel, along with a lot of charm.  The exposed brick walls and wood bar are very nicely decorated and compliment the overall theme.  There is a first floor dine in area along with an upstairs that is currently being used exclusively for private events.  Chooch&#39;s is currently building an outdoor pation/beer garden that will connect the restaurant to the river walk and allow an al fresco dining experience.  Parking may be the lone issue as there is street parking available in front but spaces are extremely limited and used by several other businesses in the area also.  The public lots are available within walking distance both to the north and south of the restaurant.   

Menu - 5/10:  The menu is by no means overwhelming and offers pizza, apps, pasta, sandwiches, and a limited salad and desert selection.  There are always weekly specials that may be unique offerings or combinations of current menu items.  While the menu is extensive enough to keep most patrons satisfied, they currently only offer their pizza in two odd sizes; thin is offered in 12&#34; or 15&#34; and the deep dish is available in 9&#34; and 13&#34;.  This can pose an issue when ordering for a large group or trying to split a pizza between more than 2 guests.  Additionally, they are in desperate need of a drink menu especially showing their beer offerings and pricing.  

Service - 6/10: Our servers are usually efficient and friendly.  They have always been knowledgeable about the menu when asked with the exception of not knowing all the available beer selection and pricing.    

Food - 7/10:  In full disclosure we have always eaten pizza when we have gone to Chooch&#39;s.  I am looking forward to trying other items at some point but since they are a pizzeria, this is why we have come to Chooch&#39;s.  Fortunately, the pizza is very good, with fresh toppings and a good cheese ratio.  The thin crust is thicker than standard Chicago style thin but is crispy on the bottom with a nice chew and breadieness to make it unique.  It is served table side on a pizza riser and is always piping hot.  

Drinks - 5.5/10:  Chooch&#39;s offers a full service bar area with mixers, beers, wine and soft drinks.  Unfortunately, they do not have a libations menu and prices are unknown unless you ask or wait for the bill. 

Overall Experience - 7/10:  Chooch&#39;s offers a solid selection and some very good pizza.  They are a great addition to the newly expanded downtown Elgin dining scene and are convenient to all the amenities such as the River Boat, Hemmens, and The Centre.  They offer a comfortable dining experience with a few TVs for viewing sporting events but will really shine when they are able to complete their patio and have a new River walk for patrons to enjoy.",31/05/13,396,4,3,5,51,5.066,3.5250000000000004,0.77,27.705,No,3576

The service was crazy slow and we asked for no cheese on a pizza bc we were dining with two vegans and the pizza of course came out with cheese, waited an hour off the replacement and no comps at all.  Drinks also took 15 minutes to arrive. That&#39;s insane! I was a waitress for 4 years and if two people couldn&#39;t eat dinner with the others, I would definitely comp that food.  I am here on vacation and the environment was great, but that service was just some of the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced. She also charged is for an extra soda we didn&#39;t have at the end of all this.  Very disappointing to have spent money here at all.",09/07/14,71,1,1,-2,-31,-2.1243,0.224,1.5170000000000001,6.26,No,717

Went on a Sunday for some pizza and beer.  My boyfriend and I ordered two separate pizzas, he wanted to try the specialty pizza w/ bbq sauce, sausage etc where I&#39;m more of a plain eater and just ordered cheese and pepperoni.  The pizza was delicious and the service was good.  A man who I believe is the owner or manager even stopped to chat with customers as they were eating while he was cleaning up some things outside.  Thankfully it was a beautiful day and we were able to take advantage of the patio area.

Our food was quite tasty; calimari, Chooch&#39;s salad, and pizza. Very reasonable prices - I&#39;m not sure what a previous reviewer was possibly expecting, or ordering, but the prices are actually lower than I&#39;d expect from similar establishments. 

The owners were friendly and obviously excited about their new venture. And they should be - they&#39;ve done a great job.

We definitely will be back!",29/12/12,68,5,1,3,9,2.7725999999999997,1.861,0.151,3.9880000000000004,No,626
choochs-pizzeria-elgin,Aletta J.,DX4S3hyVBQJ1KkU9xkvHtg,AXGnj-znXU8eY20xWXwdxw,"Oh boy. I had high expectations. I heard the pizza was great and that they had a gluten free option for the DH. Went with a group of friends and were seated right away. We had a server who didn&#39;t know up from down and I am sure she was just overwhelmed because they were BUSY. But... we all wanted separate checks and there should be a system for that (number, name, symbol, whatever...) our pizza took forever and yes, it was hot, real ingredients, and the gluten free was decent. The crust was really chewy (I am a Monical&#39;s fiend -- cracker for me all the way) so maybe it&#39;s a NY style thing?? Our friend waited at least 45 minutes after us for her pizza. I felt so bad for her. The MGR stepped in and apologized, but after almost 1 hour waiting for a check we almost dined and dashed. Probably should have. 

I think it&#39;s a great place to go for a casual lunch or early dinner when it&#39;s not so overwhelming to the staff. The ingredients were fresh, the salad was good and the beer selection had a few IPAs, which, they had no beer list; I had to walk to the bar to look at the bottles. Suggestion: create one in Word and get it printed. You can do two on a page and print them out. 

Clean, open and because of the high ceilings, exposed brick and wood/hard floor, it&#39;s going to be noisy.  Best of luck!",19/03/13,153,2,1,5,-9,4.8801,2.863,0.692,13.445,No,1331

The decor is great and creates a nice, welcoming feeling with interesting pictures on the wall. There were a few TVs to catch the end of the game, but the volume was low enough were actually able to have a conversation.

The food was excellent, and all homemade. Everything tasted very fresh. We ordered mozzarella sticks and were pleasantly surprised to find they&#39;d been hand-breaded - delicious. Chooch&#39;s only does a thin crust, made in-house, and it was great. The owner came out to talk to us and feedback, which is so important. 

The bill was very fair for two ($34ish), and included mozzarella sticks, a beer for each, and a 15&#34; pizza that generated enough leftovers for both of us. 

They had signs for a $5 weekday lunch special that includes a slice of pizza and either a soup or salad.

Every single topping and ingredient was fresh and delicious. I really could not get over the freshness in the ingredients through each slice. The crust was good.

Dan the owner says that he gets his fresh ingredients from the fancy schmancy JK lol he has a great sense of humor. 

Back to the cheese sticks....Home made, they cut the pizza cheese into little rectangles, their breading has the right mix of bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. 

The marinara sauce is also aaaahmazing. Fresh homemade, saucy with chunks of tomatoes. 

Just shared a focaccia chipotle sndwich with tater tots, margarita pizza (half with pepperoni) very good. Super good.

Unfortunately, we were not allowed to sit outside because we were just two people, and they did not want to let us take a 4-top.  We must have visited at a bad time, because it took about 25 minutes for us to get water and the wine I ordered, even though there were wait staff standing around.   Our waitress was new and inexperienced but nice.  Our food came out before our water did.  Apparently there was some problem with the computer freezing up on the orders.  My penne rigate with meatballs was very good; the meatballs tasted homemade. However, the bread and salad came at the same time as the entree.   My husband ordered calamari and minestrone and they were o.k.   The people next to us ordered pizza, which looked good and they said it was good.  Their order of a second pizza got messed up, though.   Prices were reasonable for the portions we got.

The place is clean, beautifully done, honors the charachter of the space it occupies with its decor. I know the place is new, but the servers knew very little about the food. Pizza sizes turned out to be a mere 12&#34; and 15&#34;. No deep dish or Chicago style on the menu... Tried to order thick crust and was informed they were &#34; not set up for it yet.&#34; Ordered chicken finger appetizer, a 15 inch that was supposed to be extra cheese, pepperoni and bacon, and a 12 inch sausage/black olive for my kids. Appetizer arrived in a timely manner, pizzas out shortly after. Extra cheese wound up on the kids pie, when I pointed it out I was offered a beer, promptly denied by me with kids in tow. The pizza was at best bar quality, not really a product you&#39;d expect to find as the cornerstone of a pizza parlor. Crust super thin, sauce from a can, like an overpriced Tombstone, you know, like from your grocers freezer? The service was attentive and prompt, drink never went empty. I took some strain of pasta home for the Mrs.( penne?) which went unfinished. Until the dog got it (sound of Gordon Ramsay describing a dog&#39;s dinner echoing through my head). In the interest of fairness, I will dissect this review. The restaurant appearance- 5 stars. Service- 5 stars. Food quality and presentation- 1/2 star. Almost $60 dollar bill for a combined 20 inches of pizza, a pasta dish, and an appetizer that took 4 min to prepare in a deep fryer. I won&#39;t turn this into a commercial for competitors, but the owners would be well suited to order from some other nearby establishments, do an unbiased comparison, and ask themselves if they honestly think their product is remarkable enough to motivate people to brave downtown Elgin&#39;s poor parking and shady characters .

On my most recent trip, I stopped in to use my free bowl/salad/etc. from a Yelp Elite event I attended, and they were very pleasant about that. I order various things when I go to noodles- but my favorites are the BBQ Chicken Salad (summer only usually) which comes with corn- delicious, the Chicken Ceasar Salad, and a Penne Pasta dish that is a bit spicy. I also always enjoy using the drink machines where you can &#34;create your own&#34;, and this Noodles location has one of those. Finally, I usually treat myself to one of the giant rice krispie treats that lasts me several meals- not too sweet, and very fairly priced.

noodles-and-company-elgin,Wes P.,#NAME?,xyX1zte7ZOlMhrMXXSBSjA,"Everyone,

My own imposed rules for any Chain Restaurant review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Since the food should be the same everywhere, with the exception of regional items, the food category will only be judged on the quality of the expected food (i.e. temperature, consistency, and amount).
3. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Noodles and Company - Elgin

Location/Layout - 5.5/10:  Conveniently located on the Northeast corner of Bowes and Randall Road, adjacent to the Menards in Elgin.  The interior has a modern design and is very spacious.  The eating area is typically neatly kept as is the fountain area and counter.  Noodles and Company also offers al fresco dining during certain times of year directly in front of the restaurant.  The issues with the interior are that the tables are starting to have the Formica wear out which makes them feel sticky.  Additionally, there is always two log jambs that occur at this particular Noodles and Company.  First, is the fact that the very short order line starts immediately upon entering from the western facing main door.  The second back up occurs because Noodles now offers one of the new single, thousand flavor, Coke fountains which bewilders people like it is written in Latin and causes kids to make mad scientist concoctions that take upwards of 10 minutes to complete.  Unfortunately, the fountain is next to the order counter making the back ups at times horrendous.       

Service - 5/10: Service at the counter is usually efficient on the Noodles end.  Although some people stare at the order board like it is one of those 3D pictures from the mall.  Orders are almost always correct and are brought to your table, although we have had the number system fail us and confuse the delivery person on a couple of occasions.    

Food - 6.5/10: The food at this location is always hot and fresh.  In general this is more upscale quick service and is prepared on demand with tasty ingredients.  The combinations offer a great amount of variety and the addition of several salad, soup, and even sandwich options has created a very rounded product offering.  The individual protein options leave something to be desired in taste, texture, and quality when compared to the veggies and noodles.  Additionally, they do not always compliment the bowls very well and are a costly add on.  Pricing overall is very reasonable, with the exception of the proteins and some side items, and I feel that bread or something along side they noodles should be included and not charged extra.

Overall Experience - 6/10:  Noodles is a very good quick service option.  They offer above average fair, including libations for those looking to indulge, with a freshness that you can taste and see.  All this can be had at reasonable prices in a decent and clean environment.",10/04/13,346,3,2,4,20,3.246800000000001,3.1510000000000002,0.972,24.878,No,3088

We tried the nachos with chicken, a chorizo gordita &amp; a dinner dish called &#34;Alambre con Queso&#34; - which was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese - very good &amp; the steak was perfectly seasoned and tender.  The dinner came with beans and rice which were decent, and also tortillas.  The menu did not say it came with tortillas but it makes sense that it would.  Since I didn&#39;t know it was included they gave me corn tortillas so if you prefer flour you will want to specify.  The nachos and gordita were also good.

Prices were in line with other local Mexican take-out places.

tacos-el-norte-lake-zurich,Mike M.,W2zno-nXaGa9Y2Au7L8wNA,0h2xJ5xwU0afMNWD99EpqQ,"Tacos El Norte is a hidden gem tucked away in a strip mall. When my friend first brought me here, I didn&#39;t really have high expectations, but boy was I wrong! Ever since then, this is a regular in our work lunch rotation. 

When you first walk in, you see the guys working the grill and immediately smell all the awesome meat they&#39;re grilling up. There&#39;s booths in the front and then a bigger seating area in the back. It&#39;s kind of a sit down restaurant where there&#39;s a waitress but at the end you can just bring your check up to the cashier and tell him your table number.

While waiting for your food, they bring out some pretty good chips and two kinds of salsa. There&#39;s definitely a little heat on the red salsa. As for the food, I&#39;ve tried a good chunk of the menu offered here. Usually when I go to Chipotle or Qdoba, I&#39;m never satisfied with the amount of meat they put in my burrito. That&#39;s definitely not a problem at el norte. They definitely don&#39;t skimp on the filling. The burritos are packed with plenty of meat and cheese, almost bordering on too much meat (I never thought I&#39;d ever say that in my life!). The chicken a la coca cola is one of my favorite fillings. It&#39;s super flavorful and has a really good spicy kick to it. Another favorite item of mine is the torpedo burrito, which has steak, onions, cheese, and a fried egg stuffed in a burrito. 

They offer different variations of their burritos. Suizo means the burrito comes covered with melted cheese and some red sauce. El papi is basically a super sized burrito. The first time I was here, we thought el papi would be no problem for a group of young hungry guys. We were all defeated waving our white flags at the end of the meal. It was pretty much the size of my forearm and like I said earlier, it was jam packed with meat and cheese. It can easily be two meals worth of food. 

Overall, el norte has quality food for a meal that&#39;s under $10.",06/11/14,231,4,1,5,7,4.914000000000001,3.6980000000000004,0.742,19.56,No,1973

My family lived 2 miles away from this place for over 10 years and we never ate here until 2 years before we moved from Chicago to Denver. While Denver is a much better place to live than Chicago I really miss cheap and easy eats like this place. Tacos el Norte is just plain awesome. The food is fresh, cheap and so tasty! I really miss my $2 bean and Rajas (grilled poblano) tacos. It was spicy and so flavorful. Their enchiladas, nachos and burritos are so good. We left too much emotional baggage behind in chicago so we will probably not return, not even for a visit. But if time heals wounds and we did come for a visit back to Barrington/Lake Zurich you can bet that tacos el Norte would be a part of that visit.

The service, ambience, and food were all executed well enough to make this dive restaurant one to remember and return to.

The Torpedo Burrito is amazing and highly recommended. Steak, cheese, onions, a fried egg (make sure that the yolk is runny) wrapped in a browned and crisp flour tortilla - amazing. 

The combination plate was also excellent. 

The restaurant was fairly busy when we were there yet service was fast. I will say that the waitress did provide us with one of the most unhelpful recommendations I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. My friend asked what was good there and what she would recommend and she proceeded to basically tell us what was on the menu instead of recommend dishes to us. We laughed it off though, and it&#39;s not going to detract from the 5 star rating I&#39;m giving this place since they really blew me away with their food.

You will know if you are close by the volume of cars in the parking lot. The place was packed and most folks seemed pleased. The evening we were there (Saturday) there was a mariachi trio working the room. They did a great job too, tips much appreciated. There is a lot going on in regards to food options. You can work from the specials or you can work from the menu. The cool part is you can mix match as you please. So if you want to get three taco dinner but want one taco to have chorizo, one to have coca cola chicken and one to have whatever, you can totally get it your way. I like that kind of flexibility. From my brief single experience though, I would recommend what my wife did, skip the corn tortillas and get the coca cola chicken as a salad.

Salsa: very watery
Tamales: Ordered 3, all the tamales pulled apart as we opened the husks.  The masa was clumpy and sticking to the husks.  These were either under cooked or left over from the previous day.
Enchiladas: Ordered chorizo with mole sauce, the chorizo was burned, not well done...burned.  The mole was bland and disappointing.  

Overall, the best thing on the plate were the beans, which probably came from a can.  I have only one lingering question: How can a mexican restaurant screw up mexican food?  Oh...I weep for &#34;los gringos ignorantes&#34;.

Although everything was very tasty, and I might go back if I were in the area, I didn&#39;t think it was quite as spectacular as some of the reviews made it out to be. 

We sat in the room on the far left of the restaurant because the main room to the right of the entrance was full. However, our service was kind of slow, and our waitress never brought us our waters (we think she thought we only wanted the margaritas instead of both). I got my usual steak tacos (I get them at every Mexican restaurant we go to), and they were mighty tasty, probably Top 20ish of all the tacos I&#39;ve ever eaten. My husbands fajitas were a little smaller than most restaurants, but it was sufficient. Their margaritas though were very tasty, we got the strawberry ones and I would highly recommend them. 

The overall ambiance of the environment was well themed with murals on the walls, and such. But the fluorescent lighting was not quite right, would have liked a little warmer light (more yellowish). It&#39;s personal preference.

Although our service was a little slow, and we never got our waters, this is definitely a place to check out if you&#39;re in the area and looking for good Mexican food.",05/09/14,145,4,2,4,14,3.102,1.062,0.0,9.938,No,1311
