I have been getting so many coupons for this place, so we gave it a try. We ordered the Family Feast: a tray of mostaccoli, a try of salad, and a try of breadsticks and for ~$25. We had tons of leftovers, I&#39;d say it could feed 6 in one sitting. 
The pasta sauce was a bit bland, I added seasoning to my which helped a bit. Sadly, I ordered meat sauce and got regular marinara, so maybe the meat has more flavor. 
The salad, I upgraded to a chopped, was awesome! Similar to other chopped salads, but super fresh and an excellent house balsamic creamy vinaigrette. A must try. 
The breadsticks are also really good. They must be fried then baked, or something. They come with a huge side of marinara, but we&#39;re also awesome in the dressing.

Previously a stellar, delicious establishment has turned into a second rate, cheapened shell of its former self.

My wife and I have been ordering/dining here for 5 years, always fantastic food, service..and when the occasional mistake happened, it was rectified instantly with an apology.

Fast forward to tonight, an online order for a simple pizza produced the most hideous, charred, overcooked pizza I&#39;ve ever seen. This was actually approved by the location as an acceptable order? I brought it home and almost choked on my drink as I opened it.

I call the place back, yes of course after being routed to a manager they agree to remake it, but is that all? A simple apology or credit towards the next meal should have been offered in this day and age where choices are abound on every corner. It appears that management here expect disappointment, quick to just dismiss it with a replacement.

The pizza used to be very good, and salads above average. However, in the past year the pizza crust edge is often burned (not just brown but black), the dough often has big, burnt bubbles in it (anyone who has worked at a pizza place for more than five minutes knows the baker is supposed to pop those during cooking!), the salads have gone down in quality, with brown lettuce, less ingredients, and less fresh. That is, if you can get them to bring it to you. The last 3 orders, at least one item was missed with delivery. Never an offer of compensation, never anything but an implied &#34;here is your food. You can let everything else get cold while I go back and get the rest of your order&#34;. Did I mention this was the last 3 orders in a row??

Macianos has been consistent at one thing over the years: driving up prices. &#34;Medium pizza? You mean you want more than 1 topping on that? How&#39;s 25 bucks sound?&#34;  Maybe if I pay extra I could get one that isn&#39;t burnt or get my entire order delivered...

They were always good, with fast service and delicious pizza. It&#39;s unfortunate, but over the last few years the place has just gone downhill.

Pizza delivery is now hit-or-miss. Sometimes your pizza is ok, sometimes it&#39;s burnt, and sometimes your order is wrong, or they are missing something from your order. A few times I have called to complain (especially about a burnt pizza) and the manager on duty has comped a pizza. That&#39;s all well and good, but the times I have called because we were missing parts of our order - sometimes they forgot our soda, other times they forgot some of the food like wings or bread sticks. The only remedy in those instances has been for the driver to go back and bring us what we ordered.  If it was food, it&#39;s brought cold. Never a complimentary dessert, or comped item, or coupon - which I feel should be offered in those instances. They didn&#39;t do their job and the only thing they do is bring what they should have included the first time they delivered. Experiences like that really leave a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended) and I&#39;m less likely to offer them repeat business.

I&#39;ve been hesitant in that past about trying a new pizza place, but recommendations on other places from friends make me question why I stick with Maciano&#39;s. I&#39;ll be trying new places in the future.",21/02/15,152,2,1,1,-13,0.4917999999999999,1.0879999999999999,0.915,11.996000000000002,No,1461
macianos-pizza-and-pastaria-elgin-2,Matthew H.,NMF_y2WVfp5ByB6fBFkHXA,c0m1zDfc-VDdpVWdZuKhXQ,"I hate to be writing this review and giving this place only 1-star, but it is what it is ...

When Maciano&#39;s is having a good day, the food is absolutely awesome.  The pizza (notably the sausage and sauce) is delicious, especially their deep dish.  Their entrees are quite good: for instance chicken parm has very generous portions with pasta.  We used to spend at least $200.00 a month there.

So what&#39;s the problem, right?

The problem, in two words: QUALITY CONTROL ... As in, there is none.

We are pretty forgiving in most cases.  We live 2 miles (4 minutes) away from the Elgin location, however, more times than not, the pizza is delivered cold and soggy.  Sometimes the top is burnt to a crisp and the bottom/crust is a nasty, wet-mess.  Sometimes the pizza is crispy on the bottom, cooked perfectly and delicious.  Sometimes they get your whole order right; usually they don&#39;t.

Our last experience with Maciano&#39;s was this: we order 1 large thin crust, half onions and pepperoni/ half cheese.  1 large deep dish with sausage, onions and mushrooms. 1 large chicken chopped salad with bleu cheese crumbles on the side.

We received: (1hr 20 min later) 1 large soggy, rubbery thin crust with half pepperoni the other half onions.  One cold, soggy, clumpy deep dish (which looked as it had been dropped) and one salad, covered in bleu cheese crumbles with rancid, spoiled chicken on the side.  
Two people at a few bites of the chicken and those same two people were throwing up for 24-hours and 72-hours later, still have gut-rot and diarrhea. 

Maciano&#39;s isn&#39;t cheap either.  $55+ for 16-inch dish dish and thin crust, only to get a soggy mess which results in food poisoning ....

.... It&#39;s really a shame.  If this place took a little bit more pride in it&#39;s food and paid attention to the details, it would easily be one of the best.

**Edit**

Well I&#39;ve moved this up to a 3-star from 1-star, as in the past 6 months, they&#39;ve seem to up&#39;d their game, a little.  Beware though -- I&#39;ve found that the food quality is WAY BETTER during off-peak hours, on off-peak days.  If I order a pizza at 4:30 pm on a, say, Tuesady, it&#39;s the best damn, 5-star pizza ever.  If I order a pizza at 6:30 pm on a Friday .... who knows what kind of mess I&#39;ll get .... so 3-star.",03/03/15,303,3,2,3,20,2.6080000000000005,2.6910000000000003,1.581,19.729,No,2323

I was pleasantly surprised by friendly conversation and enjoyed the company briefly as I dined alone.

The location is perfect for me.  The building is in a strip mall off 20.  The way they laid out their seating and floor plan simply works for what they got.  You can only do so much when you want a kitchen, check-out area, dining area, and have enough room left where the waitresses and waiters don&#39;t get too caught up in traffic.

1) Overpriced: Every menu item read at least $2-$5 more than I thought it should be, especially for the quality and portions. For example, my husband&#39;s teeny tiny eggplant sandwich hosted two minuscule, silver dollar sized medallions and rang up at $8. 

2) Understaffed: I&#39;ll give a nod to our server who did mention that she was the only staff member there that afternoon (1pm on a Saturday)...so she did give us a head&#39;s up.

When we arrived, the place was virtually empty. We were seated immediately and because we were in a rush, our order was placed almost soon. A gluten free menu was not available which would have been nice for us as we have a gluten free need. A large pizza was ordered as was a dinner salad. The food arrived very timely and definitely was hot. The salad we got was the Spinach-Gorgonzola and it was good, but the walnuts seemed to be coated in powered sugar?? 

The pizza was fresh and hot. One of the distinguishing factors for this place for me is their crust. Not being a big thin crust fan, the crust is important. Every other time I&#39;ve had it it was crispy and delicious. Today it was soggy and slightly undercooked. The toppings were good and abundant.

I love how they offer a Caprese salad as a side for only about $4, I always want one at other restaurants but no one will share so I have to pay and eat too much everytime, this was perfect! They also have complimentary bread and they serve it with olive oil and parm. cheese, my favorite! The only reason it gets a four is the server took a while to get to our table, but once they did they were very friendly and attentive.

Its a cute restaurant with reasonable prices. I had the linguine pasta with bolognese sauce,  and it was very good. I love Italian food, so its hard to please my tastes. They do a wonderful job.

macianos-pizza-and-pastaria-elgin-2,Vee O.,c4n2oo3lHznopZyIs2UBJg,4NZFNvHlHddqibrYv9WXtg,My family of 5 have dined and ordered delivery many of times since we live very close to this restaurant. They are very inconsistent with the taste of the food. Today we ordered 2 different side salads that are now 6.95 each for a small container. Usually we don&#39;t mind paying that much for a side salad but today the portion size was so off I thought it was a joke. Literally so little that it was comical. We also ordered 2 types of pasta and it was so flavorless I threw it out. The calamari was so oily we couldn&#39;t even eat it. These are all things we have ordered before and have been satisfied with. On top of that they forgot my dessert order and when I called to let them know (this wasn&#39;t the first time...happens almost every time) they were rude and asked if my husband could go back and get it. Who does that?  I finally just asked for a credit to my card. This place has gone down hill BIG time. Last time I&#39;ll ever order. They have little kids working there that don&#39;t know what they are doing. Nothing negative towards the kids. It&#39;s not their fault management doesn&#39;t train them. I hope you guys read this and actually do something about it.

So the first time I had Maciano&#39;s was from the Rockford location almost two weeks ago (see other review).  It was a delightfully appealing experience for my palate from beginning to end.  I couldn&#39;t wait to go back.

Too bad great service wasn&#39;t consistent among the locations.  Now don&#39;t get me wrong, the pizza was good, and the breadsticks were right on, but I am less than impressed with the service.

OK, so it was a Wednesday night, and the husband suggested pizza for dinner.  I had a craving for deep dish, so I told him to call in our order.  He calls, and is informed right away that they are out of deep dish pizza.  Really?  How does that even happen?!  So needless to say, we didn&#39;t order and I was highly disappointed :(

two days later, we were having friends over for poker night.  Maciano&#39;s got brought up, and we figured we would give this location another shot!  I ordered online (great process, btw, and you get 10% off of your first order).  Since we were out of their delivery range, I had the option to choose pickup.  We had it set for 6:45.  My dear, darling husband was the designated go-fer.

He calls me at 7 and tells me the place is a MADHOUSE, and that they keep telling him &#34;five more minutes&#34; , &#34;three more minutes&#34;, &#34;just a little while longer&#34;.  meanwhile, I am on the computer where you can &#34;track&#34; your pizza&#39;s progress (AWESOME concept, btw) and it said it was &#34;MADE&#34; already.  So I don&#39;t really understand the disconnect there.

Well our food was finally ready at 7:15, so 30 minutes after we were told.  But my husband said that we made it out good.  I guess it was crazy there, and there were some VERY pissed off and disappointed people there swearing and upset.  So I guess it could have been worse.

As for the food, it was still pretty solid, BUT...they got some of our order wrong.  Such as, I got the side salad with just tomatoes and onions, and it came with a everything and the wrong dressing.  And our pizza wasn&#39;t well-done like we had ordered, either.

However, the pepperoni was good, the deep dish sausage was still VERY delicious, my salad was good (what I was able to pick around, that is) and the breadsticks were SO good.  They are fluffy and flavorful.  So delicious!

For dessert, we got the delicious cookies, but we also ordered the banana xangos just to switch it up a bit.  they were an interesting concept, but WAY too heavy on the cinnamon.  And I LOVE me some cinnamon.  If it had been mixed with the sugar a little more and THEN rolled in that mixture, it would have been way better!

So I am not saying I won&#39;t order from Maciano&#39;s again, but I think they&#39;ve had enough of my business for right now.",25/12/11,326,3,3,5,56,5.1498,4.741999999999999,1.9059999999999997,27.350999999999996,No,2889

need to find restaurants with take-out or delivery. I&#39;ve tried all
of the Italian places in the Elgin area and just discovered
Macianos.

My first order was on Saturday, 8/10/13. Being intrigued by
their menu claim which boasted &#34;huge&#34; desserts at costs of
$5 -6.50, I decided to order three individual items--chocolate
cake, banana carmel cheesecake xangos and tiramisu. The
xangos and cake were sizable and quite good. The tiramisu
was flat out one of the best I&#39;ve ever had and was about four
times the size of those offered by their competitors. The
reason for purchasing desserts only, was to augment my
already planned dinner of filet mignon and sea scallops.

My second order was placed on Sunday, 8/11/13. It
consisted of a very generous portion of lasagna with meat
sauce and, of course, another tiramisu. Again, I was pleased
with the quality and freshness.

But, I did notice it and one day stopped in.  The bottom line is: they have some seriously good dogs, made the right way, and pretty decent fries to accompany them.

And, when you&#39;re in the mood for an authentic Chicago-style hot dog, that&#39;s really all that matters isn&#39;t it?",21/11/14,58,4,1,1,3,0.4240999999999999,0.306,0.29300000000000004,5.401,No,504

I&#39;m in the mood for a chicken breast on a pita.  I am getting a little nervous as I hit the Cary border and I haven&#39;t noticed a likely fit for my culinary craving.  I should have opened my Yelp app, but I had resigned myself to eating later if something didn&#39;t jump out at me on my immediate route.  Before you knew it, there was Kojaks.

We pulled in the parking lot and I couldn&#39;t tell from looking at the building if they were open.  But there were cars in the lot, so we walked in.  Everyone working there was very nice.  The gal who took our order even made suggestions when we asked her opinion.  We went with chicken on a pita and gyros.  Both came with a side of fries and a medium drink.  We also added on the kickin&#39; chicken soup since the picture looked so good once I started to breeze through the Yelp photos.

There was a fair amount of seating, so we had our choice of spots to dine-in.  The food didn&#39;t take very long and everything was served piping hot just the way I like it.  Especially the soup!  

The pita bread was really fresh!  The chicken was chopped into small pieces and it was cooked nicely, but it had absolutely no seasoning.  I tried the gyros and they were very good.  The strips of meat were nicely cut and not hacked up.  Consistent seems to be an appropriate word to describe the piece of meat.  The tzatziki sauce was one of my favorites ever!  I had one bite of it and it was really, really good.  This was seasoned and had some garlic notes.  It was a great sauce!  The soup...I love soup.  This soup had highs and lows.  Highs were the giant - I mean seriously too big for the spoon - pieces of chicken breast.  There was more than one chicken chunk like this and I was pleased.  The noodles were not overcooked, so that also ranked high.  But, there were large red bell pepper chunks that were unexpected and not appealing to me as well as the use of red pepper flakes to add a sense of heat to the broth.  It took away from what I thought could be a very tasty soup.

A friend was working nearby and he wanted hot dogs, so we grabbed the two dog deal which came with fries and a medium drink.  The total was $7.48 for the hot dog special.  This does not seem reasonably priced for what it was.  The fries here are nothing special.  Frozen, not fresh cut.  The hot dogs and buns were average.  

Overall, it was fine, but I can&#39;t say that I would seek them out again.",10/10/14,275,3,2,4,22,3.8790000000000004,4.742,2.594,30.664000000000005,No,2515

I usually get the Gyro but I have tried pretty much everything the menu has to offer. The staff is super friendly and always makes you feel welcome. The food quality and speed is amazing! I would always recommend this place. Got a lot of different items on the menu. My favorites are Gyro, Chicken Gyro, Italian Sausage, and Dollar Dog Mondays! I, however, am not a fan of their Italian Beef, I do not recommend it. It doesn&#39;t have enough flavor. (Go to Portillo&#39;s in Crystal Lake for a good beef).

There may be better hot dogs, beefs or gyros out there at different establishments, but collectively Kojak&#39;s is hard to beat. Great for the mom or dad whose family likes different things for dinner - you can get them all here and leave knowing that you&#39;ll enjoy a good meal. There&#39;s only one other place like this in the area (Mr Beefy&#39;s) and it doesn&#39;t compare.

Now, ordinarily I wouldn&#39;t give a hot dog stand five stars - realistically hot dogs ARE hot dogs and there&#39;s not that much difference between them. However, where Kojak&#39;s earns its fifth star is their support of the community. They sponsor high school groups and youth teams. And they were very supportive of an event supporting area non-profits that I was involved with, so I&#39;ve seen their graciousness first-hand.

The hostess greeted us and took us to our table, and on the approach a very rude server runs up and yells at the host &#34;You&#39;re not putting them there! Put them somewhere else!&#34; And the poor stunned hostess didn&#39;t know what to do. She asked the server &#34;Well where should I put them?&#34; To which the unpleasant server replied &#34;I don&#39;t care but not here&#34;

So I get it. There&#39;s an eleven top waiting for space, but don&#39;t scream at the hostess in front of the guest. Later when that eleven top got sat they didn&#39;t even end up at that table. So clearly the hostess had things in hand. The server was more concerned with getting the eleven top. 

So we get sat outside. Not my preference, but the flustered host was trying to recover. 

Then we sit. And sit. And sit some more. Finally the server comes over. Asks if this is our first time at FIU. WE SAY NO. He proceeds to explain the concept. Okay. Whatever. 

Next he asks if we want to put in a drink order. I ask what beers are on tap. He says to me &#34;We only have local beers and you probably don&#39;t know what they are...&#34;

Excuse me? I can tell you all the local brewers, their regular beers and seasonal beers. Now the server doesn&#39;t know this, but I&#39;m pissed. 

So I ask well what do you have. He begins rattling off styles of beer &#34;I&#39;ve got two IPAs, a double bock, an American IPA, and a Farmhouse Pale Ale&#34;

Well first off it&#39;s a doppelbock. And not all IPAs are the same. So I ask what breweries, and his response ... &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;

So you believe I&#39;m too stupid to know the local beers, and then can&#39;t be bothered to tell me the breweries? Fine. I&#39;ll have the Farmhouse because right now Solemn Oath has Hexafoos, and my guess is that&#39;s what you meant when you said Farmhouse Pale Ale. I hope I&#39;m not too stupid to figure that out. 

Food comes and it tastes bland. Like I said I&#39;m used to Aurora. I know what the food tastes like. This isn&#39;t it. 

We eat, and wait forever for the server to come back to get the check. The check shows an IPA. 

Okay. I give up. I&#39;m too stupid to know the local beers, but you&#39;re too stupid to enter the right beer? Without a doubt I had a Hexafoos.

I won&#39;t be going back because of the insulting, arrogant, incompetent staff and the underwhelming food. 

I also will not be going to Naperville anymore. See my other review as to why I won&#39;t be going there. This place should change their name to FuckItUp Tacos. They had a good thing going, but now it&#39;s apparently time to watch success burn for the sheer fun of it.

I mentioned this to the dude (one of the cooks, I think?) who brought us our tacos and he was in complete agreement and said he needed to give that a try. I hope that someday that makes it onto the menu because DAMN that would be good. Those are totally my two favorite tacos here and you know what they say about two great tastes that taste great together...no, wait, that was peanut butter and chocolate or something muddled in my 80s-brain. 

Here&#39;s what&#39;s great about the new Wheaton Fire It Up location. I mean, in addition to the already awesome food. There&#39;s more space than the Naperville location so you don&#39;t have as long of a wait. 

Last night, my wife and I stopped by for some pre-Thanksgiving Taco Tuesday grubbin&#39; and left full and happy after indulging in a couple of cocktails, the parmesan chips and guac, and a round of tacos. 

Our waiter was super friendly, and tho I don&#39;t often use the phrase &#34;chill&#34; he was super chill. We had a slight speed bump in the fact that our chips were stale when they arrived. We were so hungry that we ate almost all of them anyway before I had a chance to mention they were stale, but when I did he brought us an entire fresh order complete with more guac. After that, you know we were feelin&#39; guacy. (I need you guys to embrace that as a phrase. K thnx). 

The tacos were just as awesome as Naperthrill, and we stuffed ourselves on shrimp, pork, cheeseburger and gringo. All delicious. All prepared fresh and done extremely well. 

I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll return to this location based on distance from our house, but the size of the place definitely has something going for it and it&#39;s absolutely just as great as their other location. I hope FIU continues expanding and perhaps will open a location in my backyard someday.

No wait...that might be bad.",25/11/15,211,5,2,5,49,7.663100000000001,4.309,1.0270000000000001,15.664999999999997,No,1957
fire-it-up-wheaton,Julie V.,9YyeoqIBSEL_uikPBTZZUQ,f2poGJal_Z1U2tJuSPGQ5w,"Disappointing. I don&#39;t even know where to begin. 

When I first saw the menu, I was excited about having pablano  gauc -I&#39;m a vegetarian, so avocados and pablanos are two of my absolutely favorite things. I then read some reviews, and I saw a few people say how the menu was too simple, or rather, every taco tasted the same, with a big dependency on the alioi. I&#39;ve make alioi myself and have always enjoyed it, so I thought it might be a fun adventure. I also read about the Parmesan chips, and how they tasted stale. Again, I was up for trying something new.

When we arrived, at 5:30 on a Friday, the place was filled. The host was very nice and asked if we wanted to wait for a table or eat at the bar. We said we&#39;d wait at the bar for a table. The place had a nice vibe, the  bartender was very friendly. In all, it seemed nice.

We were told we&#39;d have to wait 45 minutes, and we only  had to wait 10. Again, nice.

Then we got our gauc and chips. I make guac at least once a week. Fresh gauc isn&#39;t watery, it has chunks in it. It isn&#39;t  a paste. This was...like store bought gauc. Making matters worse, it had a level of spice and heat to it, but it didn&#39;t taste anything like a pablano.  Hubby immediately said, your guac is a million times better. It needed pablano flavor and salt..and actual avocado.  The chips?  What are they thinking. They are soggy and stale tasting. Seriously. Not our thing at all.

We then got our tacos. They looked good. I had a pablano and a veggie. Hubby had a poor boy and a gringo. We also split a beans and rice. The beans and rice were the only truly interesting part of dinner and they were oily. It was basmati rice with a lot of cumin and beans. It  reminded hubby of a curry of sorts.  The tacos? Both of mine tasted the same. They were the same, save for the one having cabbage and the other having mushrooms.  Hubby kind of enjoyed his gringo, but he couldn&#39;t eat his poor boy.  he said we make better tacos at home (lamb carnitas  being a favorite of his).

We finally decided that it was nice to try something new, but we wished we went to  Bien Truche or its sister restaurant.  Way better, and way more innovative and delicious. 

We will not be going back. When we want to just pick up tacos, we will go to Los Burritos.

This place might be a good taco truck, but a restaurant charging a reasonable amount of money? Skip it and head to Geneva or Glen Ellyn.",28/10/16,293,2,2,5,30,7.0257000000000005,4.978,2.6,37.422,No,2448

Had a seat at the bar and the server was great. I couldn&#39;t decide on what to order so I went with my servers suggestion and enjoyed my order.  

The Chophouse taco (steak, Portobello, onion, cabbage and the house spicy sauce) and the Shrimp taco (shrimp, cabbage, lemon aioli).  Both were very flavorful, using fresh ingredients and cooked well.  I loved the bit of spice in the Chophouse and added a bit more with the sauces provided.

The margaritas were very good and fresh. The chips and guacamole were delicious as well. The guacamole was extremely fresh. 

We ordered the Rail, it comes with 4 different types of tacos with three of each. We ordered the chophouse, shrimp, bbq pork, and the steak. Each taco was served on a flour tortilla and came with coleslaw on it. 

The chophouse was actually our least favorite. It had a spicy sauce on it and mushrooms. But compared to the others it was just not as good. 

The shrimp was our favorite. The shrimp were extremely fresh and had a great flavor.

The bbq pork was also amazing. The pork was juicy and full of flavor and the combination with the coleslaw and flour tortilla worked well.

The steak taco was good as well. More along the lines of a classic steak taco. Good flavor and the steak was juicy.

One of the partners waited on his and he was so enthusiastic to tell us about how the place came to be.  

They have a lunch special of two tacos and one side for $8 which is a screaming deal for organic, local, fresh and clean food.  They don&#39;t have a soda fountain.  They make their own lemonade, iced tea and their margarita mix is made by hand.  Can&#39;t wait to bring my husband here for their huge selection of beers.  Remember they started out as a food truck outside a brewery.

Food is delicious!  Start with the parm chips and guac.  You can&#39;t go wrong with any of the tacos.  Shrimp poorboy and BBQ pork were delicious!

The Naperville location is 5-star amazing and I was pumped to find a location closer to home. I ordered my usual order from the Naperville location: chips and guac, a gringo taco, a cheeseburger taco, and a BLT taco. The chips, the amazing incredible delicious Parmesan dusted chips I am OBSESSED with at the Naperville location, were... Off. They were so greasy that they weren&#39;t crunchy, but almost chewy. They were bendable. They were still parm dusted, but there was a ton of parm at the bottom of the dish, too. The guac was brownish at the edges of the container. The gringo taco was just so greasy it was almost inedible. Even the BLT taco was greasy from the single strip of bacon on it. 

Typically I would say this is my own fault for getting takeout, but I get takeout at the other location, further from my house, and it arrives perfect, consistently.

The space itself has an industrial yet casual vibe, and the staff is great. The gal who typically is at the hostess podium is so nice and looks like Arya Stark from Game of Thrones. We&#39;ve also had the pleasure of having Bill (probably the most personable waiter we&#39;ve ever had) and Grace as our waiters like 95% of the time, and they&#39;re awesome.

Now for the food, it&#39;s our go-to taco spot. We really like the guac and chips, appreciate the local beer selection and use of organic ingredients, and LOVE the tacos (get them with corn tortillas). My personal favorite is the Cheeseburger Taco. Sweet jeebus, it tastes so crisp and the mayo compliments the meat and cheese so well! Also, their special salsa will always be part of my meal as I cant help but squeeze that ish&#39; all over my tacos and chips. It has this sweet start and the finish has an even-handed heat to it that I cant get enough of.

fire-it-up-wheaton,Christiana S.,OEIIgrgvjaXN9ov08kHeUA,XFGSJP1MbQKzkTZfg8Llug,"I want to really love this place, but:

The tacos are WAY overdressed with with greens.  There is literally a mini-salad on each one.  This isn&#39;t necessarily a terrible thing, and I get it - it&#39;s a cheap and healthy way to add bulk and make it look like you&#39;re getting a lot of bang for your buck.  But there&#39;s really no variation from taco to taco.  The same mixed greens - everywhere, in abundant qualities.  This makes it difficult to savor the really high quality, locally sourced meats that they&#39;re using.  The steak they used was tender and well-seasoned, but it was hard to realize that with a mouth full of lettuce.

We tried six different tacos, and overall they were pretty decent.  The least successful were the shrimp (overcooked and rubbery), the veggie (mostly just rice with a hearty helping of the aforementioned greens; not very exciting) and the BBQ pork (sauce was a little too sweet and there was a little too much of it).  The steak was great, though - and the sauce on the southwest chicken was amazing.  

Chips were good, salsa was good.... sangria was delicious and the margaritas are strong.

As far as service goes - our waitress was attentive but not obnoxiously so.  The stool seating is not very comfortable, but since this isn&#39;t really a place that you&#39;re going to linger for a long time, I guess that&#39;s okay.  It would be nice if there were hooks for coats or purses, though.

Patio looks fun, so I&#39;ll probably be back when it warms up!",05/04/16,167,4,2,5,29,4.378599999999999,2.55,0.6499999999999998,11.799000000000001,No,1504

I&#39;m a regular of their Naperville location and I&#39;ve never been disappointed, I was in the area and thought I&#39;d stop in this one to see what it was like. It&#39;s obviously bigger than the Naperville location, but not overwhelming. With ample outdoor seating which will be nice when that season comes! I ordered the gringo, cheeseburger and BLT tacos the gringo and cheeseburger I get every time because they are amazing but my third I like to switch up. Everything tasted freaking great! My boyfriend always gets the truck with the hot sauce and just raves about that too. My one and only complaint here is they make super weak margaritas and taste like I&#39;m just drinking the syrup. Not good, and at 8 bucks a pop I expect more, think about it, if you make them decent, meaning I can actually taste the tequila then I will most definitely order another one. But I left drink only about half. Don&#39;t come here for those unless they decided to be better at it.

fire-it-up-wheaton,Becky J.,MXEhEm_zE0lyv3d40fd-Cg,zYtLFyZVWLyAxpgZXkmiMw,"I do not get all these 5-star reviews AT ALL. I would have rated this place 1-star if it weren&#39;t for the waitress who seemed flustered but very sweet. 
I came here last week with a few people &amp; we were very, very disappointed in this place.
I live nearby so I&#39;ve been wanting to check it out for awhile. We came around 7pm on a Wednesday &amp; weren&#39;t greeted promptly. When we were greeted, about 5 minutes later..we were told it would be a half hour wait even though there were open tables &amp; no one else waiting. After about 15 minutes I asked if we could at least sit down &amp; order drinks. The hostess then informs us the reason she didn&#39;t seat us is because &#34;the kitchen is backed up&#34;. OK...but can we sit down?! (we won&#39;t order food for awhile if the chefs need a little more time)...... She then seats us.

We order a few drinks, some sangria &amp; a couple on-tap beers. (nothing wrong here, the drinks were good).
Then, about 15 mins later we each order about 3 tacos each. Which, as I&#39;d like to mention..none of them really appealed to us. It seems all of the tacos on the menu have mayo..or aioli or some other sauce they are drenched in. I understand this is a &#39;fusion&#39; restaurant but the menu lacks restraint. That&#39;s already a red flag.

Fast forward 50 minutes...YES 50... We finally get our tacos.

I can handle a long wait on food if it&#39;s worth it but these tacos...were AWFUL. The flour tortilla&#39;s they serve are not homemade &amp; pretty bad quality to start. They really skimp on the actual meats- and add a lot of fillers like lettuce &amp; sauces. I could make better tacos at home. 

If you go to this place...walk right back out and head down the street to &#39;a toda madre&#39; where your money will be well spent.  Won&#39;t be returning here unless it&#39;s solely for drinks.",23/02/16,208,2,1,1,-35,0.2977,1.38,1.2710000000000001,21.348,No,1865
fire-it-up-wheaton,M J.,EKdbFRMuVlAH0P06ijFlYg,IYosCJfNDyLOTgxPKfgGzA,"Possibly the worst chips and guac I&#39;ve ever had. I have a hard time figuring out if the chips were stale or if the oil wasn&#39;t hot enough and made the chips an oily, soft mess. You shouldn&#39;t be able to bend chips without breaking them. Thank goodness I had a margarita to wash the taste away. Wait a second......where&#39;s the salt on my glass? There it is! It&#39;s on a slice of lime floating in the glass. How unusual! How unique! How dumb! There&#39;s a reason why restaurants don&#39;t put the salt on a lime floating in the glass. It&#39;s because the salt is meant to be tasted with each sip without having to shove your fingers into the glass to pick up the lime and lick it.  

The tacos are actually decent, but not outstanding. The Cheeseburger taco is an actual cheeseburger in a flour tortilla. The Gringo has a (very) deep fried flour tortilla and it&#39;s pretty good. 

Summary: If you&#39;re a foodie expecting something like Big Star, stay away. If you&#39;re a person with more simple tastes, give it a try. If the chips weren&#39;t so awful I&#39;d rate this place a 3.5.",10/03/16,122,2,1,0,-11,-0.03460000000000013,1.257,1.6480000000000001,15.095000000000002,No,1103

This is a quaint little place that locally sources, including their beer. I ordered the following:

Half Acre Pony Pilsner - this was a nice local beer, lighter, yummy.

Chips and Guac - the Guac was fresh and tasty. The chips were Parmesan dusted. They were ok, kind of bland. 

2 tacos- Taco Tuesday! I order one with Bbq pork. Good flavor, sweet &amp; crispy from the cabbage. The second, steak &amp; mushroom with a little bite. Both had a nice mix of taste and texture, filling.

fire-it-up-wheaton,Mark D.,ymfU0YKivrd-wsN1uvyfIw,vf6poN6eO64bEmx4FrGw2Q,"Even though I am only giving 3 stars I can see why this restaurant gets many 4-5 stars. The ambiance is wonderful, especially the surprising outdoor seating area which is not expected when viewd from the entrance; in fact the venue appeared &#39;closed&#39; when our family pulled up. 
It was a warm late August Saturday evening and we had our choice of &#39;in or out&#39;. The inside appears clean and inviting and with a nice atmosphere but we chose &#39;out&#39; and it reminded us of some of our old Lincoln Park haunts; A very inviting patio. The kids liked it too. (Be warned to bring mosquito spray though). 
The service was prompt and friendly, they explained the &#39;origin story&#39; and their food quality. Waitperson recommended items and alerted us to the portion size.
We did the chips and guacamole; I also asked for salsa as well. The chips were OK...1/2 were crispy and  1/2 were chewy...not sure which it was supposed to be! I like em crispy. 
The guac was great.
The salsa was so so though my wife liked it. To me it tasted sort of relishy and was a paste like consistency.
My son got the pulled pork taco and enjoyed it. My wife got the steak and Portobello mushroom tacos and like them. I ordered &#39;The Truck&#39;; their burrito w/ steak, chicken and shrimp. The waitperson recommended I get the shrimp on the side after I mentioned that did not sound like a good combo.
I did. The burrito was a solid &#39;good&#39;.  My wife had the lemonade (really good) and I had the margarita...so so again because the taste was a little sweet and the salt was &#39;on the lime&#39;. I had not realized what &#39;salt on the lime&#39; meant, it meant they placed the salt on the lime in your drink...duh)
It may be picky but I think salt &#39;on the rim&#39; is a standard that makes it easier for those of us who like salt margaritas to actually make it easier to taste a little salt w/ each sip instead of pulling out a lime to lick it!  At $8 it as just OK. 
All in all it was a pleasant experience but it lacked something important: It did not seem to me to taste like the expected Mexican fair; more new age Wheaton Mexican. I appreciate organic/locally sourced/etc. but want some Mexican tastiness too.
Another gripe: Paying 5-7 bucks for chips and salsa/guac is a deal breaker for me. 99.999% of Mexican restaurants provide immediate gratis chips and salsa to their customers. A table of 4 goes through them like crazy and at that price there should have at least been a refill or two of the chips to make it worthwhile.
Sooo; while I can see that they run a good establishment I would not return due to my reservations stated above though I encourage anyone to give it a try...my wife and kids like their fair...I thought it was OK.

I had been looking for a decent place in the suburbs to make out of this world tacos, like the ones I can get from the trucks downtown. Fire it up is that place!!! The menu is amazing, very diverse, and I love that they source most all of their ingredients, drinks, beers, and spirits from local companies! The root beer, soda, and lemonade are all locally made! Sweet! The tacos are ordered individually, so you can get a nice array of whatever your heart desires. I love getting the portabella and the veggie tacos. The veggie ones have a little kick to them, and both are super flavorful. The chips and salsa is also really amazing, the Parmesan chips are handmade, and are out of this world with their homemade salsa. My kids like he BLT and chicken tacos, my teenager even had a steak tack from last night that he couldn&#39;t finish for lunch today and said it was still amazing as a leftover! Score!

I&#39;m not used to not getting complimentary chips and salsa in a Mexican restaurant, but that was okay. The chips and guac we ordered were interesting. The tacos were tasty and the waiter was very nice. The biggest problem, it is hard to enjoy a dinner when you are freezing!

We moved to another table further away from the music. When our waiter, William, came with our drinks, he mentioned that we had moved so we told him why. He replied &#34; We&#39;re a rockin place. My mother likes it.&#34; He then walks away without taking our orders. Two noisy freight trains had passed (the restaurant backs up to the train station) before he ambled over to take our order. The food was just ok. My husband had asked for corn tortillas but got flour. I wanted to ask for lemons for my fresh lemonade because it had little flavor, but William was nowhere in sight. When we were finished and ready to leave he came and offered more lemonade and we asked for the check instead. When we had the check and looked at the total we handed him our charge card. He went off printed customer and restaurant tabs, gave them to us and left. My daughter noticed that the top receipt didn&#39;t match the total on the other receipts. William didn&#39;t appear again (there were only 3 tables outside and 1 inside that were occupied). We went in to the bar and asked who was in charge and the gentleman there said that he was. He assured us that it wasn&#39;t a scam and recharged us the correct amount for our meal, while supposedly deleting the incorrect charge. 3 days later I have been charged the correct bill total but still have the incorrect charge as a hold on my credit card. I told the friend who had recommended Fire it Up to us and was told that a very similar problem had occurred there with his son and date.

I&#39;m boring myself while writing this so I&#39;ll get straight to the point. This place  is awkward. The reviews of this place are fairly accurate. The bread that comes out before your meal should be warm and fresh. It wasn&#39;t either. The salad is mediocre with 1 cherry tomato and a dab of dressing.

It is as square as a Republican Bachelor Party. From the look of most of the clientele you would swear you were either at a Republican Bachelor Party where the Men brought their wives along for good measure, or a seminar for Post-retirement planning. (No disrespect intended).
The Menu is free of hyperbole, and cleverness. It&#39;s straight and narrow. 
It is one of the single greatest restaurants in Northern Illinois, and maybe the Country.
This is what high-class &#34;going out&#34; was back in the day. If you catch the rhythm, you&#39;ll see that this is still a high-class joint.
And the food--meaning Steak and Prime Rib--is divine.
Order an Old-fashioned, or a Martooni, or a Manhattan. It will be made perfectly.
You get a relish tray, just like in the day-radishes, celery, etc.  A perfect light appetizer.
Maybe a salad or a soup (The baked French Onion is a work of Art)-all perfect.
All of this in anticipation of the main event-a hunk of bloody-rare Prime Rib the size and shape of a Birthday Cake. Perfectly seasoned. Perfect in every way. (yes, of course you can get it cooked to the temperature you like--it&#39;s my review, though)
Or a Steak like a Clincher Softball. Yep-perfect!
It ain&#39;t cheap-cheap, but at the same time, it won&#39;t disturb the molecular structure of your Credit Card. WORTH every penny!!

The service was great, however, the food and especially the presentation were lacking. The first thing delivered was a basket of crackers and a half loaf of pre sliced bread...not even warm bread! There was also a platter of various veggies. Next came the soup. I ordered the minestrone soup...flavorful but lukewarm. Next came the salad...if you can call it that. It was a bowl of lettuce, and not the nice green kind either...more of the white, hard lettuce you find near the middle. It came with, I kid you not, one cherry tomato, one cucumber slice, and a small dab of salad dressing...needless to say, I did not finish this! The main course came and I had ordered the garlic mashed potatoes as a side dish. They were on the heavy side and were served on a side plate, even though there was more than enough room on the main plate. The sea bass did not have much flavor, and on the plate were two small carrots and a broccoli stem.

While my wife does not like the decor, I find it very appealing. Like going to your grandparents house in Wisconsin. In fact, it has a Wisconsin supper club feel.

The Prime Rib is second to none and very inexpensive, with the larger cut going for around 22 bucks. Side choices are plentiful and the staff very friendly. This is easy to show up here casual or dressed to the nines and still feel &#34;in place&#34;.

They bring out a cheese dip and veggie tray with bread when you sit down. TVs are only in bar and I do not think they have wifi, both are pluses for us. Kids will most likely feel at home here as well.

Chicken ribs, steaks, fish are all on the menu. We have tried much of it and never been disappointed. Even when the lot looks full, we have never waited for a seat. This is probably due to the fact that it is almost TARDIS like being bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside.

A definite supper club feel, this place is a great venue for a meal with the baby boomers. We took mom here for Mother&#39;s Day, and it is great for a late lunch or early dinner on a Sunday. 

The filets were good, cooked perfectly. My dad said the lamb was a bit overlooked. They serve fish too, but none of us tried it. Try the baked French onion soup for a heartier appetizer to your meal, because the salad is lackluster. For dessert we tried the carrot cake and chocolate cake. Save your appetite, fill yourself up with the steak or go somewhere else for dessert because the cakes were dry and bland. 

Service was fine, but a bit slow on the drink refills and clearing away plates. Prices are reasonable for the cut of meat and all that is included with dinner.

I&#39;m not hating this place; it has a few things that are really good, and others that could use improvement. But I&#39;m sure I will be back with my parents in the future - and I&#39;ll focus on the simple filet and skip (or forgive) the rest.

From Anita at the front door to every server I have had there, they are attentive and treat you like they&#39;ve known you forever. Their drinks are good and stiff, I&#39;m a whiskey sour drinker so I would know. They also have reasonably priced wines and some decent beer choices. I like that they bring you a relish tray, crackers, bread and this interesting cheddar spread to start (very &#39;Wisconsinish&#39;). You get soup AND salad with your meal. Prime rib can&#39;t be beat. Go on Wednesday for a good deal. Ribs and steaks are excellent too. Broiled haddock is good too. It&#39;s a huge, meaty piece with just the right amount of butter and seasoning. LOVE their au gratin potato side dish. They do a Friday night fish fry which is good, but it&#39;s not beer battered so don&#39;t go expecting it to be as you will be disappointed. The ambiance is out of date, but for some reason it adds to the feel of the place so I don&#39;t consider it to be a bad thing. Save room for a brandy ice for dessert. Yummy :) I would give this place five stars, but I have never been impressed with their Italian dishes. Admittedly, being an Italian I am pickier about that than most, but the fact of the matter is that the owners are Italian and in my opinion they could make things like the tortellini or the eggplant parm better if they really wanted to.

First off, I was given a beautiful and tasty slab of prime rib, and the mashed potatoes were excellent.  But, although my prime rib and mashed potatoes were great, both were barely warm when served.  My friend said that the strip steak she ordered was cooked to medium rare, but she really had a hard time cutting it, and her mashed potatoes were barely warm, as well. The onion soup, (plain, not French onion) was like lukewarm, greasy dishwater with a few onion strings in it.  Thank goodness the salads were fresh, with decent dressings, although they were average iceberg with a few baby lettuce leaves thrown in as an accent.  We really enjoyed the relish tray, mostly because it isn&#39;t something you find at restaurants much anymore, and it provided a nice break from the same old, same old salads.  
No, we didn&#39;t send back our soup, or our meals to be (re?)heated, because we&#39;ve both had bad experiences in other restaurants sending things back to the kitchen.
After a long discussion, we&#39;ve decided we probably will try Sorrento&#39;s again, but next time we will be much more aware of what not to order, and will be keeping on top of the food temp.  We have to wonder whether coming in early to eat was a good idea, and if that was the reason that nothing was at serving temp except the salad and the relish tray!

Love Mr. and Mrs. Chang (the owners) ! So heartwarming on a cold day :)  Mr.  Chang is always smiling and showing that Korean hospitality. 

Galbi is still great quality,  but back in the day,  the galbi use to be the best where I could see the marbling so beautifully.  Don&#39;t know if they changed their meat source,  but with rise in prices,  I would have expected similar quality.  There&#39;s definitely competition brewing for who actually has the best &#34;prime&#34; galbi in town now.

The soup that comes with the kbbq order is the best out of all the Illinois kbbq places.  Nicely seasoned,  not your typical bland watery soup.  

Other soups on the menu are also very good.  Nice clean place.  And they also remodeled/remodeling so it will be one of the better looking places.  

Bottom line: Hit this place up! You won&#39;t regret it!",03/11/16,155,4,2,5,46,7.3109,4.096,0.068,10.835999999999999,No,1236

The outside of this restaurant doesn&#39;t do justice to the inside and the food it serves. I confess I have been by the restaurant twice before I finally went in.  And so glad was I to do that. The food was amazing. We went in for lunch and the service was a little slow therefore 4 star. Food was totally a 5 star. We had the combination BBQ platter. The waiter said it&#39;s for 2 people sharing... no it&#39;s totally for 4. There was so much food left for us. We were 4 of us. Ordered bibimbap, tofu soup in addition to the BBQ. We had more food then we could eat. But we were very happy with all of them. Will sure visit again whenever we go pass Chicago. A must visit for Korean food lovers.",22/10/16,79,4,1,2,1,1.9847,1.9480000000000002,0.26,12.791999999999998,No,733
koreana-schaumburg,Kate L.,as_D75LlyJj-RvE_zsYjAQ,XX-5eYvPW4bsvLC8dH_m1Q,"Really disappointed--food was bland, BBQ portion sizes are too small (see photo), and service was bad.

I like Korean food, and cook it at home often. I have worked at a Korean restaurant and Korean grocery store. I even married into a Korean family recently ^^  My husband and I are on a mission to dine at as many Korean restaurants in Chicagoland as possible... but Koreana is not one that we will return to. I would say Koreana is ok -if- you live nearby, but it definitely wasn&#39;t worth the 45-minute drive from our home.

Food was bland... The banchan and kalbi were bland and unimpressive. My own Korean homecooking has much more flavor. Of all the Korean restaurants that I have reviewed on Yelp, I would say Koreana&#39;s banchan rank at the bottom. Koreana served: kimchi, kkakdugi (radish kimchi), eomuk (stir-fried fish cake), bean sprouts, broccoli with cho-jang, and something that resembled a cold jeon of some sorts.

BBQ portion sizes are too small... I realize that Korean BBQ is expensive, but as you can see from the photo, one portion of thick samgyeopsal (pork belly) only has 4 pieces of meat for $20.99. The kalbi (marianted beef), which also seemed a bit skimpy, was $29.99. That&#39;s quite pricey considering many Korean BBQs charge $25 or $30 per person for All-You-Can-Eat. 

Service was bad... The staff is friendly. We were seated quickly. We were served tea and banchan quickly. But... the server started our BBQ at such an extremely low temperature, that after 20 minutes of our meat NOT cooking on the grill, we had to ask her to &#34;please, turn up the heat!&#34; All the banchan were gone before the meat was even cooked. And we were super disappointed that they didn&#39;t serve rice or doenjang (bean paste) soup with our meal. Every Korean restaurant we have dined at serves complimentary rice and soup. 

Oh, but then, as our meal neared the end, and the server turned off the BBQ grill because we were done grilling, only then did they serve the rice and soup. What&#39;s up with that Koreana?!?! Geez, would have been nice to have soup at the beginning of our meal, you know during that awkward time when our meat WASN&#39;T cooking and we were just starring off into space!!",18/03/16,273,2,1,2,-31,1.0616,1.265,0.7190000000000001,20.018,No,2221
koreana-schaumburg,Jonna N.,j3jaM4FyZPlDZy0m17stlw,YFTuBoP1YJGIU5upfUr-Nw,"They give you a good serving of the food you order. They are nice and if you don&#39;t have a table with the grill to cook the food, then the kitchen will cook your food. I like when the kitchen does it because they put in spices and onions that you don&#39;t get yourself to cook your own meat.

I tried rice tea for the first time. When I took my first sip, I thought it tasted weird. Then I kept drinking it and liked it. It reminded me of the rice at the bottom of a rice cooker that burnt a little. I know I know this sounds weird, but growing up my favorite part of rice was burnt part on the bottom because kids like crunchy things. Weird but it&#39;s different than the usual soft rice on the top.

The Hamul Pajun (seafood pancake) is BIG. They cut it up for you which is nice so you can grab pieces. They have a lot of octopus and squid and scallions.

Chicken bulgolgi is very spicy, but tasty. Just be prepared for a kick. Good thing they give you rice.

The beef bulgolgi is good too. They cut the pieces small so it seemed like little it was an endless plate of beef.

They gave us this puffed rice dessert. It was sweetened and crunchy. very tasty. I kept going back for more.",02/03/16,136,4,1,4,-5,3.9731,2.6029999999999998,0.5489999999999999,17.848,No,1191

Korean restaurants aren&#39;t really known for good service, but I would say Koreana does a decent job. They are much more attentive than most Korean restaurants I&#39;ve been to. They take reservations, and call ahead if you have a big party. They will accommodate you. 

Their galbi tang is delicious. It&#39;s beef soup with 3-4 thick chunks of beef short rib with Korean vermicelli, dates, radish, etc. It&#39;s savory soup with lots of garlic and tender short ribs that you barely even need to chew. My go to dish here.

If people ask me recommendations for Korean BBQ, I tell them to come here. The meat is good quality and decently priced. You get what you pay for here. I usually get chadol (thin slices of beef) and samgyupssal (thick slices of pork belly). If you want the full experience, get some alcohol like a true Korean would. soju or makoli (Korean rice wine).

That said, we walked in and found tons of Korean&#39;s and a bus was pulling up to drop off tourists from Korea!  The table behind us was serving each other a lot of soju and doing some weird bending of the arm into their neighbors arm like at a wedding to drink!  That said, they were having a good time and it was probably for thee best that they were not driving.   Who knew that Korean&#39;s visiting the US would come to Schaumburg for Korean BBQ!  Ok, enough of that stuff.. 

So we ordered the combo sampler as well as some lovely marinated short ribs.. I couldn&#39;t pronounce the name there so I won&#39;t even try to spell it on here.  As usual, we loved all of the little tasty sides (the kimchi isn&#39;t as spicy or fermented as I like and there is always a weird mayonnaise type dish but all in all super good!) and could care less about the lettuce or salad.  It was all about the portions of grilled meat, tiny glasses for beer and a couple of three bottles of soju between the 3 of us.  Honestly, I haven&#39;t had a bad meal here and I spend a lot of time eating Asian food with Asian people.  

Not sure how anyone has bad service there unless they are slammed as the owner was constantly coming over to our table and helping us to cook our meat or serve it up.",01/04/16,144,4,2,4,23,3.6513,1.668,0.34199999999999997,8.992,No,1371
koreana-schaumburg,Khris L.,gU5CPdNIyHiYxKEOnqB1LA,nQyV3M0CADDgySUKadEb9A,"Finally, a Korean restaurant in the area that&#39;s worth going to!  I&#39;ve tried all the others in the area and was so disappointed that I almost didn&#39;t want to try this place, thinking that it would be the same.  Fortunately, I decided to try it out anyways and I&#39;m so glad I did!
I dropped by with my girl on a Friday evening and got seated immediately.  The first thing I noticed was the mouth watering aroma of Korean grilled meats that filled the place.  The next thing I noticed was that the place was packed with mostly Koreans.  That&#39;s usually a good sign that the food is authentic.
We ordered the kimchee stew, marinated galbi(short ribs) and a big bottle of Korean beer.  The service started out a tad bit slow, but it wasn&#39;t anything to complain about.  They brought out the banchan(side dishes) and the beer to start off with.  What was surprising was that one of the banchans was galbi jjim(braised short ribs).  This is usually a main dish, and quite an expensive one at that.  I was surprised that they offered it for free as a banchan.  After a few sips of beer, the main dishes came out.  The kimchee stew tasted a bit different(gingery?) from other ones I&#39;ve tried, but I got used to it quickly and really enjoyed it.  The marinated galbi was a tiny bit chewy, but still tasty.  We both really enjoyed the meal.
As noted, the service started out a tad bit slow, but once we were all settled in, the service was great.  Many different people walked by to make sure we were doing okay.  They had absolutely no problems with us asking for stuff and they did everything with a smile.  
All in all, I would say this is the best Korean restaurant in the area.  The food was great, the service was great, and it actually felt a bit like Korea in there.  I would definitely recommend this place to friends.  Try it out if you haven&#39;t!",19/11/15,215,5,1,5,-4,6.479,4.146999999999999,0.394,20.459000000000003,No,1872

First impression was that the layout was a little awkward Some of the tables were very close together while others were more spaced apart. You can easily bump into someone or something in certain parts of the restaurant. Also, the tables and chairs didn&#39;t all match, and by that, I mean some tables were a different material and appearance than others. If the food is great though, it doesn&#39;t matter if they have the ugliest furniture ever or the worst layout.

The banchans, or mini side dishes, were pretty good (we got seven for a party of two). I don&#39;t know too many Korean restaurants in the area that offer a beef banchan, so definitely a plus!

I ordered dolsot bibimbap (hot stone bowl of beef, rice, veggies), which was pretty good. I couldn&#39;t finish at least half of it because the banchans helped fill me up. My friend ordered the yukgaejang (beef soup). I tried some of her dish, which was pretty decent.

Overall, I recommend going to this restaurant.",30/05/14,145,4,1,5,-6,4.0292,2.6670000000000003,0.363,10.97,No,1235
koreana-schaumburg,Amanda M.,3xibmgNSEMMtiTP2PlevhQ,N3povv87w58HrGrXtNKqOg,"Made reservations for dinner for 2 earlier in the day. When we arrived, there was already a bunch of people in front of us. It was confusing because we waited awhile but no one came to us. I finally went to the front of the restaurant and told the lady about our reservations. She simply said okay. From that point on, I was expecting slow/poor service for the rest of the night, especially as we continued to wait without given a proper response. Also, we noticed a couple of empty tables, but no one was being seated. A bunch of other tables cleared out and the little old lady came to everyone and simply asked who was next. I reminded her about our reservations and she seated us, not because of our reservations, but simply because I spoke up next. All in all though, we waited about 10 minutes.

Everything changed the moment we were seated. Each table had a call button, so when pressed, someone comes immediately to assist you. That was amazing. Not only that, many people came by casually asking how we were doing and very genuinely doing so.

We had the seafood pancake to start and it was amazing. They jam-packed the pancake with seafood and scallions and was almost too much, relative to the batter. It was delicious, accompanied by perfectly grilled octopus and a sweet sesame soy sauce for dipping.

I had the spicy tofu soup with seafood. Their portions were a lot bigger than other places (92 Town &amp; Ttowa). I immediately tasted the broth and it was the perfect spicy seafood flavor. However, I did not find too many seafood pieces in my soup. Nonetheless, it was delicious. The egg was likely put in a little too early as it wasn&#39;t as runny as it should be, as it was already slightly cooked in the hot soup (92 Town&#39;s egg was perfect). Just as tasty if not more than 92 Town&#39;s but definitely larger portion. My boyfriend had the spicy beef soup, and it was a little too spicy for him, but he still enjoyed it. His portion was even bigger than mine, so much so, that we had leftovers (we never have leftovers).

All in all, a little pricy, but Korean food generally is, but huge portions and delicious authentic food and the best service I&#39;ve had in a long time, which means a lot, especially for an Asian restaurant.

2. At least a tinge of casual rudeness from the staff

Koreana delivered on both. 

I loved this place and personally my heart gives it a 5, but for the sake of full disclosure regarding it&#39;s quirky and imperfect (but still very much lovable) atmosphere, I&#39;m going with a 4.

-- We walked in around 6:30 on a Sunday evening to dining room about 2/3 full --
Hostess: You have reservation? 
Me: No, we...
Hostess: **Walks away hurriedly**
Me to my partner: She just walked away... Does that mean &#39;go home&#39;? What does that mean? I don&#39;t know what that means? 
Young Korean Family Who&#39;s Also Waiting To Be Sat: Yeah, they do that here. They&#39;ll seat you when they seat you and you won&#39;t get an estimated time.
Me: Good to know. 
-- About 15 minutes later the hostess woman comes over and tells us we&#39;ll sit &#34;there&#34; and points to a small table that&#39;s being cleaned in another dining room next to an oddly placed refrigerator in the middle of the dining area --
Me: Ok. 

They put menus on our table and walked away and it took us a few minutes to figure out that we needed to press the button on the table to call a server and order. We knew going in that there likely wouldn&#39;t be a ton of veggie options, so we usually end up with dolsat bibimbop, which is just fine by me. 

We also got their spicy tofu appetizer that wasn&#39;t spicy at all, but I&#39;m a person who likes stuff super spicy to the point where your nose is running into mouth and I pretty much always find myself feeling like Korean spice levels are ultra tame. 

We kind of only ordered the tofu appetizer because my partner was worried the bibimbop wouldn&#39;t be enough to split (even thought it always is) and this was one of like 3 veggie options on the menu. We weren&#39;t expecting much, but what we got was an absolutely huge portion of perfect tofu, scallions, and a light spicy sauce that we came very close to fighting over. I will get this dish every time I come back... in fact, we might have to get two of these dishes to avoid any kind of sharing debacles. 

Next came the banchan, which they&#39;re more than happy to refill endlessly, and miso soup that apparently comes with any order of bibimbop. The miso was the least salty I&#39;ve ever had and very good (even though I do crave the sodium). 

The bibimbop came as expected in a monstrous stone bowl with all the trimmings. They were diligent in ensuring that no meat made it&#39;s way into any of our dishes and we appreciated that as 80% of time that isn&#39;t the case. The egg wasn&#39;t as runny as we&#39;d hoped, but did let the bowl sit extra long to crisp the rice so that could be on us. 

The servers won&#39;t come by unless you buzz them, and I kind of like that. Highly efficient. The atmosphere isn&#39;t the greatest and it isn&#39;t a spotless place, but what can you expect at a place that lets customers cook their own food?

koreana-schaumburg,Jon A.,ndUrMkyRyULEnrFn4fmRyw,AmcdBDVICEYcOTlJYjdjyw,"Korean food. Who doesn&#39;t love Korean food?

I heard a lot of good things about this place - the food and the the ambiance.

Koreana is placed within a strip mall, therefore is a huge parking lot and entrance is clearly visible. On the night that I went, there were several smokers outside the entrance doing their thing. Personally, I don&#39;t mind the smokers, but parents with children who are going to eat there are going to be a little annoyed. 

My friends and I walked into the foyer and the smells were AWESOME. The place was packed we waited for 10 minutes to get a table.

As hostess walked us to our table, I looked around at the decor. The place is medium-sized with a party room to the right side of the main dining room. I noticed that there&#39;s a bar and TVs in the room. I was expecting to see Korean television, but it was an American baseball game ... :( ... the food portions on the the tables of patrons were huge!

We looked at the menu as a family. I didn&#39;t look at the menu beforehand. I was quite angry to find out that if you want Korean BBQ, that there&#39;s a 2 order minimum. That&#39;s sad. They don&#39;t even have a website ... /sadder

I was really hungry for dol sot bibimbap - which I got. My friend got the pork bulgogi. For an appetizer - we got the pajeon. 

Here&#39;s the dish-by-dish breakdown:

- The dol sot bibimbap - Bean Sprouts. Gosari. Cucumber. Pickled Vegetables. Spinach. Fried Egg. Seaweed Flakes. I asked for a raw egg, which I&#39;m used to eating vice a fried egg on top. The waitress and hostess didn&#39;t know what I was talking about ... /sad

- The pork belly bulgogi was a little underwhelming, however, IMHO, it was bo ssam served with lettuce leaves, white rice, typical sides of pickled vegetables, doenjang (fermented bean paste) ... honestly, my bo ssam/pork belly bulgogi is much better. 

- The pajeon - it was huge, and very filling. It was a little greasy and it needed more scallions. The dipping sauce needed a little work - it needed more acid (lemon juice).

Overall, it&#39;s a good experience. I will try the kalbi next time, but I personally can make better Korean food and I&#39;m FILIPINO!",07/08/14,268,4,1,3,-7,2.7975,2.754,1.661,28.584999999999997,No,2177

The restaurant was packed and a line developed later in the evening. I love that feeling when you&#39;re at an awesome place but didn&#39;t have to wait!

I got the yukgaejang which is a Korean beef soup. The ingredients tasted fresh and the soup was hearty and well seasoned. It&#39;s mildly spicy, but definitely nothing compared to other spicy Korean dishes. 

My friend ordered the dolsot (hot stone bowl) bibimbap. It looked fresh and yummy. 

The banchans (free side dishes) didn&#39;t disappoint, usually my favorite part of eating at a Korean restaurant. And as with other Korean restaurants, they&#39;ll keep the banchans coming to your heart&#39;s content.

If you want simple lung just order the Dumplings soup, which is healthy and good for lunch.
If you want to have a big meal, traditional Korean BBQ is so good for family gathering or friends parties. Beef tongue, Porkbelly, or just regular chicken, pork or beef bugulgi is wonderful enough to make your stomach satisfied.

koreana-schaumburg,Jon A.,ndUrMkyRyULEnrFn4fmRyw,AmcdBDVICEYcOTlJYjdjyw,"Korean food. Who doesn&#39;t love Korean food?

I heard a lot of good things about this place - the food and the the ambiance.

Koreana is placed within a strip mall, therefore is a huge parking lot and entrance is clearly visible. On the night that I went, there were several smokers outside the entrance doing their thing. Personally, I don&#39;t mind the smokers, but parents with children who are going to eat there are going to be a little annoyed. 

My friends and I walked into the foyer and the smells were AWESOME. The place was packed we waited for 10 minutes to get a table.

As hostess walked us to our table, I looked around at the decor. The place is medium-sized with a party room to the right side of the main dining room. I noticed that there&#39;s a bar and TVs in the room. I was expecting to see Korean television, but it was an American baseball game ... :( ... the food portions on the the tables of patrons were huge!

We looked at the menu as a family. I didn&#39;t look at the menu beforehand. I was quite angry to find out that if you want Korean BBQ, that there&#39;s a 2 order minimum. That&#39;s sad. They don&#39;t even have a website ... /sadder

I was really hungry for dol sot bibimbap - which I got. My friend got the pork bulgogi. For an appetizer - we got the pajeon. 

Here&#39;s the dish-by-dish breakdown:

- The dol sot bibimbap - Bean Sprouts. Gosari. Cucumber. Pickled Vegetables. Spinach. Fried Egg. Seaweed Flakes. I asked for a raw egg, which I&#39;m used to eating vice a fried egg on top. The waitress and hostess didn&#39;t know what I was talking about ... /sad

- The pork belly bulgogi was a little underwhelming, however, IMHO, it was bo ssam served with lettuce leaves, white rice, typical sides of pickled vegetables, doenjang (fermented bean paste) ... honestly, my bo ssam/pork belly bulgogi is much better. 

- The pajeon - it was huge, and very filling. It was a little greasy and it needed more scallions. The dipping sauce needed a little work - it needed more acid (lemon juice).

Overall, it&#39;s a good experience. I will try the kalbi next time, but I personally can make better Korean food and I&#39;m FILIPINO!",07/08/14,268,4,1,3,-7,2.7975,2.754,1.661,28.584999999999997,No,2177

A platter of thinly sliced meats was brought out, in addition to head on shrimp. We also had soup that was loaded with vegetables, meat, and noodles.

I guess the caliber of Korean cuisine was just not what I expected or what I am used to (given that I am a Northern California girl who grew up with an abundance of Korean restaurants in the vicinity of my hometown). 

Anyway, all biases aside, Koreana makes a good effort - and I figure that the style of Korean cuisine in the Midwest is just unlike that of either coast - so I really cannot hold Koreana responsible for that. The restaurant owners are Korean, and the majority of the restaurant patrons are Asian, which is always a good sign when trying out a new ethnic restaurant. The restaurant is relatively spacious, and for a place that does a lot of kBBQ, it does not leave a strong stench on your clothing, which is great. 
 
We chose to stick with our usual menu items: my mom ordered the stone bowl bibimbap and I ordered a seafood tofu soup. The bibimbap was average, and in all honesty, you really can&#39;t get bibimbap wrong. All you really need is the bibimbap paste/sauce to make any regular ol&#39; bowl of white rice taste like a bibimbap. The ingredients seemed plentiful enough, but once again, it didn&#39;t make a very big impression. 

My seafood tofu soup was all but too spicy for me. It wasn&#39;t until the piping hot bowl came to the table that I realized that the waitress had never asked me how spicy I wanted the tofu soup....well, I spent the next 10 minutes fishing out the layer of hot oil from the surface of my soup. Also, the &#39;seafood&#39; was a few measly pieces of calamari and oysters - really not enough to merit the extra cost. 

The banchan wasn&#39;t great either. The assortment was lacking, and honestly, all of the side dishes were kind of sad and limp looking. Usually, we go through a few refills of banchan over the duration of our meal, but here, we didn&#39;t even touch half of the side dishes. I noticed that many other neighboring tables also left their banchan untouched, which speaks volumes about the preparation of the side dishes.

I think Koreana suffices if you are in the area and really craving some sort - any sort - of Korean food.

koreana-schaumburg,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,Bet54D3CaX76ZMJMfs1UcA,"Texture and flavor - these are the reasons why Koreana stands out among other local Korean restaurants. Except for TTOWA, I can&#39;t think of another Korean restaurant I&#39;ve been to in the area which has executed both perfectly.

Don&#39;t miss the seafood pancake here. Full of seafood and egg flavor, this entree sized appetizer is what seafood hash browns would taste like. Tons of chopped seafood, slightly crispy but slightly wet at the same time -- a perfect combination.

The kalbi tang has a strong flavor of short rib with clear noodles and tons of green onion. It&#39;s a perfect soup to drink on a cold day but not so overwhelming you couldn&#39;t drink it on any day.

The spicy tofu here stands out because the tofu has a silky smooth melt-in-your-mouth texture. I&#39;m not vegetarian, but I couldn&#39;t stop myself from eating this.

One of my biggest gripes about stone bowl rice dishes is when the rice isn&#39;t crispy from the stone bowl. No problem here as the bibimbap was served extremely hot where you could hear the rice sizzle long after it is set on the table.

My favorite item was the rice cake with dumplings. Chewy rice cake with soft dumplings is probably one of my favorite chewy items next to mochi. The broth was perfectly light and but flavorful.

We ordered so many different things and they kept bringing us more dishes to try.  You definitely do not leave here hungry.  Lots of Korean people dining here so that is probably a good sign.  The only issue I had with the whole meal was the fact that the server runs the BBQ grill at the table.  Our server kept cross-contaminating raw meat with cooked meat and that is a huge NO-NO!  She would touch raw meat with the tongs and then pull cooked meat off the BBQ and plate it up.  We finally had to show her the error of her ways and asked her not to do that.  She didn&#39;t quite get it so we finally took over the grilling operation.  The owner of the restaurant came by and chatted with us for a few minutes and then brought us some Korean wine on the house.

Fast forward 6 hours....I was laying in bed, on the verge of good REM sleep when suddenly all hell broke loose. I had a gastrointestinal event like nothing I&#39;ve ever imagined. Cramps, sweating, bloating beyond my worst nightmare. I&#39;ve had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was almost like a skip in the park compared to what was going on inside me.

Then came the, uh, flatulence. Heavens to Murgatroyd, the sounds, like trumpets calling the demons back to Hell...the stench, like 1,000 rotten corpses vomited. I couldn&#39;t stand to stay in one room for fear of succumbing to my own odors.

But wait; there&#39;s more. 

What came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a coffee straw. I swear my sphincter was screaming. It felt like my delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste. 100% liquid. Flammable liquid. NAPALM. It was actually a bit humorous (for a nanosecond) as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible.

koreana-schaumburg,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,Bet54D3CaX76ZMJMfs1UcA,"Texture and flavor - these are the reasons why Koreana stands out among other local Korean restaurants. Except for TTOWA, I can&#39;t think of another Korean restaurant I&#39;ve been to in the area which has executed both perfectly.

Don&#39;t miss the seafood pancake here. Full of seafood and egg flavor, this entree sized appetizer is what seafood hash browns would taste like. Tons of chopped seafood, slightly crispy but slightly wet at the same time -- a perfect combination.

The kalbi tang has a strong flavor of short rib with clear noodles and tons of green onion. It&#39;s a perfect soup to drink on a cold day but not so overwhelming you couldn&#39;t drink it on any day.

The spicy tofu here stands out because the tofu has a silky smooth melt-in-your-mouth texture. I&#39;m not vegetarian, but I couldn&#39;t stop myself from eating this.

One of my biggest gripes about stone bowl rice dishes is when the rice isn&#39;t crispy from the stone bowl. No problem here as the bibimbap was served extremely hot where you could hear the rice sizzle long after it is set on the table.

My favorite item was the rice cake with dumplings. Chewy rice cake with soft dumplings is probably one of my favorite chewy items next to mochi. The broth was perfectly light and but flavorful.

We ordered so many different things and they kept bringing us more dishes to try.  You definitely do not leave here hungry.  Lots of Korean people dining here so that is probably a good sign.  The only issue I had with the whole meal was the fact that the server runs the BBQ grill at the table.  Our server kept cross-contaminating raw meat with cooked meat and that is a huge NO-NO!  She would touch raw meat with the tongs and then pull cooked meat off the BBQ and plate it up.  We finally had to show her the error of her ways and asked her not to do that.  She didn&#39;t quite get it so we finally took over the grilling operation.  The owner of the restaurant came by and chatted with us for a few minutes and then brought us some Korean wine on the house.  

A great time was had by all. 

Fast forward 6 hours....I was laying in bed, on the verge of good REM sleep when suddenly all hell broke loose. I had a gastrointestinal event like nothing I&#39;ve ever imagined. Cramps, sweating, bloating beyond my worst nightmare. I&#39;ve had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was almost like a skip in the park compared to what was going on inside me.

Then came the, uh, flatulence. Heavens to Murgatroyd, the sounds, like trumpets calling the demons back to Hell...the stench, like 1,000 rotten corpses vomited. I couldn&#39;t stand to stay in one room for fear of succumbing to my own odors.

But wait; there&#39;s more. 

What came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a coffee straw. I swear my sphincter was screaming. It felt like my delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste. 100% liquid. Flammable liquid. NAPALM. It was actually a bit humorous (for a nanosecond) as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible.

The seafood pajun was delicious. Perfect ratio of all the elements! The dukbokki was awesome too. I can&#39;t handle spicy well but this one had a very subtle spicy with a hit of tangy/sweet. These really bumped up my score just because I love a good pajun and this is my favorite dukbokki so far.

koreana-schaumburg,Sydney D.,9JyxSuVWNqSS7W4Q_Qz_Fg,bnRBGjNKJnX9sOPtjUjx5w,"Great authentic Korean food! The husband and I went here for a late lunch while we were up north. I have had Korean food from time to time but never have I ate at an actual Korean restaurant. Goodness I am so glad we came here. 

Appetizer: Fried Dumplings: crispy outside and gooey deliciousness inside. These were the best dumplings we ever had. I could eat them everyday. I barely use the sauce because they were so good on their own. I truly suggest trying these babies.

Main Course: Since we were grilling our own food (more details further below), we had to purchase two proteins - beef brisket and thick pork belly. The pork belly came out first. The ladies set up the grill and put it on for us. It was our first time doing this so the wonderful ladies did not mind essentially cooking the meat for us. I felt kinda bad but I am glad they were so helpful. One of the ladies show us how to make the lettuce wrap and the best sides to put in it. Oh boy. So flavorful. So tender. So heavenly. The hubby who doesn&#39;t even eat pork devour half the dish. :) On to the brisket, as a beef loving girl I couldn&#39;t get enough. It was thinly sliced and cooked quickly. It did take a little more to enhance the flavor but it was lovely. I have to say I preferred the pork belly. o

Sides: With every meal, Koreans have several side dishes, kimchi being a primary.  We had two different kinds including Napa cabbage kimchi, a staple. It wasn&#39;t the best kimchi I ever had but it was still enjoyable. We also had cole slaw, bean sprouts, a potato like item that was sweet. Something that resembled pickles but was not tarty just mushy. And finally a beefy thing. Have no idea what it was but it was good. 

Bonus: With the order of brisket, you will get Korean Miso soup. How can I explain this spicy, hot bowl of dreams. I love Japanese Miso. I truly do, but this topped all miso for me. I am not jaded and nothing would match this. It was extremely temperature hot so don&#39;t dig right in like I did. Wait but don&#39;t forget it.

Overall: The experience was phenomenal and the food even better. The aunties there were cold but friendly and it seems the local Koreans like to visit this place often.

Stopped in for lunch on a snowy January day. The place was pretty full. It was the boys first time having korean bbq and only my second.

We ordered the combo with: kalbi, beef bulogi, chicken bulogi, shrimp, veggies, and pork for ~$40. Being newbies at this, Im sure our waitress thought we needed some help.

First, the sides. My favorite was this shredded beef, it was sweet and spicy.

The best meat was the  thinly splices of beef, not sure what the name was. They all started to mix together. I also ordered the spicy soft tofu soup with seafood. It was delicious. Silky tofu and a nicely flavored broth that was not too spicy.

While we were finishing up our meal, a man, perhaps an owner, stopped by and helped make sure we were doing well cooking our meats. He then came back a few minutes later to bring us 2 hot bowls of tofu soup. He noticed we had finished our white rice and brought us a new side of white rice to share. He insisted that we put some rice in the soup. It was so nice of him to do that and give it to us on the house. Totally unexpected and totally awesome.

The lunch specials are now $7.99 (still not a bad value for what you get) and there was plenty of seating available.

:: NON-BBQ FOODS ::
(1) Galbitang 
     - broth was very bland &amp; not rich tasting - as if not simmered long enough with seasoned ribs or daikon 
     - way too much noodles  &amp; barely any broth 
     - the chopped up scallions could have been a cooked a little longer

(2) BiBim Neng Myun
    - best part of the whole meal
    - noodles were very chewy
    - tangy iced broth (I added more vinegar for more tanginess)
    - just enough spicy gochujang dressing to give it a kick

(3) Banchans
    - kimchi was too sour tasting

koreana-schaumburg,Sydney D.,9JyxSuVWNqSS7W4Q_Qz_Fg,bnRBGjNKJnX9sOPtjUjx5w,"Great authentic Korean food! The husband and I went here for a late lunch while we were up north. I have had Korean food from time to time but never have I ate at an actual Korean restaurant. Goodness I am so glad we came here. 

Appetizer: Fried Dumplings: crispy outside and gooey deliciousness inside. These were the best dumplings we ever had. I could eat them everyday. I barely use the sauce because they were so good on their own. I truly suggest trying these babies.

Main Course: Since we were grilling our own food (more details further below), we had to purchase two proteins - beef brisket and thick pork belly. The pork belly came out first. The ladies set up the grill and put it on for us. It was our first time doing this so the wonderful ladies did not mind essentially cooking the meat for us. I felt kinda bad but I am glad they were so helpful. One of the ladies show us how to make the lettuce wrap and the best sides to put in it. Oh boy. So flavorful. So tender. So heavenly. The hubby who doesn&#39;t even eat pork devour half the dish. :) On to the brisket, as a beef loving girl I couldn&#39;t get enough. It was thinly sliced and cooked quickly. It did take a little more to enhance the flavor but it was lovely. I have to say I preferred the pork belly. o

Sides: With every meal, Koreans have several side dishes, kimchi being a primary.  We had two different kinds including Napa cabbage kimchi, a staple. It wasn&#39;t the best kimchi I ever had but it was still enjoyable. We also had cole slaw, bean sprouts, a potato like item that was sweet. Something that resembled pickles but was not tarty just mushy. And finally a beefy thing. Have no idea what it was but it was good. 

Bonus: With the order of brisket, you will get Korean Miso soup. How can I explain this spicy, hot bowl of dreams. I love Japanese Miso. I truly do, but this topped all miso for me. I am not jaded and nothing would match this. It was extremely temperature hot so don&#39;t dig right in like I did. Wait but don&#39;t forget it.

Overall: The experience was phenomenal and the food even better. The aunties there were cold but friendly and it seems the local Koreans like to visit this place often. I couldn&#39;t continue to describe how good this place was. Just listen: I will be dreaming of this food for a very long time.

Stopped in for lunch on a snowy January day. The place was pretty full. It was the boys first time having korean bbq and only my second.

We ordered the combo with: kalbi, beef bulogi, chicken bulogi, shrimp, veggies, and pork for ~$40. Being newbies at this, Im sure our waitress thought we needed some help.

First, the sides. My favorite was this shredded beef, it was sweet and spicy.

The best meat was the  thinly splices of beef, not sure what the name was. They all started to mix together. I also ordered the spicy soft tofu soup with seafood. It was delicious. Silky tofu and a nicely flavored broth that was not too spicy.

While we were finishing up our meal, a man, perhaps an owner, stopped by and helped make sure we were doing well cooking our meats. He then came back a few minutes later to bring us 2 hot bowls of tofu soup. He noticed we had finished our white rice and brought us a new side of white rice to share. He insisted that we put some rice in the soup. It was so nice of him to do that and give it to us on the house. Totally unexpected and totally awesome.

Koreana has been in this location for something like 30 years probably. Put it this way, I remember my grandma buying me lunch here when I &#34;graduated&#34; elementary school, and by that time, we had already known about this place and had been coming here occasionally. That being said, since then, this place has had like 5+ different owners, all trying to do something different. Unfortunately, through the heyday of Korean BBQ, Koreana just kept failing, because nobody would come here! Their regular food was mediocre, and their BBQ paled in both taste and value. I mean, c&#39;mon! We had Garden Buffet, Gangnam Galbi (the original Gangnam Style), San Soo Gap San, and other places in the original Chicago K-Town! Nobody went to freaking Hoffman Estates to get Korean food! But, every time Korean failed, there was another wide eyed (wow that&#39;s racist!) Korean family who wanted to take the reigns. We must be on our 5th owner by now! 

Anyway, I randomly took my parents here for dinner recently and noticed that, for the first time, there were actually PEOPLE here! It&#39;s usually so quiet! Then I Yelped and was surprised to find people were actually commenting on their KBBQ! I was like, whoa, no way! Did a decent KBBQ place just pop up here in Hoffman?! So, I picked up my parents from the airport one night, and came here to try their BBQ..

CHADOL
We sat at a grilling table, but they had to bring out a portable butane burner with the stone pan for the chadol. Guess it slides through the grill. The meat was ok, definitely passable. It wasn&#39;t all that fatty, so that&#39;s good, but regardless, it was a bit chewy, unlike Cho Sun Ok. All in all, decent.

CHADOL SURPRISE
I don&#39;t know what this is called, but if you get Chadolbaegi, you automatically (I think) get bbokumbap. Basically, after you&#39;re done grilling all your chadol, they take the hot pan, dump a bunch of rice, and your kimchi, spinach, bean sprouts, and some other kimchi-like stuff in there, along with some of the last slices of chadol, to make a Korean fried rice. Cho Sun Ok is notorious for this, because theirs is so good! Koreana? Sorry. Lacks in seasoning and lacks in spice. Flavor&#39;s are all right, but you almost want to sprinkle some salt on this thing. Certainly edible, but not all that enjoyable.

KALBI
Ok, here we go, this is it right? WRONG! Slices are pretty chewy too, and the meat&#39;s not the greatest quality. Sometimes you get slices where you chew forever, and eventually have to spit it out...gracefully. That alone puts a huge damper on it, but the flavor also suffers. Their marinade has way too much ginger in it. It&#39;s not like your tongue is burning with ginger, but the key to a great kalbi marinade is the blending of all the flavors. It should come out as a sweet, smoky, salty masterpiece. You should never actually, specifically, taste the ginger. So I really didn&#39;t enjoy this kalbi.

NAKJI BOKUM
This is basically octopus cooked in a sweet &amp; spicy sauce, deep red in color. The octopus was bleh, tasted a bit too much like the ocean. The sauce was decent, although little to no spice at all. Quick Tip, mix this with the Chadol Surprise and it&#39;s very palatable!

MOOL NENGMYUN
For some reason, young&#39;ns (20&#39;s-40&#39;s) love to get ice cold Nengmyun after KBBQ. I think it&#39;s absolutely refreshing. Older folks don&#39;t share the sentiment though, for some reason. Anyway, their myun (noodles) are very very chewy and actually a little hard. It&#39;d seem easy to cut with your teeth, but it&#39;s not that easy. The broth is very plain. Couple slices of beef, a slice of pear and an egg. No radish, no cucumbers. The broth itself is pretty light, to the point where when you add vinegar, it doesn&#39;t taste like &#34;Vinegary Nengmyun&#34; it tastes like &#34;Vinegar.&#34; But, definitely gets points for being ice cold, with crushed ice in it. I definitely would NOT come here just to get this, but it did it&#39;s job post KBBQ meal.

Banchan were fresh and tasty. Bulgogi was oh so good. Chap chae (sp?) was also delicious. I was given a spicy soybean paste soup (Doenjang jjigae) along with the Bulgogi, which was great! I didn&#39;t really see that listed on the menu so it was a pleasant surprise. The miso soup my cousin received, however, was very bland. But, it&#39;s miso soup; that&#39;s far from what we came here to eat :D

Our bill came to $32 - I&#39;d say that&#39;s damn reasonable for two full bellies of goodness!

Also, the service here was great. I mean, probably not to the level large American chains adhere to, but I find their ass-kissing style to just be too much anyway. BUT, compared to other Korean restaurants I&#39;ve been to, the servers here were super friendly and very helpful. For me, perfection!

I am not a Korean food expert (hence only 4 stars, cause I don&#39;t think I could defend 5 with my experience), but I&#39;ve been to Cho Sun Ok in Chicago and.. this place has better tasting food (what we got at least) and the service was awesome.

The owner (I forgot his name, I have to go back and ask now) is an unassuming man with a quirky sense of humor. When I asked for a bottle of soju, he came back with his own shot glass at one point and shared a shot with us. The sides kept coming, the Bulls were on and winning against the Hornets.

The environment is quite simple and has tables to the side which have vents for those wanting Korean BBQ or those who want prepared meals from the kitchen.  

One person in our group had the mul neng myun which my friend enjoyed.  She&#39;s also had the bibim neng myun but with the rising temps, she wanted to cool down.  My friend and I ordered similar dishes: stir fried squid and stir fried octopus.  While some places might be similar, these dishes were cooked to their proper tenderness and spiced right. 

The food here is good but the number of menu items were pretty limited and the prices for the Korean BBQ was pretty high.  If you&#39;re looking for a cheap meal, there are very few options.

Service:  Koreana has restored my faith in Chicago area Korean restaurants, which are notorious for terrible service, and they have revolutionized the system by adding a &#34;call&#34; button at each table.  Yeah, I&#39;m serious.  You push the button and they come to you, it&#39;s brilliant.  

Food:  Their marinated kalbi (short rib) is deliciously seasoned and perfectly juicy and tender.  It&#39;s one of the best I&#39;ve had in the Chicago area, and that&#39;s saying a lot.  Our server did an expert job of cooking the entire batch for us, which was unusual since they usually leave you on your own.  The sides and stews were great, but you really have to come for their awesome bbq.

Banchan were fresh and tasty. Bulgogi was oh so good. Chap chae (sp?) was also delicious. I was given a spicy soybean paste soup (Doenjang jjigae) along with the Bulgogi, which was great! I didn&#39;t really see that listed on the menu so it was a pleasant surprise. The miso soup my cousin received, however, was very bland. But, it&#39;s miso soup; that&#39;s far from what we came here to eat :D

Our bill came to $32 - I&#39;d say that&#39;s damn reasonable for two full bellies of goodness!

Also, the service here was great. I mean, probably not to the level large American chains adhere to, but I find their ass-kissing style to just be too much anyway. BUT, compared to other Korean restaurants I&#39;ve been to, the servers here were super friendly and very helpful. For me, perfection!

I am not a Korean food expert (hence only 4 stars, cause I don&#39;t think I could defend 5 with my experience), but I&#39;ve been to Cho Sun Ok in Chicago and.. this place has better tasting food (what we got at least) and the service was awesome.

Our party of five split an order of beef bulgogi and Korean bbq combination which included beef galbi, ribeye steak, jumbo shrimp, mushrooms and chicken and pork bulgogi.

The environment is quite simple and has tables to the side which have vents for those wanting Korean BBQ or those who want prepared meals from the kitchen.  

One person in our group had the mul neng myun which my friend enjoyed.  She&#39;s also had the bibim neng myun but with the rising temps, she wanted to cool down.  My friend and I ordered similar dishes: stir fried squid and stir fried octopus.  While some places might be similar, these dishes were cooked to their proper tenderness and spiced right. 

The food here is good but the number of menu items were pretty limited and the prices for the Korean BBQ was pretty high.  If you&#39;re looking for a cheap meal, there are very few options.

Service:  Koreana has restored my faith in Chicago area Korean restaurants, which are notorious for terrible service, and they have revolutionized the system by adding a &#34;call&#34; button at each table.  Yeah, I&#39;m serious.  You push the button and they come to you, it&#39;s brilliant.  

Food:  Their marinated kalbi (short rib) is deliciously seasoned and perfectly juicy and tender.  It&#39;s one of the best I&#39;ve had in the Chicago area, and that&#39;s saying a lot.  Our server did an expert job of cooking the entire batch for us, which was unusual since they usually leave you on your own.  The sides and stews were great, but you really have to come for their awesome bbq.    

So put on some scrubby outfit you don&#39;t care about since you WILL come out smelling like a giant slab of cooked meat, come hungry, and get your MEAT on.

Dining out is no cheap task, but when I do, I make sure to have all my bases covered! 

But on a very spontaneous evening, me and the bf were roaming around the Northwest Suburbs looking for some comfort FOOD.  Indian? Nah.  Thai? Too ordinary.  Korean bbq- yep, I&#39;m always game for that!

So the stars aligned for this place, and surprises that turn out successfully are always welcome in my book.  The ambience was my favorite kinda joint: Mom and Pop with friendly service. To add to the authenticity to the place and the stamp or approval, all the dinners were of Korean descent, and had massive amounts of food at their table.  I couldn&#39;t see this being a crummy spot with all the spreads that were laid out.

Marinated chicken was neatly grilled atop sheet of foil that was placed on gas grill.  Thoughtful, since no small bits were lost thru the grates.  Beef kalbi was well marinated.  Fresh selection of panchan, although not the largest (San Soo) or the best (Cho Sun).

What can I say but...victory! Koreana serves up a delicious stone bowl filled with all the yummy fix&#39;ns. Along with my food came a nice variety of banchan (those tasty little side dishes) and also miso soup. The miso soup was actually the only thing that was a bit bland and meh. Everything else was deeeeeelicious. My fiance was nursing a cold and deciding on a soup to order that would warm him up, but not be too spicy. One of the owners - an older man - came right over to our table and asked us if we had any questions or needed any help. We told him our conundrum, and he effusively told us he&#39;d whip us up the perfect soup. When our food came out, the soup was delicious! The perfect level of spice, and filled with all kinds of delicious noodles, veg, meat, etc. The owner also insisted my fiance try some spicy pickled onions, claiming this would be sure to clear his cold. He emerged with a special little plate of the pickled delights (at no charge). 

This place was jam packed with folks on a Friday night around 6pm, and about 95% were speaking Korean, which seems to bode well for the authenticity of the food. I found everything we had to be delicious and just as good as the city staples SSGS, Cho Sun Ok, Solga (for their dolsot bi bim bop), etc. The restaurant is very cozy, and the owners and waitresses are really helpful and friendly. The owners walk around, shmoozing, joking and laughing with patrons. Very much a family run business. It&#39;s great! The owners make you feel very welcome.

koreana-schaumburg,Yane Y.,kdLGCFPWc1meyVPOeKPWng,SDvnkN0UKxvbd72vUtocOg,"I came here tonight with a party of 3 to check out their Korean food. After reading about the Korean BBQ (K-BBQ), my husband and I ordered their &#34;Combo (For 2)&#34; BBQ, which included shrimp, bulgogi, kalbi, chicken kalbi, daeji bulgogi (pork ribeye), mushrooms, and onion. Our friend ordered the dduk-mandoo-gook (rice cake and dumpling soup). 

SERVICE (Preface): The service wasn&#39;t that great (NOTE: Don&#39;t stop reading here. You MUST keep reading to understand why I note this as such). Because we had K-BBQ, we had someone coming around frequently to cook our BBQ food. However, once we were done, they didn&#39;t swing by anymore. One woman came by once to refill our waters once without asking. 

SERVICE (Cont&#39;d): Towards the end, we were disappointed that they didn&#39;t swing by anymore and check up on us; ask if we were okay, etc. We were waiting for them to come with our check!! We waited and waited and waited. But then (&#34;light bulb goes off!&#34;), we realized that they have the SERVICE BUTTONS. We were thinking like Americans and not like Koreans!! American-style: Be served well: the servers come by all the time and ask you if you need anything, how your food is, etc.... Korean-style: Let the servers know when you need something!!! Totally forgot that this restaurant has the service buttons. When you need something, you push that little button with weird characters that is next to your table. That gets the servers attention! They come when you push the button and you can let them know at that time!!! Totally forgot that they had this! OUR FAULT.

FOOD (K-BBQ): Portions were reasonable for the price you paid. I thought that the portions for the BBQ was pretty generous. However, I wasn&#39;t impressed by the seasonings. They were &#34;okay&#34;. Personally, I didn&#39;t think they had enough flavor/seasoning/marinade. They were too lightly seasoned and could have had more flavor. I felt this way about all of them. The two best that I enjoyed were the (1) bulgogi, and (2) daeji bulgogi (pork bulgogi). The chicken kalbi lacked flavor and wasn&#39;t too impressive. The kalbi - same as chicken kalbi. 

FOOD (Dduk Mandoo Gook &#34;rice cake and dumpling soup&#34;): While I did not taste this myself, he said it was good. He enjoyed it. After reconsidering some of the reviews and going ourself, I am leaning towards the fact that their dishes (soups, jjigaes, etc.) may be better than their BBQ, but I&#39;ll report back after I go back again.

COST: This is a relatively more expensive Korean restaurant. I give it $$ (not sure what yelp has it at). On average, your dish (be it soup, noodles, appetizers, etc.) are greater than $9.99. If you&#39;re looking for cheap Korean food, this is not your place. If you want to take somebody to impress them with more expensive food, this may be it. WHILE the food is slightly more expensive, I think they make up for it with very generous portions. The dduk-mandoo-gook was fairly large. The guy only ate 1/2 of it! 

AMBIANCE: For a Korean restaurant in Chicago, it was clean, and they had nice decor. Not overly fancy but not too casual. 

CONCLUSION: All in all, a decent Korean restaurant (not cheap). Was not impressed with their BBQ, but it is still A-OK, and I DO want to go back to try their non-BBQ food. Other peoples&#39; non-BBQ dishes looked tasty. Will go back again, but not for K-BBQ. Go to &#34;Woo Li Mal&#34; for all you can eat K-BBQ with meat that has better/more flavor!)

I don&#39;t like driving into Chicago for it as I live in Dekalb and it&#39;s a bit far already (however, it&#39;s not my fault that Dekalb has nothing in the way of diverse food offerings). 
I&#39;ve had both varieties of samgyeopsal, pork bulgogi, beef bulgogi, and probably a few other things I don&#39;t remember as far as BBQ goes. The samgyeopsal is my favorite but it&#39;s all extremely good. I recently went with my roommate and had dolsot bibimbap and found that theirs is excellent, so it&#39;s probably not much of a stretch to say their whole menu is good. 
Their tea is also one of my favorite things on the planet, although they don&#39;t serve it in summer, that just makes me want it that much more by fall.
They give a pretty good selection of banchan that is refillable, including kimchi, potato, jalapeno beef (is there a better name for this? idk), coleslaw, bean sprouts, seaweed, radish, and more. I usually end up with 8-10 every time I go. Also, if you get BBQ, you get a bowl of soondubu jjigae as well.
The service is fantastic for a Korean restaurant. I hate when American restaurants force servers to hover over me and ask about my food every 2 minutes; the people here usually ask once or twice, or not at all if they&#39;re busy and I love it. Obviously it&#39;s not for everyone, though.

3. Fast Service
4. Good Quality Banchans (Side dishes)

3. Prices are a little steep for designated portion sizes. (like 19.00 for 10 thin slices of short rib)

My bf and I wanted to try something different and more authentic Korean food, the boss suggested we should try out the Du Buk Ki(Spicy Rice Cake w/ fishcake and squid). He told us that it was really popular in Korea, and they make it the best in the country. My bf and I decided to try it out....all I can say is....OMG it was delicious!!!! I&#39;m not sure whether they make it the best in the country, but it is definitely more than good enough to satisfy me! We were also served with mini free appetizers, which was also yummy. I ordered bibimbop and my bf had a soup (w/ clear noodles and mx vegetables, beef, and comes with rice).  They were equally delicious. 

The service was incredible as well. We were approached by over 2-3 different servers just to check up on us whether everything was good and if we needed anything else.

My husband ordered the bibimbap and enjoyed the fact that it had a LOT of stuff inside of it, with a generous portion of bulgogi....he&#39;s been to other places where the meat is kind of meager, so the caveman side of him enjoyed the mucho meat :)

They do try their best but there is way more square footage than their meager staff can handle during peak hours. The food is a cut above the other Korean restaurants in the immediate area so I go here by default.

Their lunch specials are the best value for miles around. You get tons of food for either $4.95 or $5.95, the latter price includes chicken. It&#39;s barely smaller than their much more expensive super combination plate and contains all the same items.

They really took the time to explain everything to us and there were at least 5 different staff members checking in on us, asking if we want refills on the complementary side dishes, etc. All BBQ entrees come with these side dishes as well as Korean Miso soup which is so good, has some spice and tofu and veggies in it so way more exciting that traditional miso soup.

We ordered the food, and about half hour later, only 1/4 food came out. WTF? And she was giving us excuses on how they get ready for appointment people, and Im like wtf? Seriously? If the food didnt come within few minutes, we would have left. We are not blaming the waitresses, but the chef&#39;s basic skills are not developed. Should I return? I think not.

koreana-schaumburg,Mark B.,lZzKS-UOJCP4AMYiLIq3MA,rfZ5zRy80wxVftQTFeMJYg,"With my son heading to South Korea for a month we&#39;ve made a point of trying some of the local Korean restaurants lately.

Koreana is in my old stomping grounds and I had been a number of times in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s.
I had not been since I moved back to IL.

The place is pretty much how I remember it.
The dcor has an Asian flare but isn&#39;t completely over the top.
When we went for a late Saturday lunch it was busy, but not crowded.

Prices are a bit higher than a typical Chinese restaurant, but with cause in my opinion.

Our waitress was the owner&#39;s wife and she was very helpful in picking dishes that our son would likely see while in South Korea.  
We enjoyed a very good miso soup and a spicy miso soup.
The traditional plates of side dishes came out and they were excellent.
They were flavorful and spicy without destroying your taste buds for the rest of the meal.

We enjoyed a shrimp and rice stir fry, grilled Spanish mackerel and a beef rib, make-it-yourself lettuce wrap dish.

The shrimp and rice was quite good, but not far from a more typical Chinese version, which was expected.
The grilled mackerel was excellent!  Note, mackerel is an oily and more dense fleshed fish.  If you do not like a &#34;fishy&#34; fish.. do not order the mackerel.. 
The beef rib dish was really tender and tasty.  

The owner came by and we shared that our son was heading to South Korea for an extended trip.
He helped him figure out how to eat the rib dish, then hung out with us and provided lots of great insights on the food, culture and activities available in South Korea.
Great Host, Great Food.

koreana-schaumburg,Matthew K.,715Nhkx5hzTBGLIBpbz6-w,nJpT4gcOMCTC4X1Dk9TWlg,"I really enjoyed the BBQ here at Koreana (or &#34;House of Taste&#34; as their guest ticket calls them).  That&#39;s what they do best, and that&#39;s what you should stick to.

The service is prompt--so much so that you really do not need appetizers under any circumstance.  We ordered a couple noodle dishes in addition to Kalbe beef and other BBQ favorites.  I definitely recommend that you save your money by not ordering the noodle dishes.  They are overpriced, taste average, and are completely outshined by the BBQ.

Service was really good.  The servers were very attentive, and there is a button you can push at any time if you need assistance.  The only complaint that I have is that they do not bring water out unless you ask for it.

Definitely make a stop at Koreana for some tasty BBQ next time you&#39;re in the neighborhood!

Despite being packed on a Sunday night they found us a new table that was away from the door after we complained about a draft. The interior was clean and relaxed. We were eating at like 8:30pm on a Sunday and it was totally full so I&#39;m guessing there may be a wait during prime time.

The seafood pajun was huge and delicious - the two of us shared that and a single order of kalbi and were stuffed. Plenty of side dishes served with the kalbi left us very full and unable to finish it all. The Kalbi itself really could use some seasoning but the pajun, prices and service made it worth-while for me. Will definitely be back",31/10/11,88,4,1,3,4,2.6504,1.859,0.114,7.027,No,810

We got stuck at the table next to the kitchen which is a pet pieve of my boyfriends so we asked to move to a different table. They had plenty open. We were told that they couldn&#39;t move us those were all taken for reservations. I found this surprising as the table we were at had a grill and those didn&#39;t. I would think people requesting reservations would cook there own food. I honestly don&#39;t think they wanted to move us to another table. They had plenty of tables for four people open. Also the table was taped togather on the one side and was greasy. Kind of gross they could do a better job cleaning the tables off here. We were also basically on top of another table which made it very cramped eating here. For dinner we all had the  Bulgogi. The Bulgogi had a great taste but was a little on the greasy side. The Miso soup that came with it was also quite good. The portion sizes were also nice and big here. Over all I really enjoyed the food but was a bit turned off that they gave us such a crappy table when they weren&#39;t busy and the grease sides of the table.

Service was just great. I love this family and their commitment to this restaurant. The owner even came out and gave us a farewell. Now that doesn&#39;t happen anytime soon, even when there were still customers inside. The panchan (side dishes) were great, and the seng kalbi (unmarinated short ribs) was very fresh and tasty.

Dcor: The first thing I noticed was the curtain covering the entryway... was I entering a night club or a restaurant. Then, just after stepping through, I realized that it is probably because you enter into the bar area and it is meant to make it feel larger and/or more private? Not sure. Anyway, the bar area is pretty sizeable with a bunch of stools and a lively vibe. As you progress further in you are greeted by the hostess who is the gatekeeper to the dining room. Well, one of the two dining rooms. There is one up front (pretty small as it is dominated by a big center island table) and one in back (that, from the looks of it, seemed much larger and a bit more subdued - probably because it was secluded from the bar).

Staff: The hostess was friendly and our waiter was great. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly as well. As far as the cooks, everything came out hot and tasted fresh but we did hit a snag near the end of our meal... something was going on in the kitchen and it caused a SIGNIFICANT delay. But, it was a small occurrence.

Food/Drinks: We started off with a house cocktail (I forget which one, but it was tasty) and a Limonada (very tasty and sizable) before jumping into some apps: Guacamole (pretty meh, seemed as if it was JUST avocado...) and we added the Salsa Trio (all were tasty and the Habanero one was GREAT!). For our meal we all ordered assorted tacos and shared. We had: Pastor (one of our favorites), Diabla (meh, pretty passable and lacking... not that great), Bien Trucha (pretty enjoyable and tasty), and Pulpito (WOW! Amazing!). Each order came with four tacos and they are about what you&#39;d expect size-wise from &#34;street tacos.&#34; As I mentioned before, it took FOREVER for them to bring out the Pulpito so they gave us some little app for free - it was four chips with some kind of crap or something on top... it was VERY tasty as well. So, ultimately, the food here is enjoyable you just have to find your favorites.

Value: The prices are really not terrible and, if you order well, you will leave full (both your stomach and your wallet).

We had an enjoyable first meal at A Toda Madre and are already looking forward to returning again - we want to try all of the tacos at least once!",26/08/16,279,4,3,5,60,6.692399999999999,3.344,0.906,16.749,No,2364

At least they didn&#39;t try to sell it off as a T-bone Steak. Saying: This is the way we serve T-bone Steak with a flair you wouldn&#39;t dare challenge.

I had lunch at this upscale almost uncious, presumptuous Mexican Restaurant yesterday. I have had many servings of Al Pastor and this was unlike any I have yet to have. It left me speechless. A guest had the fish taco made with Tilapia. Some years ago, When I found out how Tilapia was raised, I swore off this fish forever. Yet here it was featured. At the urging of my guest, I sampled this taco and it didn&#39;t taste like Tilapia. All I could say was that it was some kind of a fish. That&#39;s all. 

I will say that my Line Drink was astounding and my guest said the Sangria made here is as good as Yerba Buena.

You&#39;re going to think I&#39;m prejudice but ... Ok fine I am! I am Mexican born in Tijuana and very proud of Mexico, Mexican food and Mexican drinks (sorry about the Mexican music I like some types but others not so much) and when I found this place smack in the middle of Glenn Ellyn (not a very Latino neighborhood) and not a place known for Mexican food and then it&#39;s &#34;gourmet&#34; tacos which is kind of pretentious to begin with and usually just ruins Mexican food and leaves you wanting Mexican fast food! 

I was wrong. 

I got the a toda madre tacos and they were heavenly everything from the pineapple pico de gallo to the salsa cruda, and the tacos themselves were just excellent!

A Toda Madre is the real deal, and it&#39;s really REALLY good.

We went after a recent Ale Fest in Lisle (Arboretum) on a hot Saturday and I had pumped ATM up so much, offered a guarantee (if you don&#39;t like it, feel free to kick me).  No one kicked me, partly because they were full after dinner and I think partly because my recommendation was enjoyed.

Gourmet street tacos is what they&#39;re known for, but the elote, guacamole and ceviche are very fresh and it all blends together for a great experience.    The shrimp and avocado tacos and al pastor are the best in my book and the soft shell crab tacos were a hit as well.

And then there is the food!!! Was not expecting this outstanding and exciting contemporary Mexican small plates and other dishes with this level of flavor, freshness and authenticity. 

So what rocked...? 

1. Guacamole del Dia, guacamole infused with fresh plum, cilantro, red onion and charred Serrano was unique and delicious.

3.

4. Esquites-grilled corn,Epazote butter,  lemon aioli, Queso Comida Chile Piquin
5 Carlota!!! Mexican Maria cookies with tequila crema and key lime curd. The dense texture and tangy flavor was a big winner. 

Reasonably priced drinks.  The real icing and cherry on the whole night was Azucena, our delightful server who we enjoyed thoroughly.

The place was packed with gaggles of women enjoying a night out with friends and being away the swirling madness of home, kids, husband, chores etc. It never ceases to amaze me How groups of women, when out together can all talk and listen at the same time and process everything they are all simultaneously talking about and listening to. It is truly a phenomenon no man will ever understand (part of a long list of such stuff), but their spirit and joy in being out with each other filled the space with lots of positive energy (and noise!!! :-D)

Same bartender - two new tacos - the skirt steak with chorizo and the diabla shrimp. Both were excellent although wildly different. The skirt steak is probably the closest to a traditional Mexican taco here and yet it is more flavorful with the addition of the chorizo and green (avocado? sauce). The diabla shrimp was 6 or maybe 6.5 on a 10 point heat scale - nowhere near as hot as they make it sound. Still very flavorful.

I also want to note that our waiter had impeccable timing. The only down side is the small and narrow space proved to be extremely loud; however, it was a small price to pay for what was an incredible meal.

The chips, bean dip, and salsa we started with were perfect to whet my appetite. Then...we ate until we were stuffed. 

We started with:
--Tostada de Ceviche: This was some of the tastiest ceviche I&#39;ve ever had and an very unique combo of ingredients - tilapia, avocado, chile oil, cucumber, apple, crispy leeks.
--Pica Pica Brochetas: I&#39;ll take just about bacon-wrapped anything, let alone shrimp - and this pineapple/lime/onion combo did not disappoint.

I could have eaten a dozen of their tacos but settled on splitting two orders:
--Chilango Tacos: Grilled skirt steak, chicharron, cilantro-onion, salsa verde cruda
--A Toda Madre Tacos: Pastor marinated pork, chihuahua, pineapple pico de gallo, salsa morita

And, on the side, we also shared a small plate (although, I could have eaten a gallon bucket of this):
--Esquites: An entire bowl of Mexican street corn...um, yes, please.

We also each had two beers from a nicely curated selection of both Mexican and local beers. I wish I could have hollowed out a leg for some dessert.

Great atmosphere and the personnel was very nice and inviting. The food was fantastic! You can&#39;t go wrong with the quality of food a toda madre has to offer. What sealed the deal for us was our awesome waitress, Shannon. She seemed like a one-lady army with almost too many tables to take care of. But, she was extremely knowledgeable and funny-while being on top of her game. Coming from the food service, I recognize good talent on the floor. Very well done.

I loved the Geneva location. Quirky, loud, fun.. I always sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen.

Glen Ellyn is a whole bunch bigger. Still loud, still crowded and the food is still excellent. It&#39;s just not as quirky (it&#39;s in a storefront, not in an old split level home)

We started with the gratis chips.. they are very good, but don&#39;t come with salsa.. but instead a smooth bean dip. Different, tastes good, not sure how we feel about that...

We needed some Guacamole.... ordered it, and it was very good. Not spectacular, but very good.

For the meal we wanted tacos.. so we ordered two plates to share (Yay! I always get more that way!) I ordered the Bien Trucha Tacos... (Steak and Chorizo) 4 of them for 11 bucks and they were terrific.. I would get them again (oh, wait.. I have!) 

Lisa ordered the Pescadillas, so like.. this is the difference between your regular Taqueria and a place like this... also 11 bucks for 4. Swordfish taco&#39;s that were on the &#34;squirm in your seat&#34; side of awesomeness. Really delicious!

I just needed to try the drunken beans, I love beans but I found the beer taste (and smell) to be overpowering (kind of reminded me of waking up in college after a big night and the bottles/cups/smell are everywhere) I couldn&#39;t eat them and neither could Lisa. But that&#39;s just a personal preference thing.

All in all, a somewhat reasonably priced meal (expensive compared to your local taco place, but not for a very good meal) and a nice way to spend an hour or so. 

We&#39;ll be back, I just wish they were better at salsa&#39;s and not so cheap about them.. next time, I&#39;ll sneak my own bottle in (hopefully the restaurant doesn&#39;t read these reviews)",07/08/15,219,4,3,5,91,5.9399999999999995,3.575,0.177,14.248,No,1832

Maybe it&#39;s because I was expecting salsa and it was beans or something... Still not sure what it was. The worst part of our experience was our server from the start she had an attitude. We sat down for 8 mins before getting acknowledged by the server, she told us she would be with us in a minute and then it was longer. She wasn&#39;t busy busy to not be helping us. She kept going back to other tables, checking how things were... Seriously multiple times! I truly felt judged because we weren&#39;t older like the other tables and we weren&#39;t in the &#34;nicest&#34; clothes as we didn&#39;t PLAN on going there. The portions are small and come out at different times. I don&#39;t eat red meat and my BF does, we asked if we could sub the type of meat and she said no. So we didn&#39;t share, I watched him eat and then he watched me eat. I feel like there should be a way to cater to both situations. And I truly wonder if this place knows that people can truly be allergic to meats... As I am. We got margaritas and they were the smallest ones I have ever seen a restaurant serve, and for $10?! They are good, but expensive!

Our server really lacked service. That&#39;s a huge hit for me. He was a guy. Hostess girls did a great job. Place was packed, YOU have to make reservations beforehand, because it&#39;s smaller. Bar had no places to sit. This was on a weekday. 

Food, I&#39;d recommend sharing - Pricey smaller portions. 
My family each ordered something and we shared one thing/taco from each.


They start off by serving a yummy bean dip with chips. Wish the bean dip was larger. Slammed it!

The chicken pollo taco were OK. Wouldn&#39;t get that one again.
Non alcoholic orange hisbuscus drink was too sweet for my liking. Wish I tried the lime soda one. 
TACOS DONT COME WITH SALSA.... Gave to buy separate. Bummer.


Must try the rice, super delicious. 2 y/o daughter loved it. I loved it. Melts in your mouth. Filled with flavor. 


They did offer key lime cake, small piece with a little candle after my mom asked. I mentioned it was my birthday but server kinda laughed in my face. Don&#39;t even think he said happy birthday.. But whatever. Was there for the food, not him

Just saying.  Our tacos were truly outstanding.  They come in a large group of four for sharing.  But I ate all mine on my own.

The service was outstanding, the waitress was very attentive and gave great recommendations for myself and my family. She knew the menu well enough to be able to list favorites, and answer questions without looking at it which I acknowledge and look for when I dine out in restaurants. I like when the staff are educated on the menu and the ingredients. She made good recommendations and was able to tell me what to expect.

The other staff were constantly filling my water and cleaning the table so no extra empty plates were there taking up space, and I always had a full glass of water- which I love. I hate staring at empty dirty dishes. 

The food was good, not outstanding but very flavorful. Loved the Steak Tacos and the Corn side dish. The Shrimp tacos were just okay, honestly nothing special like the Steak Tacos. But the corn was my favorite part of the meal, light enough but different than any I have had before all around a great combination.

a-toda-madre-glen-ellyn-2,Laurice M.,MSGt6RGOuB6VIp3pZBCOEg,jr0RqiebV-paXQckZcbOkw,"Worth the 40 min drive! I originally planned on going to  Bien Trucha in Geneva but the 1 hour drive stopped me. So glad I found out that ATM moved to Glen Ellyn! 

We came in during lunchtime. Didn&#39;t want to wait for dinner and I&#39;m not a fan of the crowds. Good thing too, since we were probably the 5th customer to come in and were seated right away.

We started off with a free botana (appetizer) of bean dip and chips. Nothing too fancy but it was free so I loved it lol! We also ordered the guacamole del dia. Both my husband and I loved it, the watermelon provided a sweet and refreshing touch to regular guac.  Could have used more chips though. 

We also ordered a variety of tacos (pescado, chilango, and barriga) and esquites. Oh my goodness. All of them were delicious! My favorite is the pescado or crispy battered tilapa with red cabbage on top. It was sweet and sour and spicy and crunchy and soft all at the same time! Couldn&#39;t get enough of it!  Loved the esquites or mexican corn salad too! Just a tad expensive for a small bowl. Nevertheless, I would have ordered 5 of those and eat them in one sitting.

As for drinks, we ordered mango juice and it was good. Reminded me of home and that&#39;s a huge compliment. :)

Overall genuine service, lovely people, and EXCELLENT food!!!",10/06/15,163,4,2,5,47,7.7238999999999995,5.298000000000001,0.368,17.334,No,1309
a-toda-madre-glen-ellyn-2,Luront U.,ka7GX5IbPJtP5O0T8Y3QoQ,huMQ8KSRjAJ7QM0atdTUag,This is hands down the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. I have been to A Toda Madre several times and I have never left disappointed. I always need to get their tacos when I go there. I think their swordfish tacos are probably my favorite. The elote appetizer will make your taste buds explode from all the amazing flavors in a single dish. The atmosphere is also great; it&#39;s very intimate and dimly lit. The staff is always very helpful and courteous. I would highly recommend making a reservation in order to ensure that you don&#39;t have an enormous wait; especially on the weekends. This place is always packed and it&#39;s packed for a very good reason!

Both times we came with our younger kids and some adults for lunch, and although this is not the best kid place, they tell you they have no high chairs or boosters... they are so nice and accommodating. The host even offered to take our sons bike downstairs so we did not have to leave it outside! 

The food is phenomenal and will please anyone in your group. We ordered some guacamole, both of the brochetas, and 3 different type of tacos. Everything was fantastic, from the food to the service, which was attentive and not overbearing.

The menu is clearly labeled and staff are knowledgable regarding cross contamination issues. When we ordered the guacamole, our server advised me not to eat the chips, as they are fried in a shared deep frier with wheat flour.

My only complaint is that there are so few gluten free appetizer options, but there are a ton of options throughout the rest of the menu, so I can&#39;t be too upset.

a-toda-madre-glen-ellyn-2,Jessica C.,eJcYIBe4eJzW7KBh7I3W6g,Y-j1diI4fcC7mOWEVBlcNg,"My husband and I were babysitting in the area and we needed take out.  We ordered the tacos pescado, a toda madre tacos, and sides of the arroz and esquites.  I went and picked it up, and agree with the other reviews that the space is very nice - a little quirky, a little sexy, great blue floor tile in the foyer and good color schemes.  

Summary of food:
Tacos Pescado:  ok, so we got take out, but the fish turned soggy.  In comparison, the fish tacos at del Seoul  in the city still manage to be amazing even 2 hours later, so I am sympathetic that we didn&#39;t have them fresh, but still...  To their credit, the slaw was in a separate container - great customer service to allow it not to ruin the tortillas.

Tacos A Toda Madre: Sadly, not the best al pastor I&#39;ve ever had - it was a bit dry and my husband got several not so edible bites.  The pineapple salsa was great, but the salsa morita was WAY too salty.  I mean, WAY too salty.  I tried to scrape some off, but I was still inhaling water the rest of the night.  They were good, but not amazing.

Arroz:  Freaking amazing rice.  I&#39;m going to try to recreate it at home.  Loved it, 5 stars, yay.

Esquites:  excellent - the epazote really comes through, giving it a unique flavor.  Again, though, EXTREMELY salty.  Really, back off the salt!  

So why 4 stars and not 3?  It&#39;s very tasty food, I&#39;d definitely eat there again (usually 3 stars is a take it or leave it).  I&#39;d also like to try it in person and give it more fair shot.  Also, I want to eat more arroz...",16/06/15,201,4,2,5,37,4.0821000000000005,3.472,1.03,15.499000000000002,No,1551

Looking for a Mexican restaurant on way home from a charity golf event down south Yelp came thru again.   Great hip modern atmosphere and the food did not disappoint.  Started with the Mexican Street corn which was excellent.  Had the filete and shrimp skewers and finished with the flan.  Be forewarned the shrimp looks fabulous but it is super spicy and hot.  I mean Satan hot. That being said I still go 5 stars.  If this place was near my house we would go a lot.  Well done Madre.,03/06/16,65,5,2,4,33,3.7573000000000003,2.687,0.0,7.313000000000001,No,515

Also, ATM takes reservations - a limited number, but it&#39;s still so much nicer than potentially waiting a couple hours.

The space feels a lot like the Geneva locations, chic and kind of airy but also a bit cramped - tables are close together and it can get pretty noisy. But there&#39;s a lot more space here, too, which is nice. 

The menu is familiar to me and meant for sharing -- so I got my companions&#39; preferences and ordered for us all. Guacamole, four kinds of tacos, the esquites and drunken bean sides. Plus drinks, of course.

The food is just so damn good. One of my friends didn&#39;t think he was a big guacamole fan, but he thought theirs was amazing. The tacos are perfect little bursts of flavor. The drinks are fresh and delicious. 

Service was solid, our waters were kept refilled and plates kept moving. They are pretty strict about no modifications to the food, though -- they wouldn&#39;t make one kind of taco without cheese for a non-dairy-eating friend. So I suggest studying the menu beforehand if you have any specific food preferences or dietary needs.

This is not a casual family dinner spot. This isn&#39;t your neighborhood Mexican restaurant that will put beans and cheese on a tortilla for your picky eater.

We ordered the taco&#39;s and we asked for the cheese to be removed. They told us that there can&#39;t be any changes to a dish whatsoever! I said &#34;so the point at which the &#34;chef&#34; tosses some plain ol cheese on the taco&#39;s....he can&#39;t skip that step?&#34;  They said, &#34;nope.&#34;

They put cheese on top of guacamole, and they couldn&#39;t &#34;NOT&#34; do it. Cheese on top of guacamole is not good. Tried it, and it wasn&#39;t good.

We ordered plain white rice for our 5 year old child (who wasn&#39;t offered a booster seat), and they brought out this overcooked soft, thick, CHEESY white rice. Our child tried it and said it was nasty. I tried it, and it was literally cheesy rice. We asked if they could make us plain white rice and they said &#34;NO&#34;.  

I felt like I was at a French restaurant.....one of those that thinks their sh*t don&#39;t stink. 
Annoying....on top of that, it was significantly overpriced:
1 cup of guacamole with cheese = $11
8 tiny taco&#39;s = $24
1 cup of corn = $5
2 child size Orange Juice = $10

The steak taco&#39;s were not that tender, and all they had was a blob of cheese with green sauce. That&#39;s it. 

Ever wonder what a Mexican Restaurant would be like in Wisconsin (the CHEESE capital of America)????  Try this place. They hide all of the true flavors with cheese, and refuse to leave it on the side or completely remove it.

I have been to far better Mexican Restaurants that take FAR better care of their customers.

The food&#39;s good and I&#39;ll get to that but here is why this place isn&#39;t for me:
* omg...it&#39;s LOUD!  Super loud.  You honestly have to shout across the table to be heard.  A certain amount of noise can really give a place energy but this was just over the top.  It would be impossible with a larger party.
* The seats are all so hard.  You&#39;re just sitting on bare wood.  

Reservations:  They say they take reservations but it seems that what they more have is a call ahead list.  Either they botched it with our party or it just doesn&#39;t work.  You have to call after 5:45 pm and just by chance I called right about then.  They said there was still seating available and to call back in 10 minutes.  ??  Being close, we decided to head over and so I called to say we&#39;d be there in 15 and to put us down.  She again told me to call back in 10.  ??  How exactly does this work??  About 5 minutes away I called again and she then told me the restaurant was full and there would be a 1/2 hour wait.  What the...  She took my number to text me when the table was about 10 minutes from being available. We got there and waited..and waited..while party after party was seating before us.  She had me repeatedly calling back when clearly there already had been a list running.  Bit annoying but if it works properly, I&#39;d say it&#39;d be a convenient system.  

The Drinks:  I had Mangoneada (non-alcoholic mango w/ice).  $4.  Pretty nice but mango needs a bit of a pop of lemon to move it into the lively and refreshing realm.  Husband had the Fresona, which he liked and then the Strawberry Daiquiri, just okay.  Both were pretty pricey at $10 for a little thing.

The Food:  This isn&#39;t your typical Mexican fare where everything is covered heavily in cheese and comes with a splat of dull refried beans and even duller rice.  Small plates...very fresh...nice.  They&#39;re meant to be shared.  We had an order of one of the grilled skirt steak tacos, the A Toda Madre tacos (pork), and the Diabla shrimp tacos.  All really good.  Add in a side of Esquites (grilled corn) and Papas (potato cubes) and we were set.  

Decor was nice:  Lots of windows.  Interesting light fixtures and succulent plantings along the walls.  Very clean and vibrant with a serious IKEA vibe.  I just couldn&#39;t handle the chairs",08/08/15,279,3,2,5,29,7.7868,5.712000000000001,0.724,30.564,No,2501
a-toda-madre-glen-ellyn-2,Bryan B.,MOPKiejtVwGYucc2apzKKg,XE9XEkG3ns9DqmJCVH9Zhw,"It&#39;s true. This is unquestionably the best Mexican food in the western suburbs of Chicago. It&#39;s got a cool, almost city-like vibe. And since it takes me about 25 minutes to drive here from my house, it&#39;s almost the same distance as it is for me to drive into the city.

Most of the dishes are served where there are 4 portions, tortillas, etc. So it&#39;s best to go with 4 people.If you go with two, you won;t get as deep into the menu. if you go with 6,  sharing becomes a chore. Trust me, go with 4.",15/09/15,76,5,1,4,-4,3.6772000000000005,2.541,0.0,7.459,No,696

My boyfriend and I came here on our anniversary after hearing &#34;rave&#34; reviews. We had high hopes for the menu, and I assumed I would have ample options as a vegetarian given this place was so hip, fresh, and sophisticated. We had late reservation on a Saturday night and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was crazy busy and loud. Decorated with the usual pretentious urban decor, The seating arrangements were cramped and uncomfortable. I was closer to my neighbor than I was to my boyfriend. 

My cocktail, some special with cucumber and lime, was delicious and I think I ordered three. We had chips and guacamole as an appetizer which was good, but nothing special. The menu is VERY limited for vegetarians. I had an order of portobello tacos which were literally garnished with NOTHING. I think there was one other vegetarian taco option but it was slathered in cheese. My boyfriend had some meat tacos, which he enjoyed. 

Our server was way overly attentive, to an annoyance. We could barely carry on a conversation without him checking in, pushing us to move on with our dinner and leave so our table could be turned over. We were in and out in less than 50 minutes, not my ideal anniversary dinner.  I won&#39;t be back anytime soon, and I definitely won&#39;t wait for a table here. Super pretentious and not worth the hype. Bien Trucha certainly isn&#39;t adding to the Glen Ellyn charm.

However, $2 for a thimble of salsa hurts. I suspect it&#39;s one of the reasons why your crowds are shrinking. People in Glen Ellyn are willing to spend money on dinner but they don&#39;t want to feel like they&#39;re getting ripped off. Of course they can afford the $2, but you gotta give &#39;em something for their money. If you&#39;re gonna charge for salsa, make it a decent sized serving of salsa. The tiny margarita&#39;s are already a ripoff, but they&#39;re so good people will put up with it. Adding a second ripoff is too much - the perception in town is that you&#39;re expensive. 

Two other notes: The music&#39;s too loud in the bar area and your server pushed us way too hard  to order quickly, despite plenty of open tables.

Went there on a Friday night and we got seated right away. The waitress was on top of things and got our order right away. 

We started off with four shots of Corzo. Still a fan of Patron but the chaser that came with the Corzo.....oh my. It was a bloody mary mix of some kind with just the right spices and heat to accompany it. We also got some chips and salsa which had a tasty chipotle flavor.

For dinner, we ordered tacos de pescado, tacos de arrachera, and tacos bien trucha along with some arroz poblano and papas con aioli (which tasted extra delicious that night). Everything was gone is 60 seconds! Ok maybe like 5 minutes but still, the four of us devoured our meal. For drinks we just had water and to end our little meal, we finished it off with another round of Corzo, just for the chaser. ;)

When we got our bill I was kind of shocked that the shots were $12 each, and that the waitress didn&#39;t tell us at the moment. We probably would have still gotten the first round but not the second one. Minus the shots, our food was only about $16 per person. Not too shabby!

Anyway, the food was great!  We had shrimp on a skewer and some tacos and corn.  The corn is the best!  We talked to them about it and they make it with mayonnaise and cilantro and some cheese and it is heavenly!

Sashimi combo of 15 pieces- very fat and generous, however my brother did taste some frozen pieces..
Veggie maki
White sox
Ocean drive
California sunset
Rainbow
Sexy lady
Crazy dragon

Udon was also quite tasty, but you can&#39;t go wrong with this dish anyways so it was a nice way to fill the hungry boys up. The salad and miso soup with the sashimi combo were also good- though the salad was drenched, the dressing was still light tasting.

Other favorites are the scary spider and the special spicy tuna rolls. Service is great and the special drinks are enjoyable as well. They also have lunch specials and non sushi food as well.

The dcor is cute, nothing too exciting except for that samurai to greet you! We sat in the booths by the bar and it had a bright blue lighting that defiantly drew you into the bar. 

We came on a weekday night so it was fairly slow and was able to get seated right away. Service was awesome, super friendly and helpful.  They have a wide variety of sushi options, I feel like you cant go wrong on any of them.

We went in last week for my sister&#39;s birthday - she wanted sushi, which I am so thankful for!  Our server was fantastic, and (almost) everything was on point. (more on that later.)

We ordered... well, we ordered A LOT.  Basically everything that did not include:
1. cream cheese (it doesn&#39;t belong in sushi, does it?
2. asparagus (my dad doesn&#39;t like it.)

So, there were probably 10 full sized rolls on the table, as well as the tuna rice appetizer, and we each got one of those bomb $4 house salads.

We also ordered some nigiri: salmon, tuna, and yellowtail for everyone, and a piece of salmon roe (ikura) for me, my fav, and what I always end my meal with.

All of the rolls were great.  Spicy where they should be, mild where they should be, and FLAVORFUL.  The nigiri was large slices of fish atop well wasabi&#39;d rice.  Everything was very well executed.

The house salad... what can I say about this that has not already been said?  First of all, for $4, its humongous.  It&#39;s topped with shredded carrot and beets, along with crispy sweet potato bits.  Add orange, grapefruit, and tomatoes, and top with that creamy decadent ginger dressing... not to mention the fact that you can EAT THE BOWL.  So good.  So so good.

The only thing that feel flat for me was the ikura.  Something just didn&#39;t taste right.  It wasn&#39;t the brine-y, salty delight it should have been.  Luckily, I had just taken a little nibble off the top before diving in, and decided I was going to pass on it.  Our server was completely understanding and removed it from the bill for us.

I brought my family here on a Sunday supplemented with a Groupon.
We were hesitant because of the proximity to where I live but with few good reviews, we relinquished our inhibition - a decision I swear I regretted.
After we order appetizer ( 4 set of special rolls ), our entree took close to an hour to arrive on our table. Worse, there were new arrivals who end up getting their entry ahead of us.
And the entree were mediocre at its best .
The kind and polite waitress ( a Filipina) apologized and admitted the kitchen is under staff. . . I then asked how they make the diners feel better in situations like these - so the waitress approached the manager but the manager didn&#39;t even apologize nor our party were given some consolation of some sort, didn&#39;t bother to come to our table.

The Special Spicy Tuna roll was nice too.

California Sunset Roll could have been a lot better if they used all real crab meat instead of mixing it with imitation crab meat (what they call &#34;half and half&#34;).

I mean, its nestled between a Dominick&#39;s (RIP) and a tanning salon a block from Harper College... I judged the book by the cover. But as soon as I walked in I was flabbergasted. This restaurant is romantic as hell. There are probably 10 tables and although it&#39;s a small restaurant, the high-backed booths make it feel incredibly private. It&#39;s a great departure from the other sushi places in the area where you feel like you have to share your chair with whoever is dining next to you. 
Everyone who works here is super nice and great at reading the tables. Like, if you&#39;re ready to strike up a conversation, they&#39;ll hang out a little. If you&#39;re on a hot date, I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t linger at the table. Ah, I hope one day I get to go on a hot date here.
The food presentation is probably the most beautiful I&#39;ve seen from any restaurant. Last time I was here I had the house salad, which is served in a crispy wonton bowl on top of a nest of shredded beets. Like it looked like a little bird&#39;s nest. A delicious little bird&#39;s nest. Say nest again. We had the dragon fire which came out with a little flame on the plate. The green turtle roll comes complete with a little wasabi turtle head. And I think the most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever seen on a plate was my sister&#39;s una-don entree, which is &#34;just&#34; eel over steamed rice. But it comes plated with all these beautiful garnishes and a candle and...sigh.
Aside from the food being beautiful, it&#39;s delicious. If you&#39;ve ever had black rice, you know it looks like cocoa crispies and tastes like heaven.

I paid and the dinner came promptly, AND with soup and salad. Whatever they did to the Miso soup, it trumped every other miso soup experience I&#39;ve previously enjoyed. It was piping hot, but had a thick-heartiness to it, without noodles. 
The fish was fresh and the slices were cleanly cut and presented. So why 4 stars? The cost to quantity of sashimi was on the high side. I was a tad hungry still, even consuming all the decor they served the fresh slices on. That isn&#39;t what I was used to, when I previously spent a few dollars less, to get quite a bit more.
I will be back- it&#39;s not a huge cost difference, and proximity will prevail, plus that miso was memorable and the fish certainly was fresh.

Because without it, my meal would have cost 50$ for just one other person and I.  It was way too pricey for what it was.  We had the Golden Dragon, Red Dragon, Dragon, and Crunchy Muffy.  

The Golden Dragon was perfection.  I was in love.  It was so tasty and flavorful.  The citrus tobiko was also a daring, excellent choice!  My definite favorite.

The Red Dragon was also amazing with a nice smokey spicy flavor I have never had on sushi before.  A great thing to try!  I loved it.

The Crunchy Muffy I was not impressed with.  The cream cheese overpowered everything else in the roll.  I have sushi for the fish and combined flavor not a glob of cream cheese.  It was so strong I could barely finish the one bite.  

The dragon is something so typical and one of my favorites anywhere.  But here, I was so let down.  It was drenched in soy sauce to the EXTREME.  I couldn&#39;t taste anything but soy sauce.  I love soy sauce on sushi but this was too much.

Sushi-Ai needs to realize that sometimes a gentler taste is usually something to be desired in sushi.  Not too much of extra stuff.

Inside, the place looked absolutely amazing. The place was semi-full, which is impressive for a suburban restaurant on a weeknight. They had little intimate booths and the standard tables. The two of us ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the Red Dragon roll, OceanWave roll, Green Frog Roll, and the Sexy Lady Roll. The food turned out awesome. The Green Frog Roll was shaped to look like a frog with a giant dab of wasabi for the head. It was great food!

BATHROOM REVIEW: For what great detail and thought to their food and decor, the bathrooms looked like was an afterthought. The bathrooms are located near the end of the restaurant, with curtains half-drawn to the bathroom room area. Inside the bathroom area, there two doors, men and women. Upon opening the door, you&#39;ll realize that this is a single-stall bathroom and it was super-small. One had to fully open door completely to enter as the stall was right at the door and would block your way. Inside, the bathroom was smelly and it was a toilet. It was one of the toilets with a small handle. So when I was done peeing, I couldn&#39;t do my customary kicking down of the toilet handle to flush. There were also poop splatters on the side of the toilet. SIT or SQUAT? SQUAT!

If you like paying more for the presentation than the quality, then the Groupon is the way to go! Don&#39;t get me wrong, I was very impressed by the presentation and attention to detail. I was let down by the quality/quantity. 

I had made a reservation as the Groupon suggested for a Friday night. We walked in right on time and had to wait to be seated. No big, we were still seated ahead of the line. It&#39;s cute and slightly modern, as I said - very detail oriented.

I started with miso soup and my friend had this cucumber/mint/ginger salad that was unique. It was fresh and zesty, I loved it. The miso soup was nothing to brag about, again the presentation was the best part. They serve the spoon on top filled with fried green onions. We had tried a few rolls that seemed out of our norm, but to be honest, they all kind of tasted the same. Shrimp with cucumber and tempura fluff, a little bland. The two rolls that stuck out the most to me were the Green Turtle (they made a little head out the blob of wasabi) and the Smoky-something or other with smoked salmon. The presentation was beautifully put together. 

The server was somewhat knowledgeable, but very polite and attentive.

We passed on dessert as everything seemed to settle a bit too quickly with me and I had to run. I think the only way I&#39;d come back is with another Groupon deal.",27/05/14,150,3,2,5,31,4.3518,2.451,0.258,16.290999999999997,No,1419

My husband and I got dinner from this place on a quiet weekday evening and the food blew us away. We got the pico de gallo roll which was spicy tuna topped with fresh pico de gallo- didn&#39;t think you could get 5 stars for that kind of a combination but it was sooo so good. And the fried rice was done so well- the vegetables were chopped to perfection, then stir fried. All in all, our experience went really well. A little too good to be true because I got a minor heart attack when I saw what they had charged us for a 2 entrees- $65!!! This is after buying their groupon bringing us to a whooping $86 for one roll and one order of fried rice. When I called to question the charges, the owner found that we had been wrongfully charged. I guess the server waited until the next day to charge us and he charged us for a &#39;to-go&#39; order that was worth $65 dollars. The owner literally just said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t do much besides giving you a discount the next time you&#39;re in&#34;. WE WERE CHARGED $60 IN ERROR  and the owner did NOTHING about it. In fact, the next day, I called with more proof from my bank and groupon and he refused to speak with me!!! And guess what?!

I stuck with some &#34;basics&#34;, but let&#39;s use that phrase very loosely!  Nothing here is &#34;basic&#34;, and everything is amazing.  I am just saying that I wasn&#39;t feeling TOO adventurous at the time.  Next time, I know what to branch out to (but how am I ever going to veer from what I already know, love, and dream about at night?!).  Ahhh, first world problems.

Let me break it down:
**Mai Tai--served in a martini glass, and it is stroooooong.  It was the first thing I had when I got there, and it had me buzzing through the meal.  

Luckily, I sopped it up with:

**Stuffed Mushrooms--these are not your ordinary stuffed mushrooms, FO SHO.  They are stuffed with crab and deep fried.  They don&#39;t leave you with that horribly heavy feeling, either.  They come in a generous portion of four, and they&#39;re well worth the $$.  
 
**Veggie Fried Rice: By far some of the best fried rice I have ever had.  It&#39;s less expensive than the other fried rice selections, and my two other dining companions and I devoured it til we were full and still had some left.

&#34;Side&#34; salad--Don&#39;t let the *side* fool you, it&#39;s crap.  It is a meal in itself for the meager sum of $4.  Plus, it comes with this ginger dressing that I would bathe in given the chance.  Unfortunately this was a family place, and I couldn&#39;t do what I wanted to this sassy little dressing.

**California Roll--now, I didn&#39;t want to get crazy with my branching out, so I stuck with this for my &#34;meal&#34;.  Because I hadn&#39;t had enough already?!?! LOL  
But it was flavorful and delicious!  It was only $7.  Sushi can be expensive, but this was a roll that I could roll with (insert eye roll).

My mom is a restaurant.com fan, so my family decided to come here and I am glad that we did. 

I ordered, unagi maki with avocado. I was totally expecting the 6 micro pieces that are about an inch high, half an inch in diameter. I wasn&#39;t expecting a beautiful caterpillar presentation. Then I thought... CRAP this roll is going to be 15 bucks now, but NOPE, 6 dollars. and it was so ridiculously fresh and tasted fantastic. Their edamame was salted a bit too much, but cooked well. I also ordered the scallop main entree dish. They tasted kind of rubbery and were very salty. The unagi still did it for me though. My parents got the sea bass entree and that was well done. My brother got the tempura udon and no complaints from him.

I really liked them all. The point of my experience that made my rating plummet was the service. It was terrible. Keep in mind I have been working at a busy sushi restaurant for 7 months now so I know what it is like and I know at my restaurant the service would NEVER be this bad. One of the servers sat us and she took away the drink menu. The host had to come over and give me one. I was waiting for my friend who arrived a couple minutes after I was seated. It being my first time there, I wanted to ask some questions about the most popular rolls and their sauces but the waitress left us sitting there for ten minutes without even taking our drink orders (it wasn&#39;t even busy). I don&#39;t mind waiting but when she finally came over, the two drinks I wanted were not available! They can simply cross them off the menus if they no longer keep it in stock. There was one other waitress working and all three of her tables that came in AFTER us got their food before we did since they didn&#39;t have to wait to place their orders. We finally got our food and it was delicious. She didn&#39;t clear the table after we finished and because we were in a hurry now from all the time in between being seated, ordering drinks, ordering our food and now ordering dessert; I wanted to get dessert and then leave. I had to stop the friendly host and ask for dessert menus. Again, when my friend was finished with her dessert, the waitress didn&#39;t clear the dishes, the host did. We had to ask for the bill, wait for it, immediately be ready to pay, and wait for the server again. I had a groupon for $40 so the $65 bill would be $25. My friend didn&#39;t even want to tip her because of her terribly slow service but because I know what it is like to live on tips, I decided 5 bucks would match her poor performance. Now, the waitress leaned in and COUNTED THE MONEY IN FRONT OF US. When she saw that we tipped her 5 dollars she pestered us saying that the tip should be 10% of the original bill not the &#34;discounted&#34; price. &#34;You are getting over 50% discount and you&#39;re only tipping 5 dollars. It should $6.50 from the original total&#34; she said that as if I got a groupon for free..? You might be thinking I am cheap but there are plenty of people who wouldn&#39;t have tipped her at all. How much I tip is an indicator of the server&#39;s performance. At the last sushi place I went to, I left a $13 dollar tip for food worth $25 because the service was excellent. At this point I had no time to argue with her so I was FORCED to leave her a $7 dollar tip that she and her attitude quite frankly did not deserve. Sushi Ai, your food is great but you do NOT force your customers to tip you more than they feel like especially after such bad service.",30/07/15,305,1,1,2,2,1.8425999999999998,2.58,1.859,23.562,No,2915

The waiter was a huge turn off due to his smarmy attitude. Ordered one of the cool-sounding ice teas for $5 and sadly it turned out to be a bottle of Republic of Tea. We ordered several rolls and a half-entree, none of which came with miso, so I ordered it separately. The miso portion was tiny and arrived at the table room-temperature, blegh. The tofu in my entree was on the verge of being spoiled. The deluxe veggie roll was rather bland.

However, I love that you can get black rice in your rolls, and that they use apple for a garnish. May give this place another chance if we&#39;re in the area.",08/06/12,81,2,1,1,1,0.24409999999999998,0.7130000000000001,0.391,7.896000000000001,No,671

sushi-ai-palatine,Vanessa B.,Pm2S36ViSuXO-1AFd3OlDg,MejRjfijjnFS2cgClIjOEw,"When you just compare Sushi-Ai to all the other crappy sushi joints around here, it starts looking better and better.  I actually started writing this review with four stars, but remembered that they are consistently in the 80s on their health inspection scores and that is slightly disconcerting, especially for a sushi place.  The restaurant is ALWAYS clean, and they actually just did a little remodeling to make it a little more up to date. But, obviously I&#39;ve never seen the kitchen so can&#39;t say why they can&#39;t get better inspection scores.

Anyway, despite their mediocre scores, I do enjoy their sushi.  I pretty much always get the Totoro Kani roll (king crab on the inside, spicy tuna on the outside) and the Millennium Maki (shrimp tempura, asparagus, etc. on the inside and eel on the outside). If I could make one suggestion to them it would be to make more lighter rolls - they don&#39;t always need tempura or mayonnaise.  They have been doing specials lately and they are usually on the lighter side and really refreshing. Keep it up!  They used to always be out of toro and uni, but seem to be keeping that more in stock too so I&#39;ve been really happy with that.

Is this the best sushi you will ever have? No. But if you are having a sushi craving meltdown, which my husband can tell you all about, this will definitely satisfy your taste buds and leave you pretty happy.",22/03/12,152,3,1,4,0,3.2615000000000007,1.6709999999999996,1.331,10.998000000000001,No,1403

Unless you&#39;re with a large group of people, I recommend asking the hostess to seat you in the back towards the Sushi bar. There, it&#39;s less distracting and tolerable. Besides, you&#39;ll need the TV to help occupy your time. The service is SLOW!

The layout is contemporary and small. Unique woodwork dress the walls. The wine racks are in the middle of the room to entice you. The room is overcrowded with tables that are situated too close for comfort, leaving you with not a lot of room to scoot your seat back. For this reason, I prefer to sit in a booth. 

Tonight, we shared our plates, making it a well balanced Japanese surf and turf. To be sure Jason didn&#39;t leave hungry, he also had the $5 shumai (steamed shrimp dumplings) appetizer. Served with a spicy dipping sauce.

I ordered the grilled NY Strip medium rare, dressed with sweet soy sauce. For $18, it&#39;s served with sauted vegetables and mashed potatoes. I would describe it as a grilled potato patty that tastes like the top part of a twice baked potato.

Jason ordered the U15 Golf Shrimp. For $19, it&#39;s served with seven-spice garlic butter with sauted vegetable.I&#39;m not sure what the U15 represents but the dish is awesome!






Both orders included miso soup and house salad.

We have been loyal Sushi-Ai customers for several years, but the last time we went was a huge disappointment.
First of all, we ordered oysters on the half shell, which have always been one of our favorites as they are spicy and delicious. We ordered 4 and the waitress brought 2....in shot glasses....she then informed us that they no longer serve oysters on the half shell as people complained about shell pieces in the dish. If you can&#39;t properly shuck and oyster, then perhaps you shouldn&#39;t serve them?

Next we ordered 3 rolls, including the spicy tataki (again, one of our favorites). Unfortunately, the flavor was off...it didn&#39;t taste right at all. The other two rolls were very good, but completely fell apart when we tried to pick them up with chopsticks!! Isn&#39;t that kind of sushi 101? Making sure the rolls are rolled tightly?? It was a mess to eat. 
We also ordered a plate of sashimi and nigiri and it was very hit or miss. The salmon belly and super white tuna were excellent, but my slice of snapper was tough and chewy. In addition, we had ordered the sweet shrimp and the fried shrimp heads (which are my favorite part!) were not fried enough! They were chewy and inedible! 

To add insult to the injury of our evening, a couple arrived as we were eating and they apparently knew the sushi chef. They were extremely loud and obnoxious. The sushi chef sent over a HUGE plate of food for them...for FREE!!! Now I realize that chefs can comp food to whomever they choose, but what bothered me was the way it was handled. The couple were literally shouting across the dining room thanking the chef and making it obvious to everyone that their dinner was basically free!! Even the waitress looked embarrassed at the display. Of course at this time our huge bill arrived....yes, prices have definitely gone up at Sushi-Ai and being made to feel like we were subsidizing someone else&#39;s meal certainly did not help matters! 
Our server was good but I just can&#39;t ignore the flaws in quality and presentation of the food...especially for the price we paid. I really hope they get their act together again, but in the meantime, we are searching for a new go to sushi place.",03/07/15,270,3,1,2,-62,1.2416999999999998,2.5090000000000003,2.4949999999999997,19.994999999999997,No,2370

My nieces like sushi and rolls so this is our meal we do together which is fun.  They always want to go to sushi station which isn&#39;t my top pick so I got a groupon so we decided to try this out.  We were seated promptly and ordered edamame, shrimp shumai, miso soup and 3 salads which were all good but the salad was outstanding and loved the dressing. For dinner we had a chicken teriyaki dish for the 6 year old which came with some amazing stir fried vegetables. We ordered the smokey bear roll, shrimp tempura toll and California roll which were beautifully displayed.  My favorite roll was the smokey bear which is smoked salmon.

I had the mango sunrise which was delicious and I hope they ad it to their menu permanently. The ocean drive is one of my favorites, white and red tuna with green peppers, lime juice and wrapped in rice paper. They have great martinis and a pretty good wine selection. I always start off with the house salad, it comes in a wonton bowl with ginger miso dressing and shaved sweet potato crisps for $4. You also have the option of getting the rolls in long or short which allows you to try a few different ones.

It is a little bit pricier compared to other sushi places but it tastes better and fresher so it&#39;s worth it.  The atmosphere is modern and the food presentation is the best.  

The only complaint I have is the blonde female waitress.  We don&#39;t get her much but when we do it&#39;s...well, let&#39;s just say that I walk out with a sour taste in my mouth.  I just don&#39;t like her.  She seems very desperate to prove to us that she&#39;s too cool for her job.  The other waiters are attentive, friendly, and engaging.  Perhaps it&#39;s because she seems to be one of the few female waitresses...maybe she has &#34;princess syndrome&#34; (can you say delusional?).  Anyway, I would just like my food and drink...please check your attitude at the door and don&#39;t bring it to my table.

Despite the fact their &#34;sister&#34; restaurant, Blufish, is a mere five minute drive from my house, it really was worth driving an extra 20 minutes to Sushi-Ai.  We were warmly greeted and immediately seated! Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  I was happy to learn that, yes, they HAD O-Toro that evening.  Many other restaurants list it on their menu, but many times it&#39;s unavailable.  

Here, the O-Toro was fresh, tender, and delicious.  Our waiter suggested one of the evening&#39;s special appetizers...an oyster appetizer with ponzu and wasabi.  It was EXCELLENT!  We also shared some chicken kushi yaki and agadashi tofu. Mrs. ordered a sushi platter and was pleased with the variety and freshness of the tuna and salmon. I ordered the Sunset Drive Roll and the Special Spicy Tuna Roll...both were EXCELLENT!  

What really stands out here, and at Blufish, is the presentation of the dishes.  The chefs really make the plates beautiful with the unique way they carve an apple and fan it out on the plate.  And each plate is also adorned with a small candle.  It&#39;s really cool that the chefs take the time to not only make the food delicious, but present it so beautifully as well. It shows they are sticklers for quality and aesthetic. I wish I had taken pictures of the plates.  Check out the other photos on the review page...you&#39;ll see what I mean!

The woman who I presume was the manager of the restaurant, stopped by our table on several occasions to chat and check on how we were enjoying our meal.  She was very nice and was happy to know we&#39;ve dined at Blufish and even happier to know we drove the extra distance to visit Sushi-Ai!

No matter where you are in the Chicago area, or even if you&#39;re from out of town, if you are craving sushi, then Sushi-Ai is a definite must try.

sushi-ai-palatine,Giuseppe D.,xq_feR5bCdl0CtMDofuWQg,HLrBDm245YjVOcyXD6NDEA,"Stumbled upon this place yesterday when, after a few hours of shopping at Woodfield Mall, I had a craving for sushi.

It&#39;s only about 5-10 minutes from Woodfield, so should you get that desire for sushi after shopping, the drive is very reasonable.

As another reviewer previously stated, the place looks closed when you drive into the lot. I had almost left until I decided to walk up and check anyways; luckily it was open.

The service was very good right from the start. Two women welcomed me and my friend and we were seated immediately. They gave suggestions and answered every question/request we had very timely and accurately (YES!).

For an appetizer we had the asparagus beef roll. It came with about 8-10 pieces, each piece being a cut of asparagus wrapped in tender beef and dressed with a teriyaki (I believe?) sauce. It was freshly made, warm, and tasted delicious. You can&#39;t go wrong with the asparagus + beef combination.

They have a full page with the traditional maki rolls, and TWO PAGES full of signature rolls! I was loving the variety to choose from. Each roll can be ordered &#34;short&#34;, which is 5 pieces, or &#34;long&#34; which is 10 pieces.

We ordered multiple rolls: crunchy muffy, dragon fest, golden dragon, dirty old man, and the shrimp tempura.

Unfortunately I&#39;m unable to find an online menu to give you full descriptions of each roll, nor can I recall the exact contents of each, but I CAN promise you that every roll was amazing. The ingredients were all fresh and the individual rolls were generously sized. The presentation was nice, as you would expect with any respectable sushi restaurant. They had freshly sliced apple, ginger, and wasabi with every plate. Very nicely put together overall.

I also ordered a bottle of hot sake which I polished off myself (go me!) that was delicious.

The prices were very reasonable, for an appetizer, five rolls, and a bottle of sake, the bill was under $60!

With the great food, splendid service, variety menu, and very reasonable prices, I will most likely be returning here soon (and I promise to note descriptions!).",09/10/11,252,4,2,5,17,7.108700000000002,4.378,0.287,21.336000000000002,No,2118

The restaurant is unfortunate to be in a strip mall and to have an empty adjacent space that appears to be under the Sushi-Ai sign.   You can&#39;t see the restaurant door well until you walk right up to it. 

This place rocks, though!  I am a big sushi fan and this small place has one of the most diverse menus with some of the cleverest maki combinations that I&#39;ve ever seen.  Try the Ocean Drive Roll it is superb.  They also stand out because of their amazing and complex plating style.  If you order the Flight of Tuna appetizer, you kind of expect a bunch of tuna layered on a plate with a lump of wasabbi next to it.  Right?  Wrong.  These 6 pieces of Sashimi were plated on a boat of ice (that&#39;s ice not rice), filled with red beet &#34;noodles&#34;, a complex cucumber statue, and an origami bird made out of carrot.  I guess they only have 2 of these ice boats per day so we were lucky to get it, but all their plates are like a work of art.

Sushi Ai is some of the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had. This is coming from a seasoned sushi eater who has eaten at some of the best sushi joints in LA, Vegas, Chicago and New York. Is it a bit pricey? Sure, but sushi tends to be a bit on the pricier side, so deal with it. 

Not only is the service spectacular (even though I&#39;m an out of towner, they treat me and my family like, well, family) but the creativity and presentation displayed through the food is out of this world. I positively crave this sushi every time I head back to my folks&#39; house! Some of my favorite rolls...and these are just a few...

Ocean Drive: Tuna, cilantro, jalapeno, rice paper that makes for a delicious fresh combo that I salivate for. Super, super fresh. 

Crispy Spicy Tuna OR Salmon: Oh deliciousness. Spicy chopped up tuna or salmon atop a grilled, square patty of rice with some delightfully tasty sauce. I&#39;m not even a salmon fan and I adored the spicy salmon. 

Special Spicy Tuna: Asparagus, tuna, rice paper and some delectable spicy mayo combo lightly drizzled on top. It&#39;s a warm roll but I plow through it every time. 

Tornado Sunrise: Spicy lobster rolled with black and white rice. Oh momma is that spicy.

Place was empty.
Place was clean and I like the simple decorations.
I like the black board where the different available items customers can order are listed.
The location of the restaurant could be better.
I&#39;m sure other people will find it but it is hidden.
Plenty of parking space.
My wife ordered Kare-kare.  My Mom ordered Kaldereta.  I ordered TapSiLog.
We also ordered Lechon Kawali.
For starters, our waitress, started us out with hot soup (Nilaga).  It was a pleasant surprise!  We all liked that.
The Lechon Kawali tasted very good and was cooked properly.  However, it was a bit too salty.  A little less salt would be good.
I didn&#39;t try the Kare-kare and the Kaldereta but according to both my wife and Mom, it tasted very good.
My TapSiLog was also very good.  The Tapa (strips of beef) were tender.  Not over cooked.  The garlic rice tasted very good too.  No complaints there.
We all liked they provided us with enough rice that you don&#39;t have to order for seconds!
After our meal, we ordered our Halo-halo.  It was prepared by a non-Filipino and it was good.
My wife thought having different kinds of cereal ingredients was weird.  I was open minded about it.  It&#39;s fine and the Halo-halo was delicious.
My wife thought it&#39;s probably the Ube ice cream.
Please be aware when ordering in, it may take some time.  I believe it&#39;s because the items are cooked/prepared when ordered.  I didn&#39;t see any heating lamps around so that&#39;s a very good sign.
Their staff were attentive and courteous.  Always a plus!
We&#39;ve ordered food here for our parties before too and it&#39;s always a hit!
If you haven&#39;t tried their food, what are you waiting for?!
I&#39;ll be back to try their BangSiLog, ToSiLog, LongSiLog, etc. with our kids.
We&#39;ll go here instead of all the way to Chicago for Filipino food!

Arrived there at pickup time to get order-The grandma or mom that was cooking in the back showed me a tray of burnt lumpkias and just shrugged her shoulders and said &#39;we didn&#39;t hear the timer&#39; and then put her hands in the tray to start breaking them apart to tell me they are still ok on the inside. I asked how long to remake them and they said they can&#39;t. The guy that worked there offered to sell me the tray of burnt egg rolls at 1/2 price...really-he should have paid me to take that burnt mess out of his restaurant. 

The pancit was also not ready to pick up so I had to wait 30+ minutes for that...it was not good. I would have been better off walking out and hitting the nearest White Castle to feed the super bowl crowd I was expecting (and I HATE White Castle food...bleck). It probably wasn&#39;t ready because they didn&#39;t want to be bothered to make it as they were hosting a baby shower and already had their hands full.

My first, last and only experience with this place is that service and quality are UNRELIABLE. It is a Mom &amp; Pop kind of place, but maybe they should hire some people to help them out.

My family happened upon Cuisine de Manila because our neighbors always bring us pancit palabok when we invite them over for parties, and I loved the palabok.  This weekend, my parents decided to order from there.  We had a tray of lechon de kawali and pancit palabok, and I loved it.  The lechon was hot and crispy and the palabok was very flavorful.

We placed the order on Saturday night and specified pick-up on Sunday morning at 11:30am.  The order wasn&#39;t ready right at 11:30am because they were still cutting up on the lechon, but there wasn&#39;t a long wait as others have experienced.  If we order from them again and have questionable service, I&#39;ll update the review.  One thing I can&#39;t stand is when restaurants are unapologetic about being disorganized or not having good service, so hopefully the negative reviews just came up at a bad time for them.  At this point, I&#39;d recommend.

**UPDATE**
We&#39;ve ordered from here several times before, without a problem. My favorites are still the palabok, lechon, and sisig. Here&#39;s a tip: If you&#39;re placing a large order for a party, order at least one night in advance, even if it&#39;s just 1-2 items.

I would even say it&#39;s better than most Filipino restaurants, but it doesn&#39;t compare to my own mother&#39;s cooking---especially since the service is rather poor. I&#39;ve only called a few times and they&#39;ve refused to make an order simply because they don&#39;t feel like it. My mother made an order the other day for Christmas Eve, and when she wanted to add another dish to the order (2 days prior), they refused since they were too busy. That&#39;s understandable. A few hours later, my aunt called to order the dish my mother couldn&#39;t, and they decided they weren&#39;t busy and could have the dish ready by Christmas Eve. Also, when an order does happen and we are able to pick up an actual order, the pick up time is never accurate. I&#39;ve personally waited 30-45 minutes after they told me to be there for an order to be ready. My father waited for an hour and a half with other disgruntled customers yesterday!

On our first visit to Niche, it was for a late dinner around 9pm.  There were many tables open and we were seated right away.  The dcor was upscale and classy, lots of wood and leather.

Waiter: Hello! Have you guys been here before?  I think I remember seeing you here.

I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a strategy he uses, and that if when correct is rewarding, or if we have a doppelganger out there.  In any case, our waiter was very good at this job!  He was warm and welcoming.  He made all the dishes on the menu (and the specials off the menu) sound amazing.  He even tried to upsell me on my drink when I went with plain old water.  &#34;Are you sure you don&#39;t want a diet Coke? Don&#39;t drink soda? We also have iced tea.&#34;  All I could think about was why he suggested DIET!?!?

The food was fabulous!  Each dish didn&#39;t just look beautiful, but tasted as good as it looks.

Pork Belly Fried rice $8 - My favorite dish here.  Get the share portion because you cannot have too much of this delicious tasty dish.
Niche Burger $12.50 - Great burger, comes with bacon, lettuce, tomato, white cheddar and a side of crispy fries.
Lo Mein $12 - Noodles were perfectly cooked with great flavors.
Soft Shell Crab $19 - Pricey but yummy.
Steamed Buns $13.50 - Fluffy and succulent.  These came with flank steak, red cabbage kimchi, scallions and sauce.

Before we parted ways, the waiter told us to come back to check out half price draft on Wednesdays and that they&#39;ll soon have Zombie Dust on tap.  Oh, he&#39;s good!

I met a colleague for dinner on a Thursday night. 

One of the highlights of the night was service. It was simply perfect. Our waiter cared, was observant without overwhelming us and really made our experience perfect. 

I started the night with one of their &#34;unbelievable selections&#34; of bourbon. I had a &#34;tasting pour&#34; of the Jefferson 21 year old. It was wonderful. A tasting-pour is 1 _ ounces, while a full pour is 2 ounces. It was really good. 

My colleague had a glass of Cabernet. It tasted a bit off, almost jammy and we almost thought that was the way it should taste. The waiter noticed that I also tasted it and came over to ask about it. 

He insisted that he take it back, they opened a fresh bottle and it was a really good cab. I ended up having one with my dinner.  

For appetizers, we split the Scallops and the Seared Scallops with buffalo fried oysters, and the Steamed Buns with sweet and sticky flank steak. 

They were both fantastic. The buns were really fantastic, great texture, soft and just the right chew, while the stuffing was really GREAT flavor, just enough kick.  They were served in a taco shape (check the photos) and were great. 

The Scallops were really good as well. They were served with some crispy rice which was an interesting texture. Really enjoyed that dish.

For dinner with actually split the Cornish Hen Roulade.  We wanted to stay with a small-plate theme so we could try different dishes. They actually brought us 2 plates, each with our portion beautifully arranged. You wouldn&#39;t have known we were splitting a dish. How awesome was that. And it was fantastic. The flavor in every part of that dish was really great. 

For dessert we tried the BlueBerry Fritters and the Pineapple Crisp.  They were also a hit.

Did I say that I love venison and Niche not only has a kick-ass venison app but their venison tenderloin was delicious. 

I&#39;ll break it down. The app was the meatballs and it came in a little skillet with a puree that was delicious but with this pomegranate syrup that didn&#39;t seem like it was glorified POM juice and the little pomegranate seeds helped round out the flavor.

Steam buns. STEAM BUNS?! Yeah, and honestly? They were great. I&#39;m a little wary of fusion type buns-some of them are just super overloaded but this one was stuffed just right with steak and veggies.

For dinner I of course, got the venison-if you hadn&#39;t picked up on that already. Cut to the perfect thickness, with the kale, onion  and the jus. The naturally lean venison was balanced by the buttered kale and the rich jus.

It was always on my list of places to go, but after a number of years, never went.  Finally pulled the trigger, and boy am I glad I did!  One of the best restaurants in the suburbs.  First thing to strike me as amazing, is their beer and wine selection.  You will not find a better beer selection at a restaurant.  There were so many high end premium craft beers (think Sam Adams Utopias, Deschuetes The Abyss kind of stuff), that I felt like a kid in a candy store again.  They won&#39;t come cheap, but then again, you can&#39;t get them anywhere else either.

My wife and I shared the meat and cheese plate to start, which was top of the line.  Very large and probably could have fed four if needed.  Next, we had the Duck special of the night.  Duck was cooked perfectly.  We finished off with their dessert trio of the night, consisting of the Shot &amp; a Beer cake, Creme Brulee and Caramelized Bananas (ala Foster).  The entire meal was amazing!  To cap it off, the service was impeccable!  Not overbearing, not inattentive.  Our waiter had a ton of suggestions, some that we followed and some that we passed on.  He was great though, and we really appreciated his service!

 It is a high end, classy, restaurant and the main seating area has limited hours (5:30p to 9p).  Bar stays open until midnight though with a limited menu, so if you are in the area late night, feel free to stop in.  This place is perfect for a special date night, birthday or anniversary celebration.  Make sure you make reservations though, especially on the weekends.

SOLD. 

This place in NICE. Cleanly decorated and laid out, with splashes of color and very elegant, yet they achieve a semi-casual feel which is my favorite. 

For drinks; my boyfriend got the Gumball Head ( a three floyds beer we rarely find on draft because places are always out) I ordered a drink with Vodka, Elderflower Liqour, Honey and Guajillo pepper oil. It was delicious. (I had two, which wasn&#39;t cheap, but Oh Well! : P)

The waiter was nice enough but throughout the meal he was barley present.Just thought I&#39;d mention that. It took us a while to get everything and not that they weren&#39;t busy, but he rarely checked back. He also called me a hipster for taking pictures haha. The service was the reason for me not giving this place 5 stars! 

Okay- service will not deter me from returning because the food is great. As usual we split some appetizers; Niche Burger, Steamed Mussels and Chorizo, pepper, queso fresco flat bread. Everything was wonderful. And, this way we kept the price down. I would recommend all three. 

Unsure if I was still hungry, I looked at the dessert menu, when I saw them, my favorite dessert despite not being a HUGE dessert person, Cream Puffs.  Cream Puffs- with  Strawberry mouse, white chocolate granache, strussel, macerated strawberries and BASIL. OMG these were amazing let me tell you.

First...the hostess was just lovely. My boyfriend went to park the car and I chatted with her for about 5 minutes --she was bubbly, sweet and genuinely seemed happy with her job. This is hard to find!

When I arrived, my first thought was that the decor had completely changed since I had last been there...and in my opinion, not for the better. It looks like they changed it to open up additional seating, but I think in doing so, they lost the coziness and the intimacy of the place. Open room, hard lines everywhere and very minimal. Since I had been there before, I complained to my boyfriend about the change, but he seemed to be OK with it. We both agreed that it was hard to hear one another (we were seated in the middle of the restaurant despite a reservation and openings along either wall), mostly due to the loud music.

They have a few gluten free menu items and were also able to modify those dishes to accommodate a dairy intolerance. I wanted the scallops and foie gras, and since I was looking for an entree, they modified the small plate to include three large scallops,  one piece of foie gras on top of potatoes and onions. While I appreciate the modification, I have a couple of gripes. When the entree was brought out, I was not told what the scallops and foie gras were plated with (since it wasn&#39;t on the menu, I didn&#39;t know what it would come with), and the scallops were nearly cold. The foie gras was decent, but not as flavorful as I&#39;m used to.

Our waiter (his name escapes me), was great. He knew the menu, did not seem at all put-out to accommodate our allergies (nor our questions), was attentive, well-spoken and always had a smile on his face.

Perhaps my review is a bit nit-picky, but it stems from my previous experiences here, and unfortunately this most recent visit was not up to par with my past visits. I don&#39;t like the new layout/decoration (the lack of intimacy), I don&#39;t like that we couldn&#39;t converse easily due to the noise and I don&#39;t like that my food was cold. My boyfriend also commented on the food portions (he had the pork shoulder) --quite small.

Oh, one more thing: their beer menu is ridiculously good, if you&#39;re into that.

Our server Jeffrey was wonderfully attentive to all of our questions and dealt well with our boisterous group.  

We started with the meat and cheese platter which probably was not enough for 8- but everything on it was very good. A few of us had the soup- a wonderful butternut squash- and salad.  

After that it was a VERY long wait for our entrees.  I would have rated this 5 stars if it were not for the generally slow service.  With that said, everyone enjoyed their entrees.  Special mention goes to the brussels sprouts (which even my non-veggie-eating husband enjoyed) and the venison.  

Dessert started with wonderful columns of cotton candy.  This was a definitely a crowd pleaser.  We ordered a small dessert sampler as well which they adorned with candles for the birthday- much appreciated!  And they gave us bags of cotton candy to take home!

We had 7:30 reservations and they did run out of one entree and one dessert.  On a Saturday night it may be a better idea to dine earlier.   Also note that their bar is not very large.  We had planned to have drinks there before dinner, but decide to go elsewhere since there was not room for our group.

The restaurant was noisy so it was difficult to hear conversation from the other end of the long table they put us at.  It would be great if they had rounds for big groups!

Overall, we would dine there again and probably ask for Jeffrey!",09/02/15,167,4,1,5,9,6.136800000000001,3.5630000000000006,0.175,17.261999999999997,No,1626

The ambiance and professionalism of the staff was great. The gnocchi appetizer was great and the drink and wine selection was respectable. However, the new choices on the menu were an overall disappointment. 
The ahi tuna was overlooked and had a poor texture and the cavatelli was awful. The description of smoky flavor is better described as pork and beams sauce  over noddles. 
Recommendation. I am fortunate to travel the world and experience a range of fine cuisine. I love restaurants that take risks and challenges patrons pallets. However, I recommend toning it down a bit, you&#39;re trying to be too much.

We got there early and were able to be seated right away which was wonderful.  The restaurant is very pretty and very romantic.  There were a few times while we were there I noticed the music was a little different from the romantic feel, it was more to their bar feel which actually was nice.  It didnt feel stuffy or snooty it felt younger.  
Our waiter was Jeffrey and he was out of this world with his knowledge and attentiveness.  I was torn several times, and he was able to give me perfect descriptions of each dish I asked about so I could made my decision.  
We started off with the pretzel twist appetizer.  They came out hot and fresh, actually so hot they were hard to handle for a second!  They have a side of chive butter topped with sea salt and a side of caramelized onion bacon jam.  The chive butter was outstanding.  The jam was pretty sweet and not quite my taste but it did have a very good flavor to it.  
My husband chose the lamb shank and I finally ended up choosing the Amish chicken.  Both were very good.  My only &#34;complaint&#34; was I prefer less meat more veggies and my plate was almost all chicken.  Mine came with green onions, pickled corn, and roasted quinoa that I really enjoyed.  The chicken was done perfectly and had a very good smokey flavoring to it.
My husbands lamb was also very good.  It was served with small potatoes and asparagus.  His main complaint was, like mine, the lacking veggie sides.  His came with 5 asparagus spears.  
All in all the presentation was beautiful, Jeffrey is fantastic, the food was good and we will go back.",28/06/15,180,4,2,5,44,8.0089,4.281,0.32599999999999996,17.394000000000005,No,1695

This is the best beer bar that isn&#39;t in the City.  The bottle and tap list is an ever changing lineup of rare and hard to find beers and Vinny (the restaurant/bar manager) is a sommelier by training, but is a beer geek at heart.  The recently remodeled restaurant now features about 10 taps, all of which have beers that could easily anchor a beer release party at any other bar. Their beer selection ranges from your typical Pales and Lagers to Barrel Aged Stouts, IPAs, Sours, and a full lineup of Pipeworks and Three Floyds beers.  It&#39;s not uncommon to stumble on a beer that people skip work and wait in line for at Niche.

Also, every Wednesday Niche hosts a beer bottleshare where you can bring your own bottle or two of craft beer to share with the group.  There is usually 5-10 people there that all know their stuff when it comes to beer and are more than happy to share both beer and good conversation.  If you don&#39;t have anything crazy or rare to share, don&#39;t worry, because most of their Bombers (22oz bottles)and taps are half off on Wednesdays.

My girlfriend had the half boneless duck. It was delicious, juicy and full of flavor with layered sweet potatoes and goat cheese. 
I had grilled Barramundi. It was delicious. Flaky, flavorful and the warm lentil salad was the perfect match for the fish.

Niche sets the tone for fine dining in Geneva...and perhaps the tri cities. It just works. From the moment you walk in and are greeted, to the end of the meal, the service is quiet, helpful, professional, warm, and discreet. The consistency of service, presentation, taste, wine and wine recommendations, etc. is perfect and one that other restaurants should strive for.

Why 4 stars and not 5? There seemed to be some sort of issue with the music that night. At times it was quiet, at a few points it suddenly got louder...loud enough that the table became aware of it and everyone started raising their voices to be heard. Leave the louder music to Even Flow (next door), and keep the ambiance you&#39;ve had for so long.

niche-geneva-2,Cristie F.,d-KWUwwt9jGmuIBG5pyP0w,D2mAInukgTZhGu9F7vyOcg,"Niche is apparently the new kid in town when it comes to the Main Street strip in Geneva. Well at least in my book. I suppose I fail to see what else exists off the main strip. 

Either way, it&#39;s swanky. It&#39;s elegant. It&#39;s gorgeous. Decorated in a modern, yet classic style with sleek lines, traditional prints, and an abundance of dark woods. Niche sets the perfect stage for a sexy date night.

The food itself was delicious. Fresh and local veggies from Bull Run farm, fresh meats and seafood, and vast selection of artisan cheeses &amp; meats - contemporary American done right. You have the option of selecting from their main menu or their smaller menu which features a variety of small plates. We were celebrating our anniversary so we opted to order from both. 

Watermelon Salad // See uploaded picture. I can&#39;t quite describe the dish and it was nothing what I expected. It was a thinly sliced, perfectly cut rectangle of watermelon soaked in vinegar with a couple holes cut out and replaced with pineapple, basil and avocado. It wasn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s not the first item I recommend.

Burrata and Apricot Salad // Get it. Don&#39;t think twice. 

Grilled Ono with Dill Spaetzle // For a girl who vomits at the thought of seafood, I gave the Ono a try and actually liked it. That said, it comes highly recommended. The dill spaetzle - addictive. 

Bull Run Tart // Meh. Mixed emotions. For a vegetarian dish it was good. I wasn&#39;t crazy about it. The spaghetti squash was drenched in butter, which I could have done without.

Mango Bomba // Amazing. Blackberry tapioca? Don&#39;t knock it &#39;til you try it. 

Trio of Arancini // These tasty morsels are on the small plates menu. If you get anything, get these. They&#39;re quite filling, full of flavor, and the best damn arancini I&#39;ve yet to eat.

The service was professional, prompt, and knowledgeable. However, when I asked to have my overly buttery spaghetti squash replaced with some steamed spinach I saw a lovely $5 charge on the bill. That wasn&#39;t cool. But, our dessert came free of charge so I suppose it all worked out. No hard feelings.

Two of us walked in without reservations. We were promptly greeted but were told that there were no tables available.  There were clearly four or five tables available in the bar area.  I asked about those tables and if they served dinner there.  We were told &#34;yes&#34;.  This was a bit awkward.  We were seated, given the menus and asked if we would like to order a drink.  We hadn&#39;t picked up the drink menu yet and then were asked three more times in five minutes if we would like to order drinks.  I felt very rushed.  

Once we ordered drinks, two glasses of Prosseco, we were immediately asked if we would like to order food--again, rushed. 

I asked about their three course chef&#39;s choice and the waitress had no clue.  She went to the kitchen to ask and listed off three things on the menu.  I was a bit disappointed because other places I have been the chef does something a little special other than what is on the menu for at least one of the dishes.

We ordered off the menu and asked for a Cabernet to be served with our food. Our food arrived, and it was very mediocre. We were never brought out the Cabernet we ordered! I had the tuna dish and the other person had the pork dish. We also ordered two sides--a vegetable salad side and the basil and eggplant dish.  Both of the main dishes were very bland and lacked the complexity of flavors I have come to experience in small plate dining.  

We both left food on the plate and hardly touched the sides.  The basil eggplant dish was the best of the bunch but went unfinished.  I rarely ever leave food on the plate by the end of a meal let alone in a small plate dining experience! 

Our plates and Prosecco glasses were cleared and the waitress said, &#34;Oh, I didn&#39;t bring your wine because you didn&#39;t finish your Champaign&#34;   Seriously??? 

We asked to see the dessert menu.  There was a little food that had fallen off the plate on the table in front of us and it was never cleaned.  I asked if we could have a napkin to clean the food off and instead of cleaning it she handed me a napkin to do myself. 

Needless to say, we did not order dessert!

niche-geneva-2,Leslie S.,rbQp0U49dlq-IcC9d3uBdw,IwppRCiAYhR7DFGoANqbwA,"I&#39;ve been to Niche twice now, and both times I&#39;ve been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and service. Most recently, my fiance and I decided to spend his birthday at Niche - he called ahead and asked if they might be able to create a special menu catering toward our specific (and very different) tastes for the celebration. Chef Serena and sommelier Vinny designed a menu that did just that, for which we were very thankful. 

Our meal included a roasted chestnut soup that was thick and rich, and absolutely wonderful, as well as a fois gras torchon that was so delicious my fiance ordered three more. Even I had to admit the fois gras was the very good, and I do not like fois at all. We also had a beautiful pheasant stew that I will not soon forget! Dessert included whiskey cake, stout ice cream and a meringue cigarette that reminded us of a recent Top Chef episode. Overall, it was a very good meal and we were very pleased that the staff helped put it together for us.

That being said, I deduct some points for the fact that the items we were served were all regular menu items - if I were to return to Niche this evening, I could order the exact same items. We were really hoping for another Kohler experience, where the chef and sommelier put together a completely unique menu that had never been served to another guest, nor will it ever be. Considering that our dinner at Kohler included Dom Prignon champagne and some of the best wines I&#39;ve ever tasted, all for a significantly lower price than Niche&#39;s birthday dinner, I can&#39;t give Niche five stars (I&#39;ve only given two restaurants five stars, and if you read those reviews, you&#39;ll see why). The meal was very good, but not exactly what we were looking for.

Still, if you&#39;re in the Western suburbs and looking for an outstanding meal - of the same quality as some of the top restaurants in Chicago - Niche is definitely the place to go. The food is mostly stellar, and the service, as I mentioned previously, is top notch. Some of the waitstaff has been at the restaurant since it opened (some even before, as it was owned by another group/called something else), which says something about the way they treat their staff (which I think is, in turn, passed on to the customers as well).

I would not call the decor a mix of urban farmhouse and loft, as another reviewer does - it&#39;s actually a bit dated, with lots of dark woods, dark carpet, and truly awful ceiling tile. Most, if not all, guests dress well, meaning collared shirts and trousers for the men (often jackets as well), and dresses or dress slacks for women.

One thing to note is that the restaurant only serves American wines. Say what you will about California and Oregon, but American wine is limiting and not for everyone&#39;s palate/meal. I wish they would broaden their horizons and offer some foreign wines as well.",15/12/12,325,4,2,5,25,8.6436,3.189,0.221,16.589000000000002,No,2906

Niche has one of the most upscale modern dining rooms in the West Suburbs. The tables are well spaced apart. The chairs are comfortable. The lighting is good. The room is quite without being &#34;dead&#34;. 

The service here is also very professional. 

Let&#39;s talk about the food.

Shrimp and Grits were delicious.

Duck Confit wrapped in Phyllo was excellent and a good option to share (4 pcs)

Whitefish was cooked perfectly.

Hanger Steak got &#34;topped off&#34; with beef jus table-side. Yummy!

I would definitely classify Niche as a fine dining restaurant. Be prepared to spend $75-80 a person with wine, tax, and a 20% tip.

One of the few Chicago-quality restaurants in the dining wasteland of the Tri-Cities.  We&#39;ve never had a bad meal and service is impeccable especially if Jeffrey is your server (ask for him!)

However, a huge disappointment for me is their lack of vegetarian entrees for their special occasion/event menus.  We really wanted to go there for Christmas Eve dinner but for $48 per person they only offer pheasant or beef tenderloin for an entree.  I called and inquired about veggie options and I spoke with the chef who only offered roasted veggies &#34;whatever was on hand&#34; that day.  I certainly don&#39;t want to go there and pay $48 for a mystery veggie entree.

For their Naughty Xmas special event, for $60 a person they only offer elk for the entree.  Again, no accommodation for vegetarians.  If I go to upscale restaurant and pay close to $200 for a special event meal, I don&#39;t want to be told that I will be served whatever veggie options are on hand.  I am not vegan, I DO eat fish and I don&#39;t understand why an upscale restaurant like Niche can not offer a fish option for their special events.

First off, let me say that our dining experience was probably different than most nights since Charles Woodson (GB Packers player) was there holding a dinner/wine event.  (We&#39;re Bears fans and we were probably the ONLY Bears fans in the room that night. We were sure to keep quiet :-)  But Mr. Woodson was not the reason we were there anyway ;-)  

I loved the ambiance of the building; very beautiful and romantic setting.  
Hubby had the grilled striploin which he thoroughly enjoyed.  I ordered the veal medallions; fan-tastic!  All of the dishes were beautifully prepared, very detailed presentations, which I appreciated.

Desserts were wonderful, the carrot cake was delicious and the serving size was just enough.

The appetizer was absolutely delicous but the serving size was itsy bitsy!  We ordered the maple leaf duck with polenta.  I&#39;m a huge fan of duck and was super excited to try this appetizer but I had to hold in my laughter when the waiter brought it to our table.  It was so tiny and at first, I thought it was only part of it.  But then I quickly realized noooope, this was it!  It was SO good but literally about 4 bites.  Two for me. Two for hubby.  Nice that it worked out for us to both get some ;-)

Definitely an expensive dining experience but it&#39;s a nice place for a special event like a birthday or anniversary.
Cotton candy at the end was so fun!

**UPDATE
We&#39;ve been to Niche a few times and they no longer end your meal with complimentary cotton candy :-(  It was such a unique and fun touch and has to cost next to nothing to make.  
Also, I wish they offered a bit more with your entree (bread, salad, soup, SOMETHING).  Our last meal there was actually quite disappointing.  Flavor was bland and overall, both dishes we ordered did not leave a positive lasting impression.

On a cold Tuesday night, the restaurant was holding a media evening; several well-known food critics were present. The result was a noticeable dialing up of both service and food quality.

We took advantage of the 5 course chef&#39;s menu with wine pairing. The Shrimp and Grits was an extraordinarily light dish. Grits with creamy and tasty artisinal goat&#39;s cheese, a tomato coulis layered with 4 different spices, including cayenne paprika and tobacco which provided surprising depth.

The pleasant arugula salad was not overpowered by the capers and acted as a palate cleanser.

The Winter Cassoulet was presented as a deconstructed pot pie, the result being an unctuous dish layered with flavor, as opposed to a classic Toulousian dish with big chunks of meat. It was excellent.

Humbolt Fog was pleasantly presented with freshly baked crackers and accompaniments.

The white chocolate cheesecake was so light, and perfectly matched with both a chocolate and berry sauce.

Service was spot on from our enthusiastic, young waitress Liz, who provided just the right balance on conviviality and service. The chef, Serena, walked around and was happy to take questions and explain her sources.

Wine pairings were well chosen, if not &#39;top drawer,&#39; but for $25 a person it was very acceptable, although the pours were just a wee bit short of generous ..

I very rarely give 5 stars, as the meal really has to be both a memorable and faultless experience for me, but Niche earned it, and if they can maintain this level of cooking and service it would be both wonderful and hard work.

This is obnoxiously picky, but table settings were a mishmosh of Victorian (green bread plates) and random other styles. At a restaurant with such good food that considers itself to be fine dining, it was almost as if after a remodel they kept a few of their old pieces and didn&#39;t go all the way to replace their china.

The service was horrible.  We had Jeffrey as our waiter.  Seven people in our party and of those six had never been to Niche, but had wanted to try it.  

We arrived at 7 pm and, despite calling at 5 pm to confirm our number and reservation, the table was not ready.  Evidently, the guy that answers the phone is not the guy who makes sure the tables are set correctly.

We ordered a variety of small plate dishes and desserts about 7:30 pm, but it wasn&#39;t until 9 pm that everyone finally had a dish served to them.  The waiter decided that we should be served in courses, but that meant that three people in our party (almost 50%) were left without anything to eat for two courses.   He told us, not ASKED US, that he was going to serve in courses.  It was his way or the highway.  After too much time between courses, I asked the waiter if he could please just bring out all of the dishes.  Another 30 minutes goes by as he serves everyone else in the restaurant, but us.  

I asked him, &#34;Is the kitchen backed up?&#34;  (Yes, I would have been more understanding if our change in service meant the kitchen was backed up.)  He says &#34;No ma&#39;am.  I explained to YOU how I was going to serve the meal.  You remember that right?&#34;  Yes, he did, but he never ASKED me how our group wanted to be served.  We had 3 people sitting through two courses with nothing to eat.  We had ordered various small plates and desserts.  It was not ordered as a formal meal.  He maybe the waiter, but I am the customer and I do not appreciate attitude or being put in my place when I&#39;m asking on behalf of my group for our food to be delivered sooner than later.

Once the food started coming, people were getting served the wrong food.  Two people were served food three times that they didn&#39;t order and three times they had to repeat what they had ordered to the waiter after telling him &#34;I didn&#39;t order this.&#34;  Doesn&#39;t he write this stuff down???

Then the bills - It took almost an hour from the time one person had requested her bill until the rest of us got ours.

There were other tables that had been seated at the same time as us.  They had been served, finished their meal and paid their bill by the time we were finally able to pay our bills.

20% auto gratuity added to parties of 6 people or more so we as customers had no recourse for bad service.

The fact is seven people went to Niche.  Only one in our party said she would be back.  The rest said they would tell their friends how bad the service was.",20/09/11,290,1,1,1,-4,0.3798000000000002,2.0730000000000004,1.8410000000000002,29.086,No,2643

Once seated, I started with a mushroom tart, which was supposed to be topped with a poached egg, but was closer to hard-boiled. The flavor was good, but the egg was just plain overdone. It was followed by a mediocre salad, and the rib eye. The steak was very fatty and had an okay flavor. It might have been better had it been bone-in. I finished off the meal with some decent gelato and coffee. 

The waiter dripped some hot coffee on my arm and pants. I said something along the lines of &#34;Owe!&#34;, but he just didn&#39;t seem to be paying much attention.

Niche encompasses 80% of what made 302 great (minus 302&#39;s grand atmosphere, that amazing bar, and hostess Catherine).  Otherwise the food, servers, and location were all spot on.  Here is an overview of what we had:

$10-Duck confit nachos: perfect portion of crisp and protein.  This was the most expensive appetizer out of 8 or so.

$8- glass of sparkling wine each for a friend and I, although they do have $500 bottles of wine so this may be where people start racking up their bills.

Free-Mango sorbet intermezzo: perfect palette cleanser

$24-Kalmata olive marinated chicken with egg plant and artichokes over a red pepper sauce.  Very moist and portion was very satisfying.

$27-schezwan beef: huge portion of tender steak in a sweet Asian sauce.  

We both had sides of the garlic mash too, not quite as good as 302&#39;s goat cheese mash but right up there.

Entrees ranged from $16-35, the most expensive being a filet.

$10-Niche coffee:  the exact same as coffee 302  and thank god it is.  Perfect blend of coffee, grand marnier, irish cream, with a cinnamon sugar rim.

$6- creme brle with chocolate chip cookies:  a classic

$8-peanut butter panna cotta with a mini vanilla bean milk shake and warm fresh Italian doughnut holes.  This was the most expensive dessert btw.

First off the service is top notch and this place has the best stocked bar that I have ever seen.  If you enjoy alcohol do yourself a favor and stop by for a hard to find whiskey or beer.  
As for the food my wife ordered the vindaloo beef and I ordered the Atlantic scallops.  The vindaloo beef came with sweet potato hash browns topped with roasted Brussels sprouts and French green beans.  The combination of the sweet, bitter and savory is fantastic. The beef is also top notch.  The vindaloo sauce was described as Niche&#39;s take on an Indian / curry based topping for a perfectly cooked tenderloin.  The scallops were large sea scallops seared to perfection topped with a kind of parmesan cracker over a sweet leek jam accompanied by tart granny smith apples.  I have been dreaming of this dish every night since I have had it.  I am not kidding when I say this is the best scallop dish I have ever had.

To top it all off at the end of dinner the servers delivered each woman in the restaurant a single red rose.  It was a great experience and we will be back soon.",18/02/13,152,5,1,5,3,6.6133000000000015,2.890000000000001,0.461,11.649,No,1399
niche-geneva-2,David P.,uF3nta5_dezrAZI-DNpRRA,GtidPiXp_mitjG15G87-bA,"Niche never fails to live up to my expectations, and consistently leaves me anxiously waiting for the next visit.

This is not a place to go for dinner. It is a place to go and enjoy an evening of extraordinary tastes and wines with company deserving of such. If your unable to sit for several hours and casually absorb the expertly prepared courses paired with a very unique wine list, then go elsewhere.

It is the absolute best the Tri-cities has to offer. And while not on par with a restaurant such as Chicago&#39;s Tru, it also doesn&#39;t require cashing in your children&#39;s college fund.

A couples night out: a couple bottles of wine (white for my bride, red for me), cheese plate, appetizers followed by a shared soup (combined table side), salad, main course and desert, typically averages $250 to $300. And is worth every penny. Less splurging can cut the tab by half; I just don&#39;t have that level of self control.

The wine list is not large, but has a very unique diversity of styles, regions, and vineyards. A bit midscale in price with bottles starting around $40; it has some excellent selections. 

A bit of sherbet cleanses the palate, and Niche&#39;s cotton candy brought at meals end is the perfect primer for desert.

If you have never been, pick the date, call ahead for reservations, and enjoy.",25/11/10,162,5,1,4,-24,3.6163999999999996,1.693,0.198,11.109,No,1325

niche-geneva-2,Kate D.,ZI12Mb7isBNGXNKYQhrxuw,szyUy2gfaLeTI2zOphfl6g,"This place deserves 5 stars compared to other expensive restaurants.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to dock them for cost since I knew it would be a pricey meal going in.  Same goes for the &#34;fancy factor.&#34;  This is an elegant restaurant.  Expect your fellow diners to be dressed elegantly.  Make a reservation.  If there are none available, they&#39;ll call you if something opens up.  

That said, the service at Niche is unparalleled, especially for suburban dining.  My fiance and I have been there twice, and both times we were the youngest people in the room by at least 15 years.  Some fancy places snub the younger crowd but not Niche.  The hostesses treated us like royalty and let us select our table.  Our waitress, Kathy, spent extra time chatting with us about the menu and wines as well as our engagement.  Chef Jeremy even came out to say hello and how great it was to see young people who love food in his restaurant.  On our first visit we received a delicious creme broulee on the house and for the second trip we were given free champagne and cotton candy, spun in house!  How fun!  

I highly recommend the clam chowder.  It&#39;s the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The bosc pear salad is refreshing and crisp.  Their duck is flavorful without being too fatty.  The fingerling potatoes are a fun twist on the typical potato side dish.  For dessert I love the cheesecake with fresh berries.  The chocolate espresso truffle cake is decadent and just the right size.  The cappuccino and biscotti is great if you&#39;re on the full side.  You can&#39;t go wrong with the desserts at Niche.

This is the perfect place if you&#39;re celebrating something because they really do make you feel special.  Cozy, friendly, romantic and worth the expense for sure.",01/03/10,200,5,2,5,43,8.7476,5.707000000000001,0.27699999999999997,20.016,No,1775

Regardless, I&#39;m glad the place is here and we had a chance to go.

We went there on Mardis Gras after seeing a promotion for their Fat Tuesday Feast Winter Tasting Menu. This being a minor holiday for most but big for foodies, we expected a crowd, and there was none. In fact, there were only two other tables occupied during the 2 hours we were there, which makes me fear for the future of the place. Maybe it&#39;s just the Tuesday night factor.

Everything we ate was thoughtfully prepared, from fine ingredients, and tasted fantastic. We started with the best pork belly I&#39;d ever eaten, went on to lobster fritters, fried oyster on brioche with crawfish touffe, strawberry sorbet intermezzo, chicken sausage jambalaya, and a perfect pecan tart. Our server, Jeffrey, was attentive, pleasant helpful, and warm, and didn&#39;t bat an eye at several &#34;information requests&#34; that we made. Realizing that we were there on a slow night, I nevertheless couldn&#39;t imagine a more pleasant atmosphere.

The wine list is intimidating and we copped out to a special offering associated with the current tasting menu. I&#39;m not a huge wine person, but I recognized very few of the offerings, most of which where in the $50-$100 range, or beyond. We didn&#39;t ask for suggestions, but I don&#39;t doubt that we would have gotten good advice if we had.

I suspect the place is very forgiving with respect to dress and protocol. I would be comfortable there in anything from jeans and a nice shirt, to a suit and tie, and there was no hint of pretense or snobbery from any of the staff. Thy have coat check service for those so inclined, or just hang your coat on the back of your chair.

We intend to put this long overlooked venue into our rotation, and are looking forward to our next excuse to go there (St. Pat&#39;s special sounds intriguing!).",17/02/10,219,4,1,5,0,4.9387,2.7540000000000004,0.805,14.440999999999999,No,2047

Our dirty martinis were not so dirty so had to be redone, on multiple orders - and I&#39;m usually not too picky when it comes to a good martini. Our soup was cold, it was supposed to be warm/hot but was not, regardless not too bad. The complimentary bread was yummy. I got the scallops but my meal was lacking any real flavor.

We were there pretty late and Chef Jeremy came out to our table to check in.  Specifically, he wanted to see in which order I tried the dipping sauces for the coconut frog legs.  We asked him about the use of honey in salad dressing and he went into a story about how he has purchased (or &#34;beeshared&#34; for lack of a better term) beehives from a local apiarist.  Now he can get honey and honeycomb as much as he&#39;d like.

First the positive - the updated decor is very nice, I would say casually elegant.  Now the les than positive observations.  Let me start by saying that our last rating was 5 stars and quite honestly this was the best restaurant in the western suburbs, in my opinion. After tonight, the rating is 3 stars.  Niche has taken a step back, in my opinion, to appeal to a wider variety of clientele.  Whereas before I would classify a niche as fine dining, I would say it is definitely casual, albeit on the nicer end of casual.  The new chef is clearly trying to out his stamp on the menu and while the selections were diverse and appealing,the quality was not the same as it used to be with previous chefs. I had the lamb chops and for $32 was disappointed at receiving only two relatively small chops.  It looked more like an appetizer.  There was not much flavor and the meat was quite tough.  My wife had chicken which appeared to be a rather low quality boneless cutlet with not much flavor.  There are no more pre dinner bread selections and the cold fruit soup du jour was uninspiring. I would say that Niche can now be considered an average restaurant, but unfortunately I was looking for fine dining.

Had to wait an extra 20 minutes in very cramped quarters. Not the end of the world but there was a line of people that experienced the same thing. 

There was a bigger gray haired lady who was very hungry and she became very vocal. The manager got into somewhat of a yelling match with her. She then proceeded to complain for the next 20 minutes. Bad start to the our experience here and it did not get better.

Once we were finally sat the server eventually came to our table a good 5 minutes later to check our pulse. She took our drink order and disappeared. 

We sat near the horseshoe bar. It was way too crowded for the middle of an intimate restaurant setting. There were some townie hillbills at the bar loudly cursing and being obnoxious. Clearly over served. The staff or management did nothing to quiet the riffraff down. Again, not a big deal if I were at the local watering hole but this is an intimate Italian restaurant that caters to couples!

The server came back with our drinks a good 15 minutes later. Overall the service was painfully slow and inattentive throughout the night. Once our check came we waited another good 15 minutes to pick the payment up. 

Oh the food... it was actually pretty good as well as the atmosphere (minus the over served drunks cursing at the bar). The drinks were also good....

The highlight of the dining experience was the spicy seafood pasta. That was hands down the best thing we ate all night. We also enjoyed salmon, roasted chicken and wild mushroom stuffed pasta. Everything was pretty good. 

Drinks: We had a few glasses of castle rock Pinot noir. They were just ok. We also had a mixed drink that was good.",18/05/14,107,4,2,5,28,6.0207,3.6419999999999995,0.383,10.975000000000001,No,938

1. After walking in, it took the host about 5 minutes to greet us. I don&#39;t think it was even the host, it looked like a stressed out manager. Okay, fine, understaffed, I get it. Moving on...
2. After being seated it took another 5 minutes just to be greeted by our waitress, Kate. This seemed to be a theme for her throughout the night: never being around. She took our drink orders simple enough. As I was about to ask a question about the specials she disappears without even a &#34;I&#39;ll be back with your drinks shortly&#34;
3. Bread is brought to the table. Drinks are dropped off. I ask the waitress for some Parmesan cheese to go with the oil and bread. She replies of course.
4. Waitress disappears. Again I&#39;m thinking it must be understaffed and try to stay patient. Next time I look up she is just standing off to the side by the computers doing nothing. 
5. My husband and I are done with our drinks before she even comes back asking if we want an appetizer. (Still no Parmesan cheese). We politely decline and say we&#39;re ready to order (don&#39;t want her disappearing again).
6. Our food comes. Still no Parmesan cheese. We finally are able to flag her down again to ask for the cheese again. Another 5 minutes later she finally sends over a busboy to shred us some Parmesan cheese. During that period not once did she walk by to ask if our meal was okay.

Before you start thinking I&#39;m harsh let me tell you I have worked in the food&amp;beverage industry for many years and can tell the difference between being slammed with work and just not giving two sh!ts about your table.

The real kicker is before we ever got our Parmesan cheese, another table was sat where she greeted them immediately with bread and cheese!

Service:HORRIBLE! Our waitress came to our table maybe 3 times the entire night. She was not in any hurry to serve our table or anyone elses. Not to mention she gave us a rudely difficult time about splitting of bill 3 ways and put other couples food on our bill despite us numbering the food for her. 

Atmosphere: Great place to go with significant other or a date for a quiet evening. Bad place to go if you want to have a conversation with multiple people. Crowd is very nosy and stuck up as well as the wait staff. Our table of 6 was awkwardly stared at when we had a laugh or loud conversation.

Food: Very good quality. 

Overall: There is another location in Naperville. We have been there and LOVED it! Atmosphere and service are 5+star!! Go there if you can and if not just go across the street to Emmetts or somewhere else. This location does not deserve you money.

Based on the stellar Yelp rating, we decided it was perfect for what we were in the mood for. I was even able to make the reservations via Yelp...how great?!?! 

When we walked in, I realized all the tables were extremely close together. We asked if we could sit in the back of the restaurant up the small set of stairs. We just wanted a little privacy for our rare night out without our daughter. 
We didn&#39;t expect to find every couple that brought their child with in that back area where we were. With the exceptions of a few cries here and there, they were fairly well behaved kids...just not what we were hoping for. 

I started out with a Sam Adams Winter Ale &amp; she had a Dundee Martini, which she grew tired of after her first few sips. We also chose the fried Calamari as our appetizer, which was perfectly cooked...wasn&#39;t overly chewy &amp; the perfect amount of breading, very tasty. 

I ordered the Gnocchi with meat sauce and she ordered the Linguine with seafood in spicy tomato sauce. We ended up switching entrees halfway through, cause the spice was a little too much for her. I really enjoyed both dishes. The shrimps &amp; scallops were large and tasty in the linguine. It was our first time trying Gnocchi &amp; we were very happy we chose it. Both sauces were very tasty. We had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day&#39;s lunch. 

We ordered the apple pie with ice cream for desert. The warm apple pie melted the ice cream so perfectly together. We were both happy we made the decision to have desert even though we were stuffed. 

The service was great. Give the amount of table our server was handling, he was surprisingly fast, attentive &amp; happy!

I also tried one non-Italian dish:  the 1/2 chicken:  5/5 and attractively served.

Our main server was Jessica:  she was very nice to the very young child in our group.  Very attentive service overall.  The place was packed but not too noisy.

We did not look at the children&#39;s menu.  I suspect that a family with more than one child in the 3-12 year old age group would be uncomfortable.

My only complaint:  why do some restaurants have to charge an arm and a leg for a glass of wine?  A glass of merlot cost $12.",17/11/12,141,5,2,4,35,3.2282,2.525,0.34600000000000003,15.129,No,1222

My family and I have dined there about a half a dozen times now and we are never disappointed. Last night was no different. We had a reservation at 8 PM, we arrived a little early and was promptly seated. We decided to start the evening off with a Napoletana pizza,it was delicious and the perfect size for the three of us. We ordered three dinner entrees. The spaghetti alla pescatora, rigatoni con broccoli and a skate wing fish with olive oil, capers and fresh tomato sauce. Everything was cook perfectly and the flavors are out of this world. Our hats off to the kitchen team. There is also a never ending supply of fresh warm bread to dip in a herb infused olive oil.

It goes a bit like this, repeated over and over again: I have never been disappointed at Francesca&#39;s. 

(Oh, okay, fine -- there was that one caprese martini they served at Francesca&#39;s on Clark St. that I found rather repulsive, but I am guessing that they have figured out that it is repulsive and have taken It off their menu. Don&#39;t tell me otherwise.)

Italian is so easy to fuck up, because we Americans do it in our kitchens every night. &#34;Let&#39;s have pasta! Overcooked pasta with jarred, preservative-filled sauce and maybe a white powdery substance from a green can! And also bread! Because we need elbows upon elbows of bread to balance the carbohydrates on the plate&#34; 

It&#39;s all so desperately pathetic. 

But Francesca&#39;s seems to have learned about Italy from somewhere other than the alley behind Olive Garden or the set of a Giada de Laurentiis episode. I&#39;m guessing this because it&#39;s really, really good. Fresh, flavorful ingredients are the focus of the plate; thoughtful pairings of meats and sauces and vegetables -- oh, the vegetables! -- and seasonings are all there for your fork&#39;s delight.

My father always orders the seafarer&#39;s bounty (that&#39;s what it would be called at Olive Garden), which looks like a blood-streaked ocean threw up on a plate of pasta. But in a really good and delicious way! He&#39;s always happy with that. And my mother ordered a cheese-and-spinach ravioli dish that would have been rubbery and overly seasoned elsewhere, but here brought the delicateness of the filling to the forefront. I won, though: I ordered a spicier dish that featured chicken breasts bathed in a kicky red sauce and decorated with olives. The tang of the olive plus the zip of the sauce really made me happy. So, so very happy.

We had two decadently chocaltey desserts that night, which was better than okay but not as good as a wafer-crusted chocolate peanut butter number we ordered a few months ago. Now that -- that really could give you a reason to live.

Visit Francesca&#39;s often, early, and always. It&#39;s really the best place to eat along the Fox.",21/02/11,261,5,2,5,23,7.037400000000001,4.386,0.5539999999999999,19.06,No,2406

Reason being that I normally eat out with my larger family or a group of people and sample 5 to 10 different things off the menu.  That gives me a much greater feel of the restaurant and I leave knowing whether or not I would return.  I had one item here - the ravioli.

It&#39;s a cute place, very small/cozy and decorated well on the inside.  The wait staff did a fair job as bus boys and servers passed the buck sharing their respective duties and making sure my water glass didn&#39;t fall below half full.  Kudos to that.  The free bread was unfortunately bland.  At this point in my life I&#39;m officially done with plain white bread.  There&#39;s not an ounce of flavor to be found whereas wheat/rye/sourdough pack big flavor punch.  The ravioli was sauced properly and had a nice flavor without being overly cheesy - something I have yet to figure out when making them from scratch at home.

Would I return?  I don&#39;t know.  My knowledge of West Dundee doesn&#39;t expand far beyond knowing they have a &#34;main street&#34;.

I even believe they could have a branch in East Dundee and have an equally successfully business, they are that good. It is a bit claustrophobic and we&#39;ve always asked to be seated either in the front or the back; the main aisle is a bit &#34;bumpy&#34; with the traffic. 

Our most recent delight was on NYE, last weekend. For appetizer/salad, we split the carpaccio (delicious!) and the shrimp and scallop salad. Having had rubber scallops, I&#39;m always a bit shy, but I knew it&#39;d be good here. I was not disappointed. We moved on to Lobster pasta for two of us and the grouper for the other two. The boys&#39; grouper came out first and it was just warm, not hot and that was the only turn off. Our lobster ravioli was incredibly hot and incredibly tasty. Rich and meaty, it was worth the $20. Usually, when we eat here, I take home half the entree. Not this night. Our dessert offerings were flourless cake for my gluten-intolerant husband, coconut sorbet and mint choco chip gelato for me, and chocolate brownie w/ caramel for my mother in law. Marvelous.  

Again our meals here are consistently good. In this area (Elgin, Dundee, Algonquin, etc.) this is KEY. So many restaurants turn over and it&#39;s wonderful to see this one survive. We started here with our wedding rehearsal dinner four years ago and we&#39;ll keep coming back!

After hearing my boss rant and rave about Francesca&#39;s for months I decided to stop in and try it.

We lucked out because the place was jammed packed on a Saturday night and we were originally told it was a 30 min wait and we were seated in 10 min. Next time we will make reservations!
The place is beautifully decorated and it houses a small bar in the corner. The lighting is dim for a more romantic feeling, and the service was great.

The reason I gave this place 4 stars rather than 5 is because the seating is ridiculously cramped together. Where we sat it was basically one long booth against a wall with the tables and chairs in front of it. So you can imagine trying to squeeze in between the tables to get to the booth. This poor guy who was seated next to us had to squeeze in between our table and his and almost pulled the table cloth right off our table. I think they need to redesign the place as far as seating goes..but other than that it was a wonderful experience.

We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer and it was very good. Lightly breaded not as heavy as most restaurants and the marinara sauce was fab! 
For the main dish I ordered their Shrimp and Scallop mixed with a zesty tomatoe sauce on a bed of angel hair pasta. OMG it was delicious!! Everything complimented each other. It was amazing.

Francesca&#39;s Campagna is a cozy but classy feeling restaurant.
I stopped in when it was almost completely empty so I was seated right away. They sat me behind a corner so I was alone and hidden... I think this prevented my waiter from seeing me because I wasn&#39;t greeted for a fairly long time.
It wasn&#39;t until the only other table in the area was paying for their meal that someone noticed me sitting there. 
After this slight debacle service was very friendly and attentive for the remainder of the meal.

I ended up with a pesto dish with this short, thick, slightly twisted pasta. The pasta was cooked perfectly, it had awesome, awesome texture. Mmm. The first few bites were delicious and blissful but I quickly got tired of the taste. It could&#39;ve used more salt, herbs, or cheese or something to help me get through the entire entree. I think it would&#39;ve been perfect as an appetizer or side dish of sorts.

I&#39;ve been a long time fan of its lunch...fair prices...always fresh ingredients and not too mention they seem to always have something I REALLY want to eat for lunch...

now as for dinner time...I have always had a hard time finding something I wanted to eat off the menu for dinner..I don&#39;t know why...they just have never had anything that really caught my eye or my appetite...EXCEPT last winter they had Penne Bolognese... WOW that was fantastic..I think i ate it two weeks in a row...right Mike?

OKAY:  why I really love this place...

I can&#39;t Forget Mike...aside from being one of the best bartenders I know...he knows his spirit and wine list..and has the menu down pat...he&#39;s a real asset to the place...

NOW my only knock on the place...isn&#39;t really a knock on the place at all...I cannot blame management for their philosophy on their wine purchasing...I can only blame Franchesca&#39;s customers, IE the people of Dundee and surrounding areas who patronize this great Italian restaurant and can&#39;t/won&#39;t/don&#39;t explore the wonderful world of Italian wine... Pinot Grigio is not the only white wine produced in Italy...and yes there is Sangiovese outside of Chianti; its not even the most widely produced grape in Italy...  why does this bother me...well in my opinion the list is lacking... but luckily Mike usually pulls some strings and tries to bring something unique in... usually to be unappreciated by the patrons...  ah suburbia....",28/07/09,207,4,2,2,44,1.8812,0.28900000000000003,0.037,1.673,No,1935

-they don&#39;t make their desserts - and they are overpriced
-their martinis suck- like drinking juice

-server had no personality and recommended a glass of wine with the excuse that martinis were overpriced ...on half price martini day...hmmm trying to hustle me
-their espresso machine looks like it has never been serviced..the steam wand is crusted..gross

We were wrong.

We, too, elected to sit on the patio and ordered our drinks. That took a while. Okay, well, it&#39;s pretty crowded I guess, so we can forgive that. Then we ordered our meal: a turkey burger with fries and a side salad. The salad came around 15 mins later and it was pretty measly. We were starving so we ate it quickly. Then we got our turkey burger. I was hoping it would be homemade, but it was very obviously store bought. The flavor was okay - but I could literally make the same thing at home (and for a lot less than $10). The fries were okay. They needed salt badly - kinda worried that they didn&#39;t think to add salt to them after they ran them out to us.

There was a younger guy out there that swatted flies the ENTIRE time we were out there.  I think it was very disgusting to do that while people are eating and while food is being served.  Most people who sit outside are aware that there will be flies around, no need to swat at them.  Also witnessed a server place ice into a cup with her HAND!!!  Very unsanitary. 

We ordered the sampler platter.  What a disappointment that was.  There were 3 of us in our party and we received 2 chicken wings, chicken tenders, cheese sticks,what they call Armadillo eggs (jalapeno poppers),  and a boat load of french fries.  They should really look at this item and make some adjustments.  2 of each item does no good when there more than 2 people in a party.  

We did not order anything else off of the menu.  And don&#39;t know if we will be back to try anything.",03/08/15,115,2,1,1,0,0.28169999999999995,0.7689999999999999,0.9349999999999999,13.296999999999999,No,1117

Growing up in Bartlett I&#39;ve been to this place many many times before, it has been a couple years decided to go back for a nice relaxing dinner on their patio since it was very nice outside. As soon as I sat down the people that I was meeting with right off the bat said our server had a bad attitude. I get that everyone has a bad day but you don&#39;t tell your customers about it. I was a server for a few years not an easy job by any means, but if you can&#39;t handle it go work somewhere else. Being in our 20s definitely didn&#39;t help the situation every other table was about 40 or over and did not get the same rude attitude from the girl server. 30 minutes after my brother and his friend asked for lemons they asked again nicely didn&#39;t even say anything about her forgetting. She then begins to tell us how she was stressed and had a full patio, basically stating that she did not have time to go get A couple lemons. So honestly, I asked if she wanted me to get them from the bar..After a couple more minutes she came over and threw three lemons on a soggy napkin on her table and walked away didn&#39;t even respond when my brother said thank you. Few minutes after that I received my drink which got slammed in front of me on the table also with no : here you go can I get you anything else would you like to order food, nothing no response stormed away. Little shocked that I was being treated like this after doing nothing walked inside to get a drink from the bar instead hoping that he would&#39;ve been in a little bit better of a mood, I was the only person standing at the bar while he was unpacking beer I didn&#39;t tap my fingers didn&#39;t make a sound, just waited patiently for him to be done, when I asked him for a Corona and a Coke all he did was fold his arms and shake his head. So I asked if he was serious? He said I was rude to his server and he could deny service to whom ever he wanted. When we tried to ask the server what the issue was she rolled her eyes and walked away multiple times. I don&#39;t really understand who lets a couple snotty twentysomething year-old run their bar but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very good for business.looking on yelp and Facebook I saw very many one star reviews this place is been around for a long time and I know a lot of people that like the area they should get their act together or they will eventually go under. I&#39;m 27 years old but I guess Look Young, I have never not tipped a person in my entire life as I am a hairstylist and work for tips myself it&#39;s embarrassing to treat someone like that that is not customer service. I understand we&#39;re not a fancy place downtown but it&#39;s usually great place for friends to meet up I will never go there again in my life! I will be sure to tell every single client that will sits in my chair about my unpleasant experience it doesn&#39;t matter what kind of day you&#39;re having I have never treated a client/customer in this manner and I have actually been screamed and yelled and swore at.

the-filling-station-pub-and-grill-st-charles,Johnny A.,l0_9uO9HSlhuMuMI95VASg,nqv9YtTpxEQv9lxRF1WLXQ,"A bit over-rated and has become essentially a drunk &#34;hang-out&#34; over the years.

I used to go to the Filling Station quite a bit some years back, either with buddies or on a few dates. This place is a staple for the downtown St. Charles river-walk area, or at least people say so.   Of course, in your early to mid 20s - things and places aren&#39;t always as they seem or are hyped up to be.

By day into early evening, this is nothing more than your average restaurant.  When the place is empty, the dining room actually looks nice. I remember the food being &#34;okay&#34;, but nothing spectacular where I would warrant going there to get take-out on my way home from someplace.

By mid evening into the early AM hours - this essentially becomes a glorified pub and &#34;hang-out&#34; for mostly 20&#39;s to 30&#39;s, though all ages are present.  The dining area almost becomes swallowed up with bodies to the point where it hampers and intrudes on the few stragglers left sitting at tables, trying to finish a meal.

Many times, me and my buddies specifically remember coming here and it was obvious that not only was the place severely understaffed for the crowd at hand - it was also probably over-capacity.  Now, this is not to be confused with it simply &#39;being crowded&#39;. When there are no tables, hundreds of people standing shoulder to shoulder and wall to wall to the point where you can&#39;t even meander around (think almost Times Square on New Years Eve, only on a much smaller level), and the noise level so loud that you have to scream in the ears of waitresses to place an order or your buddies to communicate - to me that is over capacity and simply not safe.  This is in hindsight, as when you are 22, you tend not to analyze logistics, or care too much :)

Best examples for this can be found on prime drinking nights - St. Patrick&#39;s Day (Night), Thanksgiving Eve (probably the worst in terms of crowds and poor service), New Years Eve, and even Black Friday night - also nights that correspond with many colleges being out of session beginning their holiday break.  Many times people will even crowd outside to the outdoor patio to smoke and drink - even though it may be 20 degrees out!  In my opinion, the outdoor seating area shouldn&#39;t even be open past a certain date, or when there are extreme cold temperatures - as it just adds to drunken loitering which can just further compound potential problems.  I realize the need for some people to have a smoke, though, so that is why this remains open.

Some of these times were also pre-2009 when smoking was still legal inside and many of these people had lit cigarettes.  We would sometimes discuss afterwards that if somebody jokingly yelled &#34;FIRE&#34;, probably 50 people would die just by being crushed or trampled.  IT WAS THAT WALL TO WALL PACKED.

Many of the bouncers and employees are also rude, or simply - A-holes.  I remember one time during an uncrowded session some bouncer or employee standing against a wall behind my party w/ some friends or co-workers - he giggled and made some comment to the effect of, &#34;look that dude has a Jimi Hendrix tattoo all over his arm.&#34;  The comment wasn&#39;t in a complimentary tone, as if I had Minnie Mouse or Rainbow Bright on my arm, and I just kinda looked back and gave the guy a dirty look and thought to myself - yah man - I don&#39;t dress like Jersey Shore and listen to Lil&#39; Wayne and emo like you probably do.  

As mentioned above, place can become loud and rowdy.  I took a few dates here where after awhile, me and the girl had to leave because we could barely converse without basically screaming at each other - we finished our conversation during a brisk walk by the Fox River.  I would not recommend this place for families, or stuff like dates or just casual dining UNLESS you come early enough - say before 8pm.

I also remember bathrooms being small, smelly, and dirty with grimy floors.

Lastly, this place is notorious for people loitering in the parking lot at very late hours, probably wasted. I saw this firsthand the times I was leaving here some years back, and now many times I see this SAME STUFF passing by while driving home from unrelated agenda.

I haven&#39;t been here in about 2 years, and have no urgency to go back anytime soon.  I think the place is overrated and can be grounds for trouble on several different fronts, and I&#39;m a bit past the stage of having poor service or standing uncomfortably in a bar if I want to get a pre-Holiday beer with some friends - there are plenty of other places I can do that at.",11/11/14,498,2,1,-2,-71,-2.1185,1.409,2.3520000000000003,26.238,No,4620

We arrived NYE a little after 7, we sit down, it&#39;s a good 15 minutes before being greeted (the place was dead maybe 10 people in the bar) so finally we get drink menus, the waitress was unfamiliar with the mixology of several of their house speciality drinks. After a good 20 minutes we finally got the drinks we ordered, she couldn&#39;t remember who ordered what but we got them. She came back a short time later to take our order. Now the menu is pretty simple sandwiches, burgers, appetizers, so all we were ordering was based on the menu, for example I wanted a turkey burger plan on a pretzel bun with fries. I got a turkey burger with everything plus grilled onions. All 6 people at the table got WRONG ORDERS. It took another 10-15 minutes for us to get the corrected orders however mine was still incorrect but at that point I&#39;m starving so I just ate it, more waiting and then a manager came, after listening to the problems we were experiencing his exact words &#34;I&#39;ll look into this and get back to you&#34;, another 15 minutes goes by.... He comes back and says it&#39;s not the kitchen (way to throw your server under a bus) and that he will comp some of the food and buy us a round. All in all he only took off like $40.

The owner just wants people to drink alcohol  on the patio and to make up money from those that don&#39;t.  This is the first reason never to go back.

On my initial visit we sat inside.  Kinda dark.  Moldy smelling.  Old wooden chairs that may have been purchased at a near by antique shop on North Avenue.  Ordered fish &amp; chips.  Got dry fish and chips that could have used more seasoning.  Saving grace...plenty of drink specials.

Second time around, a group of us were looking for airconditioning and cold refreshments after 9 holes of golf at Pottowatamie.  Sat inside again, but this time next to the bar in front.  More light, less moldy smell.  There was only one girl working our area so the wait was a bit longer than usual, but we kept ourselves busy with the flat screens &amp; talk of hot dog eating contests.

Ice cold Coke...automatic 2 stars!  Fast refill service for thirsty golfers on a 80+ degree summer afternoon...make that 4 stars!

Their sandwiches are huge!  The BLT is stuffed with what seemed to be 3 layers of crunchy bacon, some lettuce, a slice of tomato, and a generous smear of mayo.  Overflowing bacon falling off my sandwich made me a happy camper=)  Best side of coleslaw that I&#39;ve had in a long while, a little on the sweet side.

We were in St. Charles this past Sunday. Not the best day to be here as alot of businesses were closed. After we had done all the exploring we could, The Filling Station was one of just a few places open for lunch. We chose it because, A) we were hungry, and B) if you like that show American Pickers, it&#39;s kinda neat. They have all this old service station memorabilia, hence the name of the place. (In case you hadn&#39;t already put that together, I thoughtfully threw that in. I&#39;m digging for a few &#34;useful&#34; votes - ha ha ha.)
It was pretty dead. There was a guy at the bar, and one other couple. We sat at a high-top table overlooking the beer garden, which I imagine is nice during the summer months. Our very cute and polite server took our drink order, and then we got down to the business of deciding what to order. The menu here is not very exciting - but I do enjoy a good sandwich, and they had about 11 to offer. But they too, didn&#39;t sound all that thrilling. I decided on The Big Cheese on sourdough (3 cheese, grilled, with tomato), and my husband chose The Woody (same as above, but with bacon and onion). We opted for fries as our sides. Our server brought us our beers, took our order, and departed. We had both ordered Hacker-Pschorr. I looked at my beer. My husband looked at his. We both took a sip. We both made a face. We both set them down. I don&#39;t know what the heck that was, but if you look at the picture I posted, you&#39;ll agree - no way that&#39;s a Hacker-Pschorr. I&#39;m no beer expert (shout-out to Nichole K. : please forgive my amateur description of this), but it was the color of whiskey. It had positively no head to it. It tasted gross. We mentioned this to our server and she went to the bar to ask the bartender what it was. Her reply? &#34;That&#39;s Hacker-Pschorr Amber.&#34; Is there even such a thing? (Nichole? Nichole?) And if so, that&#39;s not what we ordered. She took it back and we settled for Goose Island 312. YAWN.
The sandwiches were small, the fries limp, and the beer disappointing. Service was good, with the exception of the bartender. It was a bummer. Too bad too, because we don&#39;t get out to St. Charles much.",26/02/13,260,2,1,2,5,1.5335,2.98,3.7520000000000002,33.27,No,2240

We wanted to find a place other than McDonalds to eat and have a good time. Boy were we disappointed lol. Granted we came for food and not the drinks or atmosphere which is unusual I guess. I am a late night prowler, and unfortunately was stuck in St. Charles.

The Good:

Waitress was very pleasant but was forgetful of a lot of things.

Atmosphere was unique to say the least and the crowd was really lively.

The Badzzz:

Food. I&#39;ve never felt so unhappy and mislead by the menu at this place. 

&#34;Supreme&#34; Nachos stated it was &#34;oven baked&#34; chips. To everyone&#39;s dismay, the $11 Nachos turned out to be Tostitos with lukewarm semi solid cheese mixed with beef. Tostitos.... Literally for $11. We laughed and estimated the amount to be of the $2 bag variety. 

Combo Platter literally looked like it was put together from different packs of things from the store and MICROWAVED. It didn&#39;t taste or feel made, I literally cringe that I was served a Microwaved combo platter. Which tasted worse than the microwavable stuff at the store. $14

The only edible items are their wraps and the fries.

Eating all this made me regret life the next day when I couldn&#39;t eat until around 4PM due to the food from last night. It wasn&#39;t until I went to the toilet I felt better and alive again.

I&#39;m one of the fresher people from college and definitely miss that scene. But this place is kind of like college all over again. Small spaces, lots of people, out door patio, long lines at the bar., cheap drinks. Not too shabby I must say.

The place is actually pretty big because it is also a restaurant. However if you come for the night life, you tend to stay more towards the bar side of the place. The includes 2 small rooms and the outdoor patio area. Outdoor area is nice as it has a lot of tables. But out of the few times I&#39;ve been here, it&#39;s always packed. Walking inside is annoying and I feel like a tiger stalking its prey when I wait for a table.

Getting a drink usually takes forever unless you have your own waitress. There are even 4 bartenders behind a small bar but still slow. So annoying. Like I&#39;m sure they can afford to open another bar just so that there&#39;s less traffic. Guess the cheap drinks make up for that though.

I said excuse me, did you just ask for me to write down what I wanted? ( because I thought maybe I misheard her) She then said, what do you want?

She asked me for my ID and yes this is in their job description but when I went to get my ID she then starred me down and rudely said &#34;I need to see all your friends IDs that you are with.&#34; First off, I too work at a bar and this is nobody&#39;s responsibility but hers. I understand the importance of IDing customers who look underage, but at no point in time was this my job, not to mention she had the time to ID them on her own. She then came out from the bar and approached my table asking everyone for their ID. She said to me &#34;What is with your attitude problem?&#34;. Me being a server of 6 years have never once in my career attacked or approached a customer in this way because I know that no matter how bad the day is, a customer never deserves to be treated in such a way. She will never make money for this bar, nor will she ever gain the respect of customers if she continues to speak to them in this way. She is a poor excuse for a bartender and should be dismissed from this establishment if they want to continue making a profit.

1st off there was a 20 min wait, it was a Saturday night no big deal the hostess asked us if we would like to wait in the lobby or in the bar. We decided to wait in the bar for seating outside,,,, Big Mistake!!! The waitress in the bar was nice very attentive however shes just bringing us beer and its a small bar I realize how many beers I&#39;ve had and ask our waitress to check on our table. Long story short They forgot about us 45 min later I&#39;m noticing new guests being seated outside. So were off to a bad start. 
2nd Now were buzzed &amp; starving!! We order right away and an appetizer to start with. The waitress specifically asks us if we want the &#34;nachos as an appetizer&#34;. 3 more beers &amp; I also ask for a ice water. 
3rd I get my ice water and there is crud in the glass GROSS Again I&#39;m pretty easy going but I&#39;m getting aggravated at this point. I send the water back and patiently wait for a new one.... 
4th OH No! All the food comes out at the same time! She specifically asked us &#34;do you want the nachos as an appetizer&#34; I gave the food runner a look of death. Still no water &amp; the nachos are cold. 
5th I still have no water and no real apology from the waitress. 
6th at this point I&#39;m expecting a manger to come over no one ever does 
I finally get my water after we ask for it. They did take the nachos off the bill BUT that really doesn&#39;t make it right. A manager should have come over and apologized or something there was just no customer service our entire visit. No apology for the table no explanation for the food coming out at the same time.

Pretty good, not amazing. I like Wildberry more.

When I saw Egg Harbor pop up, my first thought was, &#34;Uh-oh.&#34; I&#39;ve heard great things about EHC over the years, yet I never made it to one.

Fast-forward to an ultra busy day at Wildberry (wait was bordering on two hours) and we were hungry -- too hungry to wait. We walked right back out and drove down to EHC and were seated within 25 minutes. The packed lobby led us to believe it would be much longer, but they move people FAST.

Prices are on par with Wildberry, although Wildberry has a more creative menu (crepes, etc.). Egg Harbor does have more expensive coffee, and that put me off from ordering one.

We had:
1) Dynamite Veggie Egg White Omelet
2) Garden Delight Omelette
3) Winter in Italy French Toast

The omelets were good, and the Winter in Italy NAILED it. Really, really good. Interesting ingredients and flavours. I could never eat a whole plate of it, but I couldn&#39;t resist slicing a piece from my friend&#39;s plate, haha. Yum.

I had their Signature Buttermilk Pancake Combo with sausage links, scrambled eggs, and a glass of orange juice. Simply delicious! The orange juice is a must with anything you eat there as it it fresh-squeezed and as good as it gets. The pancakes lived up to their name (being signature and all) and were as light and fluffy as the highest cloud in the sky. The sausage links and scrambled eggs were perfect sides in the combo and complimented the pancakes perfectly.

egg-harbor-cafe-schaumburg-2,Kate S.,XBomRKII_TfQbKkL8QH9rQ,oVomIGObIfothFtpK47HOg,"Egg Harbor is a great place to try but not always the best for a stress-free breakfast.

I had been itching to visit this restaurant ever since it opened a couple months ago and don&#39;t regret it one bit. The food was tasty, the employees were very friendly and the complimentary coffee all sold me. Being that I visited Memorial Day weekend on a Sunday morning, I wasn&#39;t expecting any less than to have to wait to be seated. It was VERY crowded but the wait was only about 20 minutes - from the looks of things I was expecting AT LEAST an hour.

The reason I gave Egg Harbor 3 stars was due to the fact that my boyfriend and I had to ask 12 questions before we could even put our order in. There is a charge for EVERY little thing and we weren&#39;t looking to spend $62 because of a food substitute (side of pancakes instead of potatoes for example) or an extra coffee. The menu is a bit misleading and it was more hassle than it was worth. My boyfriend and I had seen the Summer In Italy French Toast on Egg Harbor&#39;s Yelp profile before we stopped in and were sold immediately. However, when we had spotted it on the menu it was $11 for JUST the french toast...huh? That plan was out. 
If you try making anything a meal (meaning adding bacon/sausage, eggs, etc to your pancakes or french toast) they give you a smaller portion of the pancakes, french toast, etc. So if I want more of one food I get a smaller portion of another...alright. A majority of the questions we had asked either had a long explanation or had to be answered by a manager which was a little annoying. (Keep in mind they were only questions about substituting sides, what meals came with, etc.).

I must say, the food was definitely tasty. I got my first Egg&#39;s Benedict and I would certainly be back for it again. Our food was hot, served neatly and our waiter was very accommodating throughout our visit. My meal (Egg&#39;s Benedict with a side of potatoes) was filling and was just enough for me personally. Being that I had never had an Egg&#39;s Benedict before I didn&#39;t have much to compare it to but I enjoyed myself. I figured since I like English muffins, Canadian bacon and any type of egg all of it together with hollandaise sauce poured over it would be A-OK with me.

One thing I love about Egg Harbor is how much they sell themselves with their merchandise. The bowls, mugs and other items engraved with the logo are really neat and are all for sale when you walk in. 

All in all, I would visit Egg Harbor again for sure. It was very clean, they had plenty of menu options for everyone (just watch out for those hidden charges and meal changes) and the food was definitely worth it.",31/05/16,284,3,2,5,26,4.2363,2.487,0.629,21.884999999999998,No,2689

My wife got the granola pancake special, also with scrambled eggs and sausage.  And I got the cinnamon role french toast combo, again with eggs over hard &amp; sausage.

I could eat breakfast for lunch and dinner, so I think it is bordering on obsession. Where do I take care of such hunger pangs? If in Schaumburg, this would be the breakfast spot.

We lived in Schaumburg not too long ago, and we still like to frequent the neighborhood. I heard that this place opened right by Woodfield, and I was pumped. Like the other Egg Harbor Caf locations, expect a lot of people on weekends. They get you seated fairly quickly, and trust me it is well worth the wait. 

We rolled in on a Sunday, at around 10:30am, and I thought the wait would be close to an hour.  I was told it would be 15-20 minutes, and indeed it was. We were seated and I already knew what I wanted. I ordered the Meaty skillet, and true to the name...it was meat-tastic!

As for food - it was really good.  I had the Geneva Rosti - a Swiss traditional of eggs, bacon, onions, potatoes all baked together.  It was served with sour cream and a side of fruit and an English muffin (with I believe homemade jelly).  I really loved my dish and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try something a little different for breakfast.

My husband had some sort of Santa Fe scrambler/skillet with jalapenos and peppers and onions that he also really liked.  The others around the table also had different skillets or pancakes and everyone liked their dish.

Not too hungry, I chose &#39;Cassie&#39;s Crpes&#39; for my meal. These were wonderful.  Normally, you could expect a crepe to be either sweet or savory, yet these were right in the middle and quite delicious. Try them, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re in to.

It isn&#39;t just a brunch place filled with extremely sweet and dessert type breakfast options and maybe some eggs. There is quite the variety - I got the protein wrap, and it was quite delicious.

Came here on a Sunday morning around 10am with a party of 6 and the place was packed. Parking was a bit difficult, but hey, sometimes that&#39;s the price you pay. Note: similar to Wildberry, no reservations permitted. 

Now on to the grub... I ordered the traditional breakfast of eggs, chicken sausage, cheese grits, and an english muffin. Pretty tasty, even though the cheese grits were not actually cheesy. I grew up on (and still make) cheese grits that were actually yellow from the cheddar cheese...these were creamy white with flecks of yellow. But that&#39;s just a personal  preference, they were still good. The chicken sausage was just as I remembered, delicious.

What an amazing new brunch restaurant. I really want to go to wild berry but my sister-in-law insisted that we try this new breakfast restaurant. We were lucky because he went on December 28 which was their 30th anniversary. They had a variety of special deals that were was only one for one day. Intelligentsia coffee was only $.60 it came in a nice thermos kept it hot throughout the meal. In addition I was able to get two different entres. One was the Shauna sun-up which was yogurt with granola and strawberries and bananas. This was likely the best yogurt parfait I ever had. I didn&#39;t get a chance to try the homemade banana bread which is included with this entre. I also tried the meggsican frittata. This included eggs chorizo onions and melted cheese which was topped with sour cream and tomatoes. Although I didn&#39;t really care from a flour tortilla the rest of it was quite delicious. For the price of 4.95 that day it was quite a deal. The normal price is a low bit more than that for each of those. The server was quite friendly and she came in to check to make sure that our meal was okay. I&#39;ll be the definately come back for breakfast some other time.

Pros: Friendly service, inexpensive brunch, well lit restaurant

Cons: Very small parking lot and slightly long wait times

Not bad for 10am on Sunday however I couldnt believe we would be sat in under 30 mins. We waited outside bc it was sunny out and they have these great heated lamps to stand near when cold - perfect thoughtful touch!

We were called for our table only 13mins later! Whaaaat?? How? Well we sat and we immediately greeted and asked for a drink order. They have water available before you sit and everyone is extremely friendly. We spoke with three waitresses ensuring our visit was going well...but we only had one server. Amazing! They genuinely cared and it was so nice to see teamwork like this. 

We ordered and our food tool maybe 10 mins tops and it was served to order (bc we are annoying and went back and forth on what we wanted)

My kids were so excited about the menu they couldn&#39;t maket up their mind! Adorable. One ordered Green Eggs and Ham bc she couldn&#39;t believe that was a realy thing!! ;-) lol and the other ordered the rainbow pancakes - which even I thought was delish.

The food was great. The service was absolutely fantastic.  The hosts were all so friendly. Probably the friendliest compared to other famous breakfast places in Schaumburg and I loved that.

The girls at the counter made sure everything was alright. 
Only thing different I found from other similar places  was that they offer English muffin with everything instead of the usual pancakes.  This is no big deal as I requested pancakes instead and they had no problem. 

Got the pancakes to go but syrup was missing. ...but hey everyone can make a small mistake like that.....not a big deal.",15/10/15,80,5,2,3,20,2.8522000000000003,2.732,0.8240000000000001,6.444,No,702

egg-harbor-cafe-schaumburg-2,Nancy H.,VHJwN7q1vzTuIKCPbk-2tw,0txNX7T_xIZe_K2DNtI-3Q,"So, I took my staff out to breakfast for having a great month.  The place was bright, clean and open.  I thought this could be a new regular breakfast place but it does not come close to Wildberry.  The tea was made with fresh leaves which was pretty cool.  Menu had a great selection and the server was nice.  Now you&#39;re asking why is this review only one star?  

It is one star for all of the above.  I did not know that my poached eggs came with hair.  Imagine picking up your fork for the second bite and there is an embedded coarse grey hair hanging from the warm, runny yolk. Rodent Hair?  Yep - there was the gag reflex going off.  

The 20-Something Manager came over and did the scripted apology and added that this had been a recurring problem over the past two weeks and they were working on it!!!!  Who volunteers that information???  My staff all looked at each other and we were pretty much done eating - who wouldn&#39;t be?  

He said he would &#34;take care of the bill&#34;.  We flagged the server over and she dropped off the bill?  What!  Yes - the bill...  My hairy poached eggs were removed.  Child manager comes back and says that he meant &#34;taking care of the bill&#34; just meant my portion.  Even though my staff challenged him.  

That is why this scary place to eat is a &#34;one star&#34; rating.   One hair means there are many and I will never eat there again. I guess they are still too new to provide hair nets for their staff and rodent traps.",30/04/16,166,1,1,4,1,3.7248,3.046,0.82,19.134,No,1485

Im very pick when it comes to good breakfast, I won&#39;t go back to a place if something is sub par. I&#39;ll def be coming back here!

I ordered the traditional combo, and upgraded to the candied bacon (super worth it), eggs were cooked perfectly (over easy)
I would give the pancakes a 7/10 which is a lot from me, I&#39;m a  pancake snob and most places have bland pancakes or don&#39;t satisfy me fully, these got close haha
These weere a lot less bland than morst other places but if they played with the recipe a little they could probably have something legendary.
That is literally the only thing I have to say about this place that isn&#39;t exceptional!

If it is a regular night, it might be ok, not sure since I went on a holiday.  If the food was the same minus the crab legs, I would say it&#39;s ok to go. If the food is totally different on a regular night I would say don&#39;t go.

I liked that they had some dim sum, the shrimp ones were great the first time I had them and super salty the second time.

There is Orange Juice next to the Coke Free Style Machine (The one that lets you mix and match coke products), it&#39;s a bit hard to see the label so look for it in a big black dispenser.

Pork Chops were so dry we couldn&#39;t cut it with a knife, even the steak knife we got didn&#39;t work. 

I did enjoy the risotto though, creamy and decently flavorful. 

The salad bar was a good thought in making exciting salads but poorly executed since they weren&#39;t that good and there aren&#39;t a lot of individual ingredients I could use to customize things.

The roast beef is pretty cooked, I prefer things pink or red so I didn&#39;t enjoy that much.

The deserts are ok.

They also have this 90 minute eating time limit but it took 15 minutes to seat us.  They ended up not enforcing it as far as i could tell since people that came before us stayed until about the time we left and we left like 30 minutes after the 90 minutes so maybe they only enforce it when they are busy or seeing you chow down on crab legs non stop?

At first, I was skeptical. Let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s in a casino. Buffets are kind of gross. All you can eat is less appealing than ordering something from a menu. 

My dad was insistent we go early and apparently arriving at 4:10pm wasn&#39;t early enough. The line was relatively long but understandable. People eat like they haven&#39;t been fed for days. 

I started with the salad bar. It is standard, modest and fresh. My timing to grab crab legs was perfect. First in line while a new batch arrived. I stuck out 2 plates and the worker bee hesitated. Based upon her expression, she was disgusted with me. 

I was worried I wouldn&#39;t get my monies worth if I paid $30 for the same experience. It turns out, the amount of crab legs I indulged upon is far less expensive than dining out at any seafood restaurant.

I will say that the presentation of the food looks great and I was able to find a few things I liked.   Best items for me were the mashed potatoes and the crusted chicken.   Oddly enough my favorite food item there were the cookies.   For me they tasted extra fresh.

Unfortunately since their reopening I feel like their food quality has gone down.   My last two visits in particular was disappointing.   The prime rib tasted rubbery, rice overcooked.    To top it off on my last visit there were a bunch of fruit flies buzzing all over the desserts.    Total turn off.

Pro: Dcor is nice

Con: Terrible food 
         Cheap poor quality food made to look pretty

I actually paid to go there. Most people are free diners from casino points.
Even for free food most people left after the first plate with full plates.

1) Desserts stale and over sweetened

2) Brazilian station: Over salted poor quality meat

3) Chinese Station: bitter cheap vegetables cooked to  your spec in a stir fry.
    They use the low grade rice that even the cheapest of the Chinese restaurants won&#39;t use.

4) Mediterranean and Italian: I don&#39;t know where to start but Salad in a glass? I could just imagine a senior or a child breaking one of these.

Pizza: was fair, maybe the only thing you can eat here.

All meats and chicken very poor  quality.

Maybe if you are drunk and like bad seafood this will work for you. More of the seafood lovers come out on a Friday and hoard up all the smelly crab legs and foul smelling fish.

I say if you are going to eat there and you really want to eat your whole meal, its probably better to dine at the Prime Burger place.

I haven&#39;t tried the steakhouse yet, but, I&#39;m hesitant.

Its all poor quality cheap food. They could have saved the money on the dcor and bought better quality food.

It&#39;s not the food preparers fault when they don&#39;t give them much to work with,",25/06/13,173,1,1,0,-88,-0.18689999999999984,1.687,2.007,14.306000000000003,No,1481

indulge-buffet-elgin,Marc G.,01ZuGYsCfVXY_ZJw5R3B4Q,xTBv-fPFRqdtWneXw9DlCA,"I really want to like this place and I will try it again, hoping to give it another star or two...but I&#39;m suspicious. I recall the previous version of this place, which slowly got crusty around the edges. Not just the decor, but also the food started out good, but over the years got tired and vaguely industrial.

This new version was pretty decent the first two times I went, although the service was really spotty. Staff was newish so could be forgiven for having trouble collecting plates and renewing silverware.

But tonight....well, everything was slightly tired, old and crusted over. And the place was damn near empty, so it wasn&#39;t an issue of too many people. It was just a slow night. So food sat out longer which means, INDULGE...you have a MANAGEMENT PROBLEM. Whoever is pacing the kitchen and presentation of food needs a talking to. If you&#39;re not careful, this place will go straight back to nasty food for a captive audience in a casino pavilion. And that would be a shame. They&#39;re capable of more.

So on to tonight&#39;s problems. Brisket very over cooked, or nearly raw. Nothing in between burnt and bleeding. BBQ sauce sour...like it has been spoiled a bit, or maybe way too much vinegar. But not nice. Ribs...cooked ok, maybe overdone a bit, but not too bad....but drenched in that same sour tasting sauce. Sweet or spicy sauce would be ok. But very sour tastes at a buffet make you worry that you&#39;re eating spoiled food. 

Sopes (a mexican delight) had been sitting out long enough to get hard and pasty, not even warm. The salsas changed colors when I stirred them which means no one is attending to them to keep them fresh. Very dingy till you stir in the crust and freshen. Ick. 

Fried chicken not back but a bit dry. Ok, that&#39;s hard to avoid, but the best way would be to fill the pans a little at a time, pacing the kitchen, rather than filling it to the gills for a crowd that is not there and then letting it sit there and dry out. Steaks...about the same quality as Golden Corral. Meh. Be ready to chew. A lot. The Brazlian Steakhouse bits and pieces were burned, the station was unmanned and was very unappetizing tonight.

On the plus side the lobster mac and cheese was fresh and had big hunks of lobster in it. Better than I expected!

Desserts...chocolate mousse was dingy and had oxidized a skin like coating over it. Chocolate cheesecake tasted like cardboard. On the plus side, the gelato was really nice, presented well, but it&#39;s hard to ruin ice cream.

Indulge...please for the love of all that is holy, get your management act in order and make this place a destination worth of lines. I&#39;ll try again and attempt to give you more stars. We in Elgin really need you to do this right. BE the only not-crusty Buffet in our food wasteland. Live up to your potential. 

Please.

But, if you&#39;re not a Gold or Silver club member, be prepared to wait 2 hrs for the seafood buffet because the high rollers get &#34;preferred seating&#34;. That means that you will stand there watching the high rollers get seated while the management tells you they are full. They won&#39;t care if you give up and leave the line because the high rollers spend way more money than your meal costs. The manager tonight actually said that to the lady complaining to him tonight. Apparently a couple large high roller groups came in and us nobodies were standing there just waiting for them to be seated. In the meantime, they sat the other high rollers that came up. The lady and her husband complained to the girl at the register who called the manager. The manager came up and approved them to seat some of us in the other line while they waited to be able to sit the large groups. The lady suggested that they alternate the two lines. The manager told her that wasn&#39;t going to happen because they had preferred seating and came very close to saying that the rest of us didn&#39;t matter.

With it being a holiday weekend I was really expecting this buffet to be hopping it wasn&#39;t... The decor here is very nice. It has a nice trendy upscale feeling. When we entered I was really expecting Vegas style food because the decor was fab. The service however is my first point of complaint. At one point one of the people I was eating with actually got up and handed the dirty dishes to one of the many buss boys that were just standing around talking. We also used the table next to us for dirty plates because they rarely came around to take our dirty plates away. The place was pretty empty with plenty of people standing around there was no reason for this to happen. The food was very hit or miss. Many of the items on the buffet were old and you can tell they were sitting around for a long time (The cheddar cheese soup and New York strip steaks were two examples) . Other items were very good. I really enjoyed the Garlic breadstix and pizza. The cheese selection was also very good and they kept it stocked. I also really liked the shrimp risotto. The risotto was very cheesy and the shrimp were high quality. I enjoyed the Desserts however think they should give you a bigger scoop of the Gelatto. I went back a few times because the scoop was so small. They were however very good about giving multiple scoops on request. Will give another try hoping the problems we had were just a off night. Would easly be 4 or 5 stars if the food was fresh and the if  the dirty plates were taken away faster.,03/09/13,173,2,2,4,38,3.8909000000000002,3.845,1.227,14.929000000000002,No,1579

As far as the food goes, I have never been so disappointed.  I literally could have gotten a better meal at the Old Country Buffet.

A quarter of the spots were out of food and a lot of things were mislabeled or not labeled well.  The salad bar is a joke!  There were exactly three items you could put on your lettuce: cucumbers, eggs and anemic tomatoes.  All exaggeration aside, the number of salad dressings far exceeded the number of salad toppings.

Additionally, there&#39;s something wrong with the buffet line&#39;s setup; I had to wait so long in line just to get to the potatoes, that my meat had completely cooled off.  My husband had finished eating his entire plate before I even sat down with him.

An unmotivated manager cannot lead hourly workers to greatness.

The turnover with the staff is incredible and I&#39;m sure results in the awful customer service and terrible customer service because everyone is always in training mode. But this location isn&#39;t even doing the basics: getting orders correct, refills, making sure the food is served at correct temperature, or even checking on the table a few times while they are there. It&#39;s disappointing, because the food is actually good it&#39;s the staff that&#39;s terrible. 
I swore I would never go back to this location but my boyfriend and I received a gift card as a gift and it&#39;s the only location close to us- we hadn&#39;t been in months so I broke down and agreed to go because my boyfriend loves the chili con queso, and again it was more than disappointing and again, I am swearing off Red Robin. Thanks for us losing $40+ on a meal when it was awful and couldn&#39;t get the servers attention for the life of us to correct it. South Elgin Red Robin needs some serious help! On a positive I have been to other great Red Robin&#39;s- oswego being one- and it&#39;s a completely different experience.

This was the first time I&#39;d ever been to a Red Robin, and I was given three choices of temperatures of meat and picked &#34;pink with pink juice&#34; (the most rare) as did my one friend. After waiting an inordinate amount of time on a Tuesday night, we received our obviously well done burgers. Again, for $10+ for a burger, I should be getting what I&#39;m asking for here, especially at a burger place. When we told the server she was extremely apologetic and nice. As we were about to leave she asked if the manager had come around and we said no and she said he said he was going to and to hold on (I guess the slowness in the kitchen and his urgency matched that night). When he got around to talking to us he was condescending and dismissive, walking away mid sentence. I think he should take a page from the servers books of how to deal with customers- she acted more like a manager than he did.

It saddens me to see the staff here running around and being overworked. They are SO kind but run from thing to thing and are doing so many things at once-- cleaning tables, hosting, helping other tables, running food, cleaning. I don&#39;t know much about the management but it seems short staffed and that must be stressful for the loyal servers there. :/

To the reviews who complain about management or service -- these people work their butts off.

Our pretzel bites apparently were overcooked of which we were so hungry that it eluded us. But the Manager came over and comped us because of it.

What&#39;s normally a quick and attentive service was somewhat slow and more relaxed than pervious visits. Having been to this location several times, I have come to expect a cheerful, efficient server. Immediately I noticed that while he was friendly, that next level of personable service was missing. To his credit, tables with small kids he did well talking to them and making them feel welcome. He did an alright job, however, bottomless speckled lemonade was only refilled once (despite being emptied). I did notice he seemed to be the only waiter for what seemed like quite a few tables given it was dinner time on a weekend. And about our napkins: we literally had to ask him for individual napkins after the place setting ones were soiled. He mentioned corporate was really watching what they spent?? Not sure what to make of that. The food was alright in preparation. One very positive note: any of their fries are delicious! Garlic, steak and sweet potato all were really enjoyed!

Another mark on an otherwise pleasant experience was realizing that for all that non-service I received, I still had to pay. Overpriced I felt, given the level of service and mediocrity of the food we received.

Atmosphere:
Typical Red Robin decor. You have been to one, you have been to all of them. I actually really do enjoy their theme. Lots of knick knacks and interesting things to observe. My favorite was the George Costanza painting with him on the couch. Yes, the painting of George from that episode! One thing that really turned a few us off was that the tables were kind of stick and that the Silverware wasn&#39;t fully clean. Most of us were eating burgers, but Red Robin really needs to check their silverware before putting them out there. There was more than one set that wasn&#39;t fully clean. 


Food:
That particular Friday night wasn&#39;t super busy, but I felt that the food was below Red Robin standards. My friend ordered sweet potato fries and they were cold! Also one thing I look forward to every time I go to Red Robin is their Freckled Lemonade. I received Lemonade with barely any of the Strawberry flavored fusion that I craved. At least I got my burger made just right. Fry service was lackluster at this location. They give you smaller portions and sometimes they aren&#39;t fresh.

Service:
We did not expect to be at that particular location for almost 3 hours, but that is what ended up happening. We spent over an hour waiting for our food, and it took another 25 minutes to get our bill. We ended up missing our Thor 2 movie time because of the amount of time it took to get service. We had to wait another hour for the next showtime...  We asked for a round of fries to hold us over, but no fries came until our burgers came. This service continued on with lackluster beverage service. This was also the first Red Robin waitress I have had that wasn&#39;t friendly. The service wasted a lot of our time that could have been spent on celebrating the Birthday girl&#39;s night.

My own imposed rules for any Chain Restaurant review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Since the food should be the same everywhere, with the exception of regional items, the food category will only be judged on the quality of the expected food (i.e. temperature, consistency, and amount).
3. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Red Robin - South Elgin

Location/Layout - 6/10:  Red Robin can be found on Randall Rd in South Elgin, directly in front of the Home Depot.  Parking is ample and shared with adjacent businesses.  The interior has the standard Red Robin motif, which borders on kid friendly with giant robin statues and arcade games but also incorporates the standard chain restaurant flair design.  The interior is very spacious and offers several different seating styles including two seat booths, high and low tables, and booth/table combos.  The eating area is typically neatly kept but will occasionally have balloons floating around.  The bar area is knee walled off from the main dining room and offers a respite for those looking to get a break from all the kids running around, while giving greater access to the televised events.  As noted, there are TVs throughout, with the majority (still only 4) found in the bar area.  Unfortunately, they are between 19 and 22 inches and unless you are directly under one of the TVs they are almost useless at that size.  Although, they still offer the TV in the floor in the waiting area, which is a very cool touch, but the Plexiglas is starting to get hazed and scratched making it hard to view the image.  .         

Service - 5/10: Service is varied and fairly solid.  The only issue is that while all the servers are very attentive when taking your order and immediately after the food is served there are dead times between placing the order and having the food delivered or after your food has been verified alright where you end up on an island with no assistance.  I would like to see check ins because the food does take some time to be delivered and there are needs such as refills and questions about bar drinks or dessert that get missed for quite some time.    

Food - 6/10: By definition the offerings are upscale burgers and American fare, after all they refer to themselves as Red Robin &#34;Gourmet &#34; Burgers.  The food at this location is usually hot and usually very freshly prepared.  Because our groups orders vary we have noticed temperature issues, presumably because one order is waiting while the other is being finished.  Also, we have had a lot of occasions where something was incorrect or missing from our food.  The issue is always fixed once we are able to get the attention of our server.  The menu focuses on burgers mainly with a nice selection of other sandwiches and a hand full of apps, salads, and entrees.  In general this is more upscale quick service and is prepared on demand with unique toppings and variations.  The burgers and sandwiches are served in plastic boats with a liner and wrapped in the same liner.  This presentation does not live up to the &#34;gourmet&#34; theme and the wrappers always seem to disintegrate or melt with all the fat and juices that come off the sandwiches and fries.  A note about the fries, they are steak cut and seasoned with their house seasoning but more importantly for fry lovers, they are endless.  You can also choose from a short list of other options instead of fries for those that prefer a change.  Menu pricing overall is slightly high on average for burgers and entrees.  On the other hand, the apps and desserts can be very costly especially for the amount of food; although, they do have weekday deals on apps which are very reasonable.  Lastly, they do have a full bar with liquor and a fairly solid list of beer options.

Most of the staff is flustered and undertrained. The management there is nowhere to be found when needed and ticket times average between 18-30min when they are supposed to be 7-10min. Most of the bartenders are kind and prompt. 

The other thing that gets me about this red robin is I&#39;ve sat at the bar and looked around the restaurant and seen tables stay dirty for over an hour after people leave. How sanitary can that be.... Meanwhile I see a guy sitting at a table in a button up on his phone (assuming its the &#34;manager&#34;).

Staff - friendly, but not on the ball. They were too interested in leaving to care much about the customers. The male servers were too busy flirting with the female servers.

Food - The should remove &#34;Gourmet&#34; from the Gourmet Burgers. They are definitely not gourmet according to the standard definition. We both ordered medium well. Mine didn&#39;t come with the toppings I ordered. My wife&#39;s was half cooked. There were parts of raw meat in her burger. She ended up throwing most of her burger a way. The fries were overcooked, cold, and over seasoned.

Price - Not very competitive. I could go a few blocks down the road to a very nice Mexican restaurant and get an elaborate, high quality meal for the same price.

We left unsatisfied and the server didn&#39;t even offer us money off the bill for my wife&#39;s half finished burger. We will emphatically not be returning to this restaurant ever again!

There are some interesting items on the menu here and although the place is small and lacking in ambiance it certainly lacks no character.  You may find yourself out of place if you do not speak Spanish as very little English is spoken here if any.  

The food is always well seasoned and very reasonably priced.  One of my favorite dishes is called Corundas.  It consists of Tamale dumplings with a chile braised pork and topped with Mexican crema.  It is unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had but I would compare it to an inside-out tamale.  The taco&#39;s are made with regular corn tortillas and the variety is good as should be expected.  On weekends you can find Menudo which is a treat.  My wife usually gets the chicharron burrito which I find to be outstandingly delicious but I worry about the fat content - it is not for the faint of heart.

Don&#39;t go here expecting a fine dining experience.  It is a classic taqueria with very good menu options including Tortas, Burritos, and Enchiladas.

Will add more later. I got it so wrong on the ground chicken with spicy basil leaves. And the Tom Kha soup is not only done exceptionally well, but with all really good soups, it also has its own personal distinct taste per recipe from chef.

I had known about Somsri for quite a while, and being a frequent Thai diner (Thipi in GE, Pad Thai Etc. in Wheaton), I knew that Somsri warranted a try, because variety is the spice of life.

I can&#39;t say anything about the actual restaurant because my roommate (mom) picked up my order at about 815 on a Thursday night. It took 10 minutes from call to pickup. Very fast!

I ordered Tom Yum Pork (a small bowl for 4.99) and the Pad Thai Chicken (8.99). The bowl of soup is a very good size. Same with the Pad Thai dish!

As for the soup, very yummy. Not the best tom yum I&#39;ve ever had, but certainly better than other ones I&#39;ve had. Lots of fresh veggies, and surprisingly, lots of pork! A lot of Thai places skimp on protein, but not here!

The Pad Thai chicken was excellent as well. Plenty of veggies and chicken! Seasoned well too; not sure what type of seasoning they used, but it was good enough that I licked the to go pan it came in. On the savory to sweet scale, I would say it was more towards the sweet side. Not too sweet, but very good.

Somsri is very good, and it&#39;s fairly priced. It&#39;s nice to have another Thai option in the area. My favorite Thai of all time remains Thara Thai in Champaign, Illinois, but Somsri has a chance to become my favorite in the suburbs.One of the easiest barometers to use while judging a restaurant is if I will return.

Strike #1-- it came with rice, no noodles. WTF?! 
Strike #2-- some of the chicken was undercooked. I ended up microwaving it.
Strike #3-- the vegetables were undercooked. It seemed like they just threw them in the sauce without cooking them. Yuck.

Since I am not a total monster, the plus side of my experience was that the curry sauce was tasty, the owner/cook guy was friendly, and it was pretty inexpensive. Sadly though, that will not be enough for me to give this place another shot. Total bummer, as I was really looking forward to some good Thai food close to home. Epic fail.

More accurately, I would say that it&#39;s 4.5 stars.

The food was outstanding and the owners/servers are friendly. It&#39;s small. The parking is plentiful. Also, if one were daring enough to make a trek from the Emerald City, Chicago, this restaurant is within SUPER easy walking distance of the Winfield Metra (UP-West Line) stop. Just cross under the tracks.

I found that there was simply not enough servers on to meet the demands of this place, hence, less than five stars.

The bathrooms were OK, which helps the overall impression that I got.

On a side note, it appears that Somsri takes up at least part of the space that the now (and fortunately) defunct Winfield House restaurant utilized many years ago.

I highly recommend Somsri.

For those of you unfamiliar with Winfield, it&#39;s just west of Wheaton, along the Roosevelt Road (Illinois Route 38) corridor.  Somsri is just south of the tracks.",03/08/13,132,4,1,3,-1,2.7093000000000003,1.801,0.06,13.139000000000001,No,1057

The only thing I would recommend to others is unless you want your food EXTREMELY spicy, order everything mild. We ordered medium spicy but it was slightly too spicy.

The owner was there and was very friendly and inviting.

Now for the food...I had the Green Chicken Curry.  It was wonderful.  This has always been my favorite Thai dish and I tend to judge Thai restaurants by this dish.  This dish was the real deal.  Just the right amount of veggies, chicken, coconut milk, and curry.  I loved it.

Tonight I called and placed our first order.  My husband actually picked up the food, so I can not comment on the interior - but I will tell you that the man who took the order via telephone was very kind and polite and expressed his appreciation.  When my husband picked up the food he asked that we let him know how it was and how he was doing, and he threw in an order of crab rangoon.  As someone who is BIG on customer service I really thought it was great that he so sincerely wanted feedback.  Well I&#39;m so glad to say that it was FABULOUS.  Glad because we now have more delicious ethnic food in Winfield, and glad because I can give great feedback to someone so lovely.

I dove into the crab rangoon first, which was done really, really well.  Instead of the oversized &#34;too much wonton too little crab/cream&#34;, these were bite sized pieces with a delicious crab/creme filling that was really exceptional.  Their sweet and sour was also great and didn&#39;t have that artificial sweetness like so many others.  Really delicious.

We also ordered the Panang Curry with Chicken and Pad Thai with Tofu.  The Panang was mouth watering and had a beautiful color and consistency and the spices were just right.  The chicken was great and we both loved the dish.  Pad Thai is one of those things I&#39;ll always order first from a Thai place I&#39;ve never been to.  Its such a staple that if it isn&#39;t right I just won&#39;t go back.  Fortunately, it was perfect.  I always like a little lime wedge with mine, but it didn&#39;t come with one.  Oh well, not a big deal at all.  I&#39;m not even sure that&#39;s a &#34;standard&#34; thing, anyway. We also had the spring rolls.  These were your basic spring rolls, and they were very nice.

This place is a class act. They had an awesome craft bourbon (only one - my only complaint) and a great array of wines by the glass.

The restaurant was full of diverse groups and even other children. It&#39;s kind of loud in general -- but not in an obnoxious way at all. They even provide a kids menu for the little ones.
 
      Heidi was our server. What a doll. Interacted with my kids, knew the menu, and was super informative. She never got an order wrong. We started with their special drink the cucumber sangria. Super summery feeling and fresh. Their alcohol selection in general was great. They can make pretty much anything you ask for. The table shared Zucchini Fries. They weren&#39;t greasy -- my kid thought they were French fries and ate them. The table tried everything from pastas, pizzas, calzones. It was all very large and VERY scrumptious! Everything tasted fresh too. We all agreed that their pizza dough was out of this world. Vodka sauce was done incredibly well. 

      We tried a ton of desserts. Gelato (offered in a ton of flavors), their Italian doughnuts offered with chocolate sauce for dipping, flourless chocolate cake that came with berry compote and a scoop of vanilla gelato, Nutella calzone which was huge!!! But it probably was the best dessert we had there. Nothing disappointed! 

       Thank you Fire + Wine for this lovely night out. Thank you Heidi for being so gracious -- you do a fantastic job and work incredibly hard! Props!  

       I recommend this place! It has something for everyone and if you are in the area -- definitely stop by. Don&#39;t skip the dessert!",23/03/16,261,5,3,5,59,9.8411,7.445,1.0110000000000001,29.546000000000003,No,2356

My party of 5 was seated in a long table, our server was Heidi. She was very helpful with our group providing assitance on what to order and were very happy with her recommendations. Our party was very impressed with the food and the restaurant. 

We ordered a pizza with sausage and basil, ricotta and honeycomb spread with bread as an appetizer.

This review is overdue, as I went here for my birthday a couple of months back, but I&#39;m still thinking about the meal I had. I consider myself kind of a foodie, and I&#39;ve been to quite a number of restaurants with my fellow foodie boyfriend, and we had one of the best meals we&#39;ve ever had anywhere. Amazing arancini, perfectly cooked pork belly, and a butternut squash tortelloni with braised short rib that is possibly one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. Holy YUM. The service has been phenomenal every time we&#39;ve gone here, they even managed to squeeze us in when my reservation was somehow lost last Valentine&#39;s Day when the place was jam packed! The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food. Appetizers, dinner, and a bottle of wine have been under $100 each time, and I have left there happier than when I&#39;ve left some restaurants where I&#39;ve paid double that. 

My only wish is that I lived a bit closer, but I&#39;d probably be in trouble if I did! I&#39;m lucky I&#39;m able to hop the Metra and take a jaunt on over whenever I feel like a fun date night, though.

While at the Taste of Glen Ellyn&#34; and seeing the absolutely abominable food choices they were offering (very sad) at the fest, just could not see eating anything the fest had to offer.

We happened to be strolling by Fire + Wine and decided now was the time to check it out.

Kind of crowded, kind of noisy, but I&#39;m OK with that.
Had their octopus small plate, house salad, and also a pizza with pancetta and arugula.
House salad was nice and fresh and interesting which is always a good start.
The octopus was fantastic. Grilled just perfectly and came with arugula, roasted potato slices, grape tomatoes and a sauce that had some heat and zip to it which encircled the plate.
We loved it. Was debating about placing another order of it but since our pizza was on it&#39;s way decided against it because it would be too much to eat.
The pizza was a wood burning type which had a nice crust and a good balance of toppings. I liked how the pancetta was crispy and in nice sized slices instead of how some places crumble it up. The bottom of the crust was a bit scorched but was still tasty so we ate it all.

Service was efficient and friendly. When the waiter checked up on us we told him about the crust and he was apologetic and said they could make a new one but it was not needed by us.

I am definitely going back here because they had quite a few menu items that I would like to try.
I am definitely going to get the octopus again because it was just great. If you like grilled octopus and like a little bit of heat with it, you have to try it.

Grilled romaine is always a favorite. And it was especially good tonight. We&#39;ve tried to make it at home and can&#39;t quite duplicate the deliciousness. 

Pancetta and arugula pizza was amazing. We&#39;ve had this at a variety of place and F+W is the winner. Crispy pancetta. Fresh arugula. And the surprising addition of cherry tomatoes for a touch of sweet. 

I also enjoyed my wine, the Franciscan Chardonnay in a generous pour.

Sadly the hour and a half wait-which we were fine with, turned into over 2 hours. I believe this was largely in part to an inexperienced manager running the hostess station. As I waited several groups walked with the same dilemma. All that I bragged about to our friends, your delicious mussels, kale salad and pizza was eliminated. Your bartenders are exceptional and took good care of us as always. We ended up leaving after many comments that we would be seated. Your menu is worth the wait-but over 2 hours was unfortunate.

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by two very friendly and energetic girls, they were both very pleasant. We got seated right away. 
The restaurant is nice and cozy, we were seated by the Windows which was nice and bright. The seating on the lower lever, main dining area is dark and romantic looking. 
Our sever, a very nice girl, explained the menu, told us their drink special and the dinner special. She went to get us water and we got to look over the menu. For my drink I went with a raspberry beer that was fantastic. I&#39;m not a wine person, but their wine list is impressive. Their beer selection was not bad either. We ordered the black pepper shrimp appetizer and that was fantastic. It had a spicy hint without being overly hot and it was served over polenta and there were some peppers thrown in the mix. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it very much. For my entree I got the seafood risotto. Scallops, shrimp, and clams in a delicious sauce mixed in with risotto. The server grated fresh Parmesan over it and it melted right in. The dish was very generous with the shrimp and the scallops were a nice size. My boyfriend got the hangar steak served with veggies. His dish was amazing. He ordered the steak medium and it was cooked to perfection and it was even charred a bit. He was blown away and so was I. The steak melted in your mouth. 
I was a fatty and ordered dessert, the flourless chocolate cake served with vanilla bean gelato and whip cream. The cake itself was not bad, a little too rich for my taste but the gelato was wonderful. 
We had a great experience, the food was amazing, the staff was great and the background music was awesome.

Some highlights:
Pancetta + Arugula Pizza 
Pomodoro Pie Pizza
Zucchini Fries
Vodka (when made right)
Italian Doughnuts (great for sharing)

They have some amazing food and are capable of making great dishes which is frustrating when you order and receive a poor dish. My latest experience was a take out, ordered 2 of the same dish and received 2 very different looking dishes (one looked like someone&#39;s leftovers and the other looked like it had all the sauce and no noodles). I figured it would be a good idea to inform the management of this and when I did I was told that they do not make mistakes (paraphrasing) but they&#39;d be willing to &#34;make it right&#34;. When you fail to acknowledge mistakes can be made you have lost me, at that point I lost interest in allowing them to &#34;make it right&#34;.

We were in West Chicago for a meeting and were looking for a new place to try for dinner that wasn&#39;t too far away. Found Fire + Wine on Yelp, and there is a reason why this place has so many 5 star ratings. 

1) Food is amazing. Seriously it is super good. (More on that in a moment)

2) Service is ON POINT. 
Not only was Lauren a rockstar, but the moment we had a dirty dish, it was cleared. Not obtrusive, but people were definitely paying attention.

3) They go out of their way to make you feel important. 
We mentioned it was our first time and Michael, one of the partners stopped by to see how our experience was going a little after the second small plate arrived. It was clear that he actually cared and wanted to ensure we had a great time. We also were torn between ordering the ricotta &amp; honeycomb or the pork belly, and they surprised us with the ricotta anyway so we could try it after we had ordered the pork belly. (Both were amazing) They also had this way of making us feel like every decision we made was the right one. (Michael commented on the bottle of wine we ordered, Lauren + food runners commented on dishes... it was a nice touch. Not manufactured)

Back to the food:
We started with the mussels &amp; crispy pork belly. (And then they brought the ricotta honeycomb anyway) Mussels were tasty but the broth was the star. Pork belly was more like a mini pork filet (not tiny chunks like many serve it), topped with a nice stone fruit compote. But the ricotta &amp; honeycomb... Wow. I can see why they didn&#39;t want us to miss out. I almost licked the plate. 

Then we split the Regina Margherita pizza. Crust was good, liked the buffalo mozz but not huge fans of the cherry tomatoes. Flavor was too tart &amp; they were not super easy to eat. 

Finished off with the panna cotta which was incredible. It had so many layers of flavor--sea salt, balsamic, and creamy vanilla bean. 

We also got the fresh rigatoni + sausage to go, but haven&#39;t had a chance to dive into that yet. If it&#39;s half as good as everything else, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be incredible.

One final thing-- we live about 45 mins away but this won&#39;t deter us from coming as much as possible. Yes, it&#39;s that good.",27/08/15,269,5,2,5,50,5.209199999999999,5.622,1.506,21.872999999999998,No,2251

Been here several times and never had a bad experience with anything. The pasta is delicious and the pizza is very good too. I like that you can choose to do the whole tapas experience or have your own meal. 

When you consider the quality of the food and the serving size, the price is really a bargain. 

The biggest downside is the fact that they don&#39;t take reservations and pretty much from 4:30 on, it can be a bit of a wait. However, you know that this is typically a good sign.

Now I understand the need to visit Kuma&#39;s Corner, Giordano&#39;s, Lou Malnatis, and their similar ilk, but I just needed good, straight-forward dinner for myself and my corporate cohorts. The concierge at the front desk had a folder with all the usual fare that visiting aliens commonly endure, but I pulled her aside and asked for a decent recommendation aside from the Chinese MSG-fiasco or the Olive Garden BS that people resort to for comfort. A note to travelers: You are visiting a new place, try something that isn&#39;t in your area at home. You can have the endless salad at Olive Garden any Wednesday night in your local boring s***-hole of a town.

Anyway... This place is visually and atmospherically a hit when you walk in with a corner-pub-type feel, but with a warmer Italian flair. We were seated immediately, with a very attentive server helping the other people in our group decide where to gastronomically travel next. 

The food was well-done and well presented in a nice display of where their chef/kitchen can do, and the flavor was present to match the visual eye-candy. Even my table mates were commenting on the display and attention to detail that usually isn&#39;t present at this price-point. Being a pescatarian, I usually watch and gauge my reactions from their&#39;s if they order the meats, and those that ordered the meats gave the thumbs-up. My seafood and pasta dishes were as expected, but not the fifth star. The fifth star is reserved for experiences that are 103% beyond your expectations, so don&#39;t let the four star fool you here. It&#39;s worth the minuscule monies paid and the overall experience makes me want to visit the area again. The little town of Glen Ellyn is very quaint, but warm in the same breath.

When we arrived, there were several women at the front hostess station, most of whom were nice and happy to greet is and seat is and one person who seemed a little mean/b*tchy to the rest of the greeters, but ok, whatever, right?

So we sit and have our dinner... A bunch of small plates. Some were very good (the sauce on the pizza, the ricotta and honey, the kale salad, scallops with cauliflower), some were only ok (particularly the desserts (especially the Italian doughnuts were not very good. Too thick, chewy in a kind of leathery kind of way.)). Our server was very nice.

As we wrapped up, one of the other servers bumped into one of the people in our party, getting marinara sauce on his sleeve, and then we had another run in with the not-nice lady from the front, this time in the bathroom. There was one of those &#34;caution/wet floor&#34; signs in front of the bathroom, so I entered carefully. Inside was the woman from the front with another worker. The woman looked at me and said in a really rude way &#34;Didn&#39;t you see the sign?&#34; and opened the door to show me just how stupid I was. I told her that I had seen the sign and it said that the floor was wet not that it was closed. Another front staff person came in at the moment and said that they just needed a moment and that the restroom was closed in a perfectly reasonable manner. Thinking that maybe it was only me, I related the story to the table when I returned and they all had already noted her behavior at the beginning that they knew who I was referring to.

Meatballs. Lord. They&#39;re the good meatballs. The ones with love and meat. Sauce is amazing. 

Mussels were plentiful. I could eat toast points and this broth everyday.

Kale salad for the vegan child. Filled with goodness. She devoured it. 

Quinoa and vegetables. The BF said vegetables shouldn&#39;t taste this good. He never ever eats them. Amazing.

Birthday panna cotta. Ugh. I had no room. I made room. Good. So good.

Service with Heidi with on point. Other servers and bussers were swift and unobtrusive. Seriously amazing.

I was wrong.

We went early and didn&#39;t have to wait long (you can call ahead and get on the list) We actually went with a good attitude, we got there at 5:00 on a Saturday and they said it would be about 1-1.5 hours, we were there, we were committed and we were ready.

They sat us in 15 minutes.

Am I alone in wanting to break out in the James Taylor song &#34;Fire and Rain&#34; every time I hear the name of this place? (I&#39;m doing it now)

So, it&#39;s Italian (in case you didn&#39;t know) The wood fired Pizza&#39;s are good.. but the small plates and meals are the real deal. There were four of us and we ate enough for twice as many.

Don&#39;t judge! We showed restraint.. there were so many things we wanted to try.. we actually had to compromise.

Small plate/ Appetizers.. Grilled Romaine, (winner! who&#39;d have thought?) Bacon wrapped dates, Ricotta Honeycomb, Italian Bean Dip, Fresh Mozzarella, Pepper Shrimp, Prosciutto Pie and more! 

Quick service, reasonable prices.. excellent atmosphere and great food.

fire-wine-glen-ellyn,Caroline M.,CnUzhHxPuJCP_5z2p7gcRg,oa1uB1Do43W0-LbQfcU99g,"I really wanted to like this place. This is the second time we&#39;ve been there. The first time was amazing. There was barely any wait and the pasta was fantastic.  However, we just went last night for my birthday and waited for more time than we actually dined. I know this place is different. You&#39;re supposed to enjoy your meal and it may take 45 minutes to 1 hour to do so. 

Sure, the pasta was still fantastic. I had the vodka pasta both the first time and last night and I was not disappointed. The pasta and pizza bread is AMAZING. The pasta was perfectly al dente. Our waitress, Katherine was very friendly and energetic. The staff at the front were friendly and patient with the people complaining about waiting. The wine selection is great. These are all great things about the restaurant. If not for the waiting, this would definitely have 5 stars.

I have a suggestion about the name of the restaurant; it seems like the name of the restaurant should be changed to &#34;Wine &amp; Waiting&#34;. Because, that is what we did for over an hour. The business of not having reservations is ridiculous. Especially when you have &#34;call aheads&#34; and &#34;walk ins&#34; and &#34;names on lists&#34; and they&#39;re all different, but really they&#39;re all the same.

We called ahead at about 6:30 pm and were told that we would be seated at 7:30 pm. Ok. That&#39;s fine. We were about 30 minutes away at that time and could figure out what to do with an extra 30 minutes. We arrived around 7:05, maybe 7:10 and were told that it was going to be 15-20 minutes &#34;but probably less&#34; past our &#34;call ahead time&#34;. So...7:45 pm to 7:50 pm at the latest. Judging by the amazing pasta last time, I figured we could wait. Turns out there were 3 other groups of 2-3 that were waiting for that time as well. And there were people that were just &#34;walk ins&#34; that were seated before us. Everyone that was a &#34;walk in&#34; was told 45 minutes to an hour &#34;but probably less&#34;. Turns out way less, if you have certain circumstances. 

Circumstances I saw that will get you in faster:
1. Have a baby with you. Complain multiple times that the baby can&#39;t wait til 8:30 to eat, even though you waited until 7:45 to show up for dinner at a restaurant. You will be seated in 10 minutes.

2. Ask if &#34;so &amp; so&#34; is working. If not, ask if someone else is working. Come up with common names like &#34;Anthony&#34; or &#34;Michael&#34;. Turns out they both work there. You will be seated in 10-15 minutes and will have champagne waiting at your table.

3. Tell them it is your anniversary. You will be seated in 10-15 minutes.

***FYI, &#34;It&#39;s my birthday&#34; doesn&#39;t work. Don&#39;t try that one. Even if it is your birthday.

We were finally seated around 8:05 pm. We were greeted by our waitress and she said she would be right out with water. I tried ordering wine before she ran off, but was unsuccessful. Ten minutes later, she came back with water. Does it really take that much time to get water? I feel like they need to hire someone that specifically does water refills. You get a large glass bottle of water, so you won&#39;t run out anytime soon (for 2 people). Putting water down should be part of &#34;setting the table&#34;. She came back, asked for our drink orders, then ran off. It seems like they do have some wait staff that brings out the wine and food, so I&#39;m pretty sure they could handle the water as well. 

Our pizza bread and food was brought out pretty quickly. They were consumed quickly. Halfway through my meal, the waitress asked if the guys who had brought the food had offered parmesan &#34;nope&#34;. She then proceeded to pour it all over my dish (what was left of it), even after I said stop. Meh. More cheese, I guess..I&#39;m not really complaining about that one. We didn&#39;t get dessert, because we were both stuffed. Even though the waitress basically told us about every single dish and was like &#34;are you sure&#34; &#34;are you sure&#34; &#34;are you sure&#34; &#34;take one home for later&#34; &#34;No really, take one home&#34;. No thanks, we don&#39;t want one. (But seriously, the nutella calzone from the previous time was awesome as were the donuts).

It seems like maybe they weren&#39;t prepared for a busy night. Our waitress explained that on chillier nights, they get more people. I get it...it&#39;s cold and you want to stuff your face with pasta. Understandable. But prepare for it and hire more staff!

Also, it&#39;s very LOUD. We nearly had to shout to hear each other. 

Maybe this is just a one time experience (though it was our second time). The first time was great. The waiting is not acceptable. Allowing others to go ahead because of certain circumstances is not acceptable. Maybe if I were on the receiving end of the gold standard service, I would feel different. I really, really wanted to like this restaurant since I have been basically dreaming about the pasta since we last came here about a month ago. Maybe we will try again at 11 am on a Tuesday for a shorter wait and a quieter restaurant.",01/10/15,575,3,2,5,14,12.830899999999998,9.501000000000001,2.95,64.548,No,5124

unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case.
It was a Wednesday night about 6:30.
We called ahead to be put on the wait list as most reviewers suggested.
It was my wife and I.
There were 3 hostesses. 
I hope they are just new.
They acknowledged we called ahead and 
gave us a pager just like everyone else. We stood at the bar. Two minutes later they offered us a high top table. I explained that due to double knee replacement surgery my wife couldn&#39;t sit in the high chairs. The girl that seemed more in control then offered a table in the bar area that she described as 
&#34;More private&#34; it was also a high top table 
on the path to the kitchen and where all the servers picked up their drinks from the bar.
High top and not private.?
We went back to the bar and waited for 
a table at a normal height.
So much for calling ahead.

We like reisling  wine. They offered one reisling. Made our choice easier but come on! What&#39;s your restaurant&#39;s name?
 
Our pager went off!
No the table is  not ready, just checking to make sure a low table is ok- really? Now we&#39;re referring to the group of hostesses as the three stooges.

Yes ,we did finally get a table. Next to the screaming kids and family.

fire-wine-glen-ellyn,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,BJjIyBG8UIe40nHHGG8OhA,"Fire + Wine gets a lot of attention in Glen Ellyn these days, and it&#39;s well deserved. We ordered quite a few things off their menu, and *every* single thing I tasted was the best of its kind.

We started off with the arancini (and a Vanilla Porter for me, which was quite good thank you very much). As far as we could tell it was half real risotto and real mozzarella on the inside, with two different elements of crunchiness on the outside; the batter, and a smattering of thin, crunchy onion rings. There were six in total, and they don&#39;t get any better than this.

Just as we got done with the arancini, our pizzas came out. My wife got the prosciutto pie, and all I really managed to eat of it was a piece of prosciutto (absolutely marvelous) and an olive (mellowed, but still very flavorful). I was torn between artichoke and pesto, and the bianco; on recommendation from the server, I picked the artichoke and pesto and was rewarded with pleasantly bitter arugula, buttery artichoke and fresh pesto.

In both cases the crust was perfect. Flavorful, soft on the inside but with the perfect amount of chew. Top quality fresh ingredients all around, too.

For dessert we decided to get a butterscotch budino, but were also given a panna cotta, and I didn&#39;t argue. The panna cotta was creamy and slightly tangy, melding well with a whole blackberry and sauce on top. The budino was out-of-this-world excellent; thick, creamy, rich. Save room for dessert here, folks.

I have no doubts that we&#39;ll be back here again, for the best pizza we&#39;ve had since we came back from Naples.",27/02/15,191,5,3,5,84,5.7424,3.4839999999999995,0.5910000000000001,11.924999999999999,No,1598

Service was overly prompt and appropriately friendly. We came early in the day, so no dinner rush delays. Pizza and ricotta honeycomb out within about 5 minutes of ordering.

We got a few more pieces of bread so that we could properly finish off all of the spread.  

Pizza was cooked all the way thru, but not very hot in the middle. Still amazing, but another 30 seconds in the oven would have made it absolutely perfect. 

We also split a bottle of red and an order of tiramisu for dessert.  Both were also great.

Have had a few different glasses of wine, cocktails as well as beers from their list. They try to keep it pretty local for the beers and have great choices to choose from when it comes to wine and liquor from the bar!

Everything I have eaten is great and full of flavor and taste! One of my favorite things on the menu is the Grilled Romaine Salad. It is big enough to share as an appetizer with a friend or two or even for yourself for a meal. One of the best things on the menu but I say that about everything! I love the Pastas, Pizzas and dishes as well. One of my go to&#39;s is the Salmon or even a vodka Pasta. Again you cant pick a bad thing because there isnt anything bad on the menu!

The service is always amazing and the staff here are super friendly and knowledgable on the menu. Love when they are able to help me pair my wine/beer to a great dish. Servers make great recommendations when it comes to wine and will even give you a little taste prior to ordering a full glass. Thoroughly enjoy a few of their servers in particular that I like to request them if they are in for the night and will wait a little longer to be sat in their section ( Yda or Nate).

Ricotta/honeycomb small plate- delicious and fun to try- would like about twice the amount of bread and honeycomb for the price though ($10)

House salad- really tasty house dressing, pecans, Gorgonzola, fennel, greens and tomatoes ($6)

Shrimp and avocado salad- also really good, shrimp were cooked well and had a nice flavor ($14)

Vodka pasta- fresh pasta with a spicy tomato cream sauce and crispy pancetta. I really liked it! You have to like spicy though. ($14)

Kale and mushroom pizza- wood-fired, nice crust and flavor- my friend said it was good! ($14)

Kate is a great server she is very personable and really make you feel like your part of the fire and wine family.

If you are a Nutella fan they have a Nutella stuffed calzone with chocolate sauce. There tower of doughnuts with dipping sauces are irresistible.  This place is kid friendly and offers choices off the kids menu. They are always changing the menu seasonally and they offer suggestions on comment cards. I had recently suggested a sangria sorbet to my waitress Kate. I hope to see it on the menu in the near future. The only down fall is  I would recommend going later in the evening or week day they are a popular place and do not take reservations but who came blame them for being so popular .

fire-wine-glen-ellyn,Mark B.,Zs4v2spqvoa-O_AzfQ42bA,xHJ9JbxtjEtiQylg6v1PVw,"I came for dinner with a friend and we had an absolutely fantastic meal.

Decor: The bar area is a pretty standard bar and the restaurant portion is nicely decorated with a real &#34;homey&#34; feel. It is a very welcoming place to enjoy a meal or some drinks. The light level is low but helps to make it feel more intimate and set a low-key vibe. We had a table just inside the restaurant part so I didn&#39;t get a chance to see how large the entire place is or how many tables they might have.
Bathroom: Just like the rest of the place it is nicely kept and very inviting

Staff: The bartender (pre-dinner drinks) and our waiter were very friendly and attentive. Whenever our drinks were empty they were ready and willing to refill and the food was delivered very quickly. We also chatted with the owner who is a very cool guy who does exactly what you would want an owner to do: he manned the bar a bit, chatted with customers, and shot the shit with us despite his time being obviously stretched very thin. It&#39;s the small touches that are outstanding.

Food: Wow. Let me say that again, WOW. Everything we had was outstanding. We started with some bourbon (Maker&#39;s - a little larger selection would be cool) and then were seated for dinner. We began with the Mussels (SO DAMN GOOD) and the Prosciutto Di Parma (yum!) and then had Filet of Beef Medallions and the Hanger Steak (both superb!). For dessert we had bourbon Old Fashions and then a round of beers at the bar.

Value: The prices are respectable for the serving sizes. Factor in the level of service and the taste of the food and you are more than getting your money&#39;s worth.

All joking aside, this was one of the best desserts I&#39;ve had.  If only the small dish was the size of a semi-truck tire, then it would have been perfect.  Panna Cotta is like an Italian pudding, and Fire + Wine adds this balsamic drizzle and salt that combines well with the sweetness.

Ok wait.  Rewind.  I ate dinner here too.  Fire + Wine was a perfect halfway point for my friend and I to meet.  I arrived first and settled in with a glass of Prosecco.  Our waitress was also very sweet and attentive.

Many of the small plates were temping, like the arancini, burrata, or ricotta with honeycomb.  Do you see a pattern here?  So many cheesy options!  But I ordered a pizza instead, hoping to return sometime with a small group to do the small plates.

I loved my pizza.  I had the White Pizza, with mozzarella, goat cheese, pickled hot peppers, and basil.  Fire + Wine makes Neopolitan-style pizza which was perfectly chewy and not at all charred or burnt.  I didn&#39;t eat the whole thing; one pizza and perhaps a salad would make a nice meal for two.  I ate all but 2-3 slices and ate the rest for lunch the next day.

I enjoyed my meal here, but arriving early is always a good idea.  I got a table without any wait on a Wednesday at 5:30 p.m.  By the time we left, there were several people waiting for a table.

We were pretty early (before 6 pm) so I thought maybe we&#39;d get in pretty fast, but the wait was an hour!  Luckily we weren&#39;t starving yet so we went down the street for a drink.  After waiting an hour, my standards go up a bit, but this place totally surpassed them.  The food was fantastic!!  The menu has a mix of small plates and pizzas.  We had the prosciutto de parma, the shrimp and avocado salad, and the kale and wild mushroom pizza.  Seriously, everything was delicious.  The prosciutto dish was my husband&#39;s favorite because he is a cured meat fanatic.  I&#39;m not really a fan, but the roasted peppers, artichokes, mozzarella, bread, and arugula won me over by being extremely flavorful and fresh.  The salad had some of the best shrimp I&#39;ve ever had in the Midwest - they were large, plump, and perfectly cooked!  The pizza to me was the star of the show (my husband disagrees).  The crust was perfect and the mushrooms were actually a unique assortment of wild mushrooms and not just &#34;baby bellas&#34; or something.  

We also had some wine - I would say that the wine was very good, but the server fell a little flat on recommendations.  But everything else was perfect.

fire-wine-glen-ellyn,Alyssa K.,iXAtK6wdiRdum5Znwx_A5g,si2S1VKP8blXXfRwuUTc1A,"Yes, this is as good as it gets.  I&#39;ve heard so many great things about Fire + Wine and since we are moving away from the area soon, I knew we needed to try it out before then! We visited on a Thursday and as I expected we had about 30 minute wait before we could get a table.  The bar area was also pretty full so we didn&#39;t even end up getting drinks prior to our dinner.

We had a nice quiet table in the back which was really enjoyable because we were easily able to carry on a conversation.  We order the prosciutto di parma which included prosciutto, artichoke hearts, housemade mozzerella, and balsamic, the medjool dates and chorizo, and bianco pizza.  Everything was the bomb.com.  If I had to choose a favorite I would probably pick the dates &amp; chorizo.  The combination has never sounded for good in theory to me, but in practice it is amazing.  Plus the spicy red sauce that covered the dish was also amazing.  I could eat those everyday.

I really loved the pizza too.  The butternut squash and sage combination is one of my absolute favorites plus it was cheesy and a little bit salty.  Our server tried to convince us to get dessert and I&#39;m sure the desserts are also amazing but I stuffed myself to full with the pizza so we had to pass.

According to their website, they don&#39;t take reservations...some of these reviews made me think I&#39;d be standing in line to get in if my timing was bad so my friend and I settled for an early dinner to beat the rush.  We got here about 5pm on a Saturday night.

I had pasta on Christmas Eve so I wasn&#39;t in the mood for pasta...next visit here I need to try pasta for sure!  We were undecided about so many things... beer or wine? What appetizer?

So we settled for a glass of wine to pair with our dinner - we got the arancini for an appetizer, pizza with sausage &amp; pepperoni (I can&#39;t recall the one we ordered) and for dessert, flourless chocolate cake which wasn&#39;t on the dessert menu, but recommended by our server.
Our server was pretty great, she recommended a wine we might like and offered up samples ahead of time.  I ended up ordering a second glass of wine, being the one she mentioned.

Exactly like that. 

We walked in the door and went to our left into the restaurant. The attached gas station/quick shop is immediately to the right. There were maybe ten tables inside and you place your order at the counter. The women working the counter were nice. I was overwhelmed standing there trying to make a decision. I was with two of my sisters and there were three to-go containers of baklava - that was an easy decision. I ordered a combination plate with a little of everything and my sisters both order Kifta/kefta kabob. They seemed to cook everything to order except for maybe the steak and the rice. The steak was my least favorite thing on the plate. It was too chewy for me. The rice was good though. But the chicken breast and the kabob were the highlights for me!  I specifically asked for Tzatziki sauce and I think my sisters ended up with a garlic type sauce. The garlic sauce was too potent for them while I found my sauce to be delicious!

Immediately upon entering I noticed they have a really nice digital changing menu, with a wide variety of items, now.. I am pretty new to this kind of food, so I just went with what looked good, and I ordered the #3 Beef Shawarma wrap, with a side of Tabouleh salad. All I have to say is this wrap was AMAZING!! Perfectly seasoned/tender beef topped with the freshest pickles, tomatoes, onions, and a Tahini sauce mixture made to blow your taste buds all the way to next Tuesday. 

As for the Tabouleh salad, it&#39;s probably the freshest, and healthiest tasting thing I have consumed in awhile! Delicious lemon juice/olive oil dressing, chopped mint, onions, bulgur, tomato, and parsley, chopped so fine the flavors literally explode together, I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had anything quite like it, definitely an immune system booster.

Coming to this place is very odd. First of all, it&#39;s in an old BP station. You park where the now-defunct gas pumps are and you walk in the glass doors towards the left. If you need to use the washroom, you walk back through the &#34;lobby&#34; and into the old mini-mart part of the building and pray that the ladies&#39; room isn&#39;t locked... dammit. So then you go to the men&#39;s room, hold your breath as you hover over the seat, and then go back into the restaurant and order some falafel.

Their falafels are cute! They look like mini donuts, and are tasty to boot. The beef schawarma is just okay - it was basically seasoned chunks of steak, which might be to some people&#39;s liking but we enjoy the giant-cone-of-meat schawarma instead. The kufta kebabs were also delicious.

Spending $20+ dollars at an abandoned gas station and getting subpar food was not the way I wanted to spend my Saturday.",23/01/16,50,2,1,0,-15,-0.17419999999999997,0.142,0.13,4.728,No,444

I only had a falafel. The pita was too big and dry, that&#39;s why a star was lost, but the falafel, toppings and tahini were great. I&#39;d go back to try other items for sure. 

The interesting thing is the location. A run down gas station no longer in service houses Larsa&#39;s. The drive thru signs are up but you can&#39;t use it. There is caution tape around the pumps. The gas station side has product still in it but is locked up. I worry that this totally unattractive mess will steer potential business away. 

If you are brave, drive in, eat, stay, Larsa&#39;s will not disappoint on flavor.

And there we were: Pulling up alongside a non-functioning gas pump, parking our car for lunch.

Only negative? Right off the bat, no high chairs for the mega tiny patrons. Admittedly, I was pretty surprised -- it&#39;s probably more of an oversight than anything, but definitely one worth rectifying, in my mind. We&#39;re in the suburbs, homey, and tiny people live here, too. Buy a couple high chairs, toss &#39;em in the corner. No brainer. We ordered for take-out, as a result.

The food was great: An order of very fresh mujaddara, a pair of veg platters (falafel x 3, hummus, babaganoush, dolmas x 3, a wee pile of lettuce, cups of tahini) and baklava. Everything hit the spot like a champ. We were impressed.

The interior is very clean, warmly decorated, with a open well operated kitchen.  The menu choices are provided on a sharp row of displays over the counter with appetizingly photographed presentations of the shawarma, kabab, salads, gyros, and sides.  Attractive and clean chairs, tables and lighting offer a pleasant dine-in experience, while they are efficiently equipped to provide a great take-out meal as well.

I tried the shawarma and hummus plate with a side of dolmas.  The dolmas were scrumptious.  Great seasoning, perfectly sized, with quality grape leafs.  The hummus was wonderful, and the pita perfectly warmed and fresh.  The shawarma was tender, flavorful, and plentiful in portion.

Others at the table had salads topped with gyro meat.  The heapings of gyro and salad were ample enough for any appetite, and the gyro meat sliced and lightly crisped expertly.  The salad greens, cucumber, and tomato were fresh and crisp.  

Throughout the meal, pleasant Mediterranean music played.  The staff was quite friendly, and the food was prepared fresh and well presented.  I would recommend they upgrade their plates used with the salads;  the food presentation and quality are not done justice by that canvas.  Perhaps black plastic plates would offer more contrast and finesse at minimal extra cost.

Not the best Mexican food but if you&#39;re looking for decent food and a reasonable price then this is the place for you. The steak and chicken could use more seasoning on.

I also wouldn&#39;t recommend this particular location for any parties or large sized groups due to seating and how busy it gets during lunch time. 

Food: I&#39;ve tried torta, taco, and burrito. So I&#39;m basing my review on these foods. I like the streak the most. Good flavor and it&#39;s not dry. The Carnitas (shredded pork) is dry and doesn&#39;t have much taste. The Barbacoa contains absolutely no flavor at all. I would recommend the three items I&#39;ve had here just be more selective with meat choice. Steak and chicken can do no wrong. But the rest comes down to preference. 

The waitress is always nice and polite when I come in. I work nearby and come in all the time. I&#39;d recommend this restaurant AT LEAST for a first time try.

This is a place that my husband and I really wanted to like. We went the first time and our experience was pretty bad. Well, so we gave it a second chance and it wasn&#39;t much better. It takes a while to get the pizza and it states on the menu that their &#34;homemade pies&#34; take 25-30 minutes to make. 


SERVICE:
Not the greatest. Maybe they&#39;re understaffed like so many of the reviews say, but hire some people! There are tons of unemployed Americans that need jobs. Whatever. It took a few minutes for us to be seated both times, even though there were booth open and not a ton of families there at the time. I asked for tips on drinks, but the waitress told me she doesn&#39;t drink beer. Ok, but my question was on the cider. Ok, I&#39;m not going to ding her for not drinking alcohol. She never offered us another round, nor brought us water. After finishing our drinks during the appetizer, she never was really around for longer than a second to even think about bringing us anything.
My husband said that he would give the service 3 stars, but I disagree..closer to 1-2.


FOOD:
Garlic bread:
We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer. We received it maybe 15 minutes after ordering it. For what it was, it should&#39;ve taken 10 minutes. It was overdone and burnt **the second pic is of the garlic bread they brought out second&#34;. It was literally rock hard. Also, no garlic. The second basket brought was better and not hard, but still just like glorified toast. It was like an italian beef roll cut in quarters and toasted, then with butter on it. No fresh garlic, and not even the crappy garlic powder that some restaurants use for their garlic bread. Pretty disappointed.

Pizza:
Good, but nothing to write home about. I like the texture of the braided crust, but there&#39;s really nothing else that is greater than average. About 2-3 pieces of nickel sized sausage per piece of our sausage and garlic pizza. Average pizza, that&#39;s what I would call it.

Drinks:
They have a good selection beer/cider/wine list. For that, I give them a star. Unfortunately, the average bar has a good selection.

It takes a significant amount of time to order, wait for food, and then wait for the bill after finishing food. The service isn&#39;t the greatest.

This is my first review only because this was way outside of the norm of service you receive anywhere and management, as well as potential patrons, need to be aware and have some expectations set if you are lucky to have our server.

We were in town for a family reunion. This place had solid reviews both in ratings and quantity. It was not very busy, maybe two other tables, and we were greeted by a sweet girl directing us to our table. 

And that&#39;s when it went downhill. How you may ask when we just walked in? It started with our server beginning to take our drink orders and abruptly saying she will be back when someone yelled at her from the oven. This set the tempo as our server brought everything over with the cold hand of indifference including her robotic, insincere, and minimal conversational tone. 

For the record, we ordered a few drinks and a bottle of wine, Valley of the Moon, from their reserve menu along with several pizzas and some gelato for our daughter. EVERYTHING was GREAT. 

Disappointing we had to get her attention to get anything. You know...as in pretending we were waving down a plane to rescue us at one point. She was not engaging. No refills on beer or coke offered. Our bottle of wine was brought over, sans cork, already open with two glasses. She was never in any hurry. Making eye contact was difficult and when it did happen it provided the opposite reaction from what we needed. I walked over to the bar and register, where she was hiding from giving any additional discretionary effort, and I begin speaking to my 8yr old daughter about dessert. We eventually ordered there, with her, because why would we not want someone to ask us if we needed dessert as is the almost knee jerk reaction tradition of any server. Kudos for being different. She did not look up. I finally asked what the gelato flavors were where she recited. We choose and walked back. 

Her engagement was reminiscent of a 160 character restriction on Twitter. She only thanked us while we were walking out, which obviously was facetious and muscle memory.

We tipped 20% because who knows what day she had. I hope it gets better. For me, if I lived here I would never return because of the very negative, memorable experience we had. 

Again great pizza! But maybe you need a buffet because we could have fumbled around serving and smiling at our table ourselves...or hire nicer robots.",09/07/15,269,1,2,4,29,3.8470000000000004,5.0440000000000005,2.4910000000000005,25.464999999999996,No,2517

The beers were refreshing and delightful. Mike described each beer like a sommelier describes wine. So passionate!

raimondos-pizza-and-pub-north-aurora,JP P.,on3R_FINJG3AAW7MN9dZfA,PqqcCnssnRG8okYjP6yIDA,"Upon entering Raimondo&#39;s, you immediately note the decor. Did someone actually envisage a vintage 1950&#39;s pizza joint with a modern day spin? The floor plan is open with plenty of classic booths. It&#39;s simple, inviting and it works. The view at the end of the bar allows you to continually scan the entire operation. I liked the environment, not so much the pizza.

Basically the yelp reviews are telltale with a very clear point; if you serve &#34;Craft Beers&#34; &amp; &#34;Signature Pizza&#34; you must be &#34;Kick-Ass-Good&#34;! NFW! 

Again, the beer selection and  Customer Service dominate each review. A description of &#34;Taste&#34; is brief and secondary in thought. Agree, management and staff will kill you with &#34;Kindness&#34;!

However, what about the taste?  BLAND. &#34;Ach-N-Lou&#39;s&#34; Pizza Pub in Aurora smokes this place. By severe contrast, &#34;Emil&#39;s&#34; pizza found in Woodman&#39;s freezer case will inspire your taste buds.

Our 16&#34; Thin Crust...Sausage, Mushroom, Onion &amp; Black Olive arrived cool to the touch with a spongy crust. Not OK, let it be known this is the first time in a while I did not scorch the roof of my mouth!  A pathetic presentation equaled in taste.

I&#39;m sorry, if your looking for a classic tavern style pizza, look elsewhere. But if your pizza taste buds crave the &#34;Hand Crafted Italian Beef and Giardiniera&#34;, The&#34; B-L-T&#34;or the &#34;Bacon Cheeseburger&#34; SIGNATURE PIZZA PIE...hey, this is your place.

We sat down and the restaurant wasn&#39;t even half full, we then proceeded to wait and wait and wait and wait for pizza.

My other gripe is that our server kept taking her order pad and despite the fact that she has an apron with multiple pockets, stuck it in the back of her pants by her underwear.

First time there is was really good.  One of the owners greeted and sat us - told us a bit about the family owned restaurant and fresh ingredients and specialities - and the food was really good. The marinara was really good and the meatballs were awesome.  We went back a few more times and thought that we found a nice spot we would be coming to for years. 

So...why the 2 stars?  Well, we went back about a month ago and had really bad and slow service. We sat a long time and waited for the server to come and greet us at the table. Then it took a very long time for each phase of the meal and we actually got the feeling we were more of a bother to the server than anything. He didn&#39;t seem to really care to do his job one bit. We chalked it up as a one off and that maybe he was having a bad day.  But... We went back again last night and had a very similar experience.  Eventually that same waiter came over, but only to tell us that our waitress is coming soon. She did, and we order a very simple meal: 2 unsweetened iced teas, a meatball sandwich, and the bruschetta. It took 10 minutes for her to bring us the very watered down iced tea (might as well just drink water). Then it took another 47 minutes to get our food. Yes, I timed it after the iced teas took so long.  47 minutes for a meatball sandwich and bruschetta!  Unfriendly, blah attitudes to with that awful service too.  To add insult to injury, my wife got sick that night and I felt like complete crap too. 

Could it be us?  Did we do something to piss them off?  Why the crappy service?  We are not demanding people and always treat people in restaurants nicely regardless of how they are because 1) we are respectful; 2) we don&#39;t want spit and boogers in our food. Plus, we always tip - even when the service is not deserving. So, it seems to me that it&#39;s just how this place operates. Regardless, the service is so bad that we will just go elsewhere. 

Oh yah, 2 stars. Well, the 3 non stars are for the last 2 servers and experience, plus the decline in food and getting sick. The 2 stars given are because I know the owner is a good guy and we had a nice experience with him our first few visits.

So this may fall into what I call the &#34;Hangover Effect&#34;. I saw rave reviews and had high hopes. (This happened with that movie The Hangover - people said it was the most hilarious movie ever made of all time EVER...I saw It.  I laughed once. I believe I may have laughed at least double that, had it not been so, so hyped.)

Anyway - I was intrigued with Italian Nachos. Whaaat? turns out, it was sauce and cheese over nacho chips with Italian beef sprinkled on top (for $2 more bucks). 
Overall it was a little disappointing. 

We got the &#34;original crust&#34; ala supremo. So...and maybe those of you in North Aurora had once experienced the nectar of Gods that was Franks Pizza - and if so, please know that this is where I was - Franks was our favorite. But this was not Franks. Boo. The crust was bland. It was crusty on the outside and warm and pillowy on the inside, but it lacked depth beyond that. The sauce was under seasoned. actually, the whole pizza seemed under seasoned. I mean, it wasn&#39;t the worst pizza by any stretch of the imagination - but it didn&#39;t blow any socks off either. Also - when the menu said &#34;ask for dipping sauce&#34; with the crust style - we did and we thought it would be garlic butter sauce...and it wasn&#39;t. just bland marinara. Lesson learned.

The service was extraordinarily friendly. There was one young guy in there running the whole of front of house-  the bar and all the tables and the running of food. It wasn&#39;t that busy but that kid was working his tail off.

raimondos-pizza-and-pub-north-aurora,Chuck D.,GbVSRqA1mPaLqw6nfv9NqQ,zzMGdr9hS0162DJKI_BRyg,"My husband and I just moved into the area, so the first thing we wanted to do was try out some new places. So, using the excuse that I still didn&#39;t have my kitchen organized enough to cook, we headed out to try Raimondo&#39;s. 

First of all, the thing that got us here is that they have a pretty nice beer selection. While I wish a little more was on draft, the bottled selection was diverse and exciting. Even better, their staff really seems to have a passion for it and took to suggesting beers for us based on what we had already ordered. 

We ordered a double dough with giardiniera and sausage. The pizza was really delish! The toppings were clearly very fresh and sauce was fantastic. Normally left over pizza is just something I need to get through, but I was super excited to come home the next night and heat it up again. It really was a well made delicious pizza. I&#39;m excited to try more combinations of toppings as they definitely give you a TON of choices. 

One of the owner&#39;s came over and asked how everything was and mentioned that he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d seen us in there before (they clearly know their customers). We told him we just moved in and he insisted we have some gelato on the house. It was such a nice gesture. He also asked where we were at and let us know that they deliver as well, which is great! Its a nice atmosphere, so I&#39;d definitely like to dine in and enjoy the beer selection most of the time, but having the delivery option is always good too. 

If you are in the area and in the mood for some homemade fresh pizza, don&#39;t pass this place up! I know we will definitely be back.",09/05/13,169,4,3,5,81,8.553899999999999,4.12,0.0,13.880000000000003,No,1644

My wife went to Raimondo&#39;s with a friend a while ago and told me I should check it out because they have a pretty interesting beer selection and the beer guy there (Mike) is pretty enthusiastic about it. 

Well, she was right and it&#39;s one of my favorite places now. The beer selection is excellent (especially for trying stuff you may not be able to get in the stores), the pizza is fantastic, the pastas and sandwiches are great, and even the gelato is good. 

Beyond all of that, though, is the atmosphere. There are people enjoying beers at the bar, older folks, younger folks, and lots of families when we go. My 2-year-old son asks me about Susie and Ryan and Mike a lot - he loves the attention they give him (and the pizza, of course). 

There are beer tasting events, charitable events, and other cool community things all the time. I had my first beer from Solemn Oath there, for example. Also, after their St. Baldrick&#39;s event, most of the staff was shaved bald! That&#39;s some commitment. 

Overall, I miss the old-fashioned pizza joints from the past. (Charlotte&#39;s, Shakey&#39;s, etc.) There&#39;s a personality to them that&#39;s not manufactured by some marketing focus group. Raimondo&#39;s has that warmth and personality.

The buffalo wings were terrible. The skin was rubbery and the sauce was tasteless. When I returned them the owner explained to me that they&#39;re supposed to be that way!!? He explained that they do not make them themselves. They also bake them because they don&#39;t have a fryer. He buys this brand because they are gluten free (no breading). While I appreciate that the business has gluten free options I am not gluten sensitive and wanted crispy tasty buffalo wings, not baked chicken with gross sauce.

We actually went here based on the huge amount of 5 star ratings, and I wasn&#39;t as impressed as the reviews indicated. We ordered 3... yes 3, different pizzas, and all were... OK.  One veggie pizza, one custom (bacon, sausage, pepperoni), and the &#34;Godfather&#34; (italian beef &amp; giardiniera). I myself wasn&#39;t a fan of the &#34;original&#34; crust.. just too doughy for me.. if I return I&#39;d definitely go with the thin crust.  I could only finish 2 pieces of pizza, and it was mainly because of the dough... not the toppings.

Of the 3 (I tried all), the custom one was actually my favorite. The bacon was delicious, crisp and flavorful, and the &#34;secret blend&#34; sausage is quite good.  

Our server was decent, he knew a lot about the beer selections. One suggestion to the owners; provide a daily list of beers on a piece of paper or whatever so we don&#39;t have to stand up from our table and try to read the chalkboard every time we order a beer. 

The cheesy garlic bread appetizer we ordered was embarrassingly small. It&#39;s just bread and cheese, and at that price point, it simply needs to be a larger portion.

While we never spoke to the owner personally, he was making his rounds around the place and seemed nice and personable. We did make a reservation and was pleasantly surprised when we arrived that there was a table with a large &#34;Reserved&#34; sign on it with my name on the check. Bonus points for that.

I&#39;m sure eventually we&#39;ll try this place again (my wife loves pizza), and I&#39;ll definitely go with the thin crust next time and probably order my own custom pizza.

They are gritty and taste horrible.  This gluten-free is the best I have had from a pizza joint (but still not as good as the store bought SCAR crusts, Pastorelli&#39;s sauce, and some Sargento Mozzerella).  Problem is this, unless you are eating here, don&#39;t order it for take-out.  They are notorious for telling you a time over the phone and then making it very early.  It has happened three times (that I know of) in the last 4 purchases.  Once the owner even laughed about it like it was funny that my pizza had been sitting on top of the oven for 20+ minutes.  Honestly, don&#39;t understand why if you say on the phone 45 mins you would make it 20 mins early, but that is their deal.  I will not buy from here any more because it has happened multiple times already.  PS.  Don&#39;t believe Mike (the owners son), the first time this happened he was very apologetic and gave me a song and dace about they are a family business, give us another chance, yada, yada... then the last time, he acted like I was ridiculous for requiring that the pizza be made closer to the time specified time then 20 minutes and stated that I should take my business elsewhere because I was obviously too picky for them to make happy.

We went at lunchtime and ordered an Ala Supremo pizza. While we waited, we enjoyed monster-sized Cokes and watched the lunch crowd. A lot of people had to wait for pizza by the slice as a new pepperoni pie was about to come out of the oven. I can imagine that this would irritate me if I had a short lunch break and just wanted a slice. However, they had only been open for 10 days, so I will cut them some slack. Nobody seemed angry, and the staff apologized multiple times. And there&#39;s something to be said for knowing that they have very fresh pizza by the slice. 

I normally hate the double-dough-style crusts, but this crust was awesome. I thoroughly enjoyed the crisp crust under the toppings and the delicious &#34;pizza bone&#34; left at the end. The pizza is heavy on the cheese, which was not at all a problem for us. Lots of great toppings. We really enjoyed our pizza.

The drink selection was a pleasant surprise. First, there are fountain Cokes. Yes - Coke at a pizza place! Their beer list is impressive, with many different microbrews and Oberon on tap. Amazing. Can&#39;t wait to go back for dinner.

We have had food from Pita BBQ three times; we dined in once and carried out twice. All three times, our food has been delicious. Very, very good. We order the same thing every time, Chicken Shawarma Sandwich for me, Spicy Chili Chicken Sandwich for the hubby, an order of falafel and hummus for the adult female, two kids chicken shawarma meals with rice for the kids and two orders of fries. Every. Single. Time. Annnnddddd.... every single time we have ordered this, they have gotten the order wrong. Every. Single. Time. However, the food is really, really good, so we go back (and it isn&#39;t like we live nearby. We are in Algonquin, Pita BBQ is in South Elgin).

Second issue:  the wait time. For-ev-er. It&#39;s an uncomfortable wait time. We place our order and we sit. Well, not &#34;we&#34;. If my husband is in the area, he will place and order and wait.... and wait.... and wait.... for our order.  Awkwardly long. But, the food is really, really good. So he waits. Last time he was there, he was told he should call it in. However, it&#39;s pretty much illegal to call and drive. *insert eyeroll*

However, with all that being said... my picky 11 year old asks for Pita BBQ at least five times a week. Yes, at least FIVE times a week. He would probably ask for it every day but as soon as he starts to open his mouth and starts with his usual &#34;you know what would be great for dinner&#34; bit...

I say &#34;I think&#34; it&#39;s my first time here because I&#39;m almost positive that it originally opened under a different name. Yes, now I remember. It used to be &#34;simply kabobs&#34; and I first heard of it thru Groupon. 

Heard of this location thru the folks at Pita BBQ on rt. 59. My fianc is a fan of the unusually red Spicy Chicken. He noticed that the chicken at this location, although still nice and tender, was a different cut and texture. Bigger chicken chunks, more cubed rather than shredded. He prefers the shreddier version because there is more sauce. I like this version because the meat is more tender and juicy. The other difference is the absence of tea and iced tea. Not a huge deal, but I used to like when the other location offered an Arabian type hot tea. 

Despite the differences, still think this place is decent and glad they&#39;re expanding. I recommend the combo dinner plate. Tons of meat and good chance to try the different kinds for $13.

Between the two locations, I have tried everything on the menu.  My personal favorite is the Beef Kefta wraps, but it appears that is going to be a seasonal item now.  Right behind it though is the Chicken Shwarma wrap.  Such a refreshing combination of flavors.  If you are in a flavor rut, try it out.  It will get you back on track.  

One secret item that I think people are passing on that they shouldn&#39;t, is the Tandoori burger.  I tried this for the first time last week, and must say that I was amazed how much I enjoyed it.  Again, a flavor explosion that I was not expecting.  So good!  Take a chance and try it out.

My wife and I generally travel to either Pita Puff, Pita House or Pita Inn for this kind of food. 

Stopped in last week and tried a chicken kabob shish kabob sandwich.  It&#39;s basically chunks of grilled white meat rolled inside of a large, thin pita, along with some tomato, onion and cucumber.  I graced this sandwich with some of their homemade hot sauce and that white Lebanese garlicky sauce that restaurants like these serve.  Pure heaven.  It&#39;s pretty simple, but the sauces make it something special.   

I have also tried their chicken kabob plate (meal) which is the same kind of chicken served over a bed of saffron rice alongside some salad, with some pita bread on the side.  I liked this equally, and really just ended up dumping all of my meal ingredients into my pita, along with copious amounts of hot and white sauce.  This was also delicious.  

For me, what makes a place like this is the flavor of the sauces and dressings.  It&#39;s very good here.  I wouldn&#39;t compare it to others, since it&#39;s pretty much different from others.  But it&#39;s very good and I was told they are homemade.  The hot sauce isn&#39;t overly spicy like some others are.  You can use quite a bit of this without making your meal unbearably hot.  

My fear is that they will not draw in enough customers here.  Nothing has really lasted in this location.  If people check this place out, they will like it and return.  I highly recommend it.  If I had liked their baklava better (didn&#39;t enjoy it at all), I might have given them 5 stars.  It was dry and crusty without much flavor for my tastes.

Detroit-area Lebanese restaurants have spoiled me for good with their fresh pillowy pitas, magical whipped garlic paste, and perfectly spiced everything. I haven&#39;t found anything comparable in Illinois (*yet*), but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not a fan of Pita BBQ.

We ordered the combination grill which was a great way to sample the menu- the chicken kabob, rice, and lebanese cucumber &amp; tomato salad were all pleasant, if not the stars of the show. The chicken &amp; beef shawarma were seasoned nicely but our portions were dry. That issue would have to improve for me to order the shawarma again. 

But what will bring me back to Pita BBQ are...

-The spicy chili chicken- Simmered with onions and a deep reddish-hued sauce with mellow heat, it&#39;s craveable. Really good. If I could recommend one thing that you must try, it would be this. 
-Falafel (fried crisp, but tender &amp; flavorful on the inside) I will just order a whole plate next time.
-Spicy fries 
-Garlic sauce (mild &amp; creamy, not super garlicky. We put it on everything- fries, rice, everything.)

pita-bbq-south-elgin,Dave S.,i0XClOTGRim0ANS9bQp93w,zkqXQFt_X5kC_NFdv6mbJQ,"I grew up in Skokie, so I get the difference between the Shawarma at Pita BBQ that is made from layers of marinated thinly sliced meat that is put on a rotating vertical spit to marinate in its own juices and the mass-produced gyros loaves, of finely ground meat pressed into a cylinder that everyone is accustomed to seeing at every gyro joint in the city and suburbs.

Pita BBQ is authentic shawarma!  My family and I have eaten there three times in the past week.  The chicken and steak shawarma are incredible.  They do have a gyro cylinder if that&#39;s your thing.

They also have something called Chili Chicken.  I thought is was going to be normal chili made out of ground chicken.  Nope.  We&#39;re talking chunks of marinated chicken sauteed with fried onions and some type of chili spices.

My wife always gets the salad with the chicken which she loves.  The chicken is similar in flavor to the chicken shawarma.  My daughter loves the chicken kabob wrap.  The wrap is actually a thinly rolled large pita.

Sides and sauces are great.  They have a hot sauce that I would compare to harissa sauce you would expect at a middle eastern restaurant.  Tahini sauce, yum.  I didn&#39;t care for the dill sauce.  It tastes mayonnaise based.  The humus is excellent.  It&#39;s cute how they put a little olive oil and a dash of sumac in the center of the little side dish of hummus like you would expect on a big plate of humus at an authentic middle eastern restaurant.  The Lebanese salad is really nice with chunks of fresh cucumber and tomato. The Basmati rice is light and fluffy.  Not heavy and oily.

I grew up on falafel before I knew I had a gluten intolerance.  Who would have thought we would see the day we could get falafel in the western suburbs?  Wish I could try it and review it for you.

The closest you are going to get to this food is Just Kabobs on Randall and 64.  I&#39;ve been going to Just Kabobs since day one.  I love it.  Huge portions of good tasting comfort food.  The difference between the two, Just Kabobs is more of a Greek cuisine and Pita BBQ is Middle Eastern which is more unique to this area right now.  Think back to how novel Just  Kabobs was when it opened and brought its cuisine to St. Charles.

Their sandwiches ... how the hell do they make their sandwiches so good?  It&#39;s not like they&#39;re reinventing the culinary-wheel here, and upon first glance, the sandwiches almost look a little under-whelming ... but then my god -- perfection.

Their soups are amazing as well.  A coffee, sandwich and bag of chips runs about $10, but it&#39;s delicious and filling.  The service is A+.  The owners work there, along with their staff.  They take pride in the establishment and it shows.

I personally can&#39;t stand Doctor Who -- but I get it and don&#39;t judge, it&#39;s just not my thing, like Star Trek vs Star Wars.  And to be fair, I&#39;ve caught a few episodes of FarScape there, so I&#39;ll give them a pass.

The staff is friendly, the kids and I loved the decorations, and we were all fans of the food.
I had the blue box cafe salad, which comes with bleu cheese, bacon, and hardboiled eggs. The eggs were overdone ( which is super easy to do with hardboiled eggs anyway, honestly), but the salad was still really good. The little monsters each had the grilled cheese, and they loved it. 

I also had an iced black coffee, and I loved it, it was really flavorful.

Also, for my Pokemon Go friends: There is a pokespot that is incredibly close, so you can actually access it while inside the cafe. Splendid time to throw a lure on while sitting down for lunch.

I got the sausage gumbo which was super hot but was on par with Campbell&#39;s and my Dad got a tuna sandwich (came with no pickle) which was thinly made and could have come out of my own kitchen easily. Very unimpressive for $12. Maybe I&#39;ll come back for just a coffee to go sometime.,11/04/16,49,2,1,1,8,0.3540999999999999,0.502,0.669,3.829,No,467

They have a lot of tasty sandwich offerings. Today, however, I ordered the tuna melt and I was a bit disappointed.  It had the least amount of tuna salad I&#39;ve ever had on a sandwich. I&#39;m attaching a photo but it is deceiving.  It was basically a grilled cheese with a schmeer of tuna salad.  Maybe it was an isolated incident, so I&#39;m not letting it effect my rating.

Food: There is a ton of options here. Salads are pricey but a huge portion. Eating healthy anywhere always equals pricey. I like their turkey rueben, Bluebox salad, Caesar wrap and definitely their seasonal Turkey Gobbler (I believe that it is called that). The turkey gobbler is really delicious. You could probably look at the ingredients and make it at home after Thanksgiving, but I&#39;m looking for the convenience of being ready to eat without carving a freshly baked turkey. Come on. 

Drinks: I love coffee but for some reason their coffee is too strong for me. I was informed by a worker there that it could be the milk option that I have chosen and suggested to go with higher fat in the milk would help. The milk did make a difference, but I still can&#39;t handle it. My choice of poison is their London Fog latte and some honey. Hot or cold, it just gives me the right amount of caffeine needed to complete the rest of my day at work.

Snacks: Try their magic bar with chocolate and coconut!?! They have other options, but this is my choice. 

Line: The line may be confusing on where to order if it is your first time. Sometimes, the line starts directly in front of the register or curves along the drink bar. Just ask the person in front of you if they are in line. 

Bathrooms: if you are needing to go to the bathroom, they do not have a direct one. It is more of a communal one with the other businesses in the building. Every attempt that I&#39;ve tried to go, I&#39;ve always ran into an issue such as no toilet paper or dirty. It&#39;s not their fault since it is shared. 

The workers: They are very sweet people. I have seen some random acts of kindness with whom, I believe, are the owners to people in the area that not even customers. To treat others with respect and humanity, this is always cool in my book. 

Try different things until you find your niche. It took me a little while to give up on their coffee options.",30/06/16,242,5,1,5,7,6.4011,4.045,0.574,23.381,No,2122

I have yet to jump on the Doctor Who bandwagon (and probably never will), but my sister is a hugeee fan. While she and my mother were visiting Elgin, we decided to lunch at the Blue Box Cafe, which is some kind of Doctor Who-inspired cafe in downtown Elgin.

Yep, the walls are covered with blue phone booths and British coffee mugs and all sort of things related to the Doctor(s). Thankfully, you don&#39;t have to be a Whovian to appreciate this cafe. The cafe is otherwise pretty simple &amp; cute, the menu boasts a variety of drinks and sandwiches, and the atmosphere is pretty chill.

I had an almond latte and the veggielicious sandwich (with chips), my sister had one of the salads, and my mother had some kind of sandwich, as well. My veggielicious sandwich was realllllyyy good, like.... mmmlicious! It was huge, which was perfect for my hungry tummy. I ate the whole thing and basically licked my fingers afterwards. Mmm. My sister loved her salad and my mom enjoyed her meal, too. We were all happy to have lunch here, and my sister was especially excited to get her Doctor Who fix.

Blue Box Cafe is definitely a great addition to Elgin.

Anyway visited yesterday on the second to last day of my visit. We arrived around 8:30 and the place wasn&#39;t too busy but there were a few people there which is always a good thing, I think. 

I spent a good minute or two marveling at the interior and atmosphere. I loved the corner with the TARDIS door and the coat rack with the coat and scarf and cane! And the fez and bow ties were so cute. It made me happy being in there.

I liked the menu, it was your basic cafe menu with sandwiches and salads and coffee selections. I liked that the menu wasn&#39;t overwhelmed with the DW theme. I ate a breakfast sandwich with bacon, cheddar, and egg on sourdough. I also had a mint mocha latte which I surprisingly liked even though I&#39;m not generally a fan of mocha coffees.

They were playing season 1 of the rebooted season of Doctor Who ( 9th Doctor and Rose Tyler). It was so cool!

We popped in for lunch on a Saturday &amp; the place was bustling.  There were still tables open so we could sit down, but they did a steady stream of business both for the coffee and the sandwiches.

I had the Veggielicious &amp; the Hubs had the Elgin Club.  Both were darn good &amp; they toasted the bread.

First, let me start with our scenario.   It was my son&#39;s 10th birthday and he is a huge whovian.  We already had his themed birthday party prior but the day of his birthday, but what could we do to top that?  I did a search on the internet and came across the Blue Box Cafe.  I noticed that the hours are until 7pm during the week so I used the contact us to obtain more information.  A quick reply happened from Chris, the co-owner, which was warm and welcoming to me that he would be there waiting for us and if we needed to stay a bit longer after 7pm, that he would accommodate.  

When we arrived, we were not let down.  My son was so surprised with all the paintings, pictures, memorabilia, gifts, and decorations.   Knowing that it was my son&#39;s birthday, they wished him a happy one which made him feel so special.  On three tv&#39;s was an episode of doctor who playing and then Chris made this even more special.  He asked my son what was his favorite episode and he would put it on.  We took many pictures and really enjoyed the atmosphere in its entirety.

The staff was absolutely perfect.  It went beyond wishing my boy a happy birthday.  There was a sense of care in the midst of everything.  They almost seemed to be happy working there.   Fancy that.  Employees who care.  One gentlemen was just so pleasant that he really made an impact on my 11 year old daughter.  He was just so nice and friendly.  It was amazing.  Employees like this are a valued commodity in today&#39;s world.

My family isn&#39;t a huge sandwich/salad/soup for dinner, so I was a bit apprehensive about this.  I was blown away about the food.  I went with the Submarine Italiano and it was fantastic.  The bread was soft and fresh, the meats were rich and the sweet pickle that they put on there just made it complete.  I also had a chance to try my 6 year old daughters grilled cheese, which her response was &#34;they made me pick three cheeses&#34; as if it was the hardest thing that she had to do all day.  Perfectly grilled.  Perfectly tasty.  I also had a taste of my 9 year old son&#39;s chicken and rice soup.  Thick and full.  There was chicken in there.  A lot of chicken.  The taste was again, just perfect.   Although I didn&#39;t try the salads, they looked well presented and fresh.

After coming in from the back she prepared my food with bare hands she did not have any gloves so the sanitation was definitely not there. I&#39;m talking about bare hands touching raw onion putting it into my chili and the same with the cheese, meat that went on my Sandwich and condiments. She seemed offended when I asked her questions about the menu and asked if she could put the sandwich on the Panini press. Then after she was done with the food she said thanks like she was finished with my order but she forgot to make my latte. 

The owner however seemed very cool and genuine about the business. He talked about live music during the week. I mentioned to both of them that I was a first time customer and only the owner showed interest the woman with the dark hair with the piercing didn&#39;t seem like she could give a care in the world.

We live right down the street and always swing by. I can&#39;t say enough about the staff - the owner Chris and his wife are some of the kindest and hardest working people we&#39;ve had the pleasure to meet. They recognize us by name, and I always hear my husband come home, telling me about the good coffee he got that morning, or how he loves the ham and cheese breakfast sandwich. 

The cafe is special, as it prides itself on being a Dr. Who-themed cafe. Though I am not familiar with the show, I can see how much attention went into detail for their themeing. Every time I go in, there is something new that screams Dr. Who.

The food is very good. The pressed hot sandwiches never fail to impress. I love how we can build our own sandwich - they have many many things to chose from, and it&#39;s a nice &#34;homemade&#34; alternative to Subway. 

While the cafe did recently get wireless to give it more of a &#34;coffeehouse feel&#34;, I would be pleased to find more seating availability. It is always a tight squeeze when eating in there, and sometimes you are pressed to find a seat. 

The atmosphere of the cafe is nice too. You can tell they are working really hard to bring customers and attention to downtown Elgin, as they host improv nights, live bands, etc.

blue-box-cafe-elgin,Pat R.,k7lWsUwe6uUYMkTEVFVwPw,bC62NsAp7L8KxrkwboWwXA,"I came here on a Saturday with my wife and her parents. All of us enjoy Doctor Who to varying degrees, which was a major draw. I love the idea of a geek-themed coffeehouse! 

Now, that being said, this place is not just for fans of Doctor Who, it&#39;s actually a really great cafe, that has an tasteful geek slant.

I went in expecting to be surrounded by inundated with Doctor Who stuff, cluttering the walls and tables, but I was delighted to see that this place has just enough Doctor Who stuff to thrill the fans, but unobtrusive enough to be ignored by someone who is not a fan.

For starters, there&#39;s the staff. They were all charming, fun, sweet, and most importantly, incredibly helpful and professional. Whoever hired this staff should be a hiring consultant for other coffee shops. We also took a moment to speak with the owner, who was working with his staff on the front lines, not just sitting back watching, which shows you his devotion to his craft. He was also a charming, fun, sincere guy, and he was very grateful that we were there. He explained his business philosophy and love for Doctor Who, and it made writing this review much easier. It&#39;s hard not to love someone who loves what he does and does it well.

They use Metropolis Coffee, which is a company based in Chicago, which I absolutely love. I had ordered a couple of shots over ice, (and yes, I know, any coffee geek knows that ice murders a shot, I know, I run a coffeeshop, but I also like what I like) which was made perfectly. Rich and syrupy, and plenty strong. I know what shots of Redline Espresso are supposed to taste like, and the barista who made my shots apparently knows what they are supposed to taste like as well, because it was exactly what I was looking for. The espresso machine they use also shows that they&#39;re not just playing around.

Then there was the food. Holy moley! I&#39;m a fella who loves his sandwiches, and they knocked it out of the park!! I ordered the Elgin Club, and I don&#39;t even remember what was on it (bunch of meat, bacon, and some sort of spicy mayo), and I was entirely blown away. It was out of this world (which makes sense in a sci fi themed cafe)!! Toasted bread, plenty of proteins, and a perfect size. I wasn&#39;t even especially hungry, but I demolished the sandwich and thought about getting another.

Instead I got a couple of pastries!!

They had something that I believe was called a &#34;Magic Bar,&#34; which was like a brownie, but with butterscotch and graham cracker crust. I could probably eat a whole tray of those, and most definitely it would be my undoing. It was rich!

I would contest that the Blue Box is a place for people who like a good cafe, if you like great coffee, great food, and great dessert.

Bonus points if you hail from Galifreyan.",26/05/14,330,5,2,5,21,12.487699999999998,6.707000000000001,0.594,22.699,No,2810

mcdonalds-elgin-6,Wes P.,#NAME?,k3YC8AbWPA-HvoyAtGn4PA,"Everyone,

My own imposed rules for any Chain Restaurant review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Since the food should be the same everywhere, with the exception of regional items, the food category will only be judged on the quality of the expected food (i.e. temperature, consistency, and amount).
3. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

McDonalds - Larkin Ave

Location/Layout - 5.5/10:  This McDonalds is located on Larkin Ave in Elgin, just west of McLean and directly across the street from Larking High School.  The store was recently updated to coincide with the McCafe launch and has a very modern feel along with a small area in front of the washrooms and adjacent to the order counter that is laid out like a coffee house.  With the retrofit they finally moved the fountain from behind the counter and allowed refills to be self service.  There are two drive up lanes, which helps speed up the drive through process but combined with the layout of the building creates an odd parking lot where most of the spaces are a good distance from the entrance; but it is not necessarily a bad thing to get a few steps before or after any meal.  

Service - 3.5/10:  The rating is not reflective of staff which is always expedient and usually very friendly.  The score is due to multiple signs and decisions made by management.  First, there are signs limiting the duration of your stay to no more than 20 minutes.  While I understand they are located across the street from a high school, this does not create the most customer focused environment.  This is even more confusing based on the fact that they built their interior to be a coffee house with WIFI and bench type seating for working on laptops?  Next are the signs limiting refills to one per customer but the fountain is self serve?   Additionally, there is a sign noting the limit of condiments and charges associated with any above &#34;normal&#34;.  Lastly is the choice of TV station.  I am not picking a lane politically and I do believe in an owner&#39;s right to choose their own stations.  But if you want to have news on I feel it should be something like CLTV, The Weather Channel, or a proprietary channel similar to other fast food options so you do not alienate any of your possible clients.  

Food - 5/10: Orders are filled very quick and accurately, especially given how busy this location gets.  The two recent issues I have experienced both have to do with the fries.  First they are always overly salted, which can be rectified if you request a special lightly salted order.  But the bigger issue is that they are always considerably short in volume.  For example a large rarely fills 2/3rds of the container.  The sandwiches on the other hand are very well constructed and often get close to emulating the pictures of the item.        

Overall Experience - 5/10:  On the whole this is a very people friendly and efficient McDonalds.  They always satisfy when you have that Big Mac or QPC craving.  Unfortunately, I also get the McDonalds fry craving only to be left wanting both a giant drink and more fries.",02/07/13,352,3,1,5,1,4.4574,2.764,0.651,27.585000000000004,No,3354

mcdonalds-elgin-3,Wendy G.,45damVfo8aikOmSGFCasBw,toInsRQ8AeTrMpc-hvdsRw,Went to McDonalds drive thru today 9/13 at 12:18am  I ordered 1 fish fillet. 1 Big Mac. 20 piece Mcnugget. I was informed that there was no Fish Fillet after midnight. No problem. I asked to replace the Fish Fillet with either a Big Mac or a Quarter Pounder . I got my order and received the Big Mac and nuggets only. I called back right away. They offered to replace what I was missing although I opted not to drive back. So basically they lost a sale of 1 sandwich. Friends let me tell you. I go everywhere as mystery diner...even a fast food drive thru.

However, this did not change what historically may be the worst McDonald&#39;s on the planet. Frequently, the order is filled incorrectly. There is a dual-lane drive through where one lane is ignored for three or four orders by the order-taker. There is an occasional good employee behind the counter, but by and large, customer service is negligible and borderline rude at times. In spite of the new building, however, most of the parking is located far in back of the building with little room for pedestrians to get to the door. The only reason I ever go in there or drive through at all is because it is close to home, but if I have time and a hankering for McDonald&#39;s, I&#39;ll choose to go across town to avoid this one.

When I got my receipt, I was charged $1 extra for a tiny, tiny juice box (that didn&#39;t even come with a straw, and for anyone who has tried to drink a juice box without a straw, you know it&#39;s a pain), and they gave me a cup of water with it anyway!

Anyone familiar with the area will agree that the Egg Basket on this side of the street is much more visible to a passerby and the ample parking is a welcome change. 

I try avoiding Sunday brunch for obvious reasons but it&#39;s hard saying, &#34;No&#34; to a dad who seldom offers going out for breakfast or spending any time with his elder daughter on the weekends.

When we arrived, it was a full house! Every chair and booth were occupied, except for this makeshift table for two that was tucked away in a corner next to the front desk but situated in a way that whoever sat there would be seen by everyone who entered, exited, walked by and worked at the restaurant. The hostess seemed apprehensive about asking my dad and me if we&#39;d sit there or wait 10-20 minutes... I think she was getting used to being turned down by everyone she asked before us. We&#39;d rather eat than wait to be seated.

The location has changed but everything else about this place is same ol&#39; same ol&#39;... Right down to the coffee refills being slow to come by. The breakfast entrees are average and familiar but cost more than other restaurants with the same concept.

That is why this place is 2.5 - 3 stars. I don&#39;t crave the Egg Basket...",22/04/15,138,3,1,1,-34,0.6023000000000001,0.327,0.20600000000000002,10.466999999999999,No,1334

We went out for breakfast on a Sunday morning and we were seated right away.  I can&#39;t tell if this new location has more seats than the last, but its definitely more open.  It is weird not seeing a huge bar in there though, lol.  We thought maybe thats why they moved so they could have alcohol added to their menu, or maybe their lease was just up.

Waitress was very attentive, especially with coffee.

Now onto the food, my blueberry pancakes were OK, I do love their batter, its nice and thick and has a great crust to it, however, the blueberries were lacking.  Hubby&#39;s skillet was just OK too, he got the country skillet because he felt like some biscuits and gravy action with a little something extra.

I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s because we had been going to their original location for so many years that the new place just seems strange. There&#39;s nothing really wrong with it.  It&#39;s in the old Applebee&#39;s spot so there&#39;s plenty of booths and tables, though it is not as huge of a location as their original so you may be more likely to wait for a table if you come at a peak time.  I do miss the high ceiling and the bright airiness from all the windows at their previous location, though.

With that said - everything I&#39;ve said about their good food &amp; service still stands:

They have a HUGE menu and there are always some specials.  We&#39;ve been coming here for many years and my husband&#39;s family for many more prior to my appearance.  All the servers and staff are very friendly and the food typically comes out pretty quick.

I especially like how many meals (not all, for breakfast &amp; lunch) come with fruit.  It may not say this on the menu but I&#39;ve been surprised a number of times to have two big slices of melon and an orange wedge garnishing my plate.

I haven&#39;t had anything here I didn&#39;t like.  My hubby is a pancake snob, however, and he says their pancakes are &#34;too grainy&#34; for his taste.  I tried &#39;em and they seemed like fine normal pancakes to me.  I really love their French Toast.  Big, thick fluffy slices cooked to golden perfection.

My husband and I have a tradition of going for breakfast after voting and before work each election day and we decided to give this place a try.  The ambiance itself is fine, lots of tables and a decent amount of folks talking over coffee and eggs, and no wait,  but that could also have been due to it being a Tuesday.  

Our server was friendly enough and the menu was large.  I asked what her favorite omelette was and ended up going with her suggestion.  But it&#39;s now Saturday and I can&#39;t remember the name even though half of it is still in my fridge and won&#39;t be eaten at this point.  What I do remember is that the omelette was pretty unmemorable.  

And that is the word that can basically sum up all of our food: unmemorable.  The hashbrowns were just ok, the pancakes also ok, the slice of melon that came with my meal,  warm,  definitely not fresh,  and therefore gross.  My husband opted for a turkey sandwich and fries and wasn&#39;t thrilled about the portion.  He did say that the turkey tasted real as opposed to like lunch meat so I guess at least there&#39;s that? 

If I lived in a small town and didn&#39;t have any other breakfast restaurant options, I would be alright with going to the Egg Basket.  At least once in a great while.

Today I visited the new spot for the first time after my 10k muddy race I did along with my family, and as any runner or athlete would relate, after a good and rough workout, one is starving. I ordered a vegetable omelette which turned out to be a avocado omelette because I ordered to put avocado on my omelette (which the veggie doesn&#39;t have), and substituted hash browns with fresh fruit which was very fresh and very delicious. 

Will definitely keep coming back to this place because it&#39;s my to go spot after a race I have.",01/06/14,107,5,1,3,7,2.4747,1.109,0.291,6.599,No,1036

My eggs were over cooked and they yolk was hard. The star in my opinion should be the avocado, however the wee an afterthought. They were 3 slices of an avocado on the side of the skillet.

As mentioned in other reviews, that&#39;s a busy time and we had a 10 minute wait.  They handed us one of those buzz round discs (which weren&#39;t working) but it was numbered and the hostesses regularly kept coming outside when a table freed up to find the group who was next.  (Was obvious they&#39;ve done this before as they had the system downpat really well)

This was our first visit to Egg Basket ever (though we&#39;d eaten at the old location they took over, which was an Applebee&#39;s many times).  Service was good though tables were a little cramped, especially if/when there are little ones standing in the narrow walkway.

Two of us ordered skillets and they arrived hot and well cooked.  Someone else ordered an omelette which was also well prepared, as was the 4th meal.

The only interesting thing was the omelette order asked for &#34;half cheese&#34; (he has lactose issues with too much dairy) and the waitress who took our order immediately mentioned she&#39;d write it down but not to be surprised if they didn&#39;t do it.  She didn&#39;t say if that&#39;s cause of the cooks being so busy OR if it&#39;s because the cooks don&#39;t like special orders.  As she warned, the omelette did come with the full cheese.

The waitress, overall, was friendly and competent.  One person asked some questions and she was able to answer them, discussing what the ingredients were and how they were prepared very well.

At one point, I actually said to him, &#34;It feels like I am eating at Jewel-Osco.&#34; The tuna salad sandwich was plain - it needed significantly more seasoning, crunchy, not limp, lettuce and another tomato. The sides were nothing to write home about, and the iced tea, which is apparently a specialty, was so lacking in flavor that I did not even bother finishing it.

On the flip side, the service was really wonderful, especially considering this is a best casual dining spot. So we waited in the lunch line for 10 minutes, when we did finally get up to the counter, the cashier was polite and friendly. Our food came out quickly, and we were checked upon several times at the table by other staff members. I did appreciate that attention, although it was not necessary.

We went at an off time around 4PM...this is our summer routine.  They stay up until 3AM and wake up at about 11AM, so lunch is around 4PM.  Haha.  Anyway, it wasn&#39;t busy at all because of the oddball timing.

My daughter had the broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl, not anything remarkable, but fine.      My son and I both ordered the 2 For special where you can choose 2 of the following: 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 spud, 1/2 salad, or soup.  I ordered the Reuben and a Roast Beef Spud and my son chose the Club and Bacon/Cheese Spud.  I&#39;m not sure if they just gave us a whole potato because of the time of day or if this was a half order, but the potato was huge.

The Reuben was okay; the bread was not grilled, more like toasted.  I am an avid Reuben fan and this was edible, but nothing special.  The baked potato I had was topped with small pieces of roast beef, grilled onions, and cheese.  It was fine, but there was a weird smell I got a whiff of in a few bites.  It may have been whatever the onions were grilled in, but it was a little off-putting.  My son said his club sandwich and bacon cheese potato were fine.

The food wasn&#39;t terrible. I&#39;ll give them that. It wasn&#39;t great, but it wasn&#39;t terrible. Our big takeaway was that mostly everything tasted wet. My second-shot at the Four Cheese Griller was served on a different bread than the first time around, and although I&#39;m not sure how that happened -- the first bread turned out to have been better. We ordered some veggie nachos to share but the nachos turned out to be not-so-veggie so I can&#39;t comment on those. I did actually get my side of mac and cheese this time, and it was both mac and cheesy. 

Once again, the biggest issue we had with McAlister&#39;s was the service. We ordered a gallon of sweet tea to go at the register, and all three of us heard the girl behind the counter instruct another worker to go get the tea. Somehow, it didn&#39;t seem to register with him (even though she said it twice). Still, we had to wait for our food anyway so I didn&#39;t really see it being an issue. Spoiler alert: I was wrong. 

Fast forward to picking up our lunch and there&#39;s still no tea to be seen. We stood at the counter waiting with our bags for a few minutes and no one seemed to notice. It felt like the giant plastic bags in our hands were acting as some sort of super-powered invisibility cloak to the staff. I spotted a random tea-jug up at the ordering station and watched as a couple of people ordered and left it behind. Eureka! Our tea! I finally called down to the person working behind the register and asked him if it was ours. He shrugged and carried it down to us, and this is where things get weird. 

He plopped (yeah, plopped. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever used that word but it&#39;s totally accurate here) our jug down on the counter and walked away without saying a word. Normally, whatever. Plop my tea. I was waiting for it anyway and my food is getting cold. 

However, I felt like this jug could have used some instruction and/or an apology/basic acknowledgement of the fact that this tea varied somewhat from the menu photo. Apparently, they&#39;d run out of lids for the gallon bottles, so someone had taken a piece of plastic wrap and put it over the top, wrapping it with a rubber band to &#34;secure&#34; the liquid. If you know anything about transporting liquids, this is obviously not a strategy for success. Since we were driving a Jeep home, it definitely made for a memorable experience.  

We stared at it for a minute, then back to the staff (who were once again oblivious to our presence), and then collectively gave up on McAlister&#39;s. It was like our will to want them to try just eased out of us like a sigh. We still drive by every so often and discuss how we wish we could just eat at McAlister&#39;s already, but at this point I&#39;d honestly rather make the 6-hour drive to Missouri for the same food with some decent service.

mcalisters-deli-geneva-2,Scott S.,LodifWEyEUgCn9bccuR4MA,jNA-TKBGzddhtp5ctL1PTg,"I was curious about this place opening.  I&#39;ve had never heard of them and didn&#39;t know it was a chain from the south. 
First impression walking in. .it was busy, they had only been open about a week or so. They really looked like they were trying to be a more modern version of Papers Bread. There was modern music on the speakers, which Panera is more like a library.

Pretty straight forward menu. I am still unaware that its a chain mind you.  I liked the options on the baked potatoes and the pasta selections.

After a pretty long  in line I started to get that chain store feeling. Ok our turn at the register...I&#39;m ready.
I go for the Memphis..turkey, ham, roast beef and provolone on a wheat roll. I opt for the potato salad side and a bowl of chili. My wife goes for the Reuben sandwich and a cup of chicken dumpling soup quick is an extra $3.50. My son gets the four cheese grilled cheese with chips. The drinks are 32 oz and they get it for you, which adds to your time at the register. The offer free refills on the sweet tea, which I got but who&#39;s getting a refill after the 32 oz bucket of tea? 

You them take your drinks to a table if you can find one and wait for the servers to bring your food. We found a nice high top table in the front. Service was a bit slow and disjointed, but they are new and probably still working out the bugs.  We kept getting a server asking us if we ordered the cup of extra mayo.  We had no food on our table yet!

The good finally was dropped off and looked good. The meat seemed to be a decent quality, you gEt a decent amount of meat on thevsandwiches (unlike Panera, where you have to search for the meat) the sandwichesv actually looked like the pictures! lthe bread wasn&#39;t artisan as Panera but good. Soft and fresh. Here&#39;s where the chain store feel comes into light. 
The soup. ..plain and very tasteless with huge noodles taking up most of the small cup. The chili...definitely bought in a huge can and warmed up. The quality and taste is more like you&#39;d find in a hospital cafeteria. Certainly industrial grade. Disappointing.  The chips my son  as his side were plain Jay&#39;s chips.  No options here. Just plain Jay&#39;s. At least at Subway you get a choice.
The potato salad was the highlight! You get a nice size scoop,  not to big,  not to little. Great taste and texture.
Don&#39;t get me wrong. . Sandwiches were good..almost very good but at $11.00 per person, I&#39;m expecting very good. 

I decided to take the chili home so I had to go up and wait in the line and asked for a take home container for a bowl of chili.  The young server said yes they have a container and then stared at me.  After an awkward couple of seconds she asked if I wanted one. .yes I do, I replied. She turned to the people in the kitchen to get the bowl.  The guy said ok do I want a lid. Yes I do I replied. A lot of work for just  ok chili. 
Dont get me wrong, they do a nice job and things will get better as they are trained and open for a bit. The food is good and I will be back to try the potato options. They can get rid of the take home Styrofoam containers. Don&#39;t be like everyone else.  
They do a good job for what they do but because they are a chain they they aren&#39;t striving  to be great or different. I was hoping for great.

I took my order to go, but did not call in advance- so walked up to the counter and ordered like everyone else. I came around dinner time on a weekday, and there was only a short line. I had my food in hand only 10 minutes after I ordered, which I thought was reasonable. I had the McAlister&#39;s Club- which is a fairly typical sandwich- and it was delicious. I also liked the cole slaw and potato salad we had as sides. My husband had a spicy chicken hot sandwich- and he said his was good too (fairly typical deli fair). My favorite thing at McAlister&#39;s is the cheesecake- and I was so glad to see that this location had it on the menu. The serving is fairly large, so my hubby and I split a piece- it was just as delicious as I remembered from college years ago!

My sandwich was also large enough that I had leftovers for lunch today- my husbands was not and he was able to finish his in one serving.

Thick corn beef sandwichs, pastrami and large juicy dill pickle spears tantalize my fantasies.... Forget it, it ain&#39;t happening here. This place is a fast food version of a lower class Panera. Wait in line, order from a gigantic menu board and they bring to your table. I ordered the grilled chicken with lettuce, tomato and Swiss cheese with honey mustard sauce on a croissant.  Served with a pickle spear that was a dried out pretender of a pickle and chips. The &#34;chicken breast&#34; was a small 3 inch square and 1/8 inch thick piece of chicken. Mixed in with rectangular pieces of chicken. Poor would be a compliment. And no Swiss cheese. I guess they forgot that. The croissant seemed to be day old the way it fell apart. The wive had half a tuna fish salad sandwich and a cup of tortilla soup. Yea, the tuna was very good. Small as could be but tasty. The soup was not a soup but a thick gravy that was really tangy with very little taste except hot. Her pickled pear was about 3inches long and dry as a bone. A large ice tea (which was good) and a dry raisin oatmeal cookie finished it off. That meal was $19.00. It wasn&#39;t worth it. I wasn&#39;t impressed at all.

Other nitpick is, one time I had a baked potato (baked, not microwaved!) and it was a big overbaked--I enjoy eating the potato skin and this one was &#34;crispified.&#34; But the potato itself was delicious.

This is by far our favorite breakfast restaurant. They serve breakfast and lunch, but there are so many delicious breakfast options, we haven&#39;t gotten through all of them yet! 
The &#34;Eggs &amp; More&#34; options are outstanding. Hash browns are always cooked to perfection, the bacon is thick and perfectly and evenly cooked, eggs are fresh and also always good.
Steak and eggs - OMG amazing!
Chicken and waffles- this was new for us and delicious! 
The kids portions are also very generous. Pigs in a blanket, Mickey Mouse pancakes, all so good!
I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t point out the BEST SERVERS AROUND, particularly, GINA.
Talk about attentive service with a smile! She remembers her customers name, their stories from the last time she saw them, and she&#39;s just an all around awesome lady.

You can see from looking here that their food is good - on any given weekend morning, the line is literally out the door. 
I agree, the food is good.  Up until out last visit, we were customers for life.  
On our last visit, my entire family had hair in their food.  Multiple hairs.  DISGUSTING.  The waitress seemed annoyed when we showed her and asked for a manager.  When the manager came over, she too seemed annoyed that we didn&#39;t want to order something else.  
What a terrible experience.  We plan on never going back again, which is too bad because the breakfast is quite good.  
The manager really made no attempt to fix our situation other than to ask if we wanted something else.  Would YOU want something else after you got hairy pancakes and eggs?  Yeah, neither would I.  Very disappointing.

We showed up on a Sunday mid morning. Packed!  We were only 2, so the wait was reasonable. 

Fast service, good coffee. I love that, since for me breakfast is only food without good coffee.

The food portions were huge! I had seafood egg Benedict. I am a big fan of eggs Benedict. I opted to try something funky.  I was not impressed with the size and or temperature of the seafood. It was cold and so small!  But the sauce was great! 

The hash browns, which my dinner partner had go on and on about were perfect! Get them eith the cheese and onions! The bomb!

They weren&#39;t very busy for a breakfast restaurant at noon which was I guess good but surprising. I&#39;m used to the insanity at Wildberry where you wait outside for 3 years before you get a pancake. The menu was pretty average for a breakfast restaurant. The standard fare of pancakes, eggs, french toast and skillets. I really couldn&#39;t get over how cold I was to enjoy my breakfast. They had waffles that had bacon cooked into them that we&#39;re pretty good but overly salty. And the chicken that came with the waffles was more a chicken stick than an actual chicken breast. I had the two eggs bacon and pancake combo with upgraded chocolate chip pancakes. My pet peeve is when chocolate-chip pancakes don&#39;t actually have chocolate chips baked into them. I think only one pancake actually had chocolate chips and the other just had them sprinkled in between the layers. The whipped cream was good on the pancakes and the pancakes themselves were fluffy I just hate a misrepresented meal.

My standard order is the Gyros Omelette, which comes with tomato, onion, and feta. The combination of the savory gyro, tied with the creamy sharp feta, makes it such a tasty breakfast dish. Plus the portion is huge!

Once I came in, I saw a familiar face and that was a friend of mine that used to go to college with so that was really nice seeing her again. Despite that the restaurant was packed they sat us right away the first thing I noticed was the coffee cups they weren&#39;t those little cups you usually see in the breakfast places. These cups were huge and they kept it full. We were ready to order and about 15 minutes later our food arrived. Outstanding service.

Now to the good part (the food). I order the baby spinach and gruyere omelet with hash browns and wheat toast. Hash browns.... the best hash browns I&#39;ve had in my entire life the crispness of it and the flavor it&#39;s perfect and not to greasy like other restaurants. Now the omelet, it might look small and not very filling but trust me it fills you up. But the eggs are nicely cooked along with the cheese and spinach .

I looked up reviews, had a good rating on Yelp, so we headed over! The parking lot was jammed packed so we were a bit worried about the wait but with all the people waiting it was only 10 minutes for the three of us.

Service wasn&#39;t very friendly or very fast but it was decent enough. We didn&#39;t have silverware - had to ask twice to get some, also, but all in all was decent enough.

I ordered the Meat Lovers Omelette which had ham, bacon, sausage. It was very tasty but I had to pay extra to get cheese in it...Seems a bit strange to pay extra for cheese in an omelette, but whatever. It was a bit dry but overall the flavors were good. I was able to change out the pancakes that came with my meal for Ghirardelli Chocolate Chip Pancakes. Oh my goodness, they were absolutely delicious pancakes! They also have chocolate batter pancakes but I think I made the right choice in going with the chocolate chips. They were sooo crazy chocolatey! It also came with grits which were meh. Not the best I&#39;ve had and not the worst I&#39;ve had....they tasted a bit rubbery to me though.

I also got a Ghirardelli Hot Chocolate which was topped with a ton of whipped cream, Christmas sprinkles, a candy cane and chocolate syrup. It was huge, so tasty and so rich! Absolutely delicious but this was a chocolate overload for breakfast! 

This was a massive amount of food---way too much! I ended up taking most of it home because the hot chocolate was so filling.

I think the food is very hit or miss here...what&#39;s good is amazing and what&#39;s miss is just very mediocre.

So we were seated within 10 minutes.   Staffs were very helpful and friendly.  Although they were super busy, they did take time to answer questions and make short friendly conversations.  Unfortunately, it was a different story with the front receptionist.  She had no energy and forced smiles briefly.  We felt like we were bothering her and made us feel unwelcome.  Not exactly the magic I was looking for but I guess she was tired.  So we pushed on and decided to enjoy our lunch anyway.
           
         The restaurant was clean and modern but somewhat loud.  When we were seated at a booth, we had to really pay attention to each other to understand.  But we weren&#39;t there for conversation anyway.  I ordered a Denver Skillet and she had a specialty French Toast that was on separate menu.  My Denver Skillet was pretty decent but her french toast was just way too sweet.  Even wtih side berries and fruits, it was really hard to digest.  Perhaps that french toast was meant for a kid or a teenager.  Thankfully, coffee helped kill some of that sweetness.  By the way, coffee tasted really good.  Portions were generous and I eneded up taking some pancakes that came as side with my Denver Skillet home.

Once our order was taken the food runner was the last person we saw until we were nearly done; no checkup from the waitress to make sure the order was correct or to ask for additional items.  Also had no water refills until we were ready for the check.  The place was emptying out and them the waitress started come back around, so either she was a little spacey or they were understaffed that morning.

Pancakes were as good as were in the old place, and the menu seems to have expanded, with a larger kitchen most likely.  I opted for the seafood omelet which can sometimes be a risky maneuver but it was done really well.  The side of wheat toast was burnt, but we sort of laughed at the irony.

It has been in the area for years, but for some reason this was a first time visit for me. The restaurant itself is quite large, with lots of areas for seating - it was also quite busy on a Friday evening and did require a reservation for a our party of 6. All the food we tried was delicious 

We got the following: 
- Avocado wontons 
- Chopped salad (half-portion) 
- Eggplant parm
- Gnocchi 

Everything was absolutely delicious, and all of us left stuffed and satisfied. The portions are very large - we did more of a &#34;family style&#34; dinner, given the large portion sizes. We had very little food left over. We also ordered dessert - a slice of the salted caramel cake. The cake slice itself was huge, and we weren&#39;t able to finish it between the 6 of us, but it was definitely worth it!

Service was flippant and dismal. We were seated, and 15 minutes later our server returned for our drink order and to give us the specials. By that time we had already decided on entrees.

We shared the Italian Beef rolls appetizer.

Verdict: Okay if you&#39;re an Italian Beef fan (obv.). I thought they were alright.

I had the Skirt Steak entree.

Verdict: Pretty darn good, actually, and cooked medium rare as I requested.

Service was SLOW, though, throughout the entire night.  We had to ASK for more drinks, which any good server would be sure to hone in on without prompting (alcohol = $).

We came here for an anniversary dinner and we thought it would nice. Zeal. Sounds as fancy as Jack&#39;s Bistro. And it was fancy. Light up menus. Sweet decor. Damn good free bread. But that&#39;s about where it ends. Hell, before it even began, the booth they say us at was dirty. We had to clean the seats ourselves. The hostess had on tiny booty shorts. I mean if I wasn&#39;t on a wedding anniversary dinner.... Errrrr.... Pardon me as I get slapped. ---- anyways, the waitress was about as helpful as a nun at a whore whorehouse. She forgot the bread that went with the oil. My wine glass was empty for about 10 minutes before it was filled up, and she didn&#39;t really eat meat so couldn&#39;t offer suggestions. And she was slow. On the contrary, the waitress the table behind us was amazing. Explained the entire menu to her guests so thoroughly that I ended up listening to her suggestions. 

The food...

Burnt pasta. It was ok. Needed salt. The caramelized crust was reminiscent of Burts pizza. :( But it lacked salt. Maybe I have an issue. I need more salt on everything. So I thought....

Lobstersicle. Waitress probably should have told me it was skewered before I bit it off in my mouth. It&#39;s was ok. A bit too fried. A bit too $17. No worth it. 

The tortaralle 4 cheese pasta. Again, nothing I can&#39;t make at home. Boring. 

Lamb shank. For the first time in a long time, food was too salty. Couldn&#39;t eat it. It was supposed to be sauted in garlic. Maybe they used Garlic salt. Minus the garlic....The potatoes that came with it tasted like dried flake potatoes. But there were chunks in it so idk. 

Dessert: yea we were hoping for some kinda complimentary anniversary dessert. None came and we weren&#39;t impressed with food as it was so we head over to baskin Robbins for $1.31 scoops. Bullshit because multiple Yelp reviews said they give complementary dessert for occasions and the table behind us with the awesome waitress got some for a birthday.

There are two portion sizes here: generous (sharing plates/lighter bites) and enormous (entrees - see photo.)  There had to be over a pound of pasta in the dish.  The huge portions weren&#39;t just for the pasta though... I had a ribeye steak that was much larger than the price tag.  Almost everyone at the table had a doggie-bag.

Chef Vince visited our table as our dinner was coming out, and then again at the end of the meal to ensure everyone enjoyed.  He even treated the bride-to-be to a complimentary dessert cocktail, which everyone at the table got to enjoy a sip of.

The entrees at the table were the Grouper, served over angel hair pasta. Seasoned with herbs and lemon. The fish is very light and melts in your mouth. It was great.
The Veal Special served with roasted veggies and rositto. The veal was a bit chewy but very good as well.  There was another special which was a pasta dish served with seafood: mussels, clams, lobster, shrimp, and calarmi. This was again very tasting. The lobster was delicious.

Their cocktails are unique and very tasty, about $8 a drink. 

The appetizers are also pretty unique. I had the lobstericle which is like lobster on a stick deep fried. This was ridiculously yummy. You only get one but it&#39;s huge, also $17. It comes with two sauces and one has a decent spice. I also tried the calamari &#34;fries&#34; which are huge pieces of calamari fried. My friends had the burnt pasta. That was tasty but not as &#34;burnt&#34; or crispy as we were expecting.

For dinner I had the sea bass which was phenomenal. Well prepared. Others had steak and sliders. Everyone loved their meals.

Food... I ordered an old favorite... grilled calamari steaks.  The pic I have loaded from last year, was what I loved. WAS amazing... what I got tonight, was with overcooked limp and soggy artichokes(?).. no peppers to be seen. So utterly tasteless... salt and pepper didn&#39;t do any good. Balsamic didn&#39;t do much either.

The half order of a kale salad was equally awful... the only good item at dinner was the bread.

Figured the gelato was going to be decent... it was not. Got pistachio and salted caramel. Bland and blander...  was my memory wrong? Did I imagine that the last time.. this dessert had lines of swirled caramel, whipped cream and a layer of caramel corn at the bottom? I think I found one piece.

The restaurant is decorated very nicely and it&#39;s lit just perfectly, a little dim. 
We were seated and were given a drink menu. I went with a martini called the Razzle Dazzle. My friend got a margarita. 
My drink was just ok, nothing to exciting. 
We sat for a long time talking and catching up before even opening the menu. Our server was nice and gave us time to talk and never tried to rush us at all. 
After forgetting that we hadn&#39;t ordered yet, we opened the menus to see what we would order. The menus light us, pretty cool, lol. 
I went with the marinated skirt steak with a side of roasted potatoes and Brussel sprouts. 
My steak was absolutely perfectly seasoned and cooked medium rare just the way I like it. It was a decent size of steak and it was tender I probably could have cut it with just my fork. My sides were just ok, roasted potatoes are roasted potatoes, they tasted like the ones I make in my oven and the Brussel sprouts were a bit dry and flavorless for my taste.
The menu has a lot to offer and they had daily specials posted in a chalkboard on a wall. 
The service was ok, we were left alone for a while. 
There was a live band playing in the bar area which was very crowded and it sounded like everyone in there was having a good time. 
This is on my list of places to try again. There were many dishes that sounded delish.",01/08/16,180,4,2,5,18,5.6498,3.483,0.511,17.006,No,1580

Thursday night at 7:30pm was not too busy. Bar was hopping and the live entertainment was a bonus, although we dined in the restaurant proper.

The chicken was nothing to write home about.  The service is outstanding, the restaurant is beautiful and the menus set the stage for an unforgettable experience....that just never came.

zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,Lucas C.,#NAME?,LFJ5vojTer1b6lQtDbl5ig,"Had pretty high expectations based on the reviews and the upscale look, and it was alright. 

Food- We started off with 3 appetizers.  Asian pork wings, guacamole wontons, and the &#34;burnt pasta.&#34;  The wings were just decent but they were definitely more like short ribs than wings.  The wontons I thought were awful because they for some reason were so sour!  The burnt pasta was good but it was basically just baked spaghetti, nothing too special.  The highlight honestly was the fresh baked bread and premixed balsamic, Parmesan, crushed red, and olive oil.  For dinner I had the filet trio, with horseradish steak butter crust.  It was pretty good, the steak was cooked well but wasn&#39;t very moist.  The mashed potatoes were smooth, but lacked flavor, could&#39;ve used some garlic and left the skins in.  The asparagus was burnt on purpose but I didn&#39;t like that.  Everyone else seemed ok, but not thrilled with their dish.

Service- Good, water and bread refills often

zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,Taylor D.,kwNZdModA-g0j3bCbxwQaA,ZAno_U6kzuCrexOAawL3Sw,"I went in here two Thursdays ago for the first time ever. It is a very nice place I will give it that.

I ordered two drinks that came out to $13.44, I tipped $4.00 for a total of $17.44. When I was checking my bank account this past week  and they charged my account $18.00. It wasn&#39;t a big deal, it&#39;s only 56 cents so I wasn&#39;t even irritated. 

I used to be a waitress so I know it&#39;s super illegal and not allowed to charge anything but the amount written on the credit card slip. So I called them Thursday to let them know that it happened and that if it happened to the wrong person it could really mess up their business. 

When I called and asked to speak to the manager I was put on hold for a few minutes and when the person came back to the phone they told me that they couldn&#39;t find a manager and asked why I was calling. I told them everything that happened and they took my name and number and said a manager would call me back.

It is now Saturday and I have not heard back from anyone. I am wondering if they just threw away my message and didn&#39;t even hand it to a manager. 

This is what irritated me and made me decide to come to Yelp. I wasn&#39;t even mad about the 56 cent extra charge nor did I want to do anything about it but let them know it happened. I wonder how many other people they have falsely charged. It is not right and I should have received a call back. I was already generous with my 4.00 tip which one was a beer, so they only had to make one drink and hand me a bottle of beer. 

I seriously wish I never came to this place and will not be returning, very unprofessional.",20/02/16,162,1,1,1,-13,0.12869999999999998,1.188,1.242,14.57,No,1633

Out waiter, Todd was fabulous.  He was very attentitive, but not overly so.  

We began with a mojito for my mr and the house martini for myself.  It was amazing. I now need to make fig infused vodka at home. 

We opted for no appetizers, but I did get the gf bread for an extra 2.5.  I may have been judged, but it said seconds were included so I asked for my second serving. Carbs. Biotches. 

For entrees, my husband got the pasta special Diablo something and I got the gluten free chicken parm. Both entrees were very good.  I only had a bite or few of mine though as I loaded up on a loaf of bread first. 


We ended our meal with gluten free chocolate cake...because chocolate and two cappuccinos. We ended up bringing the cake home but drank our cappuccinos.

Their craft cocktails such as the Cremenza are delicious and will set you back $8--which is pretty standard for Schaumburg. The Cremenza is a sweet martini with fig infused vodka. The sweetness is subtle compared to a Cosmo. The seafood bisque was creamy, spicy and was perfect for a rainy fall night. There were yummy chunks of lobster and shrimp in it. The veal chop was just a tad dry but had a great caramelization on the outside. The bread is cutely served on a cutting board with a knife that fits into it. The bread is served with a pretty dip of oil, balsamic, freshly cut basil, Parmesan and red pepper. SO GOOD!

What I had at the restaurant wasn&#39;t bad (chicken parm - make sure to order with the housemade Suprema sauce as it absolutely has a leg up on standard marinara), and the portions are heaping - the menu does come across as unwieldy and somewhat unfocused. It is an &#34;Italian-themed&#34; place, but they must offer over 40 items. They offer steaks/chops and seafood, tapas/small plates style items, entrees, sliders, make your own pasta dishes, large salads etc. It&#39;s good to have a lot of options, but this might be too much - you don&#39;t want to spread yourself to the point of being considered an upscale Cheesecake Factory.

Easily found location in Mall drive near Woodfield Mall.. We had a reservation at 615pm.. Came in at 610pm and was immediately seated.. It was not full yet that time so the hostess was kind enough to give us a booth when we requested it.. 
Menu, both the main and dessert/drink was illuminated.. Very unique..
Ambience was loud dimly lit but i loved it... 
Food::: We ordered the Calamari Fries as appetizers.. Well seasoned and i love the breading... And the Gnocchi supereme.. As it was described, light.. And so creamy... I love it... A dish that i will be ordering repeatedly..
The complimentary freshly baked bread and the olive oil dipping with Balsamic vinegar was sooo good... 
Entrees:: Zuppa de Peche was also good, lobster was on a tad overcooked side.. But flavors was great... The sauce did not overpower the seafood.. Briciole.. I love the tanginess and thickness of the sauce.. 
Clean washrooms and since you have a garlicky breath after a meal, they have a complimentary mouthwash.. Which is a first for me.. You know that the restaurant was well thought of...
They have musical guests that starts every 8pm.. Unfortunately we were leaving when they started..
I was going to give it a 5 stars, but it was our server who disappointed me... He forgot things and would check on us for after a little bit of a wait... Good thing other servers checked up on us and was kind enough to give us extra bread with our to go bag... All in all, a GREAT EXPERIENCE...  And would come back again...

zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,Bonnie T.,rujCNZstE4NNFjy4A5aEow,Oz6W-QUE_m2U4LH7GCy6LQ,"I don&#39;t even know where to begin. I wish I was able to give zero stars. We came here a birthday party. I get it. We are a huge party. Things won&#39;t be as smooth as it would be if the waitress waited on a group of 4 instead. However, that doesn&#39;t mean we get to be forgotten or treated any worse. 

1. I got seated and she does her round for drinks. I asked for a Shirley temple and she gives me a bizarre look like I was from another planet. It&#39;s not that uncommon. 

2. We have been seated for 25 minutes now and bread was still in the process of being handed out. That&#39;s fine, too. I understand since we were a larger party, things would take some time to fully satisfy everyone. 

3.  I asked for a refill and waited ages before I was able to get one. This is probably my biggest pet peeve. I shouldn&#39;t have to ask for a refill and she should notice this without me even bringing it up to her attention. 

4. We finished our round of bread, and I had asked if we could get another set since its been an hour and we haven&#39;t gotten our food yet. She refills everyone&#39;s bread plate except mine. Again, I thought she was going to get more bread for me since she ran out right when she was at my end of the table. Oh silly me... I should never assume. 

5. Finally! The food! For the price we paid, we did receive a huge portion. I can&#39;t complain about that. It wasn&#39;t the best thing I&#39;ve had but at least I paid for what I was given. However, the waitress spills the birthday girls wine on her to go box and cake. What does she do? She brings another glass for her. Sounds responsible and appropriate, right? Well, she never cleaned up the table and just left that glass of wine there as well. So not only did her personal items ended up getting wet from the dripping table but now her cake wasn&#39;t even replaced either since its drenched full of wine. 

6.  I finally got tired of it. It&#39;s fine to disappoint me but when you make the birthday girl upset, you&#39;re ruining something that she chose to celebrate her day at your restaurant. I go over to the hostess and ask for the manager on duty. She says to me &#34;mistakes happen, right?&#34; Yes, I do agree mistakes happen, but you also have to please your guests when you made a mistake. Ruining her belongings wasn&#39;t a part of her plan. Not being able to have the rest of her cake (not comped for the spill or the ruined cake FYI). I thought that was ridiculous. 

7. My final upsetting experience. I had asked for the chef to call me since I am obviously upset by my experience and I have yet to receive a call. No wonder this restaurant has terrible service. I don&#39;t want a refund or a gift card or anything. I just want this experience to never happen to anyone else.",25/01/16,307,1,1,1,-6,0.09349999999999999,4.614,3.6690000000000005,35.717000000000006,No,2786

Not as many choices for wines as I would have liked but the Chianti I had was quite good.

3 out of the 4 of us really enjoyed our meals: chicken parm, lobster roll sliders &amp; the porcini pasta bags arrabiata.  2 surprises with my porcini arrabiatta - it was in the 1/2 plates section &amp; holy cow - it is easily 4 servings! I took most of it home and it will make at least 2 dinners for the Hubs &amp; I.  Second surprise was the $22 price tag on the dish so at least for that price you get plenty of food.  The lobster roll said it came with either tater tots or shoestring fries &amp; the Hubs opted for shoestring fries - though they were anything but, just the size of regular fries and not the thin ones you would expect with &#34;shoestring&#34; in the description.

My father-in-law said his bracciole was just &#34;okay&#34; and that it had way too much bread crumbs.  But that didn&#39;t stop him from cleaning his plate, either.

We also shared the calamari fries which were tender &amp; plentiful for $8.95.  And they give you warm bread with a plate of olive oil, parm, herbs &amp; balsamic for dipping which was quite tasty.

Side note - the prices on their website are not current as of this writing.  Several dishes are a few dollars more now than what is listed online (my pasta was $4 more than the web lists it as) so they need to update their website.

zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,Dan K.,pznDHVHsO1ZbsG7f4TaNRA,Rk5csAzpkkw9v5gcq-ccTQ,"The food was pretty good.  We got a bunch of seafood items.  The server was good and checked up on us.  Pretty casual atmosphere, and a lively place for sure.  

We ordered the seafood tower, along with the grilled calamari, the stuffed sausage and peppers, and antipasto.  Food was pretty good.  The seafood was cold and we polished it off.

When we got the bill we were a bit surprised because the seafood tower was charged at $150.  As of 6/22/2015, the price on the website is $105.  The price on Yelp menu is $105.  The price on opentable is $105.  I understand that menu prices can change but this is a bit much.

Surely there was a mistake in our bill.  We called over the server and he said he had no idea and passed us up to the manager.  Evidently Chef Vince was not there that day, so we talked to the manager.  She was pretty firm and tried to blame us for not calling the restaurant.  She mentioned something about market prices and how we were given a good portion of food.  She said the menu on the website hadn&#39;t been updated in 2 years and should not be relied upon.  Ok, but we preordered off the website/opentable.  But sure, it&#39;s on us to make sure that the price listed is incorrect, right?

If it&#39;s market price, it should probably just be noted as market price.  Regardless, the manager was not very helpful and tried to tell us how it was worth every dollar since she had seen the kitchen putting it together.  Hmm ok, I hope every item on the menu is worth every dollar lol.  We asked for her to meet us in the middle, on a matter of a principle.  She refused.

Regardless, the overall experience was pretty good, but the incident at the end of the visit left us a little salty.  It&#39;s not the kind of service we expected from this establishment, but it is what it is.  I hope they end up changing their online menus to reflect current prices (this isn&#39;t 1999, it should be a fairly simple fix).

zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,Samantha R.,aVIcOkm1VbukZqHXIMqwuw,QL2fWEvKPQ2qKolEzAbIdw,"Chef Vince has done it again! Zeal is the perfect venue for a night out or a romantic meal with your lovebug. 

I went with a few friends for a birthday celebration and the staff was incredibly warm and welcoming. I brought a cake for the party and Chef Vince himself offered to take it back to the fridge for me! A+ service! 

I sat at a booth with my friends and we ordered drinks. Mojitos all around! These came out quickly and were very refreshing! We waited for another member of our party to join us and we ordered our food. I ordered the chopped shrimp cocktail and the lobster sliders. The rest of my table ordered sausage bread, and the stuffed peppers. Everything came out quickly and at the proper temperature. 

Let&#39;s start out with the chopped shrimp cocktail. First off, WOW! This is a huge appetizer! I shared with the table and still had enough to come home. It comes with pretzel bread crostini and I didn&#39;t even bother dipping it in the cocktail, I just ate it with a fork. The cocktail consists of shrimp, avocado, cilantro, and a tangy cocktail sauce that is not your normal cocktail sauce. It tasted very fresh, like it was made in house. The whole appetizer was fresh tasting and not at all soggy. I could have just eaten that. It was amazing. 

My lobster rolls were phenomenal. No faux lobster here! All fresh and delicious. The salad was served on toasted buns and seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper and there was a hint of red pepper in there as well. I opted for the tater tots instead of the french fries, and those were crisp and had great seasoning. Again, a large portion, so I was able to bring a whole lobster sandwich home with me. 

Overall, an excellent dining experience. All of my dining partners said their food was excellent (no one shared hahahaha!) and there were no problems. Our server was very personable and really funny, cracking jokes with us all night. The food was insanely good, I am sitting here wishing I had a lobster roll right at this moment.

We ordered the pork wings (great taste, great sauce) and lobster on a skewer as a starter (soooo delicious, words cannot explain)

Our server, Lauren was really nice and accommodating. 

For entrees we ordered the chilean sea bass, which was very tasty and healthy (Big thing for me when restaurants have very healthy alternatives to the basic pasta and such) my boyfriend ordered the special of the night, which was a pasta with red sauce and seafood blend of Lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, mussels, with large portions WOW very impressed, glad they didn&#39;t skimp out on the seafood. 

For dessert, we ordered chef Vince&#39;s caramel gelato served with popcorn, fantastic pairing and flavor, what a great idea!

Lobster rolls ended up being lobster sliders.  I&#39;m partial to the traditional format of split texas toast bun.  The buns they did use should have had more butter.

The lobster itself was good quality - a few larger chunks but mostly shredded.  They didn&#39;t go overboard with mayo, which I also appreciated.

The place was also pretty empty and a little dark inside.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but made me wonder.

Hubs and I made a reservation for Valentine&#39;s Day dinner. I know I know...a dinner out on Valetine&#39;s Day can be a total mess, but hear me out. The valet (seriously, I was annoyed that there were no parking spots for us, only valet) parked our car roughly 15 feet where we pulled up and we headed inside to a very packed restaurant. The bar itself, off to the right, was quite busy with all the lovebirds swallowing their liquid courage or spicing up their date nights. We hung up our coats in the closet off to the left and were seated on time.

When we got to our booth I was a bit taken aback by the giant, glowing flatscreens situated around the room. When the chalkboard specials up on the wall reflect entrees in the $25-$40 price point, TVs don&#39;t seem to be a great fit for the dining room. It was distracting to say the least. Speaking of distracting, the light up menus were beyond strange. If it&#39;s took dark to read a menu, then maybe better lighting is necessary. Just saying. 

All that being said, the food was fabulous. I ordered the sea bass special that was pretty perfect. It was meaty but flaky and the sauce was divine. Flavor and portions were all in check.  Our server was friendly but incredibly harried due to the influx of holiday diners. 

So, yes, I would certainly go back to Zeal for the food. The ambiance and the occasionally harried service could use a bit of a revamp.",05/05/15,189,4,1,4,-48,3.8876999999999997,3.4350000000000005,1.1820000000000002,17.383,No,1600

zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,PFfZOIcb6oNzyeO_kbTaOg,"Chef Vince does it again -- another great restaurant with a great menu. One thing that definitely stands out about Chef Vince&#39;s restaurants is the value you get (the dishes aren&#39;t really that cheap but you get good portions and good ingredients). Another thing is the use of high quality, fresh ingredients -- so that you don&#39;t have a huge variety of flavors in each dish but rather you get a refined interpretation of the main theme of each dish. The main meat of each dish is represented well without the side dishes or sauces interfering with the experience. With that said, all the side items are always edible and delicious (especially grilled vegetables) so make sure you finish everything on the plate. The interior is very spacious with lots of separated areas and the lighted menus add an elegant touch (although they are a little heavy).

Here were the items I tried:

Bread and olive oil: Nice flavorful bread served with a delicious mix of cheese, basil, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. The star of this is definitely the balsamic vinegar which has a very nice sweetness to it.

Lobstercicle: If you are a shrimp tempura addict, you will undoubtedly be a lobstercicle addict. Meaty chunks of lobster are encased by a fluffy, crispy tempura batter which is very flavorful even without any dipping sauces. 

Grouper francaise: The grouper is nice and firm with large flakes. The mild flavor of the meat is complemented by a mild francaise sauce (lemon, butter, flour, spices) served over a fluffy bed of angel hair pasta.

Pine nuts crusted scallop: Large scallops enveloped in pine nuts, flavored by a delicious balsamic vinegar.

Porkchop vesuvio: Perfectly juicy and tender pork chop -- with a delicious sauce made from garlic, white wine, and olive oil and seasoned with herbs.

Vincenzo pizza fritta: If you think you&#39;ve tried all the types of pizza out there -- you probably haven&#39;t tried pizza that&#39;s both baked and fried... this gives you both a crispy and crunchy texture at the same time -- mixed with delicious fresh ingredients and a slightly sweeter tomato sauce. This one is definitely big enough for 2.

A zeal original: What happens if you mix caramel corn with chocolate with a sea salt caramel gelato? One of the most luxurious gelatos you&#39;ll ever have the pleasure of tasting. This is definitely a must try.

Overall: Great food, great value, great atmosphere. Definitely a great place to take family or friends.",01/09/14,294,5,4,5,112,10.2739,4.9959999999999996,0.267,14.737,No,2470

zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,Melissa H.,YWSutgBd2zGbbCuFxg1EBA,bVD-swtcm_6njHZrFvcKOA,"My husband and I decided on going to Zeal a couple weeks ago for Valentine&#39;s Day dinner. I would like to thank Yelp for helping us find out about this place. I had noticed majority of the reviews for this place being great and that is what made us decide on it. 


We had a 4:30 reservation last night and was running late. We called to let them know and they were very understanding about it. My husband asked the hostess how many reservations they had for the night and she said 400 people are supposed to be there for Valentines Day.....WOW!!! We had an older lady seat us which didn&#39;t bother us at all.....hey, we all have to make a living right?! Good for her to be standing on her feet like that all those hours at her age.


Awesome touch with those light up menus!! It was so unique!!! At first when we sat down it seemed like our server Lauren was rushing us. We get it that she wanted to turn and burn her tables to make more money, but it was our first time dining there. She slowed it down after my husband explained to her that and we wanted to take our time with everything. We felt terrible for her as we saw a lady complaining at the next table over sending her back with food to the kitchen untouched. My husband was in the restaurant industry for over 13 years and both Lauren and my husband had a venting session on how people can be lousy that you serve and nothing you do can make the customer happy

Onto the food....that olive oil balsamic vinegar concoction was like crack!! Super addicting and so good! I swear you could make a meal just from that with their bread. My husband asked Lauren what was in it and she told us. Yes, we&#39;re going to try making it at home with some Italian bread! 

We ordered the Italian beef egg rolls and they were just ok. I think if your a first time diner there I would encourage you to order it, but probably wouldn&#39;t get it again. We also had the Chopped Salad. The nuts in the salad were absolutely fantastic!!!! I&#39;m still thinking of that salad now and how good it was. It looked very similar to the Portillo&#39;s Chopped Salad, but tasted so much better then theirs. The half order would be enough for at least 4 people! I think if we were to come here again we would skip the egg rolls and just get that salad.

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with Angel Hair Pasta. I thought the chicken tasted outstanding with a flavorful egg batter to it.  The pasta wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. My husband who is Italian makes just as good if not better pasta. My husband ordered their Kobe Beef Sliders with Tater Tots. His sliders looked good and dare I say it cute?! They had the Zeal logo on top of the buns. Nice touch! Although I didn&#39;t have a taste of the sliders my husband thought they were very filling. I had one of his Tater Tots and it tasted hot and fresh. 

For dessert we ordered their Zeal signature Chocolate Chip Gelato with Garret&#39;s Popcorn. From the moment I saw a pic of it on Yelp, I knew we had to order it. It was rich, decadent, along with the perfect amount of sweet and saltiness. 

My husband noticed a couple things while we were dining. He didn&#39;t care for the placemats they use at the setting of each table. He was wondering how they clean them....maybe through a dishwasher? We observed a busboy taking a towel and wiping each one off. The husband didn&#39;t think it was very sanitary. Also, he noticed the carpeting.......although it hides dirt.....if wine spilled that carpet would be done for. These two factors is why Zeal gets 4 stars instead of 5. The TV&#39;s I thought were kind of strange in the dining area, but didn&#39;t really bother us. 

Portions are HUGE here which we thought was awesome! I still have leftover chicken and pasta which is enough for lunch today!! Despite those couple things, we enjoyed Zeal and will definitely be coming back here again!!! Once again, Thanks to Yelp and Yelp users for this fantastic recommendation.",15/02/15,435,4,3,5,56,11.131900000000003,7.106,1.153,41.74300000000001,No,3978
zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,Melissa A.,D9i3LUq4UHh9rg62kym8yA,wcLAWfJjLhCiKhx3sYD2Lw,"Chef Vince, you are a godsend!  I&#39;ve been to Zeal twice and am definitely a fan of this restaurant.  Not only is the food delicious but the ambiance and service were great as well!  To start you off, you&#39;re given this bread and olive oil concoction that you could easily make a meal out of because it&#39;s just that good.  This dipping oil isn&#39;t your typical Italian restaurant mix of oil and parmesan cheese.  No, this is 10 times better.  It&#39;s a mix of olive oil with balsamic vinegar which adds a nice tanginess along with parmesan cheese and herbs (basil and not sure what else).  

As for the meal itself, everything is very reasonably priced (possibly too cheap) for quality food and VERY generous portions.  Since I&#39;ve only been here twice I&#39;ve only tried 2 things but I will say both were delicious.  I&#39;ve had the stuffed meatballs ($10 for lunch) and &#34;The Bootie&#34; sandwich($8 Yes, it&#39;s called that and yes my friend giggled like a little schoolgirl when I said the name when ordering haha).  Let me tell you, the portions were so large I barely ate half of my food both times.  I really can&#39;t complain about having too much good food besides it being not so kind on my waistline, but I think it&#39;s worth it!  

The meatballs are stuffed with prosciutto, coppacola, ham, salami, and cheese and served over polenta.  UM YUM?!  You can&#39;t go wrong with those ingredients and I highly recommend trying this dish when you dine here.  The meatballs are tender balls of yummy goodness and the polenta is nice and creamy.  As for &#34;The Bootie&#34;, this is basically an Italian beef sandwich but so much better since they layer Italian beef with cheese and prime rib along with a ton of peppers (your choice of sweet or hot).  To top it off, the sandwich comes with fries or tater tots...and who would ever choose fries over tots?  By the way when they say a side of tots...it&#39;s not really a side but rather another meal.  You will have tots for days!  

So not only is the food and service awesome, but they are also very accommodating which I can appreciate.  My friend wanted to order the meatballs but has aversions to many things one of them being ham, so they were able to prepare special meatballs for her that didn&#39;t include ham!  This was very kind of them and my friend was very pleased.  I definitely will be back so I can eat my way through the rest of their menu!

The entire restaurant was filled with seniors, I am not kidding. So we felt a little out of place there for a date night. Our entire focus then was just on a quality service with good food but... First off, we were seated after a 7/10 mins wait and our server went missing for good 20 mins after giving us the menus. He seemed to be in some sort of hurry to just walk away from us. He better have us not ask any questions at all. By this time, we were completely deflated by our experience. Food arrived 40 mins later and was nothing spectacular(we had the four cheese pasta and the gnochi.). We kept waiting for dessert menu and our server was ready with the check. He was not so happy when we asked him for desert menu(weird). Well, we dived in for another not so good experience, a 10$ glass of gelato with gerret popcorn. How in the world can you mess this up? We got ICED up gelato with stale popcorn in it. Needless to say, we barely ate 1/4th of the disastrous &#39;desert&#39;.

I knew it was going to be a good dining experience when i walked in and said, &#34;This is a carpeted restaurant - this is legit.&#34; 

First, the light up menus had my friends and i excited about our meal experience since it was so unexpected and so very entertaining - it&#39;s like we never dined out before haha. Our waitress was extremely friendly and warm. She patiently explained some of the entree items as well as the specials of the night. She sold my friends and i on almost all the specials.

Bread and olive oil dip (mixture of parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar, and even more) is absolutely delicious AND you can have as much as you want! We couldn&#39;t stop eating it. For dinner, i ordered the Chilean sea bass over a bed of rice and vegetables. The sauce gave the sea bass so much flavor and the fish itself was cooked to perfection - melted in your mouth. The rice had plenty of vegetables and complemented the sea bass nicely. Only complaint is that i wish i had more of it!! 

To top it all off, the bathroom had a mouthwash dispenser! And fresh flowers. All in all, a great experience!",03/03/15,126,4,2,5,18,6.715700000000001,4.049,0.277,10.675,No,1196
zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,H D.,yul_W12pNZ6mmxdSowkNXg,iUF1WsGSw5qdFZ3LExWJlA,"Tonight was my first time here. I&#39;ve got an on the fence opinion of this place. I&#39;m 50/50.
Most of the time your first experience anywhere seals your opinion of it. Buuuut, Given that it&#39;s SO close to Christmas (1 week away) and the location is right at the mall area make me want to give this place a second chance.
For a Thursday night this place was PACKED and overly busy. They probably shouldn&#39;t have taken my reservation because we were seated at a table with 2 normal wooden dining chairs and the rest of our fairly good sized party had FOLDING CHAIRS. Unacceptable.
We were reseated at a table after a party left with all normal chairs.
We got our drinks and appetizers after we were there over an hour.
We got our main courses after we were there over 2 hours.
I never got a drink refill. Nothing complicated about a ginger ale.
I know they were busy. Lots of holiday groups and shoppers. I try and be understanding to that but the other part of me says &#34;no. This is a heavy trafficked area and should be able to accommodate and provide great and attentive service&#34;... Come by the table and ask if you can get anything. Make sure glasses all around are full. Make yourself seen! If a customer needs some thing they can&#39;t even find you to wave you down or signal to you, that&#39;s kind of frustrating.
Service aside, food was pretty good. Our table tried tons of appetizers pretty much one of everything. We shared all our main dishes so we could take a taste of each. I really enjoyed my osso bucco but i really only ate the lamb shank. The meat was amazing. The orzo was salty or had nutmeg in it? Some thing i wasn&#39;t excited about but i ate all my lamb! Hubby had blackened sea bass and really liked it.
We were there for just over 3 hours. We exchanged gifts because it took that long between courses... So,
I think the downers were all due to the holidays. It was too busy. After the holidays on a less busy hour of the day I&#39;d go again. Give them another try. I have a few menu items I&#39;d like to try out.
I am hopefully for my next visit and updating my review to some thing better.",17/12/15,237,3,3,5,51,6.3347999999999995,4.111,1.2990000000000002,29.589999999999993,No,2137

The atmosphere is casual, and at the same time your could get a little dressed up and come here for a romantic dinner. It is dimly lit, but the menus light up (I&#39;ve never seen that before!). Very cool! They have a bar area that plays live music later on at night, but if you sit in the dining area you can&#39;t hear it. 

Our server was really nice, and overall attentive. They did get a little busier later, but she still came around. My friend had ordered the meatballs but forgot to ask for no sauce. Our server took them back and had them make more without sauce without any complaints!

The menu has quite the variety! There are small plates that you can share, or entrees that you can pig out on yourself. There is also a pizza/gluten free menu. They have a lot of items that I have not seen before, and some classics. We ordered the cheesy beef egg rolls, the lobster roll super sliders, Chef Lauren&#39;s stuffed meatballs, chicken parmesan, and the clam special. I was really impressed with everything I tried. It all had great flavor, was filling, and would be something I would order again. There were so many things on the menu that I wanted to order - I will definitely be back! The bread and olive oil/balsamic dipping mixture they give you is REALLY good. I could probably just have a meal of that. They also have a nice wine menu with a variety of prices and flavors.

I think that the prices are pretty decent for what you get. They have cheaper items and more expensive entrees, so there is really something for everyone. I thought it was typical pricing for an Italian restaurant, but better quality of food and more variety that other places I have been to.",14/08/14,195,5,2,5,44,6.9573,3.968,0.176,18.855999999999998,No,1760

zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,Michelle R.,PryX5hX8xZxhtncl8ZMR2A,otSZO4nm6mILsdD2xnF0nA,"I chose this place to host my wedding shower after meeting with Chef Vince. At the first meeting he was very accommodating to my must have sangria and lots of it request. I was also impressed with how personable he was and he even suggested that my fiance and I come in on a later date for a food tasting. 

After that tasting we were sold! The food was AMAZING! I mean, I was initially sold on the bread with olive oil/balsamic vinegar. I would definitely recommend the stuffed peppers app and anything with the suprema sauce. However, for the shower we decided on something lighter, the lemon chicken (which was delicious as well). 

When the shower day came we were a highly disappointed with the EXTREMELY slow start to the afternoon. My friend, who had planned everything, wanted pitchers of sangria and appetizers on each table right at the start of the event. So as people were walking in could they have a drink and something to nibble on. I am not kidding you when I say it took 45, FORTY FIVE minutes to get waters on the table. It&#39;s not like we came in unannounced. I have worked banquets before, you have the waters ready at least 20 minutes before the scheduled event. It&#39;s not like the ice will water it down. 

So, I&#39;m the bride to be and I had to keep asking where the sangria was even after the waters came. (Keep in mind this is the main thing that Chef Vince and I spoke about on our initial meeting) When the pitchers came there was so much ice in them that we could only get 2, three if we were lucky, glasses per pitcher. They brought 4 pitchers for 25 people! I was embarrassed because I, of course, wanted everything to be perfect. It seemed to take forever for everyone to get a full glass of sangria. As soon as we all had full glasses and my sister made the toast it made a turn for the better. 

The mouth-watering food definitely made up for the slow service in the beginning. We all left with stuffed, happy bellies. And, bonus, I got the leftovers!",26/05/15,214,4,1,5,5,4.728199999999999,2.9610000000000003,0.879,20.159000000000002,No,1991

My first Zeal experience was when our office catered in lunch.  Everything I tried was delicious: a really fresh-tasting mediterranean style salad with tiny pasta noodles in it, cheesy delicious foccassia bread, and my absolute favorite was burnt pasta!!   We have some vegetarians (myself included) and gluten-free special diets in our office, and I was very impressed with the owners&#39; and chef&#39;s ability and thoughtfulness in accommodating special diets.

I finally had the chance to visit the restaurant for a coworker&#39;s birthday celebration last week and was equally as impressed with my dine-in experience as I was with the catering.  The space is warm, yet spacious and well laid out.  You can tell a lot of thought was put into the design - so many cute details, from chalkboard walls to the light up menus!  It&#39;s an upscale bar and restaurant, but service is extremely friendly and fun.  There was live music and a small dance floor.  Our table ordered drinks and apps, and everything I tried was SO good: burnt pasta (just as good as I remember it being from the lunch), homemade gnocchi, stuffed artichoke.  Drinks were also great.  My fav was a fig flavored vodka and soda with orange in it.

The head chef and owners couldn&#39;t be nicer; they were mingling with the guests throughout the night.  Chef Vince brought dessert out to our table.

zeal-restaurant-schaumburg,Chez J.,xuCh3rhYJfKh4Xk0g2E7xg,RDCJMv1wOwMSee5qGpG_yw,"In short: friendly and prompt service, unique and classy interior, spectacular food with heaping portions. A must when visiting the Chicago area.

My parents and I were visiting from California. We decided we wanted Italian and settled on Zeal based on Yelp reviews and convenience of location. We called ahead and easily made a reservation same-day. We were greeted by smiling faces and immediately seated. Tim, our waiter, was knowledgeable and offered great insight on menu items. 

We ordered the Lobstercicle and Burnt Pasta to start with a bottle of Chardonnay. Lobstercicle had a great crunch and the Burnt Pasta was addicting. My mom and I shared the Zuppa de Peche and dad had the Lamb Shank. I&#39;m not a big fan of lamb, but it was perfectly cooked - tender and delicious. Zuppa de Peche had a generous amount of seafood. 

And yes, they make Cannoli. This is the best overall meal I&#39;ve had all year. The attention to detail that the staff have is unmatched, and I love the comfortable family-atmosphere.

Last time I tried the chicken portobello it was ok ....not something like the apple walnut salad that I LOVE. I thought they would just grill it and lay it on the chicken.. but they chopped up the mushroom and i mean the sandwich wasn&#39;t all dry but.. needs work.

Cheddar beef on croissant.. was good when I had it months ago.

While people rave about their Italian beef I have always raved about their chicken sandwich. This past summer they stopped serving said sandwich and posted papers telling customers that it was temporary due to the vendor. I was pretty bummed. Finally after months of withdrawals they brought the sandwich back and I&#39;m sad to say it&#39;s a huge disappointment. The flavor of the chicken is not the same and neither is the quality. I&#39;ve had it 3 times from 3 different locations and it&#39;s been bad every time. Very sad . So now I have to find a new item to love. 
Besides the chicken sandwich my favorites are the crinkly fries, chocolate cake and the chopped salad. Portillos is always a good option for good tasting fast food.

I grew up just down the street from the original location on North Ave in Villa Park, which the design of is awful, where this one has a great design, large and plenty of seating. Being paired with a Barnellis gives this location many extra items to choose from. I wish I could give half stars, this would be a 3.5 review.

Atmosphere- very nice, big and expansive, cool theme, comfortable, many tables and many booths, often crowded showing its popularity (stay away on friday nights)
Service- this is by far their fall down, when things are busy I expect things to be not as quick, but in some cases it takes forever, sometimes over 20 minutes and in one instance over a half hour for a hamburger and fries, my shake had completely melted. This isnt however my most common complaint. I could not even keep track of all the times they have messed up an order, busy or not. Cheeseburger with no cheese, missing an order of fries, missing hotdog, missing polish, wrong topping on the hot dog. This is by far the most common problem.
Food- Portillos is Portillos because of the food, the chicago style hot dog and the italian beef are by far the populars and their mainstays, but I must say, their burgers are probably my favorite menu item
Drink- i do not tend to get much to drink as I live close by, but I have never been disappointed by their shakes, the chocolate cake shake being the obvious must try option, yummm

I liked the design of the building with the 60&#39;s theme.  I first ordered the portillo&#39;s hot dog chicago style, I shared one with my parents and it was so good we downed the hot dog in minutes.  The portillo hot dog has a juicy dog with pickles, tomato, hot pepper.  It was great!

Next, I tried the famous italian beef sandwhich.  The italian beef was dipped in gravy ( must do, so good!) and it came with hot peppers.  When I first saw the italian beef sandwhich and it was greasy, I knew it was going to be good.  The first bite into the dog was juicy, powerful flavor, and all around satisfying.  I could not wait to stuff down the dog, the beef tasted extra flavorful after being dipped in gravy, and hot peppers gave a nice kick to the beef.  The hot peppers were not too spicy, it was more of a medium spice.  If you like a little bit of spice in your food, def. get it.

We ate inside because we just purchased a new car and I didn&#39;t want that awesome new car smell to be replaced with whiffs of surprise meat. 

Service inside was mega friendly and fast. My husband and I split a Chicago hot dog, cheese fries and a chopped salad. This is the first time I&#39;ve ordered a salad at Portillo&#39;s, but over the course of a month TWO random patients at my place of employment have asked me if I&#39;ve tried it, so I had too. It&#39;s even more random considering the nearest Portillo&#39;s is over an hour away. Anyway, the chopped salad was awesome with pasta in it and very filling. Hot dog and cheese fries are amazing always.

The set-up is a little screwy, in my opinion. We had to order and pay for the salad at one counter and then order and pay for the hot dog and cheese fries at another. I tried to order coleslaw but was told I had to order it at the other counter but I already made two transactions so decided I didn&#39;t need coleslaw. It was comical when we tried to leave because we had to get drink refills at one counter and then got sent to the other for take-out boxes.

Everytime I go visit, I stop at Portillo&#39;s for their Italian Beef and Chicago dogs.

The place looks like a chain and it is, but a small one. The buildings are large with lots of seating. At busy times, every seat it filled, but they open quickly. 

They have a variety of options to choose. You walk up to a counter and they write your order on a paper bag, then proceed down to the other end and enjoy the show. 

Most locations have a person at this point who get all the compents of your order together and then yells your numbers. You will usually get a notice like &#34;Number 59, You&#39;re so fine!&#34;. 

This is a great place to go to for a quick bite of two Chicago classics.

Italian Beef - many ways to order. Variety of sizes also. You can go dry, wet (juice poured on), or dipped (dunked in the beef juice). With or without Gardiner (a hot pepper/celery mixture) and cheese (optional). I usually go with a dipped beef, gardiner, mozz . It&#39;s de-lish!

Now onto the dogs,

The Chicago Dog - It&#39;s looks like a crazy cluster f*** of an item but it works! Get one for yourself or to split, but get atleast one before you leave!

The food was exceptional as always. I wish California&#39;s fast food french fries came with cheese to dip! I got an Italian Sausage and a Chocolate Cake Shake.

I love that they have a Barnelli&#39;s Pasta Bowl attached but unfortunately, my BF and I didn&#39;t go with the Barnelli&#39;s offering on our trip. 

We went after not being fulfilled at a Vietnamese restaurant across the street and just wanted to grab a quick bite in order to make it to the movies on time. Too bad the drive through was sooo backed up that you could barely turn in from the street. Inside was considerably less crowded and I attribute that to the raining buckets weather. My BF and I ordered. I got cheese fries and a chocolate cake slice, he got a hot dog with Ketchup, Mustard, and sport peppers (he&#39;s not a Chicago style dog guy :( ), fries, and a soda. Anyway, there were 31 employees in the Portillo&#39;s kitchen, which really impressed me with everyone working harmoniously in such close quarters, BUT we saw people who ordered way after us get there food ahead of us over and over as our bag (had our order number on it) sat under the fry heat lamps while my cake and bf&#39;s soda sat on a tray waiting. After 15 minutes of staring, finally, I see the manager yell to put our bag on the tray. We are thankful and race to the car to eat and drive to the movies. 

Sadly, the hot dog my bf got was either made incorrectly or not meant to be his dog and had onions (GROSS!) with no hot peppers. He scarfed it down anyway because we were both hungry and in a hurry. The chocolate cake was good but I think the slice was smaller than other Portillo&#39;s slices but the fries were downright awful. Obviously the fry bin left overs as they were all tiny little scrimpy fries and were so dried out that they were hollow, YES- hollow. I was quite sad.

portillos-hot-dogs-and-barnellis-salad-bowl-glendale-heights,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,hg110XCbMyUZZ-K6MIGa3A,"Portillo&#39;s is a difficult place to rate, they have a wide variety of menu items and a lot of variables that go into your dining experience. 

On the plus side Portillo&#39;s uses excellent quality ingredients and doesn&#39;t skimp, their standard recipe are very solid as well. The downside to Portillo&#39;s is that the meal is generally more expensive than most Chicago style fast food places, and perhaps more importantly, because of the large number of employees that work in an average day, things are made slightly differently from person to person.

Moving on to the basics of Portillos, I&#39;m going to go over two items. Their standard Hot Dog and Jumbo hot dog. The stock portillo&#39;s hot dog is thin and has a nice flavor, it generally has all the juices intact after cooking. How they&#39;re prepared varies greatly, I&#39;ve seen hot dogs with just the right amount of mustard, relish and onion. I&#39;ve also seen hot dogs with too much mustard, (or too little), too much relish (or too little) and every combination in-between. This leads to Portilo&#39;s visits often being a gamble if you want a great hot dog. Usually you get a good one, but often times you get one that&#39;s just a little off. I&#39;m also not a fan of the giant pickle slice they include as it unbalances the hot dog flavor just a smidge. The jumbo hot dog suffers similar issues with condiment application, but is quite a bit thicker and the extra beef can balance out an over-saturated with mustard hot dog.

As far as their other menu items their burgers, Maxwell street polish&#39;s and fries are usually good, and have the tendency to be great, but it&#39;s a bit of a gamble.

All the hot food was cold, but considering the temperature outside, I can understand that. It was packed inside an insulated bag, so there was nothing else they could do about that. I&#39;m from the East Coast, and expected my pizza to be cut like a pizza, not like I was feeding a group of toddlers. No where on their menu do they state that their pizzas are cut into funny squares, rectangles and triangles. I complained to Grubhub about it, and they responded that the restaurant was not willing to give a refund or deliver a new pizza. So I tried calling the restaurant and was told it was my fault for not specifying I wanted my pizza cut like a pizza: no refund, no new pizza. While the guy was polite on the phone, what happened to the motto that the customer is always right? Replacing my pizza with one I would eat might have gotten them repeat business if the pizza tasted good. Wish I would have checked these reviews before ordering tonight. I see a lot of reviews from other unhappy customers here. I spent more than $20 on a pizza that I&#39;m not going to eat. I posted it on my Facebook page: free to anyone that wants to come and get it. So far, no takers. How much would it have cost the business to make me a pizza cut the way I wanted?

Food - Poor. We both ordered burgers. Hers was an undercooked frozen patty with RAW meat in the center. Very thin, and very fatty. We ended up throwing it all away. I took two bites of mine and threw it away. No taste. The only thing that was right was the condiments.

Service - Waited in line for about 15 minutes as they had one cashier working and the other cleaning tables in the dining room. The wait to get the food was another 15 minutes. For 2 burgers and 1 fry it took just about 1/2 hour!

Environment - The place looked clean and had lots of seats for dine in.

Value - Very reasonable - and know I know why!

I realize commercials shouldn&#39;t always be trusted, but theirs did a good job of making their fish look real tasty. They also make it sound like a family restaurant, so I wanted to give it a try.
Well, it&#39;s less family restaurant and more fast food atmosphere. Actually, if I was to compare it to something, I&#39;d say the old-day (1980s) Browns Chicken. However, I was impressed by the food. The fish really does flake open like the tv ad, and the cheese poppers, which I got instead of the fries, were also good. 
The sweet tea was sweet enough to be sweet, but didn&#39;t overpower the tea taste. 
Saturday, the special is their custard pints (buy one, get one). Notice though, &#34;pint&#34;. I thought we were getting small individual cups. I had no idea how big they were. So we picked them up on the way out, after eating to keep them from melting. 

Pros:
-fish is good, fresh
-good selection of food (not just fish)
-lots of seating
-friendly employees 
-reasonable prices
-clean seating area (relatively)
-good parking

Cons:
-condiments are all Hintz (HFCS in everything)

culvers-schaumburg-2,Catherine P.,#NAME?,oUen1rQvlCpEiZLjHHZB8w,"I absolutely love Culver&#39;s and what they offer. You can eat here to cure a hangover with greasy cheeseburgers, enjoy some pot roast or grab a frozen custard sweet treat. I am a regular diner at Culver&#39;s throughout the area. I love their fried chicken, pot roast and pork tenderloin sandwich. I recommend the pork tenderloin sandwich with mustard and pickles only. They hand-bread this tenderloin which means be prepared for crumbs on your chest and lap if eating in the car. 

Their fries are always fresh, but ask for salt if you want there to be any on the fries, because it seems they do not salt their fries much, if at all. Ask for this at the window to expedite service. You may also ask for ketchup. Their cheese curds are also a fun side to any meal. It&#39;s a surprise mozzarella or cheddar bite every time and they are always served fresh. 

The pot roast is another one of my favs, but make sure to ask for extra gravy (on the side) because even though it&#39;s tender and pull apart-able with a fork, it can be a little bit on the dry side, but the gravy fixes this problem. It&#39;s seasoned well and with mashed taters and green beans, you are all set.

I&#39;m not supposed to eat ice cream or anything like it, but we went for ice cream this weekend. I tasted my boyfriend&#39;s cement mixer and it was very good. He chose the most random of toppings- kit kat and crunch, but it really worked!! Yumm-my!

The reason for lack of stars 4 and 5 is because I have ordered chicken sandwiches from here twice now and both times, the chicken was pink in the center....hence, I did not eat my entire dinner either of those visits. :(

This place used to have an old-timey ambiance before their renovation (CRT TV and free newspapers), but since then the place looks a lot more modern and hip.

The shrimp was crispy but the inside was not cooked the color of the shrimp was transparent w/c means it is not cooked through.On the other hand I have to say there were positive things like the fish and shrimp did not smell fishy,the buns were fresh  and good size,The coleslaw was acceptable.

Today, I got to the drive-through window, paid, and they handed me just the mixer and told me to go wait with the rest of the &#34;parking lot&#34; of customers whom I&#39;ve watched wait for their food for several minutes already. It&#39;s NINETY DEGREES OUT. That mixer will be a WARM PUDDLE before my food eventually gets to me. I handed it back and asked if they could bother keeping that cold until the rest of my food was ready. The same thing happened at an earlier trip, but at least I was inside and could use their ice cream freezer while I waited several minutes for the rest of my order. You&#39;re got speedy ice cream mixer folks? Great! But then keep the orders cold until the rest of the order is ready! Especially with the long wait times for food.

And even creating my meal from scratch, it shouldn&#39;t take over five minutes to drop some fries and grill two wafer-thin patties.As a drive-through, it&#39;s a failure. We were just lined up, parked, waiting for our food for a ridiculous amount of time for a drive-through.

Food: Unless you are a vegan, vegetarian, diabetic, or in any way concerned about your health, what&#39;s not to like about Culver&#39;s? They offer a pretty spectacular array of items that you do and don&#39;t see at the competition. Feast your eyes on this crispy chicken sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ZNPbk3HBH-2JeOghsdXQ?select=OGvxO-eAVjBME3TtMoCZ8g). This thing was juicy and crunchy to the max.

The beans may look healthy in the photo, but only because it&#39;s hard to see the tablespoon or more of melted butter. Absolutely delicious. They also have sandwiches (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ZNPbk3HBH-2JeOghsdXQ?select=ddp6OXNnBn-aMWupXSzhmQ) and butterburgers. I didn&#39;t get to try the latter, so I guess I&#39;ll just have to come back. Finally, their creamy, sweet frozen custard will knock your socks off. 

Atmosphere: Typical fast food interior reminiscent of a love child between a Norms and a Wendy&#39;s. They have a thing for the color blue. Also... how can I put this lightly? Expect to see many customers who could probably successfully enter the world of sumo wrestling. 

Service: Order at the counter. Everyone here bleeds friendliness.

Having arrived first, I was caught off guard with a menu written entirely in Japanese. With us not being Japanese and I didn&#39;t think our friends could read / speak Japanese either, needless to say, I was slightly confused / worried. I think the waitress saw the deer in headlights look in my eyes and quickly flipped the menu to the other side where it was the menu in English. PHEW!

The place was a cute strip mall style restaurant with casual decor. They have a main dining area, but will open up the back dining area when it gets busy that allows for you to &#34;sit on the ground&#34; to experience the traditional Japanese dining style. Parking was really easy - lots of spots in the strip mall.

Food: First off, the Unagi Dashi Maki is goooood. Very simple - steamed egg rolled with eel in the middle, but great appetizer to share (or not share) for the table. If my mom hadn&#39;t given me the look that indicated I needed to share with the rest of the table, I would have gladly finished it on my own. I had the Katsu Jyu, which is the breaded pork (tonkatsu) cooked in broth, eggs, and onions on a bed of rice. It also came with miso soup and a side dish with the pickled radish and cucumbers. The tonkatsu was breaded nicely and the onions and eggs added to the flavor of the dish. The miso soup was a little too heavy on the miso for my taste, but my mom enjoyed it. My mom also enjoyed her Nabeyaki Udon bowl. The udon is also kid approved!

Service: Great. They were really attentive and food was being served rather quickly. We were one of the first tables in for the dinner time slot, so not sure if service would slow down once the dining room starts filling up. And boy, did that dining room start filling up quickly during our time there!

Not saying I am a connoisseur of Japanese food, but this was one of the most authentic Japanese meals I have enjoyed. Would recommend checking this place out if you&#39;re in the area and looking for Japanese food.

This place is awesome.  Make no mistake about it, the food, service, environment are all exactly what I&#34;m looking for when I&#39;m craving a traditional Japanese meal.

Decor:  Modest, simple.  The table cloths could be mistaken for an Italian joint, minus the fact that it&#39;s all darkwood and there&#39;s a sushi bar where people are enjoying the phenomenal food.  And the loads of Japanese folks eating here for lunch definitely says something.

Service:  Service is fast (as they need to be, considering how many people are typically here for lunch) but friendly at the same time.  There&#39;s no small talk here, and if you call in advance, they set aside your table while preparing your house salad and two cucumber rolls on the table before you arrive.  Impeccably on point and always aware of our needs (refills on tea/water, helping find the best place for the baby, etc.), it&#39;s a very efficient, friendly environment.

Food:  And here we go... if you&#39;re coming here to order rolls covered in sauce... go away.  What they have here are high quality home style dishes of Japan, along with some amazing quality fish to be enjoyed in nigiri fashion.  Some key stand out dishes that I&#39;ve enjoyed thus far are:

Curry Tonkatsu - Practically guaranteed to fill you up.
Chirashi - High quality fish, perfectly made sushi rice, and a good mix of varieties.. (I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been in many places in the US that give you Ama-ebi as part of the chirashi!)

Various nigiri sushi - Really, all the sushi is quite good.  And definitely worth you time chowing down on.  In fact, I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back at some point and just sitting at the counter for a nice omasake (though I don&#39;t know if the chef&#39;s do that here).

Verdict:  Make it a point to come here for true Japanese food.  Nothing wrong with pretty colored fusion rolls with interesting sauces/ingredients, but this isn&#39;t the place for it.  This is for perfectly made homestyle Japanese cuisine.",26/08/15,247,5,2,5,31,7.8829,4.281,0.42600000000000005,15.293000000000005,No,2127

The menu is pretty different than what I have experienced at most Japanese restaurants too. You have your usual sushi/sashimi menu as well as your entrees. However, I would highly recommend you to just order a bunch of appetizers. Each one is different and has unique flavors/textures. You will get to try a bunch of them especially if you go with a group and share everything. If you have ever had tapas or dim sum it feels very similar to that.

From the not-as-helpful-as-it-could-be hand drawn picture menu for sushi rolls to the just-OK selection and flavor Kurumaya didn&#39;t have me over the moon.

We started with miso and a ginger salad - standard fare, nothing to write home about.  We had 2 pieces of sashimi salmon that were good, but not good enough to cost $3 - 3.50/ea.  I&#39;d expect something closer to $4.50 for 2.  After we figured out the hand-drawn menu we ordered 2 rolls - I *think* a Mexican roll and an Elk Grove roll - both were A-OK but pretty forgettable, and the rest of the selection didn&#39;t seem all that creative.  We finished off with a salted mackerel that had *most* of the bones removed, but was only as good / slightly worse than one I can make at home with $4, 6 minutes, and a broiler.

Service was friendly and pretty prompt.

I have to wonder if the noodle dishes are better or if we came on an off night, but I simply wasn&#39;t impressed at all and felt the prices were just a little high.

Food:
Sushi Appetizer (~$10): consists of 6 cucumber, green onion and rice pieces and 3 nigiri sushi pieces - the nigiri fish tasted fresh and delicious.. just wish they had more options in ordering rolls for nigiri or sushi rolls (during dinner time)

Beef Teriyaki (~$15-$20): comes with a rice, salad, soup and a couple sides...the beef was cooked to perfection and they put the right amount of delicious teriyaki sauce on it!! YUM!!! 

Tempura Udon: tasted good..comes with tempura pieces on the side...I liked the fact that the tempura pieces consisted of veggies different from any other places I&#39;ve been to and it was delicious.. perfect for dipping into the soy sauce or into the udon soup..

Costs: the dinner prices are pretty high..spent about $50-60 on 2 entrees and an appetizer..

Customer Service: the waitress was friendly and reminded me of Ms. Swan (from Mad TV)...she did not quite understand english well and had an accent...she was very attentive, maybe too attentive?...she came to get our orders 4 times before I actually ordered... I need more than 2 min, 5 min, 10 min when ordering food from a restaurant that i&#39;ve never been to....

Tomago egg omelets -  nice starter, and delicate
Potato takoyaki - heavy, greasy, and filling, but worth trying
Grilled beef tongue - more delicate than expected, and light like eggplant
Chirashi and sashimi dinners - nice, as expected
Chicken and salmon teriyaki dinners
Kurumaya gozen - from the picture menu book, and their bento box like offering
Wafu steak - surprisingly buttery flavor

We were greeted upon entering and immediately seated. We were then given WARM towels (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oQP26NMk7vnMKut4gHQwAw?select=rQntXMKUPrxSlNREVTbKyA) to wash our hands with (absolutely love when they do that!)! The waitresses/servers were extremely friendly and tentative. 

Gyozas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oQP26NMk7vnMKut4gHQwAw?select=GgPe-e_PTQwuPQya4TZbjg) - hmmMmmm definitely one of my favorites. They are not your skimpy little ones, but big ones filled with pork.

Miso soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oQP26NMk7vnMKut4gHQwAw?select=u-jAthRDIKfbzyJ5H_fTbg) - great flavor, warm and tasty.

Dragon and rainbow maki (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oQP26NMk7vnMKut4gHQwAw?select=zG7Dr590MMfqXXg7IIGUCw) - fresh and delicious. I really enjoyed the eel sauce on the dragon.

Pink panther (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oQP26NMk7vnMKut4gHQwAw?select=wXI6m2c5fqJIkFslfOH6kA) - was different, not something to rave about. 

Kurumaya Gozen (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oQP26NMk7vnMKut4gHQwAw?select=x62aJ9YMy0zAp05cLPMqog) - my favorite! It&#39;s essentialy a bento box times two. You get to pick either chicken, beef, or salmon teryaki and it comes with shrimp tempura, sashimi, croquette, small cucumber salad, and rice. Everything was fresh and I thought the beef and teryaki sauce was quite tasty!

Overall a pretty delicious meal and great service!",30/09/11,173,4,2,5,48,6.762700000000001,4.478,0.0,11.522,No,1540

If you can read and understand them, then most likely you will be able to taste something very close to authentic Japanese foods.

The stereotype is tiresome: if there are (insert nationality) people that eat here then it must be good. Well, there&#39;s a reason why the stereotype exists.  Just like Sankyu, the majority of the patrons are Japanese and they have a whiteboard with special items written in Japanese.  No, those items are not readily accessible unless you can read and understand Japanese. Fret not, there are plenty of regular items in the thick little illustrated books on each table. Yup, it&#39;s a book. Complete with grammatically (and hilariously) incorrect English and cute (at the risk of losing my man card by using that word) illustrations for each item.

Everything we tried was fantastic from the pedestrian tonkatsu to the perfectly cooked smelt complete with roe in their bellies.  Served in the classic izakaya fashion.  We washed everything down with a couple of large bottles of crispy dry Asahi.

Our favorite (and most expensive) was the tai carpaccio.  There was no price listed on neither the menu or the book so when the dish came out piled with beautiful slices of ginger dressing drizzled tai, we knew it was going to take a dent out of our weekly food budget. Sure enough, at $20 that dish made me involuntarily gasp. But, it was worth it.  The fish was very fresh and the dressing was obviously homemade and cheek tingling tart. A must try if you&#39;re looking for something cool and fresh.

We saw a gaijin couple munching on nothing but rolls and I wanted to go up to them and say, &#34;when in rome...&#34; because everyone else wasn&#39;t even bothering with the sushi, even though they had a full sushi bar.  This place is known for the Japanese tapas style appetizers that accompany Japanese libations.  Save your roll money for some Korean/Chinese owned joint famous for drowning their food in sauces.  While I don&#39;t doubt their sushi/rolls might taste just fine or even good, I highly recommend you order strictly from the appetizer menu.  But be forewarned, it isn&#39;t cheap.

4 appetizers and 2 large beers set us back $85 including tip. I cried a little but I smiled because everything tasted so good.

And the service? Fantastic. Just attentive enough and the perfect lack of personality. Exactly how service should be, especially at a Japanese restaurant. I&#39;m not here to socialize with the help so I appreciate when the staff serve efficiently and without the fake banter that begs for a bigger tip. Sure there was a language barrier but nothing that couldn&#39;t be worked out.

I&#39;ll be back but only after I&#39;ve starved my cats enough to save up to foot that tremendous bill again.",02/11/13,299,4,2,5,30,7.4712999999999985,5.522,1.382,24.095999999999997,No,2749

kurumaya-japanese-kitchen-elk-grove-village,Giuseppe D.,xq_feR5bCdl0CtMDofuWQg,MeHb_vGS0gHO6K2c8uk8Mg,"Finally got the chance to try this place out tonight and it was everything I&#39;d hope it&#39;d be. It&#39;s pretty hard to find unless you already know about the place or are using some navigation of some sort; it&#39;s located in a small parking lot on an otherwise empty strip on Higgins. But should you get here, it&#39;s well worth it.

The place itself is very small. They have a long bar along the back where you can sit on stools to eat, and a small dining area with maybe 8-10 tables or so.

The service was great from start to finish. True Japanese service.

The menu is in Japanese! I thought that was really cool. It scared me at first because I thought I wouldn&#39;t be able to order, but there&#39;s a small book that&#39;s placed on the tables that give English translations and descriptions of the dishes. Cool nonetheless.

If you&#39;ve read my other reviews, you know I love to eat, and I can typically eat what&#39;s enough to feed 3 normal humans. I came here alone and ordered an appetizer and 4 rolls, yes, 4. I ate every piece and was extremely satisfied. Here&#39;s what I ordered:

For the appetizer I ordered the unagi dashimaki, which is eel, egg, and green onion. They&#39;re large rolls made with egg and green pepper, with the eel cooked into the middle of the roll. It came out very hot and was really good. The egg kind of overwhelmed the eel and pepper but it was still good. I have to say its now my favorite appetizer.

For the rolls I ordered the Salmon Skin Roll, Kurumaya Roll, Pink Panther Roll, and the Caterpillar Roll.

I don&#39;t have full descriptions of each roll, as Kurumaya is a small place and still fairly new, so they don&#39;t post a menu online; and I forgot to keep track of what&#39;s in each, but I&#39;ll do my best to help describe them.

The Salmon Skin Roll, though I was most excited for this one, was my least favorite of the four. It was really dry because there were no sauces or cream cheese. It has salmon shavings, carrot, cucumber. Not much flavor, I had to use some soy and wasabi which I typically don&#39;t like to do, but it was okay.

The Kurumaya Roll was my third favorite. I can&#39;t remember much of what was in it except I remember there was avocado; terrible description, I know, but it was a very good roll.

Pink Panther roll had salmon, avocado, cucumber, and was topped with a white sauce (don&#39;t remember what it was) and a spicy (chili) sauce. This was interesting to me as I haven&#39;t had many rolls that had a spicy chili in it, and it was great. The avocado helped offset the spice so it wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly spicy, it just gave it a spicy taste which was great for the overall flavor.

And my favorite was the Caterpillar Roll. Typical for any caterpillar roll ingredients, avocado, cucumber, eel. Very good.

All of the pieces were very large in size, you can see them in the photos. And for all I ordered, the bill was under $50. Very very good place, and I hear they have great lunch specials.",09/04/11,337,5,3,5,98,10.777300000000002,6.982,0.7339999999999999,27.284,No,3000

Even before this happened, this place would&#39;ve gotten 2 stars. Mediocre, unmemorable and overpriced. I don&#39;t get the rave reviews and Yelp usually doesn&#39;t steer me wrong.

The dinner entrees were generic. Teriyaki, tempura, udon/soba noodles. Their appetizers seem more interesting but at $6-$8/pop, it&#39;s way overpriced. Piece together 2-3 for dinner and it gets expensive fast.

I went to dinner at Kurumaya with my gf a few weeks ago on a rainy weekday night and the staff was super friendly.  It is tucked in a usual looking strip mall but was very easy to find.  As we walked through the door curtains to the side room I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have a tatami section.  We did not ask to sit at it (I plan on it next time).  Even though the rest of the restaurant is mildly typical the tatami section bought a Japanese feel to the place.  

The service was excellent on top of having a buzzer system for even quicker service if you need it.  We both got hot tea which was very good, but what was even better was the bottomless refills that we took full advantage of.  I almost felt bad drinking a pot of tea each but it was great tea for a cold rainy day.  There are three menus, one normal menu, a sushi menu, and a combo menu with pictures.  These are not photos but drawn pictures that are extremely accurate, it is worth looking at even if you know what you want already.

We I got a tofu udon noodle soup which was packed with flavor while the gf for some rolls.  Our meals were very satisfying and with prepared well.  We then finished the meal off with the classic green tea ice cream which was nice to have with the green tea at the end of a meal.  

Everything was great about this place though it is a little on the expensive side, it is not too crazy for quality Japanese food.

The quality of the sushi is unmatched, the small plate appetizers like chicken livers, fried smelt, the amazingly delicate pot stickers and phenomenal  potato takoyaki were things you can&#39;t get as good anywhere else in Chicago. 

The menu is in Japanese, the whiteboards of specials are in Japanese the clientele is Japanese and the staff is Japanese. They have a small menu book on each table that is hand written with hand drawings of the food plates with ingredients and general descriptions of each dish, fantastic. 

So what&#39;s the downside? It&#39;s a dump. The dining room is brightly lit to its own detriment as it has tables from a Perkins, black plastic plaid tablecloths, black vinyl metal frame chairs, black carpet that has tuned gray with age, bathrooms with black vinyl wallpaper that pulls away from its seams, terrible stained drop ceiling tiles and an overall shockingly dreary feel.

Ordered the Unagi dashimaki.....SO GOOD!!!! Besides the fact that the waitress put in the wrong thing and just gave us the PLAIN dashimaki. I think she just took it back and they stuck the lil pieces of eel inside. lol but it was still really fresh and super delicious.

My katsu was DRY and THICK and not even battered with panko! It was like a fried chicken batter.....with pepper and soggy. The miso sauce was ok. The katsu was tasteless. The Wafu Steak was basically cooked in butter. It was so buttery that it kinda left a sour taste in the mouth.

Okay, where should I start...

So after moving from a food paradise city, San Francisco, to a yummy-food-nowhere-to-be-found country town, Milwaukee, I was really depressed for a while because I could not find a good Japanese restaurant anywhere.

Luckily, I found out that there was a Mitsuwa in the suburb of Chicago. So, make the connection: Misuwa = Japanese = CHIRASHI! There must be somewhere close to Mitsuwa that sells chirashi, right? And YESSSSSS, I&#39;ve found it: Kurumaya Japanese Kitchen.

Their chirashi = authentic + good value (only $11.95!) + fresh + nicely presented. Wow!
It actually comes with a piece of amaebi with the fried shrimp head. NICE!

It&#39;s sad that you realize the great things you had only after you lose them.  Kurumaya is a standout in every single way.  The sushi is absolutely phenomenal and beats out almost every sushi joint that I have had most of my life.  This hole in the wall joint is a true 5 star in my books.

For those who are not well acquainted with the relative proportions/sizes of how a nigiri sushi should really look like...go and eat at Kurumaya.  This is how good sushi is presented at top places in Japan.  

The size and shape of the fish slice is perfect.  The amount of rice placed underneath the fish is perfect.  The ratio of the size of the fish to the size of the rice is perfect.  The seasoning of the rice is perfect. (as you can tell I&#39;m a sushi snob ^o^).  And lastly...the quality of the sushi is just top notch.   

The restaurant is not the hip-modern type of Japanese restaurant like Japonais, Mirai, and all the other restaurants (which I think are garbage and are at least 2X more expensive and not a 1/4 as good).
Most of the clients here are Japanese businessmen who come with their coworkers after work.

Although it doesn&#39;t affect me b/c I can read and speak Japanese, the one qualm I have about this place is that there are lots and lots of specialty foods and appetizers that are not found in 99% of Japanese restaurants...but they are only written in Japanese (and the server will not be able to explain what they are clearly).

My wife and I went there for lunch yesterday. Her food came about 10 minutes. My food never came. I ordered Jirashi (raw fish over rice) it is NOT a complicated meal to prepare. In about 5 minutes, my wife got her food. She was about to finish her lunch, and I was still waiting. During this time, no one came to check on us. I asked the waitress for my Jirashe. Her answer was THE CHEF WAS BUSY. I waited for more than 30 minutes. People who came after us already got their lunch and left, and I was still waiting for my raw fish over rice. 

I told the waitress I wanted to cancel my lunch and asked for my check. She give us a very standard Japanese &#34;We are so sorry&#34; apology&#34; then walked away. I called her back and told her she should have warned me when I placed my order, if the chef was busy. She did not reply just walked away. At this moment I was really hungry, but she did not make any effort to try make it up, or bring something to ease my hunger. I asked for the check, she just waived her hand, said &#34;Lunch is free&#34; and walked away. That was when I was really offended. I CAME FOR LUNCH. I DID NOT CAME FOR FREE FOOD. We asked for the check again. This time she brought the check. (If she really wanted to offer free lunch as an apology, why bring the check the second time? Fake apology!) We paid and asked to see the manager. She said there was no manager. Again, brief answer and walked away. 

I have worked in Japanese restaurant before. My guessing is she forgot to my order all together. Instead trying to make a customer happy, she just wanted to make this problem go away. That was why she immediately offered the free lunch to us, but she was not sincere. My assumption was I should shut up if I got the food for free. That was insulting to me. 
 
This is a busy place for lunch. THEY DON&#39;T CARE. 

Food is all right. For some that don&#39;t have much knowledge about Japanese food. For those that think anything rice with soy sauce is good. This kind of Japanese food can satisfy their taste. The truth is their food is not the worst. but marginal. It can be an option when you are tired of McD. But their attitude is really fake and arrogant and service is simply lousy.

Take your own risk. You can order what you want, but you may or may not get your food.",31/01/13,282,1,1,0,-50,-0.6685999999999998,2.677,5.0089999999999995,39.313999999999986,No,2410

With no regrets, of course. Years ago, I spent a good portion of my childhood in the west suburb, and while I remember my parents taking us to Sakura and other J-restaurants, I don&#39;t recall going to Kurumaya. I guess that&#39;s because many of these restaurants used to be much better back then (or so I heard) so we didn&#39;t have to explore other options. Anyway, after xx years, Kurumaya has become my most favorite izakaya/sushi bar in the entire Chicagoland. 

Go here for the real, home-cooked stuff with a bit of twist here and there. And you get the miso soup WITH your food and WITHOUT a spoon. Enough said?

That was our experience at Kurumaya Japanese Kitchen.

The menu is in a tiny photo album with wee illustrations - there are tons and tons of items to choose from.  This is one of those rare occasions where I don&#39;t remember the items we had but I will say the takoyaki was tasty, as was the potato croquette.  And some kind of collar of fish that was outstanding.  We didn&#39;t try the rolls but nobody else in the dining room was eating there so we didn&#39;t either.

As soon as you walk in, the waitresses greet you warmly with a welcoming smile no matter how busy they may be (which they were every time I went). They seat you and are quick to serve you with green tea and either an appetizer salad (chopped lettuce with other vegetables and a tangy ginger salad dressing) or rolls (daikon radish or avocado). Both very delicious and a perfect way to start off a meal as you look through the menu and wait for your main dish.

They serve a variety of Japanese dishes you can choose from. There are different daily specials which is displayed on the front table as soon as you walk in. They have two menus and their cute illustrated menu is helpful to see what some of the more popular dishes actually look like. For anyone&#39;s first time at Kurumaya, any dish on the the illustrated menu is a great way to get started.

Unfortunately, I have not yet tried all of the foods but I hope to do so soon so that I can edit this review to make it more specific to each dish. As I have mentioned, everything on the illustrated menu is delicious and will not disappoint. My personal favorite is the Sushi Deluxe. You just can&#39;t go wrong with this one! It includes six pieces of sushi, four pieces of California Rolls, and a bowl of miso soup. It&#39;s all so fresh and the fish literally melts in your mouth. The rice is just perfectly seasoned as well :)

Another thing I look forward to when I go to Kurumaya (especially if it&#39;s by myself or with one other person) is sitting at the bar and watching the sushi master doing his thang! :)

I&#39;ve never had a bad experience at Kurumaya and would recommend it to anyone who values great customer service, loves Japanese food, and affordable prices for it (lunch hours).",14/12/12,204,4,2,5,21,7.598599999999999,3.0820000000000003,0.097,11.82,No,1826
kurumaya-japanese-kitchen-elk-grove-village,N. H.,S7lc0O_KRRpvair9B0SQzA,29k55FMuOkbsZGXEgsEOdg,"I&#39;m really pleased with this place! There is an abundance of Japanese restaurants in Chicagoland area but not too many that are authentic and actually owned by Japanese people, and actually frequented by Japanese people. 

I was pleasantly surprised they had takoyaki, as it is a street food in Japan but not served in restaurants in America typically. Street food at a high price... But it was really good and since it is hard to find in America, it was worth it! Served sizzling, crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside as it should be! 

I also had the sushi platter. Everything was fresh. I had the bigger platter which also included a raw shrimp sashimi. Which again, I was impressed with because this is a sign of authenticity! 

The waitresses were nice but didn&#39;t seem to get one of my orders right. We tried to order the Tamago yaki (rolled omelet) with eel in the middle as I seen on this yelp page. I tried to ask her at least twice, &#34;Is it going to have eel in it?&#34; and I&#39;ve emphasized I definitely wanted eel in mine. But alas, it didn&#39;t, and I was disappointed. It was a really good tamago yaki but there was really nothing in it for me if it was a plain rolled omelet. 

My friend has the grilled salted mackerel. Salty (in a good way) and moist as far as I can tell from the little I had! Nice~

I also tried one of the traditional desserts. I had the pounded rice cake with soybean powder. It was homemade and delicious. Hot, chewy, glutinous. But it is a very small portion with about 4 very small pieces. 

The downsides are that it is still really expensive. When I heard from other people before I went that this place is a hole in the wall, I expected cheaper food. But first of, it isn&#39;t a &#34;dump&#34; like others may have suggested. It is very clean, but just has simple decor. The place also shows Japanese TV which was hilarious to me and my friend. We were watching some weirddddd game show where girls were having a competition to see who can scream the longest.... lol!

When I walked in with my group I felt like I was back in Japan.  They greet you in the traditional Japanese way as if you were walking into a restaurant in Tokyo.  They offered us green tea right away... perfect!  

The entire staff is Japanese, the sushi chef is Japanese and from what I hear was classically trained in Japan.  As an obvious result, the sushi was delicious.  

Overall the food was good... and then there is the service.  It was a working lunch, so we were making our way through all the sushi we ordered and discussing business when our server told us that they close at 2:00 to prepare for dinner service.  We paid our bill, finished our food and was gradually wrapping up the discussion when we were approached again.  It was 2:15 and we were pretty much being asked to leave.

If people are crazy about izakaya style place in Chicago, they need to come to Kurumaya because their variety of small plates are to die for.

Kurumaya looks like a hole-in-the-wall; you can easily drive past it on Higgins Rd without knowing. We came here on a cold day, hungry for some Japanese food. The menu is quite extensive but you&#39;ll notice that the appetizer section is way longer than the rest. So I asked the waitress and she explains that customers usually order appetizers/small plates while drinking sake and have a good conversation.

Don&#39;t expect your regular teriyaki such and such here because they are very limited. Instead, try their crispy grilled pork belly that melts in your mouth, asari saka mushi (asari clams in sake-spiked clam broth), and takoyaki (chewy grilled octopus meatballs with sweet sauce, nori, and bonito). My gozen dinner box comes with sashimi, tempura, salmon shio, rice, soup, salad etc, more than enough to keep my tummy happy. 

If you need more choices, consult the ever so friendly picture book on your table. They illustrated their menu in pictures and even included the chef&#39;s specials that are usually reserved for people who knows Japanese. Let me tell you, the pictures didn&#39;t make choosing any easier because they look delicious! If you have tried all that, they will be more than happy to make you something that&#39;s not in either menus. 

We, of course got carried away because our entire order could hardly fit in the table. Then, I realized, it&#39;s OK to order some small plates, finish them and then order more because that&#39;s how they do it at Kurumaya. Ah, silly us. =)

I FINALLY got to try &#34;Black Pig,&#34; a rare (as in hard-to-find-rare; it was well-cooked) item I&#39;ve only read about in the past. The few Japanese restaurants that did have it on their menus in Japan were &#34;sold out&#34; (or at least that is what they politely claimed, while in the back room they may have been whispering &#34;This stuff too good for Gaijin&#34;)... :)  And actually, it was awesome!! Served flat on wooden skewers (about the size of two strips of bacon side-by-side and twice as thick, and cut into 2-inch squares), it had a texture and flavor more like lamb chops than pork.

Another Japanese regional dish was &#34;Yamakake&#34; (cool diced raw tuna topped with a slippery grated mountain yam). Not for everyone, even many Japanese are turned off by the slipperiness (like raw egg), but it tasted great so I didn&#39;t mind that at all (just had difficulty grabbing the quarter-inch slippery diced tuna pieces with my chopsticks). A few other delights (I let my wife take over ordering everything, as she did great the first few rounds) and we were stuffed.

Not to let that stop us though!! We ordered some more to take home, including Rafute, a meltingly tender and succulent braised pork belly flavored with ginger and Awamori (an Okinawan sake) and cooked so such that the fat is melted out of the pork (and becomes part of the flavor in the barbecue-like sauce).

Surprisingly, the prices were great!! Not an everyday place, but certainly worthy of consideration again, again, and again in the future.",03/02/10,274,5,2,5,44,5.6359,2.8209999999999997,0.532,12.646,No,2185
kurumaya-japanese-kitchen-elk-grove-village,Irene B.,28qj3o6DtrQZN3GnjkPgjg,OWZq-tDuhhDoXgDHw6Qlqw,"I really wanted to give this place five stars, considering all of the awesome ratings by other yelpers. However, after having dinner there with the boyfriend on a Tuesday night, I just couldn&#39;t see what all the fuss was about. So trust me when I say that I&#39;m being nice by giving the place two stars...

We decided to try Kurumaya after a friend suggested it. He raved about their authentic Japanese dishes, and of course we were very excited.

We were greeted immediately by an older Japanese lady who seemed very sweet, and seated us right away. Surprisingly enough, the place was still half full at 830pm on a Tuesday night. Good sign. All of the restaurant patrons were made up of older Japanese people. Even better sign. This just solidified the place&#39;s authenticity for me. 

I ordered what I thought would be a safe dish, beef teriyaki. My boyfriend ordered the spicy tuna roll and the Kurumaya roll. My dish arrived first. It came with a generous amount of beef, a small salad, rice, miso soup, two handfuls of cabbage and some bean sprout-looking side dish. I was hungry so I dove right into the beef, and it was like biting into a car tire. So I tried a different slice, thinking that first slice I bit into must&#39;ve been a fluke. But slice number two had the consistency of a pencil eraser. Now onto slice #3, then #4, but all the same. I guess I started making a face by then because my boyfriend was giving me the &#34;are you okay because you&#39;re starting to look crazy&#34; look. I told him about my chewy beef. He told me to get the chicken, so I did. In the mean time his rolls arrived. He loved the spicy tuna and I thought it was just okay. The Kurumaya roll was bland and did not taste at all fresh. I felt like I was eating those plastic displays of food they put up in front of some Asian restaurant windows. I was so disappointed...

Finally, my chicken teriyaki arrived. I prayed before taking a bite. It tasted like scrambled eggs. At this point I gave up. I just wanted to pay our bill and run out of there. Sixty two dollars?! Fine. I just want to go home.

In the up side, the servers were nice. Thus the 2 stars. But we won&#39;t be coming back.",08/05/12,266,2,1,5,-1,7.754200000000002,5.941999999999999,0.213,29.844999999999995,No,2192
kurumaya-japanese-kitchen-elk-grove-village,Kin L.,EQRkngLa3pvjVuKW3ssaow,M9BD7AuEIqwKxDHZ9RIJoQ,"I liked this place so much that I went there twice during the week!  Very rarely will I go back to a good restaurant so quickly after the initial visit, but I liked the tonkatsu so much that I was craving it again by the end of the week.

During my first visit, I noticed the place was packed for lunch, and most of the patrons were Japanese.  Seeing a bunch of Japanese people at a Japanese restaurant?  Jackpot!  I was greeted by one of the petite waitresses in Japanese.  Not able to decipher what she was saying, I just held up one finger and smiled.  I think I need to watch more anime so I can learn some simple Japanese phrases.  Like a previous reviewer said, the checkered table clothes are a bit tacky, but honestly, who the F cares?  I liked the food so much that if it was served on the floor next to the bathroom, I would still eat it!  Another plus is that you&#39;re served a small appetizer of salad and two small avocado or cucumber rolls almost immediately after being seated.  It&#39;s a small detail, but it&#39;s a good gesture on their part.

I brought my coworkers with me on my second visit and they liked it as well.  It wasn&#39;t as packed as the first time because it was during the week of Thanksgiving.  I ordered the tonkatsu just like the first time.  The consistency was definitely there and the portion is just right.  The tonkatsu was just as good, if not better as those served at Katsu-hana at the Mitsuwa in NJ.  Breaded just right, and fried to perfection, the thickness of the porkchop was right on as well.  I also like Sunshine Cafe&#39;s tonkatsu, but that place uses a thinner cut of pork so this Kurumaya has a one up over Sunshine.

One down side is that they don&#39;t serve gyozas during lunch!  Clearly a disappoint for this dumpling whore, but I guess I&#39;ll have to come back during dinner hours.  Oh yeah, I love it how the staff all say goodbye in Japanese pretty much in unison when you leave.

kurumaya-japanese-kitchen-elk-grove-village,Cecilia T.,2TPODjHaHQ-cThz-oahpXQ,vgEwGZEgEuP975L1SW0DLA,"I&#39;ve heard when Kosuke Fukodome misses Japan, he comes here to eat - THAT should tell ya something about the authenticity of this restaurant! 

This restaurant has the most authentic Japanese food I&#39;ve ever experienced in the Chicagoland area. There&#39;s no place like it, whether downtown or in the burbs! It&#39;s not just your typical udon or sushi -more like  Japanese tapas  that you cannot get anywhere else in Chitown! I&#39;ve come here with friends that are Japanese or lived in Japan and they all agree you cannot get anything more authentic in the chicagoland area than at this sweet spot. Yeah it&#39;s located in a scary plaza in some random industrial area, but trust me you will have an AMAZING experience here! 

MY FAVORITE DISHES: (Keep in mind, i don&#39;t eat raw fish)
-POTATO TOKOYAKI known as &#34;octopus donut&#34;  - i know that might sound funny, but it&#39;s delicious!  I don&#39;t even normally like octopus - there&#39;s just small bits in each piece. Topped with mayo, green onions, fish flakes, and  tonkatsu sauce...THIS IS SO GOOD!!!
- UNAGI DASHI MAKI -it&#39;s a steamed egg dish but way more special. We always order mutliple portions of this dish! 
-GYU TATAKI  - tender cold rare beef dish....sooo good! 
- KURUMAYA ROLL  - yummy roll for non-raw fish lovers!)
-KOROKKE - potato meat patties with onion - i make these at home as taught by my japanese roommates and this place makes them delish! 
-KARAGI - japanese nuggets

OTHER DISHES MY FRIENDS LIKE:
- beef tongue and gizzards, which are delicious (esp the gizzards), but those are limited daily.

If you understand Japanese, ask for their &#34;secret menu&#34; that offers selections in Japanese that you can&#39;t order off the regular menu.

kurumaya-japanese-kitchen-elk-grove-village,Nora A.,jYubZUv5DNQYPXCtjxe0XA,4_tBAX2Zt5tm2LFdTj_DEA,"Stopped in here for lunch today.  I have been here only once before for take-out near the end of lunch, so it was empty the last time I was here.  Today, it was bustling and I can honestly say I was in the minority as an non-Asian.  This place does not have a monster selection of rolls or fish, but what they do have is well-executed.  After reading some of the reviews here, I inquired whether they could get me an order of takoyaki, since it was not on the lunch menu.  She checked with the kitchen and said yes, they could.  I also ordered the sashimi lunch.  This was honestly, a bit too much for one person for lunch, but I discovered this a bit too late...

When you come in, they offer green tea and then brought out two small cucumber maki pieces and a salad with ginger dressing to start.  The sashimi lunch came with nine pieces of sashimi total, with three of each:  tuna, yellowtail, and salmon.  I&#39;m not sure if that is the standard or if you can request other types, but what I had was excellent, very fresh.  They also serve a side of white (non-sushi) rice and miso soup.  I had pretty much finished my lunch when the takoyaki came out on a sizzling plate -- there were five big pieces, drizzled with just the right amount of mayo, katsuobushi and aonori.  They were very hot when they came out, so I had to wait a few minutes before digging in.  I ruined myself feeling like I had to finish the entire order (it&#39;s kind of hard to take that to-go.)

The service was very polite and friendly but a bit slow at times -- they only had 2 servers working the floor.   Still, must say that I agree with the reviews -- this is a very authentic Japanese restaurant.  Do not go in expecting a huge assortment of Americanized maki rolls.  Do go in expecting excellent, well-prepared Japanese food.  I will be back, I&#39;m sure...",17/05/11,203,5,1,4,-12,3.3057000000000003,1.8079999999999998,0.625,16.566000000000003,No,1845
kurumaya-japanese-kitchen-elk-grove-village,Aloysius T.,UxsPF9Zmi95x9fausVyxcw,iSlVq7wP-YvW5LBh5GtyhA,"Okay, so I just got back from Tokyo not too long ago. Still jet lagged.  A mate of mine who came back a week earlier from Japan than I had; had wanted to eat some Japanese food.  Surprisingly, despite eating nothing but Japanese food for two weeks straight; I still had a strong desire to eat Japanese food.  Though I&#39;ll admit the first thing I ate when I came back was a huge gut-busting Chipotle burrito...I know I&#39;m terrible.  So this is...the second time I&#39;ve been here; and fresh from Japan I felt I would have an interesting new perspective on the food here.  So here we go:

Sashimi platter:  It included red snapper, salmon, tuna, and I believe one piece of odoro (or as the greenhorns call it Toro)  Dissapointing...utterly sad and dissapointing.  Last time I came, my eyes lit up from the fish.  Now it&#39;s very much possible the quality had remained the same.  Or perhaps I just had a subpar batch...though Saturday is a decent fish day.  But the last thing I ate was Toro sashimi in Japan at Tsukiji market.  Tsukiji, the largest fish market in the world, naturally has some of the freshest fish.  The pieces of sushi I ate, normally retail somewherea round ten dollars a piece.  I was purchasing them for 2 dollars a piece.  Even the crappier parts of the tuna, which were priced at about 50 cents a piece, were divine.  That being said...I think I ruined sushi for myself.  Quite possibly I ate some of the richest, freshest fish I may ever have the pleasure of eating.  And after eating any other sashimi soon thereafter, well everything else may just pale in comparison.  Have my taste buds spoiled?  Have I ruined sushi for myself, especially being here in the midwest?  I&#39;ll have to go to Lawrence Fish Market, and find out if there is hope for me.  In the meantime, I&#39;m very scared I will never enjoy sushi again.

Potato Takoyaki - the first time I came, I felt these were absolutely tasty.  Second time around, still amazing.  I was in Osaka for 3 days during my travels.  They are famous for their takoyaki and gross interpretation of Okonomiyaki (Hiroshima&#39;s is better ;p) The takoyaki here, I would put on the same level as those in Osaka.  I went to some of the more popular takoyaki places, and this potato takoyaki is up there man.  Very impressed.  A lot of that, though, I feel is due to the takoyaki being potato and not just your &#39;normal&#39; takoyaki.  MUST TRY.

Gyu Tatake - Tatake is basically a lightly seared carpaccio lightly marinated in vinegar.  For you fellow Anthony Bourdain fanboys and girls, I went to the yakitori restaurant he went to in Tokyo.  F#*$ing amazing.  Best chicken I feel I&#39;ll ever have in my life.  But there I tried chicken tatake; rare chicken sounds crazy...but the taste was transcendant.  The tatake made the corners of my eyes squint in gastro-ecstacy.  If you are ever in Tokyo, you really must try it.  But I digress, so the reason I ordered the gyu tatake is because I had such a great experience with tori-tatake.  Simply put, very very good.  Granted not an out of body experience, but still very very good.  Especially if you rub some of the minced chili paste and scallions on top....another very solid choice here.

Gosh another long review...telling the story of my life.  Sorry.  For my third time back, I&#39;m going to bring my Jappo friend who can read their Japanese only menu.  I&#39;m terrible with the chinese characters...

I went to this place for the first time last Thursday and returned the very next day.  Both dinners were superb.  The service was very good.  On both nights we were the only non-Japanese clients.  Yet the staff, and especially Kozume, are very friendly, patient, and helpful.

Kurumaya is truly a hidden gem, located in a warehouse/industrial district of Elk Grove.  

The wasakagi -- deep fried smelt served with punzo sauce -- were deliously crispy.  Here you can order also deep fried fish bone (if available) -- a delicacy that I treasure.  Stuffed fried okra: very good (but I thought that was an Indian dish).  

The experience of watching Japanese families, friends, and businessmen enjoying this place enhances the overall pleasure of eating at Kurumaya.

Beef Tongue yakatori (?) - grilled thin cut beef tongue - delicate and flavorful
Kaki Fry - breaded nicely but pretty expensive for 5 pcs
Unagi rice bowl - can definitely taste the chargrilled eel (means they cooked or reheated inhouse) but we were too full to enjoy it
Potato Takoyaki - chewy and crunchy - very interesting
Chicken Yakatori - glad they used dark meat and was not dried out but otherwise not exciting

I just visited to see the place and try the beers. Having read the Yelp Reviews (this place is currently at 3.5 stars on Yelp), I feel the need to comment.

You may be aware - bar patrons are pretty much the worst. Half of these reviews have nothing to do with the food or drinks, but are some perceived slights committed by the wait staff, who work a tough job and are on average 19 years old.

So, review time: the beer is awesome. I&#39;m tried 3 of the 20 some choices on tap. All 3 were top notch. Have a werewolf, you&#39;ll have a fun time!

Service is awesome - event planner and bartender were both attentive and nice. I was asked like 4 times if I wanted a second beer. Cool, if I wanted more beer, I would be totally squared away :D

All told, this is my top pick for the venue. Having read the reviews, i see that the cess of humanity known as the Chicago exurbs is alive and well. Bummer.

We ordered the Greek nachos as an appetizer and they were just ok. Nothing to write home about. Several of us ordered iced tea, one ordered a beer on tap. Tea was weak but drinkable.

Then it goes off the tracks. I ordered the prime rib for $18.00. What arrived was a VERY SMALL piece of prime rib that was pretty fatty. Ok, not a great deal. No problem. Two others had ordered sandwiches and one had ordered a salad. I cut off the first bite of the prime rib and go to lift it up and look down at a hair under the meat on the plate, black in color, about an inch long. I have brown hair, Buzz cut, and the others at the table were not even close. I took a pic as I called over the waiter. He apologises and said the would cook another one (prime rib?) And came back about 5 minutes later with another. I would say it was at least 30% fat. The others at the table even commented on it being so fatty.

Management never came over to check on the fact that they had hair in the food. The waiter acted like it was a normal occurrence, and it was not mentioned again.

I wanted to order one of their beers, so I asked the server which lighter beer she would recommend. She said the Kainz Brau Pilsner- it was a great choice.

I stopped by yesterday for lunch, sitting at their patio out back to enjoy the weather while it lasts. I like the pub/brewery feel, the service was good and our waitress was nice enough to let us sample a few of their own brews before ordering. My favorite was the HopSlayer which was nice and hoppy, though the one nicknamed Big Hurt was a tad sweet for my taste. I&#39;m not sure when it runs but they had a 1/2 price special going on many of their beers making my 20oz Antivenow a mere $2. Nice.

As for the food, we went with fried pickles and poppers as well as the sausage sampler. I doubt I&#39;d get the sausages again but the poppers were surprising because most places order the same generic ones stuffed with cream cheese while these were stuffed with cheese and a nice crunch. The Paddy Ale Melt was properly cooked to order and the fries were worth eating. The steamed mussels, however, left a lot to be desired. The juice didn&#39;t entice me enough to finish the bread by dipping into it, and after a while I grew tired of the sausage slices. Can&#39;t believe I just said that about sausage but it&#39;s true. 

If you&#39;re in the area I suggest checking out what Onion Pub has to offer.

Our server lacked menu knowledge.  Chimichuri sauce piqued our curiosity, but she thought there was horseradish in their chimichuri sauce and someone in the kitchen confirmed this.  What?  Chimichuri sauces are made of olive oil, garlic, herbs, salt and pepper and red pepper flakes.  One of the guests asked if one of the beers were available to take home in a 6 pack (some were); the one we inquired about wasn&#39;t.  Later we thought to ask if it was available in a growler - the waitress had already walked away and not mentioned it.  Later we found out, because we asked, that you could get it in a growler.  She didn&#39;t know about their products or up-selling.  She gave vague responses on suggestions for appetizers and entrees too.  At the end of the meal, she was unprepared when we asked her for the dessert menu.  So, it was not the best experience.

Gratuity charges are also generally a touchy issue for groups.  Normally I think they are there to ensure the staff is tipped fairly for large parties and don&#39;t have an issue with it.  We were a perfect check by restaurant standards - we ordered beverages, 2 apps, 6 entrees, 2 desserts, a few growlers to go.  The waitress added gratuity to our check.  She should have put the retail items on a separate check so that we did not pay the set gratuity charge for our retail purchases.  Next time we will order retail items to go at the bar.

The Staff is great, the food is good, the bar atmosphere is the best in the area! The management, is awful, rude, and I may never go back.

My family and I go in often, we have even thrown events in the back room before. The bartenders know us by first name, but I have never been treated like this. I went in, thinking about doing another event. The Manager, Patty, over heard us talking and came right over. She had a raised voice, and was very aggressive, automatically saying that what we wanted was unimaginable! She was so rude, and Deming. I have never been yelled at as a customer in my life. We left shocked that this even happened. 

I wanted to let the owners know, that you have a great restaurant and some really great staff members that care and try to get to know your customers.

He came back and say us and told us we could order. That right there is great customer service. 
The food was amazing!!!! We had the onion rings, a Ruben and a prime rib dip. Wow! You get so much food! 
We decided to do the beer flight. You get 10 5oz samples! All the beer was great. My favorite was the Wheat stacker.

the-onion-pub-and-brewery-lake-barrington,Claudia S.,BSGoDj3im64f8r9Jy1fshw,qCiKcY3nqpMu_me_x1ZvnA,"I&#39;m in love.

I have been wanting to come here for over a year now and because I love Wild Onion&#39;s beer, there was no way I wanted to drive.  Convinced someone to come here last week and I fell in love!  Onion Pub was not what I was expecting, at all.  Seeing as how I had just gone to Two Brothers the week before, I guess I thought it would be bigger, but Onion Pub&#39;s restaurant area was smaller and cozy without being cramped.  Pretty sure I called it &#34;quaint&#34; and that it felt like a German restaurant, even though, admittedly, I don&#39;t know what German restaurants &#34;feel like&#34;.  

Sat at the bar and thought service was just fine.  I mean, every time my beer was empty they were on it, so what&#39;s there to complain about?  They currently have their &#34;Winter Seasonal Menu&#34; and I ended up trying the mac &amp; cheese wedges with polish sausage as well as the 3 little pigs.  Both hit the spot, even though I&#39;m clearly a meatball Chicagoan who assumed &#34;polish sausage&#34; was going to be like you get at the local hot dog joint.  Imagine my (pleasant) surprise when I discovered it wasn&#39;t. 

As far as the beers go, I started backwards and therefore by the time I got to the lighter ones, I wasn&#39;t a fan.  Lucky for me, I was with someone who wasn&#39;t going to waste them, but there is a reason winter beers exist.  Either stick with them, or progress to them properly.   

Overall, it&#39;s probably a good thing I live too far from here, especially while Drago is on tap.  

Oh!  I didn&#39;t end up coming from Chicago (though I can&#39;t imagine the drive would be bad from here either), but as you&#39;re getting closer to the brewery, keep your eyes open because we almost drove past it.  Again, I was expecting bigger, so it definitely can be easy to miss.",22/12/12,204,4,1,5,-18,4.8976,3.175,0.556,14.268,No,1826

the-onion-pub-and-brewery-lake-barrington,Mark G.,KnR1rB7r_3UNf2kCTAj8qA,KLpkgFixE4_LV6engd34fA,"Located in some boring suburb (I realize &#34;boring&#34; and &#34;suburb&#34; might be redundant to some people) called Lake Barrington is a Pub/Brewery that is worth checking out at least once.

For a brewery who&#39;s most monumental beer is called &#34;Hop Slayer&#34; (devil horns), the pub was not what I was expecting at all. Then again, I didn&#39;t really know what to expect. But a woodsy, toned-down log cabin vibe definitely surprised me. They attract a mixed bag of people.  E.g. wedding reception goers, families with little kids, and average &#34;Joes&#34; sipping beer and watching sports.

I was not too familiar with Onion beer before coming here. Now that I am, I realize they&#39;re hit or miss. In my opinion, Hop Slayer and Drago (a Russian imperial stout) are the only standouts. The rest are just average.

What made the trek to Onion worth it was the food, service and the atmosphere. The bartenders were quite friendly, attentive and helpful. I was eyeballing the &#34;3 Little Pigs&#34; sandwich on the menu since the moment we arrived, and that&#39;s exactly  what we ordered. *Sky point* And it was damn good too. Unfortunately, it&#39;s on the seasonal menu, so it might not be there if I decided to come back. But there&#39;s many intriguing options on the regular menu as well. We also ordered the Mac and Cheese wedges with polish sausage which was battered in their beer. Delicious!

I may have had higher hopes for the beer, but just about everything else made this a worthwhile experience. If you&#39;re a beer nerd, I&#39;d recommend adding Onion to your list.",22/12/12,182,3,2,4,24,3.249,3.392,0.784,16.823999999999998,No,1597

The food was great, however, after we got it, the waitress never checked on us. I had to walk over to the bar myself and get my own refill. The place wasn&#39;t overly busy either. Only 50% of the tables were occupied.

The girl at the bar was kind of embarrassed this happened and said she would get our waitress right away.

When the waitress came back, she said &#34;sorry, the owner had me talking.&#34; As if the fact that her delay was due to this Almighty owner blessing her with the kindness of his/her precious time makes it any less excusable to waste ours.

A coworker who lives in the area recommended The Onion Pub &amp; Brewery.  Good thing, too, because they are off the beaten path on the north side of Barrington.  If you didn&#39;t know where to find them or see their tiny sign on NW Hwy you would probably miss them entirely.

I was pleasantly surprised by the look of the place, both inside and out.  Ivy covered brick outside, nice dark but charming decor inside.  We really wanted to sit on the patio as we were freezing from sitting in the A/C all day but there was a wedding dinner being held there.  

Our server was so wonderful I&#39;m bummed I don&#39;t recall her name.  Lots of fun, explained the drinks/beer &amp; food/specials menus, and checked on us often but not too often.  They have a good menu and so many appetizers sounded great we opted to split two appetizers and then go from there.  We both tried different beers and I also had a Mai Tai to start - all very good.  We split the GIANT onion rings (c&#39;mon they are the Onion Pub, after all!) which had a nice stout-mustard for dipping, and the Sausage Sampler.  OMG...the 3 types of sausages were all so delicious but the slightly spicy one made just for them was the best.  There was also a grainy mustard for dipping and it came with THE BEST sauerkraut I have ever had.  I have German friends and my hubby is Polish so I have had a LOT of sauerkraut in my time.  This was cooked up with crumbled bacon and green onions....we both gobbled it up!

At this point we were too full to try another but our server tempted us with dessert, telling us about a small ice cream cookie type thing that&#39;s not very big if we wanted something little.  Well after looking at the dessert menu we just had to try the Bread Pudding with Bourbon Caramel Sauce as I am a big bread pudding fan.  It was also wonderful and it was a HUGE piece.

the-onion-pub-and-brewery-lake-barrington,Candice G.,UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg,2KVT-3Q5Sg_eyQdPEzvNxQ,"There was a giant fox mural outside and cask-conditioned vanilla-infused pumpkin ale inside. 

Resistance was futile. 

In the words of the great Janet Jackson, &#39;Like a moth to the flame, burned by the fire, my love is blind, can&#39;t you see my desire?&#39;

Once inside we were promptly greeted by what I would describe as a &#39;fancy rustic&#39; vibe. What does that mean? Well, it means they&#39;ve got wood... and lots of it. Oh, you know you like it. 

The belly-up area of the bar was full on this past Saturday afternoon, so we opted for a table along the outer rim of the walls. After a looong day of detours and a pretty hellish experience attempting to patronize Goebbert&#39;s Pumpkin Farm (and getting no further than the madhouse parking area) we decided to hit the road before ever even technically leaving the road and the safety of our vehicle, in search of beer, and lots of it and I was about to dedicate the next several minutes to perusing the chalkboard list of Onion Brewery beer while visualizing myself drinking draft pints of every.single.item on the menu. 

I decided on their special vanilla pumpkin beer on cask and my handsome steed got something dark and delicious, but my beer memory isn&#39;t so good these days so you&#39;ll have to go there to feel out the selection for yourself. My beer was fantastic, but I might even have favored the dark draft a bit better. It was flavorful and deceivingly light with the sad metallic and watery after-taste that poorly made dark brews sometimes have. 

I wasn&#39;t too terribly hungry and I&#39;d already had my mind made up that I was there for the drinking, but my date talked some sense into me and we went ahead and ordered OP&amp;B&#39;s veggie burger, though that wouldn&#39;t have been my first choice (I would&#39;ve gone with nachos). I kind of expected it to be the boxed chipotle black bean burger that Costco sells based on it&#39;s description on the menu, and like I&#39;ve said before, I overdosed on that brand a few years ago so I normally try to stay clear, but when my guy&#39;s hungry for something, it&#39;s really not worth devastating him by saying it might not be the best option, and even though it was the pre-made patties, it was dressed up really well with ciabatta bread and the standard burger fix-ins, though no mustard... which was kind of weird, because anyone who&#39;s even vaguely familiar with mass-produced veggie patties knows that you need all the extra condiments and flavor-helpers you can get, sadly. In the end, the burger was pretty tasty and the quality bread selection really made up for the lack-luster cruelty-free burger. Oh, and their fries were pretty great, too. 

Our tab ran a little over $20 and some change and filled us up in both the thirst and hunger department. We left in good spirits and also kind of kicking ourselves that we lived so close to Onion Pub for so long, yet never made the relatively short trip in. So many thirsty days and nights- wasted.",23/10/12,336,4,1,3,-88,2.1912000000000003,2.535,1.5909999999999997,14.874999999999998,No,2998

The atmosphere is fantastic. Nice wood interior with a fireplace and vaulted ceilings. It&#39;s much nicer than most breweries and brewpubs I&#39;ve visited. The large U shaped bar offers a lot of seating at the bar itself, and there are plenty of tables for small intimate meals or for larger groups. 

When my wife and I arrived we were promptly greeted and sat at a table for two in the bar area. The service was very slow from start to finish. I don&#39;t know why, as the room wasn&#39;t that busy. It took a good 10 minutes before someone came to get our drink order. Then when it was placed it took a while before we received them. We witnessed our waitress chatting with the bartender.  During our entire visit we would go lengths of time without seeing the server to get another drink.  

For an appetizer we had the hummus platter. It was good. It wasn&#39;t fantastic, but we enjoyed it.  For our main course my wife had the Crispy BBQ Glazed pork shanks. She wasn&#39;t impressed with them. She felt that they were kind of bland and needed something to help add some flavor. I had the Hopslayer beer steamed mussels. I thought they were fantastic.  They had a great flavor. I shared some with my wife and she was jealous that my meal was so much better than hers. 

Their beer is okay. It&#39;s not that great, but it&#39;s better than the mass produced products out there. I&#39;m not going into a beer review here, but I will say that I am a little disappointed in the quality of some of their beers.

I have tried both the Paddy Pale Ale and the Hop Slayer in cans from my local Binny&#39;s but wanted to get them straight from the source and also give more Wild Onion brews a try.  The sampler flight here is called &#34;The Paddle&#34; and has all 12 draft beers at 5 ounces a pour (if you can down these, I&#39;m impressed with your alcoholism).  Considering I am the only one drinking however, I decided to go with the sample pours instead.  Each sample was a 5 ounce pour for $1.25 a piece.  

I tried 5 samples:

Chinwaggin Irish Red Ale- Decent red ale with a touch of nuttiness and light malt flavor, low on the hops (aroma and flavor), and pretty carbonated.  I&#39;m not usually a red ale fan, but this one seemed on the &#34;meh&#34; end anyway.

Jack Stout- Nice strong coffee aroma and flavor.  

Drago (seasonal)- WHOA.  This reminds me of Old Rasputin.  Serious imperial stoutness with its heavy espresso aroma and flavor, lacy head, and smooth finish.  It almost has a bourbony quality to its mouthfeel as well.  

Paddy Pale Ale-  SO MUCH BETTER ON DRAFT.  In the can, this beer is alright.  On draft though, it is downright delicious.  It has a super citrusy hop aroma and a nice bitter finish.  YUM.

Hop Slayer- Very similar to what is in the can.  Hoppy with a nice malty backbone and a high abv.  The ushe for a double IPA.

We also ate some nachos and some burgers which were good.  All the ingredients seemed super fresh but the food was just &#34;good&#34; (which is the opposite of bad, but it&#39;s not mindblowing, if you needed further clarification).  The service was amazing and the place has really nice ambiance.  It&#39;s like a classy log cabin for craft beer snobs (picture a lot of wood, fireplaces, and beer prints on the walls).

We had heard about the Onion Brewery, so when we were heading through Barrington last Saturday, we decided to check it out.

Definitely an interesting location.  It seems to be in an industrial park with a twist.  There is a very cool pond behind the pub.  They were setting up for a wedding so we didn&#39;t get a chance to sit out on terrace, but i imagine it is pretty nice.

Anyways, there was only one bad thing I can say about my experience.  When we were sat, we sat for quite a while before the waitress came over.  That is a huge pet peeve with me.  In fact, I have not gone back to restaurants for years because of bad service.  And if you are familiar with the Crystal Lake area where I live, there aren&#39;t many restaurants.  So not going back to one for years is a pretty big deal.  The waitress didn&#39;t apologize but she did make up for it by being extremely friendly.  In fact, she even held my 7 month old son who absolutely loved her.

I ordered the special of the day which was a wedge salad with fresh tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, a wedge of lettuce, of course, and a strip of steak rubbed with cajun spices.  The salad was awesome!  It was fresh, the blue cheese salad dressing was delicious, and the steak was absolutely perfect.  It was cooked perfectly and very tender.  The combination of the blue cheese and the cajun spices made for a great combination.

My girlfriend got the fish and chips which was also excellent.  The batter on the fish was light and flaky, just the way we both like it.  Not greasy, kind of buttery.  Very good.

The steak salad was great but I think the highlight of the meal was the pumpkin ale.  Just the perfect blend of pumpkin spices.  I highly recommend it.  In fact, I had two pints and bought a six pack to bring home!  As a warning, I&#39;m not a light weight, I can drink my fair share of beer, but the pumpkin ale was strong.  Which I  consider an extra bonus...but be warned I was pretty buzzed after two beers.  :)

All in all an excellent experience.  Great food, Great beer, our waitress was extremely friendly after the slow start.  I would definitely recommend Onion Pub and Brewery.

I asked the manager what his favorite pasta dish is and he had some difficulty naming just one.  OK, I can appreciate that.  He suggested the Penne Speziato which comes with Italian sausage, baby pepperocini&#39;s , portobello mushrooms, roasted red peppers, red onions in a marinara sauce.  He suggested that I could drop the pepperocini&#39;s and substitute one of their other sauces. I took him up on this advice and substituted the tomato basil sauce.  It was excellent!  Without the heat of the pepperocini&#39;s, all of the ingredients shared equal billing in this terrific flavor profile.  It was truly enjoyable.
Emily was our friendly server who took good care of us.  All of the above added up to a 5-star meal.

The delivery menu (and the menu in general) has expanded. I felt like a had more than enough choices! I ordered a half dozen of the baked clams, the Tortellini Veneto (comes with soup or salad), and the tiramisu. Like most Italian restaurants, I feel like it was over priced, but it was a lot of food for $32.

The food came quickly (they said an hour but it was definitely before that). I would definitely order the tiramisu and pasta again. Next time I would order the soup over the salad (the salad was boring and nothing to write home about), and I felt like the clams were bland and soggy. Maybe better in house and not delivery.

Our friends had pasta dishes that looked really yummy. I had a pizza with artichoke, prosciutto and garlic which was excellent. My husband had pepperoni and sausage pizza which was fine but obviously nothing exciting. We had dessert. We split the Oreo cheesecake and it was not worth the calories- it was blah in my opinion.

roccovinos-italian-restaurant-elk-grove-village,Don C.,NjQ1LkuroMpxK3XOuK2sdw,T_vtJ5ZVNplGj6wwvjljHA,"when reviewing a restaurant one must take in the totality of the experience. The food is key, but still only part of the equation.  Atmosphere, access, quality and value all play a role. When you figure that in, RoccoVino&#39;s makes the grade.

Easy to get to, plenty of parking and a relaxed atmosphere are a great start. Friendly and knowledgeable staff led by Alex paves the way to a nice evening. The food is excellent throughout, nice portion size and priced reasonably.

Pizza is terrific, nice chew to the crust and excellent sauce. Lasagna, a usual weakness at many places is marvelous in spite of a little fennel dominance. Huge portion could feed two.

Chicken and veal dishes first rate. Pasta served al dente&#39;; good scratch sauces and they are justifiably proud of their vodka sauce. Nice carbonara as well.

They have specials, and the Tuesday half price pizza might be the steal of the century. A marvelous extra large &#39;Rocco&#39;s best&#39; with sausage, pepperoni, bacon and Italian beef at $27 is a good buy.

For $13.50 it&#39;s a genuine steal. Beer and wine specials abound. While not exactly &#39;cheap&#39;; one can spend a nice penny if you go after their best offerings, the value they do offer is off the charts good.

Overall, great Italian food served by friendly people with tons of value. What&#39;s not to like?...",10/02/16,179,5,3,5,86,7.000900000000001,5.291,0.907,13.802,No,1353

As soon as we walked in the door, we were instantly greeted with enthusiasm and were directed to a gentleman that would assist us with seating.  He was just as pleasant and lovely to speak with as he escorted us to our table.  As he was seating us, he thanked us for coming in and provided us with a feeling of excitement to see us, as if he knew us, which he did not (from my experience restaurants don&#39;t thank you upon your arrival, it was nice not to hear it half whimpered upon my departure).  The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and gave a very comfortable feel with seemingly satisfied patrons that also appeared to be regulars.  

We hadn&#39;t ordered yet or been greeted by our waitress during this short time, yet we felt so welcomed and was viewing what appeared to be surrounded by routine happy patrons. Both myself and my co-worker looked at each other and commented that we loved the atmosphere and joked that we hoped the food matched the good feelings. 

We ordered Strawberry Daiquiris, which wasn&#39;t on the menu, they were still eager to prepare for us and they were delish.  The bread brought out was warm and the salad cold and crisp!  For the main course, we decided to go with Chicken Fettucine Alfredo.  The food was hot, not warm. Alfredo was creamy and chicken moist (definitely didn&#39;t taste like it came from a jar by any means).  We loved the food.

There were a quite a few desserts, we went with &#34;Death By Chocolate&#34; to go.

Our waitress provided great service and made us feel just as welcome.  She happily answered all questions we had about the menu. She never disappeared and appropriately checked in on us making sure we weren&#39;t in need of anything. As we were wrapping up, she told us how great the people are in the bar area and we were welcome to stick around for a drink or just hang out and watch the game (Cubs was on). 

Though I would love to be selfish and keep this place all to myself, it is a restaurant too good to stay hidden for long.

Our server was attentive and efficient and the food was fantastic. We started with the bruschetta which was elegantly plated. Each of our entrees came with a starter. My husband loved his soup of the day, and I enjoyed the homemade dressing that accompanied my basic but fresh salad. My husband ordered a special of the day - orange roughy - and he said it was really delicious and moist, with a light egg coating on the outside and a pleasant lemon-butter sauce. I got the spicy tomato sauce on pasta - yum! If you like garlic and a little heat, give it a try! There are big slices of fresh garlic throughout the sauce so you can tell it&#39;s homemade.

I went there with my husband and two kids on a Saturday night as a way of doing something fun as a family. This restaurant was overall very well rated and recommended. We arrived at 7:30pm and were promptly seated by a friendly member of the staff. The interior decor was simple and not too fancy and there weren&#39;t very many people as I hadn&#39;t expected but whatever; Here is where the waiter entered the picture. His name is Tony. He&#39;s a dark-hair, average to tall in height and clearly overweight. It took him nearly half an hour to take our order. Our order consisted of one item from the specials, one item from the &#34;chef&#39;s favorites&#34; category and a butter salmon with the house salad and a simple moscato. Tony didn&#39;t like what we were ordering. He wanted us to order a different salmon. The salmon Tony wanted us to order has tarragon an a type of cream sauce. My husband doesn&#39;t like tarragon. After going on and on about how we REALLY SHOULD order the tarragon salmon and receiving no response from any of us he started with the next question asking how we would like to receive our food and I responded &#34;as they come out&#34;. Tony&#39;s response was &#34;all at the same time? ok.&#34; Then he started to walk away at which point he stopped to turn around and confirm that we were getting the tarragon salmon at which point I responded with a simple &#34;no, just the butter salmon with the salad&#34;. His response is &#34;oh, I already wrote down tarragon&#34; as he spoke to me in a demeaning tone as if he was a parent who was very annoyed at a child.... and that look of disapproval :( I felt guilty and uncomfortable at that point but I didn&#39;t have the heart have my family walk out of the restaurant and start all over with finding a new restaurant and traveling there with the possibility to not like something again. So there I sat, and no one talked until Tony our waiter came back and asked what do you want the salmon with? To my shock and with utter disbelief in my eyes, I told him the salad. The look he gave me was of a total diva looking down on an outsider. Wow. This guy clearly didn&#39;t like me and when he asked with which sauce my husband chimed in and politely said with a smile that any will do and that we would definitely try the tarragon salmon the next time we come. 
SO, there we all sat in uncomfortable silence for nearly an hour before our food arrived and ALTOGETHER....so not the &#34;as they come off the stove&#34; type. So, we didn&#39;t end up sharing as much as we had planned to do so, no one was in the mood. Long story short, The food was great but the service spoke volumes as to why we were only one of 4 table here on a Saturday night with only our friend Tony to &#34;wait&#34; on everyone. Some tables seemed to get constant attention but the only attention we got was the water and plate guy. When our food did get here Tony took my clean silverware away seemingly on purpose to which I finally changed my tone and said, &#34;so what, I don&#39;t get a fork now either?&#34; He looked at me a bit confused and after a pause said that he would get another one. Over lunch the following day my husband expressed how he feels and thoroughly believes that we were discriminated against and to his credit we are not white. He also made it clear that unfortunately we won&#39;t be going back, irregardless of the food :( Thanks Tony.",13/03/16,350,2,1,2,-5,1.4221000000000001,2.8810000000000007,1.9750000000000003,25.142999999999997,No,3456

This place is a real keeper. The ambiance was not stale - we watched all the servers and they have obviously been schooled in their craft from napkin placement to how to make guests feel at home.  

This is more than just a pizza place.  The pizza is very good and they make it very available

The service was poor at best.

The food was terrible.

My wife&#39;s gnocchi was not as described by the menu or the waitress..

Our son&#39;s pasta was so bad he just left it and ate the bread.

I ordered the chicken parm which appeared to be a frozen chicken patty microwaved with watery noodles and bottled sauce poured over the mess.  

We couldn&#39;t get our waitresses attention for love nor money to let her know we weren&#39;t pleased with our food. After about thirty five minutes the waitress wander by so we could ask for the check. Seems she knew the food wasn&#39;t any good and didn&#39;t want to deal with it. The manager also worked the room but never once came by our table.

As we were walking out we saw the manager who actually went out of his way to avoid us. As we were walking towards the exit he turned away from us to make small talk with a couple waiting for their table,

Luckily they were able to seat us without a problem (party of 7 can sometimes be tough) however I would recommend making a reservation at this restaurant. They have a range of items to chose on their menu.. I had a tough time deciding what to order as everything sounded appetizing. I started with a wedge salad, which had an interesting dressing on it. For dinner, I ended up ordering the perogies which I&#39;m so happy I did because they were amazing!! They were cooked perfectly and the sauce that came with them was delicious. One of my friends ordered the lamb shank and it looked amazing - I&#39;d prob recommend this just based on seeing it (he did say it was really good too). 

Overall, if I were back in St. Charles again I would definitely go here. Our waitress was really sweet and she put up with the poor jokes that my friends made with her which makes her like a saint! We had a great dinner and no complaints!",15/11/16,107,4,1,5,-1,5.575,2.6559999999999993,0.554,6.79,No,1039
the-finery-and-blacksmith-bar-st-charles,Kerri L.,FvB8J1sLOM84V_YhWRXDjg,#NAME?,"This restaurant recently opened up in St. Charles, and i&#39;m glad that it did. Highly recommend it, the majority of the meal was absolutely fantastic.

The charcuterie board consisted of Point Reyes blue cheese, Hand dipped ricotta with local honey, Anabasque, House made Pork &amp;Truffle terrine, Italian proscuitto di parma aged 600 days, and Mild Spanish chorizo. It&#39;s served with cinnamon raisin and sourdough toast points, pear puree, housemade stone ground mustard, and dill pickles. I&#39;m a huge fan of adult lunchables ( Oh yeah, you know that&#39;s what that is :D), and these were amazing. The combinations were fantastic, and individually they were great on their own. My personal favorites were the blue cheese and the pork and truffle terrine. I would go back just for the charcuterie. 

The sumac lamb chop starter comes with sumac spice, quinoa cake, mint and orange gremolata, cipollini onions, and a cucumber creme. Both of us loved it, all of the elements really went well together and the lamb chops were perfectly cooked.

The wedge salad was ok, but the salad dressing is so strong it overpowers everything else. It&#39;s really spicy and peppery, you don&#39;t really get any blue cheese from it. We asked the waitress about it and she said that they add their house made mustard to it. If you dig spicy then go for it, but I would recommend not adding pepper to it, i&#39;m glad we skipped out on that. We dig spicy so we were fine, but there&#39;s no mention on the menu of it being spicy, so if you&#39;re sensitive to spicy and peppery go with another salad, or maybe ask for the dressing on the side or sub with a different dressing?

For dinner I had the grilled Ahi Tuna. It comes with israeli couscous with scallions and basil, and roasted farm tomato eggplant. First off, that israeli couscous was awesome. I would divorce my husband and marry that couscous. Freaking loved it. The tuna was ok, but the couscous and eggplant were my favorite parts, they were so good.

The man had the flat iron steak, it comes with chimichurri, calabrese potatoes, watercress, pickled onion, and parmesan fondue. The steak was perfectly cooked, and he loved it. 

Dessert we went with churros, they come with chocolate ganache and strawberry creme. The churros were perfectly cooked, they were so good. 

Now onto BOOZE!!!
We did not have any of the wine, so I cannot attest to their wine selection. They have beer on tap from local breweries, including the session sour from Penrose brewery which I absolutely love. It can be hard to find a sour at restaurants sometimes. 

The man had a whiskey sour, which he was a fan of, even though the egg white threw him off at first. I had a perfectly made dirty martini with blue cheese olives. Is there anything better than vodka and blue cheese olives? Yes, the israeli couscous from here. That&#39;s it, there&#39;s nothing else. I also had the cucumber cocktail. It&#39;s presented with basil and mint leaves, and looks really pretty. I highly recommend ripping those leaves up and muddling them in the drink, it really helps bring out those flavors. Really refreshing drink for a hot summer night. 

TL;DR Overall we absolutely loved this place and plan on going back. The salad dressing for the wedge salad was really peppery, and the tuna was just ok, but everything else was awesome.",05/08/16,403,4,1,5,-44,14.222599999999998,7.448999999999998,0.7649999999999999,31.785999999999994,No,3358

Pros:  good wine and beer selections.  Interesting menu with many items I  really like.  

Cons:  lamb shank had great flavor but wasn&#39;t falling off the bone as advertised.  Sides were not working well with this dish.  Spaetzle was overshadowed by squash and other ingredients - too busy.  My wife had salmon.  Undercooked to the point that it was mush in the middle.  Major turn off.  Service was off too.

It was a cool day so the beef barley soup was a great start. My wife got the grilled Caesar salad with a poached egg and lucky for me she shared it because it was outstanding. 
For entrees I had the pheasant, which you rarely see on menus. It is a signature dish and it was wonderful. In my youth I hunted with my Dad and pheasant was always our favorite. The breast was on a bed of risotto and truffles. The dark meat was like a duck confit but in a pastry pillow. Wow. My wife had the poached salmon which was ok.

Just park behind the Shell station and you&#39;re there. A great eclectic menu with specials written on the tile wall. We started with fried artichokes and a grilled Caesar salad, both marvelously delicious. In fact we all agreed that the Caesar was the best we&#39;ve ever had. The wine special was a pleasant Barbera. 

There were lots of other specials but we stuck with the menu, beef cheek and flat iron steak. The beef cheek was fork tender and very tasty. It had a dark sauce with sp_tzle, turnips and parsnips (not my favorite veggies) but you couldn&#39;t tell that by my plate. My wife&#39;s flat iron was also tasty and rich. Our friends had flat iron and pheasant.  We finished with pound cake, white chocolate, raspberry martini and pana cotta. 

This is a new favorite for us. It&#39;s about a forty minute drive but well worth it. I marveled that we found this in St.  Charles and not downtown Chicago. Oh and don&#39;t miss Mario, the effervescent and jovial roving host.",14/02/16,126,5,2,5,14,6.2538,4.3950000000000005,0.128,12.477,No,1082

We decided to come about a month after opening last year and the food was absolutely amazing. With the servicers being wonderful and knowledgeable of the food, and the food being to die for, we decided to have our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here. 

David, the owner, worked with us on giving food recommendations, putting a menu together, and also was just someone who genuinely cared about the experience we were having. It was nice to see an owner of a restaurant doing whatever they could to make their customers experience the best it could be, and David did that for sure!  

We had nearly 75 people and rented out the restaurant area for our rehearsal. They brought in a very well designed curtain to separate the bar area from the dining area which looked really nice and gave us the privacy which is nice to have with a private event. I know I previously mentioned this, but the servers that you get at this place are truly amazing. They educate you on the food you are eating and know the food that is being served. If that isn&#39;t good enough, they also see when a glass is getting empty and bring over another glass of wine!

The food we had for our event was the country pheasant, flat iron steak, and the salmon. All three are fantastic options and I would recommend any of the three. The cheese and Charcuterie plate as an appetizer as well is a must every time we come here moving forward. We have now tried almost every appetizer and a majority of the main courses and have yet to have a meal we both haven&#39;t loved!

I can&#39;t say enough about this place and the experiences we have had here over the past year. If you are looking for a place to go have a nice date night, or just a great meal, this is without a doubt the place for you!

the-finery-and-blacksmith-bar-st-charles,Jinah Y.,gCy1IYvVXJszKRGGTwrM8A,0u8E061P_5uQdQnqUrLGzA,"BAR: Tiny. Don&#39;t expect to get a seat, especially not on a Friday night. We made a reservation and still had to wait 30 minutes which was annoying but understandable since there is limited seating.

FOOD: What everyone else said--GET THE PHEASANT! I&#39;ve never tried it before but this place prepared it to be super tender and juicy. I ended up ordering the Flat Iron Steak which was also incredible with their chimichurri sauce. Another guest in our group ordered the Beef Cheek and was not entirely impressed. I love the Calabrese Potatoes but others in the group thought they tasted like dirt. We also ordered sides of the Romanesco (cross between broccoli &amp; cauliflower) and Brussel Sprouts--both were a bit crunchy for my taste but flavorful.

VALUE: The beets were a joke for $9. There were maybe 4 slices and although they tasted great, it was hard to comprehend that we just paid more than $2 per tiny slice. I find it funny that they charge for bread especially at such a nice place where you know the avg bill for 2 is going to be around $60-75. The entrees were fairly priced because they were so delicious!

Overall, chic atmosphere (although I wish the crowd was a bit more mixed), drinks are creative, apps and sides were okay, entrees were awesome, bathrooms are clean. Would come back!",09/02/16,153,4,2,4,13,3.8320999999999996,2.2969999999999997,0.5710000000000001,12.131000000000002,No,1311

The Finery is definitely a new location, so they are working out a few kinks- but how they handled all minor issues is the reason I am still going with 5 stars. I have no doubt that they will be fully 5 stars with no issues in the future. Let&#39;s start with the great- the food. Everything I&#39;ve tasted here has been excellent. The last time I went I was with a group of 9 people- and we all got different entrees (impressive I know)- and everyone loved their dishes. Several of us had leftovers, but not all. My husband enjoyed his pheasant, I loved my potato pancakes, and I loved the beef stroganoff when I ate their before. Everyone that had a meat free dish was raving about their food- so this might be a great spot for vegetarians!

Here are our minor issues and how they were handled:
One tap of beer not working on our first visit- free beer for the person who ordered it.
Reservation changed from 7-9 but they did not get the updated reservation. We had to wait a bit for the table- but they happily moved us and the owner came over to specifically chat with us.

Our service was excellent on both occasions- and I love the atmosphere and how everyone wants to go here right now! Special touch- we were out to celebrate my Mom&#39;s birthday the last time we went to The Finery and they brought her a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

I would definitely check this place out- and make a reservation in advance!",15/10/15,149,5,2,5,15,6.7299,3.0420000000000003,0.365,11.592999999999998,No,1499
the-finery-and-blacksmith-bar-st-charles,Laura H.,#NAME?,7qAuk-RoKgpffcJpZOQ3Vg,"This restaurant has some amazing hits and misses.

First the restaurant itself is very comfortable, cozy and a great addition to the tri city area. Second the service was top notch and you can really tell they care about the restaurant and the food. Third the drinks wonderful and they have a decent wine list.

Now getting to the food itself, some of the meals are outstanding and some are just lacking something. Our party loved the pheasant, the bread and the deserts. Unfortunate we had some huge let downs with the beef tenderloin and the beef stroganoff. Our dinning partners agreed that the stroganoff was off this evening. The dish tasted bland and was very unappealing. After reading such rave reviews about this dish and our dinning partners insisting it was usually better than this, the beef stroganoff was a huge let down. Our waitress brought out a replacement meal without a problem and without really asking which meal we would like as a replacement. While this was nice we were then charged with the replacement that we didn&#39;t even choose. From such a fine establishment we would have never expected to be charged for a very expensive replacement meal that we didn&#39;t order. 

We ended the meal with the apple torte, which was amazing!!! This place should seriously look at selling their deserts at a bakery outpost because they are amazing.

Overall the pheasant and the deserts are amazing, and some other dishes seem to be hit or miss. With that said this is probably one of the best spots for a nicer night out in Saint Charles and we would recommend it.",20/11/15,154,3,1,5,-1,7.896299999999999,3.790999999999999,0.7279999999999999,12.483999999999998,No,1582

The brownie dessert was very good as were the chirros. We could have just ordered one dessert and split it.

Our waitress Audra was super excited to be there, and loved her job.  She was passionate about the restaurant and boasted not only of the food, but of the chefs and the family feel with her colleagues.  That in itself is fabulous to hear. 

The drink.  The drink.  One more time, THE DRINK... I took her recommendation and went with the jalapeo infused vodka, cilantro, ginger syrup martini.  Twice.  And the second one was twice as nice.  It was a drink different than any other I have had.  Flavorful and spicy.  

Our food, presentation, quality and flavors were awesome.  She said seasonally the menu will change which is nice to hear.  

Dessert. ... the best I ever had.  The apple tart thingy.....  to die for, I may stop in to just have that...not kidding.

Have gone two times now, and both visits were perfection.

Appetizers: 
Have had the charcuterie plate, peach &amp; burrata salad, artisan bread and house-made butter, fried artichoke appetizers. All were fantastic and on point.  

Was surprised at how light the fried artichokes were, you could actually taste the artichoke. Loved the peach &amp; burrata dish, have tried making it at home and it&#39;s no where near as good as from here.  Charcuterie is just straight up delish.  House made butters were very interesting and fun to try.

Main: 
Have had the trout and bouillabaisse.  Both were amazing, but the bouillabaisse stole the show.  The best I&#39;ve ever had by far, get this dish!!  My family had pheasant (if you&#39;re a meat eater, try this for sure!  The truffle really compliments the dish, my husband let me have a couple tastes.  As well as the beef stroganoff (heard great things)).

Drinks:
Their beer list is good, tried their &#34;The Spark&#34; cocktail, very refreshing.

In Summation:
The chefs are clearly incredibly knowledgable and most importantly they&#39;re clearly very passionate.  I appreciate this, keep up the good work! Both times I went it was hopping which was fun to see.

No complaints with service. Very professional.

The GM stopped by to see how we were doing which was a nice touch.  I&#39;m personally not offended that the chefs/owners did not stop by as I know how busy they were (Fri/Sat nights), and I feel that that&#39;s the managers job (unless maybe you&#39;re an uber regular and request to say &#34;Hi&#34; to the Chefs).

Fried Artichoke Hearts - little to taste other than the crust - zero spices.  

Wedge Salad - good portion; blue cheese dressing would be a better choice for the wedge, not Kraft ranch dressing; added egg is a great choice. 

Bread - decent variety for 2 bucks.  

Salmon - this is where help is needed; the dill sauce added very little to the taste; the salmon was not fresh; not spiced and not cooked to perfection; should flake; garnishes were not correct choices.  

Flat Iron Steak - very good; someone knows how to prepare steak; garnish good, but potatoes so bland.  

Maybe would return - Shakou is better.  Good drink choices, but don&#39;t charge me extra for cubes on a rocks pour.  Servers need to learn the difference between bourbon and whiskey.

Again not over kill but just enough attention to make you feel like they were happy you were there and that they wanted to make sure you were happy too. 

Started with the Pheasant Pate that was excellent. I had the American bouillabaisse with perfectly cooked shrimp, prawn, mussels, white fish and scallops. My husband had the pheasant, which they are known for. After just one taste, without any black truffles, it was clear why! Both dishes were excellent, well prepared and served.

Dessert was the special banana bread pudding and almond pound cake. Both again were great and my dessert was on the house which was a pleasant surprise!

Thanks to using my Yelp app, I found this gem of a place. The Finery is a fairly new place in St Charles opening last July.  The restaurant has a small bar area with a few tables immediately when you walk in. The dining area isn&#39;t a large space, maybe 20-25 tables, and aesthetically pleasing with dark brown wood floors and tables, black chairs, exposed brick walls and high ceilings. The staff is extremely nice, especially our server Morgan. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, made great suggestions and was pleasant and friendly. Morgan provided great service. The gentleman who seated us and is the person who would work with you to pair wines with the food was very sweet as well.  My husband and I started with the charcuterie board consisting of blue cheese, ricotta and honey, goat cheddar, lamb terrine, prosciutto and goose salumi served with grilled sourdough and cinnamon toast, homemade plum jam, grainy mustard and pickles. It was fabulous!  We also ordered the bread with two butters, which consisted of four small rolls in different varieties with a caramel apple butter and a spicy mango butter. My husband ordered the cod for dinner, which was cooked to perfection with a crispy sear, moist and flaky and served on top of cauliflower pure. I had a half dozen oysters, which were very fresh served with salmon roe and cucumber ice, along with the grilled Caesar salad. The salad consisted of two halves of romaine hearts with homemade croutons, Parmesan, olive oil, anchovy and a poached egg. It was to me a deconstructed upscale Caesar salad. The husband and wife chefs are amazing and their food creations not only beautiful to look at, but full of flavor.  We ended our meal with the churros with strawberry and chocolate ganache dipping sauces. I enjoyed this neighborhood gem and will definitely be back to explore more of the menu.

I had the special for the night ( a German chicken, sausage, &amp; spaetzle mixture). It was good, but the chicken was a little tough. I did enjoy the spinach salad, although for $11 is was a bit small. However, the real problem was the length of time it took to receive or order. I think it must have gotten lost in the kitchen. People that came in long after us were served first. They did give us a free desert to make up for it, but I think they probably should have given us a free entree. Luckily, we weren&#39;t in a hurry to get anywhere. The other issue was I found the noise level high. They were playing some kind of a thumping base. Since we had to wait so long for our food, this constant thumping was getting very annoying.

I am so surprised to find a place like this in the suburbs. The food and its presentation has an obvious heir of professional chefs. You can taste all of their expertise, atleast in the dishes I tried. I will definitely head out of the city again soon just to have another meal at this place.

I ordered the cheese plate which was a perfect way to get me started with some really delicious flavors. Plus, who doesn&#39;t love cheese... amiright?? :P I also shared a salad before my main dish with my friend. Extremely well prepped salad with plenty of flavors blended into a crisp and savory starter. We had the beet salad and wow... Even the salads are thought out in detail!

The decor was nice and the wait staff was also nice.  The food was good but small portions and a little pricey.  The drinks were way over priced   I ordered my scotch on the rocks and then they add a $2.00 up charge for being on the rocks.  When I ask the waiters about it she said they added a little more scotch to the glass so there was an up charge.

The eclectic menu, the great service, the quality of food, the taste, the interaction you get with the owners and chefs all make this place very special. 

Any of their fish selections are great. The grilled Pear and cheese plate is incredible. My son ordered their steak and enjoyed it. I have been told their fancy take on a burger is a great choice as well.

the-finery-and-blacksmith-bar-st-charles,Marcia B.,Q78MISxvxlKVEtDpwp12Qw,igxQnfn4ZOBs21ztUKGjdg,"We made reservations for a Saturday night in early November. We had to wait about 20 minutes at the bar, where they didn&#39;t have enough servers, and the bartender ignored us. After 10-15 minutes one in our party finally made eye contact and  got a bartender to let us order a drink.

At least after that the service improved! Our waiter was very helpful and no problems there. 

We were asked if we wanted bread, we did, and were told there was a charge... The charge was very small I think $2.00. We got a plate of 4 different small rolls and on the side, what looked like a teaspoon or less of two different butters for 4 people. Geez..  It did have a nice presentation, but if your charging for bread and butter, at least provide enough butter for the rolls. 

There was 4 of us for dinner, and our meals ranged from fair to excellent. I had the beef stroganoff.. and I have to agree with Laura. H&#39;s review.. I love a good beef stroganoff, and this was this was not it.. it was very bland, I couldn&#39;t detect any sour cream in the sauce.. It was very fair. Another dining partner ordered the special for the night which was home made pierogi&#39;s. These were an expensive disappointment, It was like 28$ for 6-7 pierogi&#39;s. Now the guys chose better, one had the flat iron steak, which we did all try, it was cooked perfectly and excellent. My husband had the salmon which he thought was very good, but with it came brussel spouts that were burnt. 

Despite the expensive pierogis, the bill for the 4 of us with drinks was reasonable.  

There are so many options out there, but we might give this a 2nd try.",30/11/15,172,3,1,5,-33,4.2837,2.5540000000000003,0.6739999999999999,13.771999999999997,No,1625

Well I can tell you that they are true ratings.  My wife had the beef stroganoff which I tried a few bites and thought was excellent.  I had the seafood dish that I can not pronounce or spell.  It was a wonderful dish that had all of my favorite seafood, shrimp, scallops, fish, prawns, and mussels.  When we go back will order again.   

We had a dessert that was good as well.  

I thought the portions were perfect.  I like to eat and I went out satisfied.  Decorations are minimal but I am not there to stare at the walls, I am there to eat good food and for that they deliver.  

Side note my wife wanted a mojito and they do not serve them.  The waitress came back and said that they did have the ingredients to make one and would do so.  Bonus points from my wife.  

All in all good food.  My only negative was I can see how it could get quite loud from the acoustics of the building and that could turn some people off.",05/09/15,108,5,2,5,26,4.7794,3.43,0.134,12.436,No,1074

It did take a while to get out drinks(most likely still working out the kinks) but they were well worth it. I had a cucumber cocktail from their menu. It was amazing. No detail was forgotten, it even had what seemed to be a homemade cucumber ice cube in it. Our group had the following dishes, peach caprese salad, charcuterie platter, artesian bread, flat iron steak, pheasant, stroganoff, salmon and trout. For dessert, we had all of the desserts on the menu.. Chocolate fondant, panna cotta, cake, and beignets. Everyone was very happy with their dishes. The risotto that the pheasant rested on was super creamy and delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and the chimichurri was the best I&#39;ve had. The trout and salmon were too notch and cooked just right. The stroganoff was the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. The flavors exploded in the sauce. Every bite was a joy. I was surprised to see romanesco on the plate with the salmon. What a great pairing! That&#39;s a vegetable that you don&#39;t usually see. The peach caprese was also something I had never seen before and it was delicious. Even the butter that came with the bread was custom. I believe it was infused with some sort of red pepper.

Restaurant is beautiful inside, hands down. Staff was quite attentive on a, probably slower Sunday morning. Quite friendly overall. 

My friends and I went for a nice brunch and heard it was fabulous. And some things were... It&#39;s a hit and miss thing. 

Her eggs Benedict, which I usually abhor, was amazing. The pork? Absolutely a wonderful addition and the egg was perfect. 
The beet and mozzarella app was good, some pepper helped. The sauce and candied nuts added that zing of flavor. It just needed something...a little...i don&#39;t know, something to kick the beet itself up to compete with the flavors on the plate. 
My French toast was... Ok. I should have known better, they only had a few &#34;sweet&#34; dishes on the menu. It just didn&#39;t live up to what I expected from this type of restaurant. And... Most disappointing...NOTHING came with it. Not even syrup. No bacon or sausage or nothing. And no syrup!

The most disappointing thing was the bottomless mimosas. 18$. Heck no. And that had to be the weakest champagne ever that they used in them. Truly the OJ gave all the zip... The cheap flavorless champagne just thinned it out. 

Lots of potential here. Needs a few tweaks.",13/03/16,148,3,1,3,4,2.4764,3.4789999999999996,2.676,18.846,No,1246

As our wine was being poured they brought a crab cake compliments of the kitchen. It was excellent and we knew we were in for a good night. 

We had the fried artichoke hearts to start and they were so good we could have made that our meal. 

I ordered the 8 oz tenderloin, cooked to a perfect medium, and it was one of the best I&#39;ve had. The pure (parsnip I think) was very good too. My wife had the salmon, and I didn&#39;t even get to try it, but it looked delicious. I did have one of the potatoes that came with it though and it was awesome.

Decided to give it another try and there were several noticeable changes, all for the better. We were warmly greeted at the host stand by a hostess and then the affable Mario took over and saw us to our table and repeatedly checked in with us throughout our meal. He was beyond friendly and made sure we were happy with everything. He is a great addition - he was seen chatting with each table and could also be seen consulting with and directing other staff and servers. 

Started with bread service with homemade butter - well worth the $2 charge - excellent variety and very tasty. Also shared a smoked acorn squash with goat cheese and arugula which was very unique and a great start.

We enjoyed an excellent whiskey sour and margarita from their imaginative cocktail list and will have to work our way through the rest of the list.

Next, our entrees arrived and were phenomenal - braised beef cheeks with spatzle. The beef was tender and deeply flavorful and the red wine and beef reduction was beyond good. The spatzle was the best I&#39;ve ever had, as it was crispy but still toothsome. The mini pickled turnips were a wonderful citrus foil to the rich beef and sauce. The other entree was a special and consisted of a braised beef loin served atop velvety polenta - another home run.

Our server hit the right balance between being attentive and giving us time and space to enjoy our meal. Again, the service has undergone a transformation and turned this visit into a wonderful experience instead of just a good meal. The chef visited tables, including ours, several times to check on our experience and food. He is clearly passionate about pleasing people and is an extremely talented chef. As is his wife, who we did not meet but was apparently responsible for our sublime spatzle.

We shared a brownie for dessert, which was no ordinary brownie. It was topped with an orange cream and had pools of delicious raspberry sauce. The brownie had a crunchy base and was a very well-conceived dish.

Mario answered the phone - and invited us to come in. As a quick note, Mario is fantastic. Incredible service and passion to make sure we had a great evening. It&#39;s hard to overstate the value that he provided to our dinner adventure. 

We were able to get a table immediately, as the restaurant was approximately half filled at the time. Interesting note, they had put together a table seating perhaps 14 people or more, so this place can handle good sized parties.

Anyways, we were seated a little ways from other guests which was nice as it allowed us to have a nice conversation. I feel that the restaurant handles sound well as when I stood up to leave I hadn&#39;t noticed it was completely full (on a Thursday night).

The waitress was great and on top of taking care of us. We had the cheese platter (delicious), I had a nice steak and my Dad who had joined me for dinner had the Salmon. The food was all very well done. The cheese and meat platter I highly recommend - you won&#39;t be disappointed in this. The steak and salmon were both perfectly cooked and had a nice bed of sauce that went along with each dish nicely.

I could go on about this place - but just go there and enjoy it instead. Mario was a fantastic host and it was a delight to get to chat with him a bit. If you have that opportunity, take it.

I&#39;m taking my wife in a week or two when we get a date night. I&#39;m excited for round 2!",18/02/16,162,5,3,5,60,9.056000000000001,4.822,0.13899999999999998,14.039,No,1485

We dined on a weekday night and although the food was mostly up to its usual level, three of us ordered Cod and they were extremely salty,and the food came out unusually slow. Our waiter accidentally lost control of a glass of red wine which splashed all over my husband, me, into my purse in the floor and onto my phone, I felt so sorry for him and  I don&#39;t blame the waiter because he was new and did everything he could to make the situation better. Who I blame is the chef/owner who continued to sit at the back of the room, working on his laptop and talking to friends! We were practically the only table there and there&#39;s no way he didn&#39;t see what happened. Yet, he sat there and did nothing to help his staff or us. The waiter offered to pay our dry cleaning. We decided not to expect that of him because he tried to make our evening enjoyable. What should have happened is that  the chef should have come to the table and gave at least my husbands and my entrees for free. We had a table of 10 for goodness sakes. I&#39;m very disappointed that the chef/owner didn&#39;t support his staff in any way or take better care of customers even on a SLOW night.

One of the best meals I&#39;ve had in a while and that&#39;s saying quite a lot as I was in New Orleans last weekend eating at restaurants staffed by chefs from Top Chef on Bravo TV. The attention to detail was fantastic. From the beginning as we entered the restaurant and we were warmly welcomed, to the service and the tastiest food. We all started with something scrumptious. I had salmon poke inside of fried wonton sheets. They looked like 3 beautiful cornucopia. My husband had the beef barley soup, not a drop left in the bowl for me to try. He loved it that much. Our friends had fried artichokes with arugula and west coast oysters. Lots of smiles around the table. Then came dinner. Two of us had black ink pasta with shrimp and spring vegetables, one had pheasant and one had lamb shank with these amazing pickled onions over spetzel. I typically don&#39;t post reviews but I just needed to share. Honestly, I couldn&#39;t believe I was in St. Charles, IL. This was a meal that I would have expected in a downtown Chicago restaurant.

My friend and I came in this past Wed evening to celebrate her birthday. When we walked it, the air was on full blast and it was freezing! (my friend had to get a sweater from her car). We were greeted a minutes later by our server who was pleasant. We we looking over the wine menu, when the the server suggested that we try a tasting of the cabernet we were contemplating on ordering. We said &#34;sure&#34;, but then a few minutes later she came back and asked if we were ready to order our drinks. I guess she forget to bring us our tastings. We proceeded to order the wine anyway and it was delicious! 

I ordered the flank steak, medium. I asked for just a little pink...no blood. My friend ordered fish. When my steak came out, it was raw in the middle and my friend&#39;s fish was cold. We waited at least 15 minutes before the server finally came to check on us. During that time, we saw what looked like a tasty burger go by. We were curious as we never saw that they had burgers on the menu. When the server finally came by, my friend asked about changing her order since the cold fish grossed her out and wanted to know about the burger. They did in fact have a grass-fed burger that night as a special. We never knew about it because she failed to mention it at the beginning when she greeted us. It was disappointing that they didn&#39;t do anything for birthdays...even offer a free dessert with a candle. 

A short time afterwards, my steak returned prepared to my liking and it was very good. My friend enjoyed her burger/fries. The manager came over, apologized and bought us our wine. That was a nice gesture, but unfortunately with everything that had happened... it still put a damper on the first experience. 

I was also a little disappointed in the ambiance. It was the same layout as the previous restaurant. Sure, there are some cool light fixtures and wall paper but I thought they could have changed up the space a little and maybe had some fun music playing. The atmosphere that night was quiet and boring. I may try this place again, bring my husband and sit in the bar area (which is very small).

Had the grilled Caesar salad and it was a really interesting mix of flavors (if you hate smokey taste would not recommend).

Wife had an appetizer and the wedge salad as none of the entrees appealed to her.  It is a limited menu, with  about  one entree for each of pork, beef, poultry, and fish.

Very reasonable wine prices, especially by the bottle.  By the glass selections were well conceived and not the normal grocery store brands.

Service was good considering the restaurant was full.

My only complaint was the dessert we ordered - the brownie with gelato - it was minuscule and the brownie wasn&#39;t rich - it was pretty bland.  If you are going to size an dish that small it better be very rich.

RESERVATIONS / HOSTESS / CUSTOMER SERVICE
WTF. You call... If it&#39;s during reg business hours... And no one answers you&#39;re supposed to leave a message or try back later. Really? And if you want to make reservations just leave a message and they&#39;ll call you back... unless they get busy. Then they won&#39;t. 

And then when you call while on the way to meet your group... they don&#39;t have a clue and aren&#39;t taking reservations... too full... etc. Maybe you should respond with an apology and response like &#39;we will do our best to accommodate your party when you arrive? Pretty amateur... and seems like that level of service has happened to others.

Get on OpenTable or say you don&#39;t take reservations... but answer the phone. Seriously? 

AMBIANCE
Decor. Gorgeous. Love white and silver. Made me less irritated with the mom pop shop phone dealio. Lightning is perfect to make you want to chat and lounge... had to fix exposure on all the pics I took though. ;-)

SERVICE
Decent a little slow at times. Food seems to take forever but 2 hours isn&#39;t horrible if you&#39;re enjoying the convo. Busing the sushi bar (seated there after a 15m wait was fine...) seemed inconsistent. Putting the dishes on a nearby empty table seemed to help.

MENU / FOOD / DRINKS
It&#39;s a mystery... menu seemed more like an outline... is this to dodge promises you can&#39;t keep? Had to stick to well knowns or ask the disappearing waitstaff... so we stuck to favorites....sushi rolls overall (took a poll) were good but not amazing... dragon/spider/sapporo... presentation is better at Sushi Ai and Wildfish. 

Oh the Sapporo was a recommendation to me by the waitress... mediocre. :-/

Where this place shines is the appetizers and sauces. Seared Tuna was definitely delish. Crab cakes too. Fish Carpacchio... teriyaki sauce was light and not overly salty... 

The martinis tried were unanimously applauded as good and strong. Wine was also. My watery virgin Mai Tai was charged appropriately on the bill as &#34;Orange juice.&#34; I should have asked for no ice and more cherries.

SUMMARY 
It&#39;s quality over quantity which I like... but I&#39;m not gonna lie... the service needs to ramp up to justify $18 appetizers and $25-50 entrees. Pros are some of the menu items and interior... major cons are the poor customer service. 

Substance counts just as much as looks... imho.",04/04/15,309,3,1,5,-10,5.0138,5.3629999999999995,2.531,26.107000000000003,No,2557

The good:
When you pull up and see a strip mall, your heart will sink. But when you go inside, it&#39;s modern and bright. The hostess is very friendly. There are some minor design flaws that will probably only drive OCD suffers mad, such as the unevenly cut strips of felt material on the wall, but overall the room had a good vibe. There&#39;s a lively crowd. You will have higher hopes than when you got out of the car. 

Yes, as everyone said, the martinis are good. My pomegranate martini was fine, the pineapple upside down martini was above average. Go ahead and order a drink--you&#39;ll most likely enjoy it. 

The average:
The avocado and cucumber maki was fine, even if it took quite a long time to come out. You probably can&#39;t go wrong with simple maki. Order with moderate caution.

Oh my goodness, the bad:
Here&#39;s where it all fell apart. My dining companion ordered the chicken teriyaki dinner. It came out about 10 minutes before my entree. Very poor timing. And poorly executed. The chicken was bland and overcooked. (At least the broccoli and asparagus were good.)


Now for the pice de rsistance...the spicy chirashi. The menu said (I assumed chef&#39;s choice) sashimi &amp; vegetables in spicy sauce with caviar over rice. All things I love. What could go wrong?

What I got (10 minutes after my friend&#39;s&#39; cooked entree) was a bowl full of what was probably tobiko roe with rice (the two best parts, as they at least were true to the menu description), mixed greens (like you&#39;d get out of a carton at Jewel), slathered in gooey sauce,  sprinkled with chopped up, unrecognizable chunks of raw fish, and topped with unidentifiable slices of something that may have been plain tofu.

The waiter didn&#39;t tell me what kind of &#34;sashimi&#34; was in the dish--as he seemed a little disorganized and rushed--but it *looked* like bits of tuna, salmon, and perhaps hamachi sliced up into nickle sized pieces. It *tasted* like disappointment and broken dreams.

This is not spicy chirashi with vegetables. This was a very bad $24 seafood salad. The above description does not fully describe how horrible this was. If only my phone wasn&#39;t dead I&#39;d have taken a photo, as that would at least give you a visual representation of this culinary disaster. 

Summing up, if all you want is a martini, average maki, and/or broccoli and asparagus to snack on, you could come here in a moment of sheer desperation when you&#39;re stuck and starving in Hoffman Estates. Otherwise prepare for a $90+ letdown (including the tip--none of this was the fault of the poor guy slinging this garbage).",12/04/15,327,1,1,2,-17,1.5605000000000007,4.987000000000001,3.8070000000000004,25.206000000000003,No,2748

This time, based on other reviews, I decided to try one of their &#34;table-side martinis&#34;.  Wow!  A traditionalist, my typical order is a Gray Goose Vodka Martini, extra dry.  No foo-foo drinks for me.  But, I was intrigued by the &#34;Saki Martini&#34; they had listed on their menu.  And, it was amazing.  The taste was different from vermouth.  It had a slight sour taste to it.  Outstanding.

As for the Sushi, spectacular.  The only complaint I have is the price.  The service is great; the quality of the food wonderful; the ambiance is nice. The decor is Asian modern and very sparse.  The bar is all glass and quite beautiful.

Price-wise, I&#39;ve had sushi as good as this in places much less expensive.  25 miles northwest of Chicago should have some price advantages, but this is even more highly priced than the best in the city.

bistro-wasabi-hoffman-estates,Rose D.,FqHNMGc_-BgX4svll0SwLg,g59RCDnc7ti7c07Qe9nj5Q,"If I were basing this review solely on decor they would get 4 stars.  Sleek &amp; modern &amp; gorgeous inside.  Their homey strip-mall location does not do them justice in this regard.  Because of their location I was expecting more of a casual sushi-joint, which is what we wanted, but I won&#39;t hold that against them.

However, service &amp; food trump decor in my book, and that&#39;s what the 2 stars is based on.  As mentioned in other reviews, there isn&#39;t really much of a description, or no description at all, on their various offerings on the menu.  Maybe a sushi pro remembers what is in a Dragon Roll, but I do not.  The menu also does not list how many pieces any of the rolls are so we weren&#39;t sure how much food to pick out for 3 of us.  Some rolls came with 5 pieces and others arrived with more.

We came on a Friday night and business was steady, but they were by no means crazy busy.  You would think they were, however, based on the 2 servers rushing around &amp; being inattentive and the fact they only had 2 people working the sushi bar so food took entirely too long to come out.  We ordered Shrimp Tempura to start (it was entirely too greasy &amp; not great compared to what we&#39;ve had at other sushi places), a Dragon Roll, the Bistro Wasabi Special roll, and the Philly.  We thought we might order more but the 3 of us decided to wait and see.  And we certainly waited...for even just the Shrimp Tempura to come out.  At one point our server came over to say that things had died down now &amp; our order was up next so it shouldn&#39;t be too much longer (it was...and we still hadn&#39;t even received our Shrimp Tempura).  She said if we did want to order something else hot it would come out quickly.  Um...yeah, we ordered Shrimp Tempura ages ago &amp; it&#39;s still not here so I don&#39;t think so.

The Dragon Roll &amp; the Kamikaze Roll (which we ordered later as we wanted more food) were the only ones that were a manageable size to put in your mouth whole.  The Philly roll and especially the Bistro Wasabi Special roll were HUGE (just 5 pieces each but very big around).  Even for the guys those rolls were uncomfortably large to try and put it all in your mouth at once.  And, if you&#39;ve ever had sushi, it&#39;s generally not a good idea to try and eat a slice of a roll in 2 bites because it&#39;s going to fall apart.  The rolls were all just &#34;okay&#34;...nothing spectacular.  The hot rolls actually seemed overcooked.

Jeff wrote me asking if I&#39;d give BW another shot. I figured there wasn&#39;t much to lose and should give them one more shot. Finding a more upscale, yet delicious, sushi-centric restaurant nearby would be a great thing.

Not realizing they had a reservation ready for us and a fully seated dining area ahead of us, we took a chance sitting at the bar for our 2nd BW experience. We chose to not say that we were the less-than-pleased Yelpers until after food came out.

I&#39;m really glad we didn&#39;t. 
Aside from the incredibly loud volume of the restaurant, everything was leaps and bounds better than our first experience.

I never thought about pico de gallo in my rolls and I have to say it&#39;s delicious. I can now, proudly, recommend the Cancun Roll. So good and very refreshing for summer. I also didn&#39;t know Bistro Wasabi offers 125 varieties of vodka (yum). Divine and Belvedere Intense are where it&#39;s at.

After our meal ended, we had a chance to meet one of the primary owners, Jeff. Great guy and good conversation. He&#39;s aware of some of the restaurants faults and is working to remedy them to change 2 and 3 star reviews to 4 and 5 star reviews. 

Had Bistro Wasabi not reached out to us we probably wouldn&#39;t have gone back. The second shot was worth the trip and the experience. Everything tasted great. The bartender, Andrea, was hilarious and incredibly knowledgeable. There&#39;s a reason she has hordes of regulars.

All in all - they deserve to move from a 2 star review up to a 4 star review. Even on another busy weekend night, the service was timed well, the drinks were delicious.

To get that last, elusive, 5th star - they&#39;ll need to implement their efforts to reduce the blaring volume and continue to refine who they are. If I&#39;m going to pay $7-12 a sushi roll, it better be top notch. And it could sound silly, but they need dessert and to offer after-dinner options. Sometimes I like to sugar up before I head out.

We were promptly seated by a very nice and attentive waitress. I did notice it was quite loud from all the people, but it&#39;s a Friday night so it&#39;s to be expected.

We started out with a seafood ceviche and fried tortilla chips. The ceviche was delicious and had avacado, octopus, corn, tomato, and raw fish diced and placed on a plate with lime juice. With the crispy and not-too-salty chips, it was delicious. The ceviche is very fresh and the chips add earthiness as well as good crunch. The mix of a fresh acidic ceviche with warm, salty chips was great. Defintiely getting that again.

My father had a platter of sashimi (forget the exact name) for $30. You get about hte same number of cuts as you would at most any other restaurants. But two things stood out. First was the quality of the fish. The fish is the freshest I ahve had at any restaurant. Tasting it, you can taste the subtle flavors of each fish with a very clean taste. At other restaurants, the fish can taste less fresh and it destracts from the flavor. The second point is that the cuts are nice and thick. the chefs are not trying to steal money with this sashimi. This ended up being a very filling meal, something that does not occur at times with sashimi platters.

We also had the $23 Maki Karai plate. It has spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and Sapporo rolls. The spicy tuna and spicy salmon are unique in that the fish is not chopped completely like most places. Thus, as you eat these rolls, you can taste the flavor of the fish as opposed to the flavor being masked in other restaurants. The spicy flavor is a cleaner spicy as it&#39;s not from a cremay sauce or anything. The other roll was a mix of crab meat and shrimp (I think). It was good, but hte spicy slamon and tuna were the clear standouts.

Bistro Wasabi is pricy but it&#39;s worth it as the quality of the food is fantastic.",02/09/12,224,5,3,5,69,5.729600000000001,3.3160000000000007,0.397,24.287,No,1989

Since we waited a bit for our server to tend to us, the owner brought us a complimentary order of ceviche served with homemade chips.  It was like a lovely guacamole with shrimp. Perfect start.

Calamari tempura was AMAZING for an appetizer. I think I will be craving that for a while.
House salad with a beautiful light ginger dressing served on the side of fresh greens and long slices of cucumber.
Sushi that I had: Saporo maki which was crab &amp; shrimp. Very fresh. sounds simple, but it was very tasty.
Phili maki:  TWO pieces of smoked salmon, cream cheese &amp; avocado.
very fresh and only $7
Calamari tempura maki: large piece of calamari, roe, avocado, eel sauce drizzled over. SO fresh. only $7.  Could have easily been a $10 roll.

Great wine selection, martinis (although I don&#39;t like them) were interesting. Nice sake selection served in small carafe with glass ice ball floating in it to keep it cold.

I believe the hype killed it for me. Everything was good and i feel that the prices were fair, but something kept it from being super great.

bistro-wasabi-hoffman-estates,Scott A.,K-33joLzLIwr5T_RljBsTg,sUlOfCrMKacSrgdQUXjVfQ,"Getting right to it, I really didn&#39;t like this place. 

First the environment which is trying to be Urban, I found to be cold, uninviting, and sterile in feeling. It didn&#39;t help the temperature in the place was cold and maybe it was just me but I also found the chairs to be surprisingly uncomfortable. The benches have little cushions so maybe those are better. 

Food-wise it was definitely hit or miss. The beef dumplings and age tofu were ... well ... pretty awful. I don&#39;t like to be negative but I actually haven&#39;t had much worse. The beef mix for the dumplings was bland and had a bad texture. The tofu was like rubber. The salmon on the other hand, though cut thin and a little strange, was actually very good as was the super white tuna. I had these nigiri style. For me, that&#39;s where it ended though. The California and Rainbow rolls ordered were just mediocre which was disappointing; especially for the Rainbow roll as it was not only fishy in parts but also expensive at $14. Now I don&#39;t have a problem with a roll being $14 or even more but it should be pretty darn good not sub-par a typical $5-6 roll. 

Service was slow as someone else writes but otherwise I liked the staff and thought they did a good to excellent job. 

In any event, I personally can&#39;t recommend this place. Instead drive 15 minutes South on the same road to Sakura (pretty good sushi but only OK decor) or 20-25 minutes North to Kaminari or the other Bistro Wasabi which I&#39;ve &#34;heard&#34; many like better. While a bit further, Wild Fish in Arlington Heights might also serve as a great alternative for those looking for a good combination of decor, food, and chicness in the suburbs. 

Apparently some like this place though so if you do go just don&#39;t order the beef dumplings or age tofu no matter how tempting it may seem!",23/03/10,202,2,2,5,14,4.197899999999999,3.3180000000000005,1.927,13.756000000000004,No,1852

My experience was OK. Nothing over the top, but nothing bad. It was so loud we could barely carry on a conversation. The sushi was good, but not the best I&#39;d ever had. The presentation was nice and it was pretty cool to watch the sushi chefs do their thing. 

Service was a bit on the slow side, but it was a Friday night and our server was running around like crazy. All things considered, she did a pretty good job.

They have fresh (as you can get in the midwest) sushi.  The selection isn&#39;t a long list, but they put a HUGE amount of sushi in there so I think for the price, it&#39;s worth it.  Unlike other sushi places that have more rice than sushi in their rolls, Bistro Wasabi makes sure you get the whole fish in your roll! (maybe not literally, but it&#39;s pretty big)

I had the sake, can&#39;t remember which one, but it was delicious.  Never had it, but it went down smooth yet burned like vodka.  Yum.

I ordered a martini, which was quite good, and my husband ordered a beer. We decided so split three sushi orders between us. They lost our order ticket, but quickly remedied their mistake when they realized what happened. The sushi was tasty, but certainly not out-of-the-ballpark amazing.

bistro-wasabi-hoffman-estates,Maren B.,u77Ailx4nUncJxX1eT8jLg,PjGziEpl-3j1BtY7dNfz6A,"This is one of my favorite sushi places but the up and down reviews don&#39;t surprise me. The sushi is excellent although there are maybe only 10-15 choices for rolls. I recommend the calamari tempura and the spider. The prices are reasonable because each roll is humongous. It&#39;s actually a little embarrassing trying to stuff one in my mouth sometimes... and trying to bite them in half is always a disaster... Anyway, the drinks are awesome, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a lightweight but I usually have to limit myself to one if I&#39;m driving. They&#39;re definitely not watered down but they aren&#39;t overpowering either. Personally I find it incredibly difficult to find a good stiff drink that doesn&#39;t taste like pure ethanol. 
The decor is a little bit obnoxious and the acoustics are terrible. Fortunately the past few times I&#39;ve been there it hasn&#39;t been as crowded so I didn&#39;t have to lipread to have a conversation with my friends. But when it is crowded just forget it. I think a little padding on the walls might help... I&#39;m not quite as bothered by the &#34;cold&#39; feel because I really don&#39;t care if they&#39;re trying to be upscale - it&#39;s in a strip mall in the suburbs so I&#39;m going to walk in in shorts and flip-flops if I dang well please. 
And finally for the service... It seems like it&#39;s improving, but yes, it is terribly slow. Look over the menu as fast as you can and try to have your order ready before your waitress comes back so you don&#39;t starve to death before your food arrives.

They are a bit slow in checking in on you also so sometimes you feel like you have to flag someone down. 
My only other issue is that they are pricey, however, the positive side on this is that you do get a LOT of fish in your sushi and the rolls are very big compared to some places that charge the same for bite sized rolls. The Crab Rangoon roll is not on the menu but I highly suggest it if you want to try something completely decadent full of tempura, fish, wasabi mayo, cream cheese, scallions, crab, anything else you can imagine...like heaven in your mouth!

The place was in an unassuming strip mall (like most everything in suburbia) but when you walk in it is so clean, modern, slick and really sophisticated - one might think you are in the city.

I had Jay&#39;s special salad which was a bits of sashimi on a bed of lovely dark leafy greens a nice dressing (I think it was soy ginger based - not citrusy) and this gigantic maki roll with a mix of different sushi; salmon, eel, tuna, etc. They also had a good liquor selection too, lots of high end vodka which is my preference.

Underneath the top layer were a bunch of dry tortilla chips. I say dry because I&#39;ve had real nachos before and they have cheese on every layer. My wife and I thought we&#39;d give the meatloaf sandwich a chance. BAD IDEA. It was like biting into a stiff sponge. No flavor and it smelled terrible. 

The best part about our experience? Leaving. Well, the televisions are nice but I have a nice one at home I can watch.

rascals-tavern-and-grill-geneva,Dave Y.,gjYswPtXozBbcbGIcWzkkQ,RLqaDd2dCXB6k4zWPMcrXg,"Not sure what some of the other people were reviewing. This place is truly unbelievable. 

We went for lunch on Sunday at about 1230 the weekend before Christmas.

We made the mistake of ordering the pot roast nachos. I say mistake, because these could probably feed two for lunch quite nicely. And considering the size, the price is very reasonable. The chips in the nachos are made in house and nice and crisp (see pics.). The pot roast used, is tender and flavorful and the cheese is fantastic.

We should also comment on the service. Matt was our server and was at our table within 5 minutes, and drinks on table within 10. He was very helpful, and answered all our questions as well as being attentive to drink refills and anything else we needed during our meal.

For our meal, I ordered the jambalaya and my wife the Italian beef. She ordered hers dry, which at some restaurants can be short of a crap shoot. In this case however the meat was done almost perfectly and the meat juices still intact. She rated her sandwich very high, which for her is really saying something.

I can honestly say, the jambalaya is probably the only authentic jambalaya I have had in the area. I spend a lot of time down south and have had opportunities to try some that are considered the best and this holds its own. The shrimp are quite large and the sausage seasoned perfectly. Portion size is on large size, so if you try one of the appetizers, prepare to take home a doggie bag.

If I had any criticism, it would be the same for some others in the area: COKE PRODUCTS ARE YOUR FRIEND! No, Pepsi is not the same.

I really understand everyone&#39;s experience is different, but can&#39;t imagine anyone giving this less than a 4, much less lower than a 3. We will be back and bringing friends and family.",22/12/15,195,5,1,4,-12,3.6753000000000005,2.609,1.403,16.987000000000002,No,1797

rascals-tavern-and-grill-geneva,Nick B.,fmF0GzH-NA3hNauYY_i6mA,Y3-JydA7r1GOdS8QB2f_yg,"Mixed feelings on Rascals. I&#39;m surprised people are complaining about the service. The staff was nice and accommodating. The restaurant was modern, put together, and clean. It&#39;s the food that the restaurant needs to work on considering the pricing. Rascals is trying to do too much. You can&#39;t be a great sandwich, burger, pasta, pizza, salad, dinner, and bar food / restaurant. 

To be frank, my BLT wasn&#39;t that good. It just wasn&#39;t and looks were deceiving. The bacon was greasy and not cooked as much as I would have hoped. My fries on the side were good, but perhaps overcooked a bit. The french fries left a crisp taste in my mouth which again was strange. French fries don&#39;t usually leave an aftertaste. The standard burger, for $11, is almost McDonalds level in terms of toppings (barebones). I&#39;m sure it tasted better than McDonalds, but not worth the premium.

It&#39;s worth giving Rascals a shot if you haven&#39;t visited before. I&#39;m assuming they&#39;re reading these reviews and genuinely trying to improve. They&#39;re new, and I hope to upgrade this review in the future, but as of now don&#39;t expect much.

I was greeted right away and seated at the bar as requested   The bartender Zack immediately suggested a beer that was delicious. He even offered a sample. I ordered chicken wings : BBQ sauce and a patty melt. They weren&#39;t very busy but steady. The wings took a little longer than expected actually Zack asked twice where they were but were served hot. The BBQ sauce was a little too spicy for me but great flavor. The patty melt with fries arrived right after I finished the wings I ordered it medium well but it was still a pink. That was a disappointment considering I asked for no pink. The rye bread need a little more toast   Fries were okay I like mine crispy. So 3 stars because the service was great need to do better on the food quality.

When you walk in you could immediately tell that it was a family owned place and they made a lot of their items from scratch. Outside of the food they offer for lunch, they also sell various pastas and meats/cheeses to cook at home. 

I&#39;ve tried both the sandwiches and pastas, both of which were very good. I got the Buon Appetito sandwich, which like your classic Italian sub. The meat had great bold flavors and the bread was really good too. They also offer a create your own pasta option. I chose the gnocchi with vodka sauce. You could tell it was fresh pasta and the vodka sauce had that great creaminess with the tomato flavor. 

My only complaint would be the portion size of the pasta, especially for the price. I could literally count how many gnocchi pieces were on the plate. I understand its homemade and higher quality, but I also want to feel satisfied and not still hungry when I go back to work.

We arrived at 8:30 pm on a Saturday (apparently that&#39;s the time I always go). I guess when you get to a bar on a Saturday night at 8:30 pm and the place is practically empty, maybe you should leave. We had a group of five. There were 3 groups of 2-3 and 2 people sitting at the bar. We sat around for 10 minutes before the server appeared. There appeared to be one bartender, 2 servers, and one cook (from what I could see) on a Saturday night. We found out later (after waiting for our food) that they thought it was going to be slow so they let a bunch of people go home. Well...it was slow. But, apparently busy by their terms. We ordered (a bunch of easy, fried foods) and received our food 35-40 minutes later. No one came out to help us in that time or explain why our food was taking so long. Also, all of our water or drink glasses were empty. When our food finally arrived, we only received an explanation after asking. No apology from the waiter. However, the manager/bartender came over and apologized, and gave us 50% off our order. And doughnuts. But kind of a late apology. Why not explain and apologize while we were waiting?

I&#39;ve been to the Glen Ellyn location, which was okay, too. I don&#39;t think I put in a review for that one, but I ordered the same dish.

My group arrived 10 minutes before noon. We seated ourselves to a mostly empty restaurant and bar. They offer your standard bar fare: burgers, sandwiches, entrees, salads, and some specialties that didn&#39;t seem too special to me.

I went with the Kobe Burger (which probably wasn&#39;t Kobe; none in the U.S. really is really Kobe, but I have no idea) cooked medium along with a house salad. I ordered the balsamic on the side.

Our order was taken relatively quickly, but we didn&#39;t receive our food until about 12:30. The wait had to be between 20 and 30 minutes. I was surprised because the restaurant was empty (one big party had their food before we sat down). 

My burger was blah. Salad was okay; my co-workers ordered wraps, burgers, and sandwiches. My bill was 15.69; definitely not worth it. The burger tasted normal and needed lots of ketchup. I ordered it medium and it was medium well, almost well done.

The Specials are usually great, but the service kinda stinks. It&#39;s typically slow and unenthusiastic. This is fine for me because I&#39;ll just tip less, but I&#39;m sure the appropriate tip aggravates the servers, which allows them to continue to be slow, no fun and not happy to be at work. 

As for the menu, the apps are all decent. I do really enjoy the nachos by comparison to other bar type places. I don&#39;t eat burgers, but I hear they are good. The salads are all good too. As for the beers, there is a good selection and usually something is on special. 

Side note: we went for the family NYE 2015 a we probably won&#39;t do that again. It&#39;s such a shame, because the concept was awesome, but the execution needs work. 

This location has been in business six years, or is it eight, I think six, they just had an anniversary week, but some attention to detail is going to be needed to make it another six.

I had a good experience there, love the extensive menu AND by signing up on their email list I received a coupon for $10 off $25 around the holidays.  Score!  

I couldn&#39;t really get past the appetizers because I wanted to order one of each so instead of setting ourselves up for a food coma of appetizer or appetizers plus meal we decided to just get a few appetizers.  Although I&#39;m not sure I want to admit this but we ordered the &#34;heart attack on a plate&#34; and being their deep friend bacon...yes, you only live once so why not chow down on something you don&#39;t see on every menu, right??? Yes, so we ordered that, and well... yeah, it was a plate of breaded goodness, but not greasy or anything.

Tap beer should be served cold. Beer here is barely cold. Not much head and doesn&#39;t flow down the glass as expected. Food is also hit or miss. Being on the mailing list I&#39;ve received half dozen mailings touting St. Patrick days specials. However their advertising is deceptive. &#34; Shrimp and Scallops, macaroni turns out to be a mixed up mess, not separate shrimp and scallops. Not wanting the unappetizing dish my wife ordered a pot pie.  What was served wasn&#39;t a pot pie. It was a thick semi tasteless chicken and peas in a white gravy served in a soup bowl with a puff pastry thrown in the middle. Not what you&#39;d expect ordering a pot pie.  On previous visits I&#39;ve had the chicken tenders and hamburgers and both were pretty good. I had the fish fry and it likewise was good. But something we ate gave me great stomach distress for most of the next day. I think it was the tarter sauce. Any bar that serves 30 beers on tap should sell cold beer.

Lets start from the top:

1) The customer service her is AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!! Every single time we&#39;ve visited this location it takes, no joke, 20 minutes to get JUST our drinks!!! They try to give you excuses that it&#39;s super busy but it never is. It&#39;s just pure laziness! and they ALWAYS double charge on drinks and instead of clearing it up so you don&#39;t pay, they give you a card for a free drink the next time you come in...are you freaking kidding me?! AND they are completely rude when you do tell them that there was a double charge! I think the staff at this location needs a lot of training or they need to just clean house and start over again! 

2) The food is really not that great. I think I&#39;ve only has one item on the menu that was decent and it was the Chicken Caesar Panini. The other items I&#39;ve had there like loaded tater &#34;totchos&#34;, Kobe Sliders and the Pesto Chicken and Bacon Wrap were super bland but the Salmon was WAY too salty. 

3)They has a large list of beer but almost all of them are always sold out. I think they need to learn how to keep their beers in stock since they are a Tap House!

We will not be returning to this location. I suggest going to the Geneva Tap House instead. MUCH better customer service and food!",22/06/13,167,1,2,1,46,0.4366999999999999,1.7129999999999996,2.02,15.265,No,1484

tap-house-grill-st-charles,Vincent S.,1DCFppoyOv8ndShZdIQC0A,9Bu2tIWeabLrlgDR6_Ye-A,"The TAP House was a second choice as another, nearby haunt was too full. Parking was perfect and there is open air seating in pleasant weather. Upon entering, three of us sat at the elevated floor area and shorter chairs. Not many people, so seating was easy. Here are things I see right away. Lots of TVs with different sports. A large chalk board with TAP beers. A large U-shaped bar.Centralized bathrooms.  Lots of waiters. 
     So, the bartender checks on me as I peruse the TAP list on the chalkboard. She gives me a printout to explain each beer; name, brewery, ABV, size of glass, cost. I asked for a sample of a Scotch Ale and it was free, all done with a smile.
     I returned to my friends and explained the beers as they are not beer snobs. Almost half of their beers are from Founders in Grand Rapids, MI. ..... a fantastic brewery. There are local beers too. There are 30 - 40 bottle beers as well. We ordered Porters and Stouts, they were all malty delicious with good ABV.  
I went to the restroom. It was large, clean and easy to use.
I ordered the Tasty Burger, a house specialty. Fast service.  It was cooked with beer and covered with onion strings, lettuce, pickles, all on a pretzel roll. It was good but not outrageous or anything. The roll was dense and could stand up to anything, nice and chewy too. The burger was good but a shade bland. The pickles............AWESOME PICKLES. I wanted a bowl of them. The tater tots were great too. My friends liked their burgers. One was stuffed with cheese and jalapenos.  The other was a blue cheese burger, always good. 
     The mark of a real TAP house isn&#39;t the faux kilts, a beer list with Blue Moon or clad with a Guinness mirror. It should have open space to move, be inviting, a great selection of micro brews, including some locals, regional and nationals, It should have some Industrial Swill (Bud, Miller) for the uncultured. It should have a traditional game or two like darts.. 
     However, it should say Beer Snob! The TAP House achieves this with The Periodic Table of Beers. Harken back to high school and your chemistry class. It had a periodic table of elements, Pb, O, Au, Ag, etc.....molecular weights, etc.... Well The Periodic Table of Beers categorizes all types of beer in a similar manner; styles, ABV, gravity, etc... So, if you are a beer snob, hit the TAP House; good food, great beers and a nice &#34;BEER&#34; place.

My family and I have been here no less than 10 times, and we have never had the problems as described by others.  Staff has always been very helpful and accommodating to us (we have three kids under 5).  I have had numerous things on the menu and have not been disappointed by any.  My personal favorites are the burgers.  The steak tacos are excellent though, and the chicken fingers, are a hidden secret.  My kids &#34;order&#34; them, but I end up &#34;eating&#34; them.  My favorite aspect of THG though is the beer menu and the $1 taster drinks you can get.  I am starting to learn more and more what I do like and don&#39;t in terms of beers, but I am no expert by any means.  Add to it, that I love to try new beers and the $1 tasters are perfect for me.  I will usually order one beer that I know I will enjoy and then 2-3 tasters to see if I find a new one to try out next time I am in.

The last time I was here, I ordered the fish and chips, which used to be awesome-big pieces of cod that were perfectly fried and served on a mountain of fries. Now, the fish and chips is a sad little collection of greasy fish sticks and a handful of fries. I was willing to chalk that up to one bad visit, but when we went back for dinner today, the food had slipped downhill even further. We ordered their fried pickles for $10, and got about 12 slightly burned, super greasy pickle chips served on a bed of wilted salad greens. We didn&#39;t even finish the meager portion because they weren&#39;t worth it, but even though we told the waitress we weren&#39;t fans when she checked in, nobody offered to comp the bad app for us.

I had been to a different Tap House Grill the night before and LOVED it, so when asked, my friend wanted to go, too.  Especially after I raved about the food and she saw the online menu.  So we decided to go to this location in St. Charles because it was closer--BIG mistake.

The hours say they open at 11.  We got there at 11:05, walked in, and there was nobody there.  Not just no patrons, but no bartender, no waitress, no hostess.  We sat there for a while waiting patiently, and then started to call out &#34;hello??&#34;.  About 3 minutes later, the bartender comes out and says &#34;oh, we didn&#39;t know you were here--technically we&#39;re not open&#34;.  Ok, lady, then you probably shouldn&#39;t have your hours listed as 11 am and your door unlocked...

So anyway, our server was Ashley.  She.was.awful.  She gave attitude about everything, she rushed us through looking at the menu, and our drinks were empty for about 15 minutes every time before we had to ask her to refill them.

Plus, about 20 minutes after we ordered (so we should have been getting our food anytime...) the waitress comes out and says to my friend who ordered a burger &#34;we don&#39;t have any meat--someone forgot to take it out of the freezer last night&#34;.  OK, first of all, what??  And second of all, it took them over 20 minutes to realize this and try to fix it?  So they made my friend rush and pick something else while she hovered over us, and my friend hated what she had.

Plus, I ordered the homemade kit kats for dessert, and they were HALF the size they were at the Glen Ellyn location the night before.

Good points--the chicken and mushroom panini and the jalapeno macaroni and cheese.

Bad points--everything else

The owner is a classically trained chef who brought the family to the suburbs a few years ago, and put a definite culinary flair on his menu. Yes, you got your cheeseburgers, fries and the like, but where can you find freshly fried tater tots, and they even take those and make them into tater-totchos   -yumm!

The blue cheese mushroom flatbread is to die, along with a brilliant flatbread with apples, brie and homemade caramel sauce. Everything there is MADE THERE! Even the salad dressings. The other thing they do that is great is they offer different sides, like a salad instead of fries or tots, but a NICE salad. Hubby loves the wings, they are more like mini drumsticks.

Beer pairings are always mouthwatering too, they do those about once a month.

We started off with the Cheddar Ale dip that came with &#34;homemade&#34; chips and multigrain toast points?...  So the dip was just like a Velveeta with salsa dip, and not even very warm, the &#34;toast points&#34; were half slices of a multigrain bread that tasted pretty much just like rye and didn&#39;t go very well with the dip.  And the &#34;homemade&#34; chips could have been homemade but definitely not to order like most places, they were not warm and greasy like you would expect, instead they were cold and just okay.  **And we asked for more chips cause we were famished and there was definitely not enough on the plate for the dip, and they charged us $.50...how ridiculous is that?!?!**

So after waiting what felt like forever to get our appetizer, we got our food a good while after that!  Three of us had the stuffed burger and our other friend had the Cuban.  The one thing I liked was that they offered tater tots as a side option...and let me tell you...if you offer tater tots, I am FOR SURE gonna get them!!!  And they were very good.  But the rest of the food was just okay.  We weren&#39;t asked how we wanted our burgers and they came very pink inside which wasn&#39;t a good thing for O or myself (since I am trying to get pregnant and all).  The burgers tasted pretty good, but definitely not anything that I would HAVE to have at a later date.  

We were given our bill soon after we were finished eating which was a shock since service had otherwise been very slow.  But then I had to track someone down to take our bill cause our waitress went MIA!  And after the bill was taken, there was some BS about our Restaurant.com coupons that took an extra like 15 minutes!!!!!!!!  So...seriously...this place is just NOT that good.

How can we say no to free dinner?  (Lest it influences my review, we did end up paying only because we wanted to, not because he didn&#39;t live up to the bargain.  He was actually upset with us that we grabbed the check.)
Anyway, I had the Cuban sandwich and Honey had the pulled pork sliders.  He loved his sliders and I thought the cuban was pretty good.  I thought it was missing the mustard component to give it that &#34;tang&#34; and the pickles were more bread and butter than dill (I don&#39;t know what a traditional Cuban is supposed to have on it but I much prefer dill pickles).  Had the fries too and they were just fine.  The Mac and Cheese varieties look very good as do most of the meat sandwiches (lots of glazes and stuff).  Actually, the whole menu looks pretty good!

And let me preface that by saying I am a former bartender and make friends with our servers almost everywhere we go out!
No complaints with the food, although I give the salsa about a 1.5 on a scale of 0-5.  It was fresh, but not my favorite.
Tuesday night burger night.  Kind of a create your own burger. Burgers were great, decent beer selection, and along with everybody else, love the tots.
Service was another issue.  Our server Rachel seemed to have a chip on her shoulder from the moment we sat down.  Perhaps it&#39;s because we had the girls with us (a 9 year old and the birthday of our 6 year old).   Hard to pinpoint one exact moment that put us over.  I&#39;d say her attitude was bad and only got cumulatively worse.  Up to the point where everyone at the table heard our friend (adult friend) order fish tacos.  When the food came the server asked if we had everything and when we said no, we need fish tacos she responded with &#34;no, fish and chips&#34;.  And we all said &#34;no, fish tacos&#34; and she responded bitterly with &#34;well I heard fish and chips&#34;.  
Too much to go into, but an overall b...h.  We&#39;ll go back but if we have her, we&#39;ll request a different server.
As a side note:  when we left, my buddy Jason went to the manager and complained.  The manager thanked him for letting him know, stating people never say anything.

Here&#39;s the rest...the food is terrrible.  Calamari: so salty, couldn&#39;t stand it.  Side salad with Bleu cheese dressing: tasted like no dressing, there was something white on there and there were some croutons that were extremely burnt (black).  Thought they were pumpernickel until I ate one and spit it out.  Child&#39;s pizza: soggy pita bread with sauce and cheese; obviously not eaten by my son.  Ordered another kids item instead.

Really dug this place. Had the corndog-scalops, pulled pork sliders, and the chopped chicken salad. The food was tastey my favorite was the scalops. The menu was inventive, unique, and playful... a rariety in the suburbs where many bars have play it safe menus catering to the conservative tastebuds of the republicans who live in places like Saint Charles. I digress... We had a couple Two Brothers Domane Dupage which was on draft, that is until one round came with an Oberon glass... apon further investigation we found they had it draft, what a wonderful discovery in such a dreadful town....
I would have given the 5 but for being called the &#34;taphouse&#34; their 20 drafts were not that impressive, sure they have to cater to the locals, but I would have liked to see some more interesting stuff.

But the worst part was that the bottom of the burger had this thick layer of burnt grease.  At least, that&#39;s what I assume it was, but it was gross.  I ordered the chicken chipotle salad.  The chicken tenders were cold and soggy, but had certain areas where the breading was very crunchy - and not in a good way.  It led me to believe that they were cooked the day before, and then taken out of the fridge, drenched in sauce and thrown in my salad.  The lettuce was also incredibly soggy.  The service was great though, and our waitress was very nice.

My sandwich wasn&#39;t bad and the tots were quite good but who can&#39;t cook them as long as you have an oven. The calamari however were another story, painfully undercooked and downright nasty. We told the really unfriendly bartender who said she&#39;d take it off the bill but never said how sorry she was and that she hoped we&#39;d come back again soon and try something else.
Most disappointing was the bartender who spent most of her time behind the wall I assume in the kitchen doing something. She had a great opportunity to turn our bad experience into a good one if she had a MUCH better attitude.

I was a little shocked to see that I haven&#39;t checked in at this location until today. I&#39;ve been eating at this for years and I have had nothing but great experiences. Overall, I have been eating Lou Malnati&#39;s pizza since since the 80&#39;s and can remember a birthday party or two spent in the Schaumburg location on Roselle and Schaumburg.

Living out here in Lake in the Hills, this is the closest location and one of my favorites. Since you know I&#39;m a lifelong fan of Lou&#39;s, let&#39;s get food out of the way. Nothing beats the combination of the sausage, mixed with my all time favorite tomato sauce (it&#39;s the wine and the crushed tomatoes!), and finished with the sweet butter crust. Simply the best. The chopped salad and the thin crust are easily on my top lists as well.

The location itself has a barn/farm theme which seems out of place for a pizza restaurant, but then eventually the warmth and coziness (is that really a word?) take over and you feel right at home. The theme does make sense in that the building is shaped like a barn, but I&#39;m not sure if it was converted or built with that intention.

A huge round table allows conversation which for my family is huge. There is also a &#34;Lazy Susan&#34; in the middle of the table, allowing easy passing of dishes and a place to place the pizzas.

This is easily the BEST g/f crust we have ever had, hands-down.
We come in &#34;for the usual.&#34;
Mine: Garlic, green pepper and sausage.
My wife: Hot giardiniera and sausage.
We both just love their flavorful, almost cracker-like crust.  Most places try to make their g/f crust similar to the regular &#34;high-gluten&#34; flour traditional dough.  Can&#39;t be done and seems to pretty much always come out flavorless.
Malnati&#39;s has decided to make it as it is--crispy and nice.
Now don&#39;t get me wrong we BOTH love(d) their butter crust when we ate gluten, but this dough is pretty spectacular!

He literally came to the door-this adorable guy and said &#34;I brought dinner.&#34; I mean...that right there really warrants this five star review. Am I right?

Like...ROUGH. 
 Now, let&#39;s talk about the pizza, k? The pizza here is extraordinary-and that means something coming from a Chicagoland/Chicago native. Their pizza is top notch. It truly is deep dish. Not only is their sauce just the right consistency, but they actually layer tomatoes on top of it. The vegetables on my vegetable pizza were cooked just right (it seems like they may have been sauted in olive oil or something), the cheese wasn&#39;t so cheesy as to choke you, the crust is perfectly crisp-not well-done, not doughy, which is actually due to the several options you are given when ordering your pizza-they&#39;re serious about crust over at Lou&#39;s!

But I have to say this particular location is kind of weird for a Lou Malnati&#39;s. It&#39;s a totally fine restaurant -- nice and spacious, well laid-out, well staffed. But it seems a little too corporate franchise for my taste and very unlike their older, more authentic pizza parlors in other parts of the Chicago area. Maybe it&#39;s the proximity to the golf course. Who knows? But this particular store seems to be a little overdesigned -- more like a TGI Fridays or other type chain where you have the same kitchy decorations that come out of a warehouse somewhere and are shipped to stores nationwide.

At any rate, it doesn&#39;t affect the food. That is still the same -- everything from the buttery deep dish I have come to love to the chocolate chip cookie dessert that is so totally worth it.

We had deep dish pizza, cheese and pepperoni.  For starters we had some appetizers, consisting of fried cheese cubes, calamari frite, and fried zucchini.  All of them were very good, but I have had better calamari elsewhere, it could have been crispier.  The zucchini was served with ranch dressing and the calamari was served with marinara.  

The pizza was great, as one would expect from Lou&#39;s. They&#39;ve got a great recipe and the consistency from one location to another shouldn&#39;t vary.  The cheese was nice and thick and gooey, and the pepperoni was great and not greasy.  We opted for the butter crust and it tastes really good. 

The service was good, we were there celebrating a birthday and they had us in small room to ourselves, which was nice for our group. 
We&#39;ve ordered delivery from here before so we knew it was good, but eating in is always better in my opinion.  We&#39;ll be back to this one for sure.

A friend of mine and I have eaten there several times, in fact 3 times out of the last 4 weeks.  We volunteer at the Illinois Railway Museum, in Union, and the museum had been holding a Halloween event during, the month of October called &#34;Terror on the Railroad that started at 7PM on Friday and Saturday nights.  So, since Lou&#39;s in Lakewood is sort of on the way, we go there for supper.

This past Friday, Oct 29, we were there, and ordered our usual medium Malnatti&#39;s house salad (which is always excellent), and a medium deep pan pepperoni and mushroom pizza.  

About the time we finished our salad, the wait person brought our pizza to the table and served it.  As usual, the taste was excellent but the central part of the crust was rather of soggy - not good!

We signaled for our wait person and asked her if she could take the pizza back and put it in the oven for another 5 -10 minutes, which she immediately did.  While we were waiting, a gentleman, whom I surmised was the manager, came to our table to appologize for the unsatisfactory pizza and said he was making us a new one.  

In the mean time, the wait person brought our original pizza back and served it.  It was JUST FINE!

When we finished, and asked for the check, she told us our other (no charge) pizza was ready.  We asked her to cut it in half  and put it in two separate boxes, which she did.  

When we looked at the check, I saw that we had been charged for the salad and soft drinks only.

WOW!!!!!! That&#39;s customer service!  No charge for two pizzas.  We left a 150% tip based on the check, and at this writing, I&#39;m just about ready to pop my half-pizza into the oven for supper tonight.  DarnI If I just had a bowl of that house salad it would be perfect, along with my martini.

Aside from the delicious vegetable soup, the Tony&#39;s Cafe I found on McHenry Ave in Crystal Lake lacked anything special, and the lunches were not good.  I disliked the fact that at 1:30pm, they were cleaning up, including vacuuming next to the table I occupied while I was eating my food.   I felt that was incredibly rude.  My meal was not as described on the menu but the server never came by again until she asked if we wanted boxes, and by then, I had to leave as my lunch hour was over.

The food is breakfast oriented, mostly, but they do have a lunch menu as well.  Much like other brunch places it&#39;s quick and easy, only Tony&#39;s Cafe the food seems... more &#39;real&#39;...

The only downside would be, it&#39;s small, and because they are so popular they are trying to accommodate as many people as possible, which leaves little free space around you.  The materials are a bit outdated, and the joint could use a sprucing up.  That of course doesn&#39;t affect how decent a place this is to visit though.

Figured we would try this, as all the review seemed to be raves. We got seated right away, which was nice. The noise level was horrendous.  I&#39;m not sure if there is any way to dampen the sound, but I needed to lean over and have my wife speak nearly directly into my ear to hold a conversation. The place could probably do with a few less tables, as it has a crowded feel, and it&#39;s virtually impossible not to eavesdrop on neighboring parties.

I ordered the stuffed potato pancakes. They were interesting,  but my eggs were supposed to be poached HARD, and still had runny yolks. The &#34;more must be better&#34; theory seems to have been applied to the sausage gravy, because the dish was swimming in it.

My sister-in-law had better luck, as she just went with eggs, sausage links, and hash browns.

Very nice place with a good warm feeling.  There is nothing fancy about Tony&#39;s, just good old fashion comfort food and great folks serving it up.",17/12/13,93,5,2,4,42,3.7684999999999995,2.925,0.337,5.738,No,831

I had the spinach and feta omelette with onions and tomatoes added. The eggs were very fluffy and overall the omelette was 5 stars. The hash browns were also done perfectly with plenty of crispness. The raisin toast was slightly over toasted. My wife had the country special which was a couple of poached eggs on an English muffin with sausage and gravy. She said it was good and she enjoyed it, just not extraordinary. The coffee was good, but not noteworthy.

Tony&#39;s for breakfast? Absolutely. My wife is a fan of their omelets, I like the skillets, but everything that goes by the table looks great. 
The lesser known is that Tony&#39;s has great dinner too. I had ribs tonight (a special that&#39;s not on the regular menu). They were not your typical heat up and dump sauce ribs that so many places serve. The ribs were tender, the sauce cooked into the ribs not just dumped on. I was surprised and impressed. The dinner salad served before the entree was fresh green romaine a few spring greens, cucumber slices and firm ripe tomatoes cut in quarters. Served cold as it should be, and accompanied by a warm crusty roll. 
I rarely have dessert, I just get too full before dessert time. However, Tony made fresh peach cobbler, nothing canned, no corners cut. This was as good as any homemade cobbler I&#39;ve ever had.

the-saddle-room-hoffman-estates,Scott A.,K-33joLzLIwr5T_RljBsTg,VOgZCXNlWQHkovciTguK9w,"I REALLY wanted to like this place...   Saddle Room did some things exceptionally well but where it failed it REALLY failed.   


Let me break it down for you:

=== Atmosphere and Originality *****: unique upscale western theme in a somewhat tucked away area which is great!   Makes for a nice escape from the mundane feel of the the burbs and over abundance of restaurant chains. The outdoor patio and bar equipped with wood burning fireplaces are but just a couple of many details worthy of being pointed out.

=== Menu ***:  huge variety with lots of  not-your-typical suburban food choices. I&#39;m a fan of variety but in this case Saddle Room is trying to be too many things.     If you&#39;re a steak house sure have lots of steak choices.  Italian.. bring on a menu full of pasta choices.  But if you want to be a variety place, at least of the higher-end sort,  better to focus on a smaller number of options and just do those exceptionally well.  

As is for an example, the dinner menu has 14 appetizers and 11 salads!    ...and I&#39;m not even including the mini sandwiches in the appetizer count!

=== Food and Taste **: A nearly complete miss.   This was my first time and with such an extensive menu, i certainly haven&#39;t tried most of the menu so perhaps I just didn&#39;t choose wisely.   My server said the dishes I selected would be outstanding; one supposedly even being the best item on the menu.  Presentation was innovative and I&#39;d at least give them an &#39;A&#39; for effort but in result ranged from reasonably impressive (the lobster corn dogs) to average (duck / sides) to fail (the Tuna Mojo which should more appropriately have been called the massive mound of couscous).    As for taste, every one of the dishes failed to impress with the exception of possibly the Tuna Mojo.   The Duck was fresh but not nearly as good as the one I had at Beautique in NYC the week prior; let&#39;s call it average.  That said the brussels sprout leaves accompanying the Duck where probably the best thing I had this evening.   The Tuna Mojo gets points for being super fresh but again didn&#39;t really challenge the tuna at say Del Frisco&#39;s Double Eagle Steak House downtown for example.     The Lobster Corn Dogs, Brussels Sprouts [side], and Mexican Jumping Green Beans all sounded great but failed to have any synergy with their ingredients.   If you do go to the Saddle Room definitely take a pass on these last three.

=== Drinks ****: Had one: The Mommy Dearest.  I&#39;m more of a straight-up kind-of-guy these days but this drink was definitely decent though I have had several drinks at other places in the past recent days that were better.  Props for the little hanger on the side.  Based on this one drink and the atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place for drinks.

=== Price and Value *: I&#39;m usually the one saying &#34;Expensive?  What are you talking about???&#34;. However this place really can be ...for what you get.   Value is definitely relative.   I&#39;ve been at places that run $300 for dinner/drinks per person and thought it was of great value.   $150 for what I ordered at Saddle Room and not being even slightly impressed, NOT.  The main culprits were the Lobster Corn Dogs and sides.  The Lobster Corn Dogs ...mostly bread, hardly any lobster $16.95.The sides: Brussels Sprouts $12.95 and Mexican Jumping Green Beans $9.95.   Given the lobster corn dogs and merlot ketchup did not harmonize and overall was just OK at best, save $10.50 and get the mini corn dogs from Buffalo Wild Wings just down the road that funny enough blow these away.   They won&#39;t come on sticks but hey...    As for the sides, again fancy prep, which I am definitely for, but it just doesn&#39;t come together.    Even if it did, at these prices, the cost of the sides at Saddle Room are on par or more than the best places in all of Chicago.  Sides at Maple and Ash in the Gold Coast, Chicago&#39;s hottest steak house right now, range from $8-$15 but are amazing.  M&amp;A&#39;s Creamed Spinach and the Brococolini, Pickled Peppers &amp; Pine Nuts -for example- are both only $8 and M&amp;A is approaching the high-end; several steps up from The Saddle Room.

BTW Saddle Room, not that I&#39;m a spelling-bee champion by any means but Corn Dogs is spelled with a space and Brussels with an &#39;s&#39;.

=== Service ***:  Friendly and fairly reasonable.  Was off with the recommendations but no major complaints.  Could have been more attentive if anything and when I dropped some hints that the food was off should have inquired more or at least asked about those specific things again later.   They did ask in general if everything was OK which I quite frankly didn&#39;t feel like getting into at that moment.   

Summary: I&#39;ll likely come back to try some of the other menu items but for now I can only recommend The Saddle Room for drinks and light food;  skip for a full out dinner.",15/09/16,556,2,3,5,72,11.590200000000001,6.5120000000000005,1.8339999999999999,35.654,No,4947

Well, go where the locals go, I always say so when a friend of mine who lives out this way suggested the Saddle room for dinner, I gassed up the car and headed out.

The Saddle Room is interesting, especially if you are a horse lover as this place is everything horses, including you can do some Off Track Betting if you so desire.  Given it was a great night, we sat outside overlooking the marsh to enjoy the weather.

I ordered a Moscow Mule to drink and was disappointed that it didn&#39;t come in the more traditional copper cup.  I don&#39;t know why I think it tastes better in those but I do.

For our appetizers, we ordered the tuna tartar and bruschetta.  The server quickly came back to tell us that they had no &#34;fresh fish&#34; that night so no tuna or salmon requests could be accommodated.  Really?

Oh well.  So the bruschetta was interesting, served with plenty of mustard seeds and a bit unlike any I had ever had.  And since the menu wasn&#39;t really calling out to me, I asked for the after hours menu which had a build your own kobe burger on it which seemed like a better choice.

The food was really slow to come up which was surprising as it wasn&#39;t that busy.  And drinks were even slower as the server said she &#34;had to get them all the way from inside&#34;.  Odd given there was a bar out on the patio but it wasn&#39;t manned.

Our final disappointment came with dessert.  Our server suggested the &#34;cookie flight&#34; which were 4 different kinds of cookies.  They weren&#39;t good.  One was a burnt s&#39;more.  One was a jelly like thing with a weird mouth feel.  One was a chocolate thing and the best was s peanut butter cookie.  Not worth ordering.

My favorite part of the place?  The women&#39;s bathrooms.  They are like individual horse stalls each with a horse name on them and are really clever.

All in all, it was okay.  I was expecting more given the way my friends talk about the place.",30/05/16,212,3,2,5,11,4.652699999999999,3.823,2.6750000000000003,21.502000000000002,No,2002

Ambiance: Warm, cabin like feel with an incredible wood burning fireplace for those cold fall/winter evenings. Back dining room has an impressive wine wall that adds to the ambiance. I like low lighting unlike some places where the lights are turned up so high you need to have sunglasses just to read the menu ;)

Bathrooms: Horse stalls, what great concept, love it!

Outdoor Patio: Really enjoy their outdoor patio, it also has a wood burning fireplace to enjoy cocktails or snuggle by with your significant other. 

Food: Hats off to the Chef! They have an eclectic menu and some items do change regularly which I like. This is not your average menu so if you&#39;re not adventuress or a foodie like myself you may opt out for a place like Weber Grill.  If you&#39;re a cheese lover then try their every changing selection of cheeses paired with marcona almonds, olives and artisan jams. Steak and Eggs Carpaccio is also one of my favorites. For dinner I like their Duck or fish of the week.

Desert: If you&#39;re a coffee lover the Cappuccino is a must try! They roast their own coffee beans and the taste and smell if wonderful. If you&#39;re use to Starbucks bitter ass coffee then you&#39;re in for a treat here.   The desert menu changes often as well, some of my favorites were the; Avocado cake, Terrarium,, and Manhattan square.

They have VERY strict rules about their happy hour. I&#39;ve come with a large group of my coworkers many times, and if we&#39;re ever outside of the small box area that allows happy hour, they absolutely make no exceptions to honor it. I understand them not wanting to give everyone special treatment, but because of their strict rules, we opt not to order food/minimal drinks/go somewhere else altogether. I think it&#39;s a bit ridiculous for them to turn away business from a large party of 10+.

On top of that, service is always slow. Either that or the waiters constantly seemed burdened by our requests. 

The drinks are good, but they&#39;re overpriced and I&#39;ve tried several food items here, nothing is bad but nothing is memorable either.

We went there for dinner on Easter. The place was rather empty, of course, most folks do brunch as the meal of the day on Easter.


The menu was quite eclectic.  We decided to split an appetizer and a dinner salad.  For an entree, I had duck breast served medium rare with an excellent blueberry sauce on a bed of sauteed brussels sprout leaves.  When the wait-person described how it was prepared, I was a bit skeptical, but went ahead with it any way.  It was nicely presented, and after the first bite of the medium-rare duck, I was awed!  Needless to say, I had never had sauteed brussels sprout leaves before either, but they too were delicious.   My companion had a seafood dish, which she said was excellent, too.

We ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon (Louis Martini) for $49, which I thought was pricey even in an upscale restaurant.  The wine list was one of the longest I&#39;ve seen, and the high-end prices were out in the upper atmosphere.

We shared a very good mouse-based dessert.  During coffee and dessert. the manager came to our table to inquire as to our satisfaction with every thing.  We asked about the Chef, and the manager told  us her name,  (which I can&#39;t remenber at this time), but told us that she had worked with the well-known
Chef Rick Bayles.  .

I am an equestrian and adore the horse decor right down to the horse stalls for the restrooms. They did a great job of setting up the restaurant with keeping the off track betting in the back and separate from the regular bar and dining areas. 

My favorite part about this place are the fire pit areas. It&#39;s so nice to relax with friends around the fire on the couches and have a few drinks. You can even have dinner at a table and then move down to the fire pit for some after dinner drinks or dessert. I have not been there in the summer time yet, but will definitely go to enjoy their great outdoor patio with outdoor fire places. 

The food is fantastic. I tried the meat board which is delicious especially the duck bacon and the sun dried tomato spread with the toasts.

The short rib, skirt steak (probably my favorite dish there, can&#39;t believe it&#39;s skirt steak), duck and the coffee rubbed prime ribeye are all phenomenal dishes.

I loved the rustic look, the fireplaces both inside and outside, and the general dcor of this place. We were seated promptly, and the staff appeared to be very attentive.

We asked for suggestions from our server, and he was very helpful. When we asked about the asparagus side dish, he told us that it was a cold dish, and that it was excellent, but most people are wanting a warm side dish. His other suggestions were also very helpful.

We ate lots of their fresh bread with their signature herbed sweet butter. I ate too much.

I decided to order the Lasagna, and was not disappointed. It is not your normal lasagna. It was filled with wonderful flavors and things you don&#39;t normally get in a lasagna, like mushrooms! Love it! And the sauce was not your normal marinara. It was green! And so scrumptious.

The only complaint I had was the service. I mentioned that our server was very attentive, but that was only before we placed our order. After that we hardly saw him. We had to flag him down to get water refills, and to get our check.

the-saddle-room-hoffman-estates,Peg T.,HA5U4O3WDLHcAjthciE_EQ,WUaoRhISRCBpklfIoLo4HQ,"We certainly enjoyed previous visits, but the dishes have started to taste the same after a few times.  Tonight was the 5th time and most certainly the most disappointing.  We told the waiter we had been to the Saddle Room before and maybe that was our mistake. Drinks are good, if expensive.  
But the most disappointing is the calamari appetizer.  It was the highlight of the meal the other times, but tonight it seemed the deep fryer wasn&#39;t hot enough because everything was mushy instead of crispy.  I&#39;m just glad we didn&#39;t bring guests because that would have been embarrassing.  
My husband always gets the flat iron steak and loves it.  I&#39;ve tried various dishes including the duck, salmon, trout and tuna.  The duck and waffle dish is good if a bit cloying.  I found the taste of the dish lasted a few hours after dinner which lessened my enjoyment of it.
Tonight I had the smoked trout which had many flavor components one of which was a balsamic reduction.  But the glaze was just a decorative drizzle which didn&#39;t impact the dish at all.  I happen to love balsamic reductions, if I can actually sample them.
Maybe they were off their game tonight.  But I&#39;m not one to give restaurants too many chances especially when they&#39;re twice as much money as restaurants with better food.
My tip ... don&#39;t tell the waiter you&#39;ve ever been there before no matter what.  I think they try to impress newbies.
Our waiters and waitresses have always been very friendly and the restaurant is very inviting.  It&#39;s mainly the food that is hit or miss.",23/09/16,155,2,2,4,23,3.5843,3.044,1.217,15.740000000000004,No,1584

I couldn&#39;t find anything on the menu that really jumped out at me that I thought I&#39;d like to eat.  I did however notice that they had a Late Night Hamburger Menu available upon request, on that menu was food that I was more interested in.

I ordered a Cheeseburger, which I must say was really tasty, no complaints there.  The home made chips were also very good.

My wife ordered The Filo with Pork &amp; Chicken, see was not that impressed with it at all.

I found the ambience not so much to my liking though, but that is a personal choice on my part, I am sure others would like it perhaps.  It was very dark, cold &amp; I thought that the volume of the music to be too loud.  I did like the type of music that they played, but I would of enjoyed it at lower volume.  I found it difficult for us at the table to carry on with our conversation.

I found this restaurant to be too pricey for my taste.  I do not mind paying a premium price for premium food, but I do not fully feel that the cost of the food matched the quality of the food.

Our server was nice and informative. Drinks were good- with my dates sangria being spot on great. The food was a big miss for us however.

My boyfriend and I wanted to enjoy a nice midweek dinner, so on Wednesday around 7 pm, we headed over to the Saddle Room.  It is hidden back by Cabala&#39;s and I never would have found it if I didn&#39;t see it on Yelp first.

We were greeted and seated promptly.  Our waiter was super friendly and helpful.  I ordered the Seedless Martini which was a bit strong for my taste, but delicious nonetheless.  Our waiter advised us to try the calamari appetizer which is cut fresh upon ordering it, so we couldn&#39;t pass up that opportunity!  It was good, but a tiny portion for the price.  It was fried calamari with fries green olives, sliced jalapenos and lemon mixed in.  Besides it being a small portion, I felt like the ratio of calamari to other fried objects was minimal.  Also, the fried lemon was just gross, super bitter and not enjoyable.

For dinner, everything looked good, so we decided to split a couple things on the menu.  We had tortellini, Prime Pizza and a side of Mac and Cheese (with poblano peppers!).  If you know me at all, you know that when I see Mac and Cheese on the menu I have to order it.  Everything was really good, but again a bit pricey for what you actually get.  

We did have enough food for me to take leftovers to work for lunch.  apparently my coworkers really like The Saddle Room too because a discussion ensued over my leftovers!   Oh, and they have awesome carry out boxes with separate compartments for different foods!  Awesome!

I also loved the ambiance.  The wooden tables and fireplace made the restaurant seem very homey.  I want to go back in the summer when it is warm enough to dine on the patio!",27/04/13,200,4,2,5,43,6.709900000000001,4.852,0.487,16.66,No,1744

I really did, and so I had fairly high expectation for the creative menu and impressive space. Unfortunately the food and service fell short of what I was hoping for. It was just ok. Not good. Not bad, just at par. *Cue sad violin*

The space itself is snazzy - lots of (as expected) horse references like cool individual stall restrooms with kitschy names, dark tones, and, of course, off track betting if that&#39;s your thing. Once we were seated I was quite taken by their cocktail menu, which was the star of the night. The Indie Wild Mule is refreshing and flavorful, a big ole combination of booze, fresh juice, ginger beer, mint and cilantro. Party in my glass. 

The service during our evening was polite but pretty short, it felt a bit like our server was rushed and didn&#39;t really care to spend too much time walking us through their deep menu. We ended up ordering a two appetizers and an entree each...

Curry croquettes: 3/5: Flavor wise, this was the boldest item I sampled all night. Texture, though, was a bit of a mess. The outside was oily and thinly crispy, the interior super soft and mushy. 

White bean toast: 2/5: A trough size dish filled with a thick white bean and vegetable medley paired with toast points. I give them credit for the size of the dish, but was very disappointed with the heavy flavor of the bean dip and even more disenchanted that we were charged for additional bread when only two toast points accompanied the giant bowl of beans. 

Filo chicken: 3/5: This item absolutely thrilled me on paper - everything sounded super delicious. Once it came out though, not only was it heavy, it was dull. The apple flavor was buried by the pool of brie and heavy filo. The veggies weren&#39;t bright and it took quite a bit of salt and pepper to give the dish some flavor. 

It&#39;s a bummer when you spend $100+ on dinner (date night) to leave pretty unsatisfied. I&#39;m not saying my meal was bad at Saddle Room, but I&#39;m certainly not running back here to drop another benjamin.",24/02/14,254,3,1,3,-23,2.8942999999999994,3.8099999999999996,1.945,15.245000000000005,No,2053

I took my girlfriend here to celebrate her b-day as I found it walking one day on the prairie path while my daughter was in tennis lessons at Prairie Stone (otherwise it&#39;s a hard to find restaurant).  It looked really cool on the outside - the outside patio and wanted to check out the inside.

Pros
Very cool and different ambiance - darker, cozy feeling (some tables may be in areas too dark due to lack of window spacing).  I&#39;ve never seen a restaurant with this setup, warm and cozy stone sunken fireplace sitting area with leather sofas surrounding and fun &#34;tree&#34; chairs.

Areas of Improvement
- Food - my girlfriend ordered the tuna provencal salad and the salad had no taste to it - the tuna was fine, but was very bizarre receiving a plain green lettuce salad - especially at $18.95.  I ordered the turkey burger and was fine - not great, but not bad and the potato fries (per our waitress recommendation - shouldn&#39;t have listened to our waitress - they were not good - came in a cute &#34;can&#34;, but had way too much artificial seasoning on them.
- Drinks - we ordered kir royales to celebrate her b-day - they were way too sweet
- Service - ok - sometimes she disappeared for awhile (and it wasn&#39;t busy) and I was disappointed she didn&#39;t bring a candle for my girlfriend&#39;s b-day dessert.

There were also a couple inconsistencies in the food. I had ordered a medium well butterflied filet.

As a gluten free girl, I asked while making reservations if there was a gf menu. They told me no, but assured me that the wait staff would guide me through the menu and assured I could eat safely.   

We showed up a few minutes early for our reservation and I was surprised at how empty it was for a Friday night. Eh, that&#39;s fine with me though because  we were seated right away. I again asked the hostess about the gluten free options and she said to ask the waitress.  Well, this was an interesting experience as when I asked she said &#39;uh, I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t even really know how to cook.  There&#39;s so many ingredients in our things I could never guess what is or what isn&#39;t.&#39;   

Great.  

She told me to pick something and she would ask the cooks to make sure.  I went with a steak, hoping that the sauce would be gf.  Anyways, she did come back and assured me it was gf.  At other establishments, in my case, the manager or chef would come out to double assure me that I could eat safely.  No one ever came out to check.  Even during dinner, they brought out an in between palette cleanser.  I asked the server of this if it was gf and he (he was dressed nicer too, so I wasn&#39;t sure if he was a manager or not)  said probably not.

The most recent experience, which helped me commit to a mere 2 stars, involves what I can only describe as tepid lunch service at the bar.  The bartender, (his name I cannot recall, but he had a shaved head and a long, scruffy black beard) had no discernable enthusiasm, with me or any of the other bar patrons.  He simply moved about, seemingly avoiding eye contact, preferring to look about for napkin rolls or checking the inventory of the Heinekens (twice in an hour...there was a least a case in there).  He did not interact with any customers beyond printing a tab or taking an order, the latter of which he did only after myself and the other customers called out to him.  

Perhaps he was too busy, you might suggest!  If that were the case, it would be understandable, but its the day after Christmas, 1:00 in the afternoon, and the Saddle Room was far from busy.  Maybe he was filling in for someone.  Maybe he&#39;s nursing an egg nog hangover.  But whatever he was, he was not engaging or interested in his occupation.

The good: 
Went for my mom&#39;s birthday and had a fun time. The restaurant is gorgeous as is the patio. The horse betting onsite is fun and something different to do! Hostess was pleasant but could do a better job explaining the layout and offerings.
The bad:
Way overpriced for Hoffman Estates. Wine by the glass averaged over $15 which is about $5 too much for the suburbs. Entrees are super pricey too and there weren&#39;t any mid priced options. Food was ok, but nowhere near memorable in relation to the cost. The music was way too loud and the AC way too cold. 
The ugly:
The menu options are downright crazy. There aren&#39;t any basic options if you aren&#39;t feeling something creative. Service was friendly but very basic. The facial piercings are so distracting and just not a good look for those in the service business. 

All in all the place has so much potential but needs to get their employees polished and poised to sell the concept. The menu needs some editing as well.

tracks-cary,Kalyn M.,0-cuvbbQLycLh1QGKRmvNA,r09IWvGEKc1KOUO7kXE4tg,"A group of myself and 5 family members ate here for a birthday dinner and have mixed feelings about the place. We came (unknowingly) on cruise night, which was a Wednesday, but the place was still absolutely packed. We figured that, though, because it was also $1 beer night.

We went in to get seated and kind of just wandered through heaps of people until we found someone who appeared to work there. She told us it would be a 40 minute wait for a table, inside or outside. She seemed very flustered and not super friendly, so we kept checking to see if our table opened up so she wouldn&#39;t forget about us. I understand it was probably annoying, but seating guests was clearly not a priority. 
Luckily it did not take the full 40 minutes to be seated, and since it was cruise night, we looked at cool cars while we waited. 

I would highly recommend sitting outside if weather permits. The inside is tiny and everyone is packed like sardines and there is a constant flow of frantic workers and random people walking around. My 2 year old was with us, and she definitely would not have faired well inside. The place isn&#39;t super kid-friendly...which I understand because it&#39;s partially a bar, but they advertise as a bar AND grille, so the grille part could be more kid friendly. 

Right off the bat, they didn&#39;t have any drinks for kids besides a couple fruit juices that they use to mix alcoholic drinks. I got her orange juice. One of us ordered a CC and 7, but they were out of CC but she would have someone check for a bottle. My mom asked about martinis but the waitress said they didn&#39;t really do that, so she mixed her a simple vodka and fruit juice drink, which wasn&#39;t great. After waiting 20 or so minutes, she brought a water and apologized for not having CC. After another 15 minutes, she brought out a CC and 7 and said she made someone go buy a bottle because she felt bad! She didn&#39;t charge for it, which was awesome. I wish I remembered her name, because she was really good and attentive even though it was super busy. Now onto the food.

Cheese curds: I thought they were decent, Culver&#39;s has better ones. Cheese tasted fake but breading had good flavor. 
Fried pickles: delish! Slightly spicy and perfect amount of breading. Sauce was really good. 
Maui Wowi burger: delish! The quality of their beef is awesome and it was cooked perfectly. French fries are good too. 
Mac and cheese burger: way too much nacho cheese all over it, still good flavor. 
Big bacon burger: lots of bacon. Delish. 
Bucket of burgers: cute, yummy sliders!
Black and blue burger: way too much bleu cheese, but overall great flavor. 

We will probably come back again, on a slower day. Average prices, lots of food.

Food has been great here every time I&#39;ve come (about five times in the last couple of months). I would give it a five-star rating for food - both taste and portion size. Service varies from efficient and friendly to slow and I-don&#39;t-really-care-that-your-glass-has-been-empty-for-20-minutes. 

Larger room is crazy-noisy, so try not to sit in there unless you&#39;re prepared to hear nothing and to scream your conversation to your friends. Bar is better, decible-wise, and you can get full service there too. 

Expect a crowd and a possible wait (especially on weekends and at dinner), and be prepared to find street parking as their lot has (literally) about four parking places.  

Also a note, all the seating is high top (bar stools). If you plan to bring: short people, children, older people, people in wheelchairs, people w bad backs or people who can&#39;t maneuver onto a tall seat, keep in mind the tables are tall and the &#34;chairs&#34; are backless bar stools.

The place is a sports bar and grill, with the vibe of a local dive or hole-in-the-wall. We got a table instead of sitting at the bar. When we arrived as a party of six, there was a 20 minute wait for a table. The plan was to sit outside but it had started to pour. We were seated in 15 minutes. 

It&#39;s clean, with plenty of huge flat screens showing any of the games happening at the time. I watched Montreal allow three goals by Tampa Bay. 

I ordered the Sunrise Burger (egg, lettuce, tomato, cheddar) and asked to have jalapeos. Fresh, sliced jalapeos were piled on top. No pickled jalapeos here. I also ordered a glass of Revolution Brewing&#39;s Anti Hero. 

The burger is massive. It had to be at least a half pound patty. The egg was an almost perfectly circular sunny side up. It was served alongside a very good helping of fries (which are plain, so you can salt to taste). I asked for my patty medium rare and was not disappointed. 

Wow. This was a lot of food. The picture doesn&#39;t do justice. Delicious, not too greasy, and good beer. I will definitely come back.",10/05/15,151,5,2,5,27,5.667999999999999,5.083000000000001,1.026,16.891,No,1196

Had the Big Bang shrimp appetizer (not memorable)
Came here for Friday fish fry... It&#39;s 3:51pm and it starts at 4pm.  They won&#39;t let us order the Friday fish fry.. Really?  9 minutes... It will take that long to make the fish. Sooo. Waiting till the full 9 minutes is up so we can order . Rules are rules, right?

People are friendly, it seems people will talk to neighboring tables.  That&#39;s fun!  

Hubby ordered fish fry, since it&#39;s all you can eat I ordered a burger so we can share (in case he eats all the fish). I&#39;ve heard amazing things about the fish fry and am excited to try it.  But, the burgers look amazing!  There appears to be over 20 different ones on the menu.  I ordered the caprese burger with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, pesto and fresh spinach with garlic mayo.

(This review is a work in progress as we wait for our dinner)

Lots of tv&#39;s with sports on them (each a different channel).  Definitely a bar but with the added amazing food benefit.

The fish fry was super disappointing. The fish is incredibly under-seasoned. I don&#39;t think they use any seasoning on the fish or in the batter--maybe a tiny pinch of salt, but nothing else. After several heavy shakes of pepper, a big squirt of lemon and a lot of tartar sauce, it still wasn&#39;t gety good. The corn they serve is a joke--why even put that tasteless, frozen corn on the plate?? The potato pancakes I got were not hot, they were over cooked, but not burned, and again, lacked seasoning.

I read the reviews beforehand, and being the skeptical west coast foodie that I have become, figured that maybe the reviewers hadn&#39;t had the same type of &#34;gourmet&#34; burgers that are found in abundance out here in the land of Umami Burger, Father&#39;s Office, Plan Check, Pono Burger, The Counter...the list could go on and on. I am so fortunate to have had my doubts proven wrong! 

First pleasant surprise: Magic Hat #9 on tap. An occurrence so shocking it&#39;s worth repeating, ON TAP. And for what a west coaster considers a happy hour price. 

Huge list of burger options (there&#39;s plenty of other menu choices, too, but c&#39;mon get real, why bother), perfectly prepared, and so juicy they literally drip down your hands.

Today it was onion rings and homemade chips. We were told that they only get shipments once per week. How can a restaurant only have one food delivery per week, and consistently be running out of things for years?

Our server Dixie was inattentive throughout the entire night. We asked several times for refills, she forgot items we asked for--ranch, water, etc. Once the bills came we were still charged for the onion rings and had to ask for this to be corrected. It wasn&#39;t busy in the restaurant so there was no excuse as to why the service was as been as bad as it was.

I can&#39;t think of anything to criticize on the menu. Every menu item, whether it&#39;s an appetizer, salad, sandwich or entre is prepared to perfection. The burger menu is as huge as the burgers themselves. I will agree with one of the negative reviews where they say that some of the burgers are too big to eat with your hands, but I would not consider that an entirely bad thing. If I recall correctly, any burger can be substituted for grilled chicken if that&#39;s your style. Even the eclectic menu items are prepared as if it came from an upscale kitchen (when have you had seared tuna tacos in a pub?). What&#39;s definitely not upscale are the prices.

We were seated and greeted promptly by our server.  Everything was fine up until we places our order and things went downhill from there. 
After about 30 minutes we noticed people around us that arrived after us started receiving their food. The waitress also realized this and came to our table and explained that there was a delay in the preparation of my chicken wrap. She apologized and we were understanding. 
Eventually the food came. My wrap was bland and my wife&#39;s burger and fries was cold. Ice cold to the point it was not enjoyable. I can only assume the burger was sitting out for awhile when they were chasing the chicken for my wrap. 
I decided to tell the waitress we weren&#39;t happy with our experience, citing the long wait for food, the bland chicken wrap and my wife&#39;s cold burger. 
She was very apologetic, going as far as saying she would feel the same way if she were in our shoes.  She said there was nothing she was able to do and encouraged us to complete a comment card. We did and never heard anything back.

tracks-cary,Dominika Z.,#NAME?,l0_moWugIrHchbEAJsnANg,"I love the food here - LOVE. And if I were judging on food alone, this would be a 5 star review, but, other factors contribute to the three stars. 

First, every time I come here everyone working seems confused and disorganized. A few months ago I was playing on the slot machines while waiting to be seated and I got carded 4 times. This is petty, but c&#39;mon, communicate a little. 

What really led me to offer this review was mine and my boyfriends visit yesterday. The service was, in no way, terrible - but it wasn&#39;t great (or even good). We sat at the bar and everyone behind the bar seemed SO lost. There was no organization or method to the madness - which I&#39;d get if it were busy but it was a very average sized crowd which shouldn&#39;t have created such disorder. Whatever, we got our drinks and everything was going good. We ordered our appetizer (the spinach dip that we LOVE), a cup of soup, and our entrees. 

The Spinach Dip, which usually comes in a bread bowl, came in a normal bowl with a very small side of chips to dip in. I normally don&#39;t mind paying the 9.99 for this appetizer because it&#39;s worth it with the bread bowl, but with just chips, it wasn&#39;t. I would suggest that in the future you inform your customers when there is a change in a dish. If I would have known that I&#39;d be getting a lesser quality dish than I expect, and pay the same price, I would not have ordered this as an appetizer. 

A few other small problems: 
1. My soup came out after my entre, at this point I didn&#39;t even want it anymore. I guess some places serve their soups with the entree&#39;s, but most times when I&#39;ve gone out to eat these places have asked if I&#39;d like it with the entre or beforehand. 
2. When we ordered our appetizer and the waitress (bartender) assumed we were done ordering and we added that we&#39;d like an entre she responded &#34;have you SEEN the size of our spinach dip?&#34;. Like, what? I&#39;ll order thirty of those and twenty burgers if I want to, and if I&#39;m paying for all of it, what does it matter if I don&#39;t finish? When I asked to take my salad to go she even stopped by and was like &#34;full, huh?&#34;, in an almost condescending tone. Kinda annoyed me. She did seem nice enough but she was continuously rattled and I feel like she just needed to sit down and take a deep breath. She was stressing me out watching her. 
3. A girl that I assume was a shift manager was scolding two other waitresses in the middle of the walk way between the restaurant portion and the bar. I had to walk around them to go to the restroom and again walking back. This just seems tacky and unprofessional to me. If you need to discuss problems with your staff, that&#39;s fine. But don&#39;t do it in the middle of the restaurant. 

I don&#39;t intend to write this review to deter others from going to Tracks because the food really is REALLY REALLY good. My intent is for a manager sees this and it can be used to better the place and turn it into 3 starts to 5. I will be back, because yum, and hope that the staff can get their act together between now and then.",22/06/15,332,3,1,1,-24,0.16970000000000007,2.846,3.168,25.985999999999997,No,3141

We went last Monday night Mar 30. 
Walked in, strolled through bar (wife and kid following) found plenty of seating in the back. There were other families with kids, ((&#34;kid friendly, (however they must be able to sit on a bar stool)) and our server Rob greeted us promptly with menus and didn&#39;t grimace when I asked for 3-waters and the cheapest beer in the menu. They had a Corona special, but I chose a PBR Tallboy. I will note they had an excellent selection of beers. 
We shared a wedgie salad which was pretty good. The house dressing was excellent. 
(We will talk about their dressings and toppings later). 
For the main course we ordered burgers. 
My wife ordered a medium burger with cheddar, avocado, roasted red peppers and their Amazing Chipotle topping. 
I had a medium well burger with a creamy cheddar and fried onions. 
I would like to give extra props for actually knowing the difference between medium and medium well and executing it to perfection. 
Tip #1 cut the burger in 1/2 easier to eat with the generous outstanding toppings. 
Tip #2 they are generous with their toppings. 
Myself, the more the better. 
My wife, should have ordered the Chipotle topping on the side. (I would have been happy) 
Fries were generous and very good. 
Burgers are great size 10 oz. 
Excellent value for the price especially with the DYNAMITE Toppings which they don&#39;t scrimp on.

On the first bite all I could concentrate on was still cold slices on mozzarella. My bun was soaked from the rare burger so I had to then eat it with a fork.

A few weeks prior I had the same experience with a to-go order, under cooked and this time it was all just slammed into the container ingredients all over like they had shaken it before giving it to me. Which I do understand it was a Friday which is their busiest night with fish fry and such but I would have waited another 10 minutes to know that I got what I ordered and that is was taken care of.",17/08/14,103,1,1,3,-10,2.1586000000000003,0.7869999999999999,0.154,10.059000000000001,No,1090

I just came here after not being here in two years because I moved out of state. I think this place actually got better. The owner (I assume) makes you feel like you&#39;re walking into a family member&#39;s house. The service is quick, the food is perfectly delicious, and the atmosphere is just right (what can I say, I hate restaurants that make me wish I had a winter coat the whole time).",07/10/16,53,5,2,3,13,2.3440000000000003,1.142,0.092,3.766,No,467
gus-diner-rolling-meadows,Anthony R.,F6mSHdSGR31SglFOuA22Mg,4OLP8-HX4tfROLldhTOQRA,"I will begin by saying that I really wanted to like this place.  My fianc and I go out to eat breakfast every weekend, and this would be the closest, and most convenient place for us.  I was instantly turned off when walking in when I saw that their tables and chairs were plastic with what looked like plastic garbage bags taped on as tablecloths.  We still sat down and gave the place the benefit of the doubt.  The workers seemed friendly, it couldn&#39;t be that bad could it???  Well upon looking at the menu, I saw that everything was about a dollar or so more expensive than their menu stated online.  This really frustrated me, it does not cost you anything but time to update you menu online, and in this day and age, that is totally unexcusable and misleads you customers.  Yet once again, we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and continued our breakfast.  We both ordered the country fried steak meal.  I ordered my eggs sunny side up (which shouldn&#39;t be a problem at any breakfast place), I splurged and got the extra egg. 

The food arrived fairly quickly, but we were both turned off to see our eggs laid on top of our country fried steak.  I&#39;m totally a person who does not want my gravy and eggs to cross.  To top it off one of my eggs was broken and my eggs were very overcooked.  Eggs shouldn&#39;t be something that a breakfast place has issues with...  The toast was well cooked and buttered though.  Sadly the toast was the highlight of my meal.  The country fried steak was okay, nothing memorable or that would make me come back.  We have ordered the same meal at multiple locations around the area, and our tab is usually right about $25 +/- $1.  Our tab at Gus&#39;s was $30 and change.  

Long story short Gus&#39; is overpriced to the area, and the food is only average at best.  Tables/seating disappointing, but the people seemed okay.  I personally wouldn&#39;t recommend it as there are multiple better options that are close.",08/08/16,217,2,2,4,43,3.579,2.62,1.1869999999999998,17.195000000000004,No,1977

I had a great, simple meal--one of the scrambler plates, which came with delicious potatoes and toast or pancakes; I opted for the pancakes and I&#39;m so glad I did. They were so yummy--light, fluffy and flavorful. I asked for a biscuit on the side just because I&#39;ve been on something of a personal quest for years to find the best biscuits in the Chicago metro area. Gus&#39;s diner&#39;s biscuits make my list! It was a really good biscuit. I was really hungry when I walked in, and loved everything. Good coffee, too.

gus-diner-rolling-meadows,Steve C.,_ZWhKn80RUUNMpMJe_IMgQ,Jv6mtvZTi1qW00wlYwK2HA,"Lets start out with my first impression here, it&#39;s a small strip mall restaurant crowded with cheesy Applebee&#39;s-style 50&#39;s memorabilia.  We had to wait 25 minutes for seats while three empty booths were left unattended covered in filth and dirty dishes.  One of the first things you&#39;ll notice once you walk into Gus&#39; is that half of the tables are just outdoor tables covered with plastic sheets for &#34;easy cleanup&#34; though they just wipe them with napkins between patrons...

While waiting we stood around with 15+ people, all gawking at the empty booths and tables trying to figure out if we should just take seats and ask for them to be bussed while we sat. Finally a waitress announced our name and pointed to a pile of dishes on top of a round plastic table.  We shuffled toward the table, wondering if someone was going to bus it while we were approaching.  We sat and waited...  and waited...  and waited... Finally a waitress came to our table and asked if we&#39;d like something to drink, I pointed to the dishes and asked her to clear them, she just said, &#34;Oh yeah, we&#39;ll have someone come get those.&#34;.   The coffee was bland, okay for a cheap diner but it was $4.50 here....  Even with 2 refills that&#39;s not a good deal.  

I had the lumberjack skillet.  It was literally just a mound of mushy potatoes and a half pound of cheese slathered with a half can of Hormel brand corned beef hash with two overcooked eggs slapped on top to cover the cook&#39;s embarrassment (I can only imagine this is the cook&#39;s rationale... I would be embarrassed if I served this to another person...).  

My brother had a hamburger.  It was a from-frozen tough slab of overcooked crud.  It wasn&#39;t any better than what you&#39;d get from Burger King... for about twice the price.  The fries were crinkle-cut frozen bland mush.

A point to cap off this terrible adventure is that in total for three people to eat cheap brunch was over $40 without tip.  I can&#39;t imagine coming back here.

TL;DR: Terrible staff, bad food, way overpriced.",21/02/16,233,1,1,-1,-62,-1.6360999999999999,0.568,1.471,13.959999999999999,No,2079

So, besides the standard &#34;ambiance&#34;, the kicker for me is the skillet.  I love a good skillet.  The key to a good skillet is the balance between the ingredients.  Here, they get it perfect.  I mean - a goodly portion of meat to give it heartiness, not too much potato, and plenty of veggies.  Pancakes or toast on the side...what else could you ask for?

gus-diner-rolling-meadows,Jennifer S.,mYvZwQ3T5JzqwOyURQWA_w,HaD7XQQdpdSrlahkzkAzzA,"I love diners!  One of my favorite Sunday morning spots is a divey diner that oozes with charm. 

We should have gone there. 

Gus&#39; Diner is conveniently located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. My husband joked as we walked up about the folding chairs and tables.  I saw the retro booths and figured that they must be so good that they&#39;ve thrown in some additional seating to accommodate more guests. 

We walked in to an upbeat, clean restaurant loaded with people. Gus himself seats us in one of those red totally retro booths and we are off on our adventure. 

We wait a few minutes and a waitress comes over to collect her tip from the last guests. She informs us that they are switching sections and that our waitress will be over momentarily. She proceeds to count her tip in front of us, tell us that this is her favorite part and walks away. Odd. Later during our visit, I heard her telling another guest that it&#39;s been a great week and now she can afford to make multiple car payments. I was so put off. 

We meet our server a couple minutes later and order a soda and a cup of coffee. The server offers to refill my soda at the end of the meal and never tends to my husband&#39;s coffee. She didn&#39;t fill the cup once even though it sat empty on the edge of the table every time she walked on by. When he was halfway done with breakfast, we got a busboy to fill the coffee cup and bring over some creamer. 

He chose a Denver omelet with hash browns. It also came with pancakes or toast. He chose the pancakes. I went with a French dip, fries and the cream of chicken and rice soup. My soup took forever to come out. The server did apologize for the delay when she delivered it. It had a layer of thick film on part of it. I scooped that off and ate a few bites. It wasn&#39;t piping hot (chilly soup is a pet peeve) and it wasn&#39;t very tasty. That sat at the edge of the table until after we left. 

The omelet arrived and it must have been okay because he ate half, but his hash browns were a little too blackened for my liking. My French dip arrived with a pickle that I requested not to have on my plate (I don&#39;t like pickle juice making the bun soggy). The check did clearly say &#39;NO PICKLE&#39; but no one bothered to read that detail. My fries were lukewarm and not evenly cooked. Some were burnt and some were almost raw. None were seasoned. The sandwich itself came on a nice roll, but the meat was not only very minimal but also gristly and overcooked in some areas. 

Of course, we found that the coffee spoon was dirty with a chunk of something on it toward the end of the meal which promptly brought our meal to a close. 

So for $26 and change with our tip, it was a very disappointing trip. The look of the diner was very cute. I love the paint colors, the wall decor and the booths. The counters with stools looked cute as well. You can tell that some good money went into making this diner a cute spot. But, I think that some re-training with the primary focus on attention to detail is in order here.

We finally asked somebody.   Once we say it took 10 minutes to get a menu. Then they asked me and my boyfriend if we wanted something to drink but didn&#39;t ask his son

We finally placed our order and I can say the pancakes were yummy but the ham and cheese omelet was nothing to write home about. The cinnamon French toast was yummy but too sweet to eat all of it

The reason I gave this only 3 stars was the cost. It was $45 for 2 eggs, French toast, omelet, 1 hot tea, 1 cup of coffee and a chocolate milk

Could have gone to Ellys or teddys or checkers or uncle bills. Had the same quality food but for much less

Their slogan is &#39;Come as Strangers, Leave as Friends.&#39; It&#39;s a bit dangerous having such a cute diner right across from home but somehow I will have to resist going here for breakfast every single morning!

On my latest visit I had the Florence Benedict for $8.95 which is a toasted English muffin topped with Canadian Bacon, Baby Spinach, two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. I absolutely loved this dish - everything went so well together. The eggs were cooked perfectly, sauce delicious, and the spinach was super fresh, cooked to just the right degree. Plus it comes with hashbrowns on the side which were perfect when they had the hollandaise all soaked in! I&#39;ve had pancakes here, as well, and found them to be perfect also! Their skillets sound sooooo good - they&#39;re next on my to do list here.

Gus&#39;s is open from 7 to 2 every day, they do take out and have a pretty huge menu with an array of choices to dine on. Service is better than average diner treatment with the staff all being very attentive and friendly. Gus himself with awesome sleeve tattoos is usually in the cash register (I know this because I matched his pic from a charity photo next to the register to his live &amp; in person face).

Gus&#39;s is decorated with rock &amp; roll memorabilia and bright colors adorning the walls. Tons of tables or you can take a old school seat at the counter to dine. Love it!

Gus is always nice if you happen to  catch him and say hello while paying. The service has mostly been good and fairly prompt as well. Some waitresses are particularly nice and outgoing. We have been here several times, mainly for breakfast, but also for dinner. The prices are pretty good too comparatively. 

But the number one reason we go out for a meal is the food (and the experience as a whole), which brings down the rating. The experience is fine, although the settings are what my father used to call &#39;plain pipe rack&#39; to describe a very plain decor. But that is fine - it is a diner after all. But the food is very plain. In our experience (probably a half dozen visits), there is no attempt at seasoning or flavors. Possibly if you ask for and add your own seasonings. If they change that (or change cooks), we would be happy to try it again. As it is, we have not been there in over a year as we pay a bit more to go to breakfast elsewhere, where they add seasonings and cheeses etc. Clearly my wife and I must have different palates from all the other reviews, but good for them and good for Gus!

Gus&#39;s is a very well lit, shiny 50&#39;s diner motif with very low curb appeal in a strip mall on Plum Grove Road.  We prefer Red Apples baked omelettes over Gus&#39;s tasty layered crepe omelettes but both are good. Both have excellent skillets, pancakes, and adult experienced servers. 

Gus&#39;s also has a very handy bar counter for when you are traveling without your entourage, and longer hours. The counter can be pretty fun, they make you feel like you DO have an entourage there.

Maybe I could eat one of Red Apple&#39;s fantastic baked omelettes AT Gus&#39;s the next dark Winter day?

My boyfriend and I stopped in here several months ago now, though I&#39;m sad that I&#39;ve wait so many years to experience the awesomeness that this place has to offer.

It&#39;s 50&#39;s style decor gives it so much charm, and the staff is simply the best! We are always welcomed with huge smiles and they pretty much treat us like family. 

The prices are very good, and the food is phenomenal.

Gus makes the best soup I have ever had in my life, I am not joking. I am a total soup freak and even if I get breakfast food, my girls know to bring me soup!

I have never had a meal I didn&#39;t like from Gus&#39;s . I have had both breakfast and lunch meals numerous times, I&#39;ve probably tried over a dozen things and have never been disappointed. Everything from french toast, to their burgers (magnificent) to the paninis &amp; the omelets, there is not one dish I wouldn&#39;t rave about to a friend. I have a hard time choosing when I go there, but I know whatever I choose, I am going to be a full and happy girl!

If you are a breakfast lover, go for the pancakes. They are absolutely perfect! Simple, but amazing and super delicious! (Still not better than the soup though!)

I always have a wonderful time when I go here and you feel right at home. They never rush you and are always happy to give you suggestions of great food to try,

Gus is in house almost all the time, and that speaks to the pride he takes in his restaurant &amp; the value he has for his customers. The whole staff is wonderful, and Liz &amp; Debbie are so much fun! I affectionately refer to them as my  &#34; Gus&#39;s mommies&#34; . 

If you are looking for a great local place to have a wonderful meal , surrounded by the sweetest people you&#39;ll ever meet, give Gus&#39; a try.

The eggs had runny whites: fail.

Only 3 thin strips of bacon: fail.

The service was great. Someone came up to us right when we walked into the restaurant and was seated right away. It&#39;s pretty chilly at the restaurant though if they don&#39;t turn on the fireplace. Our server kept checking up on us and also came to refill our drinks.

We ordered Chicken potstickers, shrimp tom-yum soup (small), panang curry chicken, chicken red curry, and pad thai with fat noodles instead.

My boyfriend and I went here for lunch, and while there were people in there, it wasn&#39;t crowded, but you would have thought that by the way the workers were acting. They have two cooks, one server, and one guy who I think might have been the owner. He was the main problem; he was micromanaging every other job.

Honestly, if they had more people working, and a better system, this place would be a five star place. 

Now on to the food....I had the Pad Thai with shrimp, and it was seasoned well, and not spicy. The shrimp was cooked...I believe, there was one piece that seemed a little cold, but looked cooked. Since we both had lunch specials, we got a cup of their house soup, and a plate of crab rangoon . The soup was delicious and light, and the rangoon was crispy, but still light and not greasy.

Thai House must have had a different location because the menus are old and beat up. The layout for a restaurant is pretty bad as 50% of the space is kitchen or an eyesore. 

The food is average at best from what I had. The spring rolls had dry and chewy fried tofu inside and a giant dried out green onion on top. The Tom Yum was ok but had zero heat to it, odd as it&#39;s supposed to be a spicy soup. The Pad Thai had the slightly wider noodles which I like but it was oversauced and sort of gummy, flavor was ok. Also tried the mixed seafood, a sweet but bland sauce. This was also supposed to be spicy and was not. 

Out of 4 items not one stood out as great, average at best (the Pad Thai). Everything seemed cooked properly but that only gets you so far. Portion size is also less than what I get at other places.

I love Thai food as an alternative to Chinese because I believe it is much lighter. Thai House has a nice decor with a beautiful multi-level waterfall just inside the entrance and a fireplace. After an appetizer of spring rolls, I chose the Pa-Nang Curry with Chicken for my entree. I was worried that the curry would be too spicy for me but it was just right and delicious. It was served with white rice. My wife enjoyed her meal as well.

They don&#39;t have a website out since they&#39;re new so I had to call. I wanted to place a to go order since that&#39;s faster for me. I wanted a lunch special tofu pad Thai easy on the tofu but the girl who was taking my order didn&#39;t seem to understand me very well but maybe it&#39;s because we were talking on the phone and not in person. I also asked how much it is and its $7.25 plus tax which includes your portion plus an appetizer. No one asked me which appetizer I would prefer so I guess I was hoping they would still put something in.

Upon arrival, the people working here seem to be very nice and the place looks cozy. But they do have an open floor kitchen which isn&#39;t the best thing for a casual Thai place but that&#39;s just my opinion. I came home and checked out my entree. I know it was a lunch portion but the pad Thai was tiny. Im not expecting too much but this was definitely smaller than I&#39;m used to and it didn&#39;t even fill up the container part. They did include two Thai egg rolls which were very tasty so that was at least nice of them. The pad Thai itself was delicious and I would definitely try them again if I&#39;m in the area but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to visit them again.

Price: very affordable.  People who complain probably only eat Fast Food.  Cheaper than Siri.

Diet:
My boyfriend and I are vegan/vegetarian glutenfree.

Food:
Excellent.
Moving to palatine from being spoiled by the many amazing diverse ethnic restaurants in Skokie/Evanston before, has been hard.  The food here has delicious and original and addicting flavors I&#39;ve never tasted.  I&#39;ve had Thai food all across the country, and this place is an authentic gem-- that is distinguished.

Vegetarian bonus points:
They make their food from scratch not prepackaged like the other places, and don&#39;t lie about fish sauce, like the other Siri Thai places in town.  They&#39;re willing and happy to cater to your needs and requests--not many places do the way they do.  Their food is authentic and flavorful--just how it would taste in Thailand.  

Favorites meals:
Panang, Pad Thai, crispy noodles!  I honestly couldn&#39;t have pad Thai at other places because of their use of eggs, but these guys make it delicious with a flavor I&#39;ve never tasted before.  Crispy noodles are just as good as Thai Garden in Schaumburg.

Extremely thoughtful:
They are the only Thai Restaurant that uses special cookware and serve with separate utensils and dishware for vegetarians.  

About the owner:
They&#39;re a small business owner family, that&#39;s there every single day, with smiles on their faces that greet everyone genuinely.  Ask the owner his story.  And he&#39;s open for suggestions on improving.

Patience: 
Have some, they&#39;re new and figuring things out and becoming more coordinated each time! They&#39;re a little understaffed but awesome.

I thought it was really good! I had the chicken pad thai and they gave me a container of the thai chili sauce so I could make it my own heat level.  I thought the portion was OK for lunch.  But for dinner, it probably could be bigger than it was.  I also ordered the Golden Triangle appetizer.  The filling was tasty from what I could tell, but there was so little of it in the wanton it was hard to really say for sure!  So, food was good, but 4 stars for portions and I felt pretty ripped off by the app, actually.

I had it delivered through Grub Hub (wish they delivered on their own) and was very pleased!! Very fast delivery! My only issue is that I paid and tipped ahead of time and   asked to have the food left on my porch because I have two very loud dogs that are difficult to calm down and he not only rang my doorbell, he also went around back to my sliding glass door and knocked on that door before I even had a chance to answer my front door! Excellent shrimp yellow curry and shumai. Generous portion sizes! The yellow curry was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had, and that is what I ALWAYS order for Thai food so I&#39;ve had it tons of places. I also had the Rama noodle, but probably wouldn&#39;t order it again. It wasn&#39;t bad at all, just a bit rich and creamy for my specific taste and I would like to try their other noodle dishes. If you like a creamy and peanuty (not a word lol) sauce, you&#39;d probably love this. I had it with chicken, and it also has big broccoli florets. I thought the prices were very reasonable and on point with other Thai places. Very happy they are open and love having a local Thai place!! Definitely would recommend to anyone! Excited to try other dishes from them and I will definitely be ordering regularly and hope to dine in soon.

The waitress was very nice and soft spoken. The cooks in the back seemed to be having a blast! Our food came out very fast and was delicious. We had chicken &amp; pastor tacos, Mexican style. The complimentary chips and salsa were good and I would say the salsa was a medium heat. Of course no taco dinner is complete without Jarritos and they had my favorite flavor, Mandarin. If you&#39;re in the area give them a try. I&#39;ll definitely be returning to try the Elotes and churros!

juquilita-tacos-north-aurora,Damon B.,MlwetLdFr6Ax8fQuEfL7tQ,R6m2MPuzRG1jJNE1Jg29cg,"I&#39;m not sure where to start this review. The service? The food? The friendliness of staff? I could sum it all up by just saying &#34;Great!&#34;, but I&#39;ll continue. 
I&#39;ve been here a few times now, and overtime I was greeted warmly and almost like a long time customer. In fact, last time I was there the (owner?) even recognized me after I had posted a couple of pictures from a previous visit. This tells you that he does take the time to look at his reviews and cares what his customers are saying, something not found nearly often enough. 
Let&#39;s move on the the food. It&#39;s all very fresh and made however you want it. I ask for cilantro instead of lettuce? Boom! Not a shred of lettuce and wonderful green cilantro in its place. Some extra jalapeos? Do you want whole, diced, fresh, or pickled? The prices are as perfect as the food and the service. All on point. The pastor stands out, especially when mixed with the chorizo in one of their &#34;special&#34; burritos. 
If I were able to change one thing, it would only be that I would&#39;ve discovered it earlier. I&#39;ll be back the next time I hear a burrito calling my name. Keep up the good work, Juquilitas.",31/08/16,141,4,2,4,25,3.8005999999999998,2.5460000000000003,0.219,20.235000000000003,No,1192
juquilita-tacos-north-aurora,Angela P.,3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg,WEl8jA57Kc0pHVwpf_GvFA,"Everything we ate here was excellent.  I really liked the steak and pork tacos, and the salsas are equally good.  The green sauce had just the right amount of heat.  The horchata was also good.  

Juqilita would be my go-to taco joint if I lived in North Aurora.  Out of the 597126846 taco joints in the Aurora vicinity, Juquilita isn&#39;t my favorite, or the most convenient, but they still make damn good food.  I&#39;m spoiled with great Mexican food living in Aurora - Juquilita&#39;s is better than anything you&#39;ll find in neighboring suburbs like Naperville or Plainfield, but it doesn&#39;t take the #1 or even #2 spot for my favorites in Aurora.

juquilita-tacos-north-aurora,Matthew A.,2iSKborklNwSaeRi9x6UAg,XoOIKajKF6JqIZ3gzttXUQ,"My wife and I went here on a Saturday evening after reading the great reviews. We never actually got our food. The waitress/cashier took 20 minutes to get around to our table. We ordered food and waited another 40 minutes for it to arrive. We finally gave up, paid for our sodas, and left. Not a hint of remorse from the staff. The kitchen seemed to be in complete disarray and there was only one person to wait 15 tables and service the take out customers. Hopefully they were just having a bad night and it&#39;s not like this all the time.

Side note - the place was filthy. If the food was really good, I&#39;d happily overlook that. But seeing as we never got our food, I have to point out that this place would have absolutely flunked a health inspection.",14/09/16,83,1,1,1,-21,0.5024,1.089,0.463,9.448,No,761
juquilita-tacos-north-aurora,Dan S.,f3jDA5fwCv-GB5DnIZDwhA,TVwaWwX4elxXVM4dzNBWYQ,"This place makes hands down the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever eaten. Tonight is my third time here this week, and I don&#39;t do that with almost any restaurant. The owners are super friendly and the ingredients in every dish are among the freshest I have ever tasted. The location may seem discouraging for some (located near the corner of Route 31/Lake Street and Route 56/Butterfield Road/the bridge connecting Aurora and North Aurora), but DO NOT BE DECEIVED. There&#39;s ample parking adjacent on the south side of the bridge (same side of the street as the restaurant) so that&#39;s not an issue. The location is super cozy and has a warm decor, but lacks central air conditioning so summer visits can be a bit on the warm side for some. The servers I&#39;ve had, I believe, are both the owners&#39; children and do a fine job. The young man is particularly funny as well as dutiful in his job.

The table salsa can range from &#34;delightfully spicy&#34; to &#34;oh my gosh my mouth is on fire but this is too tasty to miss;&#34; the horchata is authentic (not a mix like too many taquerias in the area); the guacamole is creamy and cooling with the right amount of lime; the chicken burritos have more chicken in them than most chicken dinners you get at any given restaurant, and the pastor tacos are the most delicious I&#39;ve had in the United States. Do yourself a favor and stop in.

One warning: when ordering takeout at a dinner rush hour you may be waiting upwards of 40 minutes for 6 tacos and 2 tortas, which would be fine if the girl taking the order on the phone didn&#39;t quote a time of 20-25 minutes.

Side note: the owner told me last night bag they offer catering services for weddings/parties/any night you don&#39;t want to make your own meal. Their cook will literally make everything on the spot for everyone fresh, not simply buffet-style.

juquilita-tacos-north-aurora,Nicole R.,Jwrg76eZGjridhYE_E3EqQ,qaMohNfCg7D1gUPBVjkWTw,"This is more like a 3.5 rating. The reason it isn&#39;t a 4 is because it took 20 minutes to make 8 tacos and some guac for a take out order. I&#39;ve waited less time at a sit down Mexican restaurant. There were two people waiting for take out orders in front of me. Both ended up going up to the counter to ask how much longer their wait would be. that&#39;s a fairly embarrassing situation.

I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe a kitchen guy called out on a Friday night and they were down some hands. No one else has mentioned slow service, so maybe it was a fluke. I would have liked to have the option of calling ahead - that would have been much better, but they didn&#39;t have anything online and there were surprisingly no paper take out menus at the counter for next time. So if the owners read this, my recommendation is to go to kinkos and print a bunch of menus so you don&#39;t have the stress of a bunch of people waiting in the small restaurant.

So the food. The guac was really good. My husband loved it slightly more. I love salty guac and this was not that, so I would have preferred a tiny more salt but then again, that&#39;s me so in no way is there a complaint on the guac. We ordered tacos and a torta. The steak torta was messy, but the meat was well seasoned. The reviews on the el pastor tacos were so high, but I weirdly preferred the chicken. The pastor had almost a grisly texture that I didn&#39;t love. All in all, the tacos were good, and even though they look small, they were very filling.

I will go back because I got a glimpse of their burritos and I need that next - with the guac.",21/03/15,168,3,1,1,-11,0.8410000000000002,2.15,1.6960000000000002,17.155,No,1635

juquilita-tacos-north-aurora,Geoffrey E.,JCCv29jdlRsaeGFVHo_-rQ,xF_9YMApkGJ63kmhhPeNbw,"This was my first visit to Juquilita Tacos. I have driven past many times and wanted to stop in (after all, the sign in the window says &#34;The Best Tacos in Town&#34;), but the timing wasn&#39;t right.

I was initially unsure about where to park. I believe it is alright to park at the food and liquor store on the corner, but space is limited there, so it&#39;s probably best to go to the lot east of the restaurant.

Vanessa mentioned Tandoori chicken, but I didn&#39;t see that on the menu. It must have been a remnant from the previous management, and has since been eliminated. That really has no place in a Mexican restaurant anyway.

One thing I really like about the place is that it&#39;s quite authentic. It doesn&#39;t have the &#34;touristy&#34; feel of many Americanized Mexican restaurants, but is a bit rough around the edges, you know, the sort where the locals would eat (that&#39;s a plus in my book). It&#39;s a tiny restaurant (my living room is larger than the dining area), and I agree with Tina&#39;s review that there is a fair amount of spillover of supplies that would typically be stored in back, but I suspect that&#39;s due to the small size of the building. It didn&#39;t bother me though, it just gave it a kind of &#34;welcome to my kitchen&#34; feel (as did the clovers decorating the walls for Saint Patrick&#39;s Day), all of which is appropriate for what I believe is a mom-and-pop operation.

I opted for takeout, which was a decision I had made earlier, and ordered the chile rellenos dinner (includes rice, refried beans, and corn tortillas) and a chorizo burrito. It did take about 15 minutes or so before the food was ready, which isn&#39;t too long considering it was made from scratch, as opposed to sitting around all day or frozen, and then nuked when ordered. I could hear the chef whipping up the batter for the chile rellenos and the sizzle as they were fried. It all smelled so good, and I was sooo ready to eat when the food came out of the kitchen, I wished I had chosen to dine in! If you want fast, go to Taco Bell. If you want authentic, come here.

Another reason I wish I had dined in is that by the time I got home, the food had cooled somewhat, but it was still delicious and the portions were large. I will definitely be returning, and will dine in next time.",26/02/12,257,4,2,4,40,3.7475999999999994,1.758,0.6579999999999999,16.584,No,2320

- hot dog prices VERY fair (Tuesday&#39;s .99 all day. M-F .99 between 2-4 pm), especially compared to Portillo&#39;s ($2.85 before tax) and Scooby&#39;s ($2.99 before tax. If you want peppers that&#39;s .60 extra before tax).  Note:  Hotdogs are almost identical to Scooby&#39;s.

- Fries are good and you get a TON.  However, they can be a little salty.  Note to restaurant:  Just add a pinch or two less of salt.

- Italian beefs - potential is there, but like many have said - served on the wrong bun. I even professionally asked the owner this on his fb page, and he replied in a friendly way stating that they chose to use &#34;rolls&#34; instead of Turano bread for their own reasons, most being a freshness factor.

I must say, it was no Portillos (I don&#39;t know what kind of crack Portillos puts in their food to make it the greatest food EVER but no one can beat it.  NO ONE) but it was a close second.  

We got some hotdogs and a cheesy garlic beef with some fries.  The hotdogs were pretty darn close to a Portillos perfect Chicago Red Hot.  I could go here for hotdogs any day and not actually miss Portillos at all.  The large fries we got were crispy crinkled and delicious and were honestly big enough for 2-3 people to share. (P.S. No one needs that amount of fries.  That said, I ate half the bag myself...for shame.)  The beef was great too with its crispy garlicky spicy yumminess at the top and gooey au jusy goodness at the bottom BUT I definitely prefer the dipped gooey bread and fall apart beef (doused in hot giardiniera) that Portillos offers.  I guess it&#39;s a matter of preference really.  If you want your beef to be more like the old Garibaldi&#39;s with its crispier baked bread and its tougher but more flavorful beef, come here.  If you want your sandwich to be a drippy gooey fall apart mess that melts in your mouth, go to Portillos.  Honestly, I wish that I could have the best of both worlds and have Portillos make my beef on their garlic bread and call it a day because I do like the garlicky touch that the Dogfather puts on their beef.

I walked inside and noticed every table was taken (probably a good sign), so I placed my everything Chicago Style Hot Dog and small fries to go.

So I get my drink, and less than five minutes later, the girl calls my name, puts the bag next to the drink machine, and that was it. No &#34;Thank you, have a nice day&#34; or anything along those lines. Nada, zip, zilch.  As a first time visitor, I was put off by her attitude. Maybe I caught her on a bad day, but regardless I felt like a burden and not a valued customer. I grabbed my order and made my way out to the car, not looking back.

The fries were crinkle cut, piping hot, and perfectly salted.  The hot dog came on a poppy seed bun, a good sized pickle spear, two thinly sliced tomato wedges, onions, mustard, celery salt, relish, and sport pepper. All ingredients accounted for. I was disappointed that there was only one sport pepper and the celery salt was applied to the pickle and not the hot dog itself (I usually take the pickle and eat it separately from the dog). The hot dog was good, but nothing spectacular. 

Their menu consists of the typical items you&#39;d find at other hot dog joins; burgers, Italian beefs, Gyros, Maxwell Street Polish, pizza puffs, mozzarella sticks, etc.  The prices for their items are fair, if not cheaper than you&#39;d expect. They do have a menu for kids called &#34;Little Pup meals&#34; which includes the item of choice with a drink and tater tots. 

The restaurant was clean, despite all the people dining in. The only exception would be the extremely sticky floor by the pop machine, although that&#39;s a given at nearly every establishment. It was also rather warm inside, so I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t stick around to eat.

Overall, the food is okay and the prices are reasonable, so it&#39;s worth stopping at if you&#39;re in the area, but don&#39;t make it your destination, as other reviewers have said.",14/06/14,366,3,1,3,-4,2.496,2.772,1.623,26.605999999999995,No,2838

The staff was furiously trying to clean tables and counters; I&#39;m guessing  large group had just left. Coming straight from the driving range, I headed into the bathroom and it was moderately clean. The floors were a little wet, there were some towels on the floor. I guess one of them should have checked the bathroom too. 

I stood alone at the counter for a good two minutes before someone stopped cleaning and helped me out. I guess I admire their dedication. Anyway, I ordered two dogs and a drink. I went with lemonade as I never drink Pepsi products. The dogs was of good quality, as it was steamed well and the roll was warm. There was a good ratio of toppings as none of them overpowered any of the others, which sometimes happens. Two complaints: the dogs are steamed and I prefer grilled.

the-dogfather-bartlett,JP P.,on3R_FINJG3AAW7MN9dZfA,gmWIwDDIej2vjVQjWPFmpg,"This place is Money! Albeit not for the reason you may think! 

Ownership was on their game choosing a location, the only hot dog joint around. Also a brilliant marketing tactic selling .99 cent dogs on Tuesdays and between 2 and 4 weekdays. Sell average food by &#34;Volume&#34; and they will come!

I am a living testimonial, a repeat customer for over 5 years. If I happen to be in the area, it crosses my mind. This is strictly a convenience stop and definitely not a destination. I do not wake up in the morning, jump out of bed, scratch, open the curtains to view a perfectly cloudy morning and proclaim &#34;This is a Dogfather kinda day&#34; Nope.

Now for the details. Granted this is a &#34;Nit-Pic&#39;, but one of substance. The Dogfather considers itself an upper echelon Dog Joint. Such a place would be consistent with prep and detail of food and not focus on the Black and White pictures on the wall and the paint color behind them.

Serious Hot Dog Joints know this, thus the focus on detail: Upon ordering a Chicago Style Hot Dog, I may ask &#34;What brand of dog do you serve&#34;? I&#39;ve received answers that run the gamut. The best is the &#34;deer in headlights&#34; cashier interaction &#34;don&#39;t know&#34;.

I have been eating Chicago Style Dogs enough to know that hot dog reviews on Yelp are over the top, or just plain boring. This is my best rendition:

&#34;The poppy seed bun is steamed properly however the Vienna Beef or Red Hot Chicago Dog was placed a tad off center in retrospect! Ouch! Quite possibly a result of yellow mustard drenching the northern portion of the bun exclusively.  The vegetable garden presentation raised an eye brow. The sweet onions where chopped small allowing the scant relish population to remain competitive. Such a battle. The two tomato slices were thin and a bit withered. I actually felt some compassion. The thick pickle spear complemented the single over sized sport pepper, an unwanted comparison&#34;. Yes, a compelling read.

Lets talk about the Beef Sandwich. Good thing, they offer the option of serving on garlic bread. Bad thing, served on a thick bun tasting like dough. Your first bite of a classic Chicago Beef  should taste &#34;Pure Beef&#34;, not bread!

the-dogfather-bartlett,Yu H.,2Yuw8vPm0WEBh1IoWtSvAw,cFa_nzgsPNEIYRshjCsgPw,"Awesome. 

Simple, affordable, clean, fast, tasty , and to the point. This is a no frills fast food place with a funny owner and fast as hell service. 

I drove by this place noticing something peculiar: The quiznos and chinese restaurants next to it we really empty and this place had a line and a crowd packed inside. This was obviously a good sign so I stopped in for a bite. 

Standard portillos style fast food joint: Beef, hot dogs, fries...etc. 

Prices were great and the place was clean. 

I got the: 

Garlic Cheesy Beef sandwich 6 inch (6 bucks): COMPLETELY worth the price. This thing weighs in at like 2 pounds!  Its basically an Italian beef sandwich (dripping wet with au jus), with cheese. I got sweet and hot peppers (WHICH WERE FREE BTW!) and it came 4 minutes later. The cheese was totally melted with chunks of sweet peppers in it. Hot peppers were on the side which I like. Though I couldn&#39;t taste any garlic this sandwich kicked ass nonetheless. 

Fries: Skinny crinkle cut fries. If you like portillo&#39;s fries these are basically those but skinnier and thinner. Really crunchy though. 

Drink: Fountain drinks..nuff said. 

Overall I&#39;m definitely going to be a regular here. They have daily specials which are unbeatable like 99 cent hot dogs on Tuesdays!

If you want a fast, high quality, affordable bite this is your place!",13/11/12,184,4,1,4,-2,3.9052000000000002,4.337000000000001,1.177,16.485,No,1360

The positive - 
1.  the owner is awesome and friendly, always remembers my boys and I when we come in;
2.  My boys like the gyros and they have lots of meat on them;
3.  Prices don&#39;t suck, too bad.

The negative - 
1.  The entire place needs to be scrubbed with a Mr. clean wall eraser.  The tables are sticky and dingy, there are visible dark marks from hands on the white restroom doors... So what does the kitchen look like?
2.  The cheese sticks, what the heck?  No sir, we don&#39;t like &#39;em!

My son can&#39;t get enough of the mozzarella sticks.  They aren&#39;t &#34;normal&#34; sticks.  They are sooooo much better.  It&#39;s a flour tortilla rolled up with cheese inside and deep fried.  He doesn&#39;t even bother with the marinara sauce.  (Don&#39;t worry, it doesn&#39;t go to waste around here.)

The gyros are at the top of my hubby&#39;s Must Have List.  He rarely finishes the sandwich because it is so large.  He also likes to nibble on the french fries.  Nothing extraordinary - BUT, they are fried correctly.  They aren&#39;t overly greasy or overly salted.  They are crisp and just right.

Finally, my favs...  The Italian sausage and beef combo sandwich is delicious.  The sausage is seasoned really well.  I thought it was possible that they make their own sausage, but my husband insists that I am wrong.  Honestly, I can&#39;t bring myself to ask.  It&#39;s good.  That&#39;s all that I know for sure.  The onion rings are beer battered, not breaded with that crumbly, crunchy stuff.  Those are mighty fine, too.  Finally, I am a fan of their burger.  I like it cooked a bit on the well side with crispy bacon.  It&#39;s a good size and I usually don&#39;t finish it.

We visited at approximately 1:00 PM.  There was a bored-looking girl at the counter who barely acknowledged our presence when we arrived at the counter to place our order.  We gave her our order, which she wrote on a paper bag. She rung up our order and when we paid via debit card, she did not provide a receipt, say thank you or anything else.  She just picked her pen up again and looked at the person behind us.  

We decided to eat in the restaurant, which was a mistake.  All of the tables were dirty and there was a general mess on the floor in front of the beverage machine.  It did not appear that it was in anyone&#39;s job description to keep the dining area clean.  I was afraid that I was going to slip in the spilled soda in front of the beverage machine.  

The straw that broke the camel&#39;s back was the women&#39;s restroom.  The soap dispenser was broken. To me, this was a red flag as far as the cleanliness of the restaurant as I began to worry that the staff may not be washing their hands.

The final issue was that the bored-looking girl at the counter was also texting on her phone as we left.

I&#39;ve had a cheesy garlic beef sandwich, their fries, and their gyros here. It is very easy to go wrong with any of those things. The fries could be greasy and floppy. The beef sandwich could be flavorless, or sopping wet. The gyros could be dry and forgettable.

But none of those things apply here. The fries are always hot and crisp. The cheesy garlic beef was flavorful and meaty. And the gyros the last time around were moist. Plus, they always get my order right.

At some point I&#39;m gonna try their dogs, since it&#39;s in their name. But I&#39;m more than willing to rate them highly based on what I&#39;ve already had.

The hot dog I received came on a nice soft poppy seed bun, it had a noticable amount of celery salt, well applied relish and mustard, sport peppers, and two little tomato slices. The pickle was sliced thinly though was still a bit more sour than I like.

The dog itself had a nice flavor to it, it was well cooked with all the flavor intact. This was a textbook example of how to make a Chicago style hot dog well.  Everything had a great flavor and I have no real complaints about the hot dog, only noticing slightly less than usual onions, a little more celery salt than most places, and a long and thinly cut pickle.

I also tried the tater tots, the tots I received were nice and crisp with a good flavor. I didn&#39;t grab a menu but my total for two hot dogs, tots and a drink was around $6.50.

It was a pretty solid meal.  I would say it&#39;s comparable to Nana&#39;s and Portillo&#39;s.  We ordered our food to go.  I got a chili dog and onion rings and a side salad, and my husband got a chicago dog and fries.  Our total came to $13.

My husband said his Chicago dog was good (just like Portillos) and the fries were just ok.  He wasn&#39;t expecting crinkle-cut fries, I think.  

My chili dog was solid--I liked the chili they used on it--flavorful without being psicy, just how I like it.  The actual hot dog seemed very small, though.  It did have a good snap when you bit into it, though.  The dressing used for the side salad was really good, and the salad was decent sized as well.  Now for the onion rings.  They had a good flavor, but they didn&#39;t have that crunch I usually like in my rings.  Also, when I bit into the first one, hot oil came out and absolutely scalded my tongue.  I&#39;m not even exaggerating--it&#39;s RAW today.  It hurt SO badly last night, too.  So boo for that!

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try their chicken gyros, though!  There were also some other things on the menu I would be interested in!  It was really hopping in there, too--lots of little leaguers who must have just gotten done with their games.

The Barrington Secret &#34;Best Donut in Illinoiz&#34; is out.

I had them in Salzburg once and could never pronounce the name correctly but the sisters here can, and many of the customers can too. Kurtoskalacs?  Very cute layout and about as far away from an internet cafe as you can imagine, very refreshing. Good coffee and really good hot chocolate. Not big, cute, bring $$.

The chimney donuts are best eaten steaming THERE and with one of the spreads like nutella or peanut butter, and take your time. Refreshingly not sugar bombs, you can add sprinkles, nuts etc on your donuts. Two people can easily share one, and if you don&#39;t have a sweet tooth like me, 3-4. $7. Speaking of time, either order ahead or be willing to wait 45 minutes to an hour for your chimney donut, these are made to order. Worth it, plan ahead. 

I&#39;m only writing this because they&#39;ve been outed, otherwise I wasn&#39;t sharing this one. Not that much to love in Barrington food but this is one. 3-4 over priced average bars within walking distance for you beer peoples.
Don&#39;t tell anyone else please.

I used to be a fan of chimney cakes which i used to eat in Devon area. Unfortunately they closed down

Until few weeks back , i just found this other place that made chimney cakes. I took my wife along to make her try something i used to love and haven&#39;t had for about 4 years.

Extremely clean and unique decor with very pleasant owners.

Chimney Cake w/ Nutella Filling rolled in peanuts/hazelnuts - Heavenly. This old Hungarian dessert was like Diwali in my mouth. It&#39;s dough wrapped around a stick and baked. Sounds simple, but it&#39;s like a super saiyan churro. When it&#39;s baked and ready, the pastry chef spreads your choice of topping on the inside (e.g. chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, peanut butter). I highly recommend the Nutella filled. Just the right amount of sweet. 

Will try with ice cream the next time we go there.

The decor is honestly so adorable that you feel right at home. It&#39;s eclectic, boutiquey, homey, cozy, and welcoming.

Now onto the food - my husband and I inhaled it so fast that I didn&#39;t even have time to take a picture of the pavlova or the red barszcz (borscht) soup. The soup was perfect - not too salty, great amount of shredded beats, with a spectacular flavor profile. The pavlova was with a lemon custard which when I ate immediately made me reminisce of all the summers I spent in Poland. It was so delicious and fluffy, like eating a scrumptious cloud.  Their donuts taste awesome, they remind me of a yeast dough pastry from Poland - dro_d__wka. It came out hot with cinnamon sugar and was so wonderful!

 I&#39;m so excited about this place, it brings back that hometown feeling with everything homemade with imported and fresh ingredients. 
Their espresso, cappuccinos, &amp; all their coffee drinks are made the REAL WAY,  not a push button. Using quality beans freshly roasted. 
I haven&#39;t had lunch there yet, but I plan on it! They have the most delicious looking homemade soups and sandwiches. 
One of the most refreshing thing about this cafe is the girls who own it. They are sweet and friendly, which makes for a most enjoyable experience. Besides the place is as cute as can be!!!

Dcor: I don&#39;t remember too much about the look and feel of the place... we were pretty deep into the bar crawl... but I do remember us sitting in the back corner (there were booths and tables) and there being an outdoor area as well. From what I remember, it was a pretty standard bar I&#39;d say.
Bathroom: there is one, but I don&#39;t remember...

Staff: Our waitress was a bit surprised by the size of our group, but ultimately she handled us all like a pro. Good service!

Drinks/Food: I kept it pretty pedestrian by ordering a Coors Light as a beverage but then went all in and got 18 Chicken Wings, buffalo garlic flavor. Maybe b/c I was starving, and maybe because I was a bit drunk, but WOW were these wings good! Not only did they come out HOT and fresh, but they were quite meaty and the sauce... damn the sauce was good! It was a fantastic buffalo flavor with actual bits of garlic... heaven! As for the portion, I nearly couldn&#39;t finish all 18... I did, but it was a bit of a struggle.

Value: The prices... I don&#39;t remember. But I left full and I don&#39;t remember being shocked when I signed my tab.

This was a good place that I know I&#39;ll come back to solely for the wings. Actually, this may happen much sooner than later!",26/08/16,161,5,2,5,39,5.4249,3.3200000000000003,0.504,10.175,No,1411

There are 2 entrances. One off route 64 and one in the back. There&#39;s tons of public parking in the back, so that&#39;s the way we came in. It has more of a restaurant feel in the back, and more of a bar feel in the front. We were able to get a table right away and the waitress came over within minutes.

I ordered a long island because it was a Monday and it was only $3.50! They have some great drink specials (see picture below). We ordered the cheese curds as an appetizer and they don&#39;t skimp on the amount. They were good, but nothing amazing. But, we enjoyed them nonetheless.

I ordered the pork belly tacos and they were amazing. To be honest, I wasn&#39;t expecting super, but I was proven wrong. I basically inhaled my food. The tacos were rich and delicious. Whoever is making them, knows what they are doing. It came with a side of corn which was refreshing.

For what it is, this place ranks pretty high in my books. I would go back, just for the pork belly tacos.

My only complaints: #1 It was dark and I wish there were some more windows or that they would uncover the front windows with all the posters. #2 the place where we were sitting, I think was not level. I tried a couple different chairs and everything was still uneven. #3 When I asked for a beer menu, she said &#34;it changes all the time. we don&#39;t have a menu&#34;.

They have had both Revolution&#39;s Anti-Hero and Goose Island&#39;s Green Line on tap each time I&#39;ve been there. Any place that does that deserves some props.

Now for my real review. The restaurant/pub was extremely busy the time we visited. There were definitely not enough servers, but those who were working were doing a great job with how busy it was. It took quite awhile to get our order taken, but from there the process was speedy. Refills came of our sodas without asking, and the food we ordered was good. I couldn&#39;t decide what I wanted so I ordered an appetizer sampler- I love that they do their sampler so you can choose which appetizers you want from a list. I tried the onion rings (absolutely excellent), portobello fries, and chicken fingers. I enjoyed them all. We did feel like the menu was kind of unusual- lots of things that did not really seem to connect to one another- but people seemed to be enjoying their food at all of the other tables.

Came here to watch a Bulls game one night when ESPN Radio was there so it was pretty packed since free stuff was given out. 2 dollar beers on this particular night was not too shabby. The food from what I remember was alright. My group ordered a bunch of different appetizers to share. The nachos were pretty good. The tater tots and cheese curds were alright, nothing special. And don&#39;t get the onion rings, they barely give you any. 

Our waitress was a little slow but that was only because of the amount of people. Was pretty hard to get to the bar too in the same sense but she pulled through for us. I&#39;d suggest sitting in the back room as there is more space rather than the front. I feel like there is better lighting in the back too. Or if you are feeling adventurous you can be in the patio.

It&#39;s the quintessential watering whole. Whenever I show up on a weekend, 20-somethings are literally sitting/standing/jumping around three-deep in front of the bar, just watching the bartender scramble. Maybe it&#39;s better than the Cubbies on TV? I digress...

The long and short of it is that this place has the typical necessary evils on tap: Bud, Miller etc... They also have drink specials which is always a plus in my book because I&#39;m cheap. When I drink, that is. 

ALSO: just saw some dbag who is b****ing about some of the staff getting in trouble. I hear that some of the staff (and I won&#39;t mention who, because it&#39;s been taken care of) were doing much worse things than taking the occasional shot whist on the job. If you have any idea how much trouble the restaurant could have gotten in, you wouldn&#39;t be saying such stupid things on the internet. The staff is professional and friendly, but sometimes even the best of us make mistakes. IF STC WERE A COLLEGE TOWN, that place would have been knee-deep in sh*t. Just sayin&#39;.

Their beer selection offers just a tad bit more than other restaurants in the area: they carry Rogue, Fat Tire, Goose and Pacifico in addition to the usual beer line-up.

Their food is astoundingly forgettable. I ordered their Angus Beer Burger. I was pretty hungry when we were seated but I had to force myself to finish the burger because it just didn&#39;t register with my taste buds. If Angus had ground packing peanuts, colored it deep brown and called it a burger, I wouldn&#39;t have known the difference.

Whomever prepared my party&#39;s meals was very Scrooge-like with the fries. It&#39;s as if the cook were preparing for nuclear winter and was under the delusion that fries would be their one and only salvation. Truly, only six or seven pieces got onto my plate which comes off as cheap and stingy.

The Beehive wait staff seemed to be floating around all night but they certainly weren&#39;t paying attention to our table. Neglectful service during busy hours is understandable but the place was nowhere near packed (which I now realize was a warning sign).

The Beehive strikes me as that bar that your friends happen onto  between two fun places. It&#39;s the place where you stick around for a beer and leave. With its name, you hope to be enticed, even prodded, to believe this is your destination but there&#39;s really nothing to keep you inside.",24/12/09,155,2,1,2,2,1.7683,1.7720000000000002,0.757,12.471,No,1494

Intentionally ignore you to improve their self esteem. Wait 45 minutes for a drink watching the alcoholic bartender get drunk instead of making drinks. 

The bar is full of loser townies. After spending a good part of the night there laying down some cash with my friends enjoying nice conversation (despite crowd&#39;s rowdiness), the lights came on at 1 and the drunk bartender interrupted our waitress (who was doing last call) to kick us out. He told her to leave our table and told my party to leave after we paid. I told him to settle down and that he had too much to drink and at that point he grabbed my Leica - a $3k camera - off the table and started running out the back door! I had to tackle him to get my camera back at which point other staff apologized, took him away and let us finish our drinks. Ridiculous- guy should have been fired several times that night. Who steals a customers camera? He was so drunk- isn&#39;t that illegal? 

The one star is for the apology, the fact that the bar was busy, and that they carry goose island on tap (albeit priced higher than downtown Chicago bars that are way better).",23/04/11,138,1,1,-1,-58,-1.0829000000000002,1.026,3.186,8.786999999999999,No,1208

I park in one of the public lots and walk around to several places, so I don&#39;t know what it would be like to park with just Beehive in mind.

The bar itself is nice.  It is cozy and there is lots of wood everywhere.  The space is broken up into several rooms:  bar, pool table, dining area.

I have visited a few times and I only sit at the bar.

The beer selection is poor to fair.  They do have one or two taps dedicated to something other than BMC beers, but even those choices are very &#34;safe&#34; for the general beer swilling crowd.
Sometimes when I am in a place that is not heavy into craft brews, I will go with Scotch, but they don&#39;t have a lot of good options in that area either.

One thing that really ruins the bar experience is the insane TV volume.  TV is so loud I cannot hear myself think and it wasn&#39;t even a &#34;big game&#34; or anything inane like that.

Not only are their food and drinks great, but the management and staff are equally wonderful. I recently contacted them to see if they would be willing to help out for a pub crawl fundraiser that I was organizing for the American Cancer Society. One of the managers said that he would be glad to donate a couple $20 gift cards to raffle off to participants and that I could pick them up when the group comes through the day of the event. The fundraiser was this past Saturday, and, as promised, the gift cards were there waiting for us, and I was able to raise money for the American Cancer Society through the raffle. I really appreciated this business&#39;s willingness to support an important cause and thought that yelpers should be aware that when they visit this place, they are not only getting great food, great drink specials, and friendly service, but they are also supporting a business run by good people.

We have not been in the bar, but sit in the restaurant area.  There are interesting photos from the past (in poster size) that show St Charles of old.  Nice atmosphere.

We got  comfy in the bar at a tall table before we realized there was a game room and a probably quieter larger dining room with booths and tables. We liked the bar just fine and enjoyed watching the main street traffic and Courtney our very competent server hustle.

We second the other reviews here particularly for very thinly buttermilk-battered fresh onion rings and tasty fish tacos, it is on a special menu so you may have to ask. The Reuben was also good, and we fought over the corn side that tasted fresh cut while a pretty average rice pilaf got cold. Big enough menu we had a 3rd and 4th choice, pulled pork or one of the big salads.

Very busy place in the bar and Courtney was serving a 3/4 full bar and 3-4 tables so you had to wait a little while for a refill once in awhile but good job. Like Pub 222, I would give it 4 stars for bar food alone. I prefer the outdoor garden that Pub 222 has but it was raining  so perfect. Sports bar motif plus Military Memorials, very timely for Memorial Day, and the much rarer Beehive references that seem to work.  Flat screen TV&#39;s everywhere-you don&#39;t have to miss a shot here. Lotsa wood on the walls and has a rich appearance, largely rock and alternative music that was crisp and too loud-and it was still early.

Pros- Flat screen sportz paradise, bar, game room and large dining room, competent interested servers, small but diverse menu, many draft beers.

Cons- No outdoor eating area, really LOUD it is still a sports bar, a little heavy on the fried.

We wanted some wings and pizza for the first NFL Sunday of the year.  I ordered a large thin crust pizza with pepperoni, sausage, garlic, and extra cheese, and an order of wings with garlic Parmesan sauce. 

Their online order process was super easy to use! Delivery came exactly when expected. 

The pizza sauce and toppings were excellent, but the crust was soggy and chewy.  Not great. 

The wings tasted ok but there was barely any meat on them.

Placed my order. Wait time was only twenty minutes. Got there right on time and the pizza was also ready right on time. Fresh out of the oven.

Perhaps I have to order that in addition next time. Everything else was pretty delicious! The crust tasted a bit on the cheaper side, still yummy regardless.

The garlic knots are fluffy, buttery, salty goodness. I like that they&#39;re made with real garlic and not just a bunch of ground seasonings. They make them with cinnamon and sugar too, and I can&#39;t imagine how delish those probably are- they&#39;re on my list to try next!

The vodka via is a very unique and delicious pizza. It&#39;s got a lot of different flavors going on, so much so that I don&#39;t miss the regular pizza sauce. The vodka sauce has great flavor, and the veggies on top only add more. Same thing with the buffalo pizza...so much flavor that you don&#39;t think twice about it not having regular sauce. The chicken on the buffalo pizza wasn&#39;t rubbery and fake like other places. I enjoy the fact that this place has the typical pepperoni or cheese pizzas, but you can also get something that you&#39;ve probably never tried before- and it will be awesome!

the-cellar-bistro-wheaton,Ruth F.,SrZueHJAEuDbYFBkYZu2Pg,MmK0MKH6SAbfFaq_vLpkgQ,"Normally I don&#39;t review a place with this many reviews, but since the only vegetarian mention is from someone who eats fish, yes, the Cellar Bistro has several vegetarian (not fish!) options for each course, including appetizers, entre salads, entrees, and pizzas.  I suspect they have vegan options, as the beet burger comes with Vegenaise and is obviously not bound with eggs.

We were here for lunch and ate outside.  The interior looks nice but was extremely over air conditioned.  Prices are what I&#39;d usually expect for dinner entrees; we were also handed a beer and wine menu (I suspect the wine menu is the same as for dinner; multiple bottles in the up-to-$50 range and one $100 champagne).  7 of the 8 appetizers are vegetarian; 4 of the 8 pizzas are as well; 2 of the salads; 5 of the &#34;favorites&#34; and 3 sandwiches; both named soups appeared veg (didn&#39;t ask).

Appetizers and salads are fairly standard without a lot of culinary adventuring, at least for the veg options (hummus; spinach/artichoke dip; bruschetta; pear/walnut salad; beet and goat cheese).

We had the baked brie appetizer; the brie was fairly bland; we liked the quince paste and sugared pecans.  The walnut bread with it was walnut, raisin, and citron - nice, but the citron fought a bit with the quince paste and meant every bite was fruity.  I suppose the brie needed the help.  I had the warm farro salad with kale and chevre, which came with little slices of bread.  There was a lot of chevre, and the salad worked fairly well as a topping for the bread.  The beet burger took an extremely long time to prepare (a warning in the menu would be nice); lunch took us an hour and a half and we really rushed through our main courses due to a 2pm appointment.  The beet burger pleased my companion, who doesn&#39;t usually like beets.  It wasn&#39;t a patty, more like a chopped beet salad (if it was &#34;rolled in walnuts&#34; we missed it).  I thought it was nice enough.  The roasted rosemary potatoes with it were perfection.

I don&#39;t usually pay this much for lunch, and while the food was well-executed, it didn&#39;t truly shine.  I&#39;d come here again when I felt like a splurge staying local with lots of vegetarian options; otherwise I can either really splurge on fancy dining in the City, or eat new American for significantly less nearby, albeit with fewer choices.",27/06/15,293,3,3,3,53,2.4635,2.369,0.841,16.790000000000003,No,2384
the-cellar-bistro-wheaton,Erin M.,yF1E8hueVN1AsH7h9Pn7vA,za0-P-iVkQ9ipvpumydyzA,"I think this place is a solid 3.5 stars for me currently. Had a good Mother&#39;s day early dinner. We made a reservation but the dining area was fairly full but had empty tables. We were greeted by a server that said our real server would be with us shortly. After awhile another server, a young lady, came and said that she would take our drink order and app order as our server still wasn&#39;t at the restaurant. We hadn&#39;t chosen apps yet, but she brought us drinks. After a few more minutes the young lady came back and jus took care of us the whole time. It appeared the waitress was late for her shift, but other servers did as they should and took care of us.

The bruschetta was very tasty, but the mozzarella on top was very mild and would have been even better with a stronger cheese.

My husband and I split the bistro salad (very good, dressing was perfect, corn salsa added just the right about of sweetness, but could have used more onions-but I like a ton of onions), and the 4 cheese pizza (very cheese, good flavor, perfect crust). My mom enjoyed her wedge salad with seafood salad on top (can&#39;t remember the meals name-was extremely well plated and we should have taken a picture). My dad got the bistro burgers and said that they were very tasty, but thinks there should have been 3 sliders instead of 2. 

I can not comment on the alcohol selections as we did not drink (Tea totaler parents). I skimmed the wine list and didn&#39;t see my go to Riesling but I am always up for trying something new. My husband looked at the beer menu but did not make any comments on it. I&#39;ll update this review as I am sure we will be returning and then I will try something off the drink menu.

Overall, this was a good pick and hope we can have another enjoyable experience here. Some items on their lunch menu also looked good. Also pretty good pricing (98 after tip), for four meals and an app (with 2 sodas).",08/05/16,226,4,3,5,81,6.5987,3.055,0.145,14.8,No,1930

Our waiter was a little rough around the edges and took awhile after delivering our cocktails to get our order for appetizers. We ordered the brie and toast points, a dish that has been around, I think, since the restaurant opened. The brie was underheated and hard to spread and the toast seemed a bit stale. For the entree, I ordered the filet mignon, and was pleased that it was only 4 oz., a nice portion. However, it arrived lukewarm on a cool plate. The bacon-wrapped potato and spinach cake seemed like a creative touch but was relatively tasteless (how can bacon be tasteless?). For dessert, I ordered the lemon sorbet, listed first on the menu,  and the waiter came back empty-handed saying they were out (we were eating early on a Saturday evening). It has been some time since we were last here and I was hoping Cellar Bistro had grown as a restaurant.

I had bookmarked a couple of restaurants in Wheaton and after we parked the car we set off to explore them.  This was the first one we encountered and I just really liked the look of it.  Most people were eating outside the day we went there so we had glorious privacy indoors.  I ordered a raspberry Italian soda and the mushroom/brie soup and both were fantastic!  I thought, wow, this is enough goodness to merit the trip here.

Then we both had hamburgers, my husband had two of the garlic burgers and I had one of the wimpy ones and it was just perfect.  Great meat, delicious bun and crispy lettuce, tomato and onion on top with a homemade mayo/mustard spread.  I adored it.  I had wanted to explore more and maybe get dessert at another spot but I was on a roll.  Could this be the Holy Grail of lunch where I like every single course?

Monty Python has nothing on me so I plunged on ordering a Cappuccino and splitting a cake with my husband.  Not just any cake, no sireee.  This was Kathleen&#39;s Chocolate Cake, I am not lying, it was named after me!  And moist, chocolately perfection that was masterful with my cappuccino.

I went here to catch up with two close girlfriends who I haven&#39;t seen in a while. We decided to try a new place and chose Cellar Bistro due mainly to our love of wine. While the wine was good, as well as our dinner, the service was extremely disappointing. 

Our server was very nice and gave great recommendations when asked for her advice on wine and entrees. However, once our meal was complete and we were given the bill, we had someone come up to our table multiple times within minutes of setting down the bill to see if we had taken care of it. Once we paid, a couple minutes later a gentleman, who I can only assume was the manager, asked if we were finished and would move so some people at the bar could have our table. We were enjoying our conversation and thought he was joking. What restaurant asks if you are finished so they can seat other people? 

At first we just kind of laughed it off but when the manger returned yet again and said &#34;I have three nice seats at the bar for you&#34; we were so annoyed that we got up and left. 

It&#39;s unfortunate as the food and wine were good, but I have NEVER had a manager or anyone else at a restaurant ask if we could leave our table so others could use it.

 We shared the bruchetta appetizer. It wasn&#39;t very good. It had a really strong vinegar flavor and hardly any cheese. I had the beet salad, which was fresh and delicious. I then ordered the tuna wrap. It was good, and the price was right. I think it was $10, which was one of the cheapest thing on the menu. The tuna was cooked perfectly and the wrap was tasty. However, I was not a fan of the potato salad side that came with the wrap.

Our waiter took 20 minutes to come to our table. He stopped by after 10 minutes to say he would be there, but it took him another 10 minutes to then finally come bring us drinks - let alone water. He was clearly overwhelmed, having been given too many tables, so I think it&#39;s the fault of the restaurant owner/manager. 

One enjoyable item was the bacon wrapped dates. However, I&#39;ve had them just as well prepared elsewhere, if not better, and $14 for six of them was too much to pay. 

The pear salad was awful - far too much cinnamon, missing acidity in the dressing, and had the oddest seasoning combo. Just a big miss. 

My friend enjoyed the scallops, and were likely the best of all we ordered. My salmon was poorly prepared: overcooked, tough to cut, little to no seasoning or taste, and the mustard on top was basically squeezed on like you would do to a hot dog. The polenta was more like a polenta cake - chewy, tough to cut, and missing any real flavor. Also, the entire dish was not served hot - so disappointing.

The Bistro clearly built its establishment around serving wine: their wine list is pretty sizable, the decor is nice but subdued at the same time, the lighting is easy on alcohol-induced glazed eyes, and they even have paintings on the wall of wine or people sipping on wine.

Wine is great but if your party&#39;s not in the mood to throw back a few bottles, your choices are numbered. As far as beer is concerned, they have Miller Lite and one Two Brothers brew on tap, and they may have Beck&#39;s in bottles. And that&#39;s it.

Their food items are all geared toward a higher-end audience: they&#39;re all pricey and fancy. My girlfriend enjoys it here so, at times, I&#39;ve come here in a red-blooded American type of mood and I haven&#39;t been satisfied.

Cellar Bistro&#39;s a nice place but it&#39;s kind of like listening to Michael Buble.

We had the shrimp appetizer and then I had the tuna wrap with a pear salad.  Both were very good.  Hubby had a special which was pasta with some tuna on it.  

There was a big table next to us with some kids and they were pretty well behaved.  Two were older and one was a baby.  This is NOT a place for a toddler who can&#39;t stay in his/her seat.  There is nowhere for them to roam!

I&#39;ve had some dietary issues lately and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have a gluten-free menu here.  There are quite a few items on it, not as many as the regular menu, but still lots to choose from.

We used a restaurant.com gift certificate to pay for our meal and hit a speed bump.  Apparently the restaurant is concerned that gift certificate holders are not going to tip their servers enough.  When we got the bill, the total of our meal showed the gift certificate deduction, but then there was another line that said something like SERVICE FEE and then there was a blank line for a tip.  Neither one of us could figure out what it meant.  A service fee for using a gift certificate?  It was so confusing!  Turns out, that the SERVICE FEE is the suggested tipping amount on your original charge before the gift certificate.  

I didn&#39;t like that whole setup.  It made me feel like I was dealing with a used car salesman and kind of ruined my nice mellow meal.",20/05/11,159,4,2,5,38,4.9241,2.7649999999999997,1.049,15.186000000000002,No,1484

Street parking was readily available and I believe a free parking lot/garage is around the block. I ordered the Bistro Burgers while  another ordered the salad topped with Salmon, and we shared. I ordered the burgers MR with white cheddar cheese, they arrived well but still delicious, moist and not offensive with garlic. They came with tender, nicely seasoned oven roasted potatoes. The salmon was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked and the salad was a mix of leaves of many colors, red onions, shaved carrots and capers in a lovely vinegar/oil dressing. Among the 8 diners, an assortment of dishes were ordered, and everyone was pleased. The salmon salad and the burgers were $12 or $14, coffee was $4 and very good, and a cup of the wonderful mushroom, brie soup was $4, bowl is $6. If you like mushrooms, you&#39;ll love this soup. Service was pleasant, prompt and unobtrusive (no &#34;Hi, I&#39;m Bambi and I&#39;m here to interrupt your conversations &amp;/or disturb you every 5 minutes to ask if everything is all right). Samantha and staff were quietly observant and provided what was needed at the proper time. I can only surmise that the complaints here are from envious competitors. The flowers on the table were real. Sidewalk seating is available in nice weather. The chocolate cake dessert was not chocolate in color only, it had a rich chocolate flavor.

The restaurant is small, or &#34;cozy&#34;, depending on how you look at it. The staff is friendly and we didn&#39;t have to wait at all for a table. They placed us at a 2 seat table in the back corner, which I prefer because I hate sitting out in the middle of the dining room.

We ordered the brushetta (spelling???) for an appetizer, which was really, really good.

For my main entree&#39; I had the grilled salmon. It was juicy (but not soggy) with a lot of flavor and great seasoning. For a side dish, I opted for the garlic mashed potatoes. They were really good, but nothing to get excited about.

And for dessert, my wife and I shared a brownie topped with mint ice cream and whipping cream on the side. I&#39;m a sucker for brownies a la mode! Can&#39;t get enough. Brownies and ice cream go together better than peanut butter and jelly.

Overall this restaurant is great and I&#39;d definitely go back and definitely recommend it. The price is about right for what you get.

I loved the bistro atmosphere, which means that it&#39;s a little noisy - but, it&#39;s &#34;friendly&#34; noise and not too boisterous.  

As other reviews have stated, the mushroom brie soup is absolutely wonderful, and the red and golden beet salad is a delight also.  We all got the specials, with two of us having the New York strip steak with garlic mash potatoes and a kale/asparagus side.  The steaks were both tasty and huge (had to take some home) - the sides were very good, except the potatoes were a little on the cool side (we could live with it).  The other special we had, the grilled red grouper, was a flavorable entree - however, the quinoa tabbouleh and yellow squash sides were a little on the bland side - all still good, however.  The lemon sorbet with raspberries and raspberry sauce was a perfect finish.

Our server Blaine was excellent (I believe I have read at least one other positive review about him here) - including recommending a wine that my rather discerning sister enjoyed.

The staff was polite, the atmosphere was nice (like...umm... a cellar bistro kind of) and the temperature was nice even though it was freezing outside and the place is pretty small.

My dad ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer, and I ordered the baked brie.  My dad seemed to like his crab cakes, and my baked brie was delicious.  It came with tiny slices of raisin bread, currant jam (I think), pecans, and pear slices. It was so delicious that I ate the whole brie and almost all the bread, and then I was stuffed and could barely work on my entree.

We both ordered the sea bass that was on special.  It came with leek and potato puree, artichokes,  and green onion and prosciutto and something else green on top.  The fish was cooked perfectly, not too dry.

I brought the rest of it home, and I ate it the next day at work for lunch.  I even skipped going out to lunch with my coworkers because I knew the delicious sea bass was awaiting me in my lunch bag.

We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. Although the dip itself was fine, it was served with chips...not homemade chips, or even thick chips that would have been appropriate with the dish, but chips that looked and tasted exactly like grocery-bought doritos. I understand that restaurants occasionally don&#39;t make every part of what they serve, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt like it was this obvious that they just grabbed something from the store and threw it on the plate.

For entree, I tried the Ahi Tuna Salad and Jalapeno, Pineapple, and Prosciutto Pizza. I&#39;ve had better for both dishes. The Ahi Tuna was really warm (which is a little unappetizing with half raw fish), and it was overcooked. They should have taken the fish off the heat a minute earlier. The pizza, on the other hand, was nothing special. It was pretty salty and very generic. 

I will say that I thought the ambience was nice. It&#39;s a very cute restaurant, and there was live music the day we went. Our server seemed a little preoccupied talking with some of her friends, and ignored us for a bit. There was another server working in the same area, though, and he took care of most of our needs.

They were out of the quiche of the day.  Our server told us they only make 7 &#34;pieces&#34; a day.  We opted for the chicken skewers and the grilled salmon salad.  The chicken looked over cooked by my wife said it was OK.  It came with a nice vinaigrette and bibb lettuce not cheap iceberg as you might expect.

I really love Bistro food and found it difficult to make a decision what to order. My sister and I decided to split the pan seared vegetable pizza, and, for a starter, I ordered the citrus salad, and she got the pear salad. After ordering over the phone, the restaurant told us it would be ready in 25-30 minutes which was pretty spot on and there was no waiting when we arrived to pick up the food (despite it being a VERY busy Saturday dinner crowd). It may have partially been the fact that I was totally famished/exhausted, but I thought the food was amazing. My sister and I inhaled our salads and devoured all of the pizza (which if you have a relatively normal sized appetite is perfect for sharing). My mom loved the grilled chicken wrap and the bistro house salad, which sounded delicious, but I couldn&#39;t manage to steal a bite of either...oh well, maybe next time. 

So, as far as take out goes, I give The Cellar Bistro high marks. I must note though, this place really makes me want to come back, split a bottle of wine with friends, and feast on that cheese medley appetizer....doesn&#39;t seem at all like a bad way to spend an evening or two :)",01/02/11,163,4,1,5,-8,4.1796,1.238,0.174,6.5889999999999995,No,1303

Server had a nice personality and was somewhat knowledgable about menu and wine list.  But, too many fatal flaws.  First, our dinners were served without forks.  When we informed our server she went inside (we were dining in the outside area) to get them.  About 4-5 mins pass and still no silverware, while our food sits there getting cold.  I go inside to inquire and there&#39;s our server waiting at the bar for my wife&#39;s wine order.  After signaling to her that we still needed forks she eventually brought out the forks and the wine.  I guess she didn&#39;t want to make two trips.  Second, the food.  Small portions for one.  Chicken saltimbocca was tiny, and oddly paired with mashed potatoes and peas.  My fault for thinking this might work because it didn&#39;t.  Third, my wife&#39;s first cut into a large shrimp resulted in the shrimp disintegrating.  That&#39;s right, a soft, bad shrimp.  The odor was indescribable in a bad way.  Lastly, upon informing our waiter of the bad shrimp she said sorry and would Inform the manager.  The check arrives, we get ready to pay a full bill of 100 bucks or so, and I ask her out of curiosity what the manager had to say about the bad shrimp.  Her reply was she forgot to tell him.  Really.  Now, she did adjust the bill by 9.00.  Fair enough, a simple apology and please come back would have sufficed.

Server accidentally dropped a wine glass on the patio table, it shatters onto my husband, his person, my legs and the ground. We were moved to a new table and it was cleaned up..after another couple took the table. Apology was rapid but distracted. 
No utensils on the table for half the meal. We asked twice. We ended up sharing forks and one napkin for half the meal.
The appetizer was mushrooms stuffed with blue cheese. Little hints of blue cheese and mostly Alfredo sauce inside of mushrooms that came with tortilla chips as garnish. Tortilla chips? With mushrooms? 
Pizza with chevre, olives and bacon but smothered in  gobs of shredded mozzarella? 
Dessert would have been nice. We didn&#39;t have time. We asked for the check to be forgotten, again. My husband went inside to get it. The woman we asked for the check didn&#39;t relay to our server who seemed baffled.

So many things could be done to help this bistro. Wheaton needs one. With all the BMW&#39;s cruising by, the potential is there. In my opinion, it falls flat. Tonight, it was confused food without a chef looking it over or coukd care less a out taste and experience. (Tortilla chips as garnish at a bistro; those corn chips were going out with at least three appetizers I saw.)

We came for an early dinner, with a last minute reservation. Located in charming area of Downtown wheaton. Relatviely empty upon arrival, full when we left.

I had The Wrap with grouper fish - it was unexpectadly, but very good. It came with a garlic potato salad which was the hit of the meal. It contained red potatos, chives, mayo, parsley, and garlic. Unusually, tasting, but the best potato salad I&#39;ve ever had.

My three kids ordered pizzas - A Margarita which could have been good, but was too bland, A Pepperoni &amp; Bacon which had a tasteless crust, and a Kid&#39;s vcheese which was very oilly. Cellar Bistro has a brick oven, so their pizzas COULD taste fantastic, but from what I tried, they were only average. 

That being said, you don&#39;t go to a French-style bistro for the pizza.

My final guest has a severe gluten allergy. She ordered Pork medallions with fruit and nuts,  and a sweet potato mash. She isn&#39;t open to new foods, but she loved this.

So, we went on Valentine&#39;s Day, which may not be the best time to visit somewhere for the first time, but we couldn&#39;t make up our mind on where to go so we just popped in here after driving around downtown Wheaton for a while. 

We didn&#39;t have a reservation, and despite the room being mostly empty were told we would have to wait for them to figure out where to put us. Ok, understandable. We got a seat by the window, which was nice. Pillows on the banquette were a nice touch. However, it was freezing cold and I had to wear my jacket throughout dinner. Mood lighting was nice, and they had a guitar player noodling around to add to the romantic atmosphere.

Wine list is not vast. A couple of choices in each category, many that you can find at Jewel or Dominick&#39;s. No flights available. A little disappointing for a wine bar.  We ordered cosmos to start, which were not very tasty and $11 each. No garnish or anything special about them at all.

The set Valentine&#39;s Day meal was a 5 course for $50 or so, with choice of fish or beef. We didn&#39;t know this going in but decided to roll with it since it was getting later in the evening.  We sat for a long while before someone came to take a drink order. We asked about the menu and were put off. Little menu cards would have been a nice touch. We told our waitress about my allergy and when the other waitress brought out the appetizer it was not edible due to my allergy. Zero communication between waitress #1, #2 and kitchen.  They quickly made an adjustment for me, which was great.

Appetizer was good, creamy leek soup was divine, the salad was gross (shredded lettuce? really? very Taco Bell), entrees were so-so and dessert was just fine. I didn&#39;t feel like we got our $50 worth... quantity of food was there but quality definitely was not. We left full but not satisfied.

On a side note, my date is married - to someone else. We used to be co-workers but now she&#39;s my best friend. Unfortunately  she and her husband don&#39;t get out often so we try to have dinner whenever I&#39;m in town. Nothing more than that. But I digress.

Now on to what I&#39;m not a fan of. The bar, great bar, knowledgable bartender, but only two choices of Vodka? Supposedly they were waiting on an order to come in. HMMMM

On to the appetizer. We started with their form of bruschetta. Way too much vinegar. Dinner was also not memorable. Next we shared a plate of pesto stuffed mushrooms. Quite frankly I thought they forgot the pesto. I couldn&#39;t taste it at all. We ended the evening with a cheese medley which wasn&#39;t bad, but not memorable.

I made a reservation, but the only tables were bistro tables, so mom and I decided to wait until a lower table was available and sat at the bar.  We ordered a bottle of Woop Woop Shiraz and it was wonderful.  Our bartender, Jerry, was very nice in his recommendations and service.  

When we were seated, we got our appetizer osf3 dips with crostinis and chips.  Delicious! Especially the red pepper and white cheddar dip.  I definitely recommend this!  Yum!

I had the red and yellow beet salad with goat cheese, and my mom had the deconstruted blue cheese salad.  Again, delicious!

Then on to our entrees.  I had the chicken saltimbocca and mom had the surf and turf.  A medium rare prime ribeye, perfectly cooked scallops, and beautifully cooked large prawns.  We both had creamy but chunky garlic mashed potatoes, I had peas, she had mushrooms.  I can&#39;t say enough how delicious both of our meals were.  We got another bottle of wine when our first ran out. This time, Rivere, a Spanish blend.  Another yummy bottle with just the perfect bite and smoothness.

Even though we both had leftovers from dinner, we ordered the chocolate cake a la mode to share.  I was pleasantly surprised as I don&#39;t normally like cake.  It was amazing!

In short, we both highly recommend The Cellar Bistro. It was the best experience we&#39;ve had at a restaurant in many  many years.  Our server, Blaine, was exceptional in his service and recommendations and the assistant manager (I am embarrassed to say I do not remember her name), was also very nice and made sure we got our cake for free for my birthday.

The food was very good.  I had mushroom brie soup, which was delicious and very generously sized.  I also had the caprese salad, which was very fresh.  I did not care for the balsamic glaze, but I am a caprese purist - I like mine like they make it in Italy: tomatoes, fresh mozz, basil, olive oil, sea salt, pepper.  No balsamic.

A colleague had a delicious-looking crab and avocado salad.  I didn&#39;t hear any complaints from any of my dining companions.

I&#39;m really digging this place, and haven&#39;t even taken the first bite. Tasteful, homey, welcoming pictures and decor with a cork board to pin your business card! Noice!!

Eager employees greet you with a warm friendly smile and are knowledgable about the menu. I got the flamethrower burger which was on point! The buns were toasted on the insides with plenty butter! So good! You get a very generous portion of fresh cut fries and they have creole seasoning on their condiment table, which is great, btw! Just ask for no salt because it makes the fries extra salty with it on them also.

The food was so good and plenty filling, but I couldn&#39;t resist ordering a custard with a baseball helmet bowl!? What?? I&#39;m sold! Haha and I&#39;m glad I did. It was SO good! Definitely the best custard I&#39;ve had in a long time.

I also loved the family board and card games at Van&#39;s. My son and I played Connect 4, but there were many others - like a giant table game of checkers! There are also crayons, coloring books, and small toys to keep kids occupied while you wait.  

After we visited, friends kept mentioning how great their burgers were. So we went back the next weekend to try some. They certainly didn&#39;t disappoint. I only wish I knew that you had to ask for all your toppings separately. I ordered a bacon mushroom cheeseburger that I thought would come with lettuce, tomato, mayo. etc. It doesn&#39;t.

Housed in a remodeled Standard Oil gas station that dates back to 1927, Van&#39;s is the creation of Tulane graduate Chad Van Acker - inspired he sez, by a visit to the Ben and Jerry&#39;s factory when he was a toddler.

Located on Main Street in the quaint village of East Dundee, steps from the Fox River and across the street from a Dairy Queen, Chad has carved out a niche for himself as well as a popular following by serving fresh and refreshing flavors of custard and sorbet, as well as some pretty outrageous burgers and sandwiches.

My intention was just to stop in for a small cup o&#39; custard on a hot Chicago summer day, but when I saw some other patrons enjoying the burgers, my priority shifted.

I ordered the bacon/cheddar burger (all burgers come with fresh cut fries), and there is a healthy list of condiments you can add gratis.  I went with my usual: mustard, pickle, raw onion.

Here&#39;s an insider&#39;s (me) tip:  if you plan on eating the burger, don&#39;t start munching the fries first.  They are addictive.  Hot, crisp, potato-y, lightly seasoned, amazing fries.  Even In N Out would be jealous. Even the fat cats in Oak Brook.

The amply-sized beef patty had a nice char on it from the gas grill, with a very fresh sesame bun, lots of thick cut smokey bacon, and freshly prepared vegetable condiments.  I&#39;m glad I stopped with a short-list of add ons, if I had added lettuce and tomato, the burger wouldn&#39;t have fit in my mouth - it&#39;s a massive sandwich.

If you want to know just how good it is, peel off a section of the bun and condiments and take a bite of just the beef.  Flavorful and tastes the way beef should taste.

I chased the burger with a cup of the custard flavor of the day, Mint Chocolate Chip, which was creamy and delicious.  

Mr. Van Acker, congrats.  Build a dozen or so more.",15/07/15,247,4,2,5,11,5.4507,2.4459999999999997,0.749,15.804,No,2028

I brought two of my sisters in last weekend. We weren&#39;t really hungry at all, but we were getting ready to leave the area. I wouldn&#39;t stop yammering on about this frozen custard and my precious pretzel crunch, so they begrudgingly wandered in with me. 

So here&#39;s what we did. Kids scoops!  Half vanilla/half chocolate. A couple toppings each. Great idea!  It was plenty of custard. They got each order exactly right.

--------------------------------------------------------
Van&#39;s frozen custard is INCREDIBLE!

My wife, daughter and I cannot get enough of their custard.  It is so smooth, so rich and so decadent.  Makes me wonder why/how the alleged competition (DQ) can even compete.  

My wife and I are foodies so we have seen every Food Network show talking about the making of ice cream.  The average over-run (air mixed into ice cream) of commercial ice cream is about 50%...Van&#39;s custard over-run is about 10% which results in a super smooth and velvety texture.  

What makes it even better is that they make it fresh in what seem to be endless batches.  When we were there last night, they were just finishing making their chocolate and then they made their flavor of the day immediately afterward.

They make Vanilla and Chocolate every day and also a flavor of the day which is posted on their website.  We check their site and print their calendar and make special plans to go there for some of our favorite flavors.

They also make dairy-free sorbets and Italian ice - Lemon Ice is made every day and they have a flavor of the day sorbet (which is also listed on their calendar.

It is a family owned business (Mom and Son) and they seem to be there for every shift...I don&#39;t know when they sleep.",15/07/13,176,5,1,5,-59,4.072900000000001,1.5600000000000003,0.0,12.44,No,1649

Tons of sundae specials (mint explosion and choco-mallow are the ones I remember but I think they had about 4) and lots of dessert options. We went on Saturday because I specifically wanted the custard flavor of the day, birthday cake. Before I ordered I sampled the lemon sorbet custard, which I think they have everyday as a non dairy option and it was absolutely delicious! I would have gotten that along with the birthday cake custard but I didn&#39;t think the two would mix well. 

The birthday cake custard was a bit of a disappointment for me. There were too many big chunks of really dry yellow cake mixed in for my liking, and I was expecting the custard itself to be cake batter flavored when it kind of just tasted like vanilla. However, the waffle cone i got it in was absolutely delicious! It had more of a cinnamon flavor than other cones I&#39;ve had and I really enjoyed it. Even though the custard I had wasn&#39;t for me, I definitely want to try some of the other treats on their menu. 

Something I really liked was that inside the store they posted letters 6th graders at a nearby middle school wrote to Van&#39;s as a school project highlighting their favorite local business. That made me feel good that this was such a neighborhood place, and I like supporting businesses like that.",07/07/13,142,4,2,5,30,4.2328,1.926,0.373,9.701,No,1368

I haven&#39;t had a problem with kids out of the four times I have been here, as the other reviews imply.

As to which I have a question too. How can you avoid kids when going out to ice cream? AND  if that ruins your experience, than you must be a old fart that doesn&#39;t like the kids to run thru their own lawn.

Kids laughing and running around brings the nostalgic part of going out to get Ice Cream back. Its a great place to bring families as they have plenty of room.

For starters, parking is a disaster.  There are 3-4 spots in front which are all but unusable since blindly backing out onto Main St. is a good way to get into a car accident.

Once you have the car parked, however, things take a dramatic turn for the better.  They did an excellent job with remodeling an old, run down building which housed several previously unsuccessful restaurants.  Essentially, everything looks brand new.  

I cannot comment on the food since we did not order any, but we did try a couple of sundae&#39;s and found them to be outstanding.  A bit on the pricey side, but well worth it.  The burgers that we did see looked very good.  

I do a lot of cycling in the summer and look forward to stopping in during the summer months when out for a ride.  It will certainly be a lot easier to find parking for a bike.

The real star is the custard - any other ice cream you ever eat will pale in comparison.  they always have vanilla and chocolate, plus a flavor of the day and non-dairy sorbet.

Well let me tell you about the burgers and fries...

Burger - well seasoned, nice crust on the outside from the griddle, high quality bacon and a decent amount of toppings (I got mushrooms, grilled onions, and bbq sauce).  Cooked through but still messy/juicy!  Not a thing to order when wearing a white top.  One burger could feed me and my 10yo daughter, but hey, I want leftovers for lunch!

On to the fries, they offer regular AND sweet potato!  They appear to be hand cut, and are cooked nice and crispy!  Yum, YUm, YUM!  A small order could feed two adults as a side, I&#39;d be afraid to see what their large looks like.

Their custard and sorbet alone is worth a trip, but now I am SO glad there is a local place that takes their burgers as seriously as I do.

Quality is a bit on the cheap side, but what&#39;s cool is they have a variety of seasonings you can  add yourself.

I came here on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn&#39;t crowded at all but there were a few groups that were already seated. The walls and decor are bright and colorful, which set a fun, welcoming vibe. The place isn&#39;t very big, but there was plenty of seating area. 

This is more of a fast-food style restaurant, so the menu is up at the top and you place your order with the cashier in the front. The menu is easy to read and navigate. I ordered the soft shell crab burger and carbonara wings. 

Soft Shell Crab Burger: DELICIOUS! Lightly fried, very crispy, and nicely seasoned. I added some spicy mayo for an extra kick-- it was amazing! I had my eye on the shrimp patty burger as well, but I&#39;m glad I ordered this one. 

Carbonara Wings: So, there was a mixup with the cashier and she actually put in the order with sauce on the side. I&#39;m really glad she did. I&#39;m not sure why it didn&#39;t click to me that carbonara is literally carbonara sauce, as in the pasta. It wasn&#39;t bad, but it just caught me off guard! The wings by itself were large and had a nice crisp breading. Wasn&#39;t oily at all! I&#39;d order this again. 

I&#39;d definitely come back. Next time, I&#39;m willing to try a burger with the rice patty and order fries. I noticed there were many seasoning flavors you can add.. really cool!",30/09/16,167,5,3,5,53,6.6872,4.301,0.168,18.529999999999998,No,1514

They have an extensive burger menu, a few wings options, interesting sides/soups and some tasty fries.

Yesterday was opening day! I have to say everything was running quite smoothly, service was great, food was good - just a very pleasant opening for Gabutto Burger! The only disappointment was that the Carbonara fries and wings which sounded cool &amp; different were not available.

My best bud and I shared an order of fries, a Gabutto burger with cheese, and the BBQ Pork Rice Burger $6.95. The owner (I am assuming? or maybe manager?) was so sweet and accommodating! She was walking around and thought our fries looked too well done and made a completely fresh order for us! What a kind gesture...and I thought the &#39;overcooked&#39; fries were just fine but appreciated the attention to detail! She also gave us opening day coasters, woohoo!

The fries were tasty and the various saucy dips made it fun (wasabi mayo, spicy mayo and ketchup) - I liked the spicy mayo best! They also have seasonings for the fries which seemed really cool and again, fun flavors, but honestly we tried 4 and didn&#39;t think they made much flavor difference to the fries.

The Gabutto Cheeseburger was good, but nothing over the top amazing. I really enjoyed the BBQ Pork Rice Burger. It was unique and edgy but incredibly messy to eat. The buns are made of rice and it kind of all collapsed after my first bite. However, the flavors in the bbq pork and how the meat was cooked was just perfect. I loved how the flavoring of the pork seeped into the rice, nomzzzz. I&#39;d get this again but be prepared with a fork next time. 

Ah yes, they were blasting baby metal when we went in. That was hilarious. Cute, casual decor, good food, and great service made for a lovely time at Gabutto Burger and I wish them the best in Rolling Meadows!

All the crap-flavored powders don&#39;t help justify the high prices and limited offerings.

The mayos are rather bland as far as flavored mayos go but do serve their purpose to help down the fries before they cool off and harden only to destroy your gum line.

The decor is cheesy Japaneesy and rather tiny. Orange and yellow are quite bright and nauseating.

The big coke fusion machine is crapola but the youngsters dig it.

I&#39;ll stick the brewed iced tea. 

If you like an Asian flare to your crappy fast-food, you&#39;ll probably love this place.

My favorite sushi dish is tuna Maki, TL&#39;s tuna can be hit or miss.  Sometimes when I order it&#39;s really fresh other times it has a fish taste which to me says old. I thought that it had to do with the time of week I bought. However there&#39;s no consistency with it as I&#39;ve tracked it. 

The very first time I ever ordered delivery I had a lobster Maki roll, it was horrible and I never ordered it again. As far as price goes they are on par with the other sushi places in Bartlett, if you go outside of Bartlett you&#39;re going to find cheaper. However they are the only place that delivers to my house.

I highly recommend the Chicago fire roll and the Sakura roll. Those are my two favorite rolls. TL&#39;s is not well known for their variety in rolls, I would suggest going to Tokyo steakhouse if you want a wide breadth of sushi rolls. 

They are still my go to place for sushi because of the area I live in. Also their delivery service is awesome. Never once has a delivery person forgotten something or given me the wrong thing. 

I have also never had an issue when ordering, they always get my order right over the phone no matter who I&#39;m talking to.

Hand grenades: two pieces, not necessarily a roll. Each piece is served on top of a slice of orange and shrimp. Served warm. 

Mongolian beef: is a good choice as well and served as a good size

Basil garlic chicken was also tasty

Snapper: I talked to the table next to mine, they say that the snapper is very good, though I cannot confirm.

Most Chinese or Japanese restaurants are pretty indistinct when it comes to the meals they offer. The entrees and appetizers are really what makes this place stand out. And soups! It they start offering fresh ramen I think I&#39;d eat here every meal, but they still offer more and unique soups than you can typically find elsewhere.
I usually get the soups when I order take-out. I also love the Chirashi bowl. Don&#39;t be afraid to try appetizers and entrees you&#39;ve never heard of, because they&#39;re all good. My current favorite is TL&#39;s Snapper. The fish is battered and fried and served in a very sweet and flavorful sauce. I also really like the mapu tofu, which is moderately spicy.

However, I can&#39;t do it.  Their service is AWFUL!!  Out of 4 times I have been here (both dine-in and carry out) they have forgotten things, mixed up orders, forgotten food, etc.)  

We keep going back because the food is SO good and SO fresh...but that&#39;s when you actually get what you order...

There have been times when we did pickup, and they completely forgot two entrees that we paid for (and then didn&#39;t answer when we called back).  They gave us some completely different dish than the mongolian beef we ordered.  None of us could eat it because it was too spicy.  

And when we dined in, OH MY GOSH.  I don&#39;t know what we did to our waiter to make him hate us, but he had some serious attitude.  It changed when the (separate) bills came, and it was time to tip, but it was Too Little Too Late at that point.

He was bringing our food out in shifts (one person got their food 20 minutes after everyone else, and was STARVING).

tls-four-seasons-chinese-and-japanese-cuisine-bartlett,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,mEJwHqqrJPGK5UMY0LvOVQ,"This place was a complete surprise for me. Bartlett is one of the last places I&#39;d expect to find an excellent Chinese restaurant. Like other restaurants that have done well in the Top 100 Chinese Restaurants Competition, the authentic Chinese food is amazingly good but the Americanized food is only passable (in my opinion). The food here reminds me a bit of iChef in Hoffman Estates in style but more like Lao Sze Chuan in Chinatown in terms of execution. I don&#39;t recall seeing this restaurant in the Zagat Guide, but based on what I&#39;ve tried so far, I&#39;d probably give them a 24.

The Chongqing Style Noodle Soup is definitely something you should try if you love nice hot soup that&#39;s not excessively strong in flavor. They are very generous with the amount of whitefish they give you as we were able to make 8 fully loaded small bowls with cellophane noodles and fish with the amount of soup given to us. The mustard greens were not extremely strong in flavor but just strong enough where I noticed them. They can make this non-spicy but spicy soup is amazingly nice in the winter time.

The Honey Sesame Crispy Beef had a nice flavor to it, but the texture wasn&#39;t quite as tender as I would have liked it to be. My problem though could be that I compared everyone&#39;s version of this dish to Sun Shui&#39;s Crispy Szechuan Beef and that&#39;s why I feel disappointed with everyone else&#39;s version. The egg roll was okay but nothing special.

This was not on the menu, but we had them make Cantonese-style ginger and scallion red snapper fillets. This was a really nice variation of a popular dish that was perfectly balanced with a strong flavor and not too much salt. The excellent execution of this dish makes me want to try the Chendu Snapper and Spicy Chili Fish next time.

The Beef Chow Fun (Gon Chao Ngau Ho style) was one of the best I&#39;ve had outside Chinatown. It had a strong onion flavor to it and beef that was seared to slightly crispy on the edges. It wasn&#39;t excessively oily like most of the versions I run across and had just the right amount of salt to be noticeable but not overbearing.

Their Cumin Lamb (Zi Ran Yang Rou) was excellently done with a strong flavor of onion and peppers and lamb that was cooked to a nice tender texture without being overdone and slightly crispy on the edges. I don&#39;t even like cumin but the dish was so excellently executed I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.

I wish I&#39;d taken pictures of the authentic Chinese menu since it&#39;s not on their website. Like other highly rated Chinese restaurants, that menu is where you&#39;ll really find the hidden treasures the restaurant offers.",12/11/11,288,5,2,5,38,8.5374,3.9099999999999997,0.9510000000000001,16.139,No,2680

PROS
- they serve both Chinese and Japanese food so if you go in a group, there&#39;s a higher probability everyone will be pleased.  It&#39;s rare to find a restaurant like this
- both Chinese and Japanese food are good which is even rarer
- Big sushi/rolls menu and it&#39;s good quality.  Prices are decent for sushi, which is a bit too expensive but that&#39;s just my opinion about sushi prices in general
- Lunch bento boxes are a very good deal.  Lots of food (choice of meat, rice, salad, tempura veggies, 3 california rolls) for less than most places (~$8).  Very good as well
- Chinese dishes are somewhat &#34;fusion&#34;-like, not really authentic but very good
- Nice family atmosphere.  Nothing fancy but nice enough interior to take someone on a date

CONS
- Chinese dishes are, on average, very salty.  They really load up the salt.  Can be unbearable unless you tell them to put less salt or eat it with rice.  An example is the garlic chicken.  Very good but very salty
- One time we ordered bento boxes for takeout and they didn&#39;t give us tempura veggies.  We called them and they said they don&#39;t give out tempura veggies for takeout.  I thought this was idiotic because that means we&#39;re paying the same amount of money for less food.  This was years ago and I told them I&#39;d never go back.  I finally went back after many years, but just avoid ordering out bento boxes from them.  Not sure if they&#39;ve changed their policy on the take out orders for bento boxes

We went here after my nephews graduation ceremony last week. I was a little hesitant: I&#39;m not a sushi fan by any means, and I&#39;m not big on trying new Chinese/Japanese restaurants, but woah!! These guys are good. A little hidden gem across from the tracks in downtown Bartlett. 

I was without my better half this particular evening (limited tickets for the graduation), so I chose to order something I would eat and that he would enjoy too. We ordered some apps that were pretty tasty...some meat on a stick thingy and pot stickers (pretty decent).

I ordered the &#34;Yu Shiang Dish (Garlic Sauce) - This flavor only shows up in Szechwan food. Sweet, Sour, and Spicy are a perfect match w/ginger, garlic and scallion flavor.&#34; I opted for Chicken as my protein of choice. I love ginger and garlic, so how bad could it be?

And they were barely stuffed with any meat. the Calamari was on point though, nice and crispy. We also got two hot and sour soups which were so so so good!! Perfect for such a cold new years day. I forgot what we ordered exactly but it was a crispy noodle combo dish and honey glazed chicken or something.

I think the only reason why I would ever eat here is because of how close it is to my boyfriend&#39;s place. Other than that, from my first experience I&#39;d just skip this place for dinner.",06/01/13,143,3,2,2,28,1.3690000000000002,2.377,2.286,17.336999999999996,No,1348
tls-four-seasons-chinese-and-japanese-cuisine-bartlett,Christina G.,kmrK4LByvnX3SgU2tIDmOw,CQL0K1jvkJz0peKgzvk21g,"I came here last weekend with my husband and in-laws, and good times were had by all.

My husband had made reservations for the 4 of us, so we got there and walked in, no wait at all.

We started off with some warm sake that definitely warmed us up on a chilly night.

For appetizers, we got the tried and true crab rangoons, and the mushroom and scallops. The rangoons were good, but they were more chewy than crunchy. The sweet and sour sauce that came with them was very tasty. it had an extra note of orange that I wasn&#39;t expecting, but really liked. The scallop and mushrooms was fantastic. the scallops were cooked perfectly, super tender and not rubbery.

On the recommendation of a friend, I had the miso soup and was not disappointed.

For dinner, we did a combination of 3 main dishes, some sushi rolls, and some chicken fried rice. 

The Mongolian chicken, pepper garlic beef, and honey sesame crispy beef were all very good - I&#39;d recommend any of them. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the pepper garlic beef. I only had a little of it, but it was really tender, and not at all greasy.

I believe we ordered the California roll, Chicago roll, and one of the spicy rolls (scallop or shrimp, I forget). Judging from my ability to remember, you can guess the sushi was just OK, but not very memorable. Everything was very fresh, but I don&#39;t think we picked that interesting of rolls. Maybe if we&#39;d gotten more from their signature rolls I would have been more blown away.

As for the chicken fried rice, it was chicken fried rice. Kinda greasy, not the star of the meal, and just as it should be. You know, one of those dishes you aren&#39;t really blown away by because it&#39;s standard fare, but if the dish was bad, you&#39;d judge the restaurant.

The experience itself was nice. We were there for about 2 hours and never felt rushed, even though we saw quite a few people waiting for tables when we left. The servers were very nice, and were very attentive. 

I would definitely go back if I find myself in the area again.",31/10/12,227,4,1,5,8,7.418500000000001,4.448,0.264,20.287999999999997,No,2061

I live local, so it&#39;s nice to get some fresh sashimi in close proximity to my house...and they deliver so I can shlub around in my pajamas and eat all fancy.  However it seems that every time I go to TL&#39;s, the quality of food and service get worse and worse.  

So I normally order the sashimi appetizer.  While it started out very fresh and very well presented, lately it&#39;s gotten that not-so-fresh sashimi feel which is just blech.  Will not order anymore.  

I also usually order the shrimp (2) with vegetable tempura (5),  It&#39;s a cheap-o appetizer that used to taste fantastic, but on my last visit it was inedible.  The oil used to fry it in was obviously old judging by the taste, the batter was rubbery, and the sweet potato tempura had dark black spots on it.  And the topper was an entire half of a green pepper; tempura style. GROSS.  All of it went in the trash. 


The service when you dine in is pretty meh.  For some reason they can never remember to bring drinks, and it almost seems as if a person is a regular there, they get their food served before others.  Just an observation.",01/12/13,141,2,1,2,-16,1.9104,1.2449999999999999,1.38,12.375,No,1197

I was so glad I had made reservations.  As we dined the tiny waiting area was overflowing &amp; the bar stayed packed to the gills so be prepared to wait or definitely make reservations.  They&#39;ve squeezed in as many tables as they can to accommodate their popularity so also be prepared to carefully weave your way through the densely populated space to get to your table and/or use the restroom.

With that said, once the food arrived we knew why this place was popular.  The food was amazing &amp; reasonably priced.  We brought a friend who never had sushi before so we ordered a variety of things.  A large sake for us to share, 2 tempura appetizers, a plate of dumplings, the American&#39;s Favorite Sushi platter &amp; the CPT Roll platter.  Of course it all came with a small salad &amp; miso soup for each of us.  All that amazing goodness cost us $75 before tip.  Sweet!

On subsequent visits we have tried various other sushi offerings - all of them delicious.  The Super White Tuna (SWT) is amazing!  How can raw fish melt in your mouth? I have no idea but the SWT delivers.  The volcano roll was also quite popular at our table and good for anyone who shies away from the raw offerings.  
Most recently we tried the Kamikaze &#34;rolls&#34; - actually served in an endive leaf, and the Triple KC roll which has no rice &amp; is served in a thinly sliced roll of cucumber.  Those two were my favorites. 

They also have Chinese food and we&#39;ve only tried one entree from that part of the menu - the General Tao&#39;s Chicken (not General Tso&#39;s, as you see at other Chinese restaurants).  This has been our only disappointment.  The cuts of chicken weren&#39;t as high quality as I&#39;ve had elsewhere and the breading on the chicken was completely soggy from the heavy sauce.  I realize anything breaded and fried then covered in sauce will eventually not be crispy but it shouldn&#39;t come to the table already soggy.

The service is also quick and to the point - you will definitely feel rushed if you come here during peak times.  The service is a bit more friendly and relaxed if you come on a week night when they aren&#39;t so insanely busy.

They seem to do a brisk take-out business as well so that&#39;s good to know if you don&#39;t want to wait.",20/08/12,252,4,3,5,55,8.0897,5.604,1.0439999999999998,19.351,No,2432

I have struggled with writing this review for a long time because I am torn.  So here are a few things that I wanted to share about my experience at TL&#39;s Four Seasons. 

I love the black peppered garlic beef.  I get it every time I eat here.  Delicious, tender and well seasoned with a hint of sweetness.  I wish it came with a little more veggies.

Salmon teriaki was over cooked. Sliced too thin... A little dry and tough despite being drowned in sauce.

I have only had sushi a couple of times.  It was tasty and the fish was fresh.

Some meals come with soup and salad.... Others just one or the other.  It is never quite clear how they decide.

This place doesn&#39;t have anything decent for craft brew drinkers, so I feed my thirst for alcohol with scotch.  On more than one occasion I have found that the waiter doesn&#39;t recognize &#34;Glen Fiddich - Neat&#34; as a drink order.
In fact, almost every time I come here there is some small annoyance related to the less than finely tuned communication skills of the waiters.

This place isn&#39;t very big and it doesn&#39;t take much to fill it up.  It always feels full, even when it is not.  I guess I just don&#39;t like the way the tables are laid out.  Plus there is something wrong with the acoustics because it always seems lound.  You can only faintly hear the music when the place is even remotely busy.

Some places have TVs, some don&#39;t.  This one has 2 TVs showing beautiful pictures of the food... But why?  There is no text.  At least that might have helped me order.  But a slideshow of food pictures seems weird to me.  More like something a fast food restaurant would do.

There are always more kids here than I would expect.  It doesn&#39;t seem to be a kid type of restaurant, but I people love to bring their kids here.

So I would come back to TL&#39;s for the food, but all the other small things keep this from being a favorite.  I&#39;m giving it a solid 3 star review, not because it is bad, but because it is not great for me.",14/10/12,230,3,2,3,35,2.0092,3.2680000000000002,2.159,26.574,No,2195

I love this resturant. We always order a mix of Chinese and Japanese food. The waiters are very good they stop by enough so that if we need something we can tell them soon. The food is delicious we always order the dragon role and make the spicy tuna a hand role (which I urge you to try). They have some of the best fried rice in the world and they bring it out in a huge bole so if your getting other things it&#39;s a good idea to share it.

My family has been going to this restaurant since it opened because it is in a good location for us to all meet.The food is really great--I love it. 

The issue I cannot get over is the service is HORRIBLE. I have very specific dietary needs/quirks/whatever. Because of this, I am used to ordering very slow in specific detai, explaining exactly what I want . I actually have the waiter repeat what they have written down. (This process is the only way to get your food ordered right so you can dine with the rest of your crew.)

Last night we went there to celebrate my birthday.  The order came out completely WRONG.

Well, the waiter had the nerve to argue with me, huff and puff and make a big deal out of it. Making ME feel horrible that HE got the order wrong. 
 
Well, needless to say this birthday girl felt extra specail and happy watching my friends and family eat and then feeling berated by an boarderline abusive waiter. 

To top it all of there was no apology free drink or any restitution to make things better. Sad to say, this has not been the first time that this has happend at TL&#39;s.  (Similar treatment  has occured at least 4 times in the past. I know, I know...)  

But,I kept comming back because the Basil Chicken dinner is to die for. I can be weak, I am only human!

But, refuse to be &#34;bribed&#34; into going to a place like this no matter how much I like the dang Basil Chicken.  Being treated like a human being is far more important.

Thanks TL for making my birthday extra &#34;sucky&#34; this year. It is the last you will ever see of me or my family.

The moral of this review is:  If you&#39;re a person that likes excellent food that does not really care about being treated humanely, I guess you might enjoy TL&#39;s. If your a masochist with a big appetite, you will be very happy.

The beef shawarma was so good too, I would compare the spicy option to our good old traditional Mexican chorizo..

Time of my visit: Lunch

I was in the mood for some Mediterranean food.  I figured, I would try this place out.  The reviews were decent enough and I was just in the mood.

It&#39;s in the strip mall and unless you know where you are going it&#39;s slightly harder to find.  I ordered large chicken shawarma plate, with tax came to a little over $14.  One knock to start with, they don&#39;t accept AMEX, but they&#39;ll take anything else, including less known JCB (given that it&#39;s on Discover network, but nonetheless, still...).  I wanted to dine in, so I took a sit while they made my food.

The order came out pretty fast.  The chicken shawarma plate was pretty large.  I started with the salad, and it was okay.  I felt there was too much oil on it. Almost to a point of a cover up of some sort.  I was not a fan.

The chicken shawarma with rice and garlic sauce was delicious, freshly cooked, meat tasted soft and moist.  The pita bread was okay.  I would definitely recommend trying it.  With large plate, you will have left overs for sure!

This place is located in a strip mall with no other significant venues beneficial for me so no star on location. My order cost $10.81 and I guess because I didn&#39;t order rice, it wasn&#39;t filling so no star for value. The taste is ok with all the spices and marination but the chicken and beef were over cooked, dry, and chewy, not tender at all. Very bad quality of meat.

I ordered the Combo Plate (spicy), Vegetarian Plate, and Lentil Soup (= $22). 

+ Tahini sauce is AMAZING. Seriously the best thing ever.

+ Jerusalem salad = so good and fresh

+ Yummy bread. Not fresh baked, but soft

+ Lentil Soup was good - very cumin-y

- Falafels were tasty, but a bit harder than I like

+ Portions are good and more flavorful than other Mediterranean places I&#39;ve tried, and I could tell the ingredients are fresh. I get 2-3 meals per small entree.

I feel better eating Halal meat, so I might sneak some from the boyfriend&#39;s leftovers.

Now for the nitty gritty.... Teresa greeted me before the door was even closed behind me. Smiling and happy to tell me all about my options. That was a nice start. We took a little menu tour and I decided on the small combination plate. This included a pita, kefta kabob, chicken kabob (even though I don&#39;t think that was listed on the menu, chicken schwarma and beef schwarma with onions, a tomato wedge and a large piece of green pepper served over a bread of rice. The side salad that was included was a really nice size. My son ate that almost immediately and said it was fresh and tasty. The kefta kabob had the flavor I was looking for and it wasn&#39;t overly dry. The chicken schwarma was a little drier. But everything else was really good. 

You can&#39;t go to Holy Falafel without trying some falafel. Crispy on the outside and large in size with a nice texture inside. I don&#39;t really do the tahini sauce, but that&#39;s all about my pickiness and is not a reflection on their sauce. I don&#39;t eat that anywhere. As a nice treat (and surprise), Teresa put a bit of hummus in the carryout bag for me to try. She was right...I loved that!  

And yes they have some random things for sale. But most of it was on one shelf on one wall. There were a few items that left me confused, but I&#39;m totally okay with it because the food left me satisfied and convinced we will go back.

The bf and I checked this place out 20 minutes before they were closing.  I really thought/expected that they were going to turn us away  and that the food wouldn&#39;t be at it&#39;s best since they were trying to close up-I was wrong! 

The husband and wife owners welcomed us with open arms and encouraged us to eat in.  We asked about the menu, asked about the business, etc. and they were glad to help us. 

We ordered kefta kebab, gyros, falafel and hummus.  The falafel were great, fresh and flavorful and my bf the falafel monster happily chowed them down.  The kefta and gyros were also good, as were the sauces that accompanied them. The meat they serve tasted very fresh and was 100% Halal.  The hummus was plated beautifully and tasted even better than it looked.  

There is a random grocery store like shelf selling spices and Middle Eastern canned foods.  Most of the entrees are under $10 so Royal is pretty well priced for the large portions they offer.

excellent.  My wife said she wants the gyro every day.  The falafel was flavorful with a nice crisp outside.  The hummus was very good.

I have called for delivery on several occasions and have run into the same problems. First, the guy who answers the phone comes across like he is doing you a favor simply by answering the phone; he just seems annoyed with your very existence. Second, they try to discourage your delivery order by quoting you an ungodly wait time. This last time it was an hour-and-a-half, and again that information was delivered with a disinterested and disenfranchised tone. The final insult came when, despite their extensive menu, Mr. Happy informed me they were only &#34;doing&#34; pizzas at that time. Mind you I was placing my order prior to 9:00 p.m. Now, a good pizza place would be forthcoming with information about limiting their menu at a particular time. I have to assume Rosati&#39;s franchise system wouldn&#39;t stand for this. Instead, I believe the guy who answered the phone just wanted to go home, and the inconveneice of a late night order dashed those hopes, so it was just easier to make things difficult for the person on the other end of the line.

Nice salad bar and desserts. Usually like their steaks. Awesome onion rings. They have 3-4 types of soups. Really like their banana pudding thing the best. More variety than what Old Country Buffet offers. Better value than Sweet Tomatoes. They also have soft serve ice cream, ribs, cotton candy, a chocolate fountain, a variety of fruit.

EDIT May 2013 - I&#39;m downgrading it to 2 stars because I came here on a weekend for dinner. It was during their wings promotion and was priced at $11something/person. I would&#39;ve been okay with the price, except that the wings were poor in taste and selection. They were frequently out of their non-original flavors and the sauces weren&#39;t good at all, generally overly sweet and artificial. After that experience, both of us agreed that Golden Corral wasn&#39;t for us anymore. The onion rings were still my favorite though haha.

EDIT June 2013 - 4 stars only for the brunch. 

I was extremely against going here again after my lackluster dinner experience during their wings promotion, but I was outvoted. I&#39;m glad I gave Golden Corral another shot because it turned out to be a great local breakfast option mainly because of their massive, made-to-order omelettes and their fruit/salad spread. You can select the ingredients that you want in your omelette, and it&#39;s made right in front of you, ready in a few minutes. Love their fruit &amp; salad bar, a ton of variety.

And though this might not be my first, second, or third choice for eats, there were some positives, to go along with the negatives, at this exceptionally large international style buffet.

A friend selected this spot so we could &#34;munch&#34; as we discussed work. Our group of 4 soon realized that at peak time, Golden Corral is more entertaining, in terms of people watching, than it is a place to be in work mode.

After forking over bucks to eat until we dropped, we were offered beverage choices, and although several of the iced teas sounded wonderful only one was available. We were ushered to our table, conveniently located smack dab next to the selections of colorful plastic plates and utensils. 

It definitely takes awhile to peruse the choices when you actually hit the buffet line; and height dependent, some folks were underneath all protective barriers when scooping up food. Hmmm. Was it my imagination or did I really see one, make that two, okay three really cute kids select plates and put forks back in the containers after they had hit the all purpose rug.

Choose wisely. Many options are cooked to order; that appealed to me. And many of the items were easy to label as super fresh due to massively high turn over.

The staff behind the barriers as well as those continuously removing used plates were not only friendly, but efficient, and several made a point of providing brand spanking new portions if anyone&#39;s lower lip quivered in sadness; IE. the super great cinnamon bread pudding.

My meal was tasty and hot; and my salad was fresh. Though I didn&#39;t venture off to far in buffet-land, I was able to discover some awesome garlic and herb biscuits that melted in my mouth. The dessert section was interesting; they have quite a few sugar free options (look for that blue handled serving spoon), as well as a fountain of chocolate.

The appeal here is no doubt for families; and the place was packed. Kudos to the serving staff, but maybe it is literally too tough to corral the hygiene factor when feeding the hungry masses.

First thing that they did was assign us a server - what do we need a server at a buffet for?

The server assigned to our table did not refill our drinks once, I had to get up and go over to the cashier to ask for a refill (which he made me wait 5 minutes to get).

Steak and a chocolate fountain, what more can you ask for! Although in the ads, the buffet looks amazing; the actual quality of the food is quite average. If you go during peak times be prepared to line up the in the &#34;corral&#34; for seating. You are greeted with large grills with large sirloin or flank steak upon entering the buffet. Along the side if the custom seafood station where you can get &#34;crab cakes&#34; (mostly filling with small piece of crab meat), shrimp scampi with noodles, or white fish. The fish is not bad, but your typical white fish cooked by skillet with seasoning. The steak is notably tough and resembles large flank steak that have been marinated to soften the roughness of the meat. Scattered throughout the buffet is multiple food items including yeast rolls (amazing with the honey butter), veggies (corn, carrots, etc.), asian stir fry, salad bar, ribs, pizza, etc. There is slightly larger selection than Old Country. Wrapping up your meal the chocolate fountain with rice crispies, marshmallow, macaroons, and pineapple was a real treat. The soft serve was below Mcd quality. Overall the place is clean compared to other Golden Corral. Wait staff is hard working and the table was always cleared of dirty plates.

The service here is TERRIBLE.  I was pushed more than once by a staff member because I was &#34;in the way&#34;.. Our server [why do we need servers for a buffet?] refilled our drinks ONCE while my family and I were there.. even though we were there for a good hour and a half.

They do have a good assortment of food, but my taco meat had at least 3 hairs in it.

golden-corral-elgin,Hyo L.,7IYFbqWkm-_VBH4dkfFqQw,yocZtbCFtkYMSNV2i5T0HA,"Wow, THE WORST BUFFET EXPERIENCE  EVER!! 
I enjoy going to a buffet, whether it&#39;s a Chinese or American. 
But this one, Golden Corral in Elgin, I feel bad for giving even a one star to this restaurant.

All of the staff members there were Mexicans. 
This means several things.
1. The owner is very concerned about saving costs
2. The food quality would most likely be sacrificed. (In my opinion, Mexicans have work ethics in general. However, they aren&#39;t necessarily a good cook for sure.)

This was my first time eating at Golden Corral, and I had some sort of expectation because I heard that they have good food.

Totally not. 

I walked in to the restaurant yesterday, (Friday), around 12:30 p.m.

The restaurant was huge but there were only several groups of people. I thought the whole large dining area was reserved for a party or something, but NO. I just sat there by myself.

None of the food I tried tasted fresh and good. 

The french fries were not crispy but soggy. (How can you mess French Fries?? Come on...)
The pasta noodle was also soggy. 
Mac and Cheese, ehh. Whatever. 
Burger Slider, the bread and meat was tough, and tasted like it was made like an hour ago.
Lettuce was turning red, which means it&#39;s not fresh.

And you call those trash-looking foods(They call it Sweet and Sour pork, Almond Chicken, etc) Asian Food? God, you should be ashamed. 

I&#39;m an Asian who spent 20 years living in South Korea, and I know what I&#39;m talking about. 
The Almond Chicken was salty and tasted like nothing. 
Sweet and Sour pork, the way the pork was fried just looked gross. 
All of the Asian foods tasted like they were made several hours ago. Not warm enough either.
Some cheap sloppy Chinese buffet near my house didn&#39;t even cook Asian food the way Golden Corral(at this location) did. 

It was nice to have an option of &#34;Asian&#34; food I guess, but I was expecting maybe somewhere close to Panda Express, which isn&#39;t necessarily a good Asian food restaurant. 

Finally, for those of you who left good or positive reviews here, you SHOULD BE ashamed too.

The food was terrible, and I&#39;m not even sure they use some crappy out dated ingredients or so.

I literally finished my eating in 10 minutes. 

If I go to a buffet I usually grab 5~7 plates. (I&#39;m a huge eater).

But the foods at this restaurant just made me feel gross and want to get out of there asap.

Left a tip just because the Spanish speaking server was very nice.

I don&#39;t know guys. I&#39;m not picky about buffet at all. And maybe just this location sucks. 

Anyway, I won&#39;t go back to this location for sure, and I won&#39;t recommend this location to anyone at all.

Messy, out of some dishes, other dishes picked over to the point where you would be smart not to touch them, some dishes dried out, and ... some dishes in their prime, so pick those out carefully.

Latest review: Very good! Went when they switched from the breakfast menu to the lunch menu, so everything was fresh and clean. Still &#34;buffet-food&#34; menu items, but some fresher cooked options too.

Tried, for example, the fresh-cooked scallops. They were on the small side for my tastes (love those gargantuan ones!) and I told the chef I&#39;d take &#39;em now please, he would have overcooked them had I not.

I suggest, if you have the choice, waiting a half-hour after they switch menus, as it takes time to replace some items and you&#39;ll miss out on them if you get there right when they switch menus. On the other hand, I grabbed some corned beef hash from the breakfast menu, so that can go either way.

Everyone was very friendly, and they cleaned the plates and tables quickly.

I&#39;d say for the price, it&#39;s a deal. I got a huge salad to start and that alone can cost the price of entry if you go to a place that specializes in salads.

And yes, I pigged out.

Grilled steak - very good. Cooked to order, good flavor. A little grizzly and chewy, but overall very good.
Rotisserie and BBQ and fried chicken - overcooked and overcooked and overcooked. No good option here.
BBQ pork - very good, although pretty fatty
Salad bar items  - pretty good and fresh
Vegetables - good selection, with beans, okra, Brussels sprouts and others. Overcooked in most Cases. Mashed potatoes looked pretty nasty, so no one tried it.
Taco bar - ok, meat rather tasteless.
Breads - good selection, but the garlic cheese rolls did not come close to challenging red lobster.
Dessert bar -  excellent. Many items, and pretty tasty. They even had a chocolate fountain with pretty good chocolate. 
Overall, stick with the salads and desserts. The steak was good, but not high quality.

So I decided to go yesterday it was a major disappointment.  Some things were OK but most were not. Fried chicken was frozen cooked and seemed aged.  I had cauliflower that tasted like fish.  Ate only two bites.  I had spinach that was so bad I thought I would be sick on the spot.  They have lees choices than before and it is obvious they are trying to cut cost by using  cheap food products that are poorly prepared.  I predict this restaurant will either go out of business or someone will get very sick.

I have been to one, maybe two other buffet restaurants in the past 20 years. My experience has been that the food was mediocre at best and the ambiance was rather stark. However, I found myself at the Golden Corral for a young relative&#39;s weekday birthday lunch (it is her favorite place), and it was not bad for what it is. There is a very broad selection of dishes with nods to various ethnic origins. The salad bar is commendable, with lovely mesclun greens and spinach among the choices. The steam tables were well maintained and the food attractive. Everything I sampled was satisfactory, if too salty for my taste -- nothing was cooked to death, and most dishes had some hint of appropriate seasoning. The dcor is warmer than I expected, the place was clean, the staff friendly and helpful. All in all, they do a good job of running an all-you-can-eat buffet with decent food.

So the place is set up like a regular buffet (pay first and then sit down or get seated and then get your food).  The only difference here compared to most is that you have to pay separate for your drink.  So for dinner it was around $10.50 plus another $1.75 or so for a drink.  I didn&#39;t really understand that too much but whatever.  You then get seated if it is busy or seat yourself, at this time you wait for your server, yeah...server, to bring you your silverware and plates.  And anytime after this, you have to ask them for refills and more plates, which again, I didn&#39;t like too much because, especially on the Thursday, the service was lacking and we would have to wait a while for the server to even come back to our table to give us fresh plates!  Big downer!  But about the food...it is kind of set up like a casino buffet with stations, if you will.  They had a very large selection with everything from pot roast and mashed potatoes to tacos and Asian style foods!  I really can&#39;t complain about the food, except for that Thursday when they weren&#39;t refilling the items so when you would go up, the things that were empty on your first trip were still empty!  Another big downer!  But this was not the case on that Friday night...they could not refill everything enough!!

Hubby ordered off the lunch menu Pad Thai and enjoyed it. We both liked the soup and crab Rangoon appetizer that came with the meal. 

The only disappointment for me was my entree. There really were not many lunch items that did not include green peppers or were flagged as hot so I ordered one of my favorite dishes which is pad siew (sic) off the regular menu. I asked if they fried the tofu and they do but offered not to fry it for me. My tofu was ice cold. I think it could have at least been heated but not fried. Plus, it did not have the traditional flavor that pad siew does. It was very salty, loads of soy sauce is my guess and it had to be made with jar garlic instead of fresh. Every time I got a piece of it in my mouth it was so bitter that it was unpleasant.

You&#39;ll find at least half a large onion in each dish which doesn&#39;t allow much room for the actual dish itself.  Portions here are small to begin with.

Their Tom Yum soup had a great kick to it with a great mix of cilantro, straw mushrooms, &amp; tofu...not too spicy &amp; just sour enough. Beef salad (nam tok)wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had (see Rosded review). Beef was hard to chew and could have used a touch more heat, lime, and fish sauce.

No more.

Over the years the portions have shrunk.
Over the years there has been less and less meat in the portions, more and more filler...onions, water chestnuts, thin sauce etc.
Over the years the staff has stayed nice in store, but the ownership has changed hands and it&#39;s been for the worse. (see the response to a customer from March of 2013 below...)

Yesterday I bought lunch for us and guests visiting my home. They come from out of country and always look forward to the food from Thai Town.

Our food came and looked like lunch portions. They were that small. I remember when this place opened, two entrees and my husband and I couldn&#39;t finish it all!

The curry looked like SOUP. SOUP I tell you...maybe 5 pieces of meat in the whole dish.

Then I called to check that we did NOT get lunch portions. The first woman who answered the phone apparently was not aware that she worked at the restaurant and said she&#39;d have the owner call me back. Fine.

Then he called back. And I can tell you that he is as rude as in the post below. He was rude from the moment I picked up the phone. He was abrupt. And he told me he didn&#39;t care if he had my business.

thai-town-south-elgin,Dorothy P.,#NAME?,tlHHFm4AGNYO1VtvMaG0Dg,"Thai food, when done right is flavorful and fresh, a perfect balance of texture and spices (sweet, sour, bitter, spicy).  I wish I could say that Thai Town delivers that and then some, but they just don&#39;t.

Tucked away in the long strip mall in South Elgin off Randall Rd. and Silver Glen, amid the Targets and Caputos of the world, lies Thai Town.  A cute little, cheerily decorated (in bright orange) locally owned Thai food establishment.  Their menu is pretty standard American Thai food (pad thai, wonton soup, fried rice, Thai iced tea, etc).

We dropped in on our way to the Paramount Theater for the latest show, &#34;The Music Man,&#34; in order to fill up on delicious Thai food.  There was only 1 other table occupied in the restaurant when we got there, and by the time we left there were 2 others as well as a handful of takeout orders that had been picked up.

Prices are typical suburban Thai food prices at about $10+ for an entree or noodle dish.  You won&#39;t find any city type mind blowingly cheap dishes on this menu, which is a little bit of a bummer.

The staff is quite friendly &amp; took turns refilling our water any time it was less than half full (quite optimistic, I guess), which was much appreciated.  Our server came over with a big smile on her face to take our order, equally appreciated.  Our soups came out pretty quickly, and they were piping hot and smelled divine.  

My soup (tom yum) was just ok, not the best I&#39;ve ever had.  There were a lot of vegetables in it (I asked for no meat), including a generous portion of onion.  I wish that the broth had been more spicy and sour; it was sort of weak as is.  My hungrier half&#39;s wonton soup was &#34;really good,&#34; a high compliment since this guy thrives on wonton soup.  Our matching entrees (chicken pad Thai) arrived before we finished the soup, but they were molten hot, so I didn&#39;t mind letting it sit for a minute.  The portions were a bit small, more like a lunch sized portion than a dinner portion as compared to the countless other pad Thai dishes I have under my belt, but it was still plenty, leaving me with a snack-sized leftover pile.  The food itself wasn&#39;t very memorable.  The noodles were overdone to the point that they were short from being stirred in the sauce in the kitchen, and it wasn&#39;t served with a lime wedge, which is pretty standard in any other restaurant I&#39;ve been to.  The hot sauce that we were given was WAY watered down too, resulting in me having to essentially douse the pad Thai in order to taste any heat.

The best part of the whole experience for me was in the bathroom.  Their sink is probably one of the coolest sinks I&#39;ve ever seen.  It&#39;s a leaf shaped raised bowl sink in a beautiful gradient of red to yellow...SO COOL.

But I digress...The bill for 2 people (water to drink, wonton soup, tom yum soup, and 2 chicken pad thai) was $36, which I think is a bit high for &#34;meh&#34; food.  With Thai Village just up the road, I think we&#39;ll pass on Thai Town the next time we&#39;re looking for a Thai place to dine.",27/01/13,387,2,2,5,40,6.9371,3.483,0.868,22.649,No,3095

I love Thai food and there were a lot of options on the menu that sounded good, but I decided to try something I haven&#39;t had before: Panang Noodles.  It was wonderful!  Very thick, soft noodles with vegetables and a yummy panang curry sauce.  My friend had Pad Thai with chicken, which she said was very good too.  The portion sizes weren&#39;t too huge but we were too full for dessert.  Prices for entrees seemed to be in the $9 to $13 range (average).

This place has everything to offer from spectacular food to warm &amp; friendly service.  The dining room is really nice --- clean and comfortable.  We started with some Thai Ice Tea --- these are a MUST ORDER if you have never had them.  Sweet, refreshing, and kind of unusual.  For an appetizer, we went straightforward and tried the steamed dumplings.  Sounds boring?  Give them a try.  The dough used to make the dumpling is thinner layer than your typical dumpling.  You get 8 or 9 dumplings in a single order and the sauce is fantastic.  Not only that, the presentation will exceed any order of dumplings on the planet.  Two thumbs up on the dumplings.  We then ordered one of the daily specials --- Scallops in Garlic Sauce and an order of the Pad Thai with Chicken.  Again, Thai Town&#39;s presentation is phenomenal!  The flavors were spot-on, the food was hot, and ultimately was DELICIOUS!  The ONLY thing I would comment on would be size of portion --- but, we definitely felt satisfied.  At the last minute, we decided to order dessert --- Fried Bananas with Coconut Ice Cream with whipped cream &amp; chocolate sauce.  This was the PERFECT compliment to an outstanding dining experience.  And, all of that was less than $50 for two.  Great restaurant!

My girlfriend and I eat a lot of Thai food because eats easy to get a wide range of vegetarian options for her. This place was really yummy. I had some Schezwan style Chicken and noodles with a side of Jasmin rice... it was superb AND it happened to be one of the Lunch Specials so it was cheap too, only 6.95 for 2 stomach fulls of food. My girlfriend had the Green Curry with tofu which she loved as well. I had a taste of it and it was quite good.

The staff was nice and we got plenty of attention seeing as it was pretty desolate on a Thursday afternoon. The decor was ok, various pictures and paintings against a purple painted room. Plenty of tables and chairs. I don&#39;t live close enough to be going there for take-out often, which is a shame because I liked the food as much as Akina&#39;s in Elgin, but it&#39;s a little bit cheaper at Thai Town. My girlfriend remarked that the tofu at Akina&#39;s was slightly better though.

Granted, I only turned 21 this year so I suppose I only actually started caring about where one can get a decent drink recently, but gosh I&#39;m glad I found Bigby&#39;s! Addison doesn&#39;t exactly have a reputation for having anything decent but I&#39;m starting to beg to differ! (See Elio&#39;s, Freddo&#39;s, Zaza&#39;s, etc) Bigby&#39;s has an incredible beer selection, one of which you&#39;re more likely to know fewer beers on the list than you know and taps that rotate daily. If you want to drink pee on tap (aka Bud, Busch, Pabst, etc) or even many macro brews, this isn&#39;t the place for you. Though Bigby&#39;s is definitely mostly a beer place, they do also serve various wines including wine flights for $13. The prices of beers vary. Food is pizza and tapas, though I have yet to get any food here.
The staff is very knowledgeable about what they serve, so ask away if you have questions! They can sometimes come across as cold, which can be off setting, but don&#39;t let that put you out. The clientele is dominantly young adults (and a bit hipster) but, likewise, don&#39;t let that stop you from coming in! The volume isn&#39;t generally loud, there are only 2 TVs (awesome), it&#39;s comfortable and casual in appearance, tables, couches, patio or bar for seating.

I will note, you sometimes see reviews complaining that they don&#39;t serve hard alcohol and don&#39;t have enough TVs-- well spotted, this isn&#39;t a sports bar and they don&#39;t advertise as such so stop complaining.

The night we stopped in they were playing a trivia game.  It was slow-paced and even though they were calling out stages of the game, it was unobtrusive and a fun aside for non-participants.  

They offer some food...tapas, some pizzas...  We tried the charcuterie platter (good snack for 4 but better for 2) and a small cheese pizza (okay).  Also available are a whole lot of board games.  Hankering for a brutal round of the Game of Life?  This is the place!

There is a patio but it doesn&#39;t seem put to good use.  That&#39;s a shame.  I&#39;m all about the patios if the weather is at all tolerable.

We walked in on a Monday night around 9PM and there were very few seats to be had in the house. We scavenged what we could until a few more people had drifted out and finally managed to muster up two tables and enough chairs to accommodate us. I couldn&#39;t begin to tell you all the beers that were ordered, but I can tell you that the whole group enjoyed them as well as the Muddy Pig that we ordered - a chocolate and bacon dessert that hits the spot. 

We opted to play Headbanz, which is one of thirty some games that they have there for patrons to use and enjoy.

I like the selection of board games; it makes the place feel like a local coffee house. I showed up for a Yelp event and we were treated great. The staff, Frankie and Joel, was knowledgeable with their beer recommendations. I drank a Metropolitan lager and a smoked wheat on draft and both tasted great.

For a pub, the food was very impressive. The spicy bacon pizza was really outstanding. The tomato sauce is flavorful with a good kick of heat. The 4-cheese pizza was ok, I would have preferred it with sauce though. And the appetizer with the flatbread and sauce with the goat cheese is not to be missed. I don&#39;t even care for goat cheese, but this app was tremendous. It was like an upscale creamy pizza sauce. The triangular-shaped bread was well seasoned with Italian herbs and came out warm.

It&#39;s a &#39;bar&#39; in the sense that they serve alcohol, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just beer &amp; wine, no hard liquor or cocktails.  Aside from that, there&#39;s very little separating it from looking and feeling like someone&#39;s basement or a decked-out garage with TV&#39;s and hightop tables.

There&#39;s a shelf full of board games, comfy sofas, a fishtank with 1 fish in it, a wall covered with bottle caps.......overall, it&#39;s a very eclectic assortment of junk that fills the space, and it kinda works?  I&#39;m still on the fence about whether or not the atmosphere is cozy or just too weird.

Drinking environment aside, the only thing that surpasses their number of wall decorations is their brew selection.  I honestly had a difficult time finding something on their beer menu that sounded even remotely familiar, so I finally settled on a white IPA.  Dozens of snazzy beer taps (including a shotgun one--cool!) are displayed above their crowded bar countertop, and some are pretty amusing/unusual.

Because this place is in Addison (read: not at ALL close to either my work, my apartment, or my parent&#39;s home), I don&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll be coming back here anytime soon.  A modest pour of Moscato was $8; yesterday I picked up an entire bottle of Moscato at the local Trader Joe&#39;s for the same price, so I&#39;m having a hard time justifying charging that much for a single glass.

The beer&#39;s not not cheap, but it ain&#39;t no tall boy of Bud Light, either......the least expensive beer I saw was a 9oz for $5, and, unlike the majority of bars on a Wednesday night, they didn&#39;t have any featured specials on ANY night of the week.  So that further discourages me from returning......

I don&#39;t know.  This place might be some people&#39;s cup of tea, but it wasn&#39;t at all what I expected, and that caught me off-guard.  Call me frat-tastic if you want, but I&#39;m all about the noisy pubs with lots of room and daily drink deals.  And what&#39;s the sitsh with that fish in solitary isolation?  Why is he all alone?  Was he put there on fish probation for poor fish behavior?  Did he eat the rest of his tank buddies?  I might never find out.",10/07/14,251,3,2,0,22,-0.03639999999999988,1.021,1.569,17.41,No,2288

Everything I tried on tap was good. And I sampled a bottled cider from the massive wall o&#39; choices too. 

I didn&#39;t feel intimidated not knowing a lot about beer, like how you feel at most bars. And the atmosphere was comfortable, with a nice beer garden outside to head to when it got a bit stuffy inside.

Amazing Service
Amazing Selection 
and
Amazing Crowd

The main reason I went out that far is because &#34;Yelp&#39;s on Tap!&#34; had it listed. Normally I don&#39;t take a long drive 40+ miles to grab a beer or 3 but, this place got so many rave reviews that I had to check it out. 

The place has a nice &#34;Home Bar&#34; feel, and you can immediately spot the lucky people that are considered Regulars. Everyone is very friendly and quick to chat you up. The bartenders are knowledgeable on each local brew which changes weekly. I must say, I&#39;m a fan of the IPA selections. 

I ordered the Hawaiian Pizza - it was amazing! The ham to pineapple ratio was perfect. The crust was very flavorful and had a phenomenal crunch and texture. I asked for a to-go box, barely used it though. It was THAT good. I really should have gotten a second pizza to-go.

The patio area is where we smokers have refuge, it&#39;s well lit, has nice clean outdoor tables. If you let the bar tender know you plan on sitting outside they WILL come out and check on you, you&#39;re not forgotten or ignored. 

In the corner I spied board games like Jenga and what I thought was Pictionary. I&#39;m sure if it wasn&#39;t Trivia Night (Wednesday) those would have been used to their full potential and fun would be had by all!

I had 3 beers, and a pizza total bill was just over $25 - not bad at all!

I have been hearing about this place for what seems like forever, and I finally got off of my lazy butt and went. I fell in love the minute I walked in. It&#39;s a small place (I hear it gets crowded on the weekends), with a small beer garden outside. The decor is very eclectic and perfect for someone with a short attention span - there is something to look at everywhere! They also have board games, a few TV&#39;s, and some guitars laying around. Someone told me they host trivia night as well.

First off, when you walk in, their menu is on the wall...as in a wall of beers. They do have a chalk board with their beers on tap and wine selection, but my favorite has to be the beer wall. There are beers on a lazy susan that they do not have at the time, but you can vote to bring them back by putting in a glass pebble in the beer of your choice! How cool! That&#39;s something I&#39;ve never seen before. The customers choose the menu!

I ordered the Hitachino White Ale, and it was awesome. Kind of like a Blue Moon, only without the orange. The staff definitely knows their beers! There&#39;s something for everyone here, and they will help you find it! Not sure what to get? Have them surprise you or recommend something. Still not sure? Ask for a sample! I was really impressed with their knowledge!

As for the food, it&#39;s not just your typical bar food here. Their soft pretzels with cheese spread are just as amazing as I thought they would be, along with their flat breads. The menu is small, but the food tastes great, comes out fast, and really fills you up. There&#39;s really no need for anything more!

This is my new favorite bar. Mama loves, Mama will be back!",09/08/13,199,5,2,5,23,7.6098,5.593,1.305,21.102,No,1731

After an amazing Yelp Elite event, I stopped by here with some fellow Yelpers to check it out, get a drink, and play a game. It was definitely crowded. We barely had room to move around and stood for a half hour before some people left, leaving a table empty near the piano. We quickly grabbed the table and hung out, playing a game. Games + friends + beer = my kind of night.

I am very surprised that a unique spot like this exists in the mundane suburbs. It&#39;s something I&#39;d expect to find in Wicker Park (Chicago), not Addison, IL. Couches, dim lighting, indie crowd (mixed in with some non-indie people), a wall of board games, a piano, a small bar, and endless signs and decor.

I&#39;m in love with their &#39;menu&#39;: a large display of empty beer and wine bottles at the entrance. The separation of beer and wine (beer stuff on the left, wine on the right) was cute. Because I was so overwhelmed with all the beer choices (it takes a long time for me to make a decision), I didn&#39;t know where to start and ended up ordering The Poet. I&#39;ve seen it before and wanted to try it (I&#39;m a huge fan of Edgar Allan Poe and it caught my eye) but I didn&#39;t pay attention to what kind of beer it was until I got it -- dark and heavy, not my style. I should have tried the banana bread beer. Maybe next time, if I&#39;m willing to make the drive out again and deal with the crowd.

I want to give this place four and a half stars, actually. The beer is expensive (one beer can be the price of an entire six-pack at the store), and the parking lot is really small. We ended up parking near some houses in the neighborhood. But, since 4.5 stars isn&#39;t an option, it gets five.

I&#39;ve been back a few times now and have enjoyed each and every visit. 
Beer selections are phenomenal and there&#39;s a wine for each major grape and a bit more.  I love that even though you may not be too knowledgeable about craft beer, if you want to try something new, just let one of the knowledgeable servers know your likes and tastes and they will have some suggestions for you.  I love fruity beers and ciders and there is always a new one I&#39;m checking out when I visit. 

The food is super tasty, just enough light bites to keep one satisfied.  The spicy bacon flatbread pizza is phenomenal--there&#39;s Siracha in the sauce!  The other flatbread pizza I recently tried had a yummy chorizo.  

This spot gets busy on weekends.  Seats around the bar and at high top tables.  There&#39;s also a cozy couch to laze about.   Boardgames are available if you want to get competitive with your beer/wine mates and Trivia Wednesdays are super popular too.

This is the place to go for the true beer &amp; wine snobs. They have a large variety of beers to choose from both on tap and bottled. The cool thing about this place is that the beer is chosen by the people! When you walk in you are able to take a marble and put it into a beer you would like them to carry. There is a similar process when a keg is tapped. The place itself though is very small and becomes very crowded quickly, so try to go during off-peak hours or expect to wait. 
The food is super simple but very well done. The pizzas are cooked to perfection every time and the flavor profiles are unique. What I really appreciate is the staff. Everyone is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. 
A good tip, if you are newer to trying crafts and are not sure what type of brew your pallet enjoys ask for tasters. No one wants to order a $10 beer and not enjoy it.

We must have been here on an off night or must not be the normal customers. The other reviews sounded like they were describing a different experience with their servers. We walked in on a Thursday evening and were not greeted or welcomed for quite a while. We were unclear about what the beer selection was and how things worked. Eventually we walked to a table and someone greeted us. (Later we saw people greeted and given a &#34;tour&#34; right when they walked in.) We asked questions about the beer bottles that were on display when you walk in and she told us that one section is what is currently available. They also have a list of beers on tap/draft that is on a chalkboard on the wall. 

I&#39;m a novice beer drinker and wanted to learn a little more. All the reviews described this as a place where they enjoy engaging in conversation, teaching you about the different beers and helping you select something you would like. I felt like our server was not interested in describing things to us and I felt like I was annoying even though I tried to be brief and friendly. The rest of the time just felt a little uncomfortable and awkward which was disappointing to me since we had been looking forward to this for a long time and I wanted my family to have a good experience. She didn&#39;t come back and ask us how we liked what we were drinking which also seemed surprising.

I ended up having the Blanche de Bruxelles beer which I did really like. My dad enjoyed the Zombie Dust and my husband had the bottled Breckenridge Vanilla Port which he liked and then the Sixpoint 3 Beans which he did not love. 

We ordered the pretzels which we thought were excellent- they came with a cream cheese-ish beer flavored sauce. We also had the Hawaiian Pizza which was delicious. We had to try the Muddy Pig which I thought would be my favorite but it was very messy and just not as good as I had hoped, though it&#39;s unique, looked great and it&#39;s fun to be able to say we tried it. 

The bar itself is cool and quirky as others have described. The shelves with bottles and the bottlecap walls are neat and the board games are a nice touch.

I have been wanting to stop by this place since I started a new job in Schaumburg one year ago and it is on my commute home, however everlasting construction on Lake Street has kept me away.  To mark my one year anniversary, I said &#39;eff it&#39; and decided to check it out last Friday.  

It was about a twenty minute drive from Schaumburg in rush hour traffic, which wasn&#39;t bad, but it took another twenty, twenty-five minutes to get off the ramp and onto Lake Street.  I&#39;m hoping that the guys doing this work in Addison get their stuff in gear and get this project finished soon, because I can&#39;t wait to go back to Bigby&#39;s.  

If you look around at other reviews, they might tell you that Bigby&#39;s is a little hard to find, but they clearly have a sign on the side of their building as well as one in front by the road that they share with the restaurant that they share the building with.  It was not hard to find at all.  

When I finally got there through all of the lousy road construction, about an hour after I left work, I feared that I would be too late to get a good spot at the bar and would be left standing around awkwardly.  Those fears were squashed when I walked in to find ample seating at the bar and around the room.  

I grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a brew, Bigby&#39;s Rye P.A., a pale ale brewed for Bigby&#39;s by Two Brothers Brewing Company in Warrenville.  I have been a fan of 2Bros for several years, and while I am not a huge fan of rye in my brew, it was not very over powering in this one and did not disappoint.  I had been keeping an eye on another selection on their Beer Menus page all week, but their taps rotate frequently, and that one was gone.  

As I sipped on my selection, I couldn&#39;t stop looking at the dcor:  a giant chalk board beer menu on the wall, growlers lining the bar, guitars on the wall, board games, couches, a beer cap covered door, and horizontal wood boards that made the space look like a bungalow on a beach somewhere.  This is what I would like my garage to eventually look like.  There was literally so much I could not take it all in.   

While I would not be eating anything on this visit, they do serve food, and I took some time to peruse the menu.  They have some good looking bar apps, sandwiches, and pizzas.  The spicy bacon pizza really stood out to me, and I will be sure to order one on my next visit.  

Intermission:  between beers I used the restroom, which they share with the adjoining restaurant.  It was well lit and clean with smells wafting in from the Italian restaurant, Mario&#39;s

Upon returning, I promptly ordered another beer:  Surly Mild.  This one was delicious, an English style sessionable ale with dark roasted malty goodness and a toasted biscuit aroma.  But this isn&#39;t untapped, so back to Bigby&#39;s!  I had some conversation with a few people around the bar and a couple ordering beers as well.  They had been here before and were ordering small samples before they settled on a full glass, which is good to know.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and helpful and not pretentious in any way, which is also very good when you come to a place like this.  

Ultimately, this place is fantastic, and I will be returning in the future.  I agree with other reviewers when they say it is a hidden gem.  I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t get too crowded early on and was nice and chill, but I was told that business does indeed pick up considerably as the night wears on.  I can&#39;t wait for the work on Lake Street to be done so I can return here in the future with great ease!

1) Amazing patrons and Friendly staff.  What I&#39;m about to write will give you a good sense of the place......  As soon as our massive Jenga tower toppled over, all I hear is an uproarious &#34;JENGAAA!!!&#34; from literally entire bar.

Like the island on the hit TV series &#34;Lost,&#34; Bigby&#39;s is the sort of place that can only be found by those who have been there. And possibly mathematician cartographers. Unlike the Island on &#34;Lost,&#34; it is not going anywhere and it&#39;s a super inviting place to visit. It might be a little hard to find at first, but if you like beer, wine, or just a happy place to hang out, this place is a big win.

I have found that many places that serve craft beer are maybe a little like wine bars in that they can be pricey and a little pretentious, but Bigby&#39;s is wonderfully relaxing and down to earth. &#34;Want to try a great beer? Cool. Try this.&#34; It&#39;s like someone took an awesome local bar from Orange County, and dropped it, inexplicably, behind an Italian restaurant in Addison IL. It&#39;s a nice change of pace, especially if all you&#39;re used to is loud sports bars. It&#39;s cool, low key, and a great place to hang out with friends or bring a date. 

Bigby&#39;s serves some interesting wines and a wide variety of craft beers (bottle or draft) that rotates all the time- and from what I have heard, patrons help select what&#39;s next in rotation. Bartenders are smart and approachable and are great at giving suggestions that really pay off. Beer is served in an appropriate glass- sometimes really crazy glassware- for the best possible drinking experience. There is also a nice but limited menu if you want to stay for a while and you get hungry. Everything is reasonably priced.

If you&#39;re looking to get into craft beer, hang someplace nice before going to a movie, or want to go to a bar where you can talk, unwind, and enjoy some light food, I can&#39;t think of a better place that deserves your business more. Remember, you just have to find it first.",27/12/13,214,5,2,5,25,8.355099999999998,4.58,0.487,13.932,No,1835

I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t try anything on tap because I don&#39;t know what to try.  I had a pear cider, and damn it was good.  I also tried the spicy bacon pizza and the muddy pig (chocolate and bacon flatbread).  Both items were delicious, I would definitely order them again.  Food costs about $10-12 here, and while the menu is limited, the options available are more than sufficient.

I was impressed by the beer list though.  I may have only been able to identify names like &#34;Emmet&#39;s&#34; and &#34;Goose Island,&#34; but with 10+ available, and a wall of bottled beers, you&#39;re just inconsolable if you can&#39;t find something to suit your tastes.

This is a small and unassuming bar on the west side of Lake Street.  I don&#39;t know why I was expecting something big and classy looking.  I love the interior of this place - it&#39;s a little bit &#34;Cheers&#34; and a little bit &#34;Central Perk.&#34;  There are plenty of tables, many of which were occupied on a Tuesday night, as well as a bar with seating and a few sofas.  Sofas?!  Hell yes!  The decor is fun without being trite and cheesy, there&#39;s an aquarium alongside one table if you want to mellow out and watch the fish.  There are also two TVs if you want to catch a game. 

I wouldn&#39;t go with more than a group of 4-6 if you expect to get a table on a Friday or Saturday night.  Table seating IS limited, and I&#39;m guessing even more so on the weekends.

Cool variety of board games too, and there&#39;s a Wii.  If your friends can&#39;t keep you occupied, then something else here certainly can.

Addison is lucky to have Bigby&#39;s as a neighborhood bar.  But it&#39;s also well worth the trek from the southwest suburbs.",05/12/12,213,5,1,5,-4,5.4727,4.333,1.376,19.291000000000004,No,1888

We didn&#39;t even get a chance to taste the food. I walked in with my 22 year old son and my 19 year old. If there are signs on the establishment that say &#34;21 or older only&#34;, we did not see them on the way in and we could not find any on the way out.

bigbys-pour-house-addison,Jennifer P.,bDXSrl19qIe0Hb-cZcCJ5A,H3DMQOngMdiaBpsSQxR-7g,"Wow, this is a really cool place.

I was meeting someone here (HE had suggested F+H or Shiraz, but thanks to my Yelp fam, saw Bigby&#39;s was a much better choice and I made the call.)  Before he arrived I planted myself at the bar and sort of tried to figure out what I was supposed to do.  Thankfully the bartender (who I later learned is the owner) explained the Bigby&#39;s Way to me.  I chose their house rye for starters.  A few other patrons nearby also made some suggestions (very top of the shelf all the way to the right) which came in handy as the night progressed.  It was nice to be in a place where people are friendly and don&#39;t make you feel less for being a n00b.

Later in the night, the owner came by again and illustrated the beer-rating system (beer bottles + marbles) to us.  Horray for interactive fun!  Now, I&#39;m not a beer connoisseur by any means, so I only recognized maybe 2 beers.  Everything I tried was delish.  My companion and I probably had 8 beers between us.  He ordered some Belgium beer which ended up being $10 of our total tab of $48. 

The atmosphere is low-key and feels like your friend&#39;s house/basement bar (complete with ugly couches with ill-fitting/sliding slip-covers).  They had some live music (a guy playing the piano/singing).  The idea is good, but it was LOUD and made it really difficult to have a conversation without being 6&#34; away from whomever you&#39;re talking with. 

I&#39;m looking forward to going back, though!  Score!",06/12/12,172,5,1,3,-25,2.9142,2.222,0.372,15.406000000000002,No,1497

I don&#39;t even know how it happened considering I lived about 5 minutes away for the last year. No matter, as I have finally made it to the motherland and it&#39;s everything I&#39;ve ever wanted in my life.

It&#39;s a pretty small space which is definitely noticeable on a Friday night. You probably have to come somewhat early to get a table or a couch but if you don&#39;t mind standing, then you&#39;ll be fine. At the entrance are shelves of beer bottles on one side and wine bottles on the other. One side of the shelf has all the beers they have available at the moment. The other shelf has a bunch of beers that they could get. All you have to do is put a pebble in a beer bottle and depending on how full it gets means that will be the next beer they feature. It&#39;s pretty neat getting to vote for a beer because if enough people want it, you&#39;ll get it. That&#39;s customer service right there.

They also have a bunch of stuff on tap, all of which are written on a giant chalkboard across the room. The decor is neat. The walls are plastered with bottle caps, beer cases, and taps hanging over the bar. The first time I came here was on a Thursday night. One of the bartenders came over to us and explained how everything works and showed us around a little bit. I thought that was really helpful and I appreciated getting the lowdown. The beers, of course, are amazing. If you don&#39;t know what something will taste like, just ask and they&#39;ll describe it to you and compare it to something else, or bring you a sample. 

Bigby&#39;s is totally chill and void of bros and pretentious snobs. My friends and I played the board game Life while drinking beer and another time, my boyfriend and I had an intense game of Chess. What&#39;s better than drinking and playing some board games? Nothing. It&#39;s everything I want to do on a weeknight/weekend.

They don&#39;t offer much food but what they do have is great. The pizza smells delicious but I went for the muddy pig which is flatbread with chocolate and bacon. Hells yes! Just the right amount of salty and sweet. It was perfect. They also tell you which menu items go best with wine or beer, which is helpful.

I hope to make trips to Bigby&#39;s weekly because it&#39;s absolutely the perfect setting for me. Oh and it&#39;s a bar that you can actually talk to your friends in and hear them! Wins all around.",27/12/12,260,5,2,5,23,9.7908,6.856000000000001,0.524,25.618999999999996,No,2452

Bigby&#39;s is not quite as close as it used to be, but it&#39;s completely worth the longer drive (just make sure your driver is sober, please!).

I came back recently for an unofficial yelp gathering and was pleasantly astonished when Ed, the awesomesauce owner, knew my name. It was my third visit. In two-plus years. Apparently, saying nice things about a fantastic bar is a good way to be remembered.

On this particular visit, I quaffed two beers I had never tried before (the super-light Two Brothers Pahoehoe* and the super-dark Three Floyds Moloko), noshed on some pizzas (thanks for sharing, ladies!) and had great conversation and a great time.

It was a Saturday night and there were only 2 people serving the busy bar and floor but they were quick and efficient and very friendly. Both gave great suggestions and I ended up ordering a beer flight while my wife chose the wine flight. The list of beers are staggering and I simply told the bartender I was overwhelmed and would like him to choose for me after telling him my preferences. Same for my wife. We were both happy with the variety we received as well as portion.

They only have craft beer and wine so if you&#39;re looking for cheap PBR beer specials then don&#39;t bother. If you didn&#39;t know so many beers existed outside of the MIller/Anheuser Busch world and are willing to try beer that actually tastes like something then this is the spot to get your taste on. The bartender is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Just give him a vague idea of what you like and he can whip up a sample that is sure to please you with variety within your preferences. 

After 15 minutes of sipping, we worked up the munchies so they suggested we try the melted goat cheese as a tasty nibbler that is easily shared. Melted goat cheese in marinara sauce served with bite sized wedges of toasted, seasoned pita bread sent us both to taste bud heaven. It really was the perfect combination with our drinks. I knew it was good when we finished the dish and I wanted to order another one.

Don&#39;t you hate places that play obnoxiously loud music so that you have to scream at people just to be heard? Me too and Bigby&#39;s does a fine job of keeping the volume to the perfect level so that you can still hear it above the din but it&#39;s not intrusive. Lighting is slightly dim and comfortable seating, such as couches, are available for a perfect evening of kicking back and enjoying life without some straight billed hat and Affliction shirt wearing d-bag screaming jager bombs next to you. People here are mature but not necessarily old. Just plain comfortable is the best way to explain the ambiance here.

Thanks to Cristie B. and Jelena Z. for the reviews that led me to this great find! I&#39;ll be making a trip back here as often as possible.",15/04/12,228,5,3,5,63,8.325800000000001,4.145999999999999,1.1390000000000002,16.715,No,2262

Ambience:  The moment you walk in, you see a wall of beers on the left, and wall of wines on the right.  These are for you, the customer!  How it works is that you take the pebbles in front of you and drop them in the bottles to help them determine what to bring onto their menu... so whether it&#39;s something you want to try, or something you know you love... Bigby is trying to make it a place you would love to hang out in more.  The decor is very laid back, and a perfect place for a 3rd date on, or to catch the game on one of their many TV&#39;s.  Board games galore, some with &#34;extra&#34; instructions (have you ever played drinking Candyland?) , a cool place to hang out!

Drinks:  Lots of choices in terms of beer and wine.  Seriously, the selection is HUGE for such a small bar.  Very cool.

Food:  We focused on flatbreads and different pizzas, and they were all pretty tasty!  The key ones that I would suggest are:
1.  Spicy bacon pizza.  Bacon of course, but the sriracha played nicely with the ingredients and surprisingly served as a great base!  My wife doesn&#39;t like sriracha, and still loved this pizza.  Worth trying!

2.  Prosciutto asiago flat bread.  It was quite tasty.

3.  SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  The Muddy Pig is spectacular and worth saving room for... a flat bread with crisped bacon and chocolate sounds strange, but the sweet and salty combination is exquisite.  I would go back, just for this dish.  Seriously.

4.  Hawaiian pizza:  Strangely enough, they do something with the hawaiian pizza here that really makes it work... was it the beers I was drinking?  I don&#39;t think so, but it may have been.

I loved everything about Bigby&#39;s!  I am not a bar girl, but even while sitting at the bar, it doesn&#39;t feel like a bar. I guess that&#39;s because it&#39;s a &#39;pour house&#39;. I wasn&#39;t guessing there would be much of a difference, but things are heightened across the board here. Everything I look at when I visit a business was elevated to another level here and it&#39;s not your average &#39;anything&#39; when you walk in the door. 

Service. Stellar. Ed is the host with the most. Even when the place was hopping at 9pm, he kept up with it like a pro. And he&#39;s so personable that you can&#39;t help but want to give him your business. He&#39;s addictive. :-)

Cleanliness. Even the bathroom (shared with Mario&#39;s) is kept neat &amp; tidy. 

Atmosphere. Early in the evening, it was very low key with only a handful of guests. Before I knew it, it was wall to wall with adults sipping on a tasty beverages and socializing. No stumbling drunks here. We played cards at the bar and had a blast!

Food and drinks. Not only am I not a bar girl, but I am also not a beer girl. I sipped on Vander Mill&#39;s Apple Blueberry Cider beer throughout the night. It was right up my alley. It was the perfect suggestion for a girl like me. Spicy Pig...Muddy Pug:  don&#39;t pass up either. That would be foolish and you would regret it. Share a Spicy Pig. Don&#39;t hesitate to order a Muddy Pig alone later. Eat a couple slices there while it&#39;s hot.

The #1 thing I like about this place is they&#39;re really customer focused, from the voting for beers with marbles in the front entrance to the board games and Wii it&#39;s clear they want you to come in, have a seat with friends, enjoy some good beer, and eat some fresh food.  You get the feeling that customer suggestions here are really implemented, and that keeps things fresh and exciting.  

This place obviously caters to those that love craft beer and HOPS, however on our recent trip to BigBy&#39;s our friend was not so much into them, Ed (the owner) explained a few different styles of beers and offered several samples  to our friend who ultimately was sold on Hobgoblin and proceeded to order a few more.  Point being you don&#39;t have to be a beer snob to enjoy this place, however respect for a quality product has to be observed by all whom enter.   Places like this are good for the craft beer industry and hopefully we converted our friend from the standard beers that the vast majority of the population drinks.  

While I don&#39;t think they have a functional website they do update their menu on a website (http://www.beermenus.com/places/1196-bigby-s-pour-house).  

As for food they have access to Mario&#39;s deli so that means fresh ingredients!  The style of food is defiantly small plate oriented which works perfect for a place like this.  They have a few different Pizza&#39;s and flatbreads which I can only comment on 1 the &#34;Latin Lovers&#34; Pizza which is actually a chorizo pizza with cilantro.  It really paired well with the beers!

If you&#39;ve never been there before, I recommend visiting during an off time so that the staff can explain the system they have going in the vestibule. I was confused by which beers were available and which were just on display and ended up feeling kind of stupid by asking for beers they didn&#39;t actually serve. They were really nice about it, though, and it wasn&#39;t really a big deal.

bigbys-pour-house-addison,Ericka A.,To0GTLW5MGZwOg5TxxZIQA,e_JMZgas3dJk0cYK-viE6Q,"AMERICA! F*** YEA!

You know why America is great? Because &#39;merica has REAL women. Real women drink full-bodied beer and don&#39;t worry about the calories. Real women also eat an entire Cheese Platter (with minimal help from two of their guy friends). And this real woman has found the place that will most likely ruin her 5K career. 

Bigby&#39;s, you&#39;re gonna make me fat again. But at least I&#39;ll go out in style and die a death by deliciousness.

The first time I came here I don&#39;t think they were open. The outside made it seem very much like an upscale French or Italian-inspired wine bar. My date and I decided to go somewhere else. Suburban watering holes with craft beer and good wine selections are notoriously overpriced. The tasteful patio and limited signage makes it seem like one of those boutiques with only 10 items in the store and you just *know* each item is going to cost your entire paycheck. I&#39;m glad the Suburban Beer Appreciation Society challenged my preconceived notion and gave me an excuse to see what Bigby&#39;s is all about.

In the true spirit of America, Bigby&#39;s is all about Democracy. Not only do they showcase American beers and highlight some good European ones, but they support the local breweries and serve only the finest examples of what our great country has to offer. God bless the Midwest Grain Belt! And it&#39;s all a numbers game for the 312, 630, 847 and everyone else. Don&#39;t believe me? They have a voting system in place for future beer offerings. You drop a pebble into your favorite bottle or something you want to try and they tally up the stones to figure out what they will order next. It&#39;s as easy as beer 101, Two Brothers, 3 Floyds.

I started the night out with a Daisy Cutter Pale Ale by Half Acre. It was a little bitter with a flowery aroma. Then I tried Two Brothers&#39; Ebel Weiss. I liked them well enough, but the Pere Jacques by Goose Island (lovingly called Prairie Jocks by Mike N. and I) really stood out. It reminded me of my beloved Sam Adams&#39; Cranberry Lambic, only all grown up and filled out. The best way I can describe it is as a very sweet and strong first sip and a smooth banana-berry finish.

Feeling very adult with my new found love of local libations and liberty and justice for all, I decided to go hard or go home with an entire Cheese Platter. The thing was massive and well worth the $11. The Brie was the only cheese on there I was on the fence about, but I loved everything else from the crackers to the apple and green grape garnishes. I know I&#39;ve received maybe 1/4 of what they dished out at other wine bars for the same price.

So do it. Go to Bigby&#39;s. Live large. Do not count the calories. Just say yes. Say yes to deliciousness and all that is holy in a world filled with Cheese Whiz and Bud Lite. Vote for real beer and fine wines. Support a local gem and Democracy. Don&#39;t let the terrorists win!",22/07/11,344,5,3,5,62,10.4786,7.029999999999999,1.156,33.81400000000001,No,2945

First things first, Bigby&#39;s is kind of hard to see from the street.  No biggie for the regulars, but for urban folk venturing out into unknown territory it&#39;s a good heads up.

So while I loved everything about how cute Bigby&#39;s interior is set-up, the long list of craft beers and lovely wine selection I can&#39;t help but be slightly miffed at ZERO liquor selection.

There are so many beers to choose from!  Even if you aren&#39;t a die-hard beer fan, the crew can usually recommend one that you&#39;ll find delicious.  I tried an apricot and a pear beer this trip.  Both had the fruit essence, but weren&#39;t overly sweet.  I only wish I could remember what they were called.

We tried 2 pizzas...the Spicy Bacon and the Latin Lovers.  Both were so good, I could barely get enough.  The Spicy bacon was my favorite, but I&#39;d do the Latin Lovers (complete with delicious chorizo) any day of the week!

There are boardgames available to play while you drink and munch on pizza.  Love it!

Shortly after coming here for my birthday, I had to bring another friend here because I knew she would love it.  She did!  Now, she&#39;s been back a couple times herself.

We have tried quite a few other pizza places and wanted to try something new. We searched places around our hotel and, out of the nearby places, this place stood out on Yelp and other travel/review sites. I&#39;m back in Springfield now, am happily eating the leftovers, and figured I&#39;d better tell everyone else how good it is. 

The pizza: we had the stuffed pizza with sausage + mushroom. The sauce is very well seasoned, the cheese is amazing, and we really liked the bread-like crust. It was a good change from dense crusts or cornmeal-based crusts. 

The salad: it was really good. Romaine lettuce, eggs, carrots, radishes, and red peppers went well together. Everything was crisp and fresh. Home run here!
 
The dessert: As much as we liked the pizza, we were equally pleased with dessert.  Banana cream pie for me and carrot cake for my wife. Wowsers - they were fantastic! The banana cream pie was very flavorful from top (whipped cream + slivered almonds) to the bottom (crust, which was really good). The carrot cake was exceptional. The icing still kept a little tang from the cream cheese - something a lot of folks don&#39;t get right. 

The staff: being carry-out only, there were no tables or wait staff. We had a really good chat with the two employees while we waited for the pizza to be done. They were super-friendly and genuinely happy. 

The kitchen: I normally try to get a glance of the establishment&#39;s kitchen to get an idea of cleanliness. The only thing I saw on the floors and counter tops was....some flour. You can&#39;t help but get flour everywhere in a pizza place, but the floors, make tables, counters, etc... were all very clean!!!

We all fight over the outside pieces! The sauce is very tasty and has a homemade fresh taste to it. They are always generous with the cheese and other toppings.

gianorios-pizza-winfield,Dave M.,YyEnUbSO2_CItp09C2druw,7HGd7zox2MCVstNbSB1WQA,I was really excited because of all the reviews being so high. Ordered a regular crust half mushroom half sausage easy sauce. I thought that the sausage was of high quality and the mushrooms no problem there...however...light sauce should be for the whole pizza not just sections of it. Bit into a piece of mushroom and sauce spilled out upon my bite. I&#39;m just not a fan of a lot of sauce and it should have been made properly. I also wasn&#39;t a fan of the amount of cheese on my pizza. Seemed light for the amount of money pizzas sell for here. Maybe I&#39;ll give them another shot in the future but to me it&#39;s not 5 stars.

gianorios-pizza-winfield,Noomi J.,rr6MSytEzTwMYtkYRwDrlw,Ke914B3ty3kTbHDPYVw7wA,"3 of my yelp friends had posted stellar reviews for this tiny, carry-out only, suburban pizza joint (*waves to Joe, Peter, and Pat* xD). So when I was hit with an undeniable pizza craving a few days ago, I turned to Gianorio&#39;s.

I called in and ordered the 12&#34; stuffed cheese ($14.50 for the 9&#34; cheese, $18.50 for 12&#34;). It takes about 50 mins to prepare. When I came in to pick up my order, I was promptly helped with friendly service by the young man at the counter. I remembered that I had to try their carrot cake, so I selected that, along with their banana cream pie. Both were generous portions that could easily feed 2-3 people. The total came to $30. When I physically picked up the pizza, I was impressed by its hefty weight haha.

Now onto the pizza. For me, the flavorful sauce &amp; cheese really elevated the pizza into awesome stratus. When I took my first bite, I was transported into my happy place. I may even have closed my eyes and made a few onomatopoeic sounds of appreciation lol. The sauce at first seemed sweet, but no, my tastebuds were tricked; it was more tangy than sweet. Perfect texture to the sauce too, thick and not overly chunky or runny. And of course the cheese was excellent, not bland at all. 

I was impressed that there weren&#39;t greasy pools leaking from the pizza considering the huge amounts of cheese that Gianorio&#39;s stuffed uses. Also, I was glad to note that the crust wasn&#39;t soggy, one of my pet peeves, though I&#39;m lenient if it&#39;s leftover pizza. I noted a slight smokiness at times when biting into the crust, which I enjoyed. And even though I started out ravenous, I couldn&#39;t finish one slice, so big kudos! :D

Of the two desserts, I loved the carrot cake. It was the richest carrot cake that I&#39;ve ever tried, especially with that satisfyingly thick layer of luscious cream cheese frosting. I liked how the frosting wasn&#39;t overly sweet either. This cake was perfect &amp; moist, and I honestly can&#39;t think of how it could be better. The banana cream pie was good, in particular, the buttery thick crust, but I can make better so I&#39;ll pass on this next time.

EDIT June 2013 - Even after trying pizzas in Italy, I still think Gianorio&#39;s has some of the best sauce &amp; cheese I&#39;ve tasted. After returning to the US, I ordered a small stuffed ($14.50 for 9&#34;) and small sausage double dough. The stuffed was spot-on, but the double dough was too much bread for me. I wanted more sauce/toppings. The sausage was okay. I like White Cottage Pizzeria&#39;s sausage better. Next time, I plan on trying their thin pizza ;)",09/03/13,324,5,3,5,72,13.123300000000002,6.545,0.41000000000000003,25.044999999999995,No,2631

gianorios-pizza-winfield,Pat E.,AFCSE7BT3FGle35em1WWVw,gxLHwREyHwMetVaIIujjNQ,"If you&#39;re looking for an amazing pizza in the western suburbs (Winfeld, Wheaton, Carol Stream, or West Chicago). I now live in central Illinois, but any time it is the weekend (I have my big meals on the weekend), I am in the area, and I am craving pure euphoria/nirvana (pretty sure that doesn&#39;t make sense, but not much of what I write does), I head to Gianorio&#39;s of Winfeld. There is also a location in Lombard (which I have not tried) and there is a Gianorio family deli that is open for lunch M-F down the road. This review focuses on my one and only located at the corner of Geneva and County Farm!

Anyway, I have had Gianorio&#39;s before, but it was a few years back, and I thought it was great, but it wasn&#39;t really by choice.

A friend had it, and we got the standard sausage and pepperoni, regular crust. That was back in high school when my parents used to pay for pizza on the weekends. Now, I am grown up, with a bank account that dwindles because of my frequent Yelp excursions. 

I am now ready to drive and carry out wherever I please, not a slave to my fathers&#39; coupon obsession (even though he never gets a good deal). Plus he eats dinner at about 430 pm everyday, and washes it down with a Busch Light, stay classy, daddy-o! 

.I get the whole early dinner thing if you wake up early, but I feel like dinner should be a reward for a job well done or a hard day at work. That&#39;s the way I look at it. I guess that&#39;s why I love food.

Anyways, in the words of a terribly named legume band (Black Eyed Peas) &#34;I gotta feeling, that tonight&#39;s&#39; gonna be a good night...&#34; Well, weird black guy who has his voice digitized for that song, you were right, every night with Gianorio&#39;s Pizza gon&#39; be a go-ood night. My goodness this pizza makes me want to get up and dance like Justin Timberlake. Don&#39;t even need a suit and tie to eat it (yay pop culture).

Consistency is key, and Yelp usually doesn&#39;t let me down. There are three keys to a good pie, no matter what type you order: thin, regular, double dough, pan, deep dish, or stuffed. 

Yes there is a difference between the latter two. Please do not offend my pizza sensibilities by not recognizing that. I get so upset. My psychiatrist and psychologist tell me not to get upset over things I can&#39;t control. Like pizza novices, but I digress. It doesn&#39;t matter if you prefer cracker thin crust, pan style, or stuffed...

The three things I look for that must be outstanding no matter what are they are crust, sauce and cheese.  


Gianorio&#39;s stuffed cheese and double dough are my favorites. I&#39;ve also had the standard thin, pan, and calzones. I even took a frozen pizza down to my home in Paxton, but let&#39;s be honest. There is nothing like getting a pizza from Angie on a Friday or Saturday night. Her mom is usually there too. The high school students, recent college grads, and working women in the kitchen/oven area give this place charm. They&#39;re all covered in flour and sweeping up usually when I pick up. I would give them all high fives because what they give me is pure bliss via marinara sauce.

If you have room for dessert (I usually save it for the next night), I highly recommend the carrot cake. It&#39;s the best carrot cake I have ever had. They also have coconut creme and banana creme pie, brownies, lemon tarts, chocolate cake, and cupcakes! It&#39;s like finding $10 in your pocket when you wash your jeans...an awesome occurrence! 

Will I be back? Is the sky blue? Is Barack Obama a black man? Are the Cubs awful? All of these are questions that have obvious answers. Gianorio&#39;s, keep it up. 


My brother and I often reminisce about how different our lives would be without ever finding this place. Sure Lou Malnati&#39;s deep dish is great, Giordano&#39;s stuffed is solid, and Gino&#39;s East Meaty Legend is... legendary. It&#39;s about finding what you love and sticking with it. I am all for trying new things. But when a place like Gianorio&#39;s comes along and is consistent, the staff caring, and the service impeccable it&#39;s really hard to dial a different number on pizza night. I always beat myself up for not finding this gem to order throughout my childhood. I wish I found it sooner, I probably would have won the lotto or something life changing. Not as life changing as when you arrive and the smell of success engulfs your nostrils at Gianorio&#39;s Pizza. If this is what love feels like, then I finally know how to love.

P.S. I know I always go back and forth between stuffed and double dough, but I can&#39;t help it. I think I love one more, but it&#39;s like Grandma Gianorio puts here love and care into both pizzas equally. I am not exaggerating either. My only gripe with this place is that I can&#39;t have it every single meal of every single day. I know that when these small business owners go on vacation and I am in town I panic like Americans did with Sputnik!

gianorios-pizza-winfield,Brian S.,YFnFvVNAiyEbioZ6xLpSkA,jJ1OZXu8MMAaI8J94tPgcA,"Dear Gionarios,

I grew up on Giordanos stuffed spinach pizza ...we had one down the street.  Since then  I&#39;ve dabbled with Nancy&#39;s and Jakes stuffed spinach.  I am sure there was an unremarkable UNOs, Ginos and Malnati&#39;s in there somewhere. Really, none of them hold a candle to the stuffed spinach I got last night ...at Gianorios.  Chicagoans say that they hate stuffed pizza, but bring out-of-towners out to experience the treat.  Huh?  Yeah thin crust, flatbread and artisan pizzas are awesome, but nothing can take the place of a stuffed spinach pizza ...it&#39;s the real &#34;pizza pie&#34;

Troubling thing, is that I have driven past this place 2,00 times over the last 15 years, and never gave it a second thought.  Unfortunately, the whole mall has always been run-down looking, hidden behind other stores and has poor signage.  I even did a dry run an hour before pick up, because I was not sure where this place was.

How was I to know the best stuffed pizza ever resides here??

I digress ...

I typically do not write a review after only one visit, but here it is:

Ordered 12&#34; stuffed spinach ...and sorry, I got sausage on it too:

The spinach stood out, and had great flavor
The sausage had that tasty pop of flavor, that you want
The sauce was amazing, truly the benchmark from which all other sauces should be measured
The crust? Crispy where you want, gooey where you want and there was a tasty char on it
Cheese ...well duh whats not to love about cheese?

My pizza was stuffed and I ate it until I was stuffed, with pizza.  No clue what double dough is or how their thin crust measures up to what I am used to ...but I will let you know!

gianorios-pizza-winfield,Bailey H.,9Vr6EnUdEIvprvqmgXcGlQ,HsNNlyKpvOb_Nonwd5zGgQ,"Absolutely. Incredible. Freaking. Pizza. Tonight was my first time trying Gianorio&#39;s Pizza with the fam. We usually head to Rosati&#39;s, Nancy&#39;s, or Lou&#39;s. I am definitely a pizza connoisseur. I&#39;ve had pizza from everywhere...the East Coast, NY, hole in the wall places in Chicago, Uno&#39;s, Nancy&#39;s, Jakes, Giordano&#39;s, everywhere. 

I read the outstanding reviews about this place and we decided to give it a shot. Let me preface this by saying, it takes a lot for me to give a place five stars. I am a pretty harsh critic, particularly when it comes to sizing up the quality of a pie. I&#39;m a pizza skeptic. 

So many things go into my consideration of a good pizza. Crust, sauce, cheese, toppings. Not to mention service and freshness. Gianorio&#39;s Pizza excelled in all these areas. We got a regular (thin crust) pizza with black olives, onions, and green peppers. The crust was a tad thicker than most thin crusts, but absolutely wonderful with just the right density and crunch, baked perfectly. The sauce was savory and tasty, with herbs and spices. The cheese was also sprinkled with herbs and there was plenty of it, cheese, that is. The toppings were plentiful, no scarcity, and the pizza was cooked to perfection and was hot and fresh. 

The service was also great, even though they were super busy. This is one thing I will say some other places in the area lack. They were prompt, efficient, and friendly. No mistakes and the pizza was ready right when they said it would be. 

We will definitely be coming here for our weekend pizza ritual from now on. The pizza is truly heaven on earth, can&#39;t wait to order from here again!

Based on other yelpers, we tried Gianorios. It is fantastic! Just like other reviewers have said, Grandma literally works in the kitchen, she was making pizza dough the day we picked up the pizza.

And oh, the pizza. It&#39;s wonderful. High quality toppings (we had a 6-topping combo, and a sausage/pineapple/garlic pizza, and a sausage/pepperoni), the sauce is sweet and not too acidic, and the crust is great. Just all around awesome pizza, first place we&#39;ve found that we like better than Gino&#39;s East.

And man, you really really have to get the Carrot cake, we will stop by after school now just to pick up some dessert.

Grew up in the city with Gino&#39;s, Uno&#39;s, Home Run Inn, Giordano&#39;s, etc.  Have had pizza from every little place in the Western Suburbs and this place is hands down the best.

i have had it for several of my parties and now people from 25 miles away come out here to pick up this pizza.  I discovered this place when they first opened in 1988 and I had just moved about a mile away and have been going back ever since.  

In 24 years of pizza, every pizza has been fantastic.  And believe me, that is alot of pizza to get right. 

A couple of weeks ago, had a taste testing party against Al&#39;s Pizza in Warrenville.  Their pizza was really good, but Gianorio&#39;s was the unequivocal winner.

Keep up the Good Work Guys.  Also, love, love, love the Pepper and Egg sandwiches at the Downtown Deli.  Put them on the menu for every Friday.

I love ramen, and have been spoiled with Santouka at Mitsuaw growing up. While I love this place, I still find Santouka&#39;s flavors to be better. 

I tried the miso ramen yesterday, which is always what I get at Santouka. I liked this ramen a lot, however I wished there were a couple slices of pork; I only received one slice of pork which had a lot of fat on it, which was nice for flavor but I just would&#39;ve liked a little more pork. I might be spoiled with the 3 slices I get from Santouka&#39;s miso! The broth is excellent and the egg perfectly soft boiled.

I came here with my family (there were 4 of us) on a Thursday night around 7pm. The restaurant itself isn&#39;t that big, so there was a bit of a wait. About 15 minutes later, our buzzer went off and we got seated right away. 

We took a look at the menu while we were waiting, so our server was able to take our orders right away. Our food arrived no more than 10 minutes. I ordered the Taiwan-Ramen since I wanted something spicy, my sister and dad ordered the famous Tonkatsu ramen, and my mom ordered the one with seafood (can&#39;t remember the name). We ordered the chicken wings as well. 

The broth was SO good, and the quality of the noodles was probably my favorite part. You can tell that they were fresh noodles, not the dry ones that need to be rehydrated. Also, the soups were served at the perfect temperature: hot, but not piping hot. 

Taiwan-Ramen: According to reviews, this is supposed to be SUPER spicy. I have a pretty high tolerance to spicy foods, so it wasn&#39;t THAT spicy to me, but it was still very good! Noticed it was very heavy on the ground pork and bean sprouts, and didn&#39;t come with that much noodles. The broth was very savory and had a nice kick. 

Tonkatsu Ramen: The hype is real! The broth is very savory and you can really taste the pork in the broth-- yum! This one had a generous amount of noodles but the pork slices were OK. I would definitely order this for the next time I&#39;m there 

Seafood Ramen (forgot the name): It was good; definitely a lot lighter than the other two. Had lots of toppings and was probably the least salty out of the three. 

Fried Chicken: SO good! The pieces look like they&#39;re dry rubbed with seasonings, but it actually it lightly glazed with a sweet, but savory, sauce. It wasn&#39;t drenched in sauce (which is my pet peeve unless it&#39;s buffalo wings), and it was both crispy and juicy. Would definitely order again next time.

I and husband were lucky only waiting for 15 minutes and got seats at counter around 1:30pm on Saturday. The new party just came in was told that it would be 45 mins!

I got best condition ramen which was spicy and lots of vegetables!! which I love! It is very hard to balance the noodle and vegetables when it comes to ramen, but here it comes! Volume of the ramen was just too much though. 

My husband got Tonkotsu. It was creamy and good. The type of noodle was differed by the soup which is very rare around this area. I can see their passion about ramen. Side; Negi was too spicy and bitter to finish all. 

Overall, I like my best condition ramen, tasty right textured noodle and lots of fresh vegetables! However, $30 for 2 ramen and 1 side was too expensive when considering &#34;ramen house.&#34; I think they should make smaller bowls of ramen and lower the price. 

I personally prefer Daruma Japanese restaurant&#39;s Tonkotsu ramen much better than here because it lacks the sophisticated taste of soup and broth here. Maybe it&#39;s designed for typical American guys. Not enough for foodie Japanese people. I probably come back when it has less waiting time.",17/05/16,148,4,1,5,1,4.3472,3.285,0.487,16.228,No,1259

ramen-house-shinchan-palatine-2,Mike M.,W2zno-nXaGa9Y2Au7L8wNA,jDJ_nDLdAj_Nu5HiKpIeNw,"I&#39;ve gone back a few times since my original review and in all fairness I definitely need to bump up my rating. When I first tried this place, I honestly wasn&#39;t impressed. In fact, it was one of my lowest rated ramen reviews despite getting all the love from that article in the Chicago Tribune. As I said in my first review, I loved the broth, liked the noodles, but hated the unappetizing, grey pieces of pork that came in the tonkotsu. While I still think the pork is lacking in so many ways, the broth is consistently good and I was able to find a few other awesome items on the menu that make me forget about the lackluster slices of pork. 

Taiwan Meat - This was the game changer for me. You can instantly take any of their bowls of ramen to the next level for a mere $2. Highly suggest it. It&#39;s basically a decent size bowl of ground pork and huge cloves of garlic, drowned in some sort of chili oil. For anyone who&#39;s left wanting more after seeing only 1 or 2 strips of meat in their ramen, this is the solution. Plus, it adds an amazing garlicky spice. When you combine the Taiwan meat with the tonkotsu broth...game over dude. When that milky broth turns orange, it&#39;s on. 

Tonkotsu Ramen - See my original review for the details. The broth was creamy, salty, and super porky. The noodles were thin and al dente, and the soft boiled egg was perfect for me: moist and gelatinous, but not completely runny. The cha shu pork was unfortunately bland.

Tebasaki wings - An order came with 5 wings. They weren&#39;t the typical overly sauced, sweet and spicy Asian glazed wings that you see everywhere. Instead, the skin was soft but still with a broiled type texture on the outside. There wasn&#39;t a sauce but rather a salt/pepper looking rub. Really tasty.

Gyoza - Seared nice and crispy on the outside and the inside had juicy meat. Pretty standard.

Karaage - Lightly breaded chicken with a delicious mayo and salt/pepper blend on the side. It wasn&#39;t as crispy as I was expecting but the meat was still very juicy. TIP: I would suggest getting the small because the large costs twice as much but didn&#39;t seem like it had twice the quantity. 

Drinks: Shinchan seems like a business lunch type place. Most people come in to get their ramen fix and are back on their way shortly after. It didn&#39;t seem like a happy hour environment where people just sit around, drink, and get rowdy. Well...that didn&#39;t stop us from trying haha. The only alcoholic drinks they had were Japanese beer, and one type of sake that came in a jar. Sounds like sake bombs to me! A few of these and you&#39;re good to go.

ramen-house-shinchan-palatine-2,Christa F.,VVyIz8Z73MU9RbZA_JoyRA,XQmb3phALo-8kZPCEK6UzQ,"Lately, we&#39;ve been seeking out ramen... The boy got a hankering for it and there aren&#39;t any places near us that offer it. He was unconvinced that I wouldn&#39;t find a place within reasonable distance that would serve us up a good bowl! Challenge accepted! Just 20 minutes away I found this little place that served us the best ramen ever! You should go... Go now!

I ordered the Chapon Ramen which was filled with Egg Noodles in Pork Broth with seafood, pork and vegetables.  This was a combination that the boy frowned at as he&#39;s not into seafood; however, it was absolutely fantastic! The broth was rich and complemented the seafood, scallops and shrimp, better than one would expect! The boy tried it, sans seafood, and admitted it was quite tasty! And I had leftovers for 2 days of lunch!

The boy ordered the Miso Ramen which had Egg Noodles in a Miso-based Pork broth with braised Pork, soft-boiled Egg and Vegetables. The miso went nicely with the tender pork and veggies. The boy only likes certain veggies, so I ended up with some of them! The egg was delish and I ordered one for myself!

For sides and apps we ordered...

Gyoza which is a Pork and Vegetable Dumpling. These were better than any pork dumplings we&#39;ve gotten at a takeout place! The wrapping was thin and well-cooked instead of thick and weird. The meat inside was well seasoned and tasty!

Fried Rice with Egg, Scallions, chopped Pork and Fish Cake. This was really good fried rice especially compare to what we&#39;ve gotten via takeout! No added sauces needed! Well done!

We&#39;ll definitely be back! Their staff was super friendly and attentive! Even the other patrons were nice and understanding that they get so busy!",28/07/16,207,5,3,5,64,6.851699999999999,5.415999999999999,0.8140000000000001,18.770000000000003,No,1717

I ordered my favorite Tonkatsu ramen and a large order of friend chicken. Both are very good and Japanese style. The authentic ramen broth can be a little bit on the salty side and it was. I appreciate it because it tasted very thick and flavorful. The noodles were cooked just right as well. I would definitely plan to go back and try other dishes. 
I heard about the long wait in the weekends and I would say i won&#39;t wait for more than one hour for it though. It&#39;s a pretty small place maybe with up up 50 seats. Service is good as well.",27/02/16,66,5,1,4,10,3.4111,2.356,0.0,7.644,No,606
ramen-house-shinchan-palatine-2,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,dOJ3Puz4oVXONGW6M9ePKw,"Many of my friends and co-workers are big ramen fans, so I&#39;ve spent a considerable amount of effort trying out many of the top ramen places in Chicago (Strings, Ramen Misoya, Santouka, Sozai Banzai, etc.). I had heard many great things about Ramen House Shinchan before coming here and had actually visited several times before I actually ate here this last visit. Previously, I would go relatively early for lunch but end up going elsewhere due to the long wait to get a seat. This time, I got there 20 minutes before they opened and fortunately was able to be seated soon after opening time (the line to get in at opening was about equal to the total number of seats available in the restaurant).

Overall, I had high expectations for the food from what I heard from others. My actual experience was pretty good -- the food was enjoyable, not mind blowing in terms of flavor or creativity -- but it was prepared well, colorful, served quickly, and had simple flavors. I wish the non-ramen dishes could&#39;ve been prepared better and that there could&#39;ve been more depth of flavor in each component of the ramen though. Here were my thoughts on the items I tried.

Chahan - A bit on the salty side, really lacking in flavor from the scallions and a very small hint of egg flavor (which I think is almost essential to any fried rice). The pork was also a bit tough and the fish cake barely added any flavor. Nice contrast of textures but wasn&#39;t a fan of the flavors.

Tebasaki - Enjoyable chicken wings with nice tender meat. A bit strong on the seasonings though as you&#39;ll get a good kick of sweetness and saltiness at the same time with a strong kick of pepper while you taste soy sauce and rice wine adding a bit of flavor depth. 

Kara-age - Chicken was tender and juicy but I wish the batter had been fried a bit more. 

Shio Ramen - The egg noodle is a bit more firm than what many may expect, but that&#39;s normal for this type of noodle. The soft boiled egg is done very well and does mix well with the braised pork which is soft, tender, and just slightly salty. The clear chicken broth does feel healthy but really is a bit light on flavor. The additional of a few additional components such as seaweed or seafood could&#39;ve added much greater flavor to the broth.

Chanpon Ramen - Fish cake, pork, and vegetables in a creamy pork broth with medium firmness noodle. This tastes pretty similar to the seafood noodle soup preparations you&#39;ll find in finer Chinese and Korean noodle restaurants. The cabbage did bring out a good amount of sweetness but I wish that the shrimp was a little larger and that the vegetable mix was a bit more premium. 

Tonkotsu Ramen - This seems to be the dish that everyone raves about. It does have a nice flavorful broth with soft egg noodles and braised pork that is very tender (but could really use additional seasonings). The entire dish does have a creamy feel to it with very strong themes of pork bone and meat. I wasn&#39;t blown away by it however -- as the only component that differentiated this ramen from others was the quality of the broth. There is still room for improvement to really elevate this to a special-trip worthy bowl.

Overall, the food is enjoyable but really not worth a special trip if you don&#39;t already live in the suburbs and have to wait a long time for a seat.",10/01/16,384,4,2,5,35,8.4786,3.6089999999999995,0.481,22.91,No,3362

The place is tiny, so not a lot of room for waiting around. At one point my friends and I were standing outside in the cold since it was too crowded inside. One of the Japanese servers there does not know English very well - I took it as a sign of authenticity. 

I had the Miso Ramen. The broth is just ok...was disappointed a little bit cuz there wasn&#39;t a strong miso taste. But the slice of pork that I had was very good, same with the egg. 

I had a taste of the Tonkatsu ramen. It was so good that I wish i had gotten that. The broth was very flavorful. Definitely worth trying the next time. My friend also ordered the fried chicken for our table to share. Oh my! It was very good. It was so juicy that some of it squirted out when I took my first bite. The meat was very well seasoned.

It has a similar setup as Reman Misoya in Mount Prospect - located in a rundown strip mall with not many seating inside. It was packed and a couple of parties were waiting - a good sign. I got seated right away because I was just by myself. 

I had the Tonkotsu ramen. The portion was just right. I liked the simple toppings they had - mung bean sprout,  a soft boiled egg, green onion and the meat (unlike the corn, potato wedges and the other stuff Ramen Misoya added to the their noodle, which I don&#39;t really care for). The first couple spoonful of the broth had me wowed. The noodle was so fresh and was just so good. The disappointment came from the piece of pork. It&#39;s a bit on the tough side, not tender as I&#39;d expected. Then the more I ate, it became saltier to the taste. The egg was flavored as well, which was not bad but added more saltiness to the dish. I so wished I could empty the bowl because all the other rich flavors were there, but I couldn&#39;t.

It could be just me though, as I usually perfer dishes easy on salt. The elder Japanese lady patron next to me had the same thing as mine and she finished the  whole thing. 

So overall, it&#39;s good ramen. Service was great as well. But my most favorite ramen so far is still Santouka in Mitsuwa. Anyway, I would come back to try the other noodle dishes next time when I&#39;m in the area.",30/09/16,171,4,3,5,57,4.638199999999999,3.292,0.666,16.04,No,1514

It had a really nice pork flavor to the broth and was perfectly seasoned, not overly salty. The noodles were fine but nothing out of the ordinary. There was one fatty piece of pork which was perfect for my liking and the egg was amazing.

My friend and I also shared the fried chicken which tasted great. it was fried and seasoned just right.

They have a lot to choose from, so I&#39;ll have to come back and try some of their other ramens and dishes (particularly the chicken karaage). 

My boo ordered the tonkotsu ramen, which comes in a rith pork broth, barisedpork belly, a soft boiled egg, scallions and bean sprouts. This is the type of broth and ramen noodles you would look for in tonkotsu ramen. The broth was savory, the noodles were cooked well, and the pork was decent (not the best I&#39;ve had, some are like melt-in-your-mouth sexy goodness). 

I ordered the Best Condition ramen, and the first thing I thought of when it came out was &#34;holy mother of veggies, batman!&#34; Yes, there&#39;s a lot of stir-fried vegetables on top, with plenty of sprouts (my fav) and lots of garlic pieces (probably too much, but it did wonders to the broth flavor).

Like I was reaching in my purse to get my wallet and I made eye contact with a waiter that didn&#39;t even serve us, and 2 seconds later we got our check - quick AF. We went on a thursday night and it was pretty filled. They only had 1 empty table for 2. But even then, people came and when people were done, more people came. Anyways, let&#39;s talk about the food.

Tonkatsu Ramen: according to fellow Yelpers, this was a pretty popular dish. Let&#39;s talk about the ramen itself. There&#39;s a lot. Like a lot of it. I kept eating and it felt like it wasn&#39;t ending. Okay I&#39;m exaggerating but it&#39;s definitely more ramen than all the places I&#39;ve been to. It had a good bite to it, so nicely all dente. The broth wasn&#39;t as rich as I had hope. It&#39;s still rich but I think because they put so much bean sprouts in that it diluted the broth. It wasn&#39;t too salty at first, but when you continue eating it gets saltier. The chashu, the sad sad one piece chashu. It wasn&#39;t a huge piece and there was nothing special about it. It just makes me sad. But I still ate it.

Miso Ramen: you can taste and smell the miso from the broth, but again I feel like the veggies (cabbage and bean sprouts) overpowered the flavor of the miso itself. The ramen is different from the tonkatsu. It&#39;s more yellow and it&#39;s the spiral ones. Personally, I like these better because it &#34;feels&#34; more ramen to me lol but it doesn&#39;t have that chewy bite like the other ramen for the tonkatsu. That doesn&#39;t mean the ramen is overcooked. It had a good texture to each bite. Same, sad one piece of chashu in this one too *sigh*

Fried chicken wing: it had a good crisp to the bite. The seasoning is good, but a bit on the saltier side. But I kept wanting to eat it because the color looks good. It&#39;s like the perfect colored chicken wings sprinkled with black peppers.",04/08/16,221,3,2,5,36,5.516500000000001,4.275,1.778,23.946,No,1959

There were six in our party, and the restaurant is small. Maybe they have ten or twelve tables. Luckily, we only waited about ten minutes before they had a table ready for us. We ordered gyoza to start, these were great - sauted enough to be crisp, yet soft and chewy inside. Tasty.

The service was fast and we received our ramen before we finished the gyoza. I had the Taiwan Ramen, which was spicy with ground pork (lots), green onion and herbs of various kinds. And, man was it spicy. I love spicy foods but know it&#39;s really spicy when my eyes water. And they did.

The only think I found curious was they did not offer hot tea. They offer a variety of soft drinks. They have canned iced tea (?). I stuck with water. While this was disappointing, the food and experience were both good. Had they offered hot tea I think my review would have given them five stars.

If I lived closeby, I would be a regular.  It is my question to try every dish on the menu.  

Totally authentic and easy on the pocket book.   

This place gets busy, so a good idea to arrive just at opening for lunch dn then for dinner as well.   They close midday for break.  

The toppers could be a good idea for more than one person as the size is quite good.   The Scallion topper with meat is lacking in meat but serves as almost like a nice salad to go along with the soup.  

Chicken Karagge is well flavored and crispy.  The single order was good enough to share.

The items on their menu are reasonably priced and delicious. The ramen noodles are perfectly prepared with enough chewiness. The broths are flavorful, yet not too rich. The eggs are soft-boiled well. The meat could use some upgrading, but it isn&#39;t bad. The appetizers are decent as well.

ramen-house-shinchan-palatine-2,Nick B.,7Pzb8u-3fnnSoTvonLuHEA,hDU0RjPGrFr1jBVucdtTzQ,"I waited to review this place till I went a few times. I have to say that consistency is something that the Ramen House has nailed down. While I have only had the Taiwan Ramen it is consistently excellent. I have taken people from work here and all of them enjoyed their various ramens. I even got my wife to try it and she enjoyed it as well. The dumplings here are delicious. If you really like spicy I highly recommend trying the Taiwan Ramen. I also suggest ordering a couple eggs with it as well. They really pair well with the spicy broth. 

The only reason I didn&#39;t give this place 5 stars is due to the price. While I will admit that you do get filled up on an order, I just don&#39;t see how noodles and broth with a little bit of meat can cost $12 with tax. 

This won&#39;t stop me from going back again in the future, but that&#39;s the only bad thing I could really say about this restaurant. 

One thing I want to point out is that this place is tiny. It only holds 35 people so I highly recommend take out. It&#39;s not uncommon to drive by and see a line out the door. 

Best part for me about this place is that it&#39;s open till midnight on the weekends and 11:00 during the week. I hope this place is starting a new trend for all suburban restaurants to follow. Nothing is worse than being hungry late at night and no place is open other than fast food chains. 

I will be going back and I highly recommend giving this place a try.

Update: I now frequent this place about once a week. I have tried nearly every item on the menu. My favorite dishes are the chicken wings, the Taiwan Ramen (with a soft boiled egg) and the best condition ramen. Yes, I do enjoy spicy food, but that&#39;s not why I picked these dishes. I just felt that the flavors were the best in these Ramens. The wings are just delicious. You really owe it to yourself to at least try them. Hell, try everything on the menu.

Their tonkatsu ramen was delicious and not too oily and salty. It had the right amount of flavor without overdoing it. I also tried their wings and they were amazing. Very unique in flavor and made with some sort of &#34;dry rub&#34; to ensure that it&#39;s not too saucy (I don&#39;t care for sauce covered wings). They are probably one of the top wings I have had and will be getting this every time I come back.

ramen-house-shinchan-palatine-2,Lorenzo L.,UEBME1p2U6hOMK8uxY0mUg,bGOh0hggJ7erfXZEnfEBHQ,"Call me a hater, but I always carefully look over Yelper  reviews of ramen joints.  When most people think &#34;ramen&#34;, their limited  experience is with the packages of Top Ramen or Maruchan they buy at the supermarket. You know, those curly extruded dry noodles with a sodium-laden flavoring packet, OK?  The first time they taste &#34;real&#34; ramen, they think they&#39;ve died and gone to heaven.  Not true for this Yelper.  I&#39;ve had ramen out of automated ramen dispensing machines in the Tokyo subway, which taste better than many  of the restaurants &#34;specializing&#34; in ramen in and around Chicago.

I was pleasantly surprised this afternoon with my Tonkatsu Ramen at Ramen House Shinchan. The broth was milky white , subtlety flavored, and served piping hot.  In order to get that consistently, pork bones must simmered low &amp; slow for many hours.  The noodles had what Japanese folks call &#34;mochi-mochi&#34; ( it loosely translates to a &#34;chewy-texture&#34; mouth feel which ensures that the broth sticks to the noodle.)  The garnishes included a nice slice of pork (that was well marbled, but not laden with fat),  a perfectly cooked, creamy yolk, hardboiled egg , and barely crunchy bean spouts.

While slurping at the bar, the guy behind me was served an order of &#34;Tiwan&#34; ramen .  It was garnished with braised ground pork in a red sauce garnished with chives.  I couldn&#39;t resist ordering a side of the meat to taste.   Slap ya mama.  It was a spicy mix of goodness.  The only good thing about winter in Chicago is a warm bowl of something when it&#39;s cold and nasty.  I&#39;ll be heading back to try their chicken-based ramen, and some of the other specials I saw flying by me.",02/10/15,210,4,1,3,-43,2.1222000000000003,2.239,1.043,14.717999999999998,No,1729

I would have given this place 5 stars had it not been the fact that without being able to see all the ingredients that go into the making of my Tonkatsu and Chonpan, that they both have MSG in it. An hour after my meal my mouth felt like the Sahara Dessert. SOO DRY, I drank 3 bottles of water within 30 min. Did not even need to use the bathroom either, I was definitely dehydrated. Also, the fact that some ramens here have cabbage...ehhh I admit not that I claim to be an expert in Japanese food, but I don&#39;t know how cabbage pairs with ramen, at least not my preference. Also I was never given water during my meal here. 

With that said. The braised pork is VERY tender and juicy, I wanted more! It only came with 1 piece of pork on my tonkatsu, no braised pork on my chonpon. I personally liked the tonkatsu better than chonpon. The chonpon looked messed, but tasted good, minus the cabbage. 

The broth, SO VERY rich, in fact so rich I took out my Tonkatsu and the next day when I took it out of the fridge the broth turned from liquid to a solid form. 

The noodle, perfect ramen noodle, no non sense instant noodle type that some Japanese places would try to trick you into. For people who knows their Ramen we all know it needs to have a good amount of bite paired with curliness and just the right amount of thickness. Not too thick not too thin. 

I would have liked a type of ramen with shrimp tampura and a whole piece of fish cake...the chonpon had fish cake in it but all sliced up, you can&#39;t really even taste it.

If you don&#39;t want to wait, come right on the dot when they open. They open at 6PM for dinner, if you come even 30 min later this place will be all seated and you will have to wait. Note that there is a gap in between lunch and dinner where they are not open. Like some reviewers have said, yes the price here is slightly higher, but honestly for the suburbs where ramen places are few and far beyond, they can justify that, as you can clearly see by people lining up the door waiting for it to open. 

Next time I am back I will have to try their fried rice and yakisoba. Definitely worth coming back. A true ramen place owned by Japanese.",11/04/15,266,4,2,5,11,5.8149,3.1610000000000005,0.474,20.363,No,2343

Stopping in for a late night meal (and wanting to see if there was a wait at 9:30 on a Tuesday) I was planning on ordering a nice ramen bowl to satisfy the need. When I got there I started to look at the &#34;Specials&#34; menu that changes up every so often. I spotted one of my favorite things! Well favorite on a Chinese menu... Egg Foo Young, Japanese style!! I was kind of excited to see it and the waitress described it for me. Rice, sauce, and a crab cake on top. Sounds good to me, as I have had egg foo young at every Chinese restaurant I&#39;ve been to and was looking forward to a better rendition for $10... What I got... a super thin, crab flavored, soft patty... made with... wait for it... CRAB STICK!!!!!! Are you serious?! Is this April 1st? At this level of establishment I didn&#39;t even think they would allow something like that in the door!! That&#39;s Jewel California roll level! Such a disappointment to say the least. You basically stir the whole thing up in the sweet sauce and eat it with the spoon they give you. The bottom line is Blah! Thank God I had a large beer and the dumplings to lift my spirits.

You might be saying removing a star is harsh but if they are going to put crap like this on the menu then it wasn&#39;t a 5 star to begin with... It&#39;s like 1/2 of a normal egg foo young patty for $10 and there is nothing in it to make it cost that much! Crab flavored fish stick is CHEAP!

As we dined, business didn&#39;t slow at all and I imagine the wait only grew as more &amp; more people waited.

Service was very friendly and polite, not overly invasive, just the right attentiveness I like when dining.

I went of course expecting to order ramen but ended up ordering the Sara Udon. I meannnnnn, my name is Sarah! How could I not order this dish!? Although not all ingredients were listed, this dish has pork, squid, octopus and shrimp in it. It&#39;s a huge portion with tons of vegetables over crispy noodles with a few udon noodles thrown in for $10.75. It&#39;s not udon in the traditional sense by any means but wow that flavor was great. It&#39;s a whole lot of tasty food for a decent price. My friend has their best condition ramen which again, is not traditional ramen at all but it was oh so delicious and it&#39;s their special recipe.

My friend I dined with is Japanese and she was very happy that the Ramen House was owned and operated by Japanese, plus 90% of the clientele were Japanese. After we left, she was quite excited to take her mama to try it out.

There were a lot of options, but having seafood in a pork broth piqued my interest enough for me to pick it over the others. Since it&#39;s also the most expensive item on the menu, it&#39;s the only thing I ate here.

This bowl of ramen is absolutely enormous. And the broth is as good as I hoped it would be - an almost-creamy, flavorful, very hot pork broth. Great depth to build a bowl of ramen on.

The egg noodles tasted, surprisingly, like eggs, and not like generic slimy starch. The meat and fish were tender, and the vegetables crunchy. A little dusting of chili spice made it complete.

There&#39;s so much to offer in this cozy shop in suburban Palatine IL. Walking inside, you&#39;re instantly greeted with the traditional Japanese nicety &#34;itadakimasu&#34; !!! Right there, you should already know... You&#39;re about to experience something truly wonderful.

If you&#39;re looking at a Ramen place review, you&#39;ve probably heard about how yummy Ramen dishes are. In fact, if you aren&#39;t already on a Ramen kick, this place will get you started. The other known fact is that they are often busy at all times of the day. However, for my first visit there today, we were happily surprised to see only 2 people waiting for a seat.

They have their signature ramen dishes on a walled menu in the waiting area. I think there&#39;s like 9 of them. Then they have a slew of other delicious yummies that I&#39;m going to check off one by one in the near future. Some of those include: Gyoza (Japanese pot stickers), Katsu Kare (pork cutlet with curry sauce), and Yakisoba ... any service member stationed in Japan or Okinawa will know what this is ;) 

After hearing reports from others about the spice factor of a certain dish they had, I didn&#39;t hesitate to order the Taiwan Ramen -- be aware that this one packs a heckuva kick, so much that even Mr Miyagi would bow down to its awesomeness. But it&#39;s not just about the spice factor. My first sip of this immensely flavorful broth transported me to another world. I was slurping and chewing, and didn&#39;t have a care about who was watching or hearing my hot mess. At one point during my heavenly trip, tears were dripping past my eyes -- either the sweat from my brow or a deep appreciation that I have a job right down the street from this place... YES!

Anyways, the Taiwan Ramen is not for the average eater that thinks black pepper is &#34;spicy&#34;. It&#39;s for that muncher that appreciates the exotic combination of spicy hot and crazy good, such as you find in Thai food ;)  But not everything is spicy at Ramen Shinchan. In fact, I&#39;d say there are only a few dishes in their inventory that hit this level of hot. But it was soooooo good.

Don&#39;t wait any longer. Get there. Get a menu. Start checking off items, get on a Ramen kick, and become a repeat customer. My one dish was so filling (and I&#39;m an eater by trade) and cost about $10.82 after tax.

With that said, I had to go check it out. 

Yeah man...bangin! I got the tonkotsu ramen with chashu and medium cooked egg. The broth was super flavorful and the noodles had the chewiness I love in fresh ramen. Chashu was nice and tender. 

My brother got the Taiwanese ramen. Nice and spicy with stir fried sprouts and pork topping. It was pretty awesome too.

Secondly, only a slice of pork in a bowl of ramen?? That&#39;s very stingy of you. The price is definitely too expensive for a slice of pork and the rest are vegetables. Every places that serves ramen gives at least 3 slices of pork!

If you have eaten ramen in other places with generous amount of meat/pork and rich flavor of broth, you know what I&#39;m talking about.

Given the other reviews and the line of people waiting to be seated, I thought that it would be some time before my take-out order was ready- I was somewhat shocked at how quickly it was in my hands and I was on my way.

A couple of notes about the experience:

The day that I visited, they were out of the take out menus. I chose my order from a laminated menu card, but the menu is also on their wall and on their website. It did not appear that all items on the in-store menus were listed on the website however.

I had some difficulty flagging down someone to give my take-out order to, its also a bit confusing figuring out what the waitstaff roles are, and indeed, even if a particular person is a customer or an employee.

A different person brought me my food than took my order and payment- the second person acted somewhat suspicious that I hadn&#39;t paid, and unfortunately I had told the person that took my payment that I didn&#39;t need a receipt. I felt a bit uncomfortable as I didn&#39;t want them to think that I was cheating them.

Notes about the food:

You do get a large portion but as previously mentioned, it is a bit pricey with all things considered. I ordered the Best Condition Ramen and it had a distinctly pepper finish, but overall was very tasty. The Miso Ramen that we ordered was a bit bland but it came to life after adding a bit of soy sauce.

I certainly would suggest doing take out if you can because of the other reviewers comments and my experience that getting seated can be somewhat of a challenge.",23/07/15,151,4,1,0,-20,-0.45430000000000015,0.384,0.6479999999999999,10.968,No,1577

A friend and I arrived around 8pm on a frigid Chicago Saturday. I&#39;ve heard very good reviews being the top 10 ramen in Chicago and needed that stick to your bones broth. It has table or bar seating you find at typical Japanese ramen joints, so be advised there will be a short wait. They have a normal menu along with a couple chalkboards highlighting some of their other specials. Neat, but I came for that tonkotsu ramen and kara-age because I was starving. 

I opted for extra cha-shyu in my bowl and came with a total of 5 pieces: makes me wonder how many pieces the normal bowl comes with. The broth was good and could taste the long simmering of the pork bones, but was missing a key element from make it amazing. As another reviewer said, I too had &#34;soup skin&#34; and wasn&#39;t piping hot as others have stated. For suburbs standards, I thought it was good and would come back; probably one of the better in the northwest suburbs. The noodles were slight past al dente and had good texture and the medium boiled egg (miso flavored) was spot on except being a little cold. I noticed at the end of my bowl that the broth tasted like scallion soup. Where did that pork broth go?? I would&#39;ve drank the broth but couldn&#39;t handle that much scallion soup. The (small order) kara-age was very juicy from them using chicken thighs. The dip options were Japanese mayo or salt &amp; pepper: nothing fancy and could&#39;ve been a bit crispier. 

My friend had the Best Condition Ramen and asked for extra spicy. The spiciness over-powered all the flavors (I&#39;ll put the blame on his part) and reminded me of jjampong (spicy Korean noodle soup). He also ordered the miso-katsu, and although the pork was fried well, the miso sauce was too salty for my taste. I need to be corrected if I&#39;m wrong, but I swear they put sake in their miso sauce for the katsu and thought it was a little overbearing with the combo of saltiness. Glad I had the kara-age chicken. When I got home, I didn&#39;t realize how much sodium we consumed. I understand I had ramen, but I was downing water like a bad hangover. 

All in all, I thought it was good for the suburbs. I may have come in with hopes too high. I&#39;d come back to satisfy my tonkotsu craving, but would rather go to the city if I wanted to lick the bowl clean. As far as top 10 ramen in Chicago.... I&#39;d have to try some other places, but I&#39;d put them in the mid-range of top 10 best.",18/01/16,299,3,2,5,30,5.767,3.5469999999999997,0.8359999999999999,21.617,No,2461

Our search brought us to Ramen House Shinchan! I have never been to Japan, but this must be what it is like to eat in a real ramen house! I love the atmosphere. My only complaint is how tiny the place is- it was a bit uncomfortable. 
We came here close to closing time on a Sunday night. As soon as we entered, we were greeted enthusiastically by the staff in Japanese (&#39;irrashaimase!&#39;). Both the staff and a majority of the customers were all Japanese speakers, which was very awesome! We sat at a small table on the left side of the restaurant and were brought waters. The place was packed, but they took our order in a timely manner. I got the Miso Ramen and my best friend got the Best Condition Ramen. We also got gyoza! They gyoza was hot and fresh and the ramen was delicious! The Best Condition was packed with fresh veggies and had a kick to it. The Miso Ramen was savory and my favorite part about it was the egg!

I ordered the tantan (also spelled dandan) from the specials board.  It was delicious enough that I ate it all but it was SO spicy that it was a struggle til the end. I am someone who really loves spicy food but it was too much, even for me.  They did warn me it was &#39;very spicy&#39; when I ordered it, so I can&#39;t blame the restaurant.  Please note that it is a noodle dish without broth or much visible sauce, so I would even call it deceptively spicy.

ramen-house-shinchan-palatine-2,Louise M.,UrOofvcBl0gAbKPAEaj83A,x7Fkl0ctMLVUZ0qXSKqdyQ,"Usually, when I&#39;m with my Chicago friends, I have never felt hungry. This Saturday, I was starving for some reasons between way too much activities that did not involve me opening my mouth and swallowing delicious chewable items. 

Further, it took awhile to decide where to go for lunch. Though we were all hangry, no one could suggest of where to eat. Thank goodness that all of a sudden one of us yelled Eureka! Not in the tub, but in the backyard and really...what our Archimedes was saying was..Ramen. 

Before we knew it, we were in front of Ramen House Sinchan. I have never tried it before and frankly skeptical with suburban ramen houses. Ramen is tricky you know. It&#39;s hard to find a good bowl. However, I also did not have a taste for it that day. I wanted soup but ramen broth usually is so rich and thick while I just wanted something light. At that point though, I would slurp just about anything even Archimedes&#39; bath water.

Luckily, we got seated right away thanks to my friend calling ahead. The place was pretty cool inside though small and people were waiting for a table. It was absolutely packed! I started to salivate looking at what other people were eating at nearby tables.

I was jumping for joy when finding out they had Shio ramen, which was ramen with clear chicken broth. That was exactly what I wanted! Chicken broth for my hoarse throat recovering from a cold. Perfect!! Our table also ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and Miso ramen as well as Kara age or fried chicken and some Japanese fried rice.

The fried chicken came first and oh it really was tasty! It&#39;s crispy, hot, and had a very good flavor though it could stand a bit more salt. However, once you dipped it in the mayo sauce, all is well.

My ramen was delicious and from not really wanting one, I ended up really enjoying and appreciating my bowl. The broth was light, clear, and it felt so good going down my throat. I think I drank the whole bowl of broth and left half the noodle behind completely dried. The tea egg was tasty and they gave you both halves! The noodle part was okay and I wasn&#39;t sure if the noodles were homemade. I tried my friend&#39;s Tonkotsu, and that was great! Next time when I wasn&#39;t recovering from a cold, I would go for that rich, thick, pork broth and slurp away.

The Miso was pretty good but I have never would go for Miso ramen so my opinion did not matter here. The fried rice was really nice. I don&#39;t know..it just tasted good. Was it because I was hungry? Could be, but it was still good and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Great find for me! I would never thought of going here looking at it from the outside. It was in a strip mall and it didn&#39;t stood out at all. It&#39;s cool that we don&#39;t have to go fighting traffic next time and go to the city just for ramen. That&#39;s a great discovery as great as hydrotastic or pi. The displacement of my watery broth from the bowl to my tummy was enough to make me follow suit to Archie and took the street naked jumping for joy of my discovery.

On second thought, naaaahhhhhh. I don&#39;t want to get arrested for ramen.",08/05/15,364,4,3,5,72,12.3665,8.216000000000001,1.6340000000000001,35.14999999999999,No,3128

Having tried 4 different types of ramen here, Tonkatsu is the best.  It&#39;s got a nice salty flavor for the broth and the noodles are nice and chewy.  The pork chop that comes with it is tasty, but not as good as Ramen Misoya&#39;s (and they give you 3 pieces).  I&#39;ve also had the Miso Ramen, but I found it to be quite bland, which was a disappointment.

They also have these salt and pepper chicken wings that are pretty good, and I forget the exact name of them, but it&#39;s definitely something to try.  However, the wings are super tiny, more like quail wings or something and at $6 for 5 wings, it&#39;s kinda pricey.

Also, we came with a group of 6, and it was quite difficult for them to find a place for us so we waited almost an hour at lunch time on a Sunday when it wasn&#39;t all that busy.

We started with the Gyoza and they were superb.  I had the best condition ramen and I absolutely loved it.  It is a huge portion and I brought home enough to have ramen for the next two days.  My youngest son had the chicken wings and I was totally surprised at how tasty they were.  My other son and husband both ordered different ramen.  All were delicious and warmed us up on a cold day.,18/06/16,52,5,2,3,33,2.8958,1.883,0.0,7.117,No,498

Servers for the most part aren&#39;t fluent in English, but very helpful and attentive. They have a simple menu consisting of ramen variations and some appetizers. Note that there are more options on the chalk walls inside so look up from the menu and try something that might be more seasonal or the special.

Miso Ramen: Creamy and hearty. The perfect traditional bowl of ramen. 
Best Condition: Veggie lovers paradise. Sooooo many bean sprouts that it&#39;ll take 10 bites before you find your noodles. 
Taiwan Ramen: Spicy and meaty with an extra kick of garlic. 
Kara-age: Perfectly crispy.
Gyoza: Standard

My girlfriend and I were visiting from chicago for the weekend and developed the taste for pizza.  We found this mom and pop spot on yelp and thought we&#39;d give&#39;em a try.

One of the best decisions of the trip.
The pizza was awesome !!!!
And let me remind you, im from the city,  on the west side.  I know pizza.

The crust is perfect, and the freshness of the ingredients really comes through. 
 
The owners were there,  and Rosalee was wonderful,  her service was amazing and made us feel like family.  We felt like we knew these people for years.

On our way out, the husband and chef of the establishment offered us a dessert. I was already stuffed, but my girl wanted to try it.  He brings to the counter a homemade cannoli.  It was nothing short of amazing,  i had to make room it. This place is a must do if in St. Charles area.
Thanx guys.",22/05/16,116,5,2,4,16,3.4428,2.1350000000000002,0.235,13.63,No,939
pomodoro-e-mozzarella-saint-charles,Nancy L.,yzWz3gHekKx_SLcrvR_VfA,abAftiAwJ8aE3EAccyBuHg,"Pomodoro is SO much more than a pizzeria...its a little treasure of authentic Italian eats AND priced so affordably you wish you lived down the street...

Heard this place had some ridiculously good pizza and Italian specialties - so we made the trek down to Pomodoro E Mozzarella (I love the name alone) and let me tell you I may consider moving to St. Charles (or buying a helicopter to get here).

Cute little trendy spot located in a small strip mall off of North Ave.  Its more of a carry-out spot as there are only 3 or 4 small tables.  Interior is modern, clean &amp; narrow.  You can plop yourself at the limited counter seating to your left, but not much room here especially for a large group.  On a Friday night, all tables were occupied...

The extensive menu boasts an ARRAY of traditional &amp; specialty offerings. From the traditional pasta list (18 house made choices) to seafood, chicken, sandwiches, salads and unique app&#39;s and lets not forget PIZZA. The atmosphere along with the Sicilian inspired dishes left me quite impressed....its more of a caf than a typical pizza joint..  

Our large group placed a large order to go:

Med Thin crust - Pomodoro Special (green pepper, sausage, mushroom &amp; onion).  
Piccola (small) Artisan Ortolana (grilled eggplant, zucchini &amp; roasted red peppers).
Piccola Artisan Gamberi (shrimp on garlic confit tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella).
Pesto Gnocchi
Penne w/meatballs and sausage in red sauce
Side of Rapini (for me).
Grilled baby octopus app (for me).

Our order was ready before we arrived (yes, that&#39;s how long it took us to get here, driving into the City is even faster). They even phoned to make sure we were on our way (very nice gesture) - we had passed it a few times.  From the nice phone girl to the workers behind the counter, everyone was professional and friendly and everything was nicely packaged and bagged.

While I thought the pizza&#39;s were wood fired, their in fact oven baked. Artisan resembles a wood fired crust. Around 10&#34; for a small.  They offer both small &amp; large sizes in Artisan only.  All smalls are $13, Large $20 with the exception of Margherita; $10 &amp; $18. 
Many traditional Italian varieties, but Shrimp is not one I see often, so I went for it.  

I tasted it all. Pesto gnocchi was a standout with a generous amount of pesto packed with flavor. Gnocchi was somewhat tender, but didn&#39;t melt in my mouth. I&#39;ve tasted some really heavy gnocchi and this was definately better than most. Penne in marinara was overcooked but both sauce &amp; meatball had great flavor. I&#39;d order the gnocchi before Penne.

I loved my side of Rapini. Very tender, very flavorful.  Sauted with lots of chopped garlic and olive oil.  Healthy and tasty.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.  Not something I expected to see here, love that they offer this. The grilled baby octopus...ooooooohhh....they give you three nice sized octopus and I am a SUCKER for this.   Perfectly charred and tender, gently laying in balsamic &amp; oil with lemon..I was in octopus heaven. Another stand out - Loved this. You MUST try it. Screw the calamari, get this instead, well worth it.

Artisan pizza - I tasted &amp; noticed olive oil on the bottom of crust which had a softer bite vs. chewy.  The fresh mozzarella they use is excellent quality, you can taste it. Shrimp pizza was a garlicky explosion. You may not want to kiss anyone after eating this. Nice amount of shrimp not overcooked.  Ortolana is a go-to of mine, but veggies were cut to thick for this crust. Chunks of grilled red pepper, thick sliced zucchini and eggplant.  It made the middle soggy and crust couldn&#39;t hold the weight of toppings. But I loved that each veggie was perfectly grilled, tender and ultra tasty.  I had no problem finishing leftovers...  
Thin crust pizza was liked by all. I thought it was good, but would go with the Artisan again.

You won&#39;t find a better value for the quality here. Seriously. Pasta&#39;s start at $10, most expensive $12 w/seafood.  Compared to your average restaurant, that is a STEAL.  Most expensive app; Octopus $11.  Portions are enough for two. When you don&#39;t feel like making dinner, you come here for some home style cooking instead..

Pomodoro is a great find and I can see why its popular among locals.  Quality &amp; preparation is above and beyond. Sicilian owned with dishes done right. I&#39;d come back for the rapini and grilled octopus alone and maybe try an Arancini or the Sicilian specialty -  Tronchetti Di Panelli (garbanzo fritters - sound delish).  They make their own bread too.  Grab an 8&#34; pizza and soda for $4.99 during the lunch special.

St. Charles is lucky to have you Pomodoro. If your in the area searching for a great, casual, fast and affordable meal, you&#39;d be stupid not to check them out.",01/05/16,602,4,2,5,42,10.275900000000002,7.772,3.8539999999999996,50.374,No,4866

This is mostly a take-out restaurant, but there is a little counter to eat at if you&#39;d like to stay and eat.

Now, good Italian food is simple and gets it&#39;s flavor from good ingredients. These guys deliver on that. The sauces are excellent and the pastas are always done perfectly - not overcooked like 90% of the places around here. 

Their pizzas are seriously fantastic.

This is definitely a place where you&#39;ll do well being a little adventurous with your order. For the love of God, quit ordering spaghetti and try something new. 

The couple that runs this place are great. Super nice people. The food isn&#39;t pretentious at all, it&#39;s honest and really good.

After a great conversation, she brought us some of the homemade toasted ravioli and fresh bread. It&#39;s hard for me to find new adjectives to describe how absolutely amazing the food is.

We ordered the grilled octopus; it was perfect and smoky, just as I like it. The fried mozzarella sticks had a unique batter on them, and were delivered piping hot (something most other places manage to screw up). As recommended here on Yelp, we ordered one of the artisan pizzas, the Quattro Gusti. It was outstanding. I&#39;m not sure about some of the fuss about the crust being overcooked; it had a lovely slight char that we thought made the pizza. The ONLY reason I didn&#39;t give Pomodoro E Mozzarella five stars is because when it was delivered, the center of the pie was completely soggy, making it difficult to eat or even pick up. Perhaps the center was rolled just a little too thin, but we won&#39;t let that stop us from coming to this place again. Neither should you.

My wife is a writer for the Institute of Food Technologist and gets to travel and try a lot of wonderful chefs creations from around the world. She too is now addicted to this pizza. The most recent combination we tried was the Sicilian Deep Dish and the Fresca. We are having fun trying everything they offer. The Fresca had a wonderful combination of fresh arugula offering a bitter element that is balanced by the sweetness of the asiago cheese. With the savory base quality of the prosciutto, this will be a pizza we will order on a regular basis.

I don&#39;t know how you offer such a high quality pizza at the price you do, but I hope we can all benefit from your creations. My family has been residents of Saint Charles since 1981 and in all the years we have lived here, I have never been so excited for a restaurant to open it&#39;s doors.

Food- We were ordering for ten people, so we ordered quite a bit of food including cheese thin crust, sausage and spinach artisan, wings, pasta, and salad.  The thin crust cheese id say was about the same quality as pizza cucina or Taylor street, but the artisan pizza is where they really step up their game.  In my opinion they should only have the artisan pizzas on the menu because it was way better than their other kinds, and way better than a lot of other pizza in the area, especially for delivery.  We got the ai spinachi pizza with sausage, fresh mozzarella, and spinach.  The sausage was hearty and flavorful, just like Italian sausage should be.  The spinach also had great flavor and did NOT overpower the other ingredients with bitterness like spinach tends to do.  The wings were pretty good as well, but were pretty expensive for how small they were and the quantity they came in.  The pasta was a simple EVO sauce which was good but the tomatoes in the pasta were tasty and fresh.  Salad was good as well.

Get yourself over to this itty bitty Italian spot.  Now, let me tell you about the food.  The toasted ravioli were crunchy and with delicious creamy insides.  The fried zucchini sticks stayed firm.  I&#39;ve had them from other places where the vegetable becomes floppy and gross.  The breading was dense and seasoned.  They came with ranch and marinara.  I wish the marinara was thicker but the flavor was sweet and flavorful.  The arancini rice ball was huge.  It was also amazing.  We should have stopped there but we already ordered an eggplant parmesan sandwich and two pizzas.  The sandwich had three huge slices of eggplant and enough cheese for a small pizza.  Do you like just fried potato chips with a dusting of seasoning.  It was the type of seasoning that you would lick off first and then eat the chip.  But when your in public that sort of thing is frowned upon.  Anyway, the fresca pizza will be ordered again and again.  It had such a fresh look and perfect flavor combination that I would understand if you stopped reading and went there now. The other pizza was very good.  Ai Spinaci was the name.  The garlic in the sauce was chunky.  I love garlic so this was so welcomed.  As for the sausage I am guilty of picking off a few extra bits from the other slices.

 Yelp steered me right here. 
Never had rice-ball appetizer before, but how tasty, glad we went with that! I&#39;d love to have one in front of me right now!

Have NO idea why it gets 2 dollar signs, it&#39;s about as affordable as it gets! 

The couple running this business are seriously charming &amp; delightful to speak with. Wife came over (as 3 of us are teachers) to chime in on education (so nice to hear support on any level). 

Being Italian I know the food well &amp; trust me, this is as good as you get back home in Italy, it&#39;s the genuine article with all fresh ingredients. 

I know they haven&#39;t much room (4 of us actually ate there. Proximity perfect; place happens to be situated between us. And yet still hr. away for each party) so how wonderful if they could expand---albeit, on other hand, one doesn&#39;t want to see them overwhelmed &amp; potentially risk lower quality! So maybe this is best!   

The absolutely ONLY slight issue is they are not suited much for dining in, so had to run to Oberweiss to use bathroom after long drive but hey, that&#39;s fine by me, got to decide what small ice cream to order afterward. 
Though honestly, we all agreed after we sat down to eat it, STUPID move!
How in the world did I NOT think Tiramisu &amp; other desserts HERE instead, was the way to go??! 
Clearly, we were NOT thinking!
Now I&#39;m dreaming of what that would&#39;ve been like instead. The desserts in Italy are decadent &amp; delicious. This place seems virtually plucked out from my two Italy-trip experiences.. 
Maybe time to go back, no matter how far!.

I&#39;m quite the pizza lover. The sad part is that I don&#39;t get to have it often. I live in Los Angeles. Coming from Chicago, it&#39;s hard to even bother with pizza in LA. So when I came home for the holidays and saw this new pizza place right on the corner, I was super intrigued. I had to try it. And boy did I try it- 3 times in 2 weeks. I&#39;ve tried their thin, artisan, stuffed, pan, chicken parm, and arancini. MY GOD, YOU GUYS. This is the real deal. The dough tastes fresh. The tomatoes in their marinara and pizza sauce is unlike any other pizza joint. The spaghetti was homemade. Why go to any other pizza place and get frozen stuff just warmed up when you can go to this amazing place?!

pomodoro-e-mozzarella-saint-charles,Rick S.,LCGs_ixUo9nX26Icf6D__Q,wetFY9TJnHEK2EkWxHxQ3w,"If you are into arancini - this is an authentic, Sicilian recipe - wonderful! If you haven&#39;t tried arancini (also referred to as &#34;rice balls&#34; - an underwhelming description), you are in for a treat. Think of a ball of soft, moist arborio rice (about the size of a baseball) filled with a thick, cheesy, tomato-based, meat ragu. The entire ball is breaded and deep-fried. Served with a side of tomato sauce. Delicious is not a strong enough word. 

Originally, arancini were made with day-old risotto - not a bad way to make use of your leftovers! The point is - you would expect to find seasoned rice with plenty of cheese. Pomodoro has found a way to keep their rice moist and wonderful without adding the calories/fat from additional cheese. The ragu center is equally creamy (you&#39;ll find a little cheese in there). They are fried to a perfect, crispy golden brown. 

Ok - can you tell I&#39;m an arancini nut to begin with? I&#39;ve made a few thousand from my own Sicilian family recipe. Pomodoro E Mozorella comes as close as anyone ever has to my grandmother&#39;s arancini.

Yet we hadn&#39;t tried this relatively new place in St. Charles. So we did.

We ordered a medium cheese for the 2 kids (and OK, for us a bit too) and then a &#34;Fresca Artisan Style&#34; pizza (a &#34;no red sauce&#34; style pizza) for the adults.

 We all agreed when enjoyed them both. The bit hit for us adults was definitely the Fresca pizza we ordered. I absolutely loved the crisp crust and the fresh toppings. That pizza was gone within a few minutes.

Then we stole a piece or two of the cheese pizza... it was.. good. The crust wasn&#39;t nearly as crispy as the Fresca pizza we ate. It was loaded with cheese... the kids loved it.. but it was almost too much. As some has stated it&#39;s very greasy, but hey that&#39;s what lots of cheese does when baked.

We&#39;d order here from again and definitely try more of their &#34;Artisan Style&#34; pizzas.

Since it was my first time, I decided to order the lunch special, an 8 inch personal pizza and a can of soda for $4.99. No, you are reading it right, a pizza and a soda lunch combo for only $4.99! I ordered a basic sausage pizza with fresh basil. Initially, I wasn&#39;t expecting much for two reasons. One, there was only one other couple dinning during my visit and, two, other than their selection of Sicilian style artisan pizzas, they offered some of the most common &#34;Italian&#34; selections one would find or expect to find in just about any other mom-and-pop pizza joint. However, when I saw chef and owner, Joe, reached in a rectangular tube and out came a ball of dough, one you can see is very fresh is just right, I knew I just ordered something special. I was right! As a fan of just about everything pasta or pasta related, one bite of my pizza told me Joe took the effort to craft perfectly al dente bites for his customers. For me, the dough makes the pie and everything else completes the master piece. I was in heaven! The sauce was just right. The topping were all very fresh, especially the fresh basil. To top my experience off, I had a most wonderful conversation with owners Joe and Rosalinda (two of the most beautiful people anyone could ever meet). I felt more like a guest at their home instead of dinning in a restaurant. I am hooked! I will have to try one of their artisan pizzas the next visit. It is really too bad that this place does not have the best location. Joe and Rosalinda&#39;s place isn&#39;t an everyday mom-a-pop joint. They should be a gourmet restaurant. My only complain? The price of their pizza lunch special is too low. They need to seriously think about raising it another $2 or so. People will pay for the value because the pie alone is worth the extra $2. Go!

Unfortunately the fish paste for the Seafood Karekare was not within our like of sight and hidden behind the huge bowl of Karekare so we ate without it; I wished we would&#39;ve known as I don&#39;t normally eat this dish. It was bland and my friend agreed given to what was mentioned, we wished it was on plain sight. Lechon Kawali was great and crunchy, though the sauce was the generic liver sauce (Mang Tomas) nothing special there.

The server was great and suggested some for us and we tried it, such as ordering a bowl of rice instead of 3 cups of rice. Thank you for that. But once we ate, we were only checked one time and we had to get the attention of other servers so we can ask for something. Observing the servers, there was a lot of talking amongst themselves and that could be one reason why we weren&#39;t paid good attention, also it would be appreciated if all of them smiled and not look that they were having a bad day or just had a poker face. Our main server was great though he smiled genuinely and had good mannerism. What&#39;s good was after we got their attention, our request was granted in a timely manner, it wasn&#39;t a hectic day I might add.",21/10/16,152,3,2,5,43,4.6461,2.7150000000000003,0.313,8.973,No,1374

I&#39;d give this place a 2.5 only because the food was great but the service was really bad.. 
Maybe it was the time that we got here (around 2:30 on a Sunday) but the service was just... bad. First off, there was a really disorganized line - only one line for both those waiting to be seated AND for to go orders. Everyone was hovering the front desk and customers were all over the place.   As I waited in line, I noticed waiters on the side talking rather than cleaning up tables  for other customers to be seated. 
Anyways, they finally called our names and we were seated an hour later. They took our order (hototai soup, crispy pata, pancit Bihon, okoy, Kare kare, and 3 desserts - halo halo, Taho, and buko pandan - &amp; like I said we came from Chicago so we wanted to try a lot of food and take whatever left home). We got our food in decent time and everything was fresh and hot (which is why I&#39;d give this a 4/5 if only rating the quality of the food)..
BUT.... Honestly there was a lot of hair on the crispy pata - not appealing at all. And the pancit came last and we were basically done with all our main dishes by the time it came out (we thought they&#39;d forgotten about the order). But whatever, it was good. 

SO THEN they eventually gave us the check.. YET it turned out to be someone else&#39;s check smh (theirs was like 90 and ours was supposed to be around 60) so we complained and they finally came back with our check. We paid, blah blah. BUT WHERES OUR DESSERTS? A bus boy kept hovering our table like wondering why we aren&#39;t leaving and we finally told him that we&#39;ve been waiting for our 3 desserts for the past 10 minutes after we returned our check. So they finally give us the halo halo and Taho and they apologize for the wait and thank us.. BUT WHERES THE BUKO PANDAN? So they finally give us that after like 5 minutes... Smh everything was just going badly service wise. 


Other than the terrible service the food was pretty good especially because it&#39;s rare to find a Filipino restaurant that doesn&#39;t have oil overpowering the food. Also, the quality and quantity of the food was fair for the price. The food is the reason I gave this place a 2 (a 2.5 if I could) but the service was too bad for me to give it any more.",21/08/16,264,2,1,1,1,0.6354,1.544,1.446,16.009999999999998,No,2387
hong-ning-restaurant-carol-stream,Christine T.,ttYPB7LZgD6A7b98hOiJ0g,MZP587buncDXM6QqRID6Jg,"I actually really like this place. I&#39;ll admit it- I tend to be skeptical about Filipino restaurants because my mom caters Filipino food and I haven&#39;t found a place that is up to par with her cooking until Hong Ning. I recommend! My mom does too!

We usually visit on Sunday afternoons. There is always a bit of a wait, but we just walk over to the nearby Starbucks to kill time (the waiting area is not that big). From my experience, the wait never went over 30 minutes for a group of 4. Most of the guests come in families. 

The decor is nice, but the floor is a bit slippery-- not sure why. The tables are small, especially since the food comes in large plates/platters so the table gets a bit crowded once the food comes. I can tell that this place is a bit understaffed, but service was still pretty good on all occasions we&#39;ve been there. All servers are helpful, despite how much they are running back and forth from the kitchen to the dining area. 

We always order the sinigang, crispy pata, and the inihaw fiesta. The entrees are meant to be shared, so the portions are a bit large for 2 people. 

Sinigang: Yum! Served at a nice, hot temperature and is very sour-- which is how I like my sinigang. It could&#39;ve had more meat and veggies, but it is still very good. 

Crispy Pata: We order a large for a group of 4 of us. Very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. They got the dipping sauce right, too. 

Inihaw Fiesta: Beautiful presentation, it&#39;s served on a platter with banana leaves (love!). It comes with muscles, calamari, tilapia, barbecue chicken skewers, chargrilled pork belly, dipping sauce, and bagoong. This is perfect for a larger group. Definitely my favorite on the menu. 

Overall: I very much recommend! Honestly, Hong Ning is the ONLY Filipino restaurant in the Chicago-land area that my family and I regularly visit. Haven&#39;t found another restaurant that we like enough to make a second/third visits to except this place!",29/06/16,236,4,2,5,32,6.5533,5.213,0.44200000000000006,20.343999999999998,No,1985

I really like Filipino food because it reminds me of the friends.i made in college. However, the restaurant didn&#39;t have a lot on their lunch special. I ordered off the main menu and I think the food was a little costly. Also, for lunch, this was not a good option. We had an hour to eat but the check took a while. The food I got was good, but not a huge favorite. I think if you want authentic meats like tripe, oxtail and jackfruit, come here. They have a lot of those options.",30/10/16,64,3,1,1,4,0.301,0.808,0.7629999999999999,7.429,No,530
hong-ning-restaurant-carol-stream,Justine R.,x8NEyImjwa3jP2fw5wbHeA,wKu09_l-l0f2YtwauJ7Yng,"I&#39;ve gone here since I was a kid, and although I think the owner is amazing and has worked so hard to make this place as successful as it is, he needs to do something about his waitstaff. They seem blas and unfocused. Upon seating, our party of 5 was given as carafe of ice water... with no glasses. I asked waiter #1 for cups. He said yes, then proceeded to do other various tasks. 5 min later I ask waiter #2 for cups. She says yes.. then a couple min later, waiter #3 arrives with our cups. But in all that time no one asked if we were ready to order. We finally order (15 min after being seated), and the food arrives very quickly. The amount of stars I&#39;ve given are based on the food alone. I&#39;ve never had any bad food here. Maybe the negative food reviews are on their off days?

So we finish what we can but of course have leftovers. I went through the same amount of almost begging for to go containers as well as the check. When asking for the containers the 2nd time, I also asked for our 2 halo halo to go, since at that point I just wanted to get out of there. It took almost 30 minutes from the time I asked for the check the 1st time to the time I could finally leave. 

I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve done something to offend the waitstaff but it definitely felt that way. I&#39;ll definitely be back, but never again to stay and dine in. I hope they improve their ideals of what it means to be customer-oriented. You don&#39;t have to love your job to deal with the public, you just have to know how to make the customers believe you do. ;)",01/03/16,178,3,1,2,-42,1.8868000000000003,2.957,1.5,16.543,No,1568
hong-ning-restaurant-carol-stream,Alma C.,4TCOItk-gIJROyNA5ftZ-Q,IOP_QsAYKdzyENfJJAwcow,"Fact 1: The Philippines has over 7000 islands, is the second most polylingual nation on earth after Papua New Guinea and cuisine-wise is as varied and diverse as the cultures that have influenced it from the Spanish to the Chinese to the American, et al. 

Fact 2: despite being proud of the awesomely diverse culture, just about every Pinoy/Pinay dining at a Filipino restaurant secretly expects the food coming out of the kitchen to taste EXACTLY like mom&#39;s, lola&#39;s or tita&#39;s.

Fact 3. Ain&#39;t no way a Pinoy/Pinay that is dining w mom, lola or tita will admit that the restaurant food is better. That would be suicide.

Given these undisputed facts, it is a testament of quality to Hong Ning that they&#39;ve been able to thrive for almost 2 decades from its original humble store front in Glendale Heights to its current locale in an area that has a large Filipino community full of home cooks that think they&#39;re the latest incarnation of Iron Chef Pilipinas. Hong Ning has stood the test of time bc it&#39;s good Filipino food period. If you don&#39;t like the food here, you might just not appreciate Filipino food. Yet. Give it a few tries before you give up bc sometimes people need some adjusting to unfamiliar flavors.

Anyhow, if you haven&#39;t tried Filipino food, this is a great place to start. The food here is better than some nationally recognized Filipino spots I&#39;ve been to around the country. Entrees are inexpensive and I suggest coming with a group of at least 4+ so you can try a lot of things (BBQ!). The service I&#39;ve had here has been above average especially for an Asian restaurant (no shade thrown... You know what I mean!) and especially since the last time I was here it was with a rowdy group of 20+ picky ass eaters who ditched their moms, lolas and titas bc they didn&#39;t want to hide the fact that they were really enjoying the food.

I decided on something rather simple that both my little sons would be happy with. We ordered the shanghai egg rolls, BBQ pork skewers and an order of chicken inasal. The chicken in particular was very good. My boys were happy and couldn&#39;t get enough of their baby egg rolls. My 4yr old (the particular one ) asked me about 4 times if we were going to be able to bring the egg rolls home... so that means they were a hit, lol.

Me and my fiancee came here for the first time last night for dinner, and immediatle the place doesn&#39;t look like your typical filipino restaurant. The decor is very nice the tables and lighting are unique. When we got in the place is packed and busy with filipino athmosphere.. We were seated right away after they cleaned a table for us. 

The menu was very simple and right on the spot your classic filipino dishes. We started with appetizer of fried calamri and for entree the sizzling sisig and grilled pork belly. The service was fast, food came in quickly.. 

The food is very flavorful and everything we like. The only negative was they charge for the rice.

For dessert we ordered the halo halo. And it was plentiful for the price me and fiancee had hard time tackling it. 

Overall our 1hr trip was all worth the drive. They set the standards high for all filipino restaurants. Filipino restaurant in the orland park area are pretty mediocre. 

We will be back soon. If we crave for more filipino food.",14/04/16,120,5,2,2,26,1.0471000000000001,1.034,0.488,14.478,No,1117

And it is also my first time having Filipino food, and I was so disappointed. 

I&#39;ve never been to the old location, but this one is spacious and the decor is interesting. When you first walk in, it smells delicious and you can&#39;t wait to sit down and order.

I had ordered a kare kare. It is a braised oxtail and tripe in a &#34;peanut sauce.&#34; First off, there were no &#34;peanut&#34; present in the sauce whatsoever. like none. The tripe were big pieces and uncut, so it is a little chewy to bite. They were also not cleaned well, therefore  it gave off a fishy smell. The oxtail were okay, the meat fell right off the bone so it was easy to eat. Overall, the dish was very bland and under flavored. It looked like a curry, and I was hoping it would taste like the sort..but it didn&#39;t.

My boyfriend got the pritong  tilapia, basically it is just a WHOLE tilapia deep fried. They also served it with their &#34;house spiced vinegar.&#34; The fish... was fishy. Because it was not rubbed in any spice or flavoring, the fish was very fishy. Their sauce seemed like it was just soy sauce mixed with vinegar because there were no &#34;spice&#34; to it. 

Our meal was served with rice and some sort of fish or shrimp paste. I have eaten my fair share of fish and shrimp paste. I mean, Vietnamese people know how to ferment their shit man. I digress, anyways...the smell of that paste was so pungent. The taste was delicious to the bland meal, but I could not get over that smell. I did not find it very pleasant. 

I am also wary at the fact that they CHARGED me for rice, like really? RICE for crying out loud. 

I was not impressed with this place, seeing how many of my Filipino friends boasted about this place and how salty Filipino food can be and how EVERYTHING was delicious. smh.",16/10/15,223,2,3,4,66,3.3230999999999997,3.2890000000000006,2.6130000000000004,22.096,No,1957

Food: We came for lunch on a weekday to avoid the weekend crowd. We ordered pretty much the main traditional dishes: crispy pata, beef soup, pata tim, fried rice, halo-halo, kare-Kare, pinaputok na bangus.  The servings were satisfactory. But overall, the food lacks flavor, the meats could be more tender, and needs more time for flavor to set in. The pata tim was one of my greater disappointments -- the hocks tasted gamey, and wasn&#39;t cleaned/shaved well of pig&#39;s  hair. Kare Kare was tough, and lacks the usual creamy flavor of the dish. Fried rice was ... A little on the hard side.

I don&#39;t write many Yelp Reviews unless it&#39;s the best thing or the worst thing I ever ate OR unless it really pissed me off...LOL...If you like salty very salty Filipino food and lack of service this is the place to be. I ordered the &#34;sizzling pusit&#34; and there was nothing sizzling about it literally... It was cold and it was NOT cleaned properly it&#39;s was sandy and I had a plastic cartilage that needed to be taken out!  

We&#39;re not the only one that noticed the salt,the family behind us said the same thing about the food they ordered which solidify my findings.

Then the Caldereta came short rib style and the meat was not tender... It needed about 30 more minutes in the pressure cooker! Caldereta needs a little more spice! The only saving grace to my first experience here was the Lechon Roll that&#39;s it. I hate that they charge for white rice! Even the Chinese people don&#39;t do that no offense... But it&#39;s true! 

If you want authentic Filipino food try Sarilin Atin in Des Plaines! It&#39;s a small hole in a wall place but their weekend buffet is grand slam I can&#39;t say anything bad about them.  Again it&#39;s a really small place but it&#39;s a hidden gem..I just wish I lived closer to Des Plaines so I can go there everyday.

Took my family to try Yoshi for the first time.  We were the only customers at the hibachi tables. We ordered our meal and some sushi as an appetizer. 

Salad and soup were very good (salad is all about the ginger dressing). Sushi was also very good. 

Hibachi time. Half the meal is the show, the other half is the food. The show was so-so. A couple tricks and juggling but the chef&#39;s personality was pretty dry. 

The food... Very bland. Sauces didn&#39;t do much to liven it up. Vegetables were last on the griddle and not cooked enough. Onion was quickly sauted/chopped and plated. Barely cooked and no seasoning. 

I also noticed raw chicken was on the same tray as vegetables and touching them... Made me a little nervous when the vegetables were undercooked. 

In the end, product not worth coming back for. Kyoto remains at the top of our list for Hibachi, Kumi for sushi.",15/05/16,104,2,1,2,-31,1.1979,1.08,0.66,15.260999999999997,No,894

urban-counter-wheaton,Lary M.,z9JXcbIjlT8CQdioHdO63A,Qj39nCh9JIzXMt59v8DUsg,"I went here a couple weeks ago for a late lunch takeout (1:45pm).  The place is attached to a gas station, but has it&#39;s own entrance also.  It has a few tables between the entrance and the gas station shopping side.  I walked up to the counter to see the menu and order.  There was no own around and after a minute or 2 wait, i walk back to the gas station where I had seen somebody wiping down a table when I walked in.  This person was gone, so I returned to the counter and called out.  3 workers in there late teens to early 20&#39;s appeared from the back.  

I ordered a BBQ/bacon burger and got is with the fries and drink to go.  I was asked how I wanted the burger cooked and replied medium rare.  The one female working began by putting a bun one the grill top and then put a burger patty on too.  She took the bun off after it had grill marks and put it on the work area.  She let the burger sit on the grill and the grease from it caused the fire to rise up and engulf the burger.  After watching this for a minute or so, I complained saying I wanted the burger medium rare not burned on the outside.  The guy who took my order stepped in and said it was to get grill mark on the burger.  Okay, that I don&#39;t mind, but check out the pictures to see if that was what I got (sorry can&#39;t find how to upload the photos I took of the meal).  He removed the burger from the grill and then steamed it on the flat top with water and a cover.  

The female cooked the fries and the onion ring for the burger.  When she finished and was packing up the fries, she dropped a 1/3rd of them on the floor.  She didn&#39;t even flinch or offer to cook more, just put what was left in the bag.  With the burger and fries in the bag, she put them on the counter and said here is your stuff.  I said it wasn&#39;t done.  The guy then said, it is your order.  I said it is missing my drink.  The female walked over to the fountain without asking what flavor I wanted.  She finally turned around to ask and I said Coke but no ice please.  She immediately picks up the ice scoop and puts ice in the glass.  I repeated my request and finally got it the way I ordered it.  

I took the burger home to eat.  The burger was cooked well on the outside (burned by the fire) and brown not pink on the inside.  It was a decent portion, but was not very good.  The onion ring was hard and crispy and the fries were good but missing the rest on the floor of the restaurant.  

The customer service experience was horrible.  Nobody out front when I arrived.  Not paying attention to the food cooking or listening to the order.  A 4th person arrived and appeared to be the manger/owner&#39;s son.  While he joked with the staff, he was counting the money in the register.  He ignored the exchanges by the workers with me and no one apologized for the delay or quality of the food.",15/08/16,307,2,1,-2,-61,-2.0481999999999996,0.9469999999999998,1.947,34.10600000000001,No,2869

The chili is fantastic, and is definitely something I would order again. We never leave hungry and the prices are great. Gammon Coach House is occasionally on restaurant.com, which is how we found it in the first place.",21/02/15,72,4,1,4,2,3.3728,1.9149999999999998,0.0,6.085,No,704

Their Bloody Mary&#39;s are fantastic though, and their food is excellent. I&#39;ve experienced their Grilled Cheese, which has cheese on the outside of the sandwich, too. M built his own pizza on our first visit with bacon, pepperoni, and jalapenos. 

On our most recent visit, we again got our Bloody Mary&#39;s. He decided to build his own omelette with pepper jack and bleu cheese, bacon, and jalapenos. I wasn&#39;t in the mood for breakfast, so I ordered the hot dog with everything with tator tots. Our waitress asked me &#34;Everything?&#34; I answered affirmatively, but then she asked about mushrooms and I said &#34;hell no&#34; but in different words and more politely. After she left, I wondered who the hell would put mushrooms on a hot dog? Ewww. I&#39;m pretty sure she was joking around but still....

When our food was brought out, I shit you not, all I saw was a mound of toppings. It was awesome! A beautiful quarter pound hot dog with lettuce, pico de gallo, huge pickles sliced round, a beautiful slice of pepper jack cheese, and god knows what else, but it was delicious. It was quite filling paired with the tator tots. M successfully ate every scrap of his breakfast. As I watched his eyes roll into the back of his head, I knew a nap was in his immediate future. 

I can&#39;t comment on the inside, as we&#39;ve always sat out on the patio, but that&#39;s where I prefer to be. As others have said, it&#39;s a bit hard to find if you&#39;re not familiar with the area, and your first attempt to park can be confusing as well.

Pulled chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce?  Forget dessert just give me two of these.  Tater tots are pretty standard fare for a restaurant, but they recently had a BBQ Apple Cider sauce mixture on the table that made these absolutely incredible.

Awesome beer selection with a lot of local favorites.  They switch up the selection to make it seasonal, meaning a once-a-month visitor will always have something new to try.

Avoid the Batavia Bulldog unless you can pull down a few hundred dollars in bets to finish the thing.  Hot dog wrapped in bacon deep fried and covered in chili.

gammon-coach-house-batavia,Jennifer S.,mYvZwQ3T5JzqwOyURQWA_w,nwXr-DI76-rzdOuOXt8nsg,"It&#39;s Sunday afternoon. We&#39;re headed back to Bartlett from the Aurora Premium Outlets. Hunger strikes!  Gammon Coach House is basically on our way home and so our lunch problem appears to be solved. 

We entered the somewhat cramped establishment with pretty low expectations. What we experienced was the exact opposite. Success!

It was a cold October afternoon, so no one was eating out on the patio. It is a nice additional space for seating though. We had the option of bar seating, a table on the bar side or any one of the six or so tables on the other side. We went to the least crowded area on the other side and made ourselves comfortable.

Our server was very sweet. Unnecessary side note: She was a hired server at Jenny McCarthy&#39;s Halloween Party in Geneva the night before and couldn&#39;t get all of the professional vampire makeup off of herself. She was kind enough to let us know that she wasn&#39;t in a car accident or anything like that earlier and that it was just makeup. It made for great conversation with her!  And we&#39;re back to your regularly scheduled review...

We started with chips &amp; salsa and onion rings. The salsa was homemade and quite good. The onion rings stole the show!  Crisp beer batter that wasn&#39;t too heavy. Those were delicious!!

We tried the chili and the chicken tortilla soup. Both were obviously made fresh and really tasty. My beef?  The chicken tortilla soup was loaded with cheese...and it didn&#39;t say that on the menu. I scooped out what I could and proceeded to eat. No crunchy tortilla strips here. Fresh corn tortilla pieces throughout with chicken breast chunks. Woo hoo!!

Around the table were patty melts, a grilled cheese and a burger with fries, tater tots and sweet potato tater tots as the side dishes.  The burgers were hand packed and served on bakery type buns. Actually all of the bread was bakery quality. The sweet potato tater tots seem to be their own creation while the fries and regular tater tots were your standard frozen variety that weren&#39;t exciting.  I think I read that someone said that you don&#39;t come here for the food. I totally disagree. I&#39;d make the effort to come back for the food. I might even order the same meal sans cheese of course!  

Everyone around the table was pleased with the food. And the beer menu was extensive. We weren&#39;t drinking, but there was a nice variety available. The only other complaint was that although we had good attention during the meal, we think we may have been forgotten about in the side room once we were done eating. We had to eventually go ask our server for a box and the check. Not a huge problem, but the layout is not conducive to being able to see everything from one room to the next. 

I&#39;m sorry that we didn&#39;t try a homemade dessert. I should have saved room. Next time?  Aw yeah!",27/10/13,318,4,1,5,-16,7.586600000000001,7.808999999999999,3.0050000000000003,35.189,No,2863

This place is a little hidden, though it&#39;s behind the blue building on the corner near the library.  The person I was meeting got lost and I followed as my GPS told me to turn and it was THERE, well it wasn&#39;t but then I figured I&#39;d pull in where the little stores were and I found it.

As for seating, there is a patio, a bar area, and back room.  The place has great atmosphere!  The menu is limited which is a good thing because too much to choose from just makes for a complicated meal sometimes ya know?!  What you get here is craft beer and comfort food - makes for a great lunch!

There is a craft beer menu, and the beers come in three sizes.  If you&#39;re unsure of what to order, they will give you a tasting of the beer which was super nice because I have very little knowledge of beer outside my comfort zone.  

I ordered a patty melt with tater tots - it was a good size, very tasty and not at all greasy as patty melts can be.  My friend ordered the spaghetti dinner special - it was a good size portion for around $8.

gammon-coach-house-batavia,Dan S.,81fr37MM4GR62S2yvOt3gA,J3cOCXmiGp5peYWRtUHdRQ,"Went here based on a recommendation of a friend.  Since it was close to home &amp; Kelly&#39;s last dinner before a business trip, we decided to check it out. 

Visually, the place isn&#39;t much to look at.  A small bar with a few tables on the inside with outdoor patio.  Since it was in the upper 60&#39;s for March, we dined on the patio.  Service was excellent but it wasn&#39;t overly busy for Monday night at 6.  

They have 2 menus, one for food &amp; one for beer.  That&#39;a a good sign in my opinion.  Let&#39;s talk brew frist.    They had probably 30-40 craft/micro beers to choose from with others on tap.  Kelly &amp; I ordered a couple beers.  I tried a new one that sounded good but didn&#39;t like it at all.  I ordered a more familiar beer that I enjoy.  They were out of it but the waitress brought a sample of a beer on tap that was similar that I enjoyed so I ordered that.  Nice.  She  also removed the bad beer from the bill!  Kelly enjoyed her beer but we didn&#39;t order another since she wanted to get home to prepare for the trip. 

As for the grub, it&#39;s a smaller food menu with your usual bar/American fare.  Since burger was on special (&amp; the lone guy outside had one that looked great), I ordered that &amp; the sweet tater tots.  Kelly ordered a corned beef reuben.  Food came out quickly &amp; was very good.  My burder was very tasty with a great brioche bun.  The sweet tater tots were spot on but needed a little salt for my liking.  Kelly said her reuben was the best one she&#39;d ever had.   The check came quickly after we were done &amp; was taken care of in under 5 minutes.  

All in all, it was a very enjoyable, affordable, unpretentious,  comfortable dining experience with great service!

Beer menu = really good. Lots of stuff you can find in most decent beer bars, but a good selection of the finer craft brews. They had Scurry by Off Color Brewing on nitro, which tasted excellent. They also had some brews from Solemn Oath, Deschutes, Lagunitas, Left Hand, Stone, and Three Floyds on draft. There were other good selections available in bottles/cans, like Founders, Oskar Blues, Revolution, Great Lakes, Church Street, and Two Bros. Good to see they support local brews! They had a tap for Penrose hanging on the ceiling, and that place isn&#39;t even open yet (soon to be in Geneva, I believe). 

Anyway, beer was good, right? No Miller Lites or lawnmower beers. Lots of whiskey and bourbon to choose from, and a couple ciders available (not Woodchuck). I think that any craft beer lover would be happy. ALSO, you can get a 6oz beer, if you want to try a few beers instead of drinking one or two large pints. It&#39;s a nice option, if you aren&#39;t sure what you want a lot of, or if you just are in the variety sort of mood.

Food, woah. They have a grilled cheese with CHEESE on the OUTSIDE. It&#39;s crisped on the outside of the bread, so don&#39;t expect something oozy-gooey on the outside, but don&#39;t be dismayed. It&#39;s really good and flavorful. We added grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, tomato, and bacon. This thing was overflowing but not gross or messy. Lots of flavor without an obscene amount of cheese. We split that, and then also split the Patty Melt. It was fairly standard...homemade burger patty on toasted, marbled rye, swiss, and grilled onions. The burger was a bit more than medium, but it was juicy, so no complaints. If I had to pick a winner, I&#39;d vote for the grilled cheese, but I&#39;m not sorry I ordered the patty melt.

THOSE FRIES THOUGH. They look like boring-@ss fries, but don&#39;t be fooled. My husband ordered sweet potato tots and was a sorry sucka. He didn&#39;t finish his tots and was picking from my pile of carby, salty french fries. Not too thick, not too thin, with a crunchy outside and fluffy inside. Fried to perfection, and you get a lot. Yummmmm.

Cory behind the bar was friendly and knowledgable. Everything was prompt and he checked back on us frequently. He even asked &#34;Does everything taste great?&#34; assuming that the found was excellent (which it was). Glad to see this place and its quality inspires confidence in its employees. 

I&#39;ll be back here. There are other items on the menu that I NEED to try, plus they have rotating specials, like spaghetti, ribs, tacos, etc. Their beer menu is rotating, and its nice to see that they have it posted on their website.

It&#39;s kinda cramped, but the atmosphere and decor make up for a lot of it. 

They have a good selection of beverages, and even though the food menu was limited, everything that we received on it was great. 

The service was top-notch, but with a place that small, you really can&#39;t screw it up!

My one suggestion to the owners would be to fix the light in the bathroom. It&#39;s on a motion sensor, and while doing my business and while washing my hands it turned off.

gammon-coach-house-batavia,Kate S.,dusTjejo-paMGftxIw7yBg,FVIZ_gSRP_KOzr6XOIU28A,"I used to live down the street from the Gammon Coach House, and love it like my own boozy little child. The food selection is amazing, especially rib nights on Saturdays and the sweet potato tater tots. The menu covers everything from fish and chips to pulled chicken to monster salads.

But what really got me hooked was the beer selection. I signed up for their text notification club, and get a text whenever a new beer is tapped. Most of my visits were because of those texts. Their beer selection is mix of local mainstay (3 Floyds, Revolution, Two Brothers) and some from the outer reaches of the galaxy (Portland, generally). There is a variety of sizes, so you don&#39;t have to break the bank to try something new.

There are a few downsides. The inside is kind of cramped and dark. There is a good amount of seating, but if you&#39;re waiting for a table on a busy night, there&#39;s nowhere to stand that&#39;s out of the way. I always had to do the shuffle dance with incoming guests. This also means the wait can get kind of long, but a good beer is an easy remedy. Downsides, yes. Deal-breakers, not on  your life.

I&#39;ll put it this way- when my down-the-street lease was up, I almost didn&#39;t move purely because of the Gammon Coach House.",14/11/13,147,4,1,4,-18,3.0688,1.7950000000000002,0.0,14.205,No,1260
gammon-coach-house-batavia,Jessica G.,M4FeQH6Ykr9FJb0PfmwNkw,SfWWNDLiQ9b9KGjADLd97Q,"This is a solid 4 for the beverage menu.  

** I haven&#39;t tried the food and from what I understand, it&#39;s pretty standard bar fare.  I don&#39;t think you should go there to eat, though - I think you should go there to enjoy fantastic beverages.  Because nobody should drink bad beer, IMO.  

Belly up to the bar or, if it&#39;s nice outside, go and sit at one of the tables on the little patio.  This is not a large place - it might be kind of crowded.  Either way, you will find a fairly random, and yet fantastic, assortment of beers.  It&#39;s not exactly what one would expect for the looks of the place or the location.  Keep in mind, at least from yesterday to today, the beer menu on the website is only a portion of what they had in last night.  It seems like a place to go to see what is new and interesting, which is a good thing in my book.  I mean who else has bottles of the Game of Thrones beer?

I also like that you can get a sample size, a slightly larger size or a regular-sized pour of beer.  I like to try all the things so it&#39;s nice to be able to try a lot of different tastes without being stuck with something I don&#39;t like.  

Decent service and the bartender was both funny and had really good recommendations.  A definite bonus, though the service outside on the patio might have been a little odd, though not terrible.

If this place wasn&#39;t so far away, I could see it being a pretty regular hangout.",13/07/13,165,4,3,5,58,5.803,2.747,0.45499999999999996,12.798,No,1446
gammon-coach-house-batavia,Tom K.,UGplAYsYC65eE83ADoZ2Jw,pfiicvkRJJq1SYT5900_yQ,"UPDATE: the cook now uses a subtle bell when orders are up. They added hat/coat/purse hooks at your bar seats that are very convenient. Also, beers are now served in 8, 11.5 and 14 oz glasses of your choice, unless it is a strong ale.

I was in the Gammon Coach House the first day it opened.  They offer craft beer &amp; comfort food.  I go to a bar for craft beer on tap.  I have plenty of bottles at home (many I have brewed myself). 

This place is a circa 1886 building behind a large Victorian mansion at the corner of Wilson and Batavia Ave.  Walking in, there is a vestibule to keep the winter cold out that pushes into the room.  The small 6-seat bar is 2 steps from the door. To the right is a nook of 2 bar height tables; to the left there are 3 bar height tables. The bar only seats 6.  There are 24 seats in this room and a back room that seats about 24.  GCH also has seating for 30 on a patio.  There is 1 TV for all to see  in the front room, and 1 in the back room.  There is sports on TV, no sound, with music playing (they put the Sox on at my request).  My favorite seat at any pub is at the corner or short side of the bar.  This place only has a straight bar, the short side has a garbage can and a stack of glasses and servers work from that end.  They could use a bigger bar, but space is limited.
 
The room has a lot of wood. The floor has a wood look, the north wall looks to be the original wood plank wall with single pane grid windows, The ceiling is wood plank.  It feels warm and cozy. The only problem is there is an opening to the kitchen with bright lights from the kitchen shining into this warm room, the cooks radio can be heard, and the cooks repeated yelling &#34;burger up&#34;.  They need a better method to notify food is ready, and doors to block off the kitchen&#39;s intrusion into the bar atmosphere. 

OK, Brad is the beer tender. He is very knowledgeable regarding craft beer and seems to be able to discuss any brewery in the country. I later learned he is a brew master.  They have 12 taps, but 2-4 are wasted on tasteless beers. They do have a very nice selection of brews in the remaining 8 taps.  Beers are sold in the standard 11.5 oz glass for around $4.80.  Now, the usual 14 oz glasses limit me to 2 beers to be legal to drive.  You could enjoy a variety 3 of these ales at a relaxed pace, and drive under the limit. They have a minimalist, but satisfying menu of build your own burger, build your own thin crust pizza, chill, wings and things.  I tried a burger and it was satisfying,  I ordered medium and it was medium, not bloody. Fries are good too. not too skinny, not to fat; slightly crispy on the outside with patatoey flavor inside. 

Over all, the place is great!  Great beer, good food ,knowledgeable beer tender, friendly crowd and it is only 4 blocks from my house.",08/09/11,340,4,1,5,-43,6.5798000000000005,4.353999999999999,0.892,29.753,No,2837

You&#39;ll definitely want to keep your favorite map app open if you haven&#39;t been here.  The place itself is small.  There&#39;s a small bar area with seating for about 20 people, then another room in back with room for another 30.  The place is super quaint and has really good, positive energy.  

The main attraction here is the beer.  They have 12 highly unusual taps running, stuff I have not seen since the Wheaton Ale Fest.  All super wonderful brews, and they serve small, medium, and large (a full pint) sizes of beer.  This is a cool option if you want to taste everything they are featuring.  They also had a really impressive list of bottled beer, stuff you don&#39;t see every day. The bartenders and waitstaff are super cool and love to talk about the choices.

Foodwise, the menu is pretty limited but what they have looked great.  I ended up having a hankering for grilled cheese.  I did mine with cheddar, tomato, and bacon.  Sure, it&#39;s a cholesterol bomb, but every once in a while it&#39;s fun to splurge.  After we ordered my GF was shocked I hadn&#39;t checked Yelp reviews yet.  Of course, when she dares me I&#39;m going to have to check.  Sure enough, some other Yelpers tipped that we should have gotten the sweet potato tots instead of the regular ones.  Next time, although for what it&#39;s worth the regular ones were awesome.

A short bike ride up a somewhat daunting hill later, we hit the Coach House, grabbed a seat in the outdoor patio, and ordered a Trim job, Wild Man, MoM, and a Mexican (guess you had to be there, the server had us laughing).

gammon-coach-house-batavia,Dorothy P.,#NAME?,5_6tFLlRcynu2p-eH882LQ,"What the Gammon Coach House lacks in size, it more than makes up for in food, beer, and service.  My husband stumbled onto this place (thanks, Yelp), in an attempt to find a decent Friday fish fry (thank you, Lent).  He decided that we should give it a try solely based on 1.) finding it decently reviewed on Yelp and 2.) the photos of the food on their website.  I can&#39;t stress how small this place is, but then again, when you&#39;re called &#34;coach house,&#34; I guess you can&#39;t expect much bigger than a shoebox.  The atmosphere is quite charming, very pub-like.  There are a few tables in the front &amp; a small separate dining area in the back as well as a bar with a handful of barstools.  The beer menu is extensive, filled with interesting sounding craft beers, and the food menu is simple and straightforward.  I appreciate that.  The fish fry was excellent, and what&#39;s more, I was able to order tater tots instead of fries (oooooh yes).  For $11, I got 3 fat pieces of battered cod, and mound of tater tots, and a heap of pretty tasty cole slaw.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of slaw, especially when it&#39;s mayo-based, but this stuff was fresh and pretty tasty.  The service was a bit slow, but it was a Friday night, and there were only 2 servers.  I had to ask twice for a glass of water, but only once for a refill on the hot water for my Numi organic tea (yum).  Overall, my dining companion and I were quite satisfied with our experience at Gammon Coach House, so much so that we are already deciding when we&#39;ll come here again.

Parking -- there&#39;s plenty of room to park on either side of Wilson St. that runs alongside Gammon Coach House.

Lay-Out -- it&#39;s a little smaller inside, but not wall-to-wall people.  When it&#39;s warmer outside, you can also enjoy a pint on their patio.  There&#39;s a backroom with additional seating as well.  Some people are turned off by it not having a huge open floor plan, but that&#39;s how the building was made.  Back in the 90s, it used to be a sports card shop, so they&#39;ve done a pretty job opening it up as much as the building would allow them to.

Food -- I can only speak to the pizzas and once I had their fish.  The pizzas are good, with a crispy crust and the right amount of cheese.  The fish was good as well.

Beer -- the main reason I go is their selection of craft beers.  I&#39;m a huge fan of Three Floyds, Two Brothers, as well as some southern California IPAs such as Stone that they have.  Great stuff.

Service -- Service has been attentive and friendly in my visits there.  One server seemed a little frazzled on a busy night (perhaps they were shorthanded or something), but otherwise, I&#39;ve never had a problem.  They could do a better job wearing some sort of T-shirt or something to identify themselves.  Sometimes you can&#39;t tell if they&#39;re an employee or not.

Prices -- Are a little steep for Batavia, at least for the craft beers.  I can&#39;t recall prices on the food though.

Bathrooms -- were clean and functioning.  No graffiti, cracked mirrors or King Size Snickers bars in the toilets that management hadn&#39;t taken care of yet. Woo hoo!

TVs -- they have some by the bar, but this really isn&#39;t a sports bar.  If you&#39;re looking for something like Buffalo Wild Wings, you got the wrong place.",19/12/13,207,4,1,5,0,5.7090000000000005,4.574000000000001,0.469,18.956999999999997,No,1837

-Great bartender (white collarded shirt, black vest, tiny glasses. I trust anyone dressed this way).
-Fantastic beer selection. Anyone who likes to branch out and try new brews will love GCH. They pride theirselves on their beer rotation, so you won&#39;t find the same beers very often. And you can order a sample size (probably about 8oz) for like $2. Can&#39;t beat that!
-Out of about 9 beers on tap, they only have one spout for Bud Lite.

gammon-coach-house-batavia,Terrence B.,823Zym9t_bGQ96TbDu6BUw,i0LFT_UzNS4u9DGY_YTWug,"So this is a newer establishment that definitely fills a much needed niche for the area:  quality beer.  I&#39;ve been here a number of times since they first opened but always fairly late to meet up with friends for a beer or 2.  The draft list has been 90% different on each visit.  While I have had 80% of the beers previously that they had offered (I am a beer nerd), most I have never seen on tap.  While most would not be considered trending ultra-hot beer nerd brews, it is always a fantastic, well though out lineup of difficult to find beers.  Their bottle list I think could step up a notch in their offerings.  They could also benefit by offering a couple high-end large format beers on the menu (last visit they did have Goose Island Kind Edward and Bourbon County Coffee Stout which is a good step in the right direction).

My last visit I was there for dinner which was an interesting change of pace for seeing how they operate as a restaurant.  The place is pretty small and littered with vintage farmhouse tables and chairs which can be a tight fit but definitely cozy to sit at.  When the evening gets later and the drinking crowd comes out, these tables are quite a hindrance.  The scene during dinner was definitely all families dining with their adult &#34;children&#34;.

The food is comfort food and quite good.  The chips and salsa are homemade and were devoured instantly.  The grill cheese was more than your average offering with cheese that was also slapped to the outside and charred = delicious.  The patty melt was advertised to include grilled onions which werent delivered, it was non-the-less great.  I paired it with Greenbush&#39;s Retribution which is an offering you won&#39;t find elsewhere and a perfect match.

The odd: all beers are offered in 2 or 3 different sizes (with large being a pint glass) with prices like 4.35 and 5.15 which its nice to see them conscientious on their offering price, its a bit of a head scratcher in the bar world.

This is a place I will continue to frequent often.",13/02/12,222,4,2,5,49,6.189900000000001,2.479,0.371,14.149999999999999,No,2036

My wife and I headed here on a date night without our son so we could enjoy some adult time.  Really glad we did.  The extensive beer selection also rotates micro/custom brews and if you sign up for their text message service you&#39;ll get notification when new ones are coming in or when special brews are going to make their appearance.

We started with the mini-calzones appetizer and they were pretty good.  Only complaint was that the red sauce that comes with it was cold and could have been warmed a little.

I had a burger with pepper jack, bacon and a fried egg.  It was made to order (medium rare).  You get your choice of fries, tots or sweet potato tots.  Had never seen sweet tater tots before and they were fantastic!!

My wife had the longhorn grilled cheese which they use a Parmesan cheese coating on the outside.  She really liked it a lot and also had the sweet tater tots.

We left with full tummies and ready for the rest of the evening.  Yes, the knock on the Gammon Coach House might be their limited menu, difficult location and small size but as I&#39;ve said before in other reviews, if you can do a few things and do them excellently, that&#39;s a win versus doing a million things half-baked.

The biggest fault of the Gammon Coach House is the service. Its hit or miss, and has been mostly miss for me. Many times the server will dissapear for quite awhile while our beer glasses sit empty, or at one point after ordering our beer from our waitress, we saw it sitting on the end of the bar for at least 10 min. before it finally found its way to us. I don&#39;t think I can take any friends here since the service is embarrassing.

The food isn&#39;t bad - but I wish they would expand their menu. The grilled cheese has been quite good the number of times I&#39;ve tried it (and the order was correct). The pulled pork is nothing to write home about - but again I&#39;d like to see a bit more variety on the menu.

UPDATE 1-3-14: I&#39;ve visited Gammon a number of times since my initial review and things have gotten much better there. The beer selection has been wonderful each time, and I think the service has improved quite a bit as well. The food menu is fairly stagnant still - its mostly basic bar food, I&#39;d like some more non-greasy/fried items to go with such good beer.

When I first went this place was fairly new, but now it seems like they&#39;re getting comfortable and lax in their efforts.  But worst of all, I was there one night when a mentally challenged individual came in.  One of the tables started harassing and belittling the individual.  When another table attempted to defend the mentally challenged man, the staff asked that table to leave.  They asked the table defending the mentally challenged man to leave.  Why?

I&#39;ve lived in the Pacific NW for quite some time and was exposed to some of the best craft beer in the country.  Now I&#39;m lucky enough to live in the Great Lakes region where we have equally as good craft brews just not quite as many options.  BUT thanks to The Gammon Coach House I can experience all my favorites and try some new ones without having to leave my hometown of Batavia.  It&#39;s true good to be true but yes...Batavia finally has a pub worth raving about.  GCH is a nice spot to enjoy high quality craft brew with a solid pub menu.  They just opened so I think they are still working out some kinks but overall they&#39;re on the right track.  I&#39;ve visited GCH about 5 times now and continue to enjoy the experience.  The food menu is a bit limited but the if you&#39;re in the mood for a quality burger or flat bread pizza then you&#39;ll be fine.  The burgers are better here than at the rival Geneva Ale House!  They also have sweet potato tater tots which are way better than their cousin the sweet potato fries.  They serve 10 beers on tap (sometimes they may be out of one or two of the hot sellers) and a host of bottles.  They could probably expand the bottle selection a bit but I prefer draft beer so I don&#39;t really mind.  They have two LCD TV&#39;s where you&#39;ll find a prime time football or baseball game on but watching sports isn&#39;t the main attraction here.  Save that for Buffalo Wild Wings.  Their patio is pretty big but with only a handful of nice days left in the year you better enjoy it while it lasts.  The service is pretty good but it&#39;s getting better.  The two girls behind the bar, Melmo and Nora, are great.  

The one think I&#39;d like to see is some drink options for kids.  Maybe some apple juice, lemonade, milk and a plastic cup option.  I&#39;m not suggesting they go over board with a full kids menu option or anything but it would be nice to have an alternative to glassware and the orange juice and water they serve to kids today.  I&#39;ll be watching to see if they change this up.  If they don&#39;t then I&#39;ll have to assume they&#39;re intentionally not catering to kids which would be sad because Batavia is a family oriented town.  I&#39;d hate to have to limit my business because I couldn&#39;t have my 6 year old join me for a burger and some tater tots!  

I really hope they continue with the quality beer and food selection I&#39;ve seen so far.  If they do then there&#39;s no doubt GCH will be a big success for Batavia and the surrounding Fox Valley area!",04/10/11,277,4,3,5,57,8.286999999999999,4.94,0.9990000000000001,20.060999999999996,No,2610

We visited on a Friday night to try the fish. We sat outside on the cute little patio out front. So far so good. The menu is not extensive, but we were just there to try the fish, so it didn&#39;t really matter. I decided to try the baked cod instead of the traditional fried variety, as I was trying to be good. The waitress came by to take our drink orders and explained that did not have baked cod that night - instead there was a tilapia dish with mushroom polenta. Ok, no big deal. I decide to go with the fried fish. One of my companions tried to order a non-alcoholic beer, which they do not have. Oops. I asked for a kids menu for my four year old, and the waitress explained that they don&#39;t have one. She said most kids just order the pizza or hot dog from the regular menu. We decided on the macaroni and cheese for him (side order - $4). I hate paying for macaroni and cheese since it&#39;s so cheap to make at home, especially when doesn&#39;t come with anything else, but I digress...

The food came out fairly quickly, and everything was nice and hot. The fish itself was good, but the batter was super thick, and reminded us of a corn dog. The fries were good, but the coleslaw looked like it was made quite a while ago. It was starting to brown, and the carrots on top looked dry. I asked the waitress (very nicely) if there was any fresh coleslaw, and she told me it&#39;s a vinegar coleslaw and not a creamy one, and that it had been refrigerated (basically telling me I was wrong to think there was anything wrong with it). Um, ok. She said she could bring me another one, but at that point I just decided to skip it altogether. At the end of our meal, we all had piles of breading on our plates and no one had touched the coleslaw. 

One final experience that sort of capped off the evening. I believe there are apartments or offices of some sort above the restaurant. While we were sitting on the patio, someone came out of a door that opens right onto the patio with a bag of garbage. I&#39;m pretty sure they worked/lived there, and weren&#39;t a restaurant employee, but it&#39;s still kind of gross to have someone carry garbage through a restaurant. Even if it is outside.

dominicks-villa-rosa-pizzeria-schaumburg-2,Kaitlin L.,i54OhUsXUZCDfU9H41hGug,SPwLLDWNdpJ8Z8HNK5eHOg,"TERRIBLE!!! We catered a graduation party from Dominicks. Let me start off by saying the staff who answered the phone were not helpful. We placed the order 1 week in advance the package was for twenty people we only had about 17 so we were content with having plenty of food for everyone. (BE AWARE it is deceiving, it says it feeds 20 but once you question them on it they are real quick to change their story and definition of what twenty people look like.) The gentlemen who took my order reminded my 5 times that he was doing us a favor by delivering and we BETTER take care of the driver, we agreed of course we were never planning on not tipping the driver. Today was delivery day and apparently they don&#39;t know what 20 people look like. There was no way what they delivered would have ever fed twenty people.  We called concerned that they might have forgotten some trays but were rudely told that was a lot of food and if we need more we  can order and pay for more. Unsatisfied with this place. I have never been treated so rudely. We have corporate events and birthdays almost every month and are always catering from restaurants at least once a month.  We took a risk and tried a new restaurant this was a terrible experience. Food is bland and barely enough to feed ten let alone twenty. I cant believe we spent $237 dollars for something that we could have gotten somewhere else that valued their customers. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT.",22/06/16,151,1,2,-2,24,-2.271,0.894,3.3470000000000004,11.758999999999999,No,1463

The thing about dealing with a business is that even when the customer may not agree with certain business practices such as pricing or policies on delivery, it is about the customer service received from those who are representing the business that makes or breaks the experience. From the moment my colleague called this restaurant to place our order, the service has been distasteful. We placed a very large catering order for an event we held at work. The order was placed a week in advance to accommodate the restaurant and give them time to prepare. Placing the order was extremely interesting to say the least. The gentleman taking our order was rude and short. He made it seem as though he was doing us a favor by delivering and in doing so we better not stiff the driver. HOW INSULTING!?!?!?!?!  If that wasn&#39;t enough, after the food was delivered (delivery was on time and the driver was outstanding actually!) and we were able to see what our $237 had purchased us, it was just downhill from there. This was supposed to be a party package that fed 20 people. There was no way that was possible. We had to cut food in half in order to accommodate our group. They gave us a pan of ribs, pan of fried and baked chicken that looked as though it fed a party of 4 let alone 20!!! After our discovery, we gave the establishment a call back to explain that what we received no where equated to what we paid. The &#34;owner/manager&#34; went off. He told us that was we got was what we paid for and he was sure it fed 20. If there was more that was needed then we could call him back to order more. He attacked us immediately instead of addressing our concern with why we felt as though what we received wasn&#39;t what was promised. And if not to make matters worse, when my colleague took to Yelp to post her experience, the owner replied with &#34;I knew you were going to be a problem the moment you called&#34; SERIIOUSLY?!?! I have never dealt with such nastiness in a business owner in my life. I would not recommend this company/establishment to anyone.

While driving home from work and on a whim, I decided to have pizza for dinner. I stopped into a strip mall area. I am glad that it did!

As a walk-in, the young lady who took my order, informed me it was going to be at least 20 through 25 minute wait.  The next time I order from here that will be way too long (mainly because I will be greatly coveting with an eager desire for its completion)! What a solidly wonderful pizza! 

One of the best crusts I can remember. It was flaky and firm and but not like cardboard. It was rather light while being strong. The sauce is a little sweet for my personal  taste, but the garlic and hint of pepper give it just enough so it&#39;s not too sweet. The cheese is high-quality and you can tell. Very well melted and very good texture along with solid taste.

I ordered a meat lovers pizza;16 inch. The toppings were distributed just right, in my opinion. There was not a heaping mount of meat yet it was evenly distributed and you could taste a little of everything on every piece, in every bite. 

As a former pizza maker myself, I really have to give these people kudos. They do pizza right! I will return to this place again in the near near future. In my opinion a job well-done!",12/03/14,146,4,3,5,71,4.9735000000000005,3.4719999999999995,0.55,15.978,No,1294

The amazing customer service was only half of it! The pizza itself? It was amazing. It had a very light, flaky crust, but it still managed to hold the ingredients.

They have amazing wings! They are full of meat, so moist and flavorful. The BBQ flavor on the wings is so incredibly tasty! Everyone at my company was in agreement that these were the best wings we have had on our quest for wings delivered. The regular flavor is just plain like chicken nuggies or naked wings. The mild was very mild with just a very slight hint of heat. I&#39;m super weak with spicy flavors and had no problem eating a couple of the milds. I didn&#39;t dare touch the inferno but I heard those weren&#39;t quite as spicy as they had predicted. Overall, great tasting wings!!!

However, I was glad to learn that the grocery chain and this location aren&#39;t related; think about your Yelp friends Mike S. and Mike G. they have the same first name, but probably aren&#39;t in the same family tree. 
[Note: no need to check your friend list for the Mikes, they&#39;re on there...I checked.]

Regardless, Dominick&#39;s Villa Rosa Pizzeria is my new pizza place. It&#39;s Yelp official. I have only eaten one pizza from here, so it&#39;s a bold statement, but I felt strongly about it. 
Not to down play the deliciousness of their pizza, but there isn&#39;t much else around for a quick, stop-on-the-way-home-from-work pizza place. The one I discovered closed, and DVRP was next on the list so I gave it a try and found it to be a success. The pizza itself was very good, even better than the place I mentioned that closed, what confused me was the name (which is why it wasn&#39;t initially first on my list). 
I really liked the sauce to cheese ratio, and the flavors were on point so it really hit home for being a nostalgic pie. We tried the sausage pizza which was/is/always will be a staple selection in pizza toppings with my family, but  I wouldn&#39;t mind trying some other options. I very much look forward to the trial and error process of determining what the best toppings are.....also, where do I sign up for that job?? I want to make that my career.

Unimpressive and humble front entrance lead to an even more unassuming space filled with a scattering of tables and chairs.  Orders are taken at the counter and food is then delivered table side.  

I arrived at around 2:15 pm on a Tuesday and as I asked what was good, the guy said, &#34;our daily specials&#34; but then informed me many were sold out as he wiped the specials off the dry erase board.  Bummer.  

So I asked &#34;what else is good.&#34;. He talked me into the Reuben, one of my go to sandwich orders.  He assured me that the bread was homemade, the corned beef slow cooked insight, and the coleslaw made in house.  Cool.

I could have added a mini homemade pie to my order, but I resisted despite the lovely strawberry rhubarb pie that was looking at me from the counter by the register.

Sandwich came quick.  Good crust on the grilled bread.  Good ratio of meat, sauerkraut, cheese, and bread.  Only complaint was the sandwich was a bit too salty.  Others here on Yelp have remarked the same and I concur.  I was glad I had the side of slaw as it&#39;s sweetness and creaminess balanced off the salt.  Perhaps they should serve the slaw alongside the Reuben all the time (it cost me an extra $1.50). 

I was checked on a few times and appreciated the attention.  

I would come back, for sure.  But would get here earlier and before those specials were wiped off the board.

Update:

I thought I would bring a group of friends there to have lunch. NO SOUP FOR YOU! Does anyone remember that Sienfeld? I first was told I had to order off the menu, NO changes, except bread. Ok! Then I requested a turkey sandwich, off the menu, sheepishly, I asked if they could please hold the mayonnaise. BIG MISTAKE! He schooled me! Telling me that they just came off a huge lunch rush and everyone liked what was on his menu, and if I can&#39;t find anything on the menu, it must not be the right restaurant for me.  ARE YOU KIDDING? Of coarse we left. Talking to people, I have come to find out that the owner has a reputation for not being the friendliest person.

franks-karma-cafe-wauconda,Craig S.,saP1a3JBsNgKz4rMrjOoPw,A_6O-ZJusHYRWXqLGPeyzA,"I have eaten at Frank&#39;s Karma for many years (but never as often as I would like). All of their sandwiches and desserts are amazing. During certain times of the year and on certain days, they have Marshall Field&#39;s recipe for chicken pot pie. It is a delicious dish, but you need to come early or pre-order, since they make small batches and popular menu items sell out quickly.

Andrew (up front) and Cliff (running the back of the house) are really nice people, and they take great pride in the meals they serve. I am also quite sure Andrew actually knows every person in Wauconda and knows all about them. Cliff is a true artisan when it comes to the food. I hoped to beat the odds and get a pot pie today, but the gastric gods had other plans. I ordered a pizza sandwich on focaccia (one of the daily specials). Look for the picture I posted of it, and imagine it tastes even better than it looks (and that is a handsome sammich!). I know I enjoy my meal when, during my last bite, I have the pang of disappointment that my food is now gone. I experienced that today, and it&#39;s not the first time I have felt that way after lunch at Frank&#39;s Karma Cafe.

Their location is small and intimate, only a handful of tables (which are nearly always occupied when I come). Dining on the patio in season.

franks-karma-cafe-wauconda,Melanie R.,cGwHTbE59i493TFKqM99Iw,47snCT8g71IOoqPH6tNpdA,"I ate here again today, along with my mother. We were really disappointed with the food this time. We both had one of the specials: I had the grilled chicken avocado mango salad and my mom had the Siracha Foccacia Club.

My salad was a plate full of dark green lettuce (romaine?) - and that was it as far as the salad part. No mixed greens, which would&#39;ve been nice. The lettuce was topped on one side with a few chunks of thick cubed chicken. Definitely not grilled as the description says. This was like the middle of a thick, chewy chicken breast (gross). On the other side of the greens was a bunch of cubed mango pieces. That was the best part of this &#34;salad&#34;. It was served on the side with some kind of dressing that I have no idea what it was. Had no flavor whatsoever. It was a little dish of oil with some herbs floating around in it. Franks - please, please at least learn the proper way to make a vinaigrette! This salad was NOT worth $11.

My mom&#39;s sandwich was mostly thick focaccia. There was one thin slice of deli turkey meat, as far as the turkey portion of the sandwich went. We were surprised that it wasn&#39;t &#34;real&#34; turkey. Anyone can put a piece of cheap, crappy deli meat on bread. And what was with the one measly slice? The only good thing about this sandwich was the bread and the aioli sauce.

One more negative: we got to Franks at 11:30. We wanted to beat the lunch crowd. They were already sold out of the egg salad (a special). So, word to the wise: if there&#39;s a menu item on the daily special that you REALLY have your heart set on, pre-order it over the phone or online. 

The only positive: My mom got a blueberry pie and she had a piece after lunch and said it was delicious. She would know - she&#39;s been an expert homemade pie maker for 50 years.",30/07/15,214,2,1,2,-6,1.8698000000000001,2.37,1.7810000000000001,22.849000000000004,No,1815

Having worked in a similar sandwich shop in College, the policy on substitutions is probably in place because they are trying for a certain texture or taste with a particular menu item. Let&#39;s face it- the only reason Burger King has &#34;have it your way&#34; is to bring in parents of petulant children. Frank&#39;s is a Cafe geared more to adults- and BK certainly doesn&#39;t have 30+ sandwiches on their board of fare.

Also worth mentioning is the drink menu; Frank&#39;s is one of the few deli-sandwich shops that I know of that offers an &#34;Arnold Palmer&#34; (which is half lemonade and half iced tea). One of the people in our group ordered a raspberry smoothie and declared it &#34;yumlicious&#34;.

Miss Vickie&#39;s chips are one of my favorite brands and Frank&#39;s has them in several flavors. I&#39;d encourage you to try the vinegar and sea salt chips...

I didn&#39;t try their desserts but they certainly looked tempting- next visit I will splurge and get something sweet.

The only possible negative that I can give is that there is only one (inside) table that seats 4, the others all being for 2. I feel that this is balanced in good weather by the two picnic tables provided outside for those who prefer al fresco or are smokers.

Even though parking is listed as &#34;street&#34;, Frank&#39;s is steps from a good-sized municipal parking lot.

Their pies are so good that my husband and I plan to travel up to their place just for pies in the future. Quick note about the pies: they are all fresh, home made, filling, and just absolutely amazing. Seriously. Baker&#39;s Square has nothing on a place like this. 

The owners, Cliff and Andrew, are great. They worked with me and my husband via phone, email, and in person, getting everything right. The pies are all home made and their recommendations of pies per season should be paid attention to--we wanted 2 pumpkin pies, but since pumpkin is not in season in April, they recommend sweet potato and no one knew the difference. We had 13 pies and 2 cheesecakes for 134 guests and every bite was eaten! There was no waste and just enough.  

One phenomenal note about their service: Cliff called me the morning on the day before the wedding (my mom was going to pick up the pies later that day), and he offered, at no additional cost, to bake the pies the next morning, the day of the wedding, and to drop them off at the venue itself on the wedding day so the pies would be fresh that day, instead of 1 day old.

I guess it&#39;s perfectly fine to younger generations, but the idea of trying to squeeze &#34;ambiance&#34; into a former yogurt shop or dry cleaner just seems a stretch to me.

The Chubby Bullfrog sees itself as a sports bar, with the usual memorabilia perched on the walls, and a couple dozen NHL jerseys hanging from the ceilings.  Five TVs ring the bar, and four video poker machines are perched in the corner.

The owner has decided there is no local lunch crowd, so they open at 3 PM  most days.   With the exception of there being alligator bites and frog legs on the menu, it&#39;s straightforward standard  Chicago bar food.

It will come as a surprise to absolutely nobody that I had a burger, which are hand-formed patties in your choice of 6, 8, or 10 ounces,  on a fresh &#39;pretzel-like&#39; roll, and topped with Spanish onion, tomato, lettuce, accompanied by a kosher spear.  I say &#34;pretzel-like&#34; as it has the appearance of a pretzel roll, but not the cloying sweet taste most buns of that ilk possess, which I find unpleasant.

Fries or chips are standard, upgrade to tots, rings or a salad for a buck.  About $11 in all for the 8 ounce, with bacon and blue cheese.  The bacon was very flavorful, and while the blue cheese was a chunky sauce, is was very &#34;blue,&#34; strong in flavor, which was a delight for me.

At some point in every burger experience, I strip everything away to taste just the beef, and this is a nice grind, very flavorful, natural  beef flavor, with a slight char.  The deep fried tots were exceptional.  Pepsi soda products and a gajillion beers in bottles.",30/11/14,200,4,1,2,-21,1.2924,0.7290000000000001,0.487,12.784,No,1697

Visit #2 was horrible, they claimed to be smoking some meat but the restaurant was full burning chemical type smell that only got worse and worse as we sat there.

Both times the food was completely unremarkable.

We went on a Saturday afternoon around 4:30pm. I had accidently stumbled across TCBF while searching for a new place to try on line.

I went with my wife and a friend of ours of whom we go out to eat with quite often. We walked in the door and I did not see a sign indicating whether we should seat ourselves or not. The bar had 6 patrons seated at it and there was only one table on the floor that was occupied by one person.

I got the bartender&#39;s attention and asked if we could seat ourselves. She was very polite and told we could sit wherever we liked. With-in seconds after the bartender telling us that a patron at the bar felt as though he needed to stand and point to each empty table and yell &#34;except that one, and that one, and that one&#34; until he covered all the tables. I picked the first table he pointed at and told him that I was going to sit there just because he said not to. I don&#39;t know he felt the need to say that but it pissed me off.

I ordered the frog legs and gator bites apps for the table. The frog legs were very greasy and left a strange film on our teeth. The gator bites were decent but there is more breading then gator meat.

For dinner I ordered a bacon blue cheese burger and ordered it medium well. Burger was cooked well done (which I really don&#39;t mind). The burger was oozing grease!! The meat had a weird texture. I think it may be twice ground. 

My wife ordered a club sandwich. Looked good to me. I did not try it at dinner but did eat the half that she took home the next day and was good.

Our friend ordered a grilled cheese with ham. (He orders this same sandwich wherever he can) and said he has had better.

The patrons at the bar were quite obviously regulars. Which is cool by me but they were extremely obnoxious and we felt as if we were not welcome.

The bartender was our waitress and was very polite and we were very satisfied with her service.

I usually try a new place three times before I post a negative review to give them a chance.

I just so happened to be sitting just in front of your beloved on the night in question and not for nothing but it didn&#39;t go down quite the way the wife had reported. 
 It is possible that the way the message given was not done so with a dozen roses but Mike (the owner) was very up front with the fact it was standing room only and if she was okay with standing she needed to do so out of a high traffic area. Let me preface this by saying, the time in question was 3 minutes left in the first at a Hockey Bar were everyone but you and your wife is dripping in BLACKHAWKS swag. So I&#39;m not sure witch one of you had the brilliant idea of trying to come in to a Hockey Bar (during playoffs) to try and get a seat. 
Well, at least we may be able to chalk this up to a learning experience and know for next time.
  If you had come in early enough to get a table for the game, you might have had the chance to experience why I and my family and friends go in to the Frog. Mike and his entire team are like minded in understanding customers come first. Mike happens to be one of the most gracious people I know... He contributes to the community with fundraisers, He donated to our community Youth Football Team  (Jr. Chargers) and most of all he cares.... 
  Overall thanks for the input, as a business man myself I&#39;m constantly looking for  opportunity&#39;s to straighten my team.  I got a feeling the learning from this will help to do so...

It&#39;s in a strip mall not really near other lively stores or a major intersection. Walked in at 3pm and not a single person was there. Ate our food and left 45minutes later. In that whole time, we were the only two people in the restaurant. Felt kind of awkward eating there with nobody else at all. Might be more a product of its location in West Dundee. Just a minor complaint, but the food was fine, the place was clean, and the waiter that served us was great.",20/10/15,60,4,2,2,23,1.5802,1.085,0.214,6.7010000000000005,No,494
the-chubby-bullfrog-bar-and-grill-west-dundee,Ryan H.,8_KZjp0X5BLyMH3_Cuiezw,gpxkFah09_P7phXLzlI_Qg,"I&#39;ve been meaning to write this review for some time.  

From time to time, they have a chicken dinner special that is outstanding.  Three pieces of chicken and fries for $10.  The chicken always comes out piping hot and has excellent flavor.  Someone told me that the flavor is the result of frying the chicken in the same oil they use for the frog legs (yuck) but I can&#39;t verify that either way.  In any case, great chicken, even if that exquisite flavor flavor I am picking up is that of frog guts.  I have also tried the pulled pork sandwich which was very good.  

Liquor prices are a bit high, so I usually have only a beer or two and cannot comment on anything beyond that.  

One negative I will mention, is the cole slaw.  Each meal usually comes with a big heaping bowl of cole slaw.  Let me tell you, this cole slaw is the most retched, disgusting stuff I have ever tasted.  Holy crap.  Making a good cole slaw is so ridiculously easy, I just can&#39;t imagine why they would want to plate up this concoction when everything else on the menu is generally decent.  

I don&#39;t consider Chubby Bullfrog to be in my regular rotation, but I will check in there from time to time when the chicken special is on the menu.  I did have one experience with one particularly snarky server there which was a bit of a turnoff for me.  I promptly re-seated to a different servers section and that was that.  If you decide to go, ask to be seated in Jenn&#39;s section and she will take great care of you.  And, for heaven sakes, hold the g** d*** cole slaw!",14/10/13,177,3,1,5,-11,5.1611,2.873,1.26,13.867000000000003,No,1565

immediately with the menu and took our order for drinks.

Since I decided to have fish, I asked the server if the batter on the fish was thick or thin, since
I don&#39;t like thick batter as is served in many restaurants.  She explained that it was thin...I said to give me one order of three pieces vs all one can eat.  My wife ordered another item from the menu and was satisfied with her order.

The fish was served hot with a perfectly browned thin batter coating. I was struck with the
appearance of the plate with perfect colored fries and a container of coleslaw.  The fish
was flaky and hot. (Not mushy and overcooked like many places).  The coleslaw has good flavor without all of the usual juicy liquids.  I was impressed and satisfied that the food was perfectly prepared. 

Our server was excellent from start to finish.  We are looking for another visit.",20/07/15,118,5,2,4,16,3.4583999999999997,2.177,0.172,11.652,No,1048

If you are there during a hockey game and would like to watch another game - any game - prepare to go somewhere else.  In fact, the owner said as much - no beating around the bush.  So, we did.  This was prior to the playoffs.  

There are multiple TVs, but no flexibility.  I was told that the system isn&#39;t set up to show different channels (or something to that effect), but until the game started, it was showing different games.  

I get it, you want to have a hockey bar.  There are other sports games though.  Play the audio of the hockey game and show it on most of your TVs.  There is nothing wrong with another game on a silent TV.

I&#39;ve been here twice.  I&#39;m not sure if there will be a third time.  When I am told that I would be happier elsewhere, I can&#39;t argue with that.",27/04/14,98,2,1,2,-2,1.0135999999999998,1.271,0.796,12.933,No,867

First things first, they have Molson on draft... and they&#39;re a hockey bar (they go hand in hand). That made me happy. The staff was good. I had the nachos (no meat) as an appetizer. I was not impressed with them though. Too much lettuce and not enough other stuff for me. I could really just do without the lettuce. I then tried the sliders (because I wanted to try a variety). I had one of each, pulled pork, shredded chicken, and burger. All three were quite tasty. I did prefer the chipotle sauce over the honey bbq. My friend had a wrap and was disappointed. So, i&#39;d stick with the normal bar and grill type food. The Molson was great. I went there again another time after that. Food was still good.

And there&#39;s really not much to say here. It&#39;s a typical Chinese takeout far better than the rest of the garbage around in the neighborhood. They have standard lunch specials which are five or six dollars and get they give you enough food to last three meals. I never understood why Chinese restaurants I love to give enough rice for six people in a meal for one.

Before I just ate this for the umpteenth time, I was sure I was going to give it four stars. However I have realized that there is much inconsistency in their orders every time. And it is not like they have a language barrier when ordering. This is the best part about this place. The guy in the phone speaks perfect English in the back of the house is Asian. I just don&#39;t know why there is inconsistencies in the food. 

Tip. If you want it really spicy, you need to say brown people spicy. Otherwise they&#39;re spicy dishes made extra spicy are still sweet.  If you like your chicken crunchy make sure you say well done.

As I was portioning out food, I heard a strange plunk.  After looking at the scoop of food I just plated, I found a ROCK in the food.  Not a hard seed, an actual rock that I would find in my yard, in my food.  Had I not plated it, I would have ran the risk of breaking a tooth, or worse breaking my family members tooth.

I usually get the special combination platter.  For $8.75, I order the General Tso&#39;s Chicken, fried rice, egg roll, and a can of soda.  For me, the food lasts for about 3 days.  The lunch specials are around $6, with about the same portions as the dinner specials.  Not too shabby.

And the food is delicious!  Of course, it&#39;s not P.F. Chang&#39;s (that may or may not be a bad thing, depending on your preferences), it&#39;s take-out.  The rice is fresh, the meats are juicy, the vegetables are crisp, and the Hot and Sour Soup is hearty and spicy.  Love, love, love it.

The prices are already decent, but know that Fortune House participates with Restaurant.com, and you can purchase discounted vouchers to apply to the cost of your meal.

I stand by my original statements that this is the best Chinese food in Schaumburg. 

I&#39;ve tried tons of dishes on the menu and have never had a bad meal. They have very good eggrolls which are a truly rare find at Chinese places. I suggest getting delivery because going into the actual storefront is sometimes weird dealing with the young college aged guys that man that front area.

Lunch specials went up a quarter so are now $5.75 but the deal still cannot be beat. With lunch specials you get an eggroll, can of pop and huge portion of your desired entree. The portion is really so large, I can only make my way through half of it and then always end up with dinner out of it, too! Score!

You can&#39;t go wrong with their Sesame Chicken, I really think it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had anywhere. General Tso&#39;s Chicken is also a winner with a hint of spice that someone with super low tolerance to fire like myself can handle! Moo Goo Gai Pan is delicious here, as well as the crowd pleaser Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken. ....Can you tell I like chicken dishes? :P

I like basic stuff like chicken fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. It&#39;s hard to screw that up. Their pan fried noodles are a hit or miss but they are still edible regardless.

I have no complaints on their customer service because we live a mile away and pick up our food and since they have never screwed up an order, we are fine with the service.

Certainly not the best Chinese food ever, but well worth the money considering the portions are pretty big. I always have lunch the next day.

I crave the crab rangoon here.  They don&#39;t skimp at all on the cream cheese mix.  Big and plump!   

The pot stickers (oops, they were so good, I ate them before I could take a picture of them, ha ha) are huge too.  And the pot sticker sauce is the BEST I&#39;ve ever had.  I wanted to say it had some orange juice in it, and my husband thought it had little bits of apple in it.  Don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s a mystery, but so delicious I can drink it straight!  ha!   

They have great lunch specials.  

So many Chinese restaurants have a lot of items, heavy in the soy sauce taste.  I&#39;m always happy to find a place that doesn&#39;t cook like that.  

The egg rolls are okay.  Sometimes they have a pasty floury taste to them.  Don&#39;t know if that means they are not cooked all the way, or just use a heavier recipe for the shell.  

Kung Pao beef is so pleasantly tender.  And like other reviewers have already stated, the General Tso&#39;s is very good too.  Not overly sweet like some make it.   House fried rice is done well.  The chicken corn soup always warms up the soul and is nice.   We&#39;ll be back!

I have to say this is some of the worst Chinese food I think I have ever eaten. Okay, so many of you are now trying to label me as a snob or a foodie, neither of which I am. What I am is a person who has lived in Hong Kong for eight years and had the luxury of experiencing quality Chinese cuisine. I can tell you that the fortune house doesn&#39;t come close to this experience. For the first time the other evening, I ordered takeout hoping that the bulk of these reviews reflected the quality of the food. What I did get was large portions of 1). Lo mein which was swimming in a dark brown sauce, 2). if you think the lo mein was swimming, then you should&#39;ve seen the Moo Shoo pork which was taking a bath in its own sauce. Considering that the pancakes were dry and cracked, you can only imagine the unpalatable mess of trying to eat this slop with the juices running everywhere. On top of that, the takeout container was cracked and this ubiquitous dark sauce was everywhere. Lastly, the only dish that held any hope was the curry chicken which pretty much was 80% mushrooms and onions, and the only reason this dish comes to the top is because it was boring and inoffensive as opposed to plain disgusting and unpalatable.

You might think my review harsh but the food reflects the mood. I can also say that I&#39;m honestly not impressed and will never come back to this place for anything. Do the owners really eat here?",28/07/14,164,1,1,1,-8,0.029299999999999937,0.71,0.832,13.456,No,1593

It&#39;s not that their food is bad, but my husband and I will never return due to their customer service.

I placed an order with Fortune House at 7 on a Sunday evening via Grubhub and we paid via credit card.  We were quoted a delivery time of 8:10.

8:15: I called Fortune house to find out where our food was.  The rude guy on the phone said it was on its way and should be there in ten minutes.

8:30: I call back to find out where our food was AGAIN.  He put me on hold.  He comes back a few minutes later and says that they never received the order.  Whaaaaat?  So which is it--it&#39;s on its way or they never received it (furthermore, if you never received my order, how is it that you know EXACTLY what I ordered without me telling you--ESP perhaps??)?!

He said he would get my order right out to me.  I said not to bother and to cancel our order.  He said he wasn&#39;t going to do that.  When pushed further, he blamed grubhub for a glitch and it wasn&#39;t his fault, blah blah blah.

Soooooo, Grubhub made you lie to me when you said my food was on its way.  No, sir.

I asked to talk to a manager.  He said he was a manager.  **insert eye roll**

It&#39;s not like I was asking for free food or compensation or anything.  I wasn&#39;t even asking for ANYthing, I just wanted them to refund my credit card.

All he kept saying was &#34;Sorry, I can&#39;t do that&#34;.  Over...and over....and over....and over...

Yes, sir you CAN.  You are choosing NOT to.

We finally received our food (that we didn&#39;t even WANT at that point) at 9:15.  So well over two hours after we originally placed the order.

I think if I had it delivered, my rating would have been higher, but seeing the slightly dirty interior, wall art with a broken glass frame, and guy with possibly infected facial piercing sort of detracted from my rating. Even though being able to see the kitchen and cooking through the window was a plus.

Having said that - fattest crab rangoons I have ever had! Also, they allow you extra meat for a small upcharge, and my order of Mongolian Beef easily had a pound of tender flank steak in it. I was very impressed with that. But the rest of the meal (an order of Dragon &amp; Phoenix) was just sort of meh. General Tso&#39;s chicken was very bland, as was the shrimp and broccoli.

Ordered: Dragon and Phoenix (general tso chicken and shrimp)- Very good, not to spicy ( I&#39;m a wimp when it comes to spicy foods). I would def get the General tso chicken again. 
Sesame chicken- It tasted good but by the time we ate it, it was a little soggy and had a little to much breading for my liking.  The leftovers I popped in the oven and it was a little better but I don&#39;t think I would get it again. 
Combo fried rice- Very good, it was like the old Yu&#39;s fried rice, not dried out.
and Crab Rangoon- Holy crab rangoon! They give you so much and they are huge! Wish it had a little more crab but still pretty good. Way to much for only 2 people.

 It&#39;s kinda odd that a bunch of high schoolers work there, never saw that before but it seems to work okay! For all the food we got it was about $40.

Fortune House has very good chicken fried rice, crab rangoon, spring rolls, and General Tso&#39;s chicken (all of MY basics). The leftovers were great.

The service is also friendly and fast. Went in, placed our order, ran to Walgreens, came back and the bag was ready to go on the counter waiting for us.

They also deliver to my area even though they are almost in the heart of Schaumburg and I&#39;m on the other end.

Upon walking into this place, I do have to note that the air was pretty thick and smoky. The kitchen is not far from the cashier/desk. If you decided to sit inside and wait for your food, I&#39;m sure you would come out smelling like an eggroll. We ordered way too much food for just 2 people. We got a large cashew chicken, large chicken with garlic sauce, small veggie fried rice, 2 egg rolls and 2 cans of pop. The bag of food had to weigh at least 10 lbs! They also threw in 2 large sized white, steamed rice and sauces/fortune cookies. I am very picky about Chinese take-out, but I really liked the food from here. Everything was super fresh and one of the entrees we got had super huge, full mushrooms (most places just throw in sliced mushrooms). The prices were pretty reasonable too, everything was under $30. If I am craving Chinese takeout, this would be one of my places to go. Since I work nearby, I might try their lunch menu one day.

ETA: Since I enjoyed the food so much on Friday, I decided to stop here for lunch today. I got the sweet and sour chicken lunch special. It came with fried rice, egg roll and can of pop for under $7.00! The portion is HUGE.
