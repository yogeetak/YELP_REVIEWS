I said that I would need a refund as they were way outside the delivery time, I was very hungry and everything had to be microwaved. They offered a credit for the next visit and would not give me a refund. I called grub hub, who was very kind and said that they would give me a refund if the restaurant did not. The restaurant refused and grub hub kindly refunded me and gave me wonderful customer service. On to the food: the taro bubble tea tasted as it should. The chicken lo mein was flavorless. I had never had this low of quality at an Asian buffet. There was no seasoning, it was like eating plain spaghetti noodles with my chicken. The shrimp wonton soup base was in a separate container from the wontons. The base was intolerably salty. The wontons were all mushed together with two random thin noodles that didn&#39;t belong. There was almost no shrimp in them even though they cost more than other varieties of wontons. The cold boring food and customer service from the restaurant was a huge disappointment.

General Taos chicken: also great! The sauce sits at the bottom so make sure to stir well! Had great flavor chicken tasted fresh!

Chicken with black bean sauce: my favorite !!!!!! Such fresh, crunchy vegetables!!!! And the sauce and chicken were amazing!!!

I was in the area &amp; was looking for a good Chinese restaurant that was close so I pulled out my trusted Yelp App &amp; found this place.  This place was definitely a good find.  It is in a little strip mall next to a Subway.  The parking lot is a decent size but the parking right of front next to the door can be full at times.  

I was surprised when I walked inside at how big it was &amp; how many tables they had.  It was very spacious &amp; the tables were spaced about with lots of room.  I came around lunch time.  I ordered a Mongolian beef &amp; it came with fried rice &amp; a soup.  For my soup I had the choice of egg drop or hot &amp; sour.  I went with the hot &amp; sour &amp; it was very good.  Some places taste a little bit too sour but this place was more on the hot side which I liked a lot.  

After about ten minutes the Mongolian beef came out.  It was piping hot which was a big plus &amp; you could tell it was brought to the table promptly after it was finished cooking.  The portion was a good size &amp; the food was delicious.  The fried rice that came with the food was also very good.  

The service here was very good &amp; the people who were running the place were also very nice.  I decided to come here again &amp; the second experience was just as good.

I was watching a show that had Chinese food on it and then had a craving for it. Looked on yelp what was around, and this was the best rated one. Never heard of it and realized that it was very new, just about a week open when I went there on a Sunday afternoon. I&#39;d give this play 4 stars for the food which I&#39;ll explain later, but bumped it up to 5 because of our waitress.

Doesn&#39;t look like a traditional Chinese restaurant, but it&#39;s such a big open room, not sure what else they could do with it. For the food, we got dumplings, egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, and shrimp fried rice. Dumplings were alright, different style than other traditional places. The small egg drop soup is a great deal for the price. A small was big enough for 2 people. The Mongolian beef was pretty good and same with the shrimp friend rice. Made for a good leftover meal later on that day too.

Our waitress was really nice, and tea is free too. She even wondered if we didn&#39;t like the food since we had so much left over but really, we just don&#39;t eat a lot.

We typically order from Lom Lings in Lombard or Jins and China Ho in Winfield, but China Chef is geographically closer so we figured let&#39;s give it a shot. We were very glad we did. From time of order to food bagged and ready to go was 11 minutes.  We ordered 3 basic, chinese restaurant staples: Mongolian Beef, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce and General Tso&#39;s Chicken.

Mongolian Beef: Flavorful with a bit of heat, nice sized portion and not drowning in gravy like other places treat this dish.

Shrimp in Lobster Sauce: First, I give them props for not skimping on the Shrimp and unlike the Mongolian Beef, they went heavy with this awesome egg, lobster and bean sauce which was very tasty. 

General Tso&#39;s Chicken: Where&#39;s the breading? A lot of places put a heavy batter on their chicken so the ratio of bread to chicken is 2:1.. NOT here.. They again served a good sized portion of lightly battered chicken and veggies for flavor. They didn&#39;t  over douse the chicken in sauce either. It was just the right amount.

My opinion, so far much better than all the surrounding Chinese take-out. This is a place you should try. Next time we&#39;ll try delivery and 4 new dishes...",29/05/15,150,5,2,4,13,3.2966999999999995,1.2990000000000002,0.0,12.701,No,1253

At least I have 1 reliable place that seems to have pretty decent staples...more importantly, for smoothies that they will DELIVER to you. If you&#39;re curious, the cup of smoothie is delivered in a small brown paper bag. Dunno what they do if you order more than one. If you do pick-up order, they&#39;ll make it when you arrive (unless you request otherwise, I assume). As you watch them make it, you can also be really confused &amp; surprised that the interior is actually really nice.

Food I&#39;ve tried so far:
One of their egg foo youngs: It&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s ordered for family members, so...yeah. It&#39;s not any different from any other places, really.
Orange chicken: It&#39;s actually slight hot/has &#34;heat&#34;, opposed to straight up sweetness. It&#39;s still too sweet for my tastes, though.
Sesame chicken: Would 100% order again always. The sauce stays on the bottom of the container, so definitely spoon some on top when getting your food.
Chicken &amp; Mango Fried Rice: Thumbs down. :( I was thinking it&#39;d be a typical brown soy-saucey fried rice with chicken &amp; mango. Nope. It&#39;s some sort of seasoned fried rice with chicken &amp; mango. The rice &amp; chicken are great, but the fresh ripe mango they use in it really has no place.
Veggie Lo Mein: Your standard lo mein. Their veggie lo mein has a LOT of mushrooms in it, not too much onions.
Crab rangoon: Wonderfully stuffed with the cream mixture and are delicious.

Delivery is also pretty quick. I order via Grubhub usually - always gets here in 20 mins flat. Maybe a full 30 minutes if I ordered during a peak time, like dinner or something.",25/06/16,223,4,2,5,27,5.593999999999999,3.1050000000000004,0.435,21.460000000000004,No,1808

the reason for not giving them five stars is because of their prices. when compared to other chinese restaurants, the amount of the serving you get from here vs other places is typically the same, but china chefs prices are quite higher.",28/07/15,126,4,2,3,17,2.6526,1.105,0.501,9.394,No,1123

Boy, were we disappointed.

We did a carry-out dinner order. 

Pretty standard order of egg rolls...lemon chicken and sweet and sour shrimp.

All of it was really bad.

I&#39;ll start with the egg rolls. The strangest egg rolls I&#39;ve ever had from a Chinese restaurant. They were filled with ingredients not normally found in your standard egg rolls. Long, thin, greasy and they just didn&#39;t taste quite right.

On to the lemon chicken....

The chicken inside the fried outer shell tasted like it had been left over from lunch...from the day before. It was really unappealing.

Speaking of unappealing. How &#39;bout that sweet and sour shrimp?

Unpleasant to look at and eat. Who leaves the tails on in sweet and sour shrimp? Chef Ping, that&#39;s who! Awful all around.

The rice wasn&#39;t good either (and yes, the rice carton has that &#34;bad breath&#34; smell...you know what I&#39;m talking about).

It was our first and last time with food from Chef Ping.

In a word, &#34;yuck&#34;!",16/09/16,145,1,1,1,-2,0.24029999999999996,1.376,2.153,16.471,No,1151
chef-ping-rolling-meadows,Lily F.,Oavbr8dUe96Ap75kSwHhww,#NAME?,"First thing I noticed was that placing an order on the phone was seamless.  A lot of really authentic Chinese places tend to either have terrible customer service or somewhat decent customer service but a language barrier for some.  When I called here, you could hear all of the commotion in the background but the woman speaking to me was courteous and professional. She even repeated my order a couple of times back to me because it was a bit hard to hear with all of the noise.

I ordered my favorite dish: pork belly with preserved vegetables (comes with pancakes), ping&#39;s noodle platter, egg rolls, and the Fuchi faepian- a cold Sichuan dish that has marinated beef and tripe.  The cold dish was delicious and the flavor and spice was spot on!    The noodles had shrimp, scallop, pieces of squid and the container hardly closed.  Hell, even the egg rolls were perfectly fried.  Their egg rolls are what I would consider the smaller (smooth) egg rolls and not the fat ones that are dipped in egg yolk first.  I only mention this because I&#39;m a huge fan of the small ones and not so much of the large ones.  What was even more impressive was the portion and pricing for everything.  I feel like I&#39;ve been eating on the pork belly and the noodles for a week now and still have some leftover.

The only reason why this gets a four star besides a 5 is because the preserved vegetables (supposed to be like sour and salty) was really sugary.  I&#39;m thinking that whoever cooked it made the classic error of mixing up the salt and the sugar.  I didn&#39;t find out until I got home but it was obviously too sweet, which was a huge disappointment because I ended up throwing away everything in the dish other than the pork because it was SO sweet!  Such a shame!  With that being said, the pork was very tender and tasted wonderful on it&#39;s own or with the pancake.  Also, the rice also was mushy like someone added way too much water cooking it.  However, I didn&#39;t really care about the rice because I already had my noodle dish waiting for me.  

Takeaway: If you&#39;re a fan of cold Chinese apps, try the fu chi fae pian.  I know I will definitely be coming back to try more of their menu!",07/09/16,240,4,2,4,32,3.2287,2.373,1.936,16.691,No,2210

The only bad part is that there is usually a wait (30 mins to an hr?)  if you go without making a reservation.

Food
Noodles in Black Bean Sauce [in Korean it is called &#34;Jjajangmyun&#34;] - the portion is big and can be shared between 2 people or if you&#39;re extremely hungry, one person can finish the bowl and be full (to the point that you feel like you cannot breathe anymore.. sort of.. )

Sweet &amp; Sour Beef [in Korean it is called &#34;ttangsooyuk&#34;] - the option might not be in the menu because usually it is pork, but I prefer beef rather than pork.  The beef is battered &amp; fried perfectly then the sauce is poured over it.  Delicious and definitely a must try for all!! 

Atmosphere - great for groups/families, but expect to wait longer if you are in a group. [If you plan on going with a group of people, reservations are recommended]

pretty good and the service is great. You can request to modify dishes like take out ham, or chicken, if you only want the fried rice to have shrimp. You can also request for Sriracha sauce. You&#39;ll need it if you like spicy because we requested everything spicy and it was not spicy at all. The Crab Rangoon is delicious!! 

I would suggest you buy dishes and share them because they are huge servings and can feed two people at least. For example, if you have three people, order two dishes and rice separately. Why separately? Because the rice that comes with your dish is a very small portion.

My family ordered the ping&#39;s chicken wing, pork shu mai, shrimp dumpling, and combination chow mein. The food was cooked perfectly and the waiter did inform us that the pork shu mai would take around 25 minutes to be ready. Ping&#39;s chicken wings is one of their specialty dishes that almost everyone gets. I totally agree with them as well.  

The service was very good and our waiter was very attentive if we needed any refills or additional items. The pricing is very reasonable as well with the quality and serving of food you get.

Here&#39;s some comments...

I love chicken wings. While some say the PongPong have no meat and are just fried bones these are my go to asian flavor wings. Sweet with some spice and nice crispy bits. I don&#39;t get tired of eating these!!

Shrimp dumplings, another Chef Ping staple for me. Pieces of shrimp in a nicely steamed wrapper. 

Hunan beef &amp; chicken. I always order this, why, I don&#39;t know, the flavor is so good to me...

Pad Thai. This is one that went downhill. I love the noodle (Wide) which you don&#39;t see as much anymore, but the sauce on this dish is flavorless. Just look at the photos people post here. Barely any color and it tastes like it. To bad as I love Pad Thai.",05/09/15,102,4,1,4,8,3.486500000000001,2.744,0.6679999999999999,11.588000000000003,No,826

Also, I was impressed by the amount of customers they had on a weekday.

We ordered sesame chicken, garlic chicken, pong pong chicken?, jampong and jajang. 

The sesame and garlic chicken came with rice an egg roll and a wonton crisp. They were perfectly prepared and not soggy at all!! I just didn&#39;t really like the garlic chicken - too strong, there&#39;s a weird after taste.. But that&#39;s my fault I guess. The sesame was amazing!

The pong pong chicken was supposed to be spicier than kanppungi which is the Korean spicy chicken wings.. But it was very mild. Haha maybe it&#39;s cause we&#39;re so used to Great Sea&#39;s spicy, sweet, big kanppungi that the pong pong was a little underwhelming. But by no means was it not enjoyable!

The jjajangmyun was thick and big portioned which is always good. You should ask for an extra bowl of sauce cause for the amount of noodles Chef Ping holds back that delicious black bean sauce.. it&#39;s so good why not have more to smother all over your face - I mean the noodles.. :)

Now the only let down today was the jampong. The broth was not spicy and refreshing like it should be, but more milky and mild? I think Chef Ping doesn&#39;t like to make things too spicy in order to cater to the non-Asian customers, which they have many! But again, great big portion :)

PROS:
-Restaurant is decently clean.
-Food tastes Ok.

CONS:
-Service is terrible! And when I say terrible, I mean it. The Chinese lady who slightly served our table (Her name is Hong) demanded a higher tip on my $75 bill. Stating that 3 dollars wasn&#39;t enough. However a tip is given for a job well done. She did nothing of the sort. She ignored us, food was served by a 6 different staff. She gave awesome service to the american families around us, but completely treated us like garbage. As we were walking out of the restaurant, she hails us down, demanding we give her more. My father-in-law doesn&#39;t speak much english, so she hounded him for more money.
-Earlier I said restaurant is clean, and it is for the most part. Seats are well taken care of, and most of the restaurant from what I can see. However, I had to fight my food with at least 5 Flies. Talk about gross.

My favorite dishes are their mu shu pork and kung pao chicken. The mu shu pork is served in one container, with plum sauce and pancakes on the side so nothing gets messy when you do take out.

Their walnut shrimp, szechuan shrimp, 12 ingredient tofu in a pot, hot pepper beef, and summer salad are also great too.

Hope this sends a notice to ownership of  Chef Ping.   Based on my 9/4 &amp;  9/24/2016 visits,  owner must drastically improve the time the food is ordered and delivered to the customer&#39;s table. 

9/4 visit,  one of the simple dishes we ordered (Orange Beef) never arrived after 
ONE HOUR from order.  After 30 min, our waitress kept telling us she was checking, but there&#39;s was a wait.  After ONE HOUR when our other food was eaten, but cancelled the order.

9/25 visit,    we ordered a vegetable dish,  orange beef (again),  sizzling beef dish, and fried fish.  From the time we ordered,  It took about 20 minutes for our vegetable dish to arrive.   After that,  it took another 30 minutes for our orange beef &amp; fish dishes to arrive.    Then,  another 15 minute for our final dish the Sizzling Beef platter to arrive.  Unfortunately,  the sizzling beef, NEVER came out on a sizzling platter.

When I complained to our waitress on 9/25 she was very apologetic,  and did acknowledge the kitchen was busy/backed up.  While I was doing this, the family next to us had the same issue.

Hands down, in the general Chicago area, this is the best place to stop by for these two items. The noodles aren&#39;t too chewy, the black bean sauce isn&#39;t too salty and has a nice balance of sweetness, and the meat is crispy even after sitting in the sauce for a little bit.

Utter &#34;Chef Ping&#34; amongst the Chinese or Korean that live in the burbs and chances are that they go here for their family style Chinese/Korean meals.  

They do try to stress the quality of service here especially for the larger tables in the back with plate swapping near the middle of your menu. 

Some items that we usually have for family meals included the honey walnut shrimp.  JaJa mein (though its never a favorite of mine).  Salt and Pepper tofu (must get), The pong pong chicken (make sure to get extra rice for all the sauce haha!). Schezwan green beans are delicious.  But garlic stir fried pea shoots for $16?!   come on now...8 treasure rice for dessert is a different kind of dessert (not overly sweet)  which Ping does fairly well.  

Chef Ping is a bit pricier and portions a bit smaller than the restaurants in Chinatown for family style meals, but still better than the alternative of driving from the burbs thru the traffic nightmare of the loop.

chef-ping-rolling-meadows,Paul T.,CryTytqLBWKjoC12OTe0kA,YaqHuZEWKmTyNwwUFM1G2g,"This place reportedly is under new ownership and as a result the quality of food has gone way way down. 

In fact, the food is among the worst I have had in the greater Chicago area. The Sesame Chicken was so over-cooked it was powder dry in the middle - it also had way too much batter and way too little sauce. How can they blow a basic dish like Sesame Chicken? We had the Sweet Sour Fish and the fish was tasteless and the sauce was just plain weird.  The portions in general are quite small also, and all the dishes were quite greasy (too much oil). We also had the signature crab dish with salted egg (&#34;Gold Dust&#34;) coating. Wow, the crab was over-cooked and the meat was completed dry inside the shells. To add insult to injury, the crab shells were not pre-cracked and they did not provide any cracker tool or special fork. We asked several times for a crab cracker tool and waited 10 minutes before one arrived. The crab was all cold by then. POOR SERVICE.

Talking about poor service... we ordered 8 dishes. The last two dishes were still 80% full and they came and gave us the check and asked us if we needed anything else. I was literally still picking food from the dish when the waiter came and took them away for boxing. Given someone at our table give the waiter permission to do so, but he only did it because he felt pressured. It was 6:30 and they were people waiting for tables. So, I understand they want to turn over the tables quickly. But come on, at least let people finish their food in peace. BAD FOOD &amp; BAD SERVICE. I don&#39;t know how this place got a 4 star rating. 

Also, in terms of dining ambience, because the place is so crowded, they pack the tables close together. So the place feel very stuffy, you feel cramped and it so noisy it&#39;s hard to hear your dinning companions.

The menu is pretty extensive, offering soups, appetizers (such as pot stickers, shrimp dumplings, Chinese Buns, shrimp toast, etc.), curry, Kung-Pao specialties, Sweet-Sour dishes, Salt-Pepper entrees, seafood/beef/chicken/pork dishes, and vegetarian options. The owner is Chinese who grew up in Korea, and has adopted all these various Korean-Chinese recipes to offer his diners. My family and I are huge fans of their Ping&#39;s Chicken Wings, which are small chicken lollipops with this great thick savory sauce on it - fried to perfection, they have a great crispy exterior and a great ggangpoongi taste!  I love how these chicken lollipops are smaller with more skin and small amount of meat - great to share as an appetizer or just eat it with rice!  Yum!

Service thou,sometimes not the greatest.
When I go out I do it for he whole experience. Service and food.otherwise I can stay home and cook as good as any!
I agree that is very busy at times,however when you wait 45 minutes or so to be seated,than another 5-10 to even be aknolaged,it&#39;s bad.(you can&#39;t make reservations unless are 6 or more people)
Here you are, very hungry and frustrated. and you don&#39;t want to order the same Mongolian beef,you ask the server to help you figure out what&#39;s what. you stare at the menu than at the server and again at menu. You have to decide alone !!!!! No help!
I have a suggestion: pictures accompanied by short list of ingredients.
One time, me and my husband ordered appetizers, soup and a main dish.
We got all the food at once but the soup was forgotten. When half an hour into our dinner I asked about the soup,the server mumbled something and ran into the kitchen. He came back telling us &#34;coming,coming now. We canceled the order,it was to late.I expected an apologie but I got a pair of eyes pinning me in my chair.
Again, the food is fresh, well cooked and elevated as far as Chinese food goes. 
Maybe the owners should invest equal effort in finding servers that play the part of a Chinese restaurant in America .
Language and understanding it is important, specially if you live and work here.
Lack of intelligent communication,even if is only for  food and entertainment, can tarnish any potentially great experience.
It&#39;s good to go dinning here when is less busy so you feel like a patron of the restaurant and not next in line at any fast food store.
Even Wendy&#39;s gives you more respect!

chef-ping-rolling-meadows,Sarah N.,QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,5e_TTZbX5NOAN4X55uJ1yg,"My family and I came here with some friends who recommended this place.  Typically, they go to China Town for good Chinese food.  They said that this was the best place close by that was almost equivalent to China Town status Chinese food.  But, at least it is closer than going to China Town, so I will be coming here more often now that I have been introduced to Chef Ping.

Unfortunately, I cannot recall all the food we ordered as they were the ones who ordered for us, in Chinese.  I will do my utmost best to recall what it was we ordered.  I remember eating Salt and Pepper Squid, Walnut Shrimp, Szechwan Fish Fillet, Mongolian Beef, Sauteed Peapod Tips, Mandarin Bean Curd, and I&#39;m sure there are others we ordered but can&#39;t remember.  

Salt and Pepper Squid was just to die for.  If this is all we ate, I could eat this with rice and be happy.  As for the Walnut Shrimp, this was also very addicting.  The combination of the sweet sauce with the honey walnut and saltiness of the shrimp was perfect.  Szechwan Fish Fillet was was another unforgettable dish we had.  This is great by itself or even with rice.  Just keep guzzling the green tea after each dish and your taste buds resets so that you can get the real flavor of the other dish you eat.  The Mongolian Beef was also perfect with the rich flavors combined with the vegetables and beef.  The beef was moist and not tough, just how we like it.  Second to last is the Peapod Tips, this is a great dish to have for a vegetable dish.  I believe hardly any Chinse restaurants serve this unless you&#39;re in China Town.  I am in love with this dish.  Lastly, the Mandarin Bean Curd is something everyone should order as an appetizer.  It&#39;s a great dish to start the entire meal.

chef-ping-rolling-meadows,Megan Z.,f_CZxgLT_noyVDbc2Qh7BA,sOrA1VagFBtcHY0cgFfJlw,"My father and I live about a mile away from Chef Ping and always enjoy an excellent meal here! 

The other reviews are right, wait times can be excessive. However, you will understand why once you enjoy the food! 

We came in on a busy Tuesday night. It was a ten-minute wait for a table, so we decided to eat at the bar area. No regrets, we actually found it quieter and easier to have a conversation. 
Service here is always top-notch. Regardless of the crowds. 

We always start our meal here with a fresh bowl of soup. 
The wonton soup is excellent and is served piping hot! 
My father usually orders the Hot n&#39; Sour Soup and raves about it. 

The menu here has some &#34;americanized&#34; selections, however they do offer favorites for those craving a taste from back home. You know it is good when you see a ton of oriental people packing the restaurant! (I say this with the utmost respect!) 

Next, we ordered the Mandarin Soy Duck! It was hands-down the best duck we&#39;ve ever had. It is served at room-temp and is utterly amazing. The duck is so tender and the mandarin soy marinade just made it melt in your mouth! If you are a duck person, you must give it a try. 

The hot dishes as I mentioned before, are mostly americanized. However, do not let this shy you away. Chef Ping is NOT your typical &#34;americanized&#34; chinese joint. 

My favorite dish here is the Kung Pao Beef, when it comes to &#34;americanized&#34; dishes. 
The beef is so tender you barely have to chew. It is incredible. 
Plus, if you love it spicy like I do, just ask them to make it extra spicy. 
Chef Ping uses incredible seasonings and technique to raise the bar on Chinese Cuisine. 

Another favorite is the Salt n Pepper Smelt or Ping&#39;s Noodle Soup. 
The noodles are homemade and served in an amazing (spicy) broth abundant with veggies, squid, and shrimp! The Noodle soup is enough for 2 (maybe 3) people! 

As with all portions at Chef Ping, you can feed 2-3 people from any entree. 

Simply put, Chef Ping is the undisputed best in Chicago and in my opinion, the whole state!

We showed up at 6:30pm on a Friday and were told it was a 45 minute wait for us 4. It ended up being about 25-30 minutes, which was a nice surprise.

The service is really friendly, prompt, and the food comes out quickly. Our server made good recommendations when we were trying to figure out what to get from one part of the menu, say, the beef section. When we got all our dishes, we realized that three of them are kind of large combo platters (the Summer Salad, Noodle Platter, &amp; Seafood Combo) and fairly similar. I wish our server could&#39;ve noticed this and mentioned something about it.

Smaller than I&#39;d expected; the tofu had a nice &amp; thin breading to it, but with such thick pieces, even though they&#39;re flavored on the outside, most of each piece doesn&#39;t have much flavor on the inside. 

BEEF: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chef-ping-rolling-meadows?select=ULSFZadx5zo3yKfUuwj4Mw#mk328sO7r4tZF_cIGdAX0g

The beef comes in huge slices and is incredibly satisfying to chew through, the meat is so good! The large mushroom slices are great too; they&#39;re not too overpowering as I often find with everyday Chinese dishes with mushroom.

I didn&#39;t love the flavors in this - I could definitely taste the mustard/horseradish throughout, which was an odd pairing for me, and having a cold dish in November in the Midwest just isn&#39;t as comforting as the hot dishes.

Food quality is consistently good. They do tend to get busy, but that&#39;s because of how good it is.  They do a robust to-go business as well, mainly for that reason. 

On weekends, prepare for a wait, but during the week you shouldn&#39;t have any trouble. 

My favorites include Mongolian Beef, General Tso&#39;s Chicken, and Peking Duck - all are prepared in a way that&#39;s consistent with the superior options in Chinatown, or on the West coast.  When you see significant numbers of Chinese people eating at a Chinese restaurant, it says something.

Been coming here for years. The food and service have always been good. Recently I came and ordered the same thing I always get. What the server brought was not at all what I was expecting. The dish was different, in both taste and form. When I called the server over to ask if they had switched recipes she insisted that what she brought was indeed correct. She insisted I asked for the wrong thing. Instead of trying to make things right she just took the dish away and didn&#39;t offer an alternative. So while the rest of my party ate their dishes I got to sit and watch them. It wasn&#39;t until later that the server got the idea to see if I&#39;d like something else. Sorry, but too late, the damage had been done.

It&#39;s unfortunate that this happened because I&#39;ve been coming here for a number of years. I think this place has become too popular for its own good. I feel that they no longer care about it&#39;s customers which is why I no longer care to spend my money here.

Summer salad: Cold, hot and mustard salad on bean noodle, big serving. I&#39;d never had this dish before. It was cold and refreshing, but had a really nice kick from the hot mustard.

Pong pong chicken: Hot &amp; tangy sauce on a chicken lollipop. Yum! Sticky, garlicky, sweet, savory. Rivals my favorite wings in SF.

Lady mao&#39;s bean curd: Well known folk dish, tofu with minced pork. Great with some rice!

Gan pong shrimp: Original recipe dated back to the old san tung province, burned hot pepper with chopped garlic glaze. A shrimp version of the chicken wings I love?! Yes please! First time having this dish and I loved it!

Combination fried rice: Shrimp, chicken, ham with a touch of soy sauce. Nicely fried and full of flavor! The kids loved this!

Beef with peppers, onions and carrots: I don&#39;t remember this dish too well, but I do remember the beef and veggies were stir fried well.

Asian style sweet and sour beef: I don&#39;t really like sweet and sour dishes but the roommate&#39;s brother loves it!

Walnut shrimp: Jumbo shrimp in rich creamy sauce with honey coated walnuts and steamed broccoli. Yum! The shrimp were big and juicy!

Sea cucumber and scallops with mushrooms, cauliflower and peas: I loved the scallops and veggies in this dish!

Sauteed baby bok choy: Bok choy was cooked well and flavor was nice and garlicky.

Noodles in black bean sauce: Pork, baby shrimp, onion &amp; zucchini slow cooked in black bean sauce served over homemade noodles. The roommate loves this dish. And the kids were enjoying it as well.

Ping&#39;s noodle soup: Noodle in spicy broth cooked with fine shredded pork, seafood and vegetables. One of my favorite dishes! The soup was spicy and savory and dish was full of seafood and veggies!

Service was good, but it took some time for the last two dishes to come out. I understood since everything was pre ordered except those two. And every table was adding several orders of the last two dishes.

I used to work near this location and can&#39;t recall having very many issues at all, but today was very disappointing for me. 
Firstly, I hardly consider 230pm on a Weekday much of a prime rush time. I was one of two customers ordering and there were only one or two other people in the restaurant who weren&#39;t even necessarily eating but conducting business. 
The young man behind the register was very short with me as though he had better things to do with his time. Being a healthy water as well as gluten sensitive, I ordered my usual with the gluten free pasta alternative. Now I don&#39;t know if it varies from store to store on protocol, but I was charged $2 extra for gluten free. The past 2 times id ordered tubs from other locations, zero upcharge. And if a thing, I&#39;d read online from another reviewer that it was $1 upcharge. Not to nickle and dime, but at least a little consistency would be nice. On top of that, when I got home, my med salad was missing feta, thus simply becoming.. Some lettuce, very little cucumber - onion - and tomato, and less olives than I have fingers on one hand. 
Needless to say, disappointing. For something I had been feeling like having if for awhile not having it meet previously set standards. I write this review because I sincerely hope service here improves. I didn&#39;t call the store or rush back because I&#39;m already exhausted from my day and frankly do not care to come across as one of those individuals who are ultimately seeking free crap, I just want what I paid for the way it&#39;s always been served up. Besides, they can handle a direct complaint by throwing free crap at you, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily solve the service issue that might be more noticed based on noticeable free speech such as this.  Better luck to me next time, or at a different location I suppose?",30/09/13,219,2,2,4,18,3.4627,2.576,1.2469999999999999,13.174999999999997,No,2048

I like how all the ingredients are listed under each item.  They have good variety with sizes and combinations so you can get a small bowl with a protein plus a soup or a salad.

The sauce tasted homemade and they gave you a lot on the noodles(which i like so the noodles dont all stick together) They also put 5 meatballs on the speghetti that are pretty good in size(about golf ball size) the meat had a good seasoned tasted, which is always nice to get a flavor and not just meat!!!

That&#39;s what I used to think before I picked up a certificate for a &#34;tasting tour&#34; that was bundled with passes to the Illinois Railway Museum at a silent auction this past spring. Well, the IRM was a bust, but at least dinner was great.

We did not have the typical experience here, as instead of ordering at the counter, we had an employee bring us out a variety of dishes, two at a time, for us to sample. Over the course of an hour or so we had probably 5 or 6 different dishes, all of which were amazing (even our daughter&#39;s buttered noodles were amazing). Our server was great too. Even though there was a mix up in the communication and he wasn&#39;t expecting us, he didn&#39;t miss a beat and made sure we were well taken care of, even throughout the 3 or 4 rushes they had while we were there.

Unfortunately, the establishment immediately started letting me down. There was no hostess to seat me, so I took a seat in the bar area where I was totally ignored for about 10 minutes. The restaurant was busy and there was a Hawks game on so there was a lot of drinking going on, but it was also during a snowstorm so only about half the place was full. 

Finally, the frat boy bartender (Dude! Man! Bro!) came over to me and told me he&#39;d be taking care of me. 

I ordered an iced tea and asked about the specials. He rattled off something about $1 burgers and went to get my drink. Now according to both the website and sign outside, the fried pickles are supposed to be free on Mondays. He didn&#39;t mention that, but I ordered them anyway, along with the Pork &amp; Cheese burger, which was supposed to be crispy pork belly and fried provolone atop a burger.  It sounded good. 

Much too much time passed until Dude returned and told me my food would be up soon. I think the problem was he was trying to make all the drinks for the whole place and didn&#39;t have time to sling my food. Whatevs. He should have asked one of the myriad lingering waiters who we&#39;re hovering around the bar (and even laying on it at one point) to cover his table. 

That was the last I saw of Bro until the end of my meal. My burger was brought out by a manager looking fellow in a sports jacket. He had no knowledge of the pickles but said he&#39;d bring them out. That turned into him placing a quickie order for them since DudeManBro totally forgot. 

He also forgot to check on me and ask how everything was, and also refill my drink til I was almost ready to leave. 

The food was pretty nasty. The pretzel bun was refrigerator cold. The burger, a premade patty thing was cooked rare, which is how I like it, but I was never asked how well done I wanted it and I know most places are required to do medium unless specially ordered. The bun was sitting in a pool of juice and grease. I was pretty grossed out. The crispy pork belly was more like over cooked pulled pork and the cheese was totally flavorless. I couldn&#39;t finish it. 

The pickles finally came out, also delivered by manager guy, and they were tough and bitter. I think the coating was burnt, but I couldn&#39;t tell. The Bloody Mary ketchup did nothing to enhance them. 

Overall, the menu is very interesting but the execution is just bad. And the service is beyond bad. I would never come back here and encourage you to do the same.",02/01/14,292,1,1,0,-61,-0.6671999999999999,2.4529999999999994,2.509,31.039,No,2649

First warning, 6pm, Sunday, and there are 5 cars in the lot.  6 with ours.  I even mentioned this to the Wife.  It did fill up with a few more people after we came, but...

Second warning, this used to be an old Bennigans a few years back.  The inside looks like they hadn&#39;t updated it since Bennigan&#39;s moved out, other than the bar area.  This isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, but Bennigan&#39;s was a volume place, and a lot of people coming/going wears seats, tables, floors, etc down.  It showed.

Food was ok.  I&#39;m a simple person, and like simple food.  Just a burger please.  No crap or contamination (I.E. veggies), on top of it.  Burger came out on a smaller pretzel bun, and the patty looked like a McD&#39;s 1/4 patty that they just took out of the box in the freezer and threw on the grille.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but nothing I&#39;d rave abour either.  Got the waffle fries, which were good.  I used the leftover cheese from our Pretzel appetizer (which was good), with the fries.  I LOVE cheese fries...  My Wife had some tacos, about the only thing she said was that 2 of the 3 filled her up.  So nothing special here.

Our server Barb was really nice, but she did take some time getting us our check.  She did say that part of the order for the people that came in and were seated next to us, was wrong, so she was back handling that for awhile.  No biggie.  But it&#39;s no after 7, and we have two children  who have the patience of a gnat.  So meltdown time was quickly coming.

I visited again this past weekend and I&#39;m happy to report changes in the quality of the food seem to have taken place. 

We started with a couple of Bloody Mary&#39;s. They were $4 and the first one was served with a couple green olives, carrot stick, pickle slice, celery stick and cube of cheese. The drinks were zesty and flavorful.

Also to start, we ordered the homemade potato chips with white truffle oil and french onion dip. The french onion dip was the best I ever had. We asked the waiter, who was quite knowledgeable and friendly, what was in it. He told us it was homemade mixture of sour cream and cream cheese peppered with sauteed onions. As delicious as it sounds. 

We ordered the Kentucky Ale Beer Bourbon Ale, which is on tap. Each time my beer came to me in a snifter with a beautiful head. I could tell the glasses were clean because a foamy trail was left behind on the inside of my glass. If you like bourbon and you enjoy beer, then this is the beer for you. Seriously, the best beer I ever had. Careful though, it has a high alcohol content! 

For my entree, I ordered the Mac &amp; Cheese with pork belly and the cheese sauce in the Mac &amp; Cheese was definitely homemade and tasty. It was served with a belt of well-seasoned pork belly. I ate the whole thing!

One of my dinner companions just ordered Teriyaki chicken wings and he said that they were tasty and meaty, while other dinner mate consumed with gusto a hamburger with a fried egg, bacon and cheese. 

We even ordered dessert: New York cheese cake and creme brulee. Both decent enough.

This restaurant seems like one that would be seen on Gordon Ramsey&#39;s Kitchen Nightmares. The food is not interesting and carelessly prepared. During our time there I got the sense that the owner was skimping on quality in order to save money. 

I ordered sliders for my 1 &amp; 3 year old boys to share and was very disappointed--they got 3 small pretzel buns, each with 1/4 of a hamburger patty on them.

I&#39;m sorry, but it was a cheap and tacky excuse for sliders. It cost $10 and I feel like I could have prepared the same quality dish at home for far less. I&#39;d ordered the appetizer for my boys to share, expecting 3 small but meaty burgers. I was very annoyed.

I ordered myself the southwest salad which came in a fried tortilla bowl. The tortilla bowl was very greasy so I didn&#39;t eat much of it.

The bottled selection is average with some highlights, the draft selection has some rarer choices and a decent range.  I tried the Vander Mill Totally Roasted Cider.  Goes down like an odd concoction of cider beer and wine, but has a nice finish.

Food - Had the Cali Panini which was tasty.  They offer sweet potato fries which always makes me happy, and theirs are delicious.  

Service - Quick and friendly.  Our waiter was well versed with both menu&#39;s and carried a good conversation about beer choices in-house and around town.  He also gave us the lowdown on their daily specials, which includes some bargain buys every night of the week.   

Ambiance - I liked their setup.  They have a full bar with an extension area of generous seating and a separate dining section, which is only separated by a half wall.  This makes the whole restaurant visible no matter where you sit.  I like the open air feeling. They have a multitude of tv&#39;s with sports if you&#39;re looking to catch a game.  

The only downsides: food prices are a tad high in my opp, and the craft beer menu could be more diverse &amp; larger.  Fix those things and I think you create more repeat customers.",23/03/14,167,3,2,5,36,4.1832,3.657,0.449,14.892000000000001,No,1460

We didn&#39;t have much faith that it would last and never went back. We went back last week because we had a coupon and thought maybe the first time was just first week jitters and it had improved but not so much. The server seemed inexperienced at best. My son wanted the pretzel appetizer which was basically a pretzel hot dog bun unsliced. For her dinner my daughter ordered the mac and cheese. The description sounded very well put together but the cheese in the adult pork belly mac and cheese was the same neon orange sauce they give you with the pretzel appetizer as dip. All of our food was equally as underwhelming as was the service. We won&#39;t be giving it a third time. The only reason it got 2 stars was the treatment from the hostess stand in seating and the staff who was in charge of walking around keeping the table clear of finished dishes and such. It had potential. Adequate number of tvs for great sports watching and environment but the food is terrible.,16/05/16,114,2,1,1,0,0.28259999999999996,0.905,0.876,11.219,No,1076

I imagine it would work for people staying in hotels or at Pheasant Run. But honestly, there&#39;s not much here to recommend to locals. The burger is just okay, served on a pretzel roll, accompanied by plain fries and a rationed portion of ketchup in a plastic cup.

The chicken limone was pounded flat, cooked dry, with a splash of some kind of sauce that I suppose was lemony at one point in its long life. The baked potato that accompanied it was over-cooked to the point of &#34;are you kidding me?!?&#34; and so was the replacement spud they brought out.

Beer is very cold, taps appear clean, but they are obviously not washing their beer glasses right since there&#39;s no sign of head on any beer delivered.

The place is almost starkly industrial, with TVs as the only wall decoration and the floor done in painted concrete. Metalwork dominates elsewhere.

The beer selection was very good. The list showing the different types available along with a description of the beer was very helpful to find what I liked. I went with the O&#39;Fallon Wheach and the Local Option Blood ov the Kings. Both good choices.

The food was hit and miss though. The Sunday special is $0.50 wings and $5 draft beers so I went with 6 wings to start. I got the &#34;Down and South&#34; wings which are buffalo sauce and a southwest bbq dry rub mixture. The wings were actually very good. They were only the drumettes and no flats. I probably prefer the flats because you can usually get more meat off than you can from the drumettes. The drumettes were very big though, which was a definite plus for the wings.

For an entree, I went with The Frites burger, a cheeseburger with waffle fries and ale-braised onions. I really didn&#39;t get much flavor from the burger. I ordered medium and got more of a medium-well. The lettuce on the side was pretty much wilted by the time it got to me so it didn&#39;t add any crispness that I was looking for.

My gift certificate from Restaurant.com was worth $15, but we were only given $14.50. I thought that was odd, and then I added the bill up and it was off too, by a couple of bucks.

Not that vanilla is bad, but when something is trying to be an &#34;ale house&#34; rather than a run of the mill family restaurant, it needs a little panache.  Or something.
The service:  okay.  I&#39;ve been here twice I think?  Once for drinks, once for dinner and a drink.  Both times we had decent service.  Our first bartender had the personality of a wet mop, but she did a good job of checking on us and made a decent chocolate martini.  Our bartender the second time around had a very boisterous personality and was great for making food suggestions.
The drink selection is okay, their margarita is very standard, using a mix, served in a pint glass.  Not the type of margarita I&#39;d like more than one of, and frankly, I think their drinks are a little overpriced.  I guess it&#39;s tough sh*t for a cocktail drinker when you&#39;re in an ale house.

The house chips are ok and the French onion dip would be great if it wasn&#39;t solid. 
Guacamole also frozen, and loose. Not creamy or even chunky. Thawed out and watery.

Chopped Salad - Blah. cubes of jack cheese are not easy to eat. Dressing is awesome.

Filet Medallions trio - I am not even sure how 4 (yes 4) 1&#34; pieces of pyramidal steak with a bit of breadcrumbs on it equals a trio. Looked completely unappetizing.

Fox Club sandwich - 2 (yes 4 mini sandwiches) that were squashed beyond recognition. Super greasy and lacked any taste.

Smokehouse sandwich - Bacon on a pork sandwich sounds perfect right? Nope. I pulled all the bacon off. Crispy onions were soggy. Pork was meh. Sauce was meh. Waffle fries (1$ extra) were soggy and again obviously frozen.

- Burgers are extremely overpriced (average price is $11.00) and come on &#39;pretzel-type&#39; rolls or buns.  While they weren&#39;t terrible by any means, they weren&#39;t all that great, especially at 11.00.  

(In comparison - much larger and better tasting burgers can be found at Hawthorne&#39;s in West Chicago for an average price of $8.00 with fries, or even a &#34;lunch special&#34; which is available all day every day at Rosati&#39;s in West Chicago - they have a great burger, fries, and can of soda for about $5.75).

- Baked potatos come very small, or as a &#34;half potato&#34; with NO SIDES offered, not even butter.  We had to ask for sour cream.  Who eats plain potatos?

- Steak that one of my family member&#39;s had was very small (price was about 13.99) and like the burgers, worth nowhere near the price.

- Service and waitresses were indeed nice and friendly, but seemed to push &#34;drinks&#34; more than the dinner.  So it seemed to be more of an atmosphere of &#34;drinks and food&#34;, not &#34;food and drinks.&#34;  

- Restaurant itself was clean and nicely decorated, so there are no issues there.  As mentioned, service for us seemed to be pretty good.

Overall though, overly expensive and you don&#39;t get a good bargain for your buck here.  Hence why you see places like Portillo&#39;s (2 blocks up the road) always MOBBED (and Portillo&#39;s is by no means cheapy-cheap, either), and why this place isn&#39;t ever overly crowded.

Their are several booths and a long bar for you to cheer or scream at the tv. 

The Menu is very limited:

Apps
Burgers
Sandwiches
Taco
Pasta

If you aren&#39;t in the mood for any of those items, then you are out of luck. That being said, this is an Ale House so you shouldn&#39;t be expecting Seared Tuna Salad, etc.

The burgers are premium priced in the $10-$11, but they get credit for being creative in their offerings (i.e. Pork Belly, fried egg, etc.). 

The Pub Chips are a good starter; they come with enough Onion Dip to feed a few Super Bowl Parties.

The Tacos are nicely presented, but the blackened fish preparation definitely needs more blackening. The come with a bowl of buttered rice.

Anyway - the space is interesting; large with the standard &#34;wall of TV&#39;s&#34; ambience.  Fortunately, the sound was turned down on all of them last night.  (I hope restaurants get away from this decorating scheme someday soon.)  We were seated promptly by the marvelous and courteous staff.  Unfortunately, there was the faint whiff of something unpleasant in the air.  Plumbing issue?  Off-putting, but not bad enough to scare us away.

The entree menu is limited and fairly pedestrian: nothing really screams &#34;foodie destination&#34;.  But - having said that - everywhere you look, there are LARGE, BEAUTIFUL plates of excellent food being delivered to table.  The draft beer selection is staggering.  The plated presentations were pretty to look at, piping hot, and quite delicious.  My only nit to pick would be the slightly heavy hand with the salt; other than that, this just might be one of the Fox Valley&#39;s best new go-to&#39;s for tasty food at a realistic price point.

The GM was doing the table-to-table, and was a very knowledgeable and personable guy.  He seems to really enjoy his work - and it shows.

They do a good job of combining the ease and quickness of a fast food restaurant with the comfort and service of a sit down restaurant.  I went at noon on a Thursday, and was met with a pretty substantial lunch crowd.  Despite the busyness, I was able to easily find a seat and my food arrived quickly.  One of the neat things they do is bring your food out to you.  Which makes this place feel less like fast food and more like a sit in diner.
     When it comes to burgers, I prefer to keep it simple.  As usual, I ordered a cheeseburger with ketchup, mustard, and pickle only, and a side of fries.  As a result, I&#39;m usually always satisfied and I feel like I can more accurately assess each burger using the same criteria.  
     Meatheads offered a pretty good burger, but at its price, it failed to make the grade.  If I&#39;m gonna pay almost 12 dollars for a burger, fries, and a soda, you&#39;ve got to do better than a good fast food burger.  Which is exactly what meatheads offered; they were better than McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, etc., but they failed to compete with the premium joints like five guys, portillo&#39;s, and culver&#39;s.
     Ps, if you&#39;re interested, my top &#34;fast food&#34; burger right now is five guys, followed closely by portillo&#39;s.  I make it a point to search out fast food burger joints, and I&#39;ve tried a pretty good amount.  In &amp; out is probably my least favorite.",04/02/16,185,3,2,5,29,4.540799999999999,2.5180000000000002,0.687,11.793999999999999,No,1506

They will do a lettuce wrap instead of a bun which is great if you are doing gluten free.  However, I normally end up cutting everything up like a salad because the lettuce wrap is always positioned in a way that falls apart.  Everything tastes good and sometimes that is all that matters.

Normally I share fries with someone.  A small fry serves two and a large can serve 3 or 4.  The fries here are tasty fresh cut style.  You can get them regular or Cajun.

To best test a burger, I went for the basics: mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion on the 1/3 lb meathead, with cheddar cheese. I also ordered the chili cheese fries with chopped onions.

The food came out fairly quickly. The chili cheese fries featured fresh hand cut shoestring potatoes, with a mound of chili and a cheese sauce. I was disappointed with the cheese sauce, but the chili was pretty good. It was milder than I would have liked (I&#39;ve been living in Texas too long), but didn&#39;t have the cumin/chili powder excess some chilis have. 

The burger was, well, okay. Two thin patties with cheese and condiments on a plain bun. Nothing too exciting. Since the patties were thinner, there wasn&#39;t the juicy mess that corresponds to what one would think of a 1/3 lb patty. This was more of an imitation of an In-and-Out Double Double, without the melting cheese and greasy mess that makes the Double Double such an iconic burger.

meatheads-schaumburg,Eric G.,PVG8Mven0Swjrwxg_C5a4Q,GQQA7YhPRSBa9Z7wfa9q_Q,"I had just left Whole Foods spending almost $60 on three items, two of which were honey related.    So after fighting for holiday parking at the streets of Woodfield, I saw the sign for Meatheads which seemed oddly appropriate considering my earlier purchases.    So I knew I had to check it out for lunch.

I decided to get the burger to go.    The decor definitely gave me a Smashburger / Five Guys vibe.    There was a small crowd in front of me.    I was pleasantly surprised to hear a customer request unsalted fries and the lady behind the counter complying.
I&#39;m not opposed to salt but hate how liberally it&#39;s applied to fries in general at any burger joint.

So when my time came up, I made the same request.   Since I ordered to go, I stood on the side with my number, which had the cool fact that only 8% of all U.S. beef can be classified as Angus.   I made a custom burger of honey mustard, pickles, grilled onions, and ketchup.    Pretty basic ingredients.

Customer service was very good from the lady taking my order to the one who delivered it to me.

The order took around ten minutes, which was fine.   The burger itself didn&#39;t really have any flavor to it.   I&#39;m assuming the condiments is where they expect the flavors to pop and perhaps I should&#39;ve ordered one of their limited custom burgers.   With that said it was an okay burger.    It is cool they offer a lettuce burger for the Adkins crowd.

The fries wound up being salted though which was a disappointment considering my request.    Maybe I might&#39;ve gotten residual salt from the trays itself, which if that&#39;s the case, definitely shows that they put way too much salt to begin with.   On the flip side, they give you plenty of fries so no complaints in that department.",16/12/14,192,3,1,2,-19,1.3470999999999997,2.182,0.9139999999999999,17.904,No,1778

The interior is very clean and casual; the first thing that caught my eye is a Coke Freestyle machine (hello, Strawberry Fanta Zero!).  My boyfriend is a HUGE fan of Coke Freestyle, so I made a mental note to recommend this place to him---after trying the food, of course.

I ordered a 1/2 pound burger with American cheese, regular fries, a side of Bistro sauce, and a soft drink.  My food came to my table pretty quickly; I probably waited about 8 minutes.  The fries were pretty tasty, especially with the Bistro sauce (which to me, tastes like a spicy thousand island dressing).  The burger was pretty good, but very greasy.  I mean, grease and condiments dripping off of the burger, down your arm, on the table.  Sometimes I enjoy a messy burger (today being one of those times), but beware for those who don&#39;t.

This is probably the most important detail from my visit this week. I was in the area at lunchtime for a continuing education class. We were on day number two and I wanted something I hadn&#39;t tried before. A girlfriend suggested Meatheads and off we went. 

Parking at 12:15pm on a Thursday wasn&#39;t as bad as I would have imagined. There was no line and we quickly made some decisions. 1/3 burgers for both of us. Get toppings included some cheese and other things that aren&#39;t exactly up my alley. I went with bacon, grilled onions and BBQ sauce on the side. She tried the Cajun fries while I stuck with the regular ones. 

I tried the Coke Freestyle machine. It was cool. I was hoping for caffeine free regular Coke that I could turn into caffeine free cherry Coke, but alas there was no caffeine free regular Coke. Maybe someday Coca Cola will answer my plea...

We grabbed a corner booth and waited with our little order numbers. Both orders came out quickly. Hers was wrong. Her mayo was missing and I think the tomato didn&#39;t make the plate either. She mentioned it to me, but we were under a bit of a time constraint and so she ate it as is. She loved the Cajun fries!!  I tried a couple and thought they were pretty good too. My burger had a nice serving of bacon. But some of it was cooked perfectly and some of it was charred. I like crispy bacon. That&#39;s often how I order it. But this seemed like some pieces were scrapped off the bottom of the pan after being in there way too long. The grilled onions were not really grilled but rather just greasy onions. My regular fries were hot, nice and crispy and just very good. Neither or us were fans of the double patty of meat that seemed dry and under seasoned. 

A gal came by and asked how everything was but before we could say anything or even acknowledge her presence, she was gone. It was like she was meeting her quota of asking, but not waiting for a response. A manager in a dress shirt came by to ask the same question, but he was very nice and waited for the response. He also cleared our plates once we were done. I like a manager who gets out there and does what needs to be done. Someone who isn&#39;t afraid to get their hands dirty.

I&#39;m in Schaumburg from out of town (all the way from California), so I&#39;ve never been to a Meatheads ever. Are they a chain even? I&#39;m not entirely sure. Anyway, I walked up to the menu board completely unsure of what I was in the mood for. The girl behind the counter was extremely helpful in making suggestions, which I always appreciate. She asked a lot of great questions to really help us order what we really wanted (which ended up being a basket each of regular and cajun fries), and her menu knowledge was impeccable! But I think what really impressed me was her attention to detail when actually serving the food. She could have easily dropped it and never come back (which I wouldn&#39;t have held against her given the style of restaurant). Nevertheless, she came back around to check in and even offered to toss the nearly full basket of regular fries in the cajun seasoning after discovering the cajun basket was almost empty!

I was thinking that as I went to yet another gourmet burger chain (at least the third in the western suburbs). Meatheads competes with the likes of Tom and Eddies and Smashburger, and does a good job of it.

I had a Californian, while my wife had a Hawaiian burger. The Californian was quite good - you can never go wrong when an avocado is in your burger, even if sliced and falls out of the burger. The wasabi sauce gave it just a bit of heat, but more importantly made the burger not just taste like meat and avocadoes.

What I remember about my wife&#39;s Hawaiian was that the pineapple was marinated and tasty.

The fries were standard fare, so far as I remember; nothing to write home about. Perhaps I&#39;ll try the chili cheese fries next time.",21/06/13,96,4,1,2,-5,1.0277,0.5980000000000001,0.265,8.137,No,874

My family went to legoland around the corner for my sons impromptu 3rd birthday and instead of paying $10 for a deli sandwich and a juice box we called meatheads to see if they were ok to bring our party there... Last minute. They totally accommodated us, even put out reserved signs for us. And even though we came in hours later, they welcomed us and helped us  steer all the kids in- having the little kids craft ready for them. As far as service goes, they seemed to genuinely enjoy that we were there and made our chaos feel welcome. They got the food out very quickly and put some assembly to us. 

As far as quality of food, de-licious! The burgers were well made. Easily comparable to five guys and smash burger. (Granted I&#39;m not a fan of either of those places for different reasons.) I love that they have integrity in the quality of food and give great suggestions for burger options. Chili Cheese fries would bring me back by themselves. The kids all finished all their food. The chicken tenders were so moist and flavorful, hot dog was huge. They even allowed us to bring in our own cake but provided everything else for us- including the lighter.

These were some tasty fries that they had here, especially the Cajun fries. They were full of real potato flavor and the Cajun seasonings just added to it nicely, not overpowering. Texture, flavor, temperature of fries: pretty close to perfect.  I got the Californian burger and it was very good but I do wish that the patty itself was thicker (juiciness factor) so next time I will get a thicker burger. The cucumber was wasabi sauce on the sandwich was great and it was also good for dipping a couple fries.

I was a bit apprehensive to try out this Streets of Woodfield goodie...and I don&#39;t really know why. Perhaps the opportunity for disappointment? Truth be told, my expectations were mediocre at best, but the two burgers I sampled exceeded those expectations. WIN. 

Meatheads is a pretty straightforward burger (and chicken and shakes and sides) bar. Order up at the counter, grab your number, snag your overly sugared Coke Freestyle machine made bevvie and have a seat. Hubs and I went halvsies on two specialty burgers: the Californian and the Hawaiian. What can I say...we were feeling coasty. 

Both burgers were equally as tasty - The California featuring avocado, pepperjack cheese and a fancy wasabi aioli. It had a perfectly delightful kick! The Hawaiian was stacked with jalapeno, pineapple and BBQ sauce. While I initially had a bit of trepidation wrapping my head around the pineapple/beef/jalapeno combination, it ended up rounding out the flavors quite well. Both burgers are certainly worth trying.

Size wise, these burgers were moderate - a nice weight for me but I think Todd W might have left a little hungry as we went sans sides. Also, worth noting that the burger itself is a bit pricey at $6+ each. Extra points for all natural burgers and no freezers, though.

Aside from bringing all of the food out for you, they bring anything you may have forgot. I asked for mayo (it&#39;s a white person thing, apparently) and bah bam! Brought to my table.

I paid $6.41 for a Lil Meatheads kid&#39;s meal. This is honestly a good size because you get a one patty burger, a good amount of fries and a tiny drink. Dining in, the tiny sized drink doesn&#39;t matter though because there are free refills! Yay! The cheese on my burger cost me an extra $1. :( I don&#39;t like being charged so much extra for cheese. Even 50 cents would seem more acceptable. But honestly that just means in the future I will not be getting cheese! I can&#39;t justify the extra dollar just for cheese!

My burger was the bomb diggy though as usual. That bacon ranch sauce is just awesome but I think I&#39;m going to try the bleu cheese next time since I won&#39;t be doing the cheese slices. The fries are also off the hook with a little sauce (you can get any of the sauces for your fries that you got for your burger).

I decided to try the California Burger. It was juicy, dripping with pepper jack cheese, and topped with a wasabi sauce and avocado. It&#39;s better (by far) than a burger from McDonald&#39;s or Burger King. They are a little pricey (a little over $6 for a burger alone), but it is about what you would pay at a sit-down restaurant. You can take it to-go or stay in and eat.

meatheads-schaumburg,Jacob J.,1xJwMqmvVXPwY7yEVQIc-A,XLnpucJD_fBkOmWj8wJaCQ,"I heard about Meatheads from co-workers that would go on and on about it. So I bookmarked it for the future. Meatheads to me is like any other burger bar but alike those that range in the same market as Five Guys or the Counter. Per advertising; Meatheads boasts using fresh Angus beef (which is never frozen), fresh baked buns and fresh cut fries; they also make hand dipped milk shakes. 

One can compose their own burger with an array of options or choose from one of their specialty burgers. Some of their more interesting toppings: sauerkraut, jalapenos, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and pineapple! These are considered free toppings. Meatheads also offers a variety of sauces available upon request and which come atop their specialty burgers. Sauces which grasped my attention; cucumber wasabi and Thousand Island. On the side they offer a few different hot sauces and interesting ketchup / hot sauce concoctions most of us may have seen at our local grocers. 

Meat patties are thin and could be hand formed so if you are the average eater that often packs their meal to go, I would suggest going for a double. I chose the Cajun sunrise burger because it contained a fried egg, pepper jack cheese, jalapeno slices, bacon, blue cheese sauce, lettuce and tomato. It may sound like a lot, but with a single patty it isn&#39;t much when contained within buttered buns, we accompanied this feat with chili cheese fries. (Photos are uploaded) The chili and cheese went well together but were mild. The burger was built perfectly, but hardly satisfied my afternoon appetite. With drink I rounded out to about twelve and a half dollars. That&#39;s uber pricey for a burger bar. I could have done it cheaper by going with regular fries. All in all, pretty good stuff. But after having spent that much money and not feeling full, I left feeling disappointed. 

Service goes out of their way to make sure your visit is a happy one.  Meatheads is a chain whose beginnings started in Illinois and as of late has been spreading out up North.  What they have going for them is good leadership and one that&#39;s keeping a watchful eye on striving to keep things going well.  Kudos to the expanding business.

After posting my review, I received an email from someone at Meatheads who showed genuine concern about some of my comments.  We decided to give it another chance.  This time, they came through with flying colors.

For fun, I ordered both a 1/3 lb burger and a foot long hot dog.  My wife also got a burger with fries.  I&#39;d been really craving a hot dog for some time and this was my chance.  They serve Vienna Beef all beef dogs. Like their hamburgers, you can get pretty much whatever you want on the dog.  Being from New Jersey originally, I like my hot dogs New York style - simply mustard and relish.  They grill their hot dogs on a flat top.  So much better than the boiled or steamed dogs at other places.  Also, they serve it on a New England split top bun - a nice change from the typical.

My hamburger was pretty loaded and very good - if I remember right - mustard, ketchup, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, red peppers, and jalapenos.   The fries are hand cut and crispy.  

One other point of note - their drink machines have many, many combinations.  For example, you can get Coca-Cola with vanilla, chocolate, cherry, lemon and several other flavors.  I believe you can do the same with other soda brands too.

For example, I don&#39;t reflect back on my experience as either exceptional or atrocious. It was good, and I would go again, but I don&#39;t think I would make the trek to Schaumburg solely to have a Meathead burger.

I went with two friends and we each got different burgers. I got the Hawaiian burger, Cajun fries, and a featured milkshake. My two buddies only got burgers - no fries and no milkshake. I guess I&#39;m the piggie of the three of us. No matter - I&#39;ll still eat with pride and sparkle.

I digress. I was pleased that a short conversation at the counter helped me to get a kiddie sized Hawaiian burger (certainly more manageable for me). The burger came with a pineapple ring and lots of freshly sliced jalapenos. The patty was pretty thin. I hungrily ate most of my burger with the jalapenos and then had to scrape them off for the last two bites. They just got to be too much. My huger must have clouded my taste buds in the beginning. My Cajun fries were tasty and the shake was okay. My pals really didn&#39;t say too much about their burgers.

In regards to the atmosphere and the service: it was super casual. As I said before, we ordered at a counter and then our food was brought to our table. The tables were squeezed pretty tightly together and business was bustling. My friends liked the touchscreen pop dispenser. A manager (at least I assume it was the manager) came and checked on us.

The fries are thicker than the shoestring fries at Smashburger but are kinda boring. They don&#39;t have an option for sweet potato fries.

Pricing is similar to Smashburger.

I found them to be OK the first time, but quite messy. After returning, I think my opinion is slightly higher, but not by much. I don&#39;t think they are bad at all, just not as good as some other burger places in the area. It wasn&#39;t as messy this time, but we still had to be extra careful not to get sauce and juice on our clothing. My friend experienced the same trouble I had, though. Sauce was running down his hand and wrists. I don&#39;t think the bun holds up that well to all the condiments. You pick up the burger and the contents immediately begin to slide out.

This time the fries were better. We ordered the chili cheese fries. They were pretty good and my burger was decent. However, the most flavorful thing on it was the sliced onion. I came back excited to try the Bacon Ranch Sauce and was quite sad to find it lacked flavor. If you hadn&#39;t told me there was bacon in it then I&#39;d never have guessed. In fact, it didn&#39;t even taste that much like ranch. If you put a ton of toppings on my burger then I expect an explosion of flavor. I just didn&#39;t get that, but it was still a good burger.

I&#39;m going to have to stick with my original three star rating. I think the food is decent and the prices are pretty standard for mid-level gourmet grill. I just think that what I&#39;ve ordered seems like a fancy Wendy&#39;s. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Wendy&#39;s. They are probably the freshest/healthiest of the fast food burger places.

meatheads-schaumburg,Bernice R.,KWFYtIdXHTUEy965LeTHMw,HDOx7t10_H0xBbnMfQWmHA,"Round Two: Courtesy of Meatheads (Thanks!)

This time around I went for their Chicken Sandwich and shared some fries with my fiance.  On my chicken sandwich, I added cucumber wasabi sauce, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce for free, and provolone cheese for $1 more.  The flavor combination was similar to the Californian but with chicken of course, a different cheese, some onions and no cucumber or avocado.  

What my new verdict?!?!  The sandwich was... okay!  Really, acceptable, from what I was expecting.  Each bite I was able to taste the toppings that I selected.  That was good.  As for the main component of the sandwich, the chicken, it was juicy, just the right size, but unfortunately just a tiny bit salty.  I wish they had an option for a different type bun, perhaps a pretzel bun, as it could soak all the juices and such.  It also probably could have balanced the said chicken too. But this instance might have been an off day.  It was alright, it didn&#39;t deter me from finishing it.  Just  happy their drinks are self-service aka refillable!

Anyway,  this visit I also discovered their different types of ketchup (habanero and chipotle).  Did they add to my fries/sandwich experience?  Slightly.  I enjoyed trying them and that&#39;s pretty much it.

A few aspects I enjoyed once again were their music choice, promptness of service, cleanliness, and chill atmosphere.

Overall, would I go here again? It wouldn&#39;t be my first choice, but its fine.  The quality is in between fast food drive-in places and a full dining service place like Friday&#39;s; but the prices are still in line with the Friday&#39;s side of the spectrum.",14/03/12,195,3,2,5,35,4.875500000000001,4.103000000000001,0.242,18.655,No,1651

I am a HUGE cheeseburger fan, ranging from your Wendys Drive Thru to your Foodie Gourmet Burgers Downtown.  With that preface, I&#39;d have to say Meatheads continues to be a reliable place to get a great cheeseburger, with fresh ingredients, tasty fries and great service.
.
I usually get the 1/3 to 1/2lb meathead burger with cheese and most of the toppings, and usually add a fried egg for a little extra $.  (That fried eggs makes a world of difference).  Cajun Fries with a side of cheese.  I love the seasoning of the fries and how they come out hot and fresh. And I also enjoy the touch screen soda dispensers that allow a myriad of combinations (orange diet coke....... awesome, no more manually mixing orange Fanta and diet coke on my own!).

With the recent addition of Smashburger  and 5 Guys now we have Meatheads. Now I haven&#39;t tried Smashburger yet so ill hold back on really bashing any of them....yet. I will say this - this place serves a damn good burger and fries.

Unlike 5 Guys they execute the cooking of the burger better. Perfectly seasoned - unlike most places! Also the free toppings are a bonus. It sucks that you have to pay more for cheese and bacon but you can&#39;t win them all.

We got a couple burger obviously with some cajun fries. I like mine spicy so i opted for the jalapenos, mushrooms, grilled onions, and pepperjack. I would say that it would have worked better if the peppers were pickled and not fresh. The girlfriend got a more basic one with the bacon ranch sauce on it. Although it sounds good the bacon ranch lacked the punch to get through all the toppings and the burger itself. The highlight I think was the wasabi ranch that we got on the side to dip the fries in. 

So far the best execute burger from these new chains. I would choose this over 5 Guys for now not only for quality but also for the price - it was more affordable especially when your trying to grasp the idea your only getting a burger and fries.

As other reviews have mentioned, this is pretty similar to Five Guys. It&#39;s sort of the Qdoba versus Chipotle debate -- Meatheads being the Qdoba. Same basic idea, a few more options.

The burgers come in three sizes: 1/4 lb (&#34;lil meathead&#34;), 1/3 lb, and 1/2 lb. They&#39;re thinner and griddled, with nice edges while still being juicy and just a wee bit pink in the middle. The fries are nice and crispy, a bit thinner than Five Guys&#39;, done just right.

There are a huge amount of toppings, including many cheeses, veggies galore, bacon, egg, and about seven different sauces. Most are free; cheese &amp; egg are $1, bacon is .75c, as is avocado. Fries come in regular and large -- a large is plenty for 2 people to share -- and cajun and regular. Good to know: they have cajun seasoning on the condiment bar if you want it on the side. They also have malt vinegar, hot sauce, A-1, etc.

While it&#39;s not dirt cheap, this is good food, considerably better than your average quickie burger joint, made with real ingredients -- a good value for the menu. We got a 1/4 lb and 1/3 lb burger, cheese and bacon on one, and a large fry - about $14 and we left full and happy. (P.S. To really save money? Drink water. Everyone knows soda&#39;s prices are jacked up.)

Been to a Steak N Shake recently? Well, imagine a burger with smaller patties then those, that cost twice as much. No, I&#39;m not kidding.

I was right. But given their name and their specialty (meat dripping hamburgers), I won&#39;t hold it against them.

First, the atmosphere is nice. The restaurant is open, airy and has good karma. The staff is friendly and attentive.

I ordered a &#34;burger&#34; with only avocado (Mmmm!), lettuce, tomatoes and onions. It came divided into little triangles with toothpicks holding everything together. I really liked this as it made the burger easier to eat. It was nice to have a burger, without the meat patty, that&#39;s not just random ingredients slapped on 2 hamburger buns.

The ingredients tasted fresh. No wilting lettuce or mushy tomatoes. The bread wasn&#39;t stale or anything. So in all, it was a very tasty meal.

I also ordered a side of french fries. The fries come out on a huge plate and there was enough for all 4 of us on that one order. The fries were good. Not soggy. Not too salty. Not burned or overcooked. They could&#39;ve used a little more &#34;zest&#34; but nothing I&#39;m going to complain about.

Meatheads kinda reminds me of a mini Culvers. I like how you basically customize your own burger with the list of ingredients posted behind the cashier. 

My one big complaint about Meatheads is that it is pretty pricey for a burger joint - over $10 per person. The prices are preventing me from giving this place 5 stars.

I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go to Meatheads. It&#39;s not really a &#34;destination&#34; restaurant. Rather, if I&#39;m in an area and there&#39;s a Meatheads around, I&#39;d definitely go there.

Apart from the stellar service, not much else can be described with such positive terms. The place is crowded, and although you get some cool burger customization choices and different sauces for your fries, that&#39;s where the fun ends. 

The burger has two thin patties and it&#39;s incredibly greasy; even more so with cheese. You really don&#39;t taste much apart from the napkin to wipe the grease off your lips....

My buddies split a large fry and sent it back because it was too salty. Honestly, when three guys under 30 complain about food being too salty, something is awry. My own fries weren&#39;t as bad as theirs, but still saline to the point I decided not to finish them for the sake of not developing heart disease that day. 

If someday I should return here, maybe I&#39;d have one of their &#34;famous&#34; hot dogs. Otherwise, their burgers (which are supposed to be their forte) are a giant fail.",12/11/10,123,2,2,2,36,1.9634,1.166,0.361,8.473,No,1115

I had to give it a try, and it did not disappoint, very flavorful, with a kick to it. besides the dosa, I also really liked the Chili Chicken.

My husband and I were invited to dinner today by someone and we were to meet him at 8 pm, due to the heavy rain coming in, we decided to head out earlier since we live about 30 min away.  We arrived at the restaurant about 7:30 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty other than 1 family sitting and another one that joined in a little later.  We were seated right away, and the first thing i noticed was the nice interior furniture as well as the lighting, which was a great improvement from the last restaurant that was housed there.  We decided to wait for our friend to order and in the mean time decided to check out their menu (which is not specific to one thing...you can find south indian, north indian, chinese , everything mixed in) We decided it would be fine to wait to order since the restaurant was empty; its not like we were holding up a table for a crowd of people waiting to come in.  At about  8 pm, a guy in a black shirt, who I assume is the manager from the many other google reviews I read online, came up to us very sarcastically and asked if we were going to order and if someone was even coming and then he added , &#39;well hopefully he gets here before 10 because we close at 10.&#39;  in no way was he trying to tell a joke, he was rudely sarcastic. We felt so bad that we just decided to order two drinks, my husband ordered a mango lassi and I ordered the almond milk.  As soon as we ordered it, within seconds, we had the drink in our hand.  now, you might think this is great service...but ...these drinks were pre-made and placed into plastic cups and put in a fridge.  We didn&#39;t think much since i&#39;m sure many places don&#39;t make these things right away.  The drinks were definitely good, so thats 1 plus for them.  Our friend finally arrived a few minutes later, and you could see the manager and all the staff just in shock.  When one of the waiters came over, I told him,&#39; you guys thought no one was coming right? &#34; He just smirked and said nothing.  Now , lets get to the food...not a fan AT ALL.  We travel a lot due to the businesses we own and we eat and different places from hole in the wall to 5 star restaurants ...and this food was just awful....too spicy ....the flavor was not flattering...our appetizer seemed too crispy....and let me add...our appetizer came in...followed by 1 of our entree dishes...and then a few minutes later...another entree dish...and a few minutes later....another entree...followed by at least 15 minutes and here comes the naan .  Aren&#39;t restaurants supposed to bring all the entrees in together? Also, let me tell you, when we asked about some dishes...we were told it would take 25 minutes to make.  Oh, and did i mention that when my husband asked to try the Limca drink, he was rudely told, &#39; no we wont have that, we have lemonade &#39;.  I pointed out that on their menu it said they serve Limca. If you didn&#39;t have it, why be rude? Why not just say, oh i&#39;m sorry, unfortunately we are out.  

I read a lot of google reviews on this place...and I wish i had read it prior to going into this restaurant....the manager was RUDE....the service was awful ....although the guy in the glasses that served us was trying to be nice as much as he knew how to....the food was awful.  

I would avoid this place ....let me also add..if you are an Indian restaurant....why cater to just one type of Indian community? The majority of the time we were there...they had Tamil videos playing....finally ...maybe after hearing us...they changed it to hindi songs that everyone can enjoy .

I had never been to Bawarchi, so I decided to give it a try for lunch.  When on a road trip down in Florida I saw Apollo fish on a menu at another restaurant.  I was traveling with my Indian friend, Syed, and he was amazed he saw that fish in an American restaurant.  We hardly ever see it anywhere.  Well Bawarchi had it so I had to give it a try!  I got the Apollo fish, butter chicken, garlic naan, and rice.  I ordered for takeout.  It took about 20 minutes to get my food, which is what they told me it would take.

When I walked in, I was greeted by a friendly lady behind the counter, and I also was greeted by two other workers.  All very friendly and smiles on their faces.  The interior is nice and clean.

So now to the food.  I live very close to here, so I was home and eating within about 5 minutes of leaving the restaurant.  The food was good.  The single gripe I have is the Apollo fish was cold and tough - not anywhere close to how I remembered.  But, that is probably just due to me taking it home and it cooling a bit.  The butter chicken was still super hot, almost too hot to touch the container.  Everything was tasty.  I did ask for spicy.  They could have made it even more spicy for me, but, perhaps they thought I couldn&#39;t handle it lol.  Next time I&#39;ll tell them to make it even more spicy.

Overall I&#39;d give the food 3 stars, service was good and friendly.  I am going to give my total review 4 stars for now.  As I go here more, I will update if there is a need to.

***Update.  Down to 2 stars.  I got takeout here for dinner - 2nd order on same day.  Went with Syed and we got Apollo fish (he wanted to give it a try even though I said I wasn&#39;t impressed) and a shrimp dish.  Again pickup order.  Got home in same time and the Apollo fish was way different this time.  Soft, hot, and super tasty.  I am disappointed at how different the same fish was at 2 different times of the same day.  The first one was simply horrible, but, the 2nd order was very good.  Consistency is key.",28/06/16,256,2,2,5,12,5.4216999999999995,4.072,0.53,31.398000000000003,No,2123

First off you must know this is not a fine dine, fancy overpriced experience, some people are used to with Indian Cuisine.

It might not be for everyone, like I said the flavors are bold, can be spicy but if that&#39;s what you like, your in for a treat. The menu is pretty extensive, heavy on the south Indian side. Food comes pretty fast. Infact the take out line was just as long as the amount of people in the restaurant. The Avacai biryani was some of the best I have ever had.

After waiting for a half hour(reasonable, no complaints about that) we were so excited to eat our food. We get home to eat, and ended up being so disappointed. 

The tandoor chicken was super dry and actually pieces of it were slightly burnt. Not so tasty....

On the other hand, the masala in the dosa was delicious. It was warm and flavorful and just right. Sadly, the dosa itself was stale/dry.

Anyway, the quantity and quality of the food in comparison to the price was unbelievable.  The naan was buttery, soft, and perfectly chewy.  The butter chicken was loaded with chicken pieces, and the fish curry had the right amount of zing and flavor.  Both of these gravy dishes came with huge sides of plain  basmati rice which had superb taste and aroma in itself.

When I looked around, the other person at the counter also walked up, asking if he could help. They leave extra napkins and cutlery on an extra plate - rather than leave the cutlery, un-hygienically, on the table. Even when they brought us knives, they set them resting on our plates and not on the table. Nice to see such level of detail for hygiene. 

I ordered, mostly based on the Waitresses recommendation of what was popular at Bawarchi. 

Chicken 555: 5 star. Yes, it is about as good as it gets, for this type of dish. I have tried similar dishes in India and this is as good as I would find in India. This is very similar to Chicken 65, a popular and common appetizer in Indian restaurants. In fact, I met the guy who came up with the dish Chicken 65 - he said it was item #65 in his menu.. many years ago, at his restaurant in Hyderabad, India. Chicken 555 was as good - it is a dry, deep fried chicken dish and was superb.  Even though I have given a 3 star over all rating, I think there might be a good possibility that Bawarchi would have more 5 star deserving appetizers. 

Chicken dum Biryani: 3.5 star. It was good. But nothing special.

Szechwan chicken fried rice: 2 star. I have tried Indian chinese style fried rice at many Chinese restaurants in India and this is - Meh. I have experienced better. 

Chicken Noodles, chinese style: 2 star. Meh, I have experienced better. 

Bawarchi seems to be a franchise. I have been to Bawarchi in Plano, TX. It was amazing, deserving 5 stars (I reviewed it here on Yelp). At that location, both Indian and Chinese dishes were amazing. With that positive expectation, I drove two hours to dine here. It was quite disappointing. Fortunately, they did not have buffets. One cannot go for a $12 buffet and expect gourmet food. I avoid Buffet places. Bawarchi has extensive menu and it is likely that they have excellent apetizers. 

But because of the entrees, this deserves two stars but counting its excellent appetizer and service, I thought I would change that to 3 stars. 

PS: Bombay chopstix, which is close by also is an Indian chinese restaurant and has excellent apetizers. The entrees at Bombay chopstix and at Bawarchi were both about 2 to 3 stars..

If you like authentic south indian food with the masala and spice this is by far one of the best places in the Schaumburg area.  They have only been open for about 10days, so I am sure once they get their act together this place is going to be awesome.  

My only suggestion would be that the biryani should come with more riatha or yogurt on the side.  The quantity given in a single order of biryani is enough for two people, but they only give about 3 spoons of yogurt on the side, which not really enough.

If you are craving some good old fashion South Indian Hyderabad food, this is going to be the new goto place.  I look forward to trying the other dishes on the menu that were not available, including dosa, chili idly, and some of the other south indian specialties.  I am also hoping that the servers become more familiar with the menu and are able to communicate the specials better.  We are definitely looking forward to coming back.",24/09/15,236,4,2,5,21,5.672000000000001,2.281,0.204,12.515,No,2110

The waiter guy says sorry but we will only give takeaway now. Another one says, actually no it&#39;s closed but allright one last order for you will can take! 
Obviously disappointed and no choice left 5 of us decided to take away food.

2) The containers are not microwavable even though they looked like it. It burnt a hole within a minute and half into microwaving. 

3) I re-ordered something I had liked earlier and noticed that it turned out to be a completely different tasting dish. Consistency issues with recipes.

mcdonalds-elgin-7,T J.,XzMF8qQRHlNwhpVJlt_S5Q,zU6GD526NHrl3MrsQWGhmw,"This McDonald&#39;s is having their grand reopening after a complete remodel, so I thought I would have lunch there.  I have dined here many times, but this was my first time post remodel. The parking lot had very few spaces available, but when I got inside, I noticed that there were many employees working, but probably only about 8 customers. I guess the employees take up most of the parking spaces.  The parking has always been bad at this location, because the line for the drive through blocks many of the parking spots, and people will not let you out when you are trying to back out of your spot.  I would have hoped they could have figured out a way to fix this in the remodel, but the parking lot did not look like it had been changed.

The first thing I noticed when entering the restaurant was that both of the glass doors were filthy, with fingerprints everywhere.  At no time during the 45 minutes I was in the restaurant did anyone clean the doors or the glass, and at one time they had 2 people cleaning in the lobby. Major disappointment.

The service was fast. They have implemented a new system with a digital display above the cash registers where you are supposed to look for when your order is ready to pick up.  I guess service is getting less personal all the time.

I went over to fill up my drink cup at the self service beverage station. I noticed a female worker opening up the napkin dispenser and placing a few napkins into it.  This immediately drew my attention because the napkin dispenser was about 90% full so she was not restocking it.  I figured out what she was doing was if a customer left any napkins on their table, after they left, she was picking them up, and going and putting them back in the napkin dispenser to the right of the self service drink station. This was a major disappointment, so much so that after I saw it happen again, I felt compelled to speak to the manager to bring this to her attention. This is just plan unsanitary and I&#39;m sure a violation of health code regulations.

The design of the new dining area is really poor.  I was hoping that they would add significantly more seating in the remodel.  Instead they chose weird design over function, so fewer tables take up more space.  They cut off probably 20 or 30 feet of the old playplace and switched it over to dining space.  However, that new space was utilized poorly with some tables with high stools and others with low circular padded seats with no backs similar to an ottoman.  It felt really weird sitting on this ottoman like thing. The other choice was a hard looking preformed plastic chair that looked like something you would see for sale at a discount department department store, with no comfort.

My food quality was what I would have expected for McDonalds.  The hamburger was warm, but dry (which is a byproduct of the made for you cooking system where all the hamburger patties are cooked in advance and put into warming drawers). The fries were hot and cooked perfectly.

Something weird happened with my quarter pounder with cheese box.  The ink from the bottom of the box came off all over the table.  I&#39;m not sure if this is a defect with the box, or a property of the new table making the ink come off.  Regardless, there was quite a bit of black ink on the table when I finished my sandwich.  Weird.

There is still a playplace at this location, but it has been significantly downsized from what was in the old store.  Since I did not have any kids with me, I can&#39;t give you a review of that.

So all in all, I would say the food was ok, the service was good, but the odd things happening with the napkins in the lobby and the filthy doors were a big detractor.",05/06/14,375,2,1,-1,-64,-1.7207999999999994,1.8290000000000002,3.748,30.422000000000008,No,3717

I can only say this of a few places, but I genuinely have nothing but good to say about Rainbow Restaurant and Pancake House. It&#39;s pretty nondescript from the outside, which is a big part of why I&#39;d never gone before, but after that awesome experience that I had today, I will surely be back.

Most importantly, I came alone with my two very young sons (2 and 19 months), and they could not have been more gracious and accommodating. Our waitress particularly went out of her way to make the meal as enjoyable as possible. The kids weren&#39;t misbehaving, just squirrely and wanting to grab most everything on the table. Even when a muffin ended up on the floor and some orange juice was spilled, she happily came to our table and helped. The icing on the cake was when one of them dropped his sippy cup on the floor and she picked it up for us and rinsed it off for him. 

On top of all of that, the food was great. Very generous (and inexpensive) serving sizes, and it comes out hot and quickly. I highly, highly recommend this place.",23/05/15,120,5,1,5,4,4.435599999999999,2.189,0.21100000000000002,8.600000000000001,No,1153

I usually stick to the breakfast side of the menu, and my favorites are the omelettes and pancakes. The omelettes are pretty big (4 eggs) and baked which makes them a little different. I most recently got the meat lovers omelette with feta, hash browns, and pancakes, which was super filling and a real value. The pancakes are the best and I wouldn&#39;t go here without getting them. If you order a meal and you have the option of toast or pancakes, get the pancakes every time. I haven&#39;t had them, but the crepes always look great. Outside of breakfast foods, I know the fries are pretty good (batter-dipped, so lots of crunch).

They can certainly get busy on the weekends, but get there early and you&#39;re fine. Or, just go around noon when it settles down a bit.

I had been to several diners while traveling recently, so now I appreciate how much better the service is here. The last few times we&#39;ve had Ashley as our server, and she&#39;s been the best.

She ended up eating the rest of the sample AND the soup I got with my sandwich.  It was vegetable with cabbage - yes, it was THAT good!!!  (note she&#39;s 11)  I&#39;m now kicking myself for not getting a quart to go.

She got the choc chip waffles, they were hot, and malty, and had two kinds of chips (milk and semi-sweet).

The servers are very friendly and work very hard to provide a good experience for diners, and they succeed. The atmosphere is very nice for a Sunday morning breakfast out. And the food is very good, too.

I had one quibble, but for me it is an important one. The hash browns were bitter. They were not burned, so it&#39;s probably not from overcooking, but they were bitter. I love hash browns - they are the part of breakfast I look forward to the most. The eggs I had were good, the bacon very good, the orange juice outstanding, the muffins delicious and a nice extra touch. But the hash browns, the main part of the meal, were just off.

  I had the baked sausage and cheese omelette. It was good, not an over abundance of cheese, which i liked. My husband had ham off the bone and two eggs over medium. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the ham a bit dry.  But fine. His only complaint was he said the coffee was horrid, so he ordered a diet coke. And the pancakes are very thick.

A little bit of humor for me. We used to go to a restaurant on Randall that had the most divine homemade corned beef hash on the planet. After several months, they switched to canned hash, miserable. When we asked our server why, she told us it was because so many people complained about the fresh hash and requested the canned variety. So today, I asked the server if the hash was fresh. And she said it used to be, but they they switched to canned because so many people complained about the fresh hash and requested the canned variety. It was the same server from the restaurant on Randall!!

Turkey club - So dry it literally hurt to swallow.
Cream of chicken rice soup - Had to load up the pepper and salt to make it edible. SO bland

Rueben - The person who ordered it said &#34;it&#39;s really not good. I&#39;ve had better in run down bars&#34;
Coleslaw - Not fresh and I have to wonder if the small bit I ate will cause illness....

I split the jumbo beer battered shrimp with my mom -- also shared a baked potato, bread roll, and then I took the spicy beans, and she took the coleslaw. 

First off, the shrimp are a front runner for the best shrimp I&#39;ve ever eaten. The batter was golden, delicious, and not overpowering; and the shrimp itself was so flavorful and definitely jumbo. I LOVE their house made spicy beans. There&#39;s actually bits of jalapeos and maybe a tiny bit of pork in it (don&#39;t quote me on the pork though). All I know is they&#39;re the only beans on this earth that I enjoy. Baked potatoes are always hot and fresh; can&#39;t comment on the slaw because I don&#39;t eat it.

My wife is actually the rib fan in our house, so when she suggested we give this place a try, I was more than happy to oblige her. I&#39;m thankful that I did too, because this place has great ribs!

We&#39;ve had ribs in a few other local spots, but these are the best. The sauces were on point, especially the hot sauce and the spicy sauce (actually I had a hard time telling them apart, because I just kept alternating between).

The ribs were fall-off-the-bone, which some rib connoisseurs will scoff at, but the meat was still in that sweet spot between firm and fall-apart-in-your-fingers.

The service was friendly and patient, as the huge menu gave us a lot of options. The kids split some of the chicken, which was tender and moist. And lastly the curly fries were seasoned to perfection and a must have side item!

I like the super casual atmosphere and the saloon inspired ambience. You place your order and seat yourself, and you&#39;re able to help yourself to beverages and sauces.

They have a pretty big menu. They don&#39;t have any beers on draft, only bottled. You order and pay up front, and then they bring out your food and check up on you throughout your visit. Everyone who works there is very nice. 

I have to say, I wasn&#39;t really impressed with their food, especially for the prices. For what it is, I think it is overpriced, I had the brisket sandwich and I didn&#39;t think it had good flavor, and the texture was almost mealy. It wasn&#39;t thick chunks of meat, maybe too shredded? The salad bar really isn&#39;t much, we didn&#39;t even partake in that. What&#39;s nice is they don&#39;t put too much sauce on the meat, but they have 3 different sauces to choose from so you can add more. The steak fries and coleslaw were very good.

I have to say though that once our food arrived, we both completely changed our tune. I ordered the BBQ Ham Sandwich for $6.99 and was shocked when it came because it was just so thick!

I have also tried burgers at this location but the chili is enough to make a visit. They also specialize in Texas BBQ - that is brisket not pork as their best meal.

The decor is like an Old West Saloon and it is fun for kids. For children you will have a challenge on the menu. They know how to make their chili spicy so it is great for an adult but my son is not a big fan of their food.

Standard sides are beans, slaw, and a choice of potato.  Food is available on plates, with one, two, or three meats, or as sandwiches.

Meats are cooked in house on a hickory fire.

The chicken fried steak was  a large serving, two pieces, with gravy and biscuits and the aforementioned sides.

texan-bbq-algonquin,Eric E.,VkH1Fm9Vn4ohQTT0CC9QFA,quYvU561aBq99-UwhUj5rw,"Great BBQ Sauce, and good food - very hard to rate.

I&#39;ve lived in the Algonquin area for 25 years, and have always loved Texan BBQ. Hands down, one of my favorite BBQ sauces in the area!!! You can buy it by the bottle as well, which I recommend for home use. I found out, too, that the bottles tend to be spicier / hotter than the sauce in the restaurant, which they make on site!

This visit was special, as I now live in Des Plaines, quite a drive, and was looking forward to some good BBQ to take with me. The order process is basic - stand and order, then wait for your food (or sit down if you&#39;re dining in), and it can get crowded in there - though at 4:30 this day, it was fun to chat with others waiting and the order taker. Very friendly place!

I ordered the Hickory Hog, which is 1/2 pound of BBQ Pork served open faced on a bun with two sides. I got the Cole Slaw and Potato Salad. The pork had some sauce in with it, but the rest on the side since my order was carry out. Serving size seemed OK, probably the 1/2 pound shown, but seemed less exciting than in the past because it wasn&#39;t slathered with it like when you dine in. ;-) The cole slaw and potato salad were excellent, though the serving size was tiny! Especially the potato salad, with nice, large chunks of potato and other goodies, crammed into a tiny condiment sized cup. Flavor - excellent. Size - embarrassing.

They offer a fun, if limited selection of fountain drinks, with Green River and Sprecher&#39;s Root Beer, along with a couple other Coke products. I didn&#39;t try them, but the bin of beer on ice is pretty good, too.

Though they are the same owners, and the flavors are still good, it seems less than I remember from years past. I&#39;d recommend the pork, brisket or ribs, as other items are closer to &#39;regular&#39; from past experience. The fries can be excellent, and beans very good, so recommend them for sides. The place has character, and is moderately clean considering the messiness of the food. Up the sizes of the sides (they can&#39;t cost that much) and you&#39;ll probably have a lot more happy customers.",28/05/14,266,4,3,5,87,10.920399999999999,5.744000000000001,0.9049999999999999,16.351,No,2128

 with the addition of thinly sliced prime rib, very good. The ribs were in no way memorable, average, but they will satisfy the rib craving. The pulled pork, pretty much the same as the ribs. The potato salad and cole slaw were both very good.

You should be able to grab a hunk of BBQ meat and eat it without sauce and it be amazing. That&#39;s the sign of someone who knows how to smoke meat. This place doesn&#39;t know that.

I ordered the tacos with chopped pork and they were almost inedible. I&#39;ve never had BBQ pork that was this dry. Once I added the sauce it made it at least to where I wouldn&#39;t throw it in the trash and completely waste my money. My wife had the turkey sandwich that came with way to much sauce on it. My guess is they know the sauce is good and the meat isn&#39;t so they serve it this way.

I only gave this 1 star because the sauce is that good.

This another one of those places that looks and feels like a southern BBQ spot.  You order when you walk in and then find your own seat.  But that&#39;s where the similarity ends.  The meat tastes and looked like someone went to a grocery store deli counter and asked them to shave a bunch of the rectangular my shaped, reformed blocks of animal meat products.  The meat does not feel, look, or taste like it is &#34;off the bone&#34;.   The &#34;rolls&#34; are just hamburger buns, nothing special.  They do have curly fries! So that&#39;s a plus.  All said and done, it&#39;s overpriced, the meat was edible, but we will not be back.

texan-bbq-algonquin,R. T.,wadX-MhH4IgumFi_XavEjw,sFgG1mUlGbm02Q3b1I4Sdw,"The Texan is a family-owned restaurant with a long-standing reputation for quality food at very reasonable prices. After a long absence, I was able to stop in for dinner last week, and was VERY glad I did. 

For folks who can&#39;t decide between the many delicious selections on their menu, my suggestion is to try the 3-meat combo dinner. Beef, pork &amp; chicken are all staples of any BBQ lover&#39;s diet, so the generous helpings on this combo platter, slathered in homemade BBQ sauce (mild, spicy or HOT) will surely represent the high standards that have kept customers coming back for well over 3 decades now.

As far as side dishes are concerned, the beans &amp; the coleslaw are both made fresh on the premises, and the curly fries are excellent as well. There&#39;s also a modest salad bar available for those who are so inclined to have some raw veggies with their meal. 

A full-service bar is offered for folks who enjoy a libation to go with their lunch or dinner, as well as freshly brewed iced tea, but my personal beverage favorite is the venerable Green River soda, which is on tap, alongside all the &#34;usual suspects&#34; of cola, root beer, etc.

The Texan is west of the beautiful Fox River, located just north of Algonquin Rd. on the east side of rt. 31, and the free parking lot is behind the building.

Why 2 Stars? 3 reasons (for which some may think I&#39;m a cheap, gluttonous, jerk but I can assure you that is not the case):

1. The price.  If I&#39;m paying $7 - $8 for a sandwich I would hope it comes with at least fries or coleslaw as a side.  Nope.  Sides are all a la carte unless you order a dinner plate.  The sandwiches we had were all very good though - though nothing you couldn&#39;t easily eat in one sitting.  As a comparison I normally only eat half of a big burger ordered at other restaurants such as The Ram or Elgin Public House.  Here I can eat the whole pulled pork sandwich just fine.

2. Okay, so we&#39;ve established you will have to order your side(s) separately if you don&#39;t order a dinner plate.  Depending on what kind of side you get it will be hit or miss as far as how much of the side item you get.  Fries?  Probably one of the few sides I&#39;ve seen where I feel they give you a decent amount.  Baked beans?  Small cup.  Ditto on the coleslaw.  Fried okra?  A handful and you paid over $3 for &#39;em.

3. I would not take a whole lot of issue with #1 or #2 above since they are just a small local restaurant and would like to make some sort of profit.  However, it&#39;s also the type of place you order at the counter, then go sit down &amp; they bring you the food - no table service.  You want more sauce?  Go up to the condiment station and get some.  You want a refill on your beverage?  Same.  I would hope for the price I am paying they would at least have table service and I will gladly, generously tip our server.  

I don&#39;t mind eating at places without table service but establishments like that I frequent have either lower prices, much larger portions or come with a side.

I pretty much always ordered the pulled pork or brisket, which made it my favorite in the area. Their sauces are fantastic,love the baked beans, and the potato salad is pretty good too.

Well now let me tell you...after coming here for years I finally tried their ribs.  And oh...my...god are they good.  Their ribs are honest to god the best ribs I have ever had anywhere...and yes, I&#39;m even including my home state of Texas in that!

And should I add it was a rainy night too? Well, 4 of us made it there and we had the back of the place much to ourselves. Texan is a divey looking palce inside. There is this saloon feel to the whole joint, right down to the dilapidated pickup truck I parked across from.

Inside, there&#39;s a foyer area with an order counter. You place your order right there and then have a seat. I wanted to try a multitude of things, so I went with a Meat Lover&#39;s Platter along with a small sample side of their chili.

In maybe 10-15 minutes, I had a small bowl of chili and a formidable array of pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs, sausage and sliced turkey breast in front of me. Thick steak fries adorned the plate too. I probably had 3 meals&#39; worth right there.

I dug in, doing my best to sample each. First the chili. It&#39;s very meaty, more like a pulled beef chili with generous clusters of shredded meat - not finely ground taco meat or something wiempy from your typical diner. From the meat assortment, my favorite was probably the beef brisket. Sausage was great too and the ribs were tender. Sliced turkey - not so much. It looked like deli meat turkey slathered in BBQ sauce, somewhat out of place with the other meats proudly on display beside it.

Service was pretty good. You can fill your own drink at a fountain dispenser, which makes it convenient. 

There is a Western theme throughout the place. We sat across from a full-sized horse saddle mounted on a ledge opposite our table. There&#39;s also a mural of a desert and cactus plants in an adjacent room.

In all, a good dining experience and plenty of leftovers despite being too full for dessert. Good prices too.

I&#39;ve lived in the area for 11 years which is when I first tried this place. Then, I experienced cold, bland overpriced food, BBQ beef to be exact. Well 11 years later I tried again tonight with my kids (out of connivence) and nothing changed. Since I just ate there I&#39;ll elaborate.

I ordered a BBQ beef with bacon, cheddar, grilled onions, tomato and a side of hush puppies.

The beef was very, very dry and tasteless. The bacon was cold and hard without any flavor for the exception of a medicine taste. The cheese was this obviously bagged shredded cheddar which they hardly put any on and it wasn&#39;t even melted, just thrown, dry on and falling to sides. The bread was dry, old and just broke apart. I needed their lousy Open Pit textured sauce to give some taste. The hush puppies were crisp like and over cooked. You would thing for being a BBQ place their meats would be right on.

Their preorder service is a horrid setup with one slow register. If you want a second drink you have to walk up and wait in line and it was semi-busy at 7pm on a Friday night when it should be packed. My kids had kid meals, one being ribs which looked really fatty. The other had a hotdog which probably was okay but they&#39;re hard to screw up.

Most definitely better off going to Texas Road House right down from there on 31. I&#39;m all for supporting independent businesses but Texan BBQ is not worth it.

This place is known for their DINOSAUR SIZED BBQ beef ribs. When you receive your 1/2 or full size plate of these enormous meat lollipops your eyes and your mouth might just drop. The meat is very tender and is it served with their house/original BBQ sauce. Spicy BBQ is also available for you to satisfy your taste buds. All dinners include a choice of potato (baked, seasoned curly fries, steak fries, or potato salad). There&#39;s more! You also get mayonnaise based coleslaw, Texas toast, and sweet pickles. It&#39;s a lot of food, but you&#39;ll get a food coma afterwards. They also have funnel cake with a choice of strawberries or chocolate or my favorite - plain powder sugar.

However, whenever the subject of BBQ come up, the experience my husband and I had here always gets brought back up.  Maybe things have changed for the better since we went.  But,  I can only speak for our one and only attempt.  We went to this place excited at the possibility of having a good BBQ place close  by.  Unfortunately, our excitement proved to be short lived.  The experience we had was very disappointing.  
We did take-out of a few items excited to see which one(s) would emerge as the favorites.  
Ribs-No taste.  Tough and mushy at the same time???
Pulled pork-only a hint of smokiness.  Otherwise, no taste and stringy.
Brisket-Did not like the meat cut up.  Was grainy.
Brunswick stew-Absolutely awful.  The visual aesthetic was not appealing.  It was an unappetizing greyish color with all the chunks and bits...you get what I mean.  The smell was not far behind.  It did not smell fresh/new.  It smelled like it was starting to get old; having a little of that decaying meat smell.  This was only item I could not bring myself to actually try.  The look and smell had me on system shut down.  
Fries-generic fries that could be found in any school cafeteria.  Could take or leave them.

The food is likely the best Texan BBQ style food you&#39;re gonna get anywhere in the country outside of Texas.  I&#39;m sure most Texans will suggest theirs is better, but I doubt it.  I&#39;ve eaten many of BBQ in Texas and this place is right up there.

The atmosphere is fun and has a great Texan flare.  you have a great smoke smell in the air along with a nice wood from the walls and floor.

Their portion size has shrunk in the last 5 years.  This bothers me and has stopped my from ordering lunch there or bringing guests.

I dislike their ordering procedure.  It&#39;s very bizzare.  You stand in line like the pigs and cows they serve to place your order.  You pay and go and sit.  A waitress brings your meal at which time you&#39;re halve done your beverage.  Since the meal is paid already, they miss out on additional beverage sales, but more than that, they miss out on the customer and embark in a large opportunity cost, the customer is under served and their margins are likely hurt.  Anyone I&#39;ve spoke to, and I live in Algonquin, dislikes this process.  It is really bizzare to me that the management still opts for this poor level of service.

texan-bbq-algonquin,Ryan H.,8_KZjp0X5BLyMH3_Cuiezw,ecKj3iZJ9rAFYwLBoV9sgg,"I&#39;ve dined at The Texan off and on for the better part of 20 years.  The place and the food have never changed.  As others have described, the exterior of the facility is a bit dumpy, but don&#39;t let that scare you.  The moment you open your car door, you smell the meat smoking in the barn out back.  

I spend a great deal of time in Texas, so my opinion may be biased.  Texans know BBQ.  The BBQ at The Texan, while technically competent, would not make the grade at all when compared to real Texas BBQ.  The meat tends to be dry which is then compensated for by thinly slicing the meat and slathering it in their house BBQ sauce.  The product you end up with is reasonably tasty.  In Texas, the meat is usually sliced thicker which gives you a meatier mouthful.  

The other issue I have with the Texan is portion size.  At a Texas BBQ place, you usually get substantial portions that are usually overwhelming.  At The Texan, not so much.  In fact, I&#39;ve noticed portion size decrease over the years so much so that I find myself ordering larger, more expensive entrees to compensate.  

The house BBQ sauce is a bit bland.  Out in the foyer area, they offer three other BBQ sauces.  The &#34;Hot&#34; variety is pretty tasty and tangy, with just the right amount of heat to keep it interesting.  

All in all, not a bad place and I will keep going back from time to time.  I do wish they would up their game a little bit by improving their cooking process to render moister cuts of meat and also increase their average portion size.  If they followed both of those suggestions, I would easily give them a grade of 4-stars.  The 5th star I reserve for the real Texas BBQ joints.",27/06/09,197,3,2,4,43,3.9332,1.6179999999999999,0.276,19.105999999999998,No,1691

The bad: the burgers we ordered were not hot - they were barely warm (the manager redid them for us - they were slightly better). The Coca-Cola dispensed by their fountain tasted terrible - too watered down, not enough syrup.  I recall this being the case on prior visits - I think they&#39;re trying to be cheap and getting the most out of their bag-in-box syrup supply.

Speaking of cheap...  When placing our order, my wife had asked for a cup for water and didn&#39;t receive one - once we received our meal, she asked for a cup again and was told it would cost 43 cents!  (My wife said forget it, but I think the cashier, seeing my wife&#39;s disappointment, felt bad about the cost and gave her the cup anyway).  Talk about nickel and diming!  My wife thinks water should be free for those purchasing a full meal - she believes the restaurant may charge for the water cup to discourage loiterers.

Ordered egg rolls with dinner and we got these gigantic soggy rolls with one tiny cup of sweet and sour sauce and no hot mustard.  I called to inquire about no hot mustard.  I was told that hot mustard must be requested and is no longer automatically provided with an order of 2 egg rolls.  I always got a couple of sweet and sour sauces and a couple of hot mustards in the past.  The man I spoke with on the phone basically made me feel like I should have asked for it when we placed the order.  The entrees were not nearly as tasty as they were in the past.

It&#39;s not very imposing when you get there, in fact we never knew the restaurant was there. We live only a couple of miles from here and asked the server how long they&#39;d been in business. We learned they have been located there for six years. It&#39;s pretty easy to miss.

What set this apart from typical Mexican restaurants in the area was the prevalence of seafood on the menu. We started with an order of Guacamole. (Note, on the menu this is listed as &#34;market price&#34;.) There were three of us so we asked if the small or large would be good for us. He said the small was one avocado and the large was 1 1/2. We ordered the large and it was enormous. There had to be three or four Haas Avocados in it. But, it was outstanding. It had just the right balance of onion, garlic, jalapeno, lime, etc. Very, very fresh.

For dinner, my son and I each got &#34;PARRILLADA LEVANTA MUERTOS&#34;. This is sort of a fajita like dish with Shrimp, fish, calamari, oysters, red &amp; green and onions. It is all marinated in a spicy paste seasoning. It comes with rice and tortillas (choice of corn or wheat). This was absolutely great - delicious. When you order this, you can order it for one person through four people. It all comes on one plate.

The meal was enormous. In fact, I usually pride myself on finishing everything. This time, the food won. We finished all of the fish, but only about 1/2 of the tortillas and a little more than 1/2 of the guacamole.

One other thing, they offer a check in special on Yelp - buy one entree and get one for 1/2 price. This offer is also available on their website as a coupon. While they are not particularly expensive, every little bit helps.",21/07/13,208,5,2,5,25,5.7462,4.327999999999999,0.165,24.507,No,1752

Here goes:

** Open til 3am Tuesday through Sunday

** A darn good ceviche dish. For $8.50 you get a larger-than-cereal-bowl sized of all seafood in citrus zest topped with sliced and sliced avocado. It&#39;s served with Ritz crackers and Valentina brand extra hot sauce. 

** Camarones el Diablo was legit hot. My gums are still kind of tingly and that&#39;s how I like it. My The late is around $12 and you get 7 medium-large sized shrimp, rice, beans and tortillas. 

** Free chips and salsa.

** The vegetarian mix plate was just okay. Tostada was great, also included small, plain cheese quesadilla  and smallest burrito ever (pretty much 3/4 of an enchilada sized) that was just beans, rice... which the dish also had a side of. It was kind of beans, cheese and rice overload but with all the meat options here, I can&#39;t imagine that they have a huge call for veggies. 

** The service was pretty standard. Very neutral on the excitement level of having customers in the near-empty business, but there could have been a very slight language barrier. 

** I was expecting this place to be a counter order/take out type place from the outside, but it&#39;s actually a full service sit-down restaurant. 

** Inside is alarmingly barren of decorations. Just red walls and very basic chairs and standing tables. If I didn&#39;t know it was a Mexican restaurant, I&#39;d think it was a just a room used to store chairs and tables, although towards the ceiling you can see they have multiple strobe lights, speakers, projectors and screens and also an area in the corner that look like it might be able to house a dj - not sure though. Perhaps there&#39;s a party hour or something that I&#39;m not yet familiar with. 

** Horchata was pretty darn good... but when are they ever not might be the better question. 

** I really enjoyed the ceviche, but overall I wasn&#39;t &#39;wowed&#39; by anything else I had, probably in part to not eating meat (besides fish), which I think really makes or breaks most Mexican food experiences. If you aren&#39;t eating Mexican food with meat, you&#39;re probably eating something you could&#39;ve recreated at home. 

** They had one of the larger seafood menus I&#39;ve seen at a budget-friendly Mexican restaurant, and offered a variety of unique options. 

** Our bill was $35 (with a 50% off your second entree Yelp check-in deal) for two Horchatas, chips and salsa giant bowl of ceviche and two meals, of which we had leftovers.

** In the end, the lack of atmosphere took the dining experience down a notch, but I&#39;d go back and/or call in a carry out order if I were in the area. That ceviche would be a great item to bring to a party, especially since it&#39;s large enough to share with a family.**",21/04/13,360,3,2,5,30,5.495500000000001,2.9029999999999996,0.6160000000000001,22.48,No,2979

I live in the city in striking distance of a half-dozen good Mexican places. Based on the reviews here we went to Mi General.

What a disappointment. On a Sunday evening at 7 p.m. we were one of 2 parties in the place. Flourescent lights. Rickety tables. Recently-mopped floor filled the place with a distinct smell of bleach. TV on behind the absurdly large bar. 

Good: Fresh homemade chips. Tortillas arrived cooked (not steamed in a microwave).  Mom reports enormous frozen margarita was good. Amazingly, a couple other Mexican families came in for dinner while we were there. (normally a good sign.)

Mediocre: Everything else. This place isn&#39;t even trying. Carne asada (skirt steak) was large but chewy. The dish came with yellow rice and blender-ized pinto beans. Nothing special, and no lettuce, sour cream, dash of guac on the plate, something/anything to set it apart. I asked for some lettuce and tomato to add to my tacos and the sliced tomato was hard and pink, mealy and tasteless.  What kind of place would offer that to a paying guest? No one cares enough to choose good produce, apparently.  

The menu is huge and filled with typical dishes you can find in one hundred places. Tacos, burritos, chimichanga, steaks, etc.  

I was excited about trying the seafood that everyone here talked about, but when I asked, of course everything was frozen. Why would I pay a restaurant to microwave defrost some shrimp or tilapia or whatever, then cook it? Blech. So I went with the carne asada.

Dessert was flan. They inexplicably poured bottled chocolate sauce all over it then a small mountain of whipped cream.  On flan. Oy.",01/11/13,241,2,1,4,9,3.2655,2.919,1.182,27.899,No,1831

It&#39;s a small little restaurant by day, and BAM! at night it&#39;s a very lively and care-free karaoke bar. No drink specials here, and the price is moderate. It should be cheaper because it is so small, but the crowd is great. If you enjoy Spanish music, definitely go. Most of the songs sung at karaoke are spanish songs. There is a tiny space to dance, but people do dance, and nobody cares how you dance or if you are too drunk and look horrible dancing lol. Only thing is it&#39;s tiny, so if you don&#39;t like small spaces, it&#39;s not for you.

mi-general-hoffman-estates,Phil S.,asP08n8OwVhIg2hyff8DFQ,o0ATdc6Dah_cp79ABjENJw,"This place is my preferred standard Mexican fare joint to go to. Nothing fancy but they have a decent selection of standard Mexican dishes. I&#39;ve always been a firm believer of keeping things simple and sticking to what you&#39;re good at as a business and this place accomplishes that pretty well. Sure you can go to the cookie cutter corporate Mexican places such as La Magdalena or Chevy&#39;s in the same area but I hate chain restaurants for their unauthentic flavor as much as their cheesy presentation of everything from garnish to decor. Besides, supporting the small business owner as much as possible is beneficial to the entire community. So back to the review on the actual food at Me General. They seem to specialize more in seafood and do a decent job of it. Prices are reasonable for serving size as well as quality. The standard taco and burrito dishes are fresh and tasty. Nothing fancy which is just the way I like it when I&#39;m craving a quick Mexican meal. They serve alcohol and have common Mexican beers such as Corona, Dos Equis, Modelo and the like. The margarita comes in your standard large glass and is nothing special but good all the same. Their taco dinner is huge. At just under $9 you get four tacos, a heap of beans and a pile of rice. A challenge to finish even if you have a healthy appetite. The condiments on the taco can be tailored to your liking but will arrive standard with a little twist of the traditional to tailor to more American tastes. The salsa is made in house and the tortilla chips are fresh. Once again, there&#39;s nothing really fancy about the joint but it is a great local place if you live in the area and are looking for a place that is great for a quick bite to eat. My vote is 3.5 stars but I&#39;ll gladly round up to 4.",19/08/11,186,4,3,5,78,4.3585,2.8000000000000003,0.351,15.848999999999998,No,1788

Toscana seems like a true Italian family owned restaurant with some homemade authentic cooking. The food has a homey taste while the service and experience has a quality restaurant feel. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and dishes, which truly says something great about management.

We shared a bottle of the Cabernet, an excellent choice! (The house red wine was too sweet for my taste) This and the complimentary bread were a delicious start to the meal. We also started with a shrimp appetizer- absolutely delicious! My dad last minute saw this on the menu and threw it in our order, and thank goodness he did! The garlicky sauce is heavenly, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. 

I had the salmon salad as my entree and also shared a bit of the scallop pasta (special of the night) and linguine with clams. All dishes were superb and tasty. The scallop pasta was probably my favorite, and the noodles are perfectly al dente. 

After this excellent meal, we couldn&#39;t resist trying some of their dessert options. We had the carrot cake and pistachio gelato. The gelato was delicious and creamy, and the carrot cake wasn&#39;t bad. 

This great dinner experience will have me forever bragging and bringing my family on special occasions- we love Italian food and have finally found our favorite authentic spot in the suburbs!",21/10/16,157,5,2,5,43,9.3801,4.547999999999999,0.0,12.451999999999996,No,1426

There was a group of 5 of us for lunch. Plenty of room. I had the shrimp and asparagus risotto. Cooked excellent, though a bit heavy handed with salt. Could be the broth.  Anyway, it was super tastey.  I also had the side of broccolli with garlic, olive oil and pine nuts.  Wow, was that every good.  Minnestroni was pretty good as well. Lots of veggies and more brothy (thin) than soupy. Very good.

I liked the two different kinds of breads for the table, g, italian bread and some kinda tomato focasia. The fresh fish halibut special was excellent as well.  And less than $20.  That hit the spot.

Let&#39;s just order in. Family indecisive, one starts to improvise a reality TV-style pilot, channeling the Snickers commercial, &#34;You aren&#39;t yourself when you&#39;re hungry,&#34; and being whiny, instead of his fun self; everyone else started to slowly join in. &#34;Wait, this isn&#39;t an improvisation, it&#39;s really happening,&#34; I thought! Someone had to take charge; so it was I. Mom suggests Toscana. There&#39;s a reason that moms are the best. With my pencil and Toscana&#39;s website, I quickly got consensus before the blood sugar got too low.  

Start with a couple Cesar salads? Check. Five pastas, family-style? Check. Mom always gets the Tortellini Paesano; pesto is to my tongue as is music to my ears; you can never go wrong with too much garlic, hence aglio &amp; olio; we mix it up with the Gnocchi Romano, and we&#39;d better get at least one thing that&#39;s healthy, so we round it out with the Heart Healthy. Let&#39;s also invest in a tiramisu and a cannoli to ensure that the meal ends with a sweet taste in our mouths.

I called Toscana. The woman who answered was very friendly, and fine with me figuring out salad dressings, when it turned out that a side salad came with each pasta. It will be ready in 20 minutes. I was there in 20, but... Wow, a desolate, half-occupied strip-mall. Not too promising! I was starting to worry about Mom&#39;s faculties...  But the woman who took my order was there, the food was ready, my card was run; I grabbed the two shopping bags by the handles, ran to the car, squealed out of the desolate parking lot, and was home in 5. Hungry family was happily ready. Food runner/Yelper gives 5 stars to the take-out service.

The food was good, basic Italian fare. Nothing notable, but nothing bad. Mom was right about the Tortellini Paesano. Nothing wrong with a stuffed-pasta with a sauce &amp; vittles reminiscent of carbonara. The pesto and Heart Healthy were also tasty, and it would have been hard to screw up the aglio &amp; olio (though I&#39;ve seen it done). I was of two &#34;minds&#34; regarding the gnocchi (those things have always looked like little brains to me anyway). The gnocchi themselves were the perfect consistency, with the right &#34;chew.&#34; But the tomato sauce on them seemed a little thin--they really could have used a heartier sauce (I was thinking pesto, as I chewed my fettucine that was coated in it.) Dad had been worried that we wouldn&#39;t have bread, but that came with it too.

Mom was spot on in her suggestion. The whole family perked up after lunch and went on to play a rousing board game, had fun, and went on with our lives. 

I love Snickers, but if you don&#39;t have one in the house, Toscana is a good alternative to keep the moods elevated.",24/05/15,345,4,2,5,17,8.6843,4.11,0.9710000000000001,26.918999999999997,No,2853

I came here because of the good reviews, but unfortunately we didn&#39;t experience much good! When I first walked in, I said I needed a table for two. Both the hostess and another man (I&#39;m guessing the owner/manager of sorts) rudely told me that I could either sit at the bar or leave. Hmmm...thanks I guess? 

Since I had already made plans to meet someone here, I stayed at the bar. The bartender was nice, but no matter where you go, the food service is never as good at the bar, because the bartender is too busy being a bartender. I felt rushed to make a food decision (the menu is pretty short and simple...not very creative or different). I ended up getting a glass of the house chardonnay (not that great), and the pasta with shrimp and white wine sauce. The pasta was hard, there wasn&#39;t much sauce, it was very garlicy, and the shrimp seemed overcooked. My friend said her pasta was hard as well. The salad was plain, but my friend said her soup was good. We were given bread which was decent, and you can make your own olive oil/cheese dipping sauce. Overall I ended spending $30 for a dinner that was not worth $30 at all.

The atmosphere is cute, but this place is tiny and gets so busy. Before we left we had hoards of people standing behind us at the bar waiting for us to leave. We basically felt pressured to leave and it was not a good atmosphere to stay and have conversation (it was very loud...especially with people right behind you loudly talking). We had to ask for a box and our check since we had pretty much been forgotten about. Not a great experience at all.

toscana-restaurant-and-lounge-arlington-heights,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,1MLbODeWSeI6-LZ1TmyghQ,"With so many great Italian restaurants around the Chicagoland area, I&#39;m sure the only thing holding back Toscana from being recognized as one of the greatest is the size and decor. It&#39;s hidden from main streets in a strip mall in Arlington Heights. From the outside it doesn&#39;t really seem impressive and the dark interior fails to tell you much about the restaurant either. The only clue that you might be in for something special is the packed dining room at dinner.

One place Toscana really shines is the food. They feature many reasonably priced daily specials and freshly prepared items. From the start, you&#39;ll enjoy bread that is baked several times a day, out directly from the oven. After that you have a choice of soup or salad, both of which are prepared to perfection. Then you will get to the star of the meal, the main entree. Unlike many Italian restaurants that have very similar dishes only different by sauce and pasta type, Toscana really puts in effort to make sure each dish tastes unique.

Some of my favorites include:

Sea bass with lemon and capers - Crispy seared fish with a delicately flaky inside. It&#39;s probably the next best thing to sushi if you don&#39;t enjoy your fish raw. Definitely a dish fish lovers should try.

Mozzarella Caprese - A simple appetizer but the mix of cheese, tomatoes, basil, and balsamic vinegar are perfect in this dish.

Calamari salad - The calamari is cooked slightly more raw here so that the softness comes out while still presenting a great flavor. I&#39;m not even a big salad person but this was executed so perfectly I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.

Lobster and crabmeat ravioli - Luxurious in a creamy sauce, get this whenever it&#39;s on the specials menu. It has a generous amount of seafood in a perfectly thin ravioli skin.

Tortellini Paesano - One of the homemade pastas with a strong but not overpowering alfredo sauce perfectly counter balanced with mushroom and peas.

Gnocchi - A guilty pleasure of many people, these chewy potato dumplings are also prepared very well here.

Fried calamari linguini - They don&#39;t always have this but it&#39;s fried perfectly with generous amounts of calamari and will easily convert people used to fried shrimp.

Linguini shrimp diavolo - It&#39;s not super spicy but just spicy enough to be enjoyable with perfectly cooked, tasty shrimp.

Linguini broccoli and shrimp - Don&#39;t underestimate this dish because it has broccoli in it. One of the best parts of the dish is the tender broccoli perfectly sauteed in garlic and olive oil. The shrimp matches perfectly with almost an equally heavy flavor and texture.

toscana-restaurant-and-lounge-arlington-heights,Lauren A.,d_MqmhkrrR80Eub5h3gTWA,nnb-kyU63uwEK5FOJzd1tQ,"I was here with a fairly large party for dinner on a Sunday night.  The bread, wine and food were all pretty good.  I had the chicken cacciatore - two chicken breasts with onions, tomatoes, peppers, and mushrooms on top and a side of pasta.  I ate pretty much every bite of food on the plate.  The portion was a little small compared to what you usually get at an Italian restaurant, but that was fine because the entree came with salad and bread and I was pleasantly full when I left - not ready to collapse or vomit due to overeating.  I also had the gelato for dessert (chocolate and vanilla) which was really good.  

The issue I have with this place is the service.  I was going to include our server&#39;s name in this review, but I decided not to because I don&#39;t want to be that big a of a jerk.  First off, she rather nastily carded me (I am 32) when I ordered a glass of wine which would have been fine except for the fact that she did NOT card my 24 year old male cousin when he ordered hard liquor.  I can only assume by the way she was smiling and laughing at him all night that she thought he was attractive or something.  Also, it really bothers me when servers ask you to pass them dishes or pass someone else their dishes.  This waitress was constantly making me and others at my table do her job.  Sorry, we are paying to have you bring food out and put it on the table, not to hand it to me just to make me serve the person two places down because you are too lazy.  Lastly, I was in the middle of my meal when the waitress and busboys kept coming over and asking for us to pass them dishes others were done with.  I was trying to eat... could that not have waited?  I felt like I worked there or something.  It was bizarre.  

I would come back here and just hope I got a different waitress.  It does seem unfair to judge the restaurant based on one not so good server.  Again, the food was pretty good and very reasonably priced.  Just be ready to work for it when you get there.",22/09/14,210,3,2,3,20,2.974500000000001,3.0010000000000003,1.445,16.554,No,2003

toscana-restaurant-and-lounge-arlington-heights,Dodd V.,u7TnpDoh885w9_AULZKlMA,YCPtg5yC_WKCOQRb9Wgscw,"Good news and bad news.  I am happy to see that someone at Toscana cares enough to read customer reviews and even respond.  Unfortunately they don&#39;t seem to care much about good customer service and rather than provide a simple &#34;I am sorry for your bad experience&#34; which would have gone a long way, I get the following excuses and insult instead:

&#34;For your review of: Toscana Restaurant &amp; Lounge
From Toscana Management. 
We took a little time to reply to you. First of all thank you for trying us. We have been in the business for 25 years, 6 years in this location and we will continue to provide top quality service and reasonable prices. Regarding to the calamari dish, it is one of the most favorite appetizers at our restaurant. We sell over 300 pounds a week. Our soups are daily made with fresh ingredients and our salads are nice blends of iceberg lettuce, green leaves, spring mix and more. We can go on but looks like you will not understand the quality of our food. We are going to continue to serve the best and the freshest Italian-American cuisine to the people who know how to appreciate and understand good quality.&#34;


Now, while my review was obviously much less than positive, I wanted to make sure I was not out of line so I took a few minutes to read other reviews here on Yelp as well as on Trip Advisor, Urban Spoon and Google.  Focusing on reviews within the last 12 months, it seems to be a mixed bag of very positive reviews intermixed with others like mine that were also pretty poor.  From this and some of the comments made, it seems possible that Toscana has an issue with consistency.  With that said though, from the negative reviews, here are some of the comments that fit my experience and the review I wrote:

&#34;Tough calamari&#34;, seems as if it were microwaved
Calamari was &#34;not great&#34;
Salad was &#34;nothing special&#34;
Food tasted like it was &#34;frozen&#34;
Food tasted like it came (from a can)
Pasta was clumped together
Tomato sauce tasted as if it were &#34;out of a jar&#34;
Food seemed to have been &#34;frozen&#34; and &#34;store bought&#34;
Fish was dry
Soup was flavorless and made with canned broth
&#34;Not professionally run&#34;  

The last one rings true considering the lovely message that Toscana Management sent me above.  

Let me tell you folks at Toscana something, I generally give any place a second shot, and certainly if the experience improved I would update my review accordingly.  However, when I get a message from the management that is so rude and ignores any sort of customer service whatsoever and simply makes excuses and tells me, the customer I lack the ability to understand the  &#34;quality&#34; of their food, I forget the second shot and simply go elsewhere. 

 I think I am sophisticated enough to know when food is cold in the middle rather than hot.  I think I know limp lettuce when I get it and I most certainly know when pasta is dry and when calamari is tough, chewy and flavorless.  It doesn&#39;t matter to me how much Toscana sells.  Perhaps if they focused less on selling 300 pounds a week and focused more on quality, I and the others who have written bad reviews would be happy and returning customers.  

For those interested, if you want a much better Italian experience in the relatively nearby area (all just off of Central) try the following:

Joe &amp; Guiseppe - (Central and Arthur in Arlington Heights)
Giacomo&#39;s - (Central and Wolf in Des Plaines)
Caf Lucci - (Central and Milwaukee in Glenview)

From my experiences, all three of these are far superior to Toscana and I highly doubt any of them would be so insulting to a customer who had a bad experience.

Sorry Toscana, I guess my unsophisticated pallet simply doesn&#39;t understand your high quality.  I am sure though that these other are happy to take my business.",25/05/14,418,1,1,5,-23,6.357299999999999,3.678000000000001,1.625,18.697000000000003,No,3871

This place was close to the house with outside seating.  I had been there before and it was fine, but not my first choice when I think of good Italian.  However, I did not expect to experience the humiliation and discrimination that was shown to me.  My fianc ordered a beer and glass of wine for me.  20 minutes later our server said she was delaying drinks because she wasn&#39;t sure she could serve to us.  I looked at her confused and asked if she was 21 or new, maybe she couldn&#39;t serve?  When she answered yes she&#39;s 21 and laughed, I then thought okay maybe she needs my ID? I was completely clueless when she fired back &#34;your pregnant.&#34;  I was shocked and stared at her rather than get up and walk out.  My fianc was also stunned and the couple seated nearby asked if we were on candid camera or that show &#34;what would you do,&#34; lol.  So we laughed it off and I didn&#39;t want to make a scene, however I was completely embarrassed and felt much discrimination obviously against my body.

I placed a reservation for Toscana on yelp reviews alone--had never heard of the place, but the reviews seemed great and one look-thru the menu online I was sold.  Italian is probably my favorite cuisine and there are plenty of Italian joints around, but this establishment is really fantastic and better than any chain.  Don&#39;t let a strip mall place fool you--it was PACKED and everybody just has the most pleasant look on their face.

The room is very noisy, but don&#39;t let that bother you--the wait staff is amazing and are there to make sure your dining experience is wonderful.  We visited this restaurant on Friday night for my Mom&#39;s birthday and everyone was pleased with their food.  Everything from the flavored olive oil, to the bread, to the salads, to the entrees, and to the dessert --was excellent.  Portions are a good size, not too big, not too small and definitely worth the price.  $15 for Veal--yes please!!!  And my huge glass of House Riesling for $6 wasn&#39;t too shabby either :)

There was never a moment where we weren&#39;t supplied with bread and our drinks were always properly attended to.

My wife and I discovered this place literally right behind our condo so it was an obvious choice as our go-to spot for good quick Italian food. The Carbonara with Cappellini noodles is amazing! It&#39;s the best Carbonara I&#39;ve had outside of my travels to Florence and Rome, Italy which says a lot. Their Tiramisu is consistently delicious as is their salads. Prices are extremely affordable too.

Mind you we have not actually dined-in yet because my experiences even with their to-go service has left me with mixed feelings so I would not expect their dine-in to be any better. After 6 carry-outs we either received the wrong order, the incorrect type of noodles requested, overcooked and inconsistent pasta, and a lack of competent phone and social skills from the various hosts who took our orders.  My guess is they must hire local high school kids to play host.

Overall my complaints are minor and even if we didn&#39;t live behind the restaurant I think we would still continue give them our business because their food is just that good.

We ordered some of the mussels in white sauce, which my wife and our friend seemed to really enjoy. We also had some antipasto, which was pretty good.

This italian sausage was not a traditional version my grandmother made but still was a version that I want more of.,22/06/14,59,4,1,3,10,2.952,1.6480000000000001,0.0,6.352,No,574

We really enjoyed our time there!  Very cute little place with a VERY attentive, friendly (and traditional Italian!) staff.

We sat at the bar while we waited for our outdoor table and our very lovely bartender (Gayla??) took very good care of us.

We were mixed on the decor.  My wife found the Italian Village scene painted on the wall a bit tacky.  I was okay with it - a bit cheesy but I kinda like that stuff but not everyone will.  

Pretty good wine selection, a very nice frog leg appetizer, decent pasta, VERY good seafood risotto (my wife said she never had risotto with that much seafood and easier on the rice) - they really don&#39;t skimp on that dish!  

We sat outside with mixed results.  Romantic yes (once you eventually tune out the fact that you&#39;re looking out onto a very lame parking lot).  However, in the summer, the bugs out there were VERY bad which definitely put a damper.  They lit torches but that did very little.

B/c it was a hot night, we got the wild berry Italian Ice and shared it (which was very refreshing).

My take on the service: slow, yes.  But in their defense, I honestly think they took a very traditional Italian approach to dinner (slow down, don&#39;t rush to your next course or your desert, etc).  I&#39;ve seen very traditional Italian places do this so I really didn&#39;t hold it against them.  

I&#39;d say prices were fairly reasonable: $116 including tip (minus $25 restaurant.com gift certificate) for very large frog leg app, two above average salads, pasta dish, generous seafood risotto, decent sized desert, a bottle or wine, then 2 extra wines by the glass.

Bottom line, very nice job, Toscana, we&#39;ll be back!",05/08/11,227,4,2,5,24,7.073100000000001,3.707,0.324,15.968999999999998,No,1779

We found this place from the yelp reviews as we often do when we are traveling. It&#39;s in an unassuming strip-mall almost un-noticeable except for the patio seating outside. There were a few lone diners, but mainly groups of families and friends. As busy as the small dining-room was, it looked like they did an equal amount of business with people calling for take-out.

The staff attends to each table in a manner found only at the Michelin four-star restaurants I&#39;ve visited. Not a single need goes un-met, before you even realize you had the need. They offer an extensive wine list for almost every palette. But this place is about the food. Oh, the food!!

We were treated with home-baked breads coupled with quality olive oil at the table. The appetizers were outstanding, but it is the entrees that really shine. I had one of their many specials not on the regular menu: Melt in your mouth briscole that exploded with flavor. &#34;Special&#34; is an understatement here to clue you in to what you MUST try. The sauce was one of those cooked-all-day melds of flavor that almost made me light-headed because it tasted soooooo good. I was instantly transported back in my mind to another off-the-beaten path restaurant I found in Venice. While I cannot say whether or not this place was Northern of Southern Italian cuisine, I can attest that it was FANTASTIC!!!

My husband had the manicotti made from fresh noodles and a distinctively different red sauce that most certainly was produced from a long slow simmer. Our teenage daughter chose eggplant parmigiana that for once made me reconsider her vegetarian choices as worthwhile.

My only regret for the meal was that as first-timers we ate way-too quickly. This is the kind of place that you bring your closest friends and family. It&#39;s the closest thing you can find to Italy without actually flying there. It is special and like all great meals is meant to be shared in the company of people you love because this is food made with love. Not only for special occasions, but this restaurant is all about the experience of what dining should be every day of the week!",21/06/12,240,5,1,5,4,4.4395,2.0109999999999997,0.49400000000000005,21.496000000000002,No,2284

We were greeted in a friendly manner and seated right away in one of the two last remaining tables open (this was on a Sunday at about 5pm).  We both thoroughly enjoyed what we got (Carbonara for my husband, Eggplant Parmigania for me).

My uncle, a fabulous cook, who has even been on TV for cooking, says this is one of their favorite &#39;I&#39;ve had too long of a day to pretend to cook like Rachel Ray&#39; restaurants. I can see why they love the restaurant after spending just one evening at Toscana. 

The staff at Toscana is sweet, neighborly and warm; I kind of felt like they were all giving me special attention when I walked in, but after watching for a while, that&#39;s just how they are - very refreshing - I haven&#39;t felt that in a while. The wine list is easy, drinkable and quick to the table (hell, yeah). The food is non-chain, family-recipe styled and delicious.

We went there 2 times both in large group. Most of us enjoyed the food over there. The service is also good even when they are crowded. 

I tried lamb shank and it is fantastic. I also love the fried calamari. They are very tender inside. Perfectly fried to me. 

They serve two kinds of breads and I enjoyed the pizza bread. 

We also ordered dessert to share, and they all are fairly good.  

I would recommend you give it a try.

I am not an exceptionally slow eater, but again the waitress was standing by our table while I finished my dinner.  I had to box it because it was so uncomfortable.

Roberto is the owner, really nice guy.  He has 2 other restaurants, one of which I have already been to.  It&#39;s in Geneva and it&#39;s called Altiro, and it&#39;s also really good.

His restaurants aren&#39;t the typical Mexican food, it&#39;s more fusion, which means they have some flavors and dishes you may not be used to.

For this particular location, it may be a little hard to find.  It&#39;s actually on the on/off ramp for Rt. 38 and 59.

The inside is decorated very nice.  It may actually have been the nicest / most upscale feeling Mexican restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to.  Don&#39;t let that fool you though, the prices are roughly the same as many other places.

al-chulo-west-chicago-3,Angela P.,3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg,Z71eGwb5aCijBRMr1xOXjQ,"Al Chulo is the sister restaurant to Geneva&#39;s Altiro Latin Fusion.  I was a fan of the Mexican restaurant previously in this storefront (around that curvy bend of Roosevelt and Route 59, next to a liquor store) and curious to see what opened in its place.

West Chicago is not the first town that comes to mind when thinking of new restaurants to try.  In the west suburbs it&#39;s usually Geneva, Naperville, but not West Chicago - a residential and industrial town that just gets confused with the actual city of Chicago.  So it&#39;s exciting to see something new and different in the area.

The interior of the restaurant is dim and open.  With tables positioned somewhat close together, I was surprised that other conversations did not overpower ours.

The menu is composed of dishes that are easily shareable, but as the waiter jovially pointed out, &#34;you don&#39;t have to share if you don&#39;t want to!&#34;  Tacos come in an order of 4 for $10, but these are on the smaller side, so eating 4 is not exactly a challenge.  I had the pastor tacos and loved the spicy kick.  It would have been nice to have a mix-and-match taco option though, because there were so many others I would have liked to try!

For sides, we shared the guacamole and spicy corn.  The guacamole was good, but for $8 I thought the portion was too tiny, and it&#39;s really just guacamole.  The spicy corn was delicious; one of their most popular dishes.  It&#39;s similar to an elote.

The drink menu is like a gift from god after a long day.  Margaritas, palomas, mojitos, and more!  I had the Hibiscus Cocktail (it had a funky name, but that&#39;s what it was) which was fresh, strong, and well worth whatever the pricetag was on it.

We had no problem getting a table on a Wednesday evening.  I&#39;ve visited a similar taco spot in Geneva (not Altiro) which often has wait times of an hour or longer.  Forget the cache of dining in Geneva and give Al Chulo a try.",04/09/16,218,4,2,4,33,3.9791999999999996,2.711,0.895,17.393,No,1955

We visited on a cold and rainy night. As others have said, the door opens right into the dining room. They wanted to seat us near the door and I told them I had to sit far away from it. I don&#39;t like eating with my coat on and I had to even though I was far away from the door. Although they try to make the interior nice, the chairs reminded me of plastic patio chairs. You can put a nice pillow on those, but they are still hard and don&#39;t really encourage taking your time to eat.

The drink menu is loaded with different kinds of mixed drinks which are about $10 each. Mine was good, but for $10 it should have had more liquor. There are no beers listed, we had to ask and yes they do have some.

The menu is limited and was kind of confusing. We had several questions and then ordered some tacos. They were tasty. We also had their selection of salsas and some chips. Those were flavorful.

I used the women&#39;s restroom and it was clean, but there was no toilet paper holder! It was just indicative of how they seemed to miss on the little things at this place.

There weren&#39;t many diners in the place, yet we felt like we were ignored. There wasn&#39;t any kind of extra effort made to make sure we were enjoying our experience.

It tasted so fresh and creamy, but not heavy. If we had not been in the middle of a restaurant, I would have definitely licked the bowl clean! Next was the guacamole - some of the best I&#39;ve ever had - fresh, chunky and full of flavor without too much heat. Next came the Al Tingo (shredded chicken piled on 3 mini tostadas) - the fresh flavor exploded in your mouth. Then came 4 Al Poblano Tacos which were covered in the creamy poblano sauce used in the Al Arroz - need I say more. We finished off our meal with the Tres Leches for dessert -  that was a wonderful exclamation point on a fabulous dinner. 

Service was fabulous! Can&#39;t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu and the handmade margaritas!

The flan was excellent with a hint of coffee flavor, but again they gave you a VERY small portion, 3-4 bites, for the price. If they increase the amount of product witin each taco and other plates as well, I feel that they would have more business. The price was a lot for what he were given. Very beautiful decor, but I believe they need to alter their dishes and make sure the ratio of tortilla to meat to make the customers more happy. I understand that it is an upscale Mexican restaurant, but some of their items needed a little more. My mother ended up adding guacamole to the shrimp tacos since all it consisted of was 1.

al-chulo-west-chicago-3,Nick P.,CDqlN4yELfSZeBQCj5FuYQ,YwDkllfmfpf3vDTnnoBH_w,"We were upset when we realized Changarro closed down as we ate there regularly. However, we were very excited to learn that Al Chulo was gonna be opening in that same location. After hearing great things about the place, my fianc and I decided to stop in for a late dinner last night. First off the decor is very classy and totally different from the Luchador masks that were on the walls when it was Changaro. We were seated right away. The place wasn&#39;t overly crowded but it was also 8:30pm. 
  We started with chips and guacamole. We both tried their specialty margaritas. My fianc loved the passion fruit one. Next we tried a few of their different tacos. Now if you are looking for traditional taco joint style tacos, this place is not for you. There are no basic ground beef, lettuce, and cheese tacos or burritos on this menu. However, if you want to broaden your palate and try some amazing food this is the spot. We had the al pastor tacos, fish tacos, and a steak &amp; chorizo sope. The al pastor tacos were better than the authentic ones we had when we were in Mexico. The sope was pretty amazing as well. Overall we very pleased with our food and drink choices.
   I have read several complaints on yelp about the service there. We had a great dining experience. Our waiter was actually Miguel, the owner of the restaurant. He is a great guy and has a true passion for what he does. He chatted with us throughout our meal and as the place died down he sat with us and had some great conversations. He even brought us out shots of his private reserve tequila. 
    Our quick late night dinner ended up being a 2.5 hr great dining experience. It goes to show you, treat everyone equally with kindness because we thought he was just a waiter and ended up being the owner and treating us very well. 
    I highly recommend this place if you want a  nontraditional mexican fusion delicious meal. We even talked to Miguel about catering our wedding. Please support this place so it sticks around.

Started with the Al Esquite roasted corn appetizer and the Al Camaleon shrimp/bacon/avocado tacos, which in end-of-meal review came out as close favorites.  Honestly, we could have each happily had our own bowl of the corn, but wanted to try more things. For seconds we shared Al Ceviche tortas (towers of lime-marinated Tilapia with red onions, tomatoes, avocado) and the Al Chulo tacos (steak, ham, bacon, cheese).  Almost full, we wanted &#34;dessert,&#34; so had Al Hongo portabellos roasted with chile and a sour cream/roasted salsa combo that did actually come across as slightly and deliciously sweet. I can&#39;t forget to mention the candy-in-a-glass mojito, worth breaking my usual tee-totalling tendencies.  I wish we had taken photos, but we really just wanted to eat this food as soon as it landed on the table.

I had the sangria, which was very tasty. 
We ordered the ceviche, guacamole, a creamy corn and rice casserole (can&#39;t remember the exact name) and the shredded pork tacos. This corn/rice dish was probably our favorite thing, and we enjoyed everything. (We ordered a 2nd helping of the rice/corn dish after we quickly finished the first one.)
I&#39;m sorry that we were too full for dessert; I can&#39;t wait to try their tres leche cake or their flan. (Next visit.)
The service was wonderful - both of the servers were very attentive and pleasant. They really loved that we enjoyed everything.
Guests need to keep in mind that this is tapas style, so they are small plates, meant to be shared. A few of the other commenters didn&#39;t seem to understand that. They are priced reasonably to all the other upscale tapas restaurants in this area; the bill was not more than we expected for the amount of food we ordered and again, we loved everything.

One recommendation for the menu is to create a combo of tacos. I would have loved to try more than the pork tacos.

They changed the location of the front door from the previous restaurant; it now opens up into the dining area. In the warmer months this won&#39;t be a problem at all, but it was cold tonight, and when the door opened, a gust of air blew right into the main area. Knowing this, we&#39;ll ask for a corner table when it&#39;s cold. 

We really can&#39;t wait to come back again. We&#39;ll try all new dishes, but we&#39;re always going to order the corn/rice dish.

After that, the rest of my review goes downhill.
First walking in to the restaurant, you see the updated atmosphere, pretty wall paper and fancy chairs. Not bad. The tables are super close together though. My husband and I were seated along the wall and I had to squeeze between 2 tables to get to the bench (I&#39;m not a big person either). If there was someone at the table next to us, we&#39;d have no privacy whatsoever. 
We looked at the menu and saw that the salsas were $6 each. Ok...not a fan, but we ordered one anyways. The salsa came out and it was at most 2 tablespoons worth. Not enough for 2 people. We were able to eat about 4-5 chips each with that one salsa. I don&#39;t want to spend $12+ on just salsa. We tried the guacamole as well...it came out looking pretty, but again, small portion. And very salty. Won&#39;t order that again. At this point we said something to our waiter about the size of salsa. The chef ended up coming out and explained that everything there was made fresh so the portions are smaller and more expensive. I get it...but lots of other places make their food fresh and it&#39;s not so expensive. 
I ordered the chicken taco that was fried with potato and cheese (sorry, forgot the name of it...El Donato maybe), but it tasted like fried tortilla. I could not even taste the chicken, potato or cheese. My husband ordered the &#34;Al Chulo&#34; taco...and that was good. 
So,  the food here is just ok. I understand they just opened and maybe have kinks to work out...but this was my first experience there. The portions are &#34;tapas&#34; style which I understand...but I still think they are too small. I do not think my food was worth $90 including tip. Not in West Chicago. Might come back in a couple of months to see if anything changed.",17/03/16,222,3,2,5,39,4.588200000000001,3.1310000000000002,0.28500000000000003,24.584,No,1918

They have more sophisticated palettes than most adults. The decor is very cool and modern for the location and the town of West Chicago.....I give it an A for effort. Tables are a bit small but they don&#39;t bring out the food all at once so its not such a big deal. Most Americans see a Mexican restaurant and expect burritos as big as your head and the typical gringo fair! You won&#39;t get that here. The food at Al Chulo is upscale modern tapas style Mexican. If your looking for a gluttonous American chain type of experience, then this isn&#39;t your place. Prices may be higher than most but your not getting your average tuesday night fast meal for you and the family. 

I loved it and will definitely be back. Its so important to patronize small business in your community. I know this......as Ive owned one for 23 years and always appreciate the kindness of my patrons!",22/03/16,98,5,1,4,10,3.1132999999999997,1.6620000000000001,0.0,10.338,No,956

My husband and I live close, and the place that was here before (Changarro) shut down- it was awesome and we hoped this would kind of be a replacement. Upper scale Mexican is hard to come by in the burbs. 

The decor is pretty, but not functional. Maybe the window seats with high tables would have been better, but we were sat in the middle of the room next to another couple despite being the only ones in there. The table was so small, and I couldn&#39;t comfortably cross my legs underneath it (I&#39;m 5&#39;1) it was not cozy at all. 

Drinks were great, and were much like the previous establishment- fresh muddled, proper margaritas. 
We ordered the salsa sampler and they were all delicious but extremely small portions with a tiny basket of chips. 

My husband ordered tinga style chicken tacos and he liked them. 
I&#39;m vegan, and I understand this can be a &#34;pain in the ass&#34; to some waiters. I don&#39;t expect to be fully catered to everywhere I go but I&#39;ve never been somewhere that tweaking a few things wasn&#39;t a problem. Aside from salsa and guac there was nothing for me. I asked if they could grill up some peppers, onion and potatoes for tacos. Pretty simple....but what they sent out was completely different. Beans, a slaw and what may have been grilled cactus. They weren&#39;t bad, but I don&#39;t think what I ordered would have been difficult to whip up...and I would have enjoyed more. 
The tacos are really small, and they don&#39;t come with a side of rice or beans etc. 

The service is....brand new restaurant service. Possibly brand new to serving service. They were nice and they tried, but more experience is definitely needed here. 

Also...my tacos came out first, and my husbands order took another 10+ minutes...kind of killed the &#34;dinner together&#34; vibe.

texas-roadhouse-crystal-lake,Jim S.,MkJWWwDSIVehGBiVU2Ggmw,zps-7f7horLPMxn4RnNhXg,"IMHO, the best of the casual Steak chain restaurants.

It&#39;s Father&#39;s day, so I got to pick the place for dinner.  I had fond memories of Texas Roadhouse from when we actually lived in Texas. Come to think of it, I had not been back to one in about 9 years; not because I didn&#39;t like it, but the nearest TR to me is a 35 mile round trip from my home.  Since it is only about 10 minutes from my wife&#39;s work, we decided to meet at the TR in Crystal Lake.

There was a crazy wait, but I had called ahead, so it was only about 10 minutes from the time we checked in. Not bad for Father&#39;s day.

We started with the fried pickles and bread for an appetizer. Both were very good.  I ordered a Fillet, my wife had the Salmon, and my daughter ordered a half slab of the Ribs.

All of the Entrees were excellent.  Like I said, I and not been to a TR in a long time, but as I recall the food was always really good, and the prices are reasonable for what you get.

My biggest take away here is the quality of the steak. I had the 8 oz. Fillet. It was cooked perfectly to my order, and was perfectly trimmed. There was absolutely no fat or gristle, and the steak was extremely tender and flavorful.

The steaks here are USDA choice, and they are hand cut at each restaurant.
The surprising thing is I&#39;ve had worse steaks at Morton&#39;s and some other more upscale steak places. The quality is a notch above Outback, Lone Star, Longhorn, and other similar steak restaurants. So.. I&#39;m pretty impressed especially considering the price.

The service was very friendly, although they were pretty slammed, so the drink refills got lost in the shuffle as they were handed off to a backup server. When our main server came back, she immediately noticed, and got us go cups for the way home.

Bottom line, it was a very good dinner. If they had one closer to my home, I&#39;d go more often.",19/06/16,214,4,2,5,20,5.4443,4.079000000000001,0.712,20.208999999999996,No,1898

texas-roadhouse-crystal-lake,Jason G.,X0ky9yFDYMoho-4dIpr5FA,LzYDL0eIcNbFpW046PSN2g,"Interesting experience. 

I called ahead to make our reservation, but come to find out, you can&#39;t.  They only allow you to call an hour before your arrival and give you a number to use when you check-in.  They have some funny name for it, but I don&#39;t recall.  So, we arrived 15 minutes before our requested time and were greeted by an astonishing amount of hostesses...I&#39;m not joking when I say about 8-10!!  It was a bit overwhelming with all of them trying to greet you at the same time.  I gave them my number, which was three digits and a letter...not the easiest to remember.  We then were given a buzzer and sent to sit down and munch on peanuts... we could chuck the shells on the ground.  Clearly, this is more of a sports bar than a steakhouse...there were flat screen televisions in every nook and corner they could possibly be placed.

We were guided through the maze of servers singing and dancing everywhere...a bit of a chaotic mess, in my opinion.  Right after we sat down, we were delivered some tasty rolls with some cinnamon butter concoction...highlight of the meal.  Our server came over and greeted us with her t-shirt that tells all the patrons that &#34;I heart being here&#34;  LOL! Extremely cheesy.  Our server was pleasant enough.  She took our drink orders and appetizer.  about 8-10 minutes later, our drinks arrived.  Shortly after, our fried pickles arrived.  The top few pickles were good, but when we got down to the bottom, they were uneatable since they were swimming in a pool of oil...gross!  I would not recommend these.

We placed our entree orders and had some conversation.  However, the conversation was constantly interrupted by the spontaneous line dancing by the servers.  Kinda stupid.  On top of that, it seems like every other table had a birthday celebration.  This meant that a group of servers would swarm the table and begin singing at the top of their lungs to the, in most cases, unwelcoming birthday person.  They even brought out some horse saddle thing and try and persuade them to jump on...I didn&#39;t see any takers.

On to our entrees.  I ordered the Half Ribs with Pulled pork and sides of apple sauce and corn.  The apple sauce never arrived, so I can&#39;t comment on that.  The ribs were okay, but kind of dry.  The pulled pork was the highlight for me, but the BBQ sauce that it was drenched in just wasn&#39;t to my liking.  I wish they had an option to have it on the side, or have a couple different sauces to choose from.  The corn had a pool of butter that it was in, hence the name buttery corn.  This was not a meal for anyone worried about their waste line.

My wife had the Sirloin and Shrimp with mashed potatoes.  She liked the shrimps, which I sampled, and were good enough.  The mashed potatoes tasted like boxed potatoes...clearly not made fresh.  She ordered the steak medium, but came well done...absolutely no pink.  Some guy, not our server, came over to check on our orders and we informed him that the steak was over cooked.  He took it back and said he would bring out a new steak.  The steak came after the rest of the table was done eating.  His way of making it up, was to offer a free appetizer on our next visit.  I guess this is his attempt to get us back in the door.  Most place would simply take it off the bill.  Not the best customer service.  Our waitress came later and asked how everything was going and we told her about the steak.  She said &#34;oh, I&#39;m sorry.  I didn&#39;t know he took it away.  They never tell us that stuff.&#34;  They need to work on communicating with one another....gave the appearance that they are still working out some kinks.  Unprofessional.  She said the same thing again as she apologized when she delivered us our bill...it wasn&#39;t her fault, but more so the manager that has clearly never managed a restaurant before.

My father order the BBQ chicken and it was a thin chicken breast that was nothing special.  My young girls had a joke of a burger.  Dry and tasteless.

Overall, I would only recommend coming here if you enjoy chainy experiences where they could care less about quality and more about shuffling in and out as many patrons as possible.

On a side note, good luck finding a parking spot!!  We were here on a Tuesday night and were lucky to find a spot in their lot.  Many were left to walk from the Sports Authority lot or Portillo&#39;s.",12/03/14,481,2,2,5,42,5.481200000000001,5.68,4.287,48.032000000000004,No,4410

The music is playing loud, so we had no idea what our hostess said as she guided us to our table (something about steaks, and bread).  After we were seated, our waitress was very nice.  Our drinks and salads came quick as did our dinner.  Prices are pretty reasonable, the pulled pork was nice and tender and juicy.  The medium-rare steak was more like medium to well done.

We come here for the ribs.  If you come here for anything else you might be disappointed.  I&#39;m not fond of the steak here...my ribeye was very thin and I could taste the gas it was cooked on.  The BBQ chicken is also delicious.

Service was pretty plain. No dancing to be seen, just lots of chat among the workers. Never even offered any upgraded on the steak like other restaurants, i.e. Lonestar or Longhorn.

We had to wait about 30 minutes which was completely fine considering it was prime time for dinner. While we waited my daughter spilled her water. I went &amp; asked one of the hostesses for a towel because my daughter had spilled. She gave me the dirtiest look ever, like I was putting her out. After about a minute &amp; a half she returned with a few cocktail napkins. She didn&#39;t ask where the spill was so she could clean it up but rather handed me the napkins &amp; went back behind the hostess station. I&#39;d like to mention that she wasn&#39;t the only hostess. There were 4 total. In my opinion, Sydney needs a refresher on how to be a hostess! If cleaning up spills is not in her job description then she should have asked a bus boy to clean it up. I have never been handed napkins to clean up a mess in a restaurant.

Was rather disappointed in the liquor selection though. No J_ger, no fireball, or Redbull.

I was in my car while I called and could not write down their confirmation number...I assumed incorrectly that my name and record of calling on my cell would be good enough. Nope. They couldn&#39;t find it even though I gave my first name and my number, and requested a table and not a booth or high-top. So we waited another 20 minutes to be seated in the very, very loud dining room. They should offer to text or email the confirmation numbers in the future.

I feel the place doesn&#39;t know what they are. Peanuts on the floor all over, but serving steaks? It&#39;s just tacky. The sports bar look of the place, but then the poor employees have to stop and line dance every half hour - really weird to be honest and there is so much work for them to be doing, this show isn&#39;t necessary and can tell how forced it is. 

Our table had the onion blossom appetizer and that was good - same as many other restaurants. Two of us had New York strip steaks with baked potatoes and green beans, the other person had the country fried steak. The steaks were fine - cooked as ordered (medium and medium rare) but nothing amazing. No option for blue cheese on it! The green beans were truly disgusting - they were canned and total mush, filled with raunchy tasting bacon bits. If you&#39;re going to put a veggie on your menu say if it&#39;s processed to all hell and contains pork, I really just wanted some steamed green beans. The baked potatoes were definitely either a microwave job or cooked in the oven hours in advance and kept under a warming light or in a warming drawer because the skin was tough and you could just tell.

The country fried steak was good for about 10 minutes, then the gravy got too cold and mushy...the breading became pudding combined with the gravy and it was inedible after that.

texas-roadhouse-crystal-lake,John B.,eFMnymmqMOV40q6a3HJJ3g,BxsBq6yCnCEzGKFQnrlcsg,"Ok so my wife and I wanted to try something new. We had never been here before and TR had been open for about a year.  
They must be going through some issues here as we were told none of the original kitchen staff were still with the company.  (I had met the original kitchen manager Pat and many others as they were opening the restaurant a year ago and all seemed really nice and seemed to really know what they were talking about).
We had the potato skins for an app which were ok but we had to add salt.
Two flavored lemonades were also ok, but overly sweet.
Ok now here&#39;s my biggest issue...
This place is NOT for the &#34;gluten-impaired&#34; shall we say.  If you have Celiac Disease--STAY AWAY!!!
My wife and I do not, however, we are sensitive.  My wife more so than myself.
We asked for a gluten-free menu (we just cut to the chase) and were given a small, torn piece of a GF menu with someones order on the back.
We almost walked out.
Not trying to be a jerk here, but it&#39;s a steak house, nearly everything on a steak house menu is naturally gluten-free.
It was extremely hard to get a straight answer about what to order that was gluten-free which tells me they just don&#39;t know.  Much more training is needed for everyone in this area!
The fries must have been the &#34;crispy coat&#34; fries (coated with flour for extra crispiness).
The steak seasoning contains flour (at least that&#39;s what I&#39;m figuring as, again, I couldn&#39;t get a straight answer even while talking with the acting KM.)
They make their seasoning mixes in house and must use flour with all of them as my wife ordered hers medium and without their typical seasoning and it was cooked WITHOUT ANYTHING--yes, that&#39;s right, no salt, no pepper, no granulated garlic--nothing, and it was pushing rare.  We sent it back.
Um...if you can&#39;t do the &#34;touch&#34; thing then use a thermometer--that&#39;s why they make them.
They should have 2 spice mixes in my opinion--one being gluten free...or at least add salt and pepper for GF requests.
I had mine medium and regular, but still had to add salt and pepper to it as it was under seasoned.  I was served medium rare, but kept it anyway as I can go either way with it.
Steamed vegetable medley...little or no seasoning on mine, my wife&#39;s was totally bland.
Caesar Salad, eh.
For dessert, two decafs and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.  Can&#39;t mess that up too much.  
Two stars for the potato skins and the efforts of the server and acting KM.
Food, not so much.
We won&#39;t be back.

texas-roadhouse-crystal-lake,Rachael L.,PY4_ZFdtRBE8_yBS9Ths_g,mpeRq0HjVJN4Q9Hj5h-izg,"My husband was excited to visit because he&#39;d been a fan for years, but I&#39;d never been. I was excited to see what all the fuss was about, so we decided to visit for dinner on a Friday. 

Expecting it to be packed, I phoned in for the &#34;call-ahead seating..&#34; The first ten calls I made rang busy, so I was happy to finally get through. An automated system led me into the queue, with advertisements in lieu of hold music. After around ten minutes on hold, the recordings stopped, but my call timer indicated the call was still active, so I waited. After 35 minutes, I gave up.  When I called back, I got through immediately, so I&#39;m not sure what happened, but it was irritating, to say the least...

The hostess told me to arrive an hour and 45 minutes later, and so we did, at 7:45pm. We were given a buzzer, and still ended up waiting another 10-15 mins, munching on peanuts.

On our way to the table, our hostess grabbed a basket of rolls, which were delicious with the cinnamon butter spread. Since we had plenty of time waiting, we ordered right away. Draft beer, margarita, and &#34;cactus blossom&#34; appetizer.  The appetizer arrived before the drinks, so the server brought water instead.  The appetizer was undercooked, with the onions barely saftened, and uncooked batter in the center. The flavor was great, but it should have been cooked longer. Margarita was excellent!

We got an 11oz sirloin and a &#34;Roadkill&#34; chopped steak. The sirloin was cooked med-rare (instead of Med-well as ordered), so it had to be sent back. The chopped steak was very good, but the onion topping was too raw for my taste. The sides were just okay. Mashed potatoes came with brown gravy which needed salt &amp; pepper . The corn tasted old, like it had slightly dried out. The Caesar salad was ok, but could have used more dressing. Lastly, the cup of chili was average, but enjoyable--until I bit on a dime sized chunk of cartilage, which ruined it. 

I&#39;ll go back once more to give it another shot; perhaps after the opening rush has died down. It seems most of my complaints could be attributed to the mad rush of customers and staff being overwhelmed, taking shortcuts, etc. on the plus side, the service was outstanding, and the environment was fun and inviting.",08/03/14,277,3,2,3,20,2.6001000000000003,2.9229999999999996,0.7909999999999999,22.287,No,2288

Had a family dinner there last night. Absolutely brutal. Only good thing was the fact our waitress was attentive. Everyone ordered steak and the only one who got the closest to what was ordered was my sister who only had to send it back 3 times. I ordered a steak medium rare and it came out so raw that I sent it back. So they made me another which came out cold. So I sent it back again and this time it came out raw so obviously I ask to speak with the manager( informed waitress she was doing an amazing job and it wasn&#39;t her fault), the manager waddled over to my table and basically tried to tell me that that is how a medium rare steak is supposed to look and that his cooks have done nothing wrong.so I asked for a box and said I will go home and cook it myself since your cooks can&#39;t figure it out. So he ends up comping our appetizer instead of actually doing anything about it. My stepmother ordered the green beans and you could tell that something wasn&#39;t right. Waitress and manager both claim that it was the ham and bacon that they cook them in but the smell was like chlorox cleaner and the taste I&#39;m not even sure how to describe it.all I know is I ate some and have spent the entire night in the bathroom I have eaten at other Texas Roadhouse restaurants and have never had this problem with the food or anything.

They just opened so they were slammed on a Monday night. Wait times were short which was nice. The building used to be a TGIFridays and what a difference they made. Its very nicely redone with lots of booth and table seating and huge wrap around bar with tons of TV&#39;s. I see this place giving buffalo wild wings a run for their money. 

On that note, this is particularly why I didn&#39;t enjoy it to the fullest. I don&#39;t like Bdubs and I certainly not a fan of sports bars usually because they are over crowded and are loud, two things that I try and avoid when I go out to eat. 

The food was alright. It&#39;s a little pricey but the portions are made to match so you don&#39;t feel the sting so bad. We saw the steaks and fresh bread pointed out to us by our host as we went to the table.Our meals were okay, I had the roasted chicken which was not was I was expecting, but good nonetheless.   My inlaws, and husband all got steaks with mushrooms and onions on top, which were too salty and they did not eat them. The manager was super kind and understanding though, and helped my in laws with some meal passes to come back and eat on their own. 

If you like having the entire restaurant know its your birthday they&#39;ve got someone who can seriously yell. There had to be at least 6 birthdays while we were there. They remind me of applebees the way they announce your name and age to the entire venue and continue to clap, dance and sing. Speaking of clapping, dancing and singing this place also plays a country song once every hour to which the staff is trained to dance. You really must enjoy dancing if you work here.

The overall experience was loud, happening, and very interactive.  Our server Sara was AMAZING. Friendly, very personable, accommodating, and welcoming. THe only thing we can&#39;t get over is how they were dancing while we were eating, and my husband dropped his knife on the floor. The server dances by, picks it up, smiles at him, and dances away, but never brought a new one! He was mid meal! He had to use mine to finish. Hahaha, we thought that was funny. This would not be my first choice to return to, however if that&#39;s what the group wants I know I can find someone I&#39;ll enjoy if I go. 

Also, perhaps unrelated note I did eat around 7:30pm and this morning at 4am I was in the bathroom for a Roadhouse size upset stomach.

Upon sitting we were served there hot rolls and house cinnamon butter which I like. Our server Erick could not have been nicer. I advised him right off that we were not in a hurry and wanted a relaxing dinner. He took our drink order and suggested a few appetizers, allowed us plenty of time to chose. Once we decided on the onion blossom and enjoyed it he came to check on us and was not pushy to take our food order. Once we were ready to order he could not have been more accommodating for us.

We were informed they only had 3 tables that could hold a party of 8. We only had about a 10-15 minute wait. Our table consisted of a long booth with a table put on the end with 2 additional chairs. 
3 of us ordered Prime Rib Medium Rare. Our waitress informed us they were out of medium rare prime rib. We could get Medium, Medium well, or well done. Who runs out of medium rare prime rib at 4:30-5pm on a Saturday? I changed mine to a Porterhouse/T-bone which was pretty good. The 2 others who ordered the prime rib their cuts were VERY fatty. 
By the time we left about 6pm - all 3 tables that could hold a party of 8 were filled with tables on the end with 2 chairs. So it was difficult for servers, and patrons to get by in the isle. As we left all the booths along the bar all had chairs at the end of the tables to accommodate parties of 5 or 6.  Again difficult for  servers, and patrons to get by in the isle.

The rolls were awesome and the dancing was great. Our server was nice. The blooming onion was the best I have ever had. I ordered their ribeye. Before ordering, I asked the server how big it was. He showed us with his hands (13 inches long). I thought to myself that that was amazing. When I got it, it was 13 inches, including the 4 inches on each side of fat, and it was overcooked. So really, the edible portion was 5 inches long, 2 inches wide when I was told it was wayyy bigger. We called the manager over and explained everything and he let me choose something else after a long discussion about how he thought it was ok. I chose the New York strip steak and a little while later got it. It looked like it was a different shape then the New York strip steaks they were displaying in their meat cooler but I assumed it was still the New York even though it tasted rougher than a New York. When we got our bill, we discover that I got a sirloin for the replacement (a much cheaper steak), and I was pretty mad.

You mislead me about the size of my steak and overcooked it the first time, and you don&#39;t even give me the steak I want as a replacement. Good job guys! :)",08/07/14,143,1,2,5,18,4.6065000000000005,4.087999999999999,0.126,12.786,No,1246

We were here on a Saturday for lunch and we were seated in a booth directly across from the bar and the computer system where employees enter tickets. The whole time all of the employees just hung out here just a few feet away, it got really distracting. They were also hanging out in a booth directly behind us (2 booths away). The whole vibe was weird because we constantly had a crowd of people by us. My husband used the bathroom and said there was a server crying by the bathroom talking to another server going on about how some guy is an a-hole. Really? Leave the drama at home. 

Maybe it was because there wasn&#39;t a lot of patrons and they weren&#39;t busy but have the employees socialize elsewhere.",17/09/14,76,4,1,-1,-38,-1.4165,0.0,0.877,8.123000000000001,No,770

I ordered salmon which was pretty tasty, but it was full of bones.  For  the small piece of fish I had, I couldn&#39;t believe how many bones there were.  After dinner we got a piece of cheesecake, which was so small, it was funny.  The bill was under $100 for 4 adults to eat.

we came in for the first time today (like 3 hours ago) after debating between this and Outback, since we had never been, we chose here. We got the rolls, which were fantastic with the butter! Unfortunately everything went down hill after that. We got a full slab of ribs, fried pickles, cactus blossom, bacon cheese burger, cheese fries, chili and a caesar salad, some of these were sides for the big items.
The cheese fries and chili were ok.
The ribs and caesar salad were good but nothing fantastic, the ribs were fall off the bone, literally, but the meat wasn&#39;t overly flavorful and the barbecue sauce was just eh, something I could buy at Jewel for like $2. 
The cactus blossom and the fries were personally gross for me, some type of seasoning in the breading was just gross, and I couldn&#39;t stomach it so I just stopped eating them.
And the burger was ok, but too salty for me, I can say they cooked it perfectly though!
The service was ok in some spots, good in others, and great in one.
It was ok in the front, the hostesses looked put out when we came in, because god forbid we interrupt their texting and gossiping.
Our waitress talked... a lot, but she was friendly and wanted to help in any way, which is good customer service in my opinion.
As for the other workers, some were just blank faced, at least ours was smiling, but there was one fantastic server, who I wish we had, he was smiling, friendly, very perky, and even lead the line dance happily.
So all in all it was ok, with 2 shining moments. I&#39;d give 2.5 stars, but I don&#39;t want to give the full 3.",29/06/14,193,2,3,4,57,3.3190999999999993,2.41,0.9829999999999999,9.607999999999999,No,1621

If you want a quality steak, go to Jameson&#39;s or even the commercialized Outback and I guarantee you will be better off.  For those that are old enough to remember Ponderosa Steakhouse, this is what their steaks taste like-no joke!
The only plus I can say are for the hot rolls with cinnamon butter and a delicious sweet potato. 
We ordered rib eyes cooked medium. My son&#39;s was well done, shriveled up and char black on one end. Needless to say, we sent it back. He sat there while we ate ours, and we would share bites with him when he would let us. Granted, rib eye&#39;s are marbleized cuts, but they were just a little too fatty for our liking. They brought grilled onions when we asked for mushrooms, had to bring out green beans that they had forgotten. By the time my son&#39;s new steak came out, it was not as well done, but not medium either. He still had grissel to cut around. He had a cup of chili that he said was tasty, but like I said the second steak was just ok.

The tacos were excellent.  I ordered 3 steak with onions and cilantro.  I wasn&#39;t asked what kind of salsa I wanted, but was told it was in the bag.  In the bag I found 1 red and 1 green.  I don&#39;t use red, so that was a waste, but I would have liked another green.  Extra salsa can be purchased for $0.25.  I wasn&#39;t given any lime for my taco and I was honestly too afraid to ask  - this guy was not having a good day and I didn&#39;t want to make him angry!

Now the chips and guac -- both are good.  The guac is a little onion heavy, but I love onion, so no bother there.  The portion, however, is silly.  They serve a large Styrofoam clam-shell of chips -- enough for 2+ people to share, and a tiny two-ounce portion of guacamole -- for $4.25!

The interior is kind of interesting: rustic, industrial, casual. The tables are pretty large - maybe a bit awkward but then again I&#39;m pretty tiny so perhaps they are normal sized LOL.

The starter salsa and chips were tasty. The salsa had a kick on the end of it, so by the time my food came, I was grateful to douse the fire that had grown in my mouth. Yummy though! 

I had the fish taco (dinner) in flour tortillas w/ beans and rice. The fish tacos were delish! Very fresh and flavourful. Would definitely order them again!!!

We moved to West Dundee back in 2003.  We LOVE Mexican food!!!  We first tried this place back in 2003 and were completely disappointed...the food was somewhat tasteless and very dry.
About a year later we decided to give it another try.  Although we ordered different meals than the year prior (it was so bad that we remembered what we ordered) the food remained on par with our previous experience.  It was edible...that&#39;s all.
Now, it&#39;s 2011 and we still live here.  We live in the neighborhood right across Huntley Road so it&#39;s very convenient.  It was Cinco de Mayo so we thought we&#39;d give it one last try after 7 years to see if anything changed.  Shame on us.  
I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga dinner.  Right off the bat my chimi looked terrible.  It had no real shape to it and appeared to be a bit soggy.  And it was.  I touched it with my fork and there was not one bit of it that was crispy in the least.  It had the consistency of a wet leather moccasin.  I took a bite and that was the end of it.
I then turned to the re-fried beans.  I am not exaggerating when I tell you they are gray in color.  It was very unappetizing yet since my main course was off the table I gave the beans a try.  I mixed in a little of the rice and some green sauce and except for the awful color they were OK.
My wife ordered the chicken flautas and was equally disappointed with her entire meal.  She was less adventurous with the beans though.
Now I know when I personally read 4 and 5 star reviews and then see one bad review (mine) I typically overlook that bad one as I presume the reviewer either just got unlucky or has a bone to pick with the establishment.  I assure you neither of those applies to my review as we have tried this place 3 times and I waited 8 years to finally review it.  If you do disregard my review (which I admitted I probably would considering the other reviews) I wish you good luck.
Note* In the past 8 years we have consistently received excellent food from ON the Border (over on Randall).

Crab ragoon
Crispy chow fun noodles w/the green veggies and shrimp
Chef&#39;s special shrimp and scallops
Chicken &amp; beef curry
Plain white rice
Fried rice

The chow fun noodles I&#39;ve never tried cripsy before and the were pretty good.

The Chef&#39;s special was delicious and came out overflowing the plate (by the way they have big portions)

The chicken curry dish was too soupy for me. It wasn&#39;t exactly how I expected curry to be. It looks and tastes more like gravy and it&#39;s not thanksgiving so I didn&#39;t enjoy that too much.

The crag ragoon comes out extra crispy (6 big ones) and none to little cream cheese filling which I APPRECIATE because I actually don&#39;t like my crag ragoon all creamy and fatty. Their crab ragoon appetizer here is filled with I believe is real crab meat.

The fried rice I enjoyed because it came with little beef cube chunks I believe and it didn&#39;t taste overly seasoned or salty. None of the food did which I thought was great.

The burnt ends are a must-have every time I go. I&#39;m usually not a fan of sweeter pickles but they just taste right with the balsamic-BBQ glazed brisket ends. So damn delicious. I&#39;m also a big fan of the BBQ Nachos. In fact, I could make a meal out of just appetizers here. 

Anything from the smoker is great. I&#39;ve had the ribs, honey-brined chicken, pulled pork, and hot links from the smoker. Shout out for having crispy, salty tater tots as a potato option! Yes!!

I recently made what I thought in my mind was a very brave decision to veer away from the smoked meats and appetizers and order something from the entrees section of the menu. I tried the chicken and grits. In very few words, it was amazing. High five to the chef who decided to use thighs for this dish. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. The sriracha-honey drizzle on top was the perfect finishing touch. For such a heavy-sounding dish (fried chicken thighs on top of cheese grits) it is surprisingly well-rounded. So damn good. Like I&#39;ll probably order it every time I go and just sneak bites of BBQ from my tablemates. The portion is more than enough to eat half and bring the rest home for lunch the next day (or a midnight snack).

The only thing I&#39;ve had that I could probably pass on the next time is the chicken wings. The combination of smoke and buffalo was just a little too much for me, and they were a little too salty. That doesn&#39;t take away any desire to come back though! I&#39;m glad I tried them, I&#39;ll just choose something else next time!

....great, now I&#39;m craving.",30/10/16,232,4,1,5,9,7.476899999999998,5.518999999999999,0.9550000000000001,20.524,No,1934

Staying overnight before flying out of o&#39;hare, we were frankly kind of unexcited about dinner options nearby. Hmm, take our chances with strip mall Thai or Mexican food (before an international flight seems risky...), go to one of the gazillion chain restaurants nearby, order delivery pizza, or take our chances on a place that says it has great ribs &amp; BBQ. We took our chances and don&#39;t regret it. 

Spacious place, no wait at 6pm on a weeknight, a terrific selection of whiskey, bourbon, cocktails, beer, and moonshine, and friendly service were a nice opener. 

The husband had the BBQ combo with Texas hot links &amp; pulled pork - both were delicious, though his baked potato was lackluster. I had the grilled chicken Sammie which was super yum - perfectly cooked &amp; seasoned chicken, lots of caramelized onions, on a tasty roll. And - best part! - it came with fries or (duh) tater tots. These were some high quality tater tots. (and I&#39;m a bit of an expert...) 

We shoulda passed on the meh chips &amp; salsa &amp; Guac appetizer (though the salsa was fresh &amp; flavorable and the Guac was fine), but my side salad was a cut above the usual iceberg side salad, with mixed greens, chopped cucumbers, tomatoes &amp; huge tasty croutons. 

Did I mention the whiskey &amp; cocktails? We may have each had one. 

Super tasty, good service, very reasonably priced, and if you can ignore the TVs everywhere, it&#39;s great. We&#39;d definitely go there again.",21/06/16,203,4,2,5,42,6.158900000000001,3.152,0.241,11.607999999999999,No,1587

One of the things I like about this place is it&#39;s a big building, but it&#39;s not a big, single room restaurant.  They&#39;ve separated the eating areas into smaller, more intimate rooms (2 with a shared fireplace) and also a good sized outdoor patio with a fireplace.

In all the times I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve never stopped into the bar area.  So when my friend was celebrating his birthday we went there for beers.

Once at the bar, then a high top, and then an actual table in the dining back area. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I have received the slowest service compared to any other restaurant all with a different server each time. The restaurant isn&#39;t even busy! It&#39;s just a quarter full with empty tables everywhere. I just don&#39;t get it. I&#39;m fairly confident that they hire waitstaff with no prior experience.

The food is good, they have a good drink selection and craft beers. Their moonshine drinks are meh. Not as strong as you would hope/want. We had the burnt ends - so good! And the nachos and southwest wrap is yummy. So the few stars in giving you go to food, but sorry, the service has outweighed the food...

But I can&#39;t stand my dinner being extended by an extra hour and a half because you don&#39;t know how to train your staff. Last night when I came here, we ended up getting our appetizer out BEFORE we still had even ordered our entrees with menus lying around everywhere. Just to give you an idea of how attentive the staff was... I can see servers easing up once you get your food... But having to wait 30 mins to order isn&#39;t cool. 

You would think the waitress would ask us for our food order immediately when dropping the appetizer off and realizing that she probably has slacked a little...But didn&#39;t and kept up her consistency with darting away before we can even ask her for anything. Probably tending to her other two tables she servicing, ya know... Because she&#39;s so busy. It was funny because when she got back she said, &#34;So, are you ready to order yet?&#34; YES, like five years ago! Seriously?!

Also, half the table never got waters... Probably cuz she forgot to bring the rest out? There was five of us.... We had to follow up another two times for them. Also because of the service, don&#39;t expect refills on drinks either - alcoholic or not.

I take the same approach with restaurants. There&#39;s so many variables when it comes to restaurant different servers, different nights, busy one day more than others, and just in general different managers.so you hold that it&#39;s always a good experience this time but you never know.

I&#39;ve been to the Rack more than a few times. And each time the whole meal as a whole was never that great. The ribs will be good with the chicken wasn&#39;t fully cooked. Or the meatloaf which is fantastic by the way was good but then they would not put enough sauce on top of it. I could say I never had a fulfilling experience there.

So tonight when we went my expectations were low. The service was decent. She was not very attentive and then do a good job like bringing up the drinks or refill on the drinks. I got the combination of ribs and brisket. I&#39;ve gotten the ribs before and I didn&#39;t think they were that great at all. I thought I could a got better at the grocery store in the pre-cook section. This time when they came out for the combination meal I wasn&#39;t expecting to have to a half rack but three pieces of ribs is just sub par. Factor in it was way over cook and I thought I was eating Jack Links jerkey. The difference being Jacks is chewy and this was was just el carbon. The brisket wasn&#39;t great either. Not terrible. Serviceable. I would say it would be awesome at a high school lunch. 

I tried my friends Carolina Pulled Pork. Yup over cooked. Spinach? Salt and butter. Looked delicious. Too much salt. Actually more than a few people said it was a very salty meal.",20/02/16,179,2,1,4,-20,3.8223,3.4010000000000002,0.89,23.709000000000003,No,1664

Prices aren&#39;t very high for barbeque but not a bargain -- decent sized portions. Service is friendly, but could be a little faster. The food is mostly unmemorable -- the textures are acceptable, the flavors aren&#39;t perfect but nothing is unpleasant, the theme of the dishes isn&#39;t obvious but there seems to be some care put into the preparation.

The best item I tried on my trip was the brisket -- tender and tasty and in hearty slices. The smoked sausage was also very flavorful, with a bit of a kick -- although I didn&#39;t love the flavorings that were used. The BBQ chicken, pulled pork, and baby back ribs failed to leave much of an impression. Each could&#39;ve been more moist, but they weren&#39;t terribly overcooked either -- possibly an extra bit of marination instead of depending on the barbeque sauce for flavor could&#39;ve been an improvement.

The sides were alright as well -- the corn bread has a strong flavor of corn, but is a bit on the dry side. The baked beans had a good texture and flavor, like a sweet chili. The coleslaw was also flavorful, but could&#39;ve been a little more creamy.

Rack House does seem to have promise, as the ingredient quality and smoke flavor is in the food -- a little refinement on cooking times and flavor would easily bump them up to 4 or 5 stars.",02/08/15,156,3,2,4,39,3.8793,2.0060000000000002,0.637,9.357,No,1441

We sat down and we started with an order of cheese curds. The cheese curds came out piping hot and delicious! The chili aioli really made the cheese curds POP! Unsure how others can label them as &#34;bland&#34;. 

Our server was very nice, considering we came in about an hour to close. He recommended an excellent craft brew. We both thoroughly enjoyed the recommendation. 

Next, we both ordered the Beef Brisket / Quarter Baby Back Ribs combo. It came with Jalapeo coleslaw, a baked potato, and AMAZING honey butter cornbread. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the Jalapeo cornbread. 

The ribs were excellent, the meat fell right off the bone. The brisket was delicious, with a persistent smoky flavor to it. The ribs and brisket were coated in a light &#34;glaze&#34; of barbecue sauce. However, I must say the meats needed a bit more sauce on them.

For the next six months we had tried to get out to this place with no success... And finally we made it. In a word, wow.

For starters, Brandon was our server and he was absolutely on top of everything. Super nice guy with great recommendations and extremely prompt service. When he had given us our appetizer of the burnt ends he asked how it was. I was genuinely giving constructive criticism in saying that it was a little bit fatty for my tastes, when a manager was walking by had asked me to repeat myself and ended up comping that appetizer. We didn&#39;t expected but I will be honest that it was actually really nice of them.

My girlfriend and I then went for the full rack of ribs. At $26 it is a steal and let me tell you it was one of the best racks of ribs I&#39;ve had in a very long time. The meet was so fall off the bone that it literally fell off the bone one my girlfriend picked up one of the reps. In a word I would describe it as succulent. It&#39;s a must get if you go there. Additionally, the cornbread that came with the meal was remarkable. It had those little pieces of corn in it which burst with flavor and was Don just... Very well.

Finally, on the side we had macaroni and cheese. Our waiter told us that it was their new recipe for macaroni and cheese and it is a winner. The cheese was nice and creamy macaroni was fresh and cooked to perfection where it was not too hard are not too soft.

All in all, this was a pretty epic place. I was extremely satisfied and we are definitely going back. The total bill was $36 which is nothing short of an absolute steal. If this was in the city and had the name Webbers it could sell for three times the price only in this case it would be twice is good. Put it this way...

In speaking of service, our server was great. The entire night he was very attentive, explained the menu, and even gave us a free dessert! The service is what really put this restaurant over the top.

The food was really good too. They have a variety of different things to try. I decided on the combo BBQ platter with pulled pork and brisket.

We were out in the &#39;burbs with the grandkids anyway, so why not try it? 

We were very pleased! Chef Bryant had a special of his Chicken and Cheesy Grits which is soooooooooooooooo good. Then my husband tried a new special of steak and shrimp with a saucy topping. He loved it so much he ate the whole thing. Sorry I can&#39;t describe the sauce for you - it looked slightly BBQ-ish - but I didn&#39;t get a bite!

The staff took great care of our pair of 4-year-old boys, not an easy task what with a spilled drink and such. Turned out the boys loved the BBQ brisket more than the their own chicken tenders. They also liked the cheesy grits and the broccoli!

The gooey chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top sounded like an ordinary combination, but something about it made it much better than others we&#39;ve had. We thought we were sharing  the dessert with all three generations, but the grandsons moved onto grandpa&#39;s lap and the three of them ate the whole thing themselves :)

Rack House is huge compared to Cafe Selmarie but it&#39;s built in smaller sections so it felt &#34;warmer&#34; rather than industrial. The section we sat in could seat about 70 people and it was well-staffed in that we always had service as soon as we needed it. I would suggest to the restaurant that having the list of specials on the table while we decided what to order would be more helpful than having the waiter read it to us after we&#39;d been perusing the menu. That made ordering a 2-step process because we switched to ordering the specials once we heard them. 

One memory our grandson repeats over and over - the waiter brought him THREE cherries on a plastic &#34;sword&#34;.

Add a couple bucks for toppings and you are set. They use really good meat, know how to cook it right, and are simply awesome. They even taste smokey. Almost like you actually hired a professional chef who uses fresh food to grill at ur own BBQ. 

As for their BBQ, amazing again. I&#39;ve had the ribs, the brisket, and the pork. All of it was melt in your mouth good. Perfectly smoked everything. I would almost say this food is as good as and possibly better than smoque in the city. 

Honestly, everything I put in my mouth here is awesome. I usually hate The side of coleslaw all restaurants and give. But this place really pays attention to how it&#39;s made. I have never liked coleslaw until I&#39;ve tried it here. And the cornbread is also ridiculous. Mashed potatoes yes. Tater tots yes. French fries yes.

And let&#39;s not get started on the moonshine. 

The only complaint I would give this place is that it costs between 18 and $25 for the barbecue platter. But in their defense, they do give a lot of food.

They skimped on the sauce: I expect my proteins to be either slathered in BBQ sauce or with generous portions on the side in containers; neither was the case.

*On top of that the 3 Trifecta proteins I ordered were pretty much devoid of BBQ/smoke flavor.  However, the meats were NOT dried out which I appreciated.

*This was a worst-case scenario for carryout: They didn&#39;t include any of the 3 extra sides I paid extra for, but I received 2 sides I didn&#39;t order nor want.

rack-house-kitchen-and-tavern-arlington-heights-2,Drew S.,0Mj-cKa6mbr-M7dS-POt0Q,OF3tCNWWsBKSt5RJZm7Sew,"I&#39;ve been eating at Rack House with my same party of 4 since they opened. There are two things that are very consistent with Rack House: 1) The food is always really good, and 2) the service is always mediocre. I don&#39;t like being negative so I&#39;ll focus on the good stuff first.

The food is always excellent, which is what keeps bringing us back to Rack House. My brother loves the BBQ brisket sandwich, and there isn&#39;t anything I&#39;ve ordered that I didn&#39;t enjoy. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich is good, the salads are good (there is a tuna salad I really like), the soups are good, appetizers good, the tater tots (mmmm).... just very solid good food. Everything is a huge size portion, so the nice thing is you can have leftovers for later. There is a good variety on the menu so even if you don&#39;t like BBQ you can find something to eat. They also have a decent beer list as well. The patio in the back looks awesome (though my brother won&#39;t eat outside so I never get to sit out there).

The downside is that every time we go the service is bad. Having been a server for a long time, I&#39;m just surprised at the lack of even basic serving skills that these kids have. Over the last several visits we&#39;ve encountered a myriad problems ranging from being forgotten at the table, our orders not put in, our orders being wrong, servers disappearing for long swaths of time (to the point we have to ask the host to find our server), lack of knowledge regarding the menu, table numbers being entered wrong by multiple serving staff (as is evident from food runners stopping at multiple tables desperately trying to find where the food goes) or receiving general pithy behavior that borders on rudeness. The food is delivered to tables by runners, so I&#39;m not sure where the servers disappear for such long periods of time. The hosts, however, are always friendly and chipper. 

Look, I&#39;m not some picky needy person, and I really don&#39;t like leaving bad reviews. If you want good food and good beer go to Rack House, you won&#39;t be disappointed. It just surprises me that for as GOOD as the food is at Rack House, their service is consistently bad. There are always tables sat when we go, but I think they could really boom if the serving staff had better performance.",25/08/15,276,3,3,5,59,5.155000000000002,3.686,1.439,13.875000000000004,No,2311

rack-house-kitchen-and-tavern-arlington-heights-2,Katie F.,1PZtuBIXqPjK6X0a-d_euA,2gMXBOiHltzQzN_6XXx0NQ,"Rack House has the kind of atmosphere where you want to kick back and relax with a bucket of beer and a bounty of friends. The service we receieved when we went in for a late dinner on Saturday night was great. Despite having both indoor and outdoor sections, our server was consistently checking in and tending to our needs. That&#39;s  pretty much where the rosy picture of Rack House ends...

Ordered: 2 sandwiches (BBQ Brisket &amp; Reuben)
Received: 4 thick slices of bread with BARELY any meat! The meat we did get was meh-countless small, fatty, pieces made up most of the brisket after I dug through the coleslaw and fried onions that seemed to make up a large part of the sandwich. The reuben, while drenched in a flavorful sauce, had an amount of meat that didn&#39;t even come close to what one would expect a typical reuben to have. I guess we failed to see the humor behind their deception in making these sandwiches &#34;appear&#34; to be more substantial.

For a bbq restaurant that specializes in several types of meat dishes, it was disappointing to not be able to actually taste much meat. The ratio of meat to bread was laughable, and after perusing some of the reviews on here, I know I&#39;m not the only one who has had the same unfortunate experience. For $12 sandwiches, we expected more. We deserved more.

The cherry on top? Took one last swig of my red wine, only to immediately spit it out. Nearly a tablespoon full of sediment at the bottom of my glass. Wtf.

It&#39;s a shame that the food and drink, the actual REASON people choose to go out to restaurants instead of cooking at home, is the only real thing lacking about this place.

The atmosphere/interior is quite nice! There is a few different seating areas including two bars and a secluded dining area. 

I was really worried about the food but it  turns out they have a few Gluten free items on the menu.  It&#39;s not just a bull **** offering either, which is usually apparent at places trying to jump on the bandwagon *cough Jason&#39;s deli cough*. This is always a good sign seeing as I have Celiac disease. The choices are all good but I&#39;ve only had the bourbon ribs and tortilla soup which were both surprisingly above average. 

The whiskey selection is also very good! This is a great place to go if you&#39;d like to try a bunch of different whiskey. Bulliet 10 year was a nice addition. They also have a sizeable craft beer list as well.

The food is excellent. I tried a surf and turf special one evening, and the skirt steak was mouthwatering. The BBQ combo platter is also very tasty, especially the beef brisket. I also love the cornbread that comes with it!  I always enjoy the chef&#39;s specials, and last night one option was flank steak that came with beans and rice. Outstanding! I think it&#39;s great that they are branching out from their traditional menu and adding some interesting specials. And for a starter, the cheese curds are not to be missed. Very yummy!!

They have cider, which for me is a great option. The wine list is short, but has some good choices available. One evening margaritas were on special. Can&#39;t beat that!

The service has always been top-notch. One evening we had two four year olds with us, and our server could not have been more accomodating. I heartily recommend Rack House. It is comfortable, has great service, and I really love the food!",11/12/15,128,5,2,5,23,7.8114,5.74,0.0,12.26,No,1053

rack-house-kitchen-and-tavern-arlington-heights-2,Cat D.,YmAbBdA8sNeochLz8Nis5Q,GyIyCMKxmxtVBFC-8fYnkA,"I&#39;ve had a few different experiences at The Rack House. Here is a breakdown:

I&#39;m giving the restaurant two stars because I had a mostly pleasant experience when my husband and I dined in. The food is good.

However, things start to rapidly spiral downward when it comes to their online ordering system and catering.

Online ordering: Great in theory! However, I paid for dinner online and then my husband went to pick up the food. My husband accidentally paid again at the counter. The restaurant doesn&#39;t have a system in place to catch mistakes like this. Luckily, I noticed the double charge on our statement and through a series of several calls with employees and managers at the restaurant, finally got the second charge refunded. If you&#39;re going to offer online ordering and payment, you need to have checks in place that don&#39;t allow for the possibility of charging customers twice. Also, shouldn&#39;t the restaurant&#39;s books have been off at the end of the night? I&#39;ve worked in retail. If the money doesn&#39;t add up, you find out where the error is and correct it.

Catering: Buyer beware! I hosted a baby shower recently and decided to cater some food from The Rack House. I went online, selected the package and was ready to go. Until, I saw the total cost and realized it was about $50 more than it should be. (I did take into consideration taxes and I planned on picking up the order, so no delivery fee.) I called the restaurant and walked through my order with an employee. When we got to the checkout portion, she also saw the $50 overcharge and didn&#39;t know where it was coming from. She said she&#39;d get in touch with their website managers and get back to me. That was about a month ago and I have yet to hear back. Needless to say, I took my business elsewhere. If there&#39;s a good explanation for $50 tacked on to my order I&#39;m happy to hear it. Otherwise, it makes it look like the restaurant is hiding charges assuming the customer just won&#39;t notice.

Good food. Very disappointed in just about everything else.",03/10/14,223,2,1,2,-19,1.7938000000000005,2.9370000000000003,1.357,22.706999999999997,No,2078

Now for the not so good...
I&#39;m not a fan of the atmosphere inside as it is dark and really doesn&#39;t have the dcor you would expect of a BBQ joint. The food isn&#39;t all that great either. I&#39;ve tried the salmon, the brisket, and several of their burgers (which in my opinion are your best/safest bet) all of which were nothing special. It seems every visit to The Rack House involves some sort of issue.

The first time I came here I ordered a side of mac &amp; cheese with an appetizer: fried pickles and sweet corn. The mac &amp; cheese was not bad but not amazing. A unique thing was that they added crumbled corn muffin on top. The fried pickles and sweet corn were bland, which made the greasiness stand out (greasy is expected, but these were GREASY). I couldn&#39;t finish them; I guess this is why appetizers are meant for sharing. 

The second time I came here I got the steak tacos. Where the appetizers from last time lacked taste, these tacos had too much; they were extremely salty. And there was only two, which meant I not only didn&#39;t have leftovers, I actually thought about ordering another entree because I wasn&#39;t full yet. 

I did end up getting the cookie sizzler for dessert. The sizzler was small (I had no problem eating the entire thing on my own), and it got so soggy from the melting ice cream by the end, I couldn&#39;t finish the last bite. The first few bites were pretty good. It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve had better dessert sizzlers elsewhere.

So is the food here worth the price? Personally, I&#39;m going with a no. If I&#39;m going to be paying over $10 for my food, it better be somewhat decent. I&#39;m not that picky of an eater, but this stuff does not meet my standards. I&#39;d rather pay a few bucks more somewhere else and get much better food.

I admit it may have just been the food I ordered that left a bad taste in my mouth (literally), but they shouldn&#39;t have items on the menu that they can&#39;t cook well. If I do go back to this place, I&#39;ll try a burger on a Thursday (it&#39;s the daily special), and I&#39;ll leave an updated review. My friends have said that the burgers were alright. However, at this point, I am not impressed with this place.

On top of the sub-par food, the service was also very slow. It felt like our waitress took half an hour to come back to our table each time. It didn&#39;t even look like it was a busy night! Plus she would totally forget about things she had agreed to bring us, and then she messed up on my friend&#39;s drink order and kept saying she swore she heard him order what she brought him (he didn&#39;t). I will say that she was very nice, but nice does not really make up for poor service.

One thing I do like about this place is the cute dining area they have outside. They have a nice fireplace, and when it gets dark, they put out candles in mason jars which adds to the cozy ambiance. They also have TVs so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s great if you want to catch a game during dinner. I would recommend this place for drinking in the outdoor dining area during the summer - and maybe for the daily specials when the prices are more reasonable.

However, our most recent experience (Sept. 17), was one that we still were experiencing the next morning, and not in a good way. I ordered the Over Easy burger, medium well and it came out over cooked and hard as a puck. My brother ordered the Trifecta (ribs, chicken and salmon), and the food was so dry and tasteless that he barely had 2 bites before he sent it back. The chicken was so bad that after chewing a bite, it turned into a dry paste in your mouth. The salmon was also horribly over cooked. It&#39;s almost as if each item was sitting under a heat lamp for a long time and just smothered in BBQ just before it was served. Finally, my friend had the sliced brisket sandwich and while it wasn&#39;t as bad as my brother&#39;s plate, it was still very dry.

Granted, by the time we ordered, it was after 8:00. But that doesn&#39;t mean we should be served food that isn&#39;t freshly prepared. And I promise you that none of the food was freshly prepared. Most, if not all of it, was put in a microwave to reheat it.
We spent over $100 that night, even with my brother&#39;s meal being taken off the check. We were prepared to chalk it up to a bad night by your cooks, until all 3 of us woke up the next morning with bad stomach cramps and diarrhea. The only things we shared were the Rack House Mega Nachos and the Cheese Curds, so either one of those dishes made us all sick, or everything coming out of that kitchen that night made us sick.

I generally don&#39;t put up reviews because if I don&#39;t like the food at a restaurant, I just don&#39;t go back.

I was sad when the former place closed because it was one of those &#39;go to&#39; places that everyone could find something to eat. Rack House is similar in that it has BBQ, sandwiches, salads, wraps, and all other types of dishes that will please a wide range of taste buds.

The staff was very nice and the place seemed clean. The cheese curds are amazing and I might just order two of those and roll myself out next time I stop in for dinner. For my meal I ended up going with the grilled cheese and tomato soup as I just wasn&#39;t feeling a burger that day. The sandwich was pretty good and the fries were awesome, but the soup was strange and full of all sorts of &#39;things&#39;. Maybe veggies?

My boss and I went for lunch yesterday (4/16) and I ordered the Bahn Mi Sandwich (pork) with tater tots. When it arrived, I was surprised, as I was expecting the bread to be a toasted baguette of some sort- but it was on two slices of toasted white bread instead. Whatever, not a big deal. However, the pork itself was pounded so incredibly thin and was inedible, because it was so dry. I ended up just taking the pork off and making a veggie sandwich.

Food:

Good, but nothing to write home about.

Staff:

Not nearly as attentive as I expected in this type of place, especially considering the lunch crowd is 97% business professionals.

Atmosphere:

It was a little bit nicer than your neighborhood chain restaurant.


On a good note, the food did come out quickly and the order was completely correct, even though it was for 6 people and included our office&#39;s own &#34;When Harry Met Sally,&#34; everything-on-the-side person.

The slab consisted of ten meaty bones. The dinner includes jalapeo spiced cole slaw, walnut flavored corn bread and a baked potato. The latter is their standard side and they charge a dollar to substitute. Other places include two sides of your choice with their rib dinners.

In a word the ribs were mediocre. They were fairly tasty but it was a precooked and reheated kind of taste. The majority of the ribs were of the soft, fall off the bone variety; so much so that you needed to use a knife and fork if you didn&#39;t want to handle the meat with your hands. However the meat near one end of the slab was a little tough and dry.

There was little smoky, barbecue flavor. Very mild, almost bland tasting. This style might be more appealing to others than to me.

The cole slaw and corn bread were very good, the baked potato fair. I ordered the potato &#34;loaded&#34;, but I didn&#39;t taste any onions or bacon bits. The carry out service was good.",08/06/15,130,3,2,2,34,1.6286,1.022,0.11900000000000001,13.859000000000002,No,1040

When one of my friends was telling me about how much she loved diners and mentioned this as one of her favorites, I knew I had to give it a shot as I was driving by on a very hungry, empty stomach. I&#39;ve actually driven past this place many times -- it&#39;s an older brick building with a brown sign that doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside. Chin up and shoulders back, I walked in and asked for a table for one with a big smile. I was seated at a roomy booth in the middle of the restaurant.

My experience was probably completely different than everyone else&#39;s (or is it?). I was here on a weekday afternoon, a half hour before the place closed. Aside from two other men dining alone (one was sitting at the counter, talking very loudly into his cell phone), I was the only person eating in. Service was friendly, quick, and attentive -- even the food arrived super fast. Made sense, considering the circumstances.

Yet... my soup (cream of asparagus) arrived in an eye-popping large bowl. I had my own bread basket, filled with yumminess. My vegetable sandwich was huge -- and the fries were a perfect amount. Everything was gut-busting delicious!! As much as I wanted to, I couldn&#39;t eat it all. Half of the sandwich and fries came home with me for another tasty meal later. 

And... oh! The coffee creamers! I just started drinking coffee and pretty much won&#39;t drink it unless I can pour in some flavored creamer, mess around with it a bit until it&#39;s &#39;perfect&#39;, or pick up something from Starbucks. That said, when coffee is an option at most establishments, I won&#39;t order it because the typical half-and-half/creamer is gross. So.... imagine my delight when I saw the variety of little creamer cups in a bowl on my table! Whee! I ordered a coffee, used my creamer of choice, and was a happy Laura.

I paid my reasonable bill with a smile and was out the door with a Dum Dums lollipop.

I usually get my matzo ball soup from the Buffalo, which is the same type of concept, Greek, family-owned diner.

Well, I didn&#39;t go for matzo ball soup, but I did go for breakfast.  On Saturday, I was up WAY  too early (for a Saturday) and much to my surprise, the BF suggested we go out for breakfast (one of my favorite things, one of his least favorite things.)  I should&#39;ve known he had something up his sleeve.

We went to Caf Fourteen because he doesn&#39;t really care for any of the places within walking distance of our home, and because it was open early.

We were greeted immediately by who I can only presume is the owner, with a big smile and welcome.  The restaurant was not very crowded, maybe 3-4 other tables, but like I said, it was early. 

Our server was also very friendly and brought coffee/hot chocolate right away and let us peruse the menu.  I ordered the Mexican skillet and my boyfriend ordered the meat lover skillet.  We also ordered a side of the corned beef hash to share, because I had asked the server if it was homemade and she said &#34;no, but it is very good.&#34;  I&#39;m pretty picky about my CBH, and the other half insisted we try it.

We both enjoyed our breakfasts.  The eggs (over easy) were perfectly cooked, and my skillet was full of bold flavor, especially the jalapenos.  Everything went very well together.

I can see myself coming back to Caf Fourteen over and over again for breakfast.  And the fact that we found a place where we BOTH enjoyed breakfast?  Now that&#39;s an accomplishment.

Two thumbs up for Caf Fourteen!",03/06/14,195,4,2,5,33,6.4990000000000006,3.153,0.099,15.747999999999998,No,1735

This place is also good for breakfast, big portions and so far everything I ordered has been good.  I will suggest the French Toast.

cafe-fourteen-palatine,Gerry A.,OHH18hww_n6etjhWmHrd7A,wqHp8mqPK4x8dN1d1l7nrg,"Here are two excellent reasons to pass Cafe Fourteen by for lunch.
Grammy D&#39;s a little south on the other side of Route 14 and The Red Apple on Plum Grove Rd about 5 minutes south. Both cheaper and better. 

This is a lunch review, NOT a breakfast review.
The buzz I heard on Cafe Fourteen was that it was a Greek diner. NOTHING Greek on the menu that I could find for lunch, certainly not Moussaka, or Spanakopita, etc. There may have been somebody Greek in the kitchen slicing the turkey so thin that I could barely find it in my turkey sandwich underneath the obviously plastic wrapped thin swiss cheese.  The Manhattan soup was ok, but the fruit substituted for fries was not ripe except for the pineapple. So a couple of pieces of pineapple were the best part of my lunch, that and the plastic wrapped sesame breadsticks in a very boring breadbasket made up of plastic wrapped saltines and two pieces of loaf Italian bread. Oopa!

Pretty obviously an old Big Boy or something, and THAT is what I was hungry for after I had a very forgettable lunch here.  This is more of a Denny&#39;s that closes at 2:30; they are just making soup and sandwiches here on top of the breakfast menu.
I did get kind of a sour smile from the hostess when I requested a different booth, that might have been a Greek smile. I realize this is not going to be popular with the obviously local beakfast crowd reviews here but I didn&#39;t get any owner chatting me up he left early too, they were ready to close at 2:30 and it was a below average diner lunch.

Grammy D&#39;s is open until 2:30 and I would NEVER try going in there at 2:25, but Red Apple will serve you if you come in at 3:00. I almost got my check faster than my food at Cafe Fourteen at 2:30, they were ready to go, the sign says 3.

I will not complain about the location of our booth, directly next to the dirty dishes they were busing off the busy, crowded tables nor will I complain about the incredibly rude table of 7 that was directly next to us, as you can&#39;t control the morons of the world.

What I WILL do is say that the food was quite good.  I ordered a steak skillet &amp; he ordered the hungry man skillet.  We were both pleased, though we agreed the portions of the skillets were only a touch smaller than expected for the price.  The pancakes were fluffy and served w/ plenty of butter &amp; syrup.  The coffee was good diner coffee and was constantly flowing, which is CRUCIAL in my world.

I will also commend our waitress, MELISSA, for being an amazingly attentive server who made sure she took care of us as best she could, even though she couldn&#39;t easily get to our table.  (That rude party of 7 refused to scoot their chairs in so she could pass behind them, no matter how many times she asked.)

Inexpensive mexican food is a huge plus at this location. I had the steak chimichanga which has ample amount of beef. The dinner comes with rice, beans, and some gauc/sour cream which usually cost more at other restaurants. Service is fast and made to order. You can order carry out to save on tips, but you miss out on the free salsa and chips. Overall a step up from Taco Bell.

Honestly, we find it rather hard to find a Mexican restaurant (take out) that uses fresh ingredients, and it always taste the same! You are never left wondering, umm, that was not as good as I originally thought. 

With that being said, we&#39;ve never been disappointed! Very large serving sizes. The tacos are filled to the top of the shell. Burritos are what we call &#34;super sized&#34;. Super tasty, loaded with meat of your choice and variety of toppings. 
Tamales are always very fresh and tasty. 
Loaded nachos are seriously loaded to the top of the box! So many toppings, you cannot even see the chips. Box weighs almost five pounds. I kid you not. 

We usually get take-out, but have stopped in to eat, and experienced the same wonderful service as we do when getting take-out. When eating in, you are served chips and two types of salsa. 
Average wait time for food is 10-15 mins (if that)
Menu has a very large selection, and priced just right. Especially for the amount of food you receive.

I haven&#39;t been in the area long enough to know what this building was before TP, but I&#39;m speculating that it was a Taco Bell, right down to the booths.  I came in expecting to order at the counter, but I was told by an employee to have a seat and she would serve me.  Okay, cool.

I was greeted with chips, salsa, and a smile.  I decide to order the 3 taco dinner: I chose 3 different meats: chicken, beef, and pork.  The dinner also comes with beans, rice, and guacamole.  The chips and salsa were fresh and tasty, and assisted with my wait for my food (which was about 10 minutes).  I also enjoyed some silly Spanish-speaking soap opera on Univision.  I am not as fluent as I&#39;d like to be in Spanish, so most of the dialogue was lost on me.  I could only understand the doorbell ringing and someone&#39;s mother laughing.

The tacos were very good, with tender meat.  And also very filling.  I also ordered a cola (I forgot whether it was Pepsi or Coke) with my meal, and I neglected to ask about refills.  As such, I was charged for 2 drinks since I got 2 refills (you only get one refill for free).  So that was my boo-boo.

We&#39;re seriously considering finding another tacqueria as our latest experiences at Taco Patio have been disappointing, largely because of the inconsistency of the quality of the food. Sometimes the guacamole looks old and sometimes it&#39;s very sour. Sometimes the meat will be tender and sometimes it looks dry. Sometimes they put a lot of rice in the taco meal and sometimes there&#39;s barely any. I don&#39;t get it. 

About the only thing that is consistent is the staleness of the chips. Perhaps it&#39;s because they put the chips in the same container as the tacos, thus steaming the chips with the heat from the tacos. The chips should really come separately anyways.

The GPS (Love Her, Hate Her, but still better than than the days of printing out maps and pulling over to boot the slow laptop and fire up the map program) listed Taco Patio so I said why not?

Very clean, excellent service. I got a carne asada taco and chips and salsa. The chips were very good, not greasy at all and I really liked the salsa. I didn&#39;t care at all for the red and green sauce in the bottles.

The taco was good, not spectacular, but very big for a single taco, with two corn tortillas - I ended up only eating around half with the fork that was thoughtfully provided.

I ordered a dinner set that included a taco, quesadilla, and tamale.
Taco was stuffed with a generous amount of well marinated pastor.  The quesadilla, although tasty, was kinda a lazy version.  It was literally just cheese melted between two tortillas.  It didn&#39;t have that crispy exterior one comes to expect form a quesadilla.  I generally don&#39;t like tamales; but this is definitely one of the better ones I&#39;ve ever eaten. 

The order can with a small cup of guac, and generous amounts of salsa.  Unfortunately they only had &#34;green&#39; salsa.  I tend to like &#34;red&#34; more.  Sorry, I know those aren&#39;t the official names; but you know what I mean.  

The place is good, cheap, and rather clean as well.  I&#39;ll def be back for more.

Was around 10 pm on a Friday night and every place is closed...what is the deal with suburban eateries closing so early? Don&#39;t people eat after 9 pm? Anyways, Taco Patio was open and I was wanting a taco so it seemed like a match made in heaven.

Got 2 orders of taco meals to go. Both were chicken, mine was with cilantro and onion and my boyfriends had cheese, lettuce and tomato. The meal also came with rice &amp; beans and a small drink.

Honestly, I&#39;ve had better. I was really hoping for nice, flavorful and juicy pieces of chicken. The chicken was pretty dry and didn&#39;t have any memorable flavor. The rice seemed a bit dry too. Again, it was late at night and I was starving so it really didn&#39;t bother me. My bf mentioned that they must have had an off night because he&#39;s eaten there before and said it was much better before.

I guess if I am craving a taco at 10 pm, I will head back.

The Kitchen Sink! This dessert item alone bumps up my ratings from 3 to 4 stars for the food. Where else can you get two whole bananas, two scoops of vanilla, two scoops of chocolate &amp; two scoops of strawberry. Topped with chocolate, strawberry, and pineapple toppings, covered with whipped cream, chopped almonds &amp; a cherry.  After you finish you get a bumper sticker saying you ate the kitchen sink! This is great for 2 people to share or more if you are okay sharing saliva, but the visual appeal of this dessert is amazing. You can&#39;t go wrong with the other dessert items either like the turtle sundae or brownie with ice cream. The actual food here is only average. I ended up with the pot roast and mash potatoes which tasted like food from a cafeteria. Servers are friendly. Maybe next time I should try the burgers or sandwiches.

Pro- great dessert items, the kitchen sink :)

OK, not all. TONS of choices, but if it has peanut butter in it, all the better. Never had the nerve to order the Kitchen Sink, saving that one for the bucket list. Other items served in appropriate ice cream parlor style glassware, not plastic bowls or cups (mentioning this for those used to fast-food joint ice cream). Always had good service, quick and accurate. Priced as you&#39;d expect.

colonial-cafe-elgin-3,Paul S.,lRHUkES8HnFAqdoi4hwNkg,XH3g_F_Su0Howjj3WPvrng,"Apparently this care has been a staple of the community for over a half-century. Known mostly for their ice cream and shakes, they have every variety known to man. Seriously, they have a four page menu dedicated just to the sweets. If you need a serious sugar rush, you might want to check them out. For $14 they serve you mounds of ice cream in a miniature stainless steel device shaped and aptly named &#34;The Kitchen Sink&#34;.

As ice cream was not on my mind early in the morning, fish tacos were the order of the day. They are served either with white fish or talapia tacos. There&#39;s about a dozen sides that you can choose from. I opted for the southern style green beans with bacon.

The girl who was serving us was pleasant enough, but had what appeared to be bad habit of which she was unaware. When taking our orders and checking up on us, she would still be talking to us as she was walking away, almost like she was in a hurry to get away from people. As a a waitress, hospitality is the name of the game. Perhaps she has a bit of social anxiety, but it was odd behavior to witness. The place was anything but busy, so rushing away really was uncalled for.

As for the food, the Cabo tacos were spicy, but not unbearable. The fish was cooked well-done in a fryer and were breaded, but not overly doughy. The paired green beans were really overcooked and were mushy. Hardly anything better than you can get out of a can, which isn&#39;t saying much. A friend ordered the Strawberry French Toast which quite tasty per her.

In all, it wasn&#39;t a bad place to nibble on the offerings, just that it wasn&#39;t anything spectacular either.",08/06/12,187,3,2,2,20,1.5621,1.4079999999999997,0.714,17.879,No,1653

It&#39;s actually one of my favorite breakfast spots. My favorite meal (which I try not to order because I feel overly stuffed for the next 5 hours) is the country sausage skillet without cheese. It&#39;s really good and I also get the morning glory muffin to add a little sweetness with the meal. 

My fiance orders chicken and waffles and it is also amazing! The chicken alone is delicious, so I would also recommend the chicken fingers. I&#39;ve also eaten at Colonial for lunch and the salads I have tried have all been great.

colonial-cafe-elgin-3,Wes P.,#NAME?,Qy0bQz9MOwoZaDaFnaw00g,"Everyone, 

My own imposed rules for any review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Must order something unique each visit.
3. If they have any &#34;signature&#34; items on the menu, you must order a &#34;signature&#34; item at least once.
4. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Colonial Cafe - Elgin

Location/Layout - 6/10:  Located just south of Route 20 on the Northwest corner of McLean Blvd and Spartan Dr (the ECC entrance).  The building is unmistakable if you are familiar with Colonial and resembles the iconic images found all over their branding.  The interior has been updated recently which includes a very vibrant color scheme and lighting.  I personally preferred the older scheme with the beiges and maroons along with the old time imagery of farms and creameries but no matter the interior design the restaurant is always clean and usually organized.  

Menu - 7/10:  The breakfast, lunch and dinner menu is standard diner fare.  To Colonial&#39;s credit they always have seasonal offerings and chef&#39;s specials, which gives regulars and new comers some variety.  Additionally, and more importantly in my opinion, Colonial offers a stand alone ice cream menu since this is what the company was founded on.  You will find classics including a black cow, floats, and sundaes but also unique takes on custom creations such as my personal favorite the PBF chipper, the ET and the iconic Kitchen Sink. 

Service - 6.5/10: The service is usually very friendly and accommodating.  We are always greeted with a smile and treated very well throughout our meals, even if it is just dessert.  Refills and requests are filed in expedited fashion.  The lone issue we ever encounter is that we have waited to be seated while servers past us by at the greeting booth and we have had to wait to check out, since you pay up front.  Both minor annoyances but they still exist.  

Food - 6.5/10:  The standard menu options vary greatly.  The breakfast items, which are served all day, seem to be the most consistent and all are very solid options.  Some sandwich options are delicious such as any of the Turkey options but the Pot Roast dip which is a signature item needs work and leaves a tinny flavor (maybe canned au jus) in your mouth for quite some time.  Their comfort classics, which are their dinners, are all fairly good especially the turkey dinner, with the exception again being the pot roast.  Where Colonial truly excels is their ice cream creations.  They are always created unique for each guest, meaning that you can call your ice cream flavors and add/delete or amend any toppings.  The options are almost too many as it creates too much indecision on which decadent treat to choose.  My suggestion is that you must at least once in your life try a Kitchen Sink; if for no other reason then seeing this creation sitting at your table and watching the jealous on lookers around you.  Plus you will earn the coveted bumper stinker that allows you to proclaim to the world that you ate enough calories for an entire week and enough sugar to send a diabetic into shock.  Prices are very reasonable, but the desserts can get pricey if you indulge too heavily but it is a treat after all.     

Drinks - 6.5/10:  Colonial offers the standard soft drink options that one is accustomed too from a diner including coffees, teas, and juices (some locations also offer beer).  While these go well with most standard menu options, I typically like a hand dipped shake which always comes with a little extra in the shaker.

Overall Experience - 7/10:  Colonial is a Fox Valley tradition.  It is a family friendly diner that offers enough options to keep the entire family or group happy.  We used to hit this place up in droves back in little league then high school and also while attending ECC.  We still continue to see church groups, teams, and organizations meet here regularly.  I highly suggest that you come for the ice cream but get a bite while you are here.",06/04/13,476,4,3,5,70,7.845500000000001,4.686000000000002,0.976,32.338,No,4236

My friend and I headed here on a Wednesday to try and see what kind of trouble we could get into.  As it turns out, a lot :)

Our waitress, Allison, was super sweet and helpful!  She didn&#39;t even laugh at me when she saw me looking at the dessert menu before the dinner one!

I ordered the Meatloaf (substituting fries for mashed potatoes) and a side of broccoli, and my friend ordered the CA Turkey Grill.  We both LOVED our meals.  They were not only ready five minutes after we ordered, but they were delicious and there was plenty of food to go around.  They don&#39;t skimp on their portions here!  

Every bite of my meatloaf had either a green pepper or an onion in it, which I loved.  It was chocked full of ingrdients and flavor, and there were three cute little loaves of it.  It was great!  I sampled my friend&#39;s sandwich, and that was delicious as well.

As good as the food was, though, the desserts were that much better.  I mean, I will come back for the food, but I am definitely coming here for the desserts.  We ordered the PB Chipper and the Caramel Pecan Cinful Pie.  Both of them were a.ma.zing. Allison was nice enough to let me substitute Peanut Butter chocolate ice cream for the regular chocolate in the PB Chipper, and it just made it all that much better!  And the Cinful Pie was great as well--flaky crust covered in caramel?  Yes, please!!

I will definitely be back--maybe even for breakfast since they had a cinnamon roll french toast that looked amazing!  But I, of course, will still be ordering dessert!",01/09/11,196,5,3,5,81,8.7187,5.634,0.49600000000000005,15.870000000000001,No,1714

It slightly amazes me that a place that more or less advertises itself as an ice cream shop, has such an amazing item on their breakfast menu.  My wife and I are big fans of pumpkin pancakes when restaurants start serving them in the fall.  Colonial, hands down, has the best we have tried.  It isn&#39;t even close.  Do yourself a favour and the next time you are in, order up the pumpkin pancake combo and see for yourself!

As for the rest of the food, some things are pretty good, others things I would avoid.  The Ranchero Carnitas Omelette is very good, as is the Monterrey Omelette.  I tried the pot roast one night.  Nope, won&#39;t be doing that again.  More or less, this is our go to place when I want breakfast for dinner (and really, is there anything better than breakfast for dinner??!!!).  Why?

Very little cheese, much of which was not melted &amp; what was seemed coagulated from being cold.  The chili on top appeared to have been microwaved mutliple times and had hardly any meat, just a little sauce over the chips, so that none of the chips on the bottom had anything on them.

colonial-cafe-elgin-3,Kate K.,WI9UJah3bVB258wzEIh34A,5_0GEd_gK45fQK9sR7hBJQ,"A trip down memory lane...

Just for reference, I was born in Elgin, Illinois and lived there until I was 11 years old.  At that time my family moved to Kent, Ohio where I lived until I was in my mid-twenties...  I remember very little about Elgin... except things connected with my family: Pot-luck dinners at a church, going for a bike ride in a particularly big park, my brother&#39;s endless little-league games, my uncles taking me to the municipal swimming pool... and, spending time with my grandpa.

Grandpa Jim.

I am the oldest of 21 grandchildren.  I think that&#39;s right.  And, now there are a few great-grandchildren thrown in there too... the count for baby-boom off spring might be up to at least 25.

Being the oldest grandchild and the only girl for something like seven years until my cousin Lori came along... I was just a touch spoiled as a child.  Imagine.  I was my uncles and my grandpa&#39;s angel-baby-girl... I was the little strawberry-blond princess of the Doyle clan... I was special.

Oh yes.

Saturdays were my Grandpa days: He used to take me to Lord&#39;s Park to see Big Jim the Buffalo.  That&#39;s right, they had a buffalo at a park in Elgin, Illinois - random, right?  Anyhow - I think my grandpa felt some kinship of some sort with Big Jim the Buffalo, because it was one of his favorite things to do... they were both big, lumbering and quiet.  I remember wondering if they named that buffalo after my grandpa.  After we sat there for a while Grandpa Jim would take me to Colonial Cafe for a Turtle Sundae.

I remember sitting in my grandpa&#39;s lap and running my fingers along the outline of the tattoo on the inside of his forearm: a heart, almost exactly like the one I have on my left shoulder, with the name &#34;Ruth&#34; in the banner - he got it during the war while stationed in Korea.  Ruth being my grandma.  I remember the smell of his Lucky Strike filter-less cigarettes mixing with his Old Spice aftershave... he had this leather chair that was &#34;his&#34; chair and sometimes when he wasn&#39;t home I&#39;d just curl up in that chair because it smelled like him... Grandpa.

I actually spent a lot of time at my grandparent&#39;s house as a young kid due to the fact that my mom was putting her self through graduate school with two small children to support... 890 West Chicago Street was like a second home to me - more familiar and comfortable than my own, at times.

Grandpa Jim was a big hulking man and never much of a talker - he still isn&#39;t in fact.  I think that the combination of war and alcohol kind of made him introverted and not exactly the most accessible person.  Those times with the buffalo and the ice cream are the only times I really ever remember connecting with him; though, I know that I was (and, am) the apple of his eye.

Big hulking man with little strawberry blond child sitting on a bench watching a buffalo.

Today I had a chance to go hang out with my Grandpa: time has changed him immensely - he is old and fragile and quieter than he even was the last time I saw him... he doesn&#39;t talk except about the Chicago Cubs and occasionally about politics (during which time - he being the staunch Republican and me being the child of his liberal-hippie daughter - I tend to just smile and nod...)  I would have taken him to see Big Jim the Buffalo - yet, sadly Big Jim died a couple of years back (which I know because my cousin Lori told me that Grandpa mentioned it to her and called her &#34;Katie&#34; when she took him out to Sunday lunch.)  Instead I just took him to Colonial Cafe which is as much a part of my memories of him as anything else.

In the twenty-two some odd years since the last time I was there, Colonial hasn&#39;t changed a bit.  It&#39;s still a greasy-spoon diner with bad patty melts and malts and sundaes.

Was looking forward to trying this place out since it&#39;s new and had good reviews so far.  Came in for lunch and we ordered a vegetarian burrito and the taco platter with rice and beans.  The rice was quite flavorful with a great deep orange color, unfortunately it was a little dry, but no different than the vast majority of Mexican restaurants.

The tacos were fine, pretty flavorful and a good enough portion size for a lunch meal.  No cheese on the tacos, which I prefer, but it did come with lime and salsa.  On the salsa side, the salsa verde was pretty good, but the salsa roja was terribly overpowered with an almost dry chili powder flavor.  The meat was well seasoned, but the steak was a little overcooked and chewy, and the chicken was dry. The vegetarian burrito was less well received.  My dining partner said that it contained a number of uncooked vegetables, and wasn&#39;t particularly tasty.

The location itself was pretty nice, clean and a little larger than I expected.  The staff was very nice, and I always appreciate when they give you the choice between traditional cilantro and onion or lettuce and tomato.  

All in all, it&#39;s a decent, quick Mexican restaurant.  It&#39;s not quite as cheap as a few places out by Hanover Park, or as good as some of the less fast-foody places in the area, but it works if you&#39;re looking for something close by.",17/06/16,158,3,3,3,76,2.7191,1.9609999999999999,0.41000000000000003,11.629000000000001,No,1414

It&#39;s a cute little cafe type place with French music playing in the background.  I ordered what looked like a calzone but it had a different name I cannot remember.  It was fresh and oozing with cheese and spinach.  I also ordered the iced vanilla with caramel coffee....I wanted another.  I also ordered the yummy brownie with what seemed to be cream cheese swirled into it.  Yum!  Not a huge menu of choices but a nice selection nonetheless.  With the friends we came with I also got to sample the breakfast pizza and the TMC which I will be ordering next time I go back.  
All exceptional food and like that it&#39;s all prepared in house.  Definitely worth a stop in, you won&#39;t be disappointed.  I do have to add...I liked the seating outside and that is was kid and dog friendly.  Being a huge dog owner I loved the welcoming of dogs and that they had water bowls set up outside.

In the old part of town in East Dundee this place offers fresh pastries along w/ a small menu for breakfest and lunch.  As I showed up in the morning and the only customer I ordered the breakfest quiche (3 different choices), mine had ham, green peppers, onions, and cheese.  You can tell this wasnt there first time around making one.  It was very tasty!  Crust was right on perfect w/ flavor and perfectly cooked.  Then I had to try a peanut butter cookie and it was really good, kinda expensive cookie for a dollar.  I guess...I definitely fell in love w/ the huge dish of bread pudding that they offered but I figured I&#39;d save that for when I come back for lunch!  I was tempted just to ask how much for that whole dish, but then I figured it was summertime and that wouldnt be good for the abs.  :)  Wait staff was super duper nice as well.

There&#39;s a case of baked goods that is full of diet ruination, but you can tell yourself you&#39;re going to have the quiche or the homemade Chicken and Dumpling soup and then fall into your planned temptation once there&#39;s no escape.  There&#39;s a chalkboard on the wall that lists all the pies owner, Arlene has made, but she takes requests, even if there&#39;s no recipe involved.  Every day she bakes a couple of pies, full and individual sized and fills the rest of the bakery case with treats that will make you mumble, OMG through a sweet-filled mouth.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, there is nothing on the menu that isn&#39;t great.

I go at least once a week to various ones in the NW burbs.  I&#39;d give the chain in general 5 stars... but this particular location over two separate visits has proven to be crap.  

My wife and I went a year and a half ago when she was pregnant.  My wife was being careful of what she ate over concern for the baby, and so she asked if they could cook the steak a little longer for her just to heat it up and make extra sure of killing salmonela (sp?) etc.  it was mid afternoon and there were maybe 1 or 2 other people in the joint.  The lady serving said no with attitude.  My wife isn&#39;t fond of confrontation, so she didn&#39;t say anything at the time and we went home.  After the 5 minute car ride, we got home, opened up, and ate... and discovered the steak we both got was actually lukewarm or colder.  My wife tossed hers because she was already angry over the experience.  I ate mine, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as enjoyable as usual.

fast forward a year or two later and i went there with my mom when she was visiting.  This time we went at about 7pm on a weekday.  The only thing we asked for this time was extra rice and some extra meat (was feeling particularly hungry, and sometimes they give you some extra).  Server lady was stand offish again (can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s the same one), and gave smaller than normal portions of rice and steak.  Again, the steak managed to be slightly cold.  

Morale of the story - skip this chipotle, skip it good.  drive the extra 5 minutes to the one at barrington &amp; schaumburg rd., or on golf &amp; roselle.

management needs to clean house or infuse a new attitude.  and keep their food warmer.",24/01/14,197,1,1,1,-11,0.30879999999999996,2.4970000000000003,1.121,18.382,No,1730

So, far, it pretty much matches the service and quality that the one in Schaumburg provides.  I usually get take-out there, but it&#39;s decor is about the same as the one in Schaumburg, just newer.

I&#39;m always happy with the Chipotle quality of food with every Chipotle I go too.   Only a few times has the chicken/steak been kinda cold/sitting there for a while, but that was more in the beginning.  

Nowadays, I have seen it improve and the people there are always so friendly and the service is quick.

We frequent this Chipotle more often now than the Schaumburg one because it is a more direct route and closer. :)",13/07/09,68,5,2,3,11,2.3589,1.6280000000000001,0.0,5.372,No,715

I highly recommend their steak, as they cook it until it&#39;s still a little red inside. Portions are enormous - I could easily make two meals out of their rice bowl, but it&#39;s always a struggle to not keep shoveling the food into my mouth because it&#39;s so tasty. 

The service at this location is great, too. People always come around and ask if everything&#39;s okay about halfway through my meal. The only thing I would mention is that their chips tend to be overly salted, so ask for them unsalted or lightly salted, if you&#39;re watching your sodium intake.

Oh yeah, and drop your card in. My friend won take-out for 10 people (including chips and drinks) just the other day. It gave me a chance to &#34;splurge&#34; and try my steak rice bowl with extra guacamole - really good idea, btw, in case you&#39;re wondering.",30/04/11,105,5,2,4,33,3.0475,1.767,0.316,6.917999999999999,No,917

The beer selection was okay, however, compared to competitors such as Yard House, which also offers a extensive selection of craft beer, the beer selection could improve. The sours and Imperial IPA offering was very limited.  Regarding the food, I can only speak to the Duck Confit Nachos. The duck was rather plain, however, it was accompanied by a variety of fresh complimentary ingredients. I have to rave about the house pickled jalapeos, which in my opinion was &#34;the&#34; accent to the dish. The cheese sauce fell far from expectations and resembled a simple roux. It needs more character.  If a second visit is merited I&#39;d probably stick with their signature burger per the description. Let&#39;s only hope it executes well.

old-town-pour-house-naperville,Scott G.,rBnYlivHX85pATmPfb8Frw,sfPJMih8rkbgXS6ZoEUrXA,"First time visit to newly hyped restaurant Pour House - menu reads amazing online and reviews were great .... here&#39;s our assessment, but only in our opinions as foodies, as there were both positives and negatives, but hoping they work out their kinks.  

The Positives
- Beautiful indoor and outdoor space
- Attentive servers
- The meatloaf is some of the best around, flavorful and cooked very well, and great red eye gravy

The NOT-so Positives
- Incredibly slow bar service - us, as well as several tables we could hear around us had issues with beverages arriving.  One table had their 2nd drink arriving after they finished meal and obviously no longer wanted it, with server suggesting it could be &#34;dessert&#34;.
- Drink inconsistency - ordered signature Cucumber melon martini - first 2 arrived green, last arrived red with server stating &#34;it was a different bartender&#34;.  If it&#39;s one of their signature cocktails on the menu, shouldn&#39;t *all* the bartenders know how to make the same signature drink?
- Fried Pickles - too salty, especially w/ salty ranch dressing and very greasy - soaked up the extra grease of one piece that saturated a cocktail napkin
- Short-rib Dinner - $24 dinner which is one of the most expensive on the menu, mine arrived as literally 95% gristle, side of grits were incredibly bland and tasteless and gritty (not in the good way), shrimps were straight out of a grocery store pre-cooked fish department, with zero seasoning or flavor.
- Meatloaf side dishes - supposed to be Yukon Gold, but clearly russets as they were as white as rice, dry and a bit musty in flavor, carrot/pea side had way undercooked carrots to the point they were almost raw.
- Portions - seem to be the right size unless you need to take home leftovers, but their plating eludes to the fact you are getting appetizer sized portions on enormous plates.

In the end, I am not one to want to send food back and this was probably only the 2nd time I&#39;ve done so, but the shortrib dinner was just incredibly awful.  The manager was nice enough to comp the shortrib meal in looking at it and realizing it was &#34;not their standard&#34;, but assured us the &#34;Executive Chef and two sous chefs&#34; hold the highest of standards - may have been easier to believe had he tucked in his dress shirt and wore big boy shoes and not gym shoes.

I did ask my fiance after she got the water if she really wanted it. She said no I like having pizza without anything to wash it down (sarcasm font).

I was a server for years and was able to make a good wage doing it. I wonder how this girl survives let alone takes orders and has a job. 

Weird thing. She disappeared for at least 10 minutes when we were ready for a refill. Had an awkward encounter when I got up to go to the bar to get refills, fresh drinks in hand and low and behold she graced us with her presence at the table. I had to pardon myself because I was thirsty.

Sadly, an up charge of $2 on a 9&#34; pizza turned me off, especially since it turned out to taste &#34;cardboardy.&#34; Being gluten intolerant, I feel that it&#39;s wrong to charge me that much for one meal. Basically a 20% surcharge. I know GF ingredients cost more, but they don&#39;t cost THAT much more. We don&#39;t charge diabetics more for sugarfree, even though SF substitutes cost more than sugar, so why is this practice acceptable?

Hubby chose the buffet and asked, &#34;Will there be any cheese pizza?&#34; And his answer was, &#34;Nope,&#34; and she walked off. 

No &#34;cheese&#34; pizza on a pizza buffet??? Seems odd.

There was a party with screaming kids, kids running everywhere, it took 45 minutes to get our order.  No one explained to us that there was a delay in the kitchen so we sat making paper spit balls while our anxiety reached peak levels listening to the lunatic kids running around screaming like banshees.  We had our two kids with and it was even getting on their nerves.  After hunting down the server and actually getting up to leave a manger rushed over.  She apologized, and our pizza was brought out soon after.  It wasn&#39;t well done as we had ordered but my kids were starving so they ate it.  I was so aggravated that I lost my appetite and didn&#39;t even want to eat at that point.  Very poor customer service.  I understand if you have a big party to cook for but the servers should be explains ahead of time there would be a delay.

They also had something that looked like hashbrowns covered in cheese...also cold. Lastly, the salad area didn&#39;t offer anything low cal and the lettuce was turning brown.

They are down the street from Fisher nuts. I&#39;m sure there isn&#39;t much of a cost to them! 

Second thing I noticed, was again about the peanuts! I watched the bus boy clean a table and bring a half full basket of peanuts back to the hostess!! Never dumped them just placed them back on the shelf to be given out again!! How unsanitary is that? What if someone sneezed on the basket? It is not right!! 

Third thing I noticed, was the lack of service and then pushiness of the server. We waited 10 minutes for her to come to the table and ask for out drink orders and wanted our good order right away when we weren&#39;t ready yet.

First, you walk through a big heavy door, probably to work off all that pizza. ;) Then you can either go into the bar area or ask to be seated by the host in the restaurant. The host was so kind and helpful! My group came in at different times and she directed all of them right to our table. Also, we had a lovely waitress. Even though we could tell she was busy, she made it a point to take time to come check on us every few minutes.
 Also, we learned that this place has food runners, also known as the carry out workers, which is why the server doesn&#39;t bring the food out all the time. *** Smart idea if you ask me because then the servers have more time with the tables. ***
Finally, once the children in my family arrived, they went straight to the game room. It was nice because we had gotten a seat right near the game room to watch the children. They had a blast! Also the place is decorated with animals which became a great learning tool for the kids to learn about different animals. Plus, the kids loved the coloring sheets and the fish tank. 
The pizza is incredible and the double decker is my favorite and unlike anything I have had before! Plus, you can throw peanut shells on the floor and not have to clean up the mess! But beware if you have an allergy.
 Village Pizza is incredible and if anyone wants to have a great night out with family, please come here. I will definitely be back!!!

However if someone in the group did not want pizza they we&#39;re only allowed to opt out on the pizza if they said they had food allergies. So our people who were not pizza lovers had to say that they had food allergies in order to get a beef sandwich.

Taxidermy aside (try not to look...) this is a total family joint! I love VP/P. They have individual pizzas for really cheap (perfect for pick up at work) and the pizza buffet is a steal. Reeally, they could charge a buck more. 

Yesterday I had a speed bump in my enjoyment of VP/P; I had the cheesy beef. It was chewy (the beef, not the cheese) as if it was old, and dry, not wet at all. I probably should have requested extra wet w/ peppers or something, but that would not have changed the non-tenderness of the meat. Not their specialty. 

As a sidenote for gluten-free folks. They have gluten-free crusts which are really good and crispy. You pay a little more, but oh, so good.

village-pizza-and-pub-elgin,Jim P.,slP7QsJsGYSHmR9SkmMOqQ,lDkFzhSPjpGiNzcD1a8_cw,"Village Pizza &amp; Pub has been a staple in my diet since I met my wife. She grew up in Carpentersville home of the original Village Pizza. I even know all the sordid details of the fighting between Nick and Mr. Village or...whatever....maybe I&#39;m not so clear on the details. This &#34;new&#34; Village is a quick 20 minute drive down 90 for us and we go to meet up with the in-laws every so often and enjoy the insanity that is Village Pizza.

First of all there are peanuts EVERYWHERE. You will be covered in peanut dust by the time you leave. If you were planning on visiting someone allergic to peanuts after your meal you might want to change clothes first. Or get in one of those portable Outbreak sanitation units. Then there is the taxidermy on the walls. Now, I&#39;m not a fan of hunting or anything, but I believe the place is meant to look like a hunting lodge. Why it&#39;s not called The Lodge Pizza &amp; Pub is beyond me. It doesn&#39;t bother me that I&#39;m sitting underneath Bambi&#39;s mom while eating fried cheese sticks, but maybe it will bother you. 

Now the pizza, I have only ever had what they call &#34;double decker&#34; pizza. For years I wondered why it was called double decker when it seemed like a thin crust with a braided edge. Last night I decided to really study a slice and yes it does appear that there are 2 thin crusts braided together in this pizza. However don&#39;t expect anything close to a pan pizza or what I refer to as &#34;double dough&#34;. Double decker is a whole different beast. The pizza is good, lots of cheese, toppings are well and evenly distributed, and while I don&#39;t normally think about pizza sauce on anything but a Chicago style pizza, the sauce here is really tasty. 

Service is usually pretty good. The worst its ever been is having to wait for the check to be dropped off and just when I reached the boiling point the waitress showed up. Last night we went with a very large group and I think we were taken care of very well.

There were about 5 tables occupied when we were seated. The server was very friendly and seated us promptly.

We waited and waited and waited for our food. I thought they actually went to Italy to make our pizza. This was very frustrating because my wife was very hungry and it seemed like an eternity.

Finally, the pizza came and was hot. But, after closer inspection part of the dough was not even cooked. There was still flour covering part of the dough. I mean it&#39;s just pizza - how can you screw that up?!

It was cold in the place, as it seemed like they turned the heat off. This was not a deal breaker but the quality of the food was not what I would expect.

We were taken here with a group of 12 people and told the Pizza was amazing. The place is a giant log cabin with TV&#39;s, fish tanks, big party rooms and video games. Free peanuts are on the table and on the floor. The shells are everywhere. 

They ordered 4 of the Village mixes which includes Poppers, Mushrooms, Zucchini, Onion Rings, Cheese Sticks, w/Choice of
any two Sauces: Red, Ranch or Cheddar Cheese. We ordered house salads and 6 pizza&#39;s including cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and vegetable. 

The Village mix is all frozen and then deep fried. Heavy batter and tasteless. They cook it till it&#39;s hard as a rock on the outside and then mushy on the inside. The salad&#39;s we&#39;re obviously pre-made and sitting in the fridge all day. Mushy and some parts brown. Inedible.

So we figured the pizza is the main attraction. Think again. All of them came out cold with canned toppings. The Sauce and Mozzarella cheese sickening . Sauce out of a can and cheese that was stringy, tasteless and from a giant package. The dough itself tastes like cardboard.

First thing, the Yelp map is wrong, this is about a half mile north of I-90 on Randall on the west side of the road.

It&#39;s a log building design; there&#39;s a big fish tank in the entryway.  With mounted animal heads and antlers inside, it&#39;s reminiscent of Nicks which is south of here a few miles.  In fact, you rather feel like you&#39;re in &#34;Nick&#39;s North&#34; but it&#39;s not so over-the-top with the animals as Nick&#39;s is.  We did inquire about this while waiting for our appetizer and found it indeed is the same family, but there&#39;s no other connection.

So on to the food.  ICE-COLD BEER in frosted mugs started things off right.  We ordered cheese-bread as we were quite hungry and the menu advised a 20 minute wait for pizza.  The bread was excellent and had a great flavor.

We ordered the 14&#34; thin crust pizza, Canadian bacon with black olives and mushrooms.  When the pizza arrived and we had our first bite, we decided we may not return to Nick&#39;s again--this was a much better pizza!  It had a nice sauce with some deeper notes, great crust, nice amount of toppings.

Neither Village Pizza or Nick&#39;s will be known for being the best value around; indeed, with their largest pizza at 14&#34;, that&#39;s a rather scrawny size these days and only serves two hungry people.

My drink glass never got empty before she had a refill there.  The pizza was good.  No complaints.  The interior of the restaurant itself is a bit austere.  A few stuffed animal heads here and there, which I personally find unappealing in a restaurant.  There&#39;s something strangely nausiating about seeing half of a dead animal carcass hanging over my table while eating.  No other decor for the most part.  There&#39;s just something missing there in terms of ambiance.  Doesn&#39;t affect the quality of the meal itself, but yet the place itself is generally boring after about 5 minutes.  

This is indeed a copycat of Nick&#39;s Pizza up in Crystal Lake (and other locations).  There is a family connection between the two establishments, but I understand there to be some hard feelings between the two factions, hence the separate business ventures.  If you close your eyes, the peanuts and the pizza are identical.

This location is alot bigger, a lot fancier and busier, but these people remember where they came from which is a single store front back in the day.  The menu is the same, the quality exquisite,  the memories, priceless.

Menu offers a little something for everyone and service is friendly and NOT PRETENTIOUS or silly like at some places along the corridor, I&#39;m just saying!
As a note, from my other review:
One of the last meals on earth my mom ate by coice was a Number 7.  Cheese Sausage and Mushroom.  Or it used to be,either way, that says alot doesn&#39;t it?

And such a beautiful building, surely this would really be top-notch pizza too.  I have to say I was disappointed.  The pizza was just ordinary, not bad but certainly nothing special.  I sure wish I could find a pizza place that still actually tosses their crusts.  I think this must be the only way to get the thin, crispy, bubbly crusts that make such a good base to a terrific pizza.  The crust at Village seems to be rolled out so it&#39;s pretty tough.  The sauce is good and the toppings are plentiful, but again, just nothing special.  I do enjoy the basket of peanuts to munch on while waiting for service, but be careful... we waited so long for service we were pretty full of peanuts and decided to go without an appetizer.  We haven given Village Pizza several tries thinking maybe it was an off night, but the marginal pizza and consistantly poor service has kept us from returning.

I caught a glimpse of the kitchen last night on the way out and it is immaculately clean.  The drinks are good and reasonably priced, the staff is friendly and helpful. Not a huge fan of the taxidermied (is that even a word?)animals but to be honest, it was several trips before I even noticed them.  Last night we ordered a lg with onions, green peppers and bacon.  It smelled SO good that I actually didn&#39;t eat immediately and just enjoyed leaning over and enjoying the sensory stimulation.  I noticed that they just put up this green awning walkway thing in front of the door (i assume for the wintertime) but everyone is hanging out in there and smoking so it stinks and you have to walk through it to get into the restaurant (and as a former smoker, the smell usually doesn&#39;t bother me).

They don&#39;t take reservations and we waited about 25 minutes.  I asked the server if we could put our pizza order in now so it will be ready when we get a table and she said &#34;No, we don&#39;t do that - it got too complicated and we made too many mistakes.&#34;  So we waited.  They finally put us in a 4-person booth and pushed a 4-person table next to it (with a highchair).  You do the math.  I called the hostess back over and told her we couldn&#39;t fit 11 people at an 8 person table. &#34;Oh, ok&#34; and found another table to push next to it.  As she was walking away the waitress grabs the hostess and starts yelling at her that she can&#39;t take our table and blah blah.  I thought, great - we&#39;re screwed.  Another waitress came by and did you know that the largest pizza they make is 14&#34;?  14&#34; think crust pizza would barely feed my husband.  We ordered 5 pizzas and still could have used a few more.  How stupid is that - this is a place with a party room and supposedly caters to large parties and the biggest pizza is 14&#34;?  Stupid.

We decided to not wait for a table and sat at a tall table in the bar which was perfect because there were a bunch of other 20 somethings there too, having a good time.  We started out by ordering 24 ounce beers, I had Blue Moon and he had Hacker Pschorr.  They were only $3.25 each and I don&#39;t think it was a special!  I think that price is great!  And then we had the breaded mushrooms for an appetizer which were tasty.  For dinner he had the meatball sandwich which was very cheesy but just okay.

Having received not one, not two, but THREE 5 star reviews from my friend Pat E., Town House Books had some rather high expectations to live up to...

We arrived around 1:30 or so to find a short wait for a table on the back patio. There&#39;s no way our stroller would have fit in the dining room, and it was too gorgeous a day to spend inside, anyway. The hostess was clearly very busy with the lunch rush, but she was friendly in a not-overly-but-just-perfectly accommodating sort of way, which I very much appreciate. We hung out on a bench out front while we waited for a table, and my son was delighted by the trollies passing by. 

When we were led around back (literally around the corner in our case, since we had to enter through the special side gate to avoid the inside stairs and other awkwardness), we were given a perfect table and greeted by our server, who had the same matter of fact helpfulness as the hostess.

Here is what we ate: BLT + A (A is for avocado) and a cup of French onion soup for me, monte christo for my husband, and half a turkey berry sandwich and a cup of corn chowder for my son.* None of these foods were disappointing! The corn chowder was particularly tasty, creamy and well spiced, and I love that I could order my sandwich on pumpernickel. 

Dear me, how could I forget to mention beverages? I was so, so thrilled to find this on the drink menu: iced coffee (free refills). And some delicious iced coffee it was. I think I&#39;m still hyped from the free refill. My husband and son shared some lemonade, which was the perfect combination of lemony sweetness, and also free refills.

We enjoyed flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce for dessert (mmm, highly recommend), and my husband had a double shot espresso which he said was just to his liking.

It didn&#39;t dawn on me until later how reasonably priced this all was. Exceptional soup, sandwiches, drinks and desserts, all at prices less than those of a Panera. Thanks to the atmosphere and excellent staff, we had a relaxing time on the patio, which is not always easy to achieve when your dining companions are a tired three year old and a small baby who is trying desperately to steal the avocado from your sandwich.

*Can I just add, as a side note: one of the many wonderful things about having a three year old with a hearty appetite who will eat anything is that I get to order two meals, basically. If he has no strong opinions, I just get to pick whatever I want a bite of. Hooray!",13/10/13,312,5,3,5,94,9.595900000000002,5.019,1.0589999999999997,14.921,No,2722

This cafe is located near downtown, but off the beaten path a bit. The dining area is surprisingly large and open, though, and being able to browse books afterwards is nice. What I loved, though, was the food.

I got a spinach turkey sandwich with fruits on the side. As it turns out they just serve Terra Chips if you want the chips, so I&#39;ll get those next time. And I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever gotten a sandwich that was as well put together as this one. The dill cheese was my favorite part of the sandwich, and all of the flavors just went well together. I was eating in a bookstore but could easily have been eating on a farm.

We also got the last piece of apple crumble pie, which was more or less half apples and half crumble, and 100% goodness. With crumbles that big, you know you&#39;re getting your daily serving of butter. But the apples weren&#39;t neglected either, with some soft bites and some crunchy apple bites -- definitely leave room for dessert.

Everyone on Yelp seems to love this little cafe, but despite my best efforts, I just can&#39;t get a win out of it.

People rave about the sandwiches, so I have tried the Plain Jane Grilled Cheese, Tuna Herb. Egg Salad and Town House Turkey. All have been so-so. They certainly were not the best sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had (that honor, thus far, still goes to Panini Panini in Michigan City, IN). The bread was a bit dry and dull, and the sandwiches themselves could have used more &#34;guts.&#34; 

What keeps bringing me back are the desserts, as I had the most amazing blueberry pie the first time I visited Town House Cafe. I haven&#39;t seen it on the specials board since, but I have tried just about every other kind of cake/pie, including a rather tasteless flourless chocolate cake, buttermilk pie with spiced peaches, and blueberry crumble. All have been disappointing. I can find better desserts at The Sugar Path or All Chocolate Kitchen in Geneva.

The wait service at Town House Cafe has been hit or miss. On the one hand, my water glass never goes empty, and the waitstaff is usually willing to bring you a sample of soup if you are thinking about ordering a bowl. However, the waitstaff has a difficult time explaining what they like on the menu (which makes me think they haven&#39;t tried everything), and often doesn&#39;t come to check on you once you have your lunch (except to ask if you want &#34;dessert or the bill?&#34;).

What REALLY bothers me though is the noise level inside this cafe. It gets obnoxiously loud. I don&#39;t know if they need to replace the carpeting or install ambient noise, but something has to give because it&#39;s hard to hear the person you&#39;re sitting right next to.

My fiance and I went here for Sunday brunch.  Although, he thought the brunch menu had slim pickings, I thought it was just enough for this dainty cafe.  What it lacked in the number of items, it made up in taste!  The menu had that special quality... you know, when you just can&#39;t decide on one item because everything looks so tasty?  I thought it had a lot of unique items that you just can&#39;t find at any chain breakfast or brunch restaurant.

We both started with mimosas, which were very refreshing and came out in surprisingly large campaign glasses.  For my meal, I had the lunch combo with half town house turkey sandwich, a cup of chilled avocado and jalapeno soup, and a mixture of kettle potatoes and carrot chips!  One word: YUM.  I loved the union between the smoked mozzarella, roasted red onion, avocado, turkey, lettuce, and spicy mayo. Everything in that sandwich worked so well together!  The soup was an interesting combination and to be honest, I didn&#39;t finish it as a soup but actually as dipping sauce for my chips! Soup... dip... can&#39;t go wrong!

Food: awesome.  We went in for brunch and everyone loved their dishes.  My mom&#39;s tuna was awesome.

Ambiance: this little gem is nestled in such a pretty little street in downtown St Charles, you just don&#39;t care about anything else.  

My only gripe was...things get kinda tight in here.  Their space is cramped and they do the best they can with it but it does get crowded.  

Concept: Brunch and Books!  Winning combination!  There is a super quaint bookstore attached to the restaurant you can browse while waiting.  There are antique shops, lots of beautiful spaces to explore in the area as well.

I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that this place included a nice book store and a small bar. Perfect!

It&#39;s obvious that the restaurant area is really geared toward those eating lunch or dinner, but if you are so inclined (as I was) they seem to accommodate patrons (me) that just want to read or study while have a coffee or wine.

I had the club sandwich- and the homemade mustard they use is spicy and wonderful. I upgraded (for 1.50) to the salad of the house- totally worth it- pecans, dried cranberries, veggies, and a homemade spicy ranch- salad heaven!

The cafe has a homey, friendly room with vintage memorabilia about authors and books on the walls.

Our group of five was seated promptly at a round table near an old-fashioned window looking out to the historic street area.  The soups of the day including a creamy potato and a tomato-basil, were very good and served in generous portions.  We also had nice gooey toasted cheese sandwiches on homemade bread.

My friend had recommended we go there as he had been there several times and always enjoyed the food. We also figured it would be a perfect place to eat before we hit some of the local stores in the area. This area of St. Charles is a great place to shop for truly unique items and to help support our local store owners....

While we waited for our table we went into the bookstore and found several books that caught our attention, and was amazed by the selection that they had available.  When it was our time to eat we sat at the counter. We were able to watch so many wonderful looking deserts be made that we were like oh my this isn&#39;t good we may have to skip the meal and go right to desert.  However, we stayed strong and had a wonderful meal. I had the eggs benedict and their side of potatoes both had a wonderful flavor. My friend had a sandwich, that he says he always gets. He said it is one of his all time favorites. He said he has also had their house salad and it is out of this world as is their banana cream pie.

While we were waiting for our food they brought out a fresh flour less chocolate cake, that looked vary tasty. I however, said I&#39;m standing firm and having the raspberry pie to go....Let me just tell you when I had that with my dinner that evening not only was the raspberry filing wonderful so was the crust. I shocked myself and eat all the crust which is unheard of for me. My kudos to the baker, I want them here at my place making pies.....

While we were there I took a peak at their non Sunday menu and found several items that I would enjoy so I know I have to go back and try other items. 

I highly recommend this place to you. I also noticed they had wine for those that like a glass of wine with their meal.  I have to say the wait staff was not only prompt they were friendly and they seem to keep the place going.

grande-jakes-fresh-mexican-grill-rolling-meadows,Megan M.,#NAME?,ITsf8PIHUAdEsAXnwoch5A,"Amid the era of the Taco, there&#39;s something perversely comforting about a football sized double meat burrito.
It&#39;s not that Tacos aren&#39;t great, (they are... as appetizers!) it&#39;s just that the savage carnivore within me requires satiation in the quantitative form, the MASS quantitative form, preferably smothered in steaming hot Chihuahua cheese and loaded with enough protein to damn near shut down my lower intestines. 
That&#39;s why I frequent Grande Jake&#39;s. They understand the importance of over-sized indulgence, and they pair it, appropriately, with a salsa bar and endless tortilla chips. 
The stuff dreams are made of. (if you&#39;re a glutton like me) 
This is why I recommend you abandon all attempts at social conformity, and cast your pride aside to dine in. It&#39;s also why I recommend wearing comfortable, stretchy attire, suitable for the expansion which a football sized burrito will cause. You may also want to consider rolling up any sleeves (or forgoing sleeves) as that cheesy layer of deliciousness can create an oily mess on any fabric it encounters. 
Napkins are your friend, unless you&#39;re purposely trying to save some for later.

It is counter service, the guy taking the orders was friendly, I placed my order for the Carne Asada cooked medium rare, and salad instead of rice and beans, plus a small side of guac and proceeded to wait at my booth. The chips and salsa were promptly delivered to my table, the chips were warm and colorful with a perfect delicious crunch and flavor and the 2 salsas served with the chips were very good, one had a smoky flavor, and the other one more tomato-e. 

There is a help yourself salsa bar with lots to choose from, I tried the mango salsa which was delicious and a green mild salsa which was watery and lacking flavor. My food arrived, and the steak looked great but it was obvious that Grande&#39;s specialty is not salads, there was a bit of chopped lettuce, some not so great looking tomato and a few strips of green and pepper on it, plus it was a very small side, I always say that if they can&#39;t do it right they shouldn&#39;t do it at all, oh well, I was just happy the steak looked so good, that is until I took a bit, the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, however it had no flavor, totally lacked any seasoning, very surprising as Carne Asada is usually well marinated and full for flavor, luckily the guacamole was fresh and very tasty.

Service was friendly, however I found it very disruptive that there were several ladies cleaning the restaurant, basically right next to me, as I sat in my booth trying to enjoy my dinner there was a lady vacuuming right next to me, and others moving the chairs around and sweeping, it felt like i was in the way, now mind you this is 2 hours prior to them closing, I totally understand if they were cleaning tables and wiping them down, but they were doing a move everything and deep clean, sweep and vacuum, not exactly the environment you want to be in while trying to enjoy dinner.

She recommended the burrito, so since today is Wednesday and the special is the Mas Grande Burrito, I said let&#39;s give it a go! I got steak and chorizo in it.

The service was pretty good. Food was quick coming out. The waitress who delivered the guacamole stood there and waited til we tried it to make sure we like it which I thought was good.

On to the burrito. It was humongous! I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever had a burrito as big. The taste was ok. The sauce covering the burrito wasn&#39;t bad; good flavor but I felt there could&#39;ve been a little more sauce. The meat on the inside was seasoned well. The problem is that the condiments weren&#39;t evenly distributed. One side of my burrito was all lettuce. The other side was all meat. Everything else was in the middle. So one bite was all lettuce, the next was all meat.

I realized it was missing the avocado that it was supposed to have and it was only when I requested some that they admitted that they were out of it. Disappointing, but honestly I don&#39;t think it would have made much of a difference.  The format of the restaurant was also confusing- we ordered at the counter but then we were sort of waited on as if it were a restaurant.  The waitress came up to us and asked if we wanted to pay (as we hadn&#39;t at the counter; we were maybe considering ordering another beer).  She didn&#39;t hand us the check or even tell us how much we owed, but instead waited as we stopped our conversation to pull out a credit card to pay; kind of awkward.

I walked in right at the start of lunch time, there was a group of 6 in front of me and a group of 4 behind me. You walk in and place your order at the front, they give you a number and you wait for them to bring you your food. There are a lot of options on their menu including lunch specials. 
I went with the enchiladas suizas lunch special. It came with two enchiladas, rice and beans. While I waited for my food I got served chips and salsa, yum. They offered two types of salsa, one which is served hot. Both were very mild and absolutely delicious. They have a salsa bar also but I didn&#39;t check that out on my visit. 
My food came out rather quickly. I was surprised that it came so fast considering how busy they were. In a manner of minutes the restaurant was completely full. 
Ok so my enchiladas have to be some of the best I&#39;ve had in a long time. The steak was tender, full of flavor and there was plenty of it. The red sauce tasted home made and fresh and they added just the right amount of cheese. The beans were good and the rice was made the way I like it, with peas and carrots. I washed my meal down with a fantastic horchata. 
The restaurant isn&#39;t too big but it&#39;s decorated nicely in lively bright colors, the employees were very friendly and they have an out door seating area. Oh they also serve alcohol.

There was a line at the counter where you order when we arrived. It was rather slow moving so we ended up waiting for a little while longer than I would have liked. They have a fairly traditional Mexican-American menu and some Tex-Mex items. On my son&#39;s suggestion, I order a steak burrito. I would classify it as akin to Chipotle&#39;s burritos. They are quite large and very filling.

The really nice thing about Grande Jake&#39;s is their bottomless bowl of multi-colored tortilla chips and their salsa bar. I like the hotter sauces, and they had several of them. I can&#39;t say I liked all of the different ones, but I did find a few to keep me happy.

Chorizo enchilada with Mole -- anytime I see mole on the menu, I have to try it out. This mole was just a little bit sweet, and went really well with the crumbly, greasy, surprisingly flavorful chorizo. I liked the rice and refried beans as well, both scratchmade and authentic (well, authentic enough for my taste buds). Plus I had more than enough for leftovers.

My wife had a chicken quesadilla, which she liked, but I didn&#39;t actually taste it.

Fried ice cream -- because the owner himself suggested I buy a Groupon good for $20 worth of food, we ended up getting a fried ice cream. This was excellent; not so much the vanilla ice cream, but the crispy fried bread it was served on top of. It&#39;s like having the best parts about a churro and an ice cream combined.

Free chips! And more importantly, free salsa - there&#39;s a mango one that&#39;s quite good, but all of them were bright, fresh and spicy.

I&#39;d read great reviews on Yelp, so we decided to splurge on our low carb diet. What a huge disappointment! 

Horrible, canned food. Not fresh, canned. Huge portions,  but nothing you want to eat, so,  what is the point? Nachos had canned cheese sauce and canned refried beans. We should have stopped right there,  but we decided to share a wet burrito. After the first bite, we sent it back.

They serve warm chips with salsa as you wait for your food, which comes out pretty fast.

They have a decent variety at their salsa bar. From super hot habenero to mango salsa, they have several choices.

I ordered the chicken fajitas. It had peppers, onions, chicken, and was seasoned really nicely. It came with a generous amount of corn tortillas (flour, if you want them). The waitresses there were super friendly and nice.

Basically, they have 5ish black iron tables sitting there and that&#39;s it, not very inviting or cozy at all. It was pretty crowded inside and not 1 table outside.

I like their chunky salsa and Jake substitutes the Verde salsa for this one on my enchilada. It&#39;s also very reasonable for the quantity and we&#39;ll definitely be back. Jake&#39;s has all the ingredients for a perfect casual dinner- great service, great food and great prices. Thank you Jake&#39;s for finally giving us a good Mexican restaurant!

Note to the vegetarians: Jake&#39;s will substitute all his meals with veggies (onions and peppers). The rice is made from chicken broth so if that&#39;s a problem make sure you ask for no rice.",04/03/14,96,5,2,5,23,5.1606000000000005,3.6289999999999996,0.40800000000000003,6.9639999999999995,No,885

We are picky with what steak and carnitas we like and we really enjoyed both there. We told everyone about the place! We have since learned that this place is REALLY hit or miss! The consistency just isn&#39;t there! The ground beef NEVER seems to have been drained which causes the tacos to fall apart, carnitas are now sometimes too wet with just too much juice, and sometimes the burritos have WAY too much of one ingredient like the cheese, which ruins the burrito all together! We have been trying to order the flan there since our first visit and although it&#39;s on their menu, they do not have it and the owner keeps saying they are &#34;just focusing on the food for now.&#34; Geez! Take it off the menu if you never plan to have it! After my last visit, I&#39;m prolly not going to go back any time soon! I ordered pork tamales &amp; they were terrible!! They were extremely dry &amp; had way too much cornmeal! I have eaten a lot of tamales in my day and aside from canned tamales (no thank you) these were by far the worst! I told the waitress and then the guy at the cash register tasted them and agreed they were very dry. I would have rather just been given something else but they insisted on making me a new tamale dinner! By the time it arrived, my husband was finished eating! The second dish was not nearly as dry, but they still were not good! The sour cream I ordered was way too runny &amp; my beans had a strange tangy can like taste so I could not even disguise the taste of my tamales.  I barely ate anything and I was really disappointed. They never checked on us again so we just left! I paid for a $10.95 tamale dinner plus tip and I left hungry and annoyed only to come home and eat left over mac n cheese! That was 40 mins I can&#39;t get back and $14 in the trash!

I came here for my standard &#34;taco Thursday&#34; stop; deciding to try a new place this week.  I believe they opened this location right around Christmas time.  There is another in Buffalo Grove and somewhere else.  

Being &#34;taco Thursday&#34; I ordered two tacos and had to try the advertised hand rolled tamale.  One taco steak and the other carnitas on soft corn shells.  The shells were okay a bit tough.  The meat on the tacos were flavorful.  The steak not as flavorful as Los Compandres&#39;.  I really did enjoy the food though, and please realize I am really picky about tacos.  The tamale had really good flavor, but seems quite dry to me.  Not sure if it was sitting out for a time or something.  I will try another, just to make sure it wasn&#39;t a bad one.  

The star of the show is there salsa bar.  There are around 12 different salsas most or all which seem freshly made.  The ones I tried I really, really liked.  

I went back today (a few days after my first time) and tried steak and al pastor tacos.  The al pastor was excellent.  The steak was the same as before, good NOT greasy, but could use a bit more flavor (imo).  

Solid four stars.  I am glad they are close to work and home as I see this as a place to get a quick bite or full on meal.  Tacos are $2.85 each, which at first I thought was expense, but they are large and worth the price.

It&#39;s hard to find good Mexican food in the burbs, so it makes me appreciate this place a little more.  I&#39;m always happy when I find good Mexican food:)

Also, the customer service is awesome here!  They are so friendly, welcoming, helpful, and attentive.  Yet, they are not a normal sit down restaurant, which is fine with me.  They just really value customer service and it&#39;s evident that they have such great management here.  It&#39;s really refreshing every time I come here, because as soon as I walk in the door, I&#39;m instantly in a good mood. 

I loved their salsa bar too!  They are all fresh and there&#39;s something for everyone there, as there are so many choices.  Every Mexican place should have this feature...it&#39;s genius!  And it&#39;s self-service, which I love.  It&#39;s a no-brainer to me:)

Overall, I thought the portions were good too.  I have two complaints, which prevented me from giving this place 5 stars.  The first is, that, they barely give me any rice with my entree.  The amount of beans is fine, but the amount of rice I&#39;ve been given, is equivalent to about one tablespoon worth.   

The other issue was, that, their chips taste like they come from a bag.  There&#39;s food coloring used to make some of the chips red etc.  When I eat tortilla chips, I want them to taste home-made and not like they&#39;re bought from a store and colored with additives.  That&#39;s a huge reason why I like to go to Mexican restaurants, because I love home-made chips and salsa.  If I wanted store-bought tortilla chips, I would eat them at home.  

Those are the only 2 reasons I didn&#39;t give a higher ranking.  If they fixed those things, I&#39;d give it a 5 star, without hesitation....but those are pretty big deals to me, considering I have a lot to compare it to and because rice and tortilla chips are a staple at any Mexican restaurant. UPDATE: I do not recommend getting take out....the portions are much smaller, than when you dine in. that&#39;s unacceptable and there&#39;s no legit reason to do that.  I find that to be shady, so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll give them my business anymore.  I&#39;d rather give my business, to places that are fair and give the same portion, whether you&#39;re getting take out or dining in, which I&#39;ve have no problem finding.",05/05/14,262,3,3,5,79,6.6553,4.776999999999999,1.144,20.079,No,2401

We finished up our business trip early so we headed over here for a lunch.  Thankfully, it wasn&#39;t too packed, but by the time we got our food the line had grown.  I opted for the chili cheese dog, cheese fries and the chocolate cake milkshake.  Yeah, way too much food but it was stupid good of course.  The dog had a nice snap and was covered in a messy amalgam of hearty chili and cheese sauce.  And the cheese fries were on point...exactly what you&#39;d think they&#39;d be...fries with a cup of wonderful, melty, plastic-y cheese for dipping.

And the shake...I was told I wouldn&#39;t be able to finish it but I had to order it, kind of a right of passage.  The cake is apparently super moist because they add mayonnaise to the batter.  It does not change the taste at all, but makes the cake dense and almost fudgy.

I visited this location on Sunday, September 18th about 4pm.  Can&#39;t give the exact time as they conveniently did not give me a receipt.  Oh, the oh so charming staff, did provide a &#34;survey receipt&#34; which oddly does not match the dollar amount on my credit card. 

The line in the drive through was not too long, yet the time was insane.  That should have been my immediate clue to leave. It was a sign of the total incompetence of this location.  Here is what I ordered:

1 Regular Beef, no peppers, Extra, Extra, Extra, Extra Juicy
1 Big Beef, no peppers, Extra, Extra, Extra, Extra, Extra juicy
1 hot dog, everything but peppers
1 Strawberry Shortcake
Extra Gravy for both Beefs, as no matter how many times you tell them to drown it, it is still not wet enough for our tastes.

After the extensive repeating of the order, I snaked through the line of 2 cars in front of me. After all this time in line, a worker appears outside to repeat the order and take the payment.  My hot dog was not on the order, so it gets added and he gives me this BS story of how they double check to make sure the item is on the order and gets charged. He says often times its there but you don&#39;t get charged.  I laugh, Portillo&#39;s has never failed to charge me, more likely charge and fail to deliver.

When  I finally make it to the window to collect the food, the &#34;charming&#34; clerk hands me the bag, with the beefs, hot dog and shortcake in one plastic bag, but the shortcake is touching the beef, why???

I look in the bag and find one tiny container half full of gravy and ask for more. After waiting nearly five minutes, a very rude woman who must have been pretending to be a manager, pops her head out of the window and hands me a larger container, again half full, and tells me they are not supposed to do this, blah, blah.  If you would give me what I ordered, I would not have to ask for it.

When I arrived home, as usual the beef were not wet enough.  The hot dog tasted old and stale, there was no &#34;snap&#34; at the first bite.  

I would strongly advise anyone to stay away from this location.

I save it as an indulgence for outside the home. Being Yelp minded and thinking to eat local when road dawging it, I made Portillo&#39;s my annual &#34;have a bite of hot dog&#34; stop. The hot dogs here were so good I had more than that!

We ordered two plain dogs and thanks to the reviews on Yelp, I went for a chili cheese dog too. We hadn&#39;t even got our supplies from the condiment station when our number was called. I like that!

The dogs and the poppy seed buns went down fast! And no tummy upset so I figure Portillo&#39;s uses quality meat. For $2.85 per dog, they better be!

Chili had beans in whole form that I could see! I like that rather than something ground down to mush. It was not sloppy, which I was afraid of. I would get this again even though it&#39;s far outside my usual chow.

Fries were nothing special to speak of. Crinkles from a freezer bag. Hot, but not salted. I added.

The cashiers state that the receipt has a survey (which we filled out as soon as we got home) for free food, so you know they aim to serve if they push that from the get go. I saw a diverse workforce here.

The decor is awesome! I felt like I could use the diner vibe to sell others on coming here. It&#39;s my favorite look in a restaurant. Authentic and not kitschy. 

It is a &#34;busy&#34; look. Finding the order taker took a minute. When faced with a standing crowd, go straight back!

It&#39;s cool how the expo person has sassy rhymes to call out along with the order number! 

Mid afternoon, the dining room tables could have been cleaner but someone was changing trash so I give the benefit of the doubt he/she was working toward it and won&#39;t deduct a star. Bathrooms were clean.

Having been to the downtown location when doing business in the area in the past, I will definitely make it a point to adjust our &#34;road food&#34; stops to include this location, and you should too. In/out and parking was easy. This is super easy to get to off of the interstate and is well worth the stop rather than taking a typical fast food option that is visible from the exit.

I&#39;ve been eating Portillo&#39;s since I was a wee child and it is engrained in my blood. Everything they have is delicious, from the Italian beef (get it dipped and with peppers!), their hot dogs, and their burgers. I love their Maxwell Polish sausage, with grilled onions and mustards (like a brat). Their chopped salad is also very popular if you&#39;re more in the mood for a salad. Their chili cheese dogs are great, as are their plain hot dogs. They serve quality burgers that will make you want to come back for more! Their fries are delicious and my family is a huge fan of getting cheese fries. In addition, they have the best shakes and malts, especially considering malts are hard to come by nowadays! One of their shakes is called the chocolate cake shake where they take a slice of their chocolate cake and mix it into their shake... It&#39;s very hit or miss with people because the texture is weird, but I personally really like it!

The star of the show for sure is their chocolate cake. So much so that I need to write about it in a separate paragraph. Portillo&#39;s chocolate cake is the best cake you will ever eat in your life. I&#39;ve been requesting this cake for my birthday for years and years, and it never lets me down.

For the first time ever, I got the dip (on the side) and I&#39;m glad I did. It was really good. Not salty like other dips I&#39;ve had. It had a mushroom flavor. It was a nice addition to the combo and didn&#39;t overpower anything.

The other people I was with got the combo, bacon cheeseburgers, cheese fries, and onion rings. Yes, I tried some onion rings. I can&#39;t help it. It&#39;s hot, crispy, fried goodness.

I ordered the exact same thing yet this time when I brought it home the Italian beef I bit into was nothing but fat.

I know this stuff is terrible for me, but I&#39;m from Villa Park, where the original Portillo&#39;s Dog House stand all began, so *technically* I&#39;m eating local whenever I eat the garbage pile of food that I consumed here tonight... which sadly, doesn&#39;t happen often. 

And please don&#39;t PM me about America&#39;s obesity problem. Or about how fast food is killing the nation. Or about how not only do you not eat fast food, but you don&#39;t even have a microwave. Congrats to you. Have a cookie... for everyone who cares... which leaves you with exactly zero cookies. PS, your pious is showing.

Tonight I had 4 large orders of fries, 2 cups of melt-y cheese, and a chocolate cake shake for dinner... because I&#39;m an adult and I can do that. Also because my life partner is out of town and this is the way I choose to fend for myself... and it makes me happy. It really does. He doesn&#39;t understand. It reminds me of growing up in Villa Park, it reminds me of my family, it reminds me how much I love food, and even though my pants feel a size of two tighter and I needed to take an emergency nap after eating just a quarter of my order, it reminds me that there are much worse things I could be than unhealthy. 

I mean, unhealthy isn&#39;t a goal of mine, but honestly, I&#39;m over the war on unhealthy and personally, feel that my time is much better spent elsewhere, fighting the war on unhappy. I can think of a million things that are worse to be than fat, and unhappy is right up there at the top of the list. If you&#39;re an adult, you should stay tuned to what makes you happy. What would you do if there was no one around to judge you or tell you what&#39;s right or wrong? I&#39;d eat a shit ton of Portillo&#39;s cheese fries. It&#39;s a simple thing. So simple, in fact, that I can see where it might even be a little sad, but for whatever reason, to me it&#39;s not. 

This was actually the second Portillo&#39;s I visited today. I&#39;d originally gone to one up the road from here (that was actually closer to me) and convinced myself that I should feel guilty for going and I as I sat in the looong drive through line (even at 8:30 in the evening) waiting for the guys in yellow safety vests to take my ridiculous order. Then, as I got closer to approaching the order people, I got a phone call from my Andres D, and I decided to take it as a sign that I shouldn&#39;t be eating this way since I wouldn&#39;t be able to both talk to Andres and place my order with the drive-thru man at the same time, so I turned the wheel and decided to leave my spot in the drive-thru queue and go somewhere healthier. Maybe Whole Foods. 

And then I got to talking to Andres, who&#39;s absolutely one of the kindest, sweetest, happiest guys I know - also a lover of fast food - and told him what just happened with my feeling guilty and leaving the drive-thru and what my order wsa going to be, and the first thing he said was, &#39;Mark is out of town again, isn&#39;t he?&#39; and the second was something along the lines of &#39;Treat yo se&#39;f!&#39;... so I did. Because he&#39;s right.

So while I continued to discuss not-so-urgent life matters with Andres, I found myself at another Portillo&#39;s location just up Golf Road and I couldn&#39;t help but laugh as I placed my order with the girl standing outside the drive thru lines. I honestly couldn&#39;t hold it in. So much so that I felt bad, because I started to feel like either the girl who was taking my order would think I was having a go at her, or that I was on something, so I apologized and just explained that I wasn&#39;t laughing at her, I was laughing because all that food was for me. All of it. And i just had to laugh. She didn&#39;t judge. Just smiled and told me I could move up in line. Sweet thing. 

When I finally got up to the window to pick up my cake shake and food, the girl handed me a cake shake with no straw and I was like thinking, &#39;what the sh*t is this?&#39;, so I calmly asked for a straw and she replied that the straw was inside my bag with all my fries. 

WHY U DO DIS TO ME, PORTILLO&#39;S? 

You know damn well that no one orders a cake shake and leaves without sucking half of it down before they get of the parking lot. It&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to make searching for the cake shake straw the new texting and driving. 

Also, my fries here weren&#39;t the freshest... which was sad since I&#39;d gotten an almost literal boatload of them, but ain&#39;t no thang for me because I&#39;ve got a damn fine microwave that was more than happy to assist in saving my happiness, er, dinner. i mean dinner.",30/09/13,506,4,2,0,29,-0.9745000000000001,4.69,3.5699999999999994,34.74299999999999,No,4704

portillos-hot-dogs-rolling-meadows,Clara C.,OIiYnTwm9qODSfOV-HJ_WQ,7vaiJiVDvaHudqXOz-iVuw,"Always getting food reports from my friend in Chi, Portillo&#39;s was another place I&#39;d been wanting to try so he &amp; I went on my second day in town.

I really dislike theme &amp; retro dcor and boy did this place have it, big time. Seems most locations have some kind of kitschy theme, ugh.  But I wasn&#39;t here for that as much as I was for a hot dog &amp; an Italian beef.

We didn&#39;t have to wait too long to order, a couple minutes at the walk up counter and about 5 more minutes for the food.  I chose a booth; he waited up front for the food.

We ordered and shared one of each:
1. Italian beef, dipped then topped with sweet peppers &amp; spicy giardiniera - I love a good beef dip and a dipped Italian seems to be the Chicago equivalent.  Ya gotta eat the fully dipped Italian beef really fast here because the bread can&#39;t hold up to much au jus before it becomes a soggy mess - not what I&#39;m used to.  The flavor was good and I love the spicy giardiniera.  I coulda eaten a whole one! But I still had the next thing to try...

2. Hot dog with everything (except sport peppers): mustard, relish, chopped onions, sliced tomatoes and pickle  on a poppy seed bun (of course!) - Oh the snap of that dog when I bit into it with all the flavors melding together!  It was a little bit of heaven.  The warm hot dog and the cold condiments all went together perfectly.

3. French fries - I love crinkle cut fries but you rarely see them out here in So Cal anymore.

They get my A-ok...solid comfort food.",26/09/13,189,3,1,3,-3,2.7937000000000003,2.149,0.573,13.278,No,1525

I hardly ever come here (only because it&#39;s not that good for you...but it tastes great!!), but when I do I go all out. Give me everything you have.

portillos-hot-dogs-rolling-meadows,Zach F.,xCFCB2l4ah9nIMG50Fho7A,4B39LorLEqcUGlS3vcPuUQ,"Portillo&#39;s embodies everything that a great diner should be; from the nostalgic, 1960&#39;s era decor to the great food and friendly service. Dick Portillo did a great job of crafting the gold standard for diners in the Chicago region and beyond. As soon as you step through the front door you are instantly taken back in time to the colorful, neon lights of the 60&#39;s with old movie posters and signs classically adorning the tile walls. While you&#39;re eying the decor, your auditory system will be pleasantly treated to the sounds of decades past music that will even put the brattiest of Chicago-born children in a good mood. When you approach the counter, you will overwhelmed with a plethora of food options, ranging from large flame-broiled burgers to classic Chicago dogs and heaping Italian beef sandwiches.  Although the prices no longer reflect those of yesteryear, they are very competitive for the quality and quantity of food you receive.  I can&#39;t recommend an individual item to order from the menu as I have yet to find one that I didn&#39;t thoroughly enjoy. However, I would recommend saving room for one of their delicious malts. While you&#39;re there, make sure you take the time to look at some of the signed pictures they have scattered throughout the place. You&#39;ll see everything from celebrities posing with Dick Portillo to the founder of Jimmy John&#39;s telling Dick that he&#39;s the &#34;only guy who makes a better sandwich than [Jimmy John].&#34; This truly is a great establishment that should serve as a model for restaurants everywhere.

The spicy peppers added a lot of flavor and I would suggest that you don&#39;t order without them. The sandwich is really messy to eat because the sauce makes the buns soggy, i would ask for light on the sauce or dry and on the side next time.

portillos-hot-dogs-rolling-meadows,Adam H.,vEI-q4kihUjWxp-myC-LIw,YxNklPpnru2WqN65JFv9og,"I&#39;m going to try something different here. I&#39;ll go out on a limb and say, I hope by now you know that the hot dogs and beefs are good. If not, stop reading and order one, or the other, or both. Whatever. 
But going off my tip, Yelp wants me to elaborate (&#34;great tip now give us more&#34;) I&#39;m going to highlight the underrated: Burger. Call me sacrilegious, I don&#39;t care.
 
The Portillos burger is char broiled and served on a fluffy bun with the usual fixings one would typically expect. It doesn&#39;t sound spectacular, and doesn&#39;t have anything wild n&#39; crazy about it, but that&#39;s the beauty of it. It&#39;s a delicious, no-gimmick, &#39;str8 up&#39; burger. I won&#39;t sit here and tell you that I only eat their burgers, because that would be false, I just thoroughly enjoy a good burger and Portillos is an unexpected place to find one. I don&#39;t know if their crinkle-cut fries seal the deal and really sell the whole meal or what. but I&#39;m a huge fan. 
When I think about the burger itself, I picture it coming from a greasy spoon, mom &amp; pop shop established in 1943, corner hole-in-the-wall burger joint, where the burger is their specialty. Clearly such is not the case, which is why people make the faces they do when I tell them to go to Portillos to feed their burger craving. 

My words of wisdom would be to be brave and don&#39;t order a dog or beef (or salad.....whatever that is) but give the burger a try and you&#39;ll be satisfied.

To make this review relevant to the location: this Portillos is classic; it always feels like a sock hop. Dining in is fine, but the drive through is a well-oiled machine. Hardly a wait (they apologize if they ask you to) and a person is usually standing there to take your order, you pay, and sometimes the food comes even earlier than expected. If only all drive through systems were this smooth...",16/10/13,215,4,1,5,-18,5.3291,2.723,0.513,15.764000000000003,No,1896

The fries never disappoint and they can rarely mess up an Italian Sausage (with hot peppers). However, my last visit was less than pleasant when I ordered the salad. I assume it was because I came at 2:30pm (after lunch rush) but I have never dined in and received a pre-packaged salad! I was pretty weirded out but did not make a big deal--upon further investigation, it seemed the salad had probably been packaged a while before I ordered. The lettuce was browning and limp... the bacon bits were soft from soaking in the salad... and it was just bad. I have never been so disappointed by Portillos before but no one wants to spend $8 on an old salad. Management: Please stop doing this!!! Give the people what they paid for and stop being lazy.

portillos-hot-dogs-rolling-meadows,Scott L.,KJjn3uJzRjjwPDXe4xpxjA,Ghn3_rJBuQ4O6RGoiaxTag,"Portillo&#39;s is a Chicagoland institution and never lets you down. Calling it fast food almost does it a disservice because this fast food is way, way better than any fast food you&#39;ve gotten anywhere else. 

The Chicago staples, such as hot dogs and Italian beef, are a must try. That said, don&#39;t overlook Portillo&#39;s salads, soup and other menu options that make this an extremely viable option for groups that want more than &#34;just burgers and fries.&#34;

If you&#39;re a first timer, I recommend getting the Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers &#34;dipped.&#34; The dip plunges your whole sandwich briefly into au jus and takes the flavor over the top. (Grab lots of napkins, the dipped sandwich is messy). 

Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the fries. I don&#39;t know what they do to them, but those standard looking crinkle cut fries are otherworldly. Best fries anywhere at any price point, period.

We&#39;ve been having this argument for years past and I&#39;m sure we will for years to come. What I&#39;ve just realized is that we ALL actually do agree on one thing, though a dog may or may not be the best, we still have plenty of places that make a dam good Chicago dog! Portillo&#39;s is such a place.   

Portillo&#39;s does have a leg up on others with 31+ locations in IL alone. They thrive on their &#34;best service and best food&#34; motto and in my opinion they come very close. Service isn&#39;t always the &#34;best&#34; and the freshness is somewhat border line. I think their 20&#39;s, 30&#39;s, 50&#39;s, and 60&#39;s decor (pending location) is there to distract you a little (which it does, at least for me). And their menu serves up all the reasons Chicagoans are fat. Though, those moments of happiness with each bite does somehow make it worth it, at least during that meal. All of this plus their prices aren&#39;t so bad either, makes for a fine Chicago hot dog joint!

I finally had the chance to visit my favorite Portillos from my childhood the other day. It looks just as I remember it. We went there during lunch time and the drive thru was very quick. The crew had it running like a fine tuned machine. 

I ordered my favorite beef with mozarella and sweet peppers. My friend got a chicago dog. We shared a strawberry malt and cheese fries. We took this delicious goodness back to the hotel. I sat down at the table and took my first bite. Instantly I was transported down memory lane as flashes of well spiced beef, chewy and wet italian bread and melted cheese over delicious sweet peppers bombarded my taste buds. The malt was a sea of creamy, fruity goodness. The cheese fries were salty and cheesey all at the same time.

(Does that seem like a bad idea to anyone else?)

The Chicago dogs at Portillo&#39;s are entirely competent. Reasonably fresh ingredients, and they appear to come with all the toppings standard (no begging for a pickle or spear peppers). Sesame seed bun, which I prefer. Nice snap. Good.

One of my companions got a chopped salad.  I would have never thought to order a salad at a typical Chicago hot dog stand, but Portillo&#39;s is more of a real restaurant.  The salad appeared to be generously-portioned, fresh, and delicious.

I was less thrilled with the Italian beef, which was garnished primarily with incredibly greasy giardiniera. I asked for it very wet, but it was not drenched with au jus, and was instead swimming in grease. The beef was not too flavorful--very far from where an Italian beef should be.

The bathrooms here were clean, and the 50&#39;s-style dining area was quite large. The service here sharpened to remarkable efficiency.

I&#39;ve always been a pretty big fan of Bonefish, especially when it comes to their happy hour. And while I dine at some of the other locations quite often and have decent service and decent food, this particular experience was a rather unique one that I think also deserves some serious recognition. 

Our visit started out as one that I would have initially described as mediocre. In fact, there was some reservation confusion and ordering issues that really would have made this visit that of 2-3 stars. However, the manager&#39;s quick action and attention to the customer experience changed that completely. This location was quite busy for a Tuesday night, but the manager was paying attention to each customers experience and when she noticed ours was not up to par, she made every effort to fix it. She went above and beyond to correct it, and for that I&#39;m incredibly grateful and think that this location is deserving of a 5 star review. 

I&#39;ve worked in customer service for a long time now, and it&#39;s rare to find restaurants and stores that take their customer experience from mediocre to remarkable. I was so thoroughly impressed by how apologetic this team was over issues that so often I would normally let go or just brush off as a decent or not so great experience. But it&#39;s those small issues that eventually add up and dictate our future decisions as consumers in where we eat or where we shop.

The food was overpriced, under-cooked, small portioned and repeatedly messed up. I was so upset I even had to send a plate back as it was simply awful. (Lobster Roll.)

I could tell that she hated us being there through the glare in here eyes just above her very forced smile.

It has a slight spicy kick, but only enough to feel it. The spice is suited for even a sensitive tounge. The sauce the shrimp comes in also has a rich tang and soft crunch that will leave you craving more. I had the salmon, and while it wasn&#39;t very moist, it was still good enough to suit my desire, though a bit tough, but still enjoyable.

First thing I noticed when we were seated is that the paper tablecloth  cover had oil splotch marks on it already.   They change this as part of cleaning/busing the table.  So I&#39;m not sure why ours was pre-dirtied for us. 

To start, I ordered the Corn Chowder with Crab, which was their soup of the day.  This was incredibly good.   Creamy, and velvety with plenty of crab, sweet corn and few small diced potatoes.   Highly recommended. 

For Entrees:  
Chilean sea bass grilled over wood- mango salsa on the side.  This fish is on the pricey side of the menu, at $27.  It&#39;s totally worth it.  The fish was seasoned nicely, and cooked beautifully.  None of the &#34;cook until it flakes easily&#34; nonsense, that indicates over cooked fish.  The outside had a nice sear, and a good layer of seasoning, and it was tender and delicious in the middle. 

Lobster Roll - Lots and lots and lots of lobster.  The lobster is succulent and delicious with a small amount of dressing.  My mayo despising significant other enjoyed this immensely.  The roll is good in its own right--a light fluffy, slightly sweet potato roll. 

Summary:  Food was excellent.  5 Stars.

Based on price, it&#39;s comparable to Red Lobster - however food wise, this is a better choice, for quality, taste and fewer deep fried items.   

It was a week ago - so having a hard time pullng what we all ate out of my brain - I do know son had a fish stuffed with seafood, and loved it.  (I had some too - was delicious.  I had the rainbow trout with lemon butter, and hubby had scallops.  Everything was perfectly cooked and tasty.

Decor is pleasant, wait staff were perfect. We enjoyed our selves.

Great food, excellent service, reasonable prices for the quality of fare.

We started with the Bang Bang Shrimp because, well, everybody raves about them. They were good, but not sure why they get all the fuss. Spicy shrimp batter fried then coated in a spicy mayo. Interesting and good, but a little overrated.

The bread was amazing and worthy of any Frenchman&#39;s adoration. Crusty crisp exterior, warm soft inside. 

I ordered the Sea Bass with a spinach and crab meat topping called &#34;Kate.&#34; It&#39;s not on the menu, you have to know about it, and it&#39;s worth it. My wife ordered the salmon with mango salsa. Both were very simple presentations, but the fish was so exceedingly fresh that it makes it truly beautiful. 

The key lime pie was likely one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Tart, sweet (but not cloying) and a homemade graham cracker crust.

Their wine list is VERY short. They&#39;re more about cocktails. I ordered a few Maker&#39;s Mark 46&#39;s and a Woodford Reserve. My wife ordered a Newman&#39;s Own Chardonnay (yeah, you read that right, Newman&#39;s Own.)

So.... after reading about Bang Bang shrimp ( and seeing so many people trying to replicate the dish on food sites) I figured it was time to finally retry the restaurant. 

The menu is nice and has variety. It was &#34;bang bang Wednesday&#34; ($5 Bang Bang Shrimp) so we started with that. I dunno.... maybe different locations spice it differently, but it was NOT spicy.... at all. I was SO....disappointed. The breading is good, and the sauce has potential, but frankly, it tasted like mayo mixed with red chili paste or siracha (but not nearly enough to be spicy) and maybe some sweet chili sauce. It was worth $5, but I wouldn&#39;t pay the normal $9.50 price. After seeing so many foodie sites dedicated to trying to figure out the recipe I thought it would have been so much better than it was.

The fish we both ordered was good, but very &#34;over&#34; sauced.... so much so that you lost the flavor of the fish. bummer. Our own fault for ordering the dishes.... I would pick something less complicated next time.

Our server was very nice, but she seemed confused alot. Asked a question about a drink, ended up picking a different one, but got the original one I asked about. 

I have to agree that the portion sizes are a bit small.... skimping on side dishes seems like a cheap way to go, and that was the issue our party had years ago. Using an ice-cream scoop to portion mashed potatoes... potatoes are cheap.... c&#39;mon.

I liked the interior. It felt like you could definitely have a nice romantic dinner, or it would be just as good with a bigger group. Everyone was friendly, and we were treated very well.

That said, my experience at this location as well as another in the Chicago &#39;burbs have always been the same.  A long wait followed by a cramped and loud dining room.

After that, the service was ok, not great.  We waited about ten minutes to make our drink order and also waited a while to get our check after dinner.  The food was good as always but the whole night left a bad taste.

I wonder whether they slapped it in the microwave? When I was a cook, the kitchen manager looked at all food that was sent back before fixing it. If I was manager tonight, I would have not served this fish!  The manager did a great job of service recovery, however, and she didn&#39;t pay for the meal.

Bang Bang Shrimp... ( Recommended)   Not sure what the fuss is about!  Looked like a pile of muck on a bed of lettuce.  Breaded shrimp with a cream sauce pored over it. Greasy. Taste was OK.  Not what I expected at all. Not a lot of bang either.
Baja Fish Tacos.... Very Good!  Could taste the grilled flavor of the fish.... Comes with a small side salad of fresh greens. Would order them again.
Served warm bread ...very nice... with olive oil and pesto? for dipping. Very good.

Upon walking in, my first reaction was suprise at the size of the restaurant.  I was expecting a monstrosity but instead, this restaurant is a touch on the small side.  Very clean, fresh and well appointed.

Cindy, our server, did an excellent job this evening.  Service was timely but not overbearing; just how I like it. Their house sangria at $5 was well worth every penny.  

I had heard the Bang Bang shrimp was to die for, so I ordered that as an appetizer.  It turned out to be my main course too as it was very hearty.  By the time I was done, I was absolutely stuffed.  

I did manage to leave room for that Creme Brulee I spotted on the menu earlier and I was not disappointed.  This dessert had to be the deepest Creme Brulee I ever had.  

The shocking part of the whole evening was at the end of our meal.  I was thanking Cindy for an excellent dining experience when she dropped a bomb shell on us -- Tonight was her first night on the job!  Imagine my suprise.  The meal was perfect and her service was Five Star all the way and here she is on her first night as a server.  Way to go Cindy!

It has been a while since I&#39;ve been to a Bonefish and I&#39;m impressed this location is operating on all cylinders.  First the food:  Ceviche...a tad too salty but fresh lime flavor.  Bang-bang shrimp...always good yet this version tasted like there was more soy added with some of the heat taken away.  Fish-n-chips...not a fan of talapia but loved the batter and the tarter was nice and fish was nice and flaky *so* I guess I like BF&#39;s talapia.  Crab cakes...totally agree with the server on how the presentation is poor but the flaky crab was fresh.  Drinks...big a** blue cheese olives served three per martini I&#39;m *so* fan of that! Finished off with the PBJ bread pudding.  Bread pudding was dry, ice cream was awesome (imagine the filling of a Reese&#39;s Cup) and the raspberry sauce was average.  I recommend asking for extra raspberry and ensuring you get a bite of all three ingredients when digging in, otherwise it will be disappointing experience.   Bottom line the entire staff seemed to have their act together and this location was packed the night we went.

Both times I ordered the Salmon and it came back dry. They love to flavor everything up a bit too much, so you might want to request easy on the spices.

The server was a bit pushy as they wanted to keep the people moving in and out even though there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. I guess when you have eaten seafood on the east coast you realize this place doesn&#39;t even come close. Come on, this is Algonquin not Chicago.

The most recent visit was on Sunday, 2/17. We (a family of five with 2 young kids and a teenager) were seated in a booth right in front of the revolving door. We had to shiver during the whole time we stayed there. To add insult to injury, we noticed that they increased their kids&#39; meal prices. My 4 y.o. daughter ordered a plate of fish strips, which cost $7.9 and my younger son had popcorn shrimp, which was $6.3. Well the fish was actually good, nice crisp breading, but it came with 3 pieces of broccoli, no tar tar sauce, ketchup, or cocktail sauce. My son got his shrimp with SIX sticks of french fries.. SIX!! We thought it was a joke. My husband had the &#34;customer favorite&#34; longfin tilapia stuffed with crab etc. It was around $18 and it was really slim pickings for a 180 pound guy. Our total bill was over $60...Definitely felt like we were cheated. The waitress was nice but she never asked to refill our water glasses or offered to bring another warm bread and olive oil/herbs appetizer. It seemed like they were short on staff, the place was extremely busy and crowded. Overall we definitely felt that: 1. the prices have increased; 2.the quantity of portions have decreased significantly; 3.they were short on staff. We recently stayed in Naples, FL, and dined at the local Bonefish grill, and were pleasantly surprised with the quality/quantity of food there.

The people that work there are very nice and speak Cantonese. Apparently they also serve things like intestine and wonton noodle soup, I&#39;ll work my way to those eventually.

They have some of the best seafood in the area. I highly recommend any seafood dish. I have been avoiding their beef due to some overtenderization issues. Their chicken is really juicy.

Authentic Food
Red Curry Chicken - They added Thai food to their menu recently. The Thai curry is pretty good, I would say not as good as Dan Thai but pretty good.  The Chicken is much juicier than thai chicken which is almost jerk texture.  This kinda made things weird for me. But the curry itself was done well.  I will try some of their other ones in the future since you get SO MUCH MORE food for the same price as Dan Thai.

Salt and Pepper Shrimp - Shell on - the best of this has an easy time of eating the shell, with very minimal notice of the shell.  Here you notice the shell but can also eat the shell.  The shrimp are cooked perfectly.  This is the first place that has carrots in their SP Shrimp, different, not sure I like that part.

Walnut Shrimp - wonderfully cooked shrimp, a bit over battered, with perfectly cooked broccoli and walnuts.  The sauce is great, though for take out, the steam in the container washed some of it off and made liquid on the bottom, but probably not an issue if you eat there or if you open the container sooner rather than later.

White Rice - perfectly cooked fluffly white rice.

Americanized Food
Sweet and Sour Shrimp - the shrimp are big and perfectly cooked, tender, and succulent.  The sauce is authentic, not that neon orange stuff, it is the darker stuff and has some pineapples and green peppers in them.  It&#39;s great!

Fried Rice - they have gotten their fried rice act together. There is so much Wok Hei (the smokiness that makes fried rice good) and it is not hard rice. Best Fried rice in the area for sure.

Egg Rolls - this has improved since the last time few times I had them, they come free with lunch specials so I try them regularly.  It&#39;s not the best but an acceptable egg roll now.

Crab Rangoon - these are wonderfully delicious, a very sweet mixture compared to most rangoons. It&#39;s not traditional but it&#39;s good, more desserty, and the fry is perfectly crispy and crunchy.",22/01/16,277,4,1,5,-41,10.525700000000002,6.856999999999999,0.922,22.220999999999997,No,2390

From the road you see the back of restaurant. When you pull around to parking lot you find the main entrance. On arrival, I was promptly sat and drink order taken. The menu is a normal Chinese Menu, with a twist. It lists the proteins and then explains the sauces in detail. I settled on the sweet and sour pork dinner. The dinner comes with choice of soup, I chose egg drop, an egg roll and main course with fried rice. The soup was served hot and the favors where delicious. The egg roll was loaded with chicken, beef and shrimp. It is served with their own version of duck sauce. Excellent. The sweet and sour pork was battered but served with a traditional red sauce with peppers and pineapples in it. I opted for the combo fried rice and it was brimming with chicken, pork and beef. Overall the food was top shelf and the only bad item was the fortune cookie served at the end was stale.

Decor - So beautiful. The lights, the Christmas decorations, the music...it was all perfect. It felt like a very romantic and cozy setting.

Service - That&#39;s where the one star got knocked off. We waited for awhile in the lobby because there wasn&#39;t a receptionist there to attend to the crown of people building up.

Decor:
A very clean and neat place first of all when you walk right in.  Has a woodsy look to it which gives it that pure country Americana feel to it.  It is a wonderful looking place that has a very cozy feel to it.

Service:
The service was impeccable and impressive. There is nothing that I could complain about when it came to the service.  The wait staff was kind, polite and down to Earth. When you needed something they brought jt out right away. Absolutely excellent service. 

Food:
The food was fantastic.  I had the oven roasted chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I could tell the chicken was well seasoned amd had been cooking for a good while before being served.  I always like places that care about quality over profits.  Also the portions are extremely generous since they give you half a whole chicken.  There had to be rosemary, pepper, salt and butter in the chicken.  Can&#39;t go wrong with this dish here!

Price:

I went here on a Friday night recently with a group of friends: 5 gals who get together every month in the suburbs. It was picked by one woman because, as many have noted in other reviews, it used to be great. It also had live music, a certain Tony Ocean. I read the bad reviews but figured, it will probably be good enough, so let&#39;s just go.

Issue #1: the service. In addition to yakking our ears off about how she can&#39;t keep beer lists straight because she works 3 jobs, our server literally disappeared between drink and food ordering. I&#39;m talking 15-20 minutes. When she finally returned, we had gotten one order in when the food was being &#34;dropped&#34; (as she kept repeating) at a nearby table of hers and she needed to go over and assist with that before taking the rest of our orders. She also reeked of cigarettes, and while I understand many people take smoke breaks in food service, clearly others have figured out how to not come back smelling like it. Lastly, when we asked about our food (which was mostly ordered off the pub menu and were not complex dishes) she said, &#34;Yep, it&#39;s cooking. It&#39;s gotta be cooked before it comes out.&#34; Perhaps not their best hiring decision.

Issue #2: the music. It was extremely loud, and very tacky. It gave the whole place a vibe that I think, unfortunately, it&#39;s going for: a restaurant and bar for empty-nested suburbanites looking to &#34;let loose&#34; on a Friday night. Everyone there over 55 looked like they were having a great time dancing and singing along to the oldies but goodies that Tony Ocean kept churning out. Literally, there was a guy that looked like Rod Stewart, who at first was just dancing with all the ladies and then, at the end, turned out to be another singer in the &#34;band.&#34; Wow. We usually close down a restaurant when we get together, sitting around talking, but we left when we couldn&#39;t handle the volume anymore.

Issue #3: the food. What&#39;s one thing that&#39;s pretty hard to screw up? A BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Well guess what, this, too, was sub-par. My sweet potato waffle fries (the best part!!) came in a quantity of five, which was deeply disappointing. I was only happy to note that the sandwich wasn&#39;t too expensive, I had waffle fries as an option to sub in, and they had bottled Angry Orchard cider. Thank god for small favors.

All in all, I highly discourage anyone who is not from the NW suburbs and over 60 to go here. If you do go, order off the less-expensive pub menu, and get ready to never see your server.",13/05/14,327,2,1,4,-28,3.4466,4.298,1.8820000000000001,24.821,No,2697

An incentive that brought us back was their promotion for a full slab of ribs for $10 and I was glad to take advantage while the deal was valid. I usually don&#39;t order ribs out, which is a shame because I love them, but they require a commitment and a dozen or so moist towelettes, but here I didn&#39;t care.

Go rib or go home.

Millrose has a real, classic, country feel; this is made so with their wood grains and antler chandeliers which adds nicely to their charm. We didn&#39;t have reservations and the wait was substantial, so we decided to sit in the bar area upstairs. It was fairly dark so it was a little challenging as far as a dining experience, but if we were just there for drinks and apps it would have been great. 

After ordering, our drink orders came, however the beers we received were incorrect. Our server was apologetic and very quick to correct the error so there was really no harm done. I did note that the bartender was spending some time chatting up the (seeming) regulars, but didn&#39;t get the beers right; I would have docked a star for that typically, but our server handled the situation seamlessly. 

Ultimately, ribs were good; I ate them all and my fries. I wouldn&#39;t get them again probably, but just so I can try something else on the menu. I&#39;d probably have to wait for another promotion or coupon/groupon  to come around, but I&#39;ll certainly keep my eyes peeled for it. I&#39;d also like to check out the country store but I&#39;ll have to leave that for another time...but don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll review that too.

Before homecoming in high school (and I don&#39;t remember it because it was that long ago)
During a pub crawl (and I don&#39;t remember it because there were three other stops before that one...so....whoops)

So when the in-laws wanted to celebrate two family birthdays here the other day at their Sunday brunch, I was curious to see how it would be.  Since my last two times were...unmemorable.

There were ten of us (including two kids) and each adult is $20.  The kids are $12, I think.  In any case, it was definitely not worth it.

They have a good concept set up (non alcoholic drinks are included, and your waitress will get those for you) and you tell your waitress what kind of omelet you want or if you want sunny side up eggs.  Five people ordered omelets, and they took FOREVER to come out.  At least 30 minutes.  And they weren&#39;t even very good, that&#39;s the worst part.

And my poor husband was waiting to eat his other food because he wanted room for the omelet, so he was really sad the whole time.  Sad and hungry.  Not cool at a buffet.

The rest of the food was lackluster.  The ham was dry, most of the food was cold, and it was just a dreary experience all around.  Definitely not worth the hefty $20 price tag.

Our waitress was really nice and attentive, so I will give her that.  She definitely did the best she could, but it just didn&#39;t really impress all that much.  I definitely wouldn&#39;t go back for brunch.  They seem to cater to an older crowd, but it was even sparse at 11:30 in the morning.",04/02/13,177,3,2,1,35,0.21150000000000002,1.561,2.2910000000000004,15.148,No,1589

Tough call for dinner but went with the octoberfest special. I went for the prime rib but decided to try the special, Pork schnitzel with sour cream mashed potatoes and sliced beets. Great flavor over all.  I would of liked the pork to be a bit more tender but still good.  German sausage soup was awesome.  My husband had 1/2 rib s and chicken and the ribs fell of the bone.

millrose-south-barrington,Patricia L.,AcKEXX1lSVmcNLpJG3CvnA,E2Pvx7puB9pv7uXL-f-4Tw,"I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on over at Millrose. We had our wedding reception (second marriage for us both) at Millrose in 2008, and everything was exceptional, from the food and drinks at the bar, to the service. And we chose it for its warm yet casual atmosphere, and the fact that dinners there had always been wonderful.

Fast forward to 2012. I was looking for a place to host meetings for an organization I belong to. It was a big request, because we need volunteer vendors to hold our events - we don&#39;t have the funds to pay for it ourselves. (We aren&#39;t non-for-profit, but pretty darn close.) I thought, having spent $1000&#39;s there in the past, they might be able to accommodate us in someway. We are willing to run our meetings during off-hours to stay out of the way of staff, and we also are willing to do in on-hours, and have ale cart services for members who DO want to eat. And of course, it brings potential customers through the doors every month, who might stick around for lunch.

The reception I got was extremely cold. Evidently another women&#39;s group that bears no resemblance to ours had been a bad deal for them, so the woman in charge (who clearly sounded like I was wasting her time) would have none of it. Really wouldn&#39;t even hear me out.

That was NOTHING like their customer service in the past. And as I read more recent reviews. sounds like the food is taking a nose-dive as well. Sad.",16/08/13,159,2,1,0,9,-0.497,0.856,1.812,13.332,No,1441
millrose-south-barrington,Lainey R.,DAX2D_hNBASOnyoSWxOPdA,hxwk6st8FLAcEv7AWiQjyg,"We&#39;ve have family dinners, a 50th Anniversary party for my parents, many business Christmas gatherings and more at Millrose over the years.  What has happened here?  

Met a friend for lunch today and we were one of the few parties in the place at 1130am on a Sunday (and no offense, the only party under 60), and it stayed that way until we left at 1:00pm.  After our experience I am guessing I know why:

Service - our server seemed new, yet it appeared he was one of the only servers in the place.  He was handling the patio and inside tables adjacent to the patio. He did not know the menu when asked very basic preparation questions. We had to flag him down to order drinks, replace a drink that was wrong, order our meal, get refreshes and ask where our food was 40 minutes later. (we ordered very simple breakfast plates - nothing crazy fancy here).

Our server said that the &#34;kitchen has been messing up all day, they are probably still sleeping back there&#34; which made me want to leave immediately.  He said the food would be out &#39;I think probably in about 5 minutes for sure&#34; ??

Finally received breakfast one hour after ordering it and it was correct. It was eggs, bacon, toast for me and waffle w syrup for my friend.  Nothing worth waiting an hour for.  

4.  After consuming the meal, the server came back to tell us that he was leaving soon, that the restaurant closes from noon to 2pm on Sundays (??) to prep for dinner.  I guess this is a Supper Club now but they are open at 9 - noon on Sundays...maybe this is why people aren&#39;t here, they don&#39;t get the hours and the concept.  He said we could stay as long as we wanted, which we did, but we won&#39;t be able to get anything until the restaurant reopened at 2:00. 

My suggestion to this restaurant - 1.  update the decor - people want to eat good food in a pleasant atmosphere that does not smell musty 2.  upgrade the service and cook staffs - teach your servers to be mindful of the customer, help them understand the menu, remind them they are &#34;servers&#34;.  and 3. market yourself the way this restaurant used to so that you can bounce back, attract new and existing customers - otherwise it does not appear you&#39;ll be in business much longer and that would be very sad.",03/08/14,250,1,1,3,8,2.2858,1.118,0.571,16.311999999999998,No,2281

Entree: I had the pot roast - it was very tender and pulled apart so easily. It was served with vegetables, garlic mashed potatoes and gravy that helped offset the slight dryness to the meat.

I&#39;ve lived in the area majority of my life and I&#39;ve never been to Millrose before this past weekend.  My experience was by far the worst experience I&#39;ve ever had.  We reserved a section upstairs to celebrate my aunt turning 50, to be notified when the party arrived that they were going to sit us in the back of the restaurant instead.  The host did not escort our party to the table, he simply told us our table was in the back of the restaurant and pointed.  The funny thing is everyone else that walked into that establishment was escorted to their table.

Our server was notified of our displeasure and told &#34;management&#34; (I use that term very loosely) and instead of coming to speak with us the &#34;manager&#34; sent out three free appetizers.  In an effort to make my aunt&#39;s big day joyful we disregarded the rude service we&#39;ve received and ordered dinner.  We ordered the prime rib, roasted chicken and a pasta dish with red sauce.  The prime rib was awful.  We&#39;ve been to Gibson&#39;s and other steakhouses before and have had prime rib before, but this meat that was served was just absolutely awful.  We asked that the server please send &#34;management&#34; to our table and replace the Prime Rib meals with roasted chicken.

One of the waitresses found it appropriate to yell across the restaurant that there was no more chicken and that she was going to have the chef cook the steak longer.  The temperature of the meat wasn&#39;t the problem, it was the taste or lack there of.  After not being accommodated and growing more and more angry we asked again for the &#34;manager&#34; and to remove the prime rib meals from our bill and to bring out the birthday cake that we brought to the establishment for my aunt.  We were then told that it would cost $1 per slice to cut our cake.  Needless to say we opted to use a knife at the table and cut our own cake, but we couldn&#39;t do that because the &#34;manager&#34; came and put the icing on the cake of ruining our joyous moment.  She came to the table very rude and defensive of our displeasure with her establishment and the food.  She proceeded to act very inappropriately in front of her two assistant managers and spoke in a very condescendingly to the party.  

Instead of coming to the table with apologies and solutions.  She came, I don&#39;t know about an hour after she heard our first complaint and continued to say this was all a mishap because we were all confused about what Prime Rib was.  My aunt and I proceeded to tell her she was being rude and also let her know why we were displeased with the service we had received.  We gave her examples and again her remarks were inappropriate excuses.  We didn&#39;t yell, never rose our voice, didn&#39;t speak an ounce of Ebonics or vulgar language.  That didn&#39;t stop the &#34;manager&#34; from getting riled up, she asked us to hurry and finish up so we could get out, told us to contact her boss and it didn&#39;t matter if we did because she was the VP.  She and assistants then left the table to call the Barrington police on us.

I rarely use the race card, but I can say as of that night I know what it looks like to be racially discriminated against.  I would have received a better meal and service at Ihop across the street.  When we left this HORRIBLE place we had dinner and laughed at the comedians on stage at the Schaumburg Improv.

I&#39;m not even going to mention how my Prime Rib order wasn&#39;t taken because they ran out. This happens, but the chef didn&#39;t get that news to our waitress until 20 minutes after we ordered.  I don&#39;t get it. You have x pounds of prime rib.  You have two size orders.  You have computers the waitresses enter the orders into. Order goes in, subtracts the order from the remaining inventory, if greater than what&#39;s left... Reject.  Annoying.

If I&#39;m around and hungry, I&#39;d consider, but I am no longer going out of my way to eat here again.  In fact, I may just try the place across the street if in the area next time, they seem to get good reviews.

I always liked the beer samplers and basic bar burger food, but thought it was a little pricey for a big piece of meat that I probably don&#39;t want and if it was really a special occasion I probably wouldn&#39;t go THERE, but not bad for the burbs, AND well located off the tollway and Barrington Road. So when we had some company in town, who I know often goes for the big piece of meat, I thought of Millrose. Of course we show up so late on a Thursday night at 8:59 (found out LATER the kitchen closes at 9). You could tell the pretty hostess wasn&#39;t thrilled but SHE was leaving as soon as she seated us, and then everything was very good. Alfredo was our happy to see us server and did a great job with everything, including a couple good BYOB bottles, $15 corkage, no problem, and we were LATE.

We had everything from fajitas to ribs, greek chicken &amp; a panko pork schnitzel, and it was all very good. Quietly perfectly served, decent fries and salad/sides.

So we are moving them up from the &#34;beautiful day OUTDOOR burger&#34; forgotten list to the &#34;late snowy lunch or dinner by the fireplace&#34;.

While the menu was diverse, it was extremely over-priced. Trying to compete near Morton&#39;s or Ruth&#39;s Chris prices, I expect more. The steak was tough and not quality. I believe the Mahi-Mahi was the cause of my violent &#34;rejection&#34; last night; however, I am not a clinician. 

As noted earlier, drinks were over-priced as well.

This is definitely a place that appeals to older folks: when we walked in the door, everyone in the lobby was at least 80 years old -- it was like you had to be on Medicare to get on the waiting list for a table. I felt positively like an infant next to this crowd.

Once we got past God&#39;s Waiting Room, we were seated in a large, dark dining room. This place is very large overall, lots of seating but not a lot of light. 
Our waitress was middle-aged, brisk and peppy, and had clearly worked there for a while. She gave us time with the lunch menu, which consisted largely of salads, sandwiches and burgers. 

I chose the Mini Trio, three sliders composed of different fillings: seared beef and onions; pulled BBQ pork; and crab cake with remoulade. The crab was good; the sauce on the pork was too sweet, and the beef had a good taste but was tough (I had a hard time ripping it apart with my teeth; not very successful as a burger). The fruit cup that came with it was good (particularly the pineapple), and the cream of mushroom soup I ordered (the Soup du Jour) was excellent. 

My grandmother&#39;s friend (who&#39;d picked the restaurant) had said the place was known for pork, but I didn&#39;t really see it reflected too much in the menu, until we went to the &#34;country store&#34;. This was more than just a Cracker-Barrel-type shop; they had meat-to-go in here (ribs! steaks! bacon! more!), plus gourmet goods of all kinds, an impressive selection of wine, and then various gifty items (my mom bought a pretty necklace -- not exactly what you&#39;d expect in a place that also sells bulk bacon). 

People clearly know this shop well -- again, this was the week of Christmas, and they were stuffed into the shop, going for the meat in particular. We filed past the cooler with the pork in it and it was full of  packs of thick-cut bacon; when we walked back 10 minutes later a guy was stuffing every package (at least 6 or 7) into his basket! I bought some of the thin-sliced (not being a fan of thick-cut bacon -- I guess I&#39;d have been out of luck anyway, though!) and made some the next day; it had a great, maple-y scent and a woodsy flavor. They definitely know what they&#39;re doing with the pork! 

Though I might not rush back to the restaurant, I&#39;d certainly swing into the store the next time I&#39;m in the Schaumburg area. Millrose meat can&#39;t be beat!",27/12/10,304,3,1,5,-25,6.7284,2.7480000000000007,0.178,20.074000000000005,No,2496

They up-sold us to the rib-eye which is the same cut of beef but at at twice the price.  The steaks are Choice grades - not the better graded Prime cuts that most steak houses in the city offer.

They seemed like they were just boiled and then some ketchup thrown on them and stuck in an oven. Not very tasty. I barely at 1/4 of the slab. My daughter had the chicken franciese which was good, but waaaaaay overpriced. It was $20 for this dish and the portion was small. We also ordered the fried calamari which was breaded with cornmeal. Although the calamari was very tender, it had no crisp whatsoever and was served in a small soup bowl and then sat in the grease so it made it even soggier. These were priced at 9.95 again, for a tiny portion that weren&#39;t even worth 1/2 that. My husband opted for the burger. It was good. We were told that their &#34;steak burger&#34; consists of the scraps from all of their meats which are thrown together and then ground down for their burger. Ewww!

I feel like I should only review this place if I had a full meal here, but oh well, still gonna rate my drink experience here.

First of all, drinks are WAY expensive here.  I was not expecting to dish out $9 for a martini here--I know that can be a typical price for a martini in the burbs, but this isn&#39;t a fancy place to me.  I feel like $9 for a martini should be spent at a steakhouse where they are going to use top shelf liquor, not Smirnoff.

Anyway, we were not directly at the bar, we were seated at the little tables and our waitress was just terrible.

Wednesday night, 7:30, we were one of maybe three parties in the place. And we *still* had slow service. Greeted by a waitress we never saw again. Had to walk from our table in the bar to the actual bar to get a beer.

Finally, on a Saturday afternoon we decided to make a special trip to try the beer at this place that proclaimed itself a brewery on the sign by the street.

The atmosphere was nice. The hostess sat us inside by a window as we requested. There were also nice tables outside in a shaded courtyard, but we preferred to observe from air conditioned comfort.

The first thing we asked the waiter was of course what beers they had on tap. There was no beer menu with detailed descriptions of the beers as I am accustomed to seeing at places that brew their own beer.
The waiter quickly went through the list:
pale ale, pilsner, amber ale, dark lager... commercial brew #1... I stopped him there to save time.

It was interesting that he described the dark lager as being &#34;not too heavy even though it is dark&#34;. My hopes were starting to sink at this point, because it started to look like this was not a beer lovers place.

I ordered the amber ale and my wife chose the dark lager. They were both served in tall pilsner glasses.

There was no noticeable aroma as I brought the glass to my nose. My first sip of the amber ale left me disappointed, but that wasn&#39;t my final judgment. I soldiered on and kept trying it. I wanted to like it, but there just wasn&#39;t any flavor to this beer. The watery character and carbonation reminded me of the typical macro brews, although this beer was amber colored rather than the typical macro yellow.

At the same time, my wife was having a similar experience with the dark lager. I tried her beer as well (just for research purposes of course) and I was surprised at how similar it tasted to my amber ale. Other than a slightly more bitter flavor, I would be hard pressed to tell them apart in a blind taste test.

We gave up on the beer at this point. We just didn&#39;t have any confidence that the other two choices were going to be significantly better than what we had already tried.

While all this disappointing beer tasting was going on we did order food. The macaroni and cheese with crab and asparagus was very tasty and was served at a good temperature. We paired that with a lemon oregano chicken wrap. The wrap was fair, but the flavor was very mild for something with lemon and oregano in it.

I am unlikely to return to Millrose any time soon. The beer was extremely disappointing to me. The food was pretty good, but a little on the expensive side.

So my wife and a couple of our friends ended up at the Millrose after visiting Goebert&#39;s Farm.  Although we all dress funny and we&#39;re from the big scary city, we know how to act in public.  

We ended up here because there were few options that weren&#39;t totally disgusting, such as the IHOP down the street.  We thought it was going to be a little less classy and little more... Cracker Barrel. Come on, they have a country store.  You&#39;d make the same mistake.

When we walked in, we realized this was the type of place grandparents go on wedding anniversaries and people visit after services at Willow Creek.  Whatever, we like food and we all have jobs and we&#39;re productive members of society, despite being a little goofy looking.  We were seated and our waitress was less than pleased that she had to serve us.  When I&#39;m in this situation, where I know I&#39;m being judged, I tend to be really polite and out going.  Kill the stereotype that punks are shitty people.  

We all order burgers, not because it was the cheapest thing on the menu, but because holy crap, the burgers have cranberries on them.  The waitress was really bummed that we got burgers and cokes, rather than entrees and drinks.  Sorry, half our group was straight edge and I didn&#39;t feel like drinking.  

The burger was fan-freakin&#39;-tastic.  Perfectly cooked on PUMPERNICKEL.  Seriously, that&#39;s why this place got stars.  The bill came and instead of putting the $100.00 bill on our card and collect the cash, we asked our waitress to put the difference on our card.  Yeah, it&#39;s a pain in the ass and if you don&#39;t want to do it, say so.  We&#39;ll be big kids and suck it up and deal.  Nope, she takes the pile of money and our card, comes back with a smaller pile of money and our card.  Not noticing that the pile-o-cash was shorter, we look at the receipt and realize she put the whole bill on our card.  No big deal, we&#39;re adults.  We&#39;ll make the trip to the bank with the cash.  Whatever.  What we realize on our drive home, that our waitress had possibly pocketed a chunk-o-cash, because there was less in hand than what our friends contributed.  

Here&#39;s the thing, I don&#39;t stiff people on tips.  No matter how good or bad the service is.  Really, the service was alright, despite disapproving looks from waitress.  The atmosphere was even cozy.  But don&#39;t pocket money as a tip without asking.  Especially after you mention that you added an 18% gratuity.  Had you played ball, you would have gotten 20%, or we would have even left you a couple bucks, despite the added gratuity.  

If that&#39;s how they do business, well, I&#39;d say I&#39;ll never go there again, but seriously, when am I going to end up in Barrington?

The place was pretty busy thus we were seated in their banquet hall.  We were eating on a plastic fold out table and chairs that could have been taken out from a high school cafeteria.  The rest of the place looked really nice.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come back for the food, maybe just to have a couple beers in the bar.

The food was sub par I had the Tilapia with crab and mozzarella cheese on top.  All I could taste was the cheese and who knows maybe it wasn&#39;t Tilapia because I couldn&#39;t taste it!  

The good news is, is that all of their beers were from my favorite Illinois brewery.  Two Brothers!!  I was able to order a beer for my entire family which I think they enjoyed more than the food.",04/05/11,81,2,2,2,15,1.9690000000000003,1.098,0.203,8.699,No,791

I started off with a mixed drink. I had a Long Island Iced Tea. It was over priced and weak. For my entree, I had the ribs. Again over priced. It just wasn&#39;t good at all. It tasted like they were boiled and baked. Way too tender. The meat fell off the bone and you were able to swallow it without chewing. The meat was complete mush. The coleslaw was just nasty. Dessert was the Kahlua Lava Cake. It didn&#39;t taste like there was any Kahlua in it. For my wife and I, the bill was $90.00. I want a refund!

We came back a few years ago (because I had a entertainment coupon, or restaurant.com or some such) and it was disappointing. It was so expensive for okay food. Bummer. And they tried to argue about my coupon. However... I wrote the restaurant and the manager was very apologetic and sent me a gift card... so we tried again. Three drinks in the bar... $25 gift card.... $27 for the drinks. Really? Agh!

Fast forward to last month. Four of us stopped in for a cocktail after dining out at Wildfire in Schaumburg. The bar was not very crowded...at all. There was a band (blues mostly) and we really enjoyed them. We also enjoyed the fact that they had $4 margaritas and decent priced upscale beers. 8 drinks for under $40... nice. We didn&#39;t eat, so I can&#39;t comment, but it was nice to see they had some reasonable specials. 

The upper balcony area and side area in the bar were closed off (as is cloth draping) which was weird.... made it feel small in there. It&#39;s such a large, beautiful, ski-lodge feeling place usually. I guess I might give it one last try since they are regularly on restaurant.com (which usually says something in my book) for dinner. I do remember loving their french lamb chops (just not the greasy potato side dish that accompanied it). I know they were supposed to be famous for their meats (pork particularly?) but I gotta say, I make better ribs.... any day. Not sure if that&#39;s still their forte, but it never should have been.

So, what you really go for is the atmosphere... ski-lodge, fireplaces, lots of wood. I&#39;m holding my opinion on the food until we try dinner again.",28/01/13,229,2,2,5,48,5.3188,3.755,1.6320000000000003,21.612999999999996,No,1780

I remember this place as crazy busy where you needed reservation to get a table. I also remember fantastic selection of food. 
Let me tell you - this was nothing like what I remember! Place was almost empty at ten in the morning on Sunday. But I am not surprised - the food was just what you would expect in a cheap neighborhood diner - very limites selection and completely nothing worth mentioning. No choices for people on any kind of diet, two bagel choices, nothing you would consider healthy. But the icing on the cake was the price - it was ridiculously high - even though we had nothing from the special menu - just plain smorgasboard serve yourself deal - we got charged like for a fancy dinner in a fancy restaurant - I certainly got a sticker shock when it came to paying.

It wasn&#39;t really &#34;stellar&#34;, but it was acceptable enough that you&#39;re not forcing yourself to eat.

The one thing I did enjoy was that they will make you omelettes any way you want, on the spot. That is something I enjoy, as rudimentary as it is.

We sat in their outside/porch area... the sun was in our eyes for about 10 minutes, but then it was quite pleasant. The awning works, but the umbrella tables don&#39;t have tilting umbrella, or staff who knows how to tilt them, so for an hour or two before sunset, you should be careful which table you accept.

Our waiter was friendly and made good suggestions about his &#34;Top 3&#34; favorites from the menu. A manager, I assume, tried to come over and strike up a conversation with us, but we were kind of deep in our own at the time... but points for trying, I guess.

I had a Fish and Chips (Friday special) which was really good... and I&#39;m happy to report that it kept me from feeling starved for the next 12 hours (fasting for some blood work the next morning). We also had the Pot Roast, a Ribs &amp; Chicken plate, a burger and I think the Prime Rib. Everyone enjoyed their meal quite a bit.

We were fairly full, but decided to get a few of their &#34;mini&#34; desserts anyway, and they were really excellent. I know one was a vanilla creme brulee, but I did not try that, as I believe it disappeared before I could.

It&#39;s all wood decor, with so many different levels, which makes it nice and cozy.   The second thing was &#34;it&#39;s Saturday dinner time.  Where is everyone?&#34;  We had a large group, about 30 people, but didn&#39;t need to worry about a reservation.  They could&#39;ve fit five more of our groups in there without worry, it was that empty.

Then we got the menus.  I wish I&#39;d taken my hostess&#39; advise and checked this out on the website before I came, because I was not expecting the prices for a place so far out in the suburbs.  There were very few dishes under around $25, and this did not seem to be the sort of place to justify the expense.  The menu wasn&#39;t very extensive, and while there seemed to be one of each kind of dish (with a more extensive steak menu), if you didn&#39;t want to spent $25+ for your meal your options were VERY limited.  I pretty much had to choose between a burger, a pasta dish, or the tilapia.  The description of how they prepared the tilapia sounded bland, but the pork sounded yummy, with an apple glaze, pecans, a sweet potato, and vegetables.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t like pork.  So, at my request, and to their credit (although I got disapproving stares from the waitress and she asked me several times if I was sure), they gave me the tilapia with the pork glaze on the side to give it more flavor (unfortunately, they forgot the pecans).   The resulting tilapia was pretty decent, but the sweet potato was tiny and, along with the vegetables, surprisingly flavorless.  I&#39;ve had far better elsewhere, and for less money.  And MUCH better service.

On top of the meal, I had a gin and tonic.  That is the most I&#39;ve ever paid for a G&amp;T, despite the fact that I&#39;m often at clubs in the city, and it was in a tiny glass.  Also, when I asked the waitress if she would recommend a white or red wine with my meal, she had no idea.  She was nice, but definitely would&#39;ve fit in more with a breakfast diner than a $30+ per plate restaurant in the suburbs.

So, bottom line... Overpriced far-west suburban restaurant with great atmosphere, okay food, expensive drinks, and mediocre service.  Just a few miles east, there are far better restaurants that, despite their location, have better prices and more extensive menus.",01/07/12,273,2,2,5,16,7.511400000000002,3.87,0.97,18.160000000000004,No,2369

The restaurant has a warm, cozy feel to it and seems wholesome and family oriented. 
The food is very Americana. Its the kind of food an American mom would make for you but upgraded. They also have a great selection of drinks. 

However, for the prices, I was expecting a bit more of a presentation of the food. I ordered the tilapia but you&#39;d never know it from just looking at it. It just seemed like everything was thrown on the plate-my sauce was running everywhere. The Tilapia was buried under the sauce, crab meat and cheese. It seemed the same with the other dishes my guests had. In their defense, I guess it does play to the &#34;feel at home&#34; theme. Though, the quality of the food did seem alright.

My boyfriend and I both got the burgers and she didn&#39;t even know which temperature was which. We had to send back the one because it wasn&#39;t medium rare, but more medium well. She then brings it back and says I think it is much closer to medium now. Uh what? Well that would be fine if medium was the temperature we ordered. We didn&#39;t want to deal with it so we just shut our mouth and ate it. Burgers sucked, the appetizers weren&#39;t anything special. Overall blah.

I put in for reservations earlier in the day, and got seated right away.  It wasn&#39;t very busy at this point, but our server took some time to get our drink orders.  After our drinks were served, the server mentioned that we were going to be served by someone else that would take our food order.  15 minutes after our drinks came in, our food order had finally been taken by the new server.  By this point, we were starving.

My girlfriend had the Top Sirloin and I had the Cajun Chicken Penne.  The Cajun Chicken Penne was fantastic!  It was a tangy combination of penne pasta, andouille sausage, well-prepared chicken and a great sauce.  As for my girlfriend, the food was great, but they did not give her the Bearnaise sauce that was supposed to be with the steak.  And of all things, a steak knife wasn&#39;t given with the plate.  The butter-knife hardly made a dent, so after waiting a while for our waiter to swing by, we just asked a nearby busboy for a steak knife.

Overall, the food and drinks were really enjoyable.  The reoccurring problem just seemed to be the service on this particular night.  We did get comped a round of beers after the server noticed our small frustrations, so it was nice to see that they noticed and cared about the customer.

My wife and her mother,my daughter and a close friend went to this establishment on the night of the snow storm February 10, 2012.  We traveled an hour and a half for the entertainment that was offered that night along with a limited menu, wine included.  We had no idea what the food was going to be like.  We were pleasently surprized to find that the beef shortribs and the olive,artichoke stuffed chicken breast were 5 star quality.  The wine chosen to fit the meal was excellant.  The Millrose had this event in a private diningroom, but I was able to see the main room and the bar as we entered the establishmnet.  Cozy describes this place, sound does not travel far in their rooms. The bar was interesting to say the least.  The private room was complete with fireplace and deck out for Valentines Day.  Our friend said that it reminded her of a Vale Colorado ski lodge, mountain rustic I would call it.  It was very pleasent to me.  The staff were exceptional and more than willing to please in their service. I have no qualms about recomending this establishment for its food and circuses.  The entertainment that night was Opera and Love Songs by Diva Montell and Jerge Holmes.  The food and entertainment were worth that horrible drive in the winter storm.  We were all glad we attended this event.

I did notice a Country Store attached to this restaurant.  It was closed, but I think it would be worth the trip to check it out.  I have read the other reviews and beg to disagree with them.  I have no reason to doubt others experience here, so the likely situation is that this restaurant has improved its self and deserves a second look for them and a first look for those of you who have never been here to eat and drink.

I have never heard anything good about this place. I was &#34;delighted&#34; when I was taken here against my will. 

It was post-lunchtime, on a Saturday. There could not have been more than 10 other people in there. The hostess was busy talking to someone about how she needed her break, while we were ignored for a few minutes. We were seated, eventually, and had plenty of time to peruse the short, uninteresting menu. 

I decided on the ELEVEN dollar club. I was delirious and overheated....please cut me some slack. 

The server was adequate. Nothing more, nothing less. 

This eleven dollar joke of a club sandwich comes to the table. Tomato slices so thick you wonder if they just cut the stem and halved the darn thing...2 foot stacks of lettuce, uneven piles of not-great-turkey, and ONE piece of bacon....TOTAL. I am sorry, the word bacon got me, not bacos. Please, dont try to sprinkle a dash of bacos or beggin strips or what ever that was on a sammich and call it bacon. No. 

Dry bread. No offer of mustard, or mayo, or even a warning that this &#34;artisan&#34; bread will be so dry that it will julienne slice your esophagus. Sweet. 

There were 10 or so french fries on my plate. They were good. Go figure.

We&#39;ve been on a mission to only eat at places we haven&#39;t been to yet, so we decided to have the Sunday brunch. I drive by this place all the time and a lot of people in my family love it, so we figured, why not. What is it with hostesses lately who are too busy to look up and greet you? Uh, this is your job! I don&#39;t expect a red carpet roll out or anything, but how about a nice &#34;Hi! How ya doin&#39;?&#34; when I approach the hostess stand? I swear! We seriously waited at least a minute until we were even acknowledged and it wasn&#39;t like there was a ton of people waiting to be sat. 

The atmosphere was country farm house. This seems like a place with mostly older clientele. We were seated overlooking the outdoor patio and it looked really nice. Lots of fireplaces in here....I bet it would be nice when it&#39;s cold outside. 

The food was average at best. I know when we go to an all you can eat buffet, our expectations are low, but come on! At least keep the food looking nice when the tray is half empty! There was just one guy overlooking the whole room and he was also the meat slicer at the carving station which had ham and turkey.

There was a toaster they put out with a bread basket and some of their homemade jellies and a platter of lox, which I always look forward to, but it was all slimy and looked like it had been sitting out a long time. There was also oatmeal, a lot of fresh fruit and boxes of cold cereal and the pastry table of which nothing even looked good. I tried a &#34;cannoli&#34; and it was soggy and sad.

I have to admit, being a beer guy, I was a little disappointed to find out they no longer brewed their own beer (it had been a couple years since we had been there), however, the rest of our experience made up for that.  My wife and I waited in the bar area for the rest of our party to show up.  They had some sort of special going on, so there were a few people waiting in the host area.  We thought we&#39;d get a drink and wait for everyone.  We were greeted by Allfredo, the friendly bartender.  The bar wasn&#39;t too busy, so we chatted at the bar for awhile, and Allfredo mixed up some great dirty martinis, with bleu cheese olives, my wife&#39;s favorite.  After the rest of our party showed up, we were escorted to the table, which was in a perfect location, away from most of the patrons. We had the pork tacos and the sampler platter as appetizers, and everyone thought the tacos were unique and tasty.  For our entrees, I ordered the pork chop, and it was divine!  My wife had the whitefish, and had plenty left over for the next day.  My in-laws had the ribs, and they said they were some of the best (although I didn&#39;t get a chance to try them).

The bar tender was very friendly and let me sample a few drinks before buying it.  I also enjoyed some of the live music being played in the background, set a nice vibe.

For food I ordered the sampler platter of appetizers  (forget the exact name).  Overall food wise, I was not too impressed.  The only thing I liked on the platter were the potato skins, everything else was either too dry or did not have enough flavor.  I was especially disappointed with the ribs.

Despite the food experience, I would definitely come back here again and try another meal.",18/08/10,82,4,1,3,5,2.8158000000000003,1.5279999999999998,0.644,6.828,No,763

Maybe my recent move to the Chicago area is giving me sticker shock at the prices of eating out here.  The lunch menu is essentially the dinner menu. They have a breakfast buffet when we were there on Sunday. But we wanted to eat the real fare so we opted for the dinner menu instead.

The ambiance of the Millrose is rich and cozy. And the patio is charming. Wicker chairs sit facing each other by the fireplace. There&#39;s even piano music on Friday and Saturday nights, according to their literature.

Prices start at $9 for appetizers. We had the Taste of Millrose appetizers that contain 3 coconut shrimp (not bad), Italian sausage and bratwurst (nicely herbed and flavored), meatballs, spicy wings, ribs, potato skins, and onion straws. It&#39;s definitely a good sampling of what Millrose has to offer. 

Our table had the jumbo lump crab cakes served with roasted pepper-corn relish and spicy remoulade sauce. The presentation is pretty and the crab cakes delectable. But not the best I&#39;d eaten. I thought Ted&#39;s Montana Grill&#39;s was better. 

The husband had the Rose&#39;s Ribs and Chicken. He opted for the bbq chicken instead of the herb-roasted chicken. He enjoyed both. And we all loveddddd the mashed potatoes. A little lumpy and oh so smooth.

I had the pot roast. I wasn&#39;t too excited when I tasted the tomato-based jus. It must be a regional flavor. I&#39;d never had pot roast cooked in this manner until arriving here. Ritzy&#39;s had the same treatment to their pot roast. But I was willing to overlook that and dissect the rest of the pot roast. The meat was tender and flavorful. You can certainly tell the difference between their meat and the hormon-injected ones sold at supermarkets. The sauce has hints of a good red wine. The carrots are hit or miss, in terms of texture. For $20, it was steep. 

Eating at the Millrose is not cheap, and I won&#39;t be returning anytime soon because of that. I may, however, be picking some of their meats at the country store should the husband and I plan to indulge in a good cookout at home.

*Photos shot

It&#39;s a great experience. Just be prepared to spend.

Foremost, they are NOT a brewery, a fact which would have deterred me from purchasing the gift certificate to begin with.    

Given my apprehensions, the food was better than I expected, but still decidedly NOT very good, especially at this price.  Sampled fare was a smoked pork chop special and the burger.  Given it&#39;s origin in meat-packing, I was kind of surprised that the burger was as flat as it was.  The smoked pork chop was juicy and flavorful, but that burger was just sad (in addition to not being cooked as requested).

On the other hand, the space (especially the bar)  was well decorated with autumnal stuff and they feature other microbrews on the menu, just not their own.  I might consider it a place for a big event.

If I lived in the area and didn&#39;t have other actual breweries or places for great meat / ambiance I would go back.  But for now I consider it to be a case of bate &amp; switch :(",30/09/09,108,2,2,1,22,0.9718000000000002,1.054,0.651,8.295,No,1021
millrose-south-barrington,Bill G.,EYJ7QoGr8sQxc8G7QaH2AQ,SI9fROvew5TqXGY-Ls4ZXA,"I agree with Bill T and Brian&#39;s review . What happened to this place? This used to be a great spot to eat a few years back. We wanted a nice dinner after my son&#39;s graduation and I thought of Millrose.

 When I worked out this way, I&#39;d eaten here both for lunch and dinner. They had great food, a friendly busy bar and the place was packed. We get here on a Sunday late afternoon/early evening and there&#39;s nobody eating in the place. I had thought we might have had to wait for a table.

We get a meager paper type of menu and I don&#39;t even see the roast pork dinner that they were known for. The breadholder is cute and dainty but only held about 5 pieces of bread and there were six of us and hungry, so as we ordered drinks and appetizers I asked for  more bread when he bought the drinks. My ex-wife also asked him for bread as well, not having heard me ask....she&#39;s learned to tune me out long ago. Anyway, back he comes with the drinks - no bread. I asked him about it and he replied. &#34;Oh, you&#39;d like more bread?&#34; Now the kid was nice, but he wasn&#39;t very competent. Besides that he was giving each person the others drink. It happens sometimes, but not a great sign.

 The calamari appetizer was good but tiny. We had some kind of chorizo taco thing which was actually bland. How do you make chorizo bland?
I saw that they offered prime rib blackened which I&#39;ve had at other places, and it can be very good. When it came, it was a flat piece of shoe leather. I&#39;m serious now. If someone told me that they had accidentally cooked their shoe and put it on my plate I would have believed it. I asked for it medium rare and it was well well well done - toast. He explained that it was due to me ordering it blackened. Apparently th chef didn&#39;t study in Paris, as I explained the process. Honestly, I&#39;m 59 years old and that;s the first time I remember sending a dish back immediately. To their credit, they brought me out a new one (unblackened per my new request) in like two minutes. It was satisfactory. My daughter asked that the giardanera for her spicy chicken sandwich be on the side, but nope. It was plopped right on it. My son and ex-wife said their chicken dinner was not bad except for the stuffing.

IMy son and I saw the pistachio cake with gelato dessert and we ordered it. My daughter had the carrot cake and enjoyed it, but neither me or my son could finish the cardboard that was our dessert. How do you screw up gelato? It tasted like they gave us a wax demo model.

My only thought after this was....very obviously different owners from what I remember. It was a huge disappointment on a special occasion. I prefer to write the kind reviews, but I hope to save some other poor soul from a bad evening.",16/06/11,312,1,3,5,55,5.935100000000002,5.134000000000001,2.133,32.73400000000001,No,2777
millrose-south-barrington,Brian T.,s27jE4a1oocwgqIdTt1gWA,xd0TtaKOUJT55mhi8YNd_A,"Once upon a time, this place was an upscale gem of a restaurant.  I went there a lot when I was younger, but then my family stopped going.  We went, probably for the first time in 5 years, for old times sake for my mother&#39;s birthday.

I&#39;m probably still too angry to write a coherent review, so I will simply relay my experience.  Keep in mind this was early on a monday night and we were probably one of ten tables in the restaurant. 

The experience was as follows:
6:00: Arrive for reservation and our group of 6 is seated at a huge circular table that should have seated 10-12.
6:10 waitress takes drink orders, runs away before entrees can be ordered.
6:25  drinks come to the table, entrees are ordered
6:50 salad arrives
7:10 entrees arrive
7:50 waitress finally picks up and returns check

We were seated right outside of the kitchen door (yet another terrible choice given that we could have been seated anywhere in the restaurant) so I don&#39;t know where the waitress was hiding.  

This is why we had stopped coming before, and why I will never go again (if a manager read this review today and called me to offer a free repeat dinner I would decline).  Food was good, not great, and the ambiance was a pleasant upscale rustic.  So I had to give it more than 1 star.

There were only 2 other groups. Our reservations were for 5pm. They had us wait so they could set us up at a different table since we were early. Not sure why when the place was empty. We only saw 2 other groups come in by the time we left.
So let&#39;s start with the seating, there were 8 of us. They put us at a long table that seated 10. One side was a booth type set up so those that were there had to get up and move all 4 of us to let the first one in , out! Not very accomodating for chatting.
The appetizers they brought to to the table, crudites, were dried out. The radishes looked like there were there for days, even brown around the edges. I didn&#39;t taste the bread.
Equally disappointing was the food. Not worth the higher end prices. I had parmesan crusted chicken. The meal came with soup or salad, I chose salad. Nothing to write home about. The garlic mashed potatoes were good however there portion was huge! The food order seemed to take way too long (we were there over 2 hours). I will say there menu was not impressive. Maybe thats why it took us so long, everyone was trying to decide what to have since it consisted of a legal sized one sided menu.

We enjoyed the decor and our waitress was friendly, however, there were alot of things that turned me off about this place. First off- the rest rooms are located right off of a main hallway that leads to where our table was. The entire time we were there, there was a STRONG odor of poop wafting through the hallway. It was absolutely disgusting. When I got up to actually use the bathroom, it was so intensely awful smelling that it reminded me of a very full cat&#39;s litter box that had been left I scooped for too long.  The food was not very good at all. Not horrible, but nothing special. The beer that they brought out in tasting glasses from their brewery was not very flavorful. A few were like a stronger version of a miller lite. All of them tasted like mildew. My husband thought that perhaps they weren&#39;t cleaning out the lines often enough. Either way, gross. This place is huge. It seems to go on forever and there is ample seating for hundreds of people. So here is what really sealed the deal and ensured that we would never return again. As we were getting ready to leave, a hostess (I&#39;m assuming that was her job title) approached our table and said, &#34;Hi, I don&#39;t usually do this but we&#39;ve had a group of people waiting for about half an hour now for this table&#34;. Are you kidding me. The place was empty! There were at least 60 other tables that these people could have been seated at. Not to mention, we werent even there for that long!

Wine list had decent selections. Seemed like the less expensive wines were marked up higher than more expensive ones. Some good values at higher end if you want a nicer wine. Coppola Rose was  wonderful dry Rhone style rose with our mussels.
We had no beer at the brewery.
The food:
Seafood chowder was nicely seasoned and not starched into sludge. But seafood was overcooked and chewy. Their version of Caesar salad wasn&#39;t so great. Canned artichoke hearts and seasoning of tomatoes didn&#39;t go well with the ordinary Caesar dressing.
Special was Prince Edward Island mussels. Outstanding! Tender, sweet mussels in herbal broth with scallions. The base of tomatoes and bread, my wife and I split over...she loved and I liked but thought it was a some unneeded flavors.

They&#39;ve closed down their outdoor bar (pity, it used to be a lot of fun!). Their &#34;re-configured&#34; bar/banquet hall area is terrible--dark, enclosed, feels unfriendly.

For many years, Millrose used to be one of our weekly spots for lunch, and for the occasional after work cocktail. After some management changes a couple of years ago, their food declined to sub-standard, their menu shrank, and their service was appalling. So, we vowed to never again step inside... Fast forward to today, Thought, &#34;well, it&#39;s been a couple of years, let&#39;s give Millrose another try...&#34; Here&#39;s the story of that experience:

It was 75 degrees outside, preferred to sit outside anyway, so we moved from the bar to the &#34;restaurant&#34; section to be seated alfresco. They did not honor their 1/2-priced appetizer special--apparently their &#34;computers&#34; were not programmed that way... Manager was a clown. Decent and attentive waitress service (until the end). Ironically, my friend tried to pay with credit card, but after a long wait and mounting attitude from the servers, we ended up going to the bar to pay with cash and then move on to the next establishment for dinner.

We did enjoy a 1/2-priced bottle of wine from their expensive wine list. The $28 dollar Pinot Noir was had for $14 (which usually retails for less than $12, so no favors, there).

There are many great restaurants in Chicagoland--this is not one of them. Save your bucks and go somewhere else!

There were only 2-3 tables and only one other one in our section. Two women and about 8 kids came in about 15 minutes after us. 

Our waitress was very attentive up until she took outlet order. She started tending to the other tables, never updated us on our food. Now, I was going to ask what the wait was but my boyfriend asked that I didn&#39;t...we got our food at 12:10. After the women and kids. The food arrived warm, I was upset and my boyfriend said &#34;It&#39;s okay&#34;...

My boyfriend asked for a well done steak, I like mine medium. On top of the steak being warm, it was medium. When the waitress came I told her what the order was and she stated that&#39;s what she asked for and she asked if we wanted another, I told her no. She told the manager who then came over and asked if our waitress offered to cook the steak longer?&#34; I stated &#34;yes,&#34; he said that he took the appetizers off of our order, which were onion rings and he apologized.

Atmosphere:  this is a very small cafe that has a mix of tables and booths.  It doesn&#39;t have much in the way of decorations, but it is a nice quiet feel to it.  It feels almost as if it wants to be a diner, but isn&#39;t that big.

Staff:  the staff was great!  I let him know I had never been there, so needed a little guidance on selecting and he did a great job letting me choose my food.

Food:  I had combo #1 which were a couple of hot dogs with fries and a drink.  The hot dogs and buns are nothing spectacular.  The condiments however were fresh and piled high on them.  The fries on the other hand were amazing!  They have to be just about the best fries I&#39;ve had!

grandos-itasca,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,CHd1wXhrPM5Fh2D6apzyUA,"Grando&#39;s Beef and Hot Dogs is your typical independently owned and operated Chicago style fast food eatery. Serving Hot Dogs, Burgers and Italian Beef sandwiches, the menu should be very familiar to most native Chicagoans. The inside of this particular eatery is fairly clean with a few tables on the inside, an R.C/ Nehi pop machine and a large counter with a menu board above it and a long grill where the food is prepared.

In visiting Grando&#39;s I was looking to add yet another location to my hot dog review list. I decided to order a hot dog along with a burger and fries combo. We&#39;ll go over the hot dog first. The hot dog I received came on a slightly dry non-poppy seed bun. The sausage itself was skinless and tasted like I would expect but the application of condiments here was a bit rough. There was a little too much mustard, and the dog was light on relish and onions by comparison. The pickle spear used was a tad on the sour side. On the plus side, the tomato used wasn&#39;t too soggy or too ripe. There wasn&#39;t any noticeable celery salt, nor any sport peppers on this hot dog. 

The burger I got also had a dry bun. In fact the bun had actually cracked a bit on the top. The burger meat itself was a bit on the greasy side with how it was grilled. I&#39;d say the meat was juicy and had a good flavor, but it didn&#39;t exactly knock my socks off. The condiments on the burger were fairly good but it&#39;s generally a far less delicate process than with a hot dog. The fries included were thin shoestring fries. They were crisp but didn&#39;t have a lot of potato paste in them. I&#39;d say they were a bit saltier than most fries.

Overall I wasn&#39;t too impressed with Grando&#39;s Beef and Hot Dogs. The prices were slightly higher than a lot of other fast food joints. I&#39;d say the burger was about average and the hot dog was a bit below average. I do wonder how they&#39;re storing their hamburger and hot dog buns as both of the ones I received were dry and cracking.  One other thing worth noting is that they appear to be closed on Sundays and only open from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM on Saturdays. Somewhat limited hours on the weekend which is a bit of an added inconvenience. Overall while my experience at Grando&#39;s wasn&#39;t terrible, the food was just slightly below average. This place is a borderline between two and three stars. The fact that both buns were dry,  is going to be the proverbial &#34;straw that broke the camels back&#34; and cause me to round them down to two stars.",13/02/13,278,2,1,1,-17,0.7197000000000002,0.7879999999999999,0.641,27.570999999999998,No,2537

however one day we went he was not working and we had someone different, unfortunately i can&#39;t remember his name. Our daughter likes to make a mess when we go to restaurants, and granted she is only 15 months. so she sits in a high chair and we normally let her have a cali roll or a veggie roll she feels like she is eating what we are. so naturally she destroys most of it and half always ends up on the floor. Now we are not those kind of parents to leave a big mess, so as we are finishing our meal i got down to clean up some of the stuff off the floor.

Each plate is color coded for price. Pink is $2, green is $4 as example. Most plates are $3 or more. Very few plates are $2 or less and not worth it. So unless you watch yourself it can add up quickly and be expensive.

Honestly I would recommend you go somewhere else that offers a $15 lunch or $20 dinner of all you can eat sushi. I&#39;ve been to places where the sushi is better and you can get a lot more for the price. 

This place is good if you plan not to eat a lot and you prefer to just taste-test different varieties. You may even find a few specials you can&#39;t find elsewhere.

We had to wait to be seated and were told 10 minutes. We ended up waiting about 25. Not usually a big deal but we had 2 two year olds and a 3 year old with us and they were ready to climb the walls by time we were seated. Probably more my fault than anything... Anyway... They don&#39;t really have waiters but the guy who took our drink order seemed less than pleased with our water choices and chocolate milk for the kids for whatever reason. But then it was time to eat.

The &#34;train&#34; service is such a great concept. I like it because you can try things without having to get a full roll. They have everything from soups and salads, to dessert. Obviously, sushi, sashimi, nigiri, and all of the above are there too, Rollin past your table making you eyeball more rolls as you&#39;re stuffing your face with one. It&#39;s almost anxiety driven, oh my god I&#39;m so full but look at that!!! **as I grab my 6th plate and add up my bill for the 25th time.** I love it.

I was missing out!  It&#39;s fun and a nice way to enjoy a variety without committing to a huge roll. Plus you get to see everything and view all the many options before committing to eat it.

All the items on the conveyor are clearly marked and list the ingredients as well, but the menus are also there and handy if you wear glasses or can&#39;t read the signs going by fast enough.  There are also charts at each seat indicating price levels of the different color-codes plates.  Was it the best sushi we&#39;ve ever had? No. But was it good? Absolutely!

I am not a sushi expert, so I will not attempt to critique the finer culinary details of the menu items themselves. that said, the menu offers a wide variety of raw and cooked choices, as well as a nice selection of appetizers to go along with the sushi. Of the latter, w have tried the Udon soup, calamari, fried mushrooms, and fried shumai (shrimp dumplings) - all were fantastic. 

The sushi can be ordered by the roll, or selected in 2 - 6 piece servings from the covered conveyor belt which passes each table; we chose to pick and choose from the rotating variety. Each type of sushi, side dish, or dessert that passes by is preceded by a sign explaining what it is for easy identification (a huge bonus for sushi newbies like me). I lost track of the numerous items we sampled, but I can say that all were fresh, well-presented, and very tasty.

The wide variety of small portions is one of my favorite features - it gives a chance to try lots of different things without committing to an entire roll (unless you choose to from the menu). The pricing structure for the belt items is quite simple as well - each plate is color-coded, and each color has a price. they count up your plates at the end (along with whatever menu items you may have ordered), and bill accordingly.

The restaurant was very clean, well-laid out, and has a contemporary and comfortable atmosphere. Service both times we went was wonderful - shout out to our latest server Sarah, who is professional, attentive, and very pleasant :)",27/03/16,196,4,2,5,37,4.9034,1.7419999999999998,0.109,10.149000000000001,No,1656

Like the shrimp appetizer I ordered off the menu. Or the glasses that were refilled regularly. Or that we controlled the pace of our meal. Beyond that, I was not planning my next visit here before we left.

The food is priced according to the color of each plate. And while there are many price points, trying two bites for $5 doesn&#39;t seem worth it to me. What if I don&#39;t like it? My hubby on the other hand was in heaven!  He just grabbed what he likes, stacked up his plates and made a dent in the weekly food budget. Somehow I thought this would be a reasonable meal. It wasn&#39;t. We were there at the end of lunch and right before dinner items started rolling out, so the selection wasn&#39;t great.

Enjoyed the Alaska roll with wasabi and ginger, the seaweed salad and an all-vegetable roll.  The Alaska roll was tasty, but I was surprised that the avocado had time to turn brown; I often order Alaska roll and eat it the following day and the avocado&#39;s not brown.

I special-ordered salmon sashimi through a waiter.  It tasted very defrosted.

First, this restaurant is based off their conveyer belt technology, where the food travels around the restaurant covered in a refrigerated tube. A variety of food will wiz past you, and they are priced based on the plate color. As you eat the dishes and stack up the plates, you will be billed accordingly. 

You also have the option to order off the menu. The menu has slightly larger rolls and hot foods. I always get a small salad and edamame.

I may regret saying this...but I think this location is even better than my homebase SS location in Rolling Meadows. It seems newer, bigger, cleaner, tons of staff, the food seems more fresh and more roll options overall.

I have been to the OG Sushi Station legitimately over 100 times so when I was house sitting 10 minutes away from the bigger, badder location I knew I had to give it a whirl! What I&#39;ve come to know of Sushi Station is it isn&#39;t the most amazing, most fresh sushi in the world but the conveyor belt sushi concept is just so uber cool! It&#39;s a cool place to take out of towners plus they have some very unique and random rolls. On top of all that, you don&#39;t have to get a huge $15 roll but instead can get 4 pieces on a plate for $3.25 - or whatever the price may be. I really love everything about the Sushi Station concept.

I wasn&#39;t surprised when I was met with a 25 minute wait on a Friday, waiting at Sushi Station seems the norm plus the parking lot was packed! 

My personal favorite of their rolls is the Hanako Roll packed with indulgent ingredients like cream cheese, imitation crab, terikyaki sauce and spicy mayo with some hanako crumbs to boot. The rolls are huge and can&#39;t fit in my tiny mouth but man are they good! If you&#39;re into a little sizzle, go for the spicy hanako roll! It left my lips tingling on fire.

At this location, I noticed they put more tuna, salmon, etc in their straight fish rolls than the other location and the fish was more fresh. Perhaps I went on a good day but they were on fire!

Other roll recommendations are the Philly (standard classic), Gozilla Roll (deep fried cream cheese, imitation crab &amp; salmon goodness) and Spicy Phoenix Roll (spicy tuna, tempura crumbs, spicy mayo &amp; masago - another that left my mouth praying for some milk). They actually had a ton of other rolls not on their menu that were pretty darn tasty. Another interesting little bit about this location is it seemed a third of the conveyor belt was filled with desserts! I saw way more desserts here than I&#39;ve ever seen at the RM location including an oreo dream bar that called me name and I resisted. It seemed to be super popular though because on first pass, there were about 8 of the Oreo dream bars and the next time the belt rolled around, they were all gone!

Got to be honest here - I like this location better than the Rolling Meadows Sushi Station!

Overall, Sushi Station has quite a bit going for it.  Fast, tasty food, great wait staff, and a nice decor.  I have been only twice and let me say, the first time was stellar.  The second visit...not so much.  

I ordered the Cajun Roll and it says online (2pcs) $2.25 and then when the bill comes it says $4.50 (3pcs).   I bring this to the attention of my great server, Chris, and I show him the online menu to dispute the price.  He goes to his manager (some lady in black standing around) and talks to her, then comes back and says that that&#39;s for the 2 pieces, and I had 3.  I told him that&#39;s fine, and asked if they would be willing to split the difference ($1.13) and he goes back and tries to negotiate on my behalf.  The Manager tells them to tell me that I need to pay closer attention as &#34;Prices and ingredients are subject to change without prior notice.&#34;.  Needless to say, at this point, I&#39;m pretty peeved. 

While I understand the card the manager played and realize she&#39;s well within her rights to point to that line, it doesn&#39;t instill any sense of loyalty in me to come back to here.  Good customer service would dictate that you would accommodate the customer, but there was none of that from the manager.  They explained that their host/web content manager didn&#39;t update the site on a regular basis.  I told them that in the digital age, where people check an online menu before coming in, they should probably get on that.  I will not be returning for the foreseeable future until this is remedied.

I will say, one of the staff members in white pulled me aside and really apologized to me and I told him I&#39;d be writing this review.  He was super nice.

The sashimi is hit or miss, sometimes being of an acceptable thickness and other times so thin it&#39;s almost transparent.

Overall, Sushi Station has quite a bit going for it.  Fast, tasty food, great wait staff, and a nice decor.  I have been only twice and let me say, the first time was stellar.  The second visit...not so much.  

I ordered the Cajun Roll and it says online (2pcs) $2.25 and then when the bill comes it says $4.50 (3pcs).   I bring this to the attention of my great server, Chris, and I show him the online menu to dispute the price.  He goes to his manager (some lady in black standing around) and talks to her, then comes back and says that that&#39;s for the 2 pieces, and I had 3.  I told him that&#39;s fine, and asked if they would be willing to split the difference ($1.13) and he goes back and tries to negotiate on my behalf.  The Manager tells them to tell me that I need to pay closer attention as &#34;Prices and ingredients are subject to change without prior notice.&#34;.  Needless to say, at this point, I&#39;m pretty peeved. 

While I understand the card the manager played and realize she&#39;s well within her rights to point to that line, it doesn&#39;t instill any sense of loyalty in me to come back to here.  Good customer service would dictate that you would accommodate the customer, but there was none of that from the manager.  They explained that their host/web content manager didn&#39;t update the site on a regular basis.  I told them that in the digital age, where people check an online menu before coming in, they should probably get on that.  I will not be returning for the foreseeable future until this is remedied.

I will say, one of the staff members in white pulled me aside and really apologized to me and I told him I&#39;d be writing this review.  He was super nice.

The sashimi is hit or miss, sometimes being of an acceptable thickness and other times so thin it&#39;s almost transparent.

I&#39;d been to the Rolling Meadows location and enjoyed it, but my girlfriend assured me the Elgin location was much better. So one Friday, rather than drive 40 minutes, we drove for an hour to get to Elgin.

Well, the location was certainly bigger. Almost three times bigger. That must be a good sign right?

Meeeehhhhhh. We got seated right away which was nice, with about 90 minutes left to go until close. Grab a couple plates off of the belt then...that was it. From our seat, we waited and waited, and for about 30 minutes at least all that went by was either dessert or nothing. What kind of experience is that?

I mean, sure, you can order off the menu, but I can do that anywhere. Desperate, I ordered some salmon nigiri. It came out practically frozen. Like, I could see ice crystals on it and it hurt to bite into. But, I was hungry, sucked it up, and finished it off.

I was disappointed. To the point where a couple weeks later I had a craving to go to the Rolling Meadows location just to make up for this visit.

sushi-station-elgin,Jenna B.,QdXPEZD3czagWcFjJ27kqw,TvJ-7mANuPKinRtqBtvDeQ,"Over spring break I got to go back home to Streamwood, Illinois and go eat at one of my favorite sushi places. I had not eaten there in so long and I thought this would be a perfect place to review. Sushi Station is one of the best, fast and easy sushi places near my hometown and I would definitely recommend it. If you are a sushi snob I would not recommend this place to you, because it is not super fancy and does not have the most expensive menu items. If you just love sushi or have never really tried it before this is a great place to start.

I think the coolest thing about this place is the revolving belt that goes throughout the entire restaurant and shows off all of the daily specials and sushi selections. You can then open it up right in front of you and grab the sushi you want! I love being able to pick and choose my own food and get it on my own time. The service is still really good, even with the self-serve rotating belt. During my last visit it was far more crowded in there than I had ever seen, and the wait-staff was still extremely pleasant and were quick with the service. When we left we were told &#34;have a nice night!&#34; five times (I counted). 

This sushi restaurant is so cool and interactive it is something that I would even recommend to people visiting around Chicago. Obviously Chicago is not known for their sushi, but this place is too affordable and different to pass up. You can also see the price of the sushi based on the color of the plate. For example, as the belt goes by and you grab a phoenix roll that is on a pink plate that will cost you a certain amount of money whereas grabbing a vegas roll on a blue plate will cost you something different, and so on. So like I said before this is a great way for people just trying sushi to start and sample some different things at a decent price and also be able to see what they are purchasing before they do. 

For the price of the sushi I believe the quality is pretty good. I have had some real expensive sushi in my life and this stuff tastes pretty much the same to me. If you think the food is not fresh that comes around the belt, they will make whatever you order as well! Sushi Station is a super cool place, it is relaxed, and it is an easy way to order sushi for those who are nervous or unsure.

If they put this little care into the dining side of the restaurant, how does it look in the kitchen?  The flooring is worn in multiple spots and falling apart by the bathrooms, the seats are worn and cracking, etc.

On the food side of things, the prices have stayed the same but the serving size has shrunk/slices of sushi have gotten thinner.  We used to go here frequently because it was a bit of a bargain, but now we need to get more plates to eat the same quantity of food, which negates any savings that might have been there before.

I loved conveyor sushi the couple of times I had it on the West coast, but only the only conveyor in Chicago are the two Sushi Station locations. I&#39;d been to the Rolling Meadows location and enjoyed it, but my girlfriend assured me the Elgin location was much better. So one Friday, rather than drive 40 minutes, we drove for an hour to get to Elgin.

Well, the location was certainly bigger. Almost three times bigger. That must be a good sign right?

Meeeehhhhhh. We got seated right away which was nice, with about 90 minutes left to go until close. Grab a couple plates off of the belt then...that was it. From our seat, we waited and waited, and for about 30 minutes at least all that went by was either dessert or nothing. What kind of experience is that?

I mean, sure, you can order off the menu, but I can do that anywhere. Desperate, I ordered some salmon nigiri. It came out practically frozen. Like, I could see ice crystals on it and it hurt to bite into. But, I was hungry, sucked it up, and finished it off.

I was disappointed. To the point where a couple weeks later I had a craving to go to the Rolling Meadows location just to make up for this visit.

It&#39;s a shame that there aren&#39;t more conveyor options in the Chicagoland area. After my visit here, my options are down to one.",04/08/14,152,2,1,1,-13,0.6599999999999998,1.742,1.85,17.408,No,1332

The nice thing about this place is that you need to wait. You can grab a table pretty quickly and well grab your meal. The prices here are very affordable even if you max out with 20 plates....I&#39;ve seen it done by one person...so yes it is posible! The sushi is pretty tasty with a lot of speciality rolls.

sushi-station-elgin,Jenna B.,QdXPEZD3czagWcFjJ27kqw,TvJ-7mANuPKinRtqBtvDeQ,"Over spring break I got to go back home to Streamwood, Illinois and go eat at one of my favorite sushi places. I had not eaten there in so long and I thought this would be a perfect place to review. Sushi Station is one of the best, fast and easy sushi places near my hometown and I would definitely recommend it. If you are a sushi snob I would not recommend this place to you, because it is not super fancy and does not have the most expensive menu items. If you just love sushi or have never really tried it before this is a great place to start.

I think the coolest thing about this place is the revolving belt that goes throughout the entire restaurant and shows off all of the daily specials and sushi selections. You can then open it up right in front of you and grab the sushi you want! I love being able to pick and choose my own food and get it on my own time. The service is still really good, even with the self-serve rotating belt. During my last visit it was far more crowded in there than I had ever seen, and the wait-staff was still extremely pleasant and were quick with the service. When we left we were told &#34;have a nice night!&#34; five times (I counted). 

This sushi restaurant is so cool and interactive it is something that I would even recommend to people visiting around Chicago. Obviously Chicago is not known for their sushi, but this place is too affordable and different to pass up. You can also see the price of the sushi based on the color of the plate. For example, as the belt goes by and you grab a phoenix roll that is on a pink plate that will cost you a certain amount of money whereas grabbing a vegas roll on a blue plate will cost you something different, and so on. So like I said before this is a great way for people just trying sushi to start and sample some different things at a decent price and also be able to see what they are purchasing before they do. 

For the price of the sushi I believe the quality is pretty good. I have had some real expensive sushi in my life and this stuff tastes pretty much the same to me. If you think the food is not fresh that comes around the belt, they will make whatever you order as well! Sushi Station is a super cool place, it is relaxed, and it is an easy way to order sushi for those who are nervous or unsure. They make you feel at is and you really cannot beat their prices!",23/03/15,252,4,2,5,20,8.2022,3.457,0.456,18.086999999999996,No,2372

Is this the best sushi in the area? No, but if you&#39;re looking for GOOD quality, creativity, and selection... and GREAT ambience, service, and value... you&#39;re at the right place. This is why you&#39;re reading mixed reviews.

I come here when I want sushi quick and easy, and I want to enjoy a social time with my friends and family.

If you&#39;re apprehensive about the conveyor style, don&#39;t be, because the tunnel is refrigerated! And if you&#39;re so inclined, you can request anything made to order.

I recommend this place for casual to new sushi fans who want to try a bunch of different rolls for a decent price. Great for kids and groups.

As far as stars, here&#39;s my reason for 4 :
Quality/Freshness : 4
Creativity : 4
Selection : 3
Ambience : 5 (super social, high energy)
Service : 5 (attentive and polite)
Value : 4 (you control the value!)

Is this the best sushi in the area? No, but if you&#39;re looking for GOOD quality, creativity, and selection... and GREAT ambience, service, and value... you&#39;re at the right place. This is why you&#39;re reading mixed reviews.

I come here when I want sushi quick and easy, and I want to enjoy a social time with my friends and family.

If you&#39;re apprehensive about the conveyor style, don&#39;t be, because the tunnel is refrigerated! And if you&#39;re so inclined, you can request anything made to order.

I recommend this place for casual to new sushi fans who want to try a bunch of different rolls for a decent price. Great for kids and groups.

As far as stars, here&#39;s my reason for 4 :
Quality/Freshness : 4
Creativity : 4
Selection : 3
Ambience : 5 (super social, high energy)
Service : 5 (attentive and polite)
Value : 4 (you control the value!)

As for the sushi, it&#39;s decent. They are definitely reducing the amount of crab/shrimp/etc in the sushi. When you have to search for the crab in a roll, that&#39;s unacceptable.

Ya know that saying, &#34;my eyes are bigger than my stomach?&#34; Well, be prepared. There&#39;s like an 85.4% chance that you&#39;ll be saying it when you visit Sushi Station. For me, totes mcgoats, 100%. haha.  But, I never waste sushi (and neither should you). So, here&#39;s my tip if you order or grab a few plates more than you should have:

1) Take a breather.
2) Watch the parade of sushi go around the conveyor belt a couple times and

Overall, Sushi Station has classic sushi options and some fun rolls thrown in on their mile long belt and it&#39;s menu. I think the price is fair and the quality of sushi is pretty good. I would have tried a dessert- lots of choices as well- but I got too full on sushi. :(",14/03/13,102,4,2,4,23,3.553200000000001,3.2299999999999995,1.0,9.77,No,781

It&#39;s average, at best, probably a little below average if we&#39;re being honest, but who doesn&#39;t love the conveyor belt of sushi plates that show up right in front of you while you eat? I&#39;m not one to be overly critical of sushi station--if I want high quality sushi, I&#39;ll go to a real sushi restaurant and pay double the price. Having said all of this, I have found that over the years, the quality has significantly decreased while the prices have gone up. There used to be a sea of &#34;pink&#34; plates gliding past you; now, you&#39;re lucky to see a single pink plate in a sitting (nearly everything is blue or green). Even with the increase prices, I&#39;ve still been willing to go back from time to time because I&#39;m a sucker for a gimmick, and while the west coast may have these types of restaurants all over the place, it&#39;s unique here in the Chicagoland suburbs. 

So why the two stars? Well, after going for lunch last week, I finally had it with this place. My husband and I got there over an hour before the end of the lunch hours. The place was still packed with people, but they weren&#39;t putting any new plates on the conveyor belt. It seemed like the kitchen was on a mission to force the reject plates on those of us patiently sitting there, waiting for a spicy tuna or shrimp tempura roll to pass, but instead seeing the same lousy egg nigiri and disgusting desserts (is anyone actually taking one of those coffee jelly&#39;s off the belt?). I sat and watched everyone sadly watch as the same plates circled around over and over again. For a split second, I thought about ordering a roll from my server, but then I was like...nahh, I don&#39;t want to give this place another cent. If this is how they want to run lunch, count me out.

First thing I liked was the employees greeting all the customers by saying &#34;welcome&#34; in Japanese. Next was the nice waiting staff. They helped us out fast. Since it was my first time there, I had to look at the menu carefully to know what was being served. My brother didn&#39;t miss a beat when he started telling me which rolls were the best. He proceeded by ordering a bunch of different rolls for me to try. Only thing I ordered on my own was a regular tuna roll. Each roll I tried were amazing. Never once did I think I could like sushi. The third thing I liked about the restaurant was the moving conveyor table, showing all different dishes as they pass by and that people can just open the the little doors and grab a plate or two. Plus, how each plate had different colors, meaning different prices. Before the night was over, my brother insisted that if try some wasabi. Big mistake, but worth trying.

I have always had good servers at this restaurant. There are no complaints about them at all. I do find it a little distasteful that the manager has to go behind the servers and count the plates. If you don&#39;t trust their math, don&#39;t hire them. That simple.

As for the sushi, it&#39;s decent. They are definitely reducing the amount of crab/shrimp/etc in the sushi. When you have to search for the crab in a roll, that&#39;s unacceptable.

sushi-station-elgin,Jessica D.,AS2eqL49wen1NEBLwpLVvg,dp3FEAQ5a8Xw5mDdSTw2Wg,"I used to order to-go fairly often from here but have been less and less lately due to poor customer service and frankly, just crappy sushi. 

They are definitely more on the affordable side so I by no means have expectations for some super high quality, fancy sushi, but I do expect it to taste fresh and not be warm like it has the last few times. 

I&#39;m also much more hesitant to order from Sushi Station because an experience I had a few months ago that left a bad taste in my mouth. I called at about 7 or 8pm on a week night and placed an order for pick up while I was on my way home from a friend&#39;s in Palatine. I live in Hampshire so Sushi Station is conveniently right on my way home. After I got off the phone I realized that I had left my debit card at home and didn&#39;t have another way to pay. As it was late and I was still pretty far from home, I wouldn&#39;t have enough time to get my card and pick up my order before they closed so I called back to cancel my order. I called literally within 5 minutes of placing my order and started off by saying how sorry I was and explained that why I had to cancel my order. The girl that I was speaking with became extremely rude asking me a bunch of questions after I had already explained why I needed to cancel my order. She then said in a very snotty matter that she would tell the chef and hung up on me. 

I understand that the situation is not good for them and they didn&#39;t want to waste food, which is why I apologized and made sure to call WITHIN 5 MINUTES. I did not appreciate the tone that was used or being hung up on. In the service industry it is important to be kind to customers regardless of the situation. 

Sushi Station used to have my business at least 3 times a month. Now due to a VERY poor customer service experience and the quality of their food declining I&#39;m not sure if I will be back.",28/07/14,183,1,1,-1,-9,-1.8536000000000001,0.8,1.545,12.654,No,1889

I&#39;d heard it was bigger. It is. The building is absolutely gorgeous. I was really excited when I first walked in, because it seemed like there was a lot more breathing room in this location than in the Rolling Meadows one.

There aren&#39;t a lot of options for kaitenzushi (pay-by-the-plate sushi, on conveyor belts) around, so Sushi Station stands apart in that regard. And it&#39;s a lot of fun -- especially if you take someone who has never experienced it before.

But the food? The food at Elgin isn&#39;t as good. At least, not as good as I remember. I haven&#39;t been to the one in Rolling Meadows in probably 6 months, at least -- so maybe it&#39;s gone downhill, as well. 

The food looks nice (although again -- presentation was better at Rolling Meadows) -- but it seemed kind of warm (definitely not good for sushi, and there WAS quick turnover because we went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was hopping), and it seems like the prices have gone up. More stuff is on the pricier plates now than before. I used to be able to eat about $10-$12 worth of sushi at Sushi Station and be perfectly happy. 

Between two of us, we spent almost $60 for a meh meal that made our stomachs feel unpleasantly gurgly a short time later.

Sushi Station has a strict no outside food policy, while they admit to letting the occasional baby food or toddler cereal in, they may not, and in my opinion that is not worth the hassle of unbuckling and dragging your baby/toddler into the restaurant.

We learned the hard way.  This used to be one of our favorite places which we frequented at least twice a month.  One cold evening we came in to relax after a long week and were harassed at the door by the hostess who wouldn&#39;t let us pass with my not yet two year old son&#39;s lunch cooler bag.  She demanded to inspect the contents like we were going through airport security and we had to wait for her to get management approval for us to be seated.  My son has multiple severe food allergies which include all grains (rice, oats, wheat, etc), egg, corn, soy, and potato.  The cooler had his &#34;safe food&#34; from home.

The wait staff was super friendly and happy.  The atmosphere is modern and cool.  The way the wood comes around is a trip.  And over all the sushi was fresh and tasted really good.

I will say, I over spent and over ate for sure.  I usually never get that full on maki rolls but I left there stuffed.  The good deserts didn&#39;t help any I&#39;m sure!

Like many of the other Yelps said, Sushi Station is a great place for novice sushi eaters. Each plate comes with four pieces of sushi, so it&#39;s not a huge commitment. You can also order hot appetizers from the menu, as well as rolls that you don&#39;t see on the conveyor belt. 

For appetizers, I love their seaweed salad, miso soup, dumplings and fried shumai. The tempura and shrimp crispers are also really tasty. As far as rolls go, I love the Philly rolls. The rock &#39;n roll and spider roll are also good.

Time of my visit: Lunch

It has been awhile, since I&#39;ve to an Indian joint.  I  have decided, I would like to do a lunch buffet.

Let&#39;s start with the price.  It was $9.99 per person, which I think, was a bit much...  Even for that area.

The buffet was an L-shape in a corner of the restaurant.  They had a nice salad, which had iceberg letters, cucumbers and tomatoes, which is a lot more than you&#39;d normally get somewhere else.  I have also tried rice, curry chicken, noodles chicken (I am so sorry, I know I am butchering it) chicken in tomato soup.  It was all decent.

The best part was the chicken the waitress brought out from the kitchen.  I always enjoyed watching and hearing it sizzle!  That chicken was delicious!  And pitas that came with it was good too.

There were two main concerns that I had, one the poor waitress was overwhelmed!  There was a big lunch rush and she was the only one there.  She hustled well!  Another issue was an &#34;inspector&#34; came in to the facility.  I am gonna go ahead and assume it was a health department inspector or a city inspector, which immediately put me at a bit tense state.

I would say about B-.  Wouldn&#39;t mind coming back and maybe ordering something off the menu.",22/08/16,156,4,2,3,22,2.3452,2.478,0.40499999999999997,16.117,No,1275

I&#39;ve been to this location when it was originally Himalaya, and I can say that Taj Mahal is probably one of my favorite Indian buffets. 

Service was fast, but not extremely attentive. Personally, I come for the food, not the service (if that bothers you, sorry, but most Asian restaurants aren&#39;t the best when it comes to service). Food was still hot and a generous batch of Naan freshly made was also served. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember a lot of the dishes, but some that stuck out was a goat curry, chicken 95, and some paneer dish. I found the dishes to be spicier and also a tad sweeter than other places I&#39;ve tried (both good things in my opinion). Their gulab jamun is the perfect amount of sweetness, and their mango ice cream was a delight. 

Overall, I found this restaurant to be a gem in the plethora of Indian buffets prominent in the Chicagoland suburbs. Definitely recommend it.",19/06/16,112,5,2,3,49,2.1416000000000004,1.8559999999999999,0.398,7.746,No,996

Few general things that I don&#39;t really like which are reasons for the 3 star rating:
- private event area is open so the rest of the restaurant is really loud when they are hosting an event
- I think some of the food they serve is just reheated leftovers from their lunch buffet (specifically the biryani)
- I prefer when leftover food is packed in front of me instead of in the kitchen
- Took our water glasses before we finished paying (felt like they were trying to rush us out)
- Took a really long time to process my payment. They said the credit card machine so I gave cash and then they said their register drawer wasn&#39;t opening

The service was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too slow :( We were a group of two pregnant women with toddlers and hubbies and they stuck us in a tiny cramped table in the corner. They basically ignored us and we had to ask for they waiter to come take our order twice before someone finally came. The food was okay, so I will cut them some slack and go back for a second round one day. Love Indian food so I&#39;m hoping for a better experience next time around.

***** update*****
Just had dinner here tonight and enjoyed the dining experience I was originally hoping for from this place! I enjoyed the chicken biryani, butter chicken, and raita with a pakora entree. Delicious! Mango shake to wash it down and help numb the spice. The service was on key. Waitress checked on us multiple times, and water was refilled consistently. They actually had a straw cup with lid for kids this time. (They didn&#39;t have it last time) they did forget the talhi dish at first but our waitress realized it before we had to mention anything.

taj-mahal-restaurant-bloomingdale-2,Napoleon U.,dhbP-qjwuCm13UIvpOOJkA,xmzKDulX7XBmSxwYFuoanQ,"Very good lunch buffet for $9.50. You&#39;ll be seated to white butcher paper covered tables and water poured to your glass. While selecting food at the buffet, the tandoori chicken and naan bread is brought to your table.

Lunch buffet is a great deal if you are unfamiliar and want to sample different dishes because they give you so many to choose from. I managed to try only about 80% of what they offered in the menu as listed below...

chicken tandoori
naan bread
veggie spring roll
veggie hakka noodles
paneer makhani
saag corn
chilli chicken
tawa vegetables
goat meat
chicken makhani
chana masala
dal makhani
veggie samosa
mango ice cream

Notables: the tandoori chicken came out sizzling hot, naan was fresh and warm, the tawa vegetables was bland and did not look appetizing sitting on a flat tray, the hakka noodles tasted good, but noodles were overcooked, and the samosa was very spicy (not meant in a bad way). My favorite dish was the goat meat. The sauce was very savory and flavorful. In summary, the food was pretty good. Spice level was set low to medium so it should be comfortable to most people.

Service was attentive. They took away any empty dishes and will ask for any refills as they pass by. Tables were bused and kept cleaned. The buffet was in the corner as if it was part of the kitchen and was not furnished. I think the ambience and decor of the dining area needs to be extended here. It just seemed odd.

I have been here before when it was a Chinese restaurant. And then again as the Himalayan restaurant. The casual atmosphere and basic layout hasn&#39;t changed. There&#39;s a semi-private area for parties and the bar is near the front, though I wondered why there were no seats there. There was a couple monitors. The one facing the bar had sports while the other had an Indian news channel. Most of the patrons seemed of South Asian descent and spoke their native language. I would say it adds legitimacy as an authentic Indian restaurant.

I ordered the paneer makhani. The menu says &#34;Ala Carte is served with naan&#34; and I ordered one additional naan so I expected the curry and 2 naan but what I received was the paneer makhani, rice, and one naan. They asked how spicy I wanted it and I told them very spicy - they delivered on the spiciness but there is some sacrifice on flavor when they make it that hot. Additionally, I detected a slight burnt flavor and the curry appeared burnt as well - not enough to become inedible - but it could have been better.

All in all, not that bad. I think the Glendale Heights/Bloomingdale area is lacking a really stellar Indian place (surprising given the demographic around here) if Taj Mahal works on a few things they might be able to step up and fill that void.",30/11/15,104,4,1,1,-2,0.8399,0.6839999999999999,0.286,7.029999999999999,No,975

At least now I know what to put on and what to leave off my plate. 

I experienced an equal mix of good and bad. The vegetable pakora were decent enough but the vegetable spring rolls had no flavor and were so under-fried that they flashed a ghostly white. I really enjoyed the aloo gobhi (cauliflower and potatoes) but was so disappointed in the bland, watery chana masala. Redemption showed promise in the form of tender, juicy, tasty chicken tikka masala, but then the tandoori chicken, which was served at the table on its own little sizzling platter, fell flat, suffering from inexplicably dry thigh meat. I finished the entire basket of hot, crispy-fluffy naan, but then my initial excitement at the sight of dal-stuffed dosa with sambar deflated once I took a bite of the rubbery crpe dipped into an insipid soup. 

Dinner takeout another night further let me down - yellow dal completely lacked flavor and the &#34;seasonal&#34; fish curry clearly used frozen fish (no real surprise in the suburbs, I suppose), even though I did like the tomatoey gravy with bits of coconut. 

Indian food should be perfumed with spice and envelop your palate with an array of exotic, complex flavors, and Taj Mahal failed to deliver.

In fact, this time there were some new faces as well.  Overall, the service was way better and on the spot.  The food was delicious.
We got medium spiciness and it was medium. Sometimes medium is like super hot. 
Lamb pasanda is a dish I&#39;d recommend.

At 8:41pm we get a phone call from Grub Hub that they wanted to make sure that Taj Mahal contacted us about cancelling our order (they didn&#39;t).

They were nice enough to let us choose a seat since we had a stroller. Unfortunately the service was terrible. We were there for 10 minutes before anyone came to us. And there were a lot of empty tables so it wasn&#39;t due to it being crowded. Finally the waitress comes to us and we ask her for water. Nobody even gave us water when we sat down. Then we asked her how many samosas come in the appetizer. She didn&#39;t know and has to leave and ask someone else. We ordered our food and appetizer and noticed everyone had papad at their tables except for us. After awhile we finally flagged someone down and asked for it. They apologized and gave us our papad. The service was extremely slow. The servers were very apologetic so at least they had that. At the end of the day we were there for 2.5 hours which is way too much especially with an infant that started getting fussy around the two hour mark.  The food was actually very good taste wise. And we were given a discount for the long wait. Unfortunately we were not able to enjoy the food the way we wanted because the baby was fussing. And frankly.....We were irritated too.  As Indian Americans we thought that the service was a poor representation of who we are. I don&#39;t blame the servers who were all very nice.

After a super quick trip to Ikea today, I was starving. I had BBQ on my mind and didn&#39;t want to eat anywhere pricey or a place where I had to tip. It was suggested that I give Hickory Roasters a try. And, it was the best and most perfect recommendation ever! My hubby doesn&#39;t eat beef, and here he had all the chicken options possible. BBQ or grilled, they roast it right on site in their big giant oven. 

I opted for a pulled pork sandwich with cheese on it. It was exactly what I wanted at the time, and my side of potato salad was hearty and beyond delicious. My pork sandwich was good, and my hubby&#39;s lemon pepper chicken on a pita was juicy and spicy amazing.

The decor isn&#39;t much, but it&#39;s clean and the owners seem like family. The pricing is extremely reasonable, and they have a variety of hot and cold sides to accompany your sandwich.

hickory-roasters-rolling-meadows,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,PAI_H1GpfaiRHBfKpFCvJw,"Good sides and barbecue for a hole-in-the-wall place in Rolling Meadows.

I was looking for something different for lunch near Schaumburg and decided to give this a try with the wife and kids. It takes a while to parse out your options, but in the end I went with a roasted 1/4 chicken (for some reason, dark meat only) with apple crisp and papas al diablo.

I&#39;m a big fan of the chicken, which, being dark meat, was very moist and tender. The skin had nice crackly bits of hickory-flavored char. Otherwise the rest of the chicken tasted lightly smoked.

The sides, thus far, are a big plus here. The potatoes were a little bit spicy and spiked with vinegar, making for a tender, flavorful side. And the apple crisp had the right blend of crispy crumbles atop sliced warm apples. For the more adventurous, go for the $5.95 Four Sides Special.

The barbecue cheddar sandwich was less successful, largely because about a third of it was pretty dry and the barbecue sauce was oddly sweet, which wasn&#39;t something I was expecting from a place that hickory smokes their chicken.

I&#39;m not sure if the kids meal chicken tenders are breaded in-house, but they were pounded flat, moist, juicy, and blazing hot. So those were a success overall.

To be honest, if they pitched the barbecue sauce that was on the sandwich in exchange for the stuff that was in the cup, I think these guys would be doing the sandwich very well. Overall, worth a visit!",03/07/16,173,4,1,5,-12,4.4767,2.6,0.065,12.335,No,1449

There&#39;s a daily special for every day of the week. Sunday is $11.99 for a full rack of ribs and two sides- two normal people can eat this. Perhaps add one side BUT there is plenty of meat.

Restaurant is ran by a husband and wife that make all of the food from scratch every day. They are very nice people and give great recommendations when ordering off of the menu.

Great place to pick up food, stop by after shopping at Woodfield  Mall, or just eat here because you love BBQ and all your comfort-food sides at your fingertips.",28/07/12,73,5,1,2,-12,1.9999,0.835,0.06,7.104,No,620

First off, the chicken is really tasty! Nice and juicy and falls right off the bone. I love their tomato and cucumber salad, delicious! One of the best things is you can get a meal with a basic protein and then 2 sides of your choice, customizing it to be as healthy or un-healthy as you like!

I was hoping Hickory Roasters would deliver like the broasted chicken at Boston Blackies. Alas, no.

It&#39;s a humble joint. Reminds me of a cafeteria where you peruse the menu really quickly, place your order with the nice staff behind the counter, pay at counter and find a seat.

The customers are mostly working-class folks intermingled with a few  quasi white-collar office workers like us.

We order the famous, &#34;back by popular demand&#34; pot roast for about $7. And  of course the roasted chicken, which was spinning in the spit (and yes, we spied hickory wood near it). They come with choice of 2 sides, which include the staple assortments of mac and cheese -- a runny concoction looks like it came out of a wholesale tub -- mashed potatoes (flavorless and goopy wet), garlic potatoes (overly salted), Italian green beans, corn (both waterlogged) etc

We were highly disappointed in it and we had hoped so hard for a good joint. The pot roast came out of a small container kept in an oven and it was dry and salty. And no gravy could salvage it. And the chicken was dry and heavily seasoned, as well.

We usually give places second chances, but this visit was so dismal that we would never know if today was just a bad day for them and we are not returning.",19/05/08,170,1,2,2,25,1.0697999999999999,1.226,1.8260000000000003,9.949,No,1344

When that profound sense of displacement hits, it&#39;s natural to look for something familiar: La Michoacana everywhere are run by the wonderful folks from the Mexican state of Michoacn, home to many traditional Mexican recipes (thanks for letting me know, Sofia) and I am a huge fan for their paletas (ice pops)--just what a muggy afternoon called for. 

Guided by Yelp and GPS, I drove to one of the nearest La Michoacanas--the sole one-star review didn&#39;t deter me--only to find a dental office at the address. Somebody had a wicked sense of humor I guess, as La Michoacana is known for its decadent frozen treats. But seeing that the area is dotted with Hispanic businesses, I pressed on, and found it two lots over (Yelp originally listed the street number as 2071 not 2103). 

I went inside and was greeted by the familiar sight of a variety of paletas as well as ice cream in open chest freezers. A lady came to help me but I soon realized the language barrier was bigger than what I experienced before. I looked up and decided to rely on the list of flavors (in both English and Spanish) though it didn&#39;t seem complete. With my funny pronunciation (hey, I can barely speak English, let alone Spanish), I was able to ask for a few flavors (some new and some familiar), and got a horchata, which, as a yelp friend put it, you should always be drinking, to go. She was very kind to show me the coffee and the tamarind side by side so I could tell the color difference. There appeared to be two different prices for the paletas, depending on whether it&#39;s cream based or water based, but the price difference is negligible(a dime a piece I think?). 

I finished those paletas in the next few days. Strawberry and cream was fabulous; coffee was good. These are basically ice cream on a stick (a big stick I may add). 

I love pineapple but won&#39;t get the pineapple flavor again, because it&#39;s just frozen pineapple pieces and the pineapple was not fully ripened so it was just bland; the tamarind flavor was way too tart for me. 

It pains me to give a La Michoacana less than four stars as I am a fan but the flavors of water-based paletas were quite underwhelming, plus I didn&#39;t see my favorite prune flavor...",04/08/13,274,3,2,4,20,3.2697,1.6469999999999998,0.501,13.850999999999999,No,2338

The fries are fresh cut and fried on the dark side-- and one serving is absolutely huge!  

They have topped fries that look very good-- in fact, everything looks good.

I especially want to try some of their different toppings for the fries as they have several tempting options.  The &#34;personal&#34; pizza was perfect for 2 of us to share as they load on the toppings and cheese (4 square slices in the personal size).  The veggie toppings on the one we had were quite fresh &amp; plentiful in addition to the sausage &amp; pepperoni...and the ooey gooey cheese!  I like how the cheese is all the way up to the edges of the pizza and forms a nice crisp cheese crust along the edges.

Having recently moved to Elgin from downtown Chicago, I was a little skeptical about finding a decent pizza place to order from.  But, I&#39;ve ordered from Geno&#39;s about 4-5 times now and it&#39;s always been solid.  The delivery people have always been prompt and friendly too.

I&#39;ve only ordered thin crust pizzas, but I think I&#39;ve ordered most of what they have to offer in that department, and I&#39;ve never been let down.  After reading other reviews, I think I need to get a sandwich next time though.

I found myself going to Elgin the other day, and since Geno Nottolini&#39;s had a good yelp review I thought I&#39;d try it out.

If this is the best pizza Elgin can serve up, frankly, it&#39;s time to move!

It&#39;s not that the pizza is *bad*.  It isn&#39;t *bad*, it&#39;s jut not all that *good*, either.  We ordered a...  a meat something-or-other bomb.  Basically, throw ham, canadian bacon, pepperoni, and sausage on a pizza.  As a bonus, they have coupons so that when you order an XL anything, you get a small cheese.

Welllllll...  as I was saying, the pizza isn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s absolutely nothing to write home about.  Both the meat bomb and the small cheese had enough oil on them to make Saudi Arabia look over their shoulder.  The thick crust was decent, and though others didn&#39;t particularly care for it I kind of dug their &#34;hey, there&#39;s a breadstick around the edge&#34; approach.  The sauce was only so-so, which is where I believe GN&#39;s pizza really falls down; it&#39;s slightly sweet but doesn&#39;t have much seasoning beyond that.  It&#39;s main contribution to the pizza is really its red coloring rather than flavor.  Toppings were pretty good; sausage was actual sausage rather than reconstituted dog food that most places have.  Pepperoni was fair but not stellar, and everything else kind of blended together.

The atmosphere, well, it&#39;s a pizza place tucked into a strip mall.  Can&#39;t expect a lot there.  Six tables out front where you can sit and eat, but they&#39;re pretty tight.  Really this place is intended as a pickup/delivery operation and that&#39;s about it.

In short, if I was at someone&#39;s place and they ordered pizza from here, I&#39;d eat it.  But if they gave me a choice, I&#39;d probably explore around to see if there are better options.  Edible, but not stellar.

I got steak tacos with lettuce, tomato and cheese. It came with beans and rice. They gave me a green and a red salsa (he even warned me the red one was kind of spicy). The tacos were awesome. The steak was really tender/flavorful and everything was just really fresh and delicious. The salsas were awesome.

Time of my visit: Lunch hours

This was my first visit here.  I decided to try it based on all the marvelous Yelp! reviews.

It is kind of tucked away off of Lake street, the street you suppose to turn on does not have a light.

It was smaller than I anticipated, three tables, counter and a cash register with nice blackboard type menus hanging on the wall.  Had a bit of a euro feel to it.

A nice lady came out and greeted me and asked me what I wanted.  I asked for a recommendation and she suggested I get Italian Sub.  My only concern was it had spicy capicollo, due to my ignorance I did not know if it was more of flavorful or hot, turned out to be flavorful.  I took a 10&#34; sub and placed my self at the table.

It did not take long for it to come out.  I was impressed by how quickly they made my sandwich.  It looked really thick!  They did not skim on the meat!  Plus - number one!  I took a first bit and was mesmerized by the bread, it was soft, but firm enough where it was not falling apart, plus - number two.  The meats and cheeses tasted fresh, juicy and high quality!

I legit drove passed this place three times and turned into two parking lots before I pulled into the right one. Whoops!! Anyhoo, we came here all the way from Elgin to grab some lunchy poo and although pasta and more pasta sounded like my kinda lunch I played it safe with a turkey sandwich and my friend tried their Italian beef because some other yelpers claimed it was better than Johnnie&#39;s Beef. 

When I say &#34;played it safe&#34; I really did not expect this glorious sandwich placed in front of me. It was huge and came on this great foccacia bread with olive oil, GOOD balsamic vinegar and a little mayo with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and turkey. All the ingredients in between are important but let me tell you my fellow yelpers the foccacia bread they served this sandwich on is THE TRUTH. My friend said their beef was next level but he liked mine way better, which I agreed because previously stated that sandwich is THE TRUTH. I mean this sandwich was so good we drove an hour and thirty minutes the next day from the city to come back to roselle to get this unforgettable sandwich.

On our trip back we spoke to a gentleman who happened to be Mario (yes, the sandwich is named after him ) he told us they go to three different farmers markets every week to get fresh food. He took the time to make small talk and you know what I appreciate that. I enjoyed talking with him and of course I had to give him feedback on how awesome that sandwich is and how we drove back all that way for this sandwich. We ordered their pasta salad, pepperoni pizza, vegetable pizza, and lemon cookies and they were all phenomenal. Before we left, Mario threw in some free peanut butter brownies which probably went straight to the butt but hey real men should like that anyways right !? ;) 

Elena&#39;s is a hidden gem but I don&#39;t want it to be hidden. I want their business to do well, which telling by their postcards on their wall they looking like they are doing just fine.

Elena&#39;s is a family operation and they have fun with it  No one is in a hurry here...so be patient and follow my lead.

My advise to you, whatever you order, get the biggest portion possible. I order for carryout only because seating is limited, but I&#39;m sure your sandwich will taste just as good standing up as opposed to sitting down.

It&#39;s almost a unfair to review Elena&#39;s Deli as a lunch spot when 1.) it&#39;s clearly focused on being good at the catering side of the business, which means what you&#39;re served tends to come out of what they&#39;ve made to cater, and 2.) if you do stop by for lunch, you&#39;re probably going to have to take it up.

But we had a place to sit. And the food was awesome.

My wife had a prosciutto and bocconcini sandwich, which is topped with balsamic vinegar, some parmesan and fresh tomatoes. Bocconcini, it turns out, is not broccolini: it&#39;s actually a very soft, moist, tangy mozzarella cheese. On top of perfectly cured, savory prosciutto. With a deep, richly flavored balsamic permeating the sandwich bread. I liked this sandwich better, and it wasn&#39;t even my sandwich--which is a rare feat.

Not to say my meatball sub wasn&#39;t good. On the contrary; it&#39;s the best meatball sub I&#39;ve ever had. The meatballs were perfectly made; tender, with clearly identifiable parmesan notes. The tomato sauce was chunky, fresh and excellent, and there was a layer of parmesan underneath.

Both sandwiches were served with a bag of Jay&#39;s chips, which I appreciated.

These sandwiches can last two meals and the ingredients are top notch. And they&#39;re only around 7 dollars with a bag of lays chips. More than anything anyone can ask for. So, I called in to place an order for take out and I recommend doing that since it takes them around 15-20 minutes to make sandwiches. Parking is a bit tricky, you need to turn in on the side street and go in to the parking lot but maneuver around the mall. However, well worth the sacrifices.

I ordered a large eggplant Parmesan sandwich and a large Mario sandwich and both were phenomenal. I had half of each and my taste buds are well treated. The various meats in the Mario sandwich were high quality and thinly sliced. There were some onions, tomato, and I really like the sauce they used although I can&#39;t tell what it is. The eggplant is perfectly cooked, silky and smooth, and it&#39;s paired with the best crust, sauce, and cheese. The bread they use is to die for. It&#39;s chewy and a bit tougher but all to the perfect amounts.

It is in sort of a strange complex that you have to drive around the back of it to get to it.
 Small place inside. I was the only one there at the time. I ordered an Italian Sub sandwich to go. Waited just a few minutes before it was ready.
Now this review is for the sandwich only, I did not try anything else. The sandwich did come on some excellent crusty bread. I really like excellent crusty bread so that is a plus. It had all of the standard Italian meats along with a bit of shredded lettuce and dressing. No tomato. I like tomatoes on my sub so thar was a little disappointing. Not sure if it was omitted or if that is the way they serve them. I thought the sub was pretty good. Was it the best I&#39;ve ever had? Nope, but it was a solid version that I would order again.
  I will return to try other items like the Italian Beef.

elenas-cucina-roselle-2,Nicole W.,qlC607Cyp0Mj91vDFvkp3Q,vFUJ7FyzEgbM6lXBxXbEig,"Elena&#39;s cranks out the lemon cookies to end all lemon cookies. I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t like lemon or have an aversion to citrus - her lemon cookies are beyond. Beyond delicious. Fragrant. Perfectly dressed with just the right amount of sweet frosted topping. Soft in the middle, but substantial elsewhere. If I haven&#39;t convinced you to score a lemon cookie, I might as well retired my Macbook right now. Get yourself a lemon cookie.

And yes, Elena&#39;s has all sorts of tasty morsels beyond the aforementioned glorious lemon cookies. She has foccacia, soups, salads, fried zucchini, stuffed peppers, soups, and plenty more. My fam and I stopped in to this teeny Italian deli to grab a few pre-made items for an easy Sunday dinner and here&#39;s how it went down...

Foccacia: 5/5: Flavorful hunk of delicious bread roasted and toasted with delightful toppings like hunks of cheese, roasted tomato, basil and more. 

Pasta fagioli: 4/5: A classic Italian soup made with tons of starch (lots of noodles, beans, bits of ham). Elena&#39;s is good but a little too starchy for me - we had to thin it out quite a bit and add plenty of red pepper to liven it up. 

Stuffed peppers: 4.5/5: Nicely put together and a bit spicy! 

Spaghetti squash: 5/5: These squash bakes were a huge hit with me and my 2 year old. Tons of flavor and the right amount of crisp! 

Cannolis: 4.5/5: Even at the end of the day you can still get a delicious cannoli, albeit frozen. Cannolis should be either freshly piped or frozen to ensure a fresh experience! No one wants a sad, soggy cannoli shell. And they&#39;re bookended with pistachios. The. Way. It. Should. Be.

Fresh bread, large meatballs, amazing red sauce, perfectly done eggplant... It comes with a bag of chips. I didn&#39;t stop there.

But in the back is where the magic happens.  Fresh baked made in-house bread.  Balsamic vinegar on sandwiches to add more flavor.  Pesto to elevate the caprese sandwich.  I am not a vegetarian but decided to run through the gauntlet of sandwiches and tried the eggplant parmesan.  Their son Mario mentioned their top 3 selling sandwiches being the Mario&#39;s Italian, Salvatore&#39;s prosciutto and bocconcini, and Elena&#39;s caprese, but the eggplant parm is one very underrated star on their menu.  Thinly sliced and lightly breaded but full of flavor.  We also took home some arancini which are smaller than others so you get more crunch for the bite.

That&#39;s the kind of relationship I&#39;m in. He&#39;s the Felix Unger and I&#39;m Oscar Madison all the way. 

He&#39;s neat, orderly, disciplined, reasonable, practical, genius-level smarts and for the most part, incredibly kind (though he doesn&#39;t seem to fancy cats much).

I&#39;m a mess. I leave crap everywhere. I rarely clean up after myself. I&#39;m terrible with money, even worse with math, and there&#39;s actually been times (multiple) where I&#39;ve been so lazy that I&#39;ve actually lied about brushing my teeth. I know, I know. But at least I admit it. Sure, I should probably be more ashamed and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some deeper psychological stuff there, but for now we&#39;ll all just have to settle for my own admission of these facts and I&#39;ll just go on pretending that my level of sloppy is still cute and okay. 

How does this this bit of information take me to Elena&#39;s Cucina? Well, I&#39;ll tell you... just like I always do, whether you want to hear it or not.

People are always telling me how lucky I am to have my SO. No one EVER says the reverse to him. And I know they&#39;re right and that I should be thanking my lucky stars day in and day out, but sometimes... sometimes I think, &#39;This is it. This is the day I throw him from a moving vehicle if he doesn&#39;t pull that stick out of his ass right-quick.&#39;

Luckily, it only took one life-changing visit to a little storefront in a business park off Lake Street to find the perfect way to curb his (and my impending) crankiness: Order anything from Elena&#39;s Magical Cucina.

Priced for even a pauper like myself, you can get a heaping sandwich on fresh, homemade bread with the highest quality artisan ingredients. Fresh made pizza with homemade dough, fresh homemade focaccia bread, fresh and homemade pasta and more -- all fresh and all homemade right there on the spot! 

The shop is almost completely hidden from street view and while there are two tiny two-seater tables inside, it&#39;s main hub of business seems to be from catering/carry-out orders. It&#39;s counter service or call ahead, and while normally I&#39;m monstrously impatient and hate waiting, I actually had a really fun time just sitting and listening to my SO tell the play-by-play of our sandwiches being made in the back kitchen. 

Everything from pulling the fresh bread loaves, to slicing cheese straight from the block. This is as from-scratch as it gets, folks. You should expect your order, no matter if it&#39;s a salad or sandwich or pizza to take around 15-20 minutes, because like I said - EVERYTHING is done from scratch. They don&#39;t pre-make, slice, set anything so your food is fondled by as few people as possible before it hits your lips. 

On our virgin visit, Mario was manning the counter and put together both our veggie pesto sandwich and our Caprese sandwich. Mario, that dude... I owe my life as a free man to him for saving my boo and I from what could have been a very disastrous (possibly murderous) day of exploring the suburbs on an empty stomach together. 

Mario made us up these heaping sandwiches, though only 6-inches each according to the menu, we eye-balled them at closer to 7&#34; and spent the first minute and half of the sandwiches being placed in front of us in awe of how absolutely picturesque and perfect they were. Loaded with more-than-generous ingredient portions, this is the kind of food that&#39;ll make your Italian Nonna rethink her decades-old family recipes. 

Elena&#39;s... they do Italian deli right and unlike any other. I&#39;ve honestly never had anything quite like it and I&#39;ve never seen my SO&#39;s empty stomach+crabby patty mood dissipate so quickly. It was like we transitioned out of being The Odd Couple and moved into a more Darrin &amp; Samantha of Bewitched-type scenario where I just wiggled my nose (or in this case, ordered a sandwich) and all of a sudden Darrin&#39;s sourpuss turns to sparkles and smiles and we all have a happy ending.  

We ended up shaking Mario&#39;s hand before we left because we were so thankful to him for what he&#39;d done for us... made us the best damn sandwiches we&#39;ve ever had, and for $10 total for the both of us, no less. 

I know where I&#39;ll be getting all future parties catered from and I know where I&#39;ll be headed the next time I have a hankering for the best Italian sandwich on the planet... which as it turns out, is fairly often.",09/07/13,477,5,2,5,12,5.5516000000000005,3.6080000000000005,3.921,27.471,No,4470

My zucchini parm was on point.  Bread wasn&#39;t mushy, still warm a half hour later.  My mouth is watering and I just ate the thing.

Crusty bread, excellent meat-to-bread ratio, and a full-size w/a bag of chips is only $7, tax included!!!!! I&#39;m very picky with bread, especially if I&#39;m to indulge in white bread, and I love Elena&#39;s.

I&#39;ve also tried the eggplant parm sub and lemon cookies. The sub was molto buono, but the lemon cookies.. heaven save me, those were sinfully, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Tart lemon glaze that didn&#39;t taste artificial either.

This place is f-ing awesome. Elena smiles like an angel, and her food is foodporn at its best. Combine the two and you have a 5 star establishment, huzzah!",16/11/13,90,5,2,4,34,3.7786999999999997,1.9609999999999999,0.0,7.039,No,642

I always knew they had a place but never made it out there as I was satisfied with my weekly fix from the market.  One day I had the brilliant idea to take the boyfriend and the teenager there for lunch...holy hell what was i missing????  He had the Italien sammich, I had the meatball sammich and the veggie teenager had the cesear salad.  All were phenominal.  We capped it off with the lemon cookies.   I think i just about died with happiness.  

Upon deciding on who would cater my daughters graduation, we pondered and then decided that Elenas should do the job.  Of course, we made this decision right about lunch time on a saturday...so off we went for lunch.  He got the italien again and I had one with prosciutto and burrata.  Im pretty sure I started crying at the table it was so good.  After inhaling lunch, we decided the catering and ordered 3 cheese lasagna, sausage and peppers, vesuvio potatoes and chicken tenders.  Everything was so good.  People are still talking about how good it was 2 days later.  I love this place.

This is a gem.  I will for sure be back for more food and im trying to think of another reason to cater another party.  Sammich, chicken tenders, sausage, potatoes, lemon cookies.  UGH! Now im hungry.  I love you Elena...like a fat kid loves cake.  Thank you!",15/06/15,167,5,2,5,37,4.2428,4.385000000000001,1.6760000000000002,16.937,No,1409

Went in not knowing what to expect because it&#39;s kind of tucked away in a little strip mall off Lake St and there is a pretty big hill in front of the building so it&#39;s hard to see.  I would say I have easily driven past this place hundreds of times and always wondered what it was.  Boy was I glad my husband asked me to go here!  First of all the gentleman behind the counter, Mario, was super friendly and professional from the minute I walked in the door.  There weren&#39;t any other customers there at the time I walked in and he greeted me within seconds.  I told him I had never been there before so I wasn&#39;t sure what to order.  He said they have daily specials and explained each one to me for that day.  I order what my husband wanted which was so fresh and honestly the best Italian sub I have ever tasted!  Crunchy bread, fresh lunch meat, tomato, lettuce, spices, and the dressing on the sandwich was so good.  I didn&#39;t taste the antipasto salad but it looked amazing.  I order eggplant parmesan with some meatballs and sauce.  Again, was very pleasantly surprised by the nice egg coating on the eggplant and the meatballs were soft and the sauce tasted homemade.  I also took a trip to their dessert case which had the best Italian lemon cookies I&#39;ve ever had!!!  So soft and moist with that delicious lemon glaze.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them again, a perfect cookie to have with your coffee.

It is not the easiest place to access (or see) from lake street. But sometimes the best things are hidden. 

Also, if you are in a hurry, don&#39;t be! It&#39;s gonna take a few minutes to make your sandwich. Because they don&#39;t have a bunch of pre-sliced meats and cheeses laying around. They take the time to hand slice them up.

I have been dreaming about Elena&#39;s sandwiches for weeks now, I just cant get them out of my head.  After just one bit I knew I was in for a wonderful experience and it just got better as the meal went on.  We split a veggie pesto sub and the Caprese sandwich, though I ended up eating more then my fair share since they were both so wonderful.  I just kept going back and forth each time forgetting how wonderful the other sub was until I took another bit.  All I remember saying is &#34;So good!  So good!  It is just so good!&#34;  So let me break it down.

Elena&#39;s subs are on fresh baked bread - this is good, chewy, Italian bread that makes you savor your sandwich.  The subs are packed full of goodness with extra thick cuts of cheese, I am talking 1/2 inch or better cuts of cheese.  That alone won me over but it gets better.  These sandwiches are made fresh with incredible detail and mindfulness that what comes out of the kitchen is a work of art.  O yeah, and the sandwiches were absolutely amazing, packed with so much flavor that I can say with out a doubt they are the best I have ever had.  All that for wonderfulness for Subway prices so it is definitely the best for the cost - no contest.  The bar and this cucina is set super high that I dont know if anyone else can compete, all future sandwiches I eat will have to compare to Elena&#39;s.  

Well anyway - the storefront itself is a nice, small, deli that feels a little bit like home.  There are a couple display cases of treats, some drinks in a cooler, two tables, a huge kitchen, and tons of photos and clippings on the walls.  It seemed like most of their business is catering or carryout but I enjoy dinning in, so we did and it ended up being a great choice.  It just feels like home and we were treated like family, making it a wonderful experience.  The only issue is that it is rather hard to find for first timers and for some reason GMaps could not get us there.  Lucky we found our way but if you are lost their website has a map of where they are located.  Overall I could not be more pleased with Elena&#39;s and I am just itching at the chance to come back!

elenas-cucina-roselle-2,Janni V.,GKZw9pVMesGBRfCR7Q_bgw,uvV4cExjqKPFtgXcuPfJ1Q,"Man, Elena&#39;s is so awesome at what they do, it makes me want to go back and revise a few things down a star in comparison. 

I&#39;d been here once a long time ago, but for some reason kept forgetting about it, even though it&#39;s super nearby. That&#39;s mostly because its hours just don&#39;t jibe with when I&#39;m usually thinking about needing some delicious Italian deli sandwiches, salads, and home cooking. 

Luckily, I stopped by for a sandwich and a salad the other day, since my SO had a day off and it seemed like a nice thing to share. 

When you go into Elena&#39;s, there&#39;s a nice little display case with some Italian cookies and freshly made food sitting in it. There are also a couple of little tables, and some cute homey decorations that make you instantly feel like this is a place that cares about what they do. Elena&#39;s does a lot of catering business, but they also have a little menu on a chalkboard behind the display cases. If you have trouble reading it, they also have paper menus available over by the register. 

They offer several sub, panini, and salad options -- and if you want to change what&#39;s on the menu? They&#39;re happy to accommodate you. At first, this might be a little intimidating. If you know what you want, however, you&#39;ll be fine.

For example, my SO really wanted a roast beef sandwich. He also loves grilled and roasted veggies (minus onion) and pesto. I saw the cold grilled veggie sandwich with pesto on the menu, and asked if they could add roast beef. 

The woman (Elena? Not sure. I should have asked -- she was so sweet!) smiled and said, &#34;Of course!&#34; 

Not only did she add roast beef -- she sliced it fresh right then and there. RIGHT THEN AND THERE, PEOPLE. She also let me add grilled eggplant to the sandwich. I ordered a large sub (subs come in 6&#34; or 10&#34; sizes) , which automatically comes with a bag of chips. My SO was so happy with his sandwich, he ate it very slowly -- something he never does. He also asked why we&#39;d never had Elena&#39;s food before. Another first: he couldn&#39;t finish the sandwich in one sitting. He ate it for lunch AND dinner. 

As for me, I ordered an antipasto salad for myself. I, too, didn&#39;t have room for dinner. That was a DELIGHTFUL salad. Homemade balsamic vinaigrette was perfect. Quality of the cured Italian meats in the sandwich couldn&#39;t be nicer -- and mmm, beautiful kalamata olives with perfect brininess! 

Of special note: in both the salad and the sandwich, the tomatoes were bursting with ripeness -- something which alone can win my heart over. I even said to the woman preparing my food, &#34;Thank you for using ripe tomatoes!&#34; She responded, &#34;I only like them when they&#39;re ripe, too.&#34; That? That&#39;s someone who cares. That&#39;s who you want preparing your food. 

The bottom line? Even something as seemingly simple as salads and sandwiches is greatly affected by the quality of the ingredients used. Elena&#39;s takes such pride in what they&#39;re doing that you can&#39;t ask for better. This will become a go-to place for us, I&#39;m sure. So they&#39;re not open for dinner? We&#39;ll just have to plan better so we can enjoy their deliciousness more often. :9",29/05/13,364,5,3,5,67,11.0913,6.684999999999999,1.567,36.74799999999999,No,3249

I don&#39;t normally like lemon-flavored desserts, but both the flavor and texture of her cookies were outstanding. They&#39;re almost not really cookies--more like a mix between a scone and a cake, but shaped like a cookie, topped with ultra lemony icing. Box of 4 for $5. So worth it.

The focaccia, with an incredibly garlicky crust, was great. We weren&#39;t as much a fan of the zucchini parmesan. Both were on the salty side, but the spaghetti I cooked at home helped to tone it down.

Was looking for some lunch today and decided to search yelp for lunch near my house.    Came across Elena&#39;s and couldn&#39;t tell off hand if it was a deli or just catering or both.   Gave them a quick call where Salvatore answered and said yes, they did serve lunch.   Dropped off my son at preschool and away we went.   

Walked into a small unassuming storefront and saw a nice glass case filled with lemon cookies and other pastries on one side and premade dishes on the other.   Decided on a few things for lunch including a meatball sandwich, proscuitto/fresh mozzarella sub, pasta salad and lemon cookies.   The owners were very nice, smiling and talking about their grand-daughter and giving suggestions.   Placed our order and waited.   

Prices were fine - about 20 bucks for all that food which was within reason.   

Got the food home and tore in.  Meatballs were excellent.   Not too dense, not too loose.  Sauce was good with them and the sandwich was stuffed.   Proscuitto/fresh mozzarella could have used a touch more meat, but they used an excellent balsamic vinegar on both sides of the sandwich that soaked into the bread and gave a great flavor.  The pasta salad was very good BUT the lemon cookies were to die for.   I&#39;m going back for more.  Seriously, like after I finish this review, I need more.

You can find their products at farmer&#39;s markets including Daley Plaza so if you see them, get them.  Will go back for the pizza and foccaccia.",19/05/11,167,5,1,4,0,3.194699999999999,2.6430000000000002,0.5830000000000001,16.774,No,1516

As soon as I walked in I immediately felt welcome, they explained the menu and their case of freshly made pastas and meatballs. I ordered a 6 inch sub and a little bit of homemade pasta. I watched them make my sub and all the meet was freshly sliced. While I waited the owner brought out some baked eggplant on a plate for me to try.

It has been a frustrating experience living in the suburbs and not having a place to grab a decent sandwich other than Smitty&#39;s on the Corner which sucks because they are closed on Sundays. I know they are located in a downtown area where most businesses are closed, but I wonder if they realize or care about how much money they are missing out on? At any rate, Deane&#39;s is thankfully open 7 days a week and I will happily continue to patronize them.
Besides being a deli, they also carry specialty items to include a great selection of artisan mustards, chips, house made herb butters, chicken pot pies, black bean patties, and quinoa granola just to name a few. Another thing that is awesome about this deli is that they offer a generous amount of samples of their food. Today they had samples of their fresh baked scones, chocolate chip cookies, the above mentioned herb butter with slices of french bread and their caprese bread. They were all delicious and provided you with a taste of the quality of food that is offered at Deane&#39;s. For lunch, we had the smoky chicken salad sandwich and the turkey sandwich.

The key to success will be high quality food that&#39;s fresh and tasty.  I know your new but differentiating yourself from other places is key and off the shelf bread won&#39;t cut it.  Which leads me to the meats.  Turkey seemed fresh roasted but there was more dark meat than white with some grizzle.  Very odd.  Is it processed or freshly roasted?  If the former, not good, if the latter then buy better turkey breasts cause white meat is king.  Nice ambience, great location.  Nice owners too.

We tried 3 different tacos (beef, pork, and the mushroom - which was a special of the day) and all were really good.  They are small tacos you can buy individually so it&#39;s nice to try a variety and also to accommodate both small &amp; large appetites. Their salsas were darn good, too. Oh, and the cucumber margarita was soooooo delicous!

The only down side was the tortilla chips must have been sitting out in the basket to put on the table a bit too long as they weren&#39;t quite as crispy as they should have been.  There was no offer to refill the basket once we emptied it, either (it wasn&#39;t a huge basket of chips like you get at some places so we finished it off easily).  If it hadn&#39;t been for the chips and if it wasn&#39;t just our first time there I was tempted to give them 5 stars.

taqueria-el-sazon-batavia,Sabrina C.,#NAME?,t7qLiv41xAcvRHo2yS1dJA,"I may have eaten here four times in the past 10 days. It is just so. damn. good. 

First: The margaritas. They didn&#39;t have frozen or blended (normally I&#39;m a rocks girl, but I was feeling blended on my first visit) so I ended up with a peach margarita. Actually... I had two peach margs. And part of a lime marg. And they were FANTASTIC. Child had her first horchata ever here, and she loved it. I was impressed. She thought it tasted like a &#34;liquid churro&#34; and that pretty much nails it. 

Housemade chips and salsa are solid, as is the guac. Queso fundido was excellent, as were the pork tacos and cheese enchiladas. (No, not all mine. But I&#39;m a taster.) But what keeps me coming back is the Bistec ala Mexicana. I can&#39;t stop. I&#39;m becoming a tad bit obsessed in that I want this for dinner every single night. 

Agree with other reviewers that you&#39;re not coming for the ambiance, but actually, sitting outside and people watching is quite nice. They do have some outdoor seating. And everyone here is really friendly. It&#39;s in a busy shopping center next to Batavia Creamery, and there always seem to be people coming and going. 

Takeout business seems to be fairly robust. Portions are smaller than what you get during dine-in, but still satisfying.

The Steak Tacos can be very good or very dry with the texture of ball bearings. The meat crumbles as it falls from the shell and rolls around on the table at will.

The Taco Dorados can be the best around as long as the cook removes them from the deep fryer before they transform into &#34;Hot Pockets&#34;. The accompanying warm salsa is delicious and can be a substitute for a cup of soup. An occasional slurp is not out of the question.

The margaritas are highly recommended. They actually make an effort with the homemade formulation. Smart move on their part!

 The ambiance is limited and bordering &#34;drab&#34; however the service makes up for it. The ladies actually crack a smile or two!

Here are my complaints:  first and foremost, the food just doesn&#39;t taste that good- I&#39;d say mediocre at best.  In addition, they have tried to up-sell us almost every time we&#39;ve been in there, which I find insulting and uncomfortable.  If they are experiencing financial trouble, maybe they should try improving their food before putting pressure on people to buy more.  When I order their taco combo, the portion of beans and rice was comically small- don&#39;t they realize that they&#39;d be better off serving ample portions of cheap things like B&amp;R? ( Here is a tip:  order three single tacos and a side of beans &amp; rice and you&#39;ll get more food.  But then they will badger you to get the combo....)  It was like a table spoon of each.....Which in light of my next complaint, I should be grateful for:  I then got an awful stomach ache.  Not sure how clean that place is....

I&#39;m kind of hoping it will stay an undiscovered gem for just a little longer. Their food deserves to be known. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and all natural wood. It&#39;s a very classic log cabin atmosphere. It&#39;s classy yet casual.

With each meal, you receive unlimited soup refills and crusty bread with szmalec, a rendered pork fat spread with bacon or similar flavoring inside. It&#39;s heavy but a welcome change from the usual butter and very tasty. I tried a vegetable soup as well as mushroom soup. They kindly allowed me to switch varieties between my servings of unlimited soup. The service is friendly and fast! On game days the place is lively and filled with cheering fans.

I ordered chicken with roasted potatoes and beef stroganoff, which isn&#39;t like the Northern European version but more like a Hungarian goulash. Chicken was delicious and crispy skinned but perfect texture inside. The beef was delicious, cut into bite sized pieces, and tender. Plenty of food to take home to re-enjoy later. The goulash was served in a cute little suspended steel cauldron. That was a fun touch.

This restaurant deserves a lot more exposure than it currently has. It&#39;s also next to Helen&#39;s Polish deli, so you can pick up some kabanosy (dry sausages) or kielbasa for grilling later.",20/09/16,162,5,3,5,54,6.0765,4.436,0.5349999999999999,15.028000000000002,No,1415

Really interesting looking log cabin on Irving Park Rd. about 5 miles from O&#39;Hare. You&#39;ll realize how close you really are to O&#39;Hare if you ever try and sit outside on a nice day. Don&#39;t do that. 

1/2 order of steak tartare is plenty for 2-4 people and a great appetizer. Some of the best tripe soup I&#39;ve ever had. Light grainy bread is homemade fresh and warm, and the lard vs butter option should be tried at least once.

Love the Schnitzel with 3 salads, big leftovers. Side polish salad just the way its supposed to be with a sour cream dressing, fresh and sour. All fried food should have an egg on top of it. Portions are large.

Bottomless Ice Tea in the cutest Polish log cabin in Chicagoland (most real Polish Peoples and children are drinking beer), wood on the walls, everywhere.

Our last fantastic waitress Justina was wonderfully patient at deciphering our sad English. We have been working our way through their menu and love it and U Gazdy.

Very friendly and laid back, friendly boisterous is probably the right word for not quiet, a German rathskeller feel.  Nice easy wood bar seating and some high and low tables.

Is it like German food?  Russian?  Ukrainian?  Can I pronounce anything on the menu?  Will I be the only person in there who doesn&#39;t speak Polish?  OMG THE STRESS.  

Now that I live super close to U Gazdy though, I HAD to finally check it out.  I mean, it COULD be our new favorite restaurant close to home, right? 

Seriously, this place is FREAKING DELICIOUS.  I&#39;ve never had Polish food before and this is some serious, stick-to-your-ribs, delectable food.  It was similar to the German specialties I have had before but with A LOT more flavor.  It&#39;s like they took German food and made it better.  And added more fat and butter.  Yum.  

They serve you bread and rendered pork fat (?) &#34;butter&#34; when you sit down right away.  That was awesome both in flavor and in keeping the baby occupied while we tried to figure out what to order.  Speaking of being nice to my baby (who was being a complete jerkstore by the way) the waitresses were all so sweet to her which is always appreciated.  The waitresses were actually all really good and helped each other out (with an additional food runner too) so everything was quick and service was really good.  But I digress...let&#39;s get back to the food.  We got the pierogis (1/2 meat and 1/2 potato and cheese), potato pancakes, the breaded veal (sorry, I am too lazy to see how to spell it in Polish), and the blood sausage (see aforementioned laziness with the proper name) and it was all AWESOME.  My partner thought the veal could&#39;ve been more tender (or something...I couldn&#39;t really hear him over my chewing and raving about the food...oh, and the jerkstore baby)  but everything else was SO GOOD.  And all the portions were so huge we actually had two meals...one dinner and one lunch the next day.  I&#39;m not going to go into too much detail because I feel like everything I ordered has been raved about in other reviews but suffice it to say if you don&#39;t eat this blood sausage dish before you die, you will regret it for all of eternity.  

I will be back, U Gazdy.  I love you and your Polish food.  The beer I will have to get used to, but the food?  TRUE LOVE.",21/06/16,267,5,3,5,87,6.3085,4.31,1.375,23.314,No,2310
u-gazdy-wood-dale,Nancy L.,yzWz3gHekKx_SLcrvR_VfA,F53GugfMG8rX1g_P5nEO4w,"U Gazdy has been on my list ever since it came highly recommended in a great review by Ron S. Being that its practically next door to me, how did I miss this place?

Well, for one - I don&#39;t eat Polish food often, more like once in a blue moon.  Yes, I&#39;ve had the more common Pierogis, and stuffed cabbage, but that&#39;s the extent of my Polish adventures.

And two -  This restaurant is &#39;blink your eye&#39; and you&#39;ll miss it. I&#39;ve drove past it a hundred times and never knew it existed.  Your dead giveaway will be Helena&#39;s Polish Deli (large signage) right next door in front of a tiny parking lot..

The exterior &amp; interior is very cabin-esque throughout. Tables, chairs, walls..think Woody Woodpecker. Decent bar area with good amount of seating.  Warm, cozy and casual Euro feel.  Plenty of Polish diners when we arrived (always a good sign).  We were greeted instantly and service was spot on.  Menu items explained.  A hearty, meaty and starchy selection of traditional home style Polish fare.  

Complimentary grain bread with lard spread arrived first.  Lard was a first for me. No, I don&#39;t make a habit out of eating lard, but I was excited to taste it.  Mixed with bacon pieces and I&#39;m not sure what else.  Our waitress described it but I couldn&#39;t quite make out what she said due to her Polish accent, so I just nodded and smiled.  I can only describe it as unique and yes, lardy...its definitely worth a taste and not off-putting at all.  Just take another Lipitor if your watching your cholesterol.  I wouldn&#39;t go &#34;hog-wild&#34; on it...

We wanted to taste a variety of appetizers &amp; two entrees...so our group of three shared:

-Pierogis appetizer - serving of 10.  You can mix 1/2 &amp; 1/2 but I asked if we could try 3 varieties instead of 2.  Our server was reluctant at first but since the kitchen wasn&#39;t busy, she happily obliged.  Excellent.  Potato, Beef and Sauerkraut w/mushroom all topped with crispy bacon and served with sour cream.  Delicious.  Dough was not thick, tough or a starch bomb. Really tender. Great fillings on all but our fave was Sauerkraut Mushroom by far. This was nothing like your frozen variety - definite homemade taste..

-Potato pancakes.  Side of two.  Thin and crispy.  Flavorful.

-Beef Stroganoff &amp; Veal Sznycel entrees.  Includes your choice of Mushroom or Chicken Noodle soup.  Mushroom soup was light and satisfying.  Full of tender mushrooms in a light cream broth.  More soupy than creamy.  Delightful.

Stroganoff is presented in a tripod kettle and includes your choice of hoof shaped dumplings, potato pancakes or pureed potatoes. We all decided on dumplings and were happy we did.
EXCELLENT.  So light &amp; tender.  Homemade perfection and a great accompaniment to the copious amounts of fork tender beef contained in a meaty flavorful sauce combined with mushrooms...Take your ladle and pour a nice helping over your dumplings and you&#39;ll be one happy eater..

I will admit, this was different from the Stroganoff&#39;s I&#39;ve had in the past and described as a beef goulash. Since I&#39;ve never had goulash and can&#39;t compare, this reminded me of a beef stew in terms of flavors and consistency - but SO tasty and well executed.  Huge serving...  

-Veal Sznycel plate was (again) enormous.  Two hefty veal portions breaded &amp; fried sitting on sauted mushrooms topped with two sunny side up fried eggs.  Includes pureed potatoes or dumplings only. Pureed potato was simple and went nicely with this heavier dish. Veal wasn&#39;t as thin or as tender as we would&#39;ve liked and lacked seasoning. Perhaps sauce would&#39;ve added more flavor to this dish.  Although it wasn&#39;t our favorite, it wasn&#39;t bad at all.  Plate also comes with 3 Polish side salads of pickled veggies.  Talk about a ton of food for one dish!  Polish peeps know how to bring it on!

Excellent selection of Polish brews..some wines and cocktails too.  Our group felt very welcomed here. Some patrons were seated at the bar when we walked in.  Clearly Gazdy&#39;s is a go-to or favorite spot for locals, non locals and Polish alike.  Huge plus on outdoor seating as well.  Everything tastes home made and nothing lacked flavor, with the exception of veal. My only complaint would be that app&#39;s and entrees were not spaced out, but came quickly after another.  

Gazdy&#39;s serves up lumberjack size portions quite authentically -  I promise, you will not leave hungry. A family of 5 could easily feast on what we ordered and leave satisfied for only $54.
Yes, $54....that&#39;s what I call a great deal, and you can&#39;t beat the quality..

Highly recommend this Wood Dale diamond in the rough when you want authentic Polish at a tremendous value..4 types of Borsch.  Duck, rabbit, goulash, pork shank, some seafood...and more.

Their dishes are even better than most places I dined at in Poland! I especially love their soups, the Highlander Pancake and their complimentary bread served with lard.

I am a first generation Polish American with both of my parents immigrating from the mother land. I grew up with Polish food and you will not be disappointed.

1. This place is a highlander restaurant. Highlanders are considered like what rural country woods people are considered here in America. So they are the outdoorsy kind of people in Poland. So this is not the type of Polish city people kind of place. A little different tradition and culture. 
2. With that being said, the food reflects that. The food is amazing.
3. I do think the food is a little bit expensive, but for what you get its worth it. 

I do think this is one of the best Polish restaurants around. Give it a shot!

u-gazdy-wood-dale,John B.,nSpSbvHMc4Xo5Uph2HhI7A,gbeMbugvVWZlP6vPD0RN9A,"Amazingly tasty Polish food, but make sure you have time to spare. Another hour lunch, another time I was late back from lunch. Don&#39;t let that discourage you, though! The food here is incredible. I ordered a Polish standard in my family, kiszka, and I was very pleased with the flavor, texture, and moisture (those of you who have had dry kiszka know exactly what I&#39;m talking about). It came with tasty potato dumplings and sauerkraut as well. The bread they serve with an entree comes with some kind of rendered fat which is probably horrifyingly bad for you, but it is also definitely worth trying.

The setting is rustic wood like you might find in a cabin. The tables are natural wood with all the imperfections, and each table has chairs on one side and a bench on the other. It worked out great for my party of two. I really liked the look of the inside of the restaurant. It&#39;s cozy and there are only about a dozen tables, so it could fill up fast in there. There were only two tables of people when we visited just after noon. 

I docked one star for timeliness as it seemed to take quite a while to get our food ordered (I&#39;d say at least 10 minutes), and also for the check. There was only one server on, but there was an older gentleman sitting behind the counter who did zero things while we were there, just sat there letting the poor server take the brunt of the lunch crowd. The entree I ordered came with a soup--but apparently not borscht (red beet soup), which I had asked for, so I was charged an extra $3.50 for a coffee cup of borscht--not a good value--and I felt rather cheated that she didn&#39;t mention the extra cost and just upcharged me. It&#39;s not like I ordered a typically expensive item expecting it to be free. It&#39;s basically beet broth (yes, beet, not beef). Even so, I would certainly return again. 

If you are Polish and miss your family&#39;s cooking, or if you aren&#39;t Polish and want to try some great Polish food, U Gazdy is definitely the place to go.",13/10/16,230,4,1,5,0,4.177700000000001,2.879,0.6859999999999999,16.436000000000003,No,2018

After 10 min of explaining and even showing them my online order from my phone, I was put on the phone with what I believe to be is their owner. 

For some reason, there was an issue with them not being able to take grubhub orders and I was not the first to have tried ordering from them. Not sure why they did not settle this issue with grubhub after the first instance but even more baffling is that noone at the restaurant acknowledged it might be their system and instead insisted I was at the wrong place/did not know what I was talking about.

I don&#39;t mean chains or your everyday American food places either! My parents were visiting this weekend and with St. Patrick&#39;s Day on the horizon mom strangely blurts out, &#34;why don&#39;t we find some Polish food?&#34; Um... Sure! We moved recently and I wasn&#39;t even sure where to begin! As long as I&#39;ve been with the boy (and he&#39;s the Polish in our relationship!) he hasn&#39;t taken me to a real Polish restaurant! I don&#39;t think he knew of any... Until now...

We started with the Pierogis. We have 5 each of the meat/pork  and potato/cheese. Both were fantastic! The meat pierogis had a bit of sauerkraut in the mix which gave the flavor a nice kick. The potato pierogies weren&#39;t quite as flavorful, but they had their own merit for being handmade. 

We ordered 3 meals for the 4 of us, so we got 2 Chicken Noodle Soups and a Vegetable Soup. The chicken was a bit lackluster. There wasn&#39;t much for flavor and it was quite bland. The veggie on the other hand was outstanding! Now, there is one vegetarian dish on the menu and it&#39;s not the soup lol! It&#39;s made with a chicken base, so it&#39;s a little salty. Between the base and the broccoli it was almost creamy. We&#39;ll have to go on another day next time so we can try another kind since I&#39;ve seen some good reviews of the soups.

The first dish that we all shared was the Pork Tenderloin Escallops. The pork was perfectly seared and covered in cheese that was bubbly and melty and topped with mushroom gravy! Who doesn&#39;t love seared pork covered in cheese and gravy?! They served it with potato dumplings that were handmade. I could have eaten a truckload of these dumplings with the gravy! NO JOKE! (we were married in a semi Polish ran banquet hall, and these dumplings were by far way better!)

The second dish we shared was the Polish Style Duck with Roasted Apples &amp; Raspberry Sauce and fries. The duck was good for the most part; however, it lost a lot of it&#39;s moisture. The apples and sauce helped. The boy is a duck fanatic and he loved it. I can&#39;t tell him he&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s just my opinion vs. his. Skip the fries if you order this. They&#39;re just steak fries. Get the potato dumplings if you can!!

The third dish we all shared was the Highlander Style Potato Pancake with Pork Goulash. I died happy eating this! I can say that I love potato pancakes from every country that has made them for me (except a few random breakfast places)! The pairing of this pancake and the pork goulash was a fantastic idea! The crispy edges of cake with all the gravy of the goulash were made to go together! I was the one that finished what was left on this plate!

This place has a great rustic, homey, almost log cabin feel to it. We had a couple different people visit our table to make sure we were doing alright. We were upset that we ate too much to attempt to have dessert! But we were glad we had some leftovers to take home! The dining area began to fill up as we were eating. We got there early, so we didn&#39;t necessarily need to have a reservation. If you plan on having a later meal though, you probably should plan ahead!",15/03/16,351,4,2,5,50,6.501499999999999,6.055,2.87,39.07300000000001,No,3228

It was one of the best soups I have had. The bread was also awesome and the peirogis were excellent as well. I had the roast duck for an entree and it was ok- not great.

We shared a &#34;half&#34; order of steak tartar ($8.50) which is plenty for two people to split as an appetizer.  I ordered Beef Stroganoff which come with your choice of soups as a starter.  This time of year you will often find goulash soup as one of the choices.  Oh man is it good!  It is nice and spicy and will definitely warm you up.

You can order the Beef Stroganoff with noodles, dumplings or potato pancakes.  I chose the dumplings which were a delectable treat.  The Beef Stroganoff comes in a stainless steel tureen that hangs over a lit flame.  Not only was the beef and gravy cooked to perfection, there was plenty left over for a meal the next day.

U Gazdy offers Zywiec, Carlsberg and Wehenstephaner Weis beers on tap.  A 20 or 22 oz glass is just $5 and a great value.

If you come here you&#39;re definitely not leaving hungry as the portions are huge and the meal comes with a generous amount of side dishes. Everything here is prepared with great textures and is seasoned well. Here are my thoughts on some items:

Bread: Nice texture with a savory side of something that seems like lard and pork bits.

Soups: Chicken noodle was alright but the cream of mushroom had a nice full flavor to it with fresh mushrooms. Very enjoyable and great with the bread.

Highlander Style Pork Shanks: Pork shank was prepared well, not too salty and tender.

Rumsztyk Steak: Tenderized with a nice flavor like a tenderloin. 

Giewont Cutlet: Breading was nice with a tender cutlet inside. The ham and cheese filling was very good.

Traditional Polish Style Duck: Could be a little more flavorful but was tender and prepared well.

Hoofshaped dumplings: Light flavored and chewy, went great with entrees.

Pureed potatoes: Not very flavorful but matched quite well with the horseradish sauce.

Three polish salads: Very refreshing and fresh.

We took our Polish grandmother here as a surprise and she really enjoyed speaking Polish with our server, who was so very kind I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember his name.

Either at a good Irish pub, or here, at O Gazdy!  The warmth of the decor, food and staff here was almost overwhelming...I think I fell in love with all three!

The outside of this place is, well, strange and out of place looking. Something out of a brier rabbit cartoon mixed with Yosemite Sam. Wooden logged with heavy door in front and a small parking area wedged into an area where strip malls and auto stores are prevalent. After visiting though, it makes sense. The inside is clean, and abundantly wood, again. High glossed tables with benches on one side and chairs on the other. A small bar to one side that looked inviting. Seemed like all the other customers were polish...and that&#39;s a good sign. 

Our waitress was soooo cute.  First, she brought us the menus and then asked if we had been here before. After saying no as a group, she scooped them up and returned in a blink with the &#39;English&#39; versions apologizing that she&#39;d brought the wrong ones. Maybe we all looked polish, uh, maybe not!  Brought us plenty of bread through the meal and was very helpful to us while ordering. Towards the end of our visit I&#39;d basically licked my plate clean and she stopped at the table and asked, &#39;Are you done with your meal?&#39;  It was such an honest and well meaning question, but unless I intended to eat the silver then I was obviously done. It was a great example of how polite she was. 

So, onto the food. This place is a comfort food factory. Hot plates stacked with carbs and meat with no worries about eating too much or not healthy. When you are served lard with your bread you just don&#39;t think about it and dig in. Slather it on thick because it is not as strong as you think. I had the meatballs and potatoes plate.  The balls were meaty.  Like, really meaty. I don&#39;t think there was any filler in there because they were heavy. But oh so good!  Other dishes in our group were well liked, but no one got the pierogies. :(  I sopped up the remaining gravy with some of the hard bread and was ready for an afternoon nap.

We walked in to the highlands of Poland. At least that&#39;s what they want you to feel like. I&#39;ve never been, so I&#39;ll just agree and enjoy the feel. 

And clean! It&#39;s a must.

Our waitress was great. Very attentive and sweet. Loved her accent. Even our eating neighbors were great! 

We ordered the purified, cheese and potato appetizer. Wow. 10, so many for just the two of us. Delicious.

For our entrees we had the captains cutlet which is a breaded pork loin stuffed with cheese alongside dumplings and a polish side trio salad. And the pork tenderloin scallops which is drenched is a gravy sitting on a bed of vegetables served alongside dumplings. Both delicious. Both huge. Both had leftovers that came home with us.

We ate and finished by 7pm on Friday. Just as we were leaving it became busier.

Last night, I took a small party to U Gazdy, some of whom were fans of Polish food and others probably a bit more reluctant. 

I ordered the roast duck. It came with cabbage soup, some potato wedges and some chopped salads, one of which was beets. I eat most anything, but beets are my all-time least favorite food. The very attentive waiter brought out the cabbage soup and it was delicious. Then came the chopped salads, and I loved them too, even the beet salad. Finally, I dug into the roast duck -- and it was PHENOMENAL. It was crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside, with just the right amount of spices and a little apple stuffing and orange or raspberry sauce. It was not the least bit dry or greasy, two usual risks of duck. I have eaten in more than 450 restaurants in the Chicago area, and this was one of the best meals I have ever had. 

Others in the group who also had duck loved it as well. Good reports were also given on the roast trout and the goulash, along with a variety of appetizers.

The price for this meal was under $20, quite reasonable.  

The ambiance of U Gazdy is unusual, reminiscent of a rustic mountain hunting lodge. I give this restaurant my highest recommendation. It is a bit off the beaten path, and a little hard to see from the road, but it is well worth seeking out.",08/03/15,172,5,2,4,18,3.3676,1.772,0.593,15.637,No,1445

The food here was quite tasty, including the bread and smaltz.. Another unique taste experience!!!

We had six diners and each of us ordered something different. We tried two different types of pierogi (cheese and meat) along with herring in sour cream for starters. All were great. We tried a couple different soups, both the captain &#39;s and viewing pork cutlets, duck with raspberry sauce, real man&#39;s meatballs, and rabbit. All were amazing. The cocktails were well-made and we finished off the night with cherry cordials. 

The service team were helpful and friendly from the moment we walked in the door. Our server, Milan, was especially attentive and made the night very enjoyable.

u-gazdy-wood-dale,Sarah T.,NqS05orB1_x056QRJJgbjA,wt7jUS_A3GFReUVDhVMlIQ,"I know nothing of Polish cuisine. I chose dinner here on account of these rave reviews. My initial thought that this place is built sturdy, like cottage on a cold hillside. The inside decor was similar. Classy, wooden furniture. I felt like Snow White stepping into someone&#39;s home. Everyone spoke another language, both patrons and staff. (And everyone was Polish but me until my friend arrived.)

The general appetizer is wheat bread with... herb lard. Smalec, apparently. Here&#39;s how the internets describes it: &#34;You take bacon and dice it up then heat it until melted. Pour it in a container and let it cool. the more fat the bacon has, the better the smalec.&#34; Mhm. Interesting.

I tried chicken noodle soup and yellow pea soup. I am fairly certain both from a box. In fact, I think I have this Lipton noodle at home. 

The actual cooking itself is high quality. I like the think they choose lesser cuts of meat to keep in tradition with Polish cuisine. I tried a rainbow trout stuffed with almonds, herbs and garlic butter and Rumsztyk Steak, which is apparently round steak pounded out and served with grilled onions on top.

Everyone loved the food, including the German and Italian diners in our party.  4 people had the Highlander potato pancake and loved it; only 1 person (a guy, I might add) could finish it.  One person had the stuffed cabbages in mushroom sauce, another had the pork tenderloin escallops and I had the Ziewont (or Giewont) cutlet.  The escallops were as might be expected - smallish slices of pork tenderloin on top of the dumpings (potatoes are an option).  The Ziewont cutlet was a softball-sized round breaded pork tenderloin inside of which was ham and melted cheese, which oozed out when you cut into the tenderloin.  Choice of potatoes or horsehoof dumplings - I had the latter. The 7th person in our party wasn&#39;t really hungry, so she had a bowl of the chicken soup and said it was good.  Everyone else started with the pickle soup, which came with dinner.  

The non-Polish people in our party loved the food just as much as the Polish people did.  Everyone left satisfied, most of us with leftovers.  I&#39;ve mentioned the pokey service before; it was a little better today.  Maybe it was because we had 6 pm reservations, and U Gazdy closed at 8?

I usually park in front, but parked in the back this time and saw the outdoor seating - picnic tables with umbrellas.  If it wasn&#39;t raining the day we were there, I would have suggested sitting there.

The only inconvenience (a minor one) was that they would only split the check in 2 - we had 7 people and wanted 5 separate checks - so everyone just paid in cash.  I thought this might be helpful to know, so you can bring cash if everyone is used to paying by credit or debit card.",30/05/15,210,5,1,3,-1,2.9789999999999996,1.8630000000000002,0.705,16.432000000000002,No,1841

There are so many great things on the menu I&#39;d like to try but on my first visit my friends and I agreed to do the Highlander Dinner for four which is $69. Pork sirloin escallops baked in smoked cheese cover with a mushroom sauce, lamb served with hunter&#39;s sauce, stuffed cabbage in a mushroom sauce, potato pancakes, gypsy style fries and grilled vegetable - we figured we&#39;d get a good try of many items but I think none of us ended up ordering what we wanted most of all! My personal favorites from this large assortment was the pork sirloin. I must admit though, when they brought out the large tray of food we all OOoooo-ed and AAaaah-ed!

This seemed like a massive amount but my friends who had been here before so the portions are bigger when ordering a single dish. Everything was good but I didn&#39;t find anything particularly amazing. We also had meat pierogis which were tasty but I really wanted to try the cheese or potato cheese pierogis as well! Our meal came with a choice of soup and we all ordered Chicken Noodle which was okay but nothing too special.

It was a cold and rainy night, 10 degress colder than it was just days before.  I absolutely needed something substantial in the comfort food vein.  Lucky for me, I deced to try U Gazdy out.  

Much of the meal here is pretty much the antithesis of &#39;healthy&#39;, but it was oh so tasty.  We were seated right away, got the house tap beer (not even attempting to spell it here)and took a couple of minutes to browse the bilingual (polish/english) menu.  One note: pay attention when everyone mentions the length of service- they do not move quickly here.  Dinner was a very leisurely engagement.  

As you&#39;ll see people mention, they serve a wonderful fresh bread here...that comes with a side of divine bacon/lard/herb spread.  Keep this in mind.  It gives you idea of what to expect.  We tried the peirogi (and they let you split an order into half meat, half potato) and they were great.  Already at this point, we had both decided we could probably subsist on a dinner of the peirogi and bread with bacon lard spread.  But we ordered entrees anyway, because why not overdo it?

I had the mushroom soup (earthy and wonderful) and Highland Shepherds special (picture: meat, wrapped in meat, wrapped in more meat (no, not kidding here)).  My sibling had the monster-sized Highlander pancake, smothered in some of the best goulash you wil ever taste with the sald trio as a side, and the chicken soup as the starter).  The chicken soup was the one average item - everything else was transcendant.

I had the pork shank and it was wonderful, wife had a pork chop stuffed with cheese then breaded. It looked good and she wouldn&#39;t share it with me. There goes her box of candy for St. Valentine&#39;s day!

Our waitress was really pretty and so sweet. Even though there was a bit of a language barrier and she was a vegetarian talking to a meat lover (me), she was still able to make recommendations for me.

My friend and I started with the pierogi: we chose meat and either the cheese or the potato-cheese, I can&#39;t remember. But either way, they were delicious. But the plate is huge, so I would recommend just eating a few and packing the rest of them to go so you can enjoy an entree. 

For my main dish, I got the duck, which was huge. I like that I got a big portion because it felt like it was worth the cost, but the duck was just okay. I wasn&#39;t a fan of it being bone-in because it was hard to get to the meat, but I did like that it came with apples and raspberry sauce though, so it was kind of a cool twist.

U Gazdy&#39;s decor is slightly ambivalent and so unexpected because the restaurant is essentially a dark log cabin from the exterior. However, the interior emits rays of bright light during the day reflected from beautifully intricate wood work (looks like birch wood). The bar area is completely adorned in this wood which gives it a Polish Trader Vics vibe. 

The fact that this place was absolutely packed with Eastern Europeans at 3pm on a random Saturday made my first encounter all the more surreal.

The food here is really really good. It is Polish comfort food that tastes fresh and authentic.

The pierogi were soft and pillow-like dumplings. 

They serve bread with rendered pork fat that makes butter feel like a fat-free food. 

Upon recommendation, we ordered the center cut breaded pork chop which is a very generous portion not unlike weinerschnitzel. The dish came with delicious &#34;gnocchi-like&#34; dumplings.

My wife and I were stuffed at this point, but we were pretty happy.

U Gazdy is worth a visit if you&#39;re ever in the mood or on a mission for very good Polish food. The owners are also wonderful. 

My wife and I are looking forward to going back for dinner to try their other menu items.",06/01/13,155,5,2,5,31,5.6936,3.334,0.405,12.262,No,1329

u-gazdy-wood-dale,Ericka A.,To0GTLW5MGZwOg5TxxZIQA,VbeuRR8q_l2V7zFCAGw2WQ,"Before I get into too much detail. Let me say that my meal was edible, but overpriced. On the other hand, my friend&#39;s food was amazing and practically a steal. I fully intend to come back and order what she had so I can give them a full five-stars.

The owner and all the employees and patrons were extremely friendly. They loved that we knew a handful of Polish phrases even though we were both clearly a couple generations removed from the old country. We loved the decor - delightfully kitsch with an abundance of wood paneling, carvings, animals hides, alcohol and cheesy 80s music. (ex. Total Eclipse of the Heart cover in English, but sung by a Polish woman with a thick accent)

On to the food portion of this tour. We were given a small loaf of bread and asked for a side of regular butter. My friend tells me they normally serve it with a side of bacon fat spread, which I&#39;ve had before and it is definitely an acquired taste. The crust was slightly hard and inside was fluffy, aka perfection. The same can be said for the creamy spinach soup. I don&#39;t know what spices were used, but it resembled vegeta/kucharek and was the perfect blend of seasoning and salt.

My main dish was a huge letdown. I still can&#39;t put my finger on it. The lamb chops were $25.50 and I expected a large portion and to be completely wowed. The size wasn&#39;t so bad for a single person, but it should have been at least half the price. Something about it tasted off. Not sure if it was the sauce, the meat, or a combination of the two. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but it hurts me to think I spent that much money and all I can say is that the presentation was beautiful and the grilled vegetables were good.

As far as I can tell, you&#39;re better off ordering a couple of the hot appetizers to make a meal. They are spot-on. And most other items on the menu seemed to be reasonably priced and done in the traditional way.",06/05/10,209,3,3,5,61,6.877599999999999,2.943,0.546,20.512000000000004,No,1922
u-gazdy-wood-dale,Don Z.,1dFC0YhcvFu1ibPVYTkEfA,B87G4MGzA92c9WH4cTUZPA,"U Gazdy is a tiny little place that looks like a log cabin.  The parking lot is tiny too, but I have only gone for lunch, so I always get a spot.  This place is dead at lunch time.

When you walk in the front door, you are immediately in front of the very small bar with maybe 10 stools.  I have not yet sat there.  Based on the proximity to the front door, I think it would be rather chilly in the winter.

Heading over to the right and towards the back is the main seating area.  Everything is made out of wood with an old fashioned, rough cut look.  Each table has a combination of chairs and bench seating.  I don&#39;t like the bench idea much because I need back support.

The staff is friendly and apparently all Polish.  Although I know a tiny bit of Polish, I have never been brave enough to try speaking it at U Gazdy.  It works out though, because they seem to understand English well enough.

The menu is filled with a good selection of traditional Polish dishes.  Since I have only been here a few times for lunch, I usually stick with the smaller things, like the U Gazdy sandwich, the kielbasa and the pierogi.  Everything is made as fresh as possible.  The pork cutlet is pounded out right after you order as told by the noise from the kitchen.  The pierogi are served freshly boiled.  This cooking style takes a bit longer, but it is worth the quality.  Don&#39;t be in a hurry if you come here.  To keep you busy while waiting, they start you off with some bread and pork lard spread.  It may not be the most healthy, but it sure is tasty!

Everything here expresses a sincere quality, from the rustic wood interior to the snappy yet friendly staff.  The sense of cultural pride is ever-present, but never pretentious or exclusive. 
The food is superbly done and presented in various stacks, piles and mounds that appeal directly to a primal joy firmly seated in the heart of every man (and some women, I&#39;m sure). So far I&#39;ve enjoyed some roast duck with gypsy fries and some pork escallops with dumplings and mushroom sauce. Both were excellent and paired very well with my ywiec porter. Prices are moderate considering the scope (some dishes leave you wondering if there&#39;s actually a plate under everything, or just more food).
On that note, I fully intend on taking on the Highlander Dinner (with a couple comrades, for certain) once the weather cools and I can trudge in from the wind and snow, and saddle up to a massive seemingly Flintstones-inspired pile of meat, potatoes and roasted vegetables, mug of porter in hand.",10/09/13,135,5,2,4,43,3.7779,1.415,0.23299999999999998,6.350999999999999,No,1157
u-gazdy-wood-dale,michael w.,Gp6ZWHBieHTRm0I-TU6FPg,0gpn9Ep0yZLizDxSk9tCjg,"A great place to meet with friends for catching up over polish beer, perogies, and a cozy atmosphere, but I have yet to find the entree that will keep me coming back. 

I have been here twice now. The only thing I recall from my first visit, was my entree was some stuffed pastry dish that was instantly forgetable, and that the soup I had (don&#39;t remember what) was so dern good that I ate my wife&#39;s portion and mine. 
On my second visit, I shared the duck with my wife - yuck! My plate had 3/4 gristle, fat and nasty on it, and only approximately a 1/4 meat was able to be salvaged off that bird. At $20 for the bird, is it &#39;that&#39; bird? Or is it bird in general? Not sure and I can&#39;t afford to find out. 
I admit that I am totally ignorant when it comes to polish food and unfortunately the polish in my party were not providing me much direction. I will say that the wait staff were more than accomodating on letting me try a taste, whether I was making a beer choice or trying to decide which soup to get. 
I will also give points for ethnic genuiness. This place is so genuine, that when you first walk in, you feel like the movie American Werewolf, when the two American guys get caught in the rain on the plains and step into the wolf bar (awkward) but not in a bad way.

My husband and I happened upon this place on their GRAND OPENING on a snowy day a few years ago and fell in love with the owners, Betty and Shawn, and everything about the place.

The building:  first of all, U Gazdy is located next door to Helen&#39;s Deli (HELLO!) and all the gorgeous and authentic woodwork was done by owner Shawn and I think his father-in-law if I remember the story right. Ask them about the beautiful murals while you are there- they show landscaping of the Highlands of Poland, which is where their families are from. My husband and I love to sit at the bar because of the beautiful woodwork and listen to all the regulars speak Polish. We are not Polish but the servers all speak Polish and it seems to be a home away from home for many.

The food:  P.i.e.r.o.g.i.s.  AMAZING!  The meat pierogis are my favorite (with a side of bacon and its grease to pour on top if you desire - I DO) followed by the Potato and Cheese. We usually order the Pierogis with an entree.  We personally love the cutlet or potato pancake with goulash dishes.  You always know when someone is ordering a cutlet because  you hear the pounding from the kitchen into the dining room.

Probably the worst was they served our children, without asking us, first - as in, 25 full minutes before our meal was served. Yes, you read that right. This is not a place I expect to have a 2 hour meal, esp when we arrive for dinner with the elderly in-laws, at 5pm.

I was feeling like some BBQ beef. We happened to be across the street from Chubby&#39;s Gyros. From the name of the place, I thought they only served Gyros. Well, they don&#39;t! Their menu is quite big and, there&#39;s everything from burgers, to beef sandwiches, to nachos, to chicken and ribs, etc.

I ordered a BBQ beef sandwich and fries. This sandwich was very good. I really liked the sauce. It had a bit of a kick to it. Very, very tasty. The fries were great as well. 

My son chose the nachos. Those nachos looked really good too!

I&#39;m going back sometime to try a burger, the chicken, and a good &#39;ol Italian beef sandwich with mozzarella (on garlic bread if they have it). LOL

We went to a graduation party last weekend that had been catered by Chubby&#39;s. My friends ordered the mostaccioli, Greek Chicken and a 6 foot sub. 

The food was delicious! Especially the Greek Chicken. My 8 year old daughter could not get enough.

I was with my friends the day they placed the order. It was quick and super simple (after we ate lunch, they walked up to the counter and ordered. Super easy). On the day if the party, they picked the food up and it was still hot when they arrived back at the house.

They use a nice thick cut of tomato, and fresh lettuce, so the burger feels like something you would make at home and take your time making it well. The fries, while better than Downtown Dogs, are not quite at the level of Dante&#39;s (now Johnny D&#39;s). They&#39;re still very good though, with a thicker cut, and these too were obviously fresh from the fryer, as they were almost too hot to eat for a while after I got them.

In a town full of chain restaurants Chubby&#39;s offers an oasis of good food.  I usually get the Cheesy Beef with hot peppers but my other favorites are of course the gyros and the bacon cheeseburger.  

For dinner I usually get the souvlaki or chicken kabob.  The quality of the souvlaki and kabobs will rival any that you will find in Greektown...and I should know because I went to school at UIC.  Tender, flavorful and seasoned just right....it melts in your mouth.

My friend&#39;s 4 year old daughter gets the Grilled Cheese meal each time we go there.  She loves that it comes with fries, drink,  a pickle  and ice cream.  She also gets a kick each time the owners call her cutie. As we walked out of the restaurant on our last visit she said &#34;this place is the best restaurant we&#39;ve ever been to&#34;.  

I spent 4 years working in marketing with Wendy&#39;s founder Dave Thomas.  He had a passion for making sure his employees treated customers like family and for serving the finest, freshest food he could.  As we traveled the country shooting commercials we would stop in at local restaurants to see what we could learn from other restauranteurs.  Most of the time he would point out all the things they were doing wrong.  But Chubby&#39;s is the kind of place where  Dave would have commended the owners on the quality of their food and their outstanding service.

chubbys-gyros-algonquin,Linda S.,GTmrNKkBD_hUEiTRx3xSGQ,ZXNsv6e8NOmoSC3kLtKS-w,My hairdresser 2 best friends and grocery clerk at the Jewel  have all had terrible experiences here. All of us refuse to go into this restaurant ever again.  I was sharing my awful experience one day and was shocked to hear that they had equally bad experiences with rude owner and his wife.   There is a common theme among our complaints. They cannot seem to get an order right and when they make a mistake they go to great lengths to humiliate you and make you think it is your fault.  I had three such bad instances before I decided I&#39;ll never  step foot in the place again. The last incident was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. During a prior visit they had forgotten the cucumber sauce for my gyros and because I was in a hurry I did not travel back the 7 miles when I realized it was missing  I call the restaurant and the male owner first tried to convince me that I was crazy and then he finally said that I should mention that next time I was in and he would give me an extra sauce. I gave him my name and I returned only a week later and I reminded him when I place the order that he forgot the sauce last time and that he said he would give me an extra one this time. Well he started lecturing me about wanting to get stuff for free and being dishonest and wanting to bankrupt his restaurant.... For a small container of size that probably cost him about 5 cents. Well that five cents that he argued about has cost him probably about a hundred dollars a month in business that I used to give him. I am over 50 and and in my entire life have never met a business owner like this before. There are other good choices in the area and only someone who fell desperate should even consider this place. For the few of you who wonder why the bad reviews: it sounds like you may have gone into the restaurants occasionally and got lucky on the one time but trust me if you go regularly like I used to go you will start to know the nastiness of the owners and realize that service and courtesy to Customer is far more important than the food Anderson quality is just so so anyway quite frankly. I have to snicker when I look at the help wanted signs every month go up and down every month. Having known someone who worked there it sounds like they are equally nasty to their employees too and can&#39;t keep them around either,21/04/15,224,1,1,-1,-60,-1.8104999999999998,1.5190000000000001,2.277,12.203999999999999,No,2343

They were so bad, in fact, that my husband and I couldn&#39;t finish them. We threw them out and went to Big Sammy&#39;s instead.

My school was doing a dine and share fundraiser, so I figured I&#39;d give Chubby&#39;s a try. The service was fine, but the food was not. The chicken gyros are a joke. The meat has a strange, rubbery texture (it&#39;s not actual chicken breast; it&#39;s some kind of pressed meat) and is dry as shoe leather. The pita is ice cold. The toppings, such as they are, consist of a small amount of wilted, brown-around-the-edges shredded iceberg lettuce and one tiny (and I do mean tiny) slice of under-ripe tomato, cut in half. No onions, no cucumber, no feta cheese. For sauce, they gave me a small cup of honey mustard salad dressing. Really? For a gyro? 

My husband got the actual gyro, which he said was awful (and it had the same limp lettuce and tomato slice as mine did). His did have gyro sauce, but not much of it, not enough to render the dried-out, chewy gyro meat edible.

The fries were OK -- I&#39;ll give them that. The onion rings were just average, with kind of a soggy texture and not much flavor. 

Perhaps there are other menu items this restaurant does better, like hamburgers or hot dogs, but given the fact that a Greek-style fast food place can&#39;t even do a gyro properly, I don&#39;t feel inclined to head back to Chubby&#39;s anytime soon.",22/09/11,193,1,2,-2,28,-2.2228000000000003,0.956,1.834,15.210000000000003,No,1538

---------------
I finally made it back to Chubby&#39;s and had the Souvlaki again.  This time it was just as delicious as the first time and I experienced **no illness**.  I am sure the problem I had the first time was an unusual occurrence.  I told a friend of mine about how the owner apologized and she&#39;s been a regular for over a year.  Thumb&#39;s up on Chubby&#39;s Gyros!!!

Update #3:
---------------
Have to say I am impressed again.  The owner called me to give a sincere and heartfelt apology for  treating me the way she did which I accepted.  The illness I felt was not severe and not different than what I have experienced at many other restaurants.  I will give them another try, order the same thing and see if it happens again.

Update #2:
---------------
Now I double and triple apologize!  I was trying to be nice by bringing the problem to the owner&#39;s attention and just got **chewed out** by the owner!  I was nice, I complimented the food, I told her I did not want a refund; that I was just trying to help.  UNBELIEVABLE!

Update #1:
---------------
Ok, folks, my apologies.  It tasted great going in, but now I am not feeling well (one hour later).  Someone needs to call the health inspector - they definitely have a problem over there.  If you ever decide to eat at Chubby&#39;s, wait 24 hours before writing your review.  

This is my original review:
------------------------------------

We live one mile from Chubby&#39;s so I&#39;ve always wanted to stop in.  I finally did, today, and have to say, I was very impressed!  

First off, the decor is quite nice considering the place has a fairly typical Greek-style fast food menu.  You could even have a business meeting here.  

Second, the ordering staff was friendly, but what I really liked is they have someone watching the tables and bringing the food out.  He even went back for napkins and silverware and was very friendly.

I tried the Souvlaki sandwich.  It is pieces of char broiled seasoned pork with lemon juice and tzatziki (cucumber) sauce on the side, served on a grilled pita.  It was fantastic!  The reason I liked it so much is that the pork is very moist and tender.  Sure, it&#39;s not pork tenderloin (not at the $5.50 price of the sandwich), but whatever they did to it was just right to make it tender and juicy.  

I really don&#39;t understand the complaints in the other reviews because I find it very hard to believe the Chubbies I experienced today is the same Chubbies described in the older reviews.  I will go back in the future and try some of the items people complained about to get to the bottom of it. 

If you live in Algonquin or happen to visit, give Chubbies a try.  It is the only gyro place around here, so it&#39;s worth giving them a chance.",17/09/12,292,5,3,5,56,7.356899999999998,6.107999999999999,1.272,24.620999999999995,No,2784

DH had the souvlaki - the pork was nicely done (not overdone) - came with a fantastic cucumber sauce and he chose roasted potatoes. He REALLY enjoyed it.

I had the philly steak sandwich and onion rings. Onion Rings were great - nice beer batter. The philly was near perfect. It was fairly wet (juices from the onions and peppers) and not dry. Camewith a copious amount of cheese - really good.

Because the customers I encountered here were so very nice and helpful.  I was standing in front of the wall menu/counter trying to decide what to order and several customers made sure that I had a number ticket so I wouldn&#39;t be overlooked when it came time to order.  AND each time I have entered or left Franco&#39;s when I have visited, some customer always opens the door for me.  Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve always had the little boy with me, or maybe because they see how heavy the baby carrier is, or maybe there&#39;s something about Franco&#39;s that makes everyone warm and fuzzy. 

I guess it goes to show the kind of people Franco&#39;s attracts.  This restaurant/deli/bakery certainly has a family feel to it.  The folks behind the counter have always been cheerful and ready to help. So perhaps their friendliness is contagious?  

But friendliness can only go so far to make me a return visitor...and the food passes that test.  I&#39;ve dined in and taken food to-go several times now and each time has been a good visit.  I love their marinara sauce, great fresh tomato flavor with just a tiny bit of zing. Their meatballs are also well-made and tasty.  The Pasta Fagioli is filling and really warms you up on a cold day.  Do not overlook their pastry case--it&#39;s kind of hard not to as everything looks perfectly made.

It&#39;s well kept, the people are friendly, and although I have not had the baked goods or coffee, they look delicious. But I would rather go almost anywhere else for lunch because the food I have had has not been awesome. 

Have you ever supported the Cub Scouts by going to one of their dinners held at a local church or whatever? And then you get there and they have spaghetti or mostacciolli or hot roast beef sandwiches, and after the first bite you say &#34;Nope. Not worth the money or the support&#34; because the beef tastes like a bar of iron and the noodles are overcooled and flavorless and everything is greasy and needs a good hit of salt? And the salad is kind of &#34;staple&#34; and the dressing is not knocking your socks off? Have you ever had that experience? Well I have. And I&#39;m reminded of it every time I go to Franco&#39;s. 

Franco&#39;s is a a small restaurant, inexplicably (in my opinion) loved by all that is located just behind the Sonic off of Barrington Road sort of near an industrial complex. The restaurant is kind of ordinary- neither a hole in the wall, nor atmospheric in any way, but it&#39;s clean and well kept. Again, the employees are friendly, and the food portions are generous. It is mostly a busy place, at least it has been busy every time I have gone with the people at work for lunch. Sadly, in the three times I have gone, it has only ever disappointed me. I would rather have a deli sandwich from Mariano&#39;s up the street or Italian from almost any other Italian restaurant instead, (save Olive Garden). Honestly though, every time I am there, I just wish I was across the street at El Rodeo eating what may well be the finest tacos in all of Chicagoland (I am prepared to admit fault with this assessment upon tasting better tacos in the area). Perhaps I need to speak up more when my co-workers drag me along for lunch. 

By my observations, if you like this place, you will love it. Otherwise, like me, you&#39;ll be kind of unimpressed and wish you could walk away from your work friends and go eat elsewhere. Either way, good luck.",14/03/14,238,2,2,5,27,5.4645,3.8320000000000003,1.201,15.966000000000001,No,2129

Its sort of hidden back there but so glad we found this little &#34;hidden gem&#34;!  My family and I have tried the Italian sausage, pizza, the frozen soups (yum), the bread and OF COURSE PASTRIES!  My favorite is their famous sticks which are filled with apple, chocolate, cherries, lemon, nutella and more!  I love that this is a quaint little Italian place, its family owned, I met Franco and he is the sweetest man, you want to just hug him and call him nonno!  John, his son is wonderful.  he made us a big cannoli for the holidays one year and my family kept calling it the HOLY CANNOLI and they posted pics on facebook (they were impressed).  Give it a try if you have a party, I ordered it twice for Christmas and for my kids graduation.   I love the authentic Italian food, I know its made fresh daily and they cook non-stop.   Being authentic Italian myself (born in bari) I only like biscottis and cappuccino for breakfast so what I really go in for now is 14 biscotti&#39;s (7 plain and 7 almond), as soon as I walk in the staff knows what I want since I go in every sunday like clockwork and order the same exact thing :)

They have all of the Italian treats that you remember from your childhood.  From the giant cannoli to the little cookies covered with sprinkles.  They have good sandwiches on homemade bread.  They have arancini and sausage and peppers.  For those who don&#39;t know arancini are basically rice balls covered with breadcrumbs and fried.  Then you eat them with gravy.  They are good and you can&#39;t get stuff like this everywhere.  The little lady behind the counter is great.  The place is a little on the pricey side so bring your debit card.

francos-cucina-italian-bakery-and-deli-streamwood,Cinder M.,3suYtAMUUkGJAVQrIdLzkw,x4QjGjdgDyLJgn70BrBglw,"I have been using them for years for catering our events. Unfortunately, that will no longer be the case. Something has clearly gone downhill.
Normally we do the food, cake and cannoli. This time the beef was provided by a family member and we did chicken and sausage and peppers from Mariano&#39;s. So we ordered the cannoli shells and 2 cakes - (2 different events going on.) The girl read my order back and it was correct. We paid for it. She also informed me they didn&#39;t provide the Barbie doll for the top of the cake.
My daughter went to pick up the cake and got it home. No room for a Barbie doll or the alcohol bottles. So they said, &#34;Bring it back we&#39;ll fix it.&#34; No compensation for the return drive 1 hr before the party. They did fix it, but the left off the roses . WTF? 
So when it comes time to cut the cake, the fillings were wrong!!! It was too late at this point as they were closed. So the next morning we called and spoke with someone. He apologized and said that it was put in the computer that way. Not our fault. But he did offer a 2 $10 gift certificates - no expiration date &#34;so if it takes you awhile to come back they won&#39;t expire.&#34; 
Now here is the really funny part,  later on in the day, when we had leftovers, my son cuts into the cake and discovers that the one has the correct filling on only half of the cake. So they cut into the other side of the other cake and its correct there. Why would they make half of each cake the opposite of what it should be? Well we will probably use the gift certificates for the cannoli - you can&#39;t mess that up. But we will be done much to my sadness. We&#39;ve used them for almost all of my childrens events. This was the last graduation, however I have a grandson now and there are many other places that offer catering. Wish things could have turned out better, but $20 for a $95 order doesn&#39;t cut it.",23/06/13,202,2,1,1,-53,0.1200000000000001,2.321,2.806,23.871000000000002,No,1908

The service was fantastic, but I was not all that impressed with the sushi. I am a sushi addict, so I am known to be a bit picky. 

I enjoy the raw sushi. I ordered the Philly and crazy rolls. Both of these were good and nice portions. The cucumber salad that they give you was super yummy and the miso soup was ok. I prefer mine with green onion and a little more tofu and seaweed. The overall taste was good tough. Also the hot tea was really good. 

So what is the problem you ask? My mom only certain maki rolls usually the ones that are deep fried. The new asahi roll was terrible. I think that if your roll is named after the restaurant it should be pretty dang good. The roll was burnt and dry. The roll was deep fries so long that the fish inside was over cooked. The amount of fish in the roll was pretty weak as well. I could not even palate it. And I never waste food.

However, by the end of our meal it was packed. Service was very nice throughout the meal and the food was A-OK but nothing blew me away and I didn&#39;t find anything great.

We started off with Age-Dashi Tofu $5 as I had been having a craving for a while. It was a solid Agadashi Tofu, well made and well flavored. We were brought out a cucumber salad  with bits of crab in it which was pretty yummy, as well. 

We went with three rolls all of which were presented beautifully and well made. The Philadelphia roll ($7) was very good, but it can&#39;t claim the honor of being the best Philly roll I&#39;ve ever had. We also got the Hawaiian Roll ($13) with spicy tuna topped with fresh tuna &amp; sesame sauce. I didn&#39;t like this roll one bit. The sesame sauce on top was not good &amp; had a very strange consistency to it. Without it, this may have been a decent roll but there was too much of it and I couldn&#39;t get through it. If you look at my picture you can tell the sauce doesn&#39;t look too appealing. Also, it said spicy tuna and I really didn&#39;t get much spice at all. I&#39;m a weaksauce when it comes to spice so that&#39;s really saying something. We also got the Godzilla Roll ($14) which has fried eel, cream cheese and what they call yum yum (imitation crab) wrapped in soy paper topped with avocado. This roll was definitely the best of the bunch and I surprised myself by liking it so much! Although this was the tastiest roll, it was the loosest in terms of how it was rolled. It didn&#39;t stay together quite as well as the other two rolls.

We ended our meal with red bean &amp; green tea ice cream both of which tasted a bit off. I had the red bean which was off but still edible. Being my favorite ice cream, I finished the dish. My friend&#39;s green tea tasted so strange though that he didn&#39;t even touch it after a couple of bites. A previous review mentioned the ice cream is $6...Well it&#39;s $3.50 now and you get quite a big dish. But skip it.

It is a small place that has you feeling like you stepped into a small sushi restaurant in Japan.  The service is amazing and you feel very welcome the second you walk in the door.  

There are always people inside drinking, talking, and of course eating at the bar even though it is so small - it seems that only regulars go there and the employees know everyone that comes in.  They even have special greetings for certain people and will give them a big hello and goodbye when they are there.  Chat with everyone like they have known them for years.

Their hot tea is perfect Japanese style, they give you a light cucumber salad, and sushi can be made however you want it, all you need to do is ask and they will make it happen.  

The spicy tuna dip for an appetizer is very good and the desserts are all great, my favorite being the fried bananas with chocolate sauce, basically the best fried thing I can think of!

The joint is a on the small side (again, nothing wrong with small place or being in a strip mall, we are here to chat about the food goods, no?) 

We got the spicy salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, spider roll, fire bird, and something off their &#34;special&#34; menu. (I forgot, sorry) They all taste the way they should, spicy, crunchy, etc...but all the rolls had one thing in common: the rice was far too smushy. It&#39;s hard to eat large rolls when the rice is that texture. Also, I am a uber salmon fan, and there were almost no RARE salmon rolls. There were several cooked salmon rolls, however.  I am fairly sure there is a reason for that: the salmon is not very good here and tastes a bit fishy. Duh, I know it&#39;s supposed to taste like fish, but fishy in a bad way, you know? The spicy salmon roll is actually not on the menu, but we ordered it so we can compare apples to apples in sushi places. Oddly enough, there were fish eggs in our spicy salmon but not in the spicy tuna? So, come here for other fish, but not the salmon! 

Service was ok, atmosphere was homey, but they didn&#39;t ask us if we wanted dessert or not, so I can&#39;t write a review on the sweets here.",14/10/10,170,3,2,1,32,0.03599999999999992,0.8739999999999999,1.17,13.957,No,1310

asahi-palatine,Cory W.,5GsjJlLioMNtLPjzWH_VJA,Cwc_DQr2qIib9lUnjExNFQ,"Well... both my wife and I wanted to like this place more than we did.  Service was very good, the surroundings were, ah, &#34;basic&#34;.  But at the end of the day, the reason you go to a mid-range restaurant is for the food.

We started with the miso soup, which was very good, and the iced tea actually tasted like tea and not tea-flavored water -- so a good start.  The complimentary little cucumber salad was OK.

We then had the tuna tartare, which had a recommendation from another reviewer.  The tartare itself was quite good, but the chips were pita chips right out of the fryer (still hot and practically dripping oil).  They would do well to bake their ships or dry them off or something, because grease just doesn&#39;t go well with sushi generally.

We then had two maki rolls - the &#34;firebird&#34; (spicy tuna with sweet sauce topped w/fried shrimp roll) and the &#34;dream roll&#34; (yellowtail, radish w/wasabi mayo, tempura and tobiko).  So, a big tuna night.  My wife and I both agreed that we liked the taste of the firebird better and the texture of the dream roll better, but unfortunately we didn&#39;t get good texture and good taste in the same roll.  As another reviewer mentioned, we also found the rice to be a bit mushy.

We didn&#39;t have dessert, but we did take advantage of the coupons on their website (15% off a meal over $30 right now) -- if you go make sure to check their site for coupons.

Maybe the other rolls are superior, but after we walked out neither of us was inclined to go back and see.

I&#39;ve lived in Palatine for three years now and have never tried this place. I finally stopped by on one of my few lunch breaks and ordered food to take back to work with me. I was starved, so I ordered alot. While I waited, I noticed signs for specials on the wall that were some crazy, eclectic makis that I wish I saw before, but I&#39;ll have to save that for another day. The service was very friendly and quick-my order was ready much faster than they said it was going to be. 
I started with the chicken teriyaki lunch special that came with miso soup and salad. The chicken was a little dry on the outside and the texture was close to tofu. The rice was nice and sticky and the veggies were steamed yet still crisp. The miso soup was ok, I&#39;ve never been a miso connoisseur- I just slurp it down. The salad was ok and the dressing was a ginger and maybe peanut mix, I liked it. 
On to the sushi: 
I ordered the Yum-Yum roll (spicy crab) and the Spider roll. These were some FRESH rolls! The Yum-Yum pieces all held their shape, but when you put them in your mouth, they melted into this wonderful bite. I&#39;m surprised this roll was only $5.50 considering this doesn&#39;t taste like imitation crab. 
And for the piece de resistance: the Spider roll-this is the most interesting spider roll I&#39;ve ever eaten. There&#39;s not only fried soft shell crab in here, oh no, there&#39;s also fish egg and lettuce (?) as well. Now, I&#39;m totally down with the fish egg, but the lettuce was strange to see in it and I wouldn&#39;t even have noticed if wasn&#39;t sticking out as much as the crab&#39;s legs were. 
Everything got my approval, but I can&#39;t believe I ate the whole thing. Now I&#39;m drowsy and full and wanting a nap. unfortunately, I&#39;m still at work so I&#39;ll have to wait until later. I&#39;m so stuffed I&#39;d say &#34;I&#39;m never eating again&#34;....but who am I kidding?",10/07/09,223,4,1,4,-11,3.6146000000000003,3.064,1.107,18.83,No,1967

Before, I knew that I could choose any Sunday and Cynthia and Sandy would be there. These two waitresses are amazing! They do a great job at making sure that everything is okay. The recent change in management has really changed things. They recently made it so that Cynthia and Sandy would be working brunch every other Sunday. I don&#39;t just go to brunch for the food, I go because I love talking to Cynthia and Sandy. My family does not go to brunch if they are not there. With this new rule, we have to call ahead and ask if Cynthia and Sandy will be there. If they are not going to be there, then we don&#39;t go to brunch. 

I have also noticed a decline in the food recently. Creme brle is not made with banana pudding. The past couple of times that I have been there, it has been made with the banana pudding. It&#39;s disgusting.

I wish I would have checked Yelp before my husband and I decided to drop one hundred and thirty seven dollars here last night plus tip. I left feeling rotten about myself for having spent that much on one of the worst entrees I&#39;ve probably ever had at what&#39;s supposedly a nice place.

The app we had (sesame tuna, something that barely has to be cooked, pretty hard to mess up) and soups were all pretty good. The $8.50 glass of Pinot blanc I had tasted like the bottle had been open for a day or two. Not great. We had to ask our server to bring us bread with the soups. Asked for market prices on King crab and cold water lobster tail and they were beyond ridiculous. I can hardly believe that&#39;s &#34;Market Price&#34; so we passed. Got the warm water lobster tail which I&#39;ve had at other places in the past and enjoyed. When this thing came out it LOOKED awesome. I was so excited and didn&#39;t mind the little extra we were spending. Then I took a bite. This thing was literally inedible. It seemed not only over cooked, but horrible quality. I could hardly chew it and it has absolutely zero flavor. Im a big foodie but I literally lost my appetite after trying to eat it. Ugh. I was so disappointed and my husband felt bad so he let me have his fish trio which was also pretty dry and not wonderful, but a bit better than the lobster. The sides it came with were some mushy vegetables and baked potato that tasted like it had been sitting cooked for 2 days then reheated. They don&#39;t even include a dinner salad for the ridiculous prices they charge for mediocre quality food. The waitress had to have seen we were visibly upset and only asked how we were doing once and that was before I had even taken a bite of anything. She was nice, just not very observant or else didn&#39;t have the guts to inquire why we had completely traded entrees. I used to be a server so I&#39;m not one to make a big fuss or try to send back a fifty dollar plate of food, but I also know as a server it&#39;s my responsibility to make sure my guests are happy. The bus boy was nice and kept our waters full, so kudos to him.

The only issue i have run into here was that the bar can get VERY noisy, even at lunch time. If you are looking for an intimate dinner for two, I recommend trying to avoid being seated near the bar for that reason. This is a great restaurant, and *most* of the food is worth the cost.

The soup trio is a must for any soup and seafood lover. The appetizer provides small servings of their three best selling soups : conch chowder, lobster bisque, and clam chowder.

However, even though I knew the prime rib was the special she never brought that to my attention.  But thats ok.

That&#39;s when I looked around and saw no one.  The wait took about 15 minutes even though the main dining room was only about 25% full and NOBODY was waiting to be seated.  I even went up to the bar and saw nobody there waiting for a table.

Went there Sunday eve as GF&#39;s parents wanted to go for seafood and we drove there from Schaumburg.  Should have gone to Shaw&#39;s.  Walk in the door and the first question out of the young girl was &#34;Do you have a reservation?&#34;  Not good evening, thanks for coming to our place, etc.  Then she kind of runs to the table on the middle level but the GF&#39;s parents are in their 80&#39;s--too fast.  After a couple of minutes we get water--that was good but it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come by--and you&#39;d think she was on a track meet she tried so fast to rush everybody.  I saw she was waiting on tables all around the place--she just couldn&#39;t cover that much ground.  On this Sunday it was about 90 degrees outside with high humidity and the inside of Port Edward was about 75---way too warm.

Parents ordered desert which they didn&#39;t finish--first time I&#39;ve every seen that.  Way too much chocolate in the Tiramisu.

There is even a little boat in a pond in the middle of the place and big fish that the kids can feed. Our food was decent without setting the world on fire (we skipped on the buffet). We started with oysters that were really good. I had the mahi mahi that was decent, veggies on the side overcooked. My wife the Hemmingway fish that she liked. The kiddos shared the fish and chips that they devoured. The ice cream also a hit with the kids meal. The accompanying bread was stale and should not bother serving. Pricing all very reasonable and some interesting beer selections. What brought it all undone was our matronly judgmental server who snatched the knife out of one year olds hand. I mean really what harm could be done? It would not have even cut the stale bread. At the end of the day no one cares for our child more than we do. To double down some goose from the kitchen walked by and pointed at our one year old playing with a teaspoon and gestured in panic. Our server said &#39;I know I have already taken a knife away&#39;.

This might be the largest Sunday buffet in Chicagoland.  We&#39;ve been coming here since I was a child, (so there might be a slight biased/nostalgic element to my 4-star rating).  

Port Edwards offers lots of seafood including: crab legs, shrimp, jambalaya, crayfish touffe, 2 soups and several other offerings.  The carving station typically has turkey, and one other meat (this past week the beef had outstanding flavor). Adjacent to the carving station is usually dressing, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  Another section of the buffet has typical breakfast fare including an omelette station and an eggs Benedict station.  There is also a section with an enormous variety of desserts (including a chocolate fountain for dipping fruit).  

The service is always very attentive and constantly filling the glasses (champaign, water, etc).  

With such a large selection of food negative people will find food to gripe about.  To that point I personally think the creme brle is lacking, (but I&#39;m a bit of a creme brle geek).   Likewise positive people will find plenty of food rave about - The eggs Benedict is eggcellent, and I love the crayfish touffe.

Walking in the restaurant had a strange, disjointed feel with little nooks and crannies and lots of levels and staircases that just came off as confusing. 

We approached the hostess and she asked if I had a reservation, which I did not have and she snipped back that a reservation is usually required but she&#39;d see what she could do. She then showed us to a remote far away back room set pretty far away from the buffet, and what I jokingly thought of as &#39;the room for the poor saps who don&#39;t have a reservation&#39;.

The buffet itself was fairly extensive with pretty much anything you could imagine and it all looked really fresh and fully stocked - however the layout was once again on all sorts of different levels and tucked in little corners which made the traffic flow very awkward. Even the plates (which were tucked away in a weird cabinet type thing) were hard to find. 

The food itself was pretty good over all. Some things were a little bit cold but it&#39;s really hard to keep that much food consistently hot and nothing was ridiculously cold. The London broil at the carving station was delicious.  

The brunch included champagne which I guess is a nice touch, if you like champagne which I just don&#39;t. 

I would never have paid the $74 for brunch for two people if we hadn&#39;t had the gift card. It just doesn&#39;t sit well with me to pay that kind of money for breakfast.

I like it though...it is like being in a old ship with a huge Koi pond in the middle. I found the service to be friendly and nice (not upscale but down home friendly). So me and my girlfriend ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell (Chefs recommendation). I had a Amstel light, my girlfriend had a glass of white wine. The oysters were ok, a couple made me kind of wonder if they were safe to eat. I love good raw oysters and in Chicago you can get some good ones....not as good as coastal cities like Boston, Seattle or Portland. I am just trying to paint a picture that I have eaten good seafood.  These were middle America scary....made you wonder if you were rolling the dice. So I try to be upbeat and say &#34;Ok, oysters aren&#39;t their thing&#34;. We split their Crab legs (2 pounds) which came with side salad and a baked potato.  The salad was very good....the potato they give you melted butter liquid substance like they give you for the crab legs. The crab legs were dungeoness crab legs and HUGE. So out of those two pounds, you got like 4-5 half legs. Just huge crab legs! We both started eating....the crab legs tasted off..... I don&#39;t know what was up with them. They tasted old and fishy!

So I had two beers, girlfriend has a glass of wine, a dozen oysters which were below $20, and some old tasting fishy crab legs. I got the bill it was $176.

Not everything is great, but there is a lot to like. First and foremost, all you can eat crab legs. I mean come on! If you love crab legs, you can spend three hours in the place up to your elbows in crab. I&#39;ve found them to be very fresh and always delicious. There are a ton of other great choices too. Crawfish ettouffe is terrific. The Eggs Benedict are great. Nice omelette bar. The carver station is great. There are a number of types of smoked fish and you can set yourself up with lox and bagels too. The desserts are good, and there are a ton of choices. 

The thing that makes the place for me beyond the massive selection of food is the fact that it is such a throwback. I don&#39;t think anything has changed in years. Your kids will love the koi pond. The waitstaff is dressed in a nautical theme. It seems like the place could have been featured in an Episode of Sponge Bob. If you have a good sense of humor and sense of nostalgia, you&#39;ll love it. If not, you should probably go someplace else. 

The final thing to note is that for brunch at least, the service is superior. Your champagne glass will never be empty. Same with water.

I&#39;m a breakfastier. A pioneer of breakfast places, dishes &amp; recipes if you will. There&#39;s something magical of being up early (Even better if I&#39;m not hung over) and starting my weekend day with a special meal. I think it makes me feel productive yet social ;) I like the basic breakfast stops, but sometimes your looking for something a little extra special, a BRUNCH!

Coffee? Yes! 
Fresh squeezed OJ? Please! 
Omelette station? Even better!!
Mimosas, crab legs, prime rib and dessert bar? Um, hell yeah!

Yes it&#39;s a little pricey, about $35 per person, but this is a beautifully set up brunch and worth the price. 

We went for my birthday celebration. We got there right when they opened at 9:30am because we didn&#39;t have a reservation. Our party of 5 was sat immediately in the main room. 

We all loved different parts of the brunch... Waffles with fresh fruit whipped cream and pudding was my favorite. I had some fun at the omelette station and seafood bar. I shot crab leg water in my mans face when I snapped a leg open! Whoopsie! 

They continuously filled our champagne glasses, which I generously deposited into my fresh OJ, for mimosas! After several return trips for more chocolate covered strawberries, we explored the restaurant, which has a pond with sailboat (inside), wine cellar, gift shop and huge outdoor patio that overlooks the Fox River. (I&#39;ll be hittin that patio for dinner &amp; drinks soon!)

After dinner we took a walk in the park along the river, because it was gorgeous, but mainly to stretch our bloated bellies! Don&#39;t judge! I don&#39;t eat like this every Sunday, it was my B-Day! 

Definitely try the Eggs Benedict, seafood paella, waffles with toppings, crab legs, dark chocolate covered strawberries, bread pudding, pecan pie &amp; the white chocolate fountain! YUM! Excuse me while I clean up the drool off my iPhone.

The restaurant was pretty slow and as a result we were sat right away. We were sat in the bar and were excited to see there was live entertainment. Our server was very accommodating and friendly, no issues there. The food however was sub par, especially for the prices. One person at our table ordered a fish and chips for $19 that just didn&#39;t live up to the 12$ fish and chips meal you can get at a number of surrounding restaurants.  All of the vegetables and potatoes that were served at our table were warm/cold, not hot.  The 40$ steak I ordered was just ok, it was cooked more medium than the medium rare I ordered. Anyways, I am not one to fuss as I have worked in the restaurant business before so I/we didn&#39;t say anything.  I really expect a lot more when prices are at a certain level.  Between the 6 of us our bill was around 350$. I left feeling that I could have gotten the same meal at a portion of the cost at some of the surrounding bars.  And just a tip...the sides served lacked inventiveness.  I ordered a red potato, and was served a potato that had literally been quartered and thrown on my plate (old school).",30/01/16,127,2,1,2,-6,1.9194,1.175,0.34099999999999997,12.482999999999999,No,1208

Walking in the restaurant had a strange, disjointed feel with little nooks and crannies and lots of levels and staircases that just came off as confusing. 

We approached the hostess and she asked if I had a reservation, which I did not have and she snipped back that a reservation is usually required but she&#39;d see what she could do. She then showed us to a remote far away back room set pretty far away from the buffet, and what I jokingly thought of as &#39;the room for the poor saps who don&#39;t have a reservation&#39;.

The buffet itself was fairly extensive with pretty much anything you could imagine and it all looked really fresh and fully stocked - however the layout was once again on all sorts of different levels and tucked in little corners which made the traffic flow very awkward. Even the plates (which were tucked away in a weird cabinet type thing) were hard to find. 

The food itself was pretty good over all. Some things were a little bit cold but it&#39;s really hard to keep that much food consistently hot and nothing was ridiculously cold. The London broil at the carving station was delicious.  

The brunch included champagne which I guess is a nice touch, if you like champagne which I just don&#39;t. 

I would never have paid the $74 for brunch for two people if we hadn&#39;t had the gift card. It just doesn&#39;t sit well with me to pay that kind of money for breakfast.

The oysters were ok, a couple made me kind of wonder if they were safe to eat.

We ordered a salad and Oysters Rockefeller for appetizers. The oysters were the size of dimes but the dish had good flavor. The blue cheese on my salad had a very sour taste and smell. I asked the waitress to bring me another cup. She said that blue cheese always smells bad. I agreed but said that this was not fresh. When she came back she put the cup of blue cheese under my nose and said, &#34;Does this smell better to you?&#34;. I told her it would be fine and thanked her.

Our entree tasted good and overall, we were happy with the taste of our food but for $90 there should have been sides included. Everything is a la cart.

First of all let me say that the service was excellent! We sat by the river and the decor was perfect. 
We are there Saturday April 4th at 6:15pm.
We ordered calamari and requested it grilled (oil instead of butter), and the server offered to have it cooked in white wine and garlic, which sounded delicious. When it arrived the calamari was floating in some liquid and tasted as though it&#39;d been boiled with no grill marks or any seasoning at all besides the wine and garlic. Even a pinch of salt would have been good. Do they get all their flavor from butter and not know how to make something flavorful without it? 
They left the calamari on the bill even though we sent it back - this is horrendous customer service. Because of this we will never return. Had they comped the appetizer or had a manager come over to the table we might consider it... but the rest of the meal continued a downward spiral anyway... so maybe not. 
For our entrees we we got two entrees with the intention to share. He ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye and I the 8oz Lobster tail. He had garlic mashed potatoes (that direly lacked in seasoning - again even a pinch of salt would have greatly helped) I had boiled potatoes and both entrees came with mixed veggies (again plain as hell)... and I ordered a side of the best asparagus I&#39;ve ever had - absolutely perfectly crisp with nice char marks and cooked perfectly through. The steak and lobster were a whole different story. The steak was medium to medium well when ordered medium rare. Yuck! The lobster was well over-cooked - tough and hard as if it&#39;s been microwaved. My husband couldn&#39;t even eat his half - but I had already eaten my half of the steak so he wasn&#39;t even satiated. 
We left wanting to stop at another restaurant still hungry and desperately wanting to redeem ourselves from such an awful culinary experience. 
The menu was great with plenty of yummy-sounding appetizers and side dishes to choose from and they offered many delicious cocktails. It seems a bit archaic though to be charging $4-5 extra for &#34;premium&#34; side items (like any other veggies beside potatoes) and not allowing any substitutions. 
All restaurants should be well prepared to cook alternatively for people with food sensitivities these days - to make grilled versions of their food that have zest, and pop with flavor even though they don&#39;t have dairy or butter (and gluten free options as well - which they may have had but we didn&#39;t ask). 
Servers should ALWAYS ask specifically about the steak being cooked to the proper doneness. 
Lobster shouldn&#39;t be brought to the table that looks like it&#39;s hard and tough. 
This was entirely too much money wasted. It was so disappointing to pay SO much money and walk away without feeling good about what we spent it on. Upscale pricing absolutely requires upscale eating and Port Edward&#39;s just misses the mark. 
Stay away, far away.

We went for Mother&#39;s Day brunch on Sunday and had a fairly positive experience. We had made reservations and when we checked in, we ended up being seated upstairs. My grandparents had forgot to mention we needed a downstairs table to accommodate their disabilities. The staff was very kind and got us seated downstairs in approximately 15 minutes. The buffet was very well-stocked, and everything was hot and fresh! I am very thankful for the staff who worked so hard yesterday to make it a nice experience. 

For the breakfast side, there was an omelet bar, eggs benedict, waffles, bacon, and blintzes. Kind of slim pickings, but to be fair, our reservations were at 3pm, so it was practically dinner at that point. There were also cheese plates, lox, and assorted cold fish. I had the eggs benedict, some cheese, and waffles to start, as well as some lox. I love the lox here! So delicious! The waffles were a little burnt, but not very hot, as the butter did not melt on them. I really liked the eggs benedict, hot and fresh! The lunch/dinner side was much preferable. There were cold salads, deviled eggs, paella, shrimp and rice, clams casino, a raw seafood bar, and a carving station. I had some of the turkey from the carving station and noticed they were out of stuffing. I stood and waited about five minutes and they still hadn&#39;t brought any out! One of the kitchen staff noticed I was waiting and told me they would bring some fresh stuffing to my table as it came out. I thought this was very nice, and they brought me a large helping. The turkey and gravy was excellent, and so was the macaroni and cheese. I had peel n eat shrimp from the raw bar, delicious! I sampled some of the crab legs from my brother&#39;s plate, and they were kind of dinky and didn&#39;t have a lot of meat. Desserts were okay, chocolate covered strawberries, a chocolate fountain, chocolate mousse, creme brulee. The creme brulee hadn&#39;t set properly before they torched it, so it was very runny. The mousse was good, as were the strawberries. 

I am giving it four stars because the seafood did not impress me as much, which is upsetting for a seafood place.

Port Edward has been around awhile circa late 1940&#39;s. Ed Wall wick is one of the best traveled Restauranteur in the country. He is well respected among his piers
and known for his generosity. Throughout the years of his operation he has traveled all over the world to get the most unique gifts in his store and is a fantastic place to go if you have someone special in mind.

His Brunch is known all over the Fox Valley and in the suburbs of Chicago as being one of the most complete. Many times our family over a period of 50 years have come here, because nothing else come close to the choices offered here. Prices?
Go to comparable re4stuarants and then compare their prices to Port Edward to make a fair comparison.

If you are in the restaurant business, over 50 years, you are doing something very right or the &#34;Market&#34; will shut you down~! When I said my family had been going here for over 50 years, that&#39;s the finest thing I could say.",06/11/14,134,5,1,3,9,2.3105,1.2189999999999999,0.253,11.527999999999999,No,1352

But- I digress. This restaurant is one of those oldies that has been in an area FOREVER and was a BIG DEAL back in the day but has not adapted-- with staff and service and thus is backsliding. Just my opinion. Years back (5+ or more) I&#39;d go here with my then boyfriend (who soon became my ex-husband but that&#39;s an entirely different story)-- the bar has FANTASTIC Bloody Mary&#39;s and fun bartenders. The view- by the water- outstanding. But-- the service -- well that&#39;s the killer. They don&#39;t have great service. They get ridiculously busy for buffet nights and there is no sense of urgency with customer service. One of the last times we went here- we had 10 people for a Friday night seafood buffet. We all had cocktails and 8 people ordered the buffet and two just wanted soup or salad. So-- I say this to reference, we had a solid check total going and I believe the tip is added in -- they actually came to our table and loudly yelled at my MOM for taking a bite of my salad because &#34;she didn&#39;t order the buffet&#34;. Having worked in restaurants myself for YEARS-- I know that freeloading cheapasses can come in to a buffet, order WATER and then one buffet and no one else orders and they think they can share. I get it- as a restaurant owner you&#39;d be annoyed. But TEN PEOPLE with cocktails and 8 buffet orders plus 2 individual food orders-- we aren&#39;t freeloading. And even if we ordered 10 meals vs. buffet, guess what my mom would take a damn bite of my salad. The server was relentless. I asked to speak to a manager thinking they&#39;d be sensible-- nope. She&#39;s like YOU CANNOT SHARE A BUFFET. MORON. I then wrote to the owner/manager after the visit and they wrote back very confrontational- &#34; Our video cameras showed your mother taking a bite of your salad, we should have billed you an extra buffet serving!&#34; -- FAIL.

So yeah, the place is old, pricey, a little outdated as far as interior decorations go, and has spider webs on the outside of the windows. 

But really, what do you expect? 

Port Edwards is a local legend for the Barrington Hill-ers. That old couple sitting at the corner of the bar has probably been claiming those two seats for 40 years now... and that bartender serving them? Yep, she knows their names, their favorite food, how long they&#39;ve been married, their kid&#39;s names, their kids&#39; kid&#39;s names, etc. It&#39;s THAT kind of place. 

Drinks lack consistency, but it makes it fun. First glass tastes like juice with a splash of liquor; the second is liquor with a splash of juice. The salmon is good ($25), the grouper sammie is blehh ($12), the steak sliders are delicious ($16). Oh! And that crab spread that comes with the bread is SO GOOD. 

The food isn&#39;t exactly what you&#39;d expect for the price you&#39;re paying, but it&#39;s really not about the food here. It&#39;s about the atmosphere, the ambiance, the tradition.

They&#39;ve got a guy on guitar serenading the restaurant on certain days. There&#39;s outdoor seating along the river, so you can watch all the rich folk pull up to the restaurant in their boats. Tables are filled with 3 generations of families. It&#39;s cute.

My husband and I have been loyal Port Edward&#39;s customers for the past 14 years. It has been our go-to special place for Valentine&#39;s Day and our anniversary. 

Although some may agree that the place is a bit outdated, we have enjoyed the unique atmosphere PE has offered over the years.

The price is always hard to swallow, however, we treat ourselves to a big Port Edward&#39;s dinner because we genuinely enjoy(ED) the food. My husband always ordered the 2lbs of King Crab Legs and I always ordered the Filet and King Crab (Dejonge Crust on the filet). The dinner never has disappointed us. My steak was always so flavorful and the King Crab was always delicious and sweet.

In the years past, they would have single roses available for purchase on V-day and one year they had a package where you could purchase a rose &amp; a fresh water pearl necklace. I thought that was such a unique idea and added a little something special for Valentine&#39;s Day.

This last Valentine&#39;s Day we made our traditional reservations. For some reason I wanted to look up reviews on Port Edward&#39;s. My search led me to here. I was quite shocked to see that there were some pretty bad reviews of one of my favorite places. I saw that people were stating that there is now a charge for a salad (there never used to be). I tried not to take too much merit in some of the other minor complaints because everyone has their own personal taste in food.

On our way to the restaurant, I told my husband of the bad reviews I saw and we just chalked it up to a difference in opinions. 

We waited a few mins after our reservation time and were seated way in the back of the resturant. A server came to take our drink order. After she left, we noticed the menu was completely different from what we remembered. Change can be good, however we were so dissapointed to see my favorite dish was no longer offered. Then my husband looked for his King Crab. It was $109.99! I am fully capable of understanding Market Prices, but come on. We have bought King Crab to prepare at home and 2lbs of King Crab is not $100. 

The server came back to take our order, however my husband wasn&#39;t ready because he had no idea what to even order now. Our server went to go help a wedding reception group nearby. We literally waited about 15 mins because she came back to take our order. I was pretty irritated that they didn&#39;t have specific (&amp; extra) staff to take care of the large wedding group, rather than have servers for tables go to serve cake. 

I ordered the Lobster Edwardo. (Beer battered lobster tail medallions w/Galley fries which was $65). I got 3 medallions which were good sized. The galley fries were disappointing, I literally got 5 small dime-sized potato pieces. Fresh green beans were served with the entree and I did appreciate that they were fresh not frozen or canned. The lobster medallions were unfortunately over-cooked. The meat was so dry and so rubbery. I had to chew so many times to be able to get it down. My husband&#39;s scallops were ok, but he was disappointed by the serving size for the price we were paying.We opted out of the salad(since it&#39;s now a charge) and drank water to keep the price down.

I really didn&#39;t have the opportunity to bring it to the server&#39;s attention. All the servers were so busy with this wedding group and another large group that we rarely saw them. She seemed overwelmed and not in good spirits. I am always reluctant to complain about food or ask to have something else prepared for the fear of servers or kitchen staff doing something to the food behind closed doors. (We&#39;ve seen it happen).

We tipped the server 20% even though it took 15 mins to get our order taken. I feel that on a busy day like Valentine&#39;s Day and having two large groups, management should have had specific staff serving those two parties. Other diners shouldn&#39;t get ignored because of large parties.

$100 later we were ready to go. We&#39;re so sad that it changed so much. That has always been our special place. I&#39;m sad to say we&#39;ll probably won&#39;t go back.",16/02/13,464,2,1,4,-19,3.8378000000000005,4.840999999999999,2.9730000000000003,41.18399999999999,No,4169

I am so sad when I think about what Port Edward used to be.  I hadn&#39;t been there in a few years (maybe 8 or 9), and had promised my husband a great dinner experience.  

We began with a couple of drinks, one of which strongly resembled Lysol, and which I sent back.  Our waitress&#39; comment was that she doesn&#39;t like the sour mix they serve.  (Nope, it didn&#39;t get removed from the check, nor was I offered a replacement on the house...)  The other mixed drink was incorrectly garnished, despite ordering it specifically.  Strike one.

I remembered the crab cakes being excellent, so requested them as an appetizer without looking at the menu.  They were no longer excellent - now passable - and the appetizer portion consisted of two cakes, each about 3&#34; in diameter, for $15.00.  Strike two.

At this point, I checked another restaurant we know to be awesome, to see if we could get a table.  We could.  But we were too chicken to just pay for the drinks and appetizer and dash, so we stayed.  Our bad.

The hubs wanted steak and king crab legs, and no such combos were spelled out on the menu, so he inquired as to the price to add on a crab leg.  One crab leg, $29.99.  With the addition, his NY strip and one crab leg would have been a $63 entree.  REALLY!?  Strike three.

Our server strongly steered us toward the dinner buffet.  We took a look at the offerings, and decided to go with it, in the interest of getting done and out of the place.  Dishes I tried from the buffet were overly seasoned and/or sauced, and nothing stood out as being worthy of taking seconds.  The hubs asked for crab legs and was handed a heaping plate of them; at least this gave the experience a little value.  The crab was so-so.  The paella that was strongly recommended by our waitress contained chicken on the bone and shell-on, tail-on shrimp (how does one eat that neatly??)  Strike four.

It was incredibly hot and stuffy in the area where we were seated.  When I overheard another diner complain to the waitress, I chimed in and agreed that it was really uncomfortable.  The response?  Loved this...&#34;well, at least you don&#39;t have to wear THIS!!&#34;...motioning to her sea-captain uniform top.  REALLY!?  I&#39;d think even just watching a few movies would give the average idiot a basic understanding of professionalism when working tables at a restaurant that tries to appear classy.  Strike five.

One had the pasta dish which was described as wonderful, I had the duo of scallops and tenderloin tips was beautifully presented and delicious, with a tasty polenta cake. Our server Ammee was great, too. While the other 3 had liquid desserts, I opted for the special chocolate creme brle, which was great, too.

montarra-algonquin,Rich W.,sKAi8D8LcfMDvN6oC6seog,stXC-4Iz3El11tmdfbnm2A,"Montarra Grill Re-visited:

Based on my last review of Montarra Grill,  wrote a letter of complaint to the executive chef.  It took a while to receive a response, but about 2 weeks ago, a reply from from Chef Dave Perlick appeared in my mailbox.

In short, it was a letter of apology  for my disappointing experience, and invited me to return and give Montarra another try for a complimentary dinner for two.  My companion and I took advantage of the invitation this week.

Based on this visit, it was  necessary upgrade my rating to 5 stars.     

My companion eats no meat, as such, only seafood.  In his letter, Executive Chef Perlick offered to prepare an appetizer for two of his choosing.  We advised the server of my companion&#39;s preferences, and  were served a crab cake  and snow-crab legs each with its own special sauce.  It really was very excellent.  

For entrees, my companion again chose the blackened sea bass, and I chose the 6 oz. filet with foie gras and truffle, prepared to just a bit rarer than medium rare. It was ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!  So tender and juicy, it was the best filet I have ever enjoyed.  We shared a bottle of cabernet sauvignon with our entrees.

After finishing our entrees, Chef Dave Perlick visited our table to check on our satisfaction, and also to answer some questions we had regarding the establishment of Montarra Grill. 

For dessert we decided to choose different  selections that we felt would complement each other and share them.  She chose a positively decadent cheese cake and I selected a (blood) orange sorbet with a mixed berry sauce. Eaten together, the result was a fantastic completion to an exceptional dining experience.

Again, the service was as good as the food.

Montarra will continue to be on our dining pleasure list.",27/04/16,200,5,1,5,9,5.5737000000000005,3.5469999999999997,0.431,16.022000000000002,No,1792

Almost everything else was really delicious (French onion soup comed in a giant Vidalia onion which I took home and made into spaghetti sauce today), but I won&#39;t be ordering the steaks we got again. My strip was gristly and my husband said he didn&#39;t like his rib eye even as much as the one he gets at Outback. Maybe filet is better?

Still worth going through. We&#39;re trying the bouliabasse next time.

She kindly informed us that we have about 25 minutes to pay our bill and leave,because our table had another reservation at 6:15.

My husband and I came here recently for my milestone birthday. Upon arriving, the hostess was incredibly friendly and accommodating. She wished me a happy birthday and gave us printed menus specially for my day.

Our server was incredibly kind and knowledgeable. She did a fantastic job on making sure we had everything we needed, but not being overly obnoxious and intrusive through our meal. 

We enjoyed cocktails, beer, and wine -- all pleased with our selections. Our server recommended the special for our appetizer, which was a brie and fresh corn risotto with pork belly. Okay ... this is where I have no words, really! It was so delicious! The risotto was not mushy, just the perfect consistency. The brie flavor was present, but didn&#39;t reach that &#39;funky&#39; taste that brie can have. It was perfectly balanced with the sweet corn and the pork belly, which was seared to perfection and not fatty. A great way to start the evening!

Our main courses were phenomenal as well. While I can understand why some other Yelpers weren&#39;t happy with the portion size, as I see it it&#39;s better to have quality over quantity. I ordered the confit garlic crusted filet mignon, and it is hands down the best filet I&#39;ve ever eaten. Oftentimes, filet can be quite flavorless, but this filet was incredibly tender, moist, tasty, and cooked to the perfect medium. The garlic crust!? Amen. Amazing. My husband ordered off the specials -- a sea bass with poblano and cilantro basmati rice. He really enjoyed it and said the fish was fresh and cooked perfectly. 

We were too full for dessert unfortunately, but it gives us an extra reason to come back to Montarra to sample their desserts! We&#39;d even come back for just drinks with their delicious homemade parmesan flat bread. Yum yum yum! Our hats off to the chef.

montarra-algonquin,Brian F.,9Aa5gIB0UBE4oF7KxvCNhA,7VXfe-98-I92lrBfciTlfw,"We celebrated Valentine&#39;s Day early at this modern American restaurant and boy, were we surprised by the look and feel of the inside. The space with the Chihuly chandelier was taken up by a small private party, but we were seated in a comfortable tall booth. My wife commented on how, with the shades drawn down, you could easily forget you were in the country, let alone in the Algonquin area. The ambience was classy, but not too dark and the service was attentive and patient.

Most of the food was excellent, fresh and full of flavor.

For starters, we got the Maine Lobster Won Tons, which we do not recommend. Though one piece had a giant portion of lobster claw, the others didn&#39;t seem to have even portions. The wrapper was fried perfectly, but the flavor did not stand out as unique.

The other starter was on the specials menu, and it was an Arugula Salad with an Egg and pieces of bacon. I don&#39;t remember the dressing, which makes me sad, because it really tied all the flavors of the dish together. Highly recommend this if it&#39;s on the menu when you get there.

For entrees, I got the Bouillabaisse Montarra, because I&#39;m a sucker for seafood. The mussels were my favorite part, tasting like they were just picked from the sea. The scallops and shrimp were also cooked perfectly tender. The soup was a wonderful combination of savory spices and I made sure to finish until the last drop.

My wife got the Churrasco Skirt Steak, which was cooked exactly to the medium rare she requested. My favorite part of this dish was the Sweet Potato/Chorizo Hash, which merged the salty and sweet so well.

Why did this place fall short of 5 stars? The hostess! She didn&#39;t welcome us warmly when we came in, and though we had reservations, she simply said, &#34;Two?&#34;, grabbed menus and immediately turned to walk away. When I let her know we had reservations, she dismissed it as if to say, &#34;Can&#39;t you see we have plenty of open tables?&#34; On the way out, she was busy fussing with papers at her station and I had to say goodnight in order for her to look up and acknowledge that we were leaving.

However, this place is so beautiful and was so consistently excellent in the past that we decided to give it another try last month.

Very glad we went back - still not 100% what it used to be, but the food was the right temp this time (and elegantly accessible if that makes sense), we had a cloth on the table, and the restroom was much cleaner.

 We had a reservation but were seated in the bar area which has a totally different vibe than the restaurant section...something to note if you care about that when making a reservation for yourself (restaurant area seems darker and more romantic)  We got one appetizer for the table, bacon-wrapped dates, and they were tasty.  Each of us tried a different seafood dish, and they were all good too. Just nothing mind-blowing.  It&#39;s a little overpriced for what it is.

The first time started out ok, service seemed good until a large party arrived shortly after receiving our food and our table of 2 was forgotten.  Maybe i&#39;m in the minority here but I firmly believe that in any establishment ($$$+ especially) the patrons shouldn&#39;t have to flag down a waiter/waitress to get service; that being said my Moscow Mule was never replenished and my $30 severely under cooked steak went uneaten.  By the time the waitress came back my date had finished his 16 oz ribeye (which was luke warm by the time I insisted he eat without me) and I had lost my appetite.  My steak was comped and we left.  
I recently gave them another shot and this visit started out good too, great service.....then 2 of 3 steaks came out under cooked.  I&#39;m no chef but I&#39;ve watched enough cooking shows to know just by the feel if a steak is cooked properly so it&#39;s really irritating to me that 3/5 steaks at this place were not cooked properly.... my son decided to eat his but again mine was too bloody but luckily our waiter was on the ball this time and I was able to send it back.  It was ok....under seasoned (our waiter seemed to disappear for the last leg of our trip so I had to go to the bar and ask for salt...) and either the quality of meat was garbage or the knives were because my BF and I had to massacre our meat to eat it.  When the bill came it wasn&#39;t ours...paying the bill took almost as long as trying to eat a steak at this place...
It&#39;s an expensive lesson but next time I want steak I&#39;ll stick to Outback for dinner and Ruth&#39;s Chris for date night.",13/01/16,180,2,1,1,-27,0.16069999999999984,0.8109999999999999,0.389,7.8,No,1692

We shared the bacon wrapped dates, which are probably one of the very best things I have ever put in my mouth. 
I chose to order the evening Risotto. (it changes daily. Last night&#39;s was tomato, basil, artichoke, and divine) we also chose to share a Mac &amp; Cheese as we are questing for the world&#39;s best. Theirs was pretty great!

Being a burger connoisseur, my husband had to try Montarra&#39;s, and he was not disappointed. While it did not rank as his all time favorite, it is his second, which is high praise...

montarra-algonquin,Dan S.,81fr37MM4GR62S2yvOt3gA,nzW_PfLfB2Ffqv0oxC8rkA,"We came here for a special occasion (Kelly&#39;s mom&#39;s birthday) last Saturday night based on all the glowing reviews.  I had eaten here before many moons ago but couldn&#39;t remember if I enjoyed it or not.  I DID remember it had Oberweis &amp; Giordano&#39;s, two huge faves of mine, next door though! 

We had reservations at 6 but arrived 15 minutes early.  They said our table was ready.   As it was near the front, we asked to move tables &amp; were seated elsewhere with no issue. Good service start in my opinion &amp; service throughout the night was excellent.  Water glasses were never empty (&amp; I think I drank the Fox River dry), waitress (Kristina?) was very good &amp; knowledgable on all menu items &amp; was honest with us on food that was great &amp; not so great.  

We started with the filet mignon crisps &amp; pork belly sliders.  As a bacon/pork belly afficianado (who isn&#39;t?!), I was excited to try these.  The 4 crips were small, as expected, but were very tasty.  The sliders....well, I don&#39;t know what to say.  I had 1.5 of the 3.  The overall taste was very good.  The only issue was the first bite I took of mine, I felt something big &amp; hard in it.  It not only threw me mentally for the night but also orally.  It&#39;s hard to describe but felt like the texture mix of finger &amp; water chestnut.  I spat it out &amp; was a big hunk of really hard, unusual crust fat.  I had a bite of Kelly&#39;s &amp; had the same experience.  Pork belly should never have a big crunch...ever.  It shook me for the whole night.  

As far as entrees, Kelly&#39;s mom ordered the salmon, Kelly ordered some scallops on the shell &amp; I ordered the 10 oz Montarra filet stuffed with boursin cheese and mushrooms on the side.  Kelly&#39;s mom enjoyed the salmon. I did not sample it but it looked extremely good.    Kelly said her scallops were tasty but grainy. I had a bite of one &amp; thought it was pretty good but agreed it seemed grainy.  Perhaps not washed or cleaned thorougly enough?   My filet was cooked to perfection  but wasn&#39;t as tender as I&#39;d hoped &amp;  not seasoned AT ALL. The filet also wasn&#39;t &#39;stuffed&#39; as I had envisioned but had a 1&#34; pocket cut in the side with the cheese stuffing,  which was underwhelming as well.  It came with whipped mashed potatoes.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of whipped taters, as various restaurants have varying definitions of whipped.  Regardless, they were too whipped for my liking, almost to a cream consistency &amp; were under the filet, which I hate.  I want my taters to taste like taters, be a bit more mashed/starchy &amp; on the side. 

We ordered dessert.  My lovely dinner dates both had the creme brulee.  Still emotionally &amp; physically struggling with the filet &amp; sliders, I wasn&#39;t about to spend more money on a dessert when an Oberweis shake was next door, cheaper &amp; would be just what the doctor ordered to fix me up.  The brulees came out &amp; they were much larger than I had anticipated, probably a good 6&#34; in diameter.  Kelly&#39;s mom said it was the best creme brulee she&#39;d ever had.  Kelly said hers was very good as well but not the best ever.  I sampled it to see &amp; it was very good.  

All in all, I was torn leaving this place.  I really wanted to like it more, given the service, ambience &amp; food options, plus the ladies relaly liked it.  However, I t couldn&#39;t get past the meat disappointments I had experienced.  I&#39;m not eager to go back, but I wouldn&#39;t totally object if it was for a special outing again.  The ladies really liked it for the most part.   Perhaps I just ordered the wrong things or the chef had a rough night.

Our waitress was great, very friendly .... but it was a bit slow. It was busy, and I&#39;m not sure how many tables our waitress was handling at once, so maybe she was just overloaded?

The filet was tasty...very tasty, but the sauce I recalled previously just did not taste the same. Still, it was delicious.... it just didn&#39;t leave me the desire to lick my plate like in the past.

One member of our party ordered her filet medium well, and it came more medium, medium rare -- when she sent it back, it came back shriveled and darkened. They rectified it immediately and actually brought her out a new filet, which this time they executed perfectly.

We also got 2 comped desserts for the error, and that member of our party also received a gift card for a future visit. So they really did go above &amp; beyond in rectifying the problem and realizing the mistake.

Overall, still a great place to dine. Oh -- do yourself a favor and enjoy your meal with a glass (ah heck, go ahead and order the bottle) of Moscato D&#39;Asti.  You can thank me later.",18/02/13,146,4,2,5,44,4.516300000000001,2.609,0.47,9.921000000000001,No,1211

Overall it was very good experience- I look forward to going back.
Also, there have been a few comments on here about the price. Yes, i suppose its expensive for the area but last time I took the family to subway it was like $35- five dollar foot longs be damned!

montarra-algonquin,Paul D.,#NAME?,GZXPKwdJ4ximR4f7uzyGig,"This is a hidden gem in a strip mall that could easily be missed by passerby. But once you find it, you will not be disappointed! We saw a photo gallery of nearby restaurants at  the local library and saw a photo of petite filet mignon over a Gorgonzola crisp and port wine reduction which is part of their small plates menu. We could have had several servings of that alone and been happy! The filets were cooked to perfection and everything on the plate complimented them perfectly. It was hard to chose from all the complex yet accessible dishes on their menu. I recommend the mixed grill of filet mignon, rack of lamb, and duck confit leg over Gorgonzola crisp and a blueberry reduction. 

We arrived soon after opening and it was quiet enough to soak in the understated atmosphere. It was a little dark for our liking, but the waterfall wall and paintings were interesting. The service however was a little dicey at first . Our waitress was chatting with people she apparently knew the next table over and we sat there quite awhile before we were acknowledged. It took the hostess to come over to her and whisper in her ear that she has customers waiting before she reacted. Despite that minor incident (but one worth mentioning  since the place has a Zagat rating of 28 for their service as well as their food), the waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and the staff overall was friendly and attentive.

montarra-algonquin,Heidi O.,0jqmM5qEWID3td9-QgPGDw,hPmmg0nEhaQd3efxZr5s9g,"After reading all the great reviews, we were very disappointed. I don&#39;t understand the positive reviews. 

First off, they got our reservation wrong. We reserved for a party of 6 (birthday dinner for mom) but they had the reservation for 3. Big difference. Fortunately they could accommodate us but hey put us in the dining are where the bar is located. All the surfaces are hard so the noise level is verging on intolerable. I had to talk very loud to the person sitting right next to me. Additionally there was a TV in this room with the Cubs game on. Really? At $100 per person, one would expect to be able to enjoy your diner mate&#39;s company. Most of us had two small plates. If we all ordered entrees I imagine the price per person would have been closer to $150.

Second, the cocktails were horrible!!! Cocktails should have liquor in them. I had a gin cocktail and could not taste the gin at all. Gin has a pretty recognizable favor. There was none. The others had the same complaint about their drinks. If you&#39;re going to charge downtown prices for a cocktail, make downtown cocktails!

The pacing of service was off for the entire meal. It took a long time to order drinks, get drinks, place our food order and get items. We had a 6:00 reservation. A restaurant should have their act together that early in the evening. We ordered a bottle of wine to accompany our first course appetizers which came after we had eaten them. No one came back to re-fill our glasses. They charged us an automatic 20% tip on our bill but the service did not warrant this.

The food was hit or miss. I ordered the bacon wrapped dated which were supposed to be stuffed with Gorgonzola. Again Gorgonzola is a powerful flavor their was none. Tacos were bland. The scallops and shrimp appetizers were good. The lamb lollipops were tender and had a good sauce. The foie gras appetizer was very small but delicious. I ordered the risotto of day which was supposed to include andouille sausage. There was no sausage so they had to re-make the dish. By the time I got my meal, everyone else was done eating and the risotto was over cooked. They would have gotten kicked off &#34;Top Chef&#34;. If you can&#39;t make risotto, don&#39;t serve it!  We order another bottle of wine to go with dinner our glasses were never re-filled but we were forced to tip on the service. The dessert were pretty straight forward, flour less chocolate cake, creme brulee and sticky toffee pudding. All were well executed but nothing unusual, new or interesting. 

Over all a poor experience on my mom&#39;s special day. They are unable to service a  full dining room on a Saturday night and the food is just average.",11/10/15,306,2,1,2,-6,1.5655999999999999,3.557,2.9550000000000005,36.487999999999985,No,2690

Impeccable dcor and service await you along with a great fine dining experience.

The martinis are excellent and Ben the bartender is very accommodating.

Now for the good stuff.  The stuffed mushrooms come stuffed with a cream sauce and crab lumps.  Amazing!

The French onion soup is served in an onion and was seasoned perfectly with a hint of salt and sweetness unlike any other French onion soup my wife or myself have ever had.

The ribeye was cut to the perfect thickness with just the right amount of fat for flavor.  Incredibly hard to pull off.  Probably the best ribeye I have ever had.

My wife had the gnocchi and I had a bite and the sauce was amazing.

The crme brulee was crisp on top and creamy underneath and served with a raspberry sauce that would leave few people complaining.

In all, I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.  If you are in the northwest suburbs for dinner it is a must try.",01/01/14,103,5,2,5,24,4.9887999999999995,3.604,0.53,9.866,No,958

We were actually across the street and couldn&#39;t find anything we liked so I did a Yelp search on my phone and found this hidden treasure.

  Started off with the calamari special. I have to say it was outstanding. A good portion size and a ton of flavor. We also had to try the French onion soup, which a friend recommended to us. It did not disappoint. A little hard to eat as it was served in an onion, but again, bursting with flavor.
  The entrees took a slight turn the other way. My wife had the mahi mahi special and it was amazing. A lot of flavor, perfectly cooked. I had the mixed grille and I have to say I was very disappointed, especially since the last time I had a Boursin stuffed filet here, i was blown away. The mixed grille consists of duck conceit, lamb, and a filet. The duck was the only protein on my plate that was worth mentioning. Very tender, well cooked and well seasoned. The lamb was perfectly cooked but NO seasoning!! Not the slightest hint of salt, very bland. The filet was overcooked and UNSEASONED. I ordered the meat medium rare and it came out a strong medium, pushing medium well. The lack of seasoning was again very disappointing, especially since that is cooking 101, season your meat!!! The sauces and potatoes were very good, but in no way made up for the other faults on my plate. $40 disappointment.

montarra-algonquin,Geoff G.,ANNyVSh3hHbD2XVISlRXPA,o3sy6V-c5WJBEMD_abqwdw,"After all the very positive reviews online and wanting to try a new non chain restaurant for a special evening out decided to try.

Environment/decor:
Agree with other reviews that state ambiance is very nice especially when considering your in a strip mall. Glass chandler and waterfall partition very nice (pump on water full could be heard over conversation). Tables are very close together and restaurant in on the loud side.

Food::
We had a sampling of offerings - all were good-  non were out of this world. 

Small Plates:
Daily risotto was the star (Corn and Bousin cheese). Chef has an infinity for Bousin cheese as it in is the majority of menu offerings. We also tried the talapia tacos - good. Nice slaw on top, accompanying salsa very spicy.Bacon wrapped scallops with praline sauce were good, scallops were just slightly under cooked and bacon over cooked - dish was good/standard.

Big Plates:
Mixed grill, sampling of filet, lamb chops, and duck confit. The brussle sprouts with bacon were very good, polenta was standard. Lamb and filet cook perfectly. Duck confit was good. Accompanying sauces were good. Beef tips came and were good but arrived as almost a stew over mashed potatoes, not what expected - yet good. Mac n Cheese side was highlight - very creamy and as menu stated - meant to share.
Dessert:
Pecan Pie was very good, crust slightly on the think side. Affogato, specialty and very popular dessert according to server, was ill conceived -  yet very good. Fresh fried &#34;donuts&#34; that you dip into an a bowl that arrives with vanilla ice cream and the server pour hot espresso over. leaves you with a bowl of melted cold espresso after eating/dipping three donuts.

Service:
Excellent service. Server and team were very attentive.

Price:
As the food is good but not out of this world I would say prices are on the high side of reasoble. Saved by being a non chain suburban resturant and excellent service.",25/05/13,241,3,3,5,65,9.8505,5.555000000000001,0.133,18.311999999999998,No,1942

We were first greeted by a giant wooden bear and LOTS of grill smoke, so I didn&#39;t have high hopes going in. 

Out waitress was nice in that she accommodated my +1&#39;s various questions, many of which one could only answer based on personal preference (and we all know all of our taste buds are different). For questions she couldn&#39;t answer, she did offer to double check.  She DID say that the pickle spears were her favorite things, period.  

We did go with our waitress&#39; suggestion on the apps. I had the shrimp tacos (3 of &#39;em, technically listed as an appetizer as well).  My +1 was torn between a burger or the &#34;Extreme&#34; chicken wings, and he got the latter (8 of &#39;em) - half in Buffalo sauce and the other half in Teriyaki.

She didn&#39;t steer us wrong: the pickle spears were FANTASTIC!  They were breaded with a breading that had dill in it, and came with a dipping sauce.

The shrimp tacos were good but REALLY heavy on the lettuce/cilantro.  No matter, though - I like my roughage and they were satisfying without making me too full afterwards.  The shrimp were not overcooked or rubbery (as often happens), and the chipotle ranch sauce was kind of tasty.  Sadly it lacked a little bit of heat that I thought it might have.  

My +1 really enjoyed his wings, though the &#34;extreme&#34; and &#34;jumbo&#34; claims were kind of ridiculous to me, as they really were standard sized wings.  (I&#39;ve had JUMBO wings at Gator&#39;s in Palatine.)

Did I mention that all of our food came out piping hot?!  As in, curls of smoke eminating from the food and it being so hot that you have to wait a second to eat it?  Awesome.  I like that there were a few vegetarian items on the menu, too, including a veggie burger.

When we arrived at the restaurant we were literally the only people in the restaurant.  Apparently there was about 22 people eating outside.  The service was incredibly slow.  Pitchers of water were put in between people on our table but never refilled.  Plastic cups were only given to us when we continued to request them.  

We all ordered food at the same time, however it took 30 minutes for the first of the food plates to arrive and it only got worse.  One to two meals were given at a time.  The first 4 people in our group had finished their meal, in fact ordered a second meal, and 8 people has not even been served.  The waitress never once apologized or came to ask if we needed anything to drink.  She also would never clear plates when bringing a new one out, so dirty plates and glasses continued to pile up on tables.  The last meal was served an hour and a half after ordering.  

When we asked to speak to management, we were told there was no manager.  &#34;They left earlier.&#34;  I asked to speak to a supervisor and finally another waitress took responsibility to come and apologize.  She did her best to help, but overall the servers were incompetent and rude.  7 out of 15 meals were incorrect and made wrong.  

This ended up being a great place to meet with friends because of how quiet it was (since no one was there) and how long it took the food to come, so we had time to catch up.

During the summer their beer garden is great. However, lately, I&#39;ve noticed a slip on their customer service. For example, there is a younger gentleman behind the bar that is continuously rude to patrons. Also, I have timed the amount of time it has taken before someone from the bar asks you if they can get you anything. Once it was a 10 minute wait. There were two other people in the whole place at the time.
Now, it&#39;s not like we are spending a mere $20-30 bucks. We spend quite a bit whenever we come here. Other than that, we still come perhaps because of what the place once was.

Firstly this was my first time back to the &#34;new&#34; prairie rock which is not to be confused to the original &#34;prairie rock brewery&#34; back in its hay day.  

That being said, this smaller yet still nostalgic part of the former brewery still retains the original charm, albeit in a smaller venue.   With that said, the food was good...really good.  I would have to contribute a large part of that to the attentive wait staff who stayed on top of the kitchen to make sure everything was right. 

If you go to this establishment do yourself a favor and ask for Melinda.  You are going to not only be well attended but well entertained as well!  Melinda is one of those personalities / people, who make the &#34;newer&#34; Prairie Rock feel like you&#39;ve come home to your favorite local neighborhood bar.  

Witty, Intelligent, and yes, extremely comical Melinda and Prairie Rock for lunch is a a solid win.  We would have to say they deserve a 4 star rating.  The 1/2 lb Angus burgers are fantastic - great beef.  The garlic and cilantro fries are good enough to be a main entree, they taste that good.   

As for brews, they have a nice selection of IPAs, Specials and Domestics.  I had a delicious Vanilla Port (actually 3 of them) that were fantastic.   Parking in the area is plentiful, stop on by, say hello to Melinda and order a Port and Burger for lunch, the rest of your day will be a walk in the park!",18/01/13,176,4,3,5,67,6.480100000000001,3.463,0.389,11.148000000000001,No,1499

Ricky, the bar tender, was extremely attentive and just all around a wonderful server.  He made sure we always had drinks and that we were well tended to.  

The new Prairie Rock is not only better than the old one, it&#39;s one of the best restaurants in town.  This is saying a lot considering how Outback, Chilis, Lone Star, and Applebees have all gone down hill.  

The food was one of the best meals my fellow diner and I had had in years.  We sampled the artichoke dip with chips, and it was the best ever.  I had the penne pasta with shrimp and my fellow diner had a bacon cheeseburger.  Delightful!  And while the vanilla porter is not quite like the vanilla pale ale that &#34;the Rock&#34; used to serve (for obvious reasons), it&#39;s pretty darn close, and certainly a contender.  

Overall we were delighted with the food and the service.  Top notch.  If that&#39;s the kind of quality they&#39;re serving up late on a Tuesday night, well just imagine how good it could be on karaoke night or on a Friday or Saturday.

prairie-rock-grill-elgin,Valerie A.,ZFREDvUNF3Fej3zXtWzQMA,OItAFBOFujV31owZRGj3TA,First off this review is late sorry! I am reviewing for sat oct 26th. First I have to say we were walking past after zombie fest and I heard the sound of a live band outside excited as it&#39;s cold and usually nothing going on outside for bars I wanted to go over! Band was great and now needed a drink where we met the bartender Greg (let me explain I am a bartender who takes this night off every year not to deal with amateurs dressed like bigger idiots as they already are and I know I could never bare giving service with a smile so I do everyone a favor and not work.)Greg was great fast bartender for what he had out there and was great with customers even had me and my boyfriend laughing while he talked to other people. We stuck around spent some more money and chatted with him a bit more. This is where it went down hill for me..... What is the name of this bar I asked shocked as earlier I was inside and had to leave because of the giant joke this place was. Walked in and it was semi busy tables were full nothing crazy I would hope as busy as a typical sat night. It took me 15 mins to get a beer I literally stood there to what seemed to be a regular felt so bad he got out of his stool and let me get right in there to get a drink with his help and him calling a bartender I got a beer. Clearly that was not going to happen again. The worst part was the bartenders were barley serving to busy talking to eachother and what seemed to be the owner as he would walk back there from time to time then stand there and watch his bar suck! Pretty sad I just watched dollar signs flying away ps owner not having fast bartenders back there = slower service = customers not drinking = them leaving like myself = less sales!!! This place would of got negative stars if it was not for Greg!!

As my brother said, our beers were lukewarm.. the waitstaff/bar staff should have known that the second the beer hit the glass.  My wife had the buffalo chicken sandwich witch was a sad dry excuse for a piece of chicken.  The beer list was impressive so that might be the saving grace.

prairie-rock-grill-elgin,Tommy D.,KED20hlLPAUo_pj7SdEibQ,SSxjdLg3pVXSMFGtQaQbuw,"This place is new (kinda). It was an Elgin staple for many years until it was closed about 2 years ago. (not sure why). Well it&#39;s been started up again (minus the brewery-part...which is a shame, cuz the beer was pretty darn good.) Anyway.. we popped in there on a Saturday night around 6pm. The bar area is pretty awesome. very old, rustic and orginal decor held over from the building&#39;s previous life as a theater and then a biker-gang hideout*.  High ceilings, lots of exposed brick and timber with a large old school bar. The clientele were a mixed bag of younger 20&#39;s, some families (I was there with my parents, niece, son, bro and sis-in-law) and we were&#39;t out of place. 
So the menu..
It&#39;s tiny. Like a chicken sandwich and a Caesar salad-small. There aint shit on the menu. So we decided to focus on the beer. the beer selection was plentiful. Lots of craft brews on tap. It took a while to make our selections. But when mine and my bro&#39;s drafts arrived.. they were lukewarm. Like as if.. the keg wasn&#39;t cold. Whatever.. fine. We all kinda picked a mixed bag of items from the menu, for snacking more or less.. and the food wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. Typical, un-inspired bar food. No vegetarian options (aside from a salad). And they charged me $7 for a basket of steak fries. Really!?! (I sound cheap again, i know.. but $3 or $4 ok.. but shit man, $7?!?!). 
I did notice a little post-it on the menu stating that they recently had a soft-opening and that a full menu will be available after April 10th. So since it&#39;s near my family and the beer selection is good, I&#39;m gonna give this joint another try. Lord knows Elgin could use another great bar/restaurant spot.. here&#39;s hoping they do well!

I had the pasta with steak and bleu cheese sauce and it looked like slop in my bowl it was piled so high. It was enough food to feed four people. It tasted downright strange, had a sour flavor that did not really resemble bleu cheese, the steak pieces were chewy, and it was lukewarm when I got in and cold within a couple minutes. My boyfriend had the steak which he asked for medium. It was medium rare, more on the rare side. The vegetables served with it were frozen mixed vegetables when I thought all restaurants served fresh. To add to this, when a band started to warm up a guy came to our table and told us we had to pay a 5 dollar cover. We were basically finished eating and said that no were weren&#39;t staying for the band. This guy needs to learn some manners.

Walked in around 830pm. Says open till 10 or 11. Asked to make sure kitchen was open, &amp; hostess/bartender wasnt sure. Went to ask someone, who was not really happy that there was two people wanting to eat, but said they would serve us (Better to have convo quietly so guests cant hear). Sat down, waitress/bartender was nice. 

Ordered food, poppers for app, Chicken fajitas for him &amp; pulled pork for me (on recommendation from the waitress). I also got cup of soup (cheddar broccoli), which was burnt and curdled. The fajitas had no seasoning at all, minus some salt &amp; pepper sprinkled on them. Mostly it was green peppers and onions, only 5 strips of chicken (grilled). However, the lettuce &amp; tomato were fresh so that was good. The pulled pork was good, but not good enough for me to go back just for it. The poppers were great though.

They had a great selection of side dishes to accompany your burger/sandwich of choice, including fried zucchini.  The beer list is decent, as other yelpers have mentioned.

The food was average but served luke warm at best. It&#39;s very loud/Noisy , since they have turned it into one big room with tables, which also makes it less private. Sad to say , I probably won&#39;t be back, my Suspicions tell me this is an Owner/operator that thought he could be more successful by changing the whole Concept, instead of improving what was already there.

You&#39;re not going to find a ton of beer you haven&#39;t tried before (if you&#39;re a beer snob like me) but there are good choices and a couple you may not have seen nonetheless. 

We came here Sunday right before the (opening) Bears Packers game. Totally thought they&#39;d be packed and we&#39;d have to wait but no one was here! I mean, awesome for me, but not so much for management. It kind of scared me that I picked a dive with crappy food but apparently The Range is just slightly off the grid enough to be a secret because they have absolutely awesome food. Seriously...the burger here was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. I got the Honky Tonk (add blue cheese!) and it was fantastic. A delicious seasoned patty, cooked medium (which you ask for but rarely get at most places), ooey gooey with sauce and cheese and runny egg, and topped with nice thick crispy bacon. Mmmmmm.  I&#39;m having a mouthgasm just thinking about it. My man got the brisket and thought it was great too. We even got a free kids meal with our adult meal purchase (maybe a Sunday deal?) and she mangia&#39;ed on those chicken nuggets like they were going out of style. Point is, we will be back for the food alone. 

For those who care about service and ambiance: Service from the waitress was alright. If it were busy it may have been a different story, but it was dead in there so it was good enough. The owner stopped by a couple times too to run food, ask about refills, and make sure everything was cool. He was genuinely really nice and cared that you were having a good time. Nice touch. The ambiance was very hunting cabin with a summery party twist. You know, wood, antlers, drinking signs, kitschy stuff. I don&#39;t care either way as long as the food is good but if you need something fancy, this place isn&#39;t for you. 

Overall, The Range is awesome.  Go here. But don&#39;t tell TOO many friends because I still don&#39;t want to wait for a table.",20/09/15,238,5,3,5,51,7.891500000000001,5.261,0.9729999999999998,20.763999999999996,No,2019

I had the strawberry beer to start- something I&#39;d never tried before- and I really enjoyed the drink.

We were there on the night of a Chicago Blackhawks playoff game- and the bar was very crowded while the rest of the restaurant was not. I feel like this would be a great place to sit on the porch outside, but we wanted to watch the end of the game so opted to sit inside. Our server was very pleasant, and our food was a-ok. I enjoyed my entree and tempura zucchini side but was less crazy about the corn based side- I probably wouldn&#39;t get that again. My husband had a burger which he couldn&#39;t finish- one of the specialties of the house- and he loved his dish.

On Sunday afternoon, we visited nearby St. Charles for the annual Scarecrow Festival. It was my birthday and so I got to be the decision maker. After the fest, we headed over to Batavia to try what sounded like some yummy food at the Open Range American Grill. 

The parking lot has an odd shape and minimal spots, but there were spots on the street and what appeared to be more parking across the way. We parked on the street and wandered in. There were no customers. Uh oh. Now what?  Do the five of us turn and leave?  The reviews were good so we stuck it out. 

I&#39;m glad we did.

We sat at a large table in the bar area. We had a perfect view of a large screen tv and plenty of elbow room. That was a plus. People slowly filled in the space. The Bears weren&#39;t playing and it was mid-afternoon on a Sunday so I think we may have just been there at an off time. 

The menu had a nice variety of items. I wanted the crab cakes. I know, what&#39;s wrong with me?  Ordering crab cakes at what appears to be a bar that serves food rather than a restaurant which serves drinks. I asked the server. Her menu knowledge was somewhat limited and she described the crab cakes as: um, mushy and not really what you&#39;d expect. Okay - no crab cakes for me. 

I ended up with a plain chicken sandwich and some onion strings. It was good. Nothing fancy or memorable, but it served its purpose. My son ordered a California club and roasted veggies. He was a fan of the whole dish. The hubby and my sister went with beef brisket. This dish came with the option of two sides. He chose chili and baked beans (said he&#39;d come back for the beans) and she chose chili and fries (the waffle cut fries did not impress but the chili was a hit).  My brother in law chose a steak sandwich with baked beans. It arrived with sweet potato fries in error. Getting the correct beans took some effort, but we worked it out eventually. 

The server encouraged the tempura zucchini. We tried it as an appetizer with a chipotle ranch dipping sauce. It was tasty but I&#39;m glad that no one chose that as their side. It was too greasy. 

Overall, the beer selection was wide, the menu options plentiful and the service was okay. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily make this a destination restaurant but I would probably visit again if I was in the area.",17/10/13,273,4,1,4,10,3.3103000000000002,4.316,2.2630000000000003,34.423,No,2348

First, for an appetizer, we ordered the Brisket Poppers, and they did not have any brisket in them. They were pretty good otherwise, but we could not seem to find the meat!

We brought our 4 kids with us tonight, as kids were to eat free off the kids menu, but it is only one kids meal per one adult meal, which is ok, but not stated anywhere until the final bill came.  Also, the menu has a large burger selection, but there is no kids burger, so we had to pay 10.99 to get a cheeseburger for one of our kids, not the end of the world, but to note.

In regards to food, the brisket and pulled pork are marginal at best. My wife had the pork, and I had the brisket. The brisket was dry and flavorless, and pork was decent, with a smokey flavor. Those who know BBQ know that the sides can also make the meal. There were not any original sides to note, and when I asked about the &#34;Corn and Queso&#34;, the waitress said she has never tried it, but heard it was good. When it came, it was canned corn with a slice of american cheese melted on top via microwave. Not so good, couldn&#39;t even get through it.

I hear that the burgers are good, but my 8 year old said &#34;Portillos is better&#34;... Take that for what it is worth.

I&#39;ve enjoyed the brisket and brisket sandwich, and the Friday fish fry, but the baby back ribs are my current favorite. (I&#39;ve yet to try the pizza). 
The ribs come in a one-pound portion, with the option for two pounds. I know baby backs are often served as half- or full-racks. My estimation is that the one pound is more than a half rack.  I think I counted 8 bones. Meaty, juicy and flavorful, I was able to clean the meat from the ribs with just my fork.

The parking lot is just stupid. Do yourself a favor and park on the street and walk. 

As we neared the front of the restaurant we could smell the food and being that we were ALL starving, we made our way in quickly....to an empty restaurant. I thought maybe they were closed. Seriously...where are all the people? The scarecrow fest, maybe? Did we come at a weird time? Maybe. We can&#39;t just leave, so we took a seat but not before using the ladies room. Which I have to say is just weird...its like they took several rooms and put them together, the door frame isn&#39;t finished and there are openings near the floorboards, the soap dispenser is broken and the light is flickering like we were in a fun house...I was so weirded out for a minute! My sister and I just laughed it off and joined the boys at a large table in the bar area where they could see whatever game was on that day.

The server was honest in her opinions, which I normally appreciate but she wasn&#39;t really selling us on anything in the menu, so I was kinda turned off. My sister asked how the crab cakes were and she said &#39;kinda mushy&#39; and &#39;not what you would expect&#39;. Needless to say, she chose something else on the menu. The server did recommend the tempura zucchini which is technically a &#39;side&#39; option but she said it also worked as an appetizer if we wanted to try it, so we did. For $3, it was great! Only issue was that it was greasy..it needed more time to, I don&#39;t know, drain? 

My self and my brother-in-law copied each other and both ordered the beef brisket. It was VERY fatty, but it was VERY good. It basically fell apart so it was easy to get the meat and cut off the fat. I ordered the waffle fries and their chili. The chili was my favorite thing of the whole meal. I would go back for the chili alone. The waffle fries left something to be desired. My husband&#39;s meal came with the wrong side so after waiting a while and him getting further and further into in steak sandwich without being able to enjoy his side along with it, we had to get up to find the missing server to have her correct the issue.

the-range-grill-and-tap-batavia-3,Tom S.,c6UENlDjDlfSMVVKN6nA5g,u2usKyh4GZeSllV3EPuByg,I had been here several times over the past couple years and it was a solid 3.5 stars all around. The owner was always running around making sure everyone was having an enjoyable experience. I met several friends here Friday night for drinks and appetizers and it was horrendous. Two of us arrived and sat down at the table with one of our friends already sitting and drinking a beer. We sat and talked waiting for a waitress for 10 minutes to no avail.  Being thirsty at 7:30 on a Friday night I went to the bar to grab us a couple beers.  The first two drafts I order in told thy are out of with no replacement tapped.  Kind of odd. I ask what they have in bottles and the bartender ( who was a very nice woman) had no idea and said she doesn&#39;t know anything about beer. I finally look in the cooler myself and grab a couple beers.  I go back to the table to find the waitress now a good 20 minutes into our arrival still hasn&#39;t stopped by!  Fast forward 4 more friends arrive and sit and yep you guessed it had to go to the bar to grab beers after waiting 10 minutes.  Finally waitress comes over and we place food and at this point second drink orders.  It took her 20 minutes to bring back beers and she&#39;s brought back some attitude as well.  I was wondering where the hands on owner was and found out from another disgruntled patron that he was basically fired and bought out. Shame whoever is running it now has absolutely no clue what they are doing. I have to say quite possibly the worst service I&#39;ve ever had ever!,01/08/16,162,1,1,1,4,0.02650000000000019,1.326,1.8610000000000002,13.813,No,1541

Getting on to the beer then ~
The beer menu is above average, mixing a nice variety of microbrews with your every day redneck delights (MGD, Coors, Bud products).  Open Range was smart to add  these duds to the menu though, so they could please every type of beer drinker that walked through the door (even those without tastebuds).  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about every craft on their list, whether or not they had it in stock, what each beer was composed of and an honest opinion about each.  Given that their menu is around 75 beers deep, that&#39;s impressive.  The menu also shows the Style, ABV and BAS score for each beer.  That&#39;s a classy touch.  And lastly, the best part..their prices are decent, especially compared to many local spots vending microbrews.  Head over to Geneva and you&#39;ll definitely pay $1.50-$4 more per bottle.

My neighbors tip on the food was to try the prime rub, which he said was a mere $15 and phenomenal.  I also took a gander at the food menu and look forward to making a second trip with the fam.

Nice job Open Range.  This is a ten fold improvement over the dive that used to hold up the same roof.

the-range-grill-and-tap-batavia-3,Renita M.,8gYDk0qh586uzePzzU763g,rfBYmo55EULHFqqmIxHjng,"It&#39;s Saturday evening, and me and 6 friends are cooing over a baby. 7 p.m. rolls around and we realize we&#39;re pretty hungry and do not expect the new parents to feed us. But they do want to come to dinner with us, and suggested Open Range as nearby and suitably tasty.

This place is not super-obvious in downtown Batavia; the sign is kinda small and the street not terribly well-lit, plus there&#39;s roadwork right now. They have a small lot but there&#39;s a bigger one across the street. 

I didn&#39;t get a great grasp of the restaurant layout, but there were at least two rooms, one more &#34;dining&#34; and one with a bar. We were seated in the dining area at a longish table. 

The menu is slightly classed-up bar food -- burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, salads. They also have a pretty good craft beer list. I would say though that the layout of both is slightly confusing. The menu has one sandwich section with some burgers, and then another page with only burgers, with longer descriptions and pictures. The beer menu has one column with style/ABV/price and a second, mis-matched from the first, with the Beer Advocate rating. Weird.

That said, overall, both menus looked good once you could figure out how to read them.

Our orders were taken pretty promptly. I went for a Tumbleweed burger (bacon, queso, fried onion straws and a fried egg plus some kinda sauce), tempura zucchini as a side and an Ace Honey Cider to drink. I like that you have a variety of sides to choose from, and they&#39;re all the same price -- onion rings, zucchini, fries, salad, mashed potatoes and a few others. 

My burger was very good, and pretty messy. I ordered it medium but I think it was more like medium well. The egg yolk dripped all over as did the queso but it was a delicious mess. 

A few notes that keep it from being five stars for me:

-- No glasses were offered for bottled beer. Every beer snob knows you need a glass to really experience the full flavor of your beverage.

-- Water refills were sporadic.

-- Waitress did a great job with separate checks, but then there was some sort of weird thing with mine, she claimed she had run the wrong bill on my card, but I immediately looked at my credit card app, and there was the original charge, a refund for it, and then the same exact charge (which was correct, based on my math) ... it was strange. 

The atmosphere was sort of odd, too, they clearly are going for a little bit nicer food menu but it reads like a bar through and through. 

Still, I would definitely come back for the creative food menu and good beer list.",28/10/13,311,4,3,5,59,5.4689,3.6420000000000003,2.0140000000000002,20.345,No,2592

Others seemed to have similar complaints about the temperature of their burgers, as well as that their burgers were dry.  My husband&#39;s burger was missing the bacon advertised.  The tenderloin sandwich appeared to be made with skirt steak instead of the tenderloin as advertised.

Even the sauce it comes with couldn&#39;t save it. 

We also tried the pretzel nuggets appetizer. The nuggets were pretty good, although a few were dry and doughy. The disappointment here was with the beer cheese sauce it came with, which was just nasty. It was almost rancid tasting. I&#39;m not sure who would enjoy such a sauce. I love beer, and I love cheese, but that combo was not good at all. Thankfully our server was able to bring us a queso cheese instead, which, although it was runny, was a vast improvement.

Others at the table had ribs, which I sampled and enjoyed. The sauce had a nice smokey sweetness. The pizza was also good, not great.

It&#39;s located in downtown Batavia, so you can enjoy a nice stroll before or after your meal. You might need a stroll or two or ten after eating some of their delicious, hearty food.

I&#39;ll admit...the service when we went was a bit slow. But we were in a group of about 12, so its to be somewhat expected. There was a half-off pizza deal going on, but apparently they ran out of pizza dough, so we couldn&#39;t order that anymore. It happens, right? Well they felt bad for the people wanting to order pizza and still took part of the check off anyway. That was super of them! 

The brisket I ordered was fab. You got a good amount of it and it was charred just enough. I ordered it with grilled veggies and roasted corn/queso. The grilled veggies were a little cold, but seasoned well enough to make it forgivable. Corn and queso, DEFINITELY good.

Let&#39;s take a step back for a second and talk about this menu. If you go to their website, you can look up what you are ordering and see a REAL picture of what you want. It&#39;s all mouthwatering and doesn&#39;t look like fake staged fast food pictures. The nachos picture has those imperfections that nachos tend to have...cheese falling off the plate, olives not evenly distributed, an interesting shape of sour cream...this is real life nachos, and they look heavenly. But then continue to scroll down, and you can see the best-looking burgers and sandwiches this side of the Rio Grande. 
The Honky Tonk Burger, with an egg, queso, and onion straws. 
The Kansas City Burger, with pulled pork, onion straws, coleslaw, and cheese. 
The Beef Brisket and Famous Pulled Pork Sandwiches, all piled high with their slow-cooked meats.
COME.ON. HOW AM I NOT SUPPOSED TO WANT EVERYTHING?
It doesn&#39;t even end there. Take a look at their enormous, cheesy Range Burrito. It comes in a skillet because it can&#39;t contain all the flavors literally falling out of it. Or the Smoked Brisket Tacos...this has gotta be the best picture on the website. 
Top it all off? Bacon Maple Donut Holes. I&#39;m done. Peace out. I can&#39;t handle this menu anymore. I&#39;m fatter just by reading it. It all sounds delicious.

Do you want to go there yet? No? Are you dead? Is your heart even beating? Because this place looks and sounds delicious, all things considered...and you should consider your life choices if you aren&#39;t making immediate plans to go there and try something with queso sauce on it (because more than half the menu comes with queso).",10/12/14,330,5,2,5,15,7.3164,6.624,2.711,32.665000000000006,No,2732

The residents of Batavia want so badly to support local buisiness. &#34;Give us good food at a fair price&#34;. This place is on targer to do just that!  

Sooo many local restaurants over the years have failed to figure this out, particularly in the building currently occupied by open range....hopefully the pattern is broken.

As I said, good food with an interesting menu offering &#34;just enough&#34; options to choose from. All said, just the opposite, as the beer menu offers extensive options to meet your needs....PBR&#39;s to Micro Brews. Well done!

I saved the best for last! The bar area also has several tables to dine as well. This area supports a glass partition between the bar and dining area. This is great. You have an open view of the entire restaurant and a sound barrier from youngster roguish rascals &#34;doin&#39; their thing&#34;.

You think you are getting a normal priced pizza because the fine print at the top of the page and not by the acc pizza I ordered had an up garage. They messed up the order for my pizza and the server said &#34;since Monday is normally buy one get one free pizza night you can give it to you today even tho it&#39;s Sunday&#34;. He tried to make me feel like that I was lucky to get the pizza I acc ordered. 

I ordered w beer on tap. I thought it looked flat no head or anything. I tasted it and it was flat. I told the bartender and he said ohh it must be empty then I had to ask for a diff beer. 

I found a misprint on the beer list/menu. I thought the beer I ordered was $4.50 that&#39;s what it said on the beer list then I saw on the menu it said $5.50. I asked the bartender what the price was. He said let me check went to the manager or owner then he came back and said its been debunked. And the beer list price is the old price when it was in cans and the menu price is now that it&#39;s on tap. They didn&#39;t give it to me for the price I thought I was paying somehow they charged me $5.15 a beer?! So confusing, I just paid it.

I went with my husband and son on a Friday evening.  We were seated right away.  From there it took 10 minutes to get a server and another 20 for our beers.  I was worried but from that point on the service was excellent. In all fairness, there was a very large party that appeared to have been seated not long before us. 

We went in on a Friday specifically for the fish fry. My husband ordered the fried fish which came with waffle fries, green beans and his choice of soup or salad.  He had the chicken tortilla soup which I tried.  It was a creamy base and was quite good.  My son ordered the kids cheese pizza.  He ate nearly all of it and enjoyed it.  I ordered the crab cakes.  The three nice sized crab cakes came with really yummy garlic Parmesan mashed potatoes and incredible tempura zucchini.   The cab cakes were so big I ended up bringing home some of my dinner.  

The owner comped us dessert that visit. We had the beignets with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.  I am not big on dessert unless its out of the ordinary.  This was amazing.  Get the beignets if you come here. 

The beer selection is crazy big.  They had a favorite IPA of mine that&#39;s not easy to find so I was happy.

If you can get past the outside looking like a shanty, the wood paneling on the walls, and the decade old carpet...this place is a great hidden gem. 
Last night I ventured there for a quick meal and a microbrew. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by how courteous the staff was, the waitress more attentive to our needs than many high scale restraints I frequent. 
The beer selection is astounding to say the least. There also is a wine selection,but I highly recommend a micro brew, even for the palate of the most sophisticated wine snob.
Pretzels and cheese was mediocre, I actually would not order again. The pretzels were hard and the cheese dip thin and over spicy.
I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was mouth watering. The right combination of pork and BBQ sauce on a crusty roll. I would have liked more slaw on the sandwich along with a few more crunchy onion straws, but this is definitely worth ordering again.
The burgers were very appealing and large!

We rode our bikes to Open Range thinking that we would get a burger and a beer.  What I didn&#39;t expect was a huge microbrew selection (like the Ale House in Geneva) at incredibly reasonable prices.  I had a Dogfish Head 60 min IPA for $4.50.  My wife had a Matilda for $5.50.  If you&#39;re a beer drinker, you know that those prices are near some places&#39; bud light drafts.  It was awesome to have such an extensive beer selection at affordable prices!  

The food was very good.  I had a pulled pork.  Wife had the brisquet.  Very good.  And, the burger choices, which we do didn&#39;t try looked great.

Finally, the service was very good.  The waitress let my wife try a sampler of the Burbon Ale (which she found out wasn&#39;t for her).  I&#39;ll contrast this with an experience I had at the Ale House in Geneva where we paid for a three glass sampler, and my wife just hated one of the beers.  When we asked, the waitress said that she could not replace the sampler and we&#39;d have to pay 1/3 of the sampler price to get a new one. Since we were very loyal customers at the Ale House and have spent hundreds there, this was off-putting.

the-range-grill-and-tap-batavia-3,Marc O.,4IGDV-Lr0SDMtZ__edBkmw,HtyC2wCSYAgUo4r30LGvsQ,"OK granted, I usually don&#39;t visit many places that I can&#39;t walk to in St. Charles.  Walking, especially in summer is just very nice. However, we made an exception last night and broadened our horizons all the way to Batavia for my birthday.
Once I went to the correct side of the river (for reference, it&#39;s the west side) we parked right in front.  I imagine if they are super busy, you would park across the street in the public lot as there were only 4-5 spaces right in front. 
Upon walking up, I was impressed with the outdoor seating area.  Finally someone with a place near the river has figured out to but up screening to keep the river monsters, I mean gnats, out of your food.  Score 1 for Open Range.  
We were seated by the host who also ended up being our server.  Nice guy, quick with suggestions and to bring an emergency plate of chips and guacamole to our &#34;starving&#34; 12 year old.  
Bonus for Wednesdays:  1/2 price apps, deserts and BOTTLES OF WINE.  Wines are mostly ones we&#39;ve heard of so we went with the Mark West Pinot.  
We ordered the filet sliders for the girls and crab cakes for us for apps.  Both were fantastic.  I was especially happy that one girl was sick and didn&#39;t want to eat so I got some slider too.  Very tender filet style sliders with onion strings.  Yum.
The crab cakes were good too, although I&#39;m spoiled having lived with Maryland crab cakes for years.
The one girl sick precipitated us getting our orders to go.  One kid did a cheese pizza, wifey did the mahi mahi fish tacos with grilled veggies and I went full carnivore on the brisket with the rize and queso side.  
All were very good. My brisket was melt in the mouth with a little bit of smokiness.  Fish tacos were firm but tender (I think that&#39;s possible) and the cheese pizza was flavorful (disclaimer: I ate it for breakfast this morning, but it was still good).
Let me get to the best part:  the beer list.  I can&#39;t remember the name, but I had a Kentucky Bourbon based draft and it was one of my favorite beers ever.  So good.  Bonus for being 8.1% ABV too.  They had a bunch of craft beers on the menu, I think the server said 70+.  Mama&#39;s Little Yellow Pils and Dale&#39;s Pale Ale being two of my go-tos were prominently featured.
Finally, we did desert as it was my birthday.  How about bacon filled donuts with powdered sugar and maple syrup for dipping?  2 please.  Decadent yes.
Overall we enjoyed it.  Decor was kind of northwoods lodge meets a bit more upscale bistro.  Pleasant enough.

We decided to give the place a shot after seeing some positive reviews.  My friend and co-conspirator also thought it would be a nice salad/pizza/wine/dessert night.  The server was attentive, and didn&#39;t mind when we retreated from the dining room to the more adult environment of a bar side hi top after a large group with many youngsters tumbled in.

Side salads were nice - fresh spring greens and generously portioned.  Wine list was adequate for the venue and reasonably priced.

But - the pizza.  

A nice layer of decent cheese, good Italian sausage, a slightly too-sweet-for-me sauce atop a burnt crust that I strongly suspect is a shipped-in item.  Not too burnt to be inedible...but right on the cusp.  (And we were, quite frankly - way too hungry to wait for a do-over.)  I mentioned the crust to the server, and the manager on duty stopped over at our table.  Really nice guy - and he comped our dessert for the pizza fail.

But - the dessert.

A lovely portion of beignets, big enough to share, drizzled with chocolate syrup, (per our request), with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream in the center.  Pretty to look at, and - upon first taste - rich and delicious.  Only...they&#39;re supposed to be cooked all the way through.  The centers were raw dough.  Once again, we finished without requesting a redo.  A little bit of raw dough won&#39;t kill me, (so far). 

Maybe we&#39;ll try them again some other time.

And - then again - maybe not.

Since my original review I feel I may have Jinxed this place. We have ordered (delivery) 6 times since my review and 4 of the times our orders were wrong. Someone needs to start checking the orders before they go out. It has gotten to the point that we don&#39;t want to order from here anymore because who knows if what we order we actually get delivered. It&#39;s a damn shame too. 

What I like the most about this place is the variety. Moretti&#39;s has a lot to offer and that&#39;s a real plus when you want to do delivery and want more then pizza. I&#39;ve been ordering from Moretti&#39;s for years and  here are some of the best dishes I&#39;ve had here that you should try. 

The deep dish cheese pizza. I&#39;m normally not one to order just a plane cheese pizza but they use a blend of cheeses that makes this one of the best cheese pizzas I&#39;ve ever had. Better than Lou Malnattis and Gino&#39;s East. 

Their chicken Parmesan sandwich and Dinner are excellent. The sandwich comes with two chicken breasts and the dinner comes with three. Great value. 

The fried calamari- I ask for it with marinara though. It comes with cocktail sauce. 

Any of their pasta dishes are great

Last would be if you get a sandwich, instead of fries get their chips. Super crunchy and just the right amount of salt. 

Only reason I didn&#39;t go 5 stars is because they aren&#39;t always consistent in the quality of their food.",31/08/16,151,2,1,4,6,3.7156000000000002,2.9579999999999997,1.052,14.99,No,1481

Waitress: Great! 

Food: Kids made their own pizza which was fun and they said it was good.  They also say Little Caesars is good pizza so I wouldn&#39;t take their opinion for much. 
Sunday was spaghetti night and the spaghetti was good and enough for 2 adults to split. I came here to have a Chicago style deep dish and was pretty disappointed with it.  The sauce was bland like they just opened a can of crushed tomatoes and dumped it on top.  There wasn&#39;t much cheese and all I could taste was the sausage which was ok.

I regularly get orders that are wrong.  Order one salad no onion, every salad has no onions.  Wrong dressing.  Missing dressing.  Missing utensils.  Missing bread.  Seriously, what is wrong with their take-out staff?

Would rate higher if not for the bad service.  Eggplant parm. there (sandwich and entree) is the best I&#39;ve had.  Pizzas are very good.  Dine-in service is slow and just about as bad as take-out service.

I&#39;ve ordered from Moretti&#39;s probably a triple-digit number of times, and I think part of the problem leading to their wrong orders is the fact that they have multiple people bag up (at least) take-out orders.  One person puts in soups, another puts in condiments and utensils, etc.  You can see it happening as you wait for the order.  Have one person bag things up, and I suspect this would be far less of a problem.

Edit: On second thought, probably would leave three stars even if the service were better.  Food is about as inconsistent as the correctness of the orders.

The food has proven to be consistently inconsistent in portions and quality, but you can never go wrong with their mac and cheese pizza. It&#39;s seriously so good. If you&#39;re going to visit Moretti&#39;s one time and order one thing, get their mac and cheese pizza (add the stuffed Asiago crust for $4 extra for even more cheesy goodness). But this is a treat that I&#39;ve only permitted myself to twice; of course, it&#39;s a heavy dish, and it&#39;s on the pricier side. Coming close to $30 for a large pizza, regardless of whether it&#39;s a speciality pizza or not, is rather excessive. You&#39;ll definitely have leftovers, though! 

Other than the pizza, I always go for the pasta. The gnocchi is a hit or miss; they&#39;ll make it with any sauce you want, but I&#39;ve found the portions to be different with each order. 

The staff has been super friendly every time we&#39;ve phoned in an order. They&#39;ve always been extremely helpful answering questions and assisting us in placing our order, and when we got to be too lazy to drive over to pick it up, they&#39;ll throw in free delivery. 

One thing I have noticed is that for the two times I&#39;ve chosen to dine in, the service has been slow. One time I came in on a Sunday at around 6:00pm, and it was understandably packed. The wait time wasn&#39;t so much of an issue as the lack of attentiveness by our server; he sort of forgot about us. This happened again when we came in on a Thursday night at around 9:00pm, only it was a completely empty restaurant. Our server was aloof, didn&#39;t refill our sodas, and didn&#39;t make occasional trips to the table to see if we needed anything. We didn&#39;t leave the restaurant until 10:30pm; it took that long to get us our food and hunt down the server for our bill. Again, this was a dead restaurant.

Overall, Moretti&#39;s is okay. It&#39;s rather expensive for the portions you get, and the food is a hit or miss. I recommend picking up your order; there&#39;s plenty of coupons online, and the phone workers are always super friendly.",20/04/16,242,3,1,4,-12,3.0808999999999997,2.6260000000000003,1.1620000000000001,17.211999999999996,No,2190

morettis-ristorante-and-pizzeria-schaumburg,Megan Z.,f_CZxgLT_noyVDbc2Qh7BA,ykMBgRq5LjhaLcbqF_WFhw,"As far as pizza goes, I&#39;ve always been a Chicago style thin crust type of girl. 
My father and I decided to go for a quick pie to check out the Schaumburg location. 
We used to visit the Bartlett location as we lived in Streamwood. 
However, we moved to Arlington Heights and decided the Schaumburg location was worth a shot. 

We went in on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately in a comfy booth in the bar area. The restaurant was not very packed. (Maybe because it was a Sunday?) 

Our server came over and took our drink and appetizer order. The service was good. (more on that later) 

We ordered the Breaded Calamari. It was fresh, hot, and delicious. 
When it comes to Calamari, it&#39;s all about the flavor/consistency of the &#34;breading&#34;. 
The breading was seasoned perfectly, not overpowering. 
If I had to order one thing off the &#34;Starters&#34; menu, the Calamari would be my choice. 

Next, we ordered the pizza. 
We ordered the &#34;House Favorite&#34; (Sausage, Pepperoni, Onion Green Pepper) and added Spinach and EXTRA cheese. 
Now, I&#39;ll be honest we stopped visiting Moretti&#39;s for years, as they would cheap out on the pizza. (Little to no ingredients, Little Cheese). This visit was our way of giving them a chance to redeem themselves. 

The pizza came out piping hot and looking good. 
We each had a slice and came to the same conclusion. 
What if we didn&#39;t order &#34;extra&#34; cheese?! What would &#34;regular&#34; cheese be? 
We both assumed it would be like eating pizza crust covered in sauce. 
To our disappointment, very little sausage or pepperoni on the pizza. Maybe one little ball of sausage per slice. I&#39;m talking pinkie nail size sausage. However, more onions and green pepper than one could palate.  I guess onions and peppers are cheaper to put on the pizza, instead of sausage or pepperoni. 

Fed up with the pizza, I reluctantly ordered a &#34;mini-dessert&#34;. 
I ordered the &#34;mini&#34; tiramisu. It was the worst excuse for tiramisu. 
The ladyfingers are normally dipped in coffee. Not here, dipped in water and served with warm whipped cream. I was fed up and got the bill. I doubt I&#39;ll return, except for calamari. 

The service was good initially, but went downhill real fast. Our server would routinely disappear for ten minutes at a time, leaving our cups empty. Her tip reflected her absence. 

We finished up our pizza and packed the leftovers to go. 
Needless to say, we were very disappointed in the skimping of ingredients. 
We will most likely not be returning for the pizza, when you skimp, people stop coming. 
(most likely the reason for an almost barren dining area) 
Also, other reviews are right. The delivery drivers drive like animals. 
One almost plowed into us while leaving the parking lot. Then, proceeded to cut other cars off. 

Stop cheaping out on the pizza, or you will be out of business real soon. 
Also, have your waitresses do their job, instead of disappearing every five minutes. 
Get your drivers in line before you seriously injure someone else. 

When they can make a REAL pizza, I&#39;ll be back. 
Until then, I&#39;ll order Tortorice&#39;s pizza, they&#39;re not afraid to PILE it on!

Went in last night for 1/2 price pizza Tuesday.  The wait was an hour, which we expected.  What we didn&#39;t expect, was to wait over an hour for a large thin-crust pizza after we ordered it.

We ordered within 10 minutes of being seated (including asking the server to come back a few times because we just weren&#39;t quite sure.)  We ordered:

1 small thin crust pizza with 3 toppings
1 large thin crust pizza with 2.5 toppings
1 large deep dish pizza (the house specialty) - were told it would be 30 minutes, said no problem, just bring the others out when they are ready.
2 appetizer salads.

The salads came right away.  I had a salad that was on special - blanched green beans with tomatoes, red onion, danish bleu cheese, and lemon vinaigrette.  It was actually very good.

Then we waited.  and waited.  and waited.  and waited.

The small pizza came, and we were informed that the kitchen had to re-make the large, because &#34;they forgot the sausage.&#34;  Um... okay?

Then, the deep dish came.

Then, finally, the large thin came.

None of this was the server&#39;s fault... obviously.  She was sweet and kind, and you could see her anxiety over this kitchen fubar.

However, a manager was nowhere to be found.  My dad asked the server to mention to the manager how long the pizza took - hoping, he/she would come over, do something. 

Well, they did something, they took the pizza off the bill.  However, they never did make an appearance to apologize.  

Terrible management at this Moretti&#39;s.  We were there from 6:30 to after 9pm for a couple of pies.  

Ala Carte Entertainment - get your sh*t together and train your managers to manage.  Not hide.  When our server asked the manager to remove the pizza from our check, he/she should have been at our table immediately to apologize, at the very minimum.

And forgetting sausage on a pizza?  Let&#39;s get some training into the kitchen too?",20/08/14,239,2,1,2,-14,1.9362999999999997,2.8449999999999998,0.792,28.362999999999996,No,1950

The parking is great, the hostess was polite, the food was good.  The only thing I was not thrilled with was the service.  Our server seemed to do the bare minimum.  As soon as we ordered pizza with no appetizer, the service went down.  She brought our food and checked back once.  We had to wait a good ten minutes to get her attention to have the food wrapped and the check.  I had a hard time getting her attention.  The place was not packed.  It had at least 6 vacant tables in our section. She never did come back for the cash. Glad I didn&#39;t pay with a credit card, or I&#39;d still be sitting there.  Finally I left it on the table.

A coworker introduced me to Moretti&#39;s  at lunch. I had the chicken Limon and was in love!  Two tender chicken breasts with a wonderful lemon butter sauce with capers over perfectly done angel hair pasta. I had to bring the leftovers back to my hotel which thankfully had a microwave. The left overs were just as wonderful the next night.   
On my next visit I discovered a whole new world of options by ordering off the paper inserted into the menu that listed the daily specials.  I&#39;ve tried so many amazing items over the last couple months on that daily specials list. I&#39;ve had multiple types of fish dinners, gourmet salads, tender steaks and a variety of other options. Tonight was a 10 oz filet mignon with mushrooms and onions, served with shrimp Diablo &amp; garlic mashed potatoes. I requested that they substitute angel hair pasta for the potatoes and serve the shrimp on top. The filet had a smoky rich flavor  and was butter tender. It was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had! The shrimp were large and flavorful and the Diablo sauce had just the right amount of heat and tomatoes. The price? Ridiculous, only $19!   I have no idea how they can offer such amazing food at such reasonable prices. Most daily special meals are in the $13 - $17 price range. One night I had pan seared kingfish tipped with crab and avocado salad with s side of broccolini. I thought I had died and went to foodie heaven.

But I really prefer the lesser known pizzerias and Moretti&#39;s is definitely my favorite.

The deep dish is what I go for, and although it takes about a half-hour, it&#39;s well worth the wait.  With pizzas, you can choose your own ingredients, or you can choose one of the &#34;Favorite Pizzas.&#34; I generally choose the favorites, and I often order the &#34;Moretti&#39;s BBQ.&#34;  The barbecue sauce blends well with the sausage and cheese for a uniquely tasty and mouthwatering experience.  Moretti&#39;s BBQ deep dish (you can also get a Favorite in thin crust) is what I order most of the time, but the Pizza topped with Mac &amp; Cheese is another tasty and decadent option.  I can&#39;t order that pizza too often, lest I gain a lot of weight.

Service is always wonderful, and there are lots of big screen TVs across the restaurant, so if a game is going on, be ready to join in the shouts with the other patrons when our local team scores.

The pizzas are a little pricier than what you might pay somewhere else, but once you take your first bite, you&#39;ll understand why.

The pizza was warm but not hot. After all, there was some nasty weather out there. The pizza was good but not in the upper echelon of pizza in the Chicagoland area.

There is something for everyone on their menu. I love that you can sit outside, they have pretty cheap beer specials, and the service is decent. Oh and their bread is amazing.

However I do have complaint with their pizza delivery drivers;

Warn your duffus pizza delivery drivers about not trying to intimidate customers with their aggressive driving antics.  We have right to walk in our own neighborhood, even after dark.  Their aggressive driving is not good for your business. 

You had two drivers this evening in plum grove creek area 7pm, Friday, 2-13-15;.  
The first courtesly hit the brights, saw me and and slowed down.  The other idiot driver never slowed or even moved to the center of the road, I finally held my arm straight out to force him/her over to the middle.  He/she knows what they did, I wished he would have pulled into a driveway near me, we would have had a discussion right then and there.

I eat at your restaurant at least once every 2 weeks, I&#39;m a customer who doesn&#39;t care for your fools driving aggressively on our community streets, they have no right away superior to a pedestrian.  Do they not know they have a big lighted Moretti sign on the top of their car advertising who they work for, that in itself is an indicator of how dumb they are.  Have you checked their driving history/records before putting them out there (negligence)?

We waited more than 10 minutes for a waiter to appear at our table.  There were a number of empty tables that evening so I can&#39;t imagine they were too busy. 

A stiff string was found in one of the bowls of clam chowder, when we asked what we were looking at the waiter said it was a &#34;stem&#34; and later explained it was the string used to tie the thyme together, either way not really edible and we were not offered another bowl or any apology.

The entries arrived well before we&#39;d completed our soup and to my dismay the Lasagna I ordered had far more salt added for my taste. The other entries ordered were well received and enjoyed.

Our server was wonderful and took great care of us.  My sis-in-law brought in dessert (which I think is great that you can bring your own dessert).  They have great drink specials through out the week, like Thursdays is $6 martinis!  Yes sir!!!

What&#39;s this world coming to? Here&#39;s the dealio people: You must stop at Moretti&#39;s and grab a BBQ pizza - it&#39;s FANTASTIC. I am willing to drive twenty minutes each way to pick it up. It&#39;s so good. 

I can&#39;t say that my review is totally fair. I&#39;ve never even eaten in the restaurant. I used to frequent the bar when I lived closer by. We&#39;d go with a group of friends and hang out in the bar for a few hours, and sing (listen to) karaoke. But, the restaurant part was always busy. So, while here, we always used to order food at the bar and it was always really good. We usually got the pizza.

Service is usually fairly good, obviously it depends on who you get. Restaurant is nice and clean. It&#39;s definitely worth a stop. And considering this is just a local little restaurant, and the # of reviews it has - that should tell you something. LOTS of people like to come here.

It&#39;s always nice to come back and try their food!

We started off with yummy bread (which I had to ask the server for as she walked by). Usually, the server brings it to you with every meal... My fiance got the Parmesan Crusted Salmon ($15.99), I got the Gnocchi A La Vodka ($11.99), and we also got a Parmesan Crusted Salmon to go for my father.

The Parmesan Crusted Salmon was yummy as always! However, the portion has definitely gotten a lot smaller than we remember! 

My Gnocchi A La Vodka was delicious as well! It had arugula, tomatoes, and delicious sauce! However, the portion was much smaller than I expected.

I got a call from my parents later, asking if we gave them our leftover salmon. They said the salmon serving looks like a half serving and that they thought we gave them leftovers. =/ I wish I looked at it before I gave it to them.

The service was pretty bad too. The waitress started off nice but then NEVER came to check on us after she took our order. She walked past us literally 5 times and I had to scream &#34;excuse me!&#34; and ask for something. every. single. time.

morettis-ristorante-and-pizzeria-schaumburg,Candice G.,UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg,fdjYByxlbnhqbLBROQXx9g,"Average. Basic. Commonplace. Decent. 

On average, I order out for pizza twice a year. It&#39;s not very often, so I like for when it to be spectacular when it happens. And as you may have guessed from my succinct opening, Moretti&#39;s just didn&#39;t do it. 

The pizza I ordered was simple, but something that I feel is a good test as far as judging a pie. Any pizza can be delicious with juicy, salty pepperoni, it&#39;s like the miracle all-spice for pizza, but mushroom and black olive- well, that takes talent. 

Our pizza was lacking flavor in crust and our sauce was rather watery, when it was even present. The toppings were pretty sparse and at $5 for 2 extra toppings that were hard to taste amongst all the average. I found myself raiding the spice rack for anything to add for more zest. A bit of oregano and a cornucopia of crushed red pepper would have done wonders for this semi-downer, sub-par pie. 

I would like to note that we picked up for take out and didn&#39;t get the full Moretti&#39;s experience, but the inside dining area did look fun and like a good gathering place/respite from Woodfield Mall.",24/11/12,128,3,2,3,45,2.9656000000000002,1.237,0.20299999999999999,12.559999999999999,No,1125
morettis-ristorante-and-pizzeria-schaumburg,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,ehGx3x7wQOaA5U8x0KmSoA,"This is one of those restaurants I really want to give 4.5 stars to because it&#39;s approximately quite good. Quick service / cooking and good prices (especially the Mt Prospect location) are definite pluses but it is sometimes inconsistent with the cooking.

When the bread comes freshly out of the oven it has a nice chewy inside with a nice crispy skin. This goes great with the bruschetta which is pretty good but is a bit pricey (except for when you get 4 - 6 pm half price appetizers) for what you get. The soup here is okay but better than what you&#39;d get at most comparable restaurants.

I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the specialty pasta here. Seemed a bit heavy flavored for me although Biaggi&#39;s also puts too much sauce or salt in their pastas as well. The simple pastas that come with entrees such as sea bass (flaky) or eggplant (amazing) are done fairly well.

The burgers are surprisingly good here, both the cheese and Jack Daniels burger. I hope you&#39;re hungry because they are generously sized and come with a choice of fries or chips (homemade, take this choice!). The wraps are pretty good as well although the Italian beef isn&#39;t that impressive. You can go to Johnnie&#39;s Beef or Portillos nearby to get your fix.

The $2 desserts are not as small as you&#39;d think they are. I enjoyed the cannoli dip although the carrot cake and tiramisu are a notch above. I especially love how strong the expresso flavor came through in the tiramisu.",14/08/11,166,5,2,5,32,6.5384,3.0320000000000005,0.524,11.443000000000001,No,1472

We all have our favorites, of course, so I felt a little like Benedict Arnold when I eschewed my folks&#39; favorite &#39;za delivery in favor of Moretti&#39;s. But hey, if ordering this delicious pizza is wrong, I sure as hell don&#39;t want to be right.

Let&#39;s get down to brass tacks:

1) Service: 4/5: The nice lady on the phone was a bit confused, directionally, but once she figured out that I was on the East side of Schaumburg, order &amp; delivery were in motion. That being said, I&#39;m not sure they deliver to the West side...perhaps they should put clearer delivery boundaries on the website.

2) Pizza: 4/5: Solid. Nice neutral sauce with just a touch of sweetness and tang, right amount of cheese and a crispy thin crust. It was the perfect vessel for lots of crushed red pepper. I would speculate that the 12&#34; can feed two hungry people, but, hey, I have no idea how much pizza you prefer to consume. Leftovers were just as tasty.

3) Bruschetta: 5/5: Sweet Jesus, this is some delightful bruschetta. Little toasted slices of country bread topped with deliciously garlic-y, basil chopped tomatoes and covered with a hefty slab o&#39; buffalo mozzarella. Get some and try to share, if you can. If I remember correctly, there are 4 pieces to the order. 

4) Value: 4/5: While you can clearly read that I enjoyed said meal, $22 for a 12&#34; pizza an bruschetta seemed a tad pricey. Nevertheless, next time I shall take a moment on Moretti&#39;s website and printing a coupon or two before calling. The only thing better than a delicious meal, is a delicious discounted meal.

Do yourself a favor &amp; get it with a side of their ranch dressing...seriously amazing. You&#39;re welcome.  I should also mention that I prefer the Edison Park location both for food &amp; service.

The problem I have with both locations however, is that they seem to only hire female bartenders and, apparently the ones with either the least amount of experience or the ones with the least amount of customer service. Maybe just the dumbest they can find? As a female myself, I&#39;m comfortable enough to grab a quick drink/bite by myself at the bar. I&#39;m friendly and also industry. My point? I&#39;m easy, know what I want and tip generously.  

Every time I come to the Schaumburg location, I get some twit bartender who  doesn&#39;t seem to see me/remember I&#39;m there. It takes forever to greet me as I watch her make sure that EVERY guy at the bar is checked in on, joked with, (read flirted with). She will avoid me until I literally have to call her over to get a menu, a drink, a refill...u name it. It doesn&#39;t matter which female bartender.

So pleeeeeaaaase stop ignoring the women at your bar.  Greet EVERYONE within one minute...isn&#39;t that written somewhere?

I get to say that because I&#39;m the Duke of this place. If you&#39;ve got a problem with that, then check in here and take it away from this audacious Arizonan. 

But NOT before you chow down on what I feel is some of the best thin-crust pizza I&#39;ve ever had. Seriously, just bursting with flavor. That crust is amazing. That sauce is top-notch. They&#39;re not too stingy with the toppings, either. If you&#39;re feeling brave, go for the mac &#39;n&#39; cheese. The asiago crust is also decent, and the deep dish will do, but that thin crust is where it&#39;s at.

Atmosphere was also quite nice and spacious with various different seating areas and plentiful TV screens. 

Place is definitely known for their pizza and had a variety of toppings including italian beef and giardiniera (must try next time). Had their bruschetta to start which was very good. I had the mushroom risotto. While not bad, next time I would stick to pizza. The rice was well done and not al dente. There was nice flavor and mushrooms were plentiful that included about 3 different types. It was a tad saucy and salty for me. My bf ordered the special of a chicken pasta dish (forgot the exact name). However, our waitress put in the wrong order and got him the other special of fish and shrimp. She apologized and my bf chose to stick with this dish and she assured us there would be a discount, as it was her mistake. When our check came, we were very surprised to find that my bf&#39;s meal was completely comped. It would have been more than enough to have charged us the price of the chicken dish (as it was less than the fish/shrimp) but it was free! That is great service. Would come back again, but likely will stick to pizza.

I just can&#39;t give a five star review because their prices are a little outrageous- you&#39;ll easily pay well over $20.00 for a pizza that&#39;s very good, but you can get better for a lot cheaper. It&#39;s a very good thin crust pizza, could definitely be a little bit crunchier. Everything else I&#39;ve tried has been fantastic- they have a delicious chicken wrap and a cannoli dessert that you dip pieces of cannoli into a mascarpone cream dip- yum! They have a nice patio, but not a lot of good drink specials. Good ambiance inside, but I think they&#39;d do a lot better if they made the prices more reasonable and improved the drink specials.

Manger did honor original pricing quoted but no other compensation was offered.

morettis-ristorante-and-pizzeria-schaumburg,Maxine W.,LySrgOhB-NQ_xj7pbnYbYQ,twUwXY0HWfJfWAqUdmVy9A,"Let me first say that the pizza here is VERY GOOD. If you&#39;re looking for a review on the taste of the food, I&#39;d give it 4 stars. Unfortunately, this is a review on my experience as a whole.
I went to Moretti&#39;s yesterday for dinner with my mom and my yia yia. We got there around 5:45 and were given a pager and told it would be about 20-25 minutes. We did wait about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table in the back. It was the closest table to the kitchen. Normally I&#39;d ask to be seated somewhere else since my yia yia hates sitting by the kitchen, but the place was slammed. (1/2 off pizza on Tuesdays will ensure a busy restaurant). Now, you would think that being so close to the kitchen, we&#39;d be greeted right away. Not the case. By the time our server, Rachael (she didn&#39;t give us her name, but wrote it on our receipt), greeted us, we were already ready to order our drinks, appetizer, and pizzas. Our appetizer, a caprese salad, took an extraordinarily long time to come out, seeing as it didn&#39;t have to be cooked. 
While we were waiting, they sat the two tables surrounding us, and it got really tight. my mom was back to back with the man at the table behind us, which pretty much imprisoned the man next to us between the tables and the window. When he was ready to leave, the people at the other table had to get up and push in their chairs so he could get by, and he still knocked into my mom.
After our pizzas came, Rachael never came back to check on us, and I had an empty cup just waiting for a refill. We ordered sausage pizza and mac &amp; cheese pizza, both of which can make a girl thirsty! Rachael was very attentive to all her other tables around us but completely ignored us until we had to flag her down for a check. I got my refill... but someone else dropped it off while Rachael was printing our check. 
While we were waiting for Rachael to come back so we could pay, the hostess came by to try to seat the table next to us. (the same table that required people to get up and move so the man could get out) The table hadnt been cleaned yet, and it was missing a chair, and the hostess wanted a busboy to get in there right away to clean it up and get it ready. My mom was pretty fed up with being knocked around and told the hostess just to take the chair she was sitting in and she&#39;d move to another spot at our table until it was time to go. She also told her how Rachael had been scarce, and asked if she would just take our check.  The hostess was apologetic and apologized again when we were on our way out, and I appreciated that. However, she didn&#39;t apologize for the hullabaloo over seating that corner table. 
Step it up, Moretti&#39;s. You know you&#39;re going to be busy on Tuesdays, so maybe consider scheduling your &#34;A&#34; staff and moving the tables in the back so there&#39;s a little more wiggle room.",02/05/12,324,2,1,3,-54,2.3099000000000003,1.4000000000000001,0.862,25.737000000000005,No,2894

Nosh is definitely no secret, but it is slightly hidden on James Street, set back slightly farther than other store fronts.

The food and drinks are good.  I had the Monte Cristo Benedict, with a grape hollandaise sauce.  There are some solid breakfast staples on the menu as well as some inventive dishes - they&#39;ve really got the hollandaise thing down.  The eggs on my benedict were cooked perfectly, which is crucial to a good benedict!  The benedict came with a side of my choice - the potatoes were okay, just potatoes really, next time I&#39;ll try the ginger pears.  The food prices and portions are perfect.  Most entrees are in the $10-12 range.

The drinks are made well and decently sized and priced.  For $8, I had a really good raspberry pear mimosa.

The interior is a little blah and lacks some comfort at the tables in the center of the restaurant.  The service was good, but I felt a little rushed at the end of our meal, but I could have stayed for another drink to catch up with a friend.

Smallish and gratefully off the overworn Geneva shopping path, a major step above your usual independent diner variety, quality ingredients, furnishings and help. 
One of us, not me, was disappointed to find that the biscuits and gravy are only available on the weekends. My older brother had one of the best blueberry pancake plates he said he had ever had, and he knows blueberry pancakes. I went with the Chilaquiles plate because Renee said it was spicy, and it was a little spicy.  I had avocado added, but what it really needed was something to make it really a mess like tomatoes and more cheese. Picture good house made nachos in a thicker sea of chicken broth with a couple eggs over easy on top and some grated cheese, mushy, kind of a deconstructed egg nacho frittata without the shrooms, tomatoes and spinach.  Needed some texture and color, but I still liked it and appreciated the recommendation because it was different. I&#39;ll order it again in about 40 years if I don&#39;t have my teeth. You can also add other meats. I should have added the chorizo, didn&#39;t spot it until later, not my best ordering. By the way, adding all that almost doubles the price. Fairly priced for the level of quality and service.

Better than average coffee in nice LARGE mugs thank you. Not much sound absorption in there so it&#39;s LOUDer than it needs to be.

The restaurant was busy at 12:30 pm on a Friday, but we were still able to get a table right away. Our waitress was nice, checked in on us often, and asked before clearing our plates. Per usual, I had a bit of a tug of war between all the breakfast and lunch options. I mean really, how do you choose? I decided since I actually ate a decent breakfast that day, I would opt for the lunch side of the menu.

I&#39;ve been on a salad kick lately, so I went with the grilled steak salad. This leafy lunch includes grilled flat iron steak, mixed greens, tomato, red onion, and crumbled blue cheese with sweet mustard vinaigrette. Once I heard Olivia was adding avocado to her meal, I couldn&#39;t help but agree that it would be a great addition to my salad. Highly suggest doing this! The salad was tasty regardless, but the avocado paired nicely (like it usually does with most everything).

Being a Friday, we decided to indulge in a mimosa at lunch. I love that they have a fun mimosa list of flavors and other cocktails. Always nice to have options! That being said, I was feeling OJ so I stuck with a classic mimosa. And let me tell you, these bubbly cocktails aren&#39;t messing around!

They have a whole menu of mimosas and I believe I had something along the lines of mango pomegranate. It was SO tasty and believe me you it was quite a large glass not a dainty little thing. I loved my choice.

My food...was alright. I didn&#39;t particularly love the tri-colored benedict I ordered. Why, you may ask? Well, despite it&#39;s name, everything on my plate was so...beige. Really. Check out the pic attached. I&#39;m not even making up the name TRI-COLORED BENEDICT.

That said, I&#39;ve been here a few times before and have ordered other breakfast menu items I&#39;ve loved, including the Wisconsin Farmhouse Omelet.

Nosh is a cute space, kind-of reminded me of Eat Chow in Costa Mesa. The service was efficient. Food was solid...I ordered the lobster bisque with a side of seasoned fries. I tried my sister-in-laws&#39;s migas de pan caliente and kicked my own *** for not listening to the local order. AMAZING.

I ended up with the red eye benedict and it was fantastic.  I also had a bruleed grapefruit, which was DELICIOUS but difficult to eat in a restaurant.  I ended up with juice all over me :)

I think that the sides that come with breakfast were a little lacking.  The roasted potatoes were uninspired, as were the gingered pears.  My husband got french fries with his, which were delicious.  That would definitely be my recommendation, despite the issues I have with having french fries for breakfast.

However, some things about this place (based on my two visits) have left me less-than-wowed. First and foremost, it&#39;s INCREDIBLY LOUD. To the point of being unpleasant. There is no music to break up the clatter either, so 30 different conversations are competing to be heard.

The second problem has been service. I will concentrate on our visit today, but things were pretty much the same on our previous visit as well, although that was a weekend breakfast and today is Monday lunch. 

There is a plethora of staff, but they all seem to be rushing around, despite the small size of the restaurant. We were seated but not given menus, given three glasses of water instead of five, all of which were less than completely filled because the guy filling them was in too much of a hurry to pour enough water. Our waitress was nice enough, but she was not the one to bring our food. The person who did bring our food just sat each plate down in any old place, despite our indication of where each belonged. They were also very slow to pick up our payment by the time we were ready to leave. None of these issues is a deal-breaker though, especially with some of their tasty food offerings...

I had small portions of the savory French toast and the Nosh French toast. Both were delicious! I have an abundant appetite, so I probably could have eaten full portions of each. Also, try the bacon.

Come here early, y&#39;all. My friend and I got here at 8:30am and had a choice of tables, but left at 10 and the parking lot was full of people standing and waiting. Yikes! But they have a HUGE parking lot and ample street parking, so that&#39;s a good thing.

Anyway, the menu is very tiny and casually printed on a tri-fold piece of paper, and the interior is teeny (but very bright and visually appealing). We both ordered coffee and I am so mad at myself for not finding out what brand they brew because it was DELICIOUS. Strong, dark, amaze. I had I think 44 cups. Approx.

The menu has so many unique and delicious sounding options, with an entire column devoted to mexican-inspired/flavors items (be still my heart). They also have lots of unique and wonderful sounding sweet items - banana foster pancakes and a french toast with a lemon creme anglaise caught my eye, but I finally settled on the crab cake benedict, and my friend got a Mexican Benedict with a jalapeo hollandaise - uhhhyum. Being completely unable to exercise self control, we also got a &#34;tasting&#34; of the chocolate french toast (for $5! So worth it! Taste the rainbow of delish pancake/french toasts for $5 each!).

I seriously LOVED the presentation of our meals. The English muffins, crab cakes, and poached eggs were so perfectly round, with the hollandaise neatly adorning them. It was a very clean looking plate. Their breakfast potatoes were simply roasted, and there were even purple potatoes in my mix. I ate every bite!

The chocolate french toast was delicious, but cloyingly heavy/sweet. A tasting would be the only way to go for me.

I wasn&#39;t actually hungry, having eaten late, so I missed out on a full meal, but I had a cup of the creamy jalapeno soup, which was DIVINE: roasted jalapenos offered a sweet kiss of background heat against the smooth glide of cream. 

My two companions also got soup, each a different one. My aunt had lobster bisque, which she said rivaled what she&#39;d gotten on a recent trip to New England; and my father had hearty Tuscan soup, laden with beans in a sturdy broth. 

They went on to have entrees as well. My aunt raved about the construction of her portobello wrap: it didn&#39;t collapse as it was consumed, and oh yeah, it was delicious (she dubbed it &#34;one of the best sandwiches I ever ate.&#34;) My dad got a grilled chicken wrap and was also satisfied with the light, crispy bread that enclosed the filling.

The food is awesome - 5 stars for sure! They have some really different menu items, specifically the different types of bennys and french toasts. I wanted to try them all! Fun fact, you can get a sampler size of different items on the menu. My friend couldn&#39;t decide between 2, so she got a half portion of each. I wish they had that on the menu! I ended up getting the benny that was like a caprese salad. Sounds weird, but it was good! Everyone I was with enjoyed what they ordered. Their coffee and cocktails are also very good.

The service was good - we always had drinks filled and plates cleared. My only issue was, since this is such a small place there is a wait (of course). That&#39;s fine. There aren&#39;t many places to sit inside and wait, so you have to wait outside. I understand that they want to get more business and get people in and out, but we felt like we were being watched and rushed the entire time.

One of the water glasses had a lip print on it and she seemed irritated at the fact that we brought it up. So we got the black bean soup which was delicious. We also shared the eyekeya pancakes which were amazing and you must try them!

It was much less busy and we were seated right away. 

The decor is eclectic, not my style, but very trendy. We both ordered mimosas, which were fine. It was just a little overpriced for the small size of the glass they are served it. I ordered an omelette, even though I was intrigued by another dish, but I was disappointed to find that certain menu options are only available on the weekends. I guess it makes sense as a business decision, but it&#39;s definitely off putting to customers, especially when the wait is 1+hour to even get a table on the weekends. My Wisconsin Farmhouse omelette was ok, it was on the colder side, which is always a let down, especially since we had to wait a bit for the food.

Kristina U&#39;s review is dead on: &#34;Pretentious patrons and over-priced drinks.&#34; And not just the boozy kind. And the crowd... Oh the crowd. We felt very rushed by the bus staff, plus the acoustics of the place simply made everything worse. If you don&#39;t deal well with crowds and noise - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Nosh feels like it belongs in Wicker Park or Logan Square, not Geneva just West of the Fox River. All it needs is slightly more difficult parking, and they&#39;ll have nailed the whole thing perfectly.


Also, Celiacs and those with gluten issues beware. Your menu options are seriously restricted.

The jicama slaw was the best thing I had today, but again - there simply wasn&#39;t enough of it. And the &#34;cheesy vegetarian pink beans&#34; looked, smelled, and tasted like basic re-fried beans. And again, there were barely any on my plate.

I had Violet&#39;s Pancakes and they were good.  About half way through it started to taste overly sweet.  I couldn&#39;t finish it.  I did like the option to half your order.  2 pancakes (the size of a dinner plate) are more than enough for me.  I also ordered a side of apple smoked bacon and it was DELICIOUS.  I&#39;d go back for the bacon alone.
My husband ordered the whole wheat french toast and he really liked it.  I would say that the food didn&#39;t blow our minds nor did we leave saying we LOVED it but overall it was good.

The only thing that was annoying was the water guy. We weren&#39;t even seated  yet, we were trying to get our 1 year old situated in her high chair while de-winterizing her (removing her bulky winter coat, hat, mittens, etc) and the water guy was reaching over us, through us, every which way he could, trying to fill our waters.

As on past visits, when the room is full, it is very loud.  But you&#39;ll forget all about the noise when you taste the wonderful food.

Having already had the Egg&#39;r (yum), the Lorraine Omelet (Yum) and the Savory French Toast (YUM!), I decided to finally try the Jalapeno Benedict which has been calling to my taste buds since I first saw it on the menu.  I always avoided it on previous visits because I thought it would be too heavy, particularly on a work day, but was I ever wrong!  The skirt steak is done to perfection and the jalapeno hollandaise is light and fresh with just the perfect amount of heat at the back of your throat to make this a winner anyway you look at it.

My wife is not typically an eggs Benedict fan because of the richness, but she tried the salmon version and was pleased beyond compare.  Again, the hollandaise was light and fresh and the dill in the sauce was a great complement to the delicious cured  salmon.

This first visit was very disappointing to say the least. I ordered the crab cake benedict, and the crab cake was overseasoned and overfried, which overtook all the delicate flavors of the crab. Worse was the egg that came with the benedict, which was not poached but soft boiled (seriously? don&#39;t they teach you that in Cooking 101?). Mine wasn&#39;t the only problem poached egg either, 2 others received the same. I also tried out the french toast, and those were just standard albeit weirdly cut in strips like steak fries, but the taste nothing special. But then I started tasting the sauce that was on the french toast against the sauce on the crab benedict, and it ended up being the exact same bland sauce, some mystery yellow sauce that didn&#39;t seem to be hollandaise or creme anglais. I like mysteries, but what the?!?! Even the side of bacon was served cold, I could have eaten precooked microwave bacon that was crispier.
I did enjoy the fresh squeezed orange juice, the side of honey pears that came with the benedict, but come on now. When the people taking me out start saying stuff like, &#34;maybe the chef is having an off day...&#34; or, &#34;it really isn&#39;t like this usually...&#34;, that means many other people in the group are having the exact same thought, which was &#34;I wish we could rewind and go somewhere that&#39;s actually good.&#34;

I expected a wait from the articles I have read but even though the restaurant was small we were quickly seated.

My wife and I both order the Nosh French Toast which is described as 
&#34;Our special recipe of challah bread soaked in vanilla-orange zest infused batter, served with lemon creme anglaise and powdered sugar&#34;

The french toast is said to be three pieces of bread but it was hard to tell since it is served slice into strips.  The french toast itself was a bit dry and although the batter and sauce seemed excellent the bread itself was thin and dry. Hardly &#34;soaked&#34;.  Looking at the toast as I worked my way down it seems that my wife and I were both served end pieces of the loaf so this may have accounted for the toughness of the meal.

jamesons-charhouse-huntley,Sarah H.,eg-fbYurZH3Zc_I9AEZlcw,OgYFfUOlkD3aLYzLxr8pCw,"I held my wedding reception in the Drendel ballroom adjacent to Jamison&#39;s charhouse. My wedding food was catered by Jamison&#39;s.  I&#39;m always very honest with reviews so I have several pros and cons to share. 
Cons; we ordered the chicken marsala and it was different from the chicken we received in our tasting. The chicken we got in our tasting was  not breaded and was lightly salted. But the chicken they served to all of our guests turned out to be breaded and too salty for most of our guests. A lot of guests did not finish their meals. The green beans and mashed potatoes were good most people eat those. 
- there are two managers at Jamison&#39;s and one other manager who I think is part time. Most of the time it took a week or two for my questions to be answered. When it comes to wedding planning waiting a week or two means your other vendors have to wait a week or two as well. That&#39;s not OK. The restaurant is always very busy and I understand that they have to spend most of their time running the restaurant. It would be helpful if they had a separate manager who only took care of banquets and weddings. Waiting over two weeks to get the dimensions of tables just so I can place my tablecloth rentals is unacceptable. 
- A wedding cake and sweets table is included in the wedding package, however fondant frosting is not included in your wedding cake. I was not informed of this and almost had to redesign my entire cake 9 days before my wedding. There is no information on the actual wedding package menu about certain types of frosting not being included. When I called to try to resolve the issue Jamison&#39;s staff basically blamed it on me. I thought that was really unprofessional. They ended up paying for the fondant but not until after the staff member made sure to tell me that it was all my fault. 
PROs; The ballroom (which is part of Del Webb) was very spacious and modern. The gallery where we held our cocktail hour was also spacious and had a great view of the golf course. 
- on the day of the wedding Jamison staff did a great job getting everything running on time. We did not have to wait too long  for the next course to be served. 
- Jamison&#39;s has a wedding package menu and also a banquet menu that is less expensive. So it&#39;s actually a great option for all budgets. 
-The cake included in the wedding package menu is ordered from sugar Hill&#39;s bakery. If you&#39;re from this area and you know that Sugar Hills is the best bakery around. So that&#39;s a plus. 
Overall I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the food, and  I would&#39;ve ordered a different meal for everyone had I know it was going to taste and look completely different from what I received during my tasting. I did not even eat my meal. 
I wasn&#39;t happy with the response time or the attitude of some of the staff. To be honest I kind of felt uncomfortable some of the time. There is a lot going on during your wedding day so I didn&#39;t have to deal with that too much. When you&#39;re a banquet manager taking your sweet time in replying and overall poor communication is unacceptable. Especially when you blame your shortcomings on your clients. Everything leading up to the big day was pretty stressful with these guys.",15/09/16,317,3,1,3,-23,2.4705,3.02,2.246,31.733999999999998,No,3272

First, the location is great. The parking lot is large and always has spots available. The building is up to date and clean. The view over the golf course is great on both sunny and rainy days. We haven&#39;t tried eating outside, yet, but it promises to be good as well. Five stars, here.

The service is decent, but not stellar. If you remember that this restaurant is located within a retirement community, the exceedingly slow service is at least somewhat acceptable. Still on the slow side, but polite and mostly (though not always) remember what you asked for. Four stars, but a lower rating here if they weren&#39;t most often serving retired seniors who seem to have no urgency - my family included. ;-)

The food is decent, though a mostly average diner-like menu. The steaks are not their strong suit, even thought it&#39;s called a &#39;Charhouse&#39;! Their salads are very basic, but taste fresh. Soups are OK, though some are a bit salty for my taste. Vegetables and some rice tend to be overcooked, but &#39;functional. Some of their fish and chicken dinners are decent, though I did one time have fish which tasted &#39;fishy&#39;. They did replace this dish, but in general things are not worth the prices charged. Most often, the ingredients seem to be fresh (fishy meal excepted), though the preparation is very standard. Three stars, and just barely at that because of the complacency of the cooks to not be more creative or create more appetizing meals.

I average these three points to come up with a decent four-star rating. If you are looking for the food, go elsewhere.

Hard to pass on the very moist carrot cake which was shared by three or four at the table. Even DH who insisted he did not want dessert took several forkfuls!

Our waitress was wonderful.  She was very attentive, and our food came out quickly.

This is the most disgusting food I have had in a LONG time.  A couple months ago when I went I got a chicken breast dinner that arrived in this absolutely vile cream sauce that tasted and smelled like it came straight out of a pouch.  It also had mushrooms, which I&#39;m pretty sure were out of a can (there&#39;s no excuse for that, EVER). 

This past Sunday I was forced to go back and chose to get the buffet/brunch, figuring there had to be something edible.  Let me say, the oatmeal cookie I had was fantastic.  However, the macaroni &amp; cheese (another worst ever - the color should have tipped me off), and eggs Benedict were seriously so repulsive I couldn&#39;t force myself to eat them.  I went back for a waffle which at least didn&#39;t make me want to vomit, but wasn&#39;t great.  I decided to get a salad, (because how can you mess up lettuce)...and the salad dressing was awful.   I then gave up.  I left a buffet HUNGRY. How does that happen? 

I do have to say our server both times was friendly and accommodating.  I wish she could get a job somewhere else.

On the other hand the service has been so slow I may be moving into the Del Web retirement village by the time they serve me my food. So lets get the bad out of the way first. Crazy long wait to get our food after ordering, I have dined her twice and both times same thing has happened. Almost 2 1/2 hours to get in and out is way to long for a suppose to be quick casual dinner. People who arrived after us where leaving before us and others you could see had same problem we did, long wait. Bus boys are non existent have to beg for bread and water then wait and wait and ask again. Really it just get irritating trying to track your waiter or bus boy down for something. You have to ask for everything it is never just done for you,  have to ask for more water, more bread, want another drink ect ect. I think it&#39;s a little unprofessionally run and they could stand to have someone in and train the service staff how things should work. Makes it hard to want to go back, but in-laws live out there so sure we will give it another try. Next time though I will preempt the slow service with directions what we need and problem before we order and see if that helps. 

The good part!!! We live in city so seeing the prices for drinks and food makes my wallet smile. Glasses of wine for 6 bucks bloody marys on Sunday for 5 bucks the list goes on can&#39;t argue with that. Food same deal with prices I had a  NY strip steak for 21 bucks includes salad or soup plus potato  and veggie. Everything is priced that way and portion sizes won&#39;t leave you hungry. ( Thats unless service is so slow they keep you so long you should of eaten 2 meals, I couldn&#39;t resist.) The food is also really good both times I have had NY strip although it was over cook a bit for medium rare but still a little pink and great steak quality with a nice char crust. Wife liked her filets also a little over cooked, so my advice is order undercooked to your liking. Sides where pretty good kinda like banquet food but ok. Everyone else has always liked their food and its a nice atmosphere with view of grounds  but no one liked waiting or having to ask for everything.

So next time your driving down I90 remember my review and stop there for a great meal.

We decided to give Jameson&#39;s a try. Between the seven of us, we have tried two of their other locations and have been pleased. We were hopeful that this location would be just as good. 

Overall, it was a nice meal. You can tell that they are still trying to work out the kinks, but it wasn&#39;t bad by any stretch of the imagination. Sam (probably Samantha) was our server. She&#39;s was a sweetheart and I give her real kudos for keeping up with our nutty bunch. I think this is one of Sam&#39;s first jobs, but she did well. :-) 

We all had soup (which came with the reasonably priced meal). It was awesome! Chicken tortellini soup and cream of broccoli. The bowls were practically licked clean. Soup and warm breadsticks were an ideal start to our lunch. 

We had potato skins and calamari as an appetizer. This is my one real complaint about the meal. Both were overcooked. The potato skins were visibly burnt. And the calamari was fried waaaay too long. Needless to say, our hungry group ate both anyhow. 

I had a fried shrimp dinner with mashed potatoes. The shrimp were fried just right. The mashed potatoes were homemade with the skins on and delish! My sister had London Broil with mashed potatoes. Normally, I avoid London Broil because it is a chewy, cheap cut of meat. Not in this instance. For less than $10, she had a tender cut of beef with great flavor. My hubby went with a burger covered in BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and onion strings with french fries. He enjoyed his burger and said that he would go back. Mom &amp; Grandma shared a burger and fries (Grandma is a light eater these days). Both were happy with the meal and said that they would go back. My step-dad had pork chops. They were thick and juicy - like they should be. No complaints there. Finally, my soon-to-be-brother-in-law (I need to find a shorter title for him...), had a Parmesan crusted chopped steak. He was quiet through the meal which means it must have been good. 

Glasses were kept full (even on a hot summer day when we were very thirsty)! Empty dishes were picked up promptly. I hope we can find a reason to head out to lunch again soon!",01/08/11,273,3,3,5,66,7.447300000000001,4.943,1.7349999999999999,32.322,No,2278

...it was just meh.  Well we were seated, and then waited for our waitress...for a verrrrry long time.  We had to flag the hostess back down for water (which she never brought) and we had picked out our meal and sat there for a good 10 minutes more before our waitress came around.  So the experience didn&#39;t start off very well.

We got a lot of different food--burgers, sandwiches, steak, and the kids got macaroni and cheese.  Our entire bill was $54 for everything, which wasn&#39;t bad for four adults and one kids meal, but everything took SO long to get.  Even after we ordered, we waited for.ev.er for the soup to come out, and then the entrees.

We had to flag down the waitress for the check after waiting for it for about 20 minutes.  So basically we arrived at 12:30 and we didn&#39;t leave there until after 2:30.  It was rough with two young kids.

I probably wouldn&#39;t go back.  It wasn&#39;t worth the frustration.",01/08/11,122,3,2,2,19,1.9728,1.2599999999999998,0.40900000000000003,11.331999999999999,No,1112

The food is fabulous and nothing on the menu is over $20, except a few specials that may go as high as $25.   The soups are homemade, the Calamari is superb and the Potato Skins are HUGE!   My mother had a Blue Cheese Burger and said that it was one of the best burgers that she has ever had.   I had the Filet and Shrimp.   It was cooked to a perfect med-rare and the shrimp was marinated in a delicious house marinade.  
Everyone was more than happy about thier choices.   

This is a perfect place for a family gathering or a birthday.  We hosted our daughers Graduation dinner here.  
It is VERY family friendly, so it is definitley a top on my list of kid friendly places!

Carrot cake for dessert was great, too. Service was good. The only complaint is the layout is pretty much just an open room of tables. Feels a tad cafeteria on layout.

I was able to get a few things, but went to my seat feeling annoyed at paying for a full buffet that was over half empty.  I know others also felt the same.  My feeling is that if you are seating people at 4:30, the entire table should be as full as when you seating those at noon, or 2 PM.  They finally started filling some of the containers, but I felt unsure about eating the salad or dressings or fruit.  That looked liked it was left out since morning.

1) Was the order-taking process painless?  Yes, the manager who took our order allowed us to use multiple stickers in one transaction and was courteous.
2) Was the order arrived in a timely manner?  Yes, it was given to us fairly quickly.  We orders two (2) orders of medium fries, two (2) orders of Oreo McFlurry, and one (1) order of cheeseburger.  
3) Did we find any bug or foreign object in our food?  No, unless they existed but couldn&#39;t see them because they were than 0.2 microns.
4) Was the location clean?  Sure, it was located with the gas station and some local folks hang out here.  The crowd looked legit, not shady.

Initially concerned about out attire, which was extremely casual at best. those concerns quickly vanished when we entered and saw an extremely diverse attire of formal to beach to business and to barn--we felt comfortable!   

We were early for our reservations, so grabbed seats at the bar. The jazz band was amazing, and amazingly LOUD!!

Our bartender was knowledgable-made us a  mule, brandy manhattan and the house margarita. Before we got the opportunity to taste, the hostess directed us to our table. Once seated, found all drinks to be made just right....hubby is a manhattan snob, myself very picky about my mules and the kid fussy about the tequila used in any of his tequila drinks.    

The band was still overbearingly LOUD even in the dining area. Thankfully, their sound, although extremely LOUD was great-guessing the intense volume is a managerial/sound system issue--not a problem of the band.  

Our waiter, Landon, was a stitch--we needed that humor to end our day.  

The bread basket was served with a plate of roasted garlic, shredded cheese and balsamic vinegar-delightful change to simply bread and butter.  

Service was a touch on the slow side, but we had much to discuss-so as long as the drinks were full we barely noticed the time. Besides, I absolutely HATE service personell that rush you into ordering.  

Landon kept an eye on us, making sure we had what we needed without stalking or being pushy. We started with bacon blue cheese chips and some oysters. Disappointingly they were out of oysters and the chips didn&#39;t make it to the table before our main course but we didn&#39;t care as the chips were right up my alley of crunchy, gooey, blue cheese, bchamel and bacon goodness.  Even my husband and son, who generally steer clear of blue cheese (leaving more for me) found them to be quite appetizing. Thankfully it was a very generous serving-more than the three of us could eat-no worries, they&#39;re great reheated on the pizza stone at home.

We all asked many questions of our server, Landon, regarding the main courses, as we weren&#39;t sure which to order-lots of very appealing/sounding choices on the menu. We all split a gut when the music suddenly stopped to hear Landon screaming ordering ideas to us!  He was embarrassed but had a cute comeback to defuse the situation

Hubby had the penne w/grilled chicken, steamed broccoli and another manhattan. I was torn between the rib eye, kalamata pork tenderloin and moussaka. Landon said they were all great choices, asked me a few questions about my personal tastes--I decided on the moussaka and another mule. Our son had rib eye, side of roasted sweet tato, glazed baby carrots and another margarita.  

As we waited for meals to arrive, Landon was both attentive and entertaining. Hubby and he had a lot of laughs together, joking back and forth-keeping the kid and I almost in tears laughing with his comebacks and entertaining quips.

Dinner arrived and upon seeing my son&#39;s rib eye, commented on how it was kinda on the thin side.BUT once he cut into it, using the table knife, it was obviously super tender and cooked perfectly to his liking. It may not of had the superb flavor of a Mastro&#39;s-NOT saying it was flavorless-just needed a little steak sauce. Then again, this is a mediterranean dig, not a steakhouse! The roasted sweet tato and carrots were like dessert, although the kid thought both could have used more butter.

1/2 way through the meal, a manager stopped at our table, embarrassingly apologizing and handing our son a steak knife-which we had NOT asked for-as the steak was tender enough NOT to need it. Perhaps some sort of rules or policy that hadn&#39;t been adhered to?? We chuckled once the manager left at the silliness of his well intended handing off of the knife. Soon after Landon stopped by to check on us and my son handed the steak knife back. Landon looked perplexed at this gesture, and I started rolling on the floor when my son explained--just as the manager coincidently walked by again and wrenched his neck hearing the &#34;I don&#39;t need it&#34; comment.    

Hubby&#39;s penne and chicken had wonderful flavor-the penne was cooked perfectly. Sauce wasn&#39;t overbearing and very tasteful.

I thought my mouth was in heaven with the richness and full deep flavors of my moussaka.  Seriously good, comfort mediterranean dish-with ground beef not the traditional lamb which was fine with me!!

I&#39;ve been wanting to check this place out for a long time and for one reason or another didn&#39;t get there. As other reviewers say, it&#39;s definitely a hidden gem and worth finding. 

They have a really wine and craft beer selection, although the wines by the glass is a little on the high side, beers are priced just right. They also offer some great cocktails too.

As you walk in the door, you; re greeted very warmly, they offer to take your coat, everyone is professional and friendly. The place itself feels like a high quality restaurant you&#39;d find in the city. I love the huge &#34;cityscape&#34; of Chicago over the bar, beautiful.

We each out off of the prix fixed menu, she had the salmon and I had the short ribs and they were fantastic as others have said. They offered me a steak knife to cut it with, but it was so tender it wasn&#39;t needed. The salmon was also delicious, had a really nice glaze and was cooked just right. 

They also were very accommodating of my date as she is lactose intolerant and the desserts that were offered with the prix fixed meal had dairy in them so the waiter brought a serving of fresh berries instead.

The place is certainly a $$$ but well worth it, we will be going again!",28/02/16,139,5,2,5,49,6.0244,3.0189999999999992,0.088,9.892999999999999,No,1301

Wait staff is a little wanting though. It always takes a while before our orders are taken or our waters filled- even though the place isn&#39;t crowded. 
The bathrooms are also tricky to go to- it&#39;s down a steep flight of stairs so if you are a little older or have issues with steep narrow stairs, it will be a huge problem. The last waiter we had we thought was a little too informal and way too chatty and he tried to talk us out of ordering some of our favorites because he said it doesn&#39;t taste good and started gossiping about their current kitchen chaos and a lot about his personal life situation.

We started in the bar for cocktails, which was nice.  We were promptly seated at our reservation time.  Despite there being quite a few open tables, we were seated immediately next to an ordering station--one of those little kiosks that servers use to enter dinners.  Maybe I&#39;m sensitive, but there was a large LCD screen lit about 4 feet in front of me and slightly to the right.  It was distracting and not a very nice place to sit.  So, right away, I politely asked to get a different table and the hostess took care of it and got us a new table.  Great service.

Our server during dinner was great.  He did a good job of paying attention to our dinner and pace.  We were there for a nice date and great conversation, and I thought he did a great job of keeping the timing of the service great.  He slowed things down and didn&#39;t rush them, which was exactly what we wanted.  I feel like servers who are &#34;in tune&#34; with the diners are hard to find; so this was a very pleasant experience.

My biggest problem is that the food was just alright.  We both ordered medium rare hanger steak.  I had a side of sauted mushrooms and Brussel sprout/bacon.  Wow was it salty.  Generally speaking, we both like salt and add it regularly to our food at home.  Here, however, we both thought that our dishes had an overpowering amount of salt (not just the steak but also the sides next to the steak).  Salt is one of those things where you can tolerate a bite or two of something that is salty, but each bite adds up.  At some point, you&#39;ve had enough salty bites that you&#39;re not sure you want to take another.    

So, the ambiance was good.  The service was great.  The entrees were hard for us to eat.  Ugh.",29/02/16,199,2,2,5,40,4.905300000000001,4.620000000000001,2.154,18.226,No,1796

Extremely dissapointed after having dinner last Saturday at 7:00pm with a party of four.

1st Attempted to resolve during dinner &amp; spoke with the GM Jonathan Cook

2nd attempt was made &amp; I called the restaurant &amp; again spoke w/ Jonathan Cook. He remembered our table &amp; before I could provide any specifics, I was put on hold for 2 mins &amp; he returned and offered to send a token gift certificate.  I declined his offer and thanked him yet responded I&#39;m surprised you would not want to know specifically &#34;why&#34; we were unhappy.  He had no interest in finding out and I ended the call...

Why I would not recommend City Gate Grill for the service or the food

Party of 4 seated with a reservation in a section with one server and no back up servers.  Our Server already had a large party of 20-25.  Service through the entire meal was poor.  We were greeted by the server after sitting at the table for 10 minutes.  He was polite &amp; knowledgeable yet clearly overwhelmed.  

After our appetizers were served &amp; eaten, our plates, and drinks sat empty for over 10 minutes, I excused myself &amp; found the GM and explained our dissatisfaction with &#34;no&#34; service.  He came to the table, cleared it &amp; explained we were in good hands with his senior server.  He never returned to the table for the entire evening.

I reminded the server 2x to bring my dirty martini w/ blue cheese stuffed olives &amp; finally received it with pimento stuffed olives.  Waters were left emtpty through out the meal.

Food:
Appetizers - Bacon wrapped dates &amp; shrimp were ok yet I would not recommend it. There were 2 small shrimp &amp; 2 dates (4 total) that were wrapped in bacon.


Dinners:
Gnocchi - The gnocchi was not homemade &amp; reminded of the processed pasta that you see on the shelf.  The dish was oversauced so the flavors were not detectable
Rib eye steak - The steak was delicious but 30/40% was not eaten b/c it was all fat and grisle.  
Hanger steak - Excellent
Braised short ribs - Excellent
Desserts - best part of the meal / Choclolate ganache &amp; cheesecake

Sides: I ordered 2 sides, the creamed spinach &amp; Brussels sprouts but the server forgot to bring them

When we were presented with the check, nothing was comped even though the service was horrible &amp; only 50% of the meal was acceptable...  I gave the server our credit card &amp; said I was glad that we were not charged for the sides that I never received, he returned with the check &amp; advised he took off the corkage fee on two bottles of wine we brought into the restaurant.  We thanked him and ended our evening...",13/02/16,279,2,1,4,-10,3.1355,2.289,0.932,15.778999999999998,No,2671

citygate-grille-naperville,Kristina K.,6aV9FowZUgxaJpD7YSdGgA,iVAOaaFMZlnTT_FSUjlKwA,"Thoughts on CityGate Grille you ask? Really good ones.

My friend suggested the place. She had been here a few times and said that she had loved it. The place is nice. Nothing special about the decor but clean and classy. It was infested by baby boomers but I can live with that. After all it is naperville. 

My friend said that we didnt need reservations so we never called. She was right. We got there at 815 and got seated right away. We had a great view of the band, which by the way were great. They brought the place alive. (I am a sucker for a live band though so I may be a bit bias).

As far as drinks go, we had a bottle of chanti (dont know the name but it was the only chanti offered). Good wine! They had a ton of drinks on the menu but it was a wine kind of night. For food both of my friends had steak and risotto and I had scallops and risotto. My scallops were great and so was the risotto. The steak was great as well but the risotto that came along with it did not compare to the pine nut and leek risotto that was offered with my dish. The food was great overall but a bit overpriced I thought. Sure it was delicious but it wasn&#39;t very well presented either. I had 3 scallops,  which accounts for 10 dollar a scallop so it better be presented in the most gorgeous way, no? 
Being so pricey I am not sure it is a place I plan on frequeting that often but if there is a special occasion then sure I shall stop by. 

The reason I deducted a star it is due to the location of the toilets. You have to walk outside of the restaurant to take care of business. It is located in the basement of the place and I find that annoying. I shouldnt have to mentally prepare myself to use the restroom. It is so far.

When we go here to eat though, I still think this place rocks.  It&#39;s not crowded during the week at all.  Just like some businessmen and stuff.

There is no word in the English language to use to describe how absolutely divine the food is.

They bring you out bread and crushed roasted garlic with parmesan and olive oil to start your dining experience.

One of my favorite meals is the ribeye.  But the skirt steak is good too.  If you go in fall and they have the pumpkin spice soup... GET IT!!!!! It is so amazing.  It&#39;s not sweet, more savory.  The best way I could explain it to you is that it taste like tomato soup made out of pumpkins.

Pablo is my favorite server here, as he remembers us.  Well everyone remembers us here.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just cause we got married here, but even before that... they remembered us.

The drink are awesome too!

This place makes you feel like you&#39;re spending a million dollars to eat there with prices that are comparable to Maggiano&#39;s and Other nice places.  Maybe even cheaper.

Brittiny, the social event coordinator, assisted me in making this an absolutely perfect evening.  The party was just immediate family so there were only 11 of us, and we fit perfectly in the Wall Street Room.  When I learned they had audio/video equipment available I decided to create a family photo slide presentation that we played throughout the dinner, which was a huge hit with the family - as anyone who has worked with AV equipment knows, the success of a presentation is contingent on the equipment and their equipment ran flawlessly.  

Miguel was our head waiter and he was outstanding - professional, attentive and personable.  Those assisting him were also professional and personable.  Some in our group even joked about how our water glasses were mysteriously kept filled, which speaks to how deftly the wait staff works.

Everything ran smoothly from the moment we got there until the moment we left.  The food was exceptional - from the appetizers to the dinners and then dessert.  For appetizers we ordered the seafood platter, caprese flatbread and sashimi grade blue fin tuna - all of it was excellent.   The sushi eaters in our group fought over the last pieces of tuna.  

Dinners selections in our group ranged from duck to seafood to beef - again, all excellent.  We had a couple foodies in our group and a couple picky eaters - even they were very happy with their meals.  My parents were given a complimentary cheesecake dessert, which was very thoughtful and delicious.  Everyone was also very happy with their drinks and wine selections.

When speaking with Holley over the telephone she seemed very excited in our theme,  which is The Great Gatsby,  and was very what I thought to be attentive during our conversation. When my husband and daughter arrived for our appointment and to view the proposal it was the complete opposite if our telephone conversation. Nothing that my daughter nor myself wanted  was included in the proposal. Chair covers, bows, centerpieces were were all in addition to the $9000.00 proposal. We wanted wanted a cash bar,  and buffet style dinner as 80% of our guests we age 15 and 16. The proposal included open bar, and a plated duet dinner with a party lasting only until 10 pm, when we clearly stated we needed the venue until midnight.  Weddings are their forte, obviously.  So if that&#39;s what your looking to book this venue for I&#39;m sure they are capable.  If Miss Holley would have taken they time to listen to the &#34;guest of honor&#34; and included in her proposal the wants and needs of us as well, perhaps we would have booked with them.

citygate-grille-naperville,Nicole G.,HScwarO_iWpp1RI98ScG4w,tYessJFxSWam1KmPwzEp6g,"Very disappointing!! Went for valentines day, weeks in advance the soonest reservation was for 930pm (which is completely understandable) but the restaurant was EMPTY... Which I found odd. 

Coat check, valet and host services were all friendly and attentive, our waiter wasn&#39;t too bad but he got frustrated with my indecision - as if there were lines of people waiting and he was trying to get us in and out as quickly as possible... Let me remind you it was after 930 and the place was near desolate! 

I asked if the salmon was farm raised or wild caught, the waiter said &#34;it&#39;s from Scotland&#34; So I repeated my question which was met with &#34;I don&#39;t know, do I need to ask?&#34; I said &#34;please&#34;, he groaned and rolled his eyes and walked away... Come to find out the salmon is farm raised ( which I refuse to eat, disgusting!!!) so I asked for another minute to look at the menu... Waiter seemed peeved... 

We ended up with a bottle of wine (that was almost triple the price on the menu than at the liquor store-because I checked- but once again that&#39;s somewhat expected), the calamari, which was nothing special and had wayyyy more garnish than squid, then
I had the asiago stuffed gnocchi, it left much to be desired and the was no asiago flavor whatsoever, straight ricotta inside, I swear. the &#34;crispy eggplant&#34; was literally just breaded fried cubes of eggplant thrown on top... Eh.
Boyfriend had steak, whipped potatoes and asparagus... Steak was cooked almost perfectly (asked for med and it was med rare but he didn&#39;t mind) So that&#39;s a plus but the asparagus was scrawny and withered-Like it was frozen or sat for hours and had been reheated more than once, he didn&#39;t comment much on the potatoes... Plating was sloppy.

Overall for an upscale restaurant with higher end pricing we avid foodies were extremely disappointed!!! They use low quality ingredients and try to dress them up in fancy names and big price tags! The plating and presentation could have made up for the lackluster flavor but that was sloppy as well. We don&#39;t mind paying high prices for food that is worthy of such, but this place has no business charging what they do for what you&#39;re actually getting!

The two stars given were for the friendly and accommodating staff, the somewhat nice atmosphere... Bonus points for the fact that it&#39;s Greek owned &amp; I support my people.

BUT:

Boyfriend and I agreed we will absolutely NOT ever be back. There are much better options in the area that use quality ingredients and are lower priced, such as Cooper&#39;s Hawk or Two Brothers Roundhouse!!!",18/02/14,286,2,1,-1,-60,-1.1622000000000001,1.1440000000000001,1.7370000000000003,12.12,No,2642

Very corporate/hotel-y feel, great valet service, you enter through the lobby of an office building. Do note the cool art from the Calamos Collection, very interesting self portrait of Zorba the Greek by Anthony Quinn.

Front end service was awesome; valets, hostess, coat check all friendly and attentive.

We got there well before the big &#34;NYE Party&#34; began. The main dining room is on the main level with a party space downstairs where the NYE festivities were being held.

The service and food were all great. 4 diners, all different meals; Salmon, Short Rib, Steak and Shrimp Pasta dish.

The beef dishes were great, as were there corresponding sauces, risottos, gravies.

To my taste the salmon was underdone, but that is pretty common and I probably should have made sure and asked for it medium.

Everything was well made, well presented, brought out timely and to the right person.

The space itself is great. As odd as it sounds, the view of 88 and the area around it was kinda cool at night. The bar dining room are one big area and there is bar seating as well.

Before, I start, I will say the food, atmosphere and service in general were good.  

The issues we had were with the Event Staff.  The coordinator changed midway between the signing of the contract and the actual event.  The first coordinator had made multiple promises that couldn&#39;t be kept.  She had no notes of our conversations or the prices she promised us.  Fortunately, we kept meticulous notes and were able to re-negotiate to fit our budget by making some changes.  On our final meeting with the new coordinator we had discussed what to do after our event ended.  We were told very clearly that we could either to CityGate Grill until they closed or to SugarToad or Tee Time at the hotel as they were open later.  Thus no formal arrangements were needed.  

During the event our DJ was told to inform everyone that we would be going to Tee Time near the hotel after the bar closed.  Shortly after this announcement, we were pulled aside to be informed that CityGate and Tee Time would be closed and SugarToad was closed for a private party .  Thus we had 100 guests having a great time and waiting to continue celebrating together and had no where to go.  We asked what they could do to accommodate us....nothing.  They left the bar (now cash bar) open an additional 15 minutes and acted as if they were doing us a huge favor.  Conveniently, the new coordinator was nowhere to be found for this conversation, but 5 other staff members and a security guard were.  While there was one incident with one guest having mixed medication and alcohol, the party was very tame to our knowledge.  We weren&#39;t informed of any additional issues or reasons for this change in plans.  The excessive staff and security had our guests concerned and talking.  Not fun to answer 50 questions about what happened, when it was really the staff not accommodating our event and making all our guests uncomfortable.

All in all, we felt the coordination of the event was poor from the begin.  Lack of responses, changing promises, etc.  lead to MUCH unneeded stress on the planning committee.  Unfortunately, we will not be recommending this venue to the classes behind ours or to others.",14/10/14,236,2,1,3,-12,2.6103000000000005,2.116,1.5499999999999998,20.333,No,2345

After driving past CityGate tons and tons of times, and open availability on OpenTable, I booked our 7PM reservation. From the beginning, we had a great experience. The complimentary valet was really nice, and the valet guy was super friendly.

We were seated by the window in a quiet corner, and promptly tended to by our server. She mentioned that during the summer months they offer 1/2 priced bottles of wine- which is awesome! While the menu is not huge, I found many things that I would have loved to order. My boyfriend and I both got the wedge salad and filet. The service was very prompt, my only complaint is that we recieved our entrees before finishing our salads. It&#39;s not a huge deal, but would have been nice if timed a little better. Both of our filets were cooked perfectly and each came with two sides - I choose asparagus and the three cheese mac n&#39; cheese. My boyfriend chose broccoli and carrots - both of which were delicious and very flavourful. While they offered dessert, we opted out. The menu looked fantastic though!

The atmosphere was very nice, clean, and modern. They had a live jazz band which seemed to be a big hit with those sitting at the bar. The music was not too loud and made for great background ambiance. 

Our server was super nice and attentive. I forget her name...

PS- Prior to ordering, we were served with fresh roasted garlic, a tomato mixture, and pita bread- which was very tasty!

We&#39;ll definately be back to try other menu offerings. Although CityGate is a little off the beaten path, it&#39;s nice to find a quality restaurant close to home.",24/07/13,189,4,3,5,77,6.609000000000001,4.252999999999999,0.624,16.123,No,1680

Maybe it&#39;s because the restaurant shares a lobby with an investment firm, but it felt a little like peering into the Big Boy&#39;s Club: it wouldn&#39;t phase me if a multi-million dollar Wall Street deal took place here over steaks &#39;n&#39; scotch.

Anyway, on to what matters! The waiter was extremely attentive and considerate. Even the bus boy, when pouring ice water, shielded his hand with a napkin to prevent any water from potentially splashing me. I was shocked by this move and said as much. The poor soul&#39;s demeanor suggested he may have been lashed before, god help that wayward drop of water.

A fresh basket of bread (cut into clever slivers that resembled chips) arrived alongside cloves of garlic, which the waiter crushed right in front of us with a fork!

citygate-grille-naperville,Melissa L.,oedIFmYQViZ9F2F-dvDNMg,n-SrYHPARE4Xn-qfpHlLrg,"The main function of CityGate Grill is to serve visiting investment clients and  bankers who want to party in a stately setting. This wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing if the food and service were on par with this lofty vision, but it isn&#39;t.

Food overall was fine. Entree portions are on the small side, so appetizers and a salad are in order. Lots of seafood, but I found some things lacking. The mussels were really small instead of being fat and luscious. The chorizo sauce that came with it was very good though. The lobster bisque was fine, but a bit skimpy on the lobster. I would have preferred chunks instead of  hairy filaments. The scallops were fine, but could have been seared more crisply outside to complement the buttery richness of the inside.

They offer a lot of fancy drinks, but don&#39;t have a solid knowledge of your classic cocktails. I asked for a negroni - Campari, gin, sweet vermouth - and they had to come back and ask what was in it. I&#39;m no cocktail snob, but really?

The decor is a rushed interpretation of luxury Euro-American with a tinge of oversized suburbia. Lots of dark stained wood and a slightly chilly feel. Service is appallingly bad. Lots of long waits yet waitstaff are seen lingering around?  We waited a while to order dessert and once more for our checks. In this case, they were working a party celebrating a really old guy&#39;s birthday with his grown children, his grandchildren, and his twenty-something girlfriend. Eeeeewwww.

The place was not busy on a Saturday night so there was something not quite hitting on all cylinders.  It may be the location, but it also may be the service.  The reception staff and valet were fine; the table service was not.

The specials list was uninspiring and omitted the soup of the day.  We ordered from the main menu.

Our server was unable to describe the preparation for the bacon-wrapped dates and shrimp appetizer.  Instead he tried to explain what a date was, unsuccessfully.  Our appetizer and first course plates were cleared, along with our silverware.  No silverware was brought with the main course.  We asked for silverware and waited as our food cooled.  Finally, no help in sight, we got up and helped ourselves to silverware from the next table.

The menu was all over the place, from hamburgers to high-end steaks to seafood.  Some things lived up to the &#34;Mediterranean&#34; influence advertised, and some did not.  The bacon-wrapped date &amp; shrimp appetizer was really good -- nice crispy smoky bacon contrasted nicely with the sweet dates and shrimp.  It came with a carrot slaw which seemed to be there mostly for color - didn&#39;t really add anything to the flavor of the dish.

The lobster bisque was decent.  The crab cake appetizer, served with pearl cous-cous was average.  It lacked lumps of crab--had that beat up texture we often find, but it was served with a good olive-infused sauce.  My friend enjoyed her salad with fresh parmesan and light vinaigrette dressing.  My main course of lamb loin, garlic rapini and bleu cheese potatoes au gratin was really good.  The lamb was tender, flavorful and perfectly cooked medium rare as requested.  I would have liked more of the sauce to go with it.

Desserts were a predictable run of creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake, cheesecake, etc.  Nothing Mediterranean about it that I could tell, other than one sorbet which our server described as &#34;bloody orange.&#34;

Spinach &amp; Bleu Cheese Salad
Caesar Salad
Crabcakes
Asiago Gnocchi
Flatbreads

A note about the Asiago Gnocchi - it comes with little crispy fried eggplant cubes on top that melt in your mouth like butter.  It is one of the most unique, whimsical, and flavorful gnocchi dishes I have ever had.  

The only thing I wasn&#39;t too thrilled with was the Chocolate Bombe, basically chocolate cake with chocolate mousse on top.  The cake was quite dry and it was cold, as if they just took it out of the freezer for a few minutes to unthaw.  I expect a much better dessert for $9.  

Note: they also have a bar menu that&#39;s worth looking into with $2 sliders served on mini brioche buns (burger, crabcake, tempura sea bass, or bistro steak sliders).

You have the option of wanting to watch sports or just chat with you friends. It was nice because the waiter didn&#39;t even rush us at all.  We ended up being there for 3 hours.  

The house starts you off by bringing out roasted garlic with parmesan and pita triangles that are amazing.  Plan ahead if you are going on a date because you don&#39;t want to have to miss out on the garlic.  My friend wasn&#39;t going to have any but I was able to twist her arm and then she couldn&#39;t stop it was so good. The Pita triangles also come with butter and a roast red pepper dip that was pretty good. 

My friend had ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer and they were great.  Full of crabby  goodness.   I had ordered the caprese salad which was very surprising. I was totally not expecting a two of tomato&#39;s and mozzeralla. The presentation was great. The chef was not shy on the balsamic.  I could have used one more slice of mozzeralla but I am not going to complain.  

Now to our amazing main courses. My friend had got the dinner special which was a seafood risotto which had lobster and shrimp.  It was very taste but very rich. I you are in the mood for a rich dish it is the one for you. Me myself I was torn I couldn&#39;t really decide what I wanted. I was waviering between the steaks and the risotto&#39;s.   Being the foodie that I am I can be alittle pick. So I finally decided on the steak risotto. I figured I could get a little of both.  The dish I got was not at all what I expected. I had assumed that I would get a risotto with small pieces of steak in it. Well that was not what I got. It was a steak with a side of risotto. The steak which was a skirt steak was cooked perfectly.  The risotto was a cream lite side with pearl onions , mushrooms, asparagus and spinach. It was amazing.  I did make a good choice.  

To finish off the evening we closed with an order of the Tirimasu.  It was fabulous. The perfect mix of coffee and Kahlua.

I was politely greeted by the host and when I told her I was meeting with with someone she told me I can have a seat. Exactly where? The only seating was couches that didn&#39;t belong to the restaurant, but more to the building itself (hence it being located outside of the restaurant). 

Anywho as we were were seated for lunch I was at awe at how modern and sophisticated the restaurant was. A great atmosphere with a full bar and private dining rooms for special events.

It was flavorful and light, a great way to end the evening.  My bread pudding was just as good, a great rendition of the traditional dessert.  Great service, attentive without being over the top.

My husband and I wanted to try something off the beaten path that had good food and live music.  CityGate Grille exceeded our expectations by providing exceptional food, great live music, and outstanding service!    We started our meal with a lemon chicken soup that was delicious.  My husband ordered the half chicken that was served over potatoes.  The presentation of the food was awesome and the meal was cooked to perfection.  I ordered the perfect &#34;winter night&#34; dish -  a generous piece of braised beef, a sweet potato, and brussel sprouts cooked with bacon (soooo good).  Every part of the dish was absolutely exquisite.  It was one of the most delicious restaurant meals I have eaten in a long time.  We split the flour less chocolate cake to end our perfect meal and it did not disappoint.  Our server&#39;s name was Chris and he gave wonderful suggestions, was extremely pleasant, and paid very close attention to our needs.  As a matter of fact, the entire wait staff was super attentive.  Our water glasses were always full and our dishes cleared immediately.

It&#39;s located in the same building as an investment firm.  The restrooms are on the lower floor and you can peek into the firm&#39;s cafeteria.  There are a lot of businesses and office parks in the area so it&#39;s a good place to take a client or have a nicer meeting over lunch.

The restaurant has a business type atmosphere but I could also see how in the evening it could turn into a nice steakhouse restaurant.  I ordered a soup and salad and both were served quickly, were reasonably priced and decent tasting.  The food wasn&#39;t particularly outstanding, it was just OK.  The serves know that lunchtime has to be a quick turnaround so it&#39;s impressive that they turn out a decent meal so quickly.

I don&#39;t know what else is in the area but I could see folks coming here for dinner or grabbing a drink in the evening.  Seems like a place for more mature crowds.

We were at the table thirty minutes before they took our drink order, then they brought out incorrect drinks. One hour into experience we had to ask for them to take out entree order.  The food servers had to ask which entrees were supposed to go to the people seated at the table.  

After they brought the wrong entree to one in our party, they then added a $35.00 surcharge called Bad Quality.  When we questioned the manager about it, he was argumentative.

It&#39;s in a not so good location because no one would ever think about going into an area of corporate offices for dinner. So I actually think this makes the restaurant one of the best kept secrets in Naperville.

My mom found a $20 coupon in the Women&#39;s Health magazine (free at banks). I take my parents out to eat every Thursday. That Thursday my mom was giddy (aka drunk) with happiness. $3 mixed drinks on Thu...she had 2 amaretto sours. 

The calamari app was eh. There was something weird about the breading...I can&#39;t put my finger on it. 

However after plates were passed around and every one got a bite of everyone else&#39;s food every one insisted that their own plate was the best and was super awesome. I had the SMOKED SEA BASS with sweet potato &amp; brussel sprout slaw, kalamata jam. I was a little disappointed when it came out and it did not look like it was smoked. I think they just write that on the menu b/c it sounds good? However the presentation was beautiful. The fish was on a cedar plank and the jam was used as garnish around the plate.

We got an appetizer of mushrooms on flatbread which was quite delicious....crisp, buttery. 
Shared a bottle of pinot grigio with my wife and she ordered the gnocchi with caprese and fried eggplant cubes. Was a great dish...quite innovative and done nicely. I had the halibut special with a crabcake on the top, and a rich caper sauce, brocolli rabe, and whipped potatoes. Nicely done.
I have to put a nice note here, as I had a little communication problem with the waiter on the price of the wine specials. I had put it in a previous review, but I received a note from manager and was refunded the money I overpaid for a  wine special.

My wife tried a Halibut special that night and I chose the Skirt Steak Risotto. Her fish was lovely, and was presented as described. As for the risotto, I imagined it to be prepared as written, featuring small pieces of steak scattered throughout.

My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here, from start to finish. Here&#39;s why:

- We had no trouble getting a reservation during &#34;prime time&#34; on a Saturday night. They also honored our reservation request to be seated by the windows but there really isn&#39;t a bad table in the place which is saying a lot considering its size

- The restaurant itself is beautiful. It is spacious and has a lovely upscale feel to it. One wall has tw-story floor to ceiling windows that look out on a corporate pond lined with huge lit evergreen trees and I-88 (which surprisingly gives off a good energy vibe). The view can be enjoyed from any table in the restaurant. The bar looked very nice and it appeared you could eat there, as well.

- The menu had many choices and our food was excellent! Entrees included steaks, seafood, house specialties that included pasta, some Greek dishes, and nightly specials. There even was a black angus burger so really, something for everyone! We both had their salmon with pasta and sweet peas in a lemon-parmesan cream sauce, a special that was both unique and delicious! We also really enjoyed the appetizers that we selected: skirt steak mini-kabobs, as well as bacon wrapped shrimp and goat cheese stuffed dates, each with its own delicious sauce but there were at probably ten to choose from. We&#39;re glad we saved some room for dessert. There were many tempting choices but we selected the key lime tarte and flourless chocolate ganache cake, both made in-house. We loved them both. There were also flatbreads on their menu and excellent salad possibilities which are also offered as half-portions, a nice idea! We saw many of reasons to come back.

- All of the wait staff (but a special shout-out to our waitress Daniela!) was attentive, knowledgeable, and there was never a language barrier issue with anyone who came to our table. It&#39;s clear that they have all been well-trained.

- The manager was also very attentive to the patrons. We found him to be personable and committed to giving us a good experience.

-  This restaurant is not at all noisy. You&#39;ll be able to converse easily with members of your dinner party instead of straining to hear, a common problem in the downtown Naperville restaurants once it gets crowded.

- Parking is a breeze. You can either use their free valet service or park your own car. If you do the parking, you&#39;ll be no more than 75 feet from the door

While CityGate Grille is off the beaten path of the downtown Naperville restaurants, we think that&#39;s one of its positives aspects. We weren&#39;t sure what to expect after Riva left but we walked out saying, &#34;Well done, CityGate Grille!

They had a good crowd in the restaurant and several people in the bar area. We grabbed two seats at the bar, and Katie had dinner while I had a few beers and some apps. Neil, our FAVORITE bartender, was working and took great care of us.

I love sitting in the bar, two large screen tvs behind the bar, good cocktails and cold beer (what else does a man need?). Its comfortable, and the redecoration of the joint looks great!

The tomato soup is FABULOUS, and Katie loved the mussels, salad, and especially the cobbler for dessert.

Great evening, excellent food, and warm/friendly service.

We had early reservations and were seated right away by a friendly hostess.

After drink orders were placed the waiter brought roasted garlic and a bowl of olive oil but no bread...Ummm...It took like ten minutes to get a small basket of pita wedges and super thin parm crackers to our table which also came with some sort of tomato (bland) sauce. They kept pushing drinks on us which I thought was weird until I got my salad. How can you screw up a Caesar salad? Well, you use store bought croutons, skip the anchovies and go light on the shaved parm. Oh, and you barely drizzle dressing on it. Bland and boring. A friend had the spinach salad which looked okay and my hub got the wedge salad with bacon and ranch which he loved. Our entrees were so-so. I had the gnocchi which was really rich and the sauce overwhelmed the dumplings. I ate maybe half. My husband got the steak with risotto which was bland and boring.

our friends came in as we were finishing up, looking for recommendations.  what else could we say but EVERYTHING!?

while everything was delish, my personal faves were the caprese flatbread (big chunks of grape tomates and loaded with fresh mozzerella, but barely braised!  not a melted hunk of goo at all...)...the baked apple crisp dessert was unbelievable and i&#39;m not even really a dessert person...and, i&#39;m a sucker for dates, but dates with chorizo?  wow.

my friend had the sea bass with this amazing sweet potato bake and a weird-sounding but so good brussel sprout slaw?!  yum!!

i feel compelled to say that everyone (except the reviewer who detests truffles) loved the truffle flat bread too.

the service was fabulous, completely attentive but not overbearing.

the prices were fairly reasonable , i&#39;d say, especially given the quality.

i dined at sugar toad last night and while i commend them for their creativity, citygate blows them away.  even citygate&#39;s wine was better - conundrum?  my fave.  half price tuesday nights?  it&#39;s worth a trip to the ville!

the location is a bit odd like everyone said, but given i was staying at hotel arista, i had no complaints.

My daughter was coloring with her crayons and the owner came by and actually asked us if they were our crayons or if HER restaurant had provided them. Should the owner not know such details?

The &#34;pastitio&#34; was spaghetti with meat sauce - and not a very good one. Our server didn&#39;t ask how it was until our plates had been cleared.

My seaweed salad is great.
But the my entree Kung Bao chicken is so bland and the veggies are almost raw. Really not good at all.

The ambiance is very calm, clean, and relaxing. The staff is very nice and attentive. 

They have a great lunch special , $9 for two maki rolls from the basic list, or $11 for three rolls ! That&#39;s an amazing price. However for dinner they bump up the price to $15 for the Maki Combo and it&#39;s three set rolls which are California , Rock n Roll, and shrimp tempura. $15 is still a fairly good price if you average about $6-7 for a roll. I also love how they don&#39;t pack on the rice in the rolls. I hate when places make the rolls so it&#39;s almost all rice!

I&#39;m still leery of these restaurants with &#34;multi-Asian&#34; offerings, though more of them seem to be doing better than a few years back when they tried to be masters of all cuisines and jacks of none.

I went here for lunch and opted for a tekka maki roll as an appetizer and an order of chicken pad thai, medium spicy for my entre. Everything was served in a timely manner and all of the food looked great on the plate. The tekka maki was good; a healthy portion of tuna in each. Then came the pad thai. As lunch portions go for pad thai, it was a little smaller than what I&#39;ve normally seen, but not outrageously so. The noodles were a little different, thinner than normal and there weren&#39;t as many bean sprouts as to what I am accustomed to having. But here was the kicker...  as the waitress, set it down, she stated, &#34;Chicken pad thai, extra spicy&#34;.  YEEEEEEOOOOooooowwww. 

Now of course I knew I could have returned or refused it, but I&#39;ve had hot food before, so I thought I&#39;d just roll with it. Well, it was spicier than &#34;medium&#34; no doubt, but in the scheme of things, it wasn&#39;t all that much hotter.

I was down the road at Good Shepard Hospital and the stomach tape worm was doing flip flops looking to be fed. There were 6 of us looking for something to eat while we waited in the waiting room at the hospital. After looking around the area I found this place and it sounded good as the reviews were good. I drove there and the hostess Maddie took my order and offered some suggestions as well. Once the order was taken I walked over to where the sushi was being prepared and watched in aw as artwork was being created. I watch the chef put together an order on a to-go tray not knowing it was mine, and I wished I ordered what he was preparing.

 I only found out about this little strip mall joint because I literally work a half block away and the owner would drop off menus. I decided to try it one day because they delivered and I love Asian cuisine. To my surprise the food was excellent! I liked it so much I decided to make it the destination for my birthday dinner, they did not disappoint.
 I was greeted by friendly staff and the owner made it a point to personally serve and entertain my group and I for the night. We got a handful of rolls which were each delicious. We also got an order of panang curry chicken which was also great! My favorite rolls of the night were the pink lady, which was full of robust flavor with a bit of spice which made each bite more enjoyable than the next. I also indulged in crazy roll , fresh, fresh , fresh...the succulent fish just melted and it was beyond words. When it came to my birthday desert they turned off all the lights in the restaurant and brought out the beautifully decorated plate of friend bananas, ice cream and a slice of cheese  cake...

The whole experience from start to finish was delightful. I went back again just recently and was greeted by name by the owner (makes you feel right at home) nice personal touch. Again I left happy and full. Yummy Asian bistro is now one of my new favorites, I wish this new restaurant the best of luck!

The staff was very friendly and helpful and we were surprised and delighted by the fresh sushi! We had several rolls plus a plate of nigiri. Our only complaint about the rolls was that in many the fish was chopped up and it was not spicy as the menu indicated. But the flavor was very good and the presentation was beautiful! The nigiri was outstanding, especially the super white tuna!

We also sampled one of the Thai dishes, the Thai Cashew shrimp, along with the coconut fried rice. Amazing flavor!! The Cashew shrimp had large, fresh shrimp that were perfectly cooked in a luscious sauce flavored with Thai basil. The coconut fried rice was a perfect complement, sweet and delicious!

HOLY COW it was amazing and beautiful and friendly and fast and everything I could ever want! First, they completely remodeled, making the interior chic-er than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in the 60021. Second, the sushi was some of the freshest I&#39;ve ever had in land-locked IL. I didn&#39;t see a heli-pad on the roof, but I can&#39;t figure out how else they&#39;re getting such awesomely fresh tuna and salmon. No fishy aftertaste whatsoever. Third, they were SUPER accommodating and friendly when it came to my gluten-free requests. It&#39;s already embarrassing and difficult enough to deal with a food allergy, so when a place makes you feel like you&#39;re imposing by making special requests, it can really ruin a night out. Yummy jumped on my first question about a particular sauce, and immediately suggested several gluten-free options, and ultimately customized a dish for me. I ended up with the veggie, GF, pineapple fried rice, and it was delicious (never would have imagined fried rice with raisins, but now I doubt I&#39;ll happily eat it any other way). I simply can&#39;t wait for my husband to work late one night soon so I can get a whole carton of take-out for myself. I think it will pair divinely with bad Netflix B movies. BUT, that&#39;s not to say I didn&#39;t enjoy eating it in the comfortable, beautifully remodeled restaurant. My husband got General Tao&#39;s chicken and he inhaled it.

The PROS: Food is very fresh, whether you order Sushi, Thai, Chinese, etc. The two owners are acclaimed NY Sushi chefs, and their talents definitely are obvious.  We&#39;ve had several different items, from different cuisines at the restaurant, and there was nothing that we were disappointed with.  CONS:  The pricing is a bit aggressive for Fox River Grove, Ill which is a sleepy Middle Class / Average Income community.  Based on the pricing, it seems to me that this restaurant would be better placed maybe on the North Shore.  We&#39;d like to visit more often, but our family categorizes this restaurant and the kind of place where we&#39;d go to &#34;treat&#34; ourselves, and not the Go-To order-out Chinese food / Sushi place that we&#39;d stop at on any given Wednesday night when I didn&#39;t feel like cooking.",08/08/13,109,3,1,1,-11,0.8042,0.73,0.40099999999999997,7.868,No,897

My wife and I got to the restaurant at about 8:00 on a Saturday night, and there were only about three tables taken.  We were seated immediately and given menus by the hostess.  We looked over the menus...and looked....and looked....and then looked again.  10 minutes passed before I even saw a server in the dining room.  Over the next 15 minutes I made eye contact with the server 4 times, each time motioning him over to our table only to have him disappear back into the kitchen for a few more minutes.  Finally, after waiting for nearly a half an hour without a single person stopping by our table, he finally came by.  No introduction, no apology for taking so long, no water, no specials, no anything.  Just &#34;Are you ready to order?&#34;  At that point we said no and left.  Would have liked to have tried the food, but after waiting for nearly a half hour just to have someone acknowledge that we were even in the restaurant we didn&#39;t want to know how long it would have taken to get our food.  As we walked out, the hostess asked if everything was ok, and we told her that we were leaving cause the server was taking too long.

It&#39;s the perfect amount of food and the little portions (seriously they&#39;re adorable) allow you to try several things in one sitting. #6 includes a delicious swamp (believe it or not, this is a positive review) of cheese and red sauce. In the swamp is a homemade chile relleno, a cheese enchilada, and a bean taco island sitting atop it all. Another favorite here are the sopes. You can make a meal out of two.

The margaritas are some of the best I have ever had.  They even come in their own iced shaker so it&#39;s really like getting two margaritas for the price of one.  Delish!

The service is great - in fact, on my second visit, the waiter who served me and my friend on my first visit recognized me and welcomed me back.  I highly recommend the steak tacos.

Unfortunately suppliers will for whatever reason discontinue an item and such is the case in this instance. 

The biggest problem with this restaurant is that the menu items are just good.  Something on the menu really needs to be at least best in class to make the dining experience memorable. 

The Thanksgiving dinner is a solid four stars. Both beef and turkey are included and an extensive selection of holiday side dishes not normally on the menu is featured.

We were seated before our reservation of 6 PM and our waitress, Stacy, was great. She made a great wine recommendation. Service throughout the evening was not an issue.

We ordered a few starters- blueberry pork belly, tuna tartar, and bacon wrapped dates. The pork and tuna tasted great (although I do prefer avocado with my tartar). The dates, on the other hand, were cold. We altered the waitress and they were comped.

Most everyone enjoyed their entrees. My lamb chops were a smaller portion for the price but tasty. Two entrees were not enjoyed- the whitefish (too oily) and the NY Strip was very fatty. 

Pieces of cake with candles were brought out for all the birthdays and it was delicious!

Bottom line: 2 out of 6 entrees being poor is ridiculous for the price we paid for this dinner. The prices here are asinine and the food did not meet the expectations of the price point.

We arrived around 11 am and it wasn&#39;t terribly busy. I wouldn&#39;t agree with other yelpers (it wasn&#39;t empty), but it was probably about 50% full. Maybe I look at the glass half full, not half empty.

Anyway, we sat down and someone came over relatively quickly (within minutes) and took our drink order. Coffee for me, orange juice for him. They should really upgrade their coffee cups. 3 sips in, I was nearly done with my coffee. 

She returned in a few minutes and took our food order. We received beignets and fruit prior to our meal and enjoyed them. Then waited for our food. And waited some more..and some more. About twenty minutes later, our waitress came back to our table and told us she had lost our order, and never turned it in. Um...ok. Just as we were telling her our order again, she reached in her pocket and said &#34;oh, here it is! Never mind!&#34; and rushed off. So we then waited for our food some more.

My french toast was good, and a very large portion as well. 3 full pieces of toast plus 4 pieces of bacon and a spattering of breakfast potatoes. My husband enjoyed his meal as well. He had the blueberry pancakes.

Another star taken away for drinks. I drank all my coffee and all my water and had to flag our waitress down for refills. There was someone walking around filling up water and coffee, but it seemed like he would just walk through the restaurant, then disappear.

Our waitress did apologize for the service, and comped our drinks (saving us a whopping $5). I&#39;ll take it, I guess.

wildwood-geneva,Miles F.,6uVTPlrUF38WclfNzNEmlw,Yyt094nTAfwgx-l59TuRpA,"My family and I went there to hear some music on Friday night.   There are several reasons from start to finish why this place will not get my business again and why I think others should be weary of going there also. 

-The server said we could not push tables together even though we had planned on ordering food and staying all night to drink and listen to music- while just twenty feet away there were two tables pushed together by people (who appeared to regulars) and who had taken extra chairs from other tables. 

-When we asked the server if we could grab some chairs from the bar that weren&#39;t being used she said no that&#39;s not allowed.  However ten minutes later the owner/manager (I&#39;m not sure what his role was) who had been sitting at the bar drinking got up and brought his chair over to a table of women that had come in and were short one stool.

-I ordered a Manhattan on the rocks and when the server brought it out it was served up. I wouldn&#39;t have asked for another except that she didn&#39;t seem to know what my look was for or that the drink was not how I ordered it.  I do not feel bad for her messing up though because it was a major deal that her tablet that she took orders on be working right which in the beginning caused a five minute delay.   She then took the drink back to the bar and tried to figure out what &#34;on the rocks&#34; meant from the bar tender... And instead of remaking it he simply poured the shaken drink over ice. For a place that appears to be high end and prices accordingly that was a pretty cheap move on their part (keep in mind the &#34;owner/manager&#34; was within earshot of the entire event).

I could keep going and analyzing every detail of the night that left a bad taste in my mouth about this place but to keep it to the point the place is over priced, service is a joke (along with management) and the food selection is not what a successful bar needs.",31/01/16,190,1,1,0,-40,-0.8041,0.22699999999999998,0.42299999999999993,10.350999999999999,No,1936

wildwood-geneva,Ruth T.,EV4BW8JcRPemPy-6ksvpfw,H3Lrw1dj9sbWXYhW6-cvXA,Went here with friends on a Friday night.  No line and MANY open tables. We had a large lunch so wanted a lighter dinner.  We ordered 5 appetizers between the four of us plus a soup.  The waitress told us we weren&#39;t allowed to just order appetizers.  In what country!!!????   She said she would let it go but in the future we had to order dinners.  Wow.  Wow.  And more wow.   We stayed for about an hour and were given the &#34;eye&#34; to leave.

We were seated at our table for nearly 10 minutes before our server greeted us.  He took our drink order and our wine arrived 20 minutes later.  He said he&#39;d bring bread with Parmesan cheese.  The bread arrived, but no cheese.  So we had to ask for that.  My salad did not have any dressing, but my husband&#39;s did.  When I mentioned this to our server, he asked &#34;are you sure?&#34; I said yes and then he questioned me again.  The crab cakes were good, but on the small side. 

We both ordered the fish and we were both disappointed. Our meals arrived without the baked potatoes that we ordered.  We had to ask for those. Then when they did arrive, we had to ask for the sour cream and chives.  I asked our server if they were short staffed this evening and he told us that he had been there since 9:30 a.m. and that three of their employees had participated in an iron man competition. I guess that was supposed to justify the poor service.

We watched a couple who was seated near us get up and leave after 10 minutes because the server never came to their table. 

Our water glasses were never refilled until right before we left. After we finished our appetizer, salad and even our entrees, no one came to remove the plates.  We began stacking them on the other side of the table so they would not be in front of us. 

The poor service and below-average meal do not match up to the prices on the menu.  

I hope the owner is able to make some positive changes to this restaurant.  When we left, we saw that Fiora&#39;s across the street was packed while Wildwood was not.",22/05/16,182,2,1,0,-44,-0.2098,1.1179999999999999,1.377,21.505000000000003,No,1759

It was my first time coming here, so I scoped out an option for ahi tuna over a strawberry salad for lunch, $16.  I had a server by the name of Michelle who first told me this wasn&#39;t a lunch option.  More than once.  I showed her the menu and subsequently she told me she normally doesn&#39;t work lunch and wasn&#39;t familiar with the menu. (What?)  Anyways, I asked for the tuna rare, I double checked this was indeed an option, which she said yes it was.  The food came out quick, and the tuna was cooked well through, far from rare. When she came out and I showed her this, she blamed the cook and kept saying, I rang it in right and talked to the cook. And now she informed me they grill it.  Which would have been fine, if it wasn&#39;t overcooked. Doesn&#39;t fix my non pink fish lol.

My wife and I walk past it every weekend on our way to Nosh is Geneva, and we always think about going in for brunch. Well today we pulled the trigger and I wish I could take that decision back. We got there at 1045 and were seated immediately; no surprise as there were only 4 tables with guests. We did not have anyone take a drink order until 11. We had two waitresses come by and tell us they would be with us in a few minutes, but a different one ended up taking our order. 
Drinks took about 10 minutes (orange and grapefruit juice) to arrive. We placed our order at this point and then waited 40 freaking minutes for our food to arrive. As we were sitting there I told my wife that I guarantee our food is just sitting in the window, as I had not seen our waitress since we placed the order. Sure enough, the food arrived and it was cold. Not warm....cold. When the waitress came by 20 minutes later she asked how everything was. I said &#34;meh, cold&#34; and then shrugged. Her response was &#34;oh, fantastic&#34;, and then she walked away. 
I had the steak and eggs. Steak was over salted and poached eggs were overcooked. My wife had green eggs and ham. Again, eggs were overcooked. Did I mention everything was cold? You know what does not taste good when they are cold? Poached eggs, potatoes, steak, zucchini, an english muffin, ham, spinach, and hollandaise sauce. Actually, all those things really suck when they are cold. You know what also sucks? Waitresses that don&#39;t care when you tell them your meal was cold and don&#39;t actually listen to your response when they ask you how everything is.

We got our drinks at 8:20 and appetizer at 8:30. I had to ask the server to take the rest of our order before she left from dropping off the appetizer. She stated that she was going to be right back, but did take the order. Then finally had bread brought to us at 8:40. We received our salads timely after the appetizer at 8:45.

The prime rib was flavorless and cold, the ham was dried out and the buffet options were limited considering the cost per person!  

On the dessert table, the cheese cake was warm and completely mushy.  Their homemade truffles tasted as they had freezer burn and the remaining desserts as my wife says, are are not worth putting on one&#39;s bum since flavor and freshness were lacking big time.

Don&#39;t expect a meaningful dinner. We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary. My husband surprised me by making reservations and having a beautiful flower arrangement delivered to Wildwood for our table. When we arrived, we were taken to a very nice table and the flowers were on the table but they were still in the box as they had been delivered ... what would it have taken to remove them from the box and set on the table! We then sat there for at least 30 minutes with no one welcoming us or asking if we would like to order a drink, appetizer, meal, etc.  My husband finally flagged down a server nearby and she apologized and said she would send our server over as soon as possible. We probably sat there for another 15 min., when our server finally came over and informed us that we would have to wait because she was too busy. She later informed us that she would not be able to wait on us at all. Really????  The original server that we had flagged down returned to see if we had been waited on yet. When we told her what happened, she was kind enough to wait on our table, but of course she had her own tables to wait on. She was very courteous and helpful and the food was good, but not our typical experience at Wildwood, which we had frequented several times a year. Towards the end of our dinner, the manager made his way around the tables making polite conversation with the diners.

wildwood-geneva,Anne L.,lRF6H_LcK8vKvi-hQjve8g,4-W6FytxZ_pbxH6X62xZjQ,"Wildwood actually a very extensive wine and beer list, which is what led me there three weeks in a row.  My date and I sat in the lounge each time and enjoyed a bottle of wine and/or cocktails. 

I&#39;ve never dined there, because, I&#39;ve had three employees (two servers and 1 sous chef) tell me that that get their steaks from Gordon Food Service, and I&#39;m not paying $50 for a GFS steak. That aside, I was still interested in their wine list.  

The bartender was friendly, but was awkward opening bottles and when I ordered one of their signature cocktails, she had to pull out the recipe book.  Ok.  Fine. Still not upset. Still just a little comical.  

The first two visits were fine.  The third week we went, we arrived just before 9:00 on a Tuesday and, like before, we just wanted some wine and we would be gone promptly.  We ordered a bottle and the bartender said the manager would get it in just a moment.  Then, while we were waiting she told us that it was getting late (9:00, they are still open) and she communicated she won&#39;t be serving anyone else for the next 30-40 min until closing. Bit of miscommunication, at best, because then the manager shows up with our bottle and they are debating whether or not they should sell us the wine. She says no. He said yes. And now I&#39;m ticked. I&#39;m sitting right there. I can hear them. 

I said we would wouldn&#39;t waste their time and be out and now I have a bartender who clearly doesn&#39;t want to be bothered with us. This is my issue. And the manager had no spine whatsoever. He had an empty dining room at 8:45 on a Tuesday and he&#39;s ok with letting his bartender be lazy and run her mouth the one of the only bar guests in the lounge? Not smart. 

So, there is not a thing they could offer me to come back. Ever. I got the usual corporate apologetic phrases, but they really are meaningless. Please...don&#39;t waste my time. There really are other places in the Geneva/STC area with fun wine lists that actually welcome your business.

If you&#39;re looking for new suburban steak house options you may want to think twice about Wildwood.

Usually if we&#39;re in the mood for a steakhouse night, we&#39;d pick Ruths Chris, Capital Grille, Gibsons, Sullivans, etc. but we were going to be in Geneva so we thought Wildwood would fit our needs.  

Upon arriving, a red flag went up immediately as there was maybe four or five tables occupied in the main dining room.  It was only 6PM on a Friday and I know it&#39;d pick up later, but you could have shot a cannon through there...and by the time we left, it was maybe half full.  Our server was nice and prompt, but not very polished for a place this $$$$.  The bar was hoppin&#39; though!

I will spare going through course by course, and cut to the chase - the food did not match the prices.  Period.  This, in my opinion seems like a faux &#34;steakhouse&#34; that happens to have steak on the menu.  And the steak?  Ribeyes and filets were simply grilled with zero seasoning...and a jus poured over the top that was strangely gelatinous.  I&#39;m not a picky dude and NEVER send food back, but I seriously contemplated it.  Almost reminded me of wedding reception steak.  Escargot was decent, chorizo dates a waste of time.  Didn&#39;t stay for dessert.  I got the bill and just shook my head at what we received for a huge tally.  

This isn&#39;t just an angry bitch session, but I am just more amazed in the lack of quality for a huge price tag.  I do hope they turn it around, because it has tons of potential.  Robert Irvine or Gordon Ramsay  would have a field day. ; )

I wanted to try a new restaurant in downtown Geneva with my wife and ended up here.  What I got was the worst food and service I have had in a long time. First the waiter, per the receipt was Bob, has a smug arrogance to him when we would ask any questions regarding the menu and wine list.   First we got bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo.  They came out cold and were bathed in a BBQ sauce that tasted like it came from Aldi.  Next there were salads. My caesar salad lacked any flavor whatsoever (even the croutons were shitty) and my wife&#39;s wedge salad has a total of two tomatoes on it. My dinner was Prime Rib.  Ordered it medium and it came out completely cooked through with a grey color to it.  It tasted like it has been warmed up, cooled off everyday for the last week.  Absolutely disgusting.

But I felt the urge to about Wildwood based on the cost and the food not matching up. This was my first time at Wildwood, my husband and I got a gift card this past Christmas for $50 so we thought we would give it a go! The reviews are very mixed so I was skeptical but being we had the gift card and it needed to be used we choose to go on our once a month (if that) date night. The decor and ambiance of this place is really pretty. The outside seating was really nice because we just love hanging out outside whenever possible. I would say looking and feel....yes this would be a $$$ restaurant. The only problem is, the food =/ This is why I HAD to make a review. My opinion is that if you are wanting to go out for a nice dinner knowing you will spend over $100 dollars easily for two people then sadly, this is NOT your place. We ordered the fondue appetizer and that was pretty tasty. It was basically bread dug out, filled with cheese and seafood that you dipped crouton like squares into. It was good, I will admit we enjoyed that. However, our main dishes were less then satisfying. My husband ordered a chicken stuffed dish and the chicken was pretty dry. This upset me even more because if you look through other reviews others have complained about the same thing! How can a restaurant do this on a regular basis and charge what it does for their meals??? I ordered the Fillet Mignon and was very very disappointed! If I am paying $40 plus just for a steak I want my knife to slide through it. I don&#39;t want to cut through it like I do a steak I just bought from the grocery store down the street. Not only that, they have chosen to put the steak over a gravy type thing and my $50 dollar meal tasted like pot roast right out of the crock pot =/ I could not believe it! Homeade pot roast for $50?. This is a three money signs restaurant with a two dollar money sign quality at most! I have honestly had better steak at Applebees. I just get really upset with places like this. Just because you dress up your place to look the part, you have to back it up with proof that my money is being well spent and Wildwood you sorely disappointed us. 
 
Our total bill with tip was about $130 with tip. Of course we were lucky enough to have the $50 gift card but I would have to say this meal wasn&#39;t even worth the $80 of our own money.

We dined early and were among the first to be seated.  Rachel was our server and did a wonderful job throughout.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list.  We all ordered a fish dish, two from their special lenten menu.  We mixed it up, asking that one of the dished be prepared other than their suggested way.  There was no issue in doing that and while we didn&#39;t ask for lots of changes, they appeared to be very flexible.  Rachel told us about the wine special and when there was hesitation she offered or a taste.  A pleasant Chardonnay which one of our party ordered and enjoyed.  The fish was wonderful, the swordfish was done through, which is my preference, but
was not overdone.  Just right.  The other fish was equally well done.  We had a lovely dinner.  Everyone was friendly .  We entered through the bar which is definitely a

The clock was ticking, the shops were bustling and after losing serious track of time my shopping cohort and I fell into Wildwood not even glancing at their hours. The hostess looked at the clock and told us that the doors were closing in T minus 1 minute and we could squeeze ourselves in for brunch. Note to you, for Sunday Brunch, the hours are cut a little short so beware of when to stop by.

The dining room is massive and can hold small to large groups. A gargantuan fireplace chunks out the space and provides an invitingly warm, dim and relaxing setting. We were seated toward the back of the room but were able to see the open kitchen area and the chefs hard at work.

Upon being seated, we were greeted with a fresh bowl of fruit and a sort of blintz (? some kind of fried dough). The fruit I assume is seasonal, can&#39;t speak for the dough as I like to avoid those kind of treats but it was a nice touch. For brunch, my eating/shopping cohort ordered the Grand Marnier French Toast I ordered the Chicken Salad Croissant sandwich.

The real winner was the scent of the maple syrup for the toast. As it rested on the tabletop, it thickened up. The chicken salad was a standard, easy prep sandwich served with shoestring fries. 

The prices for brunch are reasonable, the service was on par despite us being one of the last diners in the room who also skid into the last minute brunch. I&#39;d like to see how the restaurant is during an evening and try another sampling.

A big bonus, if you&#39;re a culinary fanatic, cooking classes hosted by the head chef ($50 per course) are offered in addition to the menu. Class schedules are at the front door by the hostess&#39; station.",29/11/10,212,4,1,4,-31,3.9148,2.013,0.456,15.530000000000001,No,1823

The food took forever to come out and it was simultaneously overcooked and cold. One of the dishes was completely wrong, and when we told our server this she did not apologize but instead stood at the table for 20 seconds looking at what she had written down (hint: you take it away immediately and resolve the problem). 

Once she brought the correct entree, she said the kitchen screwed up. The owner came over ten seconds after she left and apologized, saying the server put the wrong order in. After the owner left we discovered that this dish was also cold, but could not flag down the server for another ten minutes. We were finally able to tell her that while the dish was edible, we would prefer that it would be heated up. 

The server left for another ten minutes (we assumed she would perhaps bring out another dish), when she came back without a dish we complained about the temperature again and she said &#34;well you said it was edible, I thought you were going to eat it.&#34; We told her to heat it up, and the manager came over. After relating him our grievances, he said &#34;well it&#39;s Christmas Eve, so it&#39;s all hands on deck. Please come back and try us out again.&#34; (note: this is not an acceptable explanation, if you cannot handle the traffic, you reduce the amount of tables you book). 

The correct dish finally arrived at the correct temperature but of course the rest of the party was finished with their respective meals. When it took an inordinate amount of time to get the check we assumed the manager was going to do the right thing and comp some or all of the meal. Alas, this was not the case and we against our better judgment paid the bill in full with a commensurately modest tip. 

The restaurant itself is strangely designed - entering on Third Street places you in a bar area and you have to cut cross the entire dining area to reach the hostess station. The decor is tasteful if bland - you would expect a tad more sophistication if you are dropping at least $50 a head, but this would hardly be a sticking point if the food and service would&#39;ve been on point. The menu is standard American, nothing interesting or particularly enticing. 

In conclusion, all we were offered was contradictory excuses for poor execution at an exorbitant price on what was supposed to be a special night for my family.

I settled on a medium-rare 16-oz prime rib with horseradish butter, a side of parmesan au gratin potatoes, and a bottle of Chimay Bleue. My date went for a medium 6-oz fillet mignon with the same side and a raspberry cocktail. In both cases the meat was unbelievably tender and moist, and we both loved the potatoes.

The Long:  My major complaint about this place is that there were like 20 servers (or what appeared to be servers) running around trying to get stuff done and ours didn&#39;t seem to care much about our experience.

Our server did the minimum she needed to do... took our order and brought us our food.  Beyond that we never saw her because she was too busy folding silverware in napkins.  She never asked us how we were doing.  She never asked if we wanted drink refills.

In fact, I walked up to the bar to get my own refills.  Cause it sucks to eat food that is a little spicy without anything to wash it down.

We started off with the pretzels.  Which, they give a ton of pretzels.  And, was totally worth the $9 we spent on them.  The cheese sauce wasn&#39;t bad... but didn&#39;t really stand out, in my opinion.

I got the Mac and Cheese with Chili.  It was weird, because when I ordered that I pictured something totally different than what I got.  I imagined the chili to have a lot of meat.  There was not much meat at all. There was like a tablespoon of meat, tons of beans and a fair amount of tomatoes. The portion size seemed fair.

My wife got the Cuban Panini and said it was pretty good, but the fries had no flavor at all.

I really was in the mood to try someplace new.  I wanted to enjoy my experience.  I know sometimes people go into a situation not being 100% into the idea.  I was and am a little upset that a server and mediocre food ruined it for me.  I hope to go back and see if it was just an off night.",23/07/15,200,2,1,1,-6,0.08760000000000018,2.549,1.729,23.722,No,1770
bulldog-ale-house-north-aurora,Caroline M.,CnUzhHxPuJCP_5z2p7gcRg,yIq04I589DNp8R4UqIge2g,"My husband, friend and I went here last night for dinner and we were pleasantly surprised. We waited in the front and were offered beer samples, a grapefruit ale that was just delicious.

We were seated after about 15 minutes and were brought to a high pub table. The table was fine, but the chairs don&#39;t appear to be built for anyone with junk in the trunk. Seriously if you have even a slightly not flat butt, you will feel like you are falling out of this chair. 

Our waitress was friendly and professional. I can&#39;t remember her name, but she was great. She seemed to be rushing around and brought our drinks out not all at the same time. My iced tea first, then their lemonade and beers. I would&#39;ve thought they would come out at once, or at least the nonalcoholic options first then the beer. Whatever. So domestic drafts and their house ales are on special for $3 on Saturdays which is a really nice special.

Other Saturday specials include $3 Absolut mixers, $4 jaeger shots, $5 jaeger bombs, $5 individual pizza, $6.99 for customize your own burger. Which is exactly what we all ended up doing. I had a chicken sandwich with pepper jack, avocado, bacon, tomato and chipotle mayo. All those toppings were included. Up to 5 toppings, even off their &#34;premium list&#34;. They had a lot of great specials for the entire week. My sandwich was delicious and my husband swears that his chicken sandwich was the best he has ever had. My friend ordered the veggie burger. Neither the waitress nor the general manager knew what brand of veggie burgers they were. Frozen, boxed burgers. That&#39;s really all you need to know. So basically, a morningstar chipotle black bean burger, which is what everyone has. My friend seemed to enjoy it, nonetheless.

My only complaint was that it was very, very loud inside. So loud that we could not hear each other while talking at the table. Between the TVs, music and everyone talking we had to shout to hear each other. I could barely hear the person next to me without shouting and I definitely could not hear my husband across the table without leaning and shouting. Not great for conversation at all. Otherwise, great place. We will return.",19/07/15,247,4,1,5,-30,5.831799999999999,4.269,0.8109999999999999,26.921000000000003,No,2200

I ordered the &#34;Housemade&#34; Pretzels for $10.00 and what I got were the same SuperPretzels that I bought at Walmart!

The environment: Yes, it&#39;s very loud. It&#39;s the style of a typical sports bar, crowded, loud, lots of TVs, etc. Kind of difficult to have a conversation, seems like a better place to meet for drinks than for dinner.

The service: sllloooowwww. I genuinely felt bad for the bartender, she was so busy, people constantly grabbing her attention, she never had a minute to stop. But because of it, many of the bar customers weren&#39;t getting the attention we were all waiting for. Another girl and 2 guys were in and out of the bar area trying to help but it seemed unorganized and not like a team-effort.

The food: just okay. We each had bacon burgers. They were neither juicy nor flavorful. They were extremely messy. We both ordered them &#34;medium&#34; and one was overcooked. Had parmesan garlic wings to start -- flavor was good, wings were soft not crispy (people have different preferences, I prefer crispy).

FYI: They have coupons online. Good ones! We printed them and were intending to use them but it took sooooooo long to get our check we completely forgot to use them because we were so focused on tracking down someone, anyone, to get our check and help us pay so we could leave. It just took too long.

They do have really great specials each day, including dollar burgers, half price pizzas, and drink specials. Maybe that&#39;s why they&#39;re so busy?",21/07/15,178,3,2,3,16,2.5745999999999998,2.957,0.9930000000000001,17.051000000000002,No,1480
bulldog-ale-house-north-aurora,J H.,#NAME?,eIWtBozN5OHAGLhpf5imNg,"This was a solidly average experience.   

Ordered the appetizer platter. It was average. Essentially frozen items that had been cooked. Daughter commented that the mozzarella sticks were &#34;typical&#34;. Pretzels were like the ones you can buy in the frozen food section of any large grocer - although cheese sauce was good. Husband said wings were good. All in all - typical bar food.

Husband ordered the burger and commented it had a nice grilled flavor. Good that it was a Saturday special . When we asked about fries, we were informed they were frozen so ordered the homemade coleslaw instead - which was ok.

Daughters fried mac and cheese was clearly another item that was frozen and then cooked there. 

My caprese flatbread was ok - edges were crisp and inside was softer. It was ok. 

Bulldog wheat beer was good - had a citrus undertone and 5$ chocolate martini was enjoyable. 

Finished the night with baked chocolate chip cookie which was sweet - as dessert should be. 

All in all - it&#39;s typical bar food. Not a gastro pub but edible ( as long as you enjoy items purchased frozen).

Decor is nice . Place is clean. Server was attentive and nice.  It is noisy.

The noise level  prohibits any conversation. The food is prepared in a deep fryer or microwave oven. The waitress thinks it&#39;s timely to serve the appetizer the same time the meal is served.

Jocelyn and the rest of the wait staff were very friendly, fast and accommodating. For beer lovers, the selection is huge, so you definitely won&#39;t go thirsty. I tried the Bulldog Sunset Wheat. It was fruity and light. A 32 oz. mug was only $4.00! My only gripe is that it could have been served a little colder.

We started with the soft pretzel and queso appetizer. The pretzels were a warm salty delight and the queso was spicy, but not too spicy for kids. Three of us had burgers and one had the Reuben. We were all pleased with our choices. All burgers were served on a pretzel bun, which was a perfect complement to the juicy, meaty burgers. I ordered mine medium well, but I think I&#39;ll go medium next time, since mine seemed slightly over cooked. My Ale House burger was supposed to include onion straws, but I was served raw onions instead. No complaints here, as I love raw onions.

My only other criticism is that the A/C needed to be cranked up. The temps outside were around 80 and it was just slightly cooler in the restaurant.

We will most definitely be back. Welcome to the neighborhood!",07/06/15,143,4,2,4,16,3.9858999999999996,2.87,0.569,16.561,No,1210

However, we won&#39;t be going back if we are hungry. We were disgusted in their stated practice of nickel and diming customers to make a buck. 

The customer next to us ordered 10 spicy chicken wings. He said they were good but when he asked for another tiny cup of the watered down blue cheese he was told it would cost a quarter. A quarter for blue cheese when you order chicken wings? They should either give you a bigger than tiny plastic cup or just give you extra when you want it. Oh yeah, celery was also another quarter after the one piece that came on the plate. That is inexcusable.

My wife ordered the grilled four-cheese sandwich. It was so dry that she asked for some mayo to moisten it up with. That also cost a quarter for, again, a tiny little plastic cup of mayo? Sorry but you are not going to go broke giving mayo to your customers for free. You buy it by the gallon for maybe $10. That is the cost of doing business not the cost you pass on to your customers.

Last time I went was about a month ago for a going away party for my coworkers. There were about 18 to 20 of us and we were the only people in the bar because it was a weird time of day. We had a server who was blonde, had a man bun, muscles and a lil scruff. I was actually excited to get a male server because every single female server I had here was horrible. 

He comes and takes our orders and 6 of us towards the end of the table wanted beers. We ordered beers and he left the table. He comes back 15 minutes later and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. We told him that we ordered beer. He said oh yeah and laughed.  15 minutes later he came back empty handed to our side of the table and asked us if we were ordering food. We said maybe but where are the beers? He laughed again.

Last time I went was about a month ago for a going away party for my coworkers. There were about 18 to 20 of us and we were the only people in the bar because it was a weird time of day. We had a server who was blonde, had a man bun, muscles and a lil scruff. I was actually excited to get a male server because every single female server I had here was horrible. 

He comes and takes our orders and 6 of us towards the end of the table wanted beers. We ordered beers and he left the table. He comes back 15 minutes later and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. We told him that we ordered beer. He said oh yeah and laughed.  15 minutes later he came back empty handed to our side of the table and asked us if we were ordering food. We said maybe but where are the beers? He laughed again.  

I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say it took me over 30 minutes to get a beer.  And we were sitting 10 feet from the bar! I wanted to jump over and pour it myself. 

Needless to say only a quarter of the 20 person table left him a tip because that&#39;s how much it sucked.  I asked my coworkers how their experience was down at the other end and they said it was the same as mine.

The service, management, training, food quality on beer/food along with a management crew that has no sense of urgency made for a very disappointing first visit.

However heres an example of what went wrong with the Bloody Mary special: $5 Bloody Mary specials on Subday...great, but the cheese &amp; pepperoni spear tasted like it was prepped a day before &amp; just had a stale taste that didn&#39;t go well with what could have been a good Blood Mary &amp; all the other fixins&#39;. Like other people on Yelp, I had to go to the bar to get a beer &amp; gave up after the bartender seemed too busy with side chatter &amp; 6 low maintenance beer drinkers. Next came the service at the table, attentive on the wrong things, inexperienced hadn&#39;t tried much of the items to tell us about the food. Ordered some flatbread. It was flat, floppy, kinda gross. I&#39;d never order it again. Got the wings. They were more like sad fowl nuggets &amp; tasted old &amp; frozen like a freezer that hasn&#39;t been cleaned out in a while. I noticed one male manager sitting off to the side ALOT when clearly the bartender needed help, the server needed help answering questions and well...there was plenty of idle servers doing not much of anything.

So after being told to wait 15 minutes for a table, we decided to quickly order our food.  I ordered the PoBoy Shrimp Sandwich with Fries and my husband ordered the Cuban sandwich with Fries.  He also ordered a side of honey mustard for his fries.  Needless to say, they charge you a quarter for dime size of honey mustard.  RIDICULOUS!!!

Overall experience, the place is nice and the food was not bad.  My husband and I did enjoy our sandwiches, however, the fries were stale and not tasty at all.

Seconds in the microwaves and forgot to check to see if they were warm kinda cold, THENNNN our 10 boneless wings arrived when the young took our pretzels back and the wings had very very light sauce on them. I&#39;ve personally worked in this industry for many years up and through college and that was very poor preparation of wings with literally a light poor of Sauce, needless to say I was not impress for the first time here.

So after being told to wait 15 minutes for a table, we decided to quickly order our food.  I ordered the PoBoy Shrimp Sandwich with Fries and my husband ordered the Cuban sandwich with Fries.  He also ordered a side of honey mustard for his fries.  Needless to say, they charge you a quarter for dime size of honey mustard.  RIDICULOUS!!!  Anyways, he didn&#39;t even get to enjoy the honey mustard with his fries because they brought it 10 minutes after the food was brought to us.  
Overall experience, the place is nice and the food was not bad.  My husband and I did enjoy our sandwiches, however, the fries were stale and not tasty at all.

Time of my visit: Lunch

Well, I think, I have reviewed all, but one place in that strip.  I could not decide on what I wanted to have, so I figured I would go for a burger.

Well, I arrived, I was told to sit anywhere and the waitress came by promptly.  I have asked about the special and her recommendations.  She told me the burger were pretty good, especially chicken burger, any other day, I would have opted for that, but I had chicken yesterday and was not in the mood for it.  So ended up ordering Hawaiian Burger (it came with a pineapple on top and a side of BBQ sauce), I was sold.  I took homemade chips instead of fries.

Both my water and food arrived quickly.  Let me breakdown the chips first...  They were pretty good!  There were not stale (which is a case with a lot of place), nor oily (again a case with a lot of place), pretty good!  Now, on to the burger...  Oh boy...  Disappointing...  First, a piece of advise, when you offer pineapple on a burger, ring form is usually better than chopped...  Second, I get it&#39;s pricey to keep fresh pineapples in stock, but I can tell a difference between a shitty canned pineapple (which it was) vs. fresh pineapple...  The pineapple took away from the taste of the burger, which was not all that bad.  It was not anything over the top, but about what you&#39;d accept from a bar burger.

The service was a bit inadequate as well, but friendly.  Barkeep was nice and either had a lot on her plate with the bar or was just short staffed, never had my water refilled, until I asked for a refill with my check.  I ended up going up to the bar to pay my check.

Overall a C-, could have been worse, chips and barkeep friendliness kept it from falling further down.",21/10/16,212,3,1,5,-14,4.855700000000001,2.476,0.55,12.974000000000002,No,1760

We walked in around 7:30 pm and there was maybe only about 5 people there. We sat at the bar and started looking at the drink menu. We were greeted almost immediately and since we weren&#39;t sure what we were having we asked for water. Bartender brings us the first and only waters of the night. Never refilled them, never asked if we wanted more, she just took our waters away after we finished. 
It was nice to see they have a variety of drinks and drink specials. My friend got the $3 Coronas and I had the $4 margarita, frozen. My rita didnt smell nor taste like one. I kept hoping it would get better so I ordered a total of 3. I really think the bartender made them virgin, no alcohol. 
The place was not busy but the bartender ignored us most of the time we were there. After we were done with drinks, rather than ask if we want another, she looked our way and went about her business, eating at the end of the bar! 
Not sure if the poor service was due to the fact that we aren&#39;t regulars, everyone else was waited on except us. A group of guys came in later and their beers were still kind of full and she was asking them if they were ready for another. My glass was completely empty, I pushed it away from me, she saw but didnt ask if I wanted another drink until like 10 min later. 
I will give them one more chance in the future and see if the service is better and I will NOT get the margaritas. The bar itself is ok, like that there is outdoor seating and its close to home. I  curious about the fruity drinks on the menu.

We had a coupon so even though it was kind of a drive for us we wanted to give it a try. (And we saw they have fried pickles on the menu and we are big fans of fried pickles!) We went on a Wednesday night around 6:15. (It got a lot more crowded at 7:00 and on). 

This is a really cute place with a thatched hut bar and a beach-y wall mural. The bar is big and many people sat at it and ate and drank. They have high tables and low/regular tables. 

We were treated GREAT by Dion. She gave us excellent service and was down to earth and positive. We loved that they bring you free popcorn- that&#39;s a fun touch. 

The fried pickles were good- pickle chips- and a generous portion served with a side of ranch.

I ordered the bottomless soup and salad- it&#39;s $8.99. The salad came in a huge bowl and was way too much for me but very tasty- iceberg lettuce, carrots, radishes, green olives, hot peppers, and a delicious oil and vinegar dressing. I appreciated that it didn&#39;t have cheese on it. You can order any of their soups or chili and I was hoping to try several but the servings were so huge that I only tried two. I LOVED the chicken rice soup- it was creamy and comforting and tasted just as I hoped. I wish I lived or worked closer so I could order it regularly. I also tried the minestrone which Dion said is a favorite- it was also good but I was really too full to eat much of it. I think next time I&#39;ll see if the soup could be served in cups rather than bowls- then I could try their chicken noodle soup or chili too. The soups were impressive to me (although probably not what most people think of ordering at a place like this- I encourage you to try them!) 

My husband got a burger and thought it was pretty good but a little dry. The fries were on the thick side but he thought they were good. Next time he wants to try a wrap and the spicy chicken soup. 

They have a funnel cake fry dessert which sounded clever but we didn&#39;t try it. 

They seem to have a lot of food and drink specials here and also a lot of events. I bet this is a popular place for locals. I didn&#39;t feel like I was eating in a bar- rather a casual restaurant with great food. 

I have to say that I was struck with how clean the bathroom was! Spotless. 

I think there is a jukebox thing on the wall by the bar- I didn&#39;t try it but it&#39;s a cool addition. 

I was surprised to see that they had &#34;live video gaming&#34; in the restaurant- that kind of bummed me out as we left- seeing the gambling machines. I&#39;m a therapist so sometimes have strong opinions about things that I&#39;ve seen people struggle with. So I guess that&#39;s why I took one star off (and that my husband didn&#39;t love his burger).

Some nights they are so busy that unfortunately it takes awhile for your order to be taken, but the servers at least acknowledge your presence.  

The boyfriend and I go here a lot for the hawks games, and they make the night very enjoyable with ALL the t.vs including the larger projector screen with the game on, and the audio.

The first time I went with two friends on a Thursday evening and it was a great time.  Other than us, there were only about 4 or 5 other people there, all sitting up at the bar.  Our service was very quick and the waitress was very friendly and attentive.

After having such a good first experience, I took my girlfriend there.  It was the Friday before St. Patrick&#39;s Day, so we were expecting it to be pretty busy, simply because they do sell booze.  When we got there, it was filled with a lot of bigger parties, but we managed to find the last two-top open, near the entrance.  It took about 15 minutes before anyone came up to acknowledge us.  Once our waitress took the drink order, she was very fast at coming back with it, so that was nice.  But then, it was about another 20-30 minutes before anyone else walked past our table.  I had finished my beer in that time, so I actually walked up to the bar to get my second drink from the bartender, who was also busy, but doing a great job of managing all her bar patrons.

A gentleman, who I believe was a manager, came by the table and asked how things were.  He was the first person to come by us since our waitress had brought our drinks nearly a half an hour earlier.  We were able to place our food orders with him and he must have said something to our waitress because she was much more attentive after that.

To be fair to the waitress, from what I saw, there were only two servers, one bartender, one busser, and this manager working the entire front.  Being that the entire place was filled, they didn&#39;t do a bad job.  But I would hope that management would better prepare for the future.  Not sure if this was an unusually busy night that caught them off guard, but it&#39;s St. Patrick&#39;s Day weekend...you should expect to be pretty busy (even though you&#39;re not an Irish pub) and bring in extra staff to handle to high capacity.

The beer selection is pretty good.  The food, while creatively described on the menu, is nothing really special.  Not bad, but nothing I am craving the next day.  However, the prices are pretty decent.",14/04/13,235,3,2,5,40,7.355099999999999,3.505,0.197,18.298000000000002,No,2140

When we didn&#39;t know our drink order her green tentacles were quickly extended and followed by the look of death. When she came back foaming at the mouth we decided we better order quickly or she was going to send us to the chamber of death. I ordered the cheese fries and my boyfriend ordered the jalapeno cheese stix for Appetizers. I must admit the jalapeno cheese stix were quite tasty and almost as hot as the fire that was breath out mamma meannie. The cheese fries were also good and had ample amounts of cheese. For dinner we each had an individual pizza. These pizzas are small. Seriously don&#39;t order this alone and expect to be full.

We got the artichoke/spinach dip appetizer, which came with plenty of chips and a good amount of dip.   I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich - good, but a bit overwhelmed by the spicy sauce and my GF got the burger with pineapple, she liked it and normally she&#39;s a bit picky.

Negatives - I could see parking being a problem (but wasn&#39;t that night) and I&#39;m not a fan of the whole Jimmy Buffet thing, so music-wise I would put something else on the jukebox.

Will definitely give this place another visit!!",22/02/09,142,4,1,2,-3,1.6858,0.9690000000000001,0.147,8.883999999999999,No,1264

Maybe it is the friendly, down to earth service, the delicious food (my mouth is watering just thinking about it), or the great, affordable drinks.

flip-flops-tiki-bar-and-grill-carol-stream-2,Jennifer W.,GDiCXUO2B7CJOlBJiMXP9g,nD5jAA49U4sDL67uoIarmA,"Let me start by saying that I have been looking forward to the opening of this local bar for MONTHS. Their opening was delayed by over two months but no explanation as to why. I hope they didn&#39;t miss the mark. 

I went last week on Monday night, hoping to beat the MNF crowd. I went with a large group and a few kids. We did get a table right away, but a roll of the eyes from the waitress when we asked to put two tables together. She did move it and her attitude did improve a little. We ordered a multitude of food, including burgers, kids meals for the little ones, some beer and milk for the kids. I also ordered some wings as appetizers. 

A few minutes later the waitress came back and apologized that they didn&#39;t have any milk, but they were running to get some, which was fine. That was one big plus for me. The owner/manager even came over and apologized which was a nice touch. Then it went downhill. The wings never came (I wasn&#39;t charged either so they were never ordered to begin with). My medium burger was charred, as was everyone else&#39;s. There was no ketchup to be found. They have those little 6 packs on the table to hold utensils and condiments and the three tables nearest didn&#39;t have any either. The waitress came back with one that was about 1/8th full. The milk did arrive safe and sound. 

I substituted onion rings for fries which were great. The men ordered the burger with BBQ sauce and &#34;onion rings&#34; on it but were sad to find out there was only one ring per burger. The men also complained that the TVs were too small and not enough of them for a football crowd on the weekends.

Overall, I was not impressed. I know they spent a lot of time working on the painting of the interior and the bar (which look like copies of any Jimmy Buffett bar between here and Key West), but I wish they would have spent more money on their food quality. I think the burgers would have been a lot better had they not been burned. All 4 were charred and not tasty. 

I think if you were purely going into the bar to drink rather than dine and you like the laid back atmosphere of the tropics and don&#39;t expect too much out of that type of bar, you won&#39;t be upset. However, if you are going to eat, stay away from the burgers until they get them done right. 

I&#39;ll go back and try something else next time and hopefully it&#39;ll be a better experience.

ETA: We went again, this time on a Sunday afternoon during football. The burger was still horrible. Burned on the outside and raw on the inside. My husband had the pizza and said it was bland and somewhat cold. 

I hope they get a better cook before summer comes. Otherwise, I won&#39;t go there to eat again. 

It&#39;ll be awhile before I go back there.",27/11/07,303,3,1,4,-16,3.9457999999999993,3.4810000000000003,1.7180000000000002,30.801000000000002,No,2760

When we got there around 7:15, the patio was understandably full. However, my wise &amp; observant BF had noticed that there was a table outside that happened to be 2 smaller tables pushed together and only 2 people were seated there. So he made a simple request to the waitress handling the patio area that maybe they could seperate one of the tables. She abruptly brushed us off, could not be bothered with the request and was not interested in accomodating us. We were a little caught off guard by the treatment but  were unwaivering in our perservance. We headed back inside to find a table where we were thoroughly ignored by the waitstaff and after 10 minutes of waiting patiently, stomachs growling, we walked out.

I have tried almost everything on the menu and have been extremely satisfied with everything. 

They have a very large selection of appetizers. The boneless wings were large, meaty and the sauce was very tasty with just the right amount of spice. The nachos were huge (I could have had them for a meal) with lots of toppings. The jerk chicken is to die for! The bean dip, beer cheese, and onion rings are very good, but my favorite are the Fire Crackers.

The burgers are HUGE (almost too big), 10 ounce Angus beef and have been cooked exactly the way I wanted each time I ordered. The pizza was very good with just the right crust, not too crisp, not too chewy. The chicken sandwich is also very good, a large chicken breast with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise (I prefer it with the honey mustard sauce).

The servers and bartenders were all very nice, friendly and polite. The food and drinks were all served in a timely manner with a smile!

The atmosphere is what I like best. All of the bar is built with real bamboo and thatch roof. The tables were all hand made with various inlaid carvings. The wall sconces, signs, and  hangings give it a very cozy, laid back feel. The two wall size murals were custom painted and give a Caribbean feel which is nice in the middle of Chicago&#39;s cold winter! There are T.V.&#39;s in every corner of the restaraunt/bar, and a large screen on one wall. I was able to get the T.V. station changed to the program i wanted to watch with one simple request. The juke box holds over 30,000 songs, and the place really gets hopping on Friday and Saturday nights. I can&#39;t wait for summer to enjoy the beer garden which is just next to and across the street from Carol Stream&#39;s parks. The restrooms are very nice, neat and clean.  

The owners are extremely nice. They genuinely seem to care about all their customers and would go out of their way to make sure your visit is a satisfactory one.

The prices are all very reasonable.

I ordered the fried chicken and again was really disappointed . My pieces were so dry, and wings were so small, practically had no meat on them. The pieces obviously sat for some time.  Corn was just out of a can nothing special. Corn bread again, just ok.  Besides being very pricey. 
The food being so disappointing again was not the reason I don&#39;t want to go back though primarily.  
I needed a carry out container and as I stood in line for that a lady brought her plate back up to the counter after having already been seated and her party had started eating. She informed the cashier/ server that she did not get her correct order... She asked for thighs or legs ( not sure ) but had been given wings.  The server apologized and then proceeded to remove wings from lady&#39;s plate and put them back in the serving tray... I was appalled !!  Any other restaurant would have thrown the 2 wings out ... And Not used the same tongs to mix them back into the tray that would be used to sell to others. I don&#39;t know if the woman ate them or not, seasoned them or not , or touched, spit or sneezed on them ( ok that&#39;s extreme and I&#39;m probably sure she didn&#39;t ) but still I was just really surprised she recycled them ...

Here&#39;s some additional pre-review advice: Pack a pillow or a huge caffeinated drink for the trip back home. You will be in a food coma if you manage to finish this hearty meal. 

Every now and then I find myself desirous of something you rarely find in most restaurants. Inexpensive, flavorful veggies and something fried just right. At one time, I thought I would have to drive to the south part of the city to eat this good. Lucky for me, I can bask in this type of goodness close to the nest. 

Priscilla&#39;s is near and dear because it is seriously akin to a Sunday dinner at my grandparents place. Fried food, items smothered in gravy and lots of starches. That said, I grew up feasting like this regularly and indulging on occasion, reminds me of them and they wonderful conversations during those meals. 

Admittedly, it has taken me a few visits to remember the need to share this great find.  I have tried the mac n cheese, fried chicken, fried fish, smothered chicken, collard greens with turkey, collard greens with pork, green beans, corn, candied yams, cornbread and cabbage (over several visits of course). I seriously enjoyed every single item but if obliged to choose, I would say the fish, collard greens and candied yams are my favorites.

From its come hither lighting, to its friendly wait-while-we-pack-it service, to the friendliest workers complete with hair nets, what is not to like? It&#39;s also super clean. 

It matters not what night of the week you intend to stop in. The food is fresh, plentiful, and offers countless choices to mix and match the soul food sampler of your dreams.

When my niece is in from college, we always get 2 dinners to go. Her fave: the baked chicken with olde time corn bread stuffing, and the &#39;greens&#39;. Ya gotta try the greens.

priscillas-ultimate-express-hanover-park,Veronica X.,1cF0kgsaBy-l7od8bh899w,PUYhH4FOJqwY8m9U_2jVDw,"I lived in Memphis for two years and enjoyed some southern cooking. This was the first time I had southern-style food since moving north 8 months ago. 

A strange hankering for fried chicken prompted me to get a fried chicken meal (3 pieces with 2 sides and cornbread) to go. I am sorry to say the meal was pretty dismal. The fried chicken (breast, drumstick and a very small piece of thigh) had soggy skin and a few feathers from the bird still remained on the thigh. The skin was salty and the breast meat very very dry. The red beans were salty and the candied yams were sickeningly sweet (which is not unusual for candied yams though). 

Everything was pre-cooked and sitting under heat lamps at dinner time, including the fried chicken. 

I can take a great tasting meal at the expense of my waistline or heart health once in a while but a bad meal ain&#39;t worth risking nothing.

I asked the cashier what was the best there and all she did was read the menu to me . If I wanted the menu read to me I could read it myself I just wanted to know but she recommended and all she gave me was a blank stare so I ended up ordering the last thing she said which was jerk chicken with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.
 
The mashed potatoes were good can&#39;t screw that up.

The mac and cheese was really hard on the top and that part was uneatable. I ended up eating just the bottom half and throwing away the top. What a waste of money.
 
The Jerk Chicken was not jerked but chicken with jerk sauce on the side. The chicken was moist and delicious and was the only redeeming quality of this visit. The jerk sauce was way too peppery and hot it was mostly peppers and just a little bit of the other stuff to make it jerk sauce and I ended up not eating the jerk sauce and having the grilled chicken alone and if I order the grilled chicken alone it would have saved me a dollar what a waste that&#39;s two dollars now I wasted.

So when my girlfriend and I saw that Priscilla&#39;s was opening up a spot near my old house, I knew we had to try it.  We&#39;ve since come back several times, and we&#39;re always satisfied with our meal.  

I suppose I should probably start with the fried chicken dinner I always order here.  They offer you a choice of white or dark meat.  It&#39;s always dark meat for me, and they usually offer three pieces (sometimes I&#39;ve gotten four though). The meat is flavorful and you get a good-sized serving of chicken.  It&#39;s not the best fried chicken I&#39;ve had -- it&#39;s not crispy -- but it&#39;s still very good.  I&#39;ve also tried Priscilla&#39;s smothered chicken and smothered pork chops, and those are also very good.  

Each of their dinners comes with two sides.  I go for the mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.  They give you a very generous scoop of each, and thank God they do because those are some damn good sides!  You also get a piece of cornbread with your meal.  Frankly, I&#39;ve never come across a piece of cornbread I didn&#39;t like, and their cornbread was no exception.  

On one visit, we decided to try their peach cobbler.  Sadly, we weren&#39;t fans of it even though we really wanted to like it.  Something about it was just a bit &#34;off.&#34;  It&#39;s OK though because we come here for the chicken (me) and catfish (my girlfriend).  

We&#39;ll keep coming back to this place.  The prices are reasonable, the portions are big, and the staff is friendly.",11/05/12,176,4,2,4,48,3.4034000000000004,2.9720000000000004,0.771,17.256000000000004,No,1541

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place since it opened because 1) I&#39;m not a soul food expert but have loved it when I&#39;ve had it and 2) there is always something comforting about fried chicken.  

So finally a situation presented itself to give it a try.   Stopped in on Sunday and got an 8 piece chicken dinner with one large side.   Ordered the mac and cheese which was awesome.  The chicken itself was tasty albeit a touch spicy for my group (kids) and I was disappointed they didn&#39;t have any chicken breasts on a Sunday at 6 but also understood it was the end of the run.  They made up for it by adding extra legs into the batch.   Also ordered the candied yams which got a mixed review due to the inclusion of a baking spice (nutmeg perhaps?).   The cornbread muffins were good but as someone mentioned, Boston Market&#39;s were better.  Also got red velvet cake which was good but not mindblowing.

The service was great - she helped me through the menus and talked about what she liked there.   Everyone was so darn friendly.

The chicken was perfect and the sides were actually bigger than what I expected.  I chose the black eye peas (perfect!) and green beans (yum!) - both were cooked with a ham bone, based on the wonderful flavor.  Since two of us were sharing the meal for lunch (didn&#39;t want to stuff ourselves) we got an additional side of coleslaw (the BEST coleslaw I&#39;ve had anywhere...perfectly crunchy but covered in creamy &amp; tangy goodness) and an extra muffin.  The muffins were a bit on the small side (which is fine by me) but they were the only item I didn&#39;t think was as delicious as they could have been - seemed a bit on dry side.

This is probably my 2nd time eating here and I must say, I wish i tried it earlier. 

Not sure how the menu works, but I believe that there&#39;s different options for everyday. So obviously I looked at which day it was and just went from there. Had to go with the fried chicken dinner. 3 pieces of chicken, 2 sides, and a bread. Some may think it&#39;s a little pricey at 8.99 but I feel like it was pretty good portion. 

Though my personal opinion is just that Boston Market corn bread was better (still a little bitter). But yea, the big factor for me for giving this place 5 stars is just that the staff was very friendly. I came it and took my time while ordering and the lady behind the cash register wasn&#39;t impatient or anything. Then when I got my food from another lady, she told me to enjoy.

The short ribs were doused in some sauce.  Pretty yummy but a tad salty.  The chicken dishes were both good. 
The sides.
I think the sides are excellent.  The mac and cheese is delicious.  The candied yams have some nutmeg I think in them.  It gives it a little kick.  But those are saccharinely sweet...
The collard greens are yummy and you can get it with either turkey or pork.  I got the turkey and it had a nice smoky flavor to it.

So I stopped in over lunch to see what they had. What really surprised me was... they didn&#39;t have a lunch menu. All that was there was dinner prices. Which is fine, but I picked up a baked chicken entre meal. This set me back $10.99, plus tax, without so much as a drink!

The 8 pieces chicken meal (with one large side and possibly some corn bread) was a more reasonable $9. I thought about going with that, but that would be far too much food. As it was, I had leftovers, so $5.50 / meal isn&#39;t bad.

So I had the baked chicken, which was wonderfully moist and very well flavored, with candied yams and rice with gravy. Avoid the rice with gravy, as there was nothing particularly special about the parboiled rice or white gravy. But the candied yams tasted nice and sweet; a good example of what I was looking for when I went there.

The whole thing was accompanied by sweet cornbread (I thought you weren&#39;t supposed to use sugar in cornbread in the south?), which was buttery and very good.

Please see my review of the Streamwood location for my background  and love of Soulfood.

The basic premise: you get a main meal (options rotate daily), 2 sides, a cornbread muffin, and a drink. The prices are a bit high for me -- hence the 4 stars instead of 5 - but as I said, if you&#39;ve got a craving....it takes care of it. 

This location is like the cafeteria, except smaller and more compact. I mainly go for the fried chicken and the red velvet cake when I&#39;m not training. 

Around here, your options for fried chicken mainly consist of KFC and Popeye&#39;s, neither of which do anything for me. Tonight I tried the baked chicken, and it was just as good as the fried. The sides we all shared tonight were mashed potatoes, corn, candied yams and mac and cheese. My kids ate all the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. They love it. 

Topped it off with Sweet Tea. Yum.

It&#39;s in an odd location, where the Boston Market used to be. I wish they had breakfast and lower prices. But it&#39;s worth the trip, and if you are craving fried chicken -- GO. Go right now. Get the chicken.

Amazing Fried Chicken... it does not compare to KFC, Popeyes, etc.. It is homemade goodness. Plenty of seating inside.  I wish the sauces were lableled so I knew which one was ketchup, bbq sauce, hot sauce etc.

Mac and Cheese was delicious and is a MUST SIDE.  Cheesy crust on top.  My 2nd side was the candied yams.  They were good, but I was not a fan.  There was a weird spice in there that I did not care for.  I would guess nutmeg, but I still ate it.

Corn Bread was okkkkay.  A tad bit cold.  If it was hot, it would have be real good.

The menu is basically classic &#34;soul food&#34; i.e. collard greens, fried chicken, smothered food...etc and just like classic soul food, its great for your taste buds and your &#34;soul&#34; but bad for everything else haha. Lots of sugar, fat and salt in most of the menu items but then again most restaurants are moving in that direction these days (see KFC double down sandwich) so I don&#39;t really mind.

The Pros: Great tasting great quality food and side dishes. 

The Cons: Not great for healthy eating or people dieting. 

The Price: Very reasonable, should be under 20 (around 9-15) for a full meal.

My fried chicken dinner:
3 pcs of chicken (dark, white or mixed selection)
1 hunking scoops of dense mashed potatoes and gravy

1 medium sized corn bread muffin

all for $8.99

Compare that to a KFC dinner for $6
2 pcs of fried chicken
1 small portion of coleslaw
1 biscuit

I think Priscilla&#39;s is a pretty good deal!!

I ordered a stir fry dish with beef Mongolian style.  It was so sweet and there was way too much sauce.  It tasted like a super sweet teriyaki sauce.  I ate it, but it wasn&#39;t great.  My son ordered the Chow Fun noodle dish with shrimp.  He said this is too sweet and the shrimp are kind of rubbery.  I tasted his and yes, it was also very sweet.  The sauce on this one was described as an oyster sauce.  I don&#39;t know what that means because oyster sauce is oyster sauce.  This was super sweet.

The food is definitely a 4. Crab Rangoon was good but I wish it had more crab in it. Had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was cooked perfectly. Flakey and the miso glaze was amazing. The only thing I didn&#39;t like on the plate was the asparagus. It had a funny taste to it and I felt the flavor didn&#39;t go with the rice and fish. I had a bite of my husband&#39;s Korean BBQ filet, that was also cooked perfectly. Tender and great flavor. There are a lot of options on the menu which is nice and same with the kids menu.

What I would give a 3 on is service and the bathrooms. You have a pretty good size kid menu, a place to park strollers but no changing table? Really? I have a 19 month old, I had to change her on the small wet and dirty counter by the sinks. I am lucky I had those hospital pads and her changing pad to lay out on top of the wet, soapy counter. It was so little her legs were dangling off. There are only two stalls in the bathroom both were dirty. No toilet paper and then there was also no paper towel. I had changed her before dinner. 1.5-2 hours later when we were paying I had to use the restroom. Guess what? Still no toilet paper or paper towels. Really? 

They bus boys cleared off our tables in a hurry. I left my daughter&#39;s sippy cup on the table and had to ask two different guys if they had seen it. One said they had and he went to the kitchen and grabbed it. Think they threw it in the trash. It was sticky and dirty, wasn&#39;t that way on the table. 

Our server was okay, felt like she was rushing us out, especially when we were settling the check. Yes there were a lot of people waiting for a table but we were a party of 11, 6 were kids. Would come back for the food, it really was amazing. Hopefully next time service is better and hopefully they get a changing table in there. Sadly I had to change my daughter in her stroller when we left. It was a bit chilly out but I didn&#39;t really have a choice. Someone also needs to check the restrooms for cleanliness every couple hours.",11/10/15,228,3,1,5,-16,4.593000000000001,3.979,1.7180000000000002,28.303999999999995,No,2058

The fried rice is one of the best I have ever had. I order the combo fried rice (without shrimp) made with brown rice. Being a diabetic, I appreciate the availability of brown rice and I find this dish especially good made with brown rice. Another dish I enjoy is the Yakatory Beef. It is a typical Asian appetizer consisting of chunks of beef on skewers in an Asian sweet sauce, but the sauce is really well done. It is not too sweet, sour, tangy, or heavy. The beef is complimented by a light Asian slaw in a light vinaigrette dressing that is not too sweet, creamy, or tangy. As far as soups go I highly recommend the pho bowl. I always get it with wheat noodles because this is a more carb friendly option than rice noodles. I really enjoy the generous helping of fresh peppers and bean sprouts which are meant to be mixed into the soup. You can not go wrong with any of the noodle dishes. A variety of noodles are offered and you can swap out any protein or use any noodle with any protein. I recommend the curry but it is just OK.

If I ever had a taste for Asian food, I usually would frequent Thipi Thai in Glen Ellyn.

Fortunately for me, my new employer is based in St. Charles, and they treated us to a lunch as part of our orientation. What a nice touch!

We arrived at noon on a Tuesday and were seated promptly. The tagline for the restaurant is: Sushi, Stir Fry, and Bar. I knew I wouldn&#39;t be having sushi since I don&#39;t eat seafood. The Bar was out of the question because I&#39;m not a drinker and I don&#39;t think that would have gone over well with the new bosses. As a result, I was in on the stir fry! 

I had two basic options; a wok tossed entre (protein and vegetables) served in some sort of sauce with a side of rice (brown, white, or fried rice) or a noodle dish. After some brief debate, I decided to go with Chicken Pad Thai.

Before I get ahead of myself, I should mention that they have soups and entre salads as well. I actually ordered the hot and sour soup, which had tofu, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms with white pepper and vinegar. It had a nice flavor with a bit of kick, but not too spicy. I am a wimp when it comes to hot items, but this was nothing.

As for my Pad Thai, it was excellent! Slightly Sweet and Sour, it had tofu, scallions, bean sprouts, carrots, and crushed peanuts. I ate the first half with chopsticks but after that I realized I was hungry and wanted more noodles faster, so I switched to the fork!

All in all, a solid place for a meal. I&#39;ll be interested to possibly try some of their appetizers and sides on my next visit!",03/01/15,209,4,1,2,-4,1.8523,1.8559999999999999,0.43500000000000005,17.709,No,1717

My usual experience would be 4 stars but this most recent would be a zero. Generously a zero. 

First, there was a line of people waiting for tables in the cocktail section politely. A mother and em daughter pair were waiting in front of an empty table when a woman cut the entire line and hijacked their table. The mother kindly told the lady there was a line and they were next, but the lady said &#34;oh that&#39;s funny.&#34; And wouldn&#39;t move from the table. When the pair spoke to a manager, she said she couldn&#39;t do anything about it and offered them a free appetizer. Fortunately for the mother and daughter, a new table opener up quickly. Unfortunately for my friend and me, we waited another 15 minutes before getting a table. The manager offered us no free appetizer or any sort of condolence, despite the fact we lost a table just as much as the ladies in front of us did.

Secondly, my friend and I sat at the next available table which was for a party of 6. After our drinks and soup came out, we noticed the next people in line were a party of 4 trying to squeeze into a table for two. We felt bad hogging such a large table so we offered to take the two-top so they could have a more comfortable one. When we explained to the server that we wanted to move so the people next in line could have a table, she gave us a bit of an attitude.

While they were good, they weren&#39;t the best Maki rolls I&#39;ve ever had, and I felt it wasn&#39;t worth the price. However, it was a nice variety of 4 different types of rolls.


For dinner, I ordered the sesame chicken with brown rice. The presentation was very appealing. Although, if it weren&#39;t for the addition of mango to the sesame sauce, the meal would not have been anything special. The hint of sweetness from the mango provided a unique and pleasant twist to an otherwise traditional and underwhelming dish. My friend ordered the Kung Pao shrimp and said it was very good.For dessert, we ordered Mochi and mango cheesecake. Both were very tasty, especially the cheesecake.

Aesthetically, this place gets 5/5. It&#39;s beautiful. Almost like if Beyonc was an Asian interior designer. When you walk in you see a big Buddha. My dad would love that in his backyard. I love the dark furnishes with the ever changing LED lights around the place. Even the bathroom looks amazing. Best bathroom since Paris in Vegas. You&#39;re gonna wanna just eat and drink a lot just to continually use it. 

Food is good, not amazing. A little on the pricey side. Personally I&#39;m not a fan of going out for Asian food being Asian myself. I had the lad nar (I just call it ladna). I felt like there was way too much broccoli on it but the flavor was good. 

Now the most important part, alcohol. Which is pretty much the main reason why I come here. That sake on happy hour is gonna get you. $3 warm liquid killer. The mixed drinks are pretty good too. The bartenders are not only friendly and talkative but they make great suggestions.

Seated in a large booth we reviewed the menu. It was our first visit to any of the Wok N Fire restaurants. We ordered some carryout once at my sister in law&#39;s house that was yummy. We quickly decided on lettuce wraps to start (minus the mushrooms). Then we learned that they can&#39;t make them without the mushrooms because the filling is premixed. This was a disappointment, but we had a backup plan. We went with the pan seared dumplings filled with chicken and veggies. These were very dense.  I was a nice surprise. And they didn&#39;t fall apart when you cut them. Again, this is a plus. 

The hubby order Szechwan Steak with veggie fried rice. I had two delicious bites off his plate. It was sweet and spicy. He really enjoyed it. I went with Bangkok Garlic Pepper Shrimp. This had a light, tasty sauce, peapods, carrots, onions and mushrooms. I went without the mushrooms and included a side of brown rice.  It was my first time eating brown rice and I thought it was great!  A little nutty almost. It was perfect mixed with the sauce. 

First impressions are not always what they seem. At the beginning of the meal, the server was not my favorite person at the table. She threw the appetizer plates on the table and didn&#39;t seem to be paying attention. But, then she got the orders right, kept our glasses full without prompting and wrapped and labeled our leftovers. These are the more important details to me and she got them right. The hubby even noticed and he doesn&#39;t notice much. ;-)

My wish list includes having the nutritional information available on their website. I&#39;m counting calories and I had to guess because they don&#39;t have that available. 

All in all, a delicious meal and we will be back soon.",06/02/12,215,4,2,5,30,5.1236,5.178000000000001,1.5579999999999998,28.264,No,1881

This time my wife and I ordered sushi and it was all delicious and well prepared.

The prices were high which caused a bit of sticker shock, but when the rolls came, it was definitely worth it as the rolls here are usually 8-10 pieces where the same rolls at other sushi places are only 6-7 pieces, plus the quality was excellent.

We had so much sushi that we had a hard time eating it all, since we were expecting smaller rolls.  When we come back, we will make sure to order one less roll next time so we won&#39;t leave feeling like we&#39;re about to explode!  :)

Prior to my visit on Friday, 13-Sept-13 I hadn&#39;t made a visit since the summer months (May-July) when she was our server on many occasions. Being that I&#39;m a regular there, she and a lot of the staff remember my order pretty well which is definitely proves great customer service in my book!

The staff pays great attention to details on drink orders (splash of mixer, no eggs in entrees ect...) and is usually very attentive to customers. Happy Hour is from 9-11p M-Sa and features half priced house rolls and appetizers when sitting in the bar. Great idea for a pre-game if you plan on checking out the Downtown St. Charles bar scene.

Let me just start by saying that the food was amazing. We had no problems there. Our waitress was sweet as can be and very attentive. The bus-boys were busting their butts cleaning and being awesome. 

However, the customer service by the hostess stand was TERRIBLE. Five people (high schoolers?) were standing at the hostess station when my family arrived. Out of all them, no one so much as looked up from their phones to greet me. It wasn&#39;t until I waited, and said &#34;HELLO!&#34; very loudly, that someone looked at me. Even then, the girl said that she couldn&#39;t help me. She said I&#39;d have to wait for the girl on the phone to put my name down for waiting. 

Once this other girl finally paid attention to me, we were told a half hour wait. I put our name down and waited. .and waited. . and waited. We watched as families without reservations came in AFTER us and were seated. We watched as people sat on the high bar stools for a drink, ordered appetizers and were then moved to tables. We checked back every 20 minutes thinking we missed our names, or that our buzzer was broken. It wasn&#39;t. After an hour and fifteen minutes of standing (there are no chairs or benches. You are screwed.) we were finally shown to a table by a hostess who didn&#39;t say a word to us.

It attracts 20-30 somethings (which is interesting, because I didn&#39;t realize there are single, professional 20-30 somethings in the far western suburbs of Chicago).

Anyway, it seems like a good date spot. But the food options for vegans and vegetarians stink.

For one thing, they don&#39;t have any vegan or vegetarian sushi rolls (though I think they could make some).

Secondly, of their stir-fry and noodle dishes, only a few are actually vegetarian (the Szechuan, Chinese brown and teriyaki); all the rest contain oyster sauce. So make sure to ask questions if you&#39;re a strict vegetarian.

My mom and I shared a Szechuan vegetable and a Chinese brown with tofu (both $12 a piece). The dishes tasted exactly alike: corn-starchy sauce without any flavor, covering a variety of vegetables. While I liked the vegetable mix, and the option for brown rice, the sauce was just terrible. Worse yet, they put in a ton of chili, which just ended up in a spicy sauce that had no inherent flavor on its own. All burn, no delight.

The service was not very good either. Our server wasn&#39;t particularly friendly and took a good 10 minutes to bring us water and a ginger soda we ordered.

The weird thing is that I&#39;ve been to two other Wok N Fire branches and didn&#39;t have nearly as bad an experience. Then again, I was less discerning in the past.

My own imposed rules for any review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Must order something unique each visit.
3. If they have any &#34;signature&#34; items on the menu, you must order a &#34;signature&#34; item at least once.
4. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Wok N Fire

Location/Layout - 6.5/10:  Located essentially in the former Piano Factory section of downtown St. Charles.  The restaurant is in the Southeast corner of the shopping/condo development.  Parking is available adjacent to the restaurant of in the parking garage of the complex.  The interior is what sets this place apart from a lot of other restaurants.  The design is extremely modern and very campy Asian.  There is color changing LEDs everywhere along with Giant Buddha and Dragan statues.  This lighting effect is interesting in the bar and eating area and can add a nice mellow ambiance.  On the other hand it can be extremely disorientating in the small confined washrooms.  I would not be surprised if someone had a seizure based on how the strobe and color changing affect bounces off the dark tile walls.    

Menu - 6.5/10:  Wok N Fire&#39;s options are focused on Americanized Cantonese and Thai offerings with their own take on fresh Sushi offerings.  There are some Asian inspired appetizer options along with a limited desert menu.  

Service - 6/10: We are always quickly greeted by a Hostess, although the Hostess stand is hidden and your natural flow on entry makes you want to enter the bar area which is opposite of where the stand is located.  We have eaten in both the bar and restaurant area and have had good service in both areas, although the bar area has always had more patrons and seems to get more attentive service.

Food - 6/10: The food has always been very good and of above average quality, with the exception of the desserts.  We have sampled several desserts and they are all just average in quality, with the chocolate cake being the best of the options, but all taste like they are standard premade and thawed.  We have never sampled the Sushi options and can not speak to those offerings in either taste or quality.  The main dishes themselves are not overly large and come with either a rice or noodle option.  Both the chicken and steak options are very good and tender.  The heat level of dishes, such as the Kung Pao, seems to vary from visit to visit, and can lack heat one time and scorch you the next.  The vegetable eggrolls are the star of the appetizer offerings and are ordered every time we visit.  We have had two issues with the food; coincidently both occurred on a single visit.  The first was that our order of Kung Pao was missing peanuts, which was quickly rectified once it was pointed out to the server.  The other issue was that there was a sticker that said SAT in my cashew beef.  We later found out when the manager came over to apologize that this was caused by the dishes being pre-measured and bagged for future use.  While I do not have an issue with this in concept, it does make me question the freshness, but the manager was very apologetic and made the situation right in very short order.  Pricing is fair for the main dishes but the appetizers, desserts, and drinks are very expensive.  

Drinks - 6/10:  Wok N Fire has all the standard soft drink options.  Where they excel is that they offer a very trendy bar along with upscale, both in pricing and pairings, mix drinks.  They do offer several beer options, most in bottle and do offer a select number of Asian brews, which is a nice touch, given the restaurants format.

Overall Experience - 6.5/10:  This is a compromise restaurant for me and my girlfriend.  I love Asian cuisine and she does not at all.  Fortunately, Wok N Fire has enough Asian fusion with an American emphasis that we can both be happy.  Additionally, they offer a unique atmosphere that is intimate enough for us to have a nice dinner or lunch and enjoy each others company.",19/02/13,454,3,1,5,10,7.0199,4.0040000000000004,0.892,36.104,No,4223

When we were seated at our table, the waitress immediately came over to the table for our drink order.  I asked for a drink menu and said that I would like some time to look it over.  She came back to the table 4 more times in less than 5 minutes asking for our drink order.  We felt very rushed and continued to experience that feeling the rest of our short dinner.  Once drinks arrived, we experienced the same behavior with our order.  The waitress came over every 2 minutes asking for our order.  We finally placed our order with the hope that we would be allowed some time to relax and enjoy our drinks.  Within 2 minutes the food was in front of us.  We ordered 2 meals with chicken and both had  chicken which contained a lot of gristle. Numerous times we were asked by several people if we were done or did we want a box.  We were both very uncomfortable with the pushiness and we were unable to enjoy our Anniversary dinner.  We were never asked if we wanted a second drink, and were given the bill quickly.  We were in and out in about 45 minutes.  It was extremely disappointing. We eat out at least once a week and enjoy many restaurants in the Fox Valley area.

wok-n-fire-st-charles,JP D.,eRX4tjUzNE0LGLwbGdkqwg,Bl8AYJPg3qL6BM1_ltDLfg,"If you would have asked me a year ago for a good sushi place I would have said Wok N Fire. I&#39;m not sure what has happened in the past year but this place has totally gone downhill. 

A couple of months ago I ordered two Chinese CHICKEN salads for my boss and I. When I got back to work and unwrapped the package I learned there was no CHICKEN. I called and spoke with the general manager. He insisted that I bring both salads back in order to prove there was no chicken. He claimed that people have said that before just to get free food. I absolutely refused to bring my salad back because I had already opened it. It&#39;s such a large salad that is spews over the sides. Also, my boss had almost finished her.

Instead the GM and I agreed a photo would be acceptable. When I returned to pick up my chicken he held the chicken hostage behind his back until I showed him the pictures. 

He offered no apology, no compensation, not even a welcome back. I told him that I would not be returning and that I would let my entire office know of my experience.

Well, a few months passed and I decided to give them another try. I ordered pad Thai a few times and the sushi sampler and it was fine. On black Friday I had a hankering for the Chinese Chicken Salad. So I ordered it. 

It was in terrible shape. The lettuce was old and wilted and BLACK. The grilled chicken was very very old and the crispy noodles on top were not the normal noodles they put on the salad. 

I decided once again to boycott. That is, until today. When I forgot to bring lunch and decided that I just have to have the Chinese Chicken Salad. I mean, the dressing is just so damn delicious I crave it. 

I picked up my salad as usual. The girl at the stand was very nice. I inspected my salad to ensure the chicken was there, and it was.

I got back to my desk and started to remove some noodles, because there are way too many, and noticed a booger like lettuce. As I picked more through the salad I noticed a lot of brown/black edges, soggy wilted lettuce, you get the idea. 

I walked back over and returned my salad. The AGM, Ben was very very friendly and apologized. He offered to make me something else but I declined and just requested my money back. 

Ben&#39;s response compared to the GM&#39;s response a few months ago was great. He apologized, he shook my hand he offered to fix it. Ben may be Wok N Fire&#39;s only saving grace. 

I can tell you right now that I am officially boycotting Wok N Fire and never ever going back. Not just this Wok N Fire, but all of them. 

There are many other experiences I can share with you, such as slow wait staff on a slow afternoon, incorrect food orders being given and non refill of sodas and water.  I am so disappointed but I suppose I live and I learn.",04/12/12,310,1,1,3,-5,2.2427,3.545,2.8909999999999996,32.564,No,2783

It is certainly not a place to come to for a romantic dinner.  The sushi was good, but it seemed like every roll came with shrimp tempura!!  We had to search high and low for rolls without the shrimp tempura.  The ones we got were very tasty.  However, I wish they would tell you how many pieces come with each roll.  We ordered three rolls and two had 8 pieces and one had like 12!  Luckily, we only ordered three rolls. We always tend to overorder on the sushi.  

We also had the lettuce cups, those are always good!  Fun place and good food, definitely be prepared for the noise level.",29/08/11,88,4,2,4,22,3.7443999999999997,2.294,0.149,8.557,No,698

The Wok n Fire in South Barrington has surpassed this St. Charles location since they opened last year. Food and service are much better in SB overall.

Suburban cougars and wannabe MILFs scream from the top of their lungs every time one of their girlfriends walk through the door...quite a primitive greeting.  Quite annoying.

That&#39;s right, this is where the &#34;woo-hoo&#34; girls hang out, except they&#39;re not girls anymore.

My husband and I walked in on a Friday night at 7pm without reservations.  First mistake.  We were quoted with an hour and fifteen minute wait.  Pager in hand we loitered.  (You can leave your phone number instead if you want to walk around outside).  

We kept eyeing the bar area that consisted of your typical bar + just a handful of bar stools, a few high tables with chairs and a couple lounge-like benches with a small coffee tables.  

A table in the bar area opened up so we ran over to claim it.  Only two servers were working in this area, both of which must have decided that my husband and I were perfectly content with our empty drinks and no food.  My husband attempted numerous times to get the servers&#39; attention.  We truly felt as if we were being ignored.  I understood that it was a crazy busy Friday night, but when a couple of girlfriends walked in and were approached by the server almost immediately while my husband and I had been waiting for 30 minutes, I thought I was going to loose it. 

Who wants to wait 30 minutes at a table before you can hunt down a server to even say hello to you?

I finally waived down one of the servers who apologized for the oversight and was sincerely sweet throughout our dinner.  She definitely made her best attempt to show us extra attention.  

To make matters worse, our food was horrible.  My husband ordered the Orange Peel Chicken which was so sweet that he could not finish it.  I ordered the Bangkok Garlic Pepper Tofu which was bland but I did enjoy the fact that they offered brown rice at no extra charge.  Both our dishes could have also used more veggies. 

I&#39;ve had better Asian food at P.F. Chang&#39;s and Ben Pao&#39;s.

*The Thai crepe.  Savory crepe stuffed with shrimp and chicken and sprinkled with crunchy bean sprouts.  Asian coleslaw was served on the side with crunchy noodles, peanuts with a light and sweet vinagrette.

*The sushi.  Still must give it a try.",20/10/10,301,2,1,3,-35,2.6746,3.1009999999999995,2.812,25.088999999999995,No,2550

The decor was like a something you&#39;d see in a nice downtown Chicago restaurant... but we were in the suburbs!

The place was dimly lit, but had an ever-changing color display of lights throughout the restaurant. A large gold Buddha staged in red light is what you see in the entryway. The lounge area is to the left and restaurant to the right. We were seated at a booth (party of 8) by a golden dragon wall piece, again immersed in color-changing lights.

Food was excellent (by suburban standards). Two people in our party agreed that the coconut shrimp appetizer was the BEST they have ever tasted and said they could easily come back and order a few rounds of those as their meal. I ordered basil chicken with brown rice (from their wok tossed entrees), which was nicely presented and had great flavor. Their freshly made ginger ale with flavored vodka was great too. I had one with pomegranate and got to try one with vanilla. Both were tasty and refreshing, but not too heavy on the alcohol.

I laughed when each person who eventually made a trip to the restrooms came back exclaiming, &#34;You gotta go see the bathrooms. They&#39;re beautiful!&#34; I did check out the men&#39;s room and, indeed, it was quite nice with round glass sinks, excellent tile work, more colored lights (see a pattern here?). I opted not to take a picture inside the restroom, for obvious reasons.

Great place for a nice dinner with a group of friends. A little more on the pricey side, but definitely worth it.

The peanut sauce that came with the chicken satay was excellent, which was good because the chicken was dry. There were also some chunks of satay that looked a little rough. Probably should have been tossed out.

The soup though...not enough ginger or cilantro, and no rice in it at all. It was just bland, which I&#39;m sad about. The good things are that a lunch special is only $7.99, and the service was beyond fast! It look only 45 minutes from the time we sat down until we left. Not bad for a weekday lunch!

I hate to say this but I typically order from here because it&#39;s a &#39;last resort&#39; for Thai food in the area. As an American-Thai person growing up in an entirely Thai cultured home, I&#39;m probably a bit more biased about Thai foods/entrees. 
All the times I&#39;ve had their food, I&#39;ve been disappointed. Perhaps the owners have super &#34;americanized&#34; their recipes, in which case, fine. Their restaurant, their choice. The most popular Thai dish, Pad Thai, has been less than good. They use the much thinner noodles than the traditional pad thai noodles and the sauce is so bland. I can&#39;t quite figure out what sauce they use, but the dish comes out very slightly &#34;wet&#34;, or soupy, which is way off for pad thai. The Pad See Ewe is also very bland and again, also wet. It&#39;s just a weird thing for these particular dishes. The egg is like a mixed fried egg instead of stirred into the mix of noodles. The lard nar is okay, but even the gravy is very thin and light in color. It should be a thicker consistency and like a brown color. Theirs is kind of ... grey. 
The chicken has been fine - cooked right, not over or undercooked. The shrimp however has been smaller in the past year and it usually seems hard. Shrimp should never be hard. Period. 
The garnish that comes with pad thai seems to overwhelm the dish itself which has me questioning if they use less noodles and meat. If so, that&#39;s not cool. I don&#39;t want to pay for a heap of carrots, cabbage, and bean sprouts. 
It&#39;s very sad because I really keep hoping that if I go back after a few months, it&#39;ll be so much better. Even a little better. But it hasn&#39;t been.",09/06/15,211,3,1,3,1,2.3853999999999997,3.3150000000000004,1.4769999999999999,21.209000000000003,No,1862

It is very small inside, but very cute with bursts of color and happy elephants! After we sat, we had two different people come up to ask and if we were ready to order.

My friend and I both decided to get Pad Thai -- his with chicken, mine with tofu. I also ordered a coconut bubble tea.

My bubble tea was terrible. The balls were mushy and misshapen. Tasted blah.

It was just the right portion. Then we stayed another two hours to chat while they kept filling up our waters (props for this). Our bill was reasonable -- about ten dollars each.

The restaurant itself is cute with about 10 tables in front and a takeout counter. We got right to entrees and I ordered a Pad Thai with shrimp. The dish was a bit disappointing. It seemed like there was about 50% lettuce and 50% noodle/actual ingredients. So overall a lot of filler. And the shrimp were deep fried and laid on top, which seemed strange for a pad thai. The dish was also about room temp.

The people I was with had slightly better experiences with their meals, so that is why I&#39;m giving a 3 star review vs a two. Overall, service was good, prices were about average for the type of food, but the food itself was lacking.",12/11/14,80,3,1,2,5,1.6542999999999999,1.002,0.546,8.451,No,717
happy-elephant-thai-cuisine-elk-grove-village-2,Natalie K.,Fs2ur2HbSV8LnDuKdZxHOA,2r4q-UdSiWpcY5lPT_NIhw,"I tried this sweet little gem of an unpretentious Thai cuisine eatery, tucked away in the far corner of an unassuming strip mall off Rahlings Road, around the corner to the south of Biesterfield Rd. in Elk Grove Village, after an appointment today at Alexian Bros. Medical Center. I found it on Yelp, after leaving the appointment, hungry and with an itch for Thai food. It&#39;s a short hop and a skip from the medical center, extremely easy to find. The dining room is no more than a storefront, but very clean, bright and cheery, with comfy, glass top tables, covering a pretty pattern. I read in another review that it&#39;s chilly, and I found it to be so, too, particularly on this cold winter afternoon. It would be great if they could think of a way to improve their heating system output. I found a great way to bust the chill, however, in a large pot of hot Jasmine tea, which was quite tasty.

I started with spring rolls, and was pleased to find them very fresh-tasting, with delicate wrapping, yummy inner ingredients and a delicious, light plum sauce, to which I give high marks. I moved on to one of my favorite staples--chicken satay. On the up aside, I loved the fresh cucumber salad and the shredded lettuce and bean sprouts that adorn the chicken pieces. The best aspect of this entree is the peanut sauce, presented as a generous serving, heated, very creamy and most flavorful. I give it an A. The one disappointing feature, however, was the satay itself, served in a unique preparation. In fact, I&#39;ve never had a satay like this. The pleasing aspect of a chicken satay is the meat being thinly sliced, flavorfully grilled, served on wooden skewers and, normally, very tender. The Happy Elephant has a very different approach to chicken satay, however: chicken chunks are battered and deep-fried, served off-skewer, on the plate, next to the shredded lettuce and sprouts. Not only is the grilled flavor lost in a fattier, starchy cooking style, but I&#39;m sad to say the chicken chunks weren&#39;t the least bit tender; they were very chewy and actually tough in spots. If the chef asked my feedback, I would recommend they abandon this unusual twist to this popular dish for adoption of the traditional preparation. It&#39;s a shame, too, because the inferior style detracts considerably from the exceptional peanut sauce.

I moved on to another favorite of mine: pad Thai with tofu and the .99 extra peanut sauce. I give this one high marks; again, the ingredients were marvelously fresh, the thin noodles soft and delicate, and the tofu had a lovely taste and texture. My enjoyment of this dish went a long way for offsetting my disappointment with the overly tough chicken chunks. The added peanut sauce was an inspiration, given how really special it is at the Happy Elephant. I&#39;d like to mention, too, I had a glass of Thai iced coffee, which was excellent: a tall glass, sweet cream and good, chilled coffee over ample ice. 

As I was taking a lot of it home, I asked for an added to-go item: a coconut milk soup with lime juice and lemon grass, enhancing a chicken broth. It&#39;s among my husband&#39;s favorite at a Thai restaurant, so I wanted to treat him to this special plus, along with the other leftovers, when I returned him in the evening. He loved the spring rolls and pad Thai, and was delighted with the coconut soup.

I&#39;d like to say a word, too, about the service. A very lovely, friendly and extremely efficient, young woman waited on all the customers single-handedly and she was attentive, knowledgeable and very courteous. When I asked to take leftovers home, she brought containers to my table and packaged up everything herself, stacking all containers neatly in a tightly cinched bag to prevent spillage. Everything made it home in perfect condition. The one, unisex washroom at the back of the dining room was spacious and exceptionally clean and comfortable. Most impressive of all was the bill: with everything I ordered, the total tab was only $30, which I call an exceptional value, especially given the overall high quality of the service and food, minus the disappointing satay.

I&#39;m not an elephant, but I left a happy customer at least, and like an elephant, I won&#39;t forget this fun stop for good, reasonably priced Thai food next time I&#39;m in the Elk Grove Village vicinity.",03/03/16,534,4,4,5,122,14.534,6.966000000000001,1.4020000000000004,25.632,No,4359

I&#39;ve been eating here before ownership changed from the last Thai place and it became Happy Elephant, so I&#39;m not new to the game. For years it was a great suburban go-to place. 

But I took my dad here in June for Father&#39;s Day, and the waiter (a new face I had never seen) snapped at us. SNAPPED. I had asked if he could bring some condiments- super kindly, mind you- and he snapped back, &#34;Ummmm. I only have two hands. You&#39;ll have to wait.&#34; As a social worker and as someone who has worked years in restaurants, I was taken aback, but quickly responded, &#34;There&#39;s no need to snap. I myself worked in restaurants for a long time and know it is difficult work. We would appreciate a little more respect as patrons of your restaurant.&#34; to which he had no reply. I had hassled him in no way, and his response was rude and inappropriate. 

I came in about two weeks after that hoping he would not be there (he wasn&#39;t) but my to-go order was TINY- about 1/3 the amt you would get at any Thai place in the city. I also had requested extra veggies and there were no veggies to be found, only a few lonesome bean sprouts.

I meet my friend for weekday lunches sometimes as it&#39;s halfway between our two companies. They have good lunch time specials and are such a cute little thai shop. I loveeee the name and all the super cute branding they have to go along with it! They sell adorable shirts!

In my latest order just last week, I had a huge miss. I&#39;ve gotten their pad thai before but it&#39;s been awhile so maybe they&#39;ve changed their recipe. I ordered the tofu pad thai and it was probably the worst pad thai I&#39;ve ever had. It tasted powdery for some reason and the tofu wasn&#39;t good either...which was weird because when is tofu not good? I&#39;m wondering what happened to this batch. All the noodles were stuck together in huge chunks and that powdery dry taste...maybe they didn&#39;t add fish oil? I don&#39;t know what happened but it was the worst ever. I had about 1/4 of it before I just couldn&#39;t do it anymore. I was very sad and now I don&#39;t think  I can risk getting the pad thai from Happy Elephant again.

Now the Lime Chicken...I don&#39;t know why I never got this before last week! I&#39;m obsessed and in love! I could see myself getting the lime chicken quite a lot. It reminds me of honey chicken from chinese restaurants but with a limey thai twist. This dish was on point in every single way and I can&#39;t see myself ordering from Happy Elephant ever again without this as one of the items. I&#39;m in love~~~~~

Happy Elephant is one of the few places in the area on GrubHub which is a huge plus! :D I&#39;m going to keep on trying new things at Happy Elephant but at this point I wouldn&#39;t recommend the pad thai to anyone!

To be fair I grew up eating a lot of traditional southeast asian foods (Vietnamese, Lao, Thai). But plenty of other thai joints I&#39;ve enjoyed.

Anyway, the lady and I shared a few items. First we had the Yum Yum salad. Something my dad would make a lot when I was little. It was ok - good flavor, but that cut of beef was really tough (probably a stew beef or something). On their menu it says that the beef is grilled. Maybe it&#39;s english second language but that was not grilled. Not that I care though, just pointing it out. Also had some Green Curry. Decent flavor. No complaints.

The sticky rice was a joke though. Mushy, clumpy, way too sticky and even brick-like in a few spots. I think they skipped an important step and just took it right out of the steamer and threw it into some plastic wrap. 

Maybe it was an off day for them. But I won&#39;t be ordering any food from them in the future.",03/05/14,124,2,1,1,-11,0.11699999999999985,1.712,2.137,15.151,No,977

We received a Happy Elephant flyer yesterday and wanted to give it a try. Thai food is generally something the family likes.

We ordered egg rolls, happy rolls, spring rolls, garlic beef, spicy basil beef, ginger rush shrimp for and pepper steak for delivery and not one dish was more than acceptable. 
The best of tonight&#39;s meal was the happy rolls. The spring rolls were cold chicken wrapped in a raw tortilla with carrots and cucumbers; gross. The egg rolls were nasty, undercooked and terribly priced small veggie rolls. This place isn&#39;t fooling me, they certainly we&#39;re not home made and you could definitely find the same exact pseudo &#34;egg rolls&#34; in the Jewel freezer aisle. Definitely not an egg roll. We actually had to call the restaurant back to make sure we received all of our order (we could not determine what the spring rolls were and thought they made a mistake). 

All of the dishes lacked flavor and were soupy  take out containers stuffed with a garden of vegetables. My dad had to add 3 different sauces to his basil beef so he could eat it; it was THAT bland. 
The ginger rush did not have the slightest taste of ginger in it and only had 6 small shrimp. $12 for 6 small shrimp, no ginger and some watery sauce? No way.  How are are charging $9+ per entree?  It should at least have a decent amount of meat. In fact... All of our dishes lacked meat (which was low quality anyway) and were overloaded with vegetables and watery sauce. Such a rip off!!! 
The pepper steak flavor was good, but loaded with way too many undercooked green peppers. 
The garlic lover beef was bland.

They have a great lunch menu, primarily Thai with a few Chinese dishes mixed in.  With lunch you get soup, an appetizer and the meal itself.  We both had Massaman Curry with brown rice.  It was hot with loads of fresh, crisp vegetables, plenty of chicken and a wonderful sauce.  They offer several kinds of teas - I had a pot of oolong and Jon had jasmine tea.

But, the nicest thing was the service.  Our server came by our table and chatted.  Told us about the paintings.  When we told her how much we enjoyed the food, she told us that the next time we came in we should ask for certain dishes that were not listed on the menu and she would make them for us.

Yesterday, having a craving for &#34;Thai&#34; takeout, I returned - big mistake. I have to say it was the single most underwhelming and overpriced meal I&#39;ve ever eaten.

The spring rolls weren&#39;t rolled anywhere near tight enough, so when you picked them up, all the filling just spilled out. Strangely, the cook had also decided to placed 5 slices of dessicated jalapeno slices on top, that had obviously been sliced hours (if not the day) before. The pot stickers were OK but they were strangely similar to frozen ones I&#39;ve bought at the supermarket before....

The Cashew Chicken was basically vegetable stir fry, with a couple of slices of chicken and a few cashews thrown in as an afterthought. There was no &#34;sauce&#34; to speak of. Instead, I received an oily broth that caused the otherwise crispy veggies to get soggy. My wife had the Garlic Chicken and it was the same way. The rice portion was basically a single SMALL scoop of rice thrown in an oversize styrofoam box. If I&#39;m paying close to $10 for an entree, the least the owner could do is &#34;splurge&#34; on giving enough cheap rice.

And for all that, we payed over $30! Ridiculous. I won&#39;t be going back and would warn others to stay away.",19/07/13,166,1,1,0,-21,-0.47139999999999993,0.438,1.766,12.797,No,1474

I&#39;m an avowed Meatatarian, but there are a select few foods that I get vegetarian since they&#39;re just better that way. One of them is Tofu Pad Thai, and one of my favs is Happy Elephant&#39;s (medium spicy).

Their Mango smoothies are top-shelf, right up there with my standard-bearer Coffee Haus (in Schaumburg). That said, I don&#39;t like whatever kind of tapioca balls they use, so I go bubble-less here.

Also delicious: their Raspberry Iced Tea (which they mix themselves), their Mango Sticky Rice and their Fillet of Sole.

I&#39;ve even perused the menu multiple times. But I hadn&#39;t gotten around to having their food until tonight. I stopped by on my way home from work and got an order of spring rolls, drunken noodles with tofu, and an iced coffee because a) it was hot out and b) it was half-off. (Good move there, Happy Elephant.)

Let&#39;s break this down:
One star for the deeelicious iced coffee. it was perfectly sweetened and strong without being bitter. 
One star for friendly and fast service -- I only sat about five minutes eyeing my surroundings (smallish dining room done in reds and golds) and enjoying my iced coffee.
One star for asking how hot I wanted my noodles and nailing it -- they were spicy without being &#34;Thai spicy&#34;, which my white-girl tongue can&#39;t handle.
One star for veggie-packed, tasty food that was clearly made with fresh ingredients.
Minus a star for the spring rolls. They were frankly disappointing -- not wrapped tightly enough, I ended up eating them with a fork. The filling was all right, but overall they were overpriced and just so-so.

I&#39;m glad I checked HE out -- it&#39;s a cute place and they seem to care about their customers and their food. Given the chance, I would try something else, but I have had better Thai ... though not in EGV :)",22/07/11,163,4,2,5,20,4.107900000000001,2.7479999999999998,0.377,11.875,No,1362

I have never seen this dish appear to be swimming in a watery fluid before.  It is a drier dish and the noodles are typically pan fried.  This place seems to be more like a fast food restaurant.

happy-elephant-thai-cuisine-elk-grove-village-2,Elizabeth W.,lTvtN6Ype23fHMzIc8bb8w,22WOHY_3M__DKARuAEo4Bg,"Happy Elephant suffers from split personality disorder. It is the Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde of strip mall Thai restaurants.

The first time I came here, the food was excellent. My order was right, everything was cooked properly, and my pad woon sen was delicious and flavorful. The second time I came here, they forgot the tofu in my pad si ew, the carrots were practically raw and the broccoli was burned, and they apparently felt that &#34;hold the egg&#34; also meant &#34;hold the sauce.&#34; So disappointing!

The first time I came here, they gave me a free elephant sticker with my order. The second time I came here, they almost forgot to give me my receipt and change. 

The first time I came here, the staff was super friendly and answered the phone right away. The second time I came here, it rang about seven or eight times before anybody answered. The guy who gave me my food on arrival was friendly but seemed totally freaked out by the full dining room (maybe he should switch to decaf).

This is the only restaurant besides Hard Rock Cafe/Rainforest Cafe I have seen that has its own line of t-shirts. The logo is pretty adorable, and I love the colors. Having swag is a nice plus. Having tables so close together that nobody can get through the small dining room during the lunch rush is not. I think most customers would rather have a little R&amp;D put into the dining room before (admittedly completely awesome) elephant logo stuff.

Parking can also be very iffy. Once I was here and got a spot right away. On another occasion, I had to decide if I wanted to wait for somebody else to leave or park in a bagel shop&#39;s parking lot and walk over here. I also saw a heron in the parking lot on the first visit, but no such luck on the second visit, when the only wildlife I spotted was the invasive Parkus illegalus.

Also note that there is a minimum charge for delivery.

Maybe the difference is the time of day. My dinner visit was the 4-star visit, and my lunch visit was my 1.5 star visit (extra half star for friendliness and at least getting the mango and sticky rice right). I intend to look into the matter some more and report back with my findings.

What sets it apart is that the couple that own the restaurant are so friendly and welcoming to everyone coming through their doors.

I love their Pad Thai.  It&#39;s steamy and fresh.  You can tell it&#39;s home made b/c it does not have that orange or pink tint to it.  The Drunken Noodles are excellent as well.  They are the wide, rice noodles with hints of basil and jasmine.  The basil fried rice is cooked to perfection.  You can tell that they&#39;re not cooking out of large plastic containers.  Everything is pretty much made to order.  

Background:  The Happy Elephant moved into a noodle place that I drove by 100 times, but never walked into.  The outside used to look dirty (and mean).  Anyway, those days are over, so out with the old and in with the new.  The new place is super clean, colorful, with creative Zen-like art on the walls and did I say brand spankin&#39; new.

My brother and his girlfriend loves this place so my boyfriend &amp; I decided to give it a shot.

Food was great.  The moment we sat down, we were given soup - as I guessed was part of the lunch special.

The Thai Veggie soup was ok - my 5 yr old said it tasted just like chicken noodle without the noodles. 

Crab Rangoon - the little triangles were much smaller then I&#39;m used to but they do pack a punch of flavor. You can actually taste the different veggies / crab (not just cream cheese).

Red curry - Good mixture of veggies and beef. I thought the eggplant pieces should be a little bigger. The dish did have a good balance between sweet &amp; hot. 

Beef and Broccoli - This dish was just ok. The beef, broccoli and carrots were fresh and tasty but this dish lacked any special kick to it. The brown sauce has a soy base but not much flavor other then the soy. 

Coconut Ice cream - Who doesn&#39;t love it? Its not made fresh there but a delicious treat to finish off the lunch experience.

Like most people, I take my Thai food seriously. I have no qualms with this place being in a dinky strip mall, as many of the best Thai Food purveyors hide in them, but I do take issue with the food. I got my usual dish at any Thai Food haven, Spicy Basil with tofu... and make it extra spicy. Sadly, it was not spicy at all and wasn&#39;t all that great. It reminded me of the time I tried to make Thai food myself and it just tasted like a rice, water, and frozen veggie mix. No real flavor, absolutely no spice, and not up to par for me. The Tom Yum soup was also a disappointment. The portion size on the soup was good but again, lacking in flavor; I need more lemongrass.

My boyfriend got the green curry with tofu and totally lucked out with LOTS of spice... but not like it was hot, just like it may have been over spiced- still better than my bland food. I was so sad because the service was fantastic, the decor is uber cute, and I totally want a t-shirt with their logo on it but it just wasn&#39;t all that I thought it would be. 

The owner did come around partially through our meal to check on us and was very nice, but I didn&#39;t mention that my food was virtually tasteless. I know, I know- that&#39;s my fault, but we were in a hurry to make it to a Flaming Lips show and I didn&#39;t want to waste any more time fixing it to be better. 

If I have to be totally honest, I&#39;d give the food a 2 but the decor and service a 4.8. In defense of Happy Elephant, I think we just had an off meal because one guy eating there ordered 2 meals and then applied for a job... I&#39;d maybe give it another try if I were in the area.",06/01/10,194,3,1,2,-20,1.5238,1.365,1.652,10.981999999999998,No,1768

While I am quite adventurous with my food choices my mother is not. No spice and as plain jane as it get for her so I was a little cautious coming here.

Needless to say I am so glad that we came here. The place is super small to eat in but they are super friendly and it is especially great to have the chef (owner?) come around and see how everything was.

The thai veg soup was very hot and perfect for a cold day. I cant put my finger on it but it might have been white pepper that gave it some heat. Im probably way off but for how clear it was it packed so much flavor. If anyone can find out how they make please let me know their secret!

The egg roll was fresh and perfectly seasoned. Im a sucker for fried food so this passes with flying colors. Nice sweet and sour dipping sauce on the table too.

I got the drunken noodles which were amazing. It seems all too often when the chow fun noodle (flat wide rice noodle) is used they get burnt in the wok or over cooked to much. This was the first time in a long time that they were cooked perfectly. I love spicy food and this could have used some more for my taste so next time I ask for spicy. Overall very flavorful and lots to eat too.

The second dish that we ordered was the golden noodles. We both ordered our dishes with bbq pork and it was good match for mine but i think that the golden noodles would have been better with chicken or maybe shrimp. It was a little more basic is flavor but still very good. The eggs made the dish and it was something that I wouldn&#39;t have thought to pair.

Basically if you like thai food get over here asap. The menu is large and I will be going back soon to try more things out. Lets see how spicy they can make it though....",02/02/10,208,5,2,5,44,8.1096,4.1899999999999995,0.446,20.364,No,1886

Crab Rangoon was absolutely delicious and the Sweet &amp; Sour sauce was simply amazing.  A must try!!!

The Spicy Basil Chicken did not disappoint.  The vegetables and the chicken tasted fresh.  I enjoyed it very much.

The Tofu Pad Thai was also made with fresh vegetables and was very tasty as well.

The only reason why I did not give 5 stars, is because the dining are is very small, which is not a problem if you pick it up or get it delivered.

I will definitely come back.",24/04/13,63,4,2,4,25,3.9585,2.681,0.0,6.319,No,574

We had the spring rolls that were wrapped in what looked like a tortilla of some sort...not rice paper and they were cut into bite size pieces. The dipping sauce was good but you had to smother the &#34;rolls&#34; to eat. Then we had a chicken wrap which was all rice, some chicken and a 1/8 teaspoon of peanut sauce. I had to use the spring roll dipping sauce to make it edible. The beef and broccoli should have been called &#34;find the beef in this broccoli&#34; and it was bland. Mango sticky rice was ok...compared to everything else anyway.

It&#39;s a very small restaurant and the tables are tiny Between the dishes of food, drinks and bottle of hot sauce and sweet and sour sauce, things on the table got a little precarious. But the service and the food was wonderful so I can overlook that, or else order takeout next time. 

We had the lunch specials--for about $10 you get a small cup of vegetable soup, choice of an egg roll or cucumber salad, and choice of entree with white rice. The soup was good--a peppery flavor and a lot of little bits of celery, carrots, and cabbage. The egg roll was good--nice crunch and very fresh--not to greasy either. I chose the Spicy Basil with chicken. Very good mixture of chicken, basil leaves, mushrooms, baby corn, bell peppers and bamboo shoots. The menu noted that it was spicy. It had a good flavor, but I didn&#39;t find the dish spicy at all. The house sweet chili sauce I added gave the dish the heat I wanted and it was a pretty good tasting sauce as well. Hubsbie had the green curry with chicken--I got to sample a few bites and I liked his dish much better than mine. It had a good amount of heat to it and a peanuty/curry flavor. 

On the smoothie/bubble drink note note, I must say I cannot find ANY bubble smoothie places in this neck of the suburbs so I was very excited to see it on the menu and hoped it would be good. My mango smoothie was OK--I&#39;ve had better. My favorite is still that &#34;joyous&#34; place, but HE&#39;s bubble drinks will be good in a pinch when I&#39;m having a craving and not willing to drive very far.",13/02/10,209,4,3,5,64,6.628200000000001,2.463,0.0,14.536999999999999,No,1777

Not in the mood for meat, I opted for the stuffed pepper and I was not disappointed. The dish is two char-grilled red pepper halves stuffed with portabella mushrooms, roasted corn, other veggies, goat cheese and balsamic. The dish was well-balanced with sweetness from the corn, creamy goat cheese and sharp balsamic. 

To complement the main, the peppers were served on top of a red pepper risotto cooked perfectly.

Two favorite appetizers are the Asian Calamari and the baked goat cheese. The calamari has a really great sweet and sour sauce on it which really makes it different from calamari you would get at another restaurant. 

My three favorite entrees on there menu would have to be the Napa Valley Chicken which comes with a great white wine creme sauce.  The Scallops are some of the best ive had with a great roasted red pepper risotto. Also you can never go wrong with a steak either here which can have special toppings added.

OK - to be absolutely fair - ordering a half rack of ribs at an upscale eatery in an upscale area might seem incorrect.  But I LIKE ribs.  I was in the MOOD for ribs.  And...if they cook even halfway decently...they should be able able to serve an upscale plate at their decidedly upscale prices regardless of what the customer orders.  

The ribs were, in a word; awful.  

Not a hint of smoke, lukewarm, and - quite frankly - seemed like they had done a few laps around the block.  The sauce was sweet and thick, and did nothing to hide the awfulness of the meat underneath.  I have had FAR better at franchise restaurants for far less money.

At these prices, there are far better choices in the area.

During our meal three gentleman stopped by our booth to check on us and see how we were enjoying everything, one was our server and I believe one of the other gentleman was the owner and the other their head chef! It feels wonderful when you are approached and asked how your evening is going, if youre loving the food, and I particularly like that Miguel asked us what brought us out tonight and trying to get a hint if we were celebrating anything special. On our way out we were very warmly wished a good night by several staff and I almost forgot my to-go(how could I!?) and the man who I believe is their head chef noticed and saved me from leaving behind a wonderful piece of meat I planned to heat up and devour later on!

foxfire-geneva,Kevin H.,#NAME?,fga3NYZSHre5s_utuim3fQ,"Let me just say that I wrote a review for Foxfire 4 months ago and gave it 5 stars and truly believed it deserved it at the time. I&#39;ve been going here for about 8 years and have always had a tasty meal. I took my girlfriend there tonight and was shocked to see that they significantly changed their menu and more importantly, made it so that all sides and salads are ala carte. I&#39;ve always felt that Foxfire got penalized (on Yelp) for having slightly higher prices than similar places in the area. I gave them the 5 star review 4 months ago because I wanted to acknowledge that while their prices are a bit higher, they&#39;re food is always on point. Well, after seeing that they removed many of our favorite meals from their menu, they are now charging six dollars for a side and eight dollars for a dinner salad. I ordered a filet ($33) and my girlfriend ordered a new chicken dish (25ish dollars and the only chicken meal on the menu now). We both had one glass of wine and we split a side. That&#39;s it. The bill was about a hundred dollars before tip. Our waitress was fine (staff has always been good) but the cost to get a full meal there is just too much for the area. I will say that the steak was good, they upgraded the quality of their steaks without charging more (which is good considering you were already paying 33 dollars for a 6oz filet). Overall, I was bummed out the whole time I was there, knowing that would be my last time going there after many years of enjoying their food. I&#39;m not sure if they weren&#39;t doing well financially, but this was a very bad move. It was pretty empty for a Saturday night, so in guessing I&#39;m not the only one that feels this way.",09/01/16,182,2,1,3,-4,2.0153,0.853,0.554,13.592999999999998,No,1703

Sat for about 10 minutes before a server came by and then it took a while for our drinks to come - martini and beer.   I ordered the french onion soup - it was good, but it could have been hotter, i have a feeling the waiter didn&#39;t pick it up right away.  It wasn&#39;t that busy, so I&#39;m not sure why service was so slow.  I ordered a beef tenderloin special - each 3 oz piece had a different crust, one blue cheese, one peppercorn, one horseradish - they were all very tasty, good piece of meat however my steaks were cooked to medium when I ordered them cooked to medium rare.  my husband had the steak salad - the salad was fine, but don&#39;t expect much steak, they were puny skewers that, because they were so small, were also over cooked.

I love Foxfire but I was a little disappointed with this visit.  My entree was scallops with red pepper risotto. I have had this entree twice before, and I think my luck ran out with #3.  The scallops were inconsistent, half of them were tender and terrific, the others were chewy, almost like calamari.  They do serve a large portion, so I was fine with leaving a couple on the plate.   The risotto was, as usual, unbelievably good.  Could be the best side I have ever had, anywhere.  So what was the problem?   The portion size was about half what it should have been for this entree.  The scallops are arranged around the risotto and the presentation was pretty bad.  I&#39;m surprised they served it at all, perhaps they ran out?   Fortunately, my daughter have the same side with her entree and couldn&#39;t eat half of the portion served to her, so I ended up with a decent amount.  Must mention that my wife and kids enjoyed their meals, and my son and I each had a bowl of their marvelous French onion soup, just exceptional. 

I&#39;ll leave with my recommendation as very good, but I will probably pass on the scallops next time.",16/04/16,129,4,3,3,53,2.7284,1.9409999999999998,0.9400000000000002,11.118,No,1209

Ambience is very good but burger was disappointing at best (would definitely have given fewer stars if I had paid the full $13 for that burger). That said...I would give them another shot as the rest of the menu had some good looking offerings. Service was nice but very slow and inattentive.

foxfire-geneva,Jocelyn W.,4NHn-M4hxTKeHY687j4qnQ,46Ml1_y0xhxvCxr6zM4qkA,"Terrible experience. I have been told to go here by friends and it was regrettable. I went here for my boyfriend&#39;s 21st birthday with some friends. We went on a day when there was a burger deal so we could avoid their ridiculous prices. 

First off, it took about 20-30 minutes to get our drinks. The server had no empathy, thought was doing a great job. She was terrible. After we finally got our drinks, she left for another 20-30 minutes. This was the patten for the entire evening. The server never once apologized for her terrible service. 

The food was mediocre at best. Everyone got burgers. Nothing to write home about. 

We eventually gave up on ordering drinks because that was too complicated of a task for the server. We ate quickly so we could get out of there but of course when we wanted to pay, the server was no where to be found. When we finally got the checks, she charged us incorrectly so we had to wait for her to grace us with her presence once again. 

Finally we were free from this place after a below average meal, only two rounds of drinks, and terrible service! I will not be returning!",12/06/15,115,1,1,0,-24,-0.8295999999999998,1.442,2.752,13.806000000000001,No,1120
foxfire-geneva,Michael K.,mj1rmmKEkx_fDZDI2XmlaQ,V3UJTPfdYFRIpd_FdVk_yA,"We had a wonderful dinner here a couple of months ago.

Waitress was friendly, on the ball and kept us moving at whatever pace we wanted to dictate.  We dawdled through drinks and apps and then sipped some wine and then kicked into gear when it was time to wrap it up.  She had no problems shifting gears right along with us and I truly appreciate that.

I had a shrimp de jonghe app that might have been the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The shrimp were of good size, and the whole thing was done perfectly with not too much garlic and what I think was parmesan or pecorino cheese, which is a nice touch.  I&#39;ve been back since for drinks/happy hour just to hammer down one of these delectable treats.  If it was a larger portion on the dinner menu I&#39;d order it.  (consider that a submission to your suggestion box, Foxfire)

My other point of interest was the wine.  The wine list is decent for a semi-casual place.  You can find a decent bottle here.  Thing is, we&#39;re kind of winos, so when we blow the roof off for a birthday or something we like amazing 93+ point wines that are sitting in their prime drinking window.  In fact those special occasions are why we buy the really good stuff in the first place and stick it in the cellar for &#39;someday&#39;.  Not having that option takes something away from special occasion dinners for us to the point where we have at times decided to cook at home with a top tier bottle(s) rather than go out.  Foxfire does not go that far with their wine list, and I imagine there just isn&#39;t enough demand to justify stocking all of that expensive grape, BUT their corkage fee is nominal, like 15 bucks or something, so next time we&#39;ll cart our own in and have the best of both worlds.  This really is a nice amenity.  15 bucks to pop and pour a reallly nice bottle out at a restaurant while they do the rest of the cooking?  That&#39;s an attractant for us right there.

Why 4 instead of 5?  Well, it is maybe a bit overcasual for the price point, with the dining area directly adjacent to the bar, so I found myself kind of on the fence about that aspect, but the food was really good, as was the service, and we liked it well enough that we&#39;ll be going back.",11/08/15,237,4,3,5,58,8.8031,3.3680000000000003,0.239,16.393,No,2221
foxfire-geneva,Dan S.,f3jDA5fwCv-GB5DnIZDwhA,wkxqG2Vf5kxB-fNqHp0HFg,"Every time I eat at Fox Fire I have been served some of the best food around. From the dinner rolls upon arrival to the filet mignon to the ahi tuna (and I don&#39;t usually enjoy seafood of any kind) to the Fox Fire Ale on tap (some of the most refreshing local brew I&#39;ve had) to the star of the show -- the Angus Burger -- Fox Fire&#39;s entrees never disappoint. The dessert menu is rather small and I have been underwhelmed more than wowed; but, for your own sake, if you have ever thought you remotely enjoyed a cheeseburger, then you owe it to yourself to grab an Angus Burger. If you&#39;re on a budget, book a reservation on Monday night when the $10 burger goes to $5. There is ZERO dip in quality, I assure you. You can thank me later.

P.S. Their buss staff is one of the most efficient and friendly that I have ever witnessed. The owner/proprietor always makes a point of being on the floor and engages us before we pay or exit each and every time we dine here.

1) Our meal was superb!  I had the FoxFire Filet Medallions; the unique berry sauce was delicious, filet was cooked nicely, flavor was spot on.  Husband ordered prime rib and it was one of the best I&#39;ve tasted.  So tender and deliciously seasoned.  
2) I appreciate that the meal comes with bread and soup or salad and a side.  The bread was warm and amazingly soft.  So yummy! And filling!  Finally, a nice restaurant where not everything is ala carte.
3) The building is unique and beautiful.
4) The gentleman, who I assume is the manager, walked around and checked on all the tables to be sure everything was going well.  He stopped by ours twice in the time we were there.  
5) The wait staff was on their game; we never had to ask for a refill.

The only semi-downside was that we were seated in an obvious less than desirable table.  By the kitchen and by a side &#34;filling&#34; station.  We did make reservations but it was our first visit.  Having worked in a nice restaurant before, I assume if you&#39;re frequent customers, the better your table.  
Our waitress, while she started off friendly, became much less engaged and chipper when we opted not to order drinks or appetizers.

Our server brought everyone&#39;s soup but mine and when I reminded her about it she brought the wrong soup...ugh! I then asked our table of eight if I had failed to mention it when ordering or she forgot. They confirmed, she forgot. Maybe she should try writing down the orders the next time she has a large table.

Then i received my entree (Salmon) and it was the smallest piece of fish I&#39;d ever seen. Way overcooked and downright awful tasting. Luckily I had some snacks back at my hotel room.

I went here on a date with my wife recently. The decor, ambience and atmosphere were wonderful! Really a spectacular interior and very cool, exposed, trendy kitchen. We were dressed up, ready to fork over $100+ for two, so my expectations were high. The waiter was decent but definitely could have checked on us more often. I still tipped him well. He was friendly and helpful when he did show up. We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer. They were not that great. Not bad, but NOTHING to write home about. I&#39;ve had better crab cakes at very casual seafood joints. My wife got shrimp scampi and she said it was good and I got the FoxFire medallions w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The mashed potatoes = same story as the crab cakes. Not that great. Not bad. Not good. Was expecting much, much better though. The steak... was AMAZING. Cooked perfectly medium-rare. Absolutely spectacular steak. The demi-glaze, bleu cheese and cranberry style was unique, original and perfectly executed. Besides the lackluster sides and apps, this place is DEFINITELY the go-to steak spot in the Geneva area, no question about that. I will be back!

We have come before and really enjoyed the food, however tonight was really quite bad. Our waitress, I believe her name was Sam, was erratic, inconsistent and seemed completely unfocused on her job. She also whined and complained loudly about everyone and everything right in front of the whole restaurant. While eating all we could hear was her complaining about how she has been scheduled and that people there still view her as a rookie. In her own words she said she would rather they just fire her if they will always treat her like a rookie. Now her complaints might be totally valid-I don&#39;t know. But I certainly didn&#39;t need to hear her talking about them to her coworkers for my whole meal. 

My soup was amazing, as always. There is no better French onion soup around! My boyfriend also enjoyed his soup of the day. His steak was excellent. 

However, my dish, the frutti di mare was really just awful. It&#39;s a fairly basic dish and this place is steak and seafood so I don&#39;t understand how it could be so badly done. The sauce was flavorless and acidic. Like a can of plain tomato sauce. The mussels were atrocious - they actually felt and tasted like powder. The scallops could&#39;ve been chicken they were so tough and dry. In my opinion, it&#39;s a sin against the entirety of seafood to overcook scallops like that. In addition, the temperature of my dish was all over the place. Some pieces of calamari were ice cold. Some pieces of shrimp were so hot they burned my mouth. After mixing the insanely hot with the very cold my whole dish was basically lukewarm. Extremely disappointing for a birthday dinner. 

Didn&#39;t even get a chance to finish my wine and pick at the noodles before our waitress came and boxes up my pasta even though my boyfriend was only halfway through his steak and I had plenty of mediocre food left. Big party at the back got all the staffs attention and we left displeased.

Atmosphere: it was actually really nice. It wasn&#39;t congested or overly loud. The place was clean and had space so you didn&#39;t feel crowded. It has a nice warm cozy feel about it. 

Service: the host was really nice a mid aged young gentleman with glasses on was friendly and seated us immediately we came in for a late lunch/early dinner. 

Our waitress was on the verge of being really bored of working and slightly annoyed with us.  When I state annoyed with us I mean when we asked questions related to the menu she seemed annoyed that we were even asking.  When we also asked to see the dessert menu she literally tossed/threw it on the table. Overall I think she was rude and she does not need to be in a job where she deals with people. She also rarely came back to the point we were always grabbing another waitress or yelling across the restaurant to get her attention which I am sure annoyed other diners (which was slightly embarrassing). 

Food: Ok I think I may have just ordered the wrong things but one thing I would recommend you do NOT order is the salmon salad. The lettuce was disgusting and close to mushy and the salmon has the wrong taste it wasn&#39;t rancid but overcooked and it did not taste fresh. 

I had the cauliflower soup and it was supposed to be a cream of soup it was runny and watered down with little flavour. Dessert was just kind of frozen tasting-like frozen chocolate cake. 

What my friend ordered was really delicious looking and she stated it was really good. And the other food from other tables I saw flying by looked very delicious I think I just ordered all the wrong things :(. 

I gave it three stars because the service by our excuse for a server was piss poor at best and because all 3 items that I personally ordered were ok to fair.To be fair I think I will come back on a different day and try again and see if maybe they were just having an off day. I really hope they were as I kind of really liked the atmosphere of this place.

Our server was actually bad, because she did not follow through with promises. If you say you will get more bread, do not make us ask for more 10 minutes later. If every one has empty water glasses at the start of the meal; do not ask if any one needs water refills. Service rated 1 star on this visit.

Most of the food we had was mediocre, or downright awful.

Appetizers - shrimp cocktail was ok
                    mussels were awful. Overcooked, too small, and a waste of money.
                    the sauce the mussels came in was outstanding, and we ate it on
                     the bread as a makeshift appetizer. This was when we were brought
                     bread refills

Entrees - Signature rib dinners were not so special. Dry, overcooked ribs, with a 
                peculiar bbq sauce poured on top. Presentation was poor.
                Cajun ribeye sandwich had no flavor and the meat was tough. Cajun
                to me means spicy. Not here.
                French onion soup had the perfect mix of bread and cheese. It is
                unfortunate, however, because the soup was so salty it was inedible.
                The au gratin potatoes, which I loved before, tasted like fish. Something
                was definitely off this evening. 

When a restaurant charges high end prices, say 30 to 40 dollars for entrees, one expects attentive service as well as a high level of quality of the food.

Sadly, we received poor food, with even worse service. There are better alternatives in the tri cities that we will exhaust before we return here. This restaurant seems to be resting on its past reputation. No effort seemed to be made to create a superior dish, properly cooked, seasoned, and presented.

That left me with a sour taste in my mouth to start the day, but I left feeling fantastic, so that tells you something about how awesome this place is. Our waitress was kind, courteous, and helpful (pressing us to order just moments before the party of 30 was perhaps the most helpful thing a waitress has ever done in my experience). 

The atmosphere is what you might expect at a relatively pricy steak house. You get the feeling of being high class, but not without being accessible. It&#39;s a surprisingly urban spot in the far outskirts of the suburbs. 

As far as the food goes, I&#39;ve usually only had burgers and steaks here, which are -- understandably -- delicious. Last night I decided to branch out and try a a Cajun tuna which was almost certainly the best tuna I&#39;ve had in my life.

My wife had the Salmon Alfredo which she thoroughly enjoyed although it had a few too many noodles compared to the other ingredients.

I usually try a filet mignon when ever I&#39;m at a steak place.  This time I tried the Filet Oscar.  I loved it.  the asparagus bed was crisp the filet was juicy and cooked to a pefect medium.  It was all topped with a creamy sauce and a crab cake.

The service too was attentive.  Even though they were getting busy near the end of our stay, our waitress was still attentive and yet not too pushy for us to clear the table.

The only reason this is 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the price.  $23 for the Salmon Alredo and $36 for the Filet Oscar.  Not bad but just a tad higher than our normal fare.",09/01/11,128,4,1,4,3,3.8533000000000004,2.937,0.61,16.453000000000003,No,1172

The filet was scrumptious and perfectly cooked. The au gratin potatoes were wonderful as well - sliced very thinly and not overcooked. The white chocolate raspberry cheescake I had for desert was my least favorite part of the meal, though it was very tasty. I felt it paled in comparison to my friend&#39;s flourless chocolate cake.

foxfire-geneva,Julie K.,x0lyiHkbwwjWj10cdWZA5Q,5CF8kVMPv0kSiNg3e076Tw,"Our first experience to Foxfire in Geneva was on Saturday, we had an early evening reservation.
The server didn&#39;t come to our table at first, but when he finally did, he was attentive.  I ordered a glass of wine and it was a nice pour - not skimpy.  We ordered the Asian Calamari appetizer and it was very tasty.  He did not rush us for our dinner orders.  Dinners are on average $24 (unless you order a pasta).  We were there for steaks.  The menu has a good explanation of how to order your steak in terms of rare to well done.  You can also upgrade and buy a sauce for your steak.  We both ordered ribeyes, which come with a starch and small salad.  They could do better on the wimpy salad - but they want you to buy an &#34;upgrade&#34; for $5.  Some sides and veges are also extra $.  I am starting to feel nickled and dimed about now.  Steaks were about half-inch thick, tasty and cooked to order.  They were busy that night and maybe trying to save a minute or two off the cooking time - but that didn&#39;t effect our steaks which were very tasty and juicy.  We ordered dessert, but it would have been nice to see a dessert tray.  Skip the 7-layer chocolate cake - a little dry and just so so.      

The tables are set along the one wall.  Several tables are in front (along the bar area, but elevated and separated by a railing) then 4 booths are across from the open-kitchen/serving station (where we sat) and more tables in back.  There is a back door into the restaurant and thank goodness we weren&#39;t seated at those tables - the people walking in and out would be very distracting!  Especially if you are dropping $100 to $150 for dinner for 2.

Wish they would include more with their entrees (simple sauces, veges, etc) instead of making you pay extra and they could easily make a better salad without charging extra - such an easy thing to do.  I think they are trying to be high-end and the entrees don&#39;t reflect that kind of restaurant.",09/04/12,215,3,1,4,-15,3.4867,1.324,0.179,20.497,No,1967

Had french onion soup and salad with vodka vinagrette which were very good.  We both ordered ribeyes and shared a side of mushrooms which were excellent.

There was a salad dish, veggie samosas, 6 veggie sides (masala, yogurt, curry, saag based), and 2 meat dishes. They also serve fresh roasted red chicken, on a hot plate with onions (which I believe is typical for lunch buffets) and hot naan, both that they bring to the table. The manager (?) there checked in every once in a while to make sure everything was good or if we needed more water. Everything was very tasty and flavorful- the buffet looks small but I typically like smaller buffets because then you know they make it fresh everyday and it gives it a homey feel. Not that I have anything against large buffets, but I feel like making food in smaller batches gives it good quality control. For dessert there was a sweet carrot item (that my friends really enjoyed) and gulab jamun.

My Indian food palate isn&#39;t refined enough to tell you what exactly it is about the food here that makes it less delicious than some other Indian places I frequent, but I can tell you that it has a certain sweetness to it. And maybe even an anise/licorice flavor. Maybe it&#39;s a different region than I usually eat but it just seemed off. All of it. 

We got a Butter Chicken, a Chicken Tikka Masala, some garlic naan, and an order of the Aloo Ghobi...our usual try out foods for any new Indian place. I will say this...the standout of our entire meal was the garlic naan. It was HUGE. We ordered 4 orders (one naan an order) thinking they&#39;d be smaller. Big mistake. Each naan is the size of two regular pancakes stuck together. No wonder they were $2.50 each. Sheesh. Needless to say, there&#39;s a couple of leftover naan in the fridge as we speak. Other than the carbs though? Everything else was just okay. The food comes with a ton of sauce (which is great to dip your naan in!) but not a lot of meat. And the meat you do get is somehow really dry. Even the vegetables were just alright and had a different flavor to them than usual. At least it came nice and spicy (white girl spicy, that is) even when ordering it mild. I could even go medium here but surely the hot would burn my mouth off. Be warned. 

Overall, this is a good Indian place, but it&#39;s not great. Guess I have to keep searching for &#34;the one&#34;. Oh well.",28/08/15,188,3,2,2,32,1.3007,2.708,2.4010000000000002,21.893,No,1537

They should probably expand their space and get some seating for the guys who are waiting - we had like 3 different groups waiting before us and two after us. Everyone went to walgreens nearby :p

Once seated, I thought the service and staff both were really good. We got some papad w/chutney as complementary. We got the cilantro chciken tikka sizzler as appetizer. Even though, it was SIZZLING it tasted good. We got the butter naan ( 4 pc) with Butter chicken masala - which by far tasted the best among probably about 10 other indian restaurants I have visited in the NW suburbs of chicago. We got the chicken briyani - which had a lot of chicken - which was super cooked and tasted good.

Since we cook our own Indian food at home, and love it, I was hesitant but willing. Since he is from London and use to the curry shops there, I trusted his judgement on this one and we were not let down. We tried the Lamb Korma and the Chicken Tikka Masala. Since I did not have control of the spices, I had my korma served medium, and his tikka was served hot. Both complimented each other favorably. The lamb was so tender, it was easily cut with a fork. There was a generous amount of gravy in our pots for dipping as well. The meal came with quite enough rice, which by the way was cooked perfectly. We ordered the butter naan and the garlic naan- again - plenty for both of is and delicious. 

The decor was lovely, not at all like a typical London curry shop- which was a pleasant surprise to my husband. After all, it&#39;s not about the decor, it&#39;s about the taste. And this one past his stringent test.. 
Since this is the only Indian Restaurant I have visited in the Chicago area - I am 5 starring it and setting the bar high.

I had to go back &amp; ask for rice again.  I&#39;d already paid for our food, and before leaving, I asked the woman who&#39;d taken my money if there was rice in the order.  That stopped the transaction dead in its tracks.  She had to go to the kitchen and get approval to add rice to the order.

My second visit was a weekday evening.   First good sign was that there were a lot of Indian families at the restaurant.    I was my usual party of one so they sat me in an area away from the families which was nice.

This time I had two orders of the butter naan which more than satisfied the bread order.   I this time ordered the Shrimp Korma along with an appetizer of veggie samosas (still looking for a good keema...sigh) and basmati rice.   I also had an order of mango lassi which I thought was a little more room temperature than I would&#39;ve liked.   Also thought I could&#39;ve used more rice (though maybe I have to do two orders of that as well).   Barely had enough rice for the leftovers the next day.

The onion kulcha was very greasy, and the onions used were quite sharp/bitter, not the usual sweet, mild onions usually found in onion kulcha.  Actually, this was the first time that we didn&#39;t want to save our leftovers in the fridge.  With the overall change in quality and flavor, we&#39;re disappointed.

I ordered the Butter Chicken - Chicken cooked in heavenly tomato and creamy sauce and came with rice; Butter Naan  - Traditional Indian break baked in clay oven with butter, Kadai Chicken - Chicken cooked with fresh onion, tomato, green pepper and traditional Indian spices; and Vegetable Samosa - Vegetable Patties turnovers stuffed potatoes, peas, and spices.

Everything I ordered tasted perfect.  The Butter Chicken had enough spice to it since most Butter Chicken is cooked without any kick to it, the Butter Naan was heavenly.  When biting in to the bread, it was just like walking on clouds.  I haven&#39;t had Naan as awesome as theirs in a long time.  The Kadai Chicken was also cooked to perfection.  The chicken was moist with the perfect amount of spices added to it.  As for the Samosa, it couldn&#39;t have been any better than any other Samosas I&#39;ve eaten.

Only complaint is they placed me by the window and I bet it was in the 50&#39;s where I was sitting.  Then I went there today for the same.  There was a sign on the window that said no lunch specials today.  Dang.  I went in to ask when they would have them again and they said never.  Double dang.  Well I didn&#39;t feel like paying more money for less variety so I took off.  I then went to go a couple miles down the road to Himalayan.  That place is gone!  Triple dang!  It&#39;s just not my day.

Edit:  So they brought back the lunch specials they told me they weren&#39;t going to have anymore.  It&#39;s like it was before, but doesn&#39;t come with the chicken tandoori anymore, which is a shame since it was really good.  You get filled up for 7 bucks though so it&#39;s still a good deal.",03/01/13,104,4,1,1,-13,0.21089999999999998,1.129,1.371,16.5,No,988

mast-masala-hanover,William B.,t-QRWAHVazoHiSaaBSXJKA,yxDAV5ghaYK9TtMNxyTcGw,"Its been quite a while since I&#39;ve branched out to try any new indian cuisine in the area, but  since my family&#39;s favorite local place for indian food has closed (those who know), we will now be on a quest to find a new favorite.  I don&#39;t know how long Mast has been around, but it appears fairly new.
Mast Masala was recommended by a friend (oops, I didn&#39;t yelp search first), and Mast didn&#39;t disappoint.  
Upon first experience, I was impressed.  Mast appears to be a nice, small, clean place.  Everything we ordered seemed very freshly prepared.  Compared to the typical diners of indian cuisine, we eat early enough to qualify for the early bird special.  Place was dead when we arrived.  Some would see this as a bad sign, but the typical diner usually eats later in the evening.  Plus, with the kids, we feel its easier on us, the kids, and the wait staff if we get in and out early before a place gets hectic. 
When we try a new place, we like to first try the old standbys to compare.  However, we deviated a little this time.  We usually get a vegetable pakora to start, but got the pakora platter this time, which had both paneer (cheese) &amp; vegetable pakora.  The vegetables we more of a hash brown, or blended veggie patty, instead of individual fried veggies- very tasty.  The paneer had a green, spicy sauce inside; also very tasty, and 2 of the 3 kids approved.
For main courses, we tried the chicken tikka &#34;sizzler&#34;.  A little different than We are used to, closer to a regular tandoori chicken, but still good, none the less.  Our usual saucy dish was hijacked by our daughter.  She usually just lets us order, as we all share, and we know what everyone likes.  But she decided to open a menu and pick something out, so we went with it.  She chose the chicken curry.  It was very good.  Different, as we typically get a tomato sauce based dish.  As the description says, this has a traditional sauce.  I would order it again, though would probably want to make the rounds on the menu first just to try different things.  We also ordered the mutter paneer, which is a vegetarian dish of peas &amp; paneer in a creamy sauce.  We ordered everything mild, as we didn&#39;t know what we were getting nito, and didn&#39;t want to turn off the kids.  The mutter paneer was so mild, it was almost sweet.  We would probably order this spicier next time.  We had to order 3 full entrees since everything is a la carte, which raised the price we are used to for the cuisine.  We do like the places that offer a &#39;thali&#39; as it provides enough side dishes that we don&#39;t have to order more entrees.  But I suppose the kids are getting older, and they get more expensive to feed.
As we were finishing our meal, every table was full and there were several groups waiting for tables.
We will probably be back.  As we try more of their menu, I can foresee I will likely raise their rating.",11/02/13,361,4,2,5,34,6.151000000000001,3.6329999999999996,0.643,30.723999999999997,No,2929

The torta is another of my favorite foods from this establishment ($3.90). It comes in a soft, fluffy, warm sub-style bread. A hefty size. Doesn&#39;t taste like cardboard. You can pick the meat, and the other fillings are beans, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and avocado slices.

Tostadas are good too, toppings piled high with avocado pieces on top (~$2.90). Their small burrito is $2.90, but it&#39;s a lot of food. Gorditas are good as well. Tamale was okay. It was my first time trying an horchata and since I have a sweet tooth, the taste was such a pleasant surprise. A milky sweetness with some cinnamon. Definitely a dessert and treat for me, especially great on a hot summer day.

UPDATE June &#39;14 - I&#39;m not sure if they have the $1 taco specials anymore because the menu board doesn&#39;t list it. Tacos are $1.55, on the small side, still tasty. Nice neighborhood taco joint.",05/10/11,137,4,3,5,60,4.175800000000001,3.63,0.502,11.867999999999997,No,1007

Having noticed that no one in the staff looked familiar, I inquired and learned that they had changed ownership. It would appear that the new owners bought the rights to the name and the physical location, but did not acquire any of the secrets to the &#34;old&#34; Jalisco flavors and friendliness. I&#39;m sure that it is not a coincidence that the unfavorable reviews begin after the first few months of 2014 - the new owners appear to have taken over at that time.

The sour cream was run of the mill.  As far as the guacamole goes, I&#39;ve had better.  There was no lime flavor, and too much salt and the chips were stale.

The prices are a-ok with me though, I ordered a side of rice, guacamole, and a large horchata for like $6. Sweet.

Both times I&#39;ve been to francesca&#39;s I&#39;ve experienced this. I ordered the Alaskan halibut the first time. This was the best fish I&#39;ve ever had. It was prepared with creamy polenta and a sauce that made it&#39;s $30 price tag worth every dollar. I went back specifically for this dish and to my disappointment it wasn&#39;t on the menu. I ordered the seabass with mushrooms and leak sauce. Holy Christ. This chef is amazing!!!!!!!!  Again the flavors worked together so well. The fish didn&#39;t have any hint of that ugly fishiness. It was perfect. 

The first time the staff was a little creepy. They were all lines up on the back wall staring at everyone eating and talking amongst themselves.

I&#39;d heard great things about this restaurant and was always curious when driving by, so last night I finally made a reservation and ate there. We started with drinks from the bar, which tasted fine but had too much ice and not enough of the actual cocktail. 

For dinner, we started with the risotto appetizer. I LOVE risotto, but hated this one. It had very little taste aside from the goat cheese, which I wasn&#39;t a fan of. I ordered the Penne Alle Verdure, which was again lacking in taste and very underwhelming. I thought to myself &#34;I could totally make this myself at home for way less money&#34;.  My boyfriend had the roasted chicken and my friend had a gluten free pasta. My boyfriend did like his dish and my friend said hers was okay, but nothing special.

Our service was good. He was timely and pretty friendly. The food came fast and he accommodated my friend&#39;s gluten allergy. No complaints there!

Upon arrival our water glasses were filled right away but it took quite a while or the servers to come by and take drink orders (10 minutes after we sat down). After that initial slowness all the service was quick and very gracious.  The water glasses were promptly filled each time and each food course came out quickly.

Each table dined family style from the pre-selected catering menu and we had: minestrone soup, dinner salad, rigatoni in a creamy tomato sauce w/parmesan, Pollo arrosto alla Romana (rosemary/lemon chicken w/potatoes - delicious!), Italian sausage w/bell peppers &amp; onions, and for dessert cream puffs filled with vanilla ice cream &amp; topped with chocolate sauce (children had cups of ice cream rather than risk them dealing with the slippery cream puffs that would certainly have ended up on the floor otherwise).  Everything was good and there was plenty of food for each table but the chicken dish was the stand out with that delicious sauce.  The warm Italian bread on the table was very good, as well.

Visited again for our anniversary dinner and food was pretty good. We had the carpaccio to start; I thought it was good and I enjoyed the addition of endive and radicchio however I thought the steak was almost cut too thing where it didn&#39;t hold up amongst the mushrooms/lemon/caper mix.

As soon as I walked in I was greeted pleasantly and had nothing but outstanding customer service during my entire visit.

We began with a drink at the bar and our bartender Rene (who also ended up being our server) was extremely personable.

I ordered the Rigatoni alla Norcina, a pasta with sausage, pancetta, and three cheese sauce.  The pancetta made the dish!  It was much better than the Gnocci A&#39;Emilliana that I had eaten previously at their other location.  Someone in our party ordered the gnocchi and the portion was quite small just as it was at the St. Charles location.  He was finished eating significantly sooner than the rest of us and seemed disappointed in his portion.

I love that they box up your leftovers for you!",02/01/16,88,4,1,1,7,0.6274,0.786,0.34299999999999997,7.871,No,871

The service was absolutely great - I loved our waiter. He was polite, patient, attentive, and very accommodating. The food was also delicious. My favorite was the Rigatoni alla Siciliana and the Pizza alla Schiacciata alla Toscana. The rigatoni was the perfect amount of spice and flavor; the lemon on the pizza added the perfect touch to the truffle oil and parmesan cheese flavors. It was a bit too much mozzarella cheese for my personal taste but I enjoyed it nonetheless. We also got the bruschetta and the asparagus salad, which I thought was alright. The bruschetta was a bit more goat cheese than actual tomatoes.

Parking lot is smaller but there&#39;s complimentary valet, which is an upside. This was my first time here as I&#39;ve been to Francesca&#39;s N. only both on Taylor street and in Northbrook. This is under the same restaurant umbrella. Same menu layout and concept and a small selection of fresh, quality food. All are equally delicious. 

They write their menu, so you know the items sometimes change. The menu is small and not overwhelming. Service was excellent and the food was unreal, shut-the-front-door, out of this world. You get unlimited hot table side bread. You can order custom scratch made pizza-what my friend ordered. 

Probably some of the best ravioli I&#39;ve had in quite a while. It was Ravioli Alla Sorella. That sauce, made with wine, and light scratch made ravioli elevated the dish. A touch of spinach, red peppers, and pieces of chicken, is a dish worth the while. Rich yet light and flavorful.

They serve great food, even rotating their menu every so often which helps change things up. I absolutely love their gnocchi, so get it while you can because it often sells out when they do have it. They serve bread with oil and cheese when you first arrive, and their menu is filled with great pastas, pizzas, and salads. I also recommend following up with some tiramisu or other yummy Italian dessert they serve, because they are good :). The only thing is they have paper on top of their tables, mostly because they give crayons to kids to let them color on it, but it takes away from the fancy, intimate feel of the restaurant.

In the are, searched Yelp for a nice spot. Lacks a little bit of everything from service to food. Not impressed at all with the atmosphere, decor is nice but no ambiance if you arrive before the dinner rush. It felt like we were just a practice run at 5 pm. Staff was either lingering or walking around in the dining as if they had not opened yet. Our server was friendly but smelled like he just finished a cigarette and was awkward and not very well trained, no polish. Caprese salad in an Italian restaurant deserves way more than the presentation and flavor offered. Pasta side with a basic garlic oil, spinach, tomato toss was so al dente it was more like not done and salty beyond edible. We eat out a lot and enjoy fine casual dining, almost always have dessert with a cup of coffee, even when we are stuffed.

Today I joined a group of coworkers at the bar (around 4 pm, not one other customer inside there except our group of 9 ladies) to celebrate a birthday. The waiter we had at first was the douchebaggiest snarky punk A-HOLE I have ever encountered.  We decided to order some appetizers about 15 minutes after we sat down and asked if we could have a menu. He said- (I shit you not) &#34;you said when you got here you didn&#39;t need any menus! I&#39;ll be over in a bi.t&#34; and continued to roll silverware for the next 3 minutes. He got our group of 9 people ONE menu. We asked for more and he brought us only one more.  Honestly? It&#39;s like he was trying to be jerky.

Then, to place our appetizer orders we had to basically drag him away again from what he was working on and he started walking away and I had to shout my order as he was rushing from the table. If I was a manager at this restaurant and witnessed how rude he was to us, I would have fired him on the spot. We are all reasonable, kind people and are teachers and definitely understand if it is super busy or something but being downright rude for the sake of being a snarky jerk? Absolutely not. Most of us were pretty upset by him and said we didn&#39;t want to come back here because of his behavior. 

However, I did give this place 2 stars because it must have been the end of his shift and the guy that took over was super sweet and wonderful and the pizza tasted really good. Due to our awful treatment, I won&#39;t be back.",09/04/14,158,2,1,0,4,-0.011300000000000143,2.02,1.1400000000000001,13.839999999999998,No,1580

They allowed me to make changes easily to the menu, and made it clear they could handle last minute changes like a gluten issue easily as well. Julie gave lots of impute and helped us with decoration ideas as well.  My emails were responded to quickly, and put up with my 50 questions! 

On the day of everyone helped us bring in our decorations, introduced themselves, and doubled checked the menu and timing of service. They were OUTSTANDING!

If you&#39;ve been to other Francesca&#39;s restaurants, the food is consistant, traditional, and oh so yummy. There were a few things, however, that really stood out to me and why I&#39;ll always consider going to a Francesca&#39;s for a small event like a baby shower:

* they don&#39;t charge for the room reservation!!! Literally every other place that we looked at either had a minimum number of people (20 or more) or charged at least $150 for the 3 hour event. When Julie, the coordinator, told me that they only charged us for the food we ate (and of course tax and gratuity), I was sold!

* the variety of menu options for our event was great! We could do a family style, sit down plated, or (what we chose) a buffet appetizer course. They had a variety of menu options as well as a variety of price points, based on the quantity of food and how long the service lasted. Their special events options made it so easy to find an option for us! 

* the appetizer buffet was perfect for our baby shower of 13 people! We started with passed appetizers of chicken skewers while we stood around and chatted. When we sat down, we had a buffet of white pizza (delicious!!), bruschetta, and a risotto. I loved that they charged us per person, but refilled the buffet as many times as we needed during the hour of food that we paid for. AND we got to take home anything that was left! When our food time was finished, they just left it out for us to nibble on while we chatted and opened presents. Not only was the food delicious, but no one left hungry.

* I left Julie know that we had one of the guests who was allergic to gluten. They were AMAZING with providing us with gluten-free options for every piece of the meal! They provided gluten free bread, a small plate of gluten free bruschetta (which they kept refilling!) and one of the pizzas was made gluten free as well! All this, with no extra charge to the event!

* one word...doughnuts! Francesca&#39;s is affiliated with Glazed and Infused and we were able to order a tray of 50 mini doughnuts for $35! They have a variety of doughnuts including maple bacon (yum!!!), pumpkin chocolate chip (a seasonal but very yummy), and even did a gluten free for our guest that is allergic to gluten! Although you have to ask for the option, it&#39;s a great way to get something different!

Very Italian in this approach. Pasta portions are large as you would expect but not Maggiano&#39;s size. However, most pasta dishes are done with a few fresh ingredients and I really appreciate the chefs deft hand. They have an eggplant and mozzarella cheese pasta dish that is quite outstanding. It&#39;s vegetarian friendly but there are of course several meat dishes that are quite good. Appetizers and salads are a bit pricey however the salad themselves usually have some high-end ingredients and my experience is that they are fresh and served quite cold which I appreciate so despite the higher cost it&#39;s well done and worth it. Entrees can range in price so if you are looking to either split a pasta or eat on the cheap you can order some of the lower priced pasta entrees.

The menu has a select number of meal choices, but it is a good variety and we have never been disappointed.  I am a vegetarian, and I have not had trouble finding something on the menu to eat.  Our waitress was attentive, but also embraced the Italian spirit of &#34;relaxing with wine&#34; for a while before ordering, and I did not get the sense that I was either rushed or forgotten.  

My meal was absolutely delicious.  I got some pasta dish with mushrooms, artichokes and goat cheese, and it was so tasty.  Their sauce is mouth-wateringly flavorful.  We also had wine, which was wonderful.  Very smooth and flavorful.  It was the Avalon Cabernet.  The tiramisu was perhaps the best part, although everything was so delicious it is hard to say what was the best part.  Anyways, the tiramisu was not too sweet, but sweet enough so that the subtle hints of the cocoa came through.  The ladyfingers were soaked in the rum and espresso, but not saturated.

+ They also have a bar area if you&#39;re interested.
+ Great service!  Waitress was friendly/attentive.  She had perfect timing checking us.  Neither intrusive nor &#34;missing in action&#34;.  Just perfect.  
+ More top notch service: Bus boys were super friendly and attentive. Plates cleared right away, water and drinks refilled, etc.
+ Food was served after appropriate wait time at perfect temperature.
+ Clean restaurant and clean bathrooms.

- Rather expensive:
Husband had RAVIOLI TRADIZIONALI (ravioli) , I had GIAMBERI e CAPESANTE al VINO BLANCO (shrimp and scallops in white wine and sauteed spinach).  Ordered soup (extra charge) and pasta in red sauce (extra charge).  For drinks we had Perrier water and Diet Coke.  Total bill was $65 + tip.  

Did not mind the cost because we had great service and delicious food!

Tip:  By 7PM, the restaurant got crowded.  Patrons were groups of friends, families having a nice dinner, or couples.  Make early reservations if you want a little more peace and quiet.

The expectations weren&#39;t really met although I wouldn&#39;t say that I wouldn&#39;t come back either. The portions were large and at a good price.

The bruschetta appetizer is a bit small for the price but is done relatively well, especially the choice of cheese. I wish the mussels they offered used the Prince Edward Island variety but that doesn&#39;t seem to be too common around Chicagoland. The broth was pretty good but not great.

I found their &#34;prime rib&#34; (steak) to be prepared in a very oily manner with an herb mixture that I didn&#39;t really like too much, similar to the one at Wildfire. The meatball sandwich had pretty good meatballs and crispy bread but the salad was a little heavy handed on the balsamic vinegar. Their creamy pasta was kind of excessively creamy and oily while their broth and vegetables one had an alright taste but was a bit too oily as well.

Fortunately their profiteroles were delicious and both crunchy and creamy at the same time.

Oddly, like some other restaurants I&#39;ve gone to recently I found the appetizers and desserts to be better than the main entrees. This restaurant is a decent alternative to Biaggis although it gets busy pretty early so make sure you put in a reservation. I would give it a higher rating if they could preserve the taste without making the food so unhealthy with oil and salt.",25/01/11,157,3,2,4,35,3.5162,2.139,0.585,10.276,No,1482

The wait staff was excellent - quickly seated, specials explained, drinks and warm bread served, and orders neatly delivered.  As an added bonus, there was free valet parking in their parking lot at this location.

While were there for dinner on a Saturday night, and the place was hopping busy - so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time.  

Patrons were attired in an interesting mixture of casual to dressy.  Really you could wear whatever you want, and you would feel perfectly at ease.  

This is a fantatic place for date night - celebrate a special occasion in their private rooms - or just to get a fantastic Italian meal.  No matter the reason, you&#39;re sure to enjoy!

The room has a slight Old World, rustic Italian feel with modern touches.  Tables are covered in butcher paper that lend to the relaxed feel, yet the surrounding room decor keeps the place classy.

And the food...ooohhh, the food.  Excellent!  Wonderful!  Authentic!  Delicioso!  The spinach ravioli my friend ordered was handmade and melt in your mouth tender.  The rigatoni her husband ordered was equally fine and perfectly matched with light sausage ragu.  The pan seared tilapia I ordered was perfection and mouthwatering good.  Drinks were enjoyed by all, and they were tasty and well made, including uniquely Italian options.  And yes, we were tempted by desserts!  The Creme Brule was excellent...but the Tiramasu was out of this world!

I ordered one of the specials (of which I can not recall the name and they do not post the specials online).  It was some sort of hand rolled ravioli like pasta with a meat filling and a non-red sauce.  It was very tasty.  The service was good but seemed to taper off after our food arrived.

Until 2:30 am came along and I was purging what was left of that food.  So while it was tasty, no amount of tasty would be worth the very uncomfortable morning and following day I experienced.

I cannot say enough positive words about my experience at Francesca&#39;s Tavola. I urge everyone to ignore any negative reviews because my experience with this restaurant was like a dream.

I reserved a party room for a family member&#39;s surprise party, months in advance. Not only was the Events Coordinator, Julie, immensely helpful... she went above and beyond to answer all of my many questions, and she allowed us to tour the space beforehand. The staff allowed us to store our cake in the cooler on the day of the event, and they did not charge a plating or cutting free. Julie&#39;s kindness, attention to detail, and professionalism will always be remembered. I highly recommend Francesca&#39;s for any birthday, party, or event in which a private party room is required.

Julie&#39;s incredible service was absolutely reflected in the service and atmosphere of the restaurant as whole. The space is beautiful and pristinely clean. Servers were friendly, and the bussers here were, no exaggeration, the kindest, most thoughtful, and talented busboys I have ever encountered. One amazing busboy (whose name escapes me! Possibly Renee?) asked if we would like something to drink as we were setting up, he helped us put up a banner, he brought out a lighter for the cake and cut perfect pieces, and he wrapped all of desserts up for us to take home.

The food was amazing. I highly recommend the risottos and Pollo al Limone (that sauce was incredible). All of the courses were spaced out nicely and never overlapped, which I appreciated since it enabled us to use the full time in the room. The tiramisu and profiteroles for dessert were delectable. Our party had 32 people, and this room was the perfect size. 

I cannot thank Julie and the staff of Francesca&#39;s enough for their assistance and genuine kindness. Props to the chef for his amazing creations. And the bus boys here deserve a promotion or at least major special notice-- we were all blown away. Francesca&#39;s is highly recommended, and I will definitely return when I am in town.

It was one of her favorite places and I had never been there before and always up for trying new places for me. Made reservations and had no issues getting seated. The staff  was very friendly. The food was delicious as well. The atmosphere was also very warm and appealing. My one issue was when it came to dessert. I had called the restaurant a couple days ahead and asked if they had any traditions or did anything special for someone&#39;s birthday. I was told they did and they even verified my reservations and asked what my girlfriend&#39;s name was. So I was pretty set in thinking they were going to surprise her with the birthday dessert. Alas, that never happened. At the completion of dinner our server came by with the dessert menu and asked if we saved room. I was waiting for the birthday dessert. Nothing. So we went about our way. I wanted it to be a surprise so I didn&#39;t even bother to pursue it. To me, it would just simply ruin the surprise element for her to see me ask when it was set up in advance. Fortunately, my girlfriend did appreciate the gesture when I explained to her afterwards how disappointed I was with that happening (or not happening). I should have excused myself to go to the bathroom and followed up before dinner was over, but was convinced it was already a done deal. It&#39;s a minor mistake in the big scheme of things, but a bummer in celebrating her birthday at dinner. Outside of that, it&#39;s a nice place to frequent.

The hostess told me, &#34;There&#39;s a ton of people coming in five minutes with reservations,&#34; so we went to sit by the bar. 10 minutes went by and not a person came in. All of a sudden, the hostess grabbed us and seated us at one of the many empty booths. Hoorah... one success.

I ordered a chicken dish which had some garlic sauce with it. I asked for it without, as I get very sick from garlic, and sure enough it arrived floating in the garlic sauce. It almost seemed like they went out of their way to put extra. Even my family, who usually pick on me for being so picky, thought it was ridiculous. I couldn&#39;t eat my dinner, and the waitress didn&#39;t even ask why when she came to pick it up.

We hadn&#39;t been to Francesca&#39;s since 2006 when one of their waiters spilled wine all over my expensive handbag that was a gift from my grandparents. They never offered any compensation, not even a free coffee or dessert, but my mom was craving their chicken after all this time.

The place was about half full - I sat at a tall table in the bar - no bartender was present, but they were using the bar to serve food if desired. Service was a little off - it seemed like their bus staff was serving that day. Nice people, but I didn&#39;t get the sense that they knew service. This was magnified when I asked for some grated cheese not in my rigatoni entree, but into the olive oil plate for my bread. Well, the server stacked it at least two inches high!

The decor was a little different - a copper top ceiling in the bar that I&#39;d not seem anything like it before. They were playing 80&#39;s music - really?

I guess I&#39;d go there again - maybe for dinner to see if they have an A-Team that works at night. Not really like any other Francesca&#39;s I&#39;ve been to before.",30/10/11,93,3,2,1,12,0.9190999999999998,0.958,0.36,8.682,No,875

I usually meet friends here because I lnow the GF menu is extensive, and no mater my mood there is something for me!   However gluten-free should still be tasty. Not bland and uneatable; covering the whole thing with garlic didn&#39;t make it better. 

This is the first time I have ever been disappointed at Francesca&#39;s.  I usually love it!! Something was way off the evening we were there.   It was not crowded as it was the start of spring break in Arlington Heights.  There were empty tables. As well as chairs available at the bar.

The first time the service was awesome and the food was quite good.  I had the gnocchi with tomato basil sauce and it was awesome.  My hubby had pasta with pot roast which was ok and we had the apple crostata for dessert which was amazing.  This visit was on a Sunday and I guess it was busier than they expected because less than 2 hours after they opened they were out of both of our first choice dishes and also my second choice dish.

The second visit wAs on a Monday and I got rigatoni with sausage and mushrooms.  It was ok, nothing special.  The many reason I ordered it was because nothing else on the menu sounded good to me or was food that I eat (I don&#39;t like mussels, scallops, or veal).  My husband ordered the lasagna which was what we both originally wanted to order when we first went.  When the lasagna was brought out it was totally burnt so we sent it back.  Then a new one came out and the center of it wasn&#39;t even hot.  We also ordered the apple crostata again because I had liked it so much the first time, but that wasn&#39;t nearly as good as it had been on the first visit.

Overall, will I be back?  Probably not, the food and service are extremely inconsistent and the menu varies so much that I don&#39;t even know if anything I like will even be on the menu.",30/01/13,136,2,2,3,44,2.3984,1.462,0.46499999999999997,12.073,No,1375

Menu was handmade and printed off of a printer or copier.  Very impressed as what was available was what was bought that day or so.  Fresh came to mind.

Drinks were disappointing with short shots and lots of ice.  Come on guys!  Even a double was watery. Get smaller glasses, larger pours &amp; less ice or replace/retrain/remotivate the bartenders.  Next time will order wine.

Dinner specials do not have salad included, so ordered one.  It was very nice sized with O&amp;V dressing, tomato, cucumber and good mound of lettuce.

Appetizer was special beef carpaccio and it was wonderful with capers and freshly shaved parm cheese.  Very yum.

Dinnermate had fish which looked good and it was not shared.  A good sign.  My pasta with muscles and clams was abundant in pasta and shells.  Very good, made fresh tomato sauce.

Once we waved off dessert the waitress abandoned us.  Could not even get her near to order another watered drink, but that was all for the good.

This has good food, marginal service, crappy drinks and a nice atmosphere.  And you could talk at your table, so noise was minimal.  Give it a shot...it will probably be a lot larger that what you will get from the bar in return.",12/08/11,165,4,2,5,13,4.0012,3.484,0.889,18.626,No,1344

Love the olive oil and pepper for the bread. The bread is gooood!

Both parties I&#39;ve had the vesuvio chicken. It&#39;s small, though. For $16- $18 I kind of expected a full grown size chicken. With this one, I could eat all the meat on the thigh in one bite.

Potatos were great. The bruschetta is also good.

My husband and I have been dining here for years. This month I filled out the comment card and to my surprise won a raffle and get $10 off once a month for 12 months. We are expecting our first child any day now and I appreciate that for the next year I am guaranteed at least one &#34;date night&#34; a month (thankfully my parents live close enough to babysit!)

We went for our first &#34;date night&#34; last night. I had the special linguini with scallops and a creamy tomato sauce--fantastic plus leftovers, yay! My husband had the salmon which came with avocado and asparagus and some other tasty looking bits. No appetizer or dessert this time around but only because there is not enough room (38 weeks pregnant will do that to a lady&#39;s stomach).

The manager, Rian, who informed me of my raffle prize, also sought us out to congratulate us on our growing family and thank us for dining with them. The wait staff is always very friendly and the busboys do a fabulous job refilling water, iced tea and boxing up leftovers!

In the past I have also gone here for some business lunches and the tilapia with capers and white wine sauce is always a winner. 

Wednesday nights are great since $25 will get you an appetizer, entree and dessert.

And when we went earlier this month we split a caprese salad made with grilled peaches instead of tomatoes (it was a special that night) and it was super tasty!

My absolute favorite menu item is the shell pasta with ham, peas, mushrooms and creamy tomato sauce--it is so good on a chilly night!",30/06/12,185,5,2,5,30,6.879399999999999,2.425,0.065,11.51,No,1637

The service was fabulous.  Our waiter was a mid-20&#39;s young man about 6&#39; or so tall with short hair and an athletic build - sorry, I forgot your name and feel badly about it.  The waiter who tag-teamed was not quite as tall and had curly hair.

All questions were answered and we decided on the price fixe option for $25.00.  My husband and I chose to split an appetizer and salad instead of choosing one or the other.  We ordered the bruschetta with mozzarella and were so happy, the bread was perfectly toasted and the topping was out of this world, tangy and basilly with creamy mozzarella - everything was so fresh.  It tasted like it was made to order. 

The salad was amazing too, We ordered the Insalata alla Francesca - romaine, endive, radicchio, blue cheese, fresh veggies - extremely fresh food.  I didn&#39;t need salad dressing for this creation.  My husband ordered the house Italian and was delighted.  

When the main courses came out, we were still amazed at how good the food was.  Mark&#39;s was a sausage and onion pizza bursting with flavor on a cracker thin crust.  I had the pork chops with a mushroom and artichoke heart sauce - YUM! WOW!  TASTEBUDGASMIC!  

We shared food, enjoyed our conversation without being hovered over.  Our servers came to the table exactly when we needed them - no more, no less.  If it hadn&#39;t been for the noisy family bouncing around in the booth behind me we would have lingered.  After being jammed in the back by a dad and a kid who couldn&#39;t manage to sit still, we decided to ask for the bill and get the included dessert to go.  (Note to hosts, hostesses, and others who seat restaurant customers - when a couple is having a romantic dinner, try to steer noisy people away from them and definitely do not seat them in the booth behind!)

We ordered the creme brulee and drove home, so completely happy with the meal and the service that it made up for the birthday/anniversary debacle.  When we got home and got into the creme brulee - MORE TASTEBUDGASMIC!!  

What a meal, and great experience!  :)

We both had a salmon dish, hers was more of a Madiera, and mine was more of a picatta with capers and lemon butter (yum).  

The bartender was a great one, very friendly, and came over and served us each a small glass of champagne, because he had heard from the manager that we were celebrating a special occasion.

The chicken was good and tender, overall good flavor.  I took off one star due to the steak meat. The Steak taco meat was over salted and although it was warm you can smell the &#34;cow type&#34; freshness in the meat. Typically in Mexican cooking more lime and seasonings are used to add a better flavor and aroma in the meat. The place was very clean and cashier was very prompt and attentive.
I would re-visit again.

There are  7 Mexican restaurants that I have counted on Irving park road between Bartlett Rd and slightly east of Barrington.

I do not go there to eat flautas, hard-shelled tacos, burritos or other American inventions.

la-fogata-restaurant-streamwood,Suzy R.,GLiDZjPfFiZDlgyD3hzekw,RkGKel6IbPAYMIN8YUJksw,"I&#39;ve been going to La Fogata ever since they opened, before it was as polished as it is today, when they used to have mismatched chairs and tables.  But one thing has always been consistent and improving, their food.

No discredit to any burrito fans out there, but don&#39;t go to La Fogata to order something so generic you can find literally anywhere else.  Instead, opt to try of their many MANY specialties and you will be happy that you decided to take your taste buds for a ride.

I recommend just about anything on the menu, but I&#39;ll try to narrow it down to my favorites.

!) Tacos with Al Pastor Pork: Simply amazing.  It&#39;s a marinated pork that is spit-grilled with grilled onions and hints of pineapple.  The pork is so tender and flavorful, with just enough sauce and a slight hint of spice.  --FOR THE ADVENTUROUS DINER, try the cabeza or tongue tacos.  Cabeza is basically beef cheek meat that is a little fatty but super beefy tasting.  And tongue, well do I really need to explain it, if you&#39;ve never had beef tongue you should give it a try, it&#39;s super soft beefy goodness.

2) Mole de Olla: A traditional Mexican soup with a flavorful and spicy broth base.  Has a good variety of perfectly cooked veggies.  

3) Pambazo : This is straight of the streets of Mexico City.  It&#39;s a sandwich with chorizo (Mexican spicy sausage) and potatoes, topped with lettuce, sour cream and cheese, all in a traditional soft telera bread that has been dunked in a slightly spicy tomato sauce, and then grilled.  It sounds messy, and believe me it is super messy, you will have to eat this sandwich with a fork, but it is delicious!

4) Gorditas: Try the steak or chorizo gordita on this one.  It&#39;s basically a thick tortilla pocket stuffed with beans, cheese, and a topping of your choice.  It is crispy fried on the outside, and hot and melty on the inside.

5) Quesadillas:  This is a large thick tortilla, it tastes home-made but I&#39;m not sure, folded in half and filled with melted cheese and the topping of your choice and then grilled.  I recommend again the chorizo quesadilla.  FOR THE ADVENTUROUS DINER, definitely try the Huitlacoche quesadilla.  I have yet to see another restaurant offer this.  Huitlacoche is a corn fungus, yup you read that right, it&#39;s basically a Mexican truffle that is tastes earthy and mushroomy.  It is finely diced with grilled onions.  It might sound and look a little strange, but definitely worth trying.

6) And finally I&#39;ll recommend the Milanesa Torta.  It is a sandwich with a pieces of thin cut breaded steak topped with lettuce, tomato, avocado, cheese, onions, and sour cream, all inside a soft telera bun.  Basic, but very tasty.

Oh and it goes without saying that their Horchata (sweet rice drink) is delicious as well.

So to sum it up, try any one of my recommendations and you will get to experience a true taste of Mexico and what La Fogata is all about! :)",24/05/13,353,5,3,5,87,8.903800000000002,5.683,0.41800000000000004,26.899000000000004,No,2952

i ended up with the shrimp burrito. the massive amount of choices was too much for me to handle. buuut, it was bomb. so amazing. perfectly cooked shrimp, guac inside, all sorts of flavors with every bite. ugh so good. normal burritos run for $4.75 (steal), shrimp was a little more pricey (~$9). the guac was different, the bf wasn&#39;t a fan, but i loved it. instead of the usual 90/10 ratio of avacado to tomatoes, it was more like 70/30. neither bland nor too salty, just right. they make it tableside too if you dine in!

I am a gringo, but my wife of over 5 years hails from the heart of Mexico, and she and her family have taught me much about REAL Mexican cooking.  So much for my qualifications.....

When it first opened, La Fogata immediately separated itself from the myriad burrito stands in the area by offering a wide variety of menu selections from the basics (tacos, etc.) to food which I had never heard of (huitlacoche quesadillas, hauraches, etc).   

The multitude of menu selections ensures that whether you are looking for just a quick snack or want to sit down with the family and enjoy a full dinner, you will not be disappointed. While the prices may be a bit higher on some items as compared to some of the &#34;$4.00 burrito special!&#34; joints, the superior quality of food at La Fogata is well worth it.

The quality of the meals served on every visit is consistently delicious, and I can honestly say that there has never been a meal in my many, many visits that has disappointed me (though there have been some that made my eyes water!)

Standout selections include the huitlacoche (corn mushroom) quesadilla, the pechuga Fogata (seared chicken breast &amp; poblano peppers in cream sauce), and chilequiles (tortilla chips simmered in salsa).

While the restaurant is not very big, the space is well used so it is cozy by not cramped. The dining area and bathrooms are always clean. Waitstaff have always been pleasant and attentive.

If you are looking for authentic Mexican recipes which are well-prepared with quality ingredients, then La Fogata is definitely the place to go.  If your definition of &#34;Mexican food&#34; equals &#34;cheap burrito&#34;, then I encourage you to broaden your horizons and learn what real Mexican cooking is all about - and if you still only want a burrito, the Burrito Fogata will be the best you have ever eaten!!",12/02/12,228,5,1,5,6,4.5108,1.8010000000000002,0.064,12.133999999999999,No,2038

jimmys-charhouse-elk-grove-village,Gilbert F.,eIKJykYhYZOKdsnAFyaWdA,E7qJLnyazQxskPrRfoMiaw,"Extremely poor customer service, menu offerings and accuracy.  

I had this misfortune of ordering from this particular Jimmys on 2 occasions. The first time we experienced Jimmys, our order was horribly incorrect.  Due to the fact that we ordered Carry-Out, we didnt realize the order was incorrect until we started ooening the containers.  We ordered a Family meal with 2 quartered chickens, fettucini alfredo and mash potatoes and gravy.   Upon opening we discovered our chickens weren&#39;t quartered, no big deal just an annoyance.  We then opened something i would call mostaccoli alfredo.  No fettucini? Lastly, we did not receive any gravy for our orders of mashed potatoes.  At this point, it wasn&#39;t feasible for us to go back, so instead we called and spoke with the manager Tom.  He was very empathetic and offered us very generous gift cards and he delivered them personally to us.  I felt extremely satisfied and vowed to give them another chance.  I was told they had only recently moved a bit further up Devon, so i chalked the experience up to &#34;the move.&#34;   Mistakes happen.

Well, we waited a while to allow them the opportunity to get situated and such before ordering again.  A few weeks went by and we decided to order from them again (yesterday.)  We placed our order with a lady named Helen.  We asked Helen to repeat our order to confirm everything was correct.  She repeated the order perfectly and, given our past experience, we figured all would be in order this time around. We picked up the order and proceeded back.  We were celebrating a co-workers retirement so we wanted everything to be nice and smooth.  You can&#39;t imagine how incredulous we were to find some of the same glaring errors as before!  No fettucini,  only &#34;mostaccoli alfredo.&#34; No gravy for the 4 or 5 orders of mashed potatoes.  The chickens were quartered this time, thankfully.  We made the best of a bad situation and improvised the best we could.  Of course we were chagrined when we heard repeated requests for gravy.  We also had to field a lot of questions regarding, &#34;whats that mostaccoli dish called?&#34;  Not a fine dining experience whatsoever.

We called amd spoke with the same lady that took our order originally.  Frankly, it seemed she couldn&#39;t care any less.  She stated, &#34;We dont have fettucini alfredo..., ...our mashed potatoes don&#39;t come with gravy (cereal no milk?).. you can come pick up some gravy.&#34;  Absolutely unacceptable. Highly incompetent and unempathetic staff. She seemed unconcerned and even bothered by our complaint.  Mind you, we maintained absolute professionalism and courtesy while interacting with her.  Her responses weren&#39;t a result of an unreasonable or beligerent customer. She seemed to want to say &#34;is that all u called for? i got work to do.&#34; We pointed out that we spoke to her originally and that she repeated our order to us twice.  Why didnt she say anything about gravy not being included with mash potatoes (what respectable restaurant does that?) Why didnt she advise they dont offer any fettucini alfredo?  The reason she didnt do this is because she simply didnt care and lacks professionalism. 

We did not bother escalating any further to Tom, although perhaps we should have, but no matter the conversation or offers, we will never visit this place again, nor will we allow our family and friends to support this place.  Had they delivered quality and accurate service, they would have earned increased business and promotion from our work group. 

For REAL Jimmys Charhouse i suggest visiting the one in Elgin.  The one in Elk Grove is the one to avoid.",01/07/16,398,1,3,1,81,0.18720000000000014,3.222,6.051,38.729000000000006,No,3668

I was more in it for the networking than the dining, but that soon changed. 
Our shuttle bus dropped us off and I was surprised to find that at 8 pm on a Saturday night they weren&#39;t too busy.  The staff there is very friendly as everyone who walked past greeted us.  Their menu has something for everyone and I chose the filet medallions trio, excellent pick.  The pieces were very tender and flavorful.  I don&#39;t drink but others on my table said the wine list was impressive and the waiter really seemed to know his pairings.

I came from the far south side of Chicago  (50 miles), so when I pulled in and saw a different name, I was worried.  
The folks at the front desk said they would honor it. Cool.
The decor is classic upscale steakhouse,  not old looking or anything,  but just nice. A little darkly lit for lunch time,  though. 
My server was polite and had good timing (there when you need him, not obtrusive when you&#39;re eating).
I ordered a 22 oz. Rib eye bone-in, mashed potatoes,  a chowder soup and wedge salad. 
The soup was terrific, flavorful and had enough seafood taste without being overbearing. 
The wedge salad was BIG! Bacon bits, Bleu cheese crumbled on it, a hard boiled egg  and Bleu cheese dressing. 
Garlic croutons would have elevated either soup or salad, but the were both great tasting dishes.
The main course came and it looked and smelled wonderful. The classic char smell, beautiful look on the plate. The steak tasted every bit as fantastic as it looked. Potatoes and sauted green beans... just great.

The Food:
I&#39;ve been here on weekends and weeknights. I&#39;ve been here for Valentines day. I&#39;ve had private parties here.  The food is just....eh.  It&#39;s basically a classed up standard greek diner.  The steaks are not Prime and I would question even Choice.  They&#39;re not bad, but they can be dry (especially on the outside) and lacking flavor. Not nearly enough salt on them prior to cooking which makes for a dry crust.

Other food is a little better than your average Greek run family style restaurant.  It&#39;s not a bad place, but you&#39;re paying Wildfire prices for about two steps down in quality and maybe three or four down in flavor.  It seems like they&#39;re stuck on Greek inspired family recipes and don&#39;t really have any POW on the plate.

But it&#39;s not bad and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m getting ripped off.  For us, we go there when we can&#39;t get reservations elsewhere.

the Bar:

Love the bar.  Good drinks and a fun crowd, although on the older end of the spectrum.  Great people watching for middle agers like us, but I think a younger crowd would feel like they&#39;re seeing Grandma dancing at the bar.  Very fun time for us though, we always end up having fun conversations with random people and the live entertainment is a blast.

So, in short...

It was almost 10 minutes before anyone came to ask us for drinks.  We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer and there were no tenticles...very disappointing because that&#39;s the best part. I ordered the lamb chops and everything was less than room temperature. Nothing was hot. I think the mashed potatoes were from a box...very loose. A couple of pieces of broccoli and some carrot chunks. The salad looked old. My husband ordered the prime rib that came with a baked potato to go. The meat was raw and cold too. I asked for the Bernaise sauce on the side and that was fine. Took the carrot cake to go and ate that later. That was very moist! Great.
Awesome waitress personality wise but the food was very disappointing. Jimmys charhouse has been in business for many years so I thought it would be a perfect place to go. How can u go wrong with lamb chops at a Greek restaurant but I guess u can. Very disappointed.

I&#39;ve driven past several times and thought, &#34; need to try this place&#34; and I am glad I did.  It is very welcoming.  The service was excellent and my favorite part---CLEAN.  Seriously, I have walked out of more restaurants lately because they look like they haven&#39;t seen a mop or dust cloth is weeks.

Lest I digress, on to the food.  We were super hungry so we ordered 4 rolls for the two of us.  Usually we don&#39;t have a problem, but these rolls were nicely filled and the portions were very generous.  the tempura veggie appetizer and miso soup before hand may have had something to do with it.  

One of the rolls was not to our liking and the owner/manager (?) noticed it right away and asked if she could please make us something else.  There was nothing wrong with the roll, it just was not something we enjoyed like we thought we would.  She was so apologetic and eager to replace or remove the item from our bill.  She made us a small sample platter and it was amazing.  Seriously she did not have to do this, as I said there was nothing wrong with the roll, it was US. 

The platter was equally amazing and the fact that they were concerned with a customer not being satisfied was even more amazing.

Wow customer service????  Great food! Good prices! They have my business, and I will be back!",18/08/14,146,4,2,5,45,8.046999999999999,5.648000000000001,0.504,13.848,No,1346
sake-sushi-and-grill-lake-zurich,Karyn S.,Xoetf_bcE5U6o9IBzlJMWQ,EcO2iBPGVIz55u1x13E-iw,"My boyfriend and I were looking to try a sushi place in our hometown of Barrington, and after checking the reviews on Yelp... decided maybe not so much. I noticed all the wonderful reviews for  Sake Sushi, we tried it. I&#39;m still relatively new to the whole sushi thing, so I was nervous - I shouldn&#39;t have been! 

I know, it&#39;s next to a Walmart in a tiny strip mall, but the sushi was amazing!!! It&#39;s BYOB (which we haven&#39;t taken advantage of yet), and the first time we easily managed to spend $120 on sushi and a bottle of sake. We ended up ordering 4 - 5 rolls a piece and a couple for takeout for his twin, because it was SO GOOD! We went back a week or so later with the brother, and spend $104. 

My favorite were there Jalapeno Popper Roll (it was a special - they&#39;re only on the board when you walk in, so make sure you look!), and the Caribbean roll. My boyfriend liked the Spider roll (which was good) and the Dragon roll. Really, there were so many that were good it&#39;s hard to remember and make distinctions. There was only one I didn&#39;t like, and it was one that Curtis loved, so go figure. I LOVED their Miso soup - one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. It was amazing. I also ordered the Cucumber Salad, and it was exquisite. Writing this review is make me hunger for it right now. 

Both the nights I went, it was relatively quiet - we were surprised. However, a number of people did come in for takeout during our stay each time. The decor is nice and modern, very pretty and lovely. I could spend probably $20, or $50 per person, it all depends on what you&#39;re hungry for and what you feel like ordering (some rolls are more expensive that others). 

I can&#39;t wait to come back again and again and again and again and again... I just need to make sure my boyfriend isn&#39;t SUPER hungry first so I can afford to, I could easily spend $75 hear for the two of us each time, haha.",05/09/14,220,5,2,5,41,7.058900000000001,3.928,0.641,16.43,No,1929

Atmosphere: really great except for the music. Just doesn&#39;t match the vibes of a sushi place very well. I&#39;ve also heard from some people that they think the wait staff is cold. I disagree wholeheartedly. Their culture might not be exactly the same as ours, making them act differently as wait staff than we would. I find them to be delightful and appreciate the extra touch of culture the wait staff puts into this place. 

Food: AMAZING! Well worth everything. Even the sh** music (but you can carry out if it&#39;s that unbearable for you). I&#39;m almost embarrassed as to how much I come here, but I dream about their sushi. The fish is very fresh and it&#39;s a thick cut, which I like a lot. I always get the salmon and white tuna sushi (the meat with just rice) and it&#39;s to die for. I&#39;ve tried sushi in multiple places in the US and abroad and this is hands down my favorite place. The owner&#39;s husband owns a fishing company (or industry?) and obviously gives his wife the cream of the crop. As at any sushi place, taste and flavor can vary depending on the fish, which makes it so genuine! Sometimes I like the white tuna and other times it&#39;s lost some flavor. But the salmon is consistently AMAZING. They also have tons of rolls if you&#39;re into that. I love the jalapeo popper, which they recently just added to the menu. Just enough spicy (and I normally don&#39;t like spicy). While they did recently change the menu, they have not changed owners as another reviewer believed. Winnie is still the owner, but she isn&#39;t there as often. I actually rarely see her these days. The chefs are still the same, but there are more. The place has EXPLODED for good reason and they needed additional chefs and wait staff. Luckily I&#39;m very accepting of change, unlike the other reviewer, and I embraced this necessary change. I have not seen any drop in quality with their changes. Must have just been bad timing for the reviewer since the fish can vary slightly since all the sushi doesn&#39;t come from one fish. 

Also! Gluten free! I have an allergy and they&#39;ve been very accommodating. They have gluten free soy sauce (just ask!) and they have plenty of options on the menu. They might not be super knowledgable though about that so I&#39;d say avoid spicy tuna, crab, mystery sauces, any &#39;crunch&#39; and obviously tempura. But I&#39;ve never asked because I always get just sushi so they may know more than I think! I&#39;m only assuming because there&#39;s a slight language barrier. 

Cheers and enjoy this incredible sushi place! Did I mention it&#39;s BYOB?! Winning.",05/01/16,303,5,3,5,60,6.1022000000000025,7.4350000000000005,2.207,31.359000000000005,No,2723
sake-sushi-and-grill-lake-zurich,Alice L.,qXp3rXcuWsVOjKYbJLx7gA,PU_ip7L9iZB_kOiK2Stl8Q,"I think this place changed owners because when I used to come here, they never had a lunch special, all you can eat for $15. I also didn&#39;t recognize any of the sushi chefs. I used to be a regular when they first opened and there was one chef that used to greet me, we&#39;re both Chinese and spoke Cantonese, so it was nice talking to someone who spoke the same dialect. I never caught his name but I think he was the owner. He is probably gone now because the sushi was really good back then.

Now, omg, I took my boyfriend here a couple days ago and ordered from the lunch special........this was the worst sushi I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Everything was not fresh, fish, rice, seaweed, EVERYTHING. You can get better sushi at Jewel or at Marianos. It will cost more then $15 but their sushi tastes like gold compared to this place.

So when I saw a little strip mall sushi place along Rand Rd (just south of Walmart and Costco), I reluctantly recommended it for lunch today. Guess what? Everyone else on Yelp was right! Sake Sushi and Grill is definitely a gem.

The inside is nicely decorated with modern finishes. The servers and staff are friendly with smiles on their faces. We ordered the Roll Special lunch, Hot Bowl lunch special, and a shrimp tempura appetizer.  The lunch specials come with both house salad and miso soup.  The salad dressing is one of the best ginger citrus dressings I&#39;ve had. It had a good flavor and just the right balance of sweet and savory.  Miso soup is good. The fish is fresh.

We walked into this place just wanting to try somewhere new. Admittedly we were surprised at first by how modern it was inside - the decor was great and still offered the environment I&#39;m looking for when I go out for sushi. 

When we sat down to look at the menu, it was kind of small. We ordered a sushi combination and a roll to start. WOW! The sushi tasted so fresh and clean. We instantly fell in love. 

Then we tried the roll and oh my. We ordered the Caribbean Roll. The minute I put it in my mouth I think I died and went to heaven and then reincarnated just to put another piece in my mouth. Seriously, it was that good. It was the perfect combination of crunchy, spicy, and sweet. 

After telling our server how much we loved it, she gave us a recommendation for the Orange Flamingo Roll. That was equally as amazing. Again, perfectly crunchy and perfectly spicy.

The Teri chicken looked (and tasted) like it was boiled and then sauced and had a heavy onion flavor, the shrimp tempura was more like ebi-fry and definitley not tempura batter. If you want decent fried shrimp order their Tempura - if you want Tempura eat somewhere else.

The biggest issue I had was with the (Nigiri) sushi. The fish was OK and was a good portion size in relation to the rice. It was the low grade rice that was not prepared very well at all. It was undercooked, dry and flavorless. I&#39;m not a sushi snob and will happily eat at cheap sushi places but don&#39;t care for improperly prepared food.

Our party also had the Tuna Tataki which was good and a roll of some sort which also had rice issues. The salad included with the meals was standard Japanese restaurant fare and the miso was actually pretty good.

My faves are the &#34;hot bowl,&#34; slices of salmon, tuna, scallop, octopus, tossed in a spicy sauce. As an appetizer for dinner it comes on a bed of finely sliced  cucumber. As a lunch special, they serve it on rice. it&#39;s sushilicious. There&#39;s a nice sushi and sashimi dish that hits the spot and a seared tuna that&#39;s really nice too. The teriyaki salmon comes a bit over-teriyaki&#39;d and a bit sweet, but nonetheless a good choice.

Good variety and generous portions in the lunch specials, rapidly becoming one of my favorite lunch spots.

My sister and I got take out for here last night and everything had a funky smell to it.  Not an awful this is bad smell, just funky.  The egg rolls tasted only like peanut butter.  Not a piece of pork or shrimp to be found anywhere.  Ugh...couldn&#39;t even finish it.

My sister got chicken with peapods and water chestnuts, her go to.  It had that strange smell to it and no flavor what so ever.  If it didn&#39;t have the peapods, it would have had no color to it, just white.  

I had the Gilbert special.  I couldn&#39;t tell which meat was pork and which was beef.  Just an unidentifiable mess.

gilberts-kitchen-west-dundee,Katie K.,uu1OetW6RThWv83uBz4ouw,BZlEH3oerceyUBXnGzNyMA,"Gilberts Kitchen has been a beloved tradition to many families in the area for decades. I, myself, have been getting Gilberts take out for over 20 years. When I moved away, it was the first thing I asked to eat for dinner when I visited home. Currently, I live several miles away from West Dundee and every time we drive to pick up our food from Gilberts Kitchen, we pass several &#39;average&#39; Chinese food restaurants on our way, knowing that the few extra miles are well worth the above average quality Chinese food. Even when the owners would close shop for a few weeks and raise prices upon their return every year, we would continue to order from Gilberts because knew that the food was worth the extra money. With that said, I was very saddened to hear that the management had changed (?) and I was in denial when I read the recent Yelp reviews claiming that Gilberts had taken a turn for the worst. Although I was leery, I still placed a large order with a wide variety of food to accommodate 9 family members (my uncle was visiting from California and had specifically requested  Gilberts).  It is my great displeasure to announce that the other yelp reviews with poor ratings are indeed correct. Gone are the days of quality ingredients. Fresh arrays of vegetables and different kinds of mushrooms are now lacking from their dishes, replaced with typical cheap vegetables. Their fantastic giant shrimp and pork egg rolls are smaller and are now filled with only shredded cabbage as far as I could see. Their jumbo chicken nuggets are more like chicken tenders from Chilis. Instead of being the Gilberts Kitchen with exceptional quality that brought people from near and far, new management has dumbed it down to &#39;just another Chinese take out place&#39;. It is officially the end of an era and this makes me very sad.

What really stands out is their Wonton Soup. Unlike most restaurants that give you dish water with noodles and some green onions, Gilberts actually puts a ton of stuff in theirs. What separates theirs is not just the taste, but the amount of pork they put in it. I swear, they take a rib and just slice it up. It is amazing. The Wonton Soup itself is a meal, and well worth it.

Why you would choose to only use the equipment (and use it for evil) dumbfounds me.  Sell me the recipe portion since you aren&#39;t using it.  Mongolian Beef at this place was unique- until recently.  Argue as you see fit- but the recipe was different.  Dark brown, spicy sauce that clung to the beef and green onions.  Now, it is the standard over-cooked, spongy, thick slice beef, smothered in onions and green onions (which, as you don&#39;t seem to realize, waters down the simple version of a sauce you attempt to use).  Thank you for saving me the gas money and time so I don&#39;t have to drive a long way for mediocrity.  My small town has better Asian food now- and that is nothing to shout about.

However, I&#39;d rather get less food that is more interesting. Quality from a perspective as it was clean, fresh etc. was fine, but there were far too many onions, sprouts and other &#34;cheap&#34; ingredients and most of the ingredients I am used to in Chinese food were missing. 

I got the veggie moo shu and the chow fun. Both were greasy and largely flavorless. The plum sauce was bland too and there were more sprouts in the chow fun than noodles.

Became very flavorful once the included ginger sauce is added - and ginger sauce helped cut the grease, making it more palatable to me.   (Husband loved the grease - so it&#39;s personal taste I guess.)  Egg roll alone is a meal.   I had (small) wonton soup (enough for 2)  and egg roll and that was all I could manage.  Wonton soup was enjoyable.
Tasted Beef Chow Mein - had an odd taste I didn&#39;t enjoy.  Also tasted Orange Chicken - it&#39;s spicier (hot) than other restaurants in the area - it was ok.  Husband, who loves orange chicken was unexcited by it.
Service was great.  Very friendly and kind.

gilberts-kitchen-west-dundee,Rob M.,Bq5RbBfSxXWdF6dleSuITQ,4md73FrB5dyEKtk3Iw_fhA,"We have been going to Gilbert&#39;s for over 10 years now. It was by far the best Chinese take out in the area. While it was not very close to our house for takeout, it was well worth it. We even bought catering trays of food for parties from them it was that good. We used to go to them all the time but over the past couple of years have been going less and less. The quality of the food has been declining as well as taste. The last time we went will be the last time-worst experience with them ever!. Take-out bill was over $50.00 which we never this high before. Wife ordered a chicken dish and asked it not to be spicy. It was so spicy, she could not eat it. I even had a hard time with it. I ordered Mongolian Beef. It is always served with those white rice noodles to go under it. I did not get the noodles, so the dish was incomplete as it needs this to soak up the sauce and flavor. I called them about this and was told they stopped including noodles with this over  a year ago and they don&#39;t have them anymore. Not true, it hasn&#39;t been a year since I got them last. I then was handed to someone else over the phone and the story changed to if you want them, you have specifically ask for them and pay $2.00 extra for a small bag of noodles which probably cost them 25 cents. If they are now serving a dish which is missing an important component to it, you would think they would let you know. Just another way to jack of the price. If that wasn&#39;t bad enough, the meat was like shoe leather. In the past it would be very tender, now it hurts you jaw you have to chew this leather so much. Obviously, they are using much cheaper cuts of meat. Our kid got cashew chicken which used to be very good. The stuff they gave us had almost no cashews, was very dark looking and not very good at all. My wife and kid ended up eating almost none of this $50.00 feast at all. I had to finish all of their food over the next week as lunch leftovers, and no it did not improve with age. Also, ordered bbq pork fried rice. Instead, they gave us beef fried rice which we do not like and was not very good. When I called to complain about this as well, they only said that someone else had the same thing happen to them, Tough luck was the attitude, not we will give you a credit or replace it. The only good thing was the egg rolls, they continue to be the some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. I know the ownership has not changed, it&#39;s the same guy at the front for the past 10 years. He has just decided to save money by cutting the quality of the food and jacking up the prices and charging for what should be free. Didn&#39;t even get the damn fortune cookies they used to include in all orders. Felt totally ripped off and got no apology&#39;s for screwing up the order. Never going back.

I have even had my mom bring Gilbert&#39;s frozen on the plane with her when she has come to visit me, that is how much I miss it!  When I lived in IL we would eat here all the time.  We compare every Chinese restaurant we go to against Gilbert&#39;s, and no one else even comes close.  The portions here are huge, they have to staple to tops of their cartons together!  The wontons are yum, I have never found a wonton anywhere else that actually has meat in them.  The chicken for the sweet and sour is HUGE and juicy, the egg foo young is AWESOME, especially if you ask for it well done.  Even when I lived in Illinois, we would drive 45 minutes to get Gilbert&#39;s, and I have friends in Libertyville that would ask me to bring some to them if I was in the area.

That kind of longevity in the carryout business says they do it right.  And, they do.  As mentioned, their egg rolls are legendary, huge.  The food is kind of Americanized, as the name Gilberts Chop Suey kitchen implies, but so what?  Give it a try.

So, of course, I just had to try it!  It is carry-out only, as others have said, and since we didn&#39;t have a menu handy, we just went there and ordered and waited for our food.  We ordered a small order of Mongolian Beef (because a large was like $15.95), large Beef Chop Suey, Pot Stickers and Egg Rolls.  The only thing negative I would say about this place is the high prices for some of the entrees.  Everything else is very reasonably priced but I really don&#39;t understand charging $15.95 for a large anything at a Chinese take-out place.  But, of course, that is just my opinion.  Anyways, back to the food, and that...VERY GOOD!  The Mongolian Beef was definitely the best out here in the Elgin area and same with the Egg Rolls!  OMG...the egg rolls!  They were very large and VERY delicious!!  I seriously was thinking about going back today just to get some more of those!  YUM!!  And the pot stickers, as well, were the best out here!  We had never had Chop Suey before so I have nothing to compare it to but it was tasty, the only bad thing about it was it used canned mushrooms, and that is a BIG no no in my book.

Well, today was finally that day. Before getting my groceries, my boyfriend and I decided to stop for a quick cup of coffee or small breakfast. 

Upon walking in, I was pleasantly surprised by the decor and how chic the place was. It&#39;s modern, yet very homey. I was excited to see we were not the only customers there either. Given the hidden location, I wondered whether enough people would notice it was even there. 

I&#39;m not vegetarian or vegan, but I loved how healthy everything on the menu seemed. I ordered a cup of coffee and we decided to split an order of the berry crepes... Not the healthiest item on the menu, but it sounded too good to pass up. We both loved them and would definitely order them again. It wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly sweet and you could tell they used fresh, real ingredients. 

This feels like the perfect place I could go eat out and order healthy without having to either 1) break the bank  or 2) settle for an underwhelming salad or grilled chicken breast. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because the menu was pretty small, but given the size of the cafe, I understand why.

What sucks is for kids - there are no highchairs. So good luck if your kid runs around. I didn&#39;t bother asking if there was a booster.

That said, the food is absolutely excellent - even if the menu is a bit limited in it&#39;s selection. I had a great appetizer that was basically julienned carrots and zucchini made into a rollup stuffed with ricotta. They also kept that same theme with the main course - which also included a julienned cucumber made into a little circular &#34;pot&#34; to hold a small salad to go with the lentils we ordered. 

All in all the food is pretty good, but this place is genuinely pricey. I&#39;m actually a bit surprised/saddened that for all the fanciness that goes into good visual presentation for relatively simple recipes, it doesn&#39;t make up for that their entire tea selection was from whole foods/world market. Granted this may not be the same as Billy Corgan&#39;s Madame Zuzu&#39;s tea house, but c&#39;mon guys. Don&#39;t try to sell us your tea like it&#39;s something special/worth extra when we basically have your entire tea selection in our pantry already. I say this as someone who&#39;s not even vaguely a tea snob - and yet they missed common tea like earl grey. The teas were way overpriced for a world market selection.

If this is what $15-18 plates cost, I think either this restaurant is all over the place or simply overcharges for everything. I mean the lentil main course had probably 2 cups of dried lentils (so easily 3+ cups cooked). I love lentils way more than the average person, but is that worth $15-18 when the meal was $2 of lentils and maybe $1 of salad and likewise $12 for the appetizer? No.

Tucked out of the way in the Village Square shopping center in the horseshoe area.  A nice little gem that&#39;s different from the normal.  Vegetarian, freshly prepared.  Loved the dcor - the husband of the team has made the bar countertop and some of the tabletops and mosaics on the wall - what a talent!!  The wife handles the food part.  And of course, that&#39;s what we&#39;re there for - 
Hubs ordered the polenta with mushrooms.  Started with a bowl of the carrot/ginger soup - very delicious, with almonds on top that added a nice crush and flavor.  It came with a salad wrapped in a cucumber bowl.  Very creamy polenta with very tasty, thickly sliced mushrooms.

I ordered the lentil plate (K) - it also came with a bowl of the soup.  The lentil plate was cold, which wasn&#39;t expected, but delicious.  Grapes, peppers, kale, and asparagus along with naan accompanied the dish.  Enough that I couldn&#39;t finish, but hubs helped me out!  

Would have loved to come a few weeks ago to enjoy eating outside, but this was nice as well.  Just nice music, and lovely dcor - perfect date night, and eating so healthy.

The $14+ appetizer took, 45 min to get to our table and it was only 6 stalks of asparagus, garnished.

This was not one of those night. 

Back story is this place is in a Chicago suburb and the Cubs are playing in the playoffs. They have recliner seats in front of big screens that you can eat off of dinner trays. We just sat at a booth

We waited 30 minutes for our table which wasn&#39;t terrible. We had drinks at the bar so once we got seated we didn&#39;t need anything except for a little time looking at the menu. Our waiter came back to our table 25 minutes after we sat down. Once we order a couple of my coworkers ordered a refill which didn&#39;t come out until our meals did. About 25 minutes later for a couple orders of meatloaf and a burger. One of the guys reminded our server he needed a refill of Diet Coke at that time and that is when we got our refills. 

The next time we saw our server was at least another 30 minutes when he just brought us our check. 

The Meatloaf was below par and not in the golf way and the service was not great. That is why this trip got two stars.",13/10/16,104,2,1,2,-1,1.015,0.973,0.171,12.856000000000002,No,1080

I had the Westwood Chicken Sandwich which itself was delicious. The balance between the various parts of the sandwich was great. My sandwich came with fries which seemed a bit over fried. The seasoning on them masked this a bit. They were edible but not the most enjoyable.

In general our waitress was very nice and attentive to our needs. Unfortunately the service was pretty slow, with food taking close to 40 minutes to come out.

westwood-tavern-schaumburg-3,Leslie R.,rFR3fyOU1MSyIRcb6oiRmQ,a1swgirZJl98rpiF2Am5Rw,"Great find in the area! We were going to go somewhere else but the wait was over an hour so we decided to come here. They had a wait too, about 30-45 minutes, but compared to an hour and given the fact that we were starving we figured it was still worth the wait.

My guess was there was a wait at both of these restaurants because they were the only off-chain restaurant within miles and after travelling so far we really wanted to avoid places we can dine at anytime. 

We got our table notification text a little before the 30 minute mark and were escorted upstairs. That when we noticed a bar on the second floor that may have been open seating, next time we know! We wanted to sit at the bar since they offer the full menu service but there was no place to sit.

The table, or should I say, couches we were seated at was a nice touch, plus they were super comfortable! At first there was another couple at our table, guess they had the same idea as us to try sitting at the bar and figured that table was part of the bar. But it wasn&#39;t, also good to know. It was a great spot, overlooking the first floor and bar with a giant TV screen.

The food was great. I was hesitant to order the salmon because I always order the salmon and it&#39;s just to be healthy. Never do it because it is the best tasting dish on the menu. As soon as I told the waitress I was even considering the salmon she lit up and told me it was one of their top 3 dishes! So I ordered that and my husband ordered their house burger, which also looked pretty good. We also ordered some chips and guac to start.

I must emphasize how spot on my waitress was about the salmon!! One of the best, if not the best, I ever had! I think I only enjoyed one salmon fillet more and that was only because it was at an uber expensive restaurant. This was sweet yet tangy and the price was totally affordable. Under $20. The guac and homemade tortilla chips were also delish. My husband was very happy with his burger. 

The food came out fast and fresh so we made it to our evening concert with time to spare. Great way to spend our last night of our Chicago trip!",01/05/16,228,5,1,5,9,6.446000000000001,4.305999999999999,0.747,20.945999999999998,No,2131

There is a bar area inside along with a dining area with several tvs. Then there is a very nice outside section also with a bar and tvs above the bar.

There were 4 of us. We ordered the chips and guacamole as an appetizer. Entrees ordered at the table were: a burger with the patty, bacon, and an egg with the side of fries. The French dip rib sandwich with the meat juice and horseradish (on the side) for dipping served with a side of fries. The special artic char meal. I ordered the cranberry chicken salad and the crunchy pig and lobster roll. 

The salad is large, definitely dinner sized portion. Chicken, dried cranberries, pecans, and Bleu cheese. The crunchy pig and lobster roll (6 pcs): avocado, a little white rice, lobster, Jalapeo and bacon. Both very good! 

We also ordered drinks. I had a couple martinis including the mangoberry and Hollywood nights. Both good, but Hollywood Nights is a must order. It&#39;s green with a cherry at the bottom. It says it&#39;s sour but if anything it&#39;s a bit sweet and tastes mostly like pineapple juice. It&#39;s amazing.

Went with a friend of mine tonight and food order took longer than  two other tables that came after us.    Then when friend complained about his order after they finally gave the wings,  she said it was because I ordered the appetizer which was besides the point because that appetizer took forever.    

She tried to clean up act after I stared as she gave a third table their order.    She afterwards bought the soy sauce then later said the sushi makers must&#39;ve left early for the night.    Whatever. 

The Signature roll I ordered eventually arrived and I have to say it was far from it.    Granted its a bar and sushi probably isn&#39;t their specialty but since they advertised quite a few choices,  they should at least make it decent. 

As much as I don&#39;t want to play the so-called &#34;race card&#34;, my friend and I were the only black folks in the restaurant.    Even if I wasn&#39;t relocating soon,  I won&#39;t be back ever.",20/12/15,100,1,1,2,-12,1.3881000000000001,0.595,0.20500000000000002,9.2,No,981
westwood-tavern-schaumburg-3,Mel A.,oF20BNxcphfedn93Nfwd9w,XfcyEn4sdCJUL4gENszkJQ,"My entire experience here was pretty average. They do have a good selection of beer and cocktails (it&#39;s a bar). While entering, the place looks really spacious and open. We were seated upstairs and it was actually really neat because they have recliners (I believe) in front of big screen TVs where you may enjoy the game while being served food and drinks.

So, we started with the seared tuna with some asian slaw for an appetizer which was quite delicious. The waitress was attentive at this point, coming back with drink orders, taking the order quickly so no complaint so far. Then, she disappeared for a little bit. When our entree came, we had to move dishes around because the table hasn&#39;t been cleared for a while even though we&#39;ve finished the appetizers way before the entrees came.

Someone else brought the food order to the table. I tried my mango salad and it was actually good and then the spicy tuna rolls. The rolls were not at all spicy to my standard and they were fairly average-tasting. Sure, this isn&#39;t really a sushi bar but they do have a sizable sushi menu and I did notice several people ordering them. Dining partner thought the fish and chips were &#34;nothing to write home about&#34; and mentioned that Applebee&#39;s had better fish and chips.

Overall, I think if you are looking for a place to have drinks and maybe some appetizers, then this would be it. Otherwise, I really wasn&#39;t too impressed and perhaps the wait staff could dial down on the attitude a little. I noticed how almost everyone of their wait staff (the ones I&#39;ve seen upstairs anyway) were walking around like they were angry at the world.

At Westwood Tavern in Schaumburg, you get all of that but the food is much better than what you would expect from a sports bar. 

The great thing about Westwood Tavern is the variety in food options. They have taken bar food staples and kicked it up a notch. You can get your nachos, burgers, tacos, and flatbreads to accompany your beer but you can also get sushi rolls and sashimi if bar food isn&#39;t your thing. The foot long grilled cheese caught my eye - it&#39;s a twist on grilled cheese and tomato soup by adding braised short rib beef with smoked gouda grilled mushrooms. I decided on giving my cholesterol a break and chose the grilled salmon and green beans instead which was delicious and the healthier choice. 

The venue is great for groups whether you are with a rowdy crowd to watch the game or to enjoy a nice dinner with the family. There is enough space where you can be surrounded by screens to watch several games at a time or prefer a quieter setting away from the sports fanatics.

The reason I&#39;m giving this restaurant 3 stars however is that the prices are a bit high, even for the suburbs --- and the food is really not special enough to justify these prices. Even the appetizers are priced high enough where a small bite and one of the drink specials will set you back around $20 easily.

The set up of this bar/restaurant is pretty great, probably my favorite part. They have a downstairs and an upstairs with bars on each level. TVs are everywhere and they have large booths and tables so this place is great for groups. Some of the booths even have taps right at the table which is pretty sweet, not to mention leather lounge chairs placed right in front of TVs! Plus, outdoor seating! How great is that? Seems to be a pretty popular after work spot.

Their menu is interesting because they have quite the variety; typical bar food such as burgers and wraps, but then they also have things like tacos and fish and a pretty extensive sushi list. Both times I&#39;ve been here now I&#39;ve gotten the fish and chips. I&#39;m honestly not sure why, they have way more exciting menu options! Must have just been craving fish frye on those days... who knows.

At Westwood you&#39;ll find a huge beer list as well as signature cocktails and of course a full bar. They have a daily drink special list as well.

Now to break down the good stuff...

Tavern Fish &amp; Chips - three pieces of fresh cod in a beer batter paired with malted vinegar &amp; seasoned hand cut fries ($15). This is very good! Fish had the perfect texture and the seasoned fries are bomb dot com.

Pulled Chicken Nachos - cheddar &amp; jack cheese, sour cream, jalapeos, tomatoes, lettuce, green onion, guacamole, and roasted salsa ($9.50). Great for sharing with a group! Nothing mind blowing, but definitely pretty damn delicious.

Cucumber Strawberry Press (signature cocktail) - Effen cucumber vodka, strawberry puree, and sprite ($8). Refreshing and delicious! I&#39;m a sucker for anything cucumber lately and this cocktail combo hit the spot just right.

Service - friendly but honestly pretty slow. Both times I&#39;m been here (on a Thursday and Friday night) they&#39;ve been really busy, but still, good service is still expected. This is really the only reason I couldn&#39;t give the last star!

I will definitely be back to Westwood. I&#39;m really intrigued to give their sushi menu a whirl!",11/08/15,276,4,2,5,24,11.801,7.871999999999999,0.722,20.408999999999995,No,2188

Employees: our waitress was awesome. She was always on the ball of everything and never was too annoying when checking in. The people greeting had some attitude and I felt like they didn&#39;t really do the place justice but decided to let it go (girl with big glasses). Our waitress was awesome, let me add again (blonde). 

Atmosphere: very welcoming and had a home appearance. So much fun and warm (definitely hate being cold in a restaurant) I really enjoyed the surroundings. 

Food: everything, AND I MEAN everything I had was amazing. The cornbread was perfectly cooked (filling and more dessert bound for me) but had a sweet feel to it. The maple butter was the topping that was out of control experience. Loved it with the cornbread. The trio sampler is so worth the try, you will not be disappointed by the appearance and  juiciness of the food. It&#39;s worth it especially if you want to try a few things.

Westwood Tavern was nearby, and the casual atmosphere didn&#39;t frown upon our yoga pants and messy buns.  It isn&#39;t a divey restaurant though; I like spots that can be super casual or slightly upscale.  The dark wood tables and cozy booths scream &#34;upscale Schaumburg,&#34; while the beer taps at the tables and TVs bring you back down to earth.

I didn&#39;t partake in the table tap, but how cool and convenient is that?  Purchase a beer and refill it at your convenience, no waiting!  You do pay by the ounce though, so be careful!

I love the diverse menu at Westwood Tavern.  Burgers, salads, and even sushi!  I had the best turkey burger here, topped with apricot and cranberry, and STUFFED with brie!  The fries are sprinkled with parmesan.  I dipped them in the housemade ranch.  These are no ordinary fries.

The beer menu (if you&#39;ve decided to skip the table tap) offers many local brews on tap and in cans or bottles. I went with a Goose Island Green Line.

Westwood Tavern is a comfortable atmosphere that isn&#39;t too sporty or too snooty.  My friend and I loved our food and could&#39;ve taken a nap in the booth after an hour of sweaty yoga.

The bar is quite large.  Has a pretty decent sized horseshoe shaped bar with a bunch of big screen TV&#39;s over the bar.  All around the bar are tables and booths.  Scattered all around are move TV&#39;s.  They have an upstairs space that is quite big, lots of tables for dining in.  They also have a decent sized outdoor space with a bar and TVs.  Decent amount of bar stools around the bar and about two dozen tables.  Overall, it is a nice vibe...seems a little upscale, but it is quite casual.

Each night they have some sort of happy hour special...some sort of beer or martini special.  They menu is quite vast.  For good, they have some decent sushi. I enjoyed the jalapeo rolls, signature rolls, crunchy pig and lobster roll, ahi tuna sashimi and freshwater eel.  In addition, they have lots of standard bar fare.  They have burgers, wings, salads, flatbreads, tacos and some signature entrees. 

They have about 15 beers on tap.  Those taps consist of macro and micro brews.  They also have 50-60 beers in bottles.  They have your standard Miller Lite, Corona, Coors light...as well as some nice breweries like Victory, Allagash, Lagunitas, Great Lakes, Oscar Blues, Two Brothers, Deschutes...etc.  Plenty of beer styles, IPAs, Hefeweizen, American Wheat, Stouts, Porters, Pale Ales, Rye beers...A more than ample selection. 

The staff here is just fine.  They always have plenty of help.  Our waitress (different each night) was always around, but not nagging.  They were quick to answer questions and you never waited around for another drink (not that I had that many).  

Overall, this is a great place in Schaumburg.  If you are looking for a nice casual place, stop in.  There are always a ton of people here, but with all the space, you are not bumping into people.

And as such, I tended to believe her. We met up here at 11am and the restaurant / bar had a few people already sitting in there. It&#39;s Friday after all and people want to start the weekend already. Don&#39;t blame them one bit! The parking here can get crazy, as it shares spaces with a mall adjacent to it. Thankful that I quickly found parking nearby the restaurant, so time wasn&#39;t wasted. Westwood Tavern can be characterized as being like dining in Buffalo Wild Wings or maybe Chili&#39;s type of setting. I had already eaten breakfast an hour earlier, so all I did was order lunch, but in a take out box. While I wished I had some alcohol with my friend, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t - since I had to drive 3 hours to Green Bay from Schaumburg that day. Still it was a nice venue to hang out with my friend, whom I haven&#39;t seen since 2010. My friend had some alcohol though, pretty sure she can handle one while driving. Lol

Westwood Tavern is located at 1385 N Meacham Avenue in Schaumburg, IL. They accept credit cards, as usual and they serve definitely comfort food and burgers for the masses. For the most part, the ambiance here was decently louder than I had thought, but not so quiet to where it was a problem. The lights were kind of dim, but not so much to where it was mood lighting. After all, it was 11am! Kind of weird to have that, unless they were saving $$ on electricity. Prices here were normal, where it can range from $6 to $10 for burger combos and $10+ for other delicious entrees. The service here at the Westwood Tavern was pretty good and nice. It was quick bite for lunch and we had the waitress take a photo of us after the meal. It was good. I didn&#39;t think the restaurant was air conditioned when we were there, but I could be mistaken. Oh well.

For me, I got the Chicago burger, which ended up being eaten at a rest stop on the Illinois / Wisconsin state line. It came with French fries and it was satisfying. The burger itself was pretty good, juicy, and delicious. Had to find a place for liquids to wash it down, but all was good. My friend also had a burger and fries, which seemed good and delicious as well - at least she ate most of it before getting full up. Still, I wasn&#39;t too impressed with what Westwood Tavern had to offer. Although good service and good food was adamantly was there, I felt like there was something lacking. Maybe it was the air conditioning. Not sure though. 

Since my Schaumburg friend loves to go here with her friends, maybe it&#39;s a good ideal place to hang out after work or on the weekends.

Support local!

Great food choices are the natchos, the guac, pot roast, grilled cheese, I also like their salads as well. What I dont like is their sushi. But then again if I visit an american sports bar I am not bound to have some kick ass rolls. I am bound to overpay but not necessaily love them.

Overall the meal was affordable and we had leftovers to look forward to. (well, not the meatloaf, it was devoured as it was served over mashed potatoes with onion straws on top.) This is our new great place to go! It was loud, but it was a Friday night. We just wish they opened up earlier on the weekend to watch Premier Soccer League.

While working in the suburbs, Westwood was our post-work spot for drinks and appetizers, especially during patio season. Loaded with a full bar and fireplace, their outdoor seating is convenient and well-staffed. The only thing that would improve it would be a view of something other than the parking lot. But hey, it is the suburbs. 

Mid-average pricing here, but ask for drink specials. I love their tacos and nachos. The serving sizes are quite large so be prepared to share. 

What I love most about this joint is the atmosphere. Even inside, you feel as if you&#39;re not in the suburbs. It&#39;s got that semi-dark atmosphere that makes it mysterious enough for evening outings, yet appropriate for an escape during the work day.

I ordered the foot long grilled cheese. The sauteed mushrooms and tender braised short rib meat really made a classic American comfort food taste a little more sophisticated and unique. The fries came out lightly seasoned and crispy; very enjoyable. And no visit to Westwood is complete without a little banana cream pie. The homemade graham cracker crumbs are moist and chewy, they almost remind me of a soft brown sugar cookie. Throw in the homemade custard, whipped cream, caramel, and plenty of bananas...for six bucks? It&#39;s tough to find a better dessert value than that! 

Service was solid, they brought me some jalapeno aioli for the fries. Although I would have liked a to go container for it when I asked for the fries to go.

I ordered a roll of their sushi and their salad.  The sushi roll was pretty bad.  I didn&#39;t really wanted to finish it.  I wish I remembered what kind of sushi it was, but the fish wasn&#39;t very good and neither was the rice.  Their salad was amazing though.  It was large enough to be a meal (which I was scared I would still be hungry).  The salad had cranberries, pecans, and a cranberry vinaigrette. YUMMY!  My dad had their corn bread appetizer and their meatloaf.  The corn bread tasted too sweet and had a weird texture.  I didn&#39;t care for it.  The meatloaf was pretty salty since it was wrapped in bacon and had friend onions garnished on top.

The times that I have been here, there have always been some kind of game on, the last time being this weekend, it was Preakness/the end of a pathetic game 2 of the Western Conf. Stanley Cup semi-finals.  But I digress...

I&#39;ve always been able to find something to eat here. but I tend to linger towards the fish tacos(for what it is, it&#39;s actually pretty filling) the fish and chips(standard pub fare)and the sushi.  I know, sushi at this place?  How can it be that good?  It&#39;s actually not bad.  Fresh ingredients, pretty standard rolls, I&#39;m telling you, a tight wrap with good rice goes a long way.  

The menu is two-sided, with one side dedicated to the items with ABV% and the other half to food.  But there&#39;s something for every taste as far as food goes flatbreads, apps, burgers, there&#39;s even a fish option if you&#39;re so inclined.  My latest discovery at Westwood was the Tavern Chopped Salad.  Yum-O.  I wish it was chopped romaine, but I&#39;m fine with iceberg.  Topped with sliced avocado, hard boiled egg, chicken, BACON and bleu cheese and tossed with ranch dressing, I thought it was plenty big for one to tackle, and probably the right size for splitting.  I had to really dig deep to down this dish(omg, I didn&#39;t mean to alliterate that LOL) since I wasn&#39;t going to be able to store my leftovers soon enough and with the summer-like temps we had this weekend, I wasn&#39;t chancing it.  I killed it.  

My wife had the sweet chili salmon with the sauted green beans, holy schnikes, the green beans were so good, I wish they were offered as their own side dish.  Sauted with garlic and tomatoes and who knows what else, I ate the rest of her plate after I finished my salad.  

Like I said, I&#39;ve always liked the food here, and we&#39;ve always had good service, whether dining with just my wife or with a 20 person dinner party, service is always tip-top.

Haven&#39;t had a chance to eat on the patio, for some reason it&#39;s always freezing cold or burning hot when we come here.

From the food to the atmosphere, this place is my favorite restaurant to go to.  My cousin brought me here my first weekend moving to the Chicago suburbs.  Now, I take all of my friends and family here when they visit! It&#39;s a great place to come and watch football, basketball and hockey or enjoy a lunch or dinner with some friends. 

They have booths for groups that have taps at your convenience!  This is great for bringing a group here to watch the big game.  The servers are always very friendly and are more than happy to get the tap started for you.  I&#39;ve never had a bad server at Westwood!  Calling ahead is no problem - and they are very accommodating. I&#39;ve tried almost everything at Westwood in my time of going here, however below is my Top Food List picks:

westwood-tavern-schaumburg-3,Sarah S.,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,Proa2Wdv47yLutbUOuBtbg,"I&#39;ve been to Westwood more times than I can count for drinks, many times for food (they randomly have sushi), and a few months ago I had my company&#39;s holiday party. 

Every year, I plan the company party and this year I knew I wanted to hire a casino company to come in. I then had to find a venue that had a nice bar package (we&#39;re a company full of social drinkers), good food and would allow us bring the casino company in. Enter the hidden gem to hold parties: Westwood. I had no idea they had a basement that was huge where people hold company parties, weddings and other events. Not only that but it&#39;s an AWESOME space. 

Westwood was so great in the planning process helping me with the food &amp; drink options and ensuring all was secured for the night of the party. They let me come in 2 hours before the event started to get everything ready. Much to my surprise the place looked beyond fantastic! It was the holidays and they had a couple of beautifully decorated Christmas trees, red tablecloths and very nice place settings along with centerpieces. I had bought poinsettias for all the tables but really they were not at all necessary as they had such nice centerpieces. Our initial bartender I introduced myself to was meh and I was pretty happy when i saw him roll out and another, much more friendly guy come in. They were really good about taking care of us the whole night though they did put a tip jar out. I let all our employees know that we were covering the bartenders tips for the whole night when we signed at the end, so no need for the double dipping.

They had hookups for music and you can play either CDs or bring in an MP3 player to hookup. The sound was great plus their was a mic so I could do my thing. My thing being making annoucements &amp; such not singing. :D

We did a buffet for all of our employees for the night and everyone was really happy with the food selection &amp; how tasty it all was. 

We also had our own personal coat room &amp; bathrooms for the evening.

To boot, the pricing was incredibly reasonable. I believe that we had to meet a minimum of $1000 of food &amp; drinks, then the room rental was at no cost. We were way above that so it was perfect.

I know Westwood is good for meeting friends for drinks. I know it can be great for a casual bite to eat, too. But now I know what a great location it can be to hold events, as well.

westwood-tavern-schaumburg-3,Anthony K.,ctJbyIVhO7niMFqfaM2HJA,fBk9RkWA-3tPaTKjovL5PA,"Me and one of my buddys went here for dinner. He has been here before and suggested to get the foot long grilled cheese but said its not directly on the menu but they can make it. So when our server Alex (Alexandria) came to take our order my friend said &#34;Can i get the foot long grilled cheese, with just the 3 cheeses on it and bacon&#34; okay and soup and fires okay with that. He said hes and i asked for the same thing. When our food came we looked at our sandwichs and there was mushrooms and some type of brisket. When we asked our server what did she give us. She said &#34;thats what you ordered&#34;. We said &#34;no we said a grilled cheese with the 3 cheeses and just bacon&#34;. Then she informed us that they don&#39;t make that. We were confused because for 1. He got it before. And for 2. We specifically said &#34;just the 3 cheeses and bacon&#34;. She failed to understand what we wanted and failed to wite it down properly for the cooks to make it as we ordered. So it was her fault. 

Not to mention she messed up our drink orders giving me a diet coke when i asked for a coke and giving my friend a coke when he asked for a sprite. And then we had empty drinks for over 10 minutes. Which ruined our meal even more than the messed up sandwiches. She barley came to our table and was never around. And after we were noticeably done with our meals, ya know with our napkins on our plates and plates stacked up. We had to wait an additional 10 minutes for her to notice and bring us our bill. 

Needless to say i was very disappointed",30/08/15,154,2,1,-1,-53,-1.8066999999999998,0.41100000000000003,2.034,17.555999999999997,No,1555

That said, we went for lunch and that vibe was not there.
Our server was nice, but not great with refills or checking in.
The food was okay, again, not memorable.
I ordered the Fish Tacos.  They come as &#34;build yourself&#34;.  The Fish was seasoned well, but overcooked which made it dry and not flake-able. The toppings that came with were gauac, tomatoes, onion and cilantro.  There was also a large helping of black beans and rice.  
My friend ordered a special with was Buffalo Chicken with Tots.  The chicken and sauce came all mixed in with the tots - like a casserole.  He thought it was good, but the tots were soggy from too much sauce.

Where to start? Everything was amazing! I got a cup of their cheddar ale soup with bacon, my goodness I was actually sad when I took the last bite {I&#39;m such a foodie}. The flavor was excellent and the bacon was the perfect complement. I also got the Jack cheese covered pretzel- yuuuuuum. It was huge, and smothered in cheese. I got the apricot habanero dipping sauce. It wasn&#39;t my favorite (disclaimer I&#39;m not normally a sweet/spicy combination), but if you like apricot and spice I&#39;m sure it was perfect. My hubby ordered the salted and cinnamon pretzels, he devoured them both. 

Overall, we will absolutely be back. The location itself is very small, don&#39;t plan on eating there (although there is a cute little bar top area with about 4 seats). But it&#39;s clean, organized, and super cute. I did read on the sign that they close early if they sell out, so plan to get there early. We went around 2pm and the pickings were running out.

gnarly-knots-pretzel-co-winfield,J J.,0v_LatPGE7G-NcRYJr3SIA,BlHjnvmlWrbOIHnusvxkiA,"ok, that&#39;s as good as it gets here.  Firstly, you want to get here as early in the day as possible, for two reasons:  one, they will sell out of the special of the day if you get there after 2pm, and two, the pretzles get dried out the longer they sit under those heat lamps, so by 2 or 3pm, they are hardly worth eating. Dunking them in the soup doesn&#39;t help even.  Honestly, I don&#39;t think I ever had a fresh pretzel that wasn&#39;t sitting around all day there.
Ok, next, the soups are very good. I would go there for those alone, but its a better value to purchase pretzel and soup combo.  Just now I won&#39;t go there unless its early in the day so the pretzel isn&#39;t dried out, I hope.  Think Aunt Annies pretzels, they are hardly worth eating after they have sat around too.

Came here one afternoon with the family (my hubs and toddler) for a quick lunch. I&#39;d been wanting to try this place for a while so we decided to trek on over. They had garlic and cheese pretzel for the Daily Special. I wasn&#39;t too excited about it but my husband and I each got one plus a cup of soup. We split the pretzels and soup between us and our daughter. The soup was extremely hot. Like, this was going to give me 3rd degree burns if I even got a little splash on me. Give the soup a few minutes to cool down because it is worth it! It wasn&#39;t excessively salty like most restaurant soups. It tasted homemade - delicious!

On to our pretzels. They were scrumptious and every bite was a perfect ratio of pretzel to cheese. It came with a marinara dipping sauce that was unique and fit the pretzel perfectly.

It was a crisp &amp; sunny afternoon so we grabbed a spot on one of their picnic tables in the back. I think there are maybe 3-4 tables so not a lot of seating - and only outdoors FYI.

Overall this is a great little spot! I am going to be back in here whenever I&#39;m in the vicinity.",20/04/16,139,4,2,5,44,5.381600000000001,3.307,0.324,16.369,No,1304

And my four year old son proclaimed &#34;These are the best pretzels ever!&#34;  

The space is small--like a pop up store small. But on nice days you can have a seat outside on some of their deck chairs and enjoy them.  

The day we visited there was a small line--about 5 people but it moved quickly.  I got the stuffed pretzel fo the day--Monterrey Jack Cheese and a plain salted.  The dough has that nice pretty brown crust and very soft chew.  The stuffed pretzel was stuffed with really good mild cheese and an automatic fave.  They offer dipping sauces but since we were on the go we will have to try the sauces next time. The Apricot Habanero sauce and Creamy Mustard sounded really good. 

They also offer soft drinks in their cooler (and my favorite Pelligrino!), pretzel chips, soups, and you can pre-order mini pretzels and giant pretzels too.

We drove up from Naperville on a weekday near opening time to see what all the fuss was about. The location is great, the place is super clean and well organized, and they offer just enough on the menu. 

We had the salami and provolone stuffed pretzel, as well as the garlic/parm and Monterrey Jack pretzels. I ordered two dipping sauces (creamy mustard and apricot habanero), both of which were pretty meh, but didn&#39;t set me back much. To round out our meal, and potentially entice the little one to eat a bit, we ordered cups of the broccoli cheddar soup and tomato bisque.

The pretzels were really delicious. The stuffed one was awesome. The other two lacked a little flavor, but were tender and moist- obviously freshly made. Soups were too thick and not blended down quite enough, but I appreciated having it to round out the meal. We sat outside on the deck on a gorgeous day, and that made it all the nicer.

I quickly changed my mind as I&#39;ve been wanting to check this place out.  I knew it was in Winfield, though never seen the place.  It&#39;s right in downtown Winfield near the train station, hospital, etc.  It&#39;s a cute little place for sure!  Simple menu here...pretzels &amp; soup.

They have a &#34;pretzel of the day&#34; and &#34;soup of the day&#34; ...the day I was there, it was Italian Beef.  I have to say this thing was AMAZING!  It&#39;s a large pretzel stuffed with Italian Beef and very filling! That&#39;s all I needed for lunch!  There are also regular &#34;daily&#34; pretzels for sale, my friend ordered the hot dog pretzel, also day old pretzels on clearance, pretzel bread, pretzel chips, etc.  There is even an interesting dessert menu...which I need to try one of these days when I&#39;m allowing myself a &#34;cheat day&#34;!!!

What&#39;s not to love about this fabulous little shack o&#39; deliciousness? It&#39;s small, it&#39;s local, it&#39;s fresh, it&#39;s active on social media, it&#39;s owned by people who have the cuuuuutest French bulldog, and most importantly: they do one thing, and they do it really, really well. 

I had first heard of Gnarly Knots through Facebook, where they advise eagerly awaiting fans of their weekly specials and up and coming offers. Maybe I&#39;m a giant nerd but I LOVE this idea. It&#39;s what roped me in. Every week I watched the Facebook page for a flavor I couldn&#39;t live without, which was when I wanted to dive in and try one of these famed pretzels. Unfortunately, the hype is real, and so are the lines to wait for these special pretzels. So I went with a backup plan, and when I was on vacation in a weekday, scurried over to try the deliciousness with no wait!

It really is kind of a shack - a teensy tiny shack that would be pretty easy to miss if I hadn&#39;t been stalking it for weeks. I parked, climbed the stairs, and walked in to the smell of fresh made pretzel heaven. I ordered a Monterey Jack stuffed pretzel and a cinnamon sugar with cinnamon creme dipping sauce. My order was ready in .000034 seconds and I jumped in the car to head home and eat.

Typically, pretzels aren&#39;t my favorite foods, but I tell you these are pretzels done RIGHT. Soft, fresh, warm, chewy... They&#39;re perfect. The cheese stuffed pretzel was loaded with gooey melted cheese and was a salty, decadent delight. The cinnamon sugar pretzel was a perfect sweet ending to my meal, and I could have eaten about four of the cinnamon creme sauces. So good.

I came back this past weekend just to ensure I was appropriately in love with this place and tried their Italian sausage stuffed pretzel dog with provolone cheese and a side of marinara. AMAZING. But the most amazing?! Their PRETZEL bread pudding loaded with apples and creme anglaise! Brilliant, innovative, decadent, and addicting. Who knew pretzels could be so much fun?! 

If all you know of soft pretzels is movie theaters and baseball games, do yourself a favor and get over to Gnarly Knots. Let them elevate pretzels for you and change your mind for good. And also try to spy their adorable pooch while you&#39;re there, because the only thing in my world that can make a 5-star establishment better is a love of cute canines!",21/06/15,282,5,3,5,75,11.359900000000003,7.380000000000001,0.7070000000000001,20.913,No,2430

There are tables and seats outside and u can eat inside to but there are only 2 seats. Never had a bad experience just think they need to work on making the special pretzels taste better  
All in all good nice cute spot to come with the family 

Buffalo chicken pretzel: the pretzel texturally is really good not soggy not to hard. The filling was really good there was alot of chicken but since they fried it it became really soggy like mush like u know when u eat can vegetables and u can squish them  in ur hand and they completely  disintegrate. So they should have grilled it or panfried it The dipping sauce was also really good i ate all of it its that cant believe its not butter with buffalo sauce. I just wish they would fill the whole pretzel up cUse when u finish ur left with alot of pretzel

Cookie doe pretzel :this was really could i was skeptical because alot of people use cheap chocolate thats not that good but it was really good. It was really like eating cookie doe from a bowl. Again they need to fill the whole thing up with the ingredient because u end up with alot of pretzel left over n a dipping sauce would have been perfect.

Italian pretzel provolone cheese with marinara sauce: picture a gormea pretzel dog. It was really good the spices on top were really delicious wish there was some on the bottom or more on top. The actual sausage was really tender. It was a plain sausage i wish it would have been a spicy one. They needed to grill it because i think it tastes better if they cant grill it then panfry it for some texture. Regarding the marinara sauce it was cold they should have warmed it up it was a really plain sauce nothing special alot of oregano 

Pretzel bread pudding: the texture of it was good not to dry could be a lil more moist though. when i was eating it i didnt see alot of apples in it. The sauce is like a cinnamon bun with cinnamon in it though i didnt really care for the sauce on it wasnt my favorite i was expecting something really amaizin and different wouldnt order again.",20/06/15,235,3,2,5,34,5.308400000000001,2.5789999999999997,0.45599999999999996,12.966,No,2135

We missed out on the daily special (they go quick) so we ordered the garlic Parmesan.  That&#39;s a good pretzel!  We also tried the sweet option, which was a pretzel bread pudding.  I don&#39;t recall the exact flavor, but it was great!

1. The pretzels are absolutely fabulous and are very unique! They even offer sweet AND savory pretzels. My personal favorites include the Cookie Dough stuffed pretzel and the Bacon Mac and Cheese stuffed pretzel. 
2. The only problems with this place are that there are limited amounts of their &#34;specials&#34; for the day, so we have to wait in line for about forty minutes to insure that we receive those specific pretzels. In addition, it is very small with limited space to wait indoors, so if the weather is not cooperating that day, it might not be the best time to get a pretzel.
Overall, I would definitely recommend Gnarly Knots. The pretzels are delicious and they will indeed satisfy one&#39;s sweet tooth!",17/01/16,90,4,2,3,24,2.5677000000000003,2.2720000000000002,0.273,6.454999999999999,No,830

The regular pretzels are thick, maybe 2-3 times the size of those mall pretzels, so the stuffed pretzels are even more monstrous.  It came with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.

I also tried the Cinnamon Sugar pretzel, which wasn&#39;t anything special.  It needed more cinnamon and sugar!  The savory stuffed pretzels are the star of the show here.  

They also give out free mini pretzels on National Pretzel Day - who knew there was such a thing?

Bonus points for stocking Blood Orange Pellegrino in the cooler.

I feel like this place is sort of in the middle of nowhere, but it&#39;s not.  The business is located in an old, charming white house, near Central DuPage Hospital.  Their hours are really limited, so you have to go during the day or on the weekend.  So if you have your heart set on the day&#39;s special, get there early in case they sell out.

So it&#39;s a tiny joint in Winfield that has some out door seating and two bar stools inside.  But from what I have seen and experienced, it&#39;s hard to even make it back to your car once you have to goods in your hand.

They have your regular slated pretzel, which, if you know anything about pretzels...t requires yellow mustard!  These pretzels are tasty and just the right amount of salt and chew on the &#39;skin&#39; of the pretzel.  You can purchase cheese dip and other dips.  The cheese dip is good.

They have a few other pretzels that have some cheese on the outside of them, great as well.

Now the &#39;stuffed&#39; pretzels....they serve a fixed stuffed pretzel menu every day...one kind of stuffed pretzel each day of the week.  The bottom part of the pretzel is what is stuffed.  The Porker is lick your lips delicious, Jack cheese stuffed is amazing....

Other pretzels we have enjoyed include: tuxedo white chocolate cake, bacon/tator tot, italian beef, gyro, meatball/mozzarella, and caramel apple stuffed. They were all delicious.

gnarly-knots-pretzel-co-winfield,Brande O.,bkZlAdArOw0s8x1AaJ36Mg,sxdnk1hvKRWAsBTEkkHiaA,"A PRETZEL RESTAURANT! This might actually be my definition of heaven. As soon as I saw this place come across my Yelp feed, I bookmarked it for a visit. Yes, I actually drove about an hour round-trip to eat a pretzel, and it was totally worth it.

First let me say that I love the whole idea of this place. I checked out their website shortly after seeing it here, and their story is great. A true little community support success story. It is nice to see, and I feel even better to help support that too.

A little about the place - I see that it often gets quite crowded, though we didn&#39;t have that issue during our visit (around 12:30 on a Saturday). There were other people there, but we didn&#39;t have to wait in line and they had plenty of hot fresh pretzels ready. They have two parking lots available, so plenty of space, though the restaurant itself is very tiny. It is a walk-up establishment with a tiny indoor waiting area and a counter for eating that only seats about 2-3 people. It is a converted house, so most of the space is in the back for cooking the food. They do have a few tables outside though, if the weather is nice and you want to &#34;dine in.&#34; I think they probably get much of their business from CDH, which is right across the intersection.

They have a variety of tasty pretzels (obviously) but also soup, cookies, and pretzel buns to go. Check out their menu or their Facebook page for their daily specials, since the pretzels available rotate each day. They also have special stuffed pretzels on Saturday. My husband and I both tried the classic salted pretzel, with jalapeno cheese dip. It was great! The size is generous, and it is served warm. It isn&#39;t overly salted, and tastes delicious. I&#39;d definitely like to go back to try their other types, especially the stuffed, but wanted to stay traditional for our first visit.

Once the doors opened, things seemed to move pretty fast. My only complaint is because the shop is so small, crowds had little room to move while waiting for their food.

These specialty pretzels are totally worth their $6 price tag. Considering these were my first stuffed pretzel, I was surprised to see only the bottom was stuffed. But I can&#39;t blame them, stuffing the entire thing would be a major pain in the ass. 

The beef brisket was phenomenal. I seriously want their brisket recipe. This thing was stuffed full too, no skimping on the meat. 

The Oreo cheesecake was really good, not sure if I&#39;d get it again. I love cheesecake and maybe it was because it was warm, the cheesecake had a different texture but the taste was definitely there. 

I also tried their original pretzel chips. They were average. Less salty than the ones you get in the grocery store but I&#39;m happy to support local businesses.",17/07/14,122,4,1,3,-2,2.1939,2.406,1.085,11.509,No,1102

After seeing Heidi K&#39;s review on the 3rd, I knew that I&#39;d need to make a visit stat. I talked to one of my friends whom, much like me, is always down for a good road trip. We decided to head here this past Tuesday. 

I was already aware of the mnimal seating from prior reviews but it was a nice day out, so at the very least- I knew we could just bask in the sun and hang out on the curb.  We were fortunate enough to grab the one and only patio table right as someone else was heading out. Woohoo!

I ordered the french onion soup and the POTD (pretzel of the day.. I just made that up) which was salami and provolone. I asked the girl working what her recommendation was on sauce and she said the mustard. My friend ordered the cheese topped with nacho cheese, as well as a soup. Our total was around $18 which I thought was a good price. Also, the girl working was really friendly. 

My pretzel was heaven on earth. The dough itself was perfect and the salami inside was sooo good. The mustard really complemented the pretzel well and I ended up using all of it. I honestly could have ordered two mustards that&#39;s how good they were. 

They list their daily pretzels and soups on the website, so make sure to check it out. I also found out from perusing their site that they will be on Chicago&#39;s Best soon. 

The only docked star is they REALLY need a bigger place soon. We came in around 1 PM and there wasn&#39;t much room to stand to wait for our pretzel. Hopefully they&#39;re so successful that they expand to a 2nd location soon!",08/05/14,184,4,2,5,25,8.1441,4.793,0.0,16.207,No,1654

Due to their hours, I was only able to check them out on Saturday (and that goes for repeat visits in the future as well), which was a bit of a headache.

You see, unlike the size of their pretzels, GN and its lot are small. It took me a few attempts to park. I first pulled in to find no parking. So I left and came back about an hour later and managed to snag the last open spot. 
Then there&#39;s the shop itself. Folks, there&#39;s no dining in here. There&#39;s a picnic table out back, a small bistro table near the door, and a tiny bar with two stools right when you walk in, but that&#39;s it. Grab your pretzel n&#39; move along. The line was out the door but luckily it moved fairly quickly. 

Once inside, I noticed today&#39;s specials were the oreo and cheesecake pretzel, and the tator tot, bacon, and cheese pretzel. Say what?!?! Oreo and cheesecake in a pretzel? Bacon, tator tots AND cheese?! Sweet mother of jesus... why have I NOT attempted to visit here sooner? I knew immediately the tator tot version would be my choice (the cheesecake wouldn&#39;t have sat well with me. *sigh).

After a few minutes of standing in line, it was finally my turn to order. I ordered the above mentioned special and a bottle of water. The total came out to a little over $8. Quite the sticker shock, but I quickly got over it and paid. I received my pretzel (hot and fresh from the oven, nonetheless) and made my way back to my car.

I opened the bag and once I saw the size of the pretzel, the price tag justified the product. Fans of Auntie Anne&#39;s, take note- those &#34;pretzel perfect pretzels everytime&#34; don&#39;t stand a chance to Gnarly Knots. First of all these pretzels are HUGE. They are stuffed with delicious goodies. They are thick, soft, chewy, and bursting with flavor (depending on what you get, of course). Secondly, if you neglected to eat the pretzel the day you purchased it (blasphemy!), its rock hard structure could easily be used days later to ward off a carjacker or rabid animal attack. Okay, maybe not, but I wouldn&#39;t rule it out completely.

Lisa was asking what I wanted to do for lunch today... she threw ou a couple of ideas.. so me (feeling a bit salty) said that I might just run over to Gnarly Knots later.

Italian beef - this thing was delicious, loaded with very tasty Italian beef, it came with a side of hot gardinera and au jus. I would highly recommend this pretzel to anyone. 8/10

Cinnamon sugar - this one on the other hand was quite bland, even with the cinnamon creme dip. I am a huge fan of cinnamon raisin bagels. I wanted this to be the cinnamon crunch bagel from panera, lots of flavor on the top and tiny pockets of cinnamon goo throughout the pretzel. What it seemed like was a standard pretzel that someone dropped in a bucket of cinnamon sugar topping. I would give this a 4/10

I spent 24 years in the Philadelphia area, at least 23 of which were pretzel-eating years. These Gnarly Knots pretzels are something that would be appreciated back East, and not just here in the Midwest where we are pretzel-deprived.

The way the shop works is, there are everyday offerings and one special, stuffed offering each day of the week. I had scoured the website to learn the schedule, as well as that the shop produces only a limited batch of pretzels each day. I now understand that Gnarly Knots has a Facebook page as well, so that&#39;s another good source for updates. 

We made it on brisket day, and before the shop ran out, so we enjoyed one stuffed pretzel and two Bavarian (regular) style. Perfectly crisped on the outside, perfectly fluffy and doughy on the inside...these pretzels are something to write home about. 

The space is quite small, but I appreciate that I could at least get in and out with my babe in her stroller. I don&#39;t think they have a restroom, so of course I had to take my son out to pee in the nearby woods while we were there.

My sister says four stars for the lack of an eat-in area (there&#39;s just a tiny bar with two stools). But in fairness, their website clearly tries to dissuade customers from lingering in the tiny space, so I can&#39;t really blame the place. It is what it is, so I say five stars, but it would be nice if they could someday expand to include at least a small dining area. I look forward to going back on pepperoni day and cheeseburger day to enjoy the other stuffed pretzel masterpieces.",28/11/13,183,5,1,5,-27,6.2622,2.348,0.192,11.460000000000003,No,1637

Stuffed Pretzel: Pork Burrito that day: awesome! Tender pork, black beans, rice and a side of sour cream.  Cracked out Chipolte, lol

All I have to say is UH-MAY-ZING. Truly.

Our first visit was the pork burrito stuffed pretzel. I have to admit, when I read that day&#39;s special I was not impressed. In fact, it didn&#39;t sound appealing to me at all. But, we were dying to give this place a try and we weren&#39;t sure when we&#39;d get another opportunity to get there (it&#39;s probably about a 35-40 minute drive) so we went.

And I am SO GLAD we did. I tried that pork burrito stuffed and it was .... no words. Just fantastic. The flavor was excellent. Everything about it was great.

This past weekend we stopped in for the chicken parmesan stuffed. It, too, was delicious, but so far that pork burrito remains the #1 choice (but, I&#39;ve only been lucky enough to try 2 of the many kinds they make...).

We&#39;ve also tried the chocolate croissant pretzel as well as the lemon cookie. Both were also very, very good. But, for the price -- I&#39;d almost rather buy another stuffed and forgo the dessert.

Can&#39;t wait to go again -- I&#39;ve got my eyes on the gyro, italian beef, bbq brisket and reuben stuffed!!",08/12/14,135,5,1,5,-2,4.3469999999999995,4.432,0.582,12.986,No,1124

Gnarly Knots came up and after seeing the pictures of the gigantic pretzels I knew we had to go. Omg. So good. I got the Black Forrest cake pretzel. There was a big chunk of chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and cherries. My son got the regular salted pretzel and my husband got the pretzel dog. The pretzel dog was really really good too.

gnarly-knots-pretzel-co-winfield,Toni S.,dCLlQfMJbajOFmcIyyAHMA,l7rlRFzUtNDImHmOuexS8g,"It was our first time visiting Gnarly Knots.  After seeing a spot on Chicago&#39;s Best and all the reviews on here, just had to try it.  Was not disappointed!

I love small, local businesses that do what they do, well!  It&#39;s near downtown Winfield, in a small house that is buzzing with people.  I can see why.

It is tiny, with no indoor seating, but really cute.  You get what you want and go.  They do have a picnic table, maybe 2 outside, but I&#39;m sure most people eat it in their cars or take it to go.  

They have a limited menu and a special stuffed pretzel of the day.  They say get there early, because you might not get one if you get there too late.  We got there in time to get one of the special Monterey Jack cheese stuffed.  OMG was it good!  That little bit chewy on the outside, tender on the inside and it seemed like there was a pound of beautiful, gooey cheese inside.  It really was perfection!

We also got a couple Pretzel Dogs.  They put the jumbo beef hot dogs in there.  I just loved it.  I bet they have dipping sauces for these, but when you&#39;re a newbie and overly excited about everything, we forgot to ask or look, but even if there are sauces, they were delicious without anything at all!  I just looked at their website.  They have sauces.  Big dummy here. 

We shared one of the cinnamon sugar pretzels.  This was my least favorite and only because I felt like it was missing some icing or something.  And again.. probably my fault for not looking around.. cause I&#39;m a spaz like that.

It&#39;s obvious they use quality ingredients and put a lot of care into their product.  If it wasn&#39;t hot, today, I would love to try some of their soup, sometime.  I bet it&#39;s just as good as their pretzels!

They&#39;ve expanded their menu so their daily pretzel of the day changes more frequently and that is a good thing.  Pulled pork stuffed pretzel?  Yep!  Cheese stuffed pretzel?  Yep!  Italian Sausage stuffed pretzel?  Yep!  A Vienna beef dog wrapped in pretzel dough?  Yep! You get the picture.

They also do a variety of soups.  I hear they are quite good but for me it is all about the carb laden stuffed wonderment of a pretzel that gets me every time.  Don&#39;t forget to get a side of mustard sauce made with creme fraiche.  Delicious!

I love seeing the line outside the door on Saturday mornings.  During nice weather, it takes on a carnival like atmosphere with folks tossing footballs and frisbees.  You cannot help but smile when you see that!

Today&#39;s (Tuesday) special wasn&#39;t something that appealed so I went with the cinnamon sugar instead..a can&#39;t miss.  I also had a bite of my sons standard salt pretzel.  
The dough in both was very good.  Fresh, soft and warm..a trio that every pretzel should have.  The cinnamon sugar cover was a tad lacking.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it tasted fine, but there wasn&#39;t enough cinnamon or sugar for my liking.
We also got one of the big monster cookies.  That was pretty awesome.  Chocolate chip with pretzel chips..you get the sweet and sour..the best of both worlds.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever eaten a pretzel that hasn&#39;t been from a chain store and I&#39;m loving it! I wasn&#39;t feeling a stuffed pretzel so this review will be for their unstuffed ones.

I got the cheese topped and cinnamon pretzels. The pretzel itself it as good as it gets. Huge pretzel so you get what you pay for and texture is perfect. My only wish is that the cinnamon one had more cinnamon-sugar on it.

Along with the pretzels, I ordered the nacho cheese sauce and cinnamon creme sauce. I wasn&#39;t a fan of these. I don&#39;t know if they make it themselves or not. Nacho cheese was pretty typical but the cinnamon creme tasted like sour horchata to me. It wasn&#39;t a bad sour, like they added lemon juice, but it was just kind of odd in that sort of dipping sauce. I think the pretzels taste the best without the sauces.

I&#39;m definitely curious about their stuffed pretzels. I&#39;ll visit sometime again and try those out. Also, I heard that they sometimes serve pretzel croissants! Oh, I need to try that one.

Side note: I think it&#39;s funny that people complain about how many pretzels they make and their odd hours. Yeah, it&#39;s weird, but they aren&#39;t a chain. I also think it makes them more popular to only have a limited amount of stuffed pretzels. It&#39;s smart of them. Not saying I know how businesses are run, but I can see why they do it.

I&#39;m partial to the stuffed pretzels, and the rest of the family seems to prefer the more traditional ones.  The soups have been very good too, as have the pretzel dogs.

The way this place works is a bit &#34;different&#34; though:
1) Expect a bit of a wait when they first open.  They are popular, and since they have been known to run out, sometimes there is a line out the door and into the parking lot.  Even when it is 10 degrees out...
2) This is a small house with a &#34;pretzel kitchen&#34; inside.  Don&#39;t expect a dine-in experience.  While there is a bathroom (our 4yr-old had an &#34;emergency,&#34;) it is clearly not intended for public use.  The design is, quite simply, &#34;Get your pretzel and head on out!&#34;

You can only order a minimum of 6 of their daily special, even paying 3 days in advance.  Selling out before closing time is understandable but not being able to preorder 5 to-go seems counterproductive.
My first visit was just at closing time (as they suggest on phone), to get 4 of the daily special since I couldn&#39;t pre order that morning.  It was the pepperoni stuffed one, which was really good.  They did have a small number of (daily) stock left.  Not sure if they are banking on the exclusivity and word-of-mouth of short supply, but that certainly doesn&#39;t keep them at the top of my food choice since there&#39;s no certainty of getting any product.  

The service is decent and I feel the prices are in line with the uniqueness of the product.  My 3 visits must have been off peak hours as I&#39;ve never waited in line or seen more that one other customer there.  I have heard of the lines but have not experienced it myself.

I feel like there is much room to improve, and that&#39;s a good thing! I was impressed with how friendly the people were in the shop and with the overall presentation of the food.

The pretzels are fresh and hot. We tried the Bavarian, cheese and pretzel dog. The pretzel dog was AWESOME! I had a mustard cream dipping sauce with it which was light flavor and went well with the dog. The cheese pretzel tasted just like the Bavarian pretzel, just with crunchy cheese on top, which didn&#39;t affect the flavor. And the Bavarian was a good size, good flavor and just enough salt.

Gotta go back sometime to try the stuffed pretzels, but it&#39;s a little difficult with the limited hours.",12/08/13,86,4,2,5,30,4.017900000000001,3.2720000000000002,0.256,7.472,No,725

I have worked in food service and think both, that this is disgusting, and it seems to have been either be part of a hair net or part of what was holding ingredients before they went into the pretzel. yuck. 

That said, the pretzel was good enough that I will try again. I hope they also pick up production (not an easy task, I&#39;m sure) so they can accommodate customers rather than restricting how many pretzels we can buy.

Also there really is almost no seating so I would plan on carry out, especially if it&#39;s not a nice day.

gnarly-knots-pretzel-co-winfield,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,ESXBqYEvmmytFpN3kNABBA,"Consider this review incomplete... but I&#39;m a big fan of the standard pretzels they already have.

Driven here by a Yelp email, I drove by after work to see if they had any pretzels left. As it turns out, they did, but none of the pork-flavored specialty pretzels that I was hoping for. Instead they had three standard pretzels and two pretzels roughly the size of a large pizza at Lou Malnati&#39;s.

I&#39;m a rational guy, so I got two regular pretzels. Auntie Anne&#39;s is nice, but in the end they&#39;re little better than something you might get in a can; these pretzels might have had beer in their batter, for all I know; that&#39;s how much yeast was in them. And the outsides were perfectly leathery, while the insides weren&#39;t tough at all; soft, warm and awesomeness in a knot.

I had two toppings; a hot cheese topping that was nice and spicy, and a mustard-creme fraiche cold topping, which stepped around my dislike of mustard by being both mustardy and sour.

If their stuffed pretzels are anywhere near as good as their standard pretzels, the 5-star rating will stand.",05/07/13,119,5,1,3,-1,2.9191000000000003,1.044,0.08,7.875000000000001,No,1093

The service seemed a bit slow and considering how not busy they were I would have expected quicker service. However this wouldn&#39;t change my mind about coming here again. The location is private but walkable from my place which is great!

Now, the food..... that was great! I ordered the Chopped Cobb Salad with no avocado. My only negative is I would have liked the tomatoes a bit more sliced (or Chopped up) but I enjoyed it nevertheless. My friend ordered breakfast for dinner (they serve breakfast ALL day which is awesome). He had two eggs, with shredded hashbrowns and two fluffy pancakes.

It started off with me ordering a fresh orange juice. The waitress told me its not fresh squeezed anymore. Its out of a can. Well thanks, I&#39;ll stick to water then.... 
We ordered Smoked salmon Benedict and just simply 2 eggs over-easy with toast and hash-browns. I had to send the first eggs back, cause the eggwhite in there was still liquid, which was super gross. Since we were sitting outside I brought my  plate inside to the host, which was completely overwhelmed with me and the &#34;return&#34;. Luckily the bartender jumped in. She was very nice about it, smiled and said no problem. We&#39;ll take care of that. Couple minutes later another plate with a new egg arrived. A little better, but still not perfect over easy.

The plus is, the food here is quite good with good flavors, portion sizes, and prices. The small negatives are that the open layout lends itself to potentially being noisy, plates could be cleared faster, menu layout could be improved, and the kitchen can get too busy at times. With that said, the strength of the food is enough to overcome these small issues.

The loaded fries here are delicious, a huge portion of crispy fries topped with cheese, green onion, sour cream, and bacon. Enough to make one full before they start a meal, even when sharing with several other people.

Linguine with garlic shrimp -- Generous portion of (6 large) shrimp with a delicious creamy sauce, asparagus, and sun dried tomatoes. The sauce was slightly thick for me but still delicious.

Not-your-mother&#39;s-mac &#39;n cheese with Andouille sausage: Nice bouncy texture on the pasta with melted Swiss, smoked gouda &amp; cheddar cheeses. Topped with baked parmesan bread crumbs. Not as salty as one would believe with 4 types of cheeses that work together well. The slight sear to make the andouille sausage crisp was a nice touch.

Classic benedict: Nice crisp hash browns and perfectly poached egg. I really enjoyed the hollandaise sauce which was smooth and creamy but not very salty so it did not distract from the other elements of the dish.

Cafe burger with truffle chips: Not bad, but nothing special for a burger. The truffle chips were a little on the soft side but had a flavorful seasoning.

I got a skillet with chicken sausage, gruyere, and jalapenos ($10.5 skillets including 3 ingredients). The sausage was abundant. Everything tasted fresh. Over easy eggs were cooked to perfection. The only slightly iffy thing was that the hash browns could have been browned a bit more. Nonetheless, all was tasty. Pancakes were fine, but are better at other places mentioned. Some biscuits and gravy connoisseurs at the table said that theirs was a definite standout and may be one of the best that they have ever had.

When we pointed out the error they offered to correct it...however my fiance was most of the way done before the manager came over. I suggested that I was not interested in getting my breakfast remade due to the fact we would both have eaten our breakfast alone. My request was ignored and they brought the new skillet back and it was wrong too. We then sat there for another 20 minutes with empty drinks and the waitress seemed at this point to be ignoring us. I was still waiting on the hot sauce I had requested. 

The manager did not charge us for the skillet boxed it up and insisted that we take it home. Yet it was still wrong. We both decided that the restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere...however it did not make up for the extremely poor service, inability to get an order right...and their ability to make a bad situation worse by charging us $12.50 for a skillet.

No complaints - service was good, and the food was excellent.  A little chilly inside, but not really an issue.  

One ordered Not Your Mama&#39;s mac and cheese with the bacon and sausage - delicious and a huge portion that&#39;ll make a nice lunch tomorrow.  Creamy, crispy bacon and sausage.  Another ordered the chicken francese - lightly breaded chicken with a side of broccolini and mashed potates.  I had the grilled salmon with spinach.  I had asked to have broccolini in place of the rice, but got both - no worries even though they charged me for the extra vegetable.  My husband had the rice, so nothing went to waste.

The atmosphere is appealing and we were excited to try the food.  We ordered the mini sliders for my daughter after reading the review on the Kraft mac and pizza - sliders were delicious and homemade.  Unlike the sliders, the burgers that two of the adults ordered were not - they appeared to be packaged burgers and cooked well done, despite asking for medium.  Sounded like the over cooked meat was happening at the two tables near us.  I received the wrong sandwich (Reuben) but that was correctly quickly with the right one. Average as far as sandwiches go.  

I was watching the manger floating around and he was spending more time at the bar area mingling with someone that we thought was maybe the owner instead of checking how tables were doing in the big open area.  Saw several servers running to correct orders with the kitchen and wondered if it was the servers not catching the wrong orders or the cooks not reading them right - however, frustrating for all.   

The server asked the Manager to visit us so we could talk to him about the burgers being overcooked and my wrong order - he took the defense and the first thing said tp me was &#39;it&#39;s day 3&#39;.  Disappointing to hear because I am a customer whether it&#39;s day 3 or day 28 - we know it&#39;s day 3, we&#39;ve watched the building being remolded for quite some time however; we are still a customer and could have been a return one.  

My take on their food - pre packaged and average.  Unless this place makes a change to the quality of their food - something more homemade vs packaged, not sure it&#39;s going to make it.

My Marsala also was excellent.  A wonderful mushroom wine sauce, and you could taste the hint of wine  

Both meals were excellent.  They took long enough, maybe 15 minutes or so, to know they were made to order.  So many places today will serve a similarly named plate in 5 minutes. 

The before dinner bread plate was very taste, as were our dinner salads.  Attentive wait staff and the chef stopped by the table towards the end of meals to ask how everything was and answer a few of our questions.

Their coffee? Usually I am a three cup plus one to go person- I barely finished one cup. Bitter is a good way to describe it. 
The hash browns came out overcooked but my omelette was decent.

We were very pleasantly surprised at the quality of our dinners. I had the broiled trout special with a delicious asparagus yogurt sauce and fabulous grilled zucchini and carrots.

Nothing special. The calamari was fair - tasted fresh, but was overcooked. I ordered the &#34;grove rueben&#34; sandwich, which was just so-so. It wasn&#39;t fresh like you&#39;d get at a deli, but since this isn&#39;t a deli it was as good as you&#39;d expect. The corned beef was a bit chewy though, and the rye bread (which I ordered toasted) was soggy on the side that was touching the plate. I didn&#39;t like that bc it made me think that the sandwich was not made to order. The sweet potato fries seemed fresh, but they weren&#39;t very flavorful.

The atmosphere is appealing and we were excited to try the food.  We ordered the mini sliders for my daughter after reading the review on the Kraft mac and pizza - sliders were delicious and homemade.  Unlike the sliders, the burgers that two of the adults ordered were not - they appeared to be packaged burgers and cooked well done, despite asking for medium.  Sounded like the over cooked meat was happening at the two tables near us.  I received the wrong sandwich (Reuben) but that was correctly quickly with the right one. Average as far as sandwiches go.  

I was watching the manger floating around and he was spending more time at the bar area mingling with someone that we thought was maybe the owner instead of checking how tables were doing in the big open area.  Saw several servers running to correct orders with the kitchen and wondered if it was the servers not catching the wrong orders or the cooks not reading them right - however, frustrating for all.   

The server asked the Manager to visit us so we could talk to him about the burgers being overcooked and my wrong order - he took the defense and the first thing said tp me was &#39;it&#39;s day 3&#39;.  Disappointing to hear because I am a customer whether it&#39;s day 3 or day 28 - we know it&#39;s day 3, we&#39;ve watched the building being remolded for quite some time however; we are still a customer and could have been a return one.  

My take on their food - pre packaged and average.  Unless this place makes a change to the quality of their food - something more homemade vs packaged, not sure it&#39;s going to make it.  If trying to be more swanky than a diner in the end, the  product should represent that!",17/02/15,185,2,1,1,-29,0.5727000000000005,0.852,0.45400000000000007,12.693999999999997,No,1789

There are just too many great places to experience for the same amount of money.

It doesn&#39;t look like it.  The service was OK, some guy was rushing from the kitchen to take our order, but was quick....It&#39;s pretty much a basic place to get a quick bite to eat...but I&#39;ve gotten better trekking thru off beaten paths at mom and pop shops for less than half the price.  If you&#39;re going to charge a premium for some scrambled eggs and bacon, put a little more into it....but....they are paying a high rent or mortgage on a premium location on a corner like that, with some substantial overhead....I&#39;m thinking...short on the talent in the kitchen.

My wife had the Chicken Francese and I had the Chicken Marsala.  Both were excellent.  The Francese had a nice light crust along with a light sauce, very tasty with a hint of lemon. 

My Marsala also was excellent.  A wonderful mushroom wine sauce, and you could taste the hint of wine  

Both meals were excellent.  They took long enough, maybe 15 minutes or so, to know they were made to order.  So many places today will serve a similarly named plate in 5 minutes. 

The before dinner bread plate was very taste, as were our dinner salads.  Attentive wait staff and the chef stopped by the table towards the end of meals to ask how everything was and answer a few of our questions.

We have been here twice. Once right before Christmas, and another time a few weeks ago. 
It&#39;s a nice looking place, clean and modern. But, again, after taking years to renovate, they couldnt get a decent heating system? Going to the bathroom is like sitting your butt on an ice cube. Tables in the east side of the restaurant are cold too. 
Their coffee? Usually I am a three cup plus one to go person- I barely finished one cup. Bitter is a good way to describe it. 
The hash browns came out overcooked but my omelette was decent. 
The truffle chips? Would be decent if they actually put anything ON the chips. 
The prices are just TOO high for a neighborhood restaurant. And it would nice if the management/owners conversed with customers rather than sitting at the front booth all the time.

Then the excuses started... There were no clean glasses she said. Which was clearly untrue when other tables were getting their drinks. The appetizer (flatbread) came out and was really good, about 5 minutes after the appetizer we received our drinks. The food came out next and my fries were ice cold and my sons Mac and cheese was
2 colors from sitting so long. We complained to who we assumed was the manager (tall blonde woman) she took my sons Mac and cheese and handed me a plate to put my fries on so they could be heated. This was shocking because I would expect new fries not just microwaved food. My sandwich was ok. My husband liked his soup although again the temperature was off.

First was dinner: Buffalo Chicken Wrap is made with Sriracha, not Buffalo sauce, and the Sriracha is in the ranch, not on the chicken.  Rueben sandwich had extremely tough corned beef, came out of the kitchen cold and soggy and they forgot the swiss! A rueben without swiss?  Kids pizza was over sauced and Kraft Mac n Cheese took the longest our of our 6 meals to come out of the kitchen. Fries were cold, but we did visit on the third day of business, and Tom the owner checked in on us several times.  We chalked this up to  &#39;the first week&#39; and vowed to come back.
Fast forward three weeks and we visited for breakfast.  Eggs were &#39;okay&#39;, not warm when they arrived at our table.  Hash browns tasted &#39;oily&#39; but were cooked to our asking of &#39;crispy&#39;. Overall, their breakfast menu is overpriced for the area.  Coffee is branded as Intelligesta, but at $2.95 for a cup of black coffee, even Starbucks is cheaper! 
We would love to see this restaurant do well, but the prices are a bit high for the area the kitchen could use some more training on the menu and parking lot could benefit from a redesign or expansion.

Tom the owner forced me to serve 8 times a day to people he would pick up the Bill for and then distract them so they didn&#39;t leave tip or harrass me about how other people did their job wrong so its my fault. Most of the serving staff and hostess staff are very deserving of a job there but some may make for a less than amazing experience.

I assume he thought I was joking with him because he just smiled, patted me on the back and walked away.  Either that, or this place is in worse shape than I thought.

The wait person never brought bread, told us only one soup was available, but the table next to us got something entirely different, water was not refilled on a timely basis, nor was my soda--in fact the wait person for the table next to us came over when she saw we were being ignored.

I heard the cashier tell the person in front of me that her order would be ready in about 20 minutes.  Hearing that, I thought, I should be in good shape.  I still had to wait about 10 minutes.  Got the chicken, took it home.

Chicken was delicious and crispy even though it was sitting in a bag for a while.  And, we got a surprise--a good one.  We had ordered two thighs, two drumsticks.  I noticed that the drumsticks were small--but then, instead of two drumsticks I had been given three!  Wow!  I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t happen very often, but lucky me.

The coleslaw was tasty--but we had ordered a medium and were given five little coleslaw cups.  I guess it equaled a medium, so I&#39;m not complaining.

By the way,Harold&#39;s has grape pop in cans.  I love grape pop and can&#39;t find it very often.

Yes, the service is discombulated, the wait is long, and maybe there&#39;s a free-form filling of your order.   However, Harold&#39;s does have the best chicken in the area.  I&#39;ll be back, but I&#39;ll be calling in my order.

In my opinion, the service is horrible. This time, I attempted to call in my order, while driving home. I was put on hold, and left on hold for 12 minutes before hanging up. During the  time I was on hold, I could hear the individual who put me on hold having a conversation with a couple different people. After hanging up, I attempted to call back multiple times, but the line was busy. I arrived at Harold&#39;s about five minutes later. To my surprise, there was only two customers present. I, again, called and let the woman at the counter listen to the busy signal. She asked, &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; I responded that it was the phone at the restaurant. I told her I had been put on hold and left there for 20 minutes. She picked up the cordless, looked at it, then nonchalantly commented, &#34;17 minutes.&#34; I asked her if she was familiar with this restaurant&#39;s service reviews. She responded, &#34;No.&#34; I asked her if she cared. She said, No.&#34; Shocked, I asked, &#34;So you don&#39;t care about having a job?&#34; Before she could respond, I asked asked if the management felt the same way?&#34; She responded, &#34;I make suggestions to the manager and they don&#39;t listen to me, so..&#34; I placed my order, purchasing seven wings. I asked her to wrap the bread separately, paid, then settled in for the typical 20-30 minute wait. To my surprise, my order was ready in about five minutes. When I arrived home a few minutes later, I discovered my toasted bread underneath my rock hard chicken wings. I tried to call the restaurant to complain but there was no answer. I tossed the meal, because it wasn&#39;t fit to eat. 

I have been a Harold&#39;s Fried Chicken customer almost 40 years, and have never experienced anything like described here. Harold&#39;s is known for cooking chicken to order, which obviously was not done in this instance. I must give this restaurant kudos for excellent chicken on my second visit, which was a vast improvement over my first visit. I have never before written a restuarant review, but the horrible attitude of the order taker on duty tonight (Saturday, May 28, 2016 at, 10:25 p.m., was troublesome and motivating. I&#39;ve been an employer for many years -- including being the owner a restaurant. I fired people like this one. I only regret that I don&#39;t have the power to terminate both the cook and clerk in this instance. I won&#39;t be returning to this Harold&#39;s, even though I reside about one minute away.

I don&#39;t think they use the same coming process as say a popeyes - pressure cooker thingy. 

THE FOOD:
The chicken were tasty in my opinion. Good amount of crispiness still after I got it home. The liver was awesome; better than Brown&#39;s chicken liver, their liver sometimes leaves me with cotton mouth. The okras were good too. They are bite sized version so it&#39;s not a whole okra fried but indivually cut and fried. Overall there food was good in my opinion. 

THE SERVICE:
They can use more people working which is probably why they haver so may order mistakes. They probably need a class in customer service. If they can get that right they will do well in that area.

harolds-chicken-schaumburg-6,Edward M.,ERK8lp1ikLZMF4qkVxlTNA,kaVPVLsfV1Q6CoiLYcWCvg,"Service is super slow. They told me 10 minutes for Catfish and Dark and it took 20. Some people before me were waiting over 35 minutes. The lady also is not very into her job, more like she could care less about serving me.

Catfish and Dark  is 2 pieces of Catfish a Thigh and Drum. The menu makes it seem like you get 1 piece of catfish and 1 piece of dark.  Menu needs clarification.

Price was 11.99 for Catfish and Dark with fries and bread.

Catfish - pretty good crunch to the crust, decently flavorful crust, good fish flavor but fell apart a bit too easily with a fork. You have to eat it with your hands.

Thigh - juicy crunch chicken but flavor is lacking. I prefer the flavor of Popeyes to this but the crunch is a bit better.

Drum - same deal as the thigh.

Fries - think steak fries but smaller, very powdery, not good at all I threw most of them out.

Bread- not sure why the bread is there, it&#39;s kinda just useless. It&#39;s just a slice of white bread.

Mild sauce - it&#39;s not hot, it&#39;s more of a sweet sauce, decent.

Hot sauce - it&#39;s a vinegar based hot sauce, decently hot but not super hot but the vinegar is something that turns me off greatly.",05/03/16,139,2,1,2,-68,1.8524999999999998,1.8279999999999998,0.651,14.520999999999999,No,1182

I got my son the chicken strips meal, it had three chicken fingers and fries for $5. It was an excellent value. The chicken strips were huge and juicy and nicely battered. I&#39;m really glad I tried it for my son. Much better than the Village for a kid because of the freshness and size of the white meat and the  less crunchy batter of the chicken. The fries were just fine, a bit soggy and without any salt. He doesn&#39;t care for fries that much and the chicken filled him up, so in this case it was fine, but I may skip them if I ordered at the store. I also appreciated the excitement the staff had for their chicken and the packaging of my chicken. It was much nicer than the plates everyone else just gives out. Lastly, the chicken does take some time, but I watched it get dropped as I ordered it so it is nice that it&#39;s made to order.

harolds-chicken-schaumburg-6,Alvina C.,4RxTUFwMtAKFVw4AJ4TJZA,Pb-QSebphNDlkwFI6zDtyg,"So first off, when I think Harold&#39;s--service and quickness don&#39;t come to mind.  If you go in knowing that--I think the rest is gravy.  All the food is cooked to order---I&#39;m thinking a bunch of folks have complained and in front of the register there&#39;s now a sign that says expect to wait at least 15 minutes.

Like most, excited to have a Harold&#39;s in my hood.  Called to place my order and the guy taking my order was actually very pleasant.  He told me 25 mins (16 pieces, okra, fries, liver).  I was busy running errands and actually got there 35 mins after---my order wasn&#39;t ready yet, but within 5 minutes everything was packed and I was off.

So mental note--call first and tack on 10-15mins to whatever time they say.  The place is definitely on the small side so looks like more of a take out kind of place as most other locations are, but some seats are available if you want to hangout there a further smell like fried things.  

Liver was excellent, seasoning on not bad either, mild sauce pretty good--a little on the vinegary side.  Okra encapsulated in breading was nothing exciting, fries not that exciting either---but I suppose if you douse in sauce it makes it not so bad.  They&#39;re known for their chicken so really can&#39;t see anything else being that exciting and that&#39;s ok--because there are other places for other food if I want something else.

I&#39;ve been waiting since last summer for this place to open and I had such high hopes. I think the high expectations so early in their business was harsh. Cost isn&#39;t an issue - sure it&#39;s more expensive than the other Harold&#39;s and similar businesses I&#39;ve frequented, but it&#39;s fair. It costs a lot to have a small business in Schaumburg! You gotta make money somehow. Just pretend you&#39;re buying it from Whole Foods so you&#39;re okay spending more than you think. But the quality of the food, in my own opinion and experience, is worth the price. I noticed reviews have pointed out low quality, but no I am not comparing this to Popeyes. It&#39;s much better. I love that the meat falls off the bone from the wings. My Harold&#39;s order has been the same since I met my husband 9 years ago - extra lemon pepper with mild sauce on the side. They did it just the way I&#39;ve always had it.

And the wait time improved! I had told myself to give them time. My first time, I had waited 45 minutes for a 2 piece.

STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!

This place is not the real thing. The service, the food quality and the most important the RECIPE is not the same. It&#39;s basic run-of-the-mill fried chicken place, just double the cost. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a half a notch above a good Popeyes experience except it will run you double and almost triple the price. 

I had the fish combo, tilapia and wings. I didn&#39;t get tilapia and they forgot the wings. What I ended up with was a super salty and fishy catfish meal! Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I grew up on catfish, that&#39;s the only fish my father would fry and it was a special occasion believe it or not, when he was having a good week money-wise he would get is tilapia. I know good catfish and good catfish is something that Harold&#39;s (all the city locations) have proven they can do right, but this suburban imposter is merely that, an imposter with a barely tolerable imitation. 

This is not the real thing folks, this will not give you the real Harold&#39;s experience! It&#39;s like comparing Waukegan to Chicago, yea it can appear to be the same but one cannot truly be compared to the other if you honestly look at the bigger picture.

Anyway. I called and the complained and they said sorry but they couldn&#39;t do anything since

The space inside is nice, but this particular location is currently plagued by what seems like inexperienced management in addition to the usual opening issues that a new place has.

The menu by the register looks like a photograph of a different location&#39;s menu, blown up. Which, while cheap, would be OK if the menu items and prices were accurate. Unfortunately, they&#39;re not. The least they could do would be to update the pricing on the menu - heck, use a sharpie guys!

We ordered some chicken tenders, a mixed 4-piece with mild sauce, an order of fries and some fried okra. The chicken is all served on a handful of fries, on top of a piece of white bread. This does a good job of keeping the chicken crispy, but renders those fries inedible.

All of the food suffered from a lack of seasoning, the fries and okra were a little underdone, and most of the chicken was overcooked and dry. There were a few pieces, however, that were cooked better than the rest and those were delicious. The sauces (hot &amp; mild) are really a must have here, make sure to get one either on the chicken or on the side. The wings with sauce were the best thing on the plate.

Called my order in ahead of time, one 6 piece and one 4 piece. They told me 20 min but when I arrived I waited about another 15 or 20 min. The girl on the reigster wasn&#39;t too bad...just seemed uninterested in her job or the customers. Chicken was ok, not enough sauce, coleslaw was a &#34;NO&#34;, &amp; I&#39;ve had better fries out of the oven.

2nd time I went was HORRIBLE. Called my order in again, this time 18 wings and the girl on the phone asked when I&#39;d like to pick it up - I said 30 min. Now, most people with common sense would politely tell you if your order would take longer due to orders ahead of yours - this didn&#39;t happen. I got there 30 min later and waited in line for almost 10 min with 1 person waiting in line before me (he just walked out).

I gave her my name and told her I was there to pickup my order I called in...this chick just walked away behind a curtain! Ummm hello? Did you not just hear me speak?? 

The place was full of people sitting or standing around with no food but pissed off looks on there faces. One lady who eventually got her order left only to come back 2 min later because her order was wrong. After waiting another 15 min I just left...needless to say no one ever told me anything about my order.

I don&#39;t know what kind of tom foolery is going on up in this place, but the excuse that you just opened is not acceptable. The long wait times for chicken are bad (you&#39;d think I was ordering duck), but the pissy attitudes and unprofessional of your &#34;front of the house staff&#34; is disgusting.

Definitely not the Harold&#39;s I grew up on and know. Been to all of the locations and they are ALL exceedingly above this one. Believe the other negative reviews because they&#39;re true.

I wish I had read the reviews before I patronized this Harold&#39;s. The photos of the food doesnt even look good. I was excited to finally have a Harold&#39;s close to my home so I don&#39;t have to drive to the city. I placed my order online and I thought it was pretty easy and simple. The online site sent me a confirmation stating that my order will be ready in 20 minutes. I got there in thirty minutes and told the cashier that I&#39;m there to pick up my online order. She walked directly to the cooking area without saying anything to me and came back with the cook (im assuming that&#39;s who he was) He was polite and told me that  and they stated that they did not receive the order and that they will have it ready shortly. I did notice that he didn&#39;t say how long but I assumed it will take 15 minutes. I 

When I walked through the door I did notice that there were 7-8 individuals just sitting around. No one was eating something told me not to place my order when the man told me they never received my order. 

I came back 20 minutes later and the same individuals were still waiting. 10 minutes later 2 people canceled there order. One lady was waiting over 35 mins and one man had to get back to work. So he basically missed his lunch hour. 

The food

I order two chicken orders and a small order of gizzards.

The sauce does not taste like Harold&#39;s original sauce it has more of a ketchup flavor. 

The gizzards were fired soft and some of them were not fully coated. The ones that I ate were not seasoned. When I bit into one that did not feel full cooked and eating one gizzard that tasted more like a piece of liver. I was done!!!

The chicken was fried soft so there was barely any crunch to the chicken. The flavor is okay since I don&#39;t like to much seasoning on my food. The fries were barely done.

harolds-chicken-schaumburg-6,Satyam C.,1sKNE1YABjc7aViN0hJI4Q,SSC3QfVWIZY4LUTT6Rbz8A,"Writing this review immediately after eating a 4 piece. I had very high hopes for this place. I have been to three other locations that I can recall. 

This one is located in the same strip mall as Fox and Hound and right next to Richard walkers. Is this place just opened two weeks ago, it was extremely clean on the inside. The first thing that I noticed was that there was no bulletproof glass. If anyone has been to the other locations, you know what I mean. It is a large location with approximately 6 to 7 tables and a barstool area where you can eat. Did I mention how clean this place was?

I began to order my food and decided to go with the four piece so I can try each part of the chicken. I also asked for mild sauce on the half of it and hot sauce on the other half. The mild sauce is not as good as the other Harold&#39;s locations. It is far inferior to uncle Remus as well. The hot sauce on the other hand is great. Get the hot sauce. 

This place is definitely the black sheep of the neighborhood. Located in an upscale area, Harold&#39;s just does not fit it in. However I was super excited to see up there as I have not been to one due to the extreme locations of the others. This was supposed to be my savior. The crowd there is mixed. Black folks white folks yellow folks brown folk. Everything. While waiting for my food I noticed many people asking questions. Unfortunately the staff there is not trained properly yet.

The chicken: 

The breast had no bone in it. This confused me a bit. But I am glad to eat a piece of chicken with no bone in it. Unfortunately this breast was ridiculously dry. It was a struggle to even tear it apart. Not good. Through away 70% of it.

The leg was extremely crispy and flavorful. I generally hate the leg but this was tolerable.

The thigh. Generally my favorite piece of chicken. Unfortunately it was dry chewy and rubbery and lacked flavor. Not happy. I expect my thighs to be juicy.

The wing. This was by far the best piece of chicken. Let this be a lesson. Everyone should just stick with the wings. With hot sauce. That will definitely be my next meal there.

Overall the chicken was lacking something major that the other locations do great with. At each location I&#39;ve been to besides this one, you can see the seasoning in the chicken. On the meat. In the meat. All over. At this particular location i did not see ANY. This was greatly disappointing because I enjoy that thoroughly. Hopefully as time goes on they will figure this out.

The fries and bread were soggy but I do not think they were meant to be eaten.

The menu board price and the price is on the table are drastically different. So is the phone number. There is a sign on a piece of paper that says cash only. Hopefully that will change as well.

Yes. I will go again and give it a chance redeem itself. Perhaps I screwed up by forgetting my Mystic.",17/02/16,310,2,2,3,20,2.5255999999999994,5.933999999999999,5.101999999999999,48.96399999999999,No,2887

We ordered the 24 piece chicken with extra sauce and 8 piece mixed chicken and a side of fries. We called ahead and they told us the food would be ready in about 20-30 minutes but it was longer, probably closer to 45 minutes although there were other people there with about the same size order we had. They had space for dine in but it seemed that most people did carryout. The chicken was light, fell off the bone and flavorful, not greasy like Hooters. We enjoyed the food even though we didn&#39;t have the signature piece of bread with our order. 

My tips are:
Call ahead. You can find the menu online.
Bring cash... It&#39;s a cash only shop although they use an iPad so a simple attachment could change that.

Tried eating there about 3 weeks ago. Went on a Friday night around 8:30 PM. Place was full of customers waiting for their orders. 

I waited for about 15 minutes to place my order but no one seemed to want to fill it. For the most part nobody was working the register. Once a girl came out to take a couple orders ahead of me then disappeared behind a curtain I can only assume to go in the kitchen to help with the food. She came out another time to give a person their order but then quickly disappeared behind the curtain. After 15 minutes of this I left and went to KFC down the street. 

From the Yelp reviews I guess I made the right decision. Who knows when I would have been given my order if I was able to place one as there were about 30 people standing around with receipts in their hands and no food coming out of the kitchen.

I called in a order yesterday after work. I was given a time of twenty minutes for pickup. It takes me about an hour to get to this location from my place of employment. I purposely took a chance and ordered waaaay ahead of time just to see if their response time would be better than a few days ago when we first tried them out. Not only was the order not ready in had to wait an additional 30 minutes for my order. This is ridiculous for a total of eight chicken wings. Even if the order doesn&#39;t drop until you arrive this wait time is ridiculous. There was not a wait when I arrived so I do not understand this wait time.

Actually got in the car and drove here and was still on hold when we got there to find only two people waiting! When we informed the girl that we have been on hold all this time all she could say was that she just got there so it wasn&#39;t her who put us on hold. No I&#39;m sorry or anything. Once we asked to speak to a manager we were told that no one was there and that we can come back tomorrow to talk to someone. Why am I going to take time out of my day to drive back up there to talk to someone? Just give me a name so I can call and talk to someone. I had to tell them I could just call the BBB or she could go back there and find someone for me to talk to. The head cook finally came out to talk to me but no one seemed genuine about their apology. I finally got a name of a manager they said I could call the next day but when I called the next day I was told that the manager was not there and not coming in. Supposedly I spoke with the owner who didn&#39;t seem to know his workers names and when they work!! In the end I was offered a 10% discount on my next order. Does that even cover taxes?!

I called my order in and was told 25 minutes. I came in on time and paid for my order. The cashier did not tell me how long it would be but I figured another 5-10 minutes is not unreasonable.  50 minutes after I called I asked if they can check in on my order. The lady took my ticket back to the kitchen and said it would be another ten minutes. 70 minutes in, a man comes out calling out my number but he had no chicken for me. He just wanted to see if I was still waiting since he knows I&#39;ve been waiting for a while. I told him how long I&#39;ve been waiting and he responded by telling me that my chicken is cooking right now because they just found my ticket. So obviously the lady that checked in on my order lied.  It was another 20 minutes before my order came out, 1 hour and 30 minutes from when I called it in. I was not the only one experiencing this kind of service. The place was crowded and they were obviously overwhelmed but this whole time they kept telling new customers their order would take 20-25 minutes.

Seriously though, this is a great study of capitalism. How much can they raise prices to maximize profit without making their product undesirable and the demand decrease? 

My last carry out visit Saturday tipped my wallet at $26 for 20 garlic wings (2 orders.) If you want celery with your wings, an order costs $2.49. They haven&#39;t included celery with their wings forever but it just stings a little bit more when they continue to raise prices but won&#39;t include 5 sticks of celery.

Here&#39;s what is making me cry &#39;fowl&#39; since I knew all this before picking up my wings. The drummettes were smaller than usual. The flats were much bigger than the drummettes. This resulted in perfectly juicy flats and overcooked, dried out drummettes. Also, they went easy on the coated sauce again, despite mentioning that my previous order was light on sauce and having the bartender verbally ensure that it wouldn&#39;t be a problem this time. Last but not least, I requested blue cheese but received ranch. 

The wings definitely suffer when you carry out since they virtually steam in the styrofoam container in transit. Dine in for the best quality straight from the fryer when they&#39;re freshly tossed with sauce. They win 1st place at Chicago Wingfest almost every year. I&#39;ve been to Chicago Wingfest ten times, Milwaukee Wingfest twice and have to agree. Their Garlic Buffalo Wings are my favorite ever and when they&#39;re fresh, they are FRESH!

They have a buffet in the bar on Friday late afternoon that&#39;s free with two drink minimum. They now bottle their sauce and it costs $5.50/bottle at the restaurant.

Not like we usually go that late but on the days when my boyfriend and I want to hangout but not stay home, this is one of our go to places because it&#39;s a short walk away. 

Gators is a really casual place that sometimes feels borderline dive bar and borderline where you go after school with your friends for wings. There is a bar side and dining side, you do have to be 21 to come in once it gets later, and there is also a patio that has a bunch of seating. I&#39;ll admit, I don&#39;t like the checked plasticky table clothes they have, those always feel dirty to me, but they do seem to clean their tables so it&#39;s just me.

IMPORTANT TO KNOW: there are ALWAYS coupons on their website that can give you some great savings on your bill! Print them out! Drink specials: ask for them! They always have $4 long islands and daily specials (see picture).

gators-wing-shack-grill-and-pizzeria-palatine,Mike M.,W2zno-nXaGa9Y2Au7L8wNA,55Q-Oi2bYazTB-3b1vJ3Kg,"It doesn&#39;t matter that I&#39;ve had Gators wings dozens of times, every time I take that first bite of garlic buffalo wings I&#39;m continually surprised at how damn good it tastes. I first stumbled upon Gators wings at the Chicago Wingfest and immediately knew we had something special right there. How could a wing joint from Palatine beat the best of the best from the city? One word: Garlic! It&#39;s not even a complicated concept at all...take your classic buffalo wing and toss a shit ton of garlic in it and boom you got yourself a winner. They just execute it so well and it&#39;s consistently delicious.

After that first Chicago Wingfest we went to, we definitely had to check out the actual location. 

Ambiance: From the outside Gators looks like just a small neighborhood restaurant/bar off Rand Rd. When you walk in you have a bar on one side and a bunch of tables and booths on the other. The atmosphere is pretty divey, with just plain tables and chairs similiar to what you might set up in your basement for a house party. All that didn&#39;t matter though. The only piece of decor you needed to see are the trophies they take home year after year at the Wingfest. 

Food: It&#39;s all about the wings when I come to Gators. Garlic buffalo is hands down my go to flavor, but I&#39;ve tried most of them over the years. Not only is the sauce fantastic, but these are some of the meatiest wings I&#39;ve ever had. These chickens must be on roids haha. They serve full jumbo wings with the tips, and overall these wings make b-dubs and even Hooter&#39;s wings look tiny. 

They have a bunch of combinations of sauces. There are 3 different base flavors: buffalo, BBQ, and teriyaki.

Then on top of that there are 3 variations of each of these base sauces:

Garlic - Self explanatory. Add garlic to the sauce...but in insane quantities that will make your breath smell glorious. 

Jalapeo - Again, pretty self explanatory. Throw some jalapeos in the sauce to add a little heat.

Mexican - This is the next spice level up from just jalapeo. In addition to jalapeos they throw a bunch of other spicy elements like crushed red pepper. It&#39;s a tasty type of burn. 

My two favorite flavors are easily the garlic buffalo and the Mexican hot BBQ.

The fries are actually pretty legit here too. I would definitely upgrade to the waffle fries and throw some cajun seasoning on it. You won&#39;t regret it. If you order one of the sauced fries like garlic buffalo fries though, be warned that they definitely don&#39;t skimp on the sauce. The fries are drowned in it and even a flavor as amazing as garlic buffalo can get tiring if everything is covered in it. There&#39;s usually plenty of leftover sauce at the bottom of each bowl of wings, so my strategy is just to get regular fries and use the leftover sauce puddles for dipping. 

Random tidbits about Gators:
-They have a killer lunch deal: $7.99 for 10 jumbo wings. It&#39;s 10 min from my work and a dangerously convenient lunch option.
-They have a printable 20% coupon on their website that always comes in handy.
-Sometimes on Friday nights they have this magician walking around to the tables doing different magic tricks. His bit always ends with a creepy clapping monkey.
-They&#39;re not open for lunch on Saturdays. I learned this the hard way.
-On Friday afternoons, they have a free buffet when you buy a drink. They bring out different types of pizza and wings, but people empty out the trays within seconds of it hitting the table. You never really know what type of wing or pizza they&#39;re bringing out at any given time. I&#39;d rather just pay for my wings and not have to deal with the stress of gettin your fill. Not a bad option though if you just wanna chill and you&#39;re not too worried about maxin&#39; out on wings.",06/09/15,419,5,1,5,-43,6.8211,5.1290000000000004,2.059,37.812,No,3820

The wrap was extremely messy, oozing of buffalo sauce. Tears of enjoy from the jalapeo/buffalo combo. This wrap is hottt!!! The side salad, well is salad. It was good but way too many tomatoes compared to greens and the waiter brought me the wrong dressing.. but all forgiven ha, I used the wrong dressing and enjoyed the salad! 

My friend got the terkayi boneless wings, he&#39;s not from the area. He loved the wings. He also skipped the fries and ordered celery. Which is good with the Bleu cheese dressing!

Why do stupid people go to BWW when this place is around?  Seriously, the wings here are large, meaty and delicious.  I think BWW gets their wings from scrawny, baby chickens and that is just icky and sad.

Here,  I like the lemon pepper flavor and garlic.  Their buffalo version is good too and if you are a wing purist, you can get them simply fried.  Their menu is large and varied.  If you don&#39;t feeling like being fat ass, you can get some pretty healthy grilled chicken salads and they have lots of low carb options too.

If you&#39;ve got your fattie going on, they have a bunch of French fries options (garlic, parmesan, cheese, etc.) and some pretty good burgers too.  They also have skirt steak a bunch of different ways that would put any Mexican eatery to shame.  Never had the pizza.

The wings are the best here. They are big wings and they also serve the boneless variety too, but I like them with the bones. I like to work on eating my food. I tried the Teriyaki Jalapeno sauce but it was not spicy at all. The Mexican Hot Buffalo sauce was just a tad spicy too. The Honey Mustard sauce is the same as their salad dressings so it was tasty. 

I wouldn&#39;t recommend the Buffalo Chicken pizza because it was too small about 8 inches and thin so not very filling. My husband shared my lunch as a result.
