Basically everything we&#39;ve had has been really good, and the people are all super helpful and friendly. AND its nice to support a local business owner and not the green machine from Seattle. 

They&#39;re breakfast sandwiches are fantastic and all come on homemade english muffin. She really likes the turkey sausage but the ones w/ onions and and peppers are what I get. The homemade granola bars are also hearty and delicious. The donuts, cinnamon buns, and muffins all look incredible (and huge), but I&#39;ve never had any. Also really wanna try their lunch options.  I always get the house coffee which is tasty, and she&#39;s ordered various smoothies and cappuccinos which all seem to please."the-corner-grind-elburn,Shevon R.,S2xVq_56n25pP0IhjQwMYQ,"Elburn, IL",0,1,0,47,104,oWn6iM54zPLUtbuLuqPXKg,5,21/05/16,"I must confess.  I don&#39;t drink coffee, so I can&#39;t tell you how the coffee is at this coffee house!  I can tell you that they make some delicious scones, muffins, and donuts.  The blackberry and cinnamon scones are my favorite, but flavors change depending on the season.  

The staff is always welcoming and friendly.  Recently, I finally made it there for lunch.  Well, another confession, we were just too late for breakfast.  We are night owls not early birds.  We really went for breakfast, walked in and realized it was after 11AM.  The sandwiches were gigantic and very good.  I don&#39;t remember the name, but it was a chicken salad sandwich with bacon.  I ordered the 6&#34;, but it was much larger than that.  I ate half and took the rest home.   My foodie 11-year-old had a turkey club of some sort.  He polished his off and said it was very good.

I highly recommend stopping in at The Corner Grind.  Great little coffee house in a great little town!"the-corner-grind-elburn,Natasha M.,r8ahSrPFZXCaZrXBy0_sow,"Villa Park, IL",1,1,1,5,39,i87s4PwsIb5WXjQDKnK1YQ,4,22/10/16,So I came here a couple weeks ago after searching for bakery stuff. I have to say they didn&#39;t have a lot on that part but they also sell sandwiches. I got the Italian one and it didn&#39;t disappoint. It&#39;s a good price for good meat and veggies on it and it&#39;s very fresh. They also stuff the bread so it&#39;s very filling. At least for me lol. Also there coffee is very tasty. I&#39;d come here again if we have the time. The only thing is that they close early.the-corner-grind-elburn,Carlie B.,Q9Kic3XeuaUJt6sFr7xI_Q,"Montgomery, IL",1,1,0,35,5,4b40sPFfaPAVeRefozpvIQ,5,14/08/16,"Yum yum YUMMMMM! I&#39;d give more than 5 stars if I could. I&#39;ve tried three different sandwiches, and each one was better than the last. The Boar&#39;s Head meats and cheeses are delicious. Soups are yummy too. It&#39;s a small place, but a nice atmosphere. Excellent food at a fair price - what a concept!

Elburn was smack dab in the middle for us to meet and The Corner Grind was perfect!

They get pretty busy here no matter the time.  I came in around 9am and it was quiet but then the morning rush came in, followed by the lunch crowd. They have a big sandwich selection and one rotating daily soup.  Had a cup of their steak and potato soup ($2.75) and a 12 oz. soy chai tea latte ($ 3.10). Both were amazing.  Service is extremely quick and friendly.  Wifi is password free and worked like a charm.

If you&#39;re a local, don&#39;t forget to ask about their punch card so you can work yourself up to a freebie!"the-corner-grind-elburn,Logan J.,Inp1ShVPiiH4wvtXlP9rrA,"St. Charles, IL",0,1,1,0,8,V4OJCKIpdv_xlcpPc5DzSA,5,25/07/15,"Had to make the trip because of the reviews. For anyone that looks to yelp to find a new place or great food options - you will love this stop!!
We ordered 3 different sandwiches- the 1-3-5, coffee, lemon berry smoothie, an a monkey mocha. And yes, there were three of us . The generous amount of meat and cheese on the sandwich was well worth the 7.50- you could share or save for leftover. 
It was a bit loud inside but when the food is that good you can give them a pass on noise.  
If they only had space for a patio this place would have locals standin in line for the food and sweets. 
Already planning next trip back."the-corner-grind-elburn,Ryan B.,6wP4Bj3mAg4dyA-vV8ZZmw,"Union, IL",0,1,0,0,4,s1sftQ2XdrU1QBMwV5A_eA,5,08/08/16,One of the best sandwiches of my life.

Utterly fabulous coffee, DELICIOUS food, cozy atmosphere, and friendly, relaxed service. I am a big fan of their weekly specials - their Steak and Potato Soup comes to mind, as well as the Southwest Chopped Salad with grilled steak just last week. I&#39;ve tried a variety of their breads/muffins and sandwiches and honestly, all but one have floored me. I could eat here every day.

I must comment on the servers/baristas. They are ALWAYS accommodating and helpful and genuinely seem to enjoy their job. They deserve props for always having a smile on their face.

It also happens to be one of few places I can sit down with my two-year-old for more than twenty minutes because for some reason, she is always relaxed and well-behaved here. Even she knows it&#39;s a great place. :)"the-corner-grind-elburn,J P.,EqZUPK7478mFHKwgcROcdw,"Elburn, IL",0,1,0,6,21,Ofki9QScuxYKrOhW0AuyeQ,5,10/07/16,This place is great!

I frequent the Corner Grind on a near daily basis when I am not on the road working. The people are friendly and put me in a good mood first thing in the morning. On the weekend I love to  treat myself and stop in and get one of their Breakfast Sandwiches.  OK this is where I start to gush. If you have not had the pleasure or opportunity to try one, I feel less than happy for you. These sandwiches are over the top in freshness and quality. If you have the opportunity do yourself a huge favor and try one. Gush, gush, gush, gush, Gush....
 P.S. The one moderate review this  place received was because they don&#39;t serve lunch on Sunday...
So please remember they don&#39;t serve lunch on Sunday, so order the Breakfast sandwich."the-corner-grind-elburn,Caroline M.,CnUzhHxPuJCP_5z2p7gcRg,"Aurora, IL",1,1,1,201,1,e2dzKrUoVPR_PDCJYX7OWQ,5,18/02/15,"Although I don&#39;t really pass through Elburn too often, I have been here a few times with my mom.

The &#34;roast top round&#34; in the beef &amp; cheddar was tough/fatty/scarce.  To make things worse, we were both up all night with upset stomachs!  I suggested that possibly whomever was making the sandwiches, may have not properly washed the lettuce or something...?  After advising me that she herself makes the sandwiches, she basically argued the fact, explaining she had a lettuce washing machine.  After listening to what I consider nothing but excuses, it seemed like she was in total denial &amp; wanted to do nothing but disagree with whatever I had to say.  Although she offered to give us a couple &#34;free&#34; sandwiches to make up for our experience, we&#39;ve decided to never return.  Who argues with a paying customer?!?!?  Good luck!!!

My staple drink is a mocha frappacino, and, because I work as a barista, I am a little particular to how my coffee tastes. Every time I order a mocha frappacino from the Corner Grind, the flavor and consistency is top notch. Just the right combination of coffee and chocolate taste, with a not too icy undertone. Divine!

So I am giving the benefit of the doubt on a few things here. I am giving them 5 stars because I know they just opened up and learning the ropes. Sl

I am here because I absolutely love Italian Subs. I really wanted to test this place out when I saw this place passing it up. 

First - I like how you pick out a bag and check all the things you want on a sandwich. Very clever.

Second - I like how they categorize the menu. So, for example, under  seafood you can get a tuna sandwich, crab salad sandwich, surf and turf sandwich, etc. Clever. Easier to choose your sandwiches.

Third - The Small Grinder is 7 inches. So one  of those is good enough for me. 

Total cost for a small sandwich, chips, and a regular fountain drink was 9.71.

Negatives - Again they just opened so giving them the benefit of the doubt. But they were a bit slow making my sandwich. Maybe it&#39;s because they were heating up my sandwich. Service was still awesome. No I am sure there was a reason for it.

Also no combo meals.&#34; Deals. Sort of odd of a sandwich shop. Never seen that before and I go to many sub shops.

I will definitely come back again to test out the other Italian Sub options here. 

I took a pic of the menu so I hope this helps."which-wich-schaumburg,Jessica D.,58UTbnNah3gGGL5XQ4r49Q,"Streamwood, IL",0,1,0,0,9,OtiPrJfBgxz6P8G6ESvg5A,1,20/10/16,Only giving 1 start because I had to give something.

Employees were nice, it was my first time there and the cashier came out and explained how their ordering went.

You first look at what type of meat you want then find the bag with the meat that you and then you can read and mark what you want on the bag. When you have marked all that you want on a the bag you can bring it to the cashier and they ring you up and you wait a couple minutes for them to make your sandwich for you.

I got 2 sandwiches
The gyro sandwich with classic onions and tomato, was very good it was comparable meat and sauce to a real classic gyro.

The other sandwich i got was a roast beef with pepperjack cheese, honey mustard,regular mayo, crispy strings (fried onions), lettuce, spinich, tomatoes, pickles, house chip (not sure what they were or if they even were in there), mushrooms, oregano,garlic,salt, and pepper.    This one was bigger than the gyro cuase it had way more stuff in it. It also was a great sandwich  and everything tasted fresh.

You order your type of sandwich by first picking out what kind of meat you want, then you can add toppings, make it skinny, pick out your sammy style (bread, bowl, or lettuce), and then you hand the cashier your marked up bag.  

Each employee was super helpful and friendly.  My chicken pesto was really good -- as I said before, everything is really fresh.  I opted to not have my sammy warmed up, so I enjoyed how each bite had a snap to it.  

I cannot wait to be back to try other options!"which-wich-schaumburg,Mike G.,fzAuSEDhTLz4z-lCxC0paQ,"Round Lake, IL",0,1,0,49,7,77do9pusLiX33ahMhe8Egg,3,15/01/16,"This place is good if you want a quick sandwich and you want something slightly better than Jimmy Johns or subway. 

I had the gyro and I can honestly say it wasn&#39;t bad at all! I got the 10&#39; with no chips or drink and still paid 9.50 so I wasn&#39;t too thrilled about that, especially when I could&#39;ve gotten a burger and bottomless fries at red robin (next door) for $10.

There is no combo option, the ridiculously high priced chips and drink come at a hefty cost (almost $4 if you want both) and no discount for getting both as opposed to most other Sandwich places. 

The sandwich was good, I ate it all and was full but it didn&#39;t knock my socks off or make me want to go back in a hurry for more. I think I honestly would be perfectly fine if I never went back (this was my second time)

The sauce on the gyro was pretty good and comparable to actual gyro sauce (the white colored cucumber sauce i don&#39;t know how to spell it) 

Overall if you are into sandwiches this place has a ton of options, is fast and taste pretty good, but for $9 and no chips or drink it seems a bit overpriced."which-wich-schaumburg,Annie H.,thVt1j81wtW3Zwnquz3e_w,"Streamwood, IL",0,1,0,0,17,GLK_BhSXsxWMZilZN87b9g,4,08/04/16,"Great veggie/vegan options and the meat versions of things aren&#39;t bad either and my kiddos love the sandwiches. My only issue with every which wich I&#39;ve ever been in is it takes FOREVER to get your food, even when its dead and everyone there looks like they are in pain as they make your food. Its a fraction of the size of other sandwich chains and yet it takes twice as long to get the food.

Be careful though when you order sauces as I ordered only light mayo and dijon on my sandwich and when I got home and unwrapped my sandwich to eat, it was soggy and oozing with the sauces! I could barely eat it I had to take a napkin and wipe of so much sauce. 

A little on the pricey side. My fiance ordered a large Italian sub and I ordered a medium tuna and the total was around $21.00 not including chips or drinks. 

There was one lady working there and I looked at her name tag her name is Emma. She made being there waiting for our sandwiches super uncomfortable. They close at 9pm and we got there around 8:30pm. When we walked in she was sweeping and seemed like she was extremely unhappy about it and unhappy that we walked in. She was banging the broom around so loudly and shoving the chairs everywhere. As she was sweeping she was talking to another employee about her personal life and everyone in the restaurant could hear it. She would give us a couple glances that did not look friendly. Not very professional.

I could run to the grocery store and buy all the fixings to make sandwiches for a week with twenty bucks. Also, it was not busy at the time, but it seemed like it took them way too long to round up two sandwiches. Putting that aside, I did highly enjoy the food.

This is a I&#39;m looking for authentic Mexican from good souls that treat you like family. Game. Set. Match.

Time of my visit: Dinner

My girlfriend and I were in the mood for some Mexican and wanted to try a new place.  So we chose this one.  I got very excited as they would deliver for free on orders over $10.  We got our order together and called in for delivery, only to be informed that they did not deliver on Sundays....

The delivery order turned into pick up order.  Once, I got to the place, I realized that the place was pretty much pick up, delivery or take out, there were absolutely no table to seat at.  We ordered 2 regular (bigger than junior) burritos, chips and guacamole with rice water.  My total was just under $24.  So I reached out for my AMEX, only to be told that they did not accept it.  Again, this is one of my big pet peeves, either accept them all or be cash only.

I got home and we started eating.  The burrito was not that large.  Unfortunately, as I started eating it, the tortilla started to fall apart.  I must say, I liked the way pork was seasoned and the quality was good as I did not come across any chewy peaces.

The chips bag looked a bit small, but I am sure the volume was compatible to other place.  Guacamole was really fresh and tasted really good!

C-.  I would like to come back, but I am not sure when it&#39;ll be.  I would not mind trying their al pastor tacos."javis-burritos-glen-ellyn,N B.,PeNVdboZUzz_BofyBlE1bw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,4,293,ITKrZfaxu-ZSNydW3tPtmQ,1,30/10/16,"Zero stars if I could....and I didn&#39;t even get a chance to eat what the GE folks have given a hearty 4.5 stars. 

As we walked into Javi&#39;s, we noticed a pile of beef just sitting on the counter in back. No big deal...right?  It&#39;s a dive Mexican joint....the screen door doesn&#39;t even close properly. Awesome....my kind of place.  (Not really....but let&#39;s order some food to try it for ourselves)

We were prepped, looked at the menu online prior and really wanted to get our Mexican grub on!  However, there is a group ordering ahead of us. They start talking to the cashier about Halloween costumes......&#34;what are your costumes?....Are you dressing up?&#34;  (Whatever...no biggie....right?)  The cashier decides to not place their order and to get the next order like any &#34;normal&#34; establishment and then talk to her friends about whatever after....  Nope. Stop the presses!  She proceeds to walk over to the aforementioned pile of meat, reach around the pile of beef and grab her cell phone.  Walking back out....&#34;Here&#39;s our costumes! Yeah....really cute!&#34;  

We walked out.  We had seen and heard enough. 

....to the folks complaining about why their orders are taking so stinking long....I think we cracked the code. 

To those that have actually had food from Javi&#39;s....congrats on the miracle!  Hope you remained healthy too!

To those who think the health department needs to revisit.... we concur. 

Sorry Javi....Your Mexican food doesn&#39;t earn nor deserve any stars or our money in our book.  Way too many quality Mexican establishments in this area. 

As a footnote.... we decided to eat at a different downtown GE establishment.

I came to my bfff Yelp to find a place in the area since I&#39;m unfamiliar. I stumbled across this place and decided to stop in. 

This is strictly a carry out restaurant. They had a few chairs lined up so you could sit and wait if you want. 

It&#39;s a family owned restaurant and they have their son there who&#39;s a little ham! He was adorable. He definitely made the wait more bearable with his crazy antics and entertaining personality.

I ordered 2 carne asada tacos with cilantro and onion. Anddddd elote!!! I love when places sell elote. They didn&#39;t skimp on the steak and it was well seasoned. My only complaint was they went a little too hard on the onion. I was tried to get as much off as I could but was difficult since I had to eat it in my car. The elote was pretty good just wish it had more spice to it. Total $10 and some change.

The steak taco was plain and ordinary.  I also tried the small chimichanga. While it tasted great, it was like an eggroll and much too small for the price. 

The Verde sauce is ok at best. The hot sauce has a bit of heat, but not overwhelming. Also, they provide generous amounts of lime.

So Javis comes into my view and I grab a spot and pull in. I walk in the door and it is a small floor space without tables so its a take out spot. No problem, I order a a pork burrito. I request a cup of red and green sauce  to go with it. I got home and unwrapped it, stood it up and took a bite. The pork is seasoned very well, there is a great flavor with every bite! I pull out the red sauce and put a dab on for the next bite. The consistency of the sauce screams freshly made as its not total liquid, it&#39;s got a bit of body to it and the taste really got my attention. It paired very nicely with the pork! The green was also good but didnt complement the pork as well as it might with a chicken burrito but its still a good sauce!

He couldn&#39;t have been more than two, and yet there he was, chillin&#39; and taking in the sites of downtown Glen Ellyn. Not a sight you often see in these parts, but I kinda like it!

Others have mentioned a &#34;hole in the wall&#34; vibe here, and I definitely got that. Odd paint job, subpar lighting, no tables or counter, just three counter height chairs scattered around. But I could see into the kitchen, and it was clean. The two adults we encountered were friendly and made us feel like they were happy we were there. Also, as I will explain later, the food was good. So I really don&#39;t care about all the other stuff.

Javi&#39;s accepts cash only, but they did mention that they&#39;re working on getting a &#34;credit card machine&#34; (which is not so much a machine these days, as a tiny device that can connect to a smart phone, but who am I to complain?) It was sort of a fun challenge for my husband and I to scrape together enough cash for our meals.

Now, the food...I highly recommend trying the chile relleno. Best I&#39;ve ever had! The quesadilla was nothing to sneeze at either, but it was just overshadowed by that tasty, cheesy pepper. My husband liked his fajita meal as well, though it was served with chicken when he had ordered steak.

The location can&#39;t be beat. I love the walkability of our little downtowns. We&#39;ll be back to try some more, and to see Baby Javi taking in the sights out front.

The couple who run it live in the city and make the treacherous commute each day, sometimes with their toddler son, the infamous &#34;Javi,&#34; in tow. They embody an old school work ethic, and they are always truly grateful for one&#39;s patronage. Their food is made fresh and is excellent. You won&#39;t find better takeout Mexican in the area. And the only sit-down Mexican that is better is A Toda Madre around the corner. But that&#39;s a completely different price point and experience.  Because they operate on a skeleton crew and make everything right there, wait times can be a bit long for takeout. But hey, you can spend the time you&#39;re  waiting thinking of the countless aphorisms in the English language that remind us that good things are worth the wait. Also, because they don&#39;t have a public restroom, they cannot have a seating area.

When you go--and you must!--order a burrito or nachos with steak. You won&#39;t be disappointed. Tacos al pastor...ridiculous. Rice and beans are always fresh, not crusted over from being reheated four times a week. Chile relleno is as good as the greatest pepper in the world smothered with cheese gets. 

So, if you&#39;ve got 15 minutes to wait and you&#39;re ready to be impressed, make little Javi&#39;s parents&#39; day and pay them a visit."javis-burritos-glen-ellyn,Mark K.,pnT7OvcITW_s5KUlyzjKUg,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,1,0,0,3,loN01NLF_JmNZr2TAbdRyw,5,09/06/15,Javi&#39;s inspired me to write my first Yelp review.

I must say, I was impressed with their kindness even though we were walking in at 9:45pm, 15 minutes before closing. There was no attitude at all. I ordered a pastor taco and my husband ordered a steak burrito. Both were delicious and we agreed that the quality was better than Los B&#39;s. My husband said that Los B&#39;s burritos had a little more flavor, though probably from cooking with more fat(lard?).

Lets get down to the food. The tacos are really good. I just wish they would add tacos de lengua, and they didn&#39;t make agua de horchata seasonal!. The burritos are always a favorite in our office. The meat is always well cooked. The taco salads are excellent as well. Their green salsa is sooooooo good!!

All of us had guacamole put on them.

The burritos tortillas were slightly crisped and the meat was well seasoned.  But the flavor of the guacamole made them great!  

There is no sit down seating.  The whole place is a waiting area.  You can see right into the kitchen, which looked clean.  It certainly needs a paint job and some more seating for those who are waiting.  But really, who cares?  You go there to pick up your food.

Incredible. The meat flavorful, the beans seasoned nicely, and a bonus is that you can add extra meat if you want to! I think it&#39;s about comparable with Los, maybe not as large of a burrito as Los in diameter (it may have been the overabundance of beans there versus meat), but the quality and flavor surpasses that aspect. 

What a little town gem. I cannot wait to make my way through the menu.

I was greeted by little Javi as most people have, and he handed me a book to semi-read, he&#39;d come back and want to go through the book when he wasn&#39;t moving around or dancing.

I had the steak and pork taco dinner. The steak taco was good --I could have used a little bit more flavor from the meat, but it was still tasty; the pork was tender, flavorful and topped with a tangy, spicy tomatillo(?) sauce that made things even more delicious. My order included the traditional red/green sauces which both tasted fresh, with just the right amount of spice, and made an excellent counterpart to the steak.

As far as silverware. You don&#39;t need any Bc you use your hands. They offer alcoholic frozen drinks from the bar which my favorite was the mango margarita and you can get a virgin one fir the kids. All of them come in a take home cup.

Pros: 
Fun and entertaining
Friendly, engaging staff
Good food

Cons: 
Crazy expensive

This place is probably not for EVERYONE, but if you&#39;re a nerd at heart, you&#39;ll love it. The staff is very friendly and, though a bit campy, very good at keeping in character. 

The price - oy yikes! Tickets are like $60 normally, but I was lucky to have been invited to go when they&#39;re having their fall sale. They also have a Throwback Thursday sale ($36/ticket). The Royalty upgrade is, in my opinion, definitely worth it. Front row alone was too awesome to pass up, but you also get a commemorative VIP towel!

I&#39;m super cheap - in fact, I&#39;ve gone 32 years without going to this because I was always reluctant to spend so much money. But it was a good time.

The real kicker is all of the &#34;fun&#34; stuff you&#39;ll be tempted to buy. Trinkets, toys, even WEAPONS. And if you want a commemorative glass, you&#39;ll pay quite a penny - most expensive VIRGIN pina colada I&#39;ve ever had ($15) just so I could go home with a pretty purple goblet. 

As far as the food - it&#39;s actually pretty good, if a bit simple. And I was surprised to be full, despite the fact that it wasn&#39;t what one would consider &#34;feast sized.&#34; You get a piece of garlic bread, a bowl of soup (tomato, which was really good), a quarter chicken, piece of corn, half an herb-roasted potato and the pastry of the night (in my case, a delicious piece of lemon pound cake YUM). The wench was witty and pretended everything was dragon parts: dragon scale, dragon blood, baby dragon, dragon horn, dragon egg - tee hee!

I was very impressed with the horsemanship and, of course, the King&#39;s falcon! So neat! 

All in all a good time, though not something I could afford to do on a regular basis."medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Lefai K.,WJOjqOmrM2jJxwrlqHIK9w,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,198,74,1z9rDnq_pXWGPsgecMJCiw,4,07/09/16,"Oh man -- I&#39;ve been wanting to go here since I was a kid... now that I have kids of my own, I can fulfill them and not be that creepy guy alone in the playground! In case you don&#39;t know, Medieval Times is a dinner a show, featuring decent food you eat with your hands (no silverware!) and cool storyline of a king hosting a tournament of knights fighting to the death. The venue itself looks like a Spanish castle and inside, the place is pretty cool. 

The ticket itself says you should be there 90-minutes or so earlier than showtime, but from reading other Yelp reviews and just talking to past peeps, this doesn&#39;t seem necessary. They do have a gigantic &#34;waiting area&#34; which is pretty huge, almost as spacious as the stage/arena and seating area itself where you can spend and waste your time/money before the show starts. PRO-TIP: We did a Sunday early afternoon 1:30PM show, and got to the place at 1:00PM, and the timing was perfect -- we had time to check-in, peruse the displays of swords, weaponry, and stare at horses, and before-ya-know-it, it was time to go into the arena. There were plenty of seats at the Sunday early afternoon show, so if you don&#39;t like crowds or waiting, and an early Sunday afternoon is doable, definitely aim to go to this showtime.

Upon entering, you can take a picture with either the princess or king and right before the show, they will take a picture of you and your party with you wearing your souvenir paper-crowns, at your seat. After the show, they have a green-screen for more photo opportunities. All in which case you will have to fork over some dineros to get a copy of. I forked-over the money for the before the show seated picture.

Before and during the show, there are vendors peddling lighted and flashy swords and all sorts of plastic toys. Be strong and say &#34;no!&#34; ha. For those who forked-over some extra cash, you can sit in the VIP section, which is essentially the front row. We opted for the &#34;first-come, first-seated&#34; seats, and we were seated in the second row, which is perfectly fine. In the VIP section, you also get a flag/banner thingy with your knight&#39;s color, to cheer your designated knight on with. Each seat is pre-populated with banners and towels, regardless if anyone sits at the seat or not. 
PRO-TIP: After the show, there were plenty of banners and towels laying around. Feel free to grab em. The waitstaff don&#39;t mind and they said it was fairgame

The waitstaff who serve you the food is extremely friendly and everyone role-played as if we were in medieval times. The menu included:
- Tomato bisque (dragon blood)
- A baked half-chicken (dragon flesh)
- Half bake potato (dragon ears)
- A slice of garlic bread (dragon eggs)
- Apple turnover (no clever name for this one by the waiter)
- Small quarter corn-on-a-cob (I forgot what he called this)
Note: Past reviews from others, indicate a rib, but there were no such thing here.

Overall, food was good, chicken was moist and not dry, and the apple turnover was pretty good. I would agree with others that the tomato bisque was rather too salty for me. They had lemonade, pepsi, water, and coffee as well to wash this all down. PRO-TIP: If you have to shred or separate the chicken from the bones, which I had to, definitely bring your own plasticware and plenty of napkins. I did, and it was money. Everyone said it was a lot of food, but being a beast like me, I was skeptical. I believe it was just enough. If you have picky kids like me, they will find something to eat -- since there were several different food, the kids were able to find enough to eat. 

BATHROOM REVIEW: Located outside the arena, the mens bathroom was roomy and had enough urinals to keep the waiting line flowing nicely. There were 5 urinals (i believe... I don&#39;t remember) and 4 or 5 stalls. The lines moved quickly. Sit or squat? Squat, my lord."medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Luis S.,b4DDUviG8vFXpu3YK-wsLA,"Addison, IL",0,1,0,6,579,M8R82X_hW2V0-wU_xStMYQ,4,11/11/16,We had a pretty good time here. Food was simple but pretty good with soup chicken potato corn and dessert. They have full bar and really neat artifacts. The show kinda dragged at times but it was still interesting. We used a coupon so it wasn&#39;t that bad. Service was good. However minus one star for them constantly trying to sell you stuff.medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Sherwin C.,AJcwRgdkHtu3kOrEKlXq8A,"Buffalo Grove, IL",1,1,0,389,105,NxYqQGKnLhIhkLkUGMCrEA,5,15/06/16,"Quite possibly one of the most unique places to enjoy an evening of fun. Great deal when you consider the constant deals and coupons that are available for shows.

While the food isn&#39;t Michelin Star worthy -- it is definitely much better than what you&#39;ll find at the majority of entertainment / food combination offerings. Portion sizes are huge, flavors are simple but enjoyable (closer to restaurant than amusement park style food), and the service is extremely friendly. In particular, I have to commend the amazing service I received as my waiter was extremely patient, funny, an excellent listener, and frequently checked up on me to make sure that I was having an amazing experience. From the other sections I could see, it seemed that others were also very happy with their service, especially with how well the servers interacted with the kids.

The show itself is very entertaining and professionally run. Although there&#39;s lots of moving elements, weapons, lights, etc. going on at the same time -- everything was perfectly synchronized. The show included many aspects of tricks with the horses, fights with the knights, some Medieval-themed story, and a falcon show. This is a nice change from the comedy or musical theater shows which are typically the live shows I watch locally.

Overall, if you&#39;re looking for a very unique experience in the suburbs, definitely give Medieval Times a try. It&#39;ll provide a very fun and memorable experience and is a great deal considering that you get a full show, awesome atmosphere,and enough food for leftovers for a reasonable price. Perfect for a birthday party, date, or just a way to treat yourself to a fun experience."medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Salena C.,f0SHitrEqc5k0DwWyPlY9w,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,180,320,ZlHbRRxtRf-ONfVoh8JfQA,4,15/06/16,"We went for a school event with students in kindergarten through 8th grade in the middle of the day. Because we went for lunch, we were offered garlic bread, a huge piece of chicken, corn on the cob, potatoes and cookies. They were extremely sensitive towards food allergies, and had plenty of alternatives; for example, they brought out a lemon icee for a student with peanut allergies instead of offering them cookies and/or nothing. They provided coffee to the adults, and brought out more food for students who were picky about one thing or another. Overall, they were very kind and patient to our many demands. The food wasn&#39;t spectacular, but it was fun to eat with our hands and get messy! 

The show was super entertaining for the kiddos. Everybody wears a crown with the color of the knight they are voting for, and the Knights pass out flowers (that they kiss hahaha) to various members of their fan group. They had multiple choice questions about anti-bullying and kindness, and really got the kiddos engaged in those tougher topics. Fortunately for us, the green knight won and we were on the green team, so our school went wild! We were also able to take pictures with all of the knights, the princess and the King after the show. 

Overall, I&#39;m not sure I would have loved it had it not been a school function. It&#39;s definitely kid-oriented and a fun family affair, but not necessarily something I would do with a group of friends! I would highly recommend it for another school field trip though!"medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Phil S.,462OM7fz4--ztzOg_39sMQ,"Sauganash, Chicago, IL",1,1,1,53,57,yGaYL4uY0a5AxejfGzDIuA,3,04/02/16,"Ehhhh it&#39;s good to see that I&#39;m not the only Yelper on here.  My wife&#39;s niece wanted to go to medieval times so we took her for her birthday back in November.  The show was entertaining, but kinda cheesy.  I was a LORD if only for a few hours.  They recommend that you get there @ 6:30 pm a full hour before they let you into your assigned seats.  I guess they want you to buy stuff that you don&#39;t really need.  There were some pretty cool weapons like swords, shields, armor from different periods.  I am kind of obsessed with this stuff even though I don&#39;t need them

The food they served was pretty mediocre.  I never knew that dragon parts tasted so much like regular food. 

The show was ok, but our Red Knight was the runner up.  Kind of like kissing your sister.  So we went from being Lords &amp; Ladies during the show to being normal schleps afterwards.  Oh well Cie la vie."medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Dave T.,V7o7yy2zxBFQXR2t5pvrRA,"Portage, IN",0,1,0,1,411,0TM910d_vlfPFUN5nFyGgQ,3,02/08/16,"Checked this place out because the girlfriend wanted to go here and got discounted tickets. They let you in before the show so you can buy overpriced items and drinks. The drinks aren&#39;t that bad if you don&#39;t get the &#34;fancy souvenir glass&#34; no craft beer so I settled on a $8 new castle my gf got a double Long Island which he didn&#39;t know how to make so basically just poured a bunch of booze in a couple with ice she was ok with it so whatever I wasn&#39;t drinking it and she said it was good but it was $18

From my understanding the menu hasn&#39;t changed in years. You start off with tomato soup and garlic bread. Followed by a chicken leg quarter, potato and for desert a apple turnover. 

Chicken was good but you need to bring hot sauce if you want it. I was starving so I ate all of it and it was a big portion. The potato was cooked all the way in my opinion so didn&#39;t really eat that. And didn&#39;t care for the apple turnover. 

The show was somewhat entertaining and is really cool for kids. Probably something you could check out every three to five years and look for discounts. Food isn&#39;t band but your basically there for the show anyways!"medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Nina I.,DkYv0GTlLQMEBkE7cmPnvQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,480,419,ppdlBMPOIywnfNlT-xbEGA,3,25/06/16,"Last time I came here I was probably around 11 years old. So most of what I remember was flashing lights, knights in different colors, and some food you eat with your hands. This time around was pretty much the same thing.

My dad had a hankering for this place since he recently became an intense Game of Thrones fan. So we [my sister and I] decided we can make this a fun outing for him for fathers day. 

They had a cute Father&#39;s Day package going on where he gets a free picture, a cape, and a souvenir 24oz beer mug [filled with the good stuff]. That was cute.

The rest of my experience wasn&#39;t so cute. The show seemed cheesy, the food was flavorful but we had no options for meat or sides. The whole place started with very watery tomato soup and garlic bread. Then for the main course we had baby dragon [1/2 bone-in chicken] which, to me, seemed precooked and re-heated for the masses. Main course was accompanied by corn and a &#34;dragon egg&#34; which was just 1/2 baked potato. For dessert we got something resembling a less sweet version of apple pie (forgot the &#34;medieval&#34; name they used for it, sorry). To have the &#34;full experience&#34; you were supposed to eat with your hands. I asked for silverware. 

We sat in the section for the yellow knight. We lost the third or fourth round. Very cheesy loss. He got &#34;stabbed&#34;. My dad was very into it... but it was Father&#39;s Day so that was the point right? 

Something to note here for my fellow booze lovers: the wench who brings you food doesn&#39;t serve you alchohol so you have to keep your eyes peeled for one or two other people who walk around and take orders. They do have some cool themed drinks. My favorite was &#34;Maidens Kiss&#34; which was a fruity vodka based drink that had some strawberrry and other fruity falvors mixed in.

Overall I would recommend this place mostly to younger people who have some free time on their hands and want to try something new. My dad had fun but people ages 18-35 who don&#39;t have kids might not think agree. Maybe when it opened 20+ years ago the idea was more polished but, ironially, the idea might be a little outdated or appeals to a more specific crowd.

P.S. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of all the tricks, kicks, and prancing they have their horses do.. I don&#39;t agree with animals being used for entertainmenet."medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Nichole M.,G3wDvvYAbICXm2VORleVvw,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,127,33,bju3kZjtVyOBudJT-NOUkw,4,17/01/16,"A lot of fun but soooo expensive. Went for my birthday, I like to do random things.  Anyway, the price per ticket on the website can be reduced with certain codes and coupons, you just have to seek them out but then they hit you will all sort of taxes and fees. It&#39;s pretty abhorrent. 

Anyway, once we got there, it was a lot of fun.  It&#39;s super corny and some of the jousting acting is not spot on, but this is not Broadway, after all. It&#39;s just a good time, if you let yourself get into it. Buy a flag, root for your knight and ignore any lame people that are inspecting for perfection instead of fun. 

The food was surprisingly good for how much they are putting out all at once. You get to eat with your hands and drink expensive dragon&#39;s blood.

They have a concept and commit to it 100%. The venue is a giant friggin castle complete with a dungeon amd horse stable. Im always surprised to find that they actually have decent food. Our meal consisted of half chicken, tomato soup, corn, garlic bread, and an apple turnover. The portions used to be bigger back in the day, but they are still plenty filling. You eat with your hands, and that never gets old.

The show is a tacky jousting tournament, but because they give you teams to cheer for, you always feel engaged. You can never get too old to buy a $2 flag and wave that bad boy with abandon while your hero wields his lance. Sadly for us, our green knight was an early elimination.

The family (wife, 9 yr old boy and 3 yr old girl) had a blast and even got personally thanked by our knight for our enthusiastic support which only added to the appreciation they had for the evening&#39;s entertainment.

All the folks already discuss the meals and options on here, so to the staff who read these, THANK YOU for your amazing and wonderful customer service and truly a unique and fun experience.  To you yelpers who are on the fence about going, GO! If for nothing else than the experience (unless of course you hate the medieval time period and people playing knights &amp; princesses).

The performers really get into character and do a fantastic job getting the audience involved.  The food there was also very good and the portions are huge.

Also, the prices can be a bit high at the door so look for a good deal online and order in advance if possible.

I like the concept of a dinner show and thought it would be a unique experience for all of us since neither one of us have ever gone to Medival times.

So I&#39;ve heard this place can get pricey. Had I not had the groupon, it would have set me back 69.95 per person. With the groupon, general admission is $40 pp but it can easily become $60 pp with the additional &#34;add-ons.&#34; Are you celebrating a special occasion? Well there&#39;s a package for that and you get a cake, an announcement scroll and special mention during the show for an additional $16. Okay fine. I&#39;m cool with that. Do you want to sit closer to the main ring? Well that will cost you an additional $20.00 pp for VIP seating... Pictures with the king or princess cost $20 for one professional photo and $30 for 2. Waving banners cost between $2-5. If you have kids they&#39;re going to want whatever light up flashy thing they are going to sell them and those are at least $20+ each. Beer in a goblet? Not sure how much that was but my husband said it was overpriced. If you had to reserve money to spend here, at least tip your servers. I&#39;ve heard a range of 2-6 dollars per person.

The service is excellent and the food as other Yelpers had mentioned is amazing. You get a starter course of dragon blood (tomato soup) along with some good garlic bread. Then it&#39;s off to the mains. With the mains, you are given a generous portion of roast chicken (the call it roast dragon, which by the way was absolutely succulent and delicious!) As soon as I ripped through &#34;the dragon&#34; with  my hands, roasted chicken juice gushed out of the chicken meat. Yum! There was so much chicken left over that I took half of it home with me! With your meal you also get a corn on the cob with a roasted potato. Omg was that potato seasoned to perfection! I wished they gave you a second helping. It was just sooo good. Complements to their chef for a wonderful meal. 

The show was excellent and was roughly two hours in length. It wasn&#39;t just jousting. There was a storyline and competitive sport between the Knights of your choosing. I won&#39;t give all of the show away for fear of spoiling it but the sword fights were cool and as the swords clash and bang against each other you may even get to see some sparks fly! 

This my friends was worth the money along with the great show by the performers. If you can resist purchasing the add ons, it&#39;s definitely worth the trip. At least do it once! I would come back again but couldn&#39;t afford frequent visits as again this place can set you back. Parking is included in the price and the lot is behind the castle."medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Bryan A.,mRj01KDqXwHuqMxu-bec4g,"Bloomingdale, IL",1,1,1,40,130,un2aviwQT1_pbddrY_Cc4w,3,02/02/16,"Went here for the first time, for a friend&#39;s birthday party this Saturday.  It was very crowded, as was expected.  The dinner consisted of; your choice of Coke, water, or ice tea, with alcoholic drinks available for an additional charge, tomato soup with garlic bread, chicken (which was too dry), corn on the cob, a baked potato, an apple turnover, and coffee.  The bar was very crowded before the show, and ordering just a single drink took very long.  For vegans, there is an alternative meal.  Not sure what it is, although I do know you get utensils.
     The show was entertaining.  The games were not overly difficult or impressive, but they do a great job of getting each section involved in cheering for their knight.  The final duels were good, a bit repetitive, but it seemed as though the performers got progressively better.
     The main drawback here was the price.  Over $70 per person for a sub par dinner and one drink each just can&#39;t be made up for by an hour and a half &#34;show.&#34;  It wasn&#39;t terrible, and it was relatively fun, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d recommend it.  BTW, I did see somebody&#39;s vomit on the toilet while using the restroom.

Thursday night was the perfect time to go. It wasn&#39;t crowded, lots of kids at the show -- great for parents who are worried their kids won&#39;t sit still. You could hear the actual dialog 100 times better. The whole night had a calm feel to it!

Let loose.  Get lost in your surroundings here at Medieval Times.  This is neither the time nor place to take yourself seriously.

Once you&#39;ve opened up, the experience here can be fantastic.  Get there early and get close parking as well as the opportunity to explore a little bit.  You can see the horses up close (but behind bars/windows).  Grab a slushie drink (about $8 for alcoholic version).  Visit the museum/dungeon where they have medieval torture devices ($2).  Or maybe just do a little shopping for capes, robes, swords, and other miscellaneous &#34;Medieval&#34; souvenirs.

A little presentation and next you&#39;re ushered into the arena by your knight&#39;s color.  The show itself is pretty impressive.  Lots of horse-riding, jousting, fighting, and a slightly cheesy backstory to go with it.  All in good fun.  Make sure to cheer for and wave to your knight and you might just get a flower.

Some tips, go during an off-peak night and you&#39;ll be able to sit closer (as well as increase your likelihood of getting a flower).

The hotline employees were super helpful and I was able to reserve 10 discounted spots for our friends. We were running late so we kind of missed some of the beginning stuff but it doesn&#39;t seem like we missed much of pre-show activities. It appears that they just try to sell you photos and apparel and souvenirs before the show. Silly me brought this elaborate castle shaped cake I had handcrafted. The Medieval Times employees tried to offer to serve it to us during the dessert course but I refused because I wanted to show it off to my friends and do the traditional candles and song routine beforehand. After being ushered to our seats, we noticed that food service felt a lot like a wedding. There&#39;s one person for drinks, another person for soup, another for the &#34;baby dragon&#34;, another for the dessert, and another for the booze orders and a different person who actually brings you drinks! It was all very confusing especially when it came time to figure out who to tip. When our server announced himself halfway through the meal, I was surprised that they even mess with the formality of having a &#34;server&#34;. The show happened in darkness so on occasion I would spill food or drink on myself. Break out the bibs! As for the show itself, it was incredible! It was like if a Renaissance Faire had professional wrestling! The stunts were at times cheesy, but that didn&#39;t detract one bit from their impressiveness! In the end, I wasn&#39;t able to serve my cake in the dark chaos. Not that if I was given a chance it would have been an ideal setting for a birthday celebration. Everyone&#39;s seat is facing the stage and we were seated all in one row. Some people were able to get their special event announced. Not sure how they did that! We probably missed something at the beginning. After the show, the lights come on and everyone goes to the lobby to take photos and they try to sell you more souvenirs.

Overall this place is amazing. Definitely take advantage of online discounts. My two main criticisms are that it lacks &#34;hangout vibes&#34; and that the food they serve is completely historically inaccurate. Tomatoes, corn, and potatoes are all new world foods!

My fiance and I decided to go here randomly for a date night. A coworker had said she recently went and it was awful and cheesy but we stuck with our plans. The food was pretty good, nothing gourmet, but not bad at all. 

As for the actual show, of course it&#39;s over the top and exaggerated. If you&#39;re expecting anything other than that, well I don&#39;t have any words for you. It was a fun time that provided a night of entertainment. I would definitely come back to take my nephews or even recommend as a fun date night idea for others.

The doors to the seating area open at 7:10 but they say you can get there at 6:15 when you make your reservation.

They have some things to look at and buy before you&#39;re seated but it&#39;s not enough to keep you busy for the whole (almost) hour wait. If I could do it over, I&#39;d probably get there around 6:50. I went on a weekday. 
Once you&#39;re seated, you&#39;re greeted by a wench or man wench and they bring you something to drink and throughout the show, they bring you food. No complaints about the food!

The show itself is entertaining.  You are placed in a section with a color which represents your Knight.  You cheer for your knight as he competes in medieval games including jousting, sword fighting, and catching rings with his lance.  

I brought my 70 year old parents and my 4 and 8 year old children.  All had a wonderful time.  

The food is quite tasty.  You will get messy, there is no silverware, but nothing outrageous. 

My oldest was knighted before the show started.  For a little extra cash, I believe it was $30, he got his name called by the king to come up in front of everyone and knee down and be knighted.  This came with a picture with the king and a toy sword.  For even more money you can upgrade your sword, for adults.  

I would not pay extra for the medieval torture device tour.  It was not really worth it.  

On a side note, my father is wheelchair bound.  They took care of us immediately.  We were allowed to enter the arena first and select where to sit.

First you arrive and they crown you with a colored crown that will match with your seating area and which knight you will be rooting for. You then walk in and they have all these booths/stations setup for either drinks, souvenirs, photos, swords, etc. 

They do not open the doors to the arena till a certain time and once they do, someone will be there to escort you to your seats. With our royalty tickets we bought from Groupon, we scored front row seats! It was so perfect! I was surprised to see that they had such roomy and comfortable seats and in front of you is your table for eating. Along with the Royalty tickets you get a printed program and a behind the scenes DVD. The show was so much fun and it was so school to see everyone in character and the crowd going crazy over their knight!

Upon arriving to the castle is was pretty cool I enjoyed the theme! Before we entered the arena we opted to get drinks as they do have a full service bar. When we entered the arena it was soooo cool (I can&#39;t believe how easily impressed I am LOL) the horses were beautiful, the acting wasn&#39;t bad, and my team (#TEAMGREEN) won (whoohooo!).

Doors open 75 minutes before your event, and we got there right when the doors open, which we later realized was a good call as it got us and our friends really good seats. 

The staff has your check-in down to a science, and after three or four checkpoints, we were in the main hall. There are lots of little shops there that are more geared toward kids, but adults will still find fun things to look at. You can also check out the horses which are over by the dungeon. We didn&#39;t tour the dungeon, but there&#39;s a $2 tour fee. 

Entry to the pavilion was surprisingly organized given the sheer volume of people. We got in and got to our table pretty quickly, and then the show began! It was amazing and incredibly engaging. I worried it&#39;d border on the cheesy, but it didn&#39;t. It felt as authentic as anything can feel when you&#39;re wearing a paper crown.

For what you pay for, it doesn&#39;t seem worth it unless you get a deal (which they have plenty of). For about $74, you get ONE piece of what is obviously Texas Toast, a healthy sized portion of deliciously seasoned chicken, one little corn on the cob and some ok tomato soup. I thought we were suppose to get a spare rib based off the previous reviews but I guess not. I wished they could have at least given us two pieces of toast or a longer ear of corn, but whatever. Other than the chicken, they are kinda meager with their portions, even the slice of birthday cake was tiny.. 

The theater part was ok. It took them forever to get to the fighting part and when they did, our sorry ____ knight lost. After an hour, I was pretty much like the horses.....OVER IT. 

I don&#39;t like the fact you still gotta tip the servers (I was prepared to do so nonetheless) after paying that high ____admission price. For what I spent, there are better places to celebrate a birthday. I don&#39;t know what I was expecting but it wasn&#39;t the experience I had."medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Areen P.,WhKrpIcc27RDhiV1FmFqDg,"Howell, NJ",0,1,0,7,112,GVJtUlU5HYXlDaOQHPAuzQ,5,03/09/15,"A blast from the past! Truly an amazing experience. Im a medieval junkie myself so this stuff clicked with me. I love the costumes and i marvelled with the show and performances. The theatrics and all were outstanding! I love the horse shows and im so amazed with the trained falcon. I love the combat and all, fantastico! They even sport this accent to be in character. Expect to get wowed if you are into these medieval stuff. 

My husband surprised me with this on our 1st Anniversay. And boy oh boy, im glad he did! We had the Royalty package and comes with it is a photo opt where you can wear costumes and select your preferred background and they give you the photo afterwards in a medieval themed frame, you get a DVD and a booklet with infos about medieval times, and you get front row seats which is i think the best seat to be at. 

The food was okay but they were tasty and portioned well. You get a medieval bread (garlic bread) with blood soup (tomato soup), baby dragon  (a big chunk of chicken) for the entree with baked potatoes on the side, and a medieval dessert (apple crisp or pie i think hehe). A friend tipped my hubby to bring utensils just in case but we were not aboe to use them. Besides the food were pretty much hand-able food. They definitely encourage you to use your hands as spoon(right hand) and fork (left hand). 

Over-all i absolutely enjoyed the whole medieval experience. Kids will love this place. I remember the father and son sitting next to us had made a funny remark; when the entree was served i heard the kid blurted out to his dad with so much excitemen: &#34;Dad, i got the dragon&#39;s foot!&#34; We all laughed but it was such a cute and funny moment.

The acting was really good, and the staff was really friendly.  From start to finish it felt like we were in the show.  They do a really good job at getting people involved and ready for whats to come before you head into the theater.  

My friends and I all commented on how good the food actually was.  The portions were large and the chicken as well as everything else was cooked to perfection.

I would recommend this place to anyone with kids. The dinner and entertainment surpassed my expectations.  The &#34;Feast&#34; is a hands-on food experience, no utensils provided, you get a half of roasted chicken, a half of potato, a corn on the cob, a bowl of soup and an apple turnover over the course of the show. I was very satisfied with the food and how it was prepared.

The &#34;Knights of the Round&#34; Tournament was a great show for kids and adults alike. Much of the show was a display of horsemanship, but there was plenty of  swordplay and jousting. The crowd got noisy and rowdy as the night went on and hey, I did my fair share of cheering. Plenty of kids were having a great time waving their flags and enjoying the sparks fly as the knights fought to the death. 

In the lobby outside of the arena there is a gift shop with plenty of knick-knacks to buy. I really bought in to the ambiance Medieval Time tries to set. With tapestries hanging on the walls and painted coats of arms through out the lobby you really do feel like you are inside a castle. There is a bar in the lobby as well with the usual suspects of beer and wine on purchase.  Don&#39;t get carried away with buying stuff because purchases of everything in the lobby are pricey so focus on taking in the entertainment and food.

Be sure to arrive at least an hour before show time to take advantage of the waiting room which has a horse stable, different knight statues, two full bars, and a costume photo area. Also a king and his chancellor will put on a little floor show. It&#39;s a bit confusing how it all works so it helps to get in early and ask questions on how it all works. The VIP package includes a group photo in front of a green screen (you choose background) but costumes are $3 extra. I was a bit annoyed at that. 

The kids actually liked the food (so did the adults!). The tomato soup was decent, but the real winner was a really well roasted and seasoned quarter chicken. You also get a quarter cob and half a seasoned baked potato. An apple turnover for dessert. The VIP package includes a slice of birthday cake.

The show was great - the Chancellor was awesome!  We were in the Blue Knight&#39;s section and had a ball.  There was a little seating confusion when we first got into the hall, but it was quickly resolved.

The food was fantastic and served by a very pleasant wench (she said it was OK to use that word there, just not at home to my wife).

The sales of blinking lighted and glow in the dark crap for the kids was a little annoying, but not so much that it took away from the show.

The kids portions are the same as the adults even though you pay less for kids. My daughter who is 4 had a great time. Our blue knight was great and interacted with her. He even made her his queen of the tournament, which was cute! Our only complaint would be the pricing of the alcohol drink and the tickets to the museum. The tickets to the museum were $2/person, which doesn&#39;t seem like much, but the museum took maybe 2 mins and there wasn&#39;t anything interesting for kids.

As part of my conference taking place in Schaumburg/Chicago, we were provided transportation to/from Medieval Times and an entire show/dinner for ourselves, with the added bonus of the grand finale theme being a duel against our rival organization. The evening before, a handful of the knights and the king&#39;s right-hand man attended the first dance at our hotel and showcased a [well-choreographed] sword fight as a precursor to the evening ahead.
There was quite a buzz while we waited to be ushered into the stadium since we would be seated with our respective provinces. I would suggest not going into the Torture Museum since the explanations are fairly... graphic. 
The evening officially kicked off with the king&#39;s spokesman announcing our Grand President and his wife dressed in Medieval attire on the small stage in the waiting area- what a way to set the mood! As we&#39;re ushered in, the servants and wenches take your tickets, direct you to your area [my seat was thankfully first row], and quickly take any drink orders since they are part of the show initially. 
The show is pretty cool - the performers are great athletes, and the horses are amazing. At times it&#39;s a bit cheesy, but expected. I was elated when our Black &amp; Yellow Knight advanced far into the tournament and threw me a flower; saddened though when he was killed by the eventual winner. The games and activities flow right into one another as does the meal - started out with dragon&#39;s blood, then a HUGE piece of dragon[chicken], 2 veggies and a pastry for dessert.

My 3 year old daughter dressed as a princess and the reaction from staff and other diners had a smile on her face before we even took our seats.

Souvenirs are overpriced as are adult beverages, but come on, this is the equivalent of going to a Cubs game. My major gripe was only being allowed to buy one alcoholic beverage at a time when lines are long and a beer is 8 bucks.  

The staff was fantastic. Our &#39;wench&#39; was fantastic and engaged my daughter. We bought a light up wand and later during the show a guy selling something entirely different said it needed new batteries and took it and brought it back. It was much brighter! What a thoughtful thing to do.

The food is good. I remarked to my family that I have attended a dozen weddings where the chicken isn&#39;t half as moist as this. I expected a child&#39;s serving for my 3 year old and she was given the same portion as us. I thought I would eat what she didn&#39;t, but the portions were so large we brought home enough to feed her another meal which was a pleasant surprise.

All in all, look for deals to defray ticket prices. Treat it like any sports/theme park for the extras.

Occasionally somebody will walk by selling overpriced swords and flags that the kids might enjoy.  

FOOD:  I was surprised at how good the food was.  Garlic bread to start, tomato soup, roasted chicken aka Dragon&#39;s Wing, mashed potatoes, Bbq ribs, and for dessert: a delicious peach strudel!

There&#39;s a bar outside the arena, but you can also order alcohol from your server.

There are plenty of bathrooms too which I appreciated - just don&#39;t go at the end of the show or you can expect to wait for a very long time.

Some things never change.  And sometimes that&#39;s a good thing, because they were always cool from day one.  Point in case: Medieval Times.

Everyone knows what&#39;s in store for them when they buy tickets to this nationwide dinner theater chain.  Lots of fanfare, actors wearing costumes and talking in pseudo-old English accents, jousting, sword fights, utensil-less food, and wenches serving ale.  I hadn&#39;t been to a MT in over a decade, but I was glad to see that not much had changed.

The exterior facade is huge and built to look like a castle (obviously), and the inside is vast, consisting of the main arena and pre-show staging area, where you can spend outrageous amounts of money on tacky souvenirs.  Okay, not all of them are tacky and expensive--like the awesome stainless steel goblet I bought for only $10--but is buying a light up sword for $35 really worth your kid&#39;s happiness?  Can&#39;t answer, not a dad.....yet.

All of the actors stayed in character and did a commendable job rousing the crowd.  As a thespian myself, I can appreciate the effort the king &amp; company put into their performances.  However, several of the knights seemed bored, and a couple looked downright unhappy.  The green knight was far and away the best, always smiling and nodding to our section when his horse trotted past.  Thankfully, he was the dude we got to cheer on!

The food was satisfactory.  A little on the anemic side, perhaps, but tasty enough.  Good garlic bread, TINY portion of soup, bland roasted potato wedges, tasty BBQ ribs, and a decent turkey/chicken leg (whatever, meat-on-a-stick).  The flaky pasty dessert--basically an apple turnover--was a nice way to cap off things.  Service was fine, but I had to laugh when the waitress/wench offered us more &#34;Medieval Pepsi&#34; or something equally silly (they couldn&#39;t just call it &#39;Cola of the Castle&#39;?)  Booze prices were pretty inflated, so I passed.

The highlights were jousting and sword fights among the knights.  While there were a couple instances where the knights fell/jumped off their horses (to simulate getting &#39;knocked off&#39; by the joust) and it looked phony, the majority of stage combat was actually very good.  When they clashed swords, sparks literally flew!  I also loved to see the knights using flails and shields as weapons.

Here&#39;s the TL;DR version--I had fun.  Yeah, it&#39;s pretty gimmicky and not particularly cheap, but it&#39;s just as enjoyable as I remember it as a wee lad.  I would happily return.

In fact the lack of authenticity may be what gives the experience it&#39;s charm.

Go for the show, the food is a convenient addition to the show price, and sit back and prepare to cheer at the jousting and sword battles and ooh and awe like a little kid at the gorgeously trained horses.

Meanwhile, you can giggle at: 
- Some of the HORRID fake accents (excluding the main guy and the king who thankfully don&#39;t sound like a freshman drama class)
- Being called My Lord / My Lady by people who voluntarily call themselves your wench
- Repeatedly adjusting your ridiculous paper crown
- Eating (with your hands) a meal composed of 25% ingredients available in medieval times / 75% not available until well after America was discovered (namely: potatoes, corn, tomatoes and garlic)

The horse and knights are definitely worth checking out!!!"medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Thomas B.,siuQZO0039A5rrNCPMYEdA,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,0,4,18,7XG3KltDquoF1RgXOAfiTw,5,20/06/15,"I&#39;ve been to medieval times many times.  Enjoyed it since I was young.  Rather than going to a restaurant and just eating, here you get to eat well and see a cool show!  I&#39;ve been rather lucky my knight has won like 75% of the times I&#39;ve attended!  The food is great, like seriously!  Last time I attended there wasn&#39;t a rib, in the past there was always and I enjoyed that.  But the &#39;normal&#39; meal I&#39;ve had here is garlic bread, tomato soup, potato, chicken, &amp; rib (or something else now), and also a desert which is usually an apple pie type thing.  Plan to eat with your hands, because you don&#39;t get silverware!  I enjoy this, some people may not, but they do give you towels at the end of the meal also.  Overall, it&#39;s just a fun place to visit every now and then.  5 stars because I have had 0 problems and nothing to complain about.

 Some things to know:
1. Drinks are expensive.  Kind of like at a movie theater, the prices are very high for drinks, so plan on that, or plan on not drinking a lot.
2. There are deals!  Never pay full price for your tickets!  Check online and find a coupon code!
3. For children &amp; families the earlier show times are best.  The later show times are best for a few buddies and drinking and yelling!
4. Don&#39;t bother paying extra for &#39;priority front row seating&#39;.  I actually prefer sitting a couple rows back, and there are no bad seats in this place, all the seats are pretty much equal!"medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Alexandra M.,XjR0DEoszn5n0U8CdWMPzg,"River Grove, IL",0,1,1,14,104,sXQN2nU4WTvi0XFykAdVkw,5,11/03/15,"We took my mother there for her birthday this weekend,  our waiter Chris was great.

Chris was very efficient and prompt with any additional request that we had.

I got my ticket off of Groupon, so I only paid for dinner and tip for approximately $40 (which I hear is a much better deal than others had to pay).  I don&#39;t think I would have paid if it was more than $50.

The food was pretty decent.  I did not care for the tomato soup, but everything else was good.  I was worried about the fact that there was no utensils, but they gave out hand wipes.  Thank goodness!  I was filled with what was given to me.  I had garlic bread toast, soup, half a chicken (it seemed that big!), half of a potato, and some apple pastry.  

I enjoyed the show.  The knights fought, did some tournament things, etc etc.  I know the kids really enjoyed it, the ones next to us was really getting into it (they were SUPER upset that our team&#39;s knight lost... then they started to cheer for the bad guy.  My goodness).  I personally was worried that someone or one of the horses was going to get hurt, but nothing went wrong during the show.  I&#39;m sure they have veterinary medical staff available for the animals, since they have so many horses.  

Overall a great experience for children. I wish women were able to be the knight though, that would have been great!"medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Jennifer W.,tWVlSt-66fl6bk9_5UzltQ,"Cleveland, OH",1,1,1,156,138,e9DhTLLGgFaevHaTz_YmDA,4,20/09/14,"So much fun! 

I can&#39;t give it 5 stars because of the nagging feeling I have that the horses are subjected to abject cruelty...if not in the form of daily beatings, then at least by being forced to endure the canned earnestness of their ponytailed passengers, and their dramatic soliloquies and overall grandiosity. 

I bring this up because I swear that, during the evil knight&#39;s speech about his king destroying this kingdom, etc., his horse rolled his eyes like a million times.

The food was actually really tasty!

I will say, don&#39;t go frequently, the routine pretty much stays the same (I think it changes every 5 years or so), but it really is entertaining. Beautiful horses, men in tight pants, a stubborn falcon, finger food, the royal party, and all the things you can buy. 
    They say arrive early for various reasons (lines, getting seated, wanting you to buy stuff before the show, some routines done in the lobby, pictures), and upon arrival they do give the option to upgrade tickets. There are various levels of tickets, the basic package all the way to the several hundred dollar meet-the-king-get-knighted-fancy-cup-blah-blah-blah package. Check Groupon and elsewhere, you can often find some deals.
    The food is pretty good: some toasted bread, tomato bisque, a good portion of chicken, a sparerib, a potato, pepsi or ice tea, coffee, an apple turnover thing, and there is also a vegetarian option. Hopefully I didn&#39;t forget anything... it&#39;s eaten with your hands, btw, so don&#39;t look for utensils (hakuna matata, they give you wet naps). Our server was very nice, don&#39;t be a cheapskate with your tip, remember, they have to run around that arena with tubs of food for a whole row, they are probably paid like a server, which means not a lot so they rely on those tips.
    The show is fun. They have the different events and the horses really are beautiful. Have fun cheering for your team! They don&#39;t force you to participate but seriously, you&#39;re at Medieval Times, you&#39;ve already lost some cool points showing up so lose a few more. The falcon was neat, as well. He was stubborn for awhile and wouldn&#39;t come down from his perch, I of course was on his side. The announcer for the evening was fantastic, love his voice, perfect for the role. 
    If you want an interesting insight on Medieval Times, Google the Reddit thread of Q&#39;s and A&#39;s by an old employee, it&#39;s pretty neat!

I gotta say the whole experience takes on a whole new vibe when tiny people are involved &amp; no liquor is present. My nieces had an awesome time and the experience was well worth it - but it&#39;s a one time thing. You won&#39;t catch me taking the little ones back there and the main reason is how things add up.

The wait to get in was very confusing &amp; pretty horrendous. I wasn&#39;t sure what line I was supposed to be in so we picked a random line. It was a mighty long wait to get in. We arrived at the recommended time of 630pm for the 730pm show &amp; ended up waiting about 30 minutes in various lines until we got into the actual castle&#39;s main hall. We had pre-printed our tickets so we bypassed a huge lineup of humans waiting to buy.

After we got inside, my nieces asked me, so what do we do now!? haha Poor little girls don&#39;t understand all the waiting involved at the castle. The whole thing reminded me of waiting at Disney World except if you&#39;re a good planner, you can get away with no waiting at Disney. Sadly at Medieval Times, there&#39;s no avoiding all the crazy lines &amp; waiting around. 

We went up to the gift area and looked over their offerings. I&#39;m the cool, fun Aunt so was planning on letting them each get a light up, flashy thing. One girl picked a sound making light up wand &amp; the other picked the sword that lit up in three places. Fancy! $38 fancy. Also, for all purchases at Medieval Times you have to show your ID (apparently a new policy) and I didn&#39;t have mine on me. Thankfully I had a couple of 20 spots so I could fork over the cash. So...

Pro-Tip: Bring Cash for souvenirs and tips. It just makes life easier here.

The show itself was quite entertaining, well most of it. We sat in the Black &amp; White section at the very end and the little ones complained about not being able to see well. They couldn&#39;t see the King &amp; Princess at all and had a hard time seeing all the action. The beginning of the show was a bit confusing to them but they loved seeing the horses though all I could think about was how I hope they are treated well when not performing. The main actor/narrator guy is absolutely the star of the show and so fantastic! Great accent, on point facial expressions, he really gets into it and just is perfect in the role. The real action of the show comes in when the protective net comes down and the knights start battling. On guard!!! 

My nieces loved the show save for some complaints about viewing things. They also said a lot of the loud noises during the battle got a little scary (huge spiked balls banging against shields &amp; a man snapping a whip, in particular). So if you have children scared of fireworks and things of that nature, this may not be the show for them.

Our waitress was very attentive and my nieces loved being called &#39;lady&#39; and &#39;princess&#39;. I caught her making a few little side comments which made me laugh and were more adult intended. I went with the vegetarian option for dinner which included a starter of hummus, pita bread, celery &amp; carrots - pretty standard fare but the pita bread was warm and delicious. The main course had changed since the last time I went - a stew served in a metal pot of rice, veggies and what seemed to be beans, with a little packet of hot sauce on the side. It was a decent meal but any time the word &#39;decent&#39; is used to describe something, it means it left something to be desired. After seeing my nieces&#39; plates full of chicken, BBQ, potatoes and tomato soup, I will definitely be getting the normal meat eaters&#39; meal on my next visit. The pastry was served hot &amp; flaky with a warm apple center. I quite liked it and found it to be completely sufficient for dessert.

While having dessert, they came around to show us our picture we took with the Princess when we entered the castle. It was just SO cute, I couldn&#39;t resist forking the money over for it. $20 for 1 or $30 for 2. They must just bank on these expensive photos. I paid the $20 so my nieces could have a nice little memory of the three of us there and they appreciated it.

Tipping is the most confusing thing at Medieval Times. Yes, you need to tip. How much is the question? 20% of the tix price would be ridic. I paid $20 not knowing what was right. I&#39;ve read people tip nothing to $2-$6 pp so in the future I will stick with just $5 or 6 pp. It&#39;s also a bit awkward outright telling your server how much tip you are giving them if you charge it.

So is Medieval Times fun? Heck yes it is!
But do they try to gouge every last cent from their guests? Heck yes they do.
$20 for the photo, $38 for a sword &amp; a scepter, $20 tip and the tickets themselves cost $115, with a coupon code mind you.
Of course if you were to get drinks or anything else, that would just add more to the costs. 

$193 for 2 hours of fun makes it a once every 5 years type of activity!"medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Danny W.,IU86PZPgTDCFwJEuAg2j7g,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,5000,105,PMfm_3owy1lw28A1d41poQ,4,31/05/13,"Food: 5 
I hate when trendy restaurants are too cool for condiments, but I definitely get it after eating here. Their menu is not huge, but when you do what they do as well as they do it you don&#39;t really need to offer much of a variety. Slow roasted and succulent, they have the type of dragon leg that you can just tell the chef de cuisine puts his heart and soul into each and every night. Sides include a perfectly seasoned potato, phenomenal garlic bread, and corn on the cob that literally melts in your mouth. (once you get it off the cob) Culinarily my dining companions and I were more than pleased with this foodie haven.

Service:3
Unfortunately they lose 2 stars here. :-( Our server was very pleasant and seemed to know the menu like the back of his hand, but sadly was somewhat hard to flag down. He did have quite a few other tables though so i guess its understandable when a popular place gets as busy as they were on our visit.

Ambiance:2 
Retro. Very retro. Seriously, the 1800s called and they want their everything back. Not really sure where they were going with this decor, but if the scents coming from the kitchen weren&#39;t as tantalizing as they were I may have lost my appetite.

Overall: 3 1/2
I&#39;d definitely come back. Even though there are a few aspects I&#39;m not totally thrilled about the place is great for groups and you know it&#39;s authentic cause absolutely every staff member spoke with an accent."medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Magdalena D.,OLJlfvr0hUs5C8ftmaSV9w,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,189,3,BmYBLmsK_lQVCT7rFiU7SA,4,07/04/15,"I hadn&#39;t been to Medieval Times since 6th grade ( over 15 years ago) &amp; I remember having such an awesome time with my classmates. Years passed and I&#39;ve always wanted to go back. I wondered if it would still be as fun as I remembered &amp; if the food was any good. I would go on the Medieval Times website from time to time and check out the prices and feel a strong sense of nostalgia as I would browse the photos yelp.  The prices seemed ridiculously high to me ($228.96 for two adults and 2 children ages 5 &amp; 7) so I never felt it was worth it. Then it happened. Easter 2015 was two days away and I had no plans. We usually have Easter celebrations at our home with egg hunts, basket swapping and lots of food ,drinks and family. This year I wanted to avoid the whole cooking, cleaning and being the host &amp; wanted to do something just my hubby, kids &amp; I. So I Googled Medieval Times coupons and tried the first one I saw which was buy one ticket get one free! It went through and my total was $149 for 4 tickets on Easter Sunday. I was so excited and thrilled that I was going to share this experience with my kids but silently  hoped that after 15 years the show hadn&#39;t gotten shitty. So Eater morning the boys have no idea that they are going to the castle. After they found their baskets and had breakfast we all got showered and ready. Every time the boys asked where we were going, we repeatedly told them we were going to  &#34;have a jousting-ly good time.&#34; They were pretty annoyed. Then they seen the castle and they were like &#34; MOM! DAD! Look a castle!!&#34; My husband and I exchanged smiles  as we pulled in the parking lot and the boys realized this IS where we were going. We bought our tickets online so we passed the line of people who didn&#39;t and walked right into the waiting area. As mentioned in all the other reviews there are a lot of souvenirs you can buy along with booze. My husband &amp; each asked the bartender what the strongest drink was and she said the Royal Knight which was very good and we got to keep the souvenir cup it came in. $14 for the first round and then refills are $8. We bought the kids each a light up sword for $24 each (ouch) and the yellow flag to cheer on our yellow knight was $2. We arrived about 45 minutes early and the wait for the show to start did not even feel that long. I suggest coming as early as possible if you want decent seats. Once seated at our table our &#34;wench&#34; came along and offered drinks and talked a little about the food we were to be served. Her service was just OK. A different wench that&#39;s exclusively for alcohol came along and asked if we wanted to order another cocktail. We  asked her the same question we asked the bartender when we first arrived, &#34; what is your strongest drink&#34;? She stated the long island was the strongest and best so we ordered it. Big mistake do not order it! It tasted like a cup of lemonade, way too much sweet and sour! My husband even left his seat during the show to exchange our drinks for the royal knight drink and we stuck with that the remainder of the night. There was a lot of food and my husband was surprised that it was actually very good. They no longer serve the rib and now serve buttered corn in its place. While I thought the show itself could have been better, I was pretty content with how happy my kids were, how good the food was and my cocktail lol.

I&#39;m an adult and I have only ever come here with adults, and I still have a good time. The trip into the dungeon is worth it - it&#39;s like $2 or something. And as long as you can restrain yourself from buying tons of souvenirs, the price is good overall. The only time I ever paid full ticket price was part of a birthday package. But, please, don&#39;t ever pay the full price for tickets. You can buy them discounted everywhere- Groupon, Craigslist, all over. 
The food is alright, and one thing I have to really commend this place for is their ability to accomodate food allergies. One of my friends can&#39;t eat at most restaurants because they cook everything on the same stoves, cross-contaminate utensils and countertops, etc. My friend can actually eat here without getting sick, which is probably why he keeps having parties here. You can also get vegetarian (not sure about vegan) options. 
If you have a couple drinks at the bar before the show, you&#39;ll probably leave feeling pretty full and satisfied. The extra cake and virgin daiquiri you get in the birthday package is almost too much.

I&#39;ve been going to Medieval Times for nearly twenty years, and have always had a great time as both a kid and as an adult. 

If you wait for a promotion (which happens pretty often), the experience is pretty reasonably priced. Last year my wife and I took advantage of the Valentines Day deal, which gave us each a glass of wine, a framed photo, dungeon tour, and a bunch of knick-knacks for $99, in addition to the full meal and show. Just keep checking their website and Facebook, and you&#39;ll eventually come across a great deal. 

The castle itself is well decorated and fun to explore. The staff is all dressed up and in character. Everyone who works there has been pleasant and helpful in my experience. 

The food is surprisingly excellent! I&#39;m a vegetarian, and was quite happy with my hummus/veggie plate and 5-bean stew. I remember the chicken being tasty as well, during my meat eating days. Our waiters have always been friendly, quick and accommodating. 

The tournament itself is pretty spectacular. The actors are obviously very well trained, and put on an impressive performance of horsemanship and stage combat. A different house wins each time, and I always find myself grinning and laughing as I cheer on my favorite knight as he battles &#34;to the death&#34;.

It was beyond stupid from there it only got worse. Bad food horrible show the Knights looked like 98lb girls was embarrassing. I&#39;m ashamed I was even there.

To be honest, it was kind of crappy:

Pros:
- The whole place seemed fairly well-run.  It was clean, things started on time, and servers were courteous and professional.

- Having read the reviews I expected that the food would be awful.  It really wasn&#39;t.  The chicken was actually pretty good and the portions were certainly ample.  The Texas Toast, though, was worse than the frozen stuff I can get in the supermarket and the hilarious single rib was fatty and bland.

Cons:
- The show was nothing to write home about.  Over the course of nearly two hours, I didn&#39;t see a single thing that made me say, &#34;Wow!  How&#39;d he do that?&#34;  I would say that the knights are competent at best.  They can ride horses.  They can do some reasonably passable choreographed sword fighting.  But they don&#39;t really do any stunts and I don&#39;t see how they could with the size of the arena.  

Maybe the falconry exhibition would have been cool if the falcon hadn&#39;t decided to perch up in the ceiling for a minute or two while the king awkwardly ad-libbed.  Actually, that was kind of funny.

- As everyone has mentioned, the tips should be included in the price of admission.  The way they&#39;re doing it now is obnoxious.

- I&#39;m pretty sure they threw in a completely random and unexplained $8 &#34;processing fee&#34; when I reserved the tickets on their website.  

- Drinks were weak (although not quite as ridiculously expensive as I expected).  

- There is absolutely no reason to show up anywhere close to an hour early.  We walked in five minutes before the start time and we were fine.

Miscellaneous
- There&#39;s one thing I don&#39;t really get about this operation.  As far as I can tell, this show is really aimed at a seven or eight year-old.  But then it really gets quite violent at the very end, which is sort of jarring. They also don&#39;t seem to have a kid&#39;s meal option.  What little kid needs half a chicken, a rib, a bowl of soup, bread, and dessert?  It&#39;s really kind of weird."medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Jenny V.,idEP0cgB_tNaVrFS040qzw,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,169,5,aSEvVKP0q-YvuWcZRVCVlg,4,06/02/14,"Sadly enough, i live 15 minutes away from medieval times and last week was my first time EVER going (keep in mind that i&#39;m 23)
My boyfriend found a groupon, so we went and we werent expecting the food to be great because his dad kinda put in our heads that it wasnt anything special.
On the contrary, the food was good! better than what we were expecting, on the plus side, YOU EAT WITH YOUR HANDS, awesome.

What i liked
- eat with your hands duh
-you get to keep the cups you get with your alcoholic drinks.
-horses are awesome
-all the knights have long hair
- everyone speaks like they&#39;re from Asgard (Thor, come on people)

What I didnt like
-Sitting front row, squished between people. the lady next to me spilled her beer on me :-(

overall, its really cool, definitely something you should experience especially since there aren&#39;t that many medieval times in the country.
A good thing to bring your kids to!"medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Anna Rachel A.,NE_r2PQPiu9OWiug2glB9w,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,1,0,1,118,pi_p_wPLz_UlxpSepQN_0Q,5,19/05/16,"I enjoy coming here every few years.

Dost thou knowest the time?  &#34;MEDIEVAL TIMES: DINNER AND TOURNAMENT&#34; time! Let us go tither!

I was following my social media &amp; saw the venue had awesome Medieval Times, &#34;Joust for the Cause&#34; t-shirts. I have been through full surgery twice in April to remove a breast mass, so I emailed the &#34;contact us&#34; via website about where to buy/get a t-shirt being a huge supporter of October as Breast Cancer Awareness month. I certainly &#34;Go Pink&#34; &amp; support &#34;Fight for the Cure&#34; everything the very best I can. I was emailed back saying, they would love to ship me a T-Shirt free of charge &amp; to please confirm my mailing address. (I must have been on file from multiple prior visits over the years or for being signed up on their email lists.) A couple weeks had passed &amp; I was still waiting at months end. I replied to the email if they ever shipped 1 since it didn&#39;t make it to me yet, but if available or lost in mail I was still interested. I was kindly replied to that they were sorry for the delay (They were sorry? It is my pleasure to have received your gift, kindness, and modesty in that way!) but were trying to find me a size small &amp; weren&#39;t having much luck nearing month end (my guess would be contacting the sales coordinators at the other castles). This was beyond thoughtful effort &amp; my gift arrival was exceedingly generous beyond expectations. This is all a gift, so any good person shall be grateful for ANY size shirt delivery at any time. I was THRILLED that my email led to a package on my doorstep, the when opened included: A t-shirt, a pink Medieval Times goblet of fantastic quality - metal, durable, the splendid ones you see on the Castle&#39;s bar for sale &amp; the most heart touching part was an envelope enclosed w/ a letter. The unfolded letter read, &#34;Our Kingdom is in need of a Fearless Warrior &amp; Survivor Just like YOU! Enclosed you will find two free tickets redeemable at the Chicago Castle.&#34; The envelope had a post it stuck to it reading, &#34;Hi Amanda! Feel free to call me directly @ ###-#### to book your reservation. -Nereide Crisologo; Sales Coordinator.&#34; WOW. Talk about a company, sales coordinator, or INDIVIDUAL person going above &amp; beyond. I am tremendously thankful for everything, including people like you. The company is blessed to have you on their staff, &amp; customers are hugely lucky. I am happy just crossing paths w/ people like you! Godspeed!

I called to book my tickets &amp; chose the cheapest day I have seen all year: Black Friday. $30 for ALL seats. We were granted the best seats I could ever imagine, front row of the mid blue section. I had a friend from Germany (working on an internship for his PhD in USA for 3 months) visiting &amp; wanted to show him OUR castle. Germany has real castles, but we have the BEST castles with the whole set-up that makes the entire evening at Medieval Times so grand. We pulled in the free parking lot and he giggled &amp; said, &#34;That&#39;s a castle? That is very cute!&#34; Follow-up after visit, he was DELIGHTED by everything inside; Staff, Museum, Bar, Feast, Knights, Real Horses, Attire, &amp; SHOW! Neddy &amp; Medieval Times - I cannot thank you enough in words. You have been a Godsend through a very long tough year. What you have done for me, &amp; the friend I was able to share it with, was nothing less than amazing. I have always loved Medieval Times, but now will forever be a loyal fan of your business from the bottom of my heart. To reach out like that to one person is remarkable. In life, we can&#39;t do everything, but we can do something. I have reached for a hand, &amp; you reached back to my HEART. Godspeed to you! Neddy: Thanks-thou art most kind my fair lady!

The castle is most beauteous. Arrive early &amp; see the Medieval Torture Museum. It&#39;s a small walk through that is painfully fascinating! The bar makes excellent drinks &amp; even the normal cups are plastic holographic keepsakes. Mayhap I will fetch the ale. Yay, methinks so! I had 2 pina coladas He had 2 beers.

Dinner is served 1 item at a time during the show. The Feast: Garlic Bread, Tomato Bisque Soup, Oven-Roasted Chicken (Dragon Leg per the Royal King), Spare Rib, Herb-Basted Potato, Pastry, Coffee. Beverages included (unlimited refills) are: Pepsi, Diet, Iced Tea, Lemonade. A vegetarian feast is available &amp; I hear they are served silverware. Silverware? Nay, methinks not during this era! Methinks thine art cheaters!

Ye cheer for a knight of thy color section through the games followed by mounted &amp; ground combat. The noble knights ride out like strapping Lords atop majestic horses. Our blue knight was grand! Ye art quite handsome. I have been admiring thee. Ye did well in the games &amp; combat. HUZZAH! Tis most splendid! After the show, you can meet your knight for a photo. I asked if I could sit on his lap or chair edge. He said, &#34;Certainly.&#34; Greetings, Blue Knight! How fare thee? Perchance we shall meet again. Fare thee well, My Lord!

Medieval Times- Cheers for an &#34;out-of-the-ballpark&#34; evening &amp; spectacular customer service!"medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Tim F.,mau8tYueFtgiOaMO7GWuyw,"Texas Township, MI",1,1,1,18,345,ITsClGat-70XcMj_lLmdHA,4,19/08/14,"The kids loved Medieval Times.  The food was slightly above average, the kids loved having the opportunity to eat with their hands and not get yelled at by mom and dad.  The entertainment is very good, although very clearly choreographed and staged.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think the performers do put a lot of effort into it and I think the choreography is how they keep it safe for them, I just think they could do a little better job not making it so obvious.

Now the price was pretty high and they do seize every opportunity to extract more money out of you (drinks, souvenirs, upgrades, etc.)

I think the key is to show up pretty early to get a good seat.  If you&#39;re going on a weeknight it appears there aren&#39;t a ton of people visiting so you can get very good seats without paying for the upgrade packages.

It was one of those great experiences for the kids. I expect it was a once in a lifetime experiences and probably not something will be coming back to any time in the future, but that&#39;s purely from the standpoint of once you&#39;ve seen the show you&#39;ve really seen it all.

Highly recommended for a reasonably good meal, a very good show and overall a highly entertaining evening!"medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Pari P.,6VKK6L4BP4rQqKYZSkL1eg,"Schaumburg, IL",1,1,1,37,245,f09FnZbOR0Z36q2tsoqD7g,5,19/03/13,"If Chuck E. Cheeses and Game of Thrones had a baby, it would be Medieval Times. Special note, Medieval Times is not a good idea for those with equinophobia (fear of horses).

After all of these years and a recession, it&#39;s amazing that Medieval Times is still in business. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed myself. For starters, they had beer and not just your typical Miller products but Newcastle Brown Ale. $6 for a 16 ounce beer - not bad when you&#39;re used to downtown prices. The price doesn&#39;t bother you as much after being called &#34;m&#39;lord&#34; from the bartenders. 

All of the knights had long flowing manes with facial hair - I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were previous Metallica cover band members. The entertainment was a medieval version of WWE style action and choreography. Just like professional wrestling, you think it&#39;s stupid in the beginning until you get sucked in and can&#39;t help but cheer along. The actors did a great job of keeping in character. In particular, the announcer had an excellent Old English accent - definitely better than Tyrion Lannister&#39;s. But like Game of Thrones, there was a lot of dialogue and I didn&#39;t understand the plot but kept watching anyways. 

There is something about Medieval Times that brings out the child in you. Maybe it&#39;s something about girls and horses and boys and swords. For horse lovers, the horses are definitely an attraction since you&#39;ll see horse choreography at its best - expect plenty of galloping and prancing. For the boys, you&#39;ll see plenty of clashing of weapons from maces, long swords, to battle axes. If you want to add to your collection or take a special souvenir home, you can even buy real swords. You can get a claymore or a rapier to add your chainmail set. Purchase $200 worth of value, you&#39;ll get 50% off a shield - perfect for the LARPer in your family. 

For the overall value, we got a deal for buy one get one free so it ended up being $35 a person. Not bad when you think about it in terms of a two hour show with dinner. Otherwise, I would not recommend going for the full price of $59.95 for adults. It&#39;s equivalent to watching a movie and going out to eat for dinner but for the whole family.

In the end, Medieval Times is really for the children. For parents, here is a breakdown of why Medieval Times is great for your child&#39;s next party:

1. Children are well behaved and seated which makes large groups easy to manage
2. There are horses and plenty of them
3. Two hours of entertainment that also comes with a full meal
4. Your children will become the coolest kids in school afterwards"medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Alvina C.,4RxTUFwMtAKFVw4AJ4TJZA,"Downers Grove, IL",1,1,1,287,3,nyh842aYhaljUfUzceG6dw,5,02/01/14,"Ok so the prospect of talking in a strange medieval dialect while bravehearting my food (hands only) didn&#39;t strike me as being an awesome evening.  

Man was I wrong!!!!

This was our first visit, went for hubbies bday and it was one of the coldest nights this winter---thought we were going to be the only people there--but luckily some other cray cray people wanted to come out for an evening of entertainment---and lovely liquid libations to warm them up.

It is a little on the pricey side if you pay full price but they were running a promo where all tix were $35, kiddies $29--tolerable---they are great at upselling a variety of packages.  Actually I would say they&#39;re pretty good at the upselling game.  The show started at 7:30 but they encourage you to be there at 6:30---so you can be bombarded by all the randomness from the wine bar, main bar, glitter tattoos, things that light up/glow, torture museum---I give them props---they&#39;re just trying to get that paper! We opted for the &#34;Royal&#34; upgrade $10 more--includes VIP seating, program, banner to waive, behind the scenes DVD.

In terms of the drinks at the bar--thought I was going to pay and arm and a leg, but the prices were actually pretty decent and about the same as going to any other restaurant bar.  Lots of yummy concoctions in fanciful cups.  Kiddies had their non alcoholic slushies in the knight head cups--and they were happy.  Food was actually a lot better than I expected it to be--bonus!--not the best since its food for the masses--but could have been a whole lot worse.

The upgrade was totally worth it for us---we actually got upgraded to the front row----so my group was giddy, tipsy, and feeling good with a touch of brute excitement.  Luckily we were seated in the area of the winning knight so we had a blast cheering him on.  The show actually had a nice variety and it wasn&#39;t just a bunch of jousting dudes with long hair on pretty horses.

Staff was attentive and all were really nice.  My youngest was given a &#34;token&#34; (sash that said queen of the tournament) from the winning knight....so she was excited.  We did a lot of screaming, yelling, eating, and drinking!  It was a great knight!!!

My background:
I grew up with a great family who were Mexican from Texas, so I have had many great meals growing up of having fresh food. I have also dined at the best places in Acapulco and can appreciate a freshly prepared meal.

My experience here:
I walked in at 3pm and it was empty. Just one other customer before me. I sat at the counter and watched tv. I ordered a stuffed steak burrito that had it rolled in with rice, avocado, fresh onion, and cilantro. I also ordered 3 chicken  tacos with beans and rice. 

Order total came to $18.50. I ordered the larger burrito at $8.50, there is a smaller one for $4.25.

I am pleased the burrito had fresh ingredients great fresh lively cilantro, REAL AVOCADO and fresh rice. A Good amount of  steak.

 Emily&#39;s is across the street from the Jewel by Stearns ( strip mall next door where UPS store is). It was worth the tiny extra drive from Downtown Bartlett.
 
Will go again for freshly prepped food.  Its casual where you can eat there if you grab one of the 4 booths or a place at the counter. Otherwise, don&#39;t cook tonight and enjoy take out.

PS: I enjoyed the real re fried beans and rice

Mexican Restaurant Comparison:

Before this restaurant came along; Bartlett , Streamwood, and Roselle and yes, even Schaumburg have had pretty much dog food for Mexican Restaurants over the past 14 years that I have been around trying places.
I had settled for Chipotle for awhile until I learned about their GMO reporting. Most places over- salt meats or use Adobo seasonings containing MSG which can give you wicked headaches and is a toxic additive anyway. Some places use rice from a can. This restaurant had fresh prep food so its a good alternative."emilys-mexican-grill-bartlett,Robert G.,5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA,"Carol Stream, IL",1,1,1,150,14,S-JqtK7fZvjTi-dFCs5E5Q,4,14/04/14,"I&#39;ve had four good tostadas here, which is more than enough for me to recommend it to anyone looking for some good Mexican food in Bartlett.

I&#39;ve had tostadas with steak, chicken and al pastor. They&#39;re, more or less, open-faced tacos. Except instead of sandwich bread, you have a crispy corn tortilla as the base.

The veggies are good and all, but you&#39;re here for the meats. It doesn&#39;t matter what kind of meat you get, it&#39;s well seasoned. They also give you some free green salsa on the side (not habanero, surprisingly, just something a bit sour.)

Best of all, the tostadas are only $2 and change each, and two is enough to assuage even the most intense lunch craving. I even threw in some yellow rice on the side, which was nicely seasoned as well.

For less than $6 for lunch, it&#39;s hard to find a better place than Emily&#39;s."emilys-mexican-grill-bartlett,Noe S.,ttN0r4fBEd0C7kj0hso7OA,"Stone Park, IL",0,1,0,4,6,pE3HLyIrNtO75HpkZ3XnXg,5,07/10/15,This place was great.

I learned that Emily&#39;s Mexican Grill was open for business and five hours later, I was here for dinner. 

The hubby and I wandered over to the shopping center across the street from Jewel and noticed a few people milling about inside. We walked in and quickly decided on our carryout order. 

So this restaurant has been open for about a month. It is family owned and operated (my favorite!). A couple of cousins and the mom/aunt are hustling to run this fresh operation. The grand opening complete with free tacos al pastor is scheduled for the first week of November. I don&#39;t know an exact date, but it&#39;s worth a visit to find out before then. 

Anyhow, there is seating for about 12 people although they are definitely doing mostly carryout. The whole look is bare bones right now, but it&#39;s clean, the kitchen is wide open and they are totally focused on the food. 

Let&#39;s talk about the food. Shall we?

We ordered a steak burrito without cilantro, chicken quesadillas (not on the menu for our son), a side of rice, a side of refried beans, a chicken taco, a steak taco and a ground beef taco (all tacos with onion and lettuce). Dinner for three for under $20!  Heck to the yeah!!  So the good and the not-so-good...the burrito arrived with cilantro. The hubby wasn&#39;t thrilled but still enjoyed the meal. Quality steak that was very filling.  The chicken quesadillas were perfect. Beautifully cooked chicken breast showed up in both the quesadilla and the taco. Order the steak or the chicken...or both!  The rice was nice. The beans arrived with melted cheese and that addition was a surprise. The tacos were delicious even though they arrived with cilantro and onions rather than lettuce and onions. The tortillas were pliable and clearly fresh. We watched the auntie/mom slice the fresh beef off a roast before she grilled it.  You can&#39;t get any better than that!  The ground beef taco was kinda boring, but the steak and the chicken made up for that. The wait time was a little lengthy and they knew it. They&#39;re still finding their groove, so they apologized, but we were totally okay with waiting for a fresh cooked dinner. Plus, the Bears game was being recorded on the DVR so we weren&#39;t missing anything!  

To recap, try the chicken or steak. Call ahead to cut down on your wait time. And support this local, non-chain business!  It&#39;s nice to have somewhere different to go that is five minutes from home.

The biggest thing it has going for it is everything is made fresh, so it tastes fresh.  Because of that, you&#39;re paying a bit more and getting a bit less....not the &#34;burrito as big as your head&#34; you&#39;d get at a late night place.  You&#39;re also getting something that tastes a lot better though.  I&#39;d say the prices are about in line with say, Chipotle, if it helps.  They just updated their menu and added some new things as well so if you like Mexican food you&#39;ll definitely find something you like. I really like their steak offerings.
Don&#39;t be fooled though....this is not &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican food.  It is however, authentic American Mexican food, which is what most people really mean when they say that.  And its good.

Called in a phone order for a steak taco dinner with cilantro, onion lettuce and cheese., chips and salsa, quac and chips and two chicken quesadillas. Was told the cheese was .25 extra, no prob. Told to come in 15 minutes.  I show up 15 minutes later and see the food sitting on the table all bagged up.  The male employee is just starting to fill some sauces in cups and looking around kind  of like a lost puppy opening cabinets, fridges etc.  A dine in customer get there food served to them by the young male. (as I stand and wait).  I repeated the order just to make sure he had it all. he agreed it was all in the bag.  WRONG  Get home, open food.  Guess what, tacos have no cheese or lettuce.  I called the store just to mention they forgot the cheese etc, he immediately tells me they did put cheese, then he says they didn&#39;t and to check my receipt he doesn&#39;t THINK he charged me.  Ok whatever obviously this kid will be working a register forever with his personality.  I hang up, take a bite of the taco...STEAK IS COLD.  Call back and asked why it is cold.  He tells me it cant be cold.  They made it today and the steak is always hot.  So not fresh.  I open the guac, out of the 4oz cup they give you about 2oz for $4.  The chips were store bought milagro brand as I watched them fill the bags. 

The guy on the phone tells me to microwave it and if I don&#39;t like it call the manager.  Ok is the manager there, no.  When will he be in?  I don&#39;t know, whats the managers name? Jesus.  
I asked him if they always have this type of attitude. he said I don&#39;t know.  Well they obviously don&#39;t know much.   

What I got today was horrible. Hopefully my $20 will help them pay the attorney fees, to break the lease within the next few months at 968 S Bartlett Rd since there is no way they are going to make it.  So anyone looking to buy some new restaurant equipment, maybe you should leave your number with &#34;The Manager&#34; because I don&#39;t see them needing it much longer.

It was very fresh and tasted like very high quality ingredients. 
I&#39;m rating Emily&#39;s 5 stars for what it is to me - an excellent take out place in Bartlett for Mexican food. There are a couple of sit down tables but I am not comparing Emily&#39;s to the Mexican sit down restaurants in Bartlett.
It fills for me a Mexican lunch niche perfectly. I&#39;d been going to another place in Bartlett on 59 for take out for years but I recently got a very sharp 1-inch chicken bone in a burrito.

The Outpost has slowly transformed from a hillbilly dive bar to a hybrid hillbilly/trendy dive bar.  The Cambridge Lakes and Highland Woods developments brought in a lot of city folk who love to drink beer at the Outpost.  They&#39;ve kinda taken over as the primary clientele of the bar, essentially pushing the area hill rods out.  You&#39;ll see a guy in a flannel and work boots from time to time, but he&#39;s like Waldo immersed in a crowd of women with coach purses and guys wearing deck shoes and polo shirts with popped collars talking about how much they love &#34;country&#34; life. (Holy run on... Sorry!)

Haven&#39;t had much experience with the food, but I will say the barkeep pours a mean Jack and Coke. It&#39;s so strong it burns your nose hairs clear off.  

It&#39;s always super sketchy pulling out of that place - I&#39;m always worried that I will become the hood ornament of a 1991 Mack gravel truck.

I had surgery on the Wednesday prior and have been learning how to move around on crutches for the past 3 days.  My mother and I were looking forward to a delicious dinner, but the village was hosting an art show and had closed the roads leading to the restaurant.  As such I had to slowly hobble down 2 blocks from where we parked.  It&#39;s amazing what you take for granted as normally this distance would have been a trifle, but crutches really slow you down.

After our wonderful dinner we were trying to strategize the easiest way for my mother to get the car and pick me up as she is visiting from out of town and is not familiar with the area.  The General Manager, Stash, saw us trying to find an easy way to the car and offered to show us a shortcut.  Not only did he lead us to a back way out, but he showed me a place to sit while he walked my mother to my car and then drove with her to where I was waiting.  Stash lastly helped me place my crutches in the car and would not accept the tip my mother was trying to give him.

I cannot thank Stash enough for everything he did for my mother and me.

Two dishes I&#39;d like to highlight on my most recent trip here, the calamari fritti and quattro stagioni pizza. The calamari batter is so light and the portion is HUGE - definitely not complaining ;). The pizza on the other hand has everything you can ask for - prosciutto, artichoke, mushroom, olive, egg. There&#39;s an over easy egg right in the middle of the pizza and the waiter will come sprinkle that yolk just. right. over. everywhere. Love It.

You can definitely get a sense of family when you come here (I searched up for famiglia meant in Italian and indeed it means family).

My first experience here was not that great but every time I have been here after has been amazing.  

I usually come here every Friday &amp; it is always packed.  I would recommend reservations especially on a weekend night.  One of the main reasons my first experience here was not excellent is I didn&#39;t really see anything on the menu I was familiar with or cared a lot for.  My second visit here I asked for something that wasn&#39;t on the menu with was gnocchi with vodka sauce.  I can say with out hesitation that this place served me the absolute best gnocchi with vodka sauce that I have ever tasted.  

Another one of my favorites here is the clams.  They serve two different kinds of clams.  One of them is served in a red marinara sauce &amp; the second is served in a white creamier sauce.  

They do have a full bar here &amp; serve champagne by the bottle.  Their champagne prices by the bottle are reasonable.  We usually order a bottle of Vueve Clicquot for $90.  This is definitely cheaper than some champgane prices in the city.  

Lastly the service here has always been phenomenal.  Between the service the food &amp; the atmosphere I really enjoy eating here &amp; will continue to come here on a regular basis.

When I called the restaurant to ask about why I was overcharged on my credit card, they looked into it and found the &#34;error&#34;.  They asked I come all the way back to the restaurant to pick up the $36 dollar difference in cash because to put the amount back on my card would be &#34;too much paperwork&#34;.  It was a huge inconvenience and... I&#39;m still baffled about this, but I did not get a SINGLE apology from the restaurant.  

I&#39;ve been in the service industry and I understand accidents happen but this was a huge error to make that would not be tolerated in most places.  To top that off, their response was terrible.


The food was good but because of the poor customer service and sketchy activity at this location I will never go back again."francescas-famiglia-barrington,Lou F.,PHwMRPhxnzaQ-Ebzq2o8vg,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,29,WKY8EpCpptslk36iSVoM4w,1,29/03/16,"One word to describe this Francesca&#39;s location. TOILET! It&#39;s sad to say because I visited pretty much every Francesca&#39;s in the Northwest suburbs and they have all been quite good. My first visit was mediocre at best so I didn&#39;t leave a review, I thought I would give it another chance and I&#39;m sorry I did. The wait staff was horrible and the food was even worse. When you walk in the arrogance of the hostess and manager truly feels like they are doing you a favor visiting their restaurant. Kind of weird. Sorry guys this place is not that special...The pasta tasted like frozen store bought and the sauce was tasteless and not seasoned. As for the fish... OMG! Freezer burned, over cooked what ever they want to call it was not good. This place better make some management changes or it will be definitely be closing soon. The recent reviews reflect this place is in a downward spiral."francescas-famiglia-barrington,Kali S.,lAJsxprIik3-EsA8iMUqWw,"Palatine, IL",0,1,0,0,6,E3TyzuIAMoiZWfvKJjQuxw,3,17/02/16,"We went there for dinner tonight and I&#39;m glad we had a coupon. The waitress was just a bit off. She didn&#39;t seem to actually care how we were doing or want to check in. She asked if we wanted soup or salad and we both ordered one. We had no idea that the salad was going to be $7! If you want to ask if we want to add a soup or salad fine, but I felt like the practice was a bit predatory. That said, the minestrone was some of the best we&#39;ve ever had. The salad was pretty good and a decent portion. I just wish they had been more upfront and honest about it. 

Actually, this was one of the best Italian meals I&#39;ve had in a while. I find most Italian places are just pasta and sauce that I could make myself. Not here. The rigatoni was exceptional. The veggies were all well done and the sauce was well above average. My friend got the salmon and said it was fine. They asked how he wanted the fish done (i.e. medium, well done, etc). Is that even a thing? It was a bit odd but it was good. Overall, I give them 5 stars for the food but 1-2 stars for service."francescas-famiglia-barrington,Andrew K.,5E_uZPilFnqJmL0uo4nO4g,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,1,0,4,57,inryMRG6Asb53BtY3JfyIQ,2,22/02/16,"So we have frequented this location many times and have had amazing experiences here.  Unfortunately, our experience dining Saturday evening will keep us away for the foreseeable future.  While they were predictably busy at 5:30 on a Saturday night, they were not handling the traffic gracefully.  Once seated, drinks were so hard to come by that we were making trips to the bar just to get our own refills.  The food was great as always, but the lack of service  turned a laid back group of 4 into enraged diners facing a $300 check no one felt justified to pay."francescas-famiglia-barrington,Michael P.,40_Bs5LCTUsu5ty3TxeryQ,"Barrington, IL",0,1,0,3,2,PbnqEIJbA1kxjHZ30sA6zA,3,04/01/16,"Good place in a cool setting.

We all chose a different one. In each case the pasta was very undercooked, the cream sauces were very heavy, the tomato based sauce was ok.

Pretty good wine list.  The menu is limited. However, this means they focus more on their offerings. The only reason for the four stars is that we ordered one of the most expensive wines and when we asked to have the wine decanted, the waiter took the bottle away from the table and then brought it back with the decanter. Small thing, but open the wine at the table and leave it there. 

The one thing I loved the most here us the fact that they treated us like we were regular customers. They made us feel like we mattered and that our experience was important.

I didn&#39;t experience any difficulty with the speed and the server was very helpful (charming even, may I say), but I can imagine how hungry folks would see different.

Our server was very nice and thorough, but our lunches took a very long time. Shortly after we placed our order, a group of kids (around 9 or 10 years old who should have been in school, I thought) came in. They were loud (but not as loud as one might have expected) and held up the kitchen a while, I suspect. When we left, the host apologized to us about the noise and explained that the group was the final &#34;exam&#34; of an etiquette class. 

The food was good--I had a veggie panino with goat cheese and it was lovely. My friend ordered the three course prix fixe and said it was the best meal she&#39;d had in a long time (they had a special menu in honor of their anniversary). Something on her plate involved meat balls. I did not try it. I loved the crme brle, which made it all worthwhile for me. 

I&#39;ve been to Francesca&#39;s Fortunado in Frankfort and that experience didn&#39;t make me super excited to try Francesca&#39;s Famiglia, but I was glad I did.

I&#39;d been dying to try Francesca&#39;s for a while because of their gluten free menu, but picking up food from here was a total disappointment!  I got the gluten free Penne Aalio e Olio.  The description on the menu said it had fresh garlic, diced tomatoes, and spinach.  Sounds good, right?  The gluten free pasta actually had an okay taste, but it was terribly overcooked so the penne was just shreds of pasta.  I know gluten free pasta is delicate, but that&#39;s really not acceptable for pasta from a restaurant.  Also, there were hardly any tomatoes, and the spinach was really really soggy.  The garlic was in a giant clump at the bottom of the dish, so when I discovered it and tried to spread it out, the flavor was overwhelming.  I felt like a fire-breathing dragon.

Maybe I&#39;d come back and give them another chance, but at $14 a dish (with tax), I think there are a bunch of better options out there.

It&#39;s straight on Franchesca&#39;s branded food that I would describe as somewhat overpriced and inconsistent dish over dish over time - I eat here often and come up with the same refrain - who is in the kitchen ? 

While it&#39;s Italian - it&#39;s incredibly Hispanic on all fronts.  

I wish they would become a gourmet Hispanic restaurant - we have nothing like that here.

Identity issues but that being said they appear to do well - but again the food - restaurant choices are so slim that almost average could be considered great.

I have been to several locations and this was by far the worse.  The service was horrible.

I came here with my boyfriend on a double date with my parents.  It was a Saturday night so I called and asked how long the wait was, the girl on the phone said 15 minutes.  I then asked if they do call ahead seating so I could put my name on the waiting list and head over.  She said yes and took my information.

When I arrived they claimed they do not do call ahead seating or reservations and the wait was now 25 minutes.  I was frustrated and they told me that they would get me seated as soon as possible.  Well our 15 minutes quickly turned into over an hour with someone telling us you will be next a couple times.

The service sucked.  Our waiter kept forgetting about us.  The table next too us was a bunch of obnoxiously drunk and loud 40 year olds.

It took about 40 minutes and we asked about the food.  once we asked it was brought out immediately... my pasta was burnt like it had sat under the fryer.

I would give them one star, but the manager tried to appease us by giving us a free dessert platter.  But, needless to say, I will not be returning anytime soon."francescas-famiglia-barrington,Michele B.,5QIKSsA37FTkAae9hJeCTg,"Long Grove, IL",1,1,0,81,18,b80V7FEx2A2IaDYv6vjrIg,1,26/02/13,"They get a star for trying to put out the steam that was coming from my ears.  We called and asked how long the wait was for a party of 4 on Saturday, they said oh, about 15 minutes.  Seriously,  we even called a second time and again &#34;about 15 minutes&#34; so we put our name in and said we would be there in a few minutes because we were in the area..  So when we got there and the place was packed we walked up to the hostess and gave our name and she said we can&#39;t find it, so the other girl came and looked in the book and in the computer and couldn&#39;t find our name.  The manager came up and said oh we don&#39;t take names until people are actually here.  We told him about our conversation we JUST had with his staff and he said he would oblige our request and it would be a few minutes.  

We waited and waited and after a bit I went and asked the hostess how long it would be and she said &#34;well we said 15 minutes and it has been only 12 minutes.  !!!!!!!!!!!!
Needless to say we waited and one of the managers or assistant manager not sure who, kept coming buy and saying &#34;only a few more minutes, we&#39;re clearing a table now&#34;  &#34;only a few more minutes, tables are leaving now&#34;  &#34; we will be seating you shortly&#34;, etc. etc.  I kid you not, I would have rather cut our losses and been told the truth and made it another time.  

Finally seated 50 minutes later!   Well, the other couple at this point was so hungry they could have cared less what we ordered.  So we started with calamari, it was served nicely and fresh and pretty timely.  We finished our appetizer and were waiting with empty glasses (both water and wine) for our waiter to take out order.  We flagged him down twice.  We were given the &#34;one minute sign&#34;.  Finally, we ordered!!  Nothing exceptionally difficult.  A chicken dish, ravioli, a salad and some lamb chips.  IT TOOK OVER  40 MINUTES.  When the waiter came to the table and I asked if there was a problem he said &#34;the manager knows that you have been waiting&#34;  &#34;it&#39;s not my fault&#34;. Seriously??  When the food arrived you could tell it had been under the heat lamps for a long time because the ravioli was dry around the edges.

The manager arrived and said he was sorry and would love to buy us a Limoncello after dinner, we graciously accepted, acknowledging his attempt to make things right.  When our waiter returned to clear the table, we asked for the check, not knowing when or if he would return again.  Another manager came to the table and apologized and asked if we would please accept dessert for our troubles.  My appetite was pretty well shot by this time, but again we accepted.  10 minutes later, dessert, we were asked if we wanted coffee.  We ordered cappuccino and regular coffee.  While we waited, the Lemoncello arrived, from the other manager.  One hand didn&#39;t know what the other was doing.  But they tried.

Well the end to a perfectly horrible experience, the coffee was cold!!  I was here once before and gave it a good rating based on the food and service back in 2011-what changed?  Looking at some of the other reviews, it seems like a lot.

Thanks for trying, but too many wrongs did not make it right.

They had no clue what they were doing at this place, what a joke.  Finally sit after complaining, get a table with bread and cheese, no oil. That takes a while. Order a glass of wine and meals at same time, wine never shows up.

The only Italian places I remember are all the Olive Gardens and some hole in the wall place in Wheeling (on Hintz Road, disgusting).

Right from the get-go, this place was awesome. The servers were all extremely friendly. We ordered a two glasses of reisling, salad and a shrimp bisque for starters. The salad was nice but the bisque was out of this world!! Of course, we were given the usual bread and butter and olive oil before this. It was fresh and warm. :)

Then for main course we had some chicken tortellini dish and i think a &#34;pollo alla salvio&#34; or something. Both of these dishes were unbelievably tasty. It just left you with a very satisfied feeling. I kept wanting to stuff my face but resisted and got it packed for lunch the next day. Also, I had to save some space in the tummy for dessert. 

To bring the meal to a close, we ordered a creme brulee and a coconut cake with caramel sauce and creme anglais. I cannot even begin to describe how delicious the cake was. It was quite a big piece too and was garnished with a few mint leaves. I always eat these if provided - nature&#39;s mouth freshener. The creme brulee was just as good as any.

I definitely would go back here. It was worth every penny and I really want to try all the different entrees.

They were also able to offer menu options with flexibility which was great since my mother is allergic to pepper, seafood, peppers, nuts, and a few more.  The waiter was able to put a dish together that met the needs of my mother and was delicious.

But this past Friday night we decided to get take out...I ordered a dish off of their gluten free menu, I believe it was the al pomodoro (sp?). It was supposed to have a &#39;spicy tomato basil sauce&#39;. Upon tasting it, I realized something was very, very wrong with this dish. 1) It had no spice whatsoever. Ok, no big deal, I can add spice. But as I took another bite it became clear that the chef had dumped about a pound of salt in the sauce. Now I love salt. I usually add salt to my dishes (bad, I know) but this dish was inedible. I was upset because the GF pasta itself was wonderful. It had great texture and was cooked perfectly. I wish I could&#39;ve eaten it but there was no way anyone could eat this. 

I called the next day to speak to the manager. He was not in and I was told I would get a call back at 3 pm that same day. I never did.

I called back that Monday.  I was cranky upon calling because no one had called me back when they said they would. &#34;Stash&#34; answered, the general manager. He listened to my explanation and he was extremely kind and understanding. He thanked me for bringing it to his attention and told me to stop in and he&#39;ll cook me a new one. I went in that evening after work to pick up the new dish. Stash offered me a glass of wine while I waited. He was really so, so sweet and generous. As I waited, I noticed every one of his customers that walked thru the door gave him a huge smile and handshake (and a hug!)  He brought me out the new dish, this time a different one, a veggie GF pasta with a garlic herb broth. It was fabulous!! 

Stash certainly made me want to come back despite the poor dish I was given. He makes his customers feel right at home."francescas-famiglia-barrington,Jeff S.,TumJNxwabACJsY2GkgV8Yw,"Barrington, IL",0,1,0,127,12,NaIublDKl1trTdP9W5u7Jg,5,24/06/13,Always consistent.

We dined recently on the Sunday after Christmas.  We thought it would be relaxing but not so.  The food and the service do not disappoint.  The noise level and children running in the restaurant are a problem. The child next to us bumped into our table and I quickly grabbed my wine so it would not tip over. The children at another table ran around our table bumping into the chair.  One child threw pieces of bread on the floor. The parents did not pick up but left for the servers to do.

This Francesca&#39;s is in Barrington, Illinois and is situated in downtown Barrington so it is a busy establishment.    The food is a little overpriced, however, the discounted gift cards keeps it within the market price.  The Calamari Fritti and Mussels Pomodoro have great flavor.  I found that their Chicken entrees tend to be overcooked.  The pizzas and salads are ok but nothing special.

Delicious!! A plentiful steaming dish of pasta carbonara comes out. The bread was hot and soaked up the olive oil perfectly. The decor is very &#34;Italian&#34;, but not as nauseating as most Italian chain restaurants.

Background music is great... wine was good... but that&#39;s all.  Glasses were less than sparkly clean.   We split a pizza as an appetiser.  I don&#39;t eat frozen pizza, but I bet that is better than what we were served.  It was a soggy mess. My husbands pork chop was as dry as shoe leather, not edible and my roast chicken came out floating in heavy cream sauce.  I guess for some who like cream sauces, this would be a treat.  I&#39;m not a fan and as the menu said nothing about the cream sauce, it was a dissappointment to us.  I say us, as after determining the pork chop is not edible I thought we could at least split the roast chicken.   Service is spotty.  People ask how everything is, but are in such a hurry to walk by the table, you can never say what the problem(s) are.

We were hoping this would become our new fave in the area, but no such luck.  The search for a good Italian restaurant in the Barrington area is still on.

First and foremost the place was packed,  which some may find appealing.   Maybe it means they have good food?   Too bad there were SO many people waiting to check in, the lobby was literally packed.   Barely room to breathe.   We finally checked in for our 6:45 reservation at 7pm (yes we were on time and yes it took that long just to get to the hostess stand).  Were seated at a decent table and promptly ordered drinks.  My husband didn&#39;t like his and sent it back for something else.   Mine didn&#39;t come as ordered.   So both drinks had to be sent back.   We ordered the calamari,  which we found to be incredibly over cooked and didn&#39;t even finish.   The house bread and seasoned olive oil was delicious though.   We had been seated for about 30 minutes (maybe longer).  Finally had to ask or waiter if we could order our entrees.   He seemed surprised.  Food took a while but both our dishes were bone-in so would take longer than usual, they get a pass on this one.  The atmosphere could have been more romantic.   The place was very loud but family friendly.   We saw plenty of kids there.  Prices were about $15-$20 for a pasta dish and $25+ for a entre.   All in all a great more fresh version of the chain Italian restaurants.

We have been here many times. The only problem sometimes is the service, we have had some waiters that are not too good. One time we actually handed our tip to one of the bus boys because he provided a much superior service.

The calamari is the BEST, you must get it. We have loved all of their pasta dishes and have had everything from the tomato based, cream and olive oil type sauces. They always add enough seafood in their seafood dishes. The chocolate cake dessert is great too if you are looking for an extra treat.

It turned out to be a soggy, and sorry Chilean Sea Bass. The manager blithely explained he uses Google to write the &#34;Italian&#34; in his menu!

My nephew &amp; I had medallions of veal which we both enjoyed. They were quite flavorful and complimented by the sides.  My brother &amp; S-i-L ordered from the days specials.  

My bro, had lamb shanks with mashed potatoes and vegetable.  It was not very &#34;Italian&#34;, but the taste of it that I had, made me wish I had ordered the same. So, what&#39;s &#34;Italian&#34; anyway?  I guess there were some hints of a tomato based gravy.

My s-i-l had  Grouper, a fish that I like very much.  She didn&#39;t eat all of hers and asked if I wanted to finish the  remaining portion of it, which I did.  When I tasted the grouper when it was first served, it seemed very good, but after it was served, half-way through the meal, it had taken on a rather &#34;fishy&#34; taste.  I mean like it lacked freshness.  Grouper is not a fish that retains freshness well.  In fact, I normally only eat it when I visit an area near to where it is caught .

The herbed olive oil for bread dipping is fantastic.

Immediately after coming in the door, a gentleman took our coats and gave us a coat check ticket right at the door.  The Matre d&#39; seated us immediately.

My wife and I both felt comfortable wearing jeans, and there were plenty of people who had brought their children there (though I still felt like I was surrounded by adults, and not at Chuck-e Cheese&#39;s).

Drinks, appetizers and entres all came quickly and each was brought out after the other one was completed (they didn&#39;t bring the salad until our appetizer was finished).  Pasta portions were very large.  What we would call 4 servings at home was a single serving here.  However, looking around, there were others with non-pasta meals where the portions looked more reasonably sized.

I waited and waited for things to get better. The poor staffing, the mediocre food, and the crowd all left a lot to be desired. 


If this restauranteur is to survive* in a highly competitive business, the service, and the food better be spectacular.  I think the management would greatly benefit from the secret shopper to offer training to improve the guest experience and/ or management consultant to improve the user experience.

 It used to be that a restaurant could open fairly quietly. You had time to work out the menu and staffing issues, relative obscurity to find your voice and style, and months of experience to adequately adjust the flow and feel of the front and back of the house.

*The fact that restaurants fail at an alarmingly high rate, as 90 to 95 percent in the first year, is actually wrong. According to recent studies done by Professor Dr. HG Parsa 59% of hospitality facilities fail in the period of 3 years."brandts-of-palatine-palatine,April R.,y6rtuvEJYBBu7WW1QWLyYw,"Savannah, GA",0,1,0,18,2,fd_pbZJNws27dcYWA8EI7A,4,19/10/16,I think the chili must have had beer in it.

Packed with friendly locals. The food was excellent.

Started the night off with some cheese curds, the cheese tasty, the dough light and airy, with honey mustard to dip it in. Recommended.

The burgers.. Where do I begin? You HAVE to order a burger. It&#39;s necessary. I had a burger with Munster, bacon, mushrooms, and all of the toppings.. The burger was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of fat in the meat. Don&#39;t forget the Mac and cheese, heavenly. Worth it, has a lot of cheesy punch. The coleslaw slightly peppery. And the house made chips, excellent.

The boy had buttered burger with american and the toppings it comes with. The steak fries were tasty.

Only downfall, our server was delightful, but it took a bit of time to get the check and to also have it picked up to run the card. Also, during hawks games, the area we sat in, down the stairs, the volume needed to be up a bit more so we can hear the TVs! But we&#39;re definitely coming back in the future, many many times.

Everytime its the same problem.  
Their burgers are bland.
Almost positive they put zero seasoning on their patties before they hit the flattop, further evidenced by their appearance on Chicago&#39;s Best.  There is also no sear, which is how you get great flavor.

The service is always fine, and the people are nice, but you can tell the owners&#39; experience isn&#39;t in restaurants.  As someone who&#39;s worked in restaurants for over a decade, you know to season your proteins.

So as a suggestion, put some salt (kosher/sea) and pepper on your patties right before you cook &#39;em!  Also, cook em on a higher heat for a better sear.  Basic restaurant fundamentals.  These things seriously lack flavor.

On a positive note, the burgers are moist, and could be pretty decent.

However, with the change in ownership last year, Yelp must have created a new profile.

We ate at Brandt&#39;s last over a month ago and the experience was great. I posted an updated review complimenting the staff about how much better the place was under new management. But, I hope our experience this night was just a bad night.

We were seated right away. Brandt&#39;s is small, and we were put at a table that was crowded in by other tables leaving little room for movement. The waitress was energetic, but was not attentive. We placed our order shortly after sitting down. It took her about ten minutes to deliver my drink, a coke. We were all talking and didn&#39;t realize it until we checked, but 1/2 hour passed before they finally delivered our food. 

Two items (three people in our party) had to send food back. My hamburger was supposed to be cook medium - their burgers are at least 1/2 pound and usually great. But one side of mine was charred and the other side was raw. Well, I guess if you take the average of them it was medium? I didn&#39;t mention that the fries were under-cooked.

They were apologetic and said they would replace the burger, which they did. The second burger was fine, and the fries were still under-cooked but better than before.

One hot button of mine is the server&#39;s attentiveness to drink refills. I drank my coke while waiting for the meal to be served. When they dropped off my second burger, they ran off quickly and did not notice all three of us had empty glasses. I was finally able to flag her down and ask for refills, but they really should watch for that.

The steak fries and sweet potato fries were simply soggy with no crispyness at all. The homemade chips and baked beans tried to do too much in terms of flavor and as a result, didn&#39;t really present a clear theme. The BBQ ribs were too dry and lacked flavor.

Uncharacteristic of Brandt&#39;s (though we&#39;d only been there two or three times previously), it took the better part of an hour to get our food (there were three of us).

When I came in, I immediately noticed how there wasn&#39;t very much room at all.

Cozy would be putting it nice. I like to have a little more room to move.

The menu is pretty limited - one burger that you can customize with your choice of potato, some other sandwiches, soups, and salad. I got the burger, which was very tasty and juicy. I really don&#39;t have any complaints about the food or the prices. It&#39;s good for what you pay. They also have a decent selection of beers on draft and bottled.

The service was meh. When I first walked in I wasn&#39;t greeted. I had to ask if you seat yourself or if someone is supposed to seat you. When I was seated, I had a choice between 2 tables, neither of which had much room. Our waitress was a little snippy at first, but got better later on.

The steak fries and sweet potato fries were simply soggy with no crispyness at all. The homemade chips and baked beans tried to do too much in terms of flavor and as a result, didn&#39;t really present a clear theme. The BBQ ribs were too dry and lacked flavor.

Given the other good reviews, maybe I came when they were too busy and would get a better experience if I came at a slower time."brandts-of-palatine-palatine,Gene S.,hNb00pX5WavJdaE7bM-rSQ,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,1,0,1,16,IUvmFwLtiWGNFAxghh0Svw,2,29/09/15,"We were in on a Friday night around 6 o&#39;clock. 

Our only seating choice was in &#34;the basement&#34; to the right of the entrance.

It&#39;s a small space with the fine stench of mold. That coupled with country music that was too loud and three flat-screen TV&#39;s was almost too much to take.

It took awhile to get a waitress and when she came, she wasn&#39;t the most pleasant woman.

Uncharacteristic of Brandt&#39;s (though we&#39;d only been there two or three times previously), it took the better part of an hour to get our food (there were three of us).

The burgers tasted better on previous visits and the fries were cold.

I&#39;ll chalk it up to an &#34;off&#34; night for them, but they could do better."brandts-of-palatine-palatine,Wanana M.,8QqUtNTYfDnQBqko2jGNgQ,"Ocean Isle Beach, NC",0,1,0,0,1149,D2EwqFSc0ezAr3_CzBLQVg,4,09/04/16,Place is small but packs a flavor punch.

When I came in, I immediately noticed how there wasn&#39;t very much room at all. The tables are squished together (we ended up sitting at one right by the bathroom), you have to squeeze through people at the bar to get to your table or the bathroom, and the tables themselves are pretty small. Cozy would be putting it nice. I like to have a little more room to move.

The menu is pretty limited - one burger that you can customize with your choice of potato, some other sandwiches, soups, and salad. I got the burger, which was very tasty and juicy. I really don&#39;t have any complaints about the food or the prices. It&#39;s good for what you pay. They also have a decent selection of beers on draft and bottled.

The service was meh. When I first walked in I wasn&#39;t greeted. I had to ask if you seat yourself or if someone is supposed to seat you. When I was seated, I had a choice between 2 tables, neither of which had much room. Our waitress was a little snippy at first, but got better later on. 

I would come back, but it wouldn&#39;t be my first choice.

It was a disaster!  
1. Impolite rushed waitress,  kept interupting as we ordered.
2. My burger had a pool of blood gushing all around plate-NOT the way I ordered it.
3. Sent the burger back and Waitress was &#34;mad&#34;.
4. Plate came right back I guess they wiped the blood but didn&#39;t finish cooking it as it was still Bloody... 
5. Sent it back, to which the waitress replied meanly &#34;thats the way its suppose to be!&#34;.
6. Decided to order the small wing appetizer.
7. While WAITING long time, another customer had Same BLOODY problem had to send hers back.
8. The owner/manager went back to kitchen with 2nd complaint
9. The other customer waited long time but got a NEW burger.
10.  I&#39;m WAITING and my husband is now done and he remarks:
A. The burger is NOT monsterous. like they claim only 1/2 lb. BUT the BUN is monsterous.  
B.  The flavor was as a steamed burger not grilled, pale and no flavor.
C. After about 1hr he felt sick from it.
D. His sweet Potato fries appeared to me to have cornstarch coating which some people with dietary issues do NOT want.. but nothing was said... it had a coating on it. like burger king use to do.
E.  Finally paid check, stood still WAITING for 5 peices of wings.
F. Got Wings, got outside to car, looked in bag and the carton was not sealed so grease was in the bag.. and on the outside of the carton. 
G.  NOTHING but GREASE coming off wings. Yeah a pale red to show there was some hot sauce but the &#34;sauce&#34; was all grease and all pooled up in the bottom and disaster.
H. I got out of vehicle as I didn&#39;t want GREASE all over and thru it out in their trash can.

We were a party of six and were seated at a table in the corner and were so wedged in that it was impossible for most of us to get up if we had to without the rest of the table also getting up. It really is a tiny restaurant with a few too many tables. 

I&#39;ve been to Brandt&#39;s several times and I usually stick with their specialty, the Brandt burger, and this time was no exception.  I like my burgers pink and juicy, and this one was cooked pretty close to well done even though I had ordered it medium. No worries though, it was good. The burgers are pretty giant and I happily took half home for lunch the next day.

It is a steakhouse as well as a banquet hall.

We arrived at 7:45 P.M. for our 7:30 P.M. reservation. The restaurant wasn&#39;t packed but it wasn&#39;t completely empty. My party was seated in a very secluded part of the facility.

The dim lighting and old fashioned &#39;vibe&#39; the restaurant gave off was comforting. I knew that St. Charles place had existed but I had no idea what it was or how big it was inside. My mom mentioned that it was akin to an old supper club (she&#39;s not even that old but older than me).

St. Charles Place features standard steakhouse fare; steaks, seafood, pasta, sandwiches, and burgers. They have some unique appetizers and specialties such as Steak Tartare and Roasted Duck.

I ordered a bowl of the French Onion Soup to start off. It was extremely cheesy and I enjoyed it. It was a bit overpriced for $8.99; probably a $4.99 value. 

For my entre, I ordered the 11 oz. Filet with a garden salad and Italian vegetables. As one can see in my photo, the steak was served topped with an onion ring and side of mushrooms! My steak was cooked perfectly to a medium too. The garden salad was pretty small, but the balsamic vinaigrette with the salad was actually the best vinaigrette I&#39;d ever had! As for the sides, well, they were excellent as well. Not over seasoned, either!

I expected to pay a high price for my meal ($38 plus soup), but I was very satisfied with the meal. Why not five star? The service at STC place was average at best. The waitress was nice, but she disappeared at various points during the night. Also, I don&#39;t know if is policy, but she never refilled our waters; only the busboys did it. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. They are known for their Ribeye (seen on Chicago&#39;s Best). If the service improves the next time I&#39;m here, I will give them a nice bump."st-charles-place-st-charles-2,Vicky V.,PxyVUQhYkNiQlYUWfNB91Q,"St. Charles, IL",0,1,0,4,170,vlnF3QPGguyg5fOvGJ4osQ,5,17/06/16,"Great restaurant, good service, awesome food.

The food itself was delicious, and although it was expensive and service was slow, the steak au poivre alone was enough to deserve 4 over 3 stars.  I would give it 3.5 if I could. 

Food- We decided to skip apps since it was pricey and it took a long time for the waitress to come take our drink orders.  So straight to dinner.  I had the steak au poivre and holy balls it was good.  The steak was cooked perfectly to medium, the mashed potatoes were creamy and prepared steakhouse style with the skins in them, great asparagus, and that cognac sauce.  Tasted like my grandmas champagne gravy and that is the highest grade of compliment I can give.  Would recommend this dish to anyone.  Warning: don&#39;t order the kids steak.  My ten year old brother cut it in half, but I could have eaten it in one bite, and it was fifteen bucks.  

Service- Nice but slow.  Forgivable because of how busy they were.

Go to Perry&#39;s in oak brook order a steak bring it to your chef and tell him to season it. It&#39;s a waste of perfectly cooked meat. It&#39;s a shame.

Ugh. My wife and I were obliged to attend, but having eaten at St Charles Place several times in the last few years, my expectations were low. Let&#39;s just say our experience was &#34;Below Expectations&#34;.

There are many great steak houses in Chicago. If any of them were nearby this place would be put out of business. Benny&#39;, Morton&#39;s, Ruth&#39;s Chris, Capital Grille, and Sullivan&#39;s all put St Charles Place to shame. And local steak joints such as Harvest, Fox Fire, and Rox City Grill - that maybe aren&#39;t at the same level as those listed above - are still light years ahead of St Charles Place. So when Thom, the troglodyte owner, pissed me off, I decided my fellow Yelper&#39;s should be warned. Here&#39;s the run down:

* The decor is dated, and not in a good way, but it&#39;s hard to tell because it&#39;s so dark, making it difficult for the mostly elderly patrons to read their menus. 

* Yes, this is blue hair food. Meant for the blue-blockers crowd who like it better than the drivel they serve at the Alzheimer care facility. The Yelper&#39;s who gave 4 or 5 star reviews must not be let out of the home very often, as they clearly have no idea how great a modern american steak house can be. 

* If you like large slabs of meat of unknown provenance, they do that here, though not cooked or seasoned with any apparent skill. Of the 7 meals served at our table, the prime rib looked to be the safest choice in the event that you too are pressed into service at a family obligation at this establishment.

* The Minestrone soup was mostly salt water with a few remnants of withered vegetable parts and a day old crouton. Get a salad instead and hope they don&#39;t screw up the salad dressing like they did for my brother.

* I had the special, which was supposed to be &#34;Filet tips in a red wine sauce&#34;. It was more like horse meat in canned gravy. Meh! I gave the leftovers to my brother. He took one bite the next day and threw them out.

* I asked for the &#34;Filet Tips&#34; to be served over fettuccine instead of over mashed potatoes, but was told there were no substitutions. The waitress was not rude about it, and to be fair, they honored my request without much resistance. But seriously - I&#39;m the customer, I am at your place of business, spending my hard earned cash, and I am asking for the food to be prepared the way I want it, so I can enjoy eating it, yet the policy of the house is &#34;No Substitutions&#34;. This is your fault Thom.

* Another Thom issue - He loaded all the tables in our waitresses section simultaneously. As a result, our waitress was overwhelmed, so it took two painful hours to finish our meal. Our reservations were at 6, but by 7:25 we hadn&#39;t gotten our main courses yet. I&#39;m not sure why I was surprised, as the slow pace of service is typical at this establishment. 

* The music was so loud I couldn&#39;t hear the other people at our table. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love loud music and usually the louder the better, but not at a restaurant while I&#39;m trying to engage in conversation with my family at a large table. So I requested that the music be turned down. The waitress warned me that Thom would probably not cooperate with my request, and true to her word, Thom changed the channel to a less raucous radio station, but didn&#39;t lower the volume. He then came to our table said that he had changed the channel, but ignored me as I tried to engage him to repeat my request. Thom, I didn&#39;t ask for you to change the channel, I asked you to turn it down. You purposefully ignored my request and pissed me off, so I hope you like your new Yelp review just as much as I enjoyed eating your horse meat.

And before you go fire another waitress like you did after other bad reviews, remember you&#39;re the owner Thom. It&#39;s all your fault that your restaurant sucks. You need to fix everything except the bread, and then go fire yourself so somebody who understands customer service can take over as maitre d&#39;."st-charles-place-st-charles-2,Michael B.,WQXzmTOl5Bfyf_6ZDo7m1w,"St Charles, IL",0,1,0,0,1,Eg8q4ESq3OkIzI5JMGs_rA,4,20/09/16,"We were &#34;walk-ins&#34; last night (Saturday) and although the restaurant was busy we couldn&#39;t have been more welcomed.

The service has been consistently unpleasant the last few times. I&#39;m not sure who the older angry lounge server is, but she has some anger issues. After waiting at a bar table for 10 minutes I finally went to the bar itself asking who our server might be. She snapped at me &#34;I am! I&#39;ll be right there&#34;. The lounge was not overly busy - and we are patient people.

She finally came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. It was a couple of martini&#39;s. She came back with the drinks - set them down without a word and she was gone. We wanted to eat as well.  So now I have to go back up to get some menus. The general rudeness persisted, culminating with our expensive appetizers being more or less dropped in front us, the dirty dishes not removed throughout the evening and the check silently dropped off. No thanks - nothing. The bill hovered around $130.00.

The food is great - hand down. The martini&#39;s are delicious. The service though for the last two times was so bad - it breaks my heart to move on. It&#39;s a wonderful looking restaurant and a great place for a quiet busy couple to relax, however lousy service just puts a little back rain cloud over everything. If we were treated even average, this would be a 4 or 5 star review.

Update: After reading previous reviews I think we had Amanda as well. Our wife and I will try again and if she is gone and the service is where it needs to be for a restaurant of this caliber I will certainly adjust the review."st-charles-place-st-charles-2,Dan G.,vFZFkq_UBJhplHYUGPOMZw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,1,1,t8MNVUMg9QwfAfQPWOBdqw,1,30/08/15,"Disappointed in the service. Our sever Amanda was short, disrespectful and borderline offensive with her demeanor. 

While the food was yummy, steakhouses should pride themselves in more than just the quality of their beef. After all, in Chicagoland there are well over 100 different steakhouses. Go to Chamagaucha, Benny&#39;s, Morton&#39;s or Gibsons. The staff there truly values the customer, which makes the quality of a fantastic meal even better.

Our server, Katrina was very helpful with pinpointing the house specialties, we ended up ordering the shrimp cocktail for appetizer (the best I&#39;ve had in Years) and the filet aupoire and prime rib for dinner.  Both dinners came with choice of side dish and soup (take notice of the new England clam chowder) or salad (house made dressings).  We had no room for dessert but the offerings looked incredible.

My date and I arrived around 8pm Monday night.  It took about 10 minutes for us to be assigned a waitress, who eventually came around and said, what would you like to drink?  No welcome or nothing.  

Examples of bad service:

Never asked us if our food was to our liking 

The first martini my date ordered had blue cheese olives when he specifically asked for regular olives and the second martini had no olives

I was having a deep conversation with my date and the waitress yelled at me from two tables down and asked if I needed something then walked to our table and told me I had a facial expression like I needed something (huh?) 

Didn&#39;t offer us dessert and instead gave us the check,  we asked if we could have dessert and she said oh yeah sorry kitchen is closed you guys are actually my last table we closed the kitchen long ago...  What?  Why didn&#39;t you tell us? 

Stayed by our table to get the check and watched us leave the tip and stated she needed to do her paperwork 

In between all of this she was practically throwing our plates when she put them on our table and when she would ask us if we needed anything she would walk away as she was asking.  Ughhhhh..  Now I get when people say they wouldn&#39;t return to a restaurant with bad service no matter the food.  Ambience,  food,  quirkiness,  all was muted out by one very inhospitable waitress.

I dislike bad food but what I dislike even more is paying too much for bad food. $30 for two nearly inedible crab cakes (I was hungry and could only finish one) with terrible sour succotash on the side and a few pieces of iceberg drowning in dressing.

As Morty Seinfeld said, &#34;Cheap fabric, dim lighting...that&#39;s what sells merchandise.&#34;

We arrived about 745 PM with our 730 PM reservation (which wasn&#39;t needed on a Tuesday night). The pictures on the wall and the menu are different. Let&#39;s just say they have a lot of character. Drinks were ordered and service was particularly slow. This wasn&#39;t a HUGE issue but it was late and some people had to be up early the next day. MONDAY NIGHT IS BURGER NIGHT BUT NO SUBSTITUTIONS (which is weird to think about...restaurants should aim to please, no?).

I bookmarked this place due to it being on Chicago&#39;s Best in February 2015. I always love when suburban places are highlighted. I try to get as many as I can.

Anyways, I ordered the 11 oz. filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. One of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever had. I haven&#39;t had that many. I don&#39;t have those &#34;RICH PEOPLE PROBZ&#34;. This came with vegetables and a salad. Plus one gigantic delicious onion ring. 

This place is also a banquet hall so it is HUGE. It made me feel like I was in with the F. Scott Fitzgerald &#34;Great Gatsby&#34; crowd.

They didn&#39;t go but made a note to ourselves to try it sometime as we were intrigued by their web site and the description that it &#34;brings back the times of the classic supper club&#34;.   It&#39;s not actually a &#39;supper club&#39;, but it does have that kind of vibe.  So if you&#39;re looking for a high-end steak place (like Morton&#39;s or Ruth Chris&#39;), this won&#39;t be what you&#39;re looking for.

It was, however, exactly what we wanted and were not disappointed.  We&#39;re early diners so it wasn&#39;t crowded at all.  Piano music in the background that wasn&#39;t too loud and really liked the throwback atmosphere and the way some of the dining areas are separated a bit.  Food was good and has enough variety to satisfy most palates and price ranges.  I had the Steak Diane and my wife had the Coconut Shrimp, sharing between us.  Both entrees came on warm plates, were tasty, and had good sized portions.  The warm, fresh rolls were a nice touch, which I guess is one of the things they&#39;re known for.

We didn&#39;t have any issues with the service or staff and found them all attentive, polite, and if anything too speedy with bringing our food.  We were prepared to linger a bit longer, but our salad and soup came out almost right away and entrees followed before we were completed them.  We&#39;re not usually big desert people but got a Key Lime Pie and Carrot Cake to go.  Pie was okay (good, not great) and same for the carrot cake except that the portion was HUGE...probably enough to feed three people!

Our only quibble is that they changed the music from piano to more of a pop station which seemed out of place.  It wasn&#39;t so loud we couldn&#39;t talk (or we would have asked them to turn it down), but the piano music was a much better fit for this place which otherwise is ideal for a nice meal and conversation with friends or family.

I am usually not the biggest fan of steakhouses because I really dislike a la cart side dish orders on top of meat I could cook at home very easily.  We had a Groupon, which helped the price.  This place didn&#39;t feel so expensive because you get some sides along with your steak.  My husband had a standard martini, which he wasn&#39;t happy with.  I told him it was his fault b/c he didn&#39;t specify which gin he wanted, but the waitress also didn&#39;t really give him a chance to.  I had an ok glass of wine.  Overall, I think it was fine, I liked the interior of the restaurant.  It&#39;s got a whimsical feel, especially with the Christmas decorations, but I think that was our last visit.  We don&#39;t go back to restaurants very often unless they are outstanding or super close to home, and this place was neither.

Just celebrate my birthday at the St Charles place steak house.  I had never been there and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was inside.  The place has character for sure.  A big, warm fireplace, nice romantic lighting, and interesting decorations makes it very inviting and comfortable.

Our waiter was nice but seemed distracted.  He did his job and made sure we had everything we needed but really didn&#39;t interact with us anymore than that.  Which actually, sometimes is nice.

The food was excellent.  I had the filet and lobster and my girlfriend had the ribeye.  Both steaks were prepared just like we ordered them and the lobster was melt in your mouth delicious.

During our meal the manager stopped by the table to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, which I think is a really nice touch.

All in all, a great experience.  The one downside is the place is pretty pricey.  They do have items like burgers on the menu which are less expensive but if you are going to have a steak, seafood, or wine, plan on dropping some coin.

We went here since we got a Groupon deal, and we always love some good steaks.  Upon driving up to the restaurant, the HUGE sign by the road for the restaurant seemed outdated and tacky.  Once we entered the restaurant, we waited for about 5 minutes before the hostess showed up.  I told her the name we made our reservation under, she asked rudely:&#34; What the name?&#34;  So I had to tell her again.  Once we were shown to our table, she put the menus down and walked away quickly, her parting words were:&#34; Sort them out yourselves.&#34; I guess she meant that we should sort the menus out ourselves.  Anyway, the first impression was poor.  We didn&#39;t really feel welcomed since there was no smile and warmth from the hostess at all.  

We waited about 10 minutes before our waitress showed up.   She took our drink order and then disappeared for another 10 minutes before I saw her near our table again.  I told her we are ready to order, she told me she would be right back.  Once she was back, she was perfectly nice and professional.  We were fine with her service from then on.

The food was mediocre.  The beef veg soup was way too salty, tasted like leftover soup from yesterday.  My son was happy with his cheeseburger, but we have had better steaks elsewhere.  The green beans was overcooked, and the mashed potato was blend.

I&#39;m a huge burger fan so I wanted to one of there&#39;s but was really disappointed by their egg burger and oily fries.  In addition to the bogus burger experience I was floored by the some of the bad attitudes of the staff and the lack of interest by the manager.  Sadly I probably won&#39;t be returning.st-charles-place-st-charles-2,Alexander C.,HSmDagITGhQykEYteenRCg,"Wayne, IL",0,1,0,0,82,t4Dc0tA1wiqkZanfRcL2yQ,3,09/05/16,"I have been here twice. The first time, I went with my wife. We went at the last minute - and it appeared to be busy. We were seated in the &#34;private room&#34; -- towards the front of the restaurant. Food was good. My wife had the burger and I had the prime rib. Prime rib was great - no fat on it. The saganaki was OK but I would pass. A bit pricey, but we had no complaints. However, I wasn&#39;t too impressed with the restaurant(see below). The private room takes away from the ambiance of the place. It&#39;s huge, and you don&#39;t get to enjoy any of the decor when you&#39;re tucked away in that room.

So Yesterday May 8th 2016 My wife and I took our son with my parents for a Mother&#39;s Day dinner. I called in on the 4th for a reservation. The guy on the phone was EXTREMELY rude (i&#39;ve seen this mentioned in other reviews too. Can&#39;t be a coincidence). He told me the only time available was 4:30 or 6:30. Since we had a little one with us, we went with the 4:30. That&#39;s fine. A little early but better for our son.

So we show up. Go figure, the restaurant is empty, and they try to shove us in the &#34;private room.&#34; I objected, was given a dirty look, and then seated at a table. Then I realized how awesome the decor in this place was. And how large the actual restaurant really is. Our waitress was fine. She did a good job. But......there was a limited menu. I mean very limited. Which is fine. But, not everyone at our table was in the mood for a $30 entree. It would have been nice if they told us on the phone that they had a limited menu for mother&#39;s day. Other restaurants would do that. Even the kids menu only had two options. I felt kind of scammed. It was like they were trying to keep the quality high by offering a small menu, but also capitalize on it in terms of a money standpoint. You think they would have offered some sort of sandwiches. All of the food was good. But the prime rib was better the last time I went. This cut had a lot of excess fat and un-edible portions on it. Based on the price and the miniature sides I received, i&#39;m not sure if I would order the prime rib again.

I will probably give this place another try. We like the decor. And the proximity to our house in Wayne. And the servers have all been nice. But for the price I would expect a little bit more."st-charles-place-st-charles-2,J B.,kjjN3liOU9dwGjDAKLqr6A,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,1,10,3YeaFhaREmwDXCh2Ce-Z6A,5,26/03/15,"I came back w my parents the other night because we have always enjoyed great restaurants and we were not disappointed. My parents are older don&#39;t eat as much as they used to so when dad ate a good portion of his steak tonight that is huge.

We sat down and my parents were as impressed w the dcor and roominess of the area we were in. We ordered drinks and were able to enjoy them casually because the waitress, Sherrie, gave us plenty of time. Dad ordered the NY Strip, mom had the 10oz prime rib and I had the rack of lamb served double cut. My mom and I enjoyed the cream of spinach soup &amp; dad had the salad w bleu cheese toppings. A lot of bleu cheese. 

The steaks were done as requested w fresh mushrooms on the NY Strip and nice pinkness on the prime rib w a horseradish dressing on the side. My lamb was very good w a decoratedly cut lemon in the accompanying au jus.

Anybody who complains about the dcor is nuts which we were quite comfortable. We all wished that St Charles wasn&#39;t so far away because we would be regulars. The drinks were great and we appreciated the bartenders &#34;loose&#34; arm.

It always seems to be busy so I figured it must be fairly good.  

My girlfriend said the filet was &#34;ok&#34;.  It came with a side of what I swear were canned mushrooms. I tasted them and they tasted like they were from a can. If they were not canned, then they were terribly prepared. 

I ordered crab cakes (lump) that came with a side of a spicy mayo sauce, some sort of corn mix and chef&#39;s potatoes.  The dinner also came with soup or salad. I chose the soup which was shrimp bisque.  

The soup was sort of odd. It did not taste like any bisque I&#39;ve had before. 

The crab cakes were mushy.  Mushy to the point where I was questioning if they were frozen. You expect lump crab cakes to have lumps of crab not what appeared to be shredded crab.  The flavor was ok but the texture of the cakes just threw everything off.  It reminded me The side of corn blend did not mix at all with the flavor of the crab cakes. 

I dropped $70 (minus tip) on an ok petite filet with horrible mushrooms, mushy crab cakes and 2 soft drinks (which were $3.00 a piece).  Which by the way, neither of us finished eating. 

The pricing of the food does not in any way match the quality.

It is a treat for us to go out to dinner, and not something we can do often. I rarely complain, but the service was horrible and food was just okay. Our waitress, Christina, apparently is a family member of the owner. We ordered the ribeye for two which was very fatty. Our drinks were watered down, and the baked potato was cold.   Even the dessert tasted old and not fresh. The salad and coffee were good, however, but that&#39;s it. I feel more than anything we were shocked at the poor service and how ignored we were. Took forever to order drinks and to get our food. After dinner we were totally ignored and it took an hour to get a dessert. I told Christina, the waitress, when she finally walked by to just forget the dessert. She ignored me and then brought it. Most disappointing of all was that the waitress added her gratuity to the bill which was well over 20%. I usually tip very well, but after such poor service this would have been one of those times I&#39;d like to control the percentage. As we were leaving I asked the hostess if it was customary for a waitress to add the gratuity for a party of just 2? She said, no it is only done for large parties, which I understood. I asked to speak to the owner and the hostess went to get him. She returned saying that even though he was there, he was too busy. Guess he was cooking. ??? Needless to say, we will not return, and I would strongly advise you not to give your business to them.

We&#39;d passed this place many times before and completely overlooked it.  So glad that has changed.

We loved the decor and they had quite a bit of holiday decorations mixed in as well - but not in a tacky way.  It blended well and looked very festive yet elegant.  They have a big fireplace was crackling, twinkle lights above with exposed beams...just lovely.  The perfect location for date night or a special occasion.  They have at least one private room for larger parties or events.

The only thing I felt they could improve upon (and partly why I&#39;m holding back that 5th star) is the music.  The music simply didn&#39;t fit with the ambiance of the establishment.  I love Classic Rock but based on the type of restaurant it is and how it&#39;s more of an upscale place it just didn&#39;t go together for me.  The place seems more like they should have some Dean Martin supper-club-esque type of music playing rather than CCR.

Our server was Bill and he was such a pleasure.  Just the right amount of graciousness and fun with humor.

The food did not disappoint, either.  We both had the special, a steak dish (I forget the name), and it was so tender and delicious.  Plenty of mushrooms &amp; sauteed onions in the delicious sauce as well...and the mashed potatoes!  Oh the mashed potatoes!  The creamy, buttery, heavenly potatoes were so elegantly presented piped around the platter with a large star tip.  It looked too pretty to eat but of course we devoured it!  The portion was also large, we both took leftovers home and will get at least one more meal each out of it.  Even the calamari we ordered was enough to feed at least 4 people as an appetizer.

We will definitely be going back and just may become our new fave for dinner!"st-charles-place-st-charles-2,Christine M.,c_aK3aPtgquXQriubpaLQQ,"Dundee Township, IL",0,1,0,0,2,DgTYEI2HNcyqlouam-ZL8A,1,05/08/15,"Well the music was very loud and made talking to our 6 was not easy we asked to have it turned down.  That was a joke. The wait staff was a nightmare inattentive at best. Asking for water refills and getting a look then taking their time. We need ice teas refilled, they filled it with to much ice and very little tea and never asked if we needed more everywhere, else  I have gone for steaks at: Ruth&#39;s Chris, Mortons, Gene and Georgetti&#39;s-Chicago the service impeccable. The staff would show up briefly serve us and disappear. This restaurant needs to send the wait staff for appropriate training. The food was not up to par. I had the steak salad there was bad lettuce I asked the waitress to take it back and I was told that&#39;s the lettuce mix we have its fine. I know bad lettuce it has a smell and is very wilted. Others had fish, prime rib and filets none of us were happy with the meal. The flaming cheese was not the appropriate Greek cheese.

I only came here because I had an expiring groupon that I needed to use. I&#39;ve driven by this place numerous times and never knew it existed. It looks so old school and dark from the outside. Should probably revamp the place up. But I guess they are going for the old school feel since the inside atmosphere makes you feel like you&#39;re going back in time. The lighting is so dim though, and that was so annoying. 

Food was crazy expensive. For 2 people with no drinks, just 2 meals, the total ended up being $75....whoa.  My steak was alright, not worth the 32 dollar list price. My companion got the 32 dollar scallops, and yes they were big, and I understand it is seafood, but there were only 4 of them. That equates to about 8 dollars a scallop. 7 maybe if you include the mashed potatoes in there. 

My biggest complaint had to be about the service though. No offense to the guy that was waiting out table, but he was so slow. Like crazy slow. He gave us bread and never asked if we wanted more. Maybe they don&#39;t give you more, but who knows, I wouldn&#39;t since he didn&#39;t say anything. I barely got my water refilled, and that was even through a different guy, bus boy type person. The waiter gave us our food, and never came back to ask if we were doing fine or needed anything. Maybe just one time throughout the meal when obviously I was short on water like the whole time.

 Then when we finished( I literally timed this part since we were trying to catch a movie at the nearby theater), it took 40 minutes from when I asked for the check to us leaving. Like I&#39;m just speechless. The place was not packed, so what could he have possibly been doing.

He came back when we were done and  I said we were finished and if we could have the check and a take home container. 10 min goes by, he comes back with a take home container. Another 10 minutes go by, he comes back with the check. Another 10 min goes by, he takes my credit card. Final 10 minutes go by, he gives me my card back. Ended up missing the beginning of the movie too. Not too happy with that."st-charles-place-st-charles-2,Robert M.,_ukDzO9MVuMHZdJcSfSkuQ,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,3,32,m4K6749kV03dsO5njiKp5Q,1,03/02/13,"So I ate here tonight to help celebrate a friend of mine&#39;s birthday. We were early for our reservation, but we&#39;re sent to the bar. There were plenty empty tables to be seen. Took to long for drinks, then our appts took just as long. We had salads coming, but the time between the appts and salad again was long.
When our dinners came, the Ribeye was over cooked, but the owner was fast in replacing. I had the Lobster Club, looked good, the bread really wasn&#39;t a good match. But there was plenty of lobster.

The decor was all over the board. You really couldn&#39;t figure out what they were trying to say.

It was my first time there. Don&#39;t think it will be on my list for a second dinning. Disappointing experience from the moment we walked in he door. Hostess who we later found out was the wife of the owner. Was less than welcoming when we walked in.

I normally order the filet, and it&#39;s always cooked perfectly.  Part of the reason why this restaurant is appealing is that you know you&#39;ll get a good meal no matter what you order, so it&#39;s an easy option when you can&#39;t think of anywhere else to go.  It&#39;s especially nice when it&#39;s a weekend night and you don&#39;t have reservations anywhere else in town (where a lot of restaurants are overcrowded due to lack of quality options in the St. Charles area).

Sherri recommended a very nice wine and then let us order a Steak Diane which she was happy to split for us and without an argument.

I believe in writing quality and not quantity.  As a Restaurateur, I also only believe in writing Yelp reviews for places that I am moved by in some way.  St. Charles Place (SCP) moved me.

True Story: 1 American, 2 Italians, 2 Swiss, 3 South Africans, 1 Dutchman, 1 Belgian, 1 Turk, 1 Mexican, 1 Austrian were in the city of St. Charles for the next few weeks and wanted to celebrate an occasion - they looked online on Yelp and found St. Charles Place, to celebrate and made RSVPs.

Prior to arriving, I reviewed the web-site and was so pleasantly surprised that SCP catered to a variety of tastes.  The menu was fairly extensive in my opinion and had some very classic offerings for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.

When we arrived at SCP, I was impressed at the sheer enormousness of the place.  The current web-site does not do justice to the size of this place.  If you are looking for a place for any-sized celebration, SCP can definitely accommodate.  My group was greeted by a friendly man, by the name of Thomas - came to find out that he was the Executive Chef and Owner.  Very down to earth and funny, with a little bit of Chicago moxie mixed in.

We walked through a crowded main dining room at 8:00 pm, to the back of the restaurant, with our own private dining area.  Then appeared the goddess Athena herself, as our waitress.  Our waitress, was very friendly and commanded a very pleasant demeanor which was great for our unruly international contingent.  Owning a restaurant, I was impressed, that only 1 waitress was assigned to our table, as I observed a full team in action at the vast restaurant.

We put in our drink orders, a couple of red wines, some martinis, imported beers and a coca-cola classic for me, the party animal.

Then came the really fun part - ordering.  I ordered 5 appetizers for the motley crue.  Didn&#39;t really need too, as SCP serves so much food.  Warm bread and butter is delivered to the table and the main entrees usually come with a house salad or soup and a side.  Seriously, SCP, is not frugal in anyway.

For starters, I ordered the Coconut crusted shrimp, Goat cheese bruschetta, Maryland crab cake, Calamari and Garlic Bread.  I was so in love with the dipping sauce that the Coconut crusted shrimp came with, that I practically confiscated the sauce and told everyone that if I couldn&#39;t have all of it, that I would start an international incident at the restaurant - the look in my eyes meant that I was serious; hence, my international team allowed me to eat most of the sauce - it was phenomenal - a raspberry reduction with a hint of wasabi or horseradish.

I need to pause here to comment on the decor.  I loved it.  High vaulted ceilings with a woodsy lodge theme, with trees growing inside the restaurants, that were decorated with tiny white lights.  Gave it a rustic romantic charm.  Perfect for a date or a very nice evening with a bunch of hooligans like us.

For main entrees, the ladies ordered their demur dishes, like vegetarian pastas or fish dishes; however, for most of us, we ordered carnivorous dishes.  I ordered the Canadian Baby Back Ribs.  When my order came out, I thought, that they were surely mistaken, because my dish was huge - enough for two people and only at $23????  Surely, there was some mistake; however, the person across from me got the same and hers was just as big.  We could not stop laughing in awe on the portion size.  And the most memorable aspect of my dish was the sauce.  What is it with this place and the sauces???   They are phenomenal.  I am not ashamed to say this, I ate very primitively and with my hands and had sauce all over my mouth and literally licked the shot of sauce that came with my already drenched ribs - the sauce was that good.  I woke up this morning still thinking about it.

After dinner, the crew ordered desserts and coffees as well as after dinner drinks like Frangelico.  The mousse and turtle pie were good.

What made the experience really memorable was the hospitality.  I told the waitress how much fun we were having and she liked hearing that.  Later, I can&#39;t remember how it was disclosed, but it turned out our waitress was part owner and the sister-in-law of Thomas, the Executive Chef.  Shortly before we closed our tab, Thomas came over to our table and chatted with us briefly.  I thanked him for a wonderful time and told him his food was awesome.

Being a restaurateur, I know what it takes to run a restaurant.  It is not for the faint hearted.  The glamor, glitz and lifestyle that you think we restaurateurs have, is just a very nice romantic allusion.  The truth is, that it is a lifestyle that we have chosen and one that we are committed too.  Thomas and his team are obviously committed as well, given the top notch non-elitist service that we were afforded.

We closed the restaurant down and Thomas chatted with us while we were waiting for the taxis.  2 words - Magnanimous &amp; Charismatic.

We ordered the Chateaubriand special for two at $30 per person. This entre was served in a huge canoe shaped dish with loads of vegetables including parmisian stuffed tomatoes, roasted red and green peppers, mashed potatoes, whole green beans and asparagus. 

We each had eaten one slice of meat when I realized there were only 2 slices of meat remaining. I discovered the meat was resting on several slices of french bread which I assume was to absorb the excess juice or possibly mask the small meat portion. By then it was too late to discuss with management.

Also, there was nothing noteworthy or creative about the preparation of the Chateaubriand. I could have done at least as well at home.

We liked several other aspects of St Charles Place: linen table cloths, quality utencils, decor and ambiance, room between tables. The Maryland Lump Crabcake at $13 was very tasty except it was not lump crab, unless it was shredded lump crab. Our search continues for extraordinary crab cakes like The Capitol Grill in Lombard. 

My Hendricks martini at $10 was very good with large bleu cheese olives. (I know I should be asking for cucumber with Hendricks, but I like bleu cheese olives.) Only 2 Cabernets were offered by the glass. the top of the line was only $10, good wine and a generous pour.

Well when it comes to Mexican food, I&#39;m guessing the locals eat at Original Tacos.  The prices are reasonable, the food is tasty and English is NOT the primary language spoken by the wait staff. :-)  I had heard about this place from a friend of mine when we were telling them about Taco el Norte and raving about how authentic is was.  My friend mentioned that this place was good and I figured I&#39;d give it a try.  The guacamole was good, the salsa was spicy (but not too much) and my ground beef macho burrito was more than I could finish. (Maybe because i also got a side of rice and beans.)  The co-worker I came with also got the macho burrito, but his had shredded beef and he said he&#39;d make a point to go out of his way to eat at this place again.

My order was done and ready to go in about 6 minutes. I was very impressed with the size of my meal but the food didnt wow me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoyed and liked my meal but I wish I would have ordered the tacos. I got a cheese, a steak and a chicken enchilada.

It was my first time trying out the tacos here. And it wasn&#39;t all that great.

I ordered 3 chicken tacos and 3 fish tacos for pick up. They gave me about 5-10 minutes so it was pretty quick in terms of cooking. 

Each taco comes with lettuce, onion, cilantro upon your request. It&#39;s about the size of your hand as for the portion. 

Chicken taco was quite disappointing to say the least. Chicken was very dry and overcooked as it became harder to eat without pouring a load of salsa that came with the order. 

Fish taco was better however. It was a fried cod filet that also appeared to be overcooked. It had a dark brown coating which showed sign of being left in the fryer for too long. 

I paid about 13 dollars for 6 tacos, but I felt like I didn&#39;t get what I paid for in terms of quality. Good thing I was at least hungry.

This review is solely on the tacos so I can&#39;t say much about other things on the menu.

I ordered there once and that was enough to completely and utterly turn me off from this place forever. I ordered steak nachos and steak tacos, a standard order for me when trying out a new Mexican joint. I was so disappointed when I opened the container filled with oddly chopped tomatoes and onions and a sprinkle of meat. I gagged at first bite and nearly choked to death because the meat was so damn dry. I immediately regretted the decision to skip the horchata. I wish I could describe how bland the meat tasted but I can&#39;t describe a flavor that wasn&#39;t there... THERE WAS NO FLAVOR, which frightened me...
The tacos had all the fixings that should have made them bomb and a hit right off the bat, but of course life couldn&#39;t be so rewarding, I nearly choked again. Trying my hardest I swallowed and tried to find the flavor...again it was missing...
I hate the waste of time and money and I wouldn&#39;t wish this devastatingly disappointing restaurant on my worst enemy...not even a LAPD cop...

I had something interesting...  A Hawaiian Burrito.  BBQ Sauce, Steak (or Chicken), pineapple, refried beans, rice, lettuce, and perhaps a few other odds and ends.   It was nice sized, and certainly a unique taste.   Encouraging enough to try them again, but likely not for another Hawaiian burrito.

I was greeted the moment I walked in, &amp; even though I was ordering to go, I was offered a glass of their homemade chia water. It was sooo delicious that I added it to my togo order. I ordered the Picaditas, which were super yummy!! They had a great flavor &amp; the homemade tortilla like things was wonderful. Everything tasted fresh. Next time I will eat in on their patio!

I cant wait to bring my husband here sometime on the weekend to try one of their pozole de Guerrero."la-cocina-de-maria-west-chicago,Jacqueline B.,zKY6NM9CxxWxcY5JJXUB7g,"Aurora, IL",1,1,1,2351,1,#NAME?,4,28/06/16,"My friends down the street at Kindred Coffee suggested the tacos over at La Cocina de Maria, so naturally I took them up on this suggestion when I was in the area last Saturday.

I was a tad confused when I walked in, because I didn&#39;t really see a menu or counter to order at. Once someone saw my confusion I was helped and given a to-go menu to look at. I was lucky enough to see fellow Yelper Osiris V. dining in, so she let me try a bite of her food -- a fried quesadilla (not sure of the real name) and pambazo. Both were really good! The pambazo sandwich was ginormous --you can definitely split it between 2 (or maybe even 3) people!

I had tacos on the brain, so I ended up ordering 2 chicken tacos (classic style, not American), 2 carne tacos, and a chorizo quesadilla to split with the hubbie. I wanted water to go and at first was upset because I didn&#39;t see any water bottles in the cooler, but then they offered up some pretty delicious options! They brought out two adorable tea cups for me to try their chia seed water and hibiscus water. Both were delicious and refreshing! I decided to go with the hibiscus water and ordered a large. It&#39;s to be noted that a large size drink is a GINORMOUS beverage (think big gulp style) that basically kept me hydrated the whole rest of the day.

Of course I&#39;m sure my food would have been even better if I dined in as opposed to bringing it home, but I still really enjoyed the tacos! The steak tacos were my absolute favorite and I thought the chicken tacos were just okay. The chorizo quesadilla was really good too but extremely greasy. I love that they gave me sour cream, limes, and three different kinds of salsa to go with my meal. I thought the red salsa was very good and it had a nice kick to it!

For all this food it cost me about $16 which was well worth the authentic Mexican taste!

I had the Gyros Pak which includes a gyros sandwich with Tzatziki, onions and tomatoes, a side of fries and a soda.  The fries were good.  The sandwich was good.  However, the gyros and tzatziki didn&#39;t have enough flavor to them.  Don&#39;t get me wrong.  it was good but not great.

I appreciated that they had sweet potato fries, but thought they could use more salt (which I just added at the table anyway).

The sauce comes on the sandwich already so if you want it on the side you have to be specific. The fries were just ok, very similar to Burger King fries (the sort of battered, crispy kind). Pretty good...pretty good."skippys-gyros-south-elgin,Rich B.,3x4Lr75KuW8IV498Z5mtWA,"Carpentersville, IL",0,1,0,0,12,dK9GkKCQ3FriEHzjmcwfwg,1,03/09/14,"I stopped in Skippy&#39;s today in South Elgin. I have not been there in a while. I use to see the special board with the prices on it for the specials . They did not have the prices there. Are you kidding me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wherever you go to any fast food place they have prices for the specials. For example ( beef, fries and a coke $8.49). I asked the person where are the special combinations with the prices. She said they don&#39;t have them posted, I will tell you how much it is. Are you kidding me!!!!!!!!!!!! I asked how much for the gyros meal and she told me. How much for the beef meal and she told me. How much for the cheeseburger meal and she told me. Are you kidding me!!!!!!!!!!! Most people want to see the combinations and their prices to decide what they want to get. Maybe I don&#39;t want the gyros for $9.69, maybe instead I want the cheeseburger for $ 6.69. I cannot believe they don&#39;t have the prices for the specials listed That is nuts and stupid. I almost walked out, but I wanted their gyros special. I had to ask her for 5 different combination prices and then forgot what she said. I cannot believe this would not bother anybody by ordering something and not caring about the price. I know they have always been high prices their, but not having prices showing the cost and not even offering me the receipt. Plus they sometimes seem rude there. As I left I saw the bus boy put the napkins I did not use back in his pocket,  maybe he put them back in the mix with the other clean napkins.  Anyway I definitely will never step foot in there again. The gyros was good though but no at that cost. I hope  they put the special prices back up there for their customers to see or just go in and order any special and don&#39;t worry about their cost."skippys-gyros-south-elgin,Jerry B.,m5f_4gLrRFN7oCgs08bj4w,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,6,81,TsG9UBhzPZbreu2wO91Ztg,5,10/10/13,get the battered mac &amp; cheese wedges!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they are s00000000 good!!!!!!!!skippys-gyros-south-elgin,Paul W.,ovMMt6mxnTellDwKVzhNSA,"South Elgin, IL",0,1,0,2,4,uZ1WARce8xBqG6z13htaqA,4,29/05/12,Great atmosphere and pretty good food.

Great quality, huge portions, and in a very clean environment, Skippy&#39;s has discovered a niche in fast-food Greek style.  The Gyros are their signature sandwich -- one of the best!!!  The Chicken Rice soup is a must have each time I visit.  The restaurant in South Elgin is a Wendy&#39;s converted into very nice fast-food environment.

Super tasty, huge portions, and clean. I don&#39;t feel all greased up or messy when I&#39;m eating these gyros and I love it. I think it&#39;s in the way they assemble them and wrap them. 

The place itself is a huge step up from typical gyro joints. It&#39;s extraordinarily clean, well decorated, and sporting 3 flat panel TVs. The middle one is usually on the Disney channel and the other 2 are on sports. Skippy&#39;s is awesome, I love taking friends here for a bite and they&#39;ve been impressed."skippys-gyros-south-elgin,Ramsin B.,Q3LokcKH-GK4HMyQo8aLuw,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,0,2,51,hoOG3oarJgVClvPxYwqEaQ,5,24/09/14,"heard the original owner sold their shop on lake street and opened this location. i moved to vegas about 12 years ago, but this was my spot when i did live in hanover park. the brothers were always courteous every time me and my family stepped into the joint, our food was more then reasonably priced (at least back then) and they literally had THE best gyros in town. 12 years later i still get urges for this place, and would take a gyros combo extra sauce as my last meal on earth. EAT HERE!  no chicago trip will ever be complete in my life if i dont eat here at least once every day when i am in chicago."skippys-gyros-south-elgin,Frank C.,cfI2MhaDt9Gz3bhrcwf2lg,"Sturgeon Bay, WI",0,1,0,2,189,0QBNyLAW9BkGmRfBPGHo_A,4,13/08/08,"Skippy&#39;s gyros are excellent!  Get the King Gyros if you&#39;re *really* hungry.

The italian beef sandwiches are very tasty (not Portillo&#39;s but close), they have curly fries (YAY!), and the burgers are quite good as well.  Top it all off with a lemon Italian ice and I&#39;m a happy camper. :-)

We&#39;ve never had a bad meal here...everything&#39;s always hot, fresh, tasty.

They&#39;re open until 9 most Monday-Saturday, 7 on Sundays.

Skippy&#39;s took over the old &#34;Wendy&#39;s&#34; that failed, and what a difference!"skippys-gyros-south-elgin,Paul M.,XrFCag4AMW5qta9QXokWPA,"Saint Louis, MO",0,1,0,26,331,#NAME?,4,08/04/09,"I&#39;ve had many gyros on multiple continents and I have to say these are among the best.  Pay the extra for the feta cheese and you won&#39;t be disappointed.  Huge portion of tasty meat leaves nobody hungry.  Can&#39;t wait for my next visit.

I wish I had a Skippy&#39;s nearby.  St Louis really needs a franchise near the downtown with late hours.

Skippy&#39;s is alright, but it&#39;s far from the best gyros (as far as the TriCity area, Mr. Beef trumps them with their lack of drive thru and rude service, still better).  Their prices are on par with similar joints, but they dice the tomato (not traditional) and the meat is just okay.  The cheese for cheese fries, gross-- it&#39;s like hot yellow.  The fries and chicken gyro also aren&#39;t all that.  I will give them props for th Italian Ice and also variety of flavors they offer, but the food is decent, not as good as Munchie P&#39;s for burgers or Portillo&#39;s for beefs.  They do everything alright but nothing that well.  Sorry Skippy&#39;s...just not that into you!"skippys-gyros-south-elgin,Michael D.,T4Q6jjRKc7MmUxFyCt2Kzw,"Elgin, IL",0,1,0,12,467,SJkx12Uc3vQfTFuqGnzBeA,5,05/02/10,"I can honestly say Skippys helped me gain 20lbs when I moved back to the area.  Over time I was able to battle my addictions and I am happy to say that today, I am down to one Chicken Gyro every two weeks.  That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t still indulge in their Lamb Gyros, Italian Sausage or Mega Beef.  Special mention should be made to the Italian Ice.  If you really want to keep the party going, ask for a tub of cucumber sauce to go.... yes, they sell it by the pint, to go.... with you....home....I use it in my morning coffee."skippys-gyros-south-elgin,Angela P.,n1CqciOR8SCDt3c39eXe2w,"Villa Park, IL",0,1,0,364,6,KQNGFpFJ3aHlgtFPTL0Paw,4,09/03/08,"This is our local favorite gyros&#39; place.  We have gone here a few times and have never been disappointed!  We have now introduced my sister and brother-in-law to it and they loved it too!  We always get the gyros, and I get mine with grilled onions and they get it right every time!  We also get the cheese fries which are okay and yesterday I finally got a side of their oven roasted potatoes which were EXCELLENT!!  They, of course, have a bunch of other items like souvlaki, spinach pie, pizza puffs, burgers, steak sandwiches...pretty much everything.  And you can either go through the drive-through, order inside to take it to go or eat there where they have plenty of clean seats.  You&#39;ve just gotta try it!

**Also while I was waiting to take my order to go, I saw the cook making a ribeye steak sandwich and the steak looked SO good that I think I may have to try one next time!**

***One last thing...I saw that there were a few reviews for a Skippy&#39;s Gyros on Lake St. in Roselle (http://www.yelp.com/biz/skippys-gyros-roselle-2)  and I looked it up on manta.com, which is apparently a website about businesses and their information, and it said that this one has only been started since 2006 and I have seen that other one on Lake St. for a long time, so from what I found they are not related.

My boyfriend and I frequent both locations but tend to go to third street more just because it&#39;s bigger and you aren&#39;t sitting on top of the people next to you. 

The servers are great and always make a point to say hello and remember us when we go. They are attentive and are very staffed which is great because the service is fast even when they are busy. They are all so friendly and you can tell they enjoy their job- which I can&#39;t say about most servers in most restaurants. 

The food is great! Best tacos I&#39;ve ever had- and Definitely the best tacos in Geneva! I like the al pastor! The esquites is delicious !!!! Their margaritas are fantastic! I get different ones every time I&#39;m there- and I can&#39;t tell you which one is my favorite- because they are all so good! We always get pineapple guacamole as an appetizer too- it&#39;s always delicious and super fresh! 

This place is definitely our date spot on the weekend and we go to the Main Street location on Sunday afternoons a lot when it&#39;s not so busy. 

I would highly recommend this place!! It will not disappoint and is consistently great!"el-molcajete-geneva-2,Matt S.,GvZmTVEgMPisdhizap-Uxw,"Georgetown, SC",0,1,0,0,12,FXgnvwniTp2KERZ358mcJw,4,16/09/16,"What a great place! All the dishes we ate were delicious and all with their own flair.

Oops it was dishwater and bleach. But they took it away and offered a free ice tea. It took 21 minutes to get tea and chips and salsa.
The taco sample was good but not for $13.95. Portion was small and on super small corn tortillas.
Don&#39;t recommend this to anyone. It&#39;s better if you go out of business and let someone else in.

I&#39;m getting sick from the dishwater drink already."el-molcajete-geneva-2,Olivia B.,6NQAoeUgsxoAr31NVJGxTw,"Geneva, IL",1,1,1,174,81,MEDZj7EGlqFGpcV7K46F0w,2,05/02/16,"I&#39;m not really sure what happened here but the term hot mess comes to mind. We came for restaurant week, which was a great deal...2 margaritas, chips and guac, 2 taco plates (each with a side), and a dessert for $39. 

But with every table filled and only one waitress running around, we were often forgotten. 2 other tables that got seated after us had their orders taken before us. Our chips and guac arrived before we even had waters. The waitress was very nice whenever she would come by but she just needed more help! 

Overall food was fine but not great. The chips were really greasy and had no salt. All the food was delivered with nice presentation and we did agree the meal was very pretty. We also both loved our margaritas. Mango &amp; Blackberry, yum!

Also, the interior was surprisingly nice considering the berry houses are a bit...run down, if you will. But the lighting was super bright and it didn&#39;t feel very intimate or cozy. The music was really quiet and we could easily hear neighboring conversations.

This is a unique deep fried taco which is hard to find at most Mexican restaurants. The people at the other location claim they will make it for you, but I tried asking for it and they had no clue what I was talking about.  Also the lunch menu is not offered. Even though I think the portions are a little big for lunch you can certainly take something home and at least you will get filled up.  Please don&#39;t let my nit pickiness deter you from experiencing this stellar establishment. In my review of the other location I describe the available menu items in more detail which are available here. Unlike the other location a beautiful outside patio is available for dining el fresco.  Despite the fact that an elevator is available the second floor location will be a little challenging for someone who has mobility issues.

Service is so slow and they seem to have many servers there so not sure what is going on. Took a long time to get out drinks and then just as long for chips and salsa. I ordered the Mole Enchiladas and they were DeLisH. My friend ordered shrimp tacos and was very happy with the dish. 
Second visit :
Walked in for fried ice cream and horchatas and we told the hostess this. She said ok she would tell our server. We proceed to sit outside and the server comes out greets us and we repeat what we are there for. We order our stuff and minutes go by and still no drinks or even water. Still waiting .......
The Manager ( I assumed because she had to come explain) comes and apologizes they have no ice cream.  She offers ,the only dessert available , the Flan. At this point we are annoyed cause it took so long to be informed of all of this!! I guess the the server had no clue they were out of the ice cream that the only available dessert  was the Flan!? I tell the manager it&#39;s ok we will still take our drinks. Another 10 minutes go by still no water and still no rice waters. We finally decide to get up and grab our rice waters to go.  I walk up to hostess stand and server still had no drinks made for us. They were kind enough to give us the one drink on the house.

I liked the food at the smaller shop on main street and thought I would try the 3rd street restaurant. First of all the menu online was not updated and the those prices were two to three dollars less than the published menu inside. When I told the hostess she just said sorry. Which is fine, but it shows a total lack of communication between the staff and the management. I was going to stay for a drink while I was waiting for my food, the prices were just too outrageous for alcohol. So I went down the street to grab a beer and wait for my takeout. When I picked it up I knew I was in for trouble because for three tortas my bag was way too light . Especially for the money.

The patio is nice and it was great catching up with our friends- without those items, I would have likely walked out and given my money to other quality places within a few steps away.

Great patio, great food, just needs a little time to evolve.  You can tell this place opened on a shoestring budget:  terrible, small tables that probably came from Menards or Target...way too small for mor than two diners.  No decor at all, except for the super bright, obnoxious neon &#34;open&#34; sign on the patio.  
Getting past that, all was great.  It won&#39;t take long for this awesome patio spot to be filled every night, so get there while you can.    Quiet enough to have a conversation with your guests.
