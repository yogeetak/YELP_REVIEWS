Very sad since I&#39;m a huge fan.. I ordered a large boneless meal for carry out and specifically asked for extra sauce.  
When I got home, I was sorely disappointed to find that not only was there NOT extra sauce, it was even less than you would normally expect.
I called over to speak with the manager who never apologized. He said the amount of sauce was relative which is bonkers considering my wings were bone dry.  He offered to make another batch for me but this was completely inconvenient for me as I had plans for the rest of the evening.  An offer for a future discount, a coupon, even a simple apology would have sufficed..

Took at least 20 min just to get some drinks and when the drinks came they weren&#39;t what we ordered. When reanne asked if we were ready to order we replied yes after taking our order she replied with there is a long wait for food over 25 minutes minimum. After taking our order she never returned to ask if we needed anything else. About 30 minutes later she returned with the food dropped it off and and about 10 minutes later she came with the checks saying &#34;take your time no rush.&#34; 5 minutes after that while still eating she asks if we had the payment ready. Seemed pretty rushed to me. Anyways I wish I could rate it below 1 star but it&#39;ll have to do won&#39;t be returning to this location ever which is unfortunate seeing as it is so close to home.buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Irena R.,1_HDOuUKmWg2yDbSkNKsGg,"Glendale Heights, IL",1,1,0,103,7,OOD0BRBs7AvFIpKKGUw_qg,2,15/05/16,"One dollar for a traditional wing.

This was my second time at the Bloomingdale location. Our waitresses name was Reanne. We came in at 11:00 pm on the 27th of September. We sat our table for twenty minutes no one came to ask if we&#39;d like drinks, after we got our drinks Reanne kept telling us that it would be a long wait for food. Which was fine we told her that was ok. We didn&#39;t get our food for maybe 25 minutes which was ok. During that entire 25 minutes she did not stop by once to ask if we would like refills. After we got our food she disappeared and did not come back at all for another 20 minutes and then just to give us our checks. Then she came back five minutes later asking if we&#39;re ready for the bill. At the point we were still not done eating and hadn&#39;t gotten our refills. I understand that it gets busy and it gets stressful sometimes. But we were very patient and respectful and we got really crappy service because it seemed like Reanne was just focused on going home. Not acceptable."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Jackie H.,xPrk-iDVXTe6uFAKUIzQiA,"Glenview, IL",1,1,0,20,5,Myvl-pPIxvARc7cGR9hKiQ,1,24/06/16,"Literally the worst service I have experienced. Came last night at 7 PM on a boneless Thursday night, which I realize means the place is busier than usual, but what happened to my group is just unacceptable. We were seated and ordered our drinks immediately, and about 5 minutes later placed our orders, so far, so good. Then an hour later, our food still hasn&#39;t come. It is now approximately 8 PM. Our waitress did not come check on us or update us at all during that hour. Finally someone who was not our waitress delivered our wings to us by basically throwing them on the table, and then quickly turns around and walks off. At this point we are starving, and look at our table and realize... We have no napkins and no silverware. So we hope that our waitress will come by soon so we can ask for some. She walked by our table several times and we were unsuccessful in waving her down. We also tried to get the attention of other servers, who looked is DIRECTLY in the eye, and then did not stop and ask what we needed. I also did not see a manager during this time, if I had I would have attempted to get their attention. So finally, FIFTEEN minutes later, we get the attention of our waitress who brings us silverware a few minutes later. By now our food is cold, but whatever, we were starving. Halfway through eating our waitress does check on us, and she says she will bring us more water. That never happened. We finish and ask for boxes and our checks. Checks come, we pay, but no boxes. We wait another 20 minutes before we are able to flag someone down to get us boxes. Food was good, service was awful."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Erick A.,0VDfzAJmCSSoEoB0EZAunQ,"Streamwood, IL",0,1,0,6,14,2lLUvVBj-AUTPYbh25ORbA,5,20/07/16,"We live in the middle of 2 Buffalo Wild Wings &amp; always wonder on which one to choose, but by FAR this one is our favorite!

First, we were waiting over 20 minutes to be seated and they gave our table to someone else instead and we needed to waiting longer, the waiter was not the best and honestly was not very smart. They messed up from friends order. And our appetizer. 

When you trying to apply for a bdubs staff position, there is an online math and reading test but I swear that there are not many people that seem to have a brain that would at this location, or bdubs in general. I will not be going to this location ever again.. bad service is a bad experience.

Every single time we have gotten wings the last year, we&#39;ve had to tell them to put more on so the wings were just barely covered.

This last time, the employee tried to not even let me look at the wings before we left, almost as if she already knew it was going to be an issue.

To add to the cheapness, they&#39;ve apparently determined that a side of fries should consist of less than a half cup.

I once ordered the ghost pepper wings (and just so you know, they are freaking HOT!  omg...everyone says they have hot wings but they are pikers next to this)...and that woman brought the wings and then disappeared forever.

Clean and food comes relatively quickly.  Manager once made me the off-menu Buffalo Grilled Cheese sandwich upon request, it was delicious (from spring 2014, bring it back) and much appreciated.

Staff might need to be updated on the day&#39;s sporting events as I&#39;ve gotten a dear-in-headlights response to a couple of NCAA football requests. Staff also tends to disappear on occasion, which is not great when you have two kids who keep dropping silverware.

I know some people like to player hate on chains, but I honestly have never quite understood that whole mentality. Does the fact that a restaurant is a chain somehow diminish it by default? Perhaps in the alternate universe some wanna be hipster operates under it does, but to those of us who objectively embrace reality, food and experience is the same no matter if it&#39;s a Mom and Pop joint or if they are rocking 1000 units coast to coast. Ok, stepping off the soap box. 

If you have been to any other &#34;B-dubs&#34; location (and unless you have been living under a rock the last decade, chances are you have), you will find many aspects instantly familiar. They have wall-to-wall flat screens that put most sports bars to shame. BWW is very popular with fantasy football followers for this very reason alone. There are not too many places where you can swivel 360 degrees in your chair and get every single live NFL game on Sunday afternoon. I have yet to enter a location that did not have NFL Sunday Ticket, and this location is no exception.  The last couple of years my fantasy football league draft was conducted from the bar stool of a BWW location. Another staple is UFC events, and all the PPW events are on tap here as well. This is actually quite handy if I am traveling. If there is a fight on I want to watch while I am on the road, I know that I can visit the closest location and get my fix. Even some po-dunk towns in the middle of nowhere have  BWW&#39;s these days. 

As to the food, wings are what you should go with here (surprise, surprise). They are always plump and succulent and are about the best you will find at any chain. They have sauce selections for days to accommodate just about any preference with &#39;Blazin&#39; being the hottest. I adore insanely hot food and it is a sauce that is pretty nuclear for a mass produced product. A BWW district manager once told me the sauce is in the 200,000-350,000 Scoville units of heat range. By contrast, Tabasco sauce is between 2500-5000. So, yeah....It is friggin HOT!  If I am not in the mood for wings, I also like the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich which has been on the menu at every location I have ever visited. You can also go bone out on wings and eat them with a fork if you are not wanting to get messy. BWW locations also will serve regional specialty items by location. For example, the location closest to me back in Wisconsin had deep fried cheese curds. 

Lastly, this is a good spot to grab a drink since the 20oz beers are reasonably priced.  This location has decent selection on tap with some local microbrews thrown into the mix to round things out. 

Overall, this location is a good option. Prices are cheap, the service is good, and they have all the &#34;man cave&#34; type of accompaniments that are typical of the chain."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Mark B.,Zs4v2spqvoa-O_AzfQ42bA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,11,36,wQD_pMlenwlbhwhS9_3CLg,4,07/02/15,"We came here for lunch and had an enjoyable time.

Decor: It&#39;s a B-Dubs, so no surprises. There are TONS of TVs... seriously, they are EVERYWHERE! But that&#39;s a good thing b/c it&#39;s a sports bar.
Bathroom: Again, standard for B-Dubs: clean, well lit, inviting.

Staff: The greeting staff was friendly and we only had to wait a short amount of time, which was cool. Our waitress was nice as well. She wasn&#39;t SUPER speedy, but she was doing a fine job and was very friendly.

Food/Drink: The food was, as par for B-Dubs, delicious. It was the highlight of the visit as it was hot and fresh and the sauce-to-wing ratio was fine - mine could have used another spin but my girlfriends were perfect.

Value: Prices are right where you would expect them to be.

I adore insanely hot food and it is a sauce that is pretty nuclear for a mass produced product. A BWW district manager once told me the sauce is in the 200,000-350,000 Scoville units of heat range. By contrast, Tabasco sauce is between 2500-5000. So, yeah....It is friggin HOT!  If I am not in the mood for wings, I also like the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich which has been on the menu at every location I have ever visited. You can also go bone out on wings and eat them with a fork if you are not wanting to get messy. BWW locations also will serve regional specialty items by location. For example, the location closest to me back in Wisconsin had deep fried cheese curds. 

Lastly, this is a good spot to grab a drink since the 20oz beers are reasonably priced.  This location has decent selection on tap with some local microbrews thrown into the mix to round things out. 

Overall, this location is a good option. Prices are cheap, the service is good, and they have all the &#34;man cave&#34; type of accompaniments that are typical of the chain."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Mark B.,Zs4v2spqvoa-O_AzfQ42bA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,11,36,wQD_pMlenwlbhwhS9_3CLg,4,07/02/15,"We came here for lunch and had an enjoyable time.

Decor: It&#39;s a B-Dubs, so no surprises. There are TONS of TVs... seriously, they are EVERYWHERE! But that&#39;s a good thing b/c it&#39;s a sports bar.
Bathroom: Again, standard for B-Dubs: clean, well lit, inviting.

Staff: The greeting staff was friendly and we only had to wait a short amount of time, which was cool. Our waitress was nice as well. She wasn&#39;t SUPER speedy, but she was doing a fine job and was very friendly.

Food/Drink: The food was, as par for B-Dubs, delicious. It was the highlight of the visit as it was hot and fresh and the sauce-to-wing ratio was fine - mine could have used another spin but my girlfriends were perfect.

Value: Prices are right where you would expect them to be.

We love B-Dubs and will always come back for more wings or to catch a game."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Laura S.,97U_W2DOSx3J6E_qpQEycQ,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,0,20,29,5q2XtSkIW7aofAhx4yURPA,4,07/07/15,"This is a chain restaurant, so you probably have a good idea what you&#39;re getting .

Unfortunately the traditional wings were slightly dry and overcooked, and the food came out very slow. Especially for 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon, which is just after the Saturday lunch rush.

I had the traditional wings. Half were covered with a limited edition, Salted Caramel sauce (which is just honey BBQ with a touch of caramel, and kosher salt) while the other half was covered in Caribbean Jerk sauce, which I knew I would like quite a bit.

I&#39;m glad, for one, they&#39;re experimenting with different kinds of sauce. The salted caramel was complex enough, and not too sweet (though my wife said it was too sweet for her tastes.)

The drumsticks were cooked well enough but the wings were a bit overcooked and stringy. We also grabbed the soft pretzels, which were good.

In addition, the food came out pretty slow (15-20 minutes), with no explanations from the wait staff. I also mysteriously got a drink refill I didn&#39;t ask for. :-p

The experience wasn&#39;t a deal-breaker for the future, but I&#39;m not particularly aching to go back either."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Sarah S.,U6URiVzGmhz294cPvS-2WA,"Roselle, IL",0,1,0,3,1,V_waNU-lUYu-qjsw87NJFw,4,30/06/16,The food was excellent but the service was not.

It usually takes only 10. When we were finished we asked to get the check and he wouldn&#39;t come back. Instead he was cleaning the tables and moping around!!! It took 15 minutes for him to come to get out check and come to get our card back. Isaac needs to be way faster and pay more attention to his work/job!!! Overall the wings were excellent!

Every server, bartender, guest experience champion, and manager seems to enjoy their job and dealing with customers.  They are always great at remembering me and my order!  This Buffalo Wild Wings definitely provides better service and more consistent food quality then other nearby locations, definitely my go-to B Dubs.

Food is always brought out quickly and hot!  Highly recommended.  They have multiple specials throughout the week, I myself come regularly on Mondays for their &#34;double punch&#34; Mondays.  (they have a lunch card that after 5 punches you get $5 off).

I definitely recommend this location if you have a taste for Wings, Fries, and other fried goodies!"buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Sharon G.,ewgfC5JX0tSKtHN66SGqiQ,"Wheaton, IL",0,1,0,0,7,#NAME?,1,31/03/16,"If I could give this place no stars, I would.  First we waited 15 min and no one even approached us as a server, bus person.  I finally asked a girl bussing tables who was our server.  Turns out the server didn&#39;t know we were his table, which was smack in the middle of the dining room.  I was with my two 8-yr-old children and we had just come back from a dr&#39;s appointment after a diagnosis for my daughter.  I thought it would be a nice treat.  Think not.  I ordered a prem. margarita, which was 99 % ice.  I called the server over to show him and he sent the manager over.  She said everything is premeasured, that&#39;s the margarita glass, so the rest has to be filled with ice.  I expressed my dissatisfaction and she asked if I&#39;d care for another with not so much ice,  I said fine.  We were served our dinner, two kids meals and I had the Med. salad. I&#39;ve been to Buffalo Wild Wings in Naperville and in Lombard, and the serving sizes were much smaller at this Bloomingdale location.  I asked for a carry-out box for my salad and the check.
In the meantime I was brought another margarita with less ice, of which I finished 1/2, and the check.  I come to find out they had charged me for the 2nd margarita I had sent back.  I spoke again to the manager and she said, oh, no, if you drink it, you have to pay for it.  I said there was hardly anything to drink and I thought you were bringing me another one with less ice.  I asked to speak to her manager.  He proceeded to tell me that &#34;by law&#34; they have to charge me for alcohol &#34;if I drank it.&#34;  I said I will pay for one, but not the other.  This was $10 we were arguing over.  The bill was 42 something and I handed him $40.  He asked me if I had paid my bill.  I told him I will give him $40 and nothing more.  He proceeded to tell me that he would call the police on me for not paying my bill.  I told him I am 59 yrs old with 2 adopted children who&#39;s worked in the court system  as a stenographer for over 30 yrs.  I handed him the remaining $2.42 cents and left.  I have never been so insulted in my 59 years on this earth.  Where has common sense gone?  Where has respect for the customer gone?  The place was dirty, the customer service horrible and the portions significantly less than other Buffalo Wild Wings.  

So Customer Beware.  Buffalo Wild Wings are independently owned and operated.  I would  think again before supporting the Bloomingdale location.

My husband and I ordered lots of wings on New Years eve with the Hot BBQ sauce, which is really hot for me, and ranch. I called early and made sure to double check that we would receive ranch with the wings. The woman on the phone assured me a few times that it would be in the bag. It ended up taking us almost a half hour to get to this BWW. My husband ran in and grabbed the bag and we headed home. When we sat down at our dinner table I realized that they had neglected to put even one cup of ranch into our bag. I was not about to waste another hour of my night to drive back for the ranch that the servers forgot to place in the bag, so I called BWW to see if they could give me a free credit of some ranches for my next visit.

I had to cycle through at least 3 girls who basically told me &#34;it&#39;s JUST ranch.&#34; and whined about how busy they are. When I&#39;m spending a decent amount of money on hot spicy wings, it&#39;s more than JUST ranch, and BWW is ALWAYS busy. They should have bags filled with silverware and ranch ready to go if they can&#39;t remember these items. I finally got a manager on the phone who I regretfully forgot to ask for his name, but was so flustered from the last 3 girls that I had to explain my situation to. I just wanted them to take my name so next time I wouldn&#39;t have to pay for ranch that I was shorted on this visit. The manager took my full name and address and told me he would send me a coupon for some free wings to compensate for my time and apologized. I told him I wasn&#39;t looking for free wings, but very much appreciated getting taken care of. 

It&#39;s been over a month and NO coupon or any mail has arrived at my house from BWW. I understand that it&#39;s JUST ranch, but service for customer&#39;s should be handled MUCH better than this. I will not be returning to this restaurant and will make sure everyone else that I know, many whom love BWW, will choose the Schaumburg branch or different restaurant altogether."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Jeff M.,Wc8I-gaHSKdu-kB9EDMWtA,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,0,0,16,zNVGlnVnAvrtEQBzBhvVxg,2,29/10/15,"I order from here a few times a month for lunch at work.  Always hit or miss.  Sometimes good sometimes bad, never great.  Do not ever order on Monday though.  Ordered 11 boneless hot always with extra sauce.  No sauce and wings were as hard as a rock like they were saved from Sundays football night and thrown in a microwave.  Completely disgusting!  Called and complained and manager said he was sending me a coupon for a free lunch.  Not sure if I even want to use it, have not received it yet anyways!

I have always loved buffalo wild wings but it does appear their quality is falling just like hooters did.  I am just waiting for the blue cheese to come out in a prepackaged container then I know it is time to look for another wing shop.

My hubby chose the Blazin sauce for his wings ( the hottest sauce in the wing sauce spectrum) and he was sweating after just eating one wing! Lol. The fries were good, tasted legit and fresh. 
This place is good for family and little kids. I even saw an infant in a baby carrier - but i wouldn&#39;t recommend that due to high noise level in this restaurant. The wait for food is long , though. The food will come out in about 30 minutes after placement of order .

(I know there&#39;s one day for boneless and one day for traditional but didn&#39;t know what was what). 

To figure this ish out I called them to ask..you know, why not?
Well, the girl on the phone was completely rude. I asked if there was a wing special today where they had 50 cent wings and she abruptly responded being all, &#34;Actually it&#39;s 60 cent wings&#34; WELL THEN! Take my dime, whatever.

After I hang up the phone with miss rude pants I had another question or two. I was wondering if the same deal applied to take out because some restaurants are weird like that. &#34;Oh you can have a discount on our food but only if you sit down&#34; Stupid. 

Well, I called to ask and she was rude yet again and responded like &#34;duh...&#34; but didn&#39;t actually say duh...you know what I mean. On the phone, I was in the middle of a sentence when she says &#39;please hold&#39; and puts me on hold...I was literally in the middle of talking. Was she even listening? 
So my friend places the order and I go to pick it up. I get to the cashier and I know from previous bdubs experience and friends working there that the person answering the phone is the same person who is at the register...so I saw the girl in the flesh...and she did the same things she did to me on the phone in person! Yet again I was in the middle of talking to her and she answers the phone without warning. What?!

And also...the whole time I&#39;m talking to her she never made eye contact. This girl had a serious attitude problem.
When I got my wings, I asked about why I didn&#39;t get any carrots/celery and ranch and she says that that doesn&#39;t qualify on the special days or something...but no where on any sign or anything did it state that. 

I then asked for extra dipping sauces and she responded as if it was the biggest task in the world. It&#39;s not like I was asking her to wipe my butt. But she acted like it.
So rude.

Thankfully the food was decent so I was content but thinking back on the service I was given by this girl from the absolute beginning of my interaction with bdubs that day is extremely disappointing.

First we walk into this establishment, and I have never seen such a large amount of uncultured swines in my entire life. So me and my chica&#39;s sit down, and I felt an odd grease on my seat. I decided that I would let it slide since I wanted to have a good time. I sit down, and wait a solid 25 minutes for the waiter to even ask what I wanted to drink. Once he finally asks, I say all I want is a water. He rolled his eyes and walked away. I then proceed to drink, but realize..HE GAVE NO STRAW, I WAS LIVID. Once we said we were ready to order, he said &#34;I dont believe in ladies first&#34; AND THEN LAUGHED. I was feeling upset, so I just wanted my food and a ticket back home. He went through the list of sides and was talking so fast I almost had a seizure. Not to mention, the water tasted like backwash, and may I say I have never heard a glass sound so loud when I set it on the table; I&#39;VE HEARD MOTOR DERBIES QUIETER THAN MY GLASS OF WATER. So my chica was acting out, and THE WAITER DID NOTHING, HE JUST LAUGHED AT HER. So I decided to chill out a bit and keep calm. I asked for a little blue cheese for my soupy wings and HE BRINGS ME RANCH, AS IF HE DIDN&#39;T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. NOT TO MENTION, I COULD NOT EAT THESE SOUPY WINGS BECAUSE I WAS GIVEN NO SILVERWARE. He then walked back up to our table and said &#34;Man this place is full of hoes, I mean..my coworkers.&#34; I WAS PISSED. DO NOT DISRESPECT WOMAN YOU SWINE. I WANTED OUT, I payed for my food....AND DIDNT GET MY 37 CENTS BACK. I have never gone home more upset in my life. I think it is safe to say, I will be eating here again.

I would&#39;ve given this 1 star but our waiter was the only one on the floor and he was really busting his behind trying to take care of everyone. We came in for dinner on a Monday. There was a line at the door although there were plenty of tables open. We opted to sit in the bar area thinking it would be open seating. We were told we should have had the hostess seat is but they would take us anyway since we were already seated. Most of the tables that didn&#39;t have guests already seated there were dirty. We found the one clean table. At no time during the hour we were here were any of those tables cleaned. The wings were good though, so no complaints there, but management needs to get the staffing right. This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve seen this at this location."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Jacki A.,uLwuLJ0w0_fIo8v5aaVLHw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,37,3,52Dvu-6rxi0prb3nke0iSA,2,09/08/14,"So I knew that Bdubs had a wing special on certain days so I called to figure out what it was exactly on a Tuesday. (I know there&#39;s one day for boneless and one day for traditional but didn&#39;t know what was what). 

To figure this ish out I called them to ask..you know, why not?
Well, the girl on the phone was completely rude. I asked if there was a wing special today where they had 50 cent wings and she abruptly responded being all, &#34;Actually it&#39;s 60 cent wings&#34; WELL THEN! Take my dime, whatever.

After I hang up the phone with miss rude pants I had another question or two. I was wondering if the same deal applied to take out because some restaurants are weird like that. &#34;Oh you can have a discount on our food but only if you sit down&#34; Stupid. 

Well, I called to ask and she was rude yet again and responded like &#34;duh...&#34; but didn&#39;t actually say duh...you know what I mean. On the phone, I was in the middle of a sentence when she says &#39;please hold&#39; and puts me on hold...I was literally in the middle of talking. Was she even listening? 
So my friend places the order and I go to pick it up. I get to the cashier and I know from previous bdubs experience and friends working there that the person answering the phone is the same person who is at the register...so I saw the girl in the flesh...and she did the same things she did to me on the phone in person! Yet again I was in the middle of talking to her and she answers the phone without warning. What?!

And also...the whole time I&#39;m talking to her she never made eye contact. This girl had a serious attitude problem.
When I got my wings, I asked about why I didn&#39;t get any carrots/celery and ranch and she says that that doesn&#39;t qualify on the special days or something...but no where on any sign or anything did it state that. 

I then asked for extra dipping sauces and she responded as if it was the biggest task in the world. It&#39;s not like I was asking her to wipe my butt. But she acted like it.
So rude.

Thankfully the food was decent so I was content but thinking back on the service I was given by this girl from the absolute beginning of my interaction with bdubs that day is extremely disappointing. Now I know why everyone says to go to the one on Roosevelt road in Lombard!"buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Bethel M.,4UqYT_1T_Cx5fzCqZOPLFw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,2,ujE7h8ajc_rKEVMVVIqmIQ,1,30/07/15,"WHERE DO I BEGIN?! First we walk into this establishment, and I have never seen such a large amount of uncultured swines in my entire life. So me and my chica&#39;s sit down, and I felt an odd grease on my seat. I decided that I would let it slide since I wanted to have a good time. I sit down, and wait a solid 25 minutes for the waiter to even ask what I wanted to drink. Once he finally asks, I say all I want is a water. He rolled his eyes and walked away. I then proceed to drink, but realize..HE GAVE NO STRAW, I WAS LIVID. Once we said we were ready to order, he said &#34;I dont believe in ladies first&#34; AND THEN LAUGHED. I was feeling upset, so I just wanted my food and a ticket back home. He went through the list of sides and was talking so fast I almost had a seizure. Not to mention, the water tasted like backwash, and may I say I have never heard a glass sound so loud when I set it on the table; I&#39;VE HEARD MOTOR DERBIES QUIETER THAN MY GLASS OF WATER. So my chica was acting out, and THE WAITER DID NOTHING, HE JUST LAUGHED AT HER. So I decided to chill out a bit and keep calm. I asked for a little blue cheese for my soupy wings and HE BRINGS ME RANCH, AS IF HE DIDN&#39;T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. NOT TO MENTION, I COULD NOT EAT THESE SOUPY WINGS BECAUSE I WAS GIVEN NO SILVERWARE. He then walked back up to our table and said &#34;Man this place is full of hoes, I mean..my coworkers.&#34; I WAS PISSED. DO NOT DISRESPECT WOMAN YOU SWINE. I WANTED OUT, I payed for my food....AND DIDNT GET MY 37 CENTS BACK. I have never gone home more upset in my life. I think it is safe to say, I will be eating here again.

It also took 20 minutes for my brother and I to sit at a bar table and get service. I had to go ask someone to take our orders. They apologized and said that they were in between switching shifts but I don&#39;t think that would ever take 20 minutes. LAZINESS. I watched waitresses stand against the wall together talking.

I&#39;ll give it 3 stars because I cant say I had very high expectations and it isn&#39;t claiming to be a gourmet wing joint. It&#39;s a chucky cheese for teenagers and for some reason the entire place always smells like the filthy ball pit in a Mcdonald&#39;s playland. Time to clean your carpets scumbags.   

One thing that is completely obnoxious about this place is the constant barrage of employees that bother you from the minute you sit down until the moment you leave. When I&#39;m hungry and sit down to eat I don&#39;t want to do any surveys, and I don&#39;t give a shit if it&#39;s wacky wing month or whatever. Let me eat my fkn food! If your list of specials take you more than 5 minutes to list than you should do everyone a favor and write them down and STFU. No one cares.  It&#39;s excruciating to sit through. Once you are completely annoyed, they send in some fat buck toothed manager to make small talk and ask how your microwaved chicken wings are???!!! WTF.

I love buffalo wild wings dont get me wrong but this location is by far the worst bdubs yet.  I have given this place way too many chances and it has been the same horrible service EVERY TIME.  (on days when there are games playing.. dont even THINK about maybe coming here, EVEN WORSE) 

Here is my list of REPETITIVE issues with this location:

-LONG LONG LONG wait.. I&#39;m talking a good 40 minutes and there is very little seating.. so have fun standing.. and when there is a game on.. the wait is more like 2 hours, no joke.

-The employees lie to you saying it will be about 15-20 minutes.. ya 20 minutes my ass. 

-EXTREMELY slow service, just to get your waiter to your table is another 30 minutes of waiting

-when you FINALLY get your food (after about an hour and a half of waiting since you got there) its cold.

- when you finally get your cold food that you have been waiting hours for, they mess up your order, or they tell you the rest of it will come out later, which is awesome because I love eating a whole basket of wings and then 30 minutes later being able to eat my fries separately, NOT.

Hot and Saucy wings! It&#39;s what you go here for of course! My favorite choice is the Garlic Parmesan because of how all the flavors fight for the affections of your taste buds.

I will not be returning to this buffalo wild wings again. I&#39;ve worked in the customer service/restaurant industry and when a customer asks for something you say, of course, this way.

They gave us two waiters, the second was in case the first was busy. But when we called him, he was busy too. Not to mention they sent the first waiter on his break during our meal so it took our food forever to come to the table and they had some other waitress serving us. A drink was spilled by accident and nobody cleaned it up after we mentioned it to the staff. Asked for ketchup, it was brought after we were basically done with our meals.

Horrible staff. Don&#39;t bother trying to call in an order. Twice in a row. I was put on hold for 7 minutes at a non peak time. Ordered and was quoted 10 minutes. Showed up in about 15..order wasn&#39;t even attempted to be cooked. Cashier said 5 more minutes. He disappeared in the back for 10 minutes and the manager scrambled to help those waiting at the register. Another 15 minutes goes buy and no food. I ask and manager says it&#39;ll be out in a few. Another 5 minutes goes by and he comes scrambling out of the kitchen with my 18 wings in hand. Bag in another. 45 mins during a non peak time for a small order is unacceptable. Couple days go by and I try to order tonight l. I was placed on hold for a few minutes and when they got me off hold the employee hung up on me before I could even say hello. Thanks but daily specials aren&#39;t worth the headache.

I just wanted a relaxing evening with beer and wings, and did not want the hassle of driving into Chicago, and this place was on point. The waitress was super attentive, the beers came out cold, and the wings were hot.

I mean, that&#39;s all you really need, right? Obviously I obliterated the wings and went through my beers like they were the only source of fresh water on a deserted island, but it was the legit experience. You can&#39;t really put a price on that, especially for an out-of-towner."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Patrick S.,f8YHrZ902lZut6K-AryZOA,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,1,0,0,113,vSYZ7q7FaQd9gDd4OjK42g,2,11/01/14,"As an update- we&#39;ve been here several times now since my last review. We usually go here when we can&#39;t think of anything else. 

The problem is that we&#39;ve noticed the past two times after eating here we&#39;ve both not felt well the next day. I&#39;m not saying food poisoning or anything like that because it wasn&#39;t, and I do know that buffalo wings aren&#39;t the best for one&#39;s stomach. However, last time we just had a few wings and I had a wrap, yet the next day my wife and I felt nauseated all day long. 

We made the decision to not eat here anymore."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Yu H.,2Yuw8vPm0WEBh1IoWtSvAw,"Hanover Park, IL",0,1,1,32,30,gxxUljZ2FkY2mL1XsQcp-g,4,08/11/12,"I&#39;m a fan of this place but if you&#39;re one of those people who want to focus on the game you&#39;re watching, this isn&#39;t the place for you. Here is why:

I tried watching a football game here but the problem is its way too loud to hear any of the commentary or calls. If you care about the audio in a game you should&#39;ve probably just watched at home. They play music which drowns out any sounds from the tv&#39;s. 

Now on to the food:

A word of advice about the wings. If you want to try alot of different varieties of sauces, go on a cheap wing night (i think tues/thurs) the wings are cheaper and physically smaller so you&#39;ll get to eat more. Also go with a bunch of people because they have bulk discounts on wings. 

I recommend the bone in wings more than the boneless ones. The boneless wings are usually dry in the middle and hard fried on the outside. 

The sauces are pretty darn good here. I like the teriyaki or carribean jerk. If you have cuts on your hands or lips, NEVER get the blazin wings.

Potato wedges are tasty also, their seasoning is good. 

A note on the atmosphere, it is LOUD in here. Don&#39;t bother trying to carry a long conversation here unless you like yelling. 

Overall I&#39;d say this place is great for wings but not that good for watching sports. 

Give it a shot if you&#39;re in the mood to sauce up your fingers and face."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Johnson A.,z8v4FwZHOTY2t1EHi_jtGw,"Harwood Heights, IL",0,1,0,0,26,j9EmPDxqogcZn1ZoWVu9Zw,3,14/04/14,Ordered wings for takeout.

2 =  if there is a wait of 20 minutes or more than 5 tables ahead of you... Advise you to WALK AWAY and GO ELSEWHERE.... when they are busy you will get slow service, the order may not come out all at once, and the food may be cold. Once they are busy and behind the 8 ball the service and accuracy of orders falls apart. To the managers credit, they have done their best to fix problems when you complain but by then everyone is eating at different times. 

4 =  If they are full but medium to slow busy. 
Pro&#39;s: Good for kids and enables parents to have a little break. There is noise and activity so you don&#39;t have to worry if a child gets a little upset or if your friend&#39;s child is going through a random scream phase. They have a free hand held game, with Free games, unlike some nearby places. Food has been served hot and of good quality. Amount of sauce on bone in wings has been perfect but boneless ones need a little bit more. They can usually bring out the kids food quicker but be warned that it will be HOT and need to cool down.
Cons:  The server is usually different from the person who delivers the food and this can cause a disconnect if order needs any adjustment. Prepare to mention it to both people who stop by the table as the delivery person does not always communicate with the server. Sometimes the kids food is too Hot and can take 10 min to cool down enough for them to eat."buffalo-wild-wings-bloomingdale,Melissa L.,#NAME?,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,1,0,0,11,J2N3i5dqfXXOfcLpXwXWQw,2,22/05/13,"I was pretty excited when this place opened last year, but every experience we have here is worse then the one before it.

We went last night and when we walked in we thought we would be seated right away due to the fact that half the patio was open and there were over a handful of seats open in the main dining room. The hostess told us that it would be at least a 15 minute wait and I asked if there was a wait for the patio since it was half empty and she replied with the excuse &#34;I don&#39;t know. I am here alone and haven&#39;t checked.&#34; A couple came in right after us and said they wanted to sit on the patio and were seated right away.

After we were seated the service was sub-par and we were surrounded by tables with food under them and covered in trash for longer than they should have been. 

When we left at 9:45 the hostess still had a waiting list going even though there were over 8 tables open in the main dining room and the patio was less than half full.

I know it&#39;s probably one of the busiest days of the year for them, but that being said you&#39;d think they would have a better method for getting carry out orders out.  When I called they said it would be an hour and twenty minutes, which I was fine with.  When I arrived an hour later, it was mass chaos.  Once I paid I was told to wait by the special tables set up in the bar area.  The tables had so many people crowded around them you couldn&#39;t even get close.  They were set up by alphabet, and the A-G tables were empty.  I was waiting for a B order so I figured my order wasn&#39;t ready yet.  After about 20 minutes with only one girl trying to get orders out, I noticed there was a bag on the M-Z table that no one had touched.  I finally pressed my way through about 5 people to get close enough to check the receipt name, and sure enough it was my order.  There was no one to confirm with, so I just grabbed our bag and pushed through the growing crowd to get out.  People dining in were getting annoyed because they couldn&#39;t get through the crowd to the bathroom, and it was so  loud you couldn&#39;t even hear the game! When I got my food home it was cold and the order was wrong (sauces were incorrect, and cheese that was supposed to be on the side for the fries was cold and globbed on top. We had to toss the fries.) It was a waste of money for the cold food we didn&#39;t really enjoy.

Now, you can&#39;t order a dozen wings...  You order a &#34;large&#34;, which will be a variable number, depending on the average size of wings on that day, which is insane...  How do I split the order so that my kids get equal numbers of the flavor they want?  But wait...  It gets worse...  Apparently, they now pile them all together on the same tray.  This means that my super hot ones are served on top of my son&#39;s mild ones, and the sauces are all mixed together.  Multiple requests to fix the problem resulted in the manager &#34;making a special exception&#34; and separating them into their own paper trays (like they always have in the past).  After all of that, it took over an hour to get our order right, and what did they offer in order to make up for the whole fiasco?  $5 off of our next visit.  No point.

It is is a little bit smaller than all of the other locations. It is nice to have a location close to home, becuase I used to have to go to the one in Warrenville or Lombard which is kind of a drive for me. When we got there, we did not have to wait which was nice. Wh were greeted by our server quickly, but both of my parents were carded. So, no matter how old you are, make sure to have an ID on you! We ordered our food and it seemed to take a little bit of time to get to our table. Our waitress told us she was going to check on our food, but when she came back out, she never said anything to us. A few minutes later, our food was out at the table. I generally order one of the chicken wraps when we go on a night where the wings aren&#39;t on special. When I got the wrap, it seemed like it was missing ingredients compared to all of the other locations I have been to. I understand this is a new restaurant and they are all adjusting to this.

Don&#39;t miss out on the artichoke appetizer.  Roasted with butter and breadcrumbs.  It was a fun and relaxing way to start dinner and get into your wine and a bargain at the same time.

The wine list I thought was a bit spartan.  Not a large list in general, and especially in the few Italian choices.  Not that it&#39;s inadequate, but I just would&#39;ve expected the wine list to match the large menu.

The pastas were phenomenal, in particular the bolognase, and can definitely be shared by a few as a primi or as a large main course. I really liked their option for penne versus the traditional long noodle. Big, rich flavor really rose to the occasion. 

The patio is very comfortable on a warm summer evening.

When I Google food, the first that popped up is Zazas Italian. We tried it and we were not disappointed. The ambiance  is very nice. The fish entrees were cooked to perfection. The portions are huge (bring your appetite).  The server (her name is Kim) is very friendly.  She made us feel so welcome in IL when she found out we are visiting from CA (much appreciated)."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Jennifer P.,bDXSrl19qIe0Hb-cZcCJ5A,"Addison, IL",1,1,1,249,1,pk9dRLcvHOIxGYQ98Oib8Q,5,26/01/16,"I&#39;ve driven by Zaza&#39;s several times and have even been at neighboring businesses, but realize I&#39;d never noticed it before.  I&#39;m glad I had the opportunity to change that the other night!

Ambience - in the bar area, of all places - was actually pretty nice. We sat right by the toasty warm fire. Speaking of toasty - the complimentary bread was nice and steamy!

I had the chicken polenta dish ($17) and, like a schmuck who doesn&#39;t appropriately pair my wines with my proteins, a glass of Mnajtrois (mixed red, $7). The pour was generous.

The chicken (2 breasts) was delicious: very tender and perfectly cooked, saucy, and seasoned well. It was topped with big chunks of fresh mushrooms. The side of spinach was generous and lightly steamed. I&#39;d never had polenta before, and it was sadly the most &#34;forgettable&#34; part of the dish... I think just due to the fact that the portion of it was literally dwarfed by the chicken.

My +1 had a pasta dish and he requested a different pasta than was listed on the menu, plus veggies that were also not listed. He was accommodated with a smile, which I thought was very nice. 

Our young male server was personable and attentive without being overbearing. The only thing I thought was a bit unprofessional was the PDA between him and a female hostess - bear hugs and neck nuzzling. (Ahh, young love!) I felt a bit uncomfortable with the scene, but luckily they didn&#39;t carry on too much. 

The server gave us complimentary cannoli at the end of the evening, which I guess makes up for it. :)

&#34;Generous&#34; actually seemed to be the norm: pours, entree sizes, and that nice cannoli. Color me impressed!

Zaza&#39;s ended up being better than &#34;JUST another Italian place,&#34; and I&#39;d definitely head back for another meal."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Lisa Z.,F-DT-0GLMcYmIo2z9ptXGw,"Addison, IL",0,1,0,9,139,DNq-oNpyHlAMc20laNzzQQ,1,12/09/16,"About 4 years ago I had a bad experience at ZSA ZSA in Addison Illinois.  Went for girlfriend birthday party and service was terrible.  We chose not to give the 20% tip because of the lousy service.  The waitress came back with the bill and told us that we did not leave a 20% tip.  That was the last time I was there.  I recently received a gift certificate and we decided to go there on 09-10-16 in Addison.  Everything was fine until we received our bill and at the end of the bill in big letters there was a message that stated &#34;SHE IS THE BITCH THAT&#34;.  I showed the bill to my boyfriend and he was fuming.  I then called the waitress  over to ask to speak to manager when my boyfriend explained to her why we were calling the manager over.  She then took the bill out of my hand and explained to me that this was not meant for me and that she was embarrassed (as she should be)  she claimed that this was for another customer.  Whether it was for me or not this is how a waitress conducts business?  This is not acceptable.  I did not talk to the manager as I should have.  She asked me several times if I wanted to.  I thought when she asked me that , that I would not be really talking to the manager.  Why would she insist for me to talk to manager?  She again apologize and asked if she could do anything for me?  Why would I have to come up with what they could do for me that is something that they should be worried about.  I insisted our dinner be paid for.  Needless to say they paid for it and we left without talking to manager.  I have posted the picture of the bill on facebook and mentioned the incident.  I will never go back and will not recommend this to anyone."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,R J.,oxCW-7CcxChPkX4L7Eae5g,"Kodiak, AK",0,1,1,0,5,9RwPNirfIUS7k8r4XBcpdg,3,27/08/15,"Mixed experience here. 

Service from Victor (who came recommended on other reviews) was rushed and impersonal. 

Food also mixed- see my posted pics. Caprese salad and pasta special were mediocre to awful. Canned crab meat as a sauce base? Yuck! Shrimp mixed in a pasta dish with tails still on? Just wrong. And $24!

The pasta abruzzese was actually quite good. 

Overall, an expensive, forgettable meal.

Mediocre food as well as service. Although she was very nice to allow us to try 2 wines before we decided which we wanted to order, I had an adjustment to a menu item and our server insisted (server times) that I did not tell her. Even though I was not arguing the point, she kept making her point that had I told her she would have made sure the dish came without avocado. There were 5 other people at my table that heard me say it. 
The risotto side dish wasn&#39;t risotto at all. No way it was made with arborio rice and after the avocado situation, I realized there was no point in asking. 
The filet was just ok because it wasn&#39;t a beautiful, center cut piece. Seemed a bit sad. 
Overall, much better places to spend your money."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Nancy L.,yzWz3gHekKx_SLcrvR_VfA,"Addison, IL",1,1,1,153,16,3fvNVOPdtsBWROXkiAMSZQ,4,19/05/15,"In terms of dcor and ambience, ZaZa&#39;s leans towards the classier side in this area in a non pretentious way.. when I&#39;m in the mood for this and don&#39;t feel like venturing too far away, I come here. 

The warm and inviting bar is wrapped with a copper mosaic tile complimenting the black granite bar top.  There is also a fireplace :) The deep red walls showcase Michelangelo&#39;s David.  The lighting sets a romantic tone and it just feels &#39;swanky&#39;....There&#39;s also a few t.v.&#39;s behind the bar.  It&#39;s cozy and has a sultry vibe.  Service is friendly and welcoming here.  Some servers have been here a long time and they treat you like they know you...(well they should know me cause I&#39;ve been here more times than I can remember).  I&#39;ve been here with dates and friends and we enjoy the selection of potent cocktails.

For Italian fare which happens to include great steaks this place puts out some terrific dishes. For app&#39;s - the mussels in tomato sauce are always tasty &amp; if the mussels are not good that night they will tell you if you ask (which I usually do). Have you ever ordered mussels only to find half the shells are empty??  Not cool and just get&#39;s my Italian blood pumpin.  The carpaccio with wild mushrooms and avocado is always a must order for me here &amp; the baked goat cheese in tomato sauce while not a complicated dish, satisfies your need for some warm, comforting cheese.  These starters alone could complete my meal &amp; have.

For entrees the pan roasted chicken with roasted artichoke hearts in a tomato sauce with melted mozzarella and side of linguini is delicious.  I especially LOVE the artichokes (mmmmm) &amp;  reasonably priced compared to some of their other entrees or when you don&#39;t feel like spending $30 on a New York strip.  But when you do, this is just as good as some of steaks you&#39;ll find at upscale steak houses and it comes with potatoes and a veggie..no this not a la carte.  Entrees are decent portions.   I don&#39;t usually order the pasta dishes only because I think spending over $12 on pasta here is a crime especially when its very simply prepared.  Pasta is cheap and so are tomatoes.  I opt for either steak, poultry or seafood specials.  Pizza&#39;s are pretty tasty too..

They also have a small outdoor patio.  Just come and hang out at the bar, enjoy the ambience or savor an above average meal.  They&#39;ll treat you like a paisano!!!

They are fast and you don&#39;t wait on food for long. Bread is at every table, along with oil, salt, pepper, and cheese to dress your bread however you like. 

Parking can be tricky. I got lucky and found a spot right in front. Plan on have to walk a bit if it is a busy night. By a bit I mean from the back of the building to the front. 

I had an allergic reaction to something in my food. I don&#39;t know what because I have never experienced food allergy before.

We often sit in the bar when we go which is nice (though there is dining room seating); therefore, we usually get the same waiter! He&#39;s great, so nice, so knowledgeable of the menu and wines, and you&#39;d think you were one of his family coming for dinner the way he happily greets you.
    The food has always been great, so far, and I&#39;ve ordered various dishes. Having just eaten there yet again, whatever I ate was so good that I&#39;m glad I have leftovers. Some sort of gnocchi and shrimp in a garlic cream sauce and what may&#39;ve been calamari. Definitely recommend it. The desserts are good, my little sister is very fond of the crme brle. Of course you can get some of your typical fettuccini alfredo, but if you consider that a meal you might as well go to Awful Garden-- I mean Olive Garden... though Zaza&#39;s F.A. is still no doubt better. 
    This is located right across from Marcus Theatre, the parking lot could be better, it does have a patio if you don&#39;t mind being in close proximity to traffic, but all in all I like Zaza&#39;s quite a lot.

Guess they were going for a certain flavor that I didn&#39;t&#39; have and ultimately didn&#39;t fly because the valet is long gone and so is the pretentious edge. So if you too experienced that and are amazed they&#39;re still open, give it another try.  

Service is always good and for dining I prefer the bar (has fireplace) and patio (ditto) to the dining room.  Dining room is nice...it&#39;s just preference.  Service is always good.

The place itself is very clean and the decor very nice Italian Restaurant-ish.  The service here is great, the host is very friendly and the waitstaff super attentive.

To start they give you warm bread with olive oil &amp; parmesan cheese.  The bread is not the best I&#39;ve eaten at an Italian restaurant but still very good.  I ordered the Penne Abruzzese (penne with a tomato based sauce with sausage and pancetta).  It was delicious; the penne was al dente and they didn&#39;t skimp on the pancetta.  Portion was pretty big, even had enough leftovers to make another meal.

I also ordered a Capellini Pomodoro to go for a friend and they were kind enough to include some of their bread with it!  Just a little example of their kind service that goes along with a great meal."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,N M.,gOCUCMYwkVcwNerRr5Gczw,"Bensenville, IL",0,1,0,1,28,VcB9d9QM4MzAHzcoJqHYYA,4,28/03/15,Decided to try this restaurant.

I had rigatoni with sausage and broccoli in a light cream sauce.  It was delicious, and the serving was HUGE!  we had fried calamari as an appetizer, which was great, and cheesecake and cappuccino for dessert.

We went last evening. We started with the bread with olives and melted goat cheese in sauce. OH YUM!  What a fantastic way to start the meal. I then ventured on to the Whitefish with a white wine lemon sauce and capers with sauted spinach on the side.  It was magical, from the first bite to the last to me wanting to lick the plate, it was perfect. My dining partners chose the Rigatoni with scallops (special) and the pasta with carbonara and by the lack of conversation and the ummmmm,s heard throughout the meal, I would say they were very happy.  Dessert was a must.  One had the strawberry dessert, the other the tartufo and I had the carrot cake.  All fabulous as well.
The atmosphere is warm and inviting as is the staff. There were larger groups last evening and you would be concerned the noise level would be high.  Not a problem there.   Our wonderful water man was on top of it every step of the way.  Our waitress is outstanding.  We have had her a few times now and she is excellent, keeping you informed, answering all our questions...just great.

Other than some mom and pop type fast food or my local carniceria, my go-to&#39;s are always in another &#39;burb or in Chicago. I was definitely put in my place when my gal pals invited me out for lunch at ZaZa&#39;s. 

I&#39;ve never gone wrong when I&#39;ve ordered the special of the day and at Zaza&#39;s, their lunch special was impressive.  Two of the specials were salmon, and two of us opted for the grilled salmon, served with a creamy mushroom leek sauce, served with sauteed spinach.  It was absolutely delicious.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  Fresh and flaky (in a good way) and so flavorful.  The sauce was divine, I had it served on the side and I just wanted to mop the rest up with my bread. One of the lunch trio ordered the salmon Caesar and that looked just as impressive.  The salmon that was served to us was a very nice portion and not at all a &#34;lunchified&#34; portion--you know what I mean. 
We lingered over coffee--it was Lavazza.  Rich, bold, wonderful taste. Refills aplenty.

Service was really good, friendly and on point.  The restaurant was empty save for a large lunch group and some ladies enjoying the patio. But as I was waiting for my friends to arrive, I saw many diners coming and going.  I can&#39;t comment on the rest of the menu because as soon as our server read the specials, I knew that&#39;s what I wanted. 
Beautiful setting.  It&#39;s in a semi crowded strip mall so parking is cramped when it&#39;s busy.

Made reservations and were seated next to the kitchen and the area they were using to unload glasses (so, quite loud).  We asked to be seated at one of 6 empty tables away from this area and were told &#34;each and every table&#34; was booked until close (and the manager was dealing with &#34;1000&#34; catering orders, so they weren&#39;t available).  So we ate...yes, yum... and watched 4 of the 6 tables remain empty for 2 hours until they were cleaning up.  So if this isn&#39;t bothersome to you... By all means, go!

Several coworkers had commented on how wonderful their food is.   When the opportunity to choose a place for special girl&#39;s night Leap Day dinner presented itself to me I jumped at the chance.  ZaZa&#39;s it is!  I appreciated when I called to make the reservation Victor asked if I wanted the Addison location, which I did, as I didn&#39;t realize they had another location.  

The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous inside.  I love the decor and the ambiance is perfect.  Upscale but not pretentious.  They have a nice little bar area and a decent amount of high-top seating in the lounge, then regular tables in the dining area.  

The have an excellent drink menu and I opted for the white wine flight - all three wines were equally good, though I&#39;m always partial to a riesling.  My friends had red wine which they also enjoyed.  They have so many wonderful things on the menu you won&#39;t have to twist my arm to come back here again for more!  They also had a number of specials, which I usually prefer to order from at any restaurant.  Our group all ordered from the specials menu and were not disappointed.

I had an amazing salmon dish.  It was a layered dish which started with a wonderful tomato and basil sauce on the plate, a potato pancake, roasted fennel, then a large grilled salmon filet, perfectly seasoned, with light arugula salad and viniagrette on top.  Wow.  A few of us had the same dish and I was the only one who resisted consuming it all.  So very delicious.

It arrived timely and was served hot.  I was a little disappointed by the portion size of the Salmon.  I was expecting a nice 1-2&#34; thick cut and a good serving size of 5-8 oz.  The piece I received was rather thin on the ends making the crispy fried outside (pan basted) texture overpowering.  This also made the ends rather dry, which made the cut feel much smaller than what it probably weighed prior.  The fire roasted spinach was okay, but under seasoned (or no seasoning used at all).  The sauce was also okay, but lacked a mustard taste which I was looking forward to.  The portabella mushrooms were very delicious.  They were very well prepared.  They were hot and tender, but not so much they were mush.  Next time I plan on trying some other entree.  This was just not a great &#34;I must come back to have again&#34; entree menu choice for me.  Our waiter Victor was very nice.

I had the rib eye, medium rare, and it was the greatest steak I&#39;ve ever had in my life. It was seasoned perfectly, had an amazing char on it, and was cooked superbly. I was a little offput at first when it came out with a light gravy on it, considering the place is a self proclaimed &#34;steakhouse,&#34; but with the first bite I realized that the gravy didn&#39;t take away from the steak, and the steak certainly didn&#39;t need the gravy. It was light enough that it complimented the steak perfectly and kept the flavor on it instead of running all over the plate. I also ordered mushrooms on the side as I typically do, but found that I actually preferred the steak without them. This is not to say that the mushrooms weren&#39;t good however, because quite the contrary was true. The mixed vegetables were very good, the garlic mashed were alright and probably would have gone great with some more of that steak gravy, but the star of the entree definitely shined. I paired the meal with an Argentinean malbec that was also phenomenal. To finish the visit, I ordered the Chocolate Tartufo. I&#39;m not huge on desert at restaurants, but this completed the meal wonderfully. I can&#39;t wait to get back to this place and place the same order."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Saba A.,M8Fre7R4ZGbc37Jv5V7TGA,"River North, Chicago, IL",1,1,1,349,2,8biC8JZQOj-4sjBIjvYYRw,3,09/04/12,"I guess this is the only stop in the Addison Area that seems &#34;classy&#34; enough but I would rather just get my pasta from Applebees across the street and save money, get a little bit more hoppin&#39; of entertainment, and taste. It&#39;s your usual everyday pasta dishes, but if you are looking for a &#34;romantic&#34; dinner for two, this is the place!

I wish I stopped by for a drink rather than have sat and split a whole dish between my fiance and I. We split spaghetti and it was good, but it was just quiet and boring. Our server was great, she named all the specials and was quite attentive. The ambiance brought me back to Italy a little bit but I don&#39;t know, it was more of a museum place to me. They were putting away wine bottles that were in boxes right in front of us and I was just kinda ready to leave. 

I&#39;m glad I tried it because otherwise I&#39;d just be curious.

My goat cheese in tomato sauce appetizer was PHENOMENAL.  I was highly let down by my meal though.  Zaza&#39;s has proven my point that it is near impossible to find good Italian fare in the suburbs.  I had penne pasta with crumbled sausage and pancetta in a tomato sauce.  The sausage was barely edible and the sauce was very ho hum.  It almost had that Chef Boy R Dee taste.  What a disappointment.  My husband really liked his steak though.

I had always loved the stuffed artichoke, the quality was poor this last time it was as if sat in the fridge and they reheated it. I had a pasta dish which they used the same sauce they serve cold on the table. My husband had ordered the Steaks and the quality was poor. It is too expensive of a restaurant for such poor quality.

My boyfriend and I have only been here twice yet we keep coming back for the same entrees because you cannot find anything close to being as good.  

So far we have gotten the bruschetta, calamari, potato soup as starters and sides and they were AWESOME.  As for the entrees we ordered the Pollo Arrosto al Rosmarino and Petto di Pollo Limone, which are both TO DIE FOR.  You can tell that everything is extremely fresh and homemade! Not to mention, it comes out very fast even though the Pollo Arrosto al Rosmarino has the bone in.

Considering I was driving the tab up in plenty other areas why stick me with that? We didn&#39;t ask for more food, just split the portion.  We also ordered soup and had the bread, artichokes etc so we were quite full already.   Also, what&#39;s with the roman statue picture with his man parts dangling in the dining room?   My date noticed this and it made for a good laugh, so I&#39;m not sure what to make of it... Just a tad jarring to see the boys hanging out when your in a fine Italian restaurant.

The staff was really nice but inconsistent.  I was immediately sat, but then waited a long time for water.  We ordered lunch but never saw a bread basket even though we had bread plates.  That is a peeve of mine.  If there&#39;s no bread then there should be no plates!  Then I wouldn&#39;t have expectations.
My friend got the salmon special which was covered with some crab and had a side of linguine.  It looked heavy esp for lunch and esp for salmon.  Maybe omit the crab and change the pasta for salad.  My other friend got the steak salad which looked amazing!  I had the chicken tortellini.  It was yummy and comforting but had way too much sun dried tomatoes!  Maybe chop them up and have less.  Less is more when it comes to sun dried tomatoes.  Then they could add asparagus or olives or something else.

The two biggest highlights for me are their white fish and their ribeye which is not usually on the menu, but usually availible by request.  We have ventured other directions, but found different choices to be average.  I am one who rarely likes a steak that I have not cooked by myself or a place that does them to perfection.  This one is on the pricey side ($50ish), but it is worth it.

I have tried many things on their menu and have yet to be less than satisfied. I had the fish special the last time I was in that had an avocado salsa on top pair with risotto. That was delicious!

I usually get their fish that comes with the sauteed spinach which is rather healthy and flavorful."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Roseanne S.,lg1UvP-7KLtjSdxbFbt3Aw,"Villa Park, IL",1,1,0,92,46,RPaWh_DvrU2JmNthKXoQXw,2,18/06/12,"Definitely was not impressed. Living in the area, I pass this place by many times and always wondered about it. My boyfriend and I really had a taste for steak and seeing as this is a STEAKhouse, we decided to try it out. There was nobody in the resturant on a Saturday at 5 which to me is always a warning sign, but we went in anyway. 

The inside was nicely set up with white table clothes and the like. I was very disappointed when I saw the menu, though. Only two steak items? Are you kidding me? Their steak options were New York Strip and Filet Mingon. I&#39;m a girl who loves a good, hearty steak so I was looking forward to a Ribeye, which was not to be found. The waitress came by with the specials. As soon as she said Ribeye, my ears perked up only to find out that it was a 20 oz Ribeye for $40. Yikes. That&#39;s way too much steak. I could have gotten it, but then I would have leftovers for sure, and it wouldn&#39;t taste as good the next day, if I remembered to eat it. And that price tag is too high. I asked if they had a half portion of the Ribeye and she said they do on some days but today was not one of those days. I don&#39;t think you should have this popular steak available on SOME days. Also, they should think of the money they could make if they offered a smaller portion. Instead of selling me an $8 salad which is what I ended up getting, you could have sold me a 10 oz steak for $20. Win-win.  

Like I said, I ordered a salad (Caprese) which was nothing special. I had made one at home earlier that week and it was much better. They used way too much oil. I was scraping it off on the side of my plate. My boyfriend had some pasta which looked good and was a huge portion, but I wasn&#39;t in the mood for pasta at a steakhouse. Maybe this is what an Italian steakhouse is but for my money, I&#39;d rather go somewhere with a lot of meat options if I&#39;m going to pay that much.

I barely mentioned it to the Hostess at the door and my server (Alexis, GREAT JOB! Thank you for making our meal so pleasant) knew about it the very first time she approached our table. The chef replaced the pasta with a perfectly done risotto along with the filet tip special. DELICIOUS!

So, my husband and I decided to try their Addison location since we were going to the movies across the street this past weekend. Based on both of our meals (and we tried eachother&#39;s)....the consensus was a big NO.

The staff was friendly and there were a couple of larger groups in the same seating area as us who were seeming to enjoy their food.  The hostess and our waitress were very friendly.    I did think it a bit odd she didn&#39;t ask if we wanted to start out with an appetizer (or make recommendations), ask if we wanted a salad, etc.    I&#39;ve never been to an Italian restaurant that didn&#39;t ask if you wanted pepper or fresh parmesan cheese grated onto your pasta.   The waitress didn&#39;t ask or offer.

I got the special of the night - Mahi Mahi with scallops and garlic mashed potatoes.  My meal was very watery - if it was intended to be the sauce, it certainly didn&#39;t have any flavor and was more like water.  The garlic mashed potatoes had no flavor and were watered down.  They put the Mahi Mahi on top of the potatoes and there were barely any potatoes that I actually forgot there were potatoes on my plate until I got half way through the Mahi Mahi (due to having no taste and they weren&#39;t very visible along with the spinach).   The scallops had a very fish smell so I am going to assume that is because they were very fresh.   Disappointing to say the least for a $24 dish.

My husband had the Penne Abruzzese and he was not impressed with it.  It seemed to lack on the meat and just wasn&#39;t very flavorful overall.

The best we had that evening was the warm bread - very good with the tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.   I thought of sending the Mahi Mahi back but we were hungry and didn&#39;t want to miss our movie.   But we won&#39;t be back at this ZaZa&#39;s location.

For starters I had a cold Stella with the appropriate chilled Stella glass and my best lady had a Flirtini. A Flirtini is 2 Oz. Champagne - 3/4 Oz Vodka - 1 Oz Pineapple Juice and my wife loved it.

My husband&#39;s office is nearby so occasionally, we come here after I pick him up for dinner right before their closing time. I also come here with one of my girlfriends for girls night out. 

I&#39;m so beyond disappointed with the owner/manager&#39;s service--I&#39;ve seen better customer service/appreciation at Olive Garden. I always order penne with vodka sauce and lobster. The last few times I&#39;ve been here, food was so disappointing I ordered takeout after. This was strike three for me. 

My husband and I try not to indulge in carbs too much so when we treat ourselves to pasta, we split our entree to eat smaller portions--the servers are all awesome and know my order. They split a lobster tail in half for me and my husband, but it was so so so salty it literally made me gag. I immediately took it out of my plate, but i had already mixed it into my pasta so it ruined my amazing vodka sauce! I called the server who told a man I&#39;m assuming is the owner--he didn&#39;t at all apologize or show any sincerity. He seemed irritated with my complaint and said the kitchen was closed. He asked if both mine and my husbands lobster was bad (uhm, you split one tail down the middle so obviously). I asked if I could have a fresh plate because my pasta became salty as HELL. He said kitchens closed but he will take &#39;my pasta&#39; off..I explained yet again that I split a single entree with my husband and he said he will take &#39;something off&#39;..I said its fine ill just eat it because it was my first meal for the day and I didn&#39;t feel like stopping somewhere again after waiting on their food. 

When we got the check, my pasta is $17.95 + $20 for the lobster tail + $3 to split and at the end there was a -$10. Wtf?!?! We shut up and ate salty ass pasta and returned the lobster tail, at least don&#39;t charge us for the tail! Our server was a sweetheart and said the guy was probably &#39;confused&#39; so he literally came up to our table to ask us in person if we ate the half of the lobster tail..my husband explained that we both took out the tails off our plate. Again, this guy was not apologetic whatsoever &amp; seemed annoyed as if he didn&#39;t believe us. What kind of management harasses their customer or risks their integrity over $20?!?! I felt embarrassed to even be asked to explain something for $10! This is a &#34;steakhouse&#34;! 

1.) I live in downtown, I have a million options for dining. 

2.) I come here ONLY for the vodka sauce, I don&#39;t give an eff about a refund. It&#39;s the principle and lousy service that made us even point out that they didn&#39;t even take the entire lobster tail off our bill. I wasn&#39;t trying to get anything taken off my bill, I wanted to eat a semi-consistent tasting pasta. Anyone who orders the same exact thing every time can understand how annoying it is when it doesn&#39;t taste the same--this was the third time in a row this happened. 

3.) Not everyone is after a free meal. If I wasn&#39;t irritated over the lame food and owner&#39;s attitude, I wouldn&#39;t have objected to a measly $10. I&#39;ve never so much as checked a single price on their menu and until today, I had no idea how much I pay for my usual entree--as long as the food is on point, I&#39;m satisfied. 

Definitely not coming back again."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Claire M.,ZCcW1CCb2jsbCiX2py6XWg,"Bartlett, IL",0,1,0,0,10,OnwxFugvOUQ0JGqWjFcC7A,5,31/05/13,"Wow! This place is as good as it gets! My husband and I just got back from dinner at ZaZa&#39;s and we had a Ruth&#39;s Chris experience at an Outback price! From the moment our reservation was made we knew we were in for a treat. We arrived and were seated right at the FIre place (Romantic and warm!) MaryAnn was excellent, cheerful and sweet. Our waiter was Victor, he was quick to explain the menu to us when we mentioned we had never been there before. He even made suggestions as to how to get the most bang for our buck! 
The food was divine! I highly recommend the Sea Bass and my husband had the Salmon (delicious!). The General Manager made his way over to our table and made sure we were treated well. He was quick to joke around with us, and graciously accept our many compliments about his entire staff! 

Our only disappointment is that we didn&#39;t have room for dessert! 

We are looking for so many reason to go back and can&#39;t wait to tell our friend&#39;s and family about our experience!

I wish we would have picked somewhere else.  We had never been there, but picked a place in between our parents so it would be convenient for them.  Our waitress, Chelsea, was not wonderful.  She was not attentive and instead of asking me to repeat myself twice she said &#34;What?&#34;. Pet peeve...that&#39;s not polite, people!  She would wander off for 5-10 minutes and we could never find her to get a drink or a refill. We tossed around the idea of ordering 2 or 3 bottles of champagne, then decided on 2.  She brought 3.  We gave her the unopened one back and she had the nerve to state twice that we had ordered 3.  There were 6 of us at the table...that&#39;s 12 ears to her 2 ears.  She took it back, reluctantly.  The bottle was unopened so I&#39;m not sure what the issue was.  All of the pastas were ok at best, the pesto was AWFUL, probably the worst I&#39;ve ever had-super bland, boring, yuck. There was a special Valentine&#39;s Day menu that they would not deviate away from which made me angry because there was NOTHING diet friendly on there.  There was no mention of this special menu online either, so we had no way of knowing.  Preparing for a wedding, I wasn&#39;t trying to eat a heavy meal.

The place was SO loud and SO crowded.  We were on top of the surrounding tables and could hardly get out to go to the bathroom. I hate that! 

After the waitress was rude, my fiance went and talked to the manager, Al.  He didn&#39;t comp anything, but he brought us limoncello....which was gross.  I&#39;ve never had it in a glass with ice and it was just way too bitter to sip.  However, he was really nice, chatted with us, took a picture for us and for that I gave this place another star.

Overall, I&#39;d say this place was mediocre, but I don&#39;t often eat in Addison so I don&#39;t know where else I would recommend.

My bf and I were craving Italian one evening and figured we would give ZaZa&#39;s a shot since we had heard fairly good things about it. The menu looked appealing, the environment was romantic, and the prices seemed fair, so we were in. 

I definitely got that old school Italian vibe. Our waitress was an Italian woman who was over-the-top ((in a good, ol&#39; fashioned Italian way!)) about making sure we got exactly what we wanted. Needless to say, the service was fantastic. 

Here&#39;s where it gets lame-o. I ordered the Capellini Pomodoro, and he ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Talk about venturing out and really trying the menu items, huh?? Oh well. Neither of us were super starving, and we were craving a big bowl of spaghetti - nothing wrong with that!! Both dishes were very good. The pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente. The sauces were rich and garlicky. Yum. The meatball was the size of a softball, and was tender and juicy. The portions were massive. I had lunch for the next following two days. We also had a couple martinis each - and they don&#39;t skimp on the booze. I definitely left with a pasta coma and a buzz -- if it&#39;s possible to have both at once. 

I will be back to give ZaZa&#39;s another go. It&#39;s probably not the place I would choose to order a steak, but I will definitely give their chicken dishes or fancied-up pasta dishes a whirl.

Service
Fantastic!  On their busy evenings the service may be a little on the slow side, but it is understandable.
Food
Appetizers: Baked clams- they are small, but packed with flavor.  The sauce that they are served in - lemon, garlic, butter - is to die for.  Stuffed artichoke: again wonderful.  the stuffing is not too heavy and it too is served in a lemon, butter, garlic type sauce that is phenomenal!
Entrees:  All of the pastas are wonderful.  They are full of flavor and are generous portions.  I have not had the steak, but others at our table have, and all have enjoyed it.  The fish - especially the whitefish - is delicious, and, like the pasta, a generous portion.
Desserts: Basic, but good.

The place was surprisingly empty for a Saturday night, but then again, we walked in at 9:45 and they were set to close pretty early (10:30).

We sat at the bar and ordered drinks - sangria for my friends, the Tuscan Sun martini for me. I was VERY pleased with my drink because it was nice and strong, just the way I like it. I tend to be disappointed with the quality of drinks at suburban restaurants, so this was a pleasant surprise. 

Ordered two appetizers to share - the artichoke and the scallops, both of which were delicious and perfect to split among three people. They also gave us fresh-out-of-the-oven bread with two little bowls of tomato sauce and parmesan cheese for extra flavor - YUM!

I&#39;d recommend this place if you live in the suburbs, like your drinks strong, and don&#39;t want to worry about waiting a while for a table on a weekend. I plan to come back for a full meal (read: steak)."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Victoria W.,zQflK7rcfasKVQzyK5pkXw,"Portland, OR",1,1,0,82,71,Q8b-9y_8g-8VWS9dFBVE3A,4,06/02/09,"I went here with my partner on a late Friday night. It was a good choice for a fairly peaceful, romantic meal with a casual vibe.

The place was beautiful and spacious -- fireplace visible from the outside, red walls and modern furnishings on the inside, somewhat odd Greek statue-inspired paintings.  The waitstaff was friendly.

There were 3 solid vegetarian options for dinner, all pastas. I had the ravioli alla fungi which was only about $12. Very tasty, though the sauce was too salty.

The Flirtini was deliciously citrusy. Artichoke appetizer was pretty interesting. Peach sorbet for dessert was perfect -- I kind of want to go back just to try the coconut and pineapple sorbets ^__^"zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Laine K.,m3ScQtbOSpwzkb74MoxB7Q,"Berwyn, IL",0,1,0,19,11,oDeK03NbqWFi-iz7fYtzSQ,2,23/04/11,"Nothing to write about.

They were pretty dead, but it was a Wednesday evening. I was in a big group of women, and I have to say they did a good job with keeping up. On their menu they have quite a bit to choose from - anything from chicken to pasta to steak. It&#39;s a nicer place, not overly expensive by any means, but I would say they are a little more expensive than an Olive Garden, but not like a 5 star restaurant. I ordered the Pollo Arrosto al Rosmarino, which was really really good. I also tried the risotto which was very good as well. Out waitress was very nice and informative, but she repeated herself a lot. She made sure we knew that they could substitute for different things and make any dish how we liked it.

When we walked in at about 730 pm there were a 4-5 tables occupied in the entire restaurant, a signal to us that something was awry.  We decided to sit in the bar area; it seemed more appealing to us.  The waiter was a bit pushy and recommended a wine to us, which was one of the more expensive ones on the menu (go figure).  We ordered a couple drinks, and they standard.  Our bruschetta appetizer was very good and garlicky and cheesy.

The waiter was friendly but was rather pushy on a couple of expensive dishes.  He probably worked at a car dealership at some point in his life because he was a terrific salesman.  I ordered a New York Strip steak - medium.  It was heavily seasoned with mushrooms and prosciutto yet nothing spectacular.  My friend S ordered a Chicken Limone and he seemed to enjoy it thoroughly - he was grinning like an idiot through his entire meal :).

It seems funny to me that this place is called an Italian steakhouse even though they really don&#39;t have a wide variety of steaks. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be visiting again, as I have had far superior steaks and overall food.

They should have shared some of that salt on other dishes since we had the blandest chicken tortelini we&#39;ve ever tried. My wife had to pour parmesian cheese on it to get some flavor. Also why is everything ala cart, I mean this was in Itasca, not the Chicago Firehouse on Michigan in Chicago. Also the waitress had ADD or something, not that it should matter but we didnt get a straight answer from her and she just stared into the wall ahead of us without making eye contact. Weird. Later, one of the managers came by and asked if we would like the tortellini packaged to go and we said no actually it was very bland having only taken 2 bites out of it and her response was just OK, No apology, no remorse and just a blank stare when I suggested the chef should really pay attention to the salt as he may have accidentally dounle salted the seafood pasta and not salted the tortellini at all. Just weird experience indeed."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Gail L.,Op7wo625P1kVloyTiDwgKw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,66,18,NdyWsYkH3yvtcFrmQ3AgBA,3,04/01/10,"I spent my entire meal staring at David&#39;s junk.

Yes, really.   Well, it was actually a huge portrait of Michelangelo&#39;s David, with a bright green merkin.   I found myself staring, despite my best efforts.  I think if you are going to have a giant portrait of David, you should just embrace the nakedness - it&#39;d be less distracting than a huge green merkin.

We started out in the bar, while waiting for the rest of our party.  At 6pm, it was quite nice, but I could see it&#39;d be unpleasant and packed later in the evening, since they had really crammed a lot of tables in there.   I had the house Shiraz, which was truly very good.   

Since it was New Years Eve, they had a special menu &#34;because they had prepped a ton of stuff&#34;, according to our waiter.  Which, fair enough.  The menu still had a lot of options.   Our appetizers were excellent - we all split an asparagus salad, fried calamari and a really really yummy shrimp dish.  

Our entrees were reasonably good - I had the filet, topped with lump crab and a yummy sauce.  My steak was cooked well.  It was a bit salty, but not horribly so.  Or at least, it wouldn&#39;t have been a problem, if my wine glass and water wasn&#39;t empty, and had been for some time.   Everyone else seemed reasonably happy with their entrees, especially the folks who had gotten pasta.

So, why only three stars?  Honestly, the service wasn&#39;t all that great.  It felt like they were battening the hatches for New Years Eve, so everything felt rushed and like a crisis was about to erupt.  The host and hostess seemed flustered, and it was only 6 pm.  We had a hard time getting drinks - the waiter, when he took our dinner order, only seemed to notice one person&#39;s drink was empty - I had to ask when he came back some time later for another glass of wine.  

I&#39;d be willing to give this place another chance - the folks who suggested it rated the pasta very highly, and perhaps it was just a New Years Eve thing."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Nick N.,KRSsCFFyzESUSz6aROiKMg,"Westmont, IL",0,1,0,0,35,v_PVCzu7euAFa46-KrpQ0Q,5,13/08/12,Went back a second time and it was nothing short of excellentzazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,Jessica G.,oKzd-2GVCf8fcbNWKlDcew,"Lombard, IL",0,1,0,88,39,1k5Jq3TAMn02EpWgA4vRHQ,4,15/07/08,"Great Atmosphere.  No complaints about the food.  Very classy place.  The service was exceptional.  We started the evening with martini&#39;s.  They had a raspberry cosmo.  Very tasty!  My husband and I do not agree on appetizers so much.  He loves shrimp cocktail, and I on the other hand, love calamari.  We always run into this problem, and most fine dining restaurants will not do a half order of calamari.  ZaZa&#39;s did this for me.  I opted for the grilled calamari.  It was very tasty.  A little zesty, drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  Our entree&#39;s were great as well.  To finish off the evening, I had a turtle martini, and we shared a tiramisu.  The tiramisu was excellent.  The drizzled the plate with a dark chocolate syrup, which really complimented the coffee flavor of the tiramisu. 

From the outside, you do not know what to expect, being as ZaZa&#39;s is in a strip mall, but the inside is very inviting.  The prices belong downtown, but you feel as though you are downtown when you are in there, so I guess the pricing goes with the atmosphere.  If you want to go to a nice place, that has large portions, this would be it.  I have paid a lot more for a lot less.

My hubby and I love steak, and we have been wanting to try this place out.  We decided to go lat night.  We were worried that it would be extremely busy for a Saturday evening.  Just the opposite - the place was empty.  

The place was beautiful inside, very modern and very comfortable atmosphere.  The waitress was good, she recommended a red wine for me and it did not disappoint.  My husband had a Za Za&#39;s martini and it was too strong for his tastes.  He ordered a different drink which was better..  The food... well let me tell ya:
I had veal scallions.  The sauce was WAY too salty.  The veal was perfectly cooked though.  It came with a side of linguine which was a little cold and not too much sauce which is good to me.  My husband had the bone in rib-eye:  medium.  It was very rare and he sent it back to be re-cooked.  Also, the au jus sauce was quite peculiar so when they re-cooked it he asked for no sauce.  The waitress was apologetic and very accommodating and of course it wasn&#39;t her fault it was undercooked so she still got a substantial tip.

This place was overpriced and over rated so we will NOT be going again for a second chance.

I had their signature steak, a ribeye. Good cut, but I&#39;ve had better. That said, perhaps I just actually wasn&#39;t in a ribeye mood that night after all. The veggies and potatoes that came along for the ride were very tasty. Among the best I&#39;ve had.

A recommendation of our wonderful server Kim.  It came with sundried tomatoes, asparagus, tips mushrooms in a light wine sauce.  Yum.  It was very tender.  We didn&#39;t need a knife.  I had the tapalia and my husband had the new york strip.  The tilapia did have a flour coating but was not loaded with bread versus fish and was very tender and juicy.

Just enough sauce to let the steak shine through.  Delicious!  The wait staff was very attentive.  We drink a lot of water and our water glasses were never empty.

We enjoyed the limoncello as neither of us like anything too sweet.  The biscotti was an excellent choice with the espresso, again not too sweet.  The owner, Al stopped by our table to greet us.  He was very cordial.  Our server even stopped long enough to share a story or two with us.  The accommodations were very comfortable.  We sat near a window but did not hear the outside car noise.  The tables were large enough to be comfortable and were always picked up between courses.  No rush, but very comfortable.  The lighting was not too bright but not so dim that we could not read the menu.  Tables were spaced comfortably apart.  The dcor was mostly wood and gave a home feel.  Soft Italian singers played in the background.  It did not drown out our conversation.  We enjoyed the restaurant and will return again.  The food, wine, personal customer service and atmosphere were very enjoyable."zazas-italian-steakhouse-addison,P.R.

I had the Camarone&#39;s shrimp tacos and they were AMAZING! Their rice was good too.

Sergio&#39;s boasts deals on these two items throughout the week. According to the sign out front margaritas are 1/2 price on Tuesday and Thursday. You can also get shrimp tacos on Friday. Unfortunately, I came on a Sunday and, as far as I can tell, there aren&#39;t any good discounts on those days. Nonetheless, we decided to check the place out since I&#39;ve passed it almost every time I&#39;ve been in Geneva. I mean, it&#39;s on State St, so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s easy to miss.

We&#39;d been hiking up and down the hills in this town all afternoon for a photo shoot, so we were very thirsty and requested lots of water right at the beginning. We quickly gulped down our glasses and were left with empty cups for quite a while. Our waiter finally returned with a pitcher of water and my fianc asked him to leave it so we could help ourselves. He seemed to be able to mange that request better and kept refilling our pitcher as needed.

We ordered the guacamole with bacon and pineapple. It was pretty interesting but I don&#39;t know if the bacon really added to this appetizer. I did like the pineapple, so I&#39;m glad we tried something new.

My fianc got a chorizo burrito and I ordered the lamb street tacos with a side of garlic butter vegetables. We both really liked what we got, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go out of my way for it. As was expected, the burrito was not nearly as good as our favorite hole-in-the-wall taqueria&#39;s, but the refried beans were really tasty. I enjoyed the lamb tacos very much but the vegetables were overly salted.

For drinks we got shots of Frida Kahlo tequila, the horchata and a piarita. The tequila was nice and sweet, the horchata was really great, and the piarita is passable. I think I&#39;ll stick to drinks on the patio next time and see how they do their other margaritas. But only if they are 1/2 price."sergios-cantina-geneva,Suzy P.,r_D3ZKqALH2UBou5ibPULQ,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,0,22,lwhjINhTfmeKoT0gUvxeKQ,1,14/09/16,Went here on 4th of July and they told us kitchen was closed 20 mins before their posted close time.

Located in downtown Geneva, this place is on the corner with a public parking lot across the street.  The inside is on the small side, but cute, nonetheless.  The chips and salsa you get upon sitting down are very good.  My friend opted for tamales and I got chicken flautas... they were very good. For drinks I had sangria and my friend ordered a house margarita on the rocks. I left very satisified after having a meal here, which was a late lunch on a Saturday.

And and added bonus... $5 off upon checking in on the Yelp app!

I want to say that I am part Mexican and lived in Texas about 5 miles from Mexico and used to go eat in Mexico, a lot, both inland and on the coasts -- so you can say I am VERY picky about my Mexican food.

Sorry, but the shrimp and avocado tostadoes were barely meh.  Frozen shrimp cut into pieces so small I actually searched through the toppings for them.  What was worse were the refried beans on the side that were out of a can -- yes, I can tell the difference.  A Mexican restaurant can&#39;t make its own refried beans?  The only thing quasi-spicy was the salsa that came with the store-bought tortilla chips.

Went here with my family for my brother&#39;s birthday - when we arrived it was fairly dead, but then the crowds picked up pretty quick.

- Chips and salsa were &#34;pretty good&#34;.

- My nachos were just &#34;okay&#34;.  While they were indeed loaded with everything, it looked like a big mess.  95% of the chips I picked up had everything that was on them just &#34;slide off&#34;, so at best I ate a bunch of soggy chips with some residual refried beans on them.  The sour cream looked as if it has been squirted on from a bottle - I prefer sour cream to just be a scoop or two on the side, not squirted all over the nachos as if it was salad dressing.  I left half of what was left in the plate as I didn&#39;t want to scoop it all up with a fork and eat it that way.  The stuff in the plate looked (the OPTICS of it, I mean) more like canned dog food than a good nacho platter.  They were ok at best, but I would not get them again.

- Beers are expensive.  My brother got two Corona&#39;s which were about $9 together.   A bit pricey.

- My family all said their meals were &#34;decent.&#34;

- Our waiter service was okay.  He was kinda slow at times, but he did get us chip refills and drink refills, so all was okay there.

- Bathrooms are the &#34;single, lock door type.&#34;  One for men, one for women.  One toilet, one sink - no urinals or multiple stalls or sinks.  I do not even think there were paper-towels or a hand dryer in there.  So only one person can be in there at a time, unlike most other restaurant washrooms which can be used by multiple people at a time and your privacy is still maintained.  This kind of bathroom is more appropriate for one of those small, shin-ding gift shops or car/home insurance places, NOT a mid-sized restaurant.  Now keep in mind this is a MEXICAN restaurant to boot, if you get my drift (I know most guys will).  In peak times, lines can back up waiting for use of the bathroom and you will hear people knocking on the door.  If anybody really has to get in there and it is backed up, I feel sorry for ya (or - go across the street real quick to Little Owl).  

All in all, just an &#39;okay&#39; place for me.  I can&#39;t say I&#39;d never come here again, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to make plans to come here either.  I assume this place does fairly well (especially spring thru fall) MOSTLY because of the &#34;location aspect&#34; - being Downtown Geneva - and having a historic, prime location right off of State St. and the Fox River."sergios-cantina-geneva,Misty S.,1pzP58PeWictHQzctMU0nQ,"Aurora, IL",1,1,1,746,25,sCk2obTgx3_h-fiV3EXHhg,4,12/04/13,"Half priced margaritas Tuesdays and Thursdays - includes house margaritas and fruity ones.  $3.50 for a large glass, you can&#39;t really beat that!  It&#39;s the same size as Lalos, but without the huge price tag of $11!  Not as delicious as Lalos, but still pretty good.  I tried both the mango and strawberry margaritas and preferred the strawberry.  The mango one had a strange taste.  

There was quite a wait for a table with about 10 people crowded by the door.  Luckily, our other half of the party had arrived half an hour early and had been waiting so that I only waited a couple of minutes before we got our table.

For dinner, I went with the pick your own 2 combo option - I chose with tamale and enchilada.  For $10, I got 1 chicken tamale, 1 chicken enchilada, rice and beans.  Seems pricey for those 2 main entrees, but there were other options that may have provided more food.  The tamale and enchilada were good.  The rice was on the hard side, but decent.  With enough half price margaritas, anything can taste good!

We got the table that was right by the door, which may be the worst table at the restaurant since it&#39;s in the middle of a high traffic area and there&#39;s a draft every time the door is opened.  Our waitress was quick, nice and attentive.

I&#39;ve tried several different dishes here- the fish tacos, enchiladas, etc. Everything I&#39;ve eaten has been fine- nothing terrible, but nothing great either. I do love that they provide free chips and salsa- and refills are free too. 

I will give Sergio&#39;s two major pluses- I have always had great service. I&#39;ve been waited on by several different staff members, and they are always friendly, attentive, and able to answer numerous questions. I also think that Sergio&#39;s is a great place for groups. I&#39;ve been here several times with parties of 10 plus people- and it is always a great time. Many of the other Mexican restaurants in the area are far too small for group gatherings- so anytime we want to do something in a big group, this is where we come.

Avoid Sergio&#39;s during peak times. Sergio&#39;s is just too small for the crush of too many people. We went at 1:30 on a Thursday and owned the place with about 3 other couples. Plenty of time to ask a lot of questions about the menu from Jerry whose recommendations were very helpful. 
Sergio&#39;s decor is bright and cheery with a lot of windows. I like a place where I can keep an eye on my car. There is a convenient public parking lot right across the street.

My older brother went with a pick two, a delicious beef burrito that was stuffed with the usual ground beef, rice, cheese, lettuce, sour cream and lightly grilled, and a tasty steak taco. I told our server Jerry that I was trying to decide between the chile relleno, the 3 drumstick mole or carnitas and he said for another $1 I could do a pick 3 and get one of each. Perfect. I liked each with the chicken mole being my favorite, not too greasy or salty and you could get the chocolate undertones for once. The chile relleno was house made and huge. I could have taken a lot more heat AND Jerry provided a ho-made looking hotter table sauce and it was perfect. The pork taco was also good, not too greasy, salty or overcooked like you get all the time. They slow cook and the carnitas still had a pink glow. Our meals came with small servings of rice and beans and better than usual friendly helpful service from Jerry. 
Our two lunches and one ice tea came to $25, fair enuf. 

Even though it was half price Margarita Thursday we still had a lot of things to do so went with their unsweetened peach iced tea. I didn&#39;t like it, and would have preferred a just plain not sweetened iced tea, but a little sugar helped.

Too cool for the patio but it looked like it would be a lot of fun on a nice night. It is not going to be quiet out there as several big trucks confirmed instantly.  
So check your expectations and avoid peak times and plan accordingly. We thought the food was surprisingly good and look forward to a half price margarita night on the deck but it is going to be crowded and not the best margarita we ever had, but the best one we ever had on a patio in Geneva for $3.50."sergios-cantina-geneva,Jeannine M.,RNVE5O6CWb9ZtraKz3hwDg,"Wheaton, IL",0,1,0,26,18,MoD3k0Eun7dR3tDXLGkMRw,2,21/09/14,"We wanted to love this place based on the street tacos we had at the Festival of the Vines a couple of weeks ago (steak CC).  Either we were starving or they used a higher quality of steak at the Festival. 

But let&#39;s start at the beginning. The stale chips and what tasted like jarred salsa was not appetizing at all. We ordered the house margaritas on the rocks - my 15 year old son could make a better margarita and he doesn&#39;t even drink (that I know of). It tasted like pure lime juice on the rocks. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love lime juice. I always have a lime available in my house. I&#39;m not a fan of sweet n sour (all sour), what about triple sec or splash of OJ? Something to tame the taste. I had to wait for my tacos to arrive to even down it. At least it wasn&#39;t that expensive or I would have felt cheated 

On to the tacos. I can eat any fatty meat (prime rib, fatty ribs, bacon w lots of fat), but I cannot do gristle!  I had to pull out at least 5 or 6 large pieces in my steak tacos. I grew up w authentic Mexican food. I never remember my uncle Lalo&#39;s tacos like this. The sauce was wonderful. Thank goodness it helped me get down the steak and the margarita. I also had a side of rice that came w my meal. Sooo under cooked. I know Mexican rice might have some firmness depending on the family but this was either overcooked sitting in a tin or way undercooked. I was sad seeing I barely eat rice. We had also ordered the shrimp tacos. The shrimp tasted fishy and the texture rubbery. The Pico served w I think some green verde, mediocre at best. 

The atmosphere - wish it was warmer and I could have sat outside. I felt it to be too bright, cafeteria style and SUPER loud. Plus our table was a random squeezed in table practically up against where the servers grab the food. It was like we were having dinner with the family next to us. 

I&#39;m giving it 2 stars because I&#39;m nice and I&#39;m guessing a family establishment. We will never go back."sergios-cantina-geneva,Tony P.,w0Kk5vAs1fm58_Eo6kKH3A,"St. Charles, IL",0,1,0,12,56,rNSoswrqjds1m9KUJwr48Q,4,03/02/15,"Great Place, friendly staff and pricing.

A little more space in this place might be nice (and since they can open the patio in the summer - there is for half of the year), but other than that that I enjoyed my meal here quite a bit!

Lets start with the reason you came:  Half price margaritas on Tuesday &amp; Thursday!  2 of our strawberry margaritas were pretty good.  One of my party said the flavor could be a little stronger, but I was OK with it when I tried their drink.  My mango was plenty strong (in both flavor and booze) and tasted great!

We had the Shrimp And Chorizo Queso Fundido for one appetizer.  It was as greasy as you expect chorizo to be and the shrimp were tasty.  One or two more quesadillas might be nice, but we made it work.  We also had the pineapple and bacon guacamole.  There was a nice little pile of small pineapple chunks and bacon on each side of a mound of guacamole that was a great flavor combination.  When I saw it I was hoping for a little more quantity, but by the time we were done eating I realized that was uncalled for.

I was stuck between lamb tacos, pork belly tacos, and the chile relleno combo.  I went with the latter and was, again, a bit disappointed in getting 1 chile relleno (note - there&#39;s no &#34;S&#34; on the menu for this one silly!) however it was pretty good.  Then I moved on the the skirt steak part of the combo and color me surprised - that was probably the best skirt steak I&#39;ve ever had!  Cooked perfectly with a sear to medium rare and the flavor was outstanding.  The black beans, rice, and accompanying peppers were good - but nobody is writing home about those.  

After sitting back lamenting about my fullness I realized that, once again, the portion size was correct (and hey, it is a giant pain to make chile rellenos).  2 appetizers between 4 people usually doesn&#39;t leave me with anything to take home, but today we had 3 very decent take out boxes in tow.

We brought a Groupon which presented no issue at all and the waitress was friendly and helpful.

My tips:
-Call your reservation in, we showed up to a half an hour wait and it looked like it was getting longer than that immediately.
-Be adventurous and try a new dish!  The menu has both the basic classics and some very interesting spins on dishes.
-Make sure somebody in your party gets the skirt steak.  I never thought the stuff could taste so good.


My only complaints would be:
1) Our table for 4 was near the bar/entrance.  Lucky me, that meant people would bump their rears into the back of my head regularly throughout the meal.
2) Someone in our party asked for red sauce and was given verde.  This could have been a sound/busy/distraction problem, but sometimes things just don&#39;t work like you want."sergios-cantina-geneva,David D.,L2R1KuRl14MyNf-UnRzShg,"Aurora, IL",0,1,1,120,6,psw-X7jctfQ4TAqtWUtBYg,4,29/03/15,"Great salsa, good service, fast, excellent enchiladas!

Well... yelp doesn&#39;t just put out ads for the heck of it. They advertised for it and then said they just don&#39;t care.

I moved to Illinois last year after 26 years in Southern California. There is almost NO good Mexican food in Illinois. I feel like I&#39;ve tried EVERY restaurant. And every time, disappointed.

This place is over 20 miles from my house and I will drive there next time I want GOOD Mexican food. It&#39;s NOT a grease truck. You can find those. 

The salsa is THE BEST I&#39;VE EVER HAD IN THIS STATE. The chips are made fresh. We had three rounds and it was all FREE. Unheard of in IL. I ate three bowls of that salsa. Mild kick, but it&#39;s the flavor that was delicious.

The chicken mole was like $12 and there were two large chicken breasts covered with homemade mole. Delicious.

Enchilada with roja sauce was incredible and the avocado tostada was also incredible. 

My SIL had the coconut crusted tilapia. Not authentic, obvy, but she liked it. I wouldn&#39;t order it. Fried fish isn&#39;t my thing.

The queso (which I don&#39;t like as it&#39;s not popular where I&#39;m from) was excellent and much like a fondue instead. No Velveeta here, folks. Real cheddar!

I&#39;ll get the guac next time for sure. 

My only issue was that they use chicken stock in their rice and I don&#39;t like that. Also, I could&#39;ve used more black beans on my plate-- as they don&#39;t have refried and their pinto beans aren&#39;t veggie-friendly.

Chips and Salsa: 9/10 - Fantastic! Almost perfection. Chips are great; one type of salsa but thats all you need. It&#39;s a green/red blended mix with the perfect amount of spice.

Entrees: 3/10 - Pretty bad. I had a chicken chimichanga and I kid you not, it tasted like sushi. Had an extremely off-putting fish taste. It was also covered in an acidic sauce. No bueno.

Margs: Was too turned off to try them.

Waitstaff - 0/10 - AWFUL. Listen here people, this was one of TWO times in my life that I&#39;ve ever not tipped. The waitress came twice total. Once to take our order, and once to bring the food. We never once got checked on, never got refills, never anything! We didn&#39;t get napkins or silverware with the meal either. We never got the check, we waited OVER an hour. We walked to the kitchen and asked for it and she gave us this look like &#34;who are you?&#34; and took another 10 minutes trying to formulate the bill. NEVER gave an apology.

Tuesdays and Thursdays they have half price frozen fruit and house margaritas. If you like meat, I&#39;d recommend Sergio&#39;s family recipe carnitas entree.

Like Roger Ebert says, &#39;there&#39;s no excuse for making a bad movie,&#39; I feel the same way about food: how can you run a restaurant and settle for plying your customers with mediocre chow?

Such was my experience here. The place itself is inviting--nice patio, perky waitstaff, tasty chips and salsa.  

But, instead of great South of The Border cuisine, the food simply goes south. 

The steak in the tacos seemed to be shorn from a new breed of bovine--the Chewy Gristle--and the tortillas they were wrapped in seemed straight off the shelf of the nearest supermercado.  Rather like a thin Mexican Frisbee--cold, hard, and muy, muy bland.

Nachos? I would like to say that they&#39;re a step above what you&#39;d get at a Friday&#39;s or a Chili&#39;s, but sadly, I cannot. Whole lotta &#39;meh.&#39;

Where&#39;s the spice, the zing, the fresh just-picked-it-out-of-the-garden-knockin&#39;-on-your-taste-buds kinda &#39;wow!&#39; we want in our Mexican? Somewhere else, apparently.

I read in someone else&#39;s review of this place that there is an actual Sergio, and he&#39;s a very nice guy. I&#39;m sure he is, and I wish him all the best in his cantina. But Serge: if you want to be more than just a memory in the Geneva Culinary Consciousness, I suggest 86&#39;ing the canned ingredients, and going for a giant helping of &#39;Fresh.&#39; 

Makes all the difference between &#39;adios&#39; and &#39;welcome back.&#39;"sergios-cantina-geneva,Nicla S.,DQn4dCe1CN1LqiVLpXJCzQ,"St. Charles, IL",0,1,0,0,16,GT4an23OHXCAPJujaJ99Kg,4,31/07/14,Great little casual location &amp; great guacamole!sergios-cantina-geneva,Brendan G.,OugzY1VIcG-xrdnafWLePA,"Warrenville, IL",0,1,0,0,90,DC_2JFtwAQZkArSMLg0O8Q,4,05/03/14,"Great food.  My wife and I took our two 5 month-old babies and had a nice corner booth.  She had a burrito and I ordered the Chille Relleno, which was awesome!  Her margarita was a bit strong for her liking, but otherwise, everything was great.

He makes an effort to make his patrons feel like family, which is nice that he takes the time among all of the typical restaurant chaos going on during an average night.

I&#39;ve been here a few times, but this last time I ventured out of my typical enchilada meal. I went with carne con napales (cactus), al pastor taco and chile relleno. It was all sooooooo delicious. 
If you like sweet dessert drinks, ask for a Ducle de Leche. It is Chocolate wine, Coconut Rum and Horchata. Kind of like a mexican mudslide! 

They don&#39;t have a lot of room inside of the restaurant, but they just opened up a second outdoor seating area called the Daiquiri Deck. This should be a good spot to hang out over summer."sergios-cantina-geneva,Patrilie H.,NWAPk83uMuK6R2V_tcJ89A,"Washington, DC",1,1,0,69,71,EAHDHPV7GyAEWXMtRC0H5w,3,23/10/12,"The carnitas were good that I ordered. A little to greasy for my taste. The margaritas were pretty spectacular though. You could tell they use fresh lime juice instead of the typical sweet and sour mix. If I am back in the area, I will go somewhere different, but overall pretty decent if you are in the mood for Mexican."sergios-cantina-geneva,Riley'sMama s.,1oDsC2wzWhlA5xCDOQm3BA,"San Diego, CA",0,1,0,6,4,xfHdbe4XHK19M9aY85qelQ,2,20/02/12,"We had a Groupon to this place.  We tried it at Festival of the Vine and it seemed pretty good, but the Yelp reviews were not very high so we were apprehensive.  

We walked in and were seated at the bar.  We showed the server our Groupon, and proceeded to order.  The Groupon said that we had the choice of nachos of quesadillas.  We opted for the nachos.  We told the server, and she said that they only came with cheese with the Groupon - yet the regular menu had it with chicken and/or steak.  So seriously people?  You are going to take meat off nachos just because we have a Groupon?  That is not cool.  Once the nachos came, the toppings were sparse.  The cheese was not even melted, and the ingredient that they had most of was lettuce.  Not good.  How do you mess up nachos?  

Our Groupon also came with 2 house margaritas with &#34;premium&#34; tequila.  These were the weakest margaritas I have ever had, and the tequila did not taste very premium.  They looked good, but were very disappointing.  They come out of a slurpie type machine.  Not very authentic, as someone else posted here.  

We then ordered the grande taco platter (2 steak and 2 carnitas tacos) and the coconut shrimp.  The steak was pretty good, but the carnitas were just so-so.  They were extremely greasy and salty.  Also, they looked like ham!  The server said that it was because they only use salt and fat to cook them in .  Even though she said it was pork butt - seems like ham to me!  Yuck.  

The coconut shrimp was pretty good but not very generous.  My wife was slightly grossed out because she hates refried beans, and her plate very clearly started with refried beans on it that had been wiped off (but not completely) and replaced with black beans.  Pretty gross.  Our bill would have been around $52 had we not had the Groupon.  I would have been even more disappointed if I spent that amount of money at this place.  Also - this place made me sick the next day.  Will not return."sergios-cantina-geneva,Luis A.,6rRK5bQQto6WxG25w1Xosg,"Elgin, IL",0,1,0,1,4,HR1dfa1lew6pThjIPx3Rtg,4,10/04/14,"Being Mexican I am very critical of the food at Mexican restaurants. That said this is one of the few places I actually go out to eat at since I usually head over to my moms place for home cooked food. I highly recommend the shrimp and chorizo queso fundido appetizer it&#39;s my favorite! My favorite dishes when I come here are the sopes, chiles rellenos and The rajas con crema tacos. The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars is the service it can be very very slow sometimes I&#39;ve waited 40 minutes before to get my check.

The location is fantastic, but the service was horrible, the ladies bathroom was disgusting (brown surprise on the floor), and the food was average.  The outdoor seating was the highlight of this experience for me.  
Our waitress may have been new to the job, but it took forever to get our drinks (one drink at a time was served), she rarely checked in with us, messed up drink order, didn&#39;t bring silverware until all of the plates were on the table (again 1-2 meals served at a time), no napkins were given while we snacked on chips and salsa.

The salsa and chips they give you is very flavorful.  We started off with nachos and chorizo and shrimp con queso fundido.  The nachos came out full of toppings and the chorizo and shrimp was great.  The chorizo was not as greasy as most places.  The melted cheese on top of the chorizo really made it super delicous.  For my entree I had the carne asada combo which come with bean, rice, pico de gallo and 2 enchiladas.  My fiancee ordered steak fajitas which smelled incredible.  They tasted just as good as they smelled.

The portions here are huge!  The food quality is above average and the price is just right.

My wife and I have came here a few times now and this is my first review. Here is my take. They sit you wherever you want table or booth and quickly bring you complimentary chips and salsa and order your drinks.  If you are a Margarita drinker I recommend the bulldog. It has a mini Corona in it as well with the slush and other liquors. Personally I have never tried the Mai Thai,  but my wife recommends it here as well.  As for getting the drinks the process is a bit slow and should pick up a little bit. As for the food it is excellent, well cooked and served pretty quick so if your trying to have a few drinks in between apps and chips hold off a bit.

I may be biased living in Pilsen, but I don&#39;t think authentic margaritas come from a machine with a swirly thing in it.

That said, this place got the job done, considering we&#39;d ridden here from Aurora along the trail, it had been raining on and off, and our asses needed to be seated on something without wheels.  At least my bony, flat excuse for an ass did.  

I got a strawberry mojito and a pineapple mojito which were both good, and no, I was not double fisting it.  I am not that much of a drunkard.  Jeez.  The chips were intensely greasy, and I mean this in a great way.  Excellent.  Tacos were fine, but nothing to scream about.  

Foodwise, I doubt I&#39;d come here if it were in the city or if other things were open (damn you Memorial Day).
